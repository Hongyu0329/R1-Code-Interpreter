    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Sequence**: The quantity `a(n)` represents the number of one-particle-irreducible (1PI) Feynman diagrams for the electron (or photon) self-energy in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) at order `2n`. This is a known sequence in theoretical physics.\n2.  **Find the Known Values**: These numbers are determined through complex combinatorial methods. There isn't a simple closed-form formula to calculate them. However, the first few terms of the sequence are well-established and have been calculated by physicists. The sequence for `a(n)` starts as:\n    *   `a(1) = 1` (for order 2, one-loop diagrams)\n    *   `a(2) = 2` (for order 4, two-loop diagrams)\n    *   `a(3) = 12` (for order 6, three-loop diagrams)\n3.  **Create a Script**: The user asks for `a(3)`. I will write a Python script to provide this value. Since it's a known value from a sequence rather than a result of a simple calculation, the script will store the first few terms of the sequence and then retrieve the value corresponding to `n=3`.\n4.  **Format the Output**: The script will print the answer in the form of an equation, `a(3) = 12`, to satisfy the request to \"output each number in the final equation!\".\n\nHere is the Python code to find the value of `a(3)`.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# The number a(n) of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron self-energy\n# at order 2n in QED is given by a known sequence from physics.\n# We are looking for a(3).\n# The first few terms of this sequence are a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=12, ...\n# The code will look up this value and print it.\n\n# The value of n we are interested in.\nn = 3\n\n# The sequence a(n) does not have a simple formula. We use the known values\n# for n=1, 2, 3, ... which are established in the physics literature.\n# We store the first few terms in a list, where the index corresponds to n-1.\na_sequence = [1, 2, 12, 94, 916]\n\n# Retrieve the value for a(n) where n=3.\n# This corresponds to the element at index 2 in our list.\nvalue_a_n = a_sequence[n-1]\n\n# The final \"equation\" is simply stating the value of a(3).\n# We print each number involved in this statement.\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {value_a_n}\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"
