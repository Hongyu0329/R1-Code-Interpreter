def check_existence_of_tree():
    """
    Analyzes the existence of a specific tree structure in the Boolean algebra P(w1)/<w1.

    The question asks if it's a theorem of ZFC (i.e., it "always" exists)
    that there is a tree T of height omega_1, where each level is a maximal
    antichain in P(omega_1)/<omega_1, levels are refinements of previous levels,
    level cardinality is at most omega_1, and there is no common refinement for all levels.

    This property is known to be independent of the ZFC axioms of set theory.
    - The Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA), which is consistent with ZFC, implies
      that no such tree exists.
    - It is also consistent with ZFC that such a tree does exist (a result of S. Shelah).

    Since the existence of the tree is not provable in ZFC, it does not "always"
    exist. The answer is No.
