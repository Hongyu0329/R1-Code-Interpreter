    "My plan is to solve the definite integral analytically first and then use Python to compute the numerical value.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the integrand form:** The expression to be integrated is `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)`. This is a classic form `u'(x) / u(x)`, where `u(x) = F₃(x)`.\n\n2.  **Find the antiderivative:** The antiderivative of `u'(x) / u(x)` is `ln|u(x)|`. Therefore, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the definite integral:** Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:\n    ∫ [from 0 to 1] (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\n    = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n4.  **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    *   F₀(1) = 1\n    *   F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)\n    *   F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))\n    *   F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n5.  **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    *   F₀(0) = 0\n    *   F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0\n    *   F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1\n    *   F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n6.  **Check the absolute value:** For x in [0, 1], sin(x) is non-negative. Thus, `e^(sin(x)) >= 1`, which means `1 + e^(sin(x)) >= 2`. The natural logarithm `ln(y)` is positive for `y > 1`. Therefore, both F₃(1) and F₃(0) are positive, and the absolute value bars can be removed.\n\n7.  **Final expression for the integral V:**\n    V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n    V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nNow I will write a Python script to calculate this value, `V`, and then find the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the functions to calculate F3(x)\ndef F0(x):\n    return x\n\ndef F1(x):\n    return math.sin(F0(x))\n\ndef F2(x):\n    return math.exp(F1(x))\n\ndef F3(x):\n    return math.log(1 + F2(x))\n\n# The limits of the integration\nx_upper = 1\nx_lower = 0\n\n# Calculate F3 at the upper and lower limits\nf3_at_1 = F3(x_upper)\nf3_at_0 = F3(x_lower)\n\n# The value of the definite integral V is ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\n# This can also be written as ln(F3(1) / F3(0))\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\n# Calculate the final value as requested\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\n\n# Print the final equation with the computed numbers\nprint(f\"The integral V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(f\"V = ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0})\")\nprint(f\"V = {V}\")\nprint(f\"The value to report is the closest integer to 10000 * V.\")\nprint(f\"10000 * {V} = {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {closest_integer}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<{}>>>\".format(closest_integer))\n```"
