    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of binary operations on a set of 3 elements that satisfy two properties: commutativity and associativity. We can solve this computationally by checking every possible commutative operation to see if it's also associative.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Represent the set and operation:** Let the set be S = {0, 1, 2}. A binary operation is a function that takes two elements from S and returns an element from S.\n2.  **Handle Commutativity:** A commutative operation `*` satisfies `x * y = y * x`. This simplifies the problem significantly. Instead of defining the operation for all `3 * 3 = 9` pairs in S x S, we only need to define it for the pairs on and above the main diagonal of the operation table. For n=3, these are the 6 pairs: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2).\n3.  **Count Commutative Operations:** For each of these 6 pairs, the result can be any of the 3 elements in S. Therefore, the total number of distinct commutative operations is 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^6 = 729.\n4.  **Handle Associativity:** An associative operation `*` satisfies `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)` for all `x, y, z` in S.\n5.  **Brute-Force Check:** We will create a program that iterates through all 729 commutative operations. For each one, it will check if the associativity property holds for all `3 * 3 * 3 = 27` possible combinations of `x, y, z`.\n6.  **Count and Output:** The program will keep a count of the operations that satisfy both properties and print the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations\n    on a set of 3 elements by iterating through all possibilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    elements = range(n)\n    associative_commutative_count = 0\n\n    # A commutative binary operation on a set of size n is determined by n*(n+1)/2 values.\n    # For n=3, this is 3*(3+1)/2 = 6 values.
