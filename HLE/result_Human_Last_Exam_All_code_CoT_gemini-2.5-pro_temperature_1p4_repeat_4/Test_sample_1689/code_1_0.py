The patient's clinical history and physical examination strongly suggest a diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), specifically from textiles.

1.  **Analysis of Presentation:** The rash is located on the posterior axillary folds and spares the central axillary vault. This pattern is characteristic of clothing-related dermatitis due to friction, whereas deodorant-related dermatitis typically affects the vault itself.

2.  **Analysis of History:** The patient's new workout regimen involves tight-fitting clothing and increased perspiration. Sweat can leach chemical allergens, such as dyes and finishing resins, from the fabric, leading to an allergic reaction in a sensitized individual.

3.  **Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
    *   **A. Skin biopsy:** Not the initial diagnostic test for a clear-cut case of suspected ACD. It is more invasive and reserved for diagnostically challenging cases.
    *   **B. KOH preparation:** This tests for fungus. While fungal infections can occur in skin folds, the rash distribution makes ACD much more likely.
    *   **C. Topical steroid:** This is a treatment, not a diagnostic step.
    *   **D. Patch test:** This is the gold-standard diagnostic procedure to confirm allergic contact dermatitis and pinpoint the specific causative allergen. Given the strong suspicion for a textile allergy, this is the most logical and definitive next step.

The case description itself confirms that patch testing is the correct pathway by stating: "Patch testing was performed, and positive reactions were observed to resins used in textile manufacturing."
