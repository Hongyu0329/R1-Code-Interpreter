    "This is a fascinating question of counterfactual historical linguistics. Here is my plan to determine the word:\n\n1.  **Identify the origin of the current word:** First, I'll confirm the etymology of our modern word \"sister\" to establish the influence of the Norse language.\n2.  **Find the native Old English word:** I will find the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word for \"sister\" that was in use before the Viking Age.\n3.  **Trace the likely evolution:** By comparing the Old English word to its relatives in other Germanic languages (like Dutch and German) and applying the known rules of English sound change, I can project how the native word would have evolved into Modern English without Norse interference. For example, we know that Old English \"mōdor\" became \"mother\" and \"brōðor\" became \"brother,\" which provides a pattern for the word's ending.\n\nBased on this plan, here is the code that prints the explanation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_alternate_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and determines what the Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    would be without the influence of Old Norse.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Explain the origin of the current word \"sister\"\n    print(\"The modern English word 'sister' comes from the Old Norse word 'systir'.\")\n    print(\"This word was adopted into English during the period of Viking invasions and settlement (the Danelaw) between the 8th and 11th centuries.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the original Old English word\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    print(f\"Before this, the native Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word for sister was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Trace the likely evolution of the Old English word\n    print(\"If the Norse influence had never occurred, 'sweostor' would have evolved naturally according to English sound changes.\")\n    \n    # The ending change is predictable\n    print(\"Just as Old English 'mōdor' became 'mother' and 'brōðor' became 'brother', the '-or' ending of 'sweostor' would have changed to '-er'.\")\n    intermediate_form = \"sweoster\"\n    print(f\"This gives us a hypothetical intermediate form: '{intermediate_form}'.\")\n    \n    # The initial sound change is more complex but can be deduced\n    print(\"\\nThe initial 'sweo-' sound would likely have simplified. We can see a parallel in the related Dutch language, which was not subject to the same Norse influence.\")\n    dutch_cognate = \"zuster\"\n    print(f\"The Dutch word is '{dutch_cognate}'. Following a similar path of simplification, the 'w' sound would likely have been dropped.\")\n    \n    # Final conclusion\n    final_word = \"suster\"\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the most likely Modern English word for 'sister', had the Norse never invaded, would be '{final_word}'.\")\n\n\nfind_alternate_word()\n<<<suster>>>\n```"
