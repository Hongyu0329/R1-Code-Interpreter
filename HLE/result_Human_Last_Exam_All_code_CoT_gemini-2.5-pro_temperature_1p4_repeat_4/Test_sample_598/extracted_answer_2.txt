Yes, there exists a pair of graphs G and G' in srg(n,d,lambda,mu) that do not have the same number of 5-cycles. A well-known example is the class srg(16, 6, 2, 2), which contains two non-isomorphic graphs.
------------------------------
Graph 1: Rook's graph L(K_4,4)
Is it srg(16, 6, 2, 2)? True
Graph 2: Shrikhande graph
Is it srg(16, 6, 2, 2)? True
------------------------------
Counting 5-cycles in each graph...
Number of 5-cycles in Rook's graph: 240
Number of 5-cycles in Shrikhande graph: 192
------------------------------
As you can see, the number of 5-cycles is different, proving that two SRGs with the same parameters do not necessarily have the same number of 5-cycles.
