    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state solution of the given system of differential equations. The steady state occurs at $t \\to +\\infty$, where the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these stationary probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. In the steady state, the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ are all zero.\n\n**Analysis of the system equations:**\n\nFirst, it is important to point out a likely inconsistency in the problem statement. For a valid physical system like this (a continuous-time Markov chain), the total probability must be conserved, meaning the sum $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i(t) = 1$ is constant. Consequently, the sum of its derivatives must be zero: $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i'(t) = 0$.\n\nLet's sum the right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations provided:\nRHS Sum = $(-\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}) + (-\\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}) + (\\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}) + (\\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3})$\nCombining terms, we get:\nRHS Sum = $-2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$\n\nFor the total probability to be conserved, this sum must be zero. Since $\\lambda_{01}=0.019 \\neq 0$, this would require $P_0(t)=0$ for all time. Following this logic through the system leads to all $P_i(t)=0$, which contradicts the condition $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$.\n\nThe most probable cause is a typographical error in the equation for $P_1'(t)$. In standard Kolmogorov-Chepmen systems, a flow from state 0 to 1 contributes positively to $P_1'$. Thus, the term $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ should likely be $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$.\n\nI will proceed by solving the system with this correction.\n\n**Solving the corrected system:**\n\nThe corrected system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities ($p_i$) is:\n1. $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_0 + \\lambda_{10}p_1$\n2. $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_2$\n3. $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_2 - \\lambda_{31}p_3$\n4. $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n\nWe can solve this by expressing $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$:\n*   From (3), using $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$ and $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$, we find $0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_2 = p_3$.\n*   From (2), using $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21}=0.392$, $\\lambda_{23}=0.008$, we have $0.4 p_1 = (0.392+0.008)p_2 \\implies 0.4 p_1 = 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_1=p_2$.\n*   Therefore, $p_1 = p_2 = p_3$.\n*   From (1), we have $\\lambda_{01}p_0 = \\lambda_{10}p_1 \\implies p_0 = (\\lambda_{10}/\\lambda_{01})p_1$.\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition (4):\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$(\\lambda_{10}/\\lambda_{01})p_1 + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$p_1 ( \\lambda_{10}/\\lambda_{01} + 3) = 1$\n\nThis allows us to solve for $p_1$, then $p_0$, and finally compute their sum. The following Python script implements this solution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_stationary_probabilities():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the stationary probabilities P_i(inf) and their sum P0+P1\n    based on the corrected Kolmogorov-Chepmen system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given transition rates\n    lambda_01 = 0.019\n    lambda_10 = 0.65\n    lambda_12 = 0.4\n    lambda_21 = 0.392\n    lambda_23 = 0.008\n    lambda_31 = 0.008\n\n    # In the steady state (t -> +inf), P_i'(t) = 0.
