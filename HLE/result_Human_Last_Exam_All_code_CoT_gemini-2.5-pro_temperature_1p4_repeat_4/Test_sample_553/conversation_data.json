    "The user is asking a music theory question about a specific song by The Beatles.\nThe question is: \"Which song by The Beatles starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord?\"\n\nThis question requires some music theory interpretation.\n1.  **Tonic**: This is the \"home\" chord of a key, represented by the Roman numeral 'I' in a major key or 'i' in a minor key.\n2.  **Fifth chord**: This is the chord built on the fifth degree of the scale. In a major key, this is typically a major chord (the dominant, 'V').\n3.  **\"Minor fifth chord\"**: This is the ambiguous part. It most likely refers to one of two things:\n    *   The chord on the fifth degree is made minor (a 'v' chord). So, in C major, the progression would be C major -> G minor. This is called a \"borrowed chord\" from the parallel minor key.\n    *   The song is in a minor key, and the progression is from the minor tonic ('i') to the major dominant ('V'). In A minor, this would be A minor -> E major.\n\nThe most famous Beatles song that fits this description is \"Michelle\". Let's analyze its start. The song is in the key of F, but it uses mode mixture, freely switching between F major and F minor.\n\nThe very first vocal line, \"Mi-chelle, ma belle,\" is sung over the chords **Fm** and then **C major**.\n\n*   If we consider the song's home key to be F major, the **Fm** is the minor tonic (i), a borrowed chord. The **C major** is the standard dominant (V). The progression is **i -> V**.\n*   This progression involves a jump from a tonic-type chord (Fm) to a chord on the fifth degree (C). One of the chords is minor (the tonic), and the other is major.\n\nThis **i -> V** progression at the start of the vocal melody is very distinctive and is the most likely candidate for what the user is describing as a \"jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord,\" even if the terminology isn't perfectly strict.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that:\n1.  Sets up a small database (a dictionary) of a few Beatles songs and their opening chord progressions.\n2.  Includes \"Michelle\" with the correct analysis.\n3.  Searches this database for the song that matches the user's description.\n4.  Prints the name of the song and a clear explanation of why it matches, including the specific chords involved.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a small database of Beatles songs to find the one\n    matching the user's description of its opening chord progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A small database of Beatles intros for analysis\n    beatles_intros = {\n        \"Michelle\": {\n            \"key\": \"F (with mode mixture)\",\n            \"progression\": [\"Fm\", \"C\"],\n            \"analysis\": (\n                \"Starts its vocal melody with a jump from a minor tonic (i) \"\n                \"to a major dominant (V).
