    "The pattern in the sequence is based on the keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the core pattern in the sequence \"ZXXCVYBN\".\n2.  The letters Z, X, C, V, B, and N are the first six letters on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard, in order.\n3.  The sequence appears to follow this pattern, with an extra 'X' and 'Y' inserted as distractions.\n4.  The main progression is Z -> X -> C -> V -> B -> N.\n5.  The next letter in this progression is the one that comes after 'N' on the bottom row of the keyboard.\n6.  The letter after 'N' is 'M'.\n7.  I will write a Python script to state this logic and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_keyboard_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the next letter in the sequence ZXXCVYBN_.\n    The logic is based on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The bottom letter row on a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n    qwerty_bottom_row = \"ZXCVBNM\"\n    \n    # The core letters of the sequence follow this pattern.\n    # The original sequence is \"ZXXCVYBN\".
