    # Choice A

    print("   - Meaning: The duration of interaction (4-3) is much greater than the duration of feeding (6-5).")
    print("   - Analysis: The insect spends lots of time in non-feeding contact (e.g., walking on the flower). This can be good for pollination.")
    print("   - Verdict: Plausible positive effect.")

    # Choice B
    print("\nB. Pattern: 6-5 >> 4-3")
    print("   - Meaning: The duration of feeding (6-5) is much greater than the duration of interaction (4-3).")
    print("   - Analysis: This is physically impossible, as feeding is a part of the total interaction time.")
    print("   - Verdict: Invalid.")

    # Choice C
    print("\nC. Pattern: 4-3 >> 2-1")
    print("   - Meaning: The duration of interaction (4-3) is much greater than the duration of investigation (2-1).")
    print("   - Analysis: This describes a highly efficient pollinator. It wastes little time flying around and commits to a long period of contact, which is when pollination happens. A long contact time is directly beneficial.")

    # Choice D
    print("\nD. Pattern: n(5)/hour >> n(3)/hour")
    print("   - Meaning: The number of feeding events (n(5)) is much greater than the number of interaction events (n(3)).")

    print("   - Verdict: Invalid.")

    # Choice E
    print("\nE. Pattern: n(1)/hour >> n(3)/hour")
    print("   - Meaning: The number of investigations (n(1)) is much greater than the number of interactions (n(3)).")
    print("   - Analysis: Many insects approach, but few make contact. This means few opportunities for pollination.")

    # Choice F
    print("\nF. Pattern: n(3)/hour >> n(1)/hour")
    print("   - Meaning: The number of interactions (n(3)) is much greater than the number of investigations (n(1)).")

    print("=" * 70)

    print("Step 3: Conclusion.")
    print("  - After eliminating invalid (B, D, F) and negative (E) options, we are left with A and C.")
    print("  - Choice A (4-3 >> 6-5) is plausible but could be ambiguous; long non-feeding contact may or may not be effective.")
    print("  - Choice C (4-3 >> 2-1) is unambiguously positive. It describes a pattern where the time spent on the beneficial activity (interaction, 4-3) is maximized relative to the time spent on the non-beneficial prelude (investigation, 2-1). This signifies a high-quality visit from the plant's perspective.")
