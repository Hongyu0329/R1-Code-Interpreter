# Based on the mathematical simplification explained above, the entire expression simplifies to 2**81.
# The value of p and the complex formula are designed to be simplified away using number theory.

# The final calculation is to compute 2 to the power of 81.
base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result
result = base ** exponent

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# The final simplified equation is 2**81 = result.
