    Solves the problem of minimizing the maximum number of points in a hemisphere.
    
    The problem asks for the result of an optimization: placing N points on a
    d-dimensional hypersphere to minimize the maximum number of points that
    can be found in any single closed hemisphere. Let this value be K.
    
    K = min_P (max_H |P âˆ© H|)
    
    A key result in discrete geometry gives the formula for this value. The logic is:
    1. For any hemisphere H and its opposite H', the number of points they contain follows:
       n(H) + n(H') = N + n_0
       where N is the total number of points and n_0 is the number of points on their
       shared boundary hyperplane.
    
    2. The value K must be at least n(H) and n(H') for any H. Thus:
       2*K >= n(H) + n(H') = N + n_0
    
    3. This inequality must hold for the hemisphere with the most points on its boundary,
       so we must consider the maximum possible n_0 for a given point set P.
       2*K >= N + max(n_0)
    
    4. To minimize K, we must arrange the points P to make max(n_0) as small as possible.
       It is a known result that points can be arranged such that no more than d-1
       points lie on any single hyperplane through the origin. This is the minimum
       possible value for max(n_0).
    
    5. This gives the tight lower bound: K >= (N + d - 1) / 2. This bound is known
       to be achievable, meaning a configuration of points exists that results in this value.

    # an integer or a .5, so ceiling is appropriate for the general case.
