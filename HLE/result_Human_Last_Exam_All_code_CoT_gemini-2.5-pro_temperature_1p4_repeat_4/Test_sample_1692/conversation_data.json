    "This problem requires us to find an intermediate state in a 2-generation evolution of an elementary cellular automaton. This means we need to find a single rule (out of 256 possibilities) that correctly transforms the top row to the intermediate row, and simultaneously transforms that same intermediate row to the bottom row.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  I will iterate through all 256 possible rules for elementary cellular automata.\n2.  For each rule, I will simulate the evolution from the starting row (`01101001`).\n3.  First, I'll apply the rule to the top row to generate a potential intermediate row. For this, I will assume **periodic boundary conditions**, which is a standard convention (the grid wraps around).\n4.  Next, I'll apply the exact same rule to the generated intermediate row to produce a final row.\n5.  I will then compare this computer-generated final row with the given final row (`10000111`).\n6.  If they match, I have found the correct rule and the corresponding unique intermediate row, which is the solution.\n\nThe script below will perform this brute-force search to find the single valid sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 2-generation cellular automaton sequence\n    by testing all 256 possible elementary rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    top_row_str = \"01101001\"\n    bottom_row_str = \"10000111\"\n\n    top_row = [int(c) for c in top_row_str]\n    bottom_row = [int(c) for c in bottom_row_str]\n    n = len(top_row)\n\n    def apply_rule(rule_outputs, row):\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies a given rule to a row using periodic boundary conditions.\n        The rule_outputs list maps neighborhoods 111, 110, ..., 000\n        to the bits of the rule number.\n        \"\"\"\n        new_row = [0] * n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get neighbors with periodic (wrapped) boundaries\n            left = row[(i - 1 + n) % n]\n            center = row[i]\n            right = row[(i + 1) % n]\n\n            # Convert the 3-cell neighborhood to an index from 7 (111) to 0 (000)\n            neighborhood_index = 4 * left + 2 * center + 1 * right\n            \n            # The rule's output for this neighborhood.\n            # Wolfram's convention: bit 0 of rule is for 111, bit 7 is for 000.\n            new_row[i] = rule_outputs[7 - neighborhood_index]\n        return new_row\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible rules\n    for rule_num in range(256):\n        # Get the 8-bit binary representation of the rule\n        rule_bin = format(rule_num, '08b')\n        rule_outputs = [int(b) for b in rule_bin]\n\n        # First generation: top row -> intermediate row\n        intermediate_row = apply_rule(rule_outputs, top_row)\n\n        # Second generation: intermediate row -> bottom row\n        calculated_bottom_row = apply_rule(rule_outputs, intermediate_row)\n\n        # Check if the result matches the given bottom row\n        if calculated_bottom_row == bottom_row:\n            intermediate_row_str = \"\".join(map(str, intermediate_row))\n            print(top_row_str)\n            print(intermediate_row_str)\n            print(bottom_row_str)\n            return\n\n# Run the solver\nsolve_cellular_automaton()\n<<<11011101>>>\n```"
