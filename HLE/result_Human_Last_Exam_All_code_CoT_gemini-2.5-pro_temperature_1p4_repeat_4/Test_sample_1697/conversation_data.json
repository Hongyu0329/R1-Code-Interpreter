    "This is a two-step organic synthesis problem involving a Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Starting Material & Reagents:** The reaction starts with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. It is first treated with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and TMEDA, and then with methyl iodide (CH3I).\n2.  **Step 1: Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM):**\n    *   `sec-BuLi` is a very strong base, capable of deprotonating even weakly acidic C-H bonds on an aromatic ring.\n    *   The reaction is \"directed\" by certain functional groups on the ring that can coordinate to the lithium ion, guiding the deprotonation to the ortho position.\n    *   The starting molecule has two such directing groups: the N,N-diethylamide (`-CONEt2`) at position 1 and the dimethylamino (`-NMe2`) at position 3.\n    *   The amide group (`-CONEt2`) is a much stronger directing group than the amino group (`-NMe2`). Therefore, the deprotonation (lithiation) will occur at the position ortho to the amide.\n    *   The two positions ortho to the amide are C-2 and C-6. The proton at C-2 is more acidic because it is also ortho to the second directing group (`-NMe2`), creating a cooperative effect. Thus, the sec-BuLi selectively removes the proton from the C-2 position.\n    *   The intermediate formed is N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-(dimethylamino)benzamide.\n3.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Quench:**\n    *   The organolithium intermediate is a powerful nucleophile.\n    *   Methyl iodide (`CH3I`) is added as an electrophile. The nucleophilic carbon at the C-2 position attacks the electrophilic methyl group, displacing the iodide ion.\n4.  **Final Product:** A methyl group (`-CH3`) is installed at the C-2 position of the benzene ring. When naming the final compound, substituents on the ring are listed alphabetically. \"Dimethylamino\" comes before \"methyl\".\n\nThe final product is **N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\n```python\n# The chemical reaction involves Directed Ortho Metalation followed by electrophilic quench.\n# Step 1: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide reacts with sec-BuLi/TMEDA.\n# The strong base deprotonates the position ortho to the most powerful directing group (the amide),\n# which is C-2, forming a lithiated intermediate.\n# Step 2: The lithiated intermediate reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH3I).\n# A methyl group is added to the C-2 position.\n\n# The final product name is constructed based on IUPAC nomenclature rules.\nproduct_name = \"N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide\"\n\n# Printing the final answer\nprint(f\"The final compound obtained is: {product_name}\")\n```\n<<<N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide>>>"
