# The chemical reaction involves Directed Ortho Metalation followed by electrophilic quench.
# Step 1: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide reacts with sec-BuLi/TMEDA.
# The strong base deprotonates the position ortho to the most powerful directing group (the amide),
# which is C-2, forming a lithiated intermediate.
# Step 2: The lithiated intermediate reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH3I).
# A methyl group is added to the C-2 position.

# The final product name is constructed based on IUPAC nomenclature rules.
product_name = "N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide"
