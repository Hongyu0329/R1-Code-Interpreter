    Analyzes a legal conflict of interest scenario and determines the correct outcome.
    The scenario involves a law firm (NC LLP) representing a new client (Six Wings)
    against a former client (Advanced Tech), where the firm possesses relevant
    confidential information about the former client, and the former client
    does not consent.

    # Answer choices provided in the problem
    choices = {
        'A': "Norman and NC LLP can continue to represent Six Wings Inc. because the previous litigation matters and the transactional matter are not related.",
        'B': "Norman and NC LLP can continue to represent Six Wings Inc. because NC LLP has put in place appropriate measures to ensure that confidential information shared with Cedric and the litigation group are not shared with Norman and the commercial group.",
        'C': "Norman and NC LLP are not allowed to continue to represent Six Wings Inc. because, although the firm has put in place measures to ensure that confidential client information is not shared between the litigation group and the commercial group, it can be assumed that Norman and Cedric both have access to all of the firm's confidential client information because of their position as Partners of the firm.",
        'D': "Norman and NC LLP are not allowed to continue to represent Six Wings Inc. because, when a conflict exists, the party prejudiced by the conflicted lawyer acting must consent to this lawyer acting for such lawyer to continue representing a party to the matter.",
        'E': "Norman and NC LLP are not allowed to continue to represent Six Wings Inc. because a lawyer is expressly prohibited from representing opposing parties to a dispute regardless of whether consent is granted."
    }

    # Analysis of the core issue
    # 1. NC LLP has a duty of confidentiality to its former client, Advanced Tech.
    # 2. The confidential information it holds (financials, contracts) is directly material to the new matter (the acquisition of Advanced Tech). This creates a substantial risk of prejudice and therefore a conflict of interest.
    # 3. The primary way to resolve such a conflict is to obtain informed consent from the prejudiced former client.
    # 4. The problem explicitly states that Advanced Tech will NOT consent.
    # 5. Therefore, the lack of consent is the dispositive reason NC LLP cannot act.
