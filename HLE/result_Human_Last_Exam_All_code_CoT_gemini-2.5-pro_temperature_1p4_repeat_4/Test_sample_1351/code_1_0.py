# Parameters from the problem
q = 4
e1 = 3
e2 = 2

# Part (a): Is the pair irreducible?
# A (3,2)-stingray duo is not always irreducible.
answer_a = "No"

# Part (b): Which conditions cause reducibility?
# Reducibility for a stingray duo is caused by either U_1 being g2-invariant (U_1 = F_2)
# or U_2 being g1-invariant (U_2 = F_1).
answer_b = "{(2), (3)}"

# Part (c): Calculate the proportion.
# This calculates the proportion of stingray duos that are irreducible.
# The formula is P = ((q^(e1*e2) - 1)^2) / (q^(e1*e2))^2
e1e2 = e1 * e2
q_power_e1e2 = q**e1e2
numerator = (q_power_e1e2 - 1)**2
denominator = q_power_e1e2**2
answer_c = f"{numerator}/{denominator}"

# The prompt requires printing the final answers.
print(f"(a) {answer_a}")
print(f"(b) {answer_b}")
print(f"(c) {answer_c}")
