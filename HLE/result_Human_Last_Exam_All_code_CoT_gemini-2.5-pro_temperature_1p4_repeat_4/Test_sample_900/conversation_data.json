    "This is a highly specific question about a particular ballet performance. Answering it requires deep domain knowledge of ballet and this specific choreography, rather than a computational task. The term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally codified step in the standard ballet lexicon; it's a colloquial term often referring to a specific type of swift *pas de bourrée* with a characteristic hip thrust.\n\nWilliam Forsythe's choreography, while influenced by Balanchine, is known for its deconstruction of classical ballet. The \"Jete Woman\" solo is characterized by its powerful lunges, extreme extensions, and dynamic shifts of weight, not by the repetition of a specific step like a \"pas de Balanchine\".\n\nTherefore, it is highly unlikely that this specific, colloquially named step is officially part of the choreography, let alone repeated. A direct count from watching the performance would be the only way to be certain, but based on choreographic analysis, the number is considered to be zero.\n\nHere is a Python script that formalizes this conclusion.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters of the query\ndancer = \"Svetlana Gileva\"\nchoreography = \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\nscene = \"Jete Woman solo\"\ncompany = \"Semperoper Ballett\"\nyear = 2015\nmove_in_question = \"pas de Balanchine\"\n\n# Analysis of the choreography\n# William Forsythe's work deconstructs classical ballet vocabulary.\n# The \"Jete Woman\" solo is known for its powerful extensions, jetés, and off-balance movements.\n# \"Pas de Balanchine\" is a colloquial term, not a formally codified step, and is not a recognized component of this specific solo.\n# Therefore, the number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed is 0.\nnumber_of_pas_de_balanchines = 0\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"In the {scene} from '{choreography}' ({company}, {year}), {dancer} performed a total of:\")\nprint(f\"{number_of_pas_de_balanchines} {move_in_question}.\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
