    print("1. Polysaccharide Structure:")
    print("   - Monomer: Monosaccharide (a simple sugar, like glucose).")

    print("Summary of Key Structural Differences:")
    print("- Monomers are Different: A simple sugar (monosaccharide) vs. a complex nucleotide.")
    print("- Elemental Composition is Different: Polynucleotides contain Phosphorus and Nitrogen, which are absent in most polysaccharides.")
    print("- Backbone is Different: Polysaccharides have a backbone of sugar units linked by glycosidic bonds. Polynucleotides have an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone linked by phosphodiester bonds.")
