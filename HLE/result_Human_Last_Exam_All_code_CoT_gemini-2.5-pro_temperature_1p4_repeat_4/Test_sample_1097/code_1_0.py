    Step-by-step derivation of the set M:

    1. Fixed-Point Problem Formulation:
    The boundary value problem is u''(x) = exp(u(x)), with u(0) = u(1) = 0.
    This can be transformed into an integral equation u = Tu, where T is the operator:
    (Tu)(x) = ∫[0,1] G(x, s) * exp(u(s)) ds
    The Green's function G(x, s) for u'' with zero boundary conditions is:
    G(x, s) = s(x - 1) if s <= x
    G(x, s) = x(s - 1) if s > x
    An important property is that G(x, s) <= 0 for all x, s in [0, 1].

    2. Defining the Set M:
    Since G(x, s) <= 0 and exp(u(s)) is always positive, any solution u = Tu must be non-positive, i.e., u(x) <= 0.
    This suggests defining M as a set of non-positive continuous functions:
    M = {u ∈ C[0, 1] | -R <= u(x) <= 0} for some constant R > 0.
    This set M is a closed subset of the Banach space C[0, 1] and is therefore a complete metric space.

    3. Verifying T maps M to M (Invariance):
    Let u ∈ M. Then -R <= u(s) <= 0, which implies exp(u(s)) <= exp(0) = 1.
    We already know (Tu)(x) <= 0. For the lower bound:
    |(Tu)(x)| = |∫ G(x, s)exp(u(s)) ds| <= ∫ |G(x, s)| * exp(u(s)) ds <= ∫ |G(x, s)| * 1 ds
    The integral ∫ |G(x, s)| ds evaluates to (x - x^2)/2, which has a maximum value of 1/8 at x = 1/2.
    So, ||Tu||_∞ <= 1/8.
    This means -1/8 <= (Tu)(x) <= 0. For Tu to be in M, we need its range [-1/8, 0] to be within [-R, 0]. This requires R >= 1/8.

    4. Verifying T is a Contraction:
    For any u, v ∈ M, we look at the distance ||Tu - Tv||_∞.
    ||Tu - Tv||_∞ = sup|∫ G(x,s)(exp(u(s)) - exp(v(s))) ds| <= ∫ |G(x,s)| |exp(u(s)) - exp(v(s))| ds
    By the Mean Value Theorem, |exp(u) - exp(v)| = exp(c)|u - v| for c between u and v.
    Since u, v ∈ M, we have u(s) <= 0 and v(s) <= 0, so c <= 0 and exp(c) <= 1.
    Thus, |exp(u(s)) - exp(v(s))| <= 1 * |u(s) - v(s)| <= ||u - v||_∞.
    Putting it together:
    ||Tu - Tv||_∞ <= ||u - v||_∞ * sup(∫ |G(x, s)| ds) = ||u - v||_∞ * (1/8).
    The contraction constant is k = 1/8, which is less than 1. This condition is met for any R > 0.

    5. Conclusion on M:
    To satisfy both invariance (R >= 1/8) and contraction, we can choose any R >= 1/8.
    The smallest and most specific choice is R = 1/8.
