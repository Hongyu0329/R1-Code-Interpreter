    # Step 1: Analyze the "shallow" condition.
    # A shallow expression `e` applies the variable `p` only to arguments `a`
    # that are constructed without using `p`. In this case, `a` can only be
    # built from `x: X`.

    # Step 2: Determine the number of possible arguments for `p`.
    # The argument `a` must have type PPX = (X -> Bool) -> Bool.
    # Such a term `a` is a function `λq. body`, where `body` is a Bool.
    # The body can only be constructed from `x: X` and `q: X -> Bool`.
    # The only primitive boolean term we can form is `q(x)`.
    # Any other boolean term must be a function of `q(x)`.

    # The number of functions from Bool to Bool (`f(q(x))`) determines the
    # number of possible `body` expressions.
    # There are 2^(2^1) = 4 such functions:
    # 1. λb. True  (giving `a₁ = λq. True`)
    # 2. λb. False (giving `a₂ = λq. False`)
    # 3. λb. b     (giving `a₃ = λq. q(x)`)
    # 4. λb. NOT b (giving `a₄ = λq. NOT(q(x))`)

    # Step 3: Characterize the shallow expression `e`.
    # `e` is a boolean function of the results of applying `p` to these 4 possible arguments.
    # e.g., e = f(p(a₁), p(a₂), p(a₃), p(a₄))
    # This means `e` is determined by a boolean function of 4 variables.

    # The number of distinct functions `e` is the number of boolean functions of 4 variables.
