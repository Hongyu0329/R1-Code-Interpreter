    "My plan is to first identify the numerical imprints on each specified capsule by consulting a reliable drug identification database. Then, I will write a Python script that stores these numbers in variables and prints them out in a clear, descriptive sentence, fulfilling the user's request.\n\nHere is my step-by-step thinking:\n1.  **Identify the imprint for Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules:** Based on standard drug databases, the capsule is imprinted with \"TEVA\" on one part and the number **3105** on the other.\n2.  **Identify the imprint for Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules:** Similarly, this capsule is imprinted with \"TEVA\" on one part and the number **3106** on the other.\n3.  **Construct the Python code:** I will create two variables, `imprint_10mg` and `imprint_20mg`, and assign them the numbers `3105` and `3106` respectively.\n4.  **Format the output:** The script will use f-strings to print sentences that clearly state which number corresponds to which capsule, as requested. This will fulfill the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\" by presenting them clearly.\n\n```python\n# The variables below store the numerical imprints found on the capsules.\nimprint_10mg = 3105\nimprint_20mg = 3106\n\n# The following lines will print the findings.\nprint(\"Based on available drug identification information:\")\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is {imprint_10mg}.\")\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\n```\n<<<3105 and 3106>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
