    "My plan is to first address the underlying physics of the user's question. This involves breaking down the requirements for spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and then analyzing whether boron nanosheets meet these requirements.\n\n1.  **SPDC Requirements**: I will explain that SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical phenomenon. The key material property required for such phenomena is a non-zero second-order electric susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  **Symmetry Condition**: I will explain that for a material to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, its crystal lattice must lack a center of inversion (it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  **Boron Nanosheet Structure**: I will research the crystal structure of common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene). The most well-studied phases are β₁₂ and χ₃.\n4.  **Analysis and Conclusion**: I will determine if these crystal structures are centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric. Based on their symmetry, I will conclude whether they are expected to exhibit SPDC.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: As requested, I will present this explanation in the form of a Python script that prints the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef explain_spdc_in_borophene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains whether free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit\n    spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Requirements for Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC) ---\")\n    print(\"SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process where a photon splits into two photons of lower energy.\")\n    print(\"A fundamental requirement for a material to facilitate this process is a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\")\n    print(\"For χ⁽²⁾ to be non-zero, the material's crystal structure must be non-centrosymmetric (i.e., lack a center of inversion).\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Crystal Structure of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene) ---\")\n    print(\"Free-standing boron nanosheets are known to have multiple stable structures (polymorphism).\")\n    print(\"The most commonly synthesized and studied phases, such as the β12 and χ3 phases, have a pmmn space group.\")\n    print(\"A material with the pmmn space group has a crystal structure that is centrosymmetric (it possesses a center of inversion).\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"Since the common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their intrinsic χ⁽²⁾ is zero.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets are NOT expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\")\n    print(\"\\nCaveat: While ideal nanosheets are not expected to show this effect, the introduction of strain, defects, or interactions with a substrate could potentially break the inversion symmetry, making a weak second-order response possible in non-ideal conditions.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    explain_spdc_in_borophene()\n```\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets are generally not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion because their common crystal structures are centrosymmetric.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    When excited by incident light, would free-standing boron nanosheets be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
