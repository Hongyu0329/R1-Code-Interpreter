    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization**: We start by finding the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n2.  **Character Decomposition**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1^{a_1}} \\chi_{p_2^{a_2}} \\cdots \\chi_{p_r^{a_r}}$, where $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is the prime factorization of $N$. In our case, $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$.\n\n3.  **Order of a Character**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$. We are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\n4.  **Constraints on Component Orders**: For the lcm of the orders to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n    a. The order of each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be a divisor of 6.\n    b. The set of orders must contain a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3.\n\n5.  **Counting Choices for Each Component**: We will count the number of valid primitive characters for each prime power factor, ensuring their order divides 6.\n\n    *   **For modulus $4 = 2^2$**: There is exactly one primitive character modulo 4. Its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice. This also guarantees that the lcm of the orders will be a multiple of 2. Number of choices: 1.\n\n    *   **For modulus $9 = 3^2$**: The primitive characters modulo 9 are those whose orders are divisors of $\\phi(9)=6$ but not divisors of $\\phi(3)=2$. This means their orders must be multiples of 3. The possible orders are 3 and 6. Both of these divide 6. The number of characters of order $d$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(d)$.\n        -   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        -   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n        Total choices: $2+2=4$. The choice of any of these characters ensures the lcm of the orders will be a multiple of 3.\n\n    *   **For modulus $7$**: The primitive characters modulo 7 are the non-principal ones. Their orders are divisors of $\\phi(7)=6$, except 1. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6. All of these divide 6.\n        -   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n        -   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        -   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n        Total choices: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n    *   **For modulus $11$**: The primitive characters modulo 11 have orders that are divisors of $\\phi(11)=10$, except 1. The possible orders are 2, 5, and 10. Of these, only 2 divides 6.\n        -   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n        Total choices: 1.\n\n    *   **For modulus $13$**: The primitive characters modulo 13 have orders that are divisors of $\\phi(13)=12$, except 1. The possible orders are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Of these, 2, 3, and 6 divide 6.\n        -   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n        -   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        -   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n        Total choices: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Since the choice for the character for each prime-power factor is independent, the total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component. Any combination of these choices results in an lcm of 6, as the orders are all divisors of 6, and the presence of components for $2^2$ and $3^2$ guarantees the lcm is a multiple of 2 and 3.\n\nThe total number is $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n), which counts the number of\n    positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.\n    This is used to find the number of characters of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given\n    conductor and order by multiplying the number of choices for each\n    component character derived from the prime factorization of the conductor.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order 6.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The prime factorization of N is 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13.\")\n    \n    # Number of choices for the component character modulo 4\n    # There is 1 primitive character mod 4, and its order is 2.
