    "For small $\\epsilon$, the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ is dominated by the region where the denominator is smallest. This occurs near $x=0$, where the term $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$ also approaches zero.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan to derive the analytical approximation:\n1.  **Approximation of the integrand**: For small $x$, the function $g(x)$ is dominated by its term with the lowest power of $x$, which is $9.0x^{5.0}$. Therefore, we can approximate the denominator as $\\epsilon + 9.0x^{5.0}$. The other terms, $5.0x^{6.0}$ and $9.0x^{8.0}$, are higher order and become negligible in this region.\n2.  **Extending the integration limit**: The main contribution to the integral's dependence on $\\epsilon$ comes from the region near $x=0$. The contribution from the rest of the interval (away from $x=0$) is much smaller and nearly independent of $\\epsilon$. Thus, we can extend the upper integration limit from $15.0$ to infinity. This simplifies the calculation without affecting the leading-order behavior of the integral for small $\\epsilon$.\n3.  **Calculating the approximate integral**: The problem is now reduced to calculating the integral $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + 9.0x^{5.0}}$. This integral can be evaluated analytically.\n4.  **Analytical Formula**: By performing a substitution $u^5 = 9.0x^5/\\epsilon$, the integral can be transformed into a standard form related to the Beta function. The result is an analytical formula of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^p$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to compute the constants $C$ and $p$ and presents the final analytical formula.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the analytical approximation for the integral I(e)\n    for small e and prints the derivation and result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters from the integral's denominator\n    # g(x) = c5*x^n + c6*x^d + c8*x^e\n    c5 = 9.0\n    n = 5.0\n    \n    # The approximation for small epsilon is of the form I(e) ≈ C * e^p.\n    # The power p is determined by the dominant term at x=0.\n    # p = 1/n - 1\n    p = 1.0 / n - 1.0\n\n    # The coefficient C is derived from the analytical evaluation of the integral.\n    # C = (integral from 0 to inf of 1/(1+u^n) du) / c5^(1/n)\n    # The standard integral evaluates to (pi/n)/sin(pi/n).\n    integral_val = (np.pi / n) / np.sin(np.pi / n)\n    C = integral_val / (c5**(1.0 / n))\n\n    # Output the final formula with the numbers from the equation.\n    print(\"The analytical approximation for I(e) is derived from the dominant behavior near x=0.\")\n    print(\"The formula has the form: I(e) ≈ C * e^p\")\n    print(\"\\nThe equation for the power 'p' is:\")\n    print(f\"p = 1/{int(n)} - 1 = {p}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe equation for the coefficient 'C' is:\")\n    print(f\"C = (pi/{int(n)}) / (sin(pi/{int(n)}) * ({c5})^(1/{int(n)}))\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nPlugging in the values, the final equation is:\")\n    # Using f-string formatting to display the numbers in the formula\n    print(f\"I(e) ≈ ( (pi/{int(n)}) / (sin(pi/{int(n)}) * {c5}**(1/{int(n)})) ) * e^(1/{int(n)} - 1)\")\n    \n    # Print the evaluated numerical formula\n    print(\"\\nThe evaluated numerical approximation is:\")\n    print(f\"I(e) ≈ {C:.5f} * e^({p})\")\n\nsolve_integral_approximation()\n```\n<<<0.68876>>>"
