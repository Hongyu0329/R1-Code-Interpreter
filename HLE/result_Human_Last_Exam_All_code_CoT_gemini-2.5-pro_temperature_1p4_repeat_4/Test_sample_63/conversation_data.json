    "My thinking process to solve this puzzle is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to decipher the riddle: \"As Kurt Vonnegut noted, this man looks like a porcupine in all the pictures. Name this man in two words that start with the same letter.\"\n2.  I'll break down the clues:\n    *   The \"Kurt Vonnegut\" connection: Vonnegut, in his book *Timequake*, mentioned that 19th-century men with their impressive beards and wild hair (like Johannes Brahms and Karl Marx) looked like porcupines in photographs.\n    *   The physical description: \"looks like a porcupine,\" which implies wild, spiky hair and/or a large beard.\n    *   The name constraint: \"two words that start with the same letter\" (an alliterative name).\n3.  While Vonnegut explicitly named Brahms and Marx, neither has an alliterative name. The riddle is likely pointing to another famous figure from that same era who fits all the criteria.\n4.  I will search for a prominent 19th-century man known for a \"porcupine-like\" appearance (wild hair and beard) and an alliterative name.\n5.  The poet Walt Whitman is a perfect match. He was a 19th-century figure famous for his voluminous, untamed hair and beard, and his name \"Walt Whitman\" begins with two \"W\"s. Vonnegut also admired Whitman, which strengthens the connection.\n6.  The second part of the task is to provide a Python code block that presents the answer and, per the instructions, outputs \"each number in the final equation.\" Since no equation is provided, I will create a logical one based on the answer itselfâ€”by counting the letters in the name. This will satisfy all the user's constraints.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle and presents the answer along with\n    a simple equation as requested by the prompt.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The answer to the riddle based on the clues provided.\n    first_name = \"Walt\"\n    last_name = \"Whitman\"\n    \n    # To satisfy the constraint \"output each number in the final equation!\",\n    # we create an equation based on the length of the names.\n    first_name_length = len(first_name)\n    last_name_length = len(last_name)\n    total_length = first_name_length + last_name_length\n\n    # Print the primary answer\n    print(f\"The man described is: {first_name} {last_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nTo fulfill the request for an equation, here is one based on letter counts:\")\n    \n    # Print the equation, showing each individual number.\n    print(f\"{first_name_length} + {last_name_length} = {total_length}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Walt Whitman>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    As Kurt Vonnegut noted, this man looks like a porcupine in all the pictures.
