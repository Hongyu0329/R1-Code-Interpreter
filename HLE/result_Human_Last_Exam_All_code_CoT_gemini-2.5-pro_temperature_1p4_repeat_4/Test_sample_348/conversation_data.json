    "To find the total welfare, we need to follow these steps:\n1.  **Find the Market Equilibrium:** Determine the equilibrium price (P_e) and quantity (Q_e) by setting the supply and demand equations equal to each other.\n2.  **Define Integration Limits:** The supply function `P = ln(Q³ - 2)` is only defined for `Q³ - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. This will be the lower limit for calculating producer surplus.\n3.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):** Integrate the difference between the demand curve and the equilibrium price, from Q=0 to Q=Q_e.\n4.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):** Integrate the difference between the equilibrium price and the supply curve, from the minimum supply quantity (Q_min = 2^(1/3)) to Q=Q_e.\n5.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Sum the consumer and producer surplus.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `scipy` library to perform these numerical calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_and_print_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the steps to find the total welfare\n    given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions\n    def supply_p(q):\n        # The function is defined for q^3 - 2 > 0.\n        # Handle invalid inputs for the solver and integrator.\n        if isinstance(q, (np.ndarray, list)):\n            q_safe = np.asarray(q)\n            # Create a boolean mask for valid domain\n            valid_mask = q_safe**3 > 2\n            result = np.full_like(q_safe, np.nan)\n            # Calculate only for values within the domain\n            result[valid_mask] = np.log(q_safe[valid_mask]**3 - 2)\n            return result\n        else: # Handle single float/int\n            if q**3 > 2:\n                return np.log(q**3 - 2)\n            else:\n                return np.nan\n\n    def demand_p(q):\n        return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\n    # Step 2: Find the market equilibrium point (Q_e, P_e)\n    # We solve Supply(Q) = Demand(Q), or Supply(Q) - Demand(Q) = 0\n    def equilibrium_equation(q):\n        s_price = supply_p(q)\n        # If solver tries a value outside the domain, s_price will be NaN.\n        # Return a large number to guide the solver away from this region.\n        if np.isnan(s_price):\n            return 1e10\n        return s_price - demand_p(q)\n\n    # Based on plotting or testing values, a good initial guess is between 4 and 5.\n    initial_guess = 4.5\n    q_equilibrium = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess)[0]\n    p_equilibrium = demand_p(q_equilibrium)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate surpluses\n    # The supply function's domain starts at Q_min where Q^3 - 2 = 0\n    q_min_supply = (2)**(1/3)\n\n    # Consumer Surplus (CS) = integral from 0 to Q_e of (Demand(Q) - P_e) dQ\n    cs_integrand = lambda q: demand_p(q) - p_equilibrium\n    consumer_surplus, _ = quad(cs_integrand, 0, q_equilibrium)\n\n    # Producer Surplus (PS) = integral from Q_min_supply to Q_e of (P_e - Supply(Q)) dQ\n    ps_integrand = lambda q: p_equilibrium - supply_p(q)\n    producer_surplus, _ = quad(ps_integrand, q_min_supply, q_equilibrium)\n\n    # Total Welfare (TW) = CS + PS\n    total_welfare = consumer_surplus + producer_surplus\n\n    # Step 4: Print the results and the \"equations\" with numbers\n    print(\"To find the total welfare, we follow these steps:\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
