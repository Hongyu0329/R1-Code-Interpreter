    "For this chess puzzle, my plan is to analyze the position to determine the best move for White.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** The FEN `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1` describes an endgame. White's main asset is the passed pawn on d6, which is one square away from promotion. Black's queen on c5 is very active, preventing the immediate promotion (`...Qc1+`) and putting pressure on White.\n2.  **Evaluate candidate moves:**\n    *   A natural-looking move is `1. Qxc5+`. This forces a queen trade. Black must reply `1... kxc5`. Now the position is `8/3p4/2kP4/p7/P7/8/8/6K1 w - - 1 2`. White's most promising follow-up is `2. d7`. However, Black can respond with `2... Kxd7`, taking the dangerous pawn. The resulting king and pawn endgame (`8/3k4/8/p7/P7/8/8/6K1 w - - 0 3`) is a known theoretical draw if Black plays correctly. The Black king can prevent the White king from making progress. Therefore, `Qxc5+` is not the winning move.\n    *   We need to find a move that doesn't allow Black to simplify into a drawn endgame. Let's look for a move that creates more complex threats.\n    *   The move `1. Qf7` is very powerful. It achieves two things simultaneously:\n        1.  It attacks the Black queen on c5.\n        2.  It attacks the Black pawn on d7.\n3.  **Analyze the consequences of `1. Qf7`:**\n    *   Black is now in a difficult situation. The queen is attacked and must move, but it also needs to keep defending the d7 pawn and guarding the d8 promotion square.\n    *   If Black moves the queen to defend the d7 pawn, the only square is `1... Qc7`.\n    *   After `1. Qf7 Qc7`, White can play `2. Qe8+`. This forces the Black king.\n        *   If `2... Ka6`, White delivers checkmate with `3. Qa8#`.\n        *   If `2... Kb7`, White plays `3. Qxd7`, winning the d7 pawn. The resulting position is completely winning for White, who can now use the passed d-pawn, supported by the queen, to win the game.\n    *   Any other move for the black queen allows White to play `2. d7`, which will lead to the pawn's promotion and a win for White.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The move `1. Qf7` forces a win for White by creating overwhelming threats that Black cannot parry simultaneously. This is a much better option than `Qxc5+`, which only leads to a draw.\n\nTo confirm this analysis and provide the required code, I will use a Python script with the Stockfish chess engine.
