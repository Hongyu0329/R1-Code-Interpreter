    # --- Analysis of Incident 1: Mark and the Pool ---
    # Mark was performing his job for Evergreen Grass Care Ltd.
    # His actions (getting distracted, falling off the mower) were negligent.
    # An employer (Evergreen) is vicariously liable for the negligent acts of its employee (Mark)
    # when the acts are committed within the scope of employment.
    # Therefore, both Mark and Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. are jointly and severally liable for the pool damage.
    # The neighbour's short fence is too remote to be a proximate cause of the accident.
    liability_incident_1 = "Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. and Mark are jointly and severally liable."

    # --- Analysis of Incident 2: Lincoln and the Ferrari ---
    # Lincoln was also performing his job for Evergreen Grass Care Ltd.
    # His action of blowing rocks towards a car was negligent, as the damage was a foreseeable consequence.
    # The fact that the damage was "minimal" does not negate liability, it only affects the amount of damages.
    # As his employer, Evergreen is vicariously liable for Lincoln's negligent act.
    # Therefore, both Lincoln and Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. are jointly and severally liable for the car damage.
    liability_incident_2 = "Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. and Lincoln are jointly and severally liable."

    # --- Conclusion ---
    # The final answer must combine the conclusions for both incidents.
    # Option A is wrong because the neighbours are not liable and Evergreen is liable for Lincoln's actions.
    # Option B is wrong because the parties are not all liable for all the damage collectively; there are two distinct torts.
    # Option C is wrong because it incorrectly absolves Evergreen of liability for Lincoln's actions.
    # Option D is wrong because minimal damage does not negate liability.
    # Option E correctly separates the two incidents and assigns liability for each.
    final_answer = 'E'
