    # Reasoning process
    # 1. The phenotype (short stature, ovarian dysgenesis) is similar to Turner Syndrome.
    # 2. However, the normal 46,XX karyotype rules out classic Turner Syndrome (45,X).
    # 3. This combination of "Turner-like" features with a normal karyotype and cardiovascular
    #    involvement points strongly to Noonan Syndrome, a type of RASopathy.
    # 4. The most common molecular cause for Noonan Syndrome is a mutation in a specific gene.
