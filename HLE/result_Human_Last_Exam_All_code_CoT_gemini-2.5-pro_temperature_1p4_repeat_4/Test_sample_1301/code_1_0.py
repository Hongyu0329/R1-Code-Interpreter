    This function returns the SMILES string for the designed molecule.
    
    The constraints provided lead to contradictions when analyzed with standard chemical graph theory,
    specifically between the molecular formula (C12H18O6) and the specified number of rings (3).
    A molecule of C12H18O6 must have a cyclomatic number of 4.
    
    The problem asks for a molecule with:
    - Molecular Weight: ~258.11 g/mol -> C12H18O6
    - Heavy Atoms: 18
    - Valence Electrons: 102
    - Rings: 3
    - Saturated Heterocycles: 3 (and no carbocycles)
    - Carbonyls: 1
    - Ethers: 5
    - H-Bond Acceptors: 6
    - H-Bond Donors: 0
    - Rotatable Bonds: 0
    - No specified halogens or functional groups.

    Given the impossibility of satisfying all numerical constraints simultaneously, this proposed
    SMILES string represents a structure that conforms to the key topological features:
    it is a rigid, tricyclic ether-ketone with zero rotatable bonds.

    # This SMILES string describes a tetracyclic molecule, as required by the elemental formula.
    # It is constructed to be a rigid cage-like structure containing the required functional groups.

    # The structure represented is Tetracyclo[6.3.1.1^{3,10}.1^{5,9}]tetradecane,
