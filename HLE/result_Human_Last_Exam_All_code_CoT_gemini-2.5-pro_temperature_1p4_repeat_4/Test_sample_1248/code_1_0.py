    # Part (a)
    # The term "symmetric" is not formally defined, and the given conditions are insufficient
    # to prove any form of symmetry for the general expression of x^j . r. The conditions
    # on the action of g are only for the element 1_R, and do not constrain the action on a
    # general element r. It is plausible to construct a counterexample.
    # Therefore, we conclude the statement is not generally true.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b)
    # We need to evaluate the expression for j=2, r=1_R, q=-1.
    # The formula is:
    # x^2 a . 1_R = sum_{k=0 to 2} (-1)^k * q^(-k(k-1)/2) * C(2, k, q^-1) * w^(2-k) * (g^k a . 1_R) * w^k
    # With q=-1, q^-1 = -1.
    # The q-binomial coefficients C(n,k,v) for v=-1 are:
    # C(2,0,-1) = 1
    # C(2,1,-1) = 0
    # C(2,2,-1) = 1
    # The terms in the sum are:
    # k=0: (-1)^0 * (-1)^0 * C(2,0,-1) * w^2 * (a . 1_R) * w^0 = 1 * 1 * 1 * w^2 * (a . 1_R) = w^2 * (a . 1_R)
    # k=1: The coefficient C(2,1,-1) is 0, so the term is 0.
    # k=2: (-1)^2 * (-1)^(-2(1)/2) * C(2,2,-1) * w^0 * (g^2 a . 1_R) * w^2 = 1 * (-1)^-1 * 1 * (g^2 a . 1_R) * w^2 = -1 * (g^2 a . 1_R) * w^2
    # Summing the terms gives the expression for (b).
    # To satisfy the "output each number" requirement, we can write the coefficient -1 explicitly,
    # though it is clear from the minus sign. For better readability, we will use the minus sign.
    answer_b = "w^2 * (a . 1_R) - (g^2 a . 1_R) * w^2"

    # Part (c)
    # We need to evaluate the expression for j=3, r=1_R, with w = x . 1_R in Z(R).
    # Since w is in the center of R, it commutes with any element of R.
    # The term w^(3-k) * (g^k a . 1_R) * w^k becomes (g^k a . 1_R) * w^(3-k) * w^k = (g^k a . 1_R) * w^3.
    # We can factor out w^3 from the sum.
    # The sum becomes: ( sum_{k=0 to 3} (-1)^k * q^(-k(k-1)/2) * C(3, k, q^-1) * (g^k a . 1_R) ) * w^3
    # Let's evaluate the coefficients inside the parenthesis.
    # C(3,k,v) = C(3,3-k,v). C(3,1,v) = C(3,2,v) = 1 + v + v^2. C(3,0,v)=C(3,3,v)=1. Let v=q^-1.
    # k=0: (-1)^0 * q^0 * C(3,0,v) * (a . 1_R) = 1 * (a . 1_R)
    # k=1: (-1)^1 * q^0 * C(3,1,v) * (g a . 1_R) = - (1 + q^-1 + q^-2) * (g a . 1_R)
    # k=2: (-1)^2 * q^-1 * C(3,2,v) * (g^2 a . 1_R) = q^-1 * (1 + q^-1 + q^-2) * (g^2 a . 1_R)
    # k=3: (-1)^3 * q^-3 * C(3,3,v) * (g^3 a . 1_R) = -q^-3 * (g^3 a . 1_R)
    # Combining these gives the expression for (c).
    # We will write out all the numbers (coefficients and powers) clearly.
