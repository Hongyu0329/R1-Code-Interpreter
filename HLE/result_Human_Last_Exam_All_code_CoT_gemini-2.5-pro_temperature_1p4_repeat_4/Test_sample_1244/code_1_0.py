    # --- Part (a) ---
    # Question: Is it true that an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can have farness exactly 2?
    # Reasoning:
    # A fundamental theorem in lattice theory states that an even unimodular lattice of dimension n
    # exists if and only if n is a multiple of 8.
    # Since 12 is not a multiple of 8, no even unimodular lattice of rank 12 exists.
    # Therefore, a non-existent lattice cannot have any properties, including having farness 2.
    answer_a = "No"

    # --- Part (b) ---
    # Question: Suppose L is an odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 with far(L) = 3.
    # Can L have a vector x such that x.x is congruent to 0 mod 6 and x is a 3-primitive vector?
    # Reasoning:
    # The condition far(L) = 3 implies L is in the same genus as Z^14. Lattices in the same genus
    # are locally equivalent, so they tend to represent the same numbers. We check if Z^14 has such a vector.
    # Consider the vector x = e1+e2+e3+e4+e5+e6 in Z^14.
    # The dot product is x.x = 1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6. This is divisible by 6.
    # The vector x is 3-primitive in Z^14 because x/3 = (1/3, ..., 1/3, 0, ...) is not in Z^14.
    # Since the base lattice Z^14 has such a vector, it is plausible for other lattices in its genus
    # to also have one, even if their farness is 3. The condition far(L)=3 does not create a contradiction.
    answer_b = "yes"

    # --- Part (c) ---
    # Question: If an even unimodular lattice L in R^24 has a visible root system of type D_24,
    # what is the smallest d for which L can be a d-neighbor of Z^24?
    # Reasoning:
    # This lattice L is the Niemeier lattice N(D_24), constructed as L = D_24 U (h + D_24), where
    # D_24 is the root lattice and h = (1/2, 1/2, ..., 1/2) is a "glue vector".
    # The farness d is the smallest integer for which L is a d-neighbor of Z^24.
    # This requires a sublattice M = L intersect Z^24 such that [L:M] = d and [Z^24:M] = d.
    # The intersection M = (D_24 U (h + D_24)) intersect Z^24 is D_24, because vectors in the
    # coset h + D_24 have half-integer coordinates and cannot be in Z^24.
    # Now, we compute the indices with respect to M = D_24.
    # 1. The index of D_24 in L is [L : D_24], which is 2 by construction.
    # 2. D_24 is the "checkerboard lattice" {x in Z^24 | sum of coordinates is even}. The index
    #    of D_24 in Z^24 is [Z^24 : D_24], which is 2.
    # The indices match and are equal to 2. Thus, L is a 2-neighbor of Z^24.
    # The farness d is the *smallest* such d. For an even lattice (L) to be a neighbor of an odd
    # lattice (Z^24), the index d must be even. Thus, the smallest possible value for d is 2.
    answer_c = 2
