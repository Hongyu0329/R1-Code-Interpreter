    "Of course. Here is a Python script that analyzes each ballet step and determines the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I will break down the task. My goal is to identify which of the listed classical ballet steps has the same starting and ending leg position.\n\n1.  **Analyze each option:** I need to understand the mechanics of each ballet movement.\n    *   **Entrechat six:** An even-numbered entrechat (like four, six, eight) starts from a closed position (usually fifth) and lands back in the *exact same* closed position. It involves three changes of the feet in the air.\n    *   **Échappé battu changé:** The word *changé* (changed) is key here. The step starts in fifth position and ends in fifth position but with the opposite foot in front.\n    *   **Assemblé:** Means \"to assemble.\" It typically involves moving from one foot to two, and often changes which foot is in front (e.g., *assemblé dessus* moves the back leg to close in front).\n    *   **Glissade derrière:** Means \"glide behind.\" This step ends with the starting front foot closing in the back, changing the position.\n    *   **Gargouillade:** This is a complex decorative step, but it commonly finishes with the opposite foot in front, similar to a *pas de chat*.\n\n2.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Based on the definitions, only the Entrechat six consistently starts and ends in the identical leg position.\n\n3.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script that contains this information. The script will iterate through a description of each step, explain why its start and end positions are the same or different, and then print the final correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one starts and ends\n    in the same leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps_analysis = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'description': 'Starts in fifth position.
