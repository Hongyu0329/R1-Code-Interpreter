    In a finite space:
    1. All subsets are compact.
    2. A set is saturated iff it is open.
    So, the collection of "compact saturated sets" is just the set of open sets.
    
    The dual topology T* is defined with these sets as a closed sub-basis.
    - Let S = open_sets(T).
    - The closed basis for T* is the set of finite unions of sets from S. Since S is a topology, it's already closed under finite unions, so the basis is S itself.
    - The closed sets of T* are arbitrary intersections of sets from the basis S. Since S is a topology, it's closed under finite (and thus arbitrary, as S is finite) intersections. So the closed sets of T* are just S.
    - The open sets of T* are the complements of its closed sets.
    
    Therefore, for a finite space, the open sets of the dual topology are the closed sets of the original topology.
