    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in ϕ⁴ theory, we need to analyze the theory's renormalization group (RG) flow near four dimensions. This is famously done using the epsilon expansion, where we work in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **State the Beta Function:** The RG flow is governed by the beta function, `β(u)`, which describes how the dimensionless coupling `u` changes with energy scale. For ϕ⁴ theory, the one-loop beta function in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions is:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + (3u²)/(16π²) `\n    The `-ϵu` term comes from the engineering dimension of the coupling, and the `u²` term is the leading quantum correction.\n\n2.  **Find the Fixed Point:** A fixed point `u*` is a value of the coupling where the flow stops, meaning `β(u*) = 0`. We need to solve the equation:\n    `-ϵu* + (3(u*)²)/(16π²) = 0`\n\n3.  **Solve the Equation:** This equation has a trivial solution `u* = 0` (the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial solution, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We are interested in the non-trivial solution, which gives the leading-order expression for the coupling in terms of `ϵ`.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform the symbolic calculation. The code will define the beta function, solve for its non-trivial root, and print the resulting expression for `u*` in a structured way that details the numbers in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays the leading order expression for the\n    fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variables for the coupling 'u' and the expansion parameter 'epsilon'\n    u, epsilon = sp.symbols('u epsilon')\n\n    # The one-loop beta function for phi^4 theory in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions\n    # beta(u) = -epsilon*u + (3*u**2)/(16*pi**2)\n    beta_func = -epsilon * u + (3 * u**2) / (16 * sp.pi**2)\n\n    # Fixed points u* are found by solving beta(u) = 0\n    fixed_points = sp.solve(beta_func, u)\n\n    # The solutions include the trivial (Gaussian) fixed point u=0.\n    # We are interested in the non-trivial (Wilson-Fisher) fixed point.\n    u_star_expr = None\n    for fp in fixed_points:\n        if fp != 0:\n            u_star_expr = fp\n            break\n\n    print(\"The fixed point coupling u* is the non-trivial solution to β(u*) = 0.\")\n    print(\"The expression for u* is proportional to epsilon: u* = C * epsilon.\")\n    print(\"\\nBelow are the components of the final equation for u*:\")\n\n    # Extract the numerical components of the expression u* = (16 * pi**2 / 3) * epsilon\n    numerator_val = 16\n    power_of_pi = 2\n    denominator_val = 3\n\n    print(f\"u* = (numerator * pi ** power_of_pi / denominator) * epsilon\")\n    print(f\"numerator = {numerator_val}\")\n    print(f\"power_of_pi = {power_of_pi}\")\n    print(f\"denominator = {denominator_val}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThus, the final equation for the fixed point coupling u* is:\")\n\n    # Use sympy's pretty printing for a clean mathematical representation\n    u_star_symbol = sp.Symbol('u^*')\n    final_equation = sp.Eq(u_star_symbol, u_star_expr)\n    sp.pprint(final_equation, use_unicode=True)\n\n    # For context, also print the approximate numerical value of the coefficient\n    coefficient_val = float(u_star_expr / epsilon)\n    print(f\"\\nThe numerical coefficient C = 16 * π² / 3 is approximately {coefficient_val:.4f}.\")\n\n\nfind_fixed_point_coupling()\n```\n<<<(16 * pi**2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
