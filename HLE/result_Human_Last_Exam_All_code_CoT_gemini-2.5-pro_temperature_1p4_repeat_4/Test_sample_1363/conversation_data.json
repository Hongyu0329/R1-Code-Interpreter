    "To solve this problem, I will first analyze the technical requirements of the reverse turn in each of the listed ballroom dances. The key is to identify which dance has such a strict and unique technique that overturning this specific figure is not possible without fundamentally violating its core principles.\n\n1.  **Analyze the dances:**\n    *   **Waltz (Viennese & English), Slow Foxtrot, Quickstep:** These are all \"swing\" dances. They use principles of swing, sway, and continuous body motion (CBM). While each has a standard amount of turn for a reverse turn, the technique allows for modification. Overturning is a common variation used in choreography and does not necessarily break the fundamental technique of swing and flow.\n    *   **European Tango:** This dance is unique among the five. It is not a swing dance. Its technique is characterized by staccato movements, no rise and fall, a compact hold, and specific, sharp head actions. The reverse turn in Tango has a very precise construction (e.g., Man stepping Outside Partner on step 2, a specific 'Promenade' alignment on step 3, and a 'Tango Close' finish). Attempting to turn more than the prescribed amount would disrupt the staccato action, break the required body alignments between partners, and destroy the sharp, clipped timing that defines Tango. It would cease to be a \"Tango Reverse Turn\" in its technical essence.\n\n2.  **Conclusion:** The rigid, non-swinging, staccato technique of the European Tango makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.\n\n3.  **Code Plan:** I will write a Python script to formalize this conclusion. I will assign a \"technical rigidity score\" to overturning a reverse turn in each dance, where a higher score means it's more difficult or impossible. The script will then identify and print the dance with the highest score. I will also construct a \"final equation\" by printing a comparison of these scores to satisfy the prompt's requirements.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_dance_technique_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballroom dance techniques to answer a multiple-choice question.\n\n    The question asks in which dance it's impossible to overturn a reverse turn\n    without disregarding the technique.\n\n    The script models this by assigning a \"technical rigidity score\" to each dance\n    for this specific figure. A higher score indicates that overturning the figure\n    is more likely to violate its fundamental technique. European Tango is known\n    for its staccato action and rigid structure, which does not allow for the\n    continuous flow needed to overturn a figure like in swing dances.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the choices and their associated dances\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrott',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    # Assign a qualitative \"technical rigidity score\" for overturning a reverse turn.\n    # Higher score = more rigid technique, making overturning impossible.\n    # Tango's score is highest due to its unique staccato, non-swing technique.\n    rigidity_scores = {\n        'Viennese Waltz': 4,\n        'English Waltz': 3,\n        'European Tango': 10,  # The technique is fundamentally broken by overturning.\n        'Slow Foxtrott': 2,\n        'Quickstep': 3\n    }\n\n    # Find the dance with the highest rigidity score\n    highest_rigidity_dance = max(rigidity_scores, key=rigidity_scores.get)\n    max_score = rigidity_scores[highest_rigidity_dance]\n\n    # Find the corresponding letter for the answer\n    answer_letter = [letter for letter, dance in choices.items() if dance == highest_rigidity_dance][0]\n\n    # Create a sorted list of scores for the \"final equation\"\n    sorted_scores = sorted(rigidity_scores.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Print the \"final equation\" showing all numbers\n    equation_parts = [f\"{score} ({dance})\" for dance, score in sorted_scores]\n    print(\"Final Equation (Comparison of Technical Rigidity Scores):\")\n    print(\" > \".join(equation_parts))\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is the {highest_rigidity_dance}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to answer choice {answer_letter}.\")\n\nsolve_dance_technique_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
