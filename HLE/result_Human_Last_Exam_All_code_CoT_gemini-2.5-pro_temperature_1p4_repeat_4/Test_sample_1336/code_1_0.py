    # This number corresponds to the order of the center of the covering group G = SL(2, p).
    # The relationship between the groups is PSL(2, p) = SL(2, p) / Z(SL(2, p)).
    # The order of the center |Z(SL(2, p))| is given by the number of solutions to
    # the equation lambda^2 = 1 in the field F_p.

    # Since the problem states p > 5, p is an odd prime.
    
    # Therefore, the order of the center is 2.
    # This can also be expressed with the general formula |Z(SL(n, q))| = gcd(n, q-1).
