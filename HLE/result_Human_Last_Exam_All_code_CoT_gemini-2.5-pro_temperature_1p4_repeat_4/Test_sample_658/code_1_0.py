  Provides the asymptotic formula for d_{B,delta}.
  
  The asymptotic value d_{B,delta} is denoted by A(B, L), where L = log(delta^{-1}).
  The analysis is split into two main regimes for the relationship between B and L.

  1.  For high precision L over a relatively small interval B (L >> B),
      the degree d behaves like L / log(L). This is derived from the
      Taylor series approximation error.

  2.  For a large interval B relative to the precision parameter L (B >> L),
      the degree d is constrained by the length of the interval and
      behaves like B.

  Combining these two regimes, the overall asymptotic behavior can be represented
  as the sum of the two terms, which is equivalent to their maximum in
  Theta notation.
