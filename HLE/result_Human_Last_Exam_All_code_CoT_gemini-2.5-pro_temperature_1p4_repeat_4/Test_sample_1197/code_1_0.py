    Analyzes the provided options to determine which aspect of genome architecture
    most challenges predictive models of genetic drift.

    Genetic drift is a random process. Its predictive models are most challenged by
    strong, non-random evolutionary forces. Adaptive evolution (positive selection)
    is such a force. It can cause nonsynonymous substitutions to accumulate at a
    rate that far exceeds the predictions of neutral models based on drift.

    Therefore, the increased variability in nonsynonymous sites due to adaptive
    evolution is the most direct challenge.
