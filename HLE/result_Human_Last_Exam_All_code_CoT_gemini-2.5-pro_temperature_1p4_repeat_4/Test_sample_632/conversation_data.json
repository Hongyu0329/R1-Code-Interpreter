    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the answer and present it.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the historical context of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome, focusing on significant changes that occurred around the mid-20th century. My research will look for architectural or infrastructural elements that were present before 1950 but were subsequently removed. I will specifically search for records or images documenting the removal of a prominent feature from the square. Once I have identified this feature, I will write a Python script to present the information clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_puzzle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides information about a feature removed from\n  Rome's Piazza della Rotonda around 1950.\n  \"\"\"\n  location = \"Piazza della Rotonda\"\n  removed_feature = \"A tram line\"\n  year_of_removal = 1950\n\n  print(f\"The unique feature that existed in the {location} until it was removed around the year {year_of_removal} was: {removed_feature}.\")\n  print(\"\\nHistorical context:\")\n  print(\"A tram line, complete with tracks and overhead electrical wires, ran directly through the square.\")\n  print(\"This created a stark visual contrast between the ancient Pantheon, the Renaissance fountain, and modern public transport.\")\n  print(\"The lines were removed in the post-war era as Rome began to dismantle parts of its tram network.\")\n\nsolve_historical_puzzle()\n```\n<<<A tram line>>>"
