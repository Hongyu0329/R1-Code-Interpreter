# The question is whether a certain type of bounding function `g` must exist.
# The answer from set theory is NO. The existence of such a function is not
# provable from the standard axioms of mathematics (ZFC).
# A formal proof requires advanced set theory, but we can use code to demonstrate
# why the most straightforward approach to building such a function fails.
