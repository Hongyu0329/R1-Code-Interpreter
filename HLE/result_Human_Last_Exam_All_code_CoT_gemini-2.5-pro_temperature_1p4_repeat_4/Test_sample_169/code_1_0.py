    1.  **Understanding the Core Principle:** The question centers on the "information arms-race" between plants and their enemies (herbivores, pathogens, parasites) along a latitudinal gradient. A well-established ecological pattern, the Latitudinal Diversity Gradient (LDG), states that species richness and the intensity of biotic interactions are highest in the tropics (low latitudes) and decrease towards the poles (high latitudes).

    2.  **Effect on α-diversity (within a single plant):**
        *   At low latitudes (e.g., the equator), an individual plant is exposed to a much larger and more specialized array of enemies than a plant at high latitudes (e.g., 60°N).
        *   To survive this intense pressure from many different attackers, the plant must evolve a more complex and diverse chemical defense system. This means producing a wider variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
        *   Therefore, as latitude *decreases* (moving from 60°N to 0°), the VOC diversity *within* an individual plant (α-diversity) is expected to *increase*. This establishes a **negative** relationship between latitude and α-diversity.

    3.  **Effect on β-diversity (among plants at a site):**
        *   At a given site in the tropics, high biotic pressure also acts on the plant population as a whole. If all plants had an identical VOC profile, a specialized enemy that 'cracks' this chemical code could devastate the entire population.
        *   Natural selection therefore favors high chemical variability *among* individuals within the population. This chemical dissimilarity (high β-diversity) makes it much harder for any single enemy to adapt and thrive.
        *   This selective pressure for variation is weaker at high latitudes where there are fewer specialized enemies.
        *   Therefore, as latitude *decreases*, the VOC diversity *among* plants at a site (β-diversity) is also expected to *increase*. This establishes a **negative** relationship between latitude and β-diversity.

    4.  **Conclusion:**
        *   Effect of Latitude on α-diversity: Negative
        *   Effect of Latitude on β-diversity: Negative
