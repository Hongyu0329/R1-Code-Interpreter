    # x = sum(l_i * a_i^2), y = sum(l_i * a_i * b_i), z = sum(l_i * b_i^2).

    # The relation z = x^2, i.e., sum(l_i*b_i^2) = (sum(l_i*a_i^2))^2, imposes a very strong constraint.
    # By Jensen's inequality, (E[X])^2 <= E[X^2].

    # This inequality is not guaranteed for all vectors. For v=(1,2), a^2=1, b^2=4, a^4=1. 4 is not <= 1.
    # While a specific combination of vectors might satisfy the inequality, the fact that x = pi is not a rational number, let alone an integer square, suggests that D cannot be formed by such a combination. Proving this rigorously is complex and relies on number theory (properties of pi), but it's a very strong indicator that D is not in P.
