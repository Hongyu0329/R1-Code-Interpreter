    # Part (a): If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
    # As explained, the quasiprimitivity of G on the face set F implies its socle N
    # is transitive on F. A transitive action has one orbit, so D_N has one face
    # and is unicellular.

    # group of D if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.

    # groups in this construction.

    # As explained, the condition for this construction is that the simple group T
    # is (l-1)-generated. Since T is 2-generated, this requires l-1 >= 2, so l >= 3.
