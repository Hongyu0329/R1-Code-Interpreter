    # Option A: Ontario Court of Appeal
    print("\n[A] Ontario Court of Appeal:")
    print("   - Function: Hears appeals from lower court decisions.")
    print("   - Assessment: Incorrect. Litigation is not initiated in an appellate court.")

    # Option B: Commercial List
    print("\n[B] Commercial List:")
    print("   - Function: A specialized branch of the Superior Court for complex commercial cases.")
    print("   - Assessment: A strong candidate. It is designed for this type of complex dispute and is known for its efficiency and speed, matching the primary goal.")

    # Option C: Superior Court of Justice
    print("\n[C] Superior Court of Justice:")
    print("   - Function: A court of general jurisdiction that could hear the case.")
    print("   - Assessment: A possible choice, but the 'Commercial List' is a specialized, faster stream within this court. Therefore, the Commercial List is a *better* choice.")

    # Option D: Small Claims Court
    print("\n[D] Small Claims Court:")
    print("   - Function: Hears cases with a low monetary value (e.g., up to $35,000 in Ontario).")
    print("   - Assessment: Incorrect. The value of six commercial properties is far beyond this court's limit.")

    # Option E: Federal Court of Canada
    print("\n[E] Federal Court of Canada:")
    print("   - Function: Hears cases on specific federal matters (e.g., copyright, maritime law).")
    print("   - Assessment: Incorrect. This is a private commercial dispute governed by provincial law, which is outside the Federal Court's jurisdiction.")

    # Final conclusion
    print("\n----------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The dispute is complex, high-value, and requires a speedy resolution. The Commercial List is specifically designed to handle such cases efficiently.")
    print("Therefore, the best available choice of litigation forum is the Commercial List.")
