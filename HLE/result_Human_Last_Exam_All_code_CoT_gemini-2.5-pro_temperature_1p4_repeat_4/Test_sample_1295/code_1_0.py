    """
    This function generates the SMILES string for a molecule that best fits the
    complex and partially contradictory set of constraints provided.

    The chosen structure is based on the following deductions:
    - Molecular Formula: C8H18N6 (derived from MW, heavy atom count, and valence electron count).
    - Degree of Unsaturation: 3 (from formula), satisfied by 1 azo (N=N) and 2 amidine (C=N) groups.
    - Hydrogen Bond Donors: 4 (satisfied by 4 N-H bonds).
    - Key Functional Groups: Contains 1 azo group and 2 amidine groups as required.

    The proposed structure is:
    CH3-NH-C(=NH)-CH2-CH2-N=N-CH2-CH2-C(=NH)-NH-CH3

    This structure satisfies the key chemical composition and functional group requirements.
    However, it does not strictly meet the requirements for the distribution of amine types
    (2 primary, 2 secondary, 2 tertiary) or the rotatable bond count (4), as these
    constraints appear to be mutually exclusive with the others. This solution represents
    the most chemically sound molecule under the given conditions.
