    "My plan is to provide the formula for the fermionic partition function Z using the path integral formalism in the imaginary time representation. I will break down the formula into its constituent parts and explain each one. Finally, I will use a Python script to print the complete formula in a clear, formatted way, ensuring each term is defined as requested.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the formula's components:\n\n*   **Z**: The partition function, which contains all the thermodynamic information about the system.\n*   **∫ Dψ̄ Dψ**: This represents the functional or path integral. It means we sum (integrate) over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields `ψ` and `ψ̄` throughout spacetime. These fields are represented by anti-commuting Grassmann numbers.\n*   **e^(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])**: This is the statistical weight of each field configuration. Configurations that minimize the action `S_E` contribute the most to the path integral.\n*   **S_E[ψ̄, ψ]**: This is the Euclidean action of the system, which is derived from the system's Lagrangian density. It is an integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density `L_E` over imaginary time `τ` (from 0 to `β`) and all spatial dimensions `x`.\n*   **Boundary Conditions**: A crucial part of the definition is that the fermionic fields must obey anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction: `ψ(x, τ + β) = -ψ(x, τ)`. This arises from the fermionic statistics and the trace operation in the definition of `Z`.\n\nThe Python code below will print these components and then assemble them into the final formula.\n\n```python\ndef print_fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the fermionic partition function\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation is constructed from the following components:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    # --- Define and print each component ---\n    \n    z_term = \"Z\"\n    integral_term = \"∫ Dψ̄ Dψ\"\n    exp_term = \"e^(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])\"\n    \n    print(f\"1.
