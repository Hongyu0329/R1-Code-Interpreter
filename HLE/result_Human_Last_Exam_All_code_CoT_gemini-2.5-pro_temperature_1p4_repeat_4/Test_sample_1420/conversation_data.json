    "In the context of the renormalization group, we can calculate the critical exponent α for the specific heat using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. This method works by performing a perturbative expansion around the upper critical dimension, `d_c`.\n\nHere is the plan to calculate the exponent:\n1.  **Identify the Upper Critical Dimension (`d_c`)**: For the O(n) model (which includes the Ising model as the case n=1), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. Above this dimension, the mean-field theory exponents are correct.\n2.  **Define Epsilon (ϵ)**: The expansion parameter is defined as `ϵ = d_c - d`, where `d` is the spatial dimension of our system. For this problem, `d=3`.\n3.  **Use the ϵ-Expansion Formula for α**: The leading-order (one-loop) formula for the specific heat exponent `α` in the O(n) model is given by:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Assume a Model (Specify `n`)**: The problem doesn't specify the number of spin components, `n`. The most common and fundamental case is the Ising model, where `n=1`. We will use this value for our calculation.\n5.  **Calculate the Value**: Substitute the values of `n=1` and `ϵ=1` into the formula to find the numerical value for `α`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the one-loop epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define parameters\n    d = 3  # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = 4  # Upper critical dimension\n    epsilon = d_c - d  # Epsilon parameter\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Use the formula for the Ising model (n=1)\n    n = 1  # Number of spin components for the Ising model\n\n    # Use sympy for a fractional representation\n    n_sym = sympy.Integer(n)\n    epsilon_sym = sympy.Integer(epsilon)\n\n    # One-loop formula for alpha\n    alpha_formula_num = 4 - n_sym\n    alpha_formula_den = 2 * (n_sym + 8)\n    alpha = (alpha_formula_num / alpha_formula_den) * epsilon_sym\n\n    # Print the explanation and calculation steps\n    print(\"Calculating the specific heat exponent α using the epsilon expansion for d=3.\")\n    print(f\"The upper critical dimension is d_c = {d_c}.\")\n    print(f\"The spatial dimension is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The expansion parameter is ϵ = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe one-loop formula for α is: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\")\n    print(\"Assuming the Ising model, we set n = 1.\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"α = (4 - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {alpha_formula_num} / (2 * {n+8}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {alpha_formula_num} / {alpha_formula_den} * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {alpha} (or approximately {float(alpha):.4f})\")\n\ncalculate_alpha_exponent()\n```\n<<<1/6>>>"
