    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps (morphisms) $L: [m] \\rightarrow [n]$ and $R: [n] \\rightarrow [m]$ that form a Galois connection. This means that for any $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, the following equivalence holds:\n$L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint map $L$ or its right adjoint map $R$. Let's consider the conditions for an order-preserving map to be a left adjoint. A map $L: [m] \\rightarrow [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). For the posets $[k]$, which are finite and total, this means $L$ must preserve the supremum of the empty set, which is the bottom element. The bottom element of $[k]$ is $0$. Thus, $L$ must be an order-preserving map satisfying $L(0) = 0$.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\rightarrow [37]$ such that $L(0) = 0$. Let $m=23$ and $n=37$.\nAn order-preserving map $L$ is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(m)$. The condition is:\n$0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(m) \\le n$.\n\nWe are given the constraint $L(0)=0$. So the sequence we need to count is:\n$L(0)=0$ and $0 \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(m) \\le n$.\nThis means we need to choose the $m$ values for $L(1), \\dots, L(m)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ in a non-decreasing order.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. We are choosing a multiset of size $m$ from a set of $n+1$ elements. The formula for this is given by the multiset coefficient:\n$$ \\binom{(n+1) + m - 1}{m} = \\binom{n+m}{m} $$\nFor our problem, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n$$ \\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the parameters of the problem\n# We are looking for adjunctions from [m] to [n]\nm = 23\nn = 37\n\n# The number of such adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, m).\n# This is because an adjunction corresponds to an order-preserving map L:[m]->[n]\n# with L(0)=0. Such a map is determined by a non-decreasing sequence\n# L(1), ..., L(m) of m numbers chosen from {0, ..., n}.\n# The number of such sequences is C((n+1)+m-1, m) = C(n+m, m).\n\n# The total number in the 'n choose k' formula, C(N, K)\nN = n + m\nK = m\n\n# Calculate the binomial coefficient C(N, K)\nresult = math.comb(N, K)\n\n# Output the explanation and the final equation with all numbers\nprint(f\"The number of internal adjunctions from [{m}] to [{n}] is given by the binomial coefficient C({n} + {m}, {m}).\")\nprint(f\"This is C({N}, {K}).\")\nprint(f\"C({N}, {K}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<249614440039474160>>>"
