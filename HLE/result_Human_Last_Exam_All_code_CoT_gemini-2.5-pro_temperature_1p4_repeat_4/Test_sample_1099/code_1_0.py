# The problem is to find the minimal average resources needed for a
# Local Hidden Variable (LHV) model to simulate the correlations
# from any POVM measurement on a bipartite singlet quantum state.
# The allowed resources are classical communication and non-signaling PR-boxes.

# Step 1: Resource definition
# We define the average communication cost as C_comm (in bits)
# and the average PR-box cost as C_prbox.

# Step 2: Theoretical basis
# According to Neumark's theorem, any POVM can be implemented as a
# projective measurement in a larger Hilbert space. Thus, simulating all POVMs
# is equivalent to simulating all projective measurements.

# Step 3: The key result for communication cost
# A foundational result by Toner and Bacon (PRL 93, 230404 (2003)) shows
# that the minimum classical communication required for an LHV model to perfectly
# simulate the correlations of a singlet state for all projective measurements
# is exactly 1 bit.
C_comm = 1

# Step 4: The key result for PR-box cost
# The simulation model proposed by Toner and Bacon achieves the task using only
# shared randomness (the LHV) and the 1 bit of communication. It does not
# require any PR-boxes. Therefore, the minimal number of PR-boxes required
# is 0.
C_prbox = 0

# Step 5: Final Equation
# We present the result as a sum of the required resources.
# Note that bits and PR-boxes are distinct resource types, but we display
# them this way to satisfy the output format requirement.

print("To simulate the correlations from all POVMs on a singlet state using an LHV model, the minimal average resources required are:")
# The final equation shows the cost for each resource type.
print(f"C_communication (bits) + C_PR_Box (boxes) = {C_comm} + {C_prbox}")

# The result is 1 bit of communication and 0 PR-boxes.
# We extract the numerical values for the final answer format.
final_answer = (C_comm, C_prbox)
