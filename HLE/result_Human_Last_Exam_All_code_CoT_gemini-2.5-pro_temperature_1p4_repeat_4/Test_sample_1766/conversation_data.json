    "To solve for the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron, we first need to identify the relevant quantum numbers.\n\n**1. Identify Quantum Numbers:**\n*   For a **p-electron**, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`.\n*   An **electron** has a spin quantum number of `s = 1/2`.\n\n**2. Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):**\nThe total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, is obtained by coupling the orbital and spin angular momenta. The possible values of `j` range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n*   `j_min = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2`\n*   `j_max = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2`\n*   So, the possible values for `j` are `1/2` and `3/2`.\n\n**3. Determine Magnetic Quantum Number (m_j):**\nFor each value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n\n**4. Find the Eigenvalues:**\nThe operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ have the following effect on a common eigenstate $|j, m_j\\rangle$:\n*   $J^2 |j, m_j\\rangle = \\hbar^2 j(j+1) |j, m_j\\rangle$\n*   $J_z |j, m_j\\rangle = \\hbar m_j |j, m_j\\rangle$\n\nThe eigenvalues are therefore $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$ for $J^2$ and $\\hbar m_j$ for $J_z$.\n\nThe following Python script will calculate and display these eigenvalues for each possible state. For clarity, we will use fractions and show the full eigenvalue equations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers for a p-electron.\n    l = 1  # orbital angular momentum quantum number for a p-orbital\n    s = 0.5  # spin quantum number for an electron\n\n    print(\"Problem: Find the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\")\n    print(f\"A p-electron has orbital quantum number l = {l} and spin s = {s}.\")\n    print(\"The total angular momentum is J = L + S.\")\n    print(\"We are looking for states |j, m_j> that are eigenstates of both J^2 and J_z.\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalue equations are:\")\n    print(\"  J^2 |j, m_j> = j(j+1) hbar^2 |j, m_j>\")\n    print(\"  J_z |j, m_j> = m_j hbar |j, m_j>\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j.\n    # The rule is j = |l-s|, |l-s|+1, ..., l+s\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1.0)\n\n    # Step 3: Loop through each possible j, calculate eigenvalues, and print the results.\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Use fractions for clear output\n        j_frac = Fraction(j).limit_denominator()\n        \n        print(\"-\" * 50)\n        print(f\"For the case with total angular momentum j = {j_frac}:\")\n        \n        # Calculate and print the J^2 eigenvalue\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        j_sq_eig_frac = Fraction(j_squared_eigenvalue).limit_denominator()\n        \n        print(\"\\nEigenvalue for J^2:\")\n        print(f\"  The calculation is j(j+1) = {j_frac}({j_frac} + 1) = {j_sq_eig_frac}.\")\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue equation is: J^2 |j={j_frac}, m_j> = {j_sq_eig_frac} hbar^2 |j={j_frac}, m_j>\")\n        \n        # Determine the possible m_j values for the current j\n        m_j_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1.0)\n        \n        print(\"\\nEigenvalues for J_z:\")\n        # Loop through m_j values and print the eigenvalue equation for each\n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            m_j_frac = Fraction(m_j).limit_denominator()\n            print(f\"  For m_j = {m_j_frac}, the eigenvalue equation is: J_z |j={j_frac}, m_j={m_j_frac}> = {m_j_frac} hbar |j={j_frac}, m_j={m_j_frac}>\")\n\nsolve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n<<<\nFor j=3/2, the eigenvalue of J^2 is 15/4 hbar^2, and the eigenvalues of J_z are 3/2 hbar, 1/2 hbar, -1/2 hbar, and -3/2 hbar.\nFor j=1/2, the eigenvalue of J^2 is 3/4 hbar^2, and the eigenvalues of J_z are 1/2 hbar and -1/2 hbar.\n>>>"
