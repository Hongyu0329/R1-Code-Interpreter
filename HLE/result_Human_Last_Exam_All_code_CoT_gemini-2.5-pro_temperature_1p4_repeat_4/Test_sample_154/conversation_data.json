    "To solve this problem, I will write a Python script that systematically identifies all unique graph structures (nonisomorphic graphs) with 5 vertices and then tests each one for the property of being 2-vertex-connected.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Generate All Labeled Graphs:** I will start by generating every possible simple graph on 5 labeled vertices. The number of vertices is 5, and the number of possible edges is combinations of 5 choose 2, which is 10. This means there are 2^10 = 1024 possible labeled graphs.\n2.  **Find Nonisomorphic Graphs:** Many of the 1024 labeled graphs are structurally identical (isomorphic). To count only the unique structures, I will find a \"canonical representation\" for each graph. All isomorphic graphs will have the same canonical form. By counting the unique canonical forms, I can find the total number of nonisomorphic graphs. For 5 vertices, this number is 34.\n3.  **Check Connectivity:** I will then iterate through these 34 unique graphs.\n4.  **Count 2-Vertex-Connected Graphs:** For each graph, I'll first check if it's connected. If it is, I'll calculate its vertex connectivity. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it remains connected after removing any single vertex. This is equivalent to having a vertex connectivity of at least 2. I will count the number of graphs that satisfy this condition.\n\nThe script will use the `networkx` library for graph manipulation and analysis. It will print the total count of nonisomorphic graphs, the count of connected graphs, and finally, the count of 2-vertex-connected graphs.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport networkx as nx\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_biconnected_graphs(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all nonisomorphic simple graphs on n vertices and counts\n    how many are 2-vertex-connected.\n    \"\"\"\n    all_nodes = range(n)\n    possible_edges = list(itertools.combinations(all_nodes, 2))\n    num_possible_edges = len(possible_edges)\n\n    canonical_forms = set()\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Generate all labeled graphs and find their unique canonical forms.\n    # There are 2^num_possible_edges labeled graphs.\n    for i in range(2**num_possible_edges):\n        G = nx.Graph()\n        G.add_nodes_from(all_nodes)\n        \n        # Construct the graph based on the bits of integer 'i'\n        current_edges = []\n        for j in range(num_possible_edges):\n            if (i >> j) & 1:\n                current_edges.append(possible_edges[j])\n        G.add_edges_from(current_edges)\n\n        # Find the canonical representation of the graph G.\n        # We define the canonical form as the lexicographically smallest\n        # representation of the upper triangle of the adjacency matrix\n        # over all vertex permutations.\n        min_adj_tuple = None\n        \n        for p in itertools.permutations(all_nodes):\n            adj_matrix = nx.to_numpy_array(G, nodelist=p)\n            \n            # Flatten the upper triangle of the matrix into a tuple\n            upper_triangle = []\n            for r in range(n):\n                for c in range(r + 1, n):\n                    upper_triangle.append(int(adj_matrix[r, c]))\n            adj_tuple = tuple(upper_triangle)\n            \n            if min_adj_tuple is None or adj_tuple < min_adj_tuple:\n                min_adj_tuple = adj_tuple\n                \n        canonical_forms.add(min_adj_tuple)\n\n    total_nonisomorphic_graphs = len(canonical_forms)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Iterate through unique graphs and check for connectivity properties.\n    connected_count = 0\n    biconnected_count = 0\n\n    for form in canonical_forms:\n        H = nx.Graph()\n        H.add_nodes_from(all_nodes)\n        \n        # Reconstruct graph from canonical form\n        for i, edge in enumerate(possible_edges):\n            if form[i] == 1:\n                H.add_edge(*edge)\n        \n        # A graph must be connected to have a node connectivity > 0.\n        if not nx.is_connected(H):\n            continue\n        \n        connected_count += 1\n        \n        # A graph must have at least k+1 vertices to be k-connected.\n        # Here n=5, k=2, so 5 > 2.
