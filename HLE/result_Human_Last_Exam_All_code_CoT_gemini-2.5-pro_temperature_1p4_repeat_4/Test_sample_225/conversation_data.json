    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can use a known mathematical result for Lissajous curves.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The curve is a Lissajous curve of the form `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`.\n2.  **Identify parameters:** For this problem, the parameters are `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n3.  **Check conditions:** We check the properties of `a` and `b`.\n    *   `a` and `b` are coprime: `gcd(9, 5) = 1`.\n    *   `a` and `b` are both odd integers.\n4.  **Apply the formula:** For Lissajous curves of this specific form, where `a` and `b` are coprime odd integers, the number of self-intersection points (`N`) is given by the formula:\n    `N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2`\n5.  **Calculate the result:** Substitute the values of `a` and `b` into the formula and compute the number of points.\n6.  **Generate Python code:** Write a Python script to perform and display this calculation.\n\nThe script will define the parameters `a` and `b`, then compute the result step-by-step, printing out the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lissajous_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the Lissajous curve\n    x(t) = cos(at), y(t) = sin(bt) where a and b are odd coprime integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the curve equations x(t) = cos(9t), y(t) = sin(5t)\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    print(f\"The curve is a Lissajous curve defined by x(t) = cos({a}t) and y(t) = sin({b}t).\")\n    print(\"For this type of curve, with 'a' and 'b' being coprime odd integers,\")\n    print(\"the number of self-intersection points can be found with the formula: (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"Given parameters: a = {a}, b = {b}\")\n\n    # Step-by-step calculation\n    a_minus_1 = a - 1\n    b_minus_1 = b - 1\n    product = a_minus_1 * b_minus_1\n    result = product // 2  # Use integer division\n\n    # Print the full equation as requested\n    print(\"The calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2 = {a_minus_1} * {b_minus_1} / 2 = {product} / 2 = {result}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The number of self-intersection points is: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_lissajous_intersections()\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
