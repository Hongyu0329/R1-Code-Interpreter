    "To find the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans*, I will use a publicly available connectome dataset. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Fetch Data**: I will download the chemical synapse connectome data for the adult hermaphrodite (*N2U dataset*) from [wormwiring.org](http://wormwiring.org). This dataset contains information on synaptic connections, including the source neuron, target neuron, and the number of synapses for each connection.\n2.  **Filter for ASJ**: I will filter this data to isolate only the connections that originate from the ASJ neurons (both ASJL and ASJR).\n3.  **Aggregate Synapses**: I will group the filtered connections by their target neuron and sum the number of synapses for each target. This will give me the total number of synapses each downstream neuron receives from the ASJ pair.\n4.  **Identify Main Target**: I will then find the target neuron that has the highest total number of synapses.\n5.  **Present the Result**: I will display the breakdown of synapses from ASJL and ASJR to this main target cell, forming a clear equation, and state the final answer.\n\nI will use the `pandas` library in Python to perform these data manipulation steps efficiently.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\nimport requests\n\ndef find_asj_main_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function downloads the C. elegans connectome data, finds the main\n    synaptic target of the ASJ neurons, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Fetch the connectome data from wormwiring.org\n    url = \"http://wormwiring.org/db/dataset/1/download/N2U_neuron_connections.csv\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n        csv_data = response.content\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to download data: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Use pandas to read the CSV data\n    df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(csv_data.decode('utf-8')))\n    \n    # We are interested in chemical synapses, which are of type 'C'\n    df_chem = df[df['N2U_type'] == 'C'].copy()\n\n    # Step 2: Filter for connections originating from ASJ neurons (ASJL and ASJR)\n    source_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n    asj_projections = df_chem[df_chem['pre'].isin(source_neurons)]\n\n    if asj_projections.empty:\n        print(\"No connections found for ASJ neurons in the dataset.\")\n        return\n        \n    # Step 3: Aggregate synapse counts for each target neuron\n    # We group by the postsynaptic neuron ('post') and sum the synapse weights ('N2U_weight')\n    target_synapse_counts = asj_projections.groupby('post')['N2U_weight'].sum()\n\n    # Step 4: Identify the main target neuron with the maximum number of synapses\n    main_target_neuron = target_synapse_counts.idxmax()\n    total_synapses_to_target = target_synapse_counts.max()\n\n    # Step 5: Get the breakdown from ASJL and ASJR to the main target\n    asjl_to_target_synapses = asj_projections[\n        (asj_projections['pre'] == 'ASJL') & (asj_projections['post'] == main_target_neuron)\n    ]['N2U_weight'].sum()\n\n    asjr_to_target_synapses = asj_projections[\n        (asj_projections['pre'] == 'ASJR') & (asj_projections['post'] == main_target_neuron)\n    ]['N2U_weight'].sum()\n\n    # Print the final result as an equation\n    print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ is {main_target_neuron}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis is based on the total number of chemical synapses received from ASJL and ASJR:\")\n    print(f\"\\nTarget: {main_target_neuron} ({total_synapses_to_target} total synapses)\")\n    print(\"Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{asjl_to_target_synapses} (from ASJL) + {asjr_to_target_synapses} (from ASJR) = {total_synapses_to_target}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_asj_main_target()\n```\n<<<AVG>>>"
