    "Of course. This problem involves predicting the outcome of a chemical reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** The reaction is between 1,3-butadiene (a conjugated diene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (a substituted alkene, the dienophile). This is a classic example of a **Diels-Alder reaction**, a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n2.  **Predict the Product:** The four carbons from butadiene and the two carbons from the ethene derivative will form a cyclohexene ring. The double bond will shift, and the chlorine and fluorine atoms will be substituents on the newly formed ring. The product will be **3,3-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene**.\n3.  **Code Implementation:** I will use the Python library `rdkit`, a powerful toolkit for cheminformatics.\n    *   The reactants will be represented by their SMILES strings.\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction will be defined using a reaction SMARTS pattern.\n    *   The `rdkit` library will run the reaction and generate the product molecule.\n    *   Finally, the code will print the balanced chemical equation, displaying the names of the molecules and the coefficients, satisfying the request to show all numbers in the equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to determine the reaction product.\n\n```python\n# The user needs to have rdkit installed.
