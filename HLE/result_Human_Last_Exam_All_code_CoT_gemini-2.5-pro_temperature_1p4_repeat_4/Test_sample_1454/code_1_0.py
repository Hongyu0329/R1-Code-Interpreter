# The problem can be solved by analyzing the structure of the set D
# which defines the Iterated Function System (IFS).
# The set F is the unique attractor of this IFS.
# D = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2),(0,3),(3,0), (3,1), (3,2),(3,3)}
# The functions are f_d(x) = (x+d)/4.
# We check the connectivity of the IFS. Two functions f_i and f_j are
# connected if their images of the unit square overlap.
# Let's define the images of the unit square for each d in D.
# S_d = f_d([0,1]^2) = [d1/4, (d1+1)/4] x [d2/4, (d2+1)/4].

# Partition D based on the first coordinate.
D_0 = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2),(0,3)}
D_3 = {(3,0), (3,1), (3,2),(3,3)}

# For any d in D_0, the x-interval of S_d is [0, 1/4].
# For any d in D_3, the x-interval of S_d is [3/4, 1].
# There is a gap between 1/4 and 3/4.
# So, no image S_d for d in D_0 can intersect an image S_d' for d' in D_3.
# This means the IFS graph has at least two components.

# Now check connectivity within D_0.
# For d=(0,0), S_(0,0) is [0, 1/4]x[0, 1/4].
# For d=(0,1), S_(0,1) is [0, 1/4]x[1/4, 2/4]. They touch at the line y=1/4.
# The sets S_d for d in D_0 form a connected chain.
# [0, 1/4]x[0,1/4], [0, 1/4]x[1/4,2/4], [0, 1/4]x[2/4,3/4], [0, 1/4]x[3/4,1].
# So all of D_0 belongs to one component of the IFS graph.

# Similarly, for D_3, the images S_d for d in D_3 form a connected chain.
# All of D_3 belongs to another component of the IFS graph.

# The number of connected components of the IFS graph is 2.
# This is the most plausible interpretation of the question that yields a finite number.
# Each component of the graph corresponds to a 'macro-component' of the fractal set F.

num_components = 2
