    "My plan to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n1.  First, I will find the equilibrium points of the system. These are the points $(u, d)$ in the phase plane where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are equal to zero.\n2.  Next, I will classify these equilibrium points by linearizing the system. This involves calculating the Jacobian matrix and its eigenvalues at each equilibrium point. This classification helps identify nodes, sources, sinks, and saddle points.\n3.  A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative dynamical behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds associated with saddle points are separatrices. Therefore, the main task is to find any saddle points.\n4.  Once a saddle point is identified, I will determine the equation for its manifolds. This can be achieved by solving the first-order differential equation for the trajectories in the phase plane, which is given by $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$.\n5.  I will look for a simple, exact analytical solution to this trajectory equation that passes through the saddle point. This solution curve will be the separatrix.\n6.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that states the derived equation of the separatrix and then prints each numerical value present in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the separatrix for the given system of differential equations.\n\n    The system is:\n    d'(t) = 2*d(t)**2 + (-3*u(t) + 5*u(t)**2)*d(t) - u(t)*(1-u(t))*u(t)**2\n    u'(t) = (u(t)-1)*u(t)**2\n\n    Our method is as follows:\n    1. Find the equilibrium points of the system (where d'=0 and u'=0).\n    2. Classify the equilibrium points by analyzing the system's Jacobian matrix. We are looking for saddle points.\n    3. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point act as separatrices. We find the equation for one of these manifolds.\n    \n    Step 1: Equilibrium Points\n    From u'(t) = 0, we get u^2(u-1) = 0, which implies u=0 or u=1.\n    - If u=0, the first equation becomes d' = 2d^2 = 0, which implies d=0. So, (0,0) is an equilibrium point.\n    - If u=1, the first equation becomes d' = 2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1) = 0, which implies d=0 or d=-1.\n      So, (1,0) and (1,-1) are equilibrium points.\n\n    Step 2: Classification\n    The Jacobian matrix is J(u,d) = [[3*u**2-2*u, 0], [d*(10*u-3)-3*u**2+4*u**3, 4*d+5*u**2-3*u]].\n    - At (1,0): J = [[1, 0], [1, 2]]. Eigenvalues are 1 and 2. This is an unstable node (a source).\n    - At (1,-1): J = [[1, 0], [-6, -2]]. Eigenvalues are 1 and -2. This is a saddle point.\n    \n    Step 3: Find Manifolds of the Saddle Point (1,-1)\n    The manifolds are trajectories that lead to or away from the saddle point. We look for a function d(u) that describes such a trajectory.\n    The trajectory equation is dd/du = d'/u'.\n    Let's test if a simple polynomial relationship, like d = c*u**2, is a solution.\n    Substituting d = -u**2 into the original system:\n    \n    - The derivative of the proposed solution with respect to time is:\n      d/dt ( -u(t)**2 ) = -2*u(t) * u'(t)\n      Substituting u'(t) = u**2 * (u-1), we get:\n      d'(t) = -2*u * (u**2 * (u-1)) = -2*u**4 + 2*u**3\n      \n    - Now, let's evaluate the right-hand side of the d' equation with d = -u**2:\n      RHS = 2*(-u**2)**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*(-u**2) - u*(1-u)*u**2\n          = 2*u**4 + (3*u**3 - 5*u**4) - (u**3 - u**4)\n          = (2 - 5 + 1)*u**4 + (3 - 1)*u**3\n          = -2*u**4 + 2*u**3\n\n    Since both expressions for d'(t) are identical, d = -u^2 is an exact solution curve (an invariant manifold).\n    This curve passes through u=1, d=-1 (the saddle point) and u=0, d=0.\n    The tangent to this curve at (1,-1) has a slope of d/du(-u^2)|_{u=1} = -2. This matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector of the saddle point.\n    Therefore, the curve d = -u^2 is the unstable manifold of the saddle point and is the separatrix of the system.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The final equation of the separatrix\n    equation_str = \"d = -1 * u**2\"\n    \n    print(\"The equation of the separatrix is:\")\n    print(\"d = -u**2\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nIn the final equation, represented as d = C * u^p, the numbers are:\")\n    # The numbers in the equation d = -1 * u**2 are the coefficient and the exponent.\n    coefficient = -1\n    exponent = 2\n    \n    print(f\"The coefficient C is: {coefficient}\")\n    print(f\"The exponent p is: {exponent}\")\n\nsolve_separatrix()\n<<<d = -u**2>>>"
