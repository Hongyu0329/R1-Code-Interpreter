    "Pavel Milyukov was a prominent Russian politician and historian known for his conservative cultural views. He was a vocal critic of the modernist art movements that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which he saw as decadent, irrational, and imitative of Western European trends. These movements included Symbolism, Futurism, and a particularly influential international style of art and architecture.\n\nThis style, which fits the \"X-Y\" format, was known for its intricate linear designs and flowing curves based on natural forms. Milyukov and other traditionalists viewed it as part of the \"stagnant swamp\" of modern art that lacked the realist and civic-minded character they valued. The term is \"Art-Nouveau\".\n\nThe following Python code will print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the term \"X-Y\" described in the prompt.\n    Pavel Milyukov was a critic of modern art movements.\n    A key art style of his time that fits the \"X-Y\" pattern is Art-Nouveau.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = \"Art\"\n    y = \"Nouveau\"\n    \n    print(f\"Pavel Milyukov, a critic of modernism, denounced certain art movements as a 'stagnant swamp'.\")\n    print(f\"The term 'X-Y' that fits this context and format is {x}-{y}.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Art-Nouveau>>>"
