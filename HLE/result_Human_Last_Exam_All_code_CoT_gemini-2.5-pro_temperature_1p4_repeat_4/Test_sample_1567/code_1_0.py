    This script provides the answer to the controlled random walk problem.
    The problem asks for the maximal number of measures, k, such that for any choice of these measures,
    a controlled random walk in Z^d (d>=3) cannot be guaranteed to return to the origin.
    """

    # This is equivalent to asking for the maximal k for which the walk is always transient.
    # A key theorem by Benjamini and Pemantle (1998) states that for d>=3, a controlled
    # random walk is transient for ANY finite set of k genuinely d-dimensional, mean-zero measures.
    
    # This result holds for k=1, k=2, k=3, and so on for any finite integer k.
    # Therefore, the set of all such k is {1, 2, 3, ...}, which is unbounded.
    
    # The maximal value is thus infinity.
    # There is no equation with numbers in this problem, so we print the symbolic answer.
