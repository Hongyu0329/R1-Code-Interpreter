# The problem is to find the maximum possible number of children given certain visibility rules.
# The set of visible trees is V = {A, B, C, D}.
# The set of hidden trees is H = {E, F}.

# A child at position P cannot see a tree T if another tree X blocks the view.
# This means P, X, and T are collinear, with X on the segment PT.

# For each child P, the conditions are:
# 1. CAN see all trees in V.
# 2. CANNOT see E: There is a tree X in V on the segment PE (order P-X-E).
# 3. CANNOT see F: There is a tree Y in V on the segment PF (order P-Y-F).

# From a geometric standpoint, for all children to see A, B, C, and D, these four
# trees must form the convex hull of all six trees. This forces E and F to be
# inside the convex hull of {A, B, C, D}.
# Let's assume A, B, C, and D form a convex quadrilateral.

# A child's position is determined by the pair of trees from V that block E and F.
# Let's say tree X blocks E and tree Y blocks F. This child lies at the intersection
# of line(X,E) and line(Y,F). For the blocking order to be correct (e.g., P-X-E),
# the child must be located "outside" the line segment XY.

# The maximum number of such unique child locations is determined by the number of ways
# we can choose a pair of blocking trees from the set {A, B, C, D}.

num_visible_trees = 4
num_blockers_needed = 2  # One tree for E, one for F.

# We calculate the number of combinations of choosing 2 items from 4.
max_children = combinations(num_visible_trees, num_blockers_needed)
