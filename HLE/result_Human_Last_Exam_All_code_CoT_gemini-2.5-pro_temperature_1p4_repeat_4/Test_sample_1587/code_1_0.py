    This function solves the puzzle of finding the smallest number of pieces (k)
    a square can be cut into to be reassembled in exactly five distinct ways.

    This is a known problem in recreational mathematics. Solving it computationally
    is infeasible as it would require testing a near-infinite number of dissections.
    The solution relies on established results in the field of tiling puzzles.

    The smallest value of k for which this is possible is 6.
