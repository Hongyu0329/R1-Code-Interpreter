    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the number**: Let $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. Since the exponent is large and negative, $N$ is a very small positive number.\n2.  **Use logarithms**: To find the significant digits of $N$, we can analyze its base-10 logarithm, $\\log_{10}(N)$.\n    $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$.\n3.  **Scientific Notation**: Any positive number $N$ can be written in scientific notation as $M \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le M < 10$ and $k$ is an integer. The number $M$ contains the significant digits of $N$. Our goal is to find the first two digits of $M$.\n4.  **Connecting Logarithm to Scientific Notation**: We have $\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(M \\times 10^k) = \\log_{10}(M) + k$.\n    Since $1 \\le M < 10$, we have $0 \\le \\log_{10}(M) < 1$. So, $\\log_{10}(M)$ is the fractional part (mantissa) of $\\log_{10}(N)$, and $k$ is the integer part (characteristic).\n5.  **Calculate $\\log_{10}(N)$**: Let's calculate $L = 7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$. Then $\\log_{10}(N) = -L$.\n    This calculation requires high precision because $7^{13}$ is a large integer, and we need the fractional part of the result accurately.\n6.  **Find the Mantissa**: $\\log_{10}(N) = -L = -(\\lfloor L \\rfloor + \\{L\\})$, where $\\lfloor L \\rfloor$ is the integer part of $L$ and $\\{L\\}$ is its fractional part ($0 \\le \\{L\\} < 1$).\n    To get the standard form with a positive mantissa, we write:\n    $\\log_{10}(N) = (-\\lfloor L \\rfloor - 1) + (1 - \\{L\\})$.\n    So, the characteristic is $k = -\\lfloor L \\rfloor - 1$ and the mantissa is $f = 1 - \\{L\\}$.\n7.  **Find the Significant Digits**: The significant digits are given by $M = 10^f = 10^{1 - \\{L\\}}$. We need to calculate this value and find its first two digits.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `decimal` library for high-precision arithmetic.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef solve_e_power():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the precision for decimal calculations to be high enough.\n    decimal.getcontext().prec = 100\n\n    print(\"The problem is to find the first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13).\")\n    print(\"Let N = e^(-7^13).
