    This function determines the necessary assumption for the expected information gain
    of a Bayesian agent to approach zero and formats the answer in Conjunctive Normal Form.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The total expected information gain over all time is bounded by the entropy of the agent's initial prior distribution over models: sum(E[KL(P_t+1 || P_t)]) <= H(P_0).
    2. For the sum of non-negative terms on the left to be finite, the term on the right, H(P_0), must be finite.
    3. If the infinite sum is finite, its terms must converge to zero.
    4. Therefore, the assumption that the prior has finite entropy (a) is necessary.
    5. Other options are either not necessary (b, c, d) or are sufficient but not necessary (e).
    6. The proposition 'a' in Conjunctive Normal Form is '[(a)]'.
    """
    # The final answer in the required CNF format.
    # The proposition 'a' is the only necessary assumption.
    # A single proposition 'p' in CNF is represented as '[(p)]'.
    cnf_answer = "[(a)]"
