    "To identify the radical (bushu) of the Japanese character 謄, we first need to break it down into its constituent parts.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the character:** The character 謄 is a \"keisei moji\" (形声文字), a phono-semantic compound character. It is composed of a radical that indicates the meaning and a phonetic component that indicates the sound.\n    *   The left part is 言. This radical relates to speech, words, or language.\n    *   The right part is 滕, which serves as the phonetic component.\n\n2.  **Identify the radical and its name:** The radical is the semantic part, which is 言 on the left. When the 言 radical appears on the left side of a character, it is commonly called \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n\n3.  **Transcribe to Hepburn:** The Hepburn romanization of ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n\nThe following Python script will print the Hepburn name for the radical.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the character 謄 and provides its common name in Hepburn romanization.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character is 謄.\n    # The radical for 謄 is 言 (speech, word).\n    # When this radical appears on the left side of a character, its common name is ごんべん.\n    # The Hepburn romanization for ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n    radical_name = \"Gonben\"\n    print(radical_name)\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
