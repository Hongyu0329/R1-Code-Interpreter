The laboratory made a mistake in believing their Quality Control (QC) evidence because the evidence itself was flawed. The preparation of Batch 3 involved adding the antibiotic chloramphenicol *before* autoclaving at 121 degrees for 25 minutes. Chloramphenicol is heat-labile and was destroyed in the process, leaving the agar without any antibacterial properties. The QC check using Bacillus subtilis 6633 gave an 'expected result' of no growth, which the lab incorrectly interpreted as proof that the antibiotic was effective. In reality, this 'no growth' result was a false negative, likely caused by an error during the QC procedure itself (such as a failure to inoculate the plate). The lab mistakenly trusted this flawed data point, which masked their critical procedural error.
