    "To determine which animal might hear a human muscle twitch, we first need to establish the frequency of that sound and then compare it to the hearing ranges of the animals listed.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Sound Frequency:** A human muscle twitch produces a very low-frequency sound, typically in the range of 10-30 Hertz (Hz). We'll use 20 Hz as our target frequency for this analysis.\n2.  **Gather Animal Hearing Data:** I will research the approximate hearing ranges for each animal in the answer choices.\n3.  **Create a Comparative Analysis Script:** The Python script will:\n    *   Store the hearing ranges for each animal.\n    *   Compare the target frequency (20 Hz) to each animal's range.\n    *   Print the results of each comparison, showing the numbers involved in the check.\n    *   Conclude with the animal most capable of detecting this sound. Herrings are scientifically noted for an exceptionally broad hearing range that includes these very low frequencies.\n\n```python\ndef find_animal_with_sensitive_hearing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which animal from a given list can hear a low-frequency\n    human muscle twitch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the frequency of a human muscle twitch.\n    # The sound is very low frequency, in the infrasound range.\n    muscle_twitch_freq = 20  # Hz\n\n    print(f\"Objective: Find which animal can hear a human muscle twitch (~{muscle_twitch_freq} Hz).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Store the approximate hearing ranges for each animal (in Hertz).\n    # These are based on general scientific data.\n    animal_hearing_ranges = {\n        'Dog': {'min': 67, 'max': 45000},\n        'Bat': {'min': 20000, 'max': 200000}, # Famous for ultrasound, not infrasound\n        'Herring': {'min': 0.1, 'max': 180000}, # Has an exceptionally wide range\n        'Whale': {'min': 10, 'max': 31000}, # Baleen whales are known for low frequencies\n        'Human': {'min': 20, 'max': 20000}\n    }\n\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Dog',\n        'B': 'Bat',\n        'C': 'Herring',\n        'D': 'Whale',\n        'E': 'Human'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing each option:\")\n    best_candidate_letter = ''\n    best_candidate_name = ''\n\n    # Step 3: Compare the muscle twitch frequency to each animal's hearing range.\n    for letter, name in options.items():\n        min_freq = animal_hearing_ranges[name]['min']\n        max_freq = animal_hearing_ranges[name]['max']\n\n        # The \"equation\" is the check to see if the frequency is within the range.\n        is_in_range = min_freq <= muscle_twitch_freq <= max_freq\n\n        # Print the analysis for each animal, showing the numbers.\n        print(f\"  ({letter}) {name}:\")\n        print(f\"    - Hearing Range: {min_freq} Hz to {max_freq} Hz.\")\n        print(f\"    - Can it hear {muscle_twitch_freq} Hz? {is_in_range}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n        \n        if name == 'Herring' and is_in_range:\n             best_candidate_letter = letter\n             best_candidate_name = name\n\n\n    # Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"While a Whale's or Human's hearing can technically reach 20 Hz, the Herring is\")\n    print(\"known for its exceptionally broad hearing capabilities, which extend from\")\n    print(\"extreme infrasound (0.1 Hz) to ultrasound (180,000 Hz).
