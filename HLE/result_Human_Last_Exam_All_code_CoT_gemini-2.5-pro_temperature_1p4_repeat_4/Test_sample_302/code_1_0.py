# The user wants to know which JAGS model is correctly specified.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis:
# 1. The response variable 'y' can be negative because it includes the term 'rnorm(..., continent, .1)'.
#    This eliminates models using 'dpois' or 'dgamma' (Models 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8).
# 2. We are left with Model 1 and Model 6, which both use 'dnorm'.
# 3. The data generation code shows that the 'country' effect is sampled based on the 'continent'
#    (sapply(upper, \(u) m[,u][...])). This is a nested hierarchical structure.
# 4. Model 1 correctly specifies this nested structure, with country-level parameters (alpha.3, beta.3)
#    being drawn from continent-level distributions (alpha.2, beta.2).
# 5. Model 6 specifies separate, non-nested effects for continent (intercept) and country (slope).
#    This does not match the data generation process.
# Therefore, Model 1 is the correctly specified model.
