    Analyzes the topological properties of the set S.

    The problem asks for the number of properties that must always be true for a set S defined based on a function f.

    The function f: R^n -> R^m is locally isometric at every point.
    The set S is the collection of points x where f is a full isometry on a neighborhood of x.

    We analyze each of the seven properties:
    """

    # Property 1: Open
    # A point x is in S if f is an isometry on a ball B(x, e).
    # Any other point y in B(x, e) is also in S because we can find a smaller ball around y contained in B(x, e).
    # So, S contains a neighborhood around each of its points.
    is_open = True

    # Property 2: Closed
    # Counterexample: f(x) = |x| on R. S = R \ {0}, which is not closed.
    is_closed = False

    # Property 3: Connected
    # Counterexample: f(x) = |x| on R. S = R \ {0}, which is not connected.

    # Property 4: Compact
    # Counterexample: f(x) = x on R^n. S = R^n, which is not compact for n>0.
    is_compact = False

    # Property 5: Dense
    # The complement S^c cannot contain an open ball. If it did, f would have to be an isometry
    # on that ball, which would mean the ball is in S, a contradiction.
    # So S^c has an empty interior, meaning S is dense in R^n.
    is_dense = True

    # Property 6: Connected complement
    # Counterexample: A zig-zag function on R can be constructed such that S^c = {-1, 1}, which is not connected.
    has_connected_complement = False

    # Property 7: Trivial first singular homology group
    # The set S^c is a subset of a union of hyperplanes. The connected components of S are the regions
    # bounded by these hyperplanes (or unions of such regions). These regions are convex (or a union of convex sets),
    # and thus are simply connected and have a trivial first homology group H_1.
    # H_1(S) is the direct sum of the H_1 of its components, so it is also trivial.
