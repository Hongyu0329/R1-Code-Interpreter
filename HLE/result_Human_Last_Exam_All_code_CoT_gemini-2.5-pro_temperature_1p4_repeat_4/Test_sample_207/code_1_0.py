# This script explains the fix for the provided C code.

# The instability in the original C code is caused by the line `printf(s, s);`.
# Let's break down why:
# 1. The `process` function writes the byte values 37 and 100 to the memory location of the variable `n`.
#    These bytes correspond to the ASCII characters '%' and 'd'. Because `n` was initialized, the
#    following byte is 0 ('\0'), so the memory at `n` now contains the string "%d".
# 2. The `print` function's argument `s` is a pointer to this string.
# 3. The call `printf(s, s)` becomes `printf("%d", s)`, which attempts to print the memory address
#    of `s` as a decimal integer. This address is not stable across different runs.

# The fix is to add a single character, '*', to make the call `printf(s, *s);`.
# With this change:
# 1. The call becomes `printf("%d", *s)`.
# 2. The `*s` expression dereferences the pointer `s`, retrieving the value of the first byte it points to.
# 3. This value was set to 37 by the `process` function.

# The prompt asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# We interpret this "equation" as the effective `printf` statement.
final_statement = 'printf("%d", 37)'
number_from_process_1 = 37
number_from_process_2 = 100
final_printed_number = 37

print(f"The 'final equation' is the C statement: {final_statement}")
print(f"The numbers used from the process() function to form the format string were: {number_from_process_1}, {number_from_process_2}")
print(f"The number that is actually printed is: {final_printed_number}")
