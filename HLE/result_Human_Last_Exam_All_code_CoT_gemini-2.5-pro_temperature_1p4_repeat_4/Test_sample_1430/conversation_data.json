    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a problem in algebraic geometry. Here is my step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Define the Problem**: We are given a Riemann surface (or smooth complex projective curve) `C` of genus `g=3`. We consider its 15th symmetric power, `X = Sym^15(C)`. The goal is to find the minimum and maximum possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of `X`, denoted `rho(X)`.\n\n2.  **Relate `rho(X)` to the Jacobian of `C`**: The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve, `rho(Sym^d(C))`, is connected to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian, `rho(Jac(C))`. For a curve of genus `g` and a symmetric power of degree `d`, a known theorem states that if `d >= 2g - 1`, then `rho(Sym^d(C)) = rho(Jac(C)) + 1`. In our case, `g=3` and `d=15`. The condition is `15 >= 2*3 - 1`, which is `15 >= 5`, so the formula applies.\n\n3.  **Find Minimum `rho(Jac(C))`**: The problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for `rho(Jac(C))`, where `C` is any genus 3 curve. For a *generic* curve `C` of genus `g >= 2`, its Jacobian `Jac(C)` is a simple abelian variety with endomorphisms only by the integers (`End(Jac(C)) = Z`). In this case, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the theta divisor, and its rank is 1. So, the minimum possible value for `rho(Jac(C))` is 1.\n\n4.  **Find Maximum `rho(Jac(C))`**: The rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g` is bounded by `g^2`, i.e., `rho(A) <= g^2`. For Jacobians, this theoretical maximum can be achieved by certain special curves. For `g=3`, the maximum is `3^2 = 9`. This maximum is attained for curves `C` whose Jacobian `Jac(C)` is isogenous to a product of three elliptic curves with complex multiplication, such as the Fermat quartic curve `x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0`. Thus, the maximum possible value for `rho(Jac(C))` is 9.\n\n5.  **Calculate Final Ranks**: Using the formula from step 2, we can now compute the smallest and largest ranks for `X`:\n    *   Smallest `rho(X)` = (Minimum `rho(Jac(C))`) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Largest `rho(X)` = (Maximum `rho(Jac(C))`) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\nThe following Python script formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem setup ---\n    # C is a genus g Riemann surface\n    g = 3\n    # X is the d-th symmetric power of C\n    d = 15\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the min and max rank of NS(X) for X = Sym^{d}(C), where C is a curve of genus g={g}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Key relationship ---\n    # The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, rho(X), is related to the\n    # rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, rho(Jac(C)).\n    # The formula rho(Sym^d(C)) = rho(Jac(C)) + 1 holds if d >= 2g - 1.\n    condition = 2 * g - 1\n    if d >= condition:\n        print(f\"The condition d >= 2g - 1 is met: {d} >= {condition}.\")\n        print(\"We can use the formula: rank(NS(X)) = rank(NS(Jac(C))) + 1.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The condition d >= 2g - 1 is NOT met: {d} < {condition}.
