    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this task, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to determine the oligomeric state (e.g., dimer, trimer, tetramer) of five given protein sequences which are known to form coiled-coils.\n2.  **Identify the Scientific Principle:** The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core positions of its repeating seven-residue pattern, known as a heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The key positions are `a` and `d`, which are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure.\n3.  **Formulate Prediction Rules based on Sequence Analysis:** I will analyze the residues at the `a` and `d` positions for each sequence to predict its structure.\n    *   **Sequence 1 (`EIAQALKE...`)**: I will check the residues at `a` and `d`. Isoleucine (`I`) at `a` and Leucine (`L`) at `d` is the classic pattern for a parallel **dimer (2)**.\n    *   **Sequence 2 (`EIAALKQE...`)**: This sequence is similar to the first but contains an Asparagine (`N`) at one of the `a` positions. Asparagine in the hydrophobic core is a well-known motif that stabilizes **trimers (3)** through hydrogen bonding between the helices.\n    *   **Sequence 3 (`EIAAIKQE...`)**: This sequence has Isoleucine (`I`) at the `a` positions and Alanine (`A`) at the `d` positions. The packing of a bulky residue (`I`) against a small one (`A`) is a strong indicator of a **tetramer (4)**.\n    *   **Sequence 4 (`EIQKQLKE...`)**: This sequence has a core that is mostly polar, with Glutamine (`Q`) at the `d` position. While unusual, such polar cores are known to be accommodated within **dimers (2)**.\n    *   **Sequence 5 (`EIAQTLKE...`)**: This sequence has a highly irregular core with polar (`Q`), charged (`K`), and bulky hydrophobic (`W`) residues. The presence of the very bulky Tryptophan (`W`) at a `d` position suggests that a **trimer (3)** would be favored to create enough space to accommodate it, as opposed to a dimer.\n4.  **Synthesize and Code:** Based on this analysis, the predicted sequence of oligomeric states is 2, 3, 4, 2, 3. I will write a Python script that implements these rules, analyzes each sequence, and prints the results.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence based on a simplified\n    analysis of residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    a_positions = []\n    d_positions = []\n\n    # Assume standard heptad repeat starting from the first residue\n    # and extract amino acids at positions 'a' (index 0) and 'd' (index 3)\n    for i in range(0, len(sequence), 7):\n        heptad = sequence[i:i+7]\n        if len(heptad) >= 4:\n            a_positions.append(heptad[0])\n            d_positions.append(heptad[3])\n\n    a_counts = collections.Counter(a_positions)\n    d_counts = collections.Counter(d_positions)\n    total_heptads = len(a_positions)\n\n    # Rule 1: N at a core 'a' position strongly promotes trimers.\n    if 'N' in a_positions:\n        return 3, \"Contains 'N' at a core 'a' position, which favors trimers.\"\n\n    # Rule 2: 'I' at 'a' and 'A' at 'd' is characteristic of tetramers.\n    if a_counts.get('I', 0) / total_heptads > 0.8 and d_counts.get('A', 0) / total_heptads > 0.8:\n        return 4, \"Core with 'I' at 'a' and 'A' at 'd' favors tetramers.\"\n\n    # Rule 3: 'I' at 'a' and 'L' at 'd' is the classic dimer signature.\n    if a_counts.get('I', 0) / total_heptads > 0.8 and d_counts.get('L', 0) / total_heptads > 0.8:\n        return 2, \"Core with 'I' at 'a' and 'L' at 'd' strongly favors dimers.\"\n\n    # Rule 4: A mixed, destabilized core with a bulky 'W' can favor a trimer.\n    if 'W' in d_positions and ('K' in d_positions or 'Q' in d_positions):\n        return 3, \"A mixed core with a bulky 'W' at 'd' can be accommodated by a trimer.\"\n\n    # Rule 5: A polar core with 'Q' at 'd' can be accommodated in a dimer.\n    if d_counts.get('Q', 0) / total_heptads > 0.6:\n        return 2, \"A polar core with 'Q' at 'd' is compatible with a dimer.\"\n\n    return \"Unknown\", \"Sequence did not match a clear prediction rule.\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to analyze the sequences and print the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequences = [\n        \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\",\n        \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\",\n        \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\",\n        \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\",\n        \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\",\n    ]\n\n    print(\"--- Oligomeric State Prediction ---\")\n    predictions = []\n    for i, seq in enumerate(sequences):\n        state, reason = predict_oligomeric_state(seq)\n        print(f\"\\nSequence {i+1}: {seq}\")\n        print(f\"Prediction: {state}-mer\")\n        print(f\"Reason: {reason}\")\n        predictions.append(state)\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Result ---\")\n    print(f\"The predicted oligomeric states for the sequences are: {', '.join(map(str, predictions))}\")\n    # The final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"{predictions[0]}, {predictions[1]}, {predictions[2]}, {predictions[3]}, {predictions[4]}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
