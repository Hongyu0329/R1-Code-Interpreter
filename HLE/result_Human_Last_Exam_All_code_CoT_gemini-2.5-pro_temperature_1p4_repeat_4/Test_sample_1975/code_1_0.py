    print("The root R must have a cardinality less than kappa. If |R| = kappa, since kappa is a regular cardinal, R would be unbounded in kappa, so sup(R) = kappa.")

    print("  Pick any alpha in H. For any two beta_1, beta_2 in H with alpha < beta_1 < beta_2, we have alpha in a_{beta_1} and alpha in a_{beta_2}.")

    print("The color being (0,0) means for any alpha < beta in H, beta is not in a_alpha and alpha is not in a_beta.")

    print("If H is a free set, any subset of H is also a free set.")
    print("Since we have a free set of size omega_7, we can form a free set for any infinite cardinal mu <= omega_7 by taking a subset of H.")
    print("So, X = {omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, omega_6, omega_7}.")
