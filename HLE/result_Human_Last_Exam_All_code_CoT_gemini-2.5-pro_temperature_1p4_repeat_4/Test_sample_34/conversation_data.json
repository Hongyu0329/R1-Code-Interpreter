    "In poker, the button (BTN) is the most powerful pre-flop position, allowing a player to profitably play a very wide range of hands. For a 100 big blind (BB) deep cash game, a standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) opening strategy from the button includes raising all suited Jack hands. This is because their ability to make flushes and strong pairs, combined with the positional advantage, makes them profitable raises.\n\nThe suited Jack hands, ranked from strongest to weakest, are JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s. Since all of these are considered standard opens in this scenario, the \"worst\" one you should open is simply the weakest hand in that group. The weakness is determined by the rank of the second card, or \"kicker\". The hand with the lowest kicker is J2s.\n\nThe following Python code identifies and prints this hand.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the worst suited Jack that is a standard open-raise\n    from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game, based on GTO principles.\n    \n    In this scenario, all suited Jacks are profitable opens. The \"worst\" hand\n    is the one with the lowest-ranking kicker card.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the components of the hand\n    main_card = \"J\"\n    \n    # The kickers for suited Jacks in a standard BTN opening range are T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2.\n    # The lowest (and therefore worst) kicker in this set is '2'.\n    kicker_card = \"2\"\n    \n    # 's' denotes that the two cards are of the same suit.\n    hand_type = \"s\"\n    \n    # Combine the components to form the abbreviated hand name.\n    worst_hand = main_card + kicker_card + hand_type\n    \n    print(f\"The components of the worst suited Jack to open are:\")\n    print(f\"Main Card: {main_card}\")\n    print(f\"Kicker Card: {kicker_card}\")\n    print(f\"Hand Type (suited): {hand_type}\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {worst_hand}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
