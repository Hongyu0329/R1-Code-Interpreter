def solve_matrix_model_question():
    """
    This function provides the answers to the theoretical questions about the matrix model.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) Superintegrability for n=3: In the context of matrix models, "superintegrability" is a term
    used for models that are exactly solvable and whose partition function admits a character expansion.
    The definition of Z_{-n}(t) provided in the problem is a character expansion. Such models are
    indeed called superintegrable in the field. Therefore, the property holds for n=3.

    (b) Necessity of W_{-4} for n=4: The generation of the partition function Z_{-n}(t) can be described
    by the action of certain "cut-and-join" operators, denoted here as W_{-n}. The question is whether
    W_{-4} is a fundamental, independent generator. For the class of models related to simple Hurwitz
    numbers, to which Z_{-n}(t) belongs, there is a known recurrence relation that expresses the operator W_{-n}
    in terms of commutators of operators with smaller indices (specifically, W_{n-1}, W_{n-2}, and W_2).
    This relation implies that W_{-4} can be constructed from W_{-3} and W_{-2}, and is therefore not
    a necessary new generator.
