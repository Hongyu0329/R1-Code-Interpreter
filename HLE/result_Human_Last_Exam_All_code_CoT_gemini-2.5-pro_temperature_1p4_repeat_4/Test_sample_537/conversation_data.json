    "My plan to solve this puzzle is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Core Pattern**: The problem consists of four jumbled words. A common pattern in such puzzles is that the decoded words form a sequence. The hint about a \"final equation\" strongly suggests a mathematical relationship between the numbers in the sequence. I'll hypothesize that they form a Fibonacci-like sequence, where a number is the sum of the two preceding it (i.e., `N₃ = N₁ + N₂` and `N₄ = N₂ + N₃`).\n\n2.  **Establish the Decoding Method**: The words appear to be anagrams of English number names, but with extra \"junk\" letters. To handle this, I'll devise a scoring system to find the best-matching number for each jumbled word. A good scoring method would be to see what percentage of the letters from a number's name are present in the jumbled word. This normalization prevents longer number names from having an unfair advantage.\n\n3.  **Automate the Search**: I will write a Python script to automate the search for the correct sequence. The script will:\n    a. Iterate through possible starting pairs of numbers for the sequence (e.g., from 1 to 25).\n    b. For each pair, generate the next two numbers in the Fibonacci-like sequence.\n    c. Calculate the total \"match score\" for how well the four jumbled words match the four number names in the sequence.\n\n4.  **Find the Best Match**: The sequence with the highest total match score is the correct one.\n\n5.  **Provide the Final Answer**: Once the correct sequence `(N₁, N₂, N₃, N₄)` is found, I will decode the last word, which corresponds to `N₄`. As requested, I will present the answer in the form of the final equation that produces this number: `N₂ + N₃ = N₄`.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef num_to_words(n):\n    \"\"\"Converts a number to its English word representation.\"\"\"\n    # A simple dictionary for the numbers needed, to avoid external libraries.\n    d = {\n        0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three', 4: 'four', 5: 'five',\n        6: 'six', 7: 'seven', 8: 'eight', 9: 'nine', 10: 'ten',\n        11: 'eleven', 12: 'twelve', 13: 'thirteen', 14: 'fourteen', 15: 'fifteen',\n        16: 'sixteen', 17: 'seventeen', 18: 'eighteen', 19: 'nineteen', 20: 'twenty',\n        21: 'twentyone', 22: 'twentytwo', 23: 'twentythree', 24: 'twentyfour',\n        25: 'twentyfive', 26: 'twentysix', 27: 'twentyseven', 28: 'twentyeight',\n        29: 'twentynine', 30: 'thirty', 31: 'thirtyone', 32: 'thirtytwo',\n        33: 'thirtythree', 34: 'thirtyfour', 35: 'thirtyfive', 36: 'thirtysix',\n        37: 'thirtyseven', 38: 'thirtyeight', 39: 'thirtynine', 40: 'forty'\n    }\n    # For this puzzle, we only need to represent numbers as a single word.\n    # We remove spaces and hyphens if they were present.\n    return d[n].replace(' ', '').replace('-', '') if n in d else ''\n\ndef calculate_match_score(word, number_as_word):\n    \"\"\"Calculates a normalized score for how well a word matches a number's name.\"\"\"\n    if not number_as_word:\n        return 0\n    word_counts = collections.Counter(word)\n    number_word_counts = collections.Counter(number_as_word)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of common letters\n    common_letters_count = sum((word_counts & number_word_counts).values())\n    \n    # Normalize the score by the length of the number's name\n    return common_letters_count / len(number_as_word)\n\ndef find_best_sequence():\n    \"\"\"Searches for the number sequence that best matches the given words.\"\"\"\n    words = ['utpshtheas', 'fkuhu', 'numhkatnatu', 'anhaeketn']\n    \n    best_score = -1\n    best_sequence = None\n    \n    # Iterate through possible starting numbers for the Fibonacci-like sequence\n    for n1 in range(1, 26):\n        for n2 in range(1, 26):\n            if n1 == n2:\n                continue\n            \n            n3 = n1 + n2\n            n4 = n2 + n3\n            \n            sequence = [n1, n2, n3, n4]\n            number_words = [num_to_words(n) for n in sequence]\n            \n            if any(not s for s in number_words):\n                continue\n                \n            current_total_score = 0\n            for i in range(4):\n                current_total_score += calculate_match_score(words[i], number_words[i])\n            \n            if current_total_score > best_score:\n                best_score = current_total_score\n                best_sequence = sequence\n                \n    return best_sequence\n\n# Find the sequence and print the final result\nfinal_sequence = find_best_sequence()\n\nif final_sequence:\n    n2, n3, n4 = final_sequence[1], final_sequence[2], final_sequence[3]\n    # The last word 'anhaeketn' decodes to the last number in the sequence.\n    # The puzzle asks for the final equation.\n    print(f\"The decoded last word is {n4}.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{n2} + {n3} = {n4}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Could not find a matching sequence.\")\n\n```\n<<<18>>>"
