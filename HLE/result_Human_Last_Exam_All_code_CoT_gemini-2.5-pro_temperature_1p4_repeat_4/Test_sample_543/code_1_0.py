# The user wants to find the IUPAC name for the product of a chemical reaction.
# This script will determine the product and its name based on chemical principles.

# Step 1: Define the reactants and conditions.
substrate = "1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene"
reagent = "excess phenyl magnesium bromide (PhMgBr)"
conditions = "reflux in THF, then aqueous work-up"

# Step 2: Analyze the reaction mechanism.
# Phenyl magnesium bromide is a Grignard reagent, which is a strong nucleophile.
# It reacts with aryl halides in a coupling reaction to form new carbon-carbon bonds.
# The reactivity of the carbon-halogen bond follows the order: C-I > C-Br > C-Cl.

# Step 3: Predict the stepwise substitution.
# The starting molecule has three halogens: Iodine at position 2, and Bromine at positions 1 and 3.
#
# Reaction 1: The most reactive site is the C-I bond at position 2. It gets replaced by a phenyl group first.
# Reaction 2 & 3: Because excess Grignard reagent is used under reflux (heating), the less reactive
# C-Br bonds at positions 1 and 3 will also be substituted by phenyl groups.

# Step 4: Identify the final product structure.
# All three halogens are replaced by phenyl groups.
# The final product is a benzene ring with three phenyl substituents attached.
# The positions of the phenyl groups correspond to the original positions of the halogens.
positions = [1, 3, 2]
positions.sort() # IUPAC names use the lowest possible locants, so we sort them.

# Step 5: Construct the IUPAC name.
parent_molecule = "benzene"
substituent = "phenyl"
substituent_count = 3
prefix = "tri" # for three identical substituents

# As requested, outputting the numbers that form the final name.
first_locant = positions[0]
second_locant = positions[1]
third_locant = positions[2]

final_name = f"{first_locant},{second_locant},{third_locant}-{prefix}{substituent}{parent_molecule}"

print("The reaction involves the substitution of all three halogens (one iodine and two bromines) with phenyl groups.")
print(f"The phenyl groups are attached at positions {first_locant}, {second_locant}, and {third_locant} of the central benzene ring.")
print("\nBased on IUPAC nomenclature rules, the final product is named:")
