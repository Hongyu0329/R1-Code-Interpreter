    1.  **Goal:** The question asks for the property that is equivalent to the standard definition of continuity for a function f, using the language of nonstandard analysis.

    2.  **The Definition of Continuity:** A function f is continuous if it preserves limits. In nonstandard terms, this means that for any standard point x₀, points that are infinitesimally close to x₀ should be mapped to points that are infinitesimally close to f(x₀).

    3.  **Analyzing the Correct Option (B):**
        - The statement is: {options[correct_answer_key]}
        - It correctly captures the definition. It iterates through every *standard* point `x₀ ∈ X`.
        - For each `x₀`, it considers *any* point `x₁` in the extended space `X*` that is infinitesimally close to `x₀`.
        - It requires that the function `f` maps `x₁` to a point `f(x₁)` that is infinitesimally close to `f(x₀)`.
        - This is the cornerstone "transfer" of the concept of continuity into the nonstandard framework.

    4.  **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**
        - **A:** Only considers standard points, which is too weak.
        - **C:** Requires the property to hold for nonstandard points as well. This is the definition of *uniform continuity*, a stronger property.
        - **D, E, F:** These are converses and relate to properties like injectivity or continuity of an inverse function, not the continuity of f itself.
