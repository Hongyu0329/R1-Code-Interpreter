The question is: Does there exist a program P that computes def_superfast(10000)?
The answer is no. The function `def_superfast` is uncomputable. Here is a proof by contradiction:

1.  Let's understand what `def_superfast(10000)` requires. It must:
    a.  Consider every possible Python program with a source code length less than 10,000 characters.
    b.  Identify which of these programs halt and return an integer.
    c.  Find the largest of these integers, which the problem calls `Huge_int`.
    d.  Return the final value `Huge_int + 1`.

2.  The task in step (1b) is impossible. Determining whether an arbitrary program will halt is known as the Halting Problem, which has been proven to be unsolvable. Since computing `def_superfast` would require solving the Halting Problem, it cannot be computed.

3.  Let's use a more direct contradiction. Assume a program `P` that computes `def_superfast(10000)` *does* exist.

4.  Let `V` be the integer value that `P` computes and returns.
    From the function's definition, we know that `V = Huge_int + 1`.

5.  Now, let's create a new, simple Python program, which we can call `Q`. We can write the source code for `Q` as follows:

    `print({V})`

    This program simply prints the specific integer `V` that our hypothetical program `P` would compute. We can construct this program `Q` to have a source code length of much less than 10,000 characters. For example, if `V` was 12345, the program `Q` would just be `print(12345)`.

6.  Let's analyze our new program `Q`:
    - It is a Python program with source code less than 10,000 characters.
    - It halts.
    - It returns an integer: `V`.

7.  According to the definition of `def_superfast`, `Q` is one of the programs that must be considered in the search for `Huge_int`. Therefore, the integer returned by `Q`, which is `V`, must be less than or equal to `Huge_int`.
    This gives us the inequality: `V <= Huge_int`.

8.  Now we have a contradiction. Let's look at the two statements we have:
    - From the definition of `P`: `V = Huge_int + 1`
    - From analyzing `Q`:         `V <= Huge_int`

    If we substitute the first equation into the second one, we get:
    `(Huge_int + 1) <= Huge_int`

    This inequality simplifies to the following impossible mathematical statement:
    `1 <= 0`

9.  Conclusion: The assumption that program `P` can exist leads directly to a logical contradiction (`1 <= 0`). Therefore, the initial assumption must be false.

No program P can exist that computes def_superfast(10000).
