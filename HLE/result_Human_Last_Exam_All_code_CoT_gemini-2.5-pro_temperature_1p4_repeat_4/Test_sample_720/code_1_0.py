    print("1. Problem Formulation:")
    print("   The Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) update is θ(k+1) = θ(k) - η * v, where v = (F + αI)⁻¹ g.")
    print("   - The parameter vector θ represents the d x d weight matrix, so its size is d².")
    print("   - F is the Fisher Information Matrix, a d² x d² matrix.")
    print("   - The problem is to find the minimum cost to compute v, given n < d samples.")
    print("   - A naive inversion of the d² x d² matrix (F + αI) would cost O((d²)³) = O(d⁶).\n")

    print("2. Exploiting the Fisher Matrix Structure:")
    print("   For a single-layer linear network (y = Wx) and least squares loss, the Fisher matrix is exactly:")
    print("   F = (1/n) * (XXᵀ ⊗ I_d)")
    print("   where X is the d x n data matrix and '⊗' is the Kronecker product.")
    print("   The term to invert becomes: F + αI = ((1/n)XXᵀ + αI_d) ⊗ I_d.\n")

    print("3. Using the Woodbury Matrix Identity:")
    print("   Let S = (1/n)XXᵀ + αI_d. S is a d x d matrix.")
    print("   The update requires inverting S. Instead of a direct O(d³) inversion, we note that XXᵀ has rank n.")
    print("   Using the Woodbury matrix identity, the d x d inversion can be replaced by an n x n inversion:")
    print("   S⁻¹ = (αI_d + (1/n)XXᵀ)⁻¹ = (1/α)I_d - (1/nα²)X * (I_n + (1/nα)XᵀX)⁻¹ * Xᵀ")
    print("   This is much more efficient as it only requires inverting the n x n matrix M = I_n + (1/nα)XᵀX.\n")

    print("4. Cost Analysis of the Full Update Calculation:")
    print("   The update v = (S⁻¹ ⊗ I_d)g is computed without explicitly forming the d x d matrix S⁻¹.")
    print("   The total cost is the sum of the costs of the necessary matrix multiplications:")
    print("   - Cost of forming XᵀX (size n x n): O(n²d)")
    print("   - Cost of inverting M (size n x n): O(n³)")
    print("   - Cost of multiplications involving the d x d gradient G and d x n data X: O(d²n + dn²)\n")

    print("5. Final Minimum Cost:")
    print("   Combining the costs, the full complexity is O(d²*n + d*n² + n²*d + n³).")
    print("   This can be simplified to O(d²*n + d*n² + n³).")
    print("\n   The terms of the final cost equation are composed of powers of d and n:")
    print("   - Term 1: d^2 * n^1 (dominant term from gradient-data matrix products)")
    print("   - Term 2: d^1 * n^2 (from intermediate matrix products)")
    print("   - Term 3: n^3      (from inverting the n x n matrix)")
    print("\n   Since we are given that n < d, the asymptotically dominant term is d²n.")
    print("   Thus, the minimum achievable curvature cost has a complexity of O(d²n).")
