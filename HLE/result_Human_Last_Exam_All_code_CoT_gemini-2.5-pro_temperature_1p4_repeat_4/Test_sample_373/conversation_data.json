    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the specified barbell graph and the mechanics of the randomized uniform gossiping process.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge (the bottleneck). Since the total number of nodes is 10, each clique must have 5 nodes. Let's call the two cliques C1 and C2. The bottleneck edge connects one node from C1 to one node from C2. Let's call these two connected nodes the \"bridgehead\" nodes.\n\n2.  **Analyze Node Degrees:**\n    *   A regular node within a 5-node clique (that isn't a bridgehead) is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique. Its degree is 4.\n    *   A bridgehead node is connected to the 4 other nodes in its clique *and* to the other bridgehead node through the bottleneck edge. Therefore, its degree is `4 + 1 = 5`. There are two such bridgehead nodes.\n\n3.  **Understand the Gossiping Process:** Randomized uniform gossiping involves two steps for sampling an edge:\n    *   **Step 1:** Select a node `i` uniformly at random from the `N=10` total nodes. The probability of picking any specific node is `1/N = 1/10`.\n    *   **Step 2:** The selected node `i` then chooses one of its neighbors `j` uniformly at random. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor is `1/d(i)`, where `d(i)` is the degree of node `i`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge:** The bottleneck edge is sampled if one of the two following mutually exclusive events occurs:\n    *   **Event A:** The first bridgehead node (let's call it `A`) is selected, and it chooses the second bridgehead node (`B`) as its gossip partner.\n    *   **Event B:** The second bridgehead node (`B`) is selected, and it chooses the first one (`A`).\n\n5.  **Compute the Probabilities:**\n    *   The probability of Event A is: `P(A) = P(select A) * P(A chooses B) = (1/10) * (1/d(A)) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n    *   The probability of Event B is: `P(B) = P(select B) * P(B chooses A) = (1/10) * (1/d(B)) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n6.  **Sum the Probabilities:** The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n    *   `P(total) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25 = 0.04`.\n\nThe following Python code will formalize this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bottleneck_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the graph\n    N = 10\n\n    # Number of nodes in each complete graph (clique)\n    # 2 * m = N, so m = 5\n    m = N // 2\n\n    # The degree of a bridgehead node is (m-1) connections within its\n    # clique plus 1 connection for the bottleneck edge.\n    degree_bridgehead = (m - 1) + 1\n\n    # Probability of selecting a specific node (e.g., a bridgehead)\n    prob_select_node = 1 / N\n\n    # Probability of a selected bridgehead node choosing the other bridgehead node\n    prob_bridgehead_chooses_neighbor = 1 / degree_bridgehead\n\n    # The probability can be calculated from two mutually exclusive events:\n    # 1.
