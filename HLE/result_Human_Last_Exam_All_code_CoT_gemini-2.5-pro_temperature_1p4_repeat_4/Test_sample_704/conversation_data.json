    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Colors:** First, we need to determine the specific colors mentioned in the question.\n    *   The first color is the result of combining \"yellow and blue\". In both additive (light) and subtractive (pigment) color models, mixing yellow and blue produces **green**.\n    *   The second color is explicitly stated as **blue**.\n2.  **Understand Newton's Correspondence:** Isaac Newton associated the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the seven notes of a Western musical scale. The standard mapping is as follows:\n    *   Red -> C\n    *   Orange -> D\n    *   Yellow -> E\n    *   **Green -> F**\n    *   **Blue -> G**\n    *   Indigo -> A\n    *   Violet -> B\n3.  **Determine the Note for the Range:** The question asks for the note corresponding to the range \"between\" green and blue. In the sequence of the spectrum, green comes just before blue. Therefore, the note associated with the start of this range is the one corresponding to the color green.\n4.  **Find the Note:** Based on the mapping in step 2, the color green corresponds to the musical note **F**.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines this color-to-note mapping and prints out the logical steps to find the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_color_note():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the musical note corresponding to the range between green and blue\n    on Newton's colour circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Newton's color-to-note mapping in a dictionary.\n    color_to_note = {\n        \"red\": \"C\",\n        \"orange\": \"D\",\n        \"yellow\": \"E\",\n        \"green\": \"F\",\n        \"blue\": \"G\",\n        \"indigo\": \"A\",\n        \"violet\": \"B\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the colors from the problem description.\n    # The color produced by combining yellow and blue is green.\n    first_color = \"green\"\n    second_color = \"blue\"\n\n    # Step 3: The question asks for the note for the range starting with the first color.\n    # We look up the note for 'green'.\n    target_note = color_to_note[first_color]\n\n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final answer in an equation format.\n    print(f\"The color produced when combining yellow and blue is '{first_color.capitalize()}'.\")\n    print(f\"The range is between '{first_color.capitalize()}' and '{second_color.capitalize()}'.\")\n    print(f\"In Newton's system, the note corresponding to '{first_color.capitalize()}' is '{target_note}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Color(Yellow + Blue) -> Color({first_color.capitalize()}) -> Note({target_note})\")\n\nsolve_newton_color_note()\n<<<F>>>\n```"
