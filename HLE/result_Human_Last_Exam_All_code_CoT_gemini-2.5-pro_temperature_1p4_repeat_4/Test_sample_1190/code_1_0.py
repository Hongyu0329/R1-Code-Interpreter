    print("  - DNA-Binding Domain (DBD): Binds to the DNA.")
    print("  - Ligand-Binding Domain (LBD): Binds to retinoic acid (RA) and has an Activation Function (AF-2) surface to trigger transcription.")

    # --- Analysis of Choice A ---
    print("\n[A] RAR mutants with insertions at sites g and h disrupt transcriptional activation but retain DNA binding.")
    print("  - Plausibility: High.")
    print("  - Rationale: This describes a classic separation-of-function mutant. A mutation in the LBD's activation surface could prevent interaction with co-activators, thus blocking transcription. However, the separate DBD would remain intact and capable of binding to DNA. This is a common experimental finding used to map protein functions.")

    # --- Analysis of Choice D ---
    print("\n[D] All mutants that are defective in RA binding are also defective in both DNA binding and transcriptional activation, indicating a linked mechanism.")
    print("  - Plausibility: Low.")
    print("  - Rationale: This contradicts the modular nature of RAR. A mutant defective in RA binding has a problem in its LBD. This should not inherently cause a defect in the separate DBD. Therefore, it's false to claim that a defect in RA binding means a defect in DNA binding. The mechanisms are not linked in this direct way.")
    
    # --- Brief analysis of other choices ---
    print("\n[B, C, E] Other choices describe scenarios that are either less likely to be universally true or describe total loss-of-function, which is less mechanistically specific than the scenario in A.")

    print("\nStep 3: Conclude the analysis.")
    print("Choice A describes a fundamental and experimentally verifiable aspect of RAR biology: the functions of DNA binding and transcriptional activation are separable. Choice D makes a claim that is inconsistent with the known modular structure of nuclear receptors.")
    print("Therefore, Choice A is the most accurate description.")
