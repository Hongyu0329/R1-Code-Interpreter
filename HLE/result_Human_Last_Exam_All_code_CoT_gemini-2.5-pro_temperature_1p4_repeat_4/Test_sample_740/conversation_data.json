    "To solve the integral equation `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)`, we need to determine the values of the parameter `λ` for which no solution `u(x)` exists.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation**: The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, is a symmetric polynomial. It can be expanded as `K(x, y) = ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-j) y^j`.\n2.  **Convert to a Linear System**: A solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. We can express the integral equation as a system of linear algebraic equations. Let `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`. The solution `u(x)` can be written as `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) c_j x^(n-1-j)`. Substituting this back into the definitions of `c_k` yields a linear system of the form `(I - λA)c = b`.\n    *   The matrix `A` will have elements `A_kj = 1 / (k + n - j)` for `k, j` from `0` to `n-1`.\n    *   The vector `b` will have elements `b_k = 1 / (k + 1)`.\n3.  **Apply Fredholm's Alternative**:\n    *   A unique solution exists if the determinant of `(I - λA)` is non-zero.\n    *   If `det(I - λA) = 0`, `λ` is a characteristic value (the reciprocal of an eigenvalue of `A`). In this case, a solution exists only if the function `f(x)=1` is orthogonal to the eigenfunctions `φ(x)` corresponding to `λ`. The orthogonality condition is `∫₀¹ 1 * φ(x) dx = 0`.\n4.  **Check the Orthogonality Condition**: We can show that for any eigenfunction `φ(x)`, the integral `∫₀¹ φ(x) dx` is non-zero. This means the orthogonality condition is never met.\n5.  **Conclusion**: The equation has no solutions precisely for the characteristic values of `λ`. These are the values `λ = 1/μ`, where `μ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n6.  **Implementation**: The plan is to write a Python script that, for a given integer `n`, constructs the matrix `A`, computes its eigenvalues `μ`, and then calculates the corresponding values of `λ`. The user can modify the value of `n` in the script to find the values of `λ` for different cases.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the integral equation has no solutions\n    for a given integer n >= 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Construct the matrix A\n    A = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            A[k, j] = 1.0 / (k + n - j)\n\n    # Find the eigenvalues of A\n    # The characteristic values lambda are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of A.\n    try:\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A)\n        # Filter out potential zero eigenvalues to avoid division by zero\n        non_zero_eigenvalues = eigenvalues[np.abs(eigenvalues) > 1e-9]\n        if len(non_zero_eigenvalues) == 0:\n             print(f\"For n = {n}, no non-zero eigenvalues found for matrix A.\")\n             return\n\n        lambda_values = 1.0 / non_zero_eigenvalues\n        \n        print(f\"For n = {n}, the values of λ for which the equation has no solution are:\")\n        # The problem is about a specific equation where the answer is required.\n        # Since n is not given, we assume n=1. \n        # u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (x¹ - y¹) / (x - y) u(y)\n        # u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy u(y)\n        # let c = ∫₀¹ dy u(y), u(x)=1+λc\n        # c = ∫₀¹ (1+λc)dy = 1+λc\n        # c(1-λ)=1\n        # If λ=1, 0=1, no solution.\n        # So λ=1\n        if n == 1:\n          print(\"λ = 1\")\n        # I'm providing a general code for any n.
