    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  First, I will compile a list of historical mountains that are explicitly named in the Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus.\n2.  The key mountains that feature in the geography of the epic are:\n    *   **Mount Ida (near Troy)**: Where Zeus watches the battle.\n    *   **Mount Samothrace**: Where Poseidon watches the battle.\n    *   **Mount Athos**: Mentioned in a passage describing Hera's journey.\n    *   **Mount Pelion**: Mentioned as the source of wood for Achilles' spear.\n3.  Next, I will find the official elevation (height) for each of these real-world mountains.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script to compare these elevations and identify the tallest among them, printing the details of each mountain before declaring the final result.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad,\n    excluding Mount Olympus, by comparing their elevations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary of historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    # Mount Olympus (2917 m) is excluded as per the user's request.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Ida (near Troy)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624\n    }\n\n    print(\"Comparing the elevations of historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad (besides Olympus):\\n\")\n\n    tallest_mountain_name = \"\"\n    max_height = 0\n\n    # Iterate through the dictionary to find the tallest mountain\n    # and print each mountain's data as part of the process.\n    for name, height in mountains.items():\n        # This print statement fulfills the requirement to \"output each number\".\n        print(f\"- {name}: {height} meters\")\n        if height > max_height:\n            max_height = height\n            tallest_mountain_name = name\n\n    print(f\"\\nAfter comparing the elevations, the tallest historical mountain mentioned is {tallest_mountain_name} with a height of {max_height} meters.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
