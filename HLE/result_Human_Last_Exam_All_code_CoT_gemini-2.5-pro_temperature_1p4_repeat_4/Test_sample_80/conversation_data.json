    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will calculate the total number of squares on the perimeter (the \"edge\") of a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n2.  Second, I will determine the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these edge squares so that no bishop attacks another. Bishops attack along diagonals of the same color. A simple and effective strategy is to place them on the two outermost files (columns 'a' and 'h'). This arrangement has only two pairs of attacking bishops (the opposite corners), which can be resolved by removing two bishops.\n3.  Finally, I will subtract the maximum number of bishops from the total number of edge squares to find the number of squares that will remain empty. The final code will print out each number used in this final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of an 8x8 chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # 1. Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An 8x8 board has 8 squares on each of its 4 sides.\n    # The 4 corner squares are counted twice, so we subtract 4.\n    # Total edge squares = (8 * 4) - 4 = 28.\n    # Alternatively: 8 (top) + 8 (bottom) + 6 (left side inner) + 6 (right side inner) = 28\n    total_edge_squares = (board_size * 4) - 4\n\n    # 2. Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on edge squares.\n    # Bishops attack diagonally. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops\n    # that can be placed on an 8x8 board is 14.\n    # A valid configuration for the edge squares is to place bishops on all 8 squares of\n    # the 'a' file and all 8 squares of the 'h' file. This is 16 squares.\n    # However, in this setup, the bishop on a1 attacks h8, and the bishop on a8 attacks h1.\n    # To resolve these two conflicts, we must remove two bishops (e.g., h1 and h8).\n    # This leaves 16 - 2 = 14 bishops. This is the maximum possible.\n    max_bishops_on_edge = 14\n\n    # 3.
