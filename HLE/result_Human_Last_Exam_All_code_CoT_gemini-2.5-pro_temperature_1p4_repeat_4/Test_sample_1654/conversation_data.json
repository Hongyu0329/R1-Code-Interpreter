    "To solve this, I will analyze the text of Anton Chekhov's short story, \"The Chameleon,\" to count every time Otchumyelov's coat (or greatcoat/overcoat) is described or its state is changed. These descriptions are symbolic of his shifting mentality. My plan is to identify each distinct mention that contributes to this symbolism:\n\n1.  The initial description of Otchumyelov wearing his new coat.\n2.  The first action: taking the coat off when he believes the dog is a stray.\n3.  The second action: putting the coat on when he hears the dog might belong to a General.\n4.  The third action: taking the coat off again when told it's not the General's.\n5.  The fourth action: putting the coat on again when he learns the dog belongs to the General's brother.\n6.  The final action: wrapping himself in the coat as he leaves.\n\nI will write a Python script that assigns a count to each of these instances and then sums them up to find the total, printing the full equation as part of the output.\n\n```python\ndef count_coat_descriptions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of times Otchumyelov's coat\n    is described in Chekhov's \"The Chameleon\".\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the symbolic descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat:\\n\")\n\n    # Each instance is a symbolic description of his changing mentality.\n    # We count each one.\n\n    # 1. The story begins by establishing the coat as part of his identity.\n    initial_description = 1\n    print(f\"Instance 1: The initial description ('...wearing a new overcoat...'): {initial_description}\")\n\n    # 2. First shift: He thinks the dog is a stray and feels hot with indignation.\n    takes_off_first_time = 1\n    print(f\"Instance 2: Takes coat off ('...take my coat off, Yeldrin; it's frightfully hot!'): {takes_off_first_time}\")\n\n    # 3. Second shift: He hears the dog may belong to the General and feels a sudden chill of fear.\n    puts_on_first_time = 1\n    print(f\"Instance 3: Puts coat on ('...Help me on with my coat... I feel chilly...'): {puts_on_first_time}\")\n\n    # 4. Third shift: He is told the dog is not the General's and his \"heat\" returns.\n    takes_off_second_time = 1\n    print(f\"Instance 4: Takes coat off again ('...Take my coat off, Yeldrin...'): {takes_off_second_time}\")\n\n    # 5. Fourth shift: He learns the dog belongs to the General's brother and the \"chill\" returns.\n    puts_on_second_time = 1\n    print(f\"Instance 5: Puts coat on again ('...Put my coat on... I feel a cold wind...'): {puts_on_second_time}\")\n    \n    # 6. Final act: He leaves, wrapped in his coat, embodying his official status once more.\n    final_action = 1\n    print(f\"Instance 6: The final action ('Otchumelov wraps himself in his greatcoat...'): {final_action}\")\n\n    # Summing up all instances to get the total number of symbolic descriptions.\n    total_descriptions = (initial_description + takes_off_first_time +\n                          puts_on_first_time + takes_off_second_time +\n                          puts_on_second_time + final_action)\n\n    print(\"\\n--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Total number of times the coat was described is the sum of these instances:\")\n    print(f\"{initial_description} + {takes_off_first_time} + {puts_on_first_time} + {takes_off_second_time} + {puts_on_second_time} + {final_action} = {total_descriptions}\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_coat_descriptions()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
