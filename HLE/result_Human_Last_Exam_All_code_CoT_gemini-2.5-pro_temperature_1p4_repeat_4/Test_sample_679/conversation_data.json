    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. This fits the general formula for alkenes or cycloalkanes, $C_nH_{2n}$. The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) is calculated as:\nDBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 1.\nA DBE of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe provided data is: $^{13}C$ NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n*   There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n*   The chemical shifts at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the typical range for alkene carbons (C=C), confirming the presence of a double bond. This accounts for the DBE of 1.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret Signal Multiplicities (s, t, d, q)**\nThe multiplicities tell us the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon:\n*   `145(s)`: A quaternary carbon (s = singlet, 0 H). Since it's in the alkene region, this is one of the carbons in the double bond (>C=).\n*   `112(t)`: A CH₂ group (t = triplet, 2 H). As it's in the alkene region, this is the other carbon in the double bond (=CH₂).\n*   These two signals confirm a terminal, disubstituted alkene fragment: `>C=CH₂`.\n*   `48(t)`: An aliphatic CH₂ group.\n*   `27(d)`: An aliphatic CH group (d = doublet, 1 H).\n*   `22(q)`: An aliphatic CH₃ group (q = quartet, 3 H).\n*   `21(q)`: Another aliphatic CH₃ group.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Overlapping Signal and Assemble Fragments**\nTo account for all 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens, one of the signals must represent two identical carbons. Let's test the hypothesis that one of the methyl (q) signals corresponds to two carbons.\n*   If the 21(q) signal represents two identical CH₃ groups, the total atom count is:\n    *   **Carbons**: 1(s) + 2(t) + 1(d) + 1(q) + 2(q from one signal) = 7 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens**: 0 (from s) + 2 (from 112t) + 2 (from 48t) + 1 (from 27d) + 3 (from 22q) + (2 * 3) (from 21q) = 14 hydrogens.\n*   This matches the molecular formula C₇H₁₄. The two equivalent methyl groups (21q) and the CH group (27d) strongly suggest the presence of an **isopropyl group** `(-CH(CH₃)₂)` fragment.\n*   The remaining fragments are an ethyl group `(-CH₂CH₃)` from the signals at `48(t)` and `22(q)`.\n\n**Step 5: Construct the Final Structure and Determine IUPAC Name**\nThe molecule contains a `>C=CH₂` fragment where the quaternary carbon (145s) is attached to the rest of the molecule. The groups attached to this carbon must be the isopropyl group and the ethyl group.\n*   Structure: `CH₂=C(CH₂CH₃)(CH(CH₃)₂)`.\n*   Let's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n    *   `=CH₂`: Matches `112(t)`.\n    *   `>C=`: Matches `145(s)`.\n    *   Ethyl `-CH₂-`: Allylic position, matches `48(t)`.\n    *   Isopropyl `-CH-`: Matches `27(d)`.\n    *   Ethyl `-CH₃`: Matches `22(q)`.\n    *   Isopropyl `-(CH₃)₂`: Two equivalent methyls, matches `21(q)`.\n*   The structure is consistent with all data. Now, we find the IUPAC name.\n    1.  The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a **but**ene chain.\n    2.  Numbering the chain to give the double bond the lowest number makes it **but-1-ene**.\n    3.  The substituents are an **ethyl** group at position 2 and a **methyl** group at position 3.\n*   The final IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data\n    to determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze molecular formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE).\n    # Formula: C7H14 -> DBE = 1 (one double bond or one ring).\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    dbe = 1\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze 13C NMR data.\n    # Signals: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n    # 6 signals for 7 carbons means two carbons are chemically equivalent.\n    # Signals at 145 and 112 ppm confirm a C=C double bond.\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't',\n        27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Piece together the fragments based on multiplicities and chemical shifts.\n    # 145(s) and 112(t) in the alkene region -> >C=CH2 fragment.\n    # The remaining 5 carbons and 12 hydrogens form two alkyl groups attached to the quaternary carbon.\n    # 27(d) and 21(q, for 2C) -> isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n    # 48(t) and 22(q) -> ethyl group [-CH2CH3].\n    fragment1 = \"ethyl group\"\n    fragment2 = \"isopropyl group\"\n    backbone = \">C=CH2\"\n\n    # Step 4: Assemble the final structure and determine the IUPAC name.\n    # Structure: The ethyl and isopropyl groups are attached to the quaternary carbon of the >C=CH2 fragment.\n    # IUPAC Naming:\n    #   - Longest chain with C=C: butene.\n    #   - Double bond at position 1: but-1-ene.\n    #   - Substituents: ethyl at C2, methyl at C3.\n    # Final Name: 2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene.\n\n    final_iupac_name = \"2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene\"\n    \n    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final name/equation.\n    # The numbers in the name \"2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene\" are 2, 3, and 1.\n    # Printing the full name will display these numbers.\n    print(f\"The analysis of the molecular formula and 13C NMR data leads to the following structure.\")\n    print(f\"Structure fragments: A >C=CH2 group, an ethyl group, and an isopropyl group.\")\n    print(f\"Final Assembled Structure: CH2=C(CH2CH3)(CH(CH3)2)\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe IUPAC name of the compound is:\")\n    print(final_iupac_name)\n\nsolve_structure()\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene>>>\n```"
