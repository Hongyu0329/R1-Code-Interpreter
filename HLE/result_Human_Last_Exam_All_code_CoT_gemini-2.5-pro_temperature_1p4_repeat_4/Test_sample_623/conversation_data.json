    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of labeled CO₂ molecules produced:\n\n1.  **Identify the Labeled Carbons:** The starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means carbon atoms at position 1 (the aldehyde carbon) and position 4 are labeled with the ¹³C isotope.\n\n2.  **Trace Carbons through Glycolysis Part 1 (Cleavage):**\n    *   Glucose (6 carbons) is converted to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), keeping the labels at C1 and C4.\n    *   The enzyme Aldolase cleaves FBP between C3 and C4.\n    *   This split produces two 3-carbon molecules:\n        *   **Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate (DHAP):** Formed from carbons C1, C2, and C3 of glucose. It contains the label from glucose's **C1**. The label is on the C1 position of DHAP.\n        *   **Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate (GAP):** Formed from carbons C4, C5, and C6 of glucose. It contains the label from glucose's **C4**. This C4 becomes the C1 position of GAP.\n\n3.  **Trace Carbons through Isomerization:**\n    *   The cell needs to convert DHAP into GAP to continue glycolysis. This is done by the enzyme Triose Phosphate Isomerase.\n    *   This isomerization reaction preserves the carbon numbering. C1 of DHAP becomes C1 of GAP.\n    *   Therefore, the DHAP molecule (labeled at its C1) is converted into a *second* GAP molecule that is also labeled at its C1 position.\n\n4.  **Consolidate the Resulting Molecules:**\n    *   At this point, we have two molecules of GAP ready for the second half of glycolysis.\n    *   **Both** molecules are labeled at their C1 position.\n\n5.  **Trace Carbons to Pyruvate and CO₂:**\n    *   Both GAP molecules are converted to pyruvate. The C1 of GAP becomes the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate.\n    *   This means we produce **two** molecules of pyruvate, and **both are labeled at their C1 carboxyl group**.\n    *   The question asks for the release of CO₂. The primary step for this is the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase reaction (Pyruvate → Acetyl-CoA + CO₂).\n    *   This reaction specifically removes the C1 carboxyl group of pyruvate and releases it as CO₂.\n\n6.  **Count the Labeled CO₂:**\n    *   Since both molecules of pyruvate are labeled at the C1 carbon that is released, both decarboxylation events will produce a labeled **¹³CO₂** molecule.\n    *   Therefore, a total of **two** ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules are released.\n\nHere is the Python code that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\ndef trace_glycolysis_carbons():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the 13C labels from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis\n    and pyruvate decarboxylation to count the labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the starting molecule\n    print(\"Step 1: The starting molecule is Glucose, with 13C labels at Carbon-1 and Carbon-4.\")\n    print(\"Glucose: [13C]1-C2-C3-[13C]4-C5-C6\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Glycolysis Part 1 - Cleavage of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate\n    print(\"Step 2: Glucose is cleaved into two 3-carbon molecules.\")\n    print(\"- Carbons 1-3 form Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate (DHAP).
