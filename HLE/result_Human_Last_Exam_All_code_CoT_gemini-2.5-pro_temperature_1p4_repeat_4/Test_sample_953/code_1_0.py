def solve_mis_complexity():
    """
    This function determines the complexity categories for Luby's algorithm on different graph classes.
    
    The analysis is as follows:
    1.  f1(n) for a cycle: The graph structure simplifies to paths, and the maximum path length
        decreases super-exponentially (log(L) in each step). This leads to a Theta(log* n)
        runtime. This corresponds to category 3.
    
    2.  f2(n) for a tree with bounded degree: The general analysis for bounded-degree graphs
        applies. The number of edges decreases by a constant factor in each step, leading
        to an O(log n) upper bound. A lower bound of Omega(log n) for MIS on trees in the
        LOCAL model is also well-known. Thus, the complexity is Theta(log n). This
        corresponds to category 9.
        
    3.  f3(n) for a general graph with bounded degree: The same logic as for trees applies.
        The complexity is Theta(log n). This corresponds to category 9.
