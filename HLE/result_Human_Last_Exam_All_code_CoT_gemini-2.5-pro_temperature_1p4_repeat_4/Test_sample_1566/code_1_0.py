    print("Step 2: Deducing the structure of the orbits.")
    print("The set of end points, E, is topologically invariant. Any homeomorphism must map an end point to an end point.")
    print("Since E is a non-empty finite set and X is connected, E cannot be all of X.")
    print("Given that there are only two orbits, they must be the set of end points E and the set of all other points, I = X \\ E.")

    print("Step 3: Using the 'cut point' concept for classification.")
    print("A point p is a 'cut point' if removing it disconnects the space. This is a topological property, so all points in an orbit are either all cut points or all non-cut-points.")
    print("It is a known result in continuum theory that the end points of a chainable continuum are non-cut-points.")
    print("Therefore, all points in E are non-cut-points.")
    print("Conversely, the non-end-points in I must be cut points. If they were not, then no point of X would be a cut point, which for a chainable continuum implies that all points are end points, contradicting that E is finite.")
    print("Conclusion: The set of non-cut-points of X is exactly the set of end points E.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Step 4: Applying classification theorems based on the number of non-cut-points (k).")
    print("Case for k = 2:")
    print("A famous theorem by R.L. Moore states that any continuum with exactly two non-cut-points is homeomorphic to a closed interval (an arc, e.g., [0,1]).")
    print("The arc has two end points, {0, 1}, and its non-end-points are the interior (0,1). The orbits are indeed {0,1} and (0,1). Thus, the arc is a valid solution.")
    print("\nCase for k > 2:")
    print("A continuum with a finite number k > 2 of non-cut-points is a 'topological graph' that is a tree-like structure.")
    print("The set of non-end-points I in such a graph would contain points on the 'edges' (of order 2) and 'branch points' (of order > 2).")
    print("These two types of points have different local topological properties and cannot belong to the same orbit.")
    print("This contradicts our deduction that all non-end-points I form a single orbit. Therefore, no solutions exist for k > 2.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Step 5: Final Conclusion.")
    print("The only possibility is that k=2, and the continuum must be an arc.")
    print("All arcs are homeomorphic to each other.")
