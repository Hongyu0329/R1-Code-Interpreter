    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use a general topological formula that relates the properties of a diagram.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key formulas:** There are two fundamental relations for a connected Feynman diagram:\n    *   `L = I - V + 1`, where `L` is the number of loops, `I` is the number of internal lines, and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   `n * V = 2 * I + E`, where `n` is the number of lines meeting at each vertex (e.g., `n=4` for a $\\phi^4$ theory), `V` is the number of vertices, `I` is the number of internal lines, and `E` is the number of external lines.\n\n2.  **Derive a formula for Vertices (V):** We can combine these two equations to express the number of vertices `V` in terms of the number of loops `L`, external lines `E`, and the type of interaction `n`.\n    *   From the first formula, we get `I = L + V - 1`.\n    *   Substituting this into the second formula gives: `n * V = 2 * (L + V - 1) + E`.\n    *   Rearranging to solve for `V`, we arrive at: `V = (2*L - 2 + E) / (n - 2)`.\n\n3.  **Minimize V:** To find the minimum number of vertices, we need to choose the parameters `L`, `n`, and `E` appropriately.\n    *   The problem specifies a **two-loop** diagram, so `L = 2`.\n    *   For an \"interacting scalar field theory,\" the simplest and most common case is the $\\phi^4$ theory, where each vertex connects four lines, so `n = 4`. This choice also minimizes the denominator `(n-2)`, helping to minimize `V`.\n    *   To minimize `V`, we must also minimize the number of external lines `E`. The minimum possible value is `E = 0`, which corresponds to a vacuum diagram (a diagram with no external particles).\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** The Python script will plug these values (`L=2`, `n=4`, `E=0`) into the derived formula to calculate the minimum number of vertices `V`. It will also print the final equation with the numbers substituted in.\n\n```python\n# Set the parameters based on the problem statement\n# L is the number of loops\nL = 2\n# n is the number of lines per vertex. We consider the common phi^4 theory.\nn = 4\n# E is the number of external lines. To minimize vertices, we choose the minimum E.\nE = 0\n\nprint(f\"To find the minimum number of vertices (V) in a two-loop Feynman diagram, we use the formula:\")\nprint(f\"V = (2*L - 2 + E) / (n - 2)\")\nprint(f\"We are given L = {L} (two-loop).\")\nprint(f\"For the simplest interacting scalar theory (phi^n), we choose n = {n}.\")\nprint(f\"To minimize V, we choose the minimum number of external lines, E = {E}.\")\nprint(\"\")\n\n# Calculate the number of vertices V\nnumerator = 2 * L - 2 + E\ndenominator = n - 2\nV = numerator / denominator\n\nprint(\"Plugging in the values, the equation is:\")\nprint(f\"V = (2 * {L} - 2 + {E}) / ({n} - 2)\")\nprint(f\"V = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n\n# The final result must be an integer\nmin_vertices = int(V)\n\nprint(f\"The minimum number of vertices is: {min_vertices}\")\nprint(\"\\nThis corresponds to the 'figure-eight' vacuum diagram in phi^4 theory.\")\n\n<<<1>>>\n```"
