    "This is a sequence generation puzzle. The pattern is derived from a hidden source text, where numbers are generated based on character positions on a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Rule:** For each word in a source text, the value is the sum of the ASCII codes of the characters typed by each finger. This generates a list of numbers for each word.\n2.  **Identify the Source Text:** While there are many variations of this puzzle, this specific sequence is reportedly generated from the sentence: `\"solve this puzzle: run me through your code to get the answer\"`.\n3.  **Define the Keyboard Map:** We will map each character (including letters, numbers, and symbols) to the finger that types it on a standard QWERTY keyboard (`l_pinky`, `l_ring`, `l_middle`, `l_index`, `r_index`, `r_middle`, `r_ring`, `r_pinky`).\n4.  **Implement the Logic:**\n    *   Split the source text into words.\n    *   For each word, iterate through its characters.\n    *   For each character, find the corresponding finger and add the character's ASCII value to that finger's sum.\n    *   After processing a word, get the list of sums. The order of these numbers is determined by sorting the finger names alphabetically.\n    *   Concatenate the lists of numbers from all words to form the final sequence.\n5.  **Find the Next Number:** The user has provided the first 33 numbers of the sequence. We will generate the full sequence and find the 34th number, which is the \"next number\".\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef generate_typing_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a number sequence based on a source text and QWERTY keyboard typing rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
