# Parameters of the complete intersection
N = 102  # Dimension of the ambient projective space CP^N
k = 2    # Number of hypersurfaces

# We need to compute the Euler characteristic chi(X) to find the middle Betti number b_n(X).
# The relation is b_n(X) = chi(X) - n for n even. Here n=100.
# chi(X) = deg(X) * alpha, where alpha is the coefficient of z^n in the expansion of (1+z)^(N+1) / (1+d*z)^k.
# alpha can be computed using residues.
# alpha = -Res(z=-1/d)
# The pole at z = -1/d = -1/2 is of order k=2.
# The residue is given by (1/d**k) * f'(-1/d), where f(z) = (1+z)^(N+1) / z^(n+1)

# We calculate f'(-1/d)
# f'(z) = ((1+z)**N * (k*z - (n+1))) / z**(n+k)
# Here, the expression for f'(z) is simplified. The original expression has z**(n+2) in the denominator.
# f'(z) = (1+z)^N * z^-(n+2) * [ (N+1)z - (n+1)(1+z) ]
# = (1+z)^N * z^-(n+2) * [ (N-n)z - (n+1) ] = (1+z)^N * (k*z - (n+1)) / z^(n+2)
# Since the denominator z_val**(n+k) will cancel with (1+z_val)^N / (-1)^N, let's calculate directly:
# f'(z) = d/dz [ (1+z)^(N+1) * z^-(n+1) ]
#       = (N+1)(1+z)^N * z^-(n+1) - (n+1)(1+z)^(N+1) * z^-(n+2)
z_val = -1/d
f_prime_val = (N + 1) * (1 + z_val)**N * z_val**(-(n + 1)) - (n + 1) * (1 + z_val)**(N + 1) * z_val**(-(n + 2))

# Residue at z = -1/d
# For a pole of order k=2, it is (1/d**k) * f'(-1/d)
residue_at_neg_half = (1 / d**k) * f_prime_val

# alpha is the residue at z=0, which is -residue_at_neg_half
alpha = -residue_at_neg_half

# Euler characteristic chi(X)
chi_X = deg_X * alpha

# Dimension of the middle cohomology group, b_n(X)
