    # 1. Structure: Its cuticle contains helically stacked layers of chitin
    #    known as Bouligand structures.
    # 2. Optical Phenomenon: These structures act as chiral photonic crystals
    #    and selectively reflect circularly polarized light.
    # 3. Ecological Function: This unique optical signal is believed to be used
    #    for intraspecific communication, such as mate attraction, as most
    #    predators cannot perceive circular polarization.

    # Evaluating the options based on these facts leads to choice K.
