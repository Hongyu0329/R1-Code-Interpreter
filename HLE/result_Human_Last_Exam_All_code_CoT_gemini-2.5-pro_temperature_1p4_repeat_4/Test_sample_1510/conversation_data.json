    "To determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Point Groups of Order 2:** First, we need to identify which of the 2D crystallographic point groups have an order of 2. The order of a group is the number of symmetry operations it contains. A group of order 2 has two operations: the identity and one other operation. In 2D, the point groups that fit this description are:\n    *   **Point Group '2'**: Contains the identity and a 2-fold rotation.\n    *   **Point Group 'm'**: Contains the identity and a mirror reflection.\n\n2.  **Count Wallpaper Groups for Each Point Group:** Next, we list and count the wallpaper groups that belong to each of these point groups.\n    *   The only wallpaper group with point group '2' is **p2**.\n    *   There are three wallpaper groups with point group 'm': **pm**, **pg**, and **cm**.\n\n3.  **Sum the Counts:** Finally, we add the counts from the previous step to get the total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wallpaper_group_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 2D crystallographic point groups of order 2 are '2' and 'm'.\n    # We need to count how many of the 17 wallpaper groups belong to these point groups.\n\n    # Number of wallpaper groups with point group '2'\n    # This corresponds to the group p2.\n    count_for_point_group_2 = 1\n\n    # Number of wallpaper groups with point group 'm'\n    # These correspond to the groups pm, pg, and cm.\n    count_for_point_group_m = 3\n\n    # The total is the sum of these counts.\n    total = count_for_point_group_2 + count_for_point_group_m\n\n    print(\"The point groups of order 2 are '2' (two-fold rotation) and 'm' (mirror reflection).\")\n    print(f\"Number of wallpaper groups with point group '2': {count_for_point_group_2}\")\n    print(f\"Number of wallpaper groups with point group 'm': {count_for_point_group_m}\")\n    print(f\"The total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 is the sum:\")\n    print(f\"{count_for_point_group_2} + {count_for_point_group_m} = {total}\")\n\nsolve_wallpaper_group_count()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
