import sympy as sp

# This script calculates the necessary parameters to find the third cumulant of the limiting distribution.

# Define the symbolic variable for x
x = sp.Symbol('x', real=True)

# Define the probability density function (PDF)
# f(x) = 3 / (2 * (1 + |x|)^4)
pdf = 3 / (2 * (1 + sp.Abs(x))**4)

# Step 1: Calculate the mean (mu) of the distribution X_i.
# The mean is the expected value E[X] = integral(x * f(x) dx) from -inf to inf.
# The integrand is an odd function, so the integral over a symmetric interval is 0.
mean_integrand = x * pdf
mu = sp.integrate(mean_integrand, (x, -sp.oo, sp.oo))

# Step 2: Calculate the variance (sigma^2) of the distribution X_i.
# The variance is E[(X - mu)^2] = integral((x - mu)^2 * f(x) dx) from -inf to inf.
# Since mu = 0, this simplifies to E[X^2].
variance_integrand = (x - mu)**2 * pdf
variance = sp.integrate(variance_integrand, (x, -sp.oo, sp.oo))

# Step 3: Use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).
# The problem asks for the third cumulant of the converged variable Y_n.
# We assume Y_n = sqrt(n)*(sample_mean - mu), which converges to a Normal distribution N(0, sigma^2).
# From our calculations, the limiting distribution is N(0, 1).
# For any Normal distribution, the third cumulant is 0.
third_cumulant = 0
