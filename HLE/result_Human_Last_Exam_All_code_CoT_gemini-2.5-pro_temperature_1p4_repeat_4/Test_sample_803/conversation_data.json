    "Answering this question requires applying some key theorems from finite group theory. Here is my step-by-step thinking process that leads to the final code.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Definitions**: First, I'll break down the terms in the question: \"finite group,\" \"product-free set,\" \"maximal by inclusion,\" \"fills G,\" and \"filled group.\" The core of the problem lies in the definition of a \"filled group.\"\n\n2.  **Find a Usable Criterion for \"Filled Group\"**: The definition of a filled group (every maximal product-free set generates the group) is abstract and difficult to check directly. I'll search for a more concrete, equivalent condition. A key result by G.L. Walls states that a *finite solvable group* is filled if and only if it has no quotient group isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Groups of Order $2q^m$**:\n    *   I'll check if groups of order $2q^m$ (where $q$ is an odd prime) are solvable. Burnside's $p^a q^b$ theorem confirms that they are.\n    *   Next, I'll determine if these groups can have a $C_2 \\times C_2$ quotient. A quotient group's order must divide the parent group's order. The order of $C_2 \\times C_2$ is 4. The order of our group is $2q^m$. Since $q$ is odd, $q^m$ is odd, and thus $2q^m$ is not divisible by 4.\n    *   This means no group of order $2q^m$ (with $q$ odd) can have a quotient isomorphic to $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Results**: Combining steps 2 and 3, I can conclude that *all* groups of order $2q^m$ (for odd prime $q$) are filled. The problem then simplifies to: \"What are the *nonabelian* groups of this order?\"\n\n5.  **Classify Nonabelian Groups of Order $2q^m$**:\n    *   Using Sylow's theorems, I can show that any group $G$ of this order has a normal Sylow $q$-subgroup, let's call it $Q$ (of order $q^m$), and a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2 (isomorphic to $C_2$).\n    *   This means every group of this order is a semidirect product: $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$.\n    *   Such a group is nonabelian if either (a) the group $Q$ is nonabelian (which requires $m \\ge 3$), or (b) the action of $C_2$ on $Q$ in the semidirect product is non-trivial.\n\n6.  **Develop the Python Code**:\n    *   Since a complete classification is too complex to list, the Python script will describe these families of groups.\n    *   The script will take an odd prime `q` and a natural number `m` as examples.\n    *   It will first print the theoretical explanation that all such groups are filled.\n    *   Then, it will describe the nonabelian families based on the structure $Q \\rtimes C_2$.\n    *   To make it more concrete, I'll write a helper function to generate integer partitions of `m`. Each partition corresponds to a unique structure for an abelian group $Q$ of order $q^m$.\n    *   The script will highlight the most famous examples, such as the Dihedral groups $D_{2q^m}$.\n    *   Finally, to satisfy the unusual instruction, \"output each number in the final equation,\" I'll interpret the relation $srs = r^{-1}$ in the dihedral group presentation as the \"final equation\" and print the numbers involved ($q^m, 2, -1$).\n\nThis plan leads to a Python script that provides a comprehensive, educational answer while satisfying all the constraints of the user's request.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef _find_partitions_recursive(target, max_val, current_partition, all_partitions):\n    \"\"\"Helper function for recursively generating integer partitions.\"\"\"\n    if target == 0:\n        all_partitions.append(list(current_partition))\n        return\n\n    # 'i' can be at most target, and at most the max_val from the previous step\n    # to keep partitions in non-increasing order, avoiding duplicate structures.\n    for i in range(min(max_val, target), 0, -1):\n        current_partition.append(i)\n        _find_partitions_recursive(target - i, i, current_partition, all_partitions)\n        current_partition.pop()\n\ndef get_partitions(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of all integer partitions of n. Each partition corresponds\n    to an isomorphism class of an abelian group of order p**n.\n    Example: get_partitions(3) returns [[3], [2, 1], [1, 1, 1]].\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 0:\n        return [[]]\n    all_partitions = []\n    _find_partitions_recursive(n, n, [], all_partitions)\n    return all_partitions\n\ndef find_nonabelian_filled_groups(q, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and identifies the nonabelian filled groups\n    of order 2*q**m for a given odd prime q and natural number m.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    order = 2 * (q**m)\n    print(f\"Identifying nonabelian filled groups of order 2 * {q}^{m} = {order}\")\n    print(\"=\" * 70)\n    \n    # Step 1: Theoretical foundation for \"filled groups\"\n    print(\"\\n[Step 1: Analysis of the 'filled group' property]\")\n    print(\"A key theorem states a finite solvable group is 'filled' if and only if it\")\n    print(\"does not have the Klein four-group (C\\u2082 \\u00d7 C\\u2082) as a quotient.\")\n    print(f\"All groups of order 2*q^m = {order} are solvable (by Burnside's p\\u1d43q\\u1d47 theorem).\")\n    print(\"A quotient group of order 4 (like C\\u2082 \\u00d7 C\\u2082) cannot exist for such a group,\")\n    print(f\"because 4 does not divide the group order {order} (since q is an odd prime).\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: ALL groups of order 2*q**m (q odd) are filled.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Focus on nonabelian groups and their structure\n    print(\"\\n[Step 2: Identifying the NONABELIAN Groups of this Order]\")\n    print(\"The problem reduces to finding all nonabelian groups of order 2*q**m.\")\n    print(\"Any such group G must have a normal Sylow q-subgroup, Q, of order q**m.\")\n    print(\"The group G can always be described as a semidirect product: G = Q \\u22ca C\\u2082.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThis group G is nonabelian if either of these conditions is met:\")\n    print(\"  1.
