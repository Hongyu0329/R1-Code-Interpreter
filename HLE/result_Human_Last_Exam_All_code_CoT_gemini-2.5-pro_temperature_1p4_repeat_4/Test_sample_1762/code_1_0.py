# The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes for a topological space X
# with a specific set of properties.

# Step 1: Analyze the given properties of the space X.
# - X is a metric space (and therefore Hausdorff).
# - X is locally compact.
# - X is a one-to-one continuous image of the real line, ℝ. Let this map be f: ℝ → X.

# Step 2: Apply a standard theorem from topology.
# A continuous bijection from a locally compact Hausdorff space (like ℝ) to another
# Hausdorff space (like X) is a homeomorphism.
# This means that X must be homeomorphic to ℝ.

# Step 3: Conclude that there can be at most one homeomorphism class.
# Since any space X satisfying the properties must be homeomorphic to ℝ, all such
# spaces belong to the same homeomorphism class.

# Step 4: Verify that ℝ itself satisfies all the properties.
# - ℝ is a metric space, locally compact, and a one-to-one continuous image of itself.
# - We must check the final property: For any distinct x, y ∈ ℝ, there exists a
#   closed, connected set K such that x ∈ Int(K) and y ∉ K.
# - Let x, y ∈ ℝ with x < y. Choose a point z such that x < z < y.
# - Let K be the set (-∞, z].
# - K is a closed and connected subset of ℝ.
# - The interior of K is Int(K) = (-∞, z).
# - Since x < z, we have x ∈ Int(K).
# - Since y > z, we have y ∉ K.
# - The property holds.

# Step 5: Final conclusion.
# There is exactly one homeomorphism class that satisfies all the given conditions,
# which is the class of the real line ℝ.
