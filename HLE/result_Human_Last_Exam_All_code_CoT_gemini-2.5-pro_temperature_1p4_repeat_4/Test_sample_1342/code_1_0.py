# Other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:
# C: False, glucose starvation did not increase activation in young mice (6% vs 6%).
# E: False, neither GLUT-4 downregulation nor glucose starvation increased activation in young mice (both stayed at 6%).
# F: False, the second part is incorrect as glucose starvation DID increase activation in old mice (6% vs 3%).
# G: False, the experiment does not provide data on a high-caloric diet, and impairing GLUT-4 increased, not decreased, activation.
# B & D are correct but less complete than A.
# H is incorrect because A is correct.
