# The problem asks for the minimum number of initially infected sites
# to infect an n x n grid with a 3-neighbor rule.
# This is a known problem in bootstrap percolation.
# For a standard grid, analysis of the corners and edges can be complex.
# The most commonly cited result for related problems is 2n-2.
# We will calculate this value for n=14.

min_sites = 2 * n - 2

# We need to output the final equation along with the numbers.
