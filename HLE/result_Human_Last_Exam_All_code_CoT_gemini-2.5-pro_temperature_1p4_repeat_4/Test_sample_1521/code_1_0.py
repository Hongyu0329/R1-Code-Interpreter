def solve_markov_chain_questions():
  """
  Solves the two conceptual questions about Markov chains.

  The first question is about a chain `p`. The existence of the function `h`
  with the given properties (especially h(x) -> infinity) forces the chain
  to be recurrent. This is because a related martingale must converge to a
  finite value, which is only possible if the chain does not escape to infinity.
  The event of escaping to infinity has to have zero probability, which implies recurrence.

  The second question is about a new chain `q`, which is an h-transform of `p`.
  For this new chain, the function 1/h acts as a non-constant, positive supermartingale.
  The existence of such a function which is not constant implies that the chain
  must be transient. A recurrent chain would revisit states with different 1/h values,
  preventing the supermartingale from converging, which it must.
