    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that explains the process of finding the lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first define what a cap set is and list the known sizes for small dimensions.\n2.  I will explain a common method for finding lower bounds, the \"product construction,\" which combines known cap sets to form larger ones in higher dimensions.\n3.  The script will then calculate several lower bounds for dimension 8 using this method, showing the equations used.\n4.  Finally, after showing the bounds achievable with this simple method, I will state the best-known lower bound, which was found using a more advanced construction, and print it as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_cap_set_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates lower bounds for the size of cap sets\n    in dimension 8, and presents the best-known result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The Cap Set Problem asks for the maximum size of a set of points in an n-dimensional space over the field of 3 elements (F_3^n), such that no three points form a line.\")\n    print(\"This size is denoted as r_3(n).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The exact values of r_3(n) are known for small n:\")\n    known_r3 = {\n        1: 2,\n        2: 4,\n        3: 9,\n        4: 20,\n        5: 45,\n        6: 112\n    }\n    for n, size in known_r3.items():\n        print(f\"r_3({n}) = {size}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFor higher dimensions like n=8, the exact value is unknown.
