    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the independent continuous transformations that leave the equations invariant. The dimension of the group is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra, which is the number of independent infinitesimal generators of these transformations.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the symmetries:\n\n1.  **Time Translation**: The equations do not explicitly depend on time, so they are invariant under a shift in time, $t \\to t + a$. This contributes one generator.\n2.  **Space Translations**: The equations are homogeneous in space, meaning they are invariant under a spatial shift, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}$. In three dimensions, this provides three independent generators.\n3.  **Spatial Rotations**: The equations are isotropic, meaning they are invariant under rotations of the spatial coordinates and the velocity field, $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to R\\mathbf{u}$. The group of rotations in 3D, $SO(3)$, is three-dimensional.\n4.  **Galilean Boosts**: The equations are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame (Galilean transformation): $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$. This gives three independent generators, one for each direction of the boost velocity $\\mathbf{v}$.\n5.  **Scaling Transformation**: The Navier-Stokes equations possess a specific scaling symmetry (also known as a dilation). The transformation is $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p) \\to (\\lambda^2 t, \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\lambda^{-2} p)$. This is a single, one-parameter family of transformations, contributing one generator.\n6.  **Pressure Shift**: The pressure $p$ only appears in the equation through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. Therefore, shifting the pressure by a constant value, $p \\to p + c$, does not alter the equation. This adds one more generator to the algebra.\n\nWhile there exists an infinite-dimensional symmetry group related to shifting the pressure by an arbitrary function of time ($p \\to p + c(t)$), the question is conventionally understood to be about the maximal *finite-dimensional* Lie group of point symmetries. Summing the number of generators from each of these independent families gives the total dimension.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and explains this result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the\n    incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.\n\n    The dimension is found by summing the number of infinitesimal generators\n    corresponding to each family of symmetries.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
