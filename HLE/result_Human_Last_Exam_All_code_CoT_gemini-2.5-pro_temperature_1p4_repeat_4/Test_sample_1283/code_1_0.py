# (a) Determine the general expression for the maximum number of solutions.
# The maximum number of solutions is given by the expression d_P + d_Q + 2,
# where d_P is the degree of polynomial P(x) and d_Q is the degree of Q(x).
expression_a = "d_P + d_Q + 2"

# (b) Calculate the maximum number of solutions for d_P = 3 and d_Q = 2.
d_P = 3
d_Q = 2
constant = 2
result_b = d_P + d_Q + constant
expression_b = f"{d_P} + {d_Q} + {constant} = {result_b}"

# Print the final answer in the required format.
