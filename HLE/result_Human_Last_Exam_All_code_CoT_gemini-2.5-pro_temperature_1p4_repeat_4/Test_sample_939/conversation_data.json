    "An sRGB hex code represents a color within the sRGB color gamut, where each channel (Red, Green, Blue) has a value between 0 and 255. This corresponds to linear sRGB values in the range of [0.0, 1.0]. A ROMM RGB color value can be represented by sRGB if, after conversion, its resulting linear sRGB values all fall within this [0.0, 1.0] range. If any channel is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented.\n\nThe conversion process from ROMM RGB to linear sRGB involves two main steps:\n1.  **Gamma Correction:** ROMM RGB uses a gamma of 1.8. The input values must first be linearized by raising them to the power of 1.8.\n2.  **Matrix Transformation:** The linear ROMM RGB values are then multiplied by a specific 3x3 matrix to convert them to linear sRGB values. This matrix accounts for the different primary colors and white points (D50 for ROMM vs. D65 for sRGB) of the two color spaces.\n\nI will execute a Python script to perform this conversion for each color and check if the results are within the sRGB gamut.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Conversion matrix from linear ProPhoto/ROMM RGB (D50) to linear sRGB (D65)\n    # This matrix is derived from standard color science transformations (Bradford CAT).\n    ROMM_TO_sRGB_MATRIX = np.array([\n        [ 1.34579897, -0.2555801,  -0.05110626],\n        [-0.54462249,  1.5082362,   0.02055107],\n        [ 0.        ,  0.        ,   1.21196756]\n    ])\n\n    colors = {\n        1: np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0]),\n        2: np.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0]),\n        3: np.array([0.0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])\n    }\n    \n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors are out of the sRGB gamut [0, 1]:\\n\")\n\n    for index, romm_rgb_encoded in sorted(colors.items()):\n        \n        # 1.
