    **Analysis of the Board**

    The goal for Black is to capture all White stones. The White stones are currently separated into four vulnerable groups:
    - Group A: (2, 5)
    - Group B: (1, 4)
    - Group C: (3, 4), (3, 3)
    - Group D: (2, 2)

    Black has a strong surrounding wall. White's only hope for survival is to connect these groups and create a living shape with two "eyes" (protected empty points). The critical area for White to make eyes is the empty space defined by points like (2,3), (2,4), and (3,2). Black's winning move must be to occupy the most vital point in this area.

    **Evaluating the Moves**

    Let's analyze the move (2, 4), which corresponds to option G.

    1.  **Black plays at (2, 4).**
        - This move immediately puts the White stone at (2, 5) into "atari" (one move from being captured), as its only remaining liberty is at (1, 5).
        - This is a powerful forcing move. White has no choice but to respond to save the stone.

    2.  **White is forced to play at (1, 5).**
        - If White plays anywhere else, Black will play at (1, 5) and capture the stone at (2, 5), causing White's entire position to collapse.

    3.  **Black plays at the next vital point, (2, 3).**
        - This move puts more pressure on White, now threatening the group at (3, 3) and (3, 4). These stones are now in atari, with their only liberty at (3, 2).

    4.  **White is forced again, this time playing at (3, 2).**
        - White saves the group for the moment but falls further into Black's trap.

    **The Result**

    After this forced sequence, the White stones are split into two distinct groups, neither of which can form two eyes to live.
    - The upper White group can be captured by Black in the next few moves.
    - The lower White group is trapped in a shape known as a "bulky five," which is a dead shape when fully enclosed as it is here.

    Therefore, by playing at (2, 4), Black initiates a sequence that guarantees the eventual capture of all White stones.

    The chosen coordinate is the first move in this winning sequence.
