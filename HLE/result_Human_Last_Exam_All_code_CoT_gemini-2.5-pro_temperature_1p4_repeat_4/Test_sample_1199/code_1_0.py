    # Step 1: Analyze the first call
    # The first call, a->foo(), is a virtual call on a newly allocated object.
    # The compiler doesn't know the object's type at compile time (even though it's 'A' here,
    # it must follow the general mechanism). It must perform a full virtual dispatch.
    # This requires dereferencing the pointer 'a', getting the vptr, and loading the vtable.
    call_1_loads = 1
    print("--- Analysis of Call 1: a->foo() ---")
    print("A new object of type 'A' is created. The first virtual call must look up the virtual table (vtable) to find the address of the correct foo() function.")
    print(f"Result: {call_1_loads} vtable load is required.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 2: Analyze the second call
    # The call to escape(a) means the pointer 'a' "escapes" the current scope of analysis.
    # The compiler cannot prove that the object pointed to by 'a' (and its dynamic type)
    # has not been changed by the escape() function. Therefore, it must be conservative
    # and perform a full virtual dispatch again. It cannot reuse the vtable from the first call.
    call_2_loads = 1
    print("--- Analysis of Call 2: a->foo() after escape(a) ---")
    print("The function 'escape(a)' prevents the compiler from knowing if the object's type has changed.")
    print("To be safe, the compiler must perform another full virtual dispatch, which requires loading the vtable again.")
    print(f"Result: {call_2_loads} vtable load is required.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 3: Analyze the third call
    # The line 'A* b = new(a) B;' is a placement new. The compiler can see this and knows
    # with 100% certainty that at this point in the code, the object at the memory location
    # pointed to by 'b' has the dynamic type 'B'.
    # This allows for an optimization called "devirtualization", where the compiler
    # replaces the virtual call b->foo() with a direct, static call to B::foo().
    # A direct call does not need to look up the vtable.
    call_3_loads = 0
    print("--- Analysis of Call 3: b->foo() after new(a) B ---")
    print("The compiler sees the 'placement new' and knows the object's dynamic type is 'B'.")
    print("This allows for 'devirtualization', turning the virtual call into a direct call.")
    print("A direct function call does not require a vtable lookup.")
    print(f"Result: {call_3_loads} vtable loads are required.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 4: Sum the results
    total_loads = call_1_loads + call_2_loads + call_3_loads
    print("--- Total VTable Loads ---")
    print("The total number of loads is the sum from each call.")
    print(f"Final Equation: {call_1_loads} + {call_2_loads} + {call_3_loads} = {total_loads}")
