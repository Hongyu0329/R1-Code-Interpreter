Since the user requires a Python script, I will then write a simple script that stores this city's name in a variable and prints it as the output.\n\n```python\n# The character Tommaso in the 1997 movie \"Ovosodo\" moves to a US city.\n# This script stores the name of that city in a variable and prints it.\n\ncity = \"Philadelphia\"\nprint(city)\n```\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In the 1997 movie Ovosodo (Hard Boiled Egg), Tommaso – played by Marco Cocci – moves to the United States.
