    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the absolute minimum number of side-sticker colors a person needs to see on the last layer to distinguish any of the 21 possible Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases from each other.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Challenge:** The core of the problem lies in distinguishing the most similar-looking PLL cases. If we can find the minimum information needed for the hardest cases, that number will be the answer for all cases.\n2.  **Focus on the G-Perms:** The four G-permutation cases (Ga, Gb, Gc, Gd) are famously difficult to tell apart. They share a similar structure, and distinguishing them requires observing subtle pattern differences.\n3.  **Analyze the Recognition Pattern:** G-perms are typically identified by looking for two specific patterns on two adjacent faces:\n    *   **\"Headlights\":** On one face, the side-stickers of the two corner pieces are the same color.\n    *   **\"Impure Block\":** On an adjacent face, the three side-stickers (two from corners, one from an edge) form a distinct pattern that is not fully solved. The specific arrangement of colors in this block is what separates the four G-perms.\n4.  **Count the Stickers:**\n    *   To confirm you have \"headlights\", you must look at both corner stickers on that face. That's **2 stickers**.\n    *   To see the entire \"impure block\" pattern on the adjacent face and tell which G-perm you have, you must see all three stickers on that face. That's **3 stickers**.\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** The minimum number required is the sum of stickers needed to see both essential patterns. This gives us our final answer. The code below will walk through this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_sticker_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed\n    to identify a PLL case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The most difficult PLL cases to distinguish are the four G-permutations.\n    # The minimum number of stickers required must be sufficient to tell them apart.\n    # Recognition relies on identifying a \"headlight\" pattern on one face and\n    # a specific \"block\" pattern on an adjacent face.\n\n    # 1.
