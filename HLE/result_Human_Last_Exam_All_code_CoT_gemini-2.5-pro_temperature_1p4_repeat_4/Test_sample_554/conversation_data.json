    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar,\" we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the base molecule**: The term \"nanocar\" refers to a class of molecular machines. The original and most well-known version has a chassis with the chemical formula C₃₀H₂₀.\n2.  **Understand the prefix \"perfluoro-\"**: In organic chemistry, \"perfluoro-\" signifies that all hydrogen (H) atoms on the carbon backbone have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n3.  **Calculate the number of fluorine atoms**: We count the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar chassis (C₃₀H₂₀), which is 20. In the perfluorinated version, these 20 hydrogen atoms would be replaced by 20 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe resulting script will perform this simple substitution and print the explanation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the number of hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar chassis (C30H20).\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 20\n\n# Step 2: In a \"perfluoro-\" compound, all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms equals the number of hydrogen atoms.\nnum_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms\n\n# Step 3: Print the logic and the final equation.\nprint(\"A standard nanocar chassis has the chemical formula C30H20.\")\nprint(\"The prefix 'perfluoro-' indicates that all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\nprint(\"The equation is based on this replacement:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Hydrogen Atoms = {num_hydrogen_atoms}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Fluorine Atoms = {num_fluorine_atoms}\")\n\n```\n<<<20>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Hypothetically, how many fluorine atoms would a perfluoronanocar contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
