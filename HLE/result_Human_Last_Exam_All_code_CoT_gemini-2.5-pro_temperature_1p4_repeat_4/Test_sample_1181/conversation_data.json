    "This is a knowledge-based question about the 1972 film *Solaris*. My plan is to identify the character who spoke the line in question by recalling the plot and dialogue of the movie. I will then write a Python script that explains the reasoning and prints the correct answer choice.\n\nThe character who expresses this specific nostalgic sentiment is Dr. Snaut. In a conversation with Kris Kelvin, Snaut reflects on the futility of their cosmic exploration, suggesting that humanity is really just looking for a mirror of itself. It is in this context that he confesses, \"You know, sometimes I'm ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This line poignantly captures his weariness and longing for home.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the characters from the 1972 movie 'Solaris' to determine\n    which one misses the sound of rustling leaves.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"In the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie Solaris which character is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth?\"\n    \n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Kris',\n        'B': 'Hari',\n        'C': 'Snaut',\n        'D': 'Sartorius',\n        'E': 'Gibarian'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the characters and their dialogue in 'Solaris' (1972):\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    print(\"1.
