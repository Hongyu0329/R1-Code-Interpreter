    "Based on the principles of crystallography and optics, there is a fundamental contradiction in the question. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Optical Activity**: For a material to be optically active (i.e., to rotate the plane of polarized light), it must be **chiral**.\n2.  **Chirality**: In crystallography, a chiral structure is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This means its point group symmetry must **not** contain any improper rotation axes (Symmetry elements of the second kind), which include a center of inversion (i) or a mirror plane (m).\n3.  **Achiral**: The user has specified the crystal class must be **achiral**. This is the exact opposite of chiral. An achiral crystal class **must** possess a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\n4.  **Contradiction**: A crystal class cannot be simultaneously chiral (a requirement for optical activity) and achiral. These two conditions are mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, no crystal class can be both achiral and optically active. To demonstrate this, the following Python script defines the sets for optically active, achiral, and non-polar crystal classes and shows that their intersection is empty.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef print_wrapped(text):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to print text with wrapping for better readability.\"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.fill(text, width=80))\n\n# --- Define Crystal Class Sets ---\n\n# All 32 point groups\nall_crystal_classes = {\n    \"1\", \"-1\", \"2\", \"m\", \"2/m\", \"222\", \"mm2\", \"mmm\", \"4\", \"-4\", \"4/m\",\n    \"422\", \"4mm\", \"-42m\", \"4/mmm\", \"3\", \"-3\", \"32\", \"3m\", \"-3m\", \"6\",\n    \"-6\", \"6/m\", \"622\", \"6mm\", \"-6m2\", \"6/mmm\", \"23\", \"m-3\", \"432\",\n    \"-43m\", \"m-3m\"\n}\n\n# 1.

Achiral Classes: These are all classes that are NOT chiral.\nachiral_classes = all_crystal_classes - optically_active_classes\n\n# 3. Non-polar Classes: These are the 11 centrosymmetric classes, which possess a center of inversion.\n# All non-polar classes are inherently achiral.\nnon_polar_classes = {\"-1\", \"2/m\", \"mmm\", \"4/m\", \"-3\", \"6/m\", \"4/mmm\", \"-3m\", \"6/mmm\", \"m-3\", \"m-3m\"}\n\n# --- Analysis ---\n\nprint(\"--- Analysis of Crystal Properties for Optical Activity ---\")\nprint_wrapped(\"\\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\nprint_wrapped(\"\\nStep 1: The primary requirement for optical activity is that the crystal must be CHIRAL.
