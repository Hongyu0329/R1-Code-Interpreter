# The analysis shows that for the given types of sets (subspaces of metric spaces),
# the property of being "closepact" is equivalent to being "compact".
# The sets that are necessarily compact are:
# C: A finite subset of the complex numbers.
# G: The set containing a bounded monotonic sequence and its limit point in the real numbers.
# J: A closed interval in the reals.
# M: The Cantor Set.

# The final answer is a string concatenating these letters.
