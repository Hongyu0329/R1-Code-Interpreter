# Plan:
# 1. Identify the Roman numerals of the translation practices capable of solving the core challenge.
#    The valid options are I, II, IV, and VI.
# 2. Store these options in a list to represent the individual "numbers" (Roman numerals)
#    that make up the final answer.
# 3. Join the elements of the list with a hyphen to create the final formatted string.
#    The join operation uses each "number" to construct the final "equation" or string.
# 4. Print the result.
