    "This is a number sequence puzzle. To find the missing number, we need to identify the pattern governing the sequence.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n1.  **Analyze the primary sequence**: The given sequence is `2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ...`. Let's denote the terms as `x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, ...`.\n2.  **Look for a simple recurrence relation**: Observe the relationship between consecutive terms. The numbers are roughly doubling. Let's express each term `x_n` in relation to the previous term `x_{n-1}`.\n    *   `x_2 = 11`\n    *   `x_3 = 23 = 2 * 11 + 1`\n    *   `x_4 = 51 = 2 * 23 + 5`\n    *   `x_5 = 119 = 2 * 51 + 17`\n    This reveals a pattern of the form `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + k` for `n >= 3`. The numbers added (`k`) form a new sequence.\n3.  **Analyze the secondary sequence (the added numbers)**: Let's call the sequence of added numbers `k_m`.\n    *   From `x_3 = 2 * x_2 + k_1`, we get `23 = 2 * 11 + k_1` => `k_1 = 1`.\n    *   From `x_4 = 2 * x_3 + k_2`, we get `51 = 2 * 23 + k_2` => `k_2 = 5`.\n    *   From `x_5 = 2 * x_4 + k_3`, we get `119 = 2 * 51 + k_3` => `k_3 = 17`.\n    So, the sequence of added numbers is `1, 5, 17, ...`.\n4.  **Find the pattern in the secondary sequence**: Now, let's find the rule for the sequence `k = [1, 5, 17, ...]`.\n    *   `k_2 = 5 = 3 * 1 + 2 = 3 * k_1 + 2`.\n    *   `k_3 = 17 = 3 * 5 + 2 = 3 * k_2 + 2`.\n    The pattern is `k_m = 3 * k_{m-1} + 2`.\n5.  **Calculate the next term in the secondary sequence**: We need `k_4` to find `x_6`.\n    *   `k_4 = 3 * k_3 + 2 = 3 * 17 + 2 = 51 + 2 = 53`.\n6.  **Calculate the missing term in the primary sequence**: Now we can find `x_6`.\n    *   `x_6 = 2 * x_5 + k_4 = 2 * 119 + 53`.\n    *   `x_6 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n\nThe missing number in the parentheses is 291.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by identifying a two-level pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    # Step 1: Find the secondary sequence 'k' where x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + k_{n-2} for n >= 3\n    k = []\n    # k_1 corresponds to the calculation of x_3\n    k.append(x[2] - 2 * x[1])\n    # k_2 corresponds to the calculation of x_4\n    k.append(x[3] - 2 * x[2])\n    # k_3 corresponds to the calculation of x_5\n    k.append(x[4] - 2 * x[3])\n\n    # print(f\"The primary sequence is: {x}\")\n    # print(f\"The secondary sequence 'k' is: {k}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Find the pattern in 'k'.
