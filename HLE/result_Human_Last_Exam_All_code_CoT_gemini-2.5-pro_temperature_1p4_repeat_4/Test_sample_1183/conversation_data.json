    "To find the symmetry group of the molecule, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I'll use the cheminformatics library RDKit to interpret the SMILES string and build a 3D model of the molecule. The SMILES string represents a large, complex, and highly symmetric molecule, likely a derivative of triangulene.\n2.  To get a realistic 3D structure, I'll first generate 2D coordinates to ensure the aromatic system is flat, then embed it in 3D, and finally, optimize the geometry using the MMFF94s force field, which is well-suited for conjugated systems.\n3.  Next, I'll extract the atomic symbols and their optimized 3D coordinates.\n4.  Finally, I will use the PySCF library, a tool for quantum chemistry calculations, which has a powerful feature for detecting molecular symmetry. I'll feed the atomic coordinates into PySCF, which will analyze them and report the molecule's point group according to Schoenflies notation (e.g., C2v, D6h, etc.).\n\nThis computational approach is the most reliable way to determine the symmetry for such a complex molecule.\n\n```python\n# This script requires the 'rdkit' and 'pyscf' libraries.\n# You can install them using pip:\n# pip install rdkit-pypi pyscf\n\nimport sys\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n    from pyscf import gto\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: A required library is not installed.
