    # Based on a step-by-step analysis of Python's truthiness and operator
    # evaluation rules, the following statements were determined to be true:
    #
    # D) For a non-empty (truthy) set s, `s and True` returns `True`, and
    #    `True and s` returns `s`. This is correct behavior for the `and` operator.
    # E) For two falsy objects like `{}` and `[]`, `falsy1 or falsy2` evaluates to
    #    `falsy2`. The statement correctly describes this behavior.
    # F) The identity `bool(x and y) == (bool(x) and bool(y))` holds for all objects
    #    x and y in Python. It's a fundamental property of the `and` operator.
    # I) The `and` operator is associative, meaning the order of evaluation for
    #    chained `and` operations does not change the result.
    
    true_statements = ['D', 'E', 'F', 'I']
    
    # The problem asks for the letter choices in sorted order.
    # The list is already sorted alphabetically.
