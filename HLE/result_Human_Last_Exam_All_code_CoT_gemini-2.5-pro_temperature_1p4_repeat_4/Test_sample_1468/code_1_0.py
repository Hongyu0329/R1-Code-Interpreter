    # Problem parameters (symbolic)
    # N: number of data points
    # q: sparsity
    # d': dimension of data vectors z_i
    # d: input dimension for one row (d = d' + q + 1)
    # m: number of neurons in the hidden layer

    # Goal: Find the asymptotic lower bound for m.
    
    # Summary of the derivation:
    # 1. The problem is to find a lower bound on m for a network f(x) = g(Wx)
    #    that approximates the qSA function.
    #
    # 2. The strategy is a dimensionality argument. We construct a set of inputs
    #    that the network must be able to distinguish. If the hidden dimension m
    #    is too small, the linear map W will merge these distinct inputs, making
    #    the task impossible.
    #
    # 3. We construct pairs of inputs (X_A, X_B) that differ only in a single
    #    pointer value in one of the y_i vectors. For example, for row i,
    #    y_i in X_A points to a set of indices A, and in X_B it points to set B,
    #    where A and B differ by one index.
    #
    # 4. We show that the true qSA outputs for these inputs are different.
    #    Specifically, ||qSA(X_A)_i - qSA(X_B)_i||_2 = sqrt(2)/q.
    #
    # 5. The approximation error is epsilon = 1/(2q).
    #    The triangle inequality implies ||f(X_A)_i - f(X_B)_i||_2 >= (sqrt(2)-1)/q > 0.
    #    This means the network must distinguish these inputs, so W*vec(X_A) != W*vec(X_B).
    #
    # 6. The difference vector v = vec(X_A) - vec(X_B) is non-zero in only one
    #    component, corresponding to the single pointer y_{i,j} that was changed.
    #    This means a canonical basis vector e_k (for that component) cannot be in the
    #    null space of W.
    #
    # 7. We can repeat this for each of the N rows (i=1..N) and for each of the q
    #    pointers in the y_i vector (j=1..q). This generates N*q distinct canonical
    #    basis vectors that must not be in the null space of W.
    #
    # 8. These N*q vectors span a space S of dimension Nq. Since S intersects the
    #    null space of W trivially, we must have dim(S) + dim(ker(W)) <= Nd.
    #
    # 9. Using dim(ker(W)) >= Nd - m, we get:
    #    Nq + (Nd - m) <= Nd
    #    Nq <= m
    #
    # 10. The asymptotic lower bound for m is therefore Omega(Nq).
    
    # This problem asks for the asymptotic bound, not a specific value.
    # Printing the logic and result as a string.

    # The final equation is m >= N*q

    print(f"The dimension of this space provides a lower bound for m.")
    print(f"The resulting inequality is: m >= {N_str}*{q_str}")
    print(f"Thus, the asymptotic lower bound for m is Omega({N_str}{q_str}).")
