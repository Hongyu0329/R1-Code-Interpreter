    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the great icosahedron and its outer hull.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Outer Hull:** The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its \"outer hull\" (or more formally, its convex hull) is the smallest convex shape that encloses it. For the great icosahedron, the convex hull is a **regular icosahedron**.\n2.  **Analyze the Surface:** The question asks for the number of triangles needed to triangulate the surface of this outer hull. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose surface is already composed of triangular faces.\n3.  **Count the Triangles:** The task therefore simplifies to counting the number of faces on a regular icosahedron. A standard regular icosahedron has 20 faces. Since these faces are already triangles, this is the minimal number required for a triangulation.\n4.  **Code the Result:** I will write a Python script to state this logic and print the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_triangulation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating\n    the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: The outer hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n    # A regular icosahedron is a convex polyhedron.\n    \n    # Step 2: The surface of a regular icosahedron is already composed of triangles.\n    # The number of triangles in a minimal triangulation is therefore its number of faces.\n    \n    # Step 3: A regular icosahedron has 20 faces.\n    num_faces_of_icosahedron = 20\n    \n    print(\"The outer hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\n    print(\"The surface of a regular icosahedron is already triangulated by its own faces.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the minimal number of triangles is the number of faces of the icosahedron.\")\n    \n    # Final equation and result\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Number of Triangles = Number of Faces\")\n    print(f\"Number of Triangles = {num_faces_of_icosahedron}\")\n\nsolve_triangulation()\n```\n<<<20>>>"
