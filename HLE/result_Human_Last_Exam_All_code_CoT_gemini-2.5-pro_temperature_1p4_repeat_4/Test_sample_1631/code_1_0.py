    This function analyzes the provided multiple-choice question about sheet metal forming.

    The core of the question is the purpose of "bypass notches". In sheet metal stamping,
    the goal is to make a flat blank flow into a 3D die cavity without defects like
    cracks or wrinkles.

    - Complex geometries (like sharp corners or deep sections) can restrict this material flow.
    - If material cannot flow easily into one area, it will be stretched excessively, causing thinning (Option I) and potential cracks.
    - A "bypass notch" is a strategically placed cut that provides an easier path for the material to flow around these restrictive features and into the necessary areas.

    Therefore, the most direct and fundamental reason for these notches is to solve issues with material inflow.

    Let's analyze the best option:
    - Option D: "To counteract issues of material inflow into forming cavities around complex geometries of the workpiece (e.g. small radii, zero draft angles, etc.)"
    - This option directly describes the primary mechanism and purpose of a bypass notch. By improving material inflow, other problems like excessive thinning (Option I) are subsequently prevented.

    Thus, D is the correct answer.
    """
    # The final answer is determined by identifying the primary function of bypass notches.
    final_answer = 'D'

    # The final equation is simply the correct choice.
    # We print the components of this "equation", which is just the final answer itself.
