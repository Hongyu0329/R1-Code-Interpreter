    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimension of the bosonic sector of the relevant supersymmetric sigma-model target space.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Space:** For disordered systems of symmetry class D with `N` replicas, the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model is the super-coset space `G/H = Osp(2N, 2N) / (Osp(N, N) x Osp(N, N))`.\n2.  **Identify the Bosonic Sector:** The non-Grassman (bosonic) variables parametrize the bosonic part of this supermanifold. The dimension of this bosonic sector is given by the difference in the dimensions of the bosonic parts of the supergroups G and H: `dim_B(G/H) = dim_B(G) - dim_B(H)`.\n3.  **Use the Dimension Formula:** The dimension of the bosonic part of an orthosymplectic supergroup `Osp(M, 2K)` is the sum of the dimensions of its maximal bosonic subgroup, `O(M) x Sp(2K)`.\n    *   `dim(O(M)) = M * (M - 1) / 2`\n    *   `dim(Sp(2K)) = K * (2K + 1)`\n    *   Therefore, `dim_B(Osp(M, 2K)) = M * (M - 1) / 2 + K * (2K + 1)`.\n4.  **Calculate for N=2:** We will apply this formula for the specific case where `N=2`.\n    *   For the group `G = Osp(2N, 2N) = Osp(4, 4)`, we have `M=4` and `2K=4` (so `K=2`).\n    *   For the subgroup `H = Osp(N, N) x Osp(N, N) = Osp(2, 2) x Osp(2, 2)`, we first calculate the dimension for one `Osp(2, 2)` component, where `M=2` and `2K=2` (so `K=1`), and then multiply by two.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Subtract the dimension of H from the dimension of G to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Number of replicas\nN = 2\n\n# This script calculates the number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables\n# for the supersymmetric sigma-model of disordered systems in symmetry class D\n# with N=2 replicas.
