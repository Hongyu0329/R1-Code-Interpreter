    "In this Connect 4 game, it's player 'O's turn to move. To find the optimal moves, we need to find the moves that lead to a win in the shortest number of turns. The fastest win is an immediate win (a \"win in 1\"). If that's not possible, we look for a move that guarantees a win on the next turn (a \"win in 2\"), which is typically achieved by creating a \"fork\" â€“ two simultaneous threats that the opponent can only block one of.\n\nHere is the plan to find the optimal moves:\n1.  **Represent the Board**: First, the given board state is converted into a data structure, like a 2D array or list of lists.\n2.  **Analyze Immediate Wins (Win in 1)**: The program will check all valid moves for 'O'. For each potential move, it will see if placing a piece there results in four 'O's in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). In this specific game state, there are no immediate winning moves for 'O'.\n3.  **Analyze Forced Wins (Win in 2)**: Since there's no immediate win, the program will look for moves that create a forced win on the next turn. This involves creating two separate threats at the same time.\n    *   The key observation is in row 4, where 'O' has two pieces next to each other (`d4`, `e4`).\n    *   By playing in column `c` (move `c4`) or column `f` (move `f4`), 'O' can create an open-ended three-in-a-row (`.OOO.` pattern).\n    *   For example, playing `c4` creates the line `c4-d4-e4`, threatening to win at both `b4` and `f4`. The opponent 'X' can only block one of these spots, allowing 'O' to win on the other side on the next turn.\n    *   Similarly, playing `f4` creates the line `d4-e4-f4`, threatening both `c4` and `g4`.\n4.  **Final Output**: The code will identify these two moves (`c4` and `f4`) as the optimal ones because they guarantee the fastest possible win. It will then format the output as requested.\n\nThe Python code below implements this logic by simulating each possible move for 'O' and determining if it creates a situation where the opponent 'X' cannot prevent a win on 'O's subsequent turn.\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\ndef solve_connect_four():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given Connect 4 board state to find the optimal moves for player 'O'.\n    An optimal move is one that leads to a win in the minimum number of turns.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Setup ---\n    ROWS = 6\n    COLS = 7\n    PLAYER_O = 'O'\n    PLAYER_X = 'X'\n    EMPTY = '.'\n\n    # The board state as given in the problem\n    board = [\n        [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY],\n        [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY],\n        [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY],\n        [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, PLAYER_O, PLAYER_O, EMPTY, EMPTY],\n        [PLAYER_O, EMPTY, PLAYER_X, PLAYER_O, PLAYER_X, PLAYER_X, PLAYER_X],\n        [PLAYER_X, PLAYER_O, PLAYER_O, PLAYER_X, PLAYER_X, PLAYER_O, PLAYER_X],\n    ]\n\n    # --- Helper Functions ---\n    def get_valid_moves(b):\n        \"\"\"Returns a list of columns that are not full.\"\"\"\n        return [c for c in range(COLS) if b[0][c] == EMPTY]\n\n    def get_next_open_row(b, col):\n        \"\"\"Returns the row index where a piece would fall.\"\"\"\n        for r in range(ROWS - 1, -1, -1):\n            if b[r][col] == EMPTY:\n                return r\n        return None\n\n    def drop_piece(b, col, piece):\n        \"\"\"Returns a new board state after dropping a piece.\"\"\"\n        b_copy = copy.deepcopy(b)\n        row = get_next_open_row(b_copy, col)\n        if row is not None:\n            b_copy[row][col] = piece\n        return b_copy\n\n    def check_win(b, piece):\n        \"\"\"Checks if the specified player has won.\"\"\"\n        # Horizontal check\n        for r in range(ROWS):\n            for c in range(COLS - 3):\n                if all(b[r][c+i] == piece for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        # Vertical check\n        for c in range(COLS):\n            for r in range(ROWS - 3):\n                if all(b[r+i][c] == piece for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        # Diagonal (down-right) check\n        for r in range(ROWS - 3):\n            for c in range(COLS - 3):\n                if all(b[r+i][c+i] == piece for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        # Diagonal (up-right) check\n        for r in range(3, ROWS):\n            for c in range(COLS - 3):\n                if all(b[r-i][c+i] == piece for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    # --- Main Logic ---\n\n    optimal_moves = []\n    \n    # First, check for any immediate winning moves (win in 1)\n    for move_col in get_valid_moves(board):\n        temp_board = drop_piece(board, move_col, PLAYER_O)\n        if check_win(temp_board, PLAYER_O):\n            optimal_moves.append(move_col)\n    \n    # If no win in 1, search for a win in 2 (a move creating a fork)\n    if not optimal_moves:\n        for move_col in get_valid_moves(board):\n            board_after_o = drop_piece(board, move_col, PLAYER_O)\n            \n            # This move is a \"fork\" if for ALL opponent replies, 'O' can win.\n            is_a_fork = True\n            opponent_moves = get_valid_moves(board_after_o)\n            \n            # If the opponent has no moves, it's a draw, not a win.\n            if not opponent_moves:\n                is_a_fork = False\n\n            for opp_col in opponent_moves:\n                board_after_x = drop_piece(board_after_o, opp_col, PLAYER_X)\n                \n                # Check if 'O' has at least one winning move now\n                has_o_win = False\n                for o_final_col in get_valid_moves(board_after_x):\n                    if check_win(drop_piece(board_after_x, o_final_col, PLAYER_O), PLAYER_O):\n                        has_o_win = True\n                        break\n                \n                if not has_o_win:\n                    # Opponent found a reply to stop the win, so it wasn't a fork.\n                    is_a_fork = False\n                    break\n            \n            if is_a_fork:\n                optimal_moves.append(move_col)\n\n    # --- Format and Print Output ---\n    if not optimal_moves:\n        print(\"No optimal winning moves found.\")\n    else:\n        final_moves_str = []\n        col_names = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']\n        \n        optimal_moves.sort()\n        \n        for col_idx in optimal_moves:\n            row_idx = get_next_open_row(board, col_idx)\n            row_notation = ROWS - row_idx\n            final_moves_str.append(f\"{col_names[col_idx]}{row_notation}\")\n            \n        print(\", \".join(final_moves_str))\n\nsolve_connect_four()\n```\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
