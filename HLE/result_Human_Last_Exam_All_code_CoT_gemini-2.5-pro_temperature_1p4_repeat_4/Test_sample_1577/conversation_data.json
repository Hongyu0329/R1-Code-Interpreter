    "This problem asks for the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a surface with a given number of smooth and rough holes. The GSD depends on the topology of the surface.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD):** The GSD of a topological code is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code can store.\n2.  **Logical Qubits and Topology:** The number of logical qubits, `k`, is determined by the topology of the 2D surface on which the code is defined. Specifically, it depends on the genus `g` (the number of \"handles\" on the surface) and the number and type of boundaries (holes).\n3.  **Formulas for Logical Qubits:** For the toric code (`D(Z_2)` quantum double model) on a surface of genus `g` with `n` smooth boundaries and `m` rough boundaries, the number of logical qubits `k` is given by the following established formulas:\n    *   If there are both smooth and rough boundaries (`n > 0` and `m > 0`): `k = 2g + n + m - 2`\n    *   If there are only smooth boundaries (`n > 0`, `m = 0`): `k = g + n - 1`\n    *   If there are only rough boundaries (`n = 0`, `m > 0`): `k = g + m - 1`\n    *   If there are no boundaries (a closed surface, `n = m = 0`): `k = 2g`\n\n4.  **Interpreting the Question:** The question mentions the \"toric code\". This name comes from the fact that the model was first introduced on a torus. The torus is a surface with genus `g=1`. While the model can be defined on any surface, in the absence of other specifications, assuming the surface is a torus (`g=1`) is a standard interpretation. The question also mentions `n` and `m` \"holes\", which implies we are in a situation with boundaries, so `n + m > 0`.\n\n5.  **Calculating `k` for a Torus (`g=1`):** Let's apply the formulas from Step 3 with `g=1`, considering all cases where `n+m > 0`.\n    *   Case 1: `n > 0` and `m > 0`.\n        `k = 2(1) + n + m - 2 = 2 + n + m - 2 = n + m`.\n    *   Case 2: `n > 0` and `m = 0`.\n        `k = 1 + n - 1 = n`. This is equal to `n + m` since `m=0`.\n    *   Case 3: `n = 0` and `m > 0`.\n        `k = 1 + m - 1 = m`. This is equal to `n + m` since `n=0`.\n\n6.  **The Unified Formula:** In all cases where there is at least one hole (`n+m > 0`), the number of logical qubits on a torus (`g=1`) is simply `k = n + m`.\n\n7.  **Final Result:** The ground space degeneracy is `GSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m)`. This corresponds to option A.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value for example `n` and `m` values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a torus\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes (must be non-negative).\n        m (int): The number of rough holes (must be non-negative).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0 or m < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Number of holes cannot be negative.\")\n        return\n\n    # The problem implies there are holes, so n + m > 0.\n    # On a torus (g=1), the number of logical qubits k is n + m.\n    # The ground space degeneracy is 2^k.\n    # Let's check the n=0, m=0 case for completeness (a closed torus).\n    # In that case, k=2g=2.
