    "To find an upper bound for the braid index of the three-twist knot (also known as the $6_1$ knot or stevedore knot) using Vogel's algorithm, we will follow a systematic process.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand Vogel's Algorithm:** The algorithm operates on the Seifert graph of a knot diagram. The upper bound for the braid index is calculated as `min(w)` over all possible root choices, where `w = max(depth(u) + depth(v) + 1)` for all edges `(u,v)` in the graph. The `depth` is the shortest distance from a chosen root vertex.\n2.  **Determine the Seifert Graph of the Three-Twist Knot:** From the standard alternating diagram of the three-twist knot, we can determine its Seifert graph. This knot has 6 crossings and its diagram can be resolved into 5 Seifert circles. The resulting graph has 5 vertices and 6 edges. It consists of a central circle and an outer circle, which are both connected to three \"ear\" circles.\n3.  **Implement the Algorithm in Python:**\n    *   We will represent the Seifert graph using an adjacency list.\n    *   For each unique vertex type (central, ear, outer), we will select it as the root and calculate the depths of all other vertices using a Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n    *   For each root, we will iterate through all edges to find the maximum value of `depth(u) + depth(v) + 1`, which gives the `w` for that root. We will print each step of this calculation.\n    *   Finally, we will find the minimum `w` among all choices of the root. This minimum value is the upper bound given by the algorithm.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_vogel_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the braid index upper bound for the three-twist knot (6_1)\n    using Vogel's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
