# The obfuscated Javascript, once corrected, executes 'console.log(58)'.
# The final equation is effectively log(58).
# The numbers making up the logged value are 5 and 8.
# Let's represent these numbers in variables as requested.
number_one = 5
number_two = 8

# The final output of the javascript code is the number 58,
# which is composed of these two digits. The 'print' function
# below simulates the 'console.log' from the javascript code.
print(str(number_one) + str(number_two))
