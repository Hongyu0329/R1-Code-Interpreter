    Solves the problem of finding the number of homeomorphism classes

    # The problem defines the "disconnection number" of a compact connected metric space X
    # as the smallest integer 'n' such that removing ANY 'n' distinct points
    # leaves the space disconnected.
    # We are looking for the number of homeomorphism classes of spaces where this number is 4.

    # Step 1: Identify the relevant mathematical theorem.
    # This problem is solved by a classical result in topology by G. T. Whyburn.
    # The theorem on cyclic connectivity states that for n >= 2, a Peano continuum
    # (a type of well-behaved compact connected metric space that includes graphs)
    # has a disconnection number of 'n' if and only if it is homeomorphic
    # to a graph made of two vertices joined by 'n' distinct arcs.
    # We can denote this special graph as G_n.

    # Step 2: Apply the theorem to the specific case where the disconnection number is 4.
    disconnection_number_n = 4

    # According to the theorem, a space X has a disconnection number of 4
    # if and only if X is homeomorphic to the graph G_4.
    # G_4 is a graph with two vertices connected by four distinct arcs.

    # Step 3: Determine the number of homeomorphism classes.
    # A homeomorphism class is a set of all topological spaces that are equivalent
    # under continuous deformation (homeomorphic). All graphs constructed as G_4
    # are homeomorphic to each other. For example, two points joined by four semicircles
    # is homeomorphic to a square with two diagonals where we consider only the two
    # opposite corners as the main vertices. More formally, there is only one
    # topological structure corresponding to G_n for any given n.

    # Therefore, all spaces with a disconnection number of 4 belong to a single
    # homeomorphism class.
