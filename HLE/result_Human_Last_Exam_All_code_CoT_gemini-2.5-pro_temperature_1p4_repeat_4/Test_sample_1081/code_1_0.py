# The task is to find the number of Fq-rational maximal tori in a group of type E8.
# This can be calculated using a formula based on the group's structure.

# For a split reductive group G over a finite field Fq, the number of
# Fq-rational maximal tori is q^(2*N), where N is the number of positive roots.

# Step 1: Define the properties of the E8 group.
# The rank of E8, l.
rank_E8 = 8
# The dimension of E8, dim(G).
dim_E8 = 248

# Step 2: Calculate the number of positive roots, N.
# The formula relating dimension, rank, and positive roots is dim(G) = 2*N + l.
# So, N = (dim(G) - l) / 2.
num_positive_roots = (dim_E8 - rank_E8) // 2

# Step 3: Calculate the final exponent, which is 2*N.
exponent = 2 * num_positive_roots

# Step 4: Display the final equation, showing each number involved.
