    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request**:\n    *   **Objects**: We are given `J`, an upper semilattice, and `f`, a \"tame\" functor from `J` to the category of vector spaces over a field `K`, denoted `Vect_K`.\n    *   **Question**: For what integer `n` is `f` said to be `n`-resolvable?\n    *   **Constraints**: Provide the solution as Python code, explaining the steps and explicitly printing the numbers in the final equation that determines `n`.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms**:\n    *   **Upper Semilattice (`J`)**: A partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements `x` and `y` have a least upper bound (or join), denoted `x ∨ y`.\n    *   **Functor `f: J -> Vect_K`**: This is a representation of the poset `J`. It assigns a vector space `f(j)` to each element `j ∈ J` and a linear map `f(i) -> f(j)` to each relation `i ≤ j` in `J`, respecting composition.\n    *   **`n`-resolvable**: In homological algebra, an object `M` is `n`-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most `n-1`. This means its projective dimension, `pd(M)`, is less than or equal to `n-1`. So, we need to find the maximum possible projective dimension for our functor `f`.\n    *   **Tame Functor**: In representation theory, \"tame\" refers to a class of representations with a certain \"low\" complexity. This term suggests we are in the realm of representation theory of posets/algebras. However, as we will see, the bound on `n` comes from a more general property of the underlying structure `J`, making this condition less critical to the final number.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Homological Strategy**:\n    *   The problem boils down to finding an upper bound for the projective dimension `pd(f)`.\n    *   The homological properties of the category of representations of `J`, `Rep(J, K)`, are determined by the structure of the poset `J`. This category is equivalent to the category of modules over the incidence algebra `K[J]`. The global dimension of this category gives us an upper bound on `pd(f)` for any `f`.\n    *   The crucial insight comes from considering the dual of the poset `J`. If `J` is an upper semilattice (with joins `∨`), its opposite poset `J^op` is a lower semilattice (with meets `∧`).\n    *   The global dimension of `Rep(J, K)` is equal to the global dimension of `Rep(J^op, K)`.\n\n4.  **Apply a Known Theorem**:\n    *   A key result in the homological algebra of posets states that for any lower semilattice `P`, the global dimension of its category of representations is at most 2.\n    *   `gldim(Rep(P, K)) ≤ 2` if `P` is a lower semilattice.\n    *   This result can be demonstrated by constructing a specific projective resolution (the Fossum-Iversen resolution) for any module, which is guaranteed to terminate after at most two steps.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Result**:\n    *   Since `J` is an upper semilattice, `J^op` is a lower semilattice.\n    *   Therefore, `gldim(Rep(J^op, K)) ≤ 2`.\n    *   This implies `gldim(Rep(J, K)) ≤ 2`.\n    *   The global dimension being at most 2 means that any functor `f: J -> Vect_K` must have a projective dimension `pd(f) ≤ 2`.\n    *   Now we relate this back to the definition of `n`-resolvable: `pd(f) ≤ n - 1`.\n    *   Setting the maximum possible projective dimension equal to `n-1`, we get the equation: `2 = n - 1`.\n\n6.  **Solve for `n`**:\n    *   Solving `2 = n - 1` for `n` gives `n = 3`.\n    *   Therefore, any such functor `f` is **3-resolvable**.\n\n7.  **Construct the Code**:\n    *   I will write a Python script that codifies this line of reasoning.\n    *   The script will use `print` statements to explain each step.\n    *   As requested, it will explicitly print the numbers in the final equation: `n - 1 = 2`, which leads to the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_resolvability():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the value 'n' for which a tame functor on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Understand the terminology.\n    # A functor 'f' is \"n-resolvable\" if its projective dimension, pd(f), is at most n-1.\n    # The task is to find the maximum possible projective dimension for any such functor.\n    # Our goal is to solve the equation: pd(f)_max = n - 1.\n\n    # Step 2: Use a key theorem from homological algebra.\n    # A poset J is an \"upper semilattice\".
