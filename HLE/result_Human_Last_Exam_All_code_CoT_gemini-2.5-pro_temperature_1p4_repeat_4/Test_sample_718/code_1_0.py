    # Step 1: Understand the terminology.
    # A functor 'f' is "n-resolvable" if its projective dimension, pd(f), is at most n-1.
    # The task is to find the maximum possible projective dimension for any such functor.
    # Our goal is to solve the equation: pd(f)_max = n - 1.

    # Step 2: Use a key theorem from homological algebra.
    # A poset J is an "upper semilattice". A key result states that the global
    # homological dimension of the category of representations of an upper semilattice is at most 2.
    # This provides a universal bound on the projective dimension of any functor in this category.
    # The condition that the functor is "tame" is satisfied because having a finite
    # projective dimension is a much stronger condition than being tame.
