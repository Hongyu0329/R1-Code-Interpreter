    "To solve this problem, I will write a Python script to count the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n### My Plan\n1.  **Understand the notation**: The notation \\(av_n^k(\\pi)\\) represents the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) that have exactly \\(k\\) inversions and avoid the pattern \\(\\pi\\).\n2.  **The specific problem**: We need to find \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\). This means we are looking for the number of permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n3.  **Key Insight**: For a small number of inversions \\(k\\), the number \\(av_n^k(\\pi)\\) becomes independent of \\(n\\) as long as \\(n\\) is large enough. A common rule of thumb is that the value stabilizes for \\(n \\ge 2k\\). In our case, \\(k=3\\), so we expect the value to be the same for any \\(n \\ge 6\\). Since \\(n=333\\) is much larger than 6, we can solve the problem for a smaller value of \\(n\\), for example, \\(n=7\\), and the result will be the same for \\(n=333\\).\n4.  **Algorithm**:\n    *   I will write a Python script that uses the `itertools` library to generate all permutations of a manageable length (I'll use n=7).\n    *   For each permutation, I will implement two helper functions:\n        *   `count_inversions(p)`: This function will count the number of inversions in a permutation `p`. An inversion is a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `p[i] > p[j]`.\n        *   `has_1324_pattern(p)`: This function will check if a permutation `p` contains the 1324 pattern. A permutation contains the 1324 pattern if there exist four indices `i < j < k < l` such that `p[i] < p[k] < p[j] < p[l]`.\n    *   The main script will iterate through all generated permutations. It will count how many of them have exactly 3 inversions and do not contain the 1324 pattern.\n5.  **Final Output**: The script will then print the final count in the format requested by the user, showing the full equation.\n\nThis computational approach is robust and directly answers the question by finding the number.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_inversions(perm):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of inversions in a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inversions = 0\n    n = len(perm)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if perm[i] > perm[j]:\n                inversions += 1\n    return inversions\n\ndef has_1324_pattern(perm):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a permutation contains the 1324 pattern.\"\"\"\n    n = len(perm)\n    if n < 4:\n        return False\n    # Use four nested loops to check all combinations of four elements\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                for l in range(k + 1, n):\n                    # Check for the 1324 pattern relationship\n                    # p[i] < p[k] < p[j] < p[l]\n                    if perm[i] < perm[k] < perm[j] < perm[l]:\n                        return True\n    return False\n\ndef solve_av_nk_pi(n_compute, k_target, pattern_checker):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of permutations of length n with k inversions\n    avoiding a given pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    # Generate all permutations of {1, 2, ..., n_compute}\n    # Using range(n_compute) is equivalent to {0,1,...,n-1} which is fine\n    # as the pattern is about relative order.\n    perms = itertools.permutations(range(n_compute))\n    \n    for p in perms:\n        # Check if the number of inversions is the target k\n        if count_inversions(p) == k_target:\n            # Check if the permutation avoids the pattern\n            if not pattern_checker(p):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem and print the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of permutations av_n^k(pi) is stable for n >= 2k.\n    # For k=3, we can use any n >= 6.
