    # (a) Is V(p) simple for all p in Z_>=1?
    # The theory of triplet algebras states that V(p) is simple if and only if p=1.
    # Therefore, it is not simple for all p.
    answer_a = "No"

    # (b) If there exists a non-trivial ideal in V(p), what condition must be met?
    # A non-trivial ideal in a VOA must be generated by a singular vector.
    # Furthermore, since the action of L_k(sl_2) is part of the VOA structure,
    # any ideal must also be an L_k(sl_2)-submodule.
    answer_b = "Both"

    # (c) Does the simplicity of V(p) imply that it is also irreducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module?
    # Simplicity of a VOA does not imply irreducibility as a module over a subalgebra.
    # The case p=1 provides a counterexample: V(1) is a simple VOA, but it is a
    # reducible module for the affine subalgebra L_{-1}(sl_2).
