# The problem asks for the smallest integer t for which the lower ramification filtration G_t is trivial.
# We have deduced the following equation for t based on the discriminant of the field extension
# and the structure of the Galois group D_4.
#
# Let n4 be the number of ramification groups of order 4 for i>=2.
# Let n2 be the number of ramification groups of order 2 for i>=2.
#
# The sum of (|G_i| - 1) for i>=2 must be 16.
# 3 * n4 + 1 * n2 = 16
#
# The smallest t for which G_t = {id} is given by t = 18 - 2 * n4.
# To minimize t, we must maximize n4.
#
# n2 must be non-negative, so 16 - 3 * n4 >= 0, which means 3 * n4 <= 16.
# So, the maximum integer value for n4 is 5.
