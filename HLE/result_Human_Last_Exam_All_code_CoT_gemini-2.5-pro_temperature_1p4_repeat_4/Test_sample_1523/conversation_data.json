    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation of the inner product, followed by a Python script to present the final result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Start with the Euclidean Action:** The starting point is the functional integral representation of the partition function `Z` for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` at a finite temperature `T`. The partition function is `Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S[ϕ])`, where `S[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action.\n2.  **Define the Action:** For a free (non-interacting) neutral scalar field with mass `m`, the Euclidean action `S[ϕ]` is given by:\n    `S[ϕ] = ∫ d⁴x_E [ (1/2)(∂μϕ)² + (1/2)m²ϕ² ]`\n    At finite temperature `T`, the time dimension is compactified into a circle of circumference `β = 1/T`. The integral `∫ d⁴x_E` becomes `∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x`, where `τ` is the imaginary time.\n3.  **Isolate the Operator D:** The quadratic part of the action is often written in the compact form `S[ϕ] = (1/2)(ϕ, Dϕ)`, where `D` is a differential operator and `( , )` denotes an inner product. To find `D`, we can use integration by parts on the kinetic term `(∂μϕ)² = (∂τϕ)² + (∇ϕ)²`. Assuming the fields vanish at spatial infinity and are periodic in `τ` (so boundary terms are zero), we get:\n    `∫ (∂μϕ)(∂μϕ) d⁴x_E = -∫ ϕ(∂μ∂μ)ϕ d⁴x_E = -∫ ϕ(□_E)ϕ d⁴x_E`\n    where `□_E = ∂τ² + ∇²` is the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator.\n    The action becomes:\n    `S[ϕ] = (1/2) ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ -ϕ(□_E)ϕ + m²ϕ² ] = (1/2) ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(x) [-□_E + m²] ϕ(x)`\n    From this, we identify the operator `D` as `D = -□_E + m² = -∂τ² - ∇² + m²`.\n4.  **Define the Inner Product:** The inner product `(f, g)` in this context is defined by the integration over the Euclidean spacetime:\n    `(f, g) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x f(x)g(x)`\n5.  **Construct the Final Expression:** Combining these, the inner product `(ϕ, Dϕ)` is the integral of `ϕ` multiplied by the result of applying the operator `D` to `ϕ`. The following Python code will print this final expression.\n\n```python\ndef print_inner_product_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the mathematical expression for the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ)\n    in finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the components of the expression as strings\n    integral_part = \"∫[0 to β] dτ ∫ d³x\"\n    field_phi = \"ϕ(τ, x)\"\n    operator_D_prefix = \"[\"\n    d2_dtau2_term = \"-∂²/∂τ²\"\n    laplacian_term = \"-∇²\"\n    mass_term = \"m²\"\n    operator_D_suffix = \"]\"\n\n    # The full expression for the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ)\n    # is the integral of ϕ multiplied by D applied to ϕ.\n    print(\"In finite-temperature field theory, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is defined as:\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # We print each part of the equation to be explicit.\n    # Final equation form: Integral * phi * (D_operator) * phi\n    final_equation = (\n        f\"{integral_part} {field_phi} * \"\n        f\"({operator_D_prefix} {d2_dtau2_term} {laplacian_term} + {mass_term} {operator_D_suffix}) \"\n        f\"{field_phi}\"\n    )\n\n    print(final_equation)\n    print(\"\")\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(\"  - τ is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β = 1/T (T is temperature).\")\n    print(\"  - x represents the 3 spatial dimensions.\")\n    print(\"  - ϕ(τ, x) is the neutral scalar field.\")\n    print(\"  - ∂²/∂τ² is the second partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.\")\n    print(\"  - ∇² is the spatial Laplacian operator.\")\n    print(\"  - m is the mass of the scalar field.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_inner_product_expression()\n```\n<<<(`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, x) [-∂τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(τ, x)`)>>>"
