    Calculates the largest value k based on the puzzle's conditions.
    
    The problem asks for the largest number of diamonds, k, such that for any valid arrangement of k diamonds,
    at least one is "movable". This is equivalent to finding k_frozen - 1, where k_frozen is the minimum
    number of diamonds in a "frozen" (no diamonds are movable) arrangement.
    
    A minimal frozen arrangement can be formed by placing diamonds on all cells of the same color on a
    checkerboard-patterned grid. For an N x N grid, this number is (N * N) / 2.
