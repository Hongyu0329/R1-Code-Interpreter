    "Of course. Analyzing the metrical structure of a Latin hexameter line, a process called scansion, involves identifying syllable lengths and patterns. A line of hexameter has six feet. Each foot is either a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short ones) or a spondee (two long syllables).\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to scan the line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago\":\n1.  First, I will identify and apply elisions, where a word ending in a vowel or '-m' is followed by a word starting with a vowel, causing the first sound to be dropped.\n    *   `verum ubi` becomes `ver' ubi`.\n    *   `atque hominis` becomes `atqu' hominis`.\n2.  Next, I will determine the length of each syllable. A syllable is long if its vowel is naturally long, part of a diphthong, or followed by two or more consonants (long \"by position\"). Otherwise, it is short. I will use standard Latin pronunciation rules and knowledge of vowel quantities (e.g., `vērum`, `cāsū`, `imāgō`).\n3.  Finally, I will group the sequence of long (—) and short (U) syllables into the six feet of the hexameter line. Feet 1-4 can be dactyls (D, for — U U) or spondees (S, for — —), foot 5 is nearly always a dactyl, and foot 6 is a spondee.\n\nBased on this analysis, the scansion is determined to be: Dactyl, Spondee, Spondee, Spondee, Dactyl, Spondee.\n\nHere is a Python script to display the result.\n\n```python\n# The line of Latin hexameter is:\n# \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n# The scansion represents each of the six feet as 'D' for a Dactyl or 'S' for a Spondee.\n\n# Define the six feet of the scanned line\nfoot1 = \"D\"\nfoot2 = \"S\"\nfoot3 = \"S\"\nfoot4 = \"S\"\nfoot5 = \"D\"\nfoot6 = \"S\"\n\n# Create a list of the feet\nscansion = [foot1, foot2, foot3, foot4, foot5, foot6]\n\n# Print the final scansion, showing each foot in the sequence\nprint(\"The scansion of the line is:\")\nprint(f\"Foot 1: {scansion[0]}\")\nprint(f\"Foot 2: {scansion[1]}\")\nprint(f\"Foot 3: {scansion[2]}\")\nprint(f\"Foot 4: {scansion[3]}\")\nprint(f\"Foot 5: {scansion[4]}\")\nprint(f\"Foot 6: {scansion[5]}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\n# Use the join function to create the final equation format\nfinal_result = \" + \".join(scansion)\nprint(final_result)\n```\n<<<D + S + S + S + D + S>>>"
