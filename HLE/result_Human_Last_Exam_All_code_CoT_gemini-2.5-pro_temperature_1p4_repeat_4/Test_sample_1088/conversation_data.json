    "Of course, I can help with that. The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set depends on the atom. The notation \"6-311G**\" tells us how to calculate this number for any given atom.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G**):**\n    *   `6-`: Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted function composed of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   `-311`: Each valence atomic orbital is described by three contracted functions. The first is a contraction of 3 primitives, the second is a single primitive, and the third is also a single primitive.\n    *   `**`: These are polarization functions. The first `*` adds a single set of d-type polarization functions to \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. A set of d-functions consists of 6 primitive Gaussians. The second `*` adds a single set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms, which consists of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n\n2.  **Apply this to different atoms:**\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** It has one valence orbital (1s) and no core orbitals. We apply the valence (`-311`) and hydrogen polarization (second `*`) rules.\n    *   **For a 2nd-Period Atom (like Carbon, C):** It has one core orbital (1s) and four valence orbitals (2s, 2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z). We apply the core (`6-`), valence (`-311`), and heavy-atom polarization (first `*`) rules.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the breakdown for each case.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_6_311g_star_star():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set\n    for representative atoms (H and a 2nd-period heavy atom like Carbon).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Calculation for a 6-311G** Basis Set ---\")\n\n    # --- Hydrogen Atom ---\n    # Valence (1s): Split into 3 functions from 3, 1, and 1 primitives.\n    # Polarization: The second '*' adds one set of p-functions (px, py, pz).\n    h_valence_s = 3 + 1 + 1\n    h_polarization_p = 3\n    h_total = h_valence_s + h_polarization_p\n    \n    print(\"\\nFor a Hydrogen atom (H):\")\n    print(\"It has 1 valence orbital (1s) and 0 core orbitals.\")\n    print(f\"Valence primitives (s): {3} + {1} + {1} = {h_valence_s}\")\n    print(f\"Polarization primitives (p): {h_polarization_p}\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: ({3} + {1} + {1}) + {h_polarization_p} = {h_total}\")\n    print(f\"Total primitive Gaussians for H: {h_total}\")\n\n    # --- 2nd-Period Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon) ---\n    # Core (1s): 1 orbital represented by 6 primitives.\n    # Valence (2s, 2p): 4 orbitals, each split into 3 functions from 3, 1, and 1 primitives.\n    # Polarization: The first '*' adds one set of d-functions.
