def solve_integrability_quiz():
    """
    Analyzes a list of function types to determine which are necessarily Lebesgue integrable.

    This function follows a plan:
    1. Define the properties of each function type based on the mathematical definition of
       Lebesgue integrability (must be measurable and integral of absolute value must be finite).
    2. Store these properties, including a textual explanation for each case.
    3. Iterate through and print the analysis for each choice.
    4. Construct and print the final answer string, consisting of the letters of the correct choices in order.
