    "To solve this problem, I will determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with 128 vertices.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** I will first determine the theoretical maximum number of different clique sizes possible in any graph with `n=128` vertices. A clique of size `k` requires `k` vertices, so in a graph with 128 vertices, the largest possible clique size is 128. This means there can be at most 128 different clique sizes (from 1 to 128).\n2.  **Construct a Graph:** I will then construct a specific graph on 128 vertices that aims to achieve this upper bound. The graph I will use is the complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted as `K_128`.\n3.  **Verify the Construction:** I will verify that `K_128` indeed contains induced cliques of all possible sizes from 1 to 128. An induced subgraph on a set of vertices includes all edges from the original graph that connect those vertices. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n4.  **Conclude:** Since the constructed graph achieves the theoretical upper bound, this confirms that the maximum possible number is 128.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this reasoning and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single\n    graph with n = 128 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 128\n\n    print(\"Problem: Find the maximum number of different clique sizes in a graph with n vertices.\")\n    print(f\"For this case, n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the upper bound.\n    print(\"Step 1: Establishing an upper bound.\")\n    print(\"A clique is a subgraph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\")\n    print(\"A clique of size 'k' requires 'k' vertices.\")\n    print(f\"In a graph with n = {n} vertices, the largest possible clique size is {n}.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the number of different possible clique sizes cannot be more than n.\")\n    print(f\"The upper bound for the number of different clique sizes is {n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Construct a graph to meet this bound.\n    print(\"Step 2: Constructing a graph that achieves the upper bound.\")\n    print(\"Consider the complete graph on n vertices, denoted K_n.\")\n    print(f\"In our case, this is the complete graph on {n} vertices, K_{n}.\")\n    print(\"In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Verify the construction.\n    print(\"Step 3: Verifying the construction.\")\n    print(f\"We need to check if K_{n} has induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to {n}.\")\n    print(\"Let's pick an arbitrary size 'k' such that 1 <= k <= n.\")\n    print(\"Now, select any subset of 'k' vertices from K_n.\")\n    print(\"The subgraph induced by this subset of 'k' vertices includes all edges from the original graph that connect these vertices.\")\n    print(\"Since the original graph is a complete graph, every pair of vertices in our subset is connected by an edge.\")\n    print(\"This means the induced subgraph is also a complete graph of size 'k' (a K_k).\")\n    print(f\"This holds true for any 'k' from 1 to {n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Conclusion.\n    print(\"Step 4: Conclusion.\")\n    print(f\"The complete graph K_{n} contains induced cliques of all sizes: 1, 2, 3, ..., {n}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, K_{n} has {n} different clique sizes.\")\n    print(\"Since we found a graph that achieves the upper bound, this is the maximum possible number.\")\n\n    # Final Answer\n    max_clique_sizes = n\n    equation_variable = n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"maximum_number_of_clique_sizes = n\")\n    print(f\"maximum_number_of_clique_sizes = {equation_variable}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_clique_problem()\n```\n<<<128>>>"
