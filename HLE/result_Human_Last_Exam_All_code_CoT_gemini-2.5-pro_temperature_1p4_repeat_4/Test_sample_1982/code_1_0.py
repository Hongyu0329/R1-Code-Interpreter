# Step 1: Define the given constants.
# We are given c1, l1, and alpha1.
# To find u1, we need x11 and c1.
# We assume x11 = l1.
c1 = 10**4
l1 = (1 + 10**5)**5
x11 = l1

# Step 2: Calculate u1 using the derived formula u1 = (x11 - 1) / c1.
# The calculation involves large numbers, which Python handles automatically.
# We use integer division // as the result is expected to be an integer.
u1 = (x11 - 1) // c1

# Step 3: Print the final equation with all the numbers.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# We print the formula for u1 with the calculated values of x11, c1, and the final result for u1.
print(f"The control u1 is derived from the equation: x11 = 1 + c1 * u1")
print(f"Rearranging for u1 gives: u1 = (x11 - 1) / c1")
print(f"Substituting the given values, where x11 = l1 = {x11} and c1 = {c1}:")
print(f"u1 = ({x11} - 1) / {c1}")
print(f"The calculated value is:")
print(f"u1 = {u1}")

# The final answer is the numerical value of u1.
final_answer = u1
