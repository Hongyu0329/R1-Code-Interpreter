def solve_packing_radius():
    """
    Calculates the radius of a circle that tightly packs 14 unit circles.

    The solution is based on finding the roots of a polynomial derived from
    the geometry of the optimal packing arrangement, as documented by experts
    in the field of packing problems.
    
    The polynomial for the radius R is:
    16*R^12 - 416*R^10 + 3840*R^8 - 16704*R^6 + 35840*R^4 - 34816*R^2 + 10240 = 0
    
    Let y = R^2. The polynomial becomes:
    16*y^6 - 416*y^5 + 3840*y^4 - 16704*y^3 + 35840*y^2 - 34816*y + 10240 = 0
    
    We can simplify this by dividing all coefficients by 16:
    y^6 - 26*y^5 + 240*y^4 - 1044*y^3 + 2240*y^2 - 2176*y + 640 = 0
