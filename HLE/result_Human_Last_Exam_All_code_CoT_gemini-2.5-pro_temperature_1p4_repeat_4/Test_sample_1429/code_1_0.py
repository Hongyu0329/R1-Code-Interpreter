    This function provides the answers to the two-part question.

    Part A: Is every boopable function Turing-computable?
    Yes. The "boopable" machine model and a Turing machine are computationally equivalent.
    1. A Turing machine can simulate the boop machine. For any program L, a TM can simulate it on increasingly large (R,A,W) parameters until it finds the N guaranteed by the "boopable" definition, ensuring the simulation terminates if the function is boopable.
    2. The boop machine can simulate a Turing machine. The "for all sufficiently large R,A,W" clause provides unbounded memory analogous to a TM's tape. The instruction set (ADD, NAND, BRANCH) is Turing-complete, allowing the implementation of any TM's transition function.
    Since they can simulate each other, their computational power is the same.

    Part B: Does there exist a program L for f(x)=x with len(L) <= 2^32+50 and steps <= x+50?
    No. The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The time constraint `x+50` is extremely strict. A simple loop takes at least 3 instructions per boop (`BOOP`, `DECREMENT`, `BRANCH`), resulting in a runtime of `~3x`, which is too slow.
    2. The only feasible approach is to have a long chain of `2^32` `BOOP` instructions in the program and jump into it at the correct position to execute exactly `x` boops. This structure has a runtime of `setup_time + x`.
    3. The setup code must halt in `~50` steps or less (from the `x=0` case).
    4. To perform the jump, the program must modify its own code, as there's no indirect jump instruction (`JMP reg`). It must compute the target address `T = K - x` and create a `BRANCH T, zero_reg` instruction.
    5. The instruction encoding requires placing the target address in specific bits of the instruction word, which involves a bit shift: `target_address << 64`.
    6. With only `ADD` and `NAND`, performing a `<< 64` operation requires 64 sequential additions (`y*2`, then `(y*2)*2`, etc.).
    7. This single operation takes 64 steps, which by itself exceeds the ~50-step budget for the setup phase.
    8. Therefore, it is impossible to construct such a program that meets the time constraint.
