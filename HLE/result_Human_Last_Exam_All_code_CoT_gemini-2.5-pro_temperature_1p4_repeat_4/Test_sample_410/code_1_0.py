# Step 1: Determine the coefficients of f(x) = a_coeff * e^(2x) + b_coeff * e^x + c_coeff.
# The problem gives two conditions.
# First condition: lim_{x->-∞} (f(x) + 3) / e^x = 1.
# Let's substitute f(x): lim_{x->-∞} (a_coeff*e^(2x) + b_coeff*e^x + c_coeff + 3) / e^x.
# This can be rewritten as: lim_{x->-∞} (a_coeff*e^x + b_coeff + (c_coeff + 3)/e^x).
# As x -> -∞, e^x -> 0. For the limit to be finite, the term (c_coeff + 3)/e^x must not diverge.
# This implies that the numerator must be zero.
c_coeff = -3
# With c_coeff = -3, the limit becomes lim_{x->-∞} (a_coeff*e^x + b_coeff) = b_coeff.
# We are given that the limit is 1.
b_coeff = 1
# So, the function is f(x) = a_coeff*e^(2x) + e^x - 3.

# Second condition: f(ln 2) = 0.
# a_coeff * e^(2*ln(2)) + e^(ln(2)) - 3 = 0
# e^(2*ln(2)) = e^(ln(2^2)) = 4.
# e^(ln(2)) = 2.
# So, a_coeff * 4 + 2 - 3 = 0, which means 4*a_coeff - 1 = 0.
a_coeff = 1/4

# We have found the function: f(x) = (1/4)e^(2x) + e^x - 3.

# Step 2: Analyze the integral equation to find the new variables 'a' and 'b'.
# The equation is ∫^a_0 g(x)dx + ∫^ln(b)_ln(2) f(x)dx = a*ln(b).
# This matches the general identity for integrals of inverse functions:
# ∫^f(x_2)_f(x_1) g(y)dy + ∫^x_2_x_1 f(x)dx = x_2*f(x_2) - x_1*f(x_1).
#
# Let's align the terms:
# x_1 = ln(2) and x_2 = ln(b).
# This means the integral of g(x) should be from f(ln 2) to f(ln b).
# From the problem's initial conditions, we know f(ln 2) = 0.
# The integral of g(x) is given as ∫^a_0 g(x)dx.
# By comparing the integration limits, we find the condition that must hold: a = f(ln b).
#
# The right side of the identity is x_2*f(x_2) - x_1*f(x_1) = ln(b)*f(ln(b)) - ln(2)*f(ln(2)).
# Substituting a = f(ln b) and f(ln 2) = 0, the RHS becomes ln(b)*a - ln(2)*0 = a*ln(b).
# This perfectly matches the RHS of the given equation.
# So, the entire integral equation is true if and only if a = f(ln b).

# Step 3: Find the unique values for 'a' and 'b'.
# The problem asks for specific values of a and b. We have the relation a = f(ln b).
# We also have the given condition f(ln 2) = 0.
# This gives a specific point on the curve y = f(x), which is (x, y) = (ln 2, 0).
# To find a unique solution, we match the variables in our relation a = f(ln b)
# with the known point's coordinates.
# We set a = 0 and ln(b) = ln(2).
# From ln(b) = ln(2), it follows that b = 2.
a = 0
b = 2

# This pair (a, b) = (0, 2) satisfies the condition a = f(ln b), since f(ln 2) = 0.

# Step 4: Calculate the final requested value, a + b.
final_sum = a + b

print(f"The unique values satisfying the equation are a = {a} and b = {b}.")
print("The final equation is a + b.")
print(f"The result is {a} + {b} = {final_sum}.")
