    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Utilize the K端nneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology:** For two non-amenable groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, there is a K端nneth-type isomorphism for bounded cohomology with real coefficients. Since Thompson's group $T$ is non-amenable, we can apply this theorem to the group $G = T \\times T$. The formula for the dimension in degree $n$ is:\n    $$ \\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) $$\n\n2.  **Determine the Dimensions for Thompson's Group T:** We need the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of $T$ itself, $H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$. Based on established results in the field:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$, as $T$ is an infinite group.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$, which is true for any group.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\infty$ for all $k \\ge 2$. This is a significant result from the work of Nicolas Monod.\n\n3.  **Calculate for Degree 4:** We will apply the formula for $n=4$ and $G_1 = G_2 = T$:\n    $$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R}) $$\n    This involves summing the products of dimensions for the pairs $(p, q)$: (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 0).\n\n4.  **Python Script Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will define a representation for infinity and handle the arithmetic operations ($x \\cdot \\infty = \\infty$ for $x>0$, $0 \\cdot \\infty = 0$, and $x + \\infty = \\infty$). The script will print the full calculation step-by-step as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass Infinity:\n    \"\"\"A simple class to represent infinity for arithmetic operations.\"\"\"\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        return self\n\n    def __radd__(self, other):\n        return self\n\n    def __mul__(self, other):\n        if isinstance(other, (int, float)) and other == 0:\n            return 0\n        return self\n\n    def __rmul__(self, other):\n        if isinstance(other, (int, float)) and other == 0:\n            return 0\n        return self\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return \"inf\"\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return \"inf\"\n\ninf = Infinity()\n\ndef get_dim_Hb_T(k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the dimension of the k-th bounded cohomology group H_b^k(T; R)\n    of Thompson's group T with trivial real coefficients.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(k, int) or k < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Degree k must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    if k == 0:\n        return 1\n    if k == 1:\n        return 0\n    # For k >= 2, the dimension is infinite.\n    return inf\n\ndef compute_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimension of H_b^4(T x T; R) using the K端nneth formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 4\n    \n    print(\"To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T,\")\n    print(\"we use the K端nneth formula for bounded cohomology.\")\n    print(\"T is a non-amenable group, so the formula applies.\")\n    print()\n    print(f\"dim H_b^{n}(T x T) = sum over p+q={n} of [ dim(H_b^p(T)) * dim(H_b^q(T)) ]\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    total_dim = 0\n    \n    # Store components for printing the final equations\n    symbolic_terms = []\n    numeric_terms = []\n    evaluated_terms = []\n\n    for p in range(n + 1):\n        q = n - p\n        dim_p = get_dim_Hb_T(p)\n        dim_q = get_dim_Hb_T(q)\n        \n        term_dim = dim_p * dim_q\n        \n        symbolic_terms.append(f\"dim(H_b^{p}(T))*dim(H_b^{q}(T))\")\n        numeric_terms.append(f\"{dim_p}*{dim_q}\")\n        evaluated_terms.append(f\"{term_dim}\")\n        \n        total_dim += term_dim\n        \n    print(\"The sum expands to:\")\n    print(\" + \".join(symbolic_terms))\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the known dimensions:\")\n    print(\"= \" + \" + \".join(numeric_terms))\n    print(\"\\nEvaluating each term:\")\n    print(\"= \" + \" + \".join(evaluated_terms))\n    print(\"\\nSumming the terms:\")\n    print(f\"= {total_dim}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T is {total_dim}.\")\n\ncompute_dimension()\n```\n<<<inf>>>"
