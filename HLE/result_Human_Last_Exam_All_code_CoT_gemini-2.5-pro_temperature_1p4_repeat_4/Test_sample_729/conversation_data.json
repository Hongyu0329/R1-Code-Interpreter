    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The group in question is the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$. This group is part of a family of groups $Q_{2^n}$, where $2^n$ is the order of the group. For $Q_{128}$, we have $2^n = 128$, which means $n=7$.\n\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it can be expressed as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer exponent $k$. We need to find how many unique subgroups can be formed this way.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of $Q_{128}$:** The group $Q_{128}$ is defined by the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. Its elements are of the form $x^i$ or $x^i y$.\n\n4.  **Calculate $G^k$:** I will analyze the set $G^k$ by considering two cases for the exponent $k$:\n    *   **Case 1: $k$ is odd.** I will show that for any odd $k$, the set $G^k$ is always the entire group $G$ itself. This gives us one power subgroup.\n    *   **Case 2: $k$ is even.** I will show that for any even $k$, the set $G^k$ results in a cyclic subgroup of the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$. Specifically, $G^k = \\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$.\n\n5.  **Count the Subgroups:** By analyzing the possible outcomes for $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ when $k$ is even, I will determine the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed. These are the subgroups $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d$ is an even divisor of 64.\n\n6.  **Sum and Conclude:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from the odd and even cases. I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and present the result clearly, including the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_quaternion_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group Q_128.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 128\n\n    # For a generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n}, the order is 2^n.\n    # We find n such that 2^n = group_order.\n    # n = log2(group_order)\n    if group_order <= 0 or (group_order & (group_order - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: Group order must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n        \n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n\n    # For Q_{2^n} with n >= 3, the power subgroups are determined as follows:\n\n    # Case 1: The exponent k is odd.\n    # For any odd k, the power subgroup G^k is the group G itself.\n    # This contributes 1 unique subgroup to our count.\n    num_from_odd_k = 1\n\n    # Case 2: The exponent k is even.\n    # For any even k, the power subgroup G^k is a cyclic subgroup of <x>,\n    # specifically <x^d> where d = gcd(k, 2^(n-1)).\n    # The order of the cyclic subgroup <x> is 2^(n-1).\n    order_of_x_subgroup = 2**(n-1)\n\n    # Since k is even, d = gcd(k, 2^(n-1)) must also be an even divisor of 2^(n-1)\n    # (as n >= 3, so 2^(n-1) is a multiple of 4).\n    # The number of such subgroups is the number of even divisors of 2^(n-1).\n    # The divisors of 2^(n-1) are 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(n-1).\n    # The even divisors are 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(n-1).\n    # There are (n-1) such even divisors.\n    num_from_even_k = n - 1\n\n    # The total number of power subgroups is the sum from both cases.\n    total_subgroups = num_from_odd_k + num_from_even_k\n    \n    print(f\"For the generalized quaternion group Q_{group_order}, we have n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The power subgroups are found by analyzing the exponent k:\")\n    print(\"1.
