    "When faced with a decision to go all-in (jam) near the money bubble, your primary goal is to balance the risk of elimination against the potential chip gain. This situation calls for a tighter-than-usual range, especially from an early position like UTG+1, because survival has increased monetary value (a concept known as ICM pressure). We should prioritize hands that have very good equity when called and can dominate our opponents' calling ranges.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the specific poker scenario: 16 big blinds, UTG+1 position, on the money bubble.\n2.  Establish a conservative, bubble-adjusted shoving range suitable for this scenario. A very solid and safe range here is `TT+` (pocket tens or better), `AQs+` (Ace-Queen suited or better), and `AKo` (Ace-King offsuit). This range minimizes risky coinflips and maximizes our equity when we get action.\n3.  Evaluate each of the provided hand options (`QJs`, `99`, `AJo`, `AKo`) against this established range.\n4.  The Python code below will perform this check for each hand and print the analysis, concluding which hand is the correct one to jam.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef analyze_shove_decision():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the correct hand to shove UTG+1 with 16bb on the bubble.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define the Scenario & Shoving Range ---\n    position = \"UTG+1\"\n    stack_bb = 16\n    situation = \"Near the money bubble\"\n\n    # On the bubble from early position, we must tighten our shoving range\n    # compared to a standard push/fold chart.
