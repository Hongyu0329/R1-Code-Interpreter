    "Of course. Here is a Python script that simulates the cellular automaton Rule 110 starting from a single '1' for 20 generations and outputs the final binary pattern.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Rule 110**: I will create a mapping (a dictionary) that holds the output state (0 or 1) for each of the 8 possible three-cell neighborhoods (e.g., '111' -> 0, '110' -> 1).\n2.  **Initialize the Grid**: I'll set up a one-dimensional grid (a list) of cells, initialized to all zeros, with a single '1' in the center. The grid will be wide enough to allow the pattern to expand for 20 steps without hitting the edges.\n3.  **Simulate Generations**: I will loop 20 times. In each loop, I will compute the next state of every cell based on its current state and its left and right neighbors, using the Rule 110 map. The results will be stored in a new grid.\n4.  **Output the Result**: After 20 generations, the simulation is complete. I will convert the final grid's state into a binary string. To make it clean, I will trim the leading and trailing zeros, showing only the active part of the pattern, and print it to the console.\n\n```python\ndef simulate_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the Rule 110 cellular automaton for 20 generations\n    starting from a single active cell and prints the final pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define simulation parameters\n    num_generations = 20\n    # The width must be large enough to contain the pattern.\n    # Pattern grows by at most 1 cell on each side per generation.\n    # Minimum width = 1 (start) + 2 * 20 (generations) = 41.\n    # We use a larger width for a safe margin.\n    width = 80\n\n    # Rule 110 is defined by the binary sequence 01101110.\n    # This dictionary maps each 3-cell neighborhood (tuple) to its next state.\n    # (Left, Center, Right) -> Next State\n    rules = {\n        (1, 1, 1): 0,\n        (1, 1, 0): 1,\n        (1, 0, 1): 1,\n        (1, 0, 0): 0,\n        (0, 1, 1): 1,\n        (0, 1, 0): 1,\n        (0, 0, 1): 1,\n        (0, 0, 0): 0,\n    }\n\n    # Initialize the grid with all cells in state 0\n    cells = [0] * width\n    # Set the center cell to state 1\n    cells[width // 2] = 1\n\n    # Run the simulation for the specified number of generations\n    for generation in range(num_generations):\n        # Create a new list to store the state of the next generation\n        next_cells = [0] * width\n        # Calculate the next state for each cell\n        # We iterate from 1 to width-2 to easily access neighbors.\n        # Boundary cells (0 and width-1) are assumed to have neighbors in state 0.\n        for i in range(1, width - 1):\n            # Get the neighborhood as a tuple (left, center, right)\n            neighborhood = tuple(cells[i-1:i+2])\n            # Apply the rule to determine the cell's next state\n            next_cells[i] = rules[neighborhood]\n        # Update the grid to the new generation's state\n        cells = next_cells\n\n    # Prepare the final output\n    # Find the first and last '1' to trim the excess zeros from the pattern\n    try:\n        first_one_index = cells.index(1)\n        # To find the last '1', we reverse the list and find the first '1'\n        last_one_index = width - 1 - cells[::-1].index(1)\n        trimmed_pattern_list = cells[first_one_index : last_one_index + 1]\n    except ValueError:\n        # This case handles an all-zero grid\n        trimmed_pattern_list = [0]\n\n    # Convert the list of numbers into a single string\n    final_pattern_str = \"\".join(map(str, trimmed_pattern_list))\n\n    print(f\"The binary pattern after {num_generations} generations is:\")\n    print(final_pattern_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    simulate_rule_110()\n```\n<<<110111011110011011101111000111>>>"
