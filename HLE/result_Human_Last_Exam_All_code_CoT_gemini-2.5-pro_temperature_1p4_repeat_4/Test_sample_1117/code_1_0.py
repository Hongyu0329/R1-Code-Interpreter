    # Define the chemical species involved

    reagent = "1,1,2,2-tetrakis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-1,2-disilirane"

    print("Step 1: The Reaction")
    print(f"The reaction is an exohedral addition. The {reagent} adds to the outer surface of the {fullerene} cage.")
    print("The cerium (Ce) atoms remain inside the C80 cage.\n")

    print("Step 2: Initial State of Cerium Atoms")
    print(f"In pristine {fullerene}, the two Ce atoms are encapsulated and have a degree of mobility.")
    print("They exist as positive ions within the negatively charged cage.\n")

    print("Step 3: Effect of the External Addition")
    print("The addition of the bulky disilirane group to the cage exterior breaks the cage's high symmetry.")
    print("This creates a non-uniform electrostatic potential on the interior surface of the cage.\n")

    print("Step 4: Final Position of Cerium Atoms")
    print("The new, asymmetric internal potential 'locks' the two Ce ions into fixed positions to minimize energy.")
    print("Experimental evidence shows these positions are along the principal axis at opposite ends of the cage.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The cerium atoms are now positioned at the poles of the fullerene.")
