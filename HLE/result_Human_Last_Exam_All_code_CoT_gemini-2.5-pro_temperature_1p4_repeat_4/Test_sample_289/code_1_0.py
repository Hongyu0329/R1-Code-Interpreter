# Let lambda be an eigenvalue of a matrix A where A^3 = A*.
# As derived in the explanation, lambda must satisfy the equation:
# lambda^3 = conjugate(lambda)

# We use Python's symbolic math library `sympy` to solve this equation.
# We represent the complex eigenvalue lambda as x + i*y, where x and y are real.
x, y = sympy.symbols('x y', real=True)
lambda_expr = x + sympy.I * y

# The equation lambda^3 = conjugate(lambda) is split into real and imaginary parts.
# (x + i*y)^3 = (x^3 - 3*x*y^2) + i*(3*x^2*y - y^3)
# conjugate(x + i*y) = x - i*y
# Equating the real parts:
eq_real = sympy.Eq(x**3 - 3*x*y**2, x)
# Equating the imaginary parts:
eq_imag = sympy.Eq(3*x**2*y - y**3, -y)

# We solve this system of equations for (x, y).
solutions = sympy.solve([eq_real, eq_imag], (x, y))

# The solutions are pairs (x, y) representing the real and imaginary parts
# of the possible eigenvalues. We convert them to complex numbers.
eigenvalue_solutions = [sol[0] + sympy.I * sol[1] for sol in solutions]

# The question asks for the largest size of a set S of NON-REAL eigenvalues.
# We filter our solution set to find those that are not real (i.e., imaginary part is not zero).
non_real_eigenvalues = [val for val in eigenvalue_solutions if sympy.im(val) != 0]

# The maximum size of S is the number of distinct non-real eigenvalues we found.
# To confirm this is achievable, one can construct a matrix A with these eigenvalues
# which satisfies A^3=A*. For example, a diagonal matrix A with the non-real
# eigenvalues on its diagonal, e.g., A = diag(i, -i). This matrix satisfies the
# condition since (i)^3 = -i = conjugate(i) and (-i)^3 = i = conjugate(-i).
