    "I will identify the novel and author based on the specific quotes and descriptions provided. My plan is to:\n1.  Search for the quote \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" in relation to Jorge Luis Borges.\n2.  Search for authors described by Borges as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n3.  Combine the findings to identify the specific novel and author.\n4.
