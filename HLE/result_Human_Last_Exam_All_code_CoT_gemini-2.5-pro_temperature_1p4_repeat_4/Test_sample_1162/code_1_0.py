# The clinical presentation strongly suggests WAGR syndrome,
# which is characterized by:
# W - Wilms tumor (Nephroblastoma)
# A - Aniridia
# G - Genitourinary abnormalities
# R - Retardation (mental/developmental)

# Let's check the patient's symptoms against WAGR syndrome and the answer choices.

patient_findings = {
    "age": "2-year-old",
    "mass_location": "pelvic",
    "hypertension": True,
    "aniridia": True,
    "developmental_delay": True, # Evidenced by delayed speech
    "growth_retardation": True # Evidenced by 10th percentile weight/height
}

# The pelvic mass in this context is highly likely to be a Wilms tumor (Nephroblastoma).
# The patient exhibits Aniridia, Developmental/Growth Retardation, and a mass indicative of Wilms tumor.
# This is a classic presentation for WAGR syndrome.

# The diagnosis asked for is the tumor itself.
diagnosis = "Nephroblastoma"
