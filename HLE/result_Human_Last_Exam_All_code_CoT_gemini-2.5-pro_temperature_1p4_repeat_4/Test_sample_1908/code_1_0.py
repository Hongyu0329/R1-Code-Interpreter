def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function determines the smallest possible number of complements for a given topology.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a non-trivial, non-discrete
    topology T on a set X of cardinality c can have.

    1. A theorem by S. Watson states that the number of complements for a topology on an infinite
       set X is either 0 or at least 2^|X|.
    2. Since |X| = c, the number of complements is either 0 or >= 2^c.
    3. The question asks for the "smallest possible number", implying we should consider topologies
       that are complemented (i.e., have a non-zero number of complements).
    4. Thus, the minimum number of complements is at least 2^c.
    5. It is also a known result that topologies exist which have exactly 2^c complements.
    6. Therefore, the minimum possible number of complements is 2^c.
