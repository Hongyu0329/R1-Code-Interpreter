    "In Terraria's Expert Mode, a boss's health increases with each additional player in the world. However, this scaling is not infinite. According to the game's mechanics, there is a hard cap on the health multiplier. I will write a Python script to calculate this theoretical maximum health.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Identify the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in single-player Expert Mode.\n2.  Identify the maximum health multiplier cap from the game's source code rules. This cap is reached with a large number of players, making it the effective value for an \"infinite\" number of players.\n3.  Multiply the base health by the maximum multiplier to find the theoretical maximum health.\n4.  Print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# In Terraria, boss health scales with the number of players in Expert Mode.\n# However, this scaling is not infinite and has a maximum cap.\n\n# Step 1: Define the base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in single-player Expert Mode.\n# This value is 3640 HP.\nbase_expert_health = 3640\n\n# Step 2: Define the maximum health multiplier.\n# The health scaling is capped at a 1000% increase, which means the final health\n# cannot exceed 11 times the base single-player Expert Mode health.\n# This cap is reached at 256 players, so for any number of players at or above 256\n# (including a theoretical infinite number), this multiplier is used.\nmax_health_multiplier = 11\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the theoretical maximum health.\nmax_theoretical_health = base_expert_health * max_health_multiplier\n\n# Step 4: Print the explanation and the final equation.\nprint(\"The base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is 3640.\")\nprint(\"The health multiplier for players is capped at a maximum of 11x.\")\nprint(\"The calculation for the theoretical maximum health is:\")\nprint(f\"{base_expert_health} * {max_health_multiplier} = {max_theoretical_health}\")\n\n```\n<<<40040>>>"
