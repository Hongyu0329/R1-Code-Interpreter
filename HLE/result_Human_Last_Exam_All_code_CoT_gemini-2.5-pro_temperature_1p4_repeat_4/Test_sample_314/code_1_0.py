    Analyzes the model M = (R, <, V) where V is the Vitali relation.

    (a) What are the O-definable subsets?
    A subset is O-definable if it's defined by a formula without parameters.
    The structure has automorphisms f(x) = x + c for any c in R.
    Let S be a non-empty O-definable set, and s_0 in S.
    Then for any c in R, f_c(s_0) = s_0 + c must be in S.
    This implies S contains all real numbers, so S = R.
    The only O-definable subsets are the empty set and R itself.

    (b) Is this o-minimal?
    A structure is o-minimal if every definable subset of R is a finite union of
    points and open intervals.
    Consider the set defined by the formula V(x, 0), where 0 is a parameter.
    This is the set {x in R | x - 0 in Q}, which is the set of rational numbers Q.
    Q is not a finite union of points and intervals.
    Therefore, the structure is not o-minimal.

    (c) Does it admit quantifier elimination?
    A structure admits quantifier elimination (QE) if every formula is equivalent
    to a quantifier-free one.
    It is a known result in model theory that this structure does not admit QE.
    The interaction between the dense equivalence relation V and the order < allows
    for the definition of sets that cannot be described by quantifier-free
    formulas (which are essentially boolean combinations of intervals and Q-cosets).
    For example, one can define relations on the quotient set R/Q that are not
    trivial, but which cannot be captured by the quantifier-free language.
    A common strategy to prove this would be to find a formula with quantifiers
    that defines a set known not to be quantifier-free definable. While constructing
    such a formula is technical, the result is established.
