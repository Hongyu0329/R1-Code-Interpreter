# This script models the initial and final states of the gas in the
# Maxwell's demon experiment, highlighting the role of temperature.

# Plan:
# 1. Define the initial conditions: two equal compartments with equal amounts of gas.
# 2. Set a non-zero temperature, which is the required parameter for molecular motion.
# 3. Use the Ideal Gas Law (PV = nRT) to calculate the initial pressure in both compartments.
# 4. Define the final condition: all gas has been trapped in one compartment.
# 5. Calculate the final pressure in the full compartment, assuming temperature remains constant.
# 6. Print the results, including the final pressure calculation step-by-step.

# --- Parameters and Constants ---
# Experimental parameters
n_initial_moles = 1.0 # Initial moles of gas in each compartment
volume_m3 = 1.0       # Volume of each compartment in cubic meters
temperature_K = 300   # Temperature in Kelvin. THIS IS THE REQUIRED PARAMETER.

# Physical constant
R_gas_constant = 8.314 # Ideal gas constant in J/(molÂ·K)
