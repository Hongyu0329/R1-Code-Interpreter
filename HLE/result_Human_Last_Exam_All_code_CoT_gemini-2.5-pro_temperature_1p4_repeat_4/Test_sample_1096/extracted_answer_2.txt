The pair of optimal learning rates $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ is given by the formulas: 
$$ \gamma_1 = \frac{4(\kappa+1) - 2\sqrt{2}(\kappa-1)}{\kappa^2+6\kappa+1} $$
$$ \gamma_2 = \frac{4(\kappa+1) + 2\sqrt{2}(\kappa-1)}{\kappa^2+6\kappa+1} $$
where $\kappa=M/m$ is the condition number of the function. The order of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ is interchangeable.
