    "This is a knowledge-based question related to pharmaceutical sterile compounding guidelines, specifically from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797>. I will provide a Python script that explains the reasoning and gives the correct answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Key Terms:** The user is asking for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of a \"single dose container ampule\" after it has been opened in a \"sterile environment\".\n2.  **Differentiate Container Types:** It is critical to distinguish between an **ampule** and a **vial**.\n    *   An **ampule** is a sealed glass container that is broken open. It cannot be resealed, making it an open system.\n    *   A **vial** has a rubber stopper that can be punctured multiple times while maintaining a closed system.\n3.  **Consult Guidelines (USP <797>):** According to USP <797>, once an ampule is opened, its contents are exposed to the environment. Because it cannot be resealed, it cannot be stored.\n4.  **Formulate the Answer:** The contents of an opened ampule must be used immediately. Any unused portion must be discarded and not stored for later use. The 12-hour rule that some may be familiar with applies to single-dose *vials* punctured in an ISO 5 environment, not ampules.\n5.  **Create Python Script:** The script will define the variables from the query and print a clear, explanatory statement that provides the correct BUD and the reason for it.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef get_ampule_bud():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule according to sterile compounding standards.\n    \"\"\"\n    container_type = \"single-dose ampule\"\n    environment = \"sterile environment (e.g., ISO Class 5)\"\n    \n    # According to USP <797>, an ampule is a critical distinction.\n    # Once an ampule is broken open, it cannot be resealed. It becomes an open system.\n    # Therefore, it cannot be stored.\n    \n    bud_explanation = f\"\"\"\n    Container Type: {container_type}\n    Opened In: {environment}\n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Rule: According to USP <797> guidelines for sterile compounding, once a {container_type} is opened, it cannot be resealed. It is considered an open system, and its contents are exposed to the surrounding air.\n\n    Conclusion: The contents must be used immediately. There is no storage time for an opened ampule. Any unused portion must be discarded immediately after the initial use.\n\n    Final Answer: The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is for IMMEDIATE USE ONLY.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The rule for single-dose VIALS is different (up to 12 hours in an ISO 5 environment),\n    # but that does not apply here. There is no equation or number for the ampule's BUD, \n    # as it should not be stored at all.\n\n    print(textwrap.dedent(bud_explanation).strip())\n\nget_ampule_bud()\n```\n<<<Immediate use only>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
