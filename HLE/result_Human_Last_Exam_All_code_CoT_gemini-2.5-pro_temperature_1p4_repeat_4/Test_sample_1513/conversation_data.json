    "My plan is to solve this geographical riddle by systematically breaking down the clues provided.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Isolation Clue**: The phrase \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\" points to one of the most remote inhabited places on Earth. This significantly narrows down the possibilities. My primary candidates would be places like Easter Island (Rapa Nui) or Tristan da Cunha.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Geographical Clue**: The location \"sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera\". This confirms the island must be of volcanic origin and have this specific topographical feature.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Naming Clue**: The fact that the bay \"shares the town's name\" is a very specific detail that can be used to confirm the correct location.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Solve**: I will evaluate the candidates against all three clues.\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha**: It is extremely remote, but its main settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, does not share its name with a bay and isn't situated in a caldera bay.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui)**: It is also extremely remote (over 2,000 km from the nearest inhabited land, Pitcairn Island). It is a volcanic island. Its main and only town is **Hanga Roa**, which is situated on **Hanga Roa Bay**. This matches all the clues perfectly.\n\nBased on this logic, the answer is Hanga Roa. I will now create a Python script to present this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the geographical riddle by analyzing the given clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clue 1: The minimum distance from another inhabited island in kilometers.\n    distance_clue = 500\n\n    # Clue 2: The town is on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    # Clue 3: The town and the bay have the same name.\n\n    # Deduction based on the clues:\n    # The combination of extreme isolation (far more than 500 km), a volcanic origin,\n    # and a shared name for the town and its bay points directly to one location on Earth.\n    # The island is Easter Island (Rapa Nui), and its main town is Hanga Roa,\n    # which is situated on Hanga Roa Bay.\n\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    island_name = \"Easter Island (Rapa Nui)\"\n\n    # The final equation of the riddle is the combination of clues leading to the answer.\n    # Here, we output the number from the riddle and the final answer.\n    print(f\"The clue specified a distance greater than {distance_clue} kilometers.\")\n    print(f\"The island town that matches all the criteria is: {town_name}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
