    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of `tan(10^100)`, we need to perform calculations with very high precision, as standard computer floating-point numbers are not sufficient.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The `tan(x)` function is periodic with a period of `π`. This means that `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`.\n2.  Our task is to calculate `tan(10^100)`. We can simplify this by first calculating the remainder of `10^100` when divided by `π`. Let's call this remainder `r`.\n3.  The problem then becomes calculating `tan(r)`.\n4.  Since `10^100` (a googol) is an extremely large number, we need a special library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Python's `mpmath` library is perfectly suited for this task.\n5.  We will use `mpmath` to set a high decimal precision, calculate `r = 10^100 mod π`, compute `tan(r)`, and then extract the first three digits after the decimal point from the result.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# To perform this calculation, we need high precision arithmetic.\n# The mpmath library is used for this. We set the number of decimal\n# places (dps) for the precision of our calculation.\n# The input 10^100 has 101 digits, so we need a precision\n# higher than that. 110 is a safe choice.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n# Define the large number x\nx = mpmath.power(10, 100)\n\n# The tangent function has a period of pi. So, tan(x) = tan(x mod pi).\n# We can find the argument of the tan function by finding the remainder\n# of 10^100 divided by pi.\npi = mpmath.pi\neffective_angle = mpmath.fmod(x, pi)\n\n# Now, we calculate the tangent of this effective angle.\n# The result will be the same as tan(10^100).\nresult = mpmath.tan(effective_angle)\n\n# Format the result to a string to easily extract the digits.\nresult_str = str(result)\n\n# Find the location of the decimal point.\ndecimal_point_index = result_str.find('.')\n\n# Extract the 3 digits immediately following the decimal point.\nfirst_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n\n# Print out the steps and the final answer as an equation.\nprint(f\"The calculation is for tan(10^100).\")\nprint(f\"The period of tan(x) is pi ≈ {mpmath.nstr(pi, 5)}\")\nprint(f\"We first compute the effective angle: 10^100 mod pi = {effective_angle}\")\nprint(f\"So, tan(10^100) = tan({effective_angle})\")\nprint(f\"The value is: {result_str}\")\nprint(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma are: {first_three_digits}\")\n\n```\n<<<430>>>"
