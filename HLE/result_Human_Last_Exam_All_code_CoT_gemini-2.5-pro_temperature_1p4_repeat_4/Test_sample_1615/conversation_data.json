    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** The goal is to find the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n2.  **Recall Key Concepts from Graph Theory:**\n    *   A proper vertex coloring assigns colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n    *   The chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper coloring.\n    *   For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is always less than or equal to $n$.\n    *   The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph is a complete graph, $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n3.  **Apply Concepts to the Given Graph:**\n    *   The graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   Based on the general theorem, $\\chi(G) \\le 12345$.\n    *   Crucially, the problem states that $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This means $\\chi(G)$ cannot be equal to $n$.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatic number must be strictly less than 12345, which implies $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n4.  **Verify the Maximum Value:** To confirm that 12344 is the maximum possible chromatic number, we need to show that there exists at least one graph $G'$ that satisfies the conditions and has $\\chi(G') = 12344$.\n    *   Consider a graph $G'$ constructed by taking a complete graph on 12344 vertices, $K_{12344}$, and adding one single, isolated vertex.\n    *   This graph $G'$ has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other vertices.\n    *   To color $G'$, we need 12344 distinct colors for the $K_{12344}$ component, and the isolated vertex can be colored with any of those colors. Thus, the minimum number of colors needed for $G'$ is $\\chi(G') = 12344$.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the chromatic number cannot exceed 12344, and we have found a graph that achieves this value, the maximum number of colors required is 12344. The Python code below will formalize this reasoning and calculate the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_graph_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring\n    of a graph with n vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph G.\n    n = 12345\n\n    # Step 1: State the general upper bound for the chromatic number.\n    print(f\"Let n = {n} be the number of vertices in the graph G.\")\n    print(\"A fundamental theorem in graph theory states that for any graph G with n vertices, the chromatic number chi(G) is at most n.\")\n    print(\"chi(G) <= n\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Use the condition that the graph is not complete.\n    print(\"The theorem also states that chi(G) = n if and only if G is the complete graph K_n.\")\n    print(f\"The problem specifies that G is NOT the complete graph K_{n}.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the chromatic number of G must be strictly less than n.\")\n    print(f\"chi(G) < {n}\")\n    print(f\"This implies that the maximum possible chromatic number is at most {n} - 1.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Show that this maximum is achievable.\n    print(f\"To confirm that {n-1} is the maximum, we must show that a graph with this chromatic number exists.\")\n    print(f\"Consider a graph G' consisting of two disjoint components:\")\n    print(f\"1.
