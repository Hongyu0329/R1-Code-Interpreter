# Step 1: Define constants and the core logic.
# The problem constraints on distances imply a graph structure that can be optimally
# realized by a regular pentagon. There are two unique distances: the side length 's'
# and the diagonal length 'd'.

# The condition is that 's' must be less than r, and 'd' must be greater than or
# equal to r. This gives the inequality: s < r <= d.

# To find the largest possible r, we need to maximize d. This is equivalent to finding
# the largest regular pentagon that can fit inside a unit square.

# Step 2: Solve the geometric packing problem.
# The largest regular pentagon in a unit square has a width equal to 1. The width of
# a regular pentagon is identical to its diagonal length.
diagonal_length_d = 1.0

# The side length 's' is related to the diagonal length 'd' by the golden ratio, phi.
# d = s * phi, which means s = d / phi.
phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2
side_length_s = diagonal_length_d / phi

# Step 3: Determine the largest value of r.
# From the inequality s < r <= d, the largest possible value for r is d.
r_max = diagonal_length_d

# Step 4: Output the reasoning and the result.
print("The problem requires finding the largest value for 'r'.")
print("This value is constrained by the distances between the 5 points.")
print("The optimal arrangement for the points is as the vertices of a regular pentagon.")
print("This creates two sets of distances: the side length 's' and the diagonal length 'd'.")
print("\nThe condition on 'r' is that all side lengths must be < r and all diagonal lengths must be >= r.")
print("This gives the inequality: s < r <= d")

print("\nFor the largest such pentagon that fits in a 1x1 square:")
# The request is to output each number in the final equation.
# Here, we print the values of s and d for the inequality.
print(f"The diagonal length d = {diagonal_length_d}")
print(f"The side length s = {side_length_s}")

print(f"\nThus, the inequality is: {side_length_s} < r <= {diagonal_length_d}")
print(f"\nThe largest real number r that satisfies this inequality is {r_max}.")
