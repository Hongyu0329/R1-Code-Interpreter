    # Analysis of each property for the AFM insulator state:
    # 1. Correct. As a Mott insulator, particles are localized, and tunneling is suppressed.
    # 2. Incorrect. The state exists at half-filling, so it is a many-body state, not a vacuum.
    # 3. Correct. The state has zero double occupancy by construction, so there are no losses.
    # 4. Correct. The ground state of a 1D quantum antiferromagnet is highly entangled.
    # 5. Correct. The state is an antiferromagnet, so it has AFM spin correlations by definition.
    # 6. Incorrect. The correlations are antiferromagnetic.
