    # The problem asks to identify which types of points from the Berkovich projective line
    # are included in a subset defined by an equivalence relation on C_p* x C_p.

    # Points in the Berkovich line correspond to disks D(a, r) and are classified by their radius r.
    # Type 1: r = 0
    # Type 2: r is a positive rational power of p (i.e., r is in the value group |C_p*|)
    # Type 3: r > 0 but is not a rational power of p.
    # Type 4: Points corresponding to nested disks with an empty intersection.

    # A point (z0, z) in C_p* x C_p can be mapped to a disk D(z, |z0|_p).
    # The center of the disk is z.
    # The radius of the disk is r = |z0|_p.

    # Since z0 is in C_p*, its p-adic norm |z0|_p is a non-zero value in the value group of C_p.
    # This means the radius r is always a positive rational power of p.

    # Based on the classification, disks with such radii are, by definition, Type 2 points.
    # The other types are excluded:
    # - r cannot be 0, so no Type 1 points.
    # - r is always a rational power of p, so no Type 3 points.
    # - The mapping gives a single disk, not a limit of nested disks, so no Type 4 points.
    
    # The equivalence relation given in the problem ensures that the set of equivalence classes
    # is in a one-to-one correspondence with the set of these Type 2 disks.
