    print("Analyzing the statements about Support Vector Machines...\n")

    # Statement A
    print("--- Statement A: Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class. ---")
    print("In the dual formulation of SVM, one of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions is that the sum of the products of Lagrange multipliers (alpha_i) and class labels (y_i) must be zero:")
    print("  sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0")
    print("Support vectors are the points for which alpha_i > 0. If all support vectors belonged to one class (e.g., y_i = +1), the equation would become sum(alpha_i) = 0.")
    print("Since alpha_i must be positive for all support vectors, this sum cannot be zero. Therefore, you must have support vectors from both classes (+1 and -1) for the condition to hold.")
    print("Result: Statement A is TRUE.\n")

    # Statement B
    print("--- Statement B: With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM. ---")
    print("Standard SVM aims for equal margins. However, when dealing with imbalanced data or asymmetric misclassification costs, we can use a weighted soft-margin SVM.")
    print("This involves assigning different penalty parameters (C_positive, C_negative) to each class. For example, by assigning a higher C to the minority class, we penalize misclassifications of that class more heavily.")
    print("This adjustment pushes the decision boundary away from the minority class, resulting in a larger margin for the majority class and a smaller margin for the minority class. The margins become unequal.")
    print("Result: Statement B is TRUE.\n")

    # Statement C
    print("--- Statement C: Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels. ---")
    print("This describes the 'kernel trick'. The SVM algorithm only depends on dot products of feature vectors, not the vectors themselves.")
    print("A kernel function K(x, z) computes the dot product in a higher-dimensional space (phi(x) . phi(z)) without ever explicitly performing the mapping phi.")
    print("A prime example is the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, K(x, z) = exp(-gamma * ||x-z||^2), which corresponds to a mapping into an infinite-dimensional feature space. Calculating the kernel value is simple and efficient.")
    print("Result: Statement C is TRUE.\n")

    # Statement D
    print("--- Statement D: It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points. ---")
    print("The SVM decision boundary is defined *only* by the support vectors (the points on or inside the margin).")
    print("Interior points are those correctly classified points that lie outside the margin gutter (where y_i * (w.x_i + b) > 1).")
    print("These points have a corresponding Lagrange multiplier alpha_i = 0 and do not contribute to the calculation of the weight vector 'w' or bias 'b'.")
    print("Therefore, moving, adding, or removing these points (as long as they don't cross the margin) does not change the support vectors and thus does not affect the decision boundary.")
    print("Result: Statement D is TRUE.\n")

    # Statement E
    print("--- Statement E: Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer. ---")
    print("This is a general mathematical statement. While it is true that if a global minimizer of a strictly convex function EXISTS, it must be unique, its existence is not guaranteed for *any* such function.")
    print("A simple counterexample is the function f(x) = e^x on the domain of all real numbers.")
    print("This function is strictly convex. However, its value approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity, but it never actually reaches 0. It has an infimum of 0, but no minimum value.")
    print("f(x) = e^x has no global minimizer. Therefore, the statement is not universally true.")
    print("Result: Statement E is FALSE.\n")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Statements A, B, C, and D are true properties related to SVMs.")
    print("Statement E is a false mathematical assertion because a strictly convex function is not guaranteed to have a global minimizer without additional conditions (e.g., a compact domain or coercivity).")
