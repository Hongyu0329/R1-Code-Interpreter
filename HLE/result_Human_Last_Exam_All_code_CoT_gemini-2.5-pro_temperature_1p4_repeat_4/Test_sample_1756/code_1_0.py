    # After a thorough step-by-step analysis of each statement, the following
    # have been identified as correct:
    # A) Correct: The effective sampling pool is the intersection of the pools
    #    from both methods, hence determined by the more restrictive one.
    # C) Correct: A temperature > 1 flattens the distribution, requiring more
    #    tokens to sum to the nucleus probability mass p, thus expanding the set.
    # E) Correct: This is the definition of renormalization on a truncated
    #    distribution; relative probabilities are preserved.
    # G) Correct: Filtering is effectively set intersection, which is commutative.
    #    The order of applying top-k and nucleus filters does not change the final set.
    # M) Correct: Determinism is possible ("can be") in MoE models if all underlying
    #    operations and CUDA settings are configured to be deterministic.
    # O) Correct: Different GPU architectures can yield different floating-point
    #    results due to hardware-level differences, leading to different beam search paths.
    # P) Correct: Non-deterministic handling of expert capacity limits (token dropping)
    #    "can" lead to different outputs across runs.
    # Q) Correct: End-to-end determinism requires all components to be deterministic.
    #    If attention patterns can vary, deterministic routing alone is insufficient.
    # R) Correct: Padding affects tensor shapes, which can trigger different,
    #    non-bit-identical compute kernels, causing numerical variations.
    # X) Correct: Non-associativity of floating-point math during parallel
    #    attention score computation is a known source of non-determinism.
    # Y) Correct: Activation checkpointing relies on recomputation, which can
    #    introduce numerical differences from the original pass due to floating-point inaccuracies.
