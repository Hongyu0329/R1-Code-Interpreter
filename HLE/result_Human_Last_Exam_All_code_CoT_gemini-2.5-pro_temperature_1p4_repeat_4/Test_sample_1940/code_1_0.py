    This function solves for the minimal number of CCZ gates to synthesize a CCCZ gate.
    
    The problem is to find the minimal number of controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ) gates
    required to exactly synthesize a controlled-controlled-controlled-Z (CCCZ) gate
    without using any ancilla qubits. The allowed gates are CCZ and arbitrary
    single-qubit rotations.
    
    This problem is equivalent to synthesizing a 3-controlled-NOT (CCCNOT) gate
    from Toffoli (CCNOT) gates. The equivalence comes from the identity Z = H·X·H,
    where H is the Hadamard gate (a single-qubit rotation). This allows for the
    conversion of a circuit for one into a circuit for the other with the same
    number of controlled gates.
    
    The minimal number of Toffoli gates required to synthesize a CCCNOT gate without
    ancilla qubits is a known result in quantum circuit theory.
