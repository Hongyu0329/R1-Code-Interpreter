    "Here is my plan to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Generalized Markov Number:** The generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is not universally defined in all texts, but a common interpretation in the context of Diophantine approximation and continued fractions defines it as the larger root of the quadratic equation:\n    \\( qx^2 - (3q - 2p)x + p = 0 \\)\n    I will use this definition. For the given rational \\( p/q = 4/7 \\), I will substitute these values into the equation.\n\n2.  **Solve the Quadratic Equation:** I will solve the resulting quadratic equation for \\(x\\). The generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the larger of the two roots. This will give a number of the form \\( \\frac{A + \\sqrt{D}}{B} \\), which is a quadratic irrational.\n\n3.  **Compute the Continued Fraction:** I will write a Python script to compute the continued fraction of the number obtained in the previous step. For a quadratic irrational, the continued fraction is always periodic. The script will use an algorithm based on integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point precision errors and to reliably detect the repeating part of the fraction.\n\n    The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n    - Start with \\( x_0 = \\frac{P_0 + \\sqrt{D}}{Q_0} \\).\n    - For each step \\(i\\), calculate the integer part \\( a_i = \\lfloor x_i \\rfloor \\).\n    - The next term in the sequence is \\( x_{i+1} = \\frac{1}{x_i - a_i} \\), which can be expressed as \\( \\frac{P_{i+1} + \\sqrt{D}}{Q_{i+1}} \\) using integer updates for P and Q.\n    - I will keep track of the pairs \\( (P_i, Q_i) \\). When a pair repeats, the period of the continued fraction has been found.\n\n4.  **Format the Output:** The final Python code will print the complete result, showing the expression for \\( m_{4/7} \\) and its computed continued fraction, formatted in a clear and standard way, like `[a₀; a₁, a₂, ..., (b₁, b₂, ...)]`, where the parentheses enclose the repeating part.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number m_{4/7}.\n    \"\"\"\n    p, q = 4, 7\n\n    # 1.
