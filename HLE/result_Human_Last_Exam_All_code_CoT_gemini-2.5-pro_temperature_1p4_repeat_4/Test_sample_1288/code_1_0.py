# Step 1: Define the character from the Moscow chapters.

moscow_character = "Rimsky"

# his tormented thoughts are mirrored by a small bird on his balcony.
jerusalem_bird = "barn swallow"

# Step 3: Define the corresponding character from the Jerusalem chapters.
# The character tormented by the bird, and who parallels the tormented official Rimsky,
# is Pontius Pilate himself.
jerusalem_character = "Pontius Pilate"

# Step 4: Print the final answer in the required format.
print(f"{moscow_character}; {jerusalem_bird}; {jerusalem_character}")
