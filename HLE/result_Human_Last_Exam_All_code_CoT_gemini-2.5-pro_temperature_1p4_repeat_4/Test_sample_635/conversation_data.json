    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the left coprime factorization for the given transfer function.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, for the given transfer function $H(s)$ such that $H(s) = D(s)^{-1} N(s)$ and $D(s), N(s)$ are left coprime.\n2.  **Initial Factorization:** I will first express $H(s)$ as a fraction with a scalar polynomial denominator, $H(s) = \\frac{1}{d(s)} \\tilde{N}(s)$, where $d(s)$ is the least common denominator of all elements in $H(s)$. This gives an initial, but likely not coprime, factorization.\n3.  **Construct Minimal D(s):** To achieve a coprime factorization, I will construct a matrix $D(s)$ with the lowest possible determinant degree that clears the denominators of $H(s)$ when multiplied, i.e., $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ becomes a polynomial matrix. I will do this by considering each row of $H(s)$ and finding the simplest polynomial vector that makes the product polynomial.\n4.  **Derive N(s):** Once $D(s)$ is determined, I will compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$.\n5.  **Verification:** I will verify two conditions:\n    *   The factorization is correct: $D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ equals the original $H(s)$.\n    *   The factors are coprime: The matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$. This is typically checked at the roots of $\\det(D(s))$.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** Finally, I will write a Python script to display the derived matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ and the final factorization equation in a clear, formatted way.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n1.  The given transfer function is:\n    $H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n2.  We need to find $D(s)$ such that $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ is a polynomial matrix. Let $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n3.  **First row:** The product for the first row of $N(s)$ is $[d_{11}(s) \\quad d_{12}(s)] H(s)$. To clear the denominator in $h_{11}(s)$, we can simply choose the first row of $D(s)$ to be $[s+1 \\quad 0]$.\n    *   This gives the first row of $N(s)$ as: $[s+1 \\quad 0] \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = [s-1 \\quad s+1]$. This is a valid polynomial row vector.\n4.  **Second row:** The product for the second row is $[d_{21}(s) \\quad d_{22}(s)] H(s)$. We need $[d_{21} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22} \\frac{2}{s^2-1} \\quad d_{21}]$ to be polynomial. This requires $d_{21}$ to be a polynomial. Let's try the simplest non-trivial choice to ensure $\\det(D(s)) \\neq 0$, such as $d_{21}(s)=1$. Now we need $1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22} \\frac{2}{s^2-1}$ to be polynomial. Let's rewrite this term as $\\frac{(s-1)^2 d_{21} + 2 d_{22}}{s^2-1}$. We need a simple polynomial $d_{22}$ that makes the numerator divisible by $s^2-1$. Setting $d_{21}=1$, we need $(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}$ to have roots at $s=1$ and $s=-1$. A simple choice that works is $d_{22}=s-1$, which yields a numerator of $(s-1)^2+2(s-1)=(s-1)(s-1+2) = (s-1)(s+1)=s^2-1$. The fraction becomes 1.\n    *   So, we choose the second row of $D(s)$ to be $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\n    *   The second row of $N(s)$ is: $[1 \\cdot (\\frac{s-1}{s+1}) + (s-1) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} \\quad 1 \\cdot 1] = [\\frac{(s-1)^2+2(s-1)}{s^2-1} \\quad 1] = [\\frac{s^2-1}{s^2-1} \\quad 1] = [1 \\quad 1]$.\n5.  **Final Matrices and Verification:**\n    *   $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    *   $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    *   $\\det(D(s)) = (s+1)(s-1) = s^2-1$. The roots are $s = \\pm 1$.\n    *   The matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ is full rank at $s=1$ and $s=-1$, confirming coprimeness.\n\nThe following Python code will print the resulting factorization.\n\n```python\ndef solve_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the matrices for a left coprime factorization\n    of the given transfer function H(s).\n    The factorization is in the form H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Display the D(s) matrix\n    print(\"D(s) =\")\n    print(\"[[ s + 1,     0 ]]\")\n    print(\"[[     1, s - 1 ]]\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Display the N(s) matrix\n    print(\"N(s) =\")\n    print(\"[[ s - 1, s + 1 ]]\")\n    print(\"[[     1,     1 ]]\")\n    print(\"\")\n    \n    # Display the final equation using the matrices\n    print(\"Therefore, the final equation is:\")\n    # The string formatting below aligns the matrices for clear visualization.\n    # The numbers in the string represent the characters for each matrix row.\n    print(f\"{'H(s) = [[ s + 1,     0 ]]'} ^-1  *  {'[[ s - 1, s + 1 ]]'}\")\n    print(f\"{'       [[     1, s - 1 ]]'}          {'[[     1,     1 ]]'}\")\n\nsolve_left_coprime_factorization()\n```\n<<<D(s)=[[s+1,0],[1,s-1]],N(s)=[[s-1,s+1],[1,1]]>>>"
