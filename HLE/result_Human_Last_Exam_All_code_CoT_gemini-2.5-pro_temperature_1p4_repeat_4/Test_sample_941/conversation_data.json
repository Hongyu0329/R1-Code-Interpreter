    "My plan is to solve this by encoding the knowledge about each ballet school's training methodology into a Python data structure. I will use a dictionary where each key corresponds to an answer choice (A, B, C, D, E) and the value contains information about the school's approach to pointe work.\n\nThen, the program will iterate through this data to find the school whose methodology is famously characterized by extensive pointe work at the barre. Finally, it will print the reasoning and the correct school's name, demonstrating the logical \"equation\" that leads to the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_school():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the ballet school known for extensive pointe work at the barre\n    by analyzing a knowledge base of training methodologies.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A knowledge base representing the primary training methods of the schools.\n    school_methodologies = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'La Scala',\n            'pointe_style': 'Follows the Cecchetti method, which has a structured approach to pointe, but barre is not primarily done on pointe.'\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'name': 'Vaganova',\n            'pointe_style': 'The Vaganova method builds immense strength in soft shoes before introducing pointe work later in training.
