    Both options A and E describe scenarios that appear compliant. However, the question asks for the best fit among the choices.
    
    The exemption for bank-issued debt (Option A) is broad and allows for distribution to all retail investors without further conditions. The description in Option A fits this exemption perfectly and unambiguously.
    
    The exemption for credit union securities (Option E) requires distribution 'only to its members'. The option's phrasing 'aimed at raising funds from a large number of retail investors' is slightly less precise than the rule itself, although it reflects common practice.
    
    Given the choices, Option A presents the most clear-cut, textbook example of a prospectus-exempt distribution.
