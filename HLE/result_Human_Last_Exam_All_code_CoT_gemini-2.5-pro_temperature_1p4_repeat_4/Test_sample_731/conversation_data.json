    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we first need to understand the group's structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group**: The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. Since the order of a semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ is $2^n$, for a size of 512, we have $512 = 2^9$, so we are dealing with the group $SD_{2^9}$, meaning $n=9$.\n\n2.  **Understand \"Power Subgroup\"**: A \"power subgroup\" of a group G is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element of G. This is the definition of a cyclic subgroup. Therefore, the task is to count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $SD_{512}$.\n\n3.  **Count the Cyclic Subgroups**: The semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ has a well-defined structure for its cyclic subgroups, which can be divided into two categories:\n    *   Cyclic subgroups that are contained within its maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle \\cong C_{2^{n-1}}$. For any cyclic group of order $m$, there is exactly one cyclic subgroup for each divisor of $m$. The number of divisors of $2^{n-1}$ is $\\tau(2^{n-1}) = (n-1)+1=n$.\n    *   Cyclic subgroups generated by elements outside the maximal cyclic subgroup. These elements are of the form $ba^i$, where $b$ is the other generator. In $SD_{2^n}$ (for $n \\ge 4$), these elements generate cyclic subgroups of order 2 or 4.\n        *   There are $2^{n-2}$ elements of order 2, each generating a distinct cyclic subgroup.\n        *   There are $2^{n-2}$ elements of order 4, which pair up to generate $2^{n-2}/2 = 2^{n-3}$ distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Total**: The total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of the counts from these categories. The formula is:\n    Total = (subgroups from $\\langle a \\rangle$) + (subgroups from elements of order 2) + (subgroups from elements of order 4)\n    Total = $n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$\n\n5.  **Calculate for n=9**: Substitute $n=9$ into the formula and compute the result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the \n    semidihedral group of a given size.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # Step 1: Find n for SD_{2^n}\n    # group_size = 2^n  => n = log2(group_size)\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(f\"Error: Group size {group_size} is not a power of 2.\")\n        return\n        \n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    if n < 3:\n        # The formula applies for n>=4. For n=3, SD_8 is isomorphic to Q_8.\n        # For n=2, SD_4 is isomorphic to C_4. For n=1, SD_2 is C_2.\n        # The question specifies 512, so n=9 and this check is for robustness.\n        print(f\"The group SD_{group_size} is not a standard semidihedral group.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_size} is denoted as SD_{{2**n}}, so n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The number of power (cyclic) subgroups in SD_{2^n} is given by the formula: n + 2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate each term in the formula\n    # Term 1: Number of cyclic subgroups in the maximal cyclic subgroup C_{2^(n-1)}\n    # This is equal to the number of divisors of 2^(n-1), which is n.\n    term1 = n\n\n    # Term 2: Number of cyclic subgroups of order 2 generated by elements outside the maximal cyclic subgroup.\n    # This is 2^(n-2).\n    term2 = 2**(n - 2)\n    \n    # Term 3: Number of cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by elements outside the maximal cyclic subgroup.\n    # This is 2^(n-3).\n    term3 = 2**(n - 3)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total sum\n    total_subgroups = term1 + term2 + term3\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final equation as requested\n    print(\"Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Number of subgroups from the maximal cyclic subgroup = {term1}\")\n    print(f\"Number of additional subgroups of order 2 = 2^({n}-2) = {term2}\")\n    print(f\"Number of additional subgroups of order 4 = 2^({n}-3) = {term3}\")\n    print(\"\\nTotal number of power subgroups:\")\n    print(f\"{term1} + {term2} + {term3} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<201>>>"
