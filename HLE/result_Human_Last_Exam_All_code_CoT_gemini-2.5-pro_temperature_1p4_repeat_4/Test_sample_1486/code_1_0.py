# Number of cabrioles devants in the repeating choreographic sequence.
cabrioles_per_sequence = 1

# The number of times Maria Khoreva repeats this sequence in her solo.
repetitions = 4

# Calculate the total number of cabrioles devants.
total_cabrioles = cabrioles_per_sequence * repetitions

# Print the explanation and the final equation.
