    # Step 1: Analyze the patient's condition and treatment.
    # The patient likely has schizophrenia treated with an antipsychotic, which caused high prolactin levels (hyperprolactinemia) as a side effect.
    # She was treated with a dopamine agonist (Drug 2) to lower prolactin.
    # Post-delivery, she developed symptoms of pituitary damage (e.g., Sheehan's syndrome or pituitary apoplexy).
    print("Analyzing the patient's clinical history and symptoms...")

    # Step 2: Identify the key component of the new diet.
    # The description "tastes like bean salad" is a clue pointing towards Fava Beans.
    print("The new diet described as tasting 'like bean salad' strongly suggests it contains Fava Beans.")

    # Step 3: Explain the significance of Fava Beans in this context.
    # Fava beans are a primary natural source of L-DOPA (levodopa).
    print("The importance of this new food is that Fava Beans are a significant natural source of L-DOPA (levodopa).")

    # Step 4: Connect L-DOPA to the patient's underlying condition.
    # L-DOPA is the chemical precursor to dopamine. Dopamine inhibits the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland.
    # The patient's second drug (a dopamine agonist) was withdrawn, so she needs another way to suppress her prolactin.
    print("\nHere is the clinical connection:")
    print("1. L-DOPA is the precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine.")
    print("2. Dopamine naturally inhibits the secretion of the hormone prolactin from the pituitary gland.")
    print("3. The patient was likely suffering from high prolactin levels, which were previously managed by a dopamine-acting drug that has now been withdrawn.")
    print("4. By eating a diet rich in fava beans, the patient is consuming L-DOPA, which her body converts to dopamine. This serves as a natural dietary strategy to suppress her high prolactin levels.")
