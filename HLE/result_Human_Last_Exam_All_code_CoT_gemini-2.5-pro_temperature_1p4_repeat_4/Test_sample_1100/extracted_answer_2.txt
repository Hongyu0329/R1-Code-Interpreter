The new food, likely a fava bean salad, is important because fava beans are a rich natural source of L-DOPA. L-DOPA is the precursor to dopamine. The patient was on a dopamine-acting drug, likely to control high prolactin levels (a common side effect of antipsychotics). By eating fava beans after the drug was stopped, she is using a natural source of L-DOPA to increase her dopamine levels, which in turn helps to suppress and control her high prolactin.
