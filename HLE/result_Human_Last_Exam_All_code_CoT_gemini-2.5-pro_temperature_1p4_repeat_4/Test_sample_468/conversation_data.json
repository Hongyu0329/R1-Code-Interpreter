    "To answer your question, I will first determine the currently accepted common name for bees of the genus *Perdita*. Then, I will research the origin of this common name to find the earliest prominent publication where it was used, which I will consider the year it was effectively \"coined\" for a broader audience.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  Search for common names associated with the bee genus *Perdita*. The most prevalent one is \"Fairy bees,\" given due to their very small size and often iridescent coloration.\n2.  Trace the origin of the term \"Fairy bees\" in relation to *Perdita*. While it may have been used colloquially earlier, a significant point of popularization was in the landmark 1996 book \"The Forgotten Pollinators\" by Stephen L. Buchmann and Gary Paul Nabhan. This book was crucial in raising public awareness of native pollinators.\n3.  The answer will be formatted as the name followed by the year.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print this result.\n\n```python\ndef get_perdita_common_name_info():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the common name for the genus Perdita and the year it was popularized.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The common name for the genus Perdita is \"Fairy bees\".\n  name = \"Fairy bees\"\n  \n  # The term was prominently used and popularized in the 1996 book \"The Forgotten Pollinators\".\n  year = 1996\n  \n  # Print the result in the format \"<name>, <year>\"\n  print(f\"{name}, {year}\")\n\nget_perdita_common_name_info()\n```\n<<<Fairy bees, 1996>>>"
