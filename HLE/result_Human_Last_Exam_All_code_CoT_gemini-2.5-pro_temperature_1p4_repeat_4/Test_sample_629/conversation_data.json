    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, considering rotational and translational symmetries.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand Grid Diagrams and Knot Invariants**:\n    *   A knot on an `n x n` grid can be represented by a pair of permutations, `(sigma, tau)`, of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.\n    *   The minimal grid number `n` for a trefoil knot is 3. So, we'll work with permutations of `{0, 1, 2}`.\n    *   A key property is that the permutation `pi = sigma * tau_inverse` determines the knot type. For a single-component knot, `pi` must be a full-cycle permutation.\n    *   For `n=3`, the two possible 3-cycles are `(1, 2, 0)` and `(2, 0, 1)`. By convention, these correspond to the right-hand and left-hand trefoil knots, respectively. We are interested in the left-hand trefoil, so we will use `pi = (2, 0, 1)`.\n\n2.  **Generate All Left-Hand Trefoil Diagrams**:\n    *   We need to find all pairs `(sigma, tau)` such that `sigma * tau_inverse = (2, 0, 1)`.\n    *   For each of the `3! = 6` possible permutations for `tau`, the permutation `sigma` is uniquely determined by `sigma = (2, 0, 1) * tau`.\n    *   This gives us a total of 6 distinct `(sigma, tau)` pairs that represent the left-hand trefoil on a 3x3 grid.\n\n3.  **Account for Symmetries (Equivalence Classes)**:\n    *   The problem states we should count diagrams \"up to translation and rotation\". This means we need to find how many of these 6 diagrams are actually the same under these transformations.\n    *   We can model these geometric transformations as operations on the `(sigma, tau)` pairs.\n    *   **Translation**: Shifting the grid horizontally or vertically corresponds to composing `sigma` and `tau` with a cyclic permutation.\n    *   **Rotation**: Rotating the grid by 90, 180, or 270 degrees corresponds to more complex operations involving permutation inverses and the reversal permutation `w = (2, 1, 0)`.\n    *   The problem then becomes counting the number of equivalence classes (or orbits) of the set of 6 diagrams under this group of transformations.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**:\n    *   We will write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n    *   The script will first generate the 6 diagrams.\n    *   Then, it will start with one diagram and apply all possible translation and rotation operations to find all other diagrams in its equivalence class.\n    *   By counting how many distinct classes are needed to cover all 6 diagrams, we find our answer. Based on knot theory, we expect all 6 diagrams to be equivalent, resulting in a single unique diagram.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of unique minimal grid diagrams for the\n    left-hand trefoil knot, up to grid translation and rotation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Helper functions and constants ---\n    # A grid diagram is represented by a pair of permutations (sigma, tau).\n    # We will use 0-indexed tuples for permutations, e.g., (1, 2, 0).\n\n    def perm_inverse(p):\n        \"\"\"Computes the inverse of a permutation.\"\"\"\n        inverse = [0] * len(p)\n        for i, val in enumerate(p):\n            inverse[val] = i\n        return tuple(inverse)\n\n    def perm_multiply(p1, p2):\n        \"\"\"Computes the composition of two permutations, p1(p2(i)).\"\"\"\n        return tuple(p1[p2[i]] for i in range(len(p1)))\n\n    # The minimal grid number for a trefoil knot is 3.\n    n = 3\n\n    # Define permutations for geometric transformations.\n    # w is the reversal permutation for rotations: w(i) = n-1-i\n    w = tuple(range(n - 1, -1, -1))\n    # c is the cyclic shift permutation for translations: c(i) = (i+1)%n\n    c = tuple([(i + 1) % n for i in range(n)])\n\n    # --- Step 2: Generate all left-hand trefoil diagrams ---\n    # A grid diagram (s, t) is a trefoil if s * t_inverse is a 3-cycle.\n    # By convention, pi = (2, 0, 1) corresponds to the left-hand trefoil.\n    pi_left = (2, 0, 1)\n\n    # Generate all permutations of (0, 1, 2).\n    all_perms = list(itertools.permutations(range(n)))\n\n    # Find all (s, t) pairs for the left-hand trefoil.\n    left_trefoil_diagrams = set()\n    for t in all_perms:\n        s = perm_multiply(pi_left, t)\n        left_trefoil_diagrams.add((s, t))\n\n    # --- Step 3: Count the number of unique diagrams (orbits) ---\n    # We perform a search to find how many equivalence classes (orbits) the\n    # diagrams fall into under the actions of translation and rotation.\n\n    unvisited = left_trefoil_diagrams.copy()\n    num_orbits = 0\n\n    while unvisited:\n        num_orbits += 1\n        # Start a new orbit search from an unvisited diagram.\n        root = unvisited.pop()\n        queue = [root]\n        head = 0\n\n        while head < len(queue):\n            s, t = queue[head]\n            head += 1\n\n            # Generate all possible equivalent diagrams from (s, t).\n            transforms = set()\n            c_inv = perm_inverse(c)\n\n            # 1.
