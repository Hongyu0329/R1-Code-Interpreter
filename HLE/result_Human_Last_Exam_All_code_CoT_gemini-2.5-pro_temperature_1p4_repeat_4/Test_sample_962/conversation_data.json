    "Designing a cryptographically secure protocol from scratch is a task that requires extensive peer review and formal security analysis by academic experts. A flawed design can lead to catastrophic security failures. Therefore, instead of inventing a new scheme, we will describe and implement a simplified version of a well-regarded, state-of-the-art protocol that meets your requirements: **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)**.\n\nFROST is a **t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme** based on the Schnorr signature algorithm. It is highly valued because:\n1.  **Efficiency**: Its signing protocol requires only **two rounds** of communication if a preprocessing round is done in advance.\n2.  **Security**: It has a **tight security proof**, meaning its security is very close to the hardness of the underlying mathematical problem (the Discrete Logarithm Problem). This allows for choosing smaller, more efficient parameters without sacrificing security.\n3.  **Flexibility**: It is robust against participant dropouts and supports concurrent signing sessions.\n\nHere is the plan for our demonstration:\n1.  **Setup**: We will define the basic cryptographic parameters and the number of participants (`n`) and the threshold (`t`).\n2.  **Key Generation**: A trusted dealer will generate a master key pair. The secret key will be split into `n` shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing and distributed to the participants.\n3.  **Signing Protocol (2 Rounds)**:\n    *   **Round 1 (Commitment)**: A threshold `t` of participants will generate secret nonces and broadcast public commitments to those nonces. This can be done ahead of time.\n    *   **Round 2 (Signature Share Generation)**: Once a message is known, the participants will use their secret shares and nonces to compute and broadcast their individual signature shares.\n4.  **Aggregation & Verification**: A coordinator gathers the signature shares, aggregates them into a single final signature, and verifies it against the master public key.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this entire process. For educational clarity, it uses basic modular arithmetic with small numbers instead of elliptic curves used in a real-world implementation. The code will print out all the values involved in each step, including the final verification equation.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport hashlib\n\n# Step 1: Setup\n# We use a Schnorr-like scheme over integers modulo a prime p.\n# q is a prime that divides p-1.\n# g is a generator of a subgroup of order q.\n# For this example, p=23, q=11, and g=4.
