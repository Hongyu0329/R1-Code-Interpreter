    Calculates the theoretical upper bound on mapping completeness based on Statement D.

    The problem involves mapping an ontology O₁ (with mergeable siblings) to
    O₂ (with a strict tree structure). This structural mismatch causes information loss.
    Statement D provides an information-theoretic bound for this loss.

    The bound is given by ln(b)/d, where:
    - b is the branching factor, representing the amount of information/choice at each level.
    - d is the depth, over which the information loss is amortized.
