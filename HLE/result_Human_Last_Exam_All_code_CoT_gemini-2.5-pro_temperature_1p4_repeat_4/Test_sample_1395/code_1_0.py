    # Step 1: Define the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution.

    # The dissolution created new, mutually bordering states in Central Asia.
    # This formed a new subgraph structure known as a Wheel Graph (W6).
    # Hub: Uzbekistan.

    # A W6 graph is not 3-colorable; it has a chromatic number of 4.
