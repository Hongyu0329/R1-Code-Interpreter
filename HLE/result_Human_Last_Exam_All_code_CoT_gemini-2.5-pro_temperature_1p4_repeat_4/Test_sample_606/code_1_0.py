    # density of relativistic species (like neutrinos) relative to photons.
    # Its value is experimentally constrained and theoretically predicted.
    N_eff_SM = 3.044

    # The problem describes a new, out-of-equilibrium massive particle.
    # This particle decays, converting its rest-mass energy into kinetic energy.
    # Crucially, it decays "solely into neutrinos".
    # This means it injects extra energy *only* into the neutrino population.

    # This injection of energy is equivalent to adding a new, positive contribution
    # to the total energy density of the neutrino sector. We can represent this
    # as a positive change to N_eff, let's call it Delta_N_eff.
    # The exact value of Delta_N_eff depends on the mass and abundance of the
    # new particle, but we know it must be greater than zero.
    # For this demonstration, we'll use an illustrative value.
    Delta_N_eff = 0.5  # An arbitrary positive value representing the new physics contribution.

    # The new value of N_eff is the original Standard Model value plus the
    # additional contribution from the decaying particle.
