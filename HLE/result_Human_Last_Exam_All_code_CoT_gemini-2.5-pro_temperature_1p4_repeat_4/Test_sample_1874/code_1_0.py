    This function solves the problem of finding the second smallest cardinal
    for the described tower.

    The reasoning is based on set theory and cardinal characteristics:

    1.  The problem describes a tower <x_alpha> of subsets of omega_2. Let's analyze
        the conditions. The relation between the sets, |x_beta \ x_alpha| < omega_2 for
        alpha < beta, defines a preorder. The final condition states that the tower
        has no lower bound of size omega_2 in this preorder.

    2.  The minimal length of such a tower is a cardinal characteristic known as the
        dominating number at omega_2, denoted d(omega_2). This is the smallest
        possible value for delta.

    3.  The value of d(omega_2) is not provably a specific cardinal like omega_3 in
        ZFC alone. However, by a theorem of Shelah, d(kappa) = 2^kappa for regular
        cardinals kappa like omega_2, under assumptions that are satisfied by the
        Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH).

    4.  Assuming GCH (which states 2^omega_n = omega_{n+1} for all n), we get:
        d(omega_2) = 2^omega_2 = omega_3.
        So, the smallest cardinal delta is omega_3.

    5.  The set of all possible lengths for such a tower is the set of all
        cardinals greater than or equal to this minimum value.
        Thus, the smallest possible cardinal is delta_1 = omega_3.
        The second smallest is the next cardinal, delta_2 = (omega_3)^+ = omega_4.

    6.  The final code will output the relationship between the indices of these
        cardinals as an equation.
