    "My plan is to answer your historical/theological question, but as per your instructions, I will format the response as a Python script.\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know which Christian theologian first developed terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, specifically applying it to the virgin birth and the Fall.\n2.  **Research and Identify the Theologian:** The most prominent and earliest figure to develop such a systematic framework is Augustine of Hippo. He introduced key concepts to explain how God could act in ways that seem to violate natural laws.\n3.  **Explain the Concepts:** Augustine's main ideas include:\n    *   **Miracles vs. Nature:** He argued that miracles are not *contrary to nature* itself, but rather *contrary to our knowledge of nature*. In his view, the will of God is the ultimate law of nature.\n    *   **Seminal Reasons (Rationes Seminales):** He proposed that God embedded latent potentials or \"seminal reasons\" into creation from the very beginning. A miracle, like the virgin birth, could be the activation of one of these pre-ordained potentialities rather than a violation of an existing order. This framework also allows for discussing how nature was changed after the Fall.\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will place the detailed explanation inside a Python `print()` statement within a Python code block as requested. The instruction about an \"equation\" does not apply to this question, so I will print the textual answer.\n\n```python\n# The user has asked a theological question and requested the answer in a Python code block.\n# This script will print the name and a brief explanation of the theologian who fits the description.\n\ntheologian_info = \"\"\"The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD).\n\nAugustine proposed that events we perceive as miracles are not truly \"against nature\" (contra naturam) but are instead \"against what is known to us of nature\" (contra notam nobis naturam). He reasoned that the will of God is the ultimate law and true nature of all created things.\n\nHe also developed the concept of \"seminal reasons\" (rationes seminales), suggesting that God placed latent potentialities within creation from the beginning. A unique event like the virgin birth could therefore be the unfolding of a pre-ordained potential by God's will, rather than a violation of existing law. This framework was also used to explain the changes in the natural order that resulted from the Fall of Man.\"\"\"\n\nprint(theologian_info)\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
