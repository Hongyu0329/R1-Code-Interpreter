theologian_info = """The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD).

Augustine proposed that events we perceive as miracles are not truly "against nature" (contra naturam) but are instead "against what is known to us of nature" (contra notam nobis naturam). He reasoned that the will of God is the ultimate law and true nature of all created things.

He also developed the concept of "seminal reasons" (rationes seminales), suggesting that God placed latent potentialities within creation from the beginning. A unique event like the virgin birth could therefore be the unfolding of a pre-ordained potential by God's will, rather than a violation of existing law. This framework was also used to explain the changes in the natural order that resulted from the Fall of Man."""
