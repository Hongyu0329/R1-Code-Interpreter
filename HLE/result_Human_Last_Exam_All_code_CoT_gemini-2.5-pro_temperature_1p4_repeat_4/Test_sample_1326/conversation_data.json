    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ from $x=0$ to $x=4$.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n- $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$ for $0 \\le x \\le 3$\n- $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$ for $3 \\le x \\le 5$\n\nSince the definition of the function $p(x)$ changes at $x=3$, we must split the integral into two parts:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} p(x) dx + \\int_{3}^{4} p(x) dx $$\n\nThis translates to:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx + \\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x} dx $$\n\nI will use Python's `scipy` library to numerically calculate the value of each integral and then sum them to find the total. The following code will perform these steps and print the final equation with the calculated values.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef p(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines the piecewise function p(x).\n    \"\"\"\n    if 0 <= x <= 3:\n        return (2 * x**3) / 8\n    elif 3 < x <= 5:\n        return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n    else:\n        return 0\n\n# Since the integration range is from 0 to 4, we need to split the integral\n# at x=3 where the function definition changes.\n\n# Part 1: Integral from 0 to 3\nintegral_part1, error1 = quad(lambda x: (2 * x**3) / 8, 0, 3)\n\n# Part 2: Integral from 3 to 4\nintegral_part2, error2 = quad(lambda x: (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x)), 3, 4)\n\n# Total integral is the sum of the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral_part1 + integral_part2\n\nprint(f\"The integral is split into two parts at x=3:\")\nprint(f\"First part (from 0 to 3): {integral_part1}\")\nprint(f\"Second part (from 3 to 4): {integral_part2}\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{integral_part1} + ({integral_part2}) = {total_integral}\")\nprint(f\"The total integral from x=0 to x=4 is {total_integral}\")\n\n```\n<<<-397.4659149818413>>>"
