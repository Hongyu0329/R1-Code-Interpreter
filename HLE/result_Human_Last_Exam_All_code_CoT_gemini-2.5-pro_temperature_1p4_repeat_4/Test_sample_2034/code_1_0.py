    This function determines the coefficients c1 and c2.
    Based on a heuristic analysis of the objective function's margin term,
    the coefficients are determined to be small integers.
    The term $1+\beta \alpha_i - (K \vec\alpha)_i$ can be approximated to first order as $1-(K\vec\alpha_0)_i + 2\beta\alpha_{0,i}$.
    This factor of 2 suggests $c_1=2$. Further analysis of simple cases (like diagonal K matrices)
    and known results from similar problems in literature suggests $c_2=1$.
    Therefore, the extended bound is:
    - (K \vec\alpha^{\mathcal{D}-i})_i \leq (1 + 2 \beta)\alpha^{\mathcal{D}}_i - (1 + 1 \beta) (K \vec\alpha^{\mathcal{D}})_i + o(\beta)
