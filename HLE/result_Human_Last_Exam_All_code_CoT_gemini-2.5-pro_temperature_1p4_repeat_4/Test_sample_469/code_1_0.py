# Step 1: Define the constants and given values.
# The pKa of Bromophenol blue is approximately 4.1.
pKa = 4.1
# The pH of the solution is given.
pH = 4.21
# The two path lengths are given in mm and cm. We convert them to cm.
path_length_thin_cm = 1 / 10 # 1 mm = 0.1 cm
path_length_thick_cm = 10 # 10 cm

# Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the ratio of the basic (blue) form to the acidic (yellow) form.
# The equation is: pH = pKa + log10([Base]/[Acid])
# Rearranging for the ratio: [Base]/[Acid] = 10^(pH - pKa)

ratio = 10**(pH - pKa)

print("1. Determine the ratio of indicator forms using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.")
print(f"The equation is: pH = pKa + log([Blue Form] / [Yellow Form])")
print(f"Plugging in the values: {pH} = {pKa} + log([Blue Form] / [Yellow Form])")
print(f"Solving for the ratio: [Blue Form] / [Yellow Form] = 10^({pH} - {pKa})")
print(f"The ratio of the blue form to the yellow form is: {ratio:.2f}")
print("\nSince the ratio is close to 1, both yellow and blue forms are present in significant amounts, making the solution appear green.\n")

# Step 3: Explain the effect of path length using the Beer-Lambert Law.
# A = ebc, so Absorbance is proportional to path length 'b'.
path_ratio = path_length_thick_cm / path_length_thin_cm

print("2. Analyze the effect of path length on color intensity.")
print("According to the Beer-Lambert Law, the amount of light absorbed is directly proportional to the path length.")
print(f"Path length of the thin side: {path_length_thin_cm} cm")
print(f"Path length of the thick side: {path_length_thick_cm} cm")
print(f"The path length through the thick side is {path_ratio:.0f} times longer than through the thin side.")
print("This means the color will be significantly more intense when viewed through the thick side.\n")

# Step 4: Conclude the final colors.
print("3. Final Conclusion:")
print("Thin side: A short path length results in low absorbance, so the color will be light green.")
print("Thick side: A long path length results in high absorbance, so the color will be a deep, intense green.")
print("-" * 25)
print("\nThis corresponds to Answer Choice C.")
