    # 1. Locate the start '@', goal 'g', and danger 'D'.
    # From visual inspection of the map:
    # - Adventurer '@' is at coordinates (row=3, col=25).
    # - Gold 'g' is at coordinates (row=3, col=4).
    # - Dragon 'D' is at coordinates (row=10, col=25).

    # 2. Evaluate the possible paths.
    # Path A: The direct horizontal path.
    # This path involves moving from (3, 25) to (3, 4) along the same row.
    # The path is clear, passing through a door '+' at (3, 7).
    # The dragon is far away at (10, 25), making this path very safe.

    # Path B: A path that involves vertical movement.
    # For example, moving down from the adventurer's starting position.
    # This would lead towards the hallway where the dragon 'D' is located.
    # This path is clearly much more dangerous.

    # 3. Select the least dangerous path.
    # Path A is the safest as it completely avoids the dragon's area.

    # 4. Describe the path using the required format.
    # The entire journey is a continuous movement from right to left.
    # As per the instructions, this is represented by a single letter 'L'.
