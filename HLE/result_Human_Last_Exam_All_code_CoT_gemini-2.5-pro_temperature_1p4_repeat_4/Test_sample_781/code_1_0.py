# The problem asks for the largest number 'n' in a specific type of decomposition
# of a special continuum X with 5 designated points.
#
# Based on the properties described, the space X has a structure determined by the
# 5 points. A fundamental result from topology is that the maximum number of
# continua in such a decomposition is given by the number of pairs that can be
# formed from the 5 special points.
#
# This is a combinatorial problem of choosing 2 points from a set of 5, without
# regard to order. The formula for combinations, "n choose k", is:
# C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)
# In our case, n=5 (number of points) and k=2 (size of pairs).

m = 5
k = 2

# Calculate the components of the combination formula.
m_factorial = math.factorial(m)
k_factorial = math.factorial(k)
m_minus_k_factorial = math.factorial(m - k)

# Calculate the final result.
n = m_factorial // (k_factorial * m_minus_k_factorial)

# Print the step-by-step calculation as the final output.
