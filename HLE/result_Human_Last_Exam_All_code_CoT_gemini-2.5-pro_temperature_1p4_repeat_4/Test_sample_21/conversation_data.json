    "The user wants to find the natural density of primes $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is irreducible modulo $p$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **State the Theoretical Framework**: The problem can be solved using the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This theorem connects the density of primes with certain factorization properties to the structure of the Galois group of the polynomial. Specifically, the density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible mod $p$ is the ratio of the number of elements in the Galois group that are 7-cycles to the total order of the group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group**: To apply the theorem, we need to find the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   First, we establish that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Eisenstein's criterion for $p=2$ works here. This means $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_7$.\n    *   Next, we compute the discriminant of the polynomial. If the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number, the Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_7$.\n    *   We then list the possible transitive subgroups of $A_7$. These are known to be $C_7$ (the cyclic group), $PSL(3,2)$ (the projective special linear group), and $A_7$ itself.\n    *   We can eliminate $C_7$ by examining the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo a small prime like 5. This will show a factorization pattern that is incompatible with a cyclic group of order 7.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Density**:\n    *   The remaining candidates for the Galois group are $PSL(3,2)$ and $A_7$.\n    *   For each candidate group, we calculate the proportion of its elements that are 7-cycles.\n    *   We will find that this proportion is the same for both $PSL(3,2)$ and $A_7$.\n\n4.  **Final Answer**: Since the density is the same regardless of which of the remaining groups is the true Galois group, we can state the final answer.\n\nThe following Python script will carry out the computational parts of this plan and print the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.abc import x\nfrom math import factorial, gcd\n\n# Step 1: Define the polynomial and state the theoretical context.\nprint(\"Consider the polynomial f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22.\")\nprint(\"=\" * 60)\nprint(\"According to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the natural density of prime numbers p\")\nprint(\"such that f(x) remains irreducible modulo p is equal to the proportion of\")\nprint(\"elements in the Galois group G of f(x) that are 7-cycles.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\n# Step 2: Determine properties of the Galois Group G.\nprint(\"Step 2a: Check irreducibility over Q.\")\nprint(\"The polynomial f(x) is irreducible over Q by Eisenstein's criterion for p=2.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, G is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group S_7.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\nprint(\"Step 2b: Compute the discriminant.\")\nf = x**7 - 14*x**5 + 56*x**3 - 56*x + 22\nD = sympy.discriminant(f)\nprint(f\"The discriminant of f(x) is D = {D}.\")\n\nis_square, root_D = sympy.perfect_power(D, 2)\nif is_square:\n    print(f\"The discriminant is a perfect square: D = {root_D}^2.\")\n    print(\"This implies that the Galois group G is a subgroup of the alternating group A_7.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The discriminant is not a perfect square, so G is not a subgroup of A_7.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\nprint(\"Step 2c: Identify possible groups.\")\nprint(\"The transitive subgroups of A_7 are C_7 (cyclic, order 7), PSL(3,2) (order 168), and A_7 (order 2520).\")\nprint(\"By analyzing f(x) mod 5, we can show that G cannot be C_7.
