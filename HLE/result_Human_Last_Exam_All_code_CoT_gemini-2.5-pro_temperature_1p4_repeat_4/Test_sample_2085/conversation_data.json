    "To find the French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\", we need to consider the linguistic evolution from the Latinized form to modern French.\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Name**: \"Odobeccus\" is the Latin version of a name, likely of Germanic (Frankish) origin, as its most famous bearer was a Frankish general. The Latin suffix for masculine names is \"-us\", which needs to be removed. Removing it gives us the base \"Odobecc\".\n2.  **Simplify the Consonants**: Old French and modern French tend to simplify double consonants, especially at the end of a word. The double 'c' (`cc`), which was pronounced as /k/, simplifies to a single 'c'.\n3.  **Final Form**: Applying this simplification, \"Odobecc\" becomes \"Odebec\".\n\nTherefore, the most direct French equivalent of \"Odobeccus\" is \"Odebec\". The following Python code will print this name.\n\n```python\n# The Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" is a Latinized form.\n# To find its French equivalent, we perform two main steps:\n# 1. Remove the Latin masculine ending \"-us\".\n#    \"Odobeccus\" -> \"Odobecc\"\n# 2. Simplify the final double consonant \"cc\" to \"c\", a common process in the evolution of French.\n#    \"Odobecc\" -> \"Odebec\"\n\nfrench_equivalent = \"Odebec\"\nprint(f\"The French equivalent of 'Odobeccus' is: {french_equivalent}\")\n```\n<<<Odebec>>>"
