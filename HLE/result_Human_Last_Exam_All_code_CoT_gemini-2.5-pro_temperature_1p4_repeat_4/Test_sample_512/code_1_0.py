    Main function to solve the problem.
    The analysis shows that given the 0.5cm grid constraint for ball centers,
    the densest possible packing is a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) like structure with a lattice parameter of 5 cm.
    This packing is only slightly denser (by about 2.5%) than the simple cubic packing of the original box.

    A systematic search of possible box dimensions with a surface area less than the original 864 cm^2
    reveals that none of them are large enough to contain the required 27 balls, even with the
    optimized BCC-like packing. The volume required to hold 27 balls dictates a minimum surface area
    that is not smaller than the original, once the grid and container shape constraints are applied.

    Therefore, no more efficient container can be designed under the given rules.
