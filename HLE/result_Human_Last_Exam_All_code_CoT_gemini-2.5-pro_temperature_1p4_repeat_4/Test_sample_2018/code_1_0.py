    """
    This function calculates and prints the value of the computational factor
    from the prior simulation-only paper by Voller and Prakash (1987).

    The paper describes a source term added to the momentum equation for
    simulating phase change, which takes the form: S = -A * u, where A is
    a porosity function based on the Carman-Kozeny equation.

    The porosity function is given by: A = C * (1-f)^2 / (f^3 + b)

    The question asks for the value of 'C', the mushy zone constant or
    computational factor, from the prior work.
