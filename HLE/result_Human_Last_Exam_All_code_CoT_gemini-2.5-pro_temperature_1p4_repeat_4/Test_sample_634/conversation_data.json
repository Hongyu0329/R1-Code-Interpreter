    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use a method based on the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials. This involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Form a stacked matrix**: We create a single larger matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`.\n    ```\n    M = [ P1 ]\n        [ P2 ]\n    ```\n2.  **Row reduction**: We apply elementary row operations to this stacked matrix `M` to transform it into its row-echelon form. The elementary operations involve adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n3.  **Identify the GCRD**: The resulting matrix will have a block of non-zero rows at the top and a block of zero rows at the bottom. The block of non-zero rows constitutes the greatest common right divisor, `G(s)`.\n\nI will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform these polynomial matrix operations accurately. The code will construct the matrices, form the stacked matrix, and then compute its row-reduced echelon form to find the GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of\n    two given polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.symbols('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2 as given in the problem\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The given matrices are:\")\n    print(\"P1(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nP2(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P2)\n    \n    # To find the GCRD, we form a stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    # and find its row-echelon form.\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n\n    # The .rref() method computes the row-reduced echelon form.\n    # The non-zero rows of the resulting matrix form the GCRD.\n    M_rref = M.rref(pivots=False)\n\n    # Extract the non-zero rows which form the GCRD matrix G.\n    first_zero_row = -1\n    for i in range(M_rref.rows):\n        if M_rref.row(i).is_zero:\n            first_zero_row = i\n            break\n    \n    if first_zero_row == -1: # Case where there are no zero rows\n        G = M_rref\n    else:\n        G = M_rref[:first_zero_row, :]\n\n    print(\"\\nThe greatest common right divisor G(s) is:\")\n    \n    # Print the resulting GCRD matrix, showing each element of the \"equation\"\n    for i in range(G.rows):\n        row_elements = []\n        for j in range(G.cols):\n            row_elements.append(str(G[i, j]))\n        print(f\"[{'   '.join(row_elements)}]\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_gcrd()\n```\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
