    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants:** First, I'll determine the chemical structures of the two reactants: the aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and the Wittig reagent ((2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane).\n2.  **Understand the Reaction Mechanism:** The Wittig reaction forms a carbon-carbon double bond by combining the carbonyl group of an aldehyde/ketone with a phosphorus ylide. The general transformation is `R₂C=O + R'₂C=PPh₃ → R₂C=CR'₂ + O=PPh₃`.\n3.  **Predict the Product Structure:** I will combine the carbon backbone from the pivalaldehyde with the carbon backbone from the ylide to form the new alkene product.\n4.  **Determine Stereochemistry:** The ylide in this reaction is non-stabilized, which typically leads to the formation of the Z-isomer (cis-alkene) as the major product. I will determine the structure of this major isomer.\n5.  **Name the Product:** I'll determine the correct IUPAC name for the major alkene product, including the (Z) stereochemical descriptor.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script using the `rdkit` library to programmatically perform the reaction. This script will confirm the product's structure and generate its IUPAC name and SMILES string, fulfilling the request to provide a coding solution. The code will also extract and display the numbers from the product's name as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to determine and display the reaction product:\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have rdkit installed:\n# pip install rdkit\n# Note: rdkit can sometimes be tricky to install. Using conda is often easiest:\n# conda install -c conda-forge rdkit\n\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n    # The rdIUPAC module might not be included in all RDKit installations.\n    # We will include a fallback if it's not available.\n    try:\n        from rdkit.Chem.rdIUPAC import MolToIUPACName\n        iupac_available = True\n    except ImportError:\n        iupac_available = False\n        print(\"Warning: rdIUPAC module not found.
