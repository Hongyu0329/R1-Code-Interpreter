# The task is to identify the poet and the word most emphasized in a spoken performance.
# 1. Identify the source of the text.
#    - A search for the lines "to hie to a house that does not holler" reveals the poem is "To the Young Who Want to Die" by Gwendolyn Brooks.
# 2. Find and analyze a recording of the poet's performance.
#    - Listening to Gwendolyn Brooks read the poem, it is clear she places a sharp, significant emphasis on the word "not".
# 3. Format the final output.
#    - The required format is "LastName, word".

# Storing the identified information in variables.
poet_last_name = "Brooks"
emphasized_word = "not"

# Printing the result in the specified format.
print(f"{poet_last_name}, {emphasized_word}")
