    # --- Plan Derivations ---
    # 1. Model one cell:
    #    A cell is an H-network with two series capacitors 'c' and one shunt 'c'.
    #    When this cell is loaded with a capacitor C_out, its input capacitance C_in
    #    is found by circuit analysis.
    #
    # 2. Recurrence Relation:
    #    The derived relation is C_in = f(C_out), where
    #    f(C_out) = (c^2 + c*C_out) / (3*c + 2*C_out).
    #
    # 3. Fixed-Point Condition:
    #    For C_in to be independent of the number of cells, the capacitance
    #    must be a fixed point C_eq, satisfying C_eq = f(C_eq).
    #
    # 4. Solving for C_eq:
    #    C_eq = (c^2 + c*C_eq) / (3*c + 2*C_eq)
    #    C_eq * (3*c + 2*C_eq) = c^2 + c*C_eq
    #    3*c*C_eq + 2*C_eq^2 = c^2 + c*C_eq
    #    This simplifies to the quadratic equation: 2*C_eq^2 + 2*c*C_eq - c^2 = 0.
    #
    # 5. Value of x:
    #    The terminating capacitor x must be equal to this characteristic
    #    capacitance C_eq.
