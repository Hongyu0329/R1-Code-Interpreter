    "This sequence is a list of \"practical numbers\" (also known as panarithmic numbers), which are positive integers `n` such that all smaller positive integers can be represented as sums of distinct divisors of `n`. The specific sequence appears to be practical numbers that are not also \"perfect numbers,\" but since the next known perfect number is very large, we can simplify the problem to finding the next practical number in order.\n\nA number is practical if and only if its prime factorization meets certain conditions. According to Stewart's theorem (1954), an integer `n > 1` with prime factorization `n = p_1^{a_1} * p_2^{a_2} * ... * p_k^{a_k}` (with primes `p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_k`) is practical if and only if:\n1. The first prime, `p_1`, is 2.\n2. For each subsequent prime `p_i` (from `i=2` to `k`), the prime must be less than or equal to the sum of the divisors of the preceding part of the prime factorization, plus one. That is, `p_i <= sigma(p_1^{a_1} * p_2^{a_2} * ... * p_{i-1}^{a_{i-1}}) + 1`. The function `sigma(x)` denotes the sum of the divisors of `x`.\n\nThe last number given in the sequence is 2352. My plan is to write a script that checks each subsequent integer (2353, 2354, and so on) to see if it qualifies as a practical number based on the conditions above. The first number that satisfies the conditions will be the answer.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this search and, once it finds the next practical number, it will print the verification steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the prime factorization of a number.\n    Returns a dictionary of {prime: exponent}.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef sum_of_divisors_from_factors(factors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of divisors (sigma function) from a prime factorization dict.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = 1\n    for p, a in factors.items():\n        s *= (p**(a + 1) - 1) // (p - 1)\n    return s\n\ndef is_practical(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is practical using Stewart's theorem.\n    Returns True if practical, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0: return False\n    if n == 1: return True\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    primes = sorted(factors.keys())\n    \n    # Condition 1: First prime must be 2.\n    if primes[0] != 2:\n        return False\n        \n    # Condition 2: p_i <= sigma(...) + 1\n    running_product_factors = {}\n    for p in primes:\n        a = factors[p]\n        # Calculate sigma for the product of factors processed so far\n        # For the first prime (2), sigma is compared against p_1, but that check is done above.\n        # This condition is for p_2, p_3, ...\n        if p != 2:\n            sigma_prev = sum_of_divisors_from_factors(running_product_factors)\n            if p > sigma_prev + 1:\n                return False\n\n        running_product_factors[p] = a\n        \n    return True\n\ndef find_and_verify_next_practical_number(start_num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the next practical number after start_num and prints the verification.\n    \"\"\"\n    num = start_num + 1\n    while True:\n        if is_practical(num):\n            next_practical_num = num\n            break\n        num += 1\n\n    print(f\"The next number in the sequence is: {next_practical_num}\\n\")\n    print(f\"Verification that {next_practical_num} is a practical number:\")\n\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(next_practical_num)\n    primes = sorted(factors.keys())\n    \n    factor_str = \" * \".join([f\"{p}^{e}\" for p, e in factors.items()])\n    print(f\"1.
