def propose_methanol_charges():
    """
    Proposes a reasonable set of partial charges for methanol and verifies its neutrality.

    This function is based on the following reasoning:
    1.  Electronegativity: Oxygen is the most electronegative atom and should be negative. The hydroxyl hydrogen, bonded to oxygen, will be strongly positive. Carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the methyl hydrogens should be slightly positive. The carbon atom, bonded to a very electronegative oxygen, will also be positive.
    2.  Symmetry: The three methyl hydrogens are chemically equivalent and should have identical charges.
    3.  Net Charge Neutrality: The sum of all partial charges must be zero for a neutral molecule.

    Analyzing the choices, only option D satisfies all these criteria. Options A, B, and C have chemically incorrect negative charges on the methyl hydrogens. Option E incorrectly breaks the symmetry of the methyl group. Option D provides a chemically sound, symmetric, and neutral charge distribution.
