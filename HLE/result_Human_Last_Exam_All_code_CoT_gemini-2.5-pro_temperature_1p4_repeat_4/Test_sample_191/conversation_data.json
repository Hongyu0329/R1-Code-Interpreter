    "This is a biological question rather than a coding problem. I will provide a direct answer to your question.\n\nThe protein is **Complement component 3 (C3)**.\n\nWhen the complement immune pathway is activated, the C3 protein is broken down (cleaved) into smaller fragments, including C3b. This C3b fragment then binds to the surface of targets like amyloid plaques. This process, called opsonization, essentially tags the amyloid as something to be eliminated. Macrophages (and microglia in the brain) have receptors that recognize C3b, which then triggers them to engulf and clear the amyloid.\n\n<<<Complement C3>>>"
