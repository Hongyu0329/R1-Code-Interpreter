    "To answer this question, I will determine the rarest noble gas on Earth by comparing the abundance of all noble gases.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  First, I will identify the noble gases: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n2.  Next, I will research their respective abundances in Earth's matter. The most standardized measure for these gases is their concentration in the atmosphere.\n3.  I will then compare these values. Radon is a radioactive gas with a very short half-life, which makes it exceedingly rare at any given moment. Its abundance is many orders of magnitude lower than that of Xenon, the rarest stable noble gas.\n4.  The atmospheric concentration of Radon is estimated to be around 1 part per 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1 part in 10^21).\n5.  I will convert this tiny fraction into a percentage for the final output.\n6.  Finally, I will create a Python script to display the name of the gas and its incredibly low percentage abundance. The data from 2002 is consistent with current data for this purpose.\n\n```python\n# The rarest noble gas on Earth is Radon (Rn).\n# Its extreme rarity is due to its radioactivity and short half-life (the most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of about 3.8 days).\n# Its concentration in the atmosphere is minuscule, on the order of 1 part per 10^21.\n\n# Define the gas and its abundance details.\ngas_name = \"Radon\"\n\n# Abundance as a fraction (1 part in 10^21)\nfractional_abundance = 1e-21\n\n# Convert the fractional abundance to a percentage.\n# Percentage = Fraction * 100\npercentage_abundance = fractional_abundance * 100\n\n# Print the final result, showing the numbers used.\nprint(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of atmospheric matter is {gas_name}.\")\nprint(f\"Its abundance is approximately 1 part per 10^21.\")\nprint(f\"To express this as a percentage, we calculate (1 / 1e21) * 100.\")\nprint(f\"The resulting percentage is: {percentage_abundance:.1e}%\")\n\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"
