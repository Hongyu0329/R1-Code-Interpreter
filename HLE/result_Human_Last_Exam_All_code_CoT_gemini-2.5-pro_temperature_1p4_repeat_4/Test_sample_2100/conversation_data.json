    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** The riddle provides several key pieces of information:\n    *   The poet is Andrei Voznesensky.\n    *   The person is described as a \"joy-discovering sailor.\"\n    *   His grave was lost and its location was rediscovered in the late 1980s.\n\n2.  **Connect the Poet to the Subject:** Andrei Voznesensky is famous for writing the libretto for the Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This opera is one of his most famous works and deals with a historical sea voyage.\n\n3.  **Identify the Protagonist:** The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. He was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer. His story involves a voyage to Japan and then to Spanish California in the early 1800s, which fits the description of a \"sailor\" involved in discovery.\n\n4.  **Verify the Grave's History:** Nikolai Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 while returning to St. Petersburg. He was buried at the Voskresensky Cathedral cemetery. This cathedral and its cemetery were destroyed by the Soviet government in the 1930s, and the exact location of his grave was lost.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Timeline:** Spurred by the immense popularity of the rock opera in the 1980s, there was renewed interest in Rezanov. In the late 1980s, historians and enthusiasts located the presumed site of his burial. A memorial was later placed there. This perfectly matches the clue that the answer to \"Where is your grave?\" emerged in the late 1980s.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The man described in the riddle is Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that prints this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the historical riddle by outlining the clues and connecting them to the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Clues from the riddle\n    poet = \"Andrei Voznesensky\"\n    description = \"a joy-discovering sailor\"\n    grave_mystery = \"Grave was lost, but its location rediscovered in the late 1980s\"\n    \n    # Reasoning\n    print(\"Analyzing the clues to find the man's last name:\")\n    print(f\"1. The poet, {poet}, wrote the libretto for the famous rock opera 'Juno and Avos'.\")\n    print(f\"2. The opera is about the historical figure Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov (1764-1807), a Russian explorer whose journey fits the description of a '{description}'.\")\n    print(f\"3. Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk. His grave was destroyed and lost for decades.\")\n    print(f\"4. The clue '{grave_mystery}' is the key. In the late 1980s, fueled by the opera's success, Rezanov's burial site was rediscovered.\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on these facts, the man's last name is:\")\n    \n    # The final answer\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n    print(last_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
