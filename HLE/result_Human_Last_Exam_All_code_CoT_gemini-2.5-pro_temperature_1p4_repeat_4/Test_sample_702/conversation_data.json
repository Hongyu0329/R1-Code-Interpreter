    "To determine the connectivity of the map `ε: Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6) → Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)`, we will follow a step-by-step procedure, leveraging key theorems from algebraic topology. The general plan is to relate our map `ε` to other, better-understood maps and then deduce its connectivity.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define Spaces and Notation:** We denote `X = S^4` and `Y = S^6`. The map is `ε: A → B`, where `A = Σ(ΩX ∧ ΩY)` and `B = Ω(X ∧ Y)`.\n2.  **Introduce Auxiliary Map `λ`:** We introduce an auxiliary map `λ: A → C`, where `C = Ω(X * Y) = ΩΣ(X ∧ Y)`. The map `λ` is `Σ(ΩX ∧ ΩY) → ΩΣ(X ∧ Y)`, and its connectivity is given by a known (though slightly corrected) theorem.\n3.  **Relate Maps:** The maps `ε` and `λ` are related by another map, `Ωi`, where `i: X ∧ Y → X * Y` is the natural inclusion. The relation is `λ = (Ωi) ∘ ε`.\n4.  **Calculate Connectivities:** We will calculate the connectivity of `Ωi` and `λ`.\n    *   The connectivity of `i` is given by a theorem from F. Cohen.\n    *   Looping a map decreases its connectivity by 1, so we find `conn(Ωi)`.\n    *   The connectivity of `λ` is given by a theorem (which we will correct by +1 based on a consistency check of its consequences).\n5.  **Deduce Connectivity of `ε`:** Using the composition `λ = (Ωi) ∘ ε` and the connectivities of `λ` and `Ωi`, we can determine the connectivity of `ε`.\n\nThe connectivity of a space `S` is the largest integer `k` such that `π_i(S) = 0` for `i ≤ k`.\nThe connectivity of a map `f` is the largest integer `k` such that the induced map on homotopy groups `π_i(f)` is an isomorphism for `i < k` and an epimorphism for `i = k`.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation.\n\n```python\n# A python script to calculate the connectivity of the map.\n# We will use functions to represent theorems from algebraic topology.\n\ndef conn_sphere(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the connectivity of the n-sphere S^n.\"\"\"\n    # S^n is (n-1)-connected.\n    return n - 1\n\ndef conn_loop(conn_X):\n    \"\"\"Returns the connectivity of the loop space ΩX.\"\"\"\n    # conn(ΩX) = conn(X) - 1, provided conn(X) >= 1.\n    if conn_X >= 1:\n        return conn_X - 1\n    return -1 # Not connected\n\ndef conn_suspension(conn_X):\n    \"\"\"Returns the connectivity of the suspension ΣX.\"\"\"\n    # conn(ΣX) = conn(X) + 1.\n    return conn_X + 1\n\ndef conn_smash(conn_X, conn_Y):\n    \"\"\"Returns the connectivity of the smash product X ∧ Y.\"\"\"\n    # conn(X ∧ Y) = conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1.\n    return conn_X + conn_Y + 1\n\n# Step 1: Define connectivities for our base spaces S^4 and S^6.\nconn_S4 = conn_sphere(4)\nconn_S6 = conn_sphere(6)\nprint(f\"Connectivity of S^4 is {conn_S4}.\")\nprint(f\"Connectivity of S^6 is {conn_S6}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 2: Define the source and target spaces of the map ε.\n# Source A = Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6)\nconn_Omega_S4 = conn_loop(conn_S4)\nconn_Omega_S6 = conn_loop(conn_S6)\nconn_smash_of_loops = conn_smash(conn_Omega_S4, conn_Omega_S6)\nconn_A = conn_suspension(conn_smash_of_loops)\n\n# Target B = Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)\nconn_S4_smash_S6 = conn_smash(conn_S4, conn_S6)\n# S^4 ∧ S^6 is homeomorphic to S^10\nconn_B = conn_loop(conn_S4_smash_S6)\n\nprint(f\"Connectivity of source space A = Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6) is {conn_A}.\")\nprint(f\"Connectivity of target space B = Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6) is {conn_B}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 3: Relate ε to other maps via the composition λ = (Ωi) ∘ ε.\n# The map i: S^4 ∧ S^6 → S^4 * S^6, where * is the join product.\n# S^4 * S^6 is homeomorphic to S^{4+6+1} = S^11.\n# Theorem (F.
