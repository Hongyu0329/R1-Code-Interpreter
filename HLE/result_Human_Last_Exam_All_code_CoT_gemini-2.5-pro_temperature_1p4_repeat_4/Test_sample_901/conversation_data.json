    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that explains the reaction and identifies the final product.\n\nThe reaction is an E2 elimination. The outcome is dictated by the stereochemical requirements of this mechanism, specifically within a cyclohexane ring system.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, sterically hindered base. This combination strongly favors an E2 elimination reaction.\n2.  **E2 Stereochemistry**: The E2 mechanism requires a specific geometry where the leaving group (Bromine) and a proton on an adjacent carbon (a beta-proton) are in an anti-periplanar arrangement. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means they must both be in axial positions and on opposite sides of the ring (trans-diaxial).\n3.  **Analyze Conformations**: The substrate must be in a chair conformation where the Bromine atom is axial for the reaction to occur. In this specific stereoisomer, (1S,2R), when the Bromine is forced into an axial position, the methyl group on the adjacent carbon (C2) is also forced into an axial position.\n4.  **Identify Available Protons**: We need to find a beta-proton that is axial and trans to the axial Bromine.\n    *   **At C2**: The proton is in an *equatorial* position because the methyl group is axial. Therefore, elimination cannot occur towards C2 to form 1-methylcyclohexene.\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two protons. One is axial, and the other is equatorial. The axial proton is correctly positioned (trans-diaxial) for elimination with the axial Bromine.\n5.  **Determine Product**: Since elimination can only occur by removing the axial proton from C6, the double bond forms between C1 and C6. This results in the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**. This outcome is an example of stereoelectronic control overriding Zaitsev's rule (which would have predicted the more substituted alkene, 1-methylcyclohexene).\n\nHere is the Python code to outline this process and present the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the product of the reaction between (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and potassium tert-butoxide.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    reactant = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"potassium tert-butoxide\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 elimination\"\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the reaction of {reactant} with {reagent}.\")\n    print(f\"This is an {reaction_type} reaction.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: The E2 reaction requires the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton (H) to be in a trans-diaxial (anti-periplanar) arrangement.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: For this to happen, the substrate must be in a chair conformation where the Br atom is in an axial position.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: In the required conformation with an axial Br:\")\n    print(\"  - At carbon C2, the methyl group is axial, so the beta-proton is equatorial.
