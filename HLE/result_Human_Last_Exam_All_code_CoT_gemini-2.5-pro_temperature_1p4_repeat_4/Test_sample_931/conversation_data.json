    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) feed on, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I'll research the known dietary habits of adult snakeflies from entomological sources.\n2.  I'll evaluate each answer choice based on this research.\n    *   A. Nectar: Check if they are known to visit flowers.\n    *   B. Māhoe pollen: Check for specific pollen consumption, especially from this New Zealand native plant.\n    *   C. Fungus: Check if they are fungivores.\n    *   D. Karamū leaf tissue: Check if they are herbivores.\n    *   E. Totara Aphids: Check if they are predatory on small insects like aphids.\n3.  Based on the evaluation, I will determine the most comprehensive and accurate answer from the given choices.\n4.  Finally, I will create a Python script that explains this reasoning and prints the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)\n    to determine the correct answer from the provided choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    question = \"Which of the following have Raphidiopterans been recorded feeding on as adults?\"\n    \n    choices = {\n        'A': \"Nectar\",\n        'B': \"Māhoe pollen\",\n        'C': \"Fungus\",\n        'D': \"Karamū leaf tissue\",\n        'E': \"Totara Aphids\",\n        'F': \"A and E\",\n        'G': \"D and E\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies):\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the known diet.\n    # Adult Raphidioptera are primarily predators, but also supplement their diet.\n    print(\"Step 1: Research indicates adult snakeflies are generalist predators of small, soft-bodied arthropods.\")\n    print(\"Step 2: They are also known to supplement their diet with pollen and nectar.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate each choice.\n    print(\"Evaluating the choices:\")\n    \n    # Analysis of A and E\n    print(\"Choice A (Nectar): This is correct.
