    "To evaluate the integral, I will use Python's symbolic mathematics library, `sympy`. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the integral**: The user wants to evaluate the bra-ket notation $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle$ where $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are $1s$ Slater orbitals. I will assume this is a one-center integral, meaning both orbitals are on the same atom and are identical, so $\\phi_i = \\phi_j = \\phi_{1s}$. This integral represents the expectation value of the potential energy of an electron in a $1s$ orbital interacting with a nucleus of charge +1 (in atomic units).\n\n2.  **Define the 1s Slater orbital**: The general form of a 1s Slater-Type Orbital (STO) is $\\phi_{1s}(r) = N e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $N$ is the normalization constant and $\\zeta$ (zeta) is the orbital exponent.\n\n3.  **Set up the calculation**: The full integral in spherical coordinates is $\\int \\phi_{1s}^* \\frac{1}{r} \\phi_{1s} \\, dV$, where the volume element is $dV = r^2 \\sin(\\theta) \\,dr \\,d\\theta \\,d\\phi$.\n\n4.  **Code implementation**: The Python code will first define the necessary symbolic variables. It will then explicitly calculate the normalization constant $N$ by solving $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle = 1$. Finally, it will use the normalized orbital to compute the desired integral $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle$ and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef evaluate_slater_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically evaluates the integral <phi_1s | 1/r | phi_1s> for a Slater-Type Orbital (STO)\n    using the sympy library.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Define symbolic variables ---\n    # r: radial distance\n    # theta: polar angle\n    # phi: azimuthal angle\n    # zeta: the orbital exponent, a positive real number\n    r, theta, phi, zeta = sympy.symbols('r theta phi zeta', real=True, positive=True)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Define the 1s Slater Orbital ---\n    # The unnormalized 1s Slater orbital has the functional form exp(-zeta*r).\n    # The full orbital is phi(r) = N * exp(-zeta*r), where N is the normalization constant.\n    phi_1s_unnormalized = sympy.exp(-zeta * r)\n    \n    print(\"This script evaluates the integral <phi_1s | 1/r | phi_1s>.\")\n    print(f\"The unnormalized 1s Slater orbital is defined as: {phi_1s_unnormalized}\\n\")\n    \n    # The volume element in spherical coordinates is r^2 * sin(theta)\n    volume_element = r**2 * sympy.sin(theta)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the Normalization Constant N ---\n    # The normalization condition is that the integral of |phi|^2 over all space is 1.\n    # Integral( (N * exp(-zeta*r))^2 * dV ) = 1\n    print(\"--- Calculating the Normalization Constant N ---\")\n    integrand_norm = phi_1s_unnormalized**2 * volume_element\n    \n    # We integrate over all space: r from 0 to infinity, theta from 0 to pi, phi from 0 to 2*pi\n    norm_integral_val = sympy.integrate(integrand_norm, (phi, 0, 2*sympy.pi), (theta, 0, sympy.pi), (r, 0, sympy.oo))\n    \n    print(f\"The normalization integral <phi_unnormalized|phi_unnormalized> is: {norm_integral_val}\")\n    \n    # From N^2 * norm_integral_val = 1, we find N.\n    N_squared = 1 / norm_integral_val\n    N = sympy.sqrt(N_squared)\n    phi_1s_normalized = N * phi_1s_unnormalized\n    \n    print(f\"The normalization constant squared, N^2, is: {N_squared}\")\n    print(f\"The normalized 1s Slater orbital is: {phi_1s_normalized}\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 4: Evaluate the expectation value <phi_1s | 1/r | phi_1s> ---\n    print(\"--- Evaluating the Integral <phi_1s | 1/r | phi_1s> ---\")\n    \n    # The operator is 1/r\n    operator = 1 / r\n    \n    # The integrand for the expectation value is (phi_normalized*) * operator * (phi_normalized) * dV\n    integrand_expectation = phi_1s_normalized.conjugate() * operator * phi_1s_normalized * volume_element\n    \n    print(\"The integrand is: (phi_normalized*) * (1/r) * (phi_normalized) * r^2 * sin(theta)\")\n    \n    # Perform the final triple integration\n    expectation_value = sympy.integrate(integrand_expectation, (phi, 0, 2*sympy.pi), (theta, 0, sympy.pi), (r, 0, sympy.oo))\n    \n    # --- Step 5: Display the Final Result ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Result ---\")\n    final_equation_str = f\"< phi_1s | 1/r | phi_1s > = {expectation_value}\"\n    print(final_equation_str)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    evaluate_slater_integral()\n```\n<<<zeta>>>"
