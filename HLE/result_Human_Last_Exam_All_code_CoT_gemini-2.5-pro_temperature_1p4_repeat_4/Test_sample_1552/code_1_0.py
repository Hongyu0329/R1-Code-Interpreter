# The formula for the second heat kernel coefficient density (b_1) for an operator
# of the form P = -Delta + E is given by tr( (1/6) * R * I + E ).
# For the square of the Dirac operator D^2, the endomorphism E is derived from
# the Lichnerowicz formula, E = (1/4) * R * I + gauge field terms.
# The term from the general formula is 1/6.
coeff1 = Fraction(1, 6)
# The term from the Lichnerowicz formula is 1/4.
coeff2 = Fraction(1, 4)

# The total numerical coefficient for the scalar curvature R term is the sum of these two.
total_coeff_R = coeff1 + coeff2

# In 4 spacetime dimensions (d=4), the dimension of the Dirac spinor representation (d_S) is 4.
d_S = 4

# The final coefficient for the term proportional to R inside the trace.
final_coeff_in_trace = total_coeff_R

# The trace needs to be taken over spinor and gauge group spaces.
# tr(c * R * I) = c * R * tr(I_spinor) * tr(I_gauge) = c * R * d_S * N
# where N is the dimension of the gauge group representation.
# So, the final coefficient density b_1 is:
# b_1 = (5/12) * R * d_S * N
final_coeff_density = total_coeff_R * d_S
