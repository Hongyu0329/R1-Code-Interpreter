    """
    Analyzes the existence of a function with specific properties related to infinite cardinals.
    This function prints a step-by-step logical argument to answer the question.

    print("This is a problem in infinitary combinatorics, a branch of set theory.")
    print("Let's break down the question and solve it step-by-step.")
    print("\n--- Step 1: Understanding the Premise ---")
    print("Let kappa be an infinite cardinal.")
    print("We are asked about the existence of a function f : [kappa+]^2 -> kappa.")
    print("  - The domain [kappa+]^2 is the set of all 2-element subsets of kappa+, the successor cardinal of kappa.")
    print("  - The codomain kappa is the set of all ordinals less than kappa.")
    print("This function 'f' is a 'coloring' of pairs of ordinals from kappa+ with kappa-many colors.")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Understanding the Condition ---")
    print("The condition is: for EVERY subset x of kappa+ with order type kappa+1, the image of the pairs from x under f must have size kappa.")
    print("In symbols: For every x subset of kappa+ with otp(x) = kappa+1, we must have |f''[x]^2| = kappa.")
    print("This means that for any such set x, the coloring 'f' when restricted to pairs from x must use exactly kappa colors.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: Invoking the Erdos-Rado Theorem ---")
    print("This problem can be solved by applying a fundamental result in set theory, the Erdos-Rado Theorem.")
    print("A specific case of this theorem is the partition relation: (kappa+) --> (kappa+1)^2_kappa.")
    print("This relation is a theorem of ZFC (standard set theory) and holds for ANY infinite cardinal kappa.")

    print("\n--- Step 4: Interpreting the Theorem ---")
    print("What does (kappa+) --> (kappa+1)^2_kappa mean?")
    print("It means that for ANY function f : [kappa+]^2 -> kappa (i.e., any coloring of pairs from kappa+ with kappa colors)...")
    print("...there EXISTS a subset H of kappa+ which is 'monochromatic' and has order type kappa+1.")
    print("'Monochromatic' means that all pairs of elements from H are colored with the same single color.")

    print("\n--- Step 5: Connecting the Theorem to the Problem ---")
    print("Let's consider any arbitrary function f : [kappa+]^2 -> kappa.")
    print("The Erdos-Rado theorem guarantees that we can find at least one set H, a subset of kappa+, with order type kappa+1, that is monochromatic.")
    print("Let the single color for this set H be 'c'. So, for any pair {a, b} from H, f({a, b}) = c.")
    print("Now, let's look at the size of the image of pairs from H under f.")
    print("The image set is f''[H]^2 = {c}.")
    print("The cardinality of this image set is |f''[H]^2| = 1.")

    print("\n--- Step 6: The Contradiction ---")
    print("The original problem requires a function 'f' such that for ALL sets x of order type kappa+1, the image size is kappa.")
    print("So, for those sets, the equation |f''[x]^2| = kappa must hold.")
    print("However, the Erdos-Rado theorem tells us that for ANY 'f', there is AT LEAST ONE set H of order type kappa+1 for which the image size is 1.")
    print("The final equation for the image size for this set H is |f''[H]^2| = 1.")
    print("Since kappa is an infinite cardinal, kappa is not equal to 1.")
    print("So, for any function f, we can always find a set H that fails to satisfy the required condition.")

    print("\n--- Step 7: Final Conclusion ---")
    print("It is impossible for a function to satisfy the condition for all required sets, because for any given function, a counterexample is guaranteed to exist.")
    print("Therefore, such a function can never exist, regardless of the choice of the infinite cardinal kappa.")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice A.")
