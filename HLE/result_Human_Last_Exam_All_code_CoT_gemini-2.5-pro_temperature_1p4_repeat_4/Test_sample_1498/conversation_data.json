    "Of course. I will provide a Python script to answer your question.\n\nThe poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam (The Creed of the Laymen)' is a famous 57-verse poem that summarizes the essential tenets of Islamic creed according to the Ash'ari school. It includes a section that lists the 25 prophets one must know by name.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Define the starting and ending verse numbers where the prophets' names are listed.\n2.  Print a clear and informative sentence that states this range.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of verses (bayts)\n    in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' where the prophets' names are mentioned.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The list of the 25 prophets starts at verse 32 and ends at verse 35.\n    start_bayt = 32\n    end_bayt = 35\n\n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the Prophets are mentioned in the following verses:\")\n    print(f\"From bayt number: {start_bayt}\")\n    print(f\"To bayt number: {end_bayt}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the result\nfind_prophets_verses()\n```\n<<<From bayt 32 to bayt 35>>>"
