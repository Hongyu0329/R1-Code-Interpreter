    # The integration over these variables is defined by the Berezin integration rules.
    # The integration acts like a derivative and picks out the coefficient of eta.
    # For a general function f(eta) = A + B*eta:
    # integral( (A + B*eta) d(eta) ) = B

    # This leads to two foundational rules:
    # 1. integral( 1 * d(eta) ) = 0
    # 2. integral( eta * d(eta) ) = 1

    # The second rule is crucial. It sets the normalization for the integration measure.
    # It assigns a value to the integral over a single, occupied fermionic state.
    # This value is the answer to the user's question.
