# This problem involves counting specific geometric objects (Maslov 2 holomorphic disks)
# for a Lagrangian submanifold in complex projective space.

# Step 1: Define the base case.
# The number of Maslov 2 disks for the Chekanov torus in CP^2 is a known result in symplectic geometry.
n_disks_in_cp2 = 6
print(f"The number of Maslov 2 disks for the Chekanov torus in CP^2 is: {n_disks_in_cp2}")

# Step 2: Understand the iterated lift procedure.
# The Lagrangian in CP^4 is obtained by applying the Biran lift twice.
# First lift: CP^2 -> CP^3
# Second lift: CP^3 -> CP^4

# Step 3: Apply the rule for how the number of disks changes with each lift.
# Each Biran lift from CP^n to CP^(n+1) adds exactly one new Maslov 2 disk.
# We represent this as an increment of 1.
increment_per_lift = 1

# Step 4: Calculate the number of disks after the first lift (to CP^3).
n_disks_in_cp3 = n_disks_in_cp2 + increment_per_lift
print(f"After the first lift, the number of disks in CP^3 is {n_disks_in_cp2} + {increment_per_lift} = {n_disks_in_cp3}")

# Step 5: Calculate the number of disks after the second lift (to CP^4).
n_disks_in_cp4 = n_disks_in_cp3 + increment_per_lift
print(f"After the second lift, the number of disks in CP^4 is {n_disks_in_cp3} + {increment_per_lift} = {n_disks_in_cp4}")

# Final Answer: The total number of disks is the result of this two-step calculation.
# The final equation demonstrates the entire process.
print("\nThe final equation showing the step-by-step calculation is:")
print(f"{n_disks_in_cp2} + {increment_per_lift} + {increment_per_lift} = {n_disks_in_cp4}")
