    "Of course. Here is a Python script to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Diagram:** The user describes a Feynman diagram with two vertices and four field contractions (propagators) between them. In a theory like $\\phi^4$, this corresponds to a second-order vacuum bubble diagram, sometimes called a \"sunset\" diagram.\n2.  **Recall the Symmetry Factor Rules:** The symmetry factor, often denoted by 'S', is a combinatorial number that corrects for overcounting identical topological diagrams in perturbative expansions. It is the order of the automorphism group of the graph. We can calculate it by considering the symmetries of the diagram:\n    *   **Permutation of identical vertices:** If there are `n` vertices that can be swapped without changing the diagram's structure, we get a factor of `n!`.\n    *   **Permutation of identical lines:** If there are `p` identical propagators connecting the same two vertices, we get a factor of `p!`.\n3.  **Apply Rules to the Diagram:**\n    *   The two vertices are identical and can be swapped. This gives a factor of `2!`.\n    *   The four propagators all connect these same two vertices and are therefore identical. They can be permuted among themselves in `4!` ways.\n4.  **Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor S is the product of these individual factors: `S = 2! * 4!`.\n5.  **Code the Solution:** Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the steps and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Description of the problem and method\nprint(\"This script calculates the symmetry factor (S) for a specific Feynman diagram.\")\nprint(\"The diagram features two vertices and four field contractions (propagators) connecting them.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe symmetry factor is calculated based on the diagram's automorphisms (self-symmetries):\")\nprint(\"1.
