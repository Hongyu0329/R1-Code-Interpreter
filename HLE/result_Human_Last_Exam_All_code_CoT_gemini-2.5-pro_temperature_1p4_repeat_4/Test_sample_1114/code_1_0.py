        "A physically meaningful function of particle positions must be independent of the coordinate system's origin. This requires using relative position vectors between pairs of particles (e.g., v = r_i - r_j).",

        "To form a single relative position vector, at least two particles are necessary. Therefore, N must be greater than 1.",

        "A pseudo-tensor acquires a negative sign under a reflection of coordinates. The fundamental rank-3 pseudo-tensor in 3D is the Levi-Civita symbol, ε.",
