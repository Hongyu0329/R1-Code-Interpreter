    # The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of the set of non-coastal points
    # in a hereditarily decomposable continuum.

    # Step 1: A key theorem states that for a hereditarily decomposable continuum,
    # the set of non-coastal points is identical to the set of terminal points.
    # So, we need to find the maximum number of terminal points.

    # Step 2: A second key theorem states that a hereditarily decomposable continuum
    # can have at most two terminal points.
    max_cardinality_upper_bound = 2

    # Step 3: We need to show that this maximum is achievable.
    # The standard example is an arc, like the interval [0, 1].
    # An arc is hereditarily decomposable.
    # Its endpoints, 0 and 1, are its only terminal points.
    # This example demonstrates that a cardinality of 2 is possible.
    example_cardinality = 2

    # Conclusion: Since the cardinality is at most 2, and we have an example
    # where the cardinality is exactly 2, the largest possible cardinality is 2.
