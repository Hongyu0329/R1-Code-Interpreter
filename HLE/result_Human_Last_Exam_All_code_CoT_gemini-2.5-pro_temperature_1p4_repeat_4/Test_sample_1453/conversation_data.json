    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence, we will analyze its repeating heptad pattern `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the core `a` and `d` positions are the primary determinants of whether the coiled-coil forms a dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Parse the Sequence**: I will treat the 32-residue sequence as four 7-residue blocks (heptads), with a short 4-residue tail.\n2.  **Identify the Heptad Register**: There are 7 possible ways to assign the `abcdefg` positions to a heptad. I will test all 7 possibilities. A correct register should place hydrophobic residues (like I, L, A, W) at the core `a` and `d` positions. I will score each register based on how well it achieves this.\n3.  **Break Ties**: It's possible that more than one register gives a perfect score for core hydrophobicity. In this case, I will use a tie-breaker by examining the solvent-exposed `e` and `g` positions. A register that places polar residues at these positions is generally more favorable.\n4.  **Predict Oligomeric State**: Once the most likely register is identified, I will analyze the specific amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions. Specific patterns of these core residues are strong predictors of the final oligomeric state, based on established principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing. For example:\n    *   **Trimer (3)**: Often has `Isoleucine (I)` at one core position and `Leucine (L)` at the other (`I` at `a` and `L` at `d`, or vice-versa).\n    *   **Tetramer (4)**: Often pairs a small residue like `Alanine (A)` with a bulky one like `Leucine (L)` (`A` at `a` and `L` at `d`, or vice-versa).\n5.  **Output the Result**: The code will print its analysis and the final predicted number.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = \"GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG\"\n    heptads = [\n        sequence[0:7],\n        sequence[7:14],\n        sequence[14:21],\n        sequence[21:28]\n    ]\n    \n    hydrophobic = {'I', 'L', 'V', 'A', 'M', 'F', 'W', 'Y'}\n    polar = {'S', 'T', 'N', 'Q', 'K', 'R', 'H', 'D', 'E'}\n    small = {'A', 'G', 'C', 'S', 'T'}\n    large = {'I', 'L', 'M', 'F', 'W', 'Y', 'V'}\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Analyzing Sequence ---\")\n    print(f\"Sequence: {sequence}\")\n    print(\"Dividing into four heptad blocks for analysis:\")\n    for i, h in enumerate(heptads):\n        print(f\"  H{i+1}: {h}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Finding The Best Heptad Register ---\")\n    print(\"Scoring all 7 possible registers based on placing hydrophobic residues at core 'a' and 'd' positions.\")\n    \n    best_registers = []\n    max_score = -1\n\n    for i in range(7):\n        a_pos = i\n        d_pos = (i + 3) % 7\n        \n        a_residues = [h[a_pos] for h in heptads]\n        d_residues = [h[d_pos] for h in heptads]\n        \n        score = sum(1 for r in a_residues if r in hydrophobic) + sum(1 for r in d_residues if r in hydrophobic)\n        \n        register_str = ['-'] * 7\n        register_str[a_pos] = 'a'\n        register_str[d_pos] = 'd'\n        \n        # print(f\"  Register ({''.join(register_str)}): a={a_residues}, d={d_residues}.
