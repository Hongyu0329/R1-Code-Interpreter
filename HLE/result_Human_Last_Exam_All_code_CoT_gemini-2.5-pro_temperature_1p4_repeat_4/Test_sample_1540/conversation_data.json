    "To solve this problem and determine the memory usage for a highly efficient C program, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Memory Efficiency Goal:** The core of the task is to find the memory usage `m` for the *most memory-efficient* C program. A naive approach would be to declare two character arrays, each of size 101 (for 100 characters plus a null terminator), to store both input strings. This would use `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the strings.\n2.  **Devise a More Efficient Strategy:** We can improve this significantly. Instead of storing both strings, we only need to store one. We can read the first string into a character array. Then, we can read the second string one character at a time and compare it on-the-fly with the corresponding character from the first string. This avoids allocating a second large array.\n3.  **Calculate Memory Usage (m):** For this efficient C approach, we would need the following variables:\n    *   A character array for the first string: `char s1[101];`. This requires **101 bytes**.\n    *   An index variable to iterate through the array. Since the string length is at most 100, an `unsigned char` is sufficient: `unsigned char i;`. This requires **1 byte**.\n    *   A variable to store the character being read from the second input stream. The standard `getchar()` function in C returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` (End Of File) value. So we need: `int ch;`. This requires **4 bytes** on a typical system.\n\n    The total memory `m` used for these variables is the sum of their sizes:\n    m = (memory for string 1) + (memory for index) + (memory for single char from string 2)\n    m = 101 + 1 + 4 = 106 bytes.\n\n4.  **Provide a Python Solution:** As requested, I will provide a working Python script that correctly solves the comparison problem. This script reads both strings, converts them to lowercase to handle the case-insensitivity rule, and then performs the lexicographical comparison.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads two strings, compares them lexicographically ignoring case,\n    and prints -1, 1, or 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the first string from standard input and convert to lowercase.\n    s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip().lower()\n\n    # Read the second string from standard input and convert to lowercase.\n    s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip().lower()\n\n    # Perform the comparison and print the result.\n    if s1 < s2:\n        print(\"-1\")\n    elif s1 > s2:\n        print(\"1\")\n    else:\n        print(\"0\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<106>>>"
