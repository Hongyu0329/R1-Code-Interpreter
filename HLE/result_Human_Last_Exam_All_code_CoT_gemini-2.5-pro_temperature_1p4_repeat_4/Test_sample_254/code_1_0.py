However, even if a network is transitive, the statistical results from direct and indirect data might still conflict (inconsistency), or there could be high variability between studies (heterogeneity). Thus, it's necessary but not sufficient.",
        'B': "Consistency: This is the statistical manifestation of transitivity, meaning direct and indirect evidence agree. While crucial, a network could be consistent by chance even if it's conceptually flawed (intransitive), or it might hide significant, unaddressed heterogeneity within comparisons. Thus, it's necessary but not sufficient.",
        'C': "Homogeneity: This assumes the true effect size is identical across all studies for a specific comparison. This is a very strong assumption and is often violated. Modern NMAs typically use random-effects models to account for heterogeneity, relaxing this assumption. Therefore, it is neither necessary (in most cases) nor sufficient.",
        'F': "Exchangeability: This is a modeling assumption used in random-effects models, stating that studies are drawn from a common distribution. It helps handle heterogeneity but does not guarantee the network is conceptually valid (transitivity) or that the evidence is consistent. Thus, it is not sufficient."
