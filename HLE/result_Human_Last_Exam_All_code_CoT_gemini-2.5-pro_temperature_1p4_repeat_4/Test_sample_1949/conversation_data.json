    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid:\n\n1.  **Identify Rivers:** I will first compile a list of real-world rivers that are mentioned by name in Virgil's Aeneid. This involves searching the text or using classical studies resources.\n2.  **Gather Data:** For each identified river, I will find its approximate modern length in kilometers.\n3.  **Process with Code:** I will write a Python script to perform the following steps:\n    *   Store the river names and their lengths in a dictionary.\n    *   Sort this data in descending order based on river length.\n    *   Select the top three entries from the sorted list.\n4.  **Display Results:** The script will then print the names and lengths of the three longest rivers.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest real-world rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in kilometers.\n    # Mythological rivers of the underworld are excluded.\n    rivers_in_aeneid = {\n        \"Nile\": 6650,\n        \"Danube (Ister)\": 2850,\n        \"Euphrates\": 2800,\n        \"Don (Tanais)\": 1870,\n        \"Tigris\": 1850,\n        \"Rhine (Rhenus)\": 1233,\n        \"Po (Eridanus)\": 652,\n        \"Hebrus\": 480,\n        \"Tiber\": 406,\n        \"Xanthus (Scamander)\": 110,\n    }\n\n    # Sort the dictionary items by length (the value) in descending order.\n    # The result is a list of (key, value) tuples.\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers_in_aeneid.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers from the sorted list.\n    top_three = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    # Print each of the top three rivers with their name and length.\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three, 1):\n        print(f\"{i}. {river}: approximately {length} km\")\n\nfind_longest_rivers_in_aeneid()\n```\n<<<Nile, Danube (Ister), Euphrates>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
