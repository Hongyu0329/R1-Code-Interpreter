    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):** We'll use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is at least a constant value related to Planck's constant. The minimal uncertainty is given by the equation:\n    `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `Δx` is the given uncertainty in position (10 pm).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Momentum (p) in the First Bohr Orbit:** According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum of an electron in an orbit is quantized. For the first orbit (n=1), the linear momentum `p` is given by:\n    `p = ħ / r₁`\n    where `r₁` is the radius of the first Bohr orbit (the Bohr radius, approximately 52.9 pm).\n\n3.  **Find the Ratio (Δp / p):** We will divide the expression for `Δp` by the expression for `p`. Notice that the reduced Planck constant `ħ` cancels out, simplifying the calculation:\n    `Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / r₁)`\n    `Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)`\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will plug in the values for the Bohr radius `r₁` and the position uncertainty `Δx` into the simplified formula to get the final numerical ratio.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given constants.\n# Uncertainty in position (Δx) in meters. 10 pm = 10 * 10^-12 m.\ndelta_x = 10e-12\n\n# Bohr radius (r₁) for the first orbit (n=1) in meters.\nr1 = 5.29177e-11\n\n# Step 2: The ratio (Δp / p) simplifies to r₁ / (2 * Δx).\n# Let's calculate this ratio.\nratio = r1 / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 3: Print the final equation with the numbers and the result.\nprint(\"To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum (Δp/p), we use the formula:\")\nprint(\"Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)\")\nprint(\"\\nWhere:\")\nprint(f\"r₁ (Bohr radius) = {r1:.5e} m\")\nprint(f\"Δx (Position Uncertainty) = {delta_x:.5e} m\")\nprint(\"\\nPlugging in the values, the final equation is:\")\n# The format below shows each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"Ratio = {r1:.5f} / (2 * {delta_x:.5f})\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal calculated ratio:\")\nprint(ratio)\n\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"
