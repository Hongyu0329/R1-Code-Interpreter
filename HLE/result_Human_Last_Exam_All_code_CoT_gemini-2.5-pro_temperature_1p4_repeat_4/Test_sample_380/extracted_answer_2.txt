No, the local magnetic field is not assumed to be perfectly radial. Its direction is described by the Parker Spiral model. However, using a radial-based coordinate system to calculate helicity is a common and justified approximation because the field is often quasi-radial, and this method preserves the sign of the helicity, which correctly identifies the wave's polarization (left or right-handed).
