    """
    Solves for the eigenvalues of the radial operator L_k for the given stability operator.

    The operator is discretized on a finite domain, and we solve the generalized 
    eigenvalue problem A f = lambda B f, where B is the weighting matrix.
    
    We consider even eigenfunctions, so we solve on [0, R] with a Neumann boundary
    condition at rho=0 and a Dirichlet boundary condition at rho=R.

    Args:
        n (int): The dimension parameter from the problem description.
        k (int): The angular momentum number for the spherical harmonics.
        N (int): Number of grid points for discretization.
        R (float): The size of the domain [0, R].

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The first 10 computed eigenvalues.
