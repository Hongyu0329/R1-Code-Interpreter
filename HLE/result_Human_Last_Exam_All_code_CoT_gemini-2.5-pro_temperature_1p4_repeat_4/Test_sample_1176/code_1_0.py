    This function analyzes ten statements about North American Cordilleran geology

    # Analysis of each statement:
    # (1) The Morrison formation represents a foredeep deposit. -> Consensus (C)
    # (2) Metamorphic core complexes formed in response to a slab window. -> Debated (D)
    # (3) An orogenic plateau ("Nevadaplano") existed in Nevada by the end of the Cretaceous. -> Debated (D)
    # (4) An orogenic plateau ("Arizonaplano") was constructed via magmatic thickening. -> Debated (D)
    # (5) Laramide-style structures are generally inboard of Sevier-style structures. -> Consensus (C)
    # (6) The Sierra Nevada and Idaho Batholiths were formed by the ancestral Cordilleran arc. -> Consensus (C)
    # (7) Ignimbrite eruptions began in Idaho/Montana in the Eocene and propagated southwest. -> Consensus (C)
    # (8) The Colorado Plateau reached modern elevations by the late Cretaceous. -> Debated (D)
    # (9) The Cascades arc reached modern elevation by the late Oligocene. -> Debated (D)
    # (10) Laramide deformation was caused by subduction of the Shatsky conjugate. -> Debated (D)
