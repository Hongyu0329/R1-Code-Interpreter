    "To find the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can use tools from algebraic topology, specifically the long exact sequence of a fibration, the Hurewicz theorem, and the Gysin sequence. The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Relate $\\pi_3(X)$ to another space's homotopy group.** We will construct an auxiliary space $Y$ that forms a fibration $S^1 \\to Y \\to X$. The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for this fibration will show that $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(Y)$.\n2.  **Relate homotopy to homology.** We will show that the space $Y$ is 2-connected, which allows us to use the Hurewicz theorem to establish that $\\pi_3(Y) \\cong H_3(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n3.  **Compute the homology group.** We will use the Gysin sequence for the fibration to compute $H_3(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$. This will relate $H_3(Y)$ to the homology groups of $X$ and the degree of the hypersurface.\n4.  **Determine the rank.** From the structure of the resulting group, we will determine its rank.\n\nThe following Python code will print out the steps of this derivation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_homotopy_group_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface\n    in CP^3 by explaining the mathematical steps involved.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the parameters of the problem\n    hypersurface_degree = 5\n    ambient_space_dim = 3 # CP^3\n    \n    print(\"### Step-by-step derivation for the rank of pi_3(X) ###\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Let X be a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\")\n    print(f\"This means X is defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree d = {hypersurface_degree}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Reduce the problem using a fibration ---\")\n    print(\"We consider the Hopf fibration p: S^7 -> CP^3.
