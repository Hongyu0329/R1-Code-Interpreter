    "This problem asks for the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols from the set `{T, F, !, &, |, (, )}`. This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved by breaking down the structure of valid boolean expressions.\n\n### Plan\nA well-formed formula (WFF) can be categorized by its outermost, lowest-precedence operator. Due to the specified precedence (`! > & > |`), we can partition all valid expressions into three disjoint groups:\n1.  Expressions where the lowest-precedence operator is `|`. These take the form `A | B`.\n2.  Expressions with no `|` operator, where the lowest-precedence operator is `&`. These take the form `A & B`.\n3.  Expressions containing no binary operators (`|`, `&`), built only from literals (`T`, `F`), the NOT operator (`!`), and parentheses (`()`).\n\nWe will count the number of true, 5-symbol expressions in each group and sum the results. This partitioning prevents any double-counting.\n\nTo do this, we'll first calculate the number of true and false sub-expressions of lengths 1, 2, and 3 for each category.\n\nLet `N(L) = (num_true, num_false)` be the counts for WFFs of length `L`.\n-   **Group 3 type (no `&` or `|`)**:\n    -   `N3(1)`: `T`, `F` -> (1, 1)\n    -   `N3(2)`: `!F`, `!T` -> (1, 1)\n    -   `N3(3)`: `!!T`,`(T)` (true); `!!F`,`(F)` (false) -> (2, 2)\n-   **Group 2+3 type (no `|`)**:\n    -   `N23(1)` and `N23(2)` are the same as `N3`.\n    -   `N23(3)` includes Group 3 expressions and expressions like `T&T`.\n        -   The form `A&B` of length 3 must have `A` and `B` of length 1. This gives `T&T` (true) and `T&F`, `F&T`, `F&F` (false), adding (1, 3) to the `N3(3)` counts.\n        -   `N23(3)` = (2+1, 2+3) = (3, 5).\n\nNow we can calculate the final counts for 5-symbol expressions.\n\n1.  **Count for Group 1 (`A | B` = True)**:\n    -   Total length is 5, so `len(A) + len(B) = 4`. `A` and `B` must not have `|` as a top-level operator. Their counts are given by `N23`.\n    -   We consider splits (1,3), (3,1), and (2,2) for `(len(A), len(B))`.\n    -   An expression `A|B` is true unless both `A` and `B` are false.\n2.  **Count for Group 2 (`A & B` = True)**:\n    -   Total length is 5, `len(A) + len(B) = 4`. `A` and `B` must not have `|` or `&` as top-level operators. Their counts are given by `N3`.\n    -   `A&B` is true only if both `A` and `B` are true.\n3.  **Count for Group 3 (only `!`, `()`, `T`, `F`)**:\n    -   We list all unique, 5-symbol WFFs made from these symbols and count how many evaluate to `True`. The forms are `!!!!L`, `(!!L)`, `!(!L)`, `!!(L)`, `((L))`. For each form, choosing `L=T` makes it true.\n\nThe following Python code implements this counting logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n    The method partitions expressions by their lowest-precedence operator\n    to avoid double counting.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # N3[L] stores a tuple (num_true, num_false) for expressions of length L\n    # containing only T, F, !, () symbols.\n    N3 = {}\n    N3[1] = (1, 1)  # T, F\n    N3[2] = (1, 1)  # !F, !T\n    # For length 3: !!L -> (1,1), (L) -> (1,1).
