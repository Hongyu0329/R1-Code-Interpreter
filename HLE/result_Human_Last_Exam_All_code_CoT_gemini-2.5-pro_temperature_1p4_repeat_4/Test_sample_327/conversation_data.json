    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pieces required for the canonical red-blue-Hackenbush game representation of the number $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  First, we represent the given fraction in binary. $\\frac{13}{16}$ is a dyadic rational, so it has a finite binary expansion. $13$ in binary is `1101`. Since the denominator is $16 = 2^4$, the binary expansion will have 4 digits after the decimal point. Thus, $\\frac{13}{16} = 0.1101_2$.\n2.  The binary expansion shows that the number is a sum of powers of two:\n    $\\frac{13}{16} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{16}$.\n3.  In Hackenbush, the game for a sum of numbers is the side-by-side sum of the games for each number. So, the game for $\\frac{13}{16}$ is the sum of the games for $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n    $G(\\frac{13}{16}) = G(\\frac{1}{2}) + G(\\frac{1}{4}) + G(\\frac{1}{16})$.\n4.  The number of pieces in a sum of games is the sum of the pieces in each individual game.\n5.  The canonical game for a value of $\\frac{1}{2^n}$ requires $2n$ pieces (either red or blue).\n    *   For $G(\\frac{1}{2}) = G(\\frac{1}{2^1})$, $n=1$, so it requires $2 \\times 1 = 2$ pieces.\n    *   For $G(\\frac{1}{4}) = G(\\frac{1}{2^2})$, $n=2$, so it requires $2 \\times 2 = 4$ pieces.\n    *   For $G(\\frac{1}{16}) = G(\\frac{1}{2^4})$, $n=4$, so it requires $2 \\times 4 = 8$ pieces.\n6.  The total number of pieces is the sum of the pieces for each component: $2 + 4 + 8$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces to represent a fraction in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n    \n    The method relies on the binary expansion of the fraction. The canonical game\n    for a fraction x is the sum of games for its binary components.
