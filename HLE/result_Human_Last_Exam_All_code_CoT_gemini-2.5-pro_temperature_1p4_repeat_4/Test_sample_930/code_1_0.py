def find_mutualists():
    """
    This function identifies mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis from a predefined list.

    A mutualist relationship with a flowering plant typically involves pollination.
    The organism receives a benefit (nectar) and the plant benefits in return (pollen transfer).

    Analysis of the list:
    - 1) Danaus plexipus (Adult Monarch): A known pollinator of milkweed. Mutualist.
    - 2) Megachile frigidus (Adult Leafcutter Bee): Bees are effective pollinators of milkweed. Mutualist.
    - 3) Formica rufa (Adult Ant): Typically a nectar robber, not an effective pollinator. Not a mutualist.
    - 4) Sphex ichneumoneus (Adult Digger Wasp): Large wasps are effective pollinators of milkweed. Mutualist.
    - 5) Pepsis thisbe (Adult Tarantula Hawk Wasp): Large wasps are effective pollinators of milkweed. Mutualist.
    - 6) Megachile ericetorum (Adult Leafcutter Bee): Bees are effective pollinators of milkweed. Mutualist.
    - 7) Danaus plexipus (Larva): A herbivore that eats the plant's leaves. This is antagonism, not mutualism.
    - 8-12) All other Larvae: These larvae (bee, ant, wasp) do not interact directly with the plant. They develop in nests or on hosts. Not mutualists.
