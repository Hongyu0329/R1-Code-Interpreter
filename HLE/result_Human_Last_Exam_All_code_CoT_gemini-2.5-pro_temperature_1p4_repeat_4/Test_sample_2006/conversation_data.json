    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Title**: The title, \"The Bays,\" is a pun. It should be read as \"The B's,\" indicating that the answers to the clues in the haiku are words that start with the letter 'B'.\n2.  **Decode the Haiku**: I will interpret each line of the haiku to find a number and its corresponding 'B' word.\n    *   \"An August tempest\": August is the 8th month. A tempest's strength is measured on the **Beaufort** scale. So, the number is 8.\n    *   \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\": Twice fifteen is 30. A common 30-year financial instrument that brings significant change upon maturity is a **Bond**. So, the number is 30.\n    *   \"A divine one yields\": This refers to a single, divine entity. The **Bible** is often referred to as the one, divine book that yields wisdom. So, the number is 1.\n3.  **Sort the Answers**: The prompt asks for the answer in alphabetical order. I will sort the three 'B' words I found: Beaufort, Bible, Bonds.\n4.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script to present this solution, showing how each number and word is derived from the haiku, and then print the final sorted list as the answer. The script will also fulfill the requirement of showing the number in a final \"equation-like\" format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_haiku_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle presented in the haiku \"The Bays\".\n    It decodes each line, finds the corresponding 'B' word, and sorts them alphabetically.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the clues and their interpretations.\n    # Each dictionary key is the answer word, and the value contains the\n    # original line, the derived number, and the reasoning.\n    clues = {\n        \"Beaufort\": {\n            \"line\": \"An August tempest\",\n            \"number\": 8,\n            \"reason\": \"August is the 8th month.
