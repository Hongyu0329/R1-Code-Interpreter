    "My plan is to first research the specific self-portrait painted by Curt Querner in 1933 after his encounter with the Gestapo. I will identify the object he is holding and its symbolic meaning in the context of resistance against the Nazi regime.\n\nFinally, as per your instructions, I will present this information within a Python script. The script will simply define the answer and print it out in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \n    In 1933, after being arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo, Curt Querner painted\n    his \"Self-Portrait with Poppy Capsule\" (Selbstbildnis mit Mohnkapsel). In the painting,\n    he holds a large, dried poppy capsule. While literally a plant, the way he grips\n    it transforms it into a cudgel or club (in German, a 'Kn√ºppel').\n    \n    This object is widely interpreted as a symbol of his proletarian defiance and\n    readiness to fight back against his oppressors.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The object is a poppy capsule, but it is held to look like a weapon.\n    symbolic_object = \"a cudgel or club\"\n    literal_object = \"a large poppy capsule\"\n\n    print(f\"In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds what appears to be {literal_object}.\")\n    print(f\"However, he grips it like a weapon, and it is symbolically interpreted as {symbolic_object} of resistance.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a cudgel or club>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
