    This function provides information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.
    
    In 1933, after being arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo, Curt Querner painted
    his "Self-Portrait with Poppy Capsule" (Selbstbildnis mit Mohnkapsel). In the painting,
    he holds a large, dried poppy capsule. While literally a plant, the way he grips
    it transforms it into a cudgel or club (in German, a 'Kn√ºppel').
    
    This object is widely interpreted as a symbol of his proletarian defiance and
    readiness to fight back against his oppressors.
