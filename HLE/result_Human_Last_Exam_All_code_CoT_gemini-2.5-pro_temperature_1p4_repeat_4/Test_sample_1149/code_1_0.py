# Based on the scientific paper "A new specimen of the enigmatic theropod Irritator challengeri
# (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil" by Sues, H.-D., Frey, E.,
# Martill, D. M., & Scott, D. M. (2002).
# The lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri contains two prominent depressions
# (pneumatic foramina).

# We can represent this finding with a simple addition.
num1 = 1
num2 = 1

# Calculate the total number of depressions
total_depressions = num1 + num2
