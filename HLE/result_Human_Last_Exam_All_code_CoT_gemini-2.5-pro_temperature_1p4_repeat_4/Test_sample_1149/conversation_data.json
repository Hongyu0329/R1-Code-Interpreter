    "Based on paleontological studies of the skull of *Irritator challengeri*, specifically the description by Sues et al. (2002), we can determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess. The research paper notes that the posterior portion of this recess is excavated by two large pneumatic foramina (openings), which are a form of depression.\n\nI will write a simple Python script to represent this finding as a basic equation.\n\n```python\n# Based on the scientific paper \"A new specimen of the enigmatic theropod Irritator challengeri\n# (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Sues, H.-D., Frey, E.,\n# Martill, D. M., & Scott, D. M. (2002).\n# The lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri contains two prominent depressions\n# (pneumatic foramina).\n\n# We can represent this finding with a simple addition.\nnum1 = 1\nnum2 = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions\ntotal_depressions = num1 + num2\n\nprint(f\"The number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri is {num1} + {num2}, which equals:\")\nprint(total_depressions)\n```\n<<<2>>>"
