# Based on the mathematical analysis of the Rado numbers for the given equations.

# Part (a): Is Rad_2(S-1) = 1?
# Yes. The equation is sum(a_i*x_i) - x_m = S-1.
# A solution with all x_i = 1 gives S-1=S-1.
# For N=1, the set {1} is always monochromatic, so a solution is guaranteed. Rad=1.
ans_a = "Yes"

# Part (b): Can Rad_2(2S-2) = 2?
# Yes. The equation is sum(a_i*x_i) - x_m = 2S-2.
# A solution with all x_i = 2 gives 2S-2=2S-2.
# For N>=2, the number 2 has a color, making (2,2,...,2) a monochromatic solution. So Rad<=2.
# For N=1, a solution exists only if S=1. For S>1, Rad>1.
# Thus, for any 2-distributable set with S>1 (e.g. {1,1}), Rad=2.
ans_b_yes_no = "yes"
ans_b_expr = "2"

# Part (c): Value of Rad_2(2S-1) for even S?
# The value is S+1. This is derived by showing that for any 2-coloring of [1,S+1] a
# monochromatic solution can be constructed, while a specific 2-coloring of [1,S] exists
# that avoids any monochromatic solution. For S=2, the value is 3.
ans_c_expr = "S+1"

# Printing the final answer in the required format.
print(f"(a) {ans_a}; (b) {ans_b_yes_no} [{ans_b_expr}]; (c) {ans_c_expr}")

# As per the instruction to output numbers from the "final equation",
# here are the numeric constants from the expressions in the answer above.
