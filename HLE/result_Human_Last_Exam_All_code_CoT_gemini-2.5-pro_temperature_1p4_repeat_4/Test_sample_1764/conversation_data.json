    "Answering this question requires a careful interpretation of what \"number of isometric embeddings\" means. A literal interpretation leads to an infinite number, so we will adopt a standard convention to arrive at a sensible, finite answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Initial Analysis**: A literal interpretation of the question implies an infinite number of embeddings. If $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding, then for any vector $c \\in B$, the translated map $g(x) = f(x) + c$ is also an isometric embedding. Since a non-trivial Banach space $B$ has infinitely many points (if the underlying field is $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$), there are infinitely many such embeddings.\n2.  **Standard Interpretation**: To get a finite answer, we must quotient out this translational freedom. The standard way to do this is to count \"rooted\" embeddings, where we require a specific point $x_0 \\in X$ to be mapped to the origin $0 \\in B$. So, we will count the number of isometric embeddings $f$ such that $f(x_0) = 0$.\n3.  **Establishing a Lower Bound**: With this interpretation, we can show that the number of rooted embeddings is at least 2 for any non-trivial space. If $f$ is a rooted embedding, then the map $-f$ (defined as $(-f)(x) = -f(x)$) is also a rooted embedding. It preserves distances and maps $x_0$ to 0. For any space $X$ with more than one point, $f$ and $-f$ are distinct. Thus, there are at least 2 rooted embeddings.\n4.  **Finding the Minimum**: The question asks for the *smallest possible* number. This means we are free to choose the finite ultrametric space $X$ and the Banach space $B$ to minimize this number. Since we know the number is at least 2, if we can find any valid pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of rooted embeddings is exactly 2, then the minimum must be 2.\n5.  **Concrete Example**: We'll choose the simplest non-trivial ultrametric space: a two-point space $X = \\{x_0, x_1\\}$ with distance $d(x_0, x_1) = D > 0$. For the Banach space, we'll choose the simplest one: $B = \\mathbb{R}$ with the standard absolute value norm. We will then count the number of rooted embeddings of this $X$ into this $B$.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: A Python script will be used to formalize the counting for the chosen example. It will solve for the possible image of $x_1$ given that $f(x_0)=0$ and demonstrate that there are exactly two solutions.\n\nThis plan leads to a determinate, minimal number.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_smallest_number_of_embeddings():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function implements the plan to find the smallest possible number\n    of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.\n    \n    The reasoning is as follows:\n    1. The phrase 'number of isometric embeddings' is interpreted as the number of 'rooted'\n       embeddings, where a chosen point x0 in X is mapped to the origin in B. This\n       removes the infinite possibilities generated by translation.\n    \n    2. With this interpretation, for any rooted embedding f, the map -f is also a distinct\n       rooted embedding. This means for any non-trivial space, there are at least 2 such embeddings.\n    \n    3. To find the smallest possible number, we search for a specific pair (X, B) that achieves\n       the minimum. We choose the simplest case:\n       - X: A two-point space {x0, x1} with distance d(x0, x1) = D.\n       - B: The real numbers R with the standard absolute value norm.\n    \n    4. An embedding f must satisfy ||f(x1) - f(x0)|| = d(x1, x0).\n       For a rooted embedding at x0, f(x0) = 0.\n       Let y1 = f(x1). The condition becomes ||y1 - 0|| = D, which in R is |y1| = D.\n       We solve this equation to find the number of possible values for y1, which corresponds\n       to the number of possible embeddings.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let the distance D be a positive constant. We can set it to 1 without loss of generality.\n    D = 1\n    \n    # We need to find the number of solutions for |y1| = D in R.\n    y1 = sympy.Symbol('y1')\n    equation = sympy.Abs(y1) - D\n    \n    # Solve the equation for y1\n    solutions = sympy.solve(equation, y1)\n    \n    num_solutions = len(solutions)\n    \n    print(\"Based on the interpretation of counting rooted embeddings (f(x0) = 0):\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Establish a lower bound.\")\n    print(\"For any rooted embedding f, -f is also a distinct rooted embedding.\")\n    print(\"This means the number of rooted embeddings is always at least 2.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Find a case where the number of embeddings is exactly 2.\")\n    print(\"Let X be a 2-point space {x0, x1} with distance d(x0, x1) = 1.\")\n    print(\"Let B be the Banach space of real numbers R.\")\n    print(\"An embedding f rooted at x0 must map f(x0) to 0.\")\n    print(\"The image of x1, let's call it y, must satisfy the equation |y| = 1.\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe equation to solve is: |y| = {D}\")\n    print(f\"The solutions for y are: {solutions}\")\n    print(f\"There are {num_solutions} possible values for the image of x1.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nEach solution corresponds to a unique rooted embedding:\")\n    print(f\"Embedding 1: f(x0) = 0, f(x1) = {solutions[0]}\")\n    print(f\"Embedding 2: f(x0) = 0, f(x1) = {solutions[1]}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"Since the number of rooted embeddings is always at least 2, and we have found a\")\n    print(\"case where it is exactly 2, the smallest possible number is 2.\")\n    \n    # Fulfilling the requirement to output numbers from the final equation\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation Details:\")\n    print(f\"Equation: |y| - {D} = 0\")\n    print(f\"Number of solutions: {num_solutions}\")\n    print(f\"Solution 1: {solutions[0]}\")\n    print(f\"Solution 2: {solutions[1]}\")\n\n\nfind_smallest_number_of_embeddings()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
