def find_smallest_number_of_embeddings():
    """
    This function implements the plan to find the smallest possible number
    of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The phrase 'number of isometric embeddings' is interpreted as the number of 'rooted'
       embeddings, where a chosen point x0 in X is mapped to the origin in B. This
       removes the infinite possibilities generated by translation.
    
    2. With this interpretation, for any rooted embedding f, the map -f is also a distinct
       rooted embedding. This means for any non-trivial space, there are at least 2 such embeddings.
    
    3. To find the smallest possible number, we search for a specific pair (X, B) that achieves
       the minimum. We choose the simplest case:
       - X: A two-point space {x0, x1} with distance d(x0, x1) = D.
       - B: The real numbers R with the standard absolute value norm.
    
    4. An embedding f must satisfy ||f(x1) - f(x0)|| = d(x1, x0).
       For a rooted embedding at x0, f(x0) = 0.
       Let y1 = f(x1). The condition becomes ||y1 - 0|| = D, which in R is |y1| = D.
       We solve this equation to find the number of possible values for y1, which corresponds
       to the number of possible embeddings.
    """
    
    # Let the distance D be a positive constant. We can set it to 1 without loss of generality.
    D = 1
    
    # We need to find the number of solutions for |y1| = D in R.
    y1 = sympy.Symbol('y1')
    equation = sympy.Abs(y1) - D
    
    # Solve the equation for y1
    solutions = sympy.solve(equation, y1)

    print("This means the number of rooted embeddings is always at least 2.\n")

    print("\nConclusion:")
