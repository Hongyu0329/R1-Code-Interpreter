    "I will write a Python script to answer your question.\n\nThe plan is to:\n1.  Identify the core question about the cited lectures in Einstein's 1905 paper.\n2.  Research the historical facts. A key nuance is that while the specific paper on Brownian motion had no citations, his closely related PhD thesis from the same year did.\n3.  Store the name of the physicist and the title of the lectures in variables.\n4.  Construct a clear, contextual sentence explaining the answer.\n5.  Print the final answer to the console.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lectures():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information on the lectures cited in Albert Einstein's 1905 work.\n    \"\"\"\n    # While Einstein's famous 1905 paper on Brownian motion itself contained no citations,\n    # his closely related PhD thesis, submitted in the same year, did.
