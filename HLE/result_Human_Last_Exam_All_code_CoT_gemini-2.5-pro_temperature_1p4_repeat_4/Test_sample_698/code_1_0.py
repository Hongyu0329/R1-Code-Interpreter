# Description:
# This script solves the "True Avalanche" word puzzle.
# A True Avalanche is a pun that repeats syllables. The task is to create one
# using the word "computer" that fits the description:
# "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."
#
# Analysis:
# The solution lies in finding a phrase that sounds like "computer" (com-pu-ter)
# and matches the description.
#
# The phrase "Come poo, tern!" is the correct answer because:
# 1. Phonetic Match: "Come poo, tern!" sounds nearly identical to "com-pu-ter".
# 2. Contextual Match: A "tern" is a type of bird, and "Come poo" is a command
#    for the bird to relieve itself, which directly reflects the software's function.
#
# This makes it the only choice that cleverly satisfies all parts of the puzzle.

print("\nThis works perfectly because a 'tern' is a bird, and the phrase is a command for it to 'poo'.")
