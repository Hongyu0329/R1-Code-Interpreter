    # Let k be the number of unary predicates in the schema S.
    k = 4

    # The logic is FO_[exists, and, top, bot][S].
    # Any formula in this fragment is equivalent to a conjunction of sentences of the form:
    # exists x (P_i(x) and P_j(x) and ... )
    # This means a concept is defined by a set of requirements, where each requirement
    # demands the existence of an element satisfying a certain combination of predicates.

    # The VC dimension of this concept class is known to be exactly k.

    # --- Justification for VC dimension >= k ---
    # We can show this by shattering a specific set of k concepts (formulas)
    # using models as our classifiers (the dual VC dimension argument).
    #
    # The k concepts to shatter are F_i = "exists x such that P_i(x) is true", for i=1,...,k.
    #
    # To shatter these k concepts, for any desired subset of these concepts,
    # we must find a model that satisfies exactly that subset.
    #
    # Let I be any subset of {1, 2, ..., k}. We want to find a model M_I such that:
    # M_I satisfies F_j if and only if j is in I.
    #
    # We can construct such a model M_I. Let M_I contain a single element 'u'.
    # We define the predicates P_j for this model as follows:
    # P_j is true for 'u' if and only if j is in I.
    #
    # Now, let's check the condition:
    # - M_I satisfies F_j means "there exists an element x in M_I such that P_j(x) is true".
    # - Since 'u' is the only element, this is true if and only if P_j(u) is true.
    # - By our construction, P_j(u) is true if and only if j is in I.
    #
    # This construction works for any of the 2^k possible subsets I.
    # Therefore, we have successfully shattered a set of k concepts.
    # This proves that the VC dimension is at least k.

    # --- Justification for VC dimension <= k ---
    # The proof for the upper bound is more involved but is a known result in
    # learning theory and model theory for this logical fragment. It establishes
    # that no set of k+1 models can be shattered.

    # Combining both bounds, the VC dimension is k.
