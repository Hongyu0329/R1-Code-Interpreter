    # Statement 1 Analysis
    print("\n--- Statement 1: There is no selection occurring on the phenotype measured. ---")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("The problem description explicitly states two key things:")
    print("  a) The phenotype has 'no bearing on fitness'.")
    print("  b) 'All genotypes have equal fitness'.")
    print("These phrases are the definition of an absence of natural selection acting on the trait.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 1 must be TRUE.")

    # Statement 2 Analysis
    print("\n--- Statement 2: Parents will not raise their offspring. ---")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("The problem states that generations are 'discrete and non-overlapping'.")
    print("This is a modeling assumption meaning that the parental generation dies before the offspring generation matures and reproduces.")
    print("However, this assumption about life cycles does not logically forbid all forms of parental care. For instance, parents could build a nest or feed their young for a period before they die.")
    print("Therefore, this statement is not a necessary consequence of the given information.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 2 is NOT necessarily true.")

    # Statement 3 Analysis
    print("\n--- Statement 3: The population will never speciate even in future generations. ---")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("Speciation, the formation of new species, is an evolutionary process that requires changes in allele frequencies to create reproductive isolation.")
    print("The fundamental forces of evolution are mutation, selection, genetic drift, and gene flow.")
    print("The problem explicitly states all these forces are absent:")
    print("  - No mutations")
    print("  - No selective advantage (no selection)")
    print("  - Infinitely large population (no genetic drift)")
    print("  - No movement in or out (no gene flow)")
    print("A population that is not evolving cannot speciate. The phrase 'even in future generations' implies these conditions persist.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 3 must be TRUE.")

    # Statement 4 Analysis
    print("\n--- Statement 4: The researcher will not find a substantial difference in the phenotype measured between the west and east groups of individuals. ---")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("The problem describes a single population in which individuals 'mate randomly'. This means an individual from the west is equally likely to mate with an individual from the east as one from the west.")
    print("This process, called panmixia, ensures that allele frequencies are uniform throughout the entire region. There is no mechanism to create or maintain genetic differences between the two halves.")
    print("Furthermore, the researcher measures everyone (an infinite sample size), eliminating any possibility of finding a difference due to random sampling error.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 4 must be TRUE.")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Summary:")
    print("The statements that must always be true are 1, 3, and 4.")
    print("Looking at the answer choices, this corresponds to choice L.")
