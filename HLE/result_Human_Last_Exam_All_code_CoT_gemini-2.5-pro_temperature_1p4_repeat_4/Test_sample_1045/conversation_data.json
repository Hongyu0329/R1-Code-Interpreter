    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene molecule (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The 1s orbital is described by two basis functions (a split-valence representation: one function is a contraction of 3 primitives, and the other is a single primitive). So, each H atom has 2 contracted functions.\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n        *   The core 1s orbital is described by one basis function (a contraction of 6 primitives).\n        *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are split. The inner part (2s', 2p') is described by one s-function and one set of p-functions (px, py, pz), for a total of 1 + 3 = 4 functions. The outer part (2s'', 2p'') is also described by one s-function and one set of p-functions, for another 4 functions.\n        *   In total, each C atom has 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Multiply the number of each type of atom by its corresponding number of basis functions and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon: 1 (core 1s) + 4 (inner valence 2s, 2p) + 4 (outer valence 2s, 2p) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen: 1 (inner valence 1s) + 1 (outer valence 1s) = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from each element\ntotal_carbon_functions = num_carbon * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_hydrogen_functions = num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the grand total for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_carbon_functions + total_hydrogen_functions\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final equation\nprint(f\"Molecule: Toluene (C{num_carbon}H{num_hydrogen})\")\nprint(\"Basis Set: 6-31G\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Functions per Carbon atom: {functions_per_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Hydrogen atom: {functions_per_hydrogen}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"Total number of contracted Gaussian functions:\")\n# The final part of the code prints the equation as requested\nprint(f\"({num_carbon} C atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/C) + ({num_hydrogen} H atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/H) = {total_carbon_functions} + {total_hydrogen_functions} = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
