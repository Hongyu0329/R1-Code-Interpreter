    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding the particle within a specific interval in a 1D box. This is a classic quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Wavefunction:** The state of the particle is described by its wavefunction, Ψₙ(x). For a 1D box of length 'a', the normalized wavefunction is Ψₙ(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a).\n2.  **Find the Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a position 'x' is given by the square of the wavefunction's magnitude, |Ψₙ(x)|². This gives us the probability density function: P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a).\n3.  **Integrate over the Interval:** To find the probability of the particle being in an interval from x₁ to x₂, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval. The equation for the probability is:\n    P = ∫ [from x₁ to x₂] (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) dx.\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:** We are given n=2, x₁=0.495a, and x₂=0.505a. We will use a Python script to perform this numerical integration accurately. For the calculation, we can set the box length `a=1`, as it will cancel out.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# --- Problem Parameters ---\n# Quantum number\nn = 2\n# Length of the box (we can set a=1 as it cancels out)\na = 1.0\n# Interval limits\nx1 = 0.495 * a\nx2 = 0.505 * a\n\n# The probability density function is |Ψ(x)|², where Ψ(x) is the wavefunction.\n# For a particle in a 1D box: |Ψ(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a)\ndef probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the probability density for a particle in a 1D box.\"\"\"\n    return (2.0 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n# Calculate the probability by integrating the density function over the interval [x1, x2].\n# The quad function from the scipy library performs numerical integration.\n# It returns the result of the integral and an estimate of the error.\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# --- Output the results ---\n# As requested, we will print the final equation with all numbers included.\nprint(\"To find the probability, we integrate the probability density function P(x) = |Ψ(x)|².\")\nprint(\"The equation for the probability is:\")\n# The formatting below shows the integral with the specific values for this problem.\nprint(f\"P = ∫[from {x1:.3f}a to {x2:.3f}a] (2/a) * sin²({n}πx/a) dx\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating this integral gives the probability.\")\nprint(f\"The probability is: {probability}\")\n```\n<<<6.579708518934149e-06>>>"
