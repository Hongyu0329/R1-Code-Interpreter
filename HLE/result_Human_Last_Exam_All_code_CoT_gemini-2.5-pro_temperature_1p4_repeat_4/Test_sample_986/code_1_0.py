    # 1. D is the set of real numbers with the natural order, (ℝ, ≤).
    # 2. P is the nerve of D. Its 1-skeleton is the complete graph on ℝ.
    # 3. G is the directed graph where an edge (a, b) exists if a < b.
    # 4. X is the line graph of G.
    #    - Vertices of X are edges of G: V(X) = {(a, b) | a, b ∈ ℝ, a < b}.
    #    - An edge exists in X from u=(a,b) to v=(c,d) if b = c.

    # A clique in X is a set of vertices where any two are connected. For two distinct
    # vertices u=(a,b) and v=(c,d), a connection means either b=c or d=a.
