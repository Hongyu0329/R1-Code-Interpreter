    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 method, we need to analyze the stability region of the scheme.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the BDF4 method and its stability function.** The BDF4 method is a four-step linear multistep method. Its stability is determined by applying it to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$. This leads to a stability function, $\\hat{h}(\\zeta)$, where $\\hat{h} = h\\lambda$ and $\\zeta$ is a complex number on the unit circle, $\\zeta = e^{i\\theta}$.\n2.  **Formulate the A($\\alpha$)-stability condition.** A method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the cone $W_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha\\}$. The angle $\\alpha$ is the largest such angle, which is determined by the ray from the origin that is tangent to the boundary of the stability region.\n3.  **Find the tangent points.** The argument of $\\hat{h}(\\zeta)$ is extremal at the tangent points. This leads to the condition $\\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{\\zeta \\hat{h}'(\\zeta)}{\\hat{h}(\\zeta)}\\right) = 0$. We will set up this equation.\n4.  **Solve for the critical points.** The resulting equation is a polynomial in $\\zeta$. We can solve this using a symbolic computation library like `sympy` in Python to find the exact roots $\\zeta_0$.\n5.  **Calculate the angle $\\alpha$.** For each root $\\zeta_0$ on the unit circle, we compute the corresponding point on the stability boundary, $\\hat{h}_0 = \\hat{h}(\\zeta_0)$. The angle $\\alpha$ is then given by $\\alpha = |\\arg(-\\hat{h}_0)|$. Since the stability function has real coefficients, the region is symmetric and we only need to find one extremum. The exact value can be expressed as $\\arctan(T)$, where $T = |\\text{Im}(-\\hat{h}_0) / \\text{Re}(-\\hat{h}_0)|$.\n\nLet's execute this plan.\n\nThe BDF4 scheme is given by:\n$$ \\frac{25}{12}y_{n+4} - 4y_{n+3} + 3y_{n+2} - \\frac{4}{3}y_{n+1} + \\frac{1}{4}y_n = h f_{n+4} $$\nApplying this to $y'=\\lambda y$, we get the characteristic polynomials:\n$\\rho(\\zeta) = \\frac{25}{12}\\zeta^4 - 4\\zeta^3 + 3\\zeta^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\zeta + \\frac{1}{4}$\n$\\sigma(\\zeta) = \\zeta^4$\n\nThe stability function is $\\hat{h}(\\zeta) = \\frac{\\rho(\\zeta)}{\\sigma(\\zeta)} = \\frac{25}{12} - 4\\zeta^{-1} + 3\\zeta^{-2} - \\frac{4}{3}\\zeta^{-3} + \\frac{1}{4}\\zeta^{-4}$.\n\nThe condition for the tangent point is $\\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{\\zeta \\hat{h}'(\\zeta)}{\\hat{h}(\\zeta)}\\right) = 0$.
