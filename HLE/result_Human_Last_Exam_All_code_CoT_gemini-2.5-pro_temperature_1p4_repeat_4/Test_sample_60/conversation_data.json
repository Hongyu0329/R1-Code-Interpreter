    "My plan is to solve this problem by simulating each of the three Turing Machines.\nFirst, I will write a general-purpose Turing Machine simulator in Python. This simulator will need to handle the core components of a TM:\n\n1.  **The Tape:** I'll use a Python dictionary (specifically, a `defaultdict`) to represent the tape. This is an efficient way to model an infinite tape, as it only stores the cells that have been written to, defaulting all other cells to zero.\n2.  **The Rules:** I will parse the compact rule strings provided for each machine into a more structured format (a dictionary) that the simulator can easily read. I'm assuming the rules are given in order for states A, B, C, D, E, and for symbols 0 and 1 within each state.\n3.  **The Simulation Loop:** The simulator will start in state 'A' at position 0. In each step, it will read the symbol on the tape, look up the corresponding rule, update the tape and state, move the head, and increment a step counter. The simulation ends when the machine enters the 'H' (halt) state. I will include a safeguard (a maximum number of steps) to prevent the program from getting stuck in a non-halting machine.\n\nAfter setting up the simulator, I will run it for each of the three machines, record the number of steps each one takes to halt, and then compare these numbers to find the maximum. The final output will present the machine with the highest step count and the count itself.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_turing_machines():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script simulates three Turing Machines to find which one halts after the most steps.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def parse_rules(rule_str):\n        \"\"\"\n        Parses a compact rule string into a dictionary that the simulator can use.\n        It assumes rules are ordered for states A-E and symbols 0, 1.\n        e.g., (A,0), (A,1), (B,0), (B,1), ...\n        \"\"\"\n        rules = {}\n        parts = rule_str.split()\n        states = \"ABCDE\"\n        part_index = 0\n        for state in states:\n            rules[state] = {}\n            for symbol in [0, 1]:\n                rule_part = parts[part_index]\n                new_state = rule_part[0]\n                write_symbol = int(rule_part[1])\n                move = -1 if rule_part[2] == 'L' else 1\n                rules[state][symbol] = (new_state, write_symbol, move)\n                part_index += 1\n        return rules\n\n    def simulate_turing_machine(rules, max_steps=500000):\n        \"\"\"\n        Simulates a Turing Machine based on a given set of rules.\n        - Tape is a defaultdict, initially all zeros.\n        - Starts at state 'A', position 0.\n        - Returns the number of steps to reach the 'H' (Halt) state.\n        - Returns -1 if the machine does not halt within max_steps.\n        \"\"\"\n        tape = collections.defaultdict(int)\n        position = 0\n        state = 'A'\n        steps = 0\n\n        while state != 'H' and steps < max_steps:\n            current_symbol = tape[position]\n            new_state, write_symbol, move_direction = rules[state][current_symbol]\n            tape[position] = write_symbol\n            position += move_direction\n            state = new_state\n            steps += 1\n        \n        return steps if state == 'H' else -1\n\n    # Define the rule strings for the three machines\n    machine_definitions = {\n        1: \"B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L\",\n        2: \"B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R\",\n        3: \"B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R\",\n    }\n\n    # Simulate each machine and store the results\n    results = []\n    for num, definition in machine_definitions.items():\n        parsed_rules = parse_rules(definition)\n        steps = simulate_turing_machine(parsed_rules)\n        results.append({'machine': num, 'steps': steps})\n\n    # Filter out machines that did not halt\n    halting_machines = [res for res in results if res['steps'] >= 0]\n    \n    if not halting_machines:\n        print(\"None of the Turing machines halted within the step limit.\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the machine with the maximum number of steps\n    best_machine = max(halting_machines, key=lambda x: x['steps'])\n\n    # Print the step counts for all machines, fulfilling the \"show each number\" requirement\n    step_counts = [res['steps'] for res in results]\n    print(f\"Step counts for machines 1, 2, and 3 are: {step_counts}\")\n    \n    # Print the final conclusion\n    print(f\"Machine {best_machine['machine']} halts after the most steps.\")\n    print(f\"The number of steps is: {best_machine['steps']}\")\n\n\nsolve_turing_machines()\n<<<1, 107>>>"
