    This function calculates the dimension of the ninth cohomology group H^9(M, Q).
    The space M is the complement of an arrangement of hyperplanes in H^4.
    This arrangement corresponds to a quaternionic reflection group.
    The Poincaré polynomial of the complement M is given by P(t) = product_{i=1 to 4} (1 + m_i * t^3),
    where m_i are the exponents of the group.
    The degrees of the basic invariants for this group are d = [8, 12, 20, 24].
