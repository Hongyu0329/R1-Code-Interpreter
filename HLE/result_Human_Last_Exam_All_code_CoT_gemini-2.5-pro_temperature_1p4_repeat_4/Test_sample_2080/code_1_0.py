# Plan:
# 1. The second osmotic virial coefficient from steric-only behavior (B_2,steric),
#    in units of mL/g, can be estimated using the hard-sphere model.
# 2. This model relates B_2,steric to the partial specific volume (v_sp) of the protein
#    by the simple equation: B_2,steric = 4 * v_sp.
# 3. We will use a typical partial specific volume for a monoclonal antibody,
#    which is approximately 0.73 mL/g.
# 4. The experimental value and solution conditions are not needed for this calculation
#    as they relate to electrostatic interactions, not steric ones.

# --- Parameters ---

# Define the typical partial specific volume for a monoclonal antibody in mL/g
partial_specific_volume = 0.73  # unit: mL/g

# The factor from the hard-sphere model
factor = 4

# --- Calculation ---

# Calculate the second osmotic virial coefficient from steric-only behavior
b2_steric = factor * partial_specific_volume

# --- Output ---
