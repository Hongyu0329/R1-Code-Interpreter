    # However, the offspring's diet contains only cholestanol, which cannot be used to make the
    # molting hormone Ecdysone. Once the maternal supply is depleted, the larvae cannot molt
    # and will die.

    # These eggs would lack a maternal cholesterol supply. The offspring's diet contains
    # 2mg/L cholesterol as the only usable sterol source. The text states that a diet of
    # 2mg/L cholesterol is insufficient for larvae to survive to adulthood.
