    # The problem asks for the maximal probability p such that Alice can design a
    # strategy that guarantees a win with at least probability p for ANY input sequence.

    # We outline the optimal strategy for Alice.
    # 1. Open the maximum number of boxes possible to gain the most information.
    #    This means opening N-1 boxes.
    # 2. To make the strategy work for any set of numbers, Alice should introduce
    #    randomness. She will choose 1 of the N boxes uniformly at random to be
    #    her 'target' box (the one she will not open).
    # 3. She opens the other N-1 boxes and observes the numbers.
    # 4. She then makes a guess for the number in the 'target' box. Her guess must be a
    #    bounded interval. The numbers are non-negative, so 0 is a universal lower bound.
    #    The best upper bound she can use from her observations is the maximum value
    #    she saw in the opened boxes. Let's call it M_observed.
    #    Her guess is the interval [0, M_observed].

    # Now, let's analyze when this strategy leads to a win.
    # Alice wins if the number in her target box (let's call it `u`) is in the interval [0, M_observed].
    # Since all numbers are non-negative, this is true if u <= M_observed.
    
    # When does Alice lose?
    # Alice loses if u > M_observed. M_observed is the maximum of all numbers *except* u.
    # The condition `u > max(all numbers except u)` is true only if `u` is the largest
    # number in the entire set of N boxes.
    
    # Therefore, Alice's strategy fails if and only if her randomly chosen 'target' box
    # happens to contain the overall maximum number.

    # The probability that her random choice lands on the box with the maximum number is 1/N.
    prob_loss_numerator = 1
    prob_loss_denominator = N
    
    # The probability of success is 1 minus the probability of loss.
    prob_win_numerator = prob_loss_denominator - prob_loss_numerator
    prob_win_denominator = prob_loss_denominator
