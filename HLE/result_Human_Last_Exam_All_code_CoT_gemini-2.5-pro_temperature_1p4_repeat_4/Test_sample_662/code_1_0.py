# Define the known variables based on the problem description
R0 = 3.0  # Basic reproduction number of the virus
infection_rate_vaccinated_percent = 6.0 # 6% of vaccinated people can still get infected

# --- Step 1: Calculate Vaccine Effectiveness (ve) ---
# Vaccine effectiveness is the percentage of infections the vaccine prevents.
# If 6% of vaccinated people get infected, the vaccine is 100% - 6% = 94% effective.
infection_rate_vaccinated = infection_rate_vaccinated_percent / 100.0
vaccine_effectiveness = 1 - infection_rate_vaccinated

# --- Step 2: Calculate the required vaccine coverage (p) ---
# To stop the epidemic, the effective reproduction number (Re) must be <= 1.
# The threshold formula is: 1 = R0 * (1 - p * ve)
# We solve for 'p' (the proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated).
# The rearranged formula is: p = (1 - (1 / R0)) / ve
p_proportion = (1 - (1 / R0)) / vaccine_effectiveness

# Convert the resulting proportion to a percentage for the final answer
p_percentage = p_proportion * 100

# --- Step 3: Print the explanation and the final result ---
