    "To solve for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factor the general term:** The term inside the product, $1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3}$, can be factored using the cubic roots of unity. The cubic roots of 1 are $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$. This allows us to write:\n    $$1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right)$$\n\n2.  **Use a known product identity:** The infinite product is related to a generalization of the sine product formula, which can be expressed using the Gamma function $\\Gamma(z)$. The identity for a product starting from $n=1$ is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n3.  **Adjust the starting index:** The problem asks for the product starting from $n=3$. We can relate this to the product starting from $n=1$ by separating the first two terms (for $n=1$ and $n=2$):\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\underbrace{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)}_{n=1} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)}_{n=2} \\cdot \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) $$\n    Therefore, the desired product is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(1-z^3/8\\right)} $$\n\n4.  **Combine the results:** Substituting the identity from Step 2 into the expression from Step 3 gives the final formula.\n\nThe following Python code prints the final derived formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef final_formula_printer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the closed-form expression for the infinite product\n    Product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3/n^3).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the components of the formula for clarity\n    lhs = \"Product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3/n^3)\"\n\n    # The denominator consists of the first two terms (n=1, n=2) and the Gamma functions\n    term_n1 = \"1 - z^3\"\n    term_n2 = \"1 - z^3/8\"\n    gamma_terms = \"Gamma(1-z) * Gamma(1-w*z) * Gamma(1-w^2*z)\"\n\n    rhs = f\"1 / (({term_n1}) * ({term_n2}) * {gamma_terms})\"\n    \n    # Definition of w (omega)\n    omega_def = \"w = exp(i*2*pi/3)\"\n\n    # Print the final equation\n    print(f\"{lhs} = {rhs}\")\n    print(f\"where {omega_def}\")\n    \n    # To satisfy the \"output each number\" requirement, we explicitly show the numbers from the formula\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers appearing in the final equation are:\")\n    print(\"Start of product index: 3\")\n    print(\"Power of z and n: 3\")\n    print(\"Term for n=1: (1 - z^3/1^3), which contains 1 and 3.\")\n    print(\"Term for n=2: (1 - z^3/2^3), which contains 1, 3, 2, 3.
