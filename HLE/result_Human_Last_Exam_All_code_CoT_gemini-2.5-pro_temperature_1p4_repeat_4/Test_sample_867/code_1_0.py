# Plan:
# 1. Identify the number of sissone fermes in the first characteristic sequence of the variation.
# 2. Identify the number of sissone fermes in the second characteristic sequence.
# 3. Sum these two numbers to find the total.

# Number of sissone fermes in the first diagonal sequence
first_sequence = 4

# Number of sissone fermes in the second diagonal sequence
second_sequence = 4

# Calculate the total number
total_sissone_fermes = first_sequence + second_sequence

# Print the final equation and the result
print(f"Svetlana Zakharova performed {first_sequence} + {second_sequence} sissone fermes, for a total of:")
