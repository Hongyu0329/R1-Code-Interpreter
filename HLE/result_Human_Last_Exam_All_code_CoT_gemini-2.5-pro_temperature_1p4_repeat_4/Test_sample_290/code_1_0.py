    # in T = S U {O} with a path of at most 2 lines.

    # pass through the central point O. This ensures any two lines intersect (at O),
    # so any two points on any two different lines can be connected.
    # This setup also guarantees connectivity to and from O.

    # With this configuration, each of the 9 lines cuts the circle at 2 distinct points.
    # The intersection points of the lines themselves are all at O, which is not
    # on the circle. Thus, no points on the circle are shared between lines.

    # the number of points each line creates on the circle.
