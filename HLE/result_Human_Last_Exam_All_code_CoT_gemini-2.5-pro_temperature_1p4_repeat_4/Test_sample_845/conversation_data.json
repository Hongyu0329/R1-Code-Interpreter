    "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a measure of the variation in time between consecutive heartbeats. This variation is the physiological phenomenon of the heart rate speeding up and slowing down with each breath.\n\nTo calculate HRV, the fundamental piece of data required is the precise time elapsed between one heartbeat and the next. This duration is known by a few names, but the most common and general term is the **Inter-beat interval (IBI)**.\n\nWhen measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG), this is specifically called the **R-R interval**, as it's the time between the peaks of two consecutive R-waves in the heart's electrical cycle. When using photoplethysmography (PPG) as mentioned in the question, the device measures the time between peaks in the pulse wave, which serves as a proxy for the R-R interval. In this context, the term Inter-beat interval (IBI) is often used.\n\n<<<Inter-beat interval>>>"
