    "An elegant way to compute the Hopf charge for this field is by using a simplified form of the Whitehead formula. The Hopf charge, a topological invariant, can be calculated as a line integral of a potential one-form, `A`, over a curve `C` which is the preimage of any point on the target sphere S².\n\nThe formula is `H = (1 / (2π)) ∮ A`.\n\nFor the given vector field, parameterized by the spherical angles `G` and `f`, the field configuration can be described by a 2-form `F = sin(G) dG ∧ df`. A valid potential `A` such that `dA = F` is `A = -cos(G) df`.\n\nWe can choose a convenient point on the sphere, for instance, the south pole `n = (0, 0, -1)`, which corresponds to `G = π`. The preimage of this point is the curve `C` in 3D space where `G = π`. According to the definition of `G`, this occurs when `r2 = 0`, which is the circle defined by `x² + y² = 0.5` and `z = 0`.\n\nAlong this circle `C`, the value of `G` is constant at `π`, so `cos(G) = -1`. The potential `A` simplifies to `A = -(-1) df = df`.\nThe Hopf charge integral then becomes:\n`H = (1 / (2π)) ∮_C df`\n\nSince the curve `C` is a simple closed loop that encircles the z-axis once, the integral of `df` (where `f` is the azimuthal angle) is `2π`.\nTherefore, the Hopf charge is `H = (1 / (2π)) * 2π = 1`.\n\nThe Python code below verifies this by numerically computing the line integral of the potential `A` along the parameterized circle `C`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the constants and basic functions from the problem statement\nPI = np.pi\n\ndef get_G(x, y, z):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the angle G at a point (x,y,z).\"\"\"\n    rho2 = x*x + y*y\n    r2 = np.sqrt((rho2 - 0.5)**2 + z*z)\n    # Add a small epsilon to r2 to handle the case r2=0 numerically,\n    # although analytically we know G=pi when r2=0.\n    if r2 < 1e-9:\n        return PI\n    return PI * np.exp(-10 * r2)\n\ndef get_Ax(x, y, z):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the x-component of the potential vector A.\"\"\"\n    rho2 = x*x + y*y\n    if rho2 < 1e-9:\n        return 0\n    G = get_G(x, y, z)\n    # A_x from A = -cos(G)df = -cos(G)*(-y/rho^2)dx + ...\n    return np.cos(G) * y / rho2\n\ndef get_Ay(x, y, z):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the y-component of the potential vector A.\"\"\"\n    rho2 = x*x + y*y\n    if rho2 < 1e-9:\n        return 0\n    G = get_G(x, y, z)\n    # A_y from A = -cos(G)df = ... + -cos(G)*(x/rho^2)dy\n    return -np.cos(G) * x / rho2\n\n# Parameterize the curve C, which is the preimage of the south pole (G=pi).\n# This curve is a circle: x^2 + y^2 = 0.5, z = 0.\n# Let r(t) = (radius * cos(t), radius * sin(t), 0) for t in [0, 2*pi].\nradius = np.sqrt(0.5)\n\ndef integrand(t):\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines the integrand for the line integral H = (1/2pi) * integral(A . dl).\n    This is (Ax * dx/dt + Ay * dy/dt).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Position on the curve C\n    x = radius * np.cos(t)\n    y = radius * np.sin(t)\n    z = 0\n\n    # Derivatives of the path dx/dt, dy/dt\n    dxdt = -radius * np.sin(t)\n    dydt = radius * np.cos(t)\n\n    # Potential components Ax, Ay evaluated on the curve\n    Ax_val = get_Ax(x, y, z)\n    Ay_val = get_Ay(x, y, z)\n\n    # The dot product A .
