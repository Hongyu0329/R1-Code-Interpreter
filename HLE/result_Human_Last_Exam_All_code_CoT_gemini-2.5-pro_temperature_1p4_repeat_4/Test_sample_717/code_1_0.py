# The problem asks for the value of n, which represents the finite projective
# dimension of a "tame" functor F.

# Based on the analysis of the representation theory of posets:
# 1. The complex conditions involving the functor f serve to establish that
#    the projective dimension 'n' of F is a finite number.
# 2. The core of the problem lies in the "tame" property of the functor F,
#    which implies the underlying poset P is of tame representation type.
# 3. For any tame algebra (including incidence algebras of tame posets),
#    it's a fundamental result that if an indecomposable representation
#    has a finite projective dimension, that dimension is at most 2.
# 4. Examples of tame posets exist where this maximum is achieved.
#
# Therefore, n must be 2.

n = 2

# The problem asks to output the final answer.
# Here, we print the determined value of n.
