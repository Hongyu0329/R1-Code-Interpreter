# This code will print the numbers of the correct statements, one per line.
# Statement 4 is correct because the property of being nontrivially coupled is
# preserved by the direct algebraic relationship between the Jost matrix F(E)
# and the scattering matrix S(E).
# Statement 5 is correct due to known results from inverse scattering theory,
# which confirm the existence of nontrivially coupled potentials that can
# produce diagonal (i.e., trivially coupled) Jost matrices.
# Statements 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect because they falsely assume that the
# coupling property of the potential always maps directly to the coupling
# property of the scattering data; Statement 5 provides the counterexample.
