    print("D. Sepsis: Highly likely. Sepsis is the most common cause of ARDS. The patient is at high risk for a post-operative infection (e.g., an abscess) following a major Whipple procedure, and the 29-day timeline is consistent with this complication developing.")
    print("E. Myocyte necrosis: Less likely. While a heart attack can cause lung issues, sepsis is a more probable cause of ARDS in this post-surgical context.")
    print("F. Respiratory deconditioning: Unlikely. Does not cause acute, severe hypoxemia with bilateral crackles.")

    print("Conclusion:")
