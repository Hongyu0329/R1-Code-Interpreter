    "To solve this problem, I will calculate `a(10)`, which represents the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice (also known as a Manhattan lattice).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. We need to find the total number of such paths that are exactly 10 steps long.\n2.  **Choose a Method:** There is no known simple mathematical formula for `a(n)`. Therefore, I will use a computational approach to count all possible valid walks.\n3.  **Algorithm Design (Recursive Backtracking):**\n    *   I will write a recursive function that explores paths step by step.\n    *   The function will start at a fixed origin, say `(0,0)`.\n    *   At each step, it will try to move in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).\n    *   To ensure the \"self-avoiding\" property, the function will keep track of all points currently in the path using a `set` for efficient lookup. A move is only valid if it goes to a point not already in the set.\n    *   The recursion stops when the path has reached the desired length of 10 steps. When this happens, we have found one valid walk, so we count it.\n    *   The total count is the sum of all valid walks found.\n4.  **Implementation:** I will implement this algorithm in Python. The code will set up the recursive function and call it to find the value of `a(10)`. The final output will be printed in the format `a(10) = result`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Increase the recursion limit for deep recursive searches, although not strictly\n# necessary for n=10, it's good practice for this type of problem.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\ndef solve_saw_count(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of steps in the walk.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The total number of n-step self-avoiding walks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right\n    moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]\n    \n    # Path is a set of visited (x, y) tuples for O(1) lookup.\n    # The walk starts at the origin (0,0).\n    path = {(0, 0)}\n\n    def count_walks(current_pos, steps_left):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts valid self-avoiding walks from the current position.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If we have taken n steps, we found one complete valid walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        total_walks = 0\n        x, y = current_pos\n\n        # Explore all four possible directions.\n        for dx, dy in moves:\n            next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)\n            \n            # If the next position has not been visited yet...\n            if next_pos not in path:\n                # ...take the step: add the new position to the path.\n                path.add(next_pos)\n                \n                # Recursively continue the walk from the new position.\n                total_walks += count_walks(next_pos, steps_left - 1)\n                \n                # Backtrack: remove the position to explore other branches.\n                path.remove(next_pos)\n        \n        return total_walks\n\n    # Start the calculation from the origin (0,0) with n steps to take.\n    return count_walks((0, 0), n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10\n    result = solve_saw_count(n)\n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # The equation is a(10) = result.
