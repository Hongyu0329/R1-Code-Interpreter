Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the physics:

1.  **The Phenomenon of Tunneling in Ammonia:**
    In an ammonia molecule (NH3), the structure is a pyramid with the nitrogen atom at the apex and the three hydrogen atoms at the base. The nitrogen atom is not fixed on one side of the hydrogen plane; it can pass through to the other side. Classically, this is forbidden as the nitrogen does not have enough energy to go over the potential barrier of the planar configuration. However, quantum mechanics allows it to "tunnel" through the barrier. This rapid tunneling splits the molecule's ground vibrational state into two very close energy levels: a symmetric state and an antisymmetric state. The existence of this energy splitting *is* the tunneling phenomenon.

2.  **The Role of Nuclear Spin and Quantum Statistics:**
    The rules of quantum mechanics (specifically, the Pauli Principle) dictate how the total wavefunction of a system of identical particles must behave.
    *   **Ordinary Hydrogen (Protons):** Protons have nuclear spin 1/2, which makes them **fermions**. For a system of identical fermions, the total wavefunction must be *antisymmetric* (it must change sign) when you exchange any two particles.
    *   **Exotic Hydrogen:** The problem states these have nuclear spin 0, which makes them **bosons**. For a system of identical bosons, the total wavefunction must be *symmetric* (it must not change) when you exchange any two particles.

3.  **Symmetry Analysis for Exotic Ammonia:**
    The total wavefunction (Ψ_total) can be seen as a product of its parts:
    Ψ_total = Ψ_nuclear_spin × Ψ_rotational × Ψ_vibrational × Ψ_electronic

    For our exotic ammonia with three identical spin-0 hydrogens (bosons), Ψ_total must be symmetric.

    *   **Nuclear Spin Part (Ψ_nuclear_spin):** For spin-0 particles, there's only one possible spin configuration (all spins are zero). This wavefunction is always **symmetric**.
    *   **Symmetry Constraint:** Since Ψ_total must be symmetric and Ψ_nuclear_spin is already symmetric, the product of the other parts (Ψ_rotational × Ψ_vibrational × Ψ_electronic) must also be symmetric.
    *   **Vibrational and Rotational Parts:** The ground electronic state is symmetric. The tunneling creates a symmetric vibrational state (let's call it V_s) and an antisymmetric one (V_a). To maintain overall symmetry, these must combine with rotational states of the appropriate symmetry:
        - Allowed State 1: A symmetric rotational state combines with the symmetric vibrational state (V_s). The product is symmetric.
        - Allowed State 2: An antisymmetric rotational state combines with the antisymmetric vibrational state (V_a). The product (antisymmetric × antisymmetric) is also symmetric.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    Because rotational states of both symmetric and antisymmetric character exist, it is possible for the molecule to exist in quantum states corresponding to *both* levels of the tunneling doublet. The fundamental potential energy landscape that causes tunneling is determined by masses and electromagnetic forces, not nuclear spin. The nuclear spin statistics only provide "selection rules" for which rotational states are allowed. Since the rules for bosons do not forbid either of the two split-energy states from existing, the energy splitting will persist.

Therefore, the molecule will exhibit tunneling.
