    # --- Analysis of X_1 ---
    # X_1 is the Hilbert scheme of 11 points in A^3, denoted Hilb_11(A^3).
    # Type: It is representable by a scheme. [S]
    # Separated (s): As a scheme, it is separated. [s]
    # Universally closed (uc): The Hilbert scheme of an affine space is not proper (not uc).
    # Irreducible (irr): Hilb_d(A^3) is reducible for d >= 4. Here d=11, so it is not irreducible.
    # Dimension (dim): The dimension is n * d.
    n1 = 3
    d1 = 11

    # --- Analysis of X_2 ---
    # X_2 is the quotient stack [(A^4 \ V(xy-zw))/C^*].
    # Type: The C^* action with weights (1,4,2,3) on A^4 has trivial stabilizers on the open set U = A^4 \ V(xy-zw).
    # A stack with finite stabilizers is a Deligne-Mumford stack. [DM]
    # Separated (s): It's a quotient of a separated scheme by a reductive group, so it's separated. [s]
    # Universally closed (uc): The underlying space U is not proper, so the stack is not proper (not uc).
    # Irreducible (irr): U is an open subset of an irreducible variety A^4, so U is irreducible. The stack is therefore irreducible. [irr]
    # Dimension (dim): dim([U/G]) = dim(U) - dim(G).
    dim_U = 4
    dim_G = 1
    dim2 = dim_U - dim_G # 4 - 1 = 3
    profile_2 = f"[DM,s,irr,{dim2}]"

    # --- Analysis of X_3 ---
    # X_3 is the Picard stack Pic_{C_0} of a genus 7 curve C_0.
    # Type: The stabilizer of any object (a line bundle) is Aut(L) = C^*, which is not finite. Thus, it's an Algebraic stack. [A]
    # Separated (s): The Picard stack of a proper curve is separated. [s]
    # Universally closed (uc): Pic_{C_0} is an infinite disjoint union of its components by degree, so it is not quasi-compact, hence not proper (not uc).
    # Irreducible (irr): As it is a disjoint union of components, it is not irreducible.
    # Dimension (dim): The dimension of each component Pic^d_{C_0} is dim(Jacobian) - dim(stabilizer).
    g = 7
