Step-by-step analysis of the experimental data:

1.  **Control Reaction:** The baseline kcat is 500/s. This is the reference for enzyme activity.

2.  **Function of Al1 (Activator):**
    *   In the presence of 5 mM Al1, the kcat increases from 500/s to 1000/s.
    *   Conclusion: Al1 is a potent activator of Zma1. As it is not the substrate, it functions as an allosteric modulator.

3.  **Function of Al2 (Inhibitor):**
    *   In the presence of 5 mM Al2, the kcat decreases from 500/s to 150/s.
    *   Conclusion: Al2 is an inhibitor of Zma1, likely an allosteric modulator.

4.  **Binding Sites of Al1 and Al2:**
    *   When both 5 mM Al1 and 5 mM Al2 are present, the kcat is 150/s. This is the same rate observed with Al2 alone.
    *   Conclusion: The activator (Al1) does not overcome the inhibitor (Al2). This suggests they compete for the same allosteric binding site on the enzyme.

5.  **Function of Rga1 (Inhibitor):**
    *   In the presence of 100 mM Rga1, the kcat drops sharply from 500/s to 10/s.
    *   When the substrate concentration is increased fivefold, the kcat remains at 10/s.
    *   Conclusion: Since adding more substrate does not reverse the inhibition, Rga1 is not a competitive inhibitor. This behavior is characteristic of an irreversible or non-competitive inhibitor.

6.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   Choice A is incorrect because calling Rga1 a "reversible inhibitor" is misleading; its effect is not reversed by substrate.
    *   Choice B is incorrect because CaCl2 shows no effect (kcat remains 500/s), so it is not a cofactor.
    *   Choice C is correct. It correctly identifies Al1 and Al2 as allosteric modulators, correctly deduces they bind the same site based on the kcat of 150/s in experiment 7, and correctly classifies Rga1 as an irreversible inhibitor based on the kcat of 10/s in experiment 11.
    *   Choice D is incorrect because XAG1's inhibition is reversed by substrate (kcat from 10/s to 450/s), making it a reversible, not irreversible, inhibitor.
    *   Choices F, G, and H contain similar errors.

Final Conclusion: Based on the analysis of all kcat values, choice C is the only statement that is fully supported by the data.
