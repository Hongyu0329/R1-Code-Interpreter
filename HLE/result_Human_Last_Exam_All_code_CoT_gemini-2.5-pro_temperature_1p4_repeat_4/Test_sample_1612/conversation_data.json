    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the total number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\nFirst, I will identify the two types of Triple Crowns in MLB: the batting Triple Crown and the pitching Triple Crown. I will create two separate lists containing the names of the unique players who have won each award. Then, I will calculate the number of winners in each list. Since no player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown, the total number of winners is the sum of the counts from both lists. Finally, I will display the calculation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# A list of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n# A player is only listed once, even if they won multiple times (e.g., Ted Williams, Rogers Hornsby).\nbatting_winners = [\n    \"Paul Hines\", \"Tip O'Neill\", \"Hugh Duffy\", \"Nap Lajoie\", \"Ty Cobb\",\n    \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"Chuck Klein\", \"Jimmie Foxx\", \"Lou Gehrig\", \"Joe Medwick\",\n    \"Ted Williams\", \"Mickey Mantle\", \"Frank Robinson\", \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"Miguel Cabrera\"\n]\n\n# A list of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown.\n# A player is only listed once, even if they won multiple times (e.g., Walter Johnson, Sandy Koufax).\npitching_winners = [\n    \"Tommy Bond\", \"Old Hoss Radbourn\", \"Guy Hecker\", \"Tim Keefe\", \"John Clarkson\",\n    \"Amos Rusie\", \"Cy Young\", \"Rube Waddell\", \"Christy Mathewson\", \"Walter Johnson\",\n    \"Grover Cleveland Alexander\", \"Dazzy Vance\", \"Lefty Grove\", \"Lefty Gomez\", \"Bucky Walters\",\n    \"Bob Feller\", \"Hal Newhouser\", \"Sandy Koufax\", \"Steve Carlton\", \"Roger Clemens\",\n    \"Randy Johnson\", \"Pedro Martinez\", \"Johan Santana\", \"Jake Peavy\", \"Clayton Kershaw\",\n    \"Justin Verlander\", \"Shane Bieber\", \"Gerrit Cole\"\n]\n\n\nnum_batting_winners = len(batting_winners)\nnum_pitching_winners = len(pitching_winners)\ntotal_winners = num_batting_winners + num_pitching_winners\n\nprint(f\"Number of batting Triple Crown winners: {num_batting_winners}\")\nprint(f\"Number of pitching Triple Crown winners: {num_pitching_winners}\")\nprint(f\"Total MLB Triple Crown winners: {num_batting_winners} + {num_pitching_winners} = {total_winners}\")\n```\n<<<43>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
