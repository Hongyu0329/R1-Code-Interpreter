    "No, the provided Java program does not solve the problem correctly.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Java Program:** I will first examine the conditional logic in the Java code to determine why it's incorrect.\n2.  **Design an Efficient C Solution:** I will devise a new approach in C. The main optimization insight is that for any of the four possible statements (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`), the character at the second position (index 1) uniquely identifies the operation. If `statement[1]` is `+`, it's an increment. If it's `-`, it's a decrement. This avoids complex string comparisons and requires checking only a single character per statement.\n3.  **Implement the C Code:** I will write the C code using `scanf` for fast input and implement the optimized logic from the previous step.\n4.  **Calculate Efficiency Metrics:** Based on the C code, I will calculate `x` (the number of character comparisons for 100 instructions) and `y` (the memory size in bytes for the main variables).\n5.  **Format the Final Answer:** I will provide the final answer in the requested format `Nx+y`.\n\n### Analysis of the Java Program:\nThe Java program is incorrect because its conditional statements are too specific.\n*   `if (test.contains(\"++X\"))` only matches the literal string \"++X\". It fails to handle the \"X++\" case.\n*   `if (test.contains(\"--X\"))` only matches the literal string \"--X\". It fails to handle the \"X--\" case.\n\nBecause it misses two of the four possible valid inputs, the program is faulty.\n\n### C Solution:\nHere is a corrected and highly efficient implementation in C. It reads each statement and checks only the middle character to determine whether to increment or decrement the counter.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Read the number of statements\n    int n;\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    // Initialize the result variable x to 0\n    int x = 0;\n    \n    // Buffer to hold one statement (e.g., \"X++\") and a null terminator\n    char statement[4];\n\n    // Loop n times\n    while (n-- > 0) {\n        // Read the next statement\n        scanf(\"%s\", statement);\n        \n        // The character at index 1 is sufficient to determine the operation.\n        // For \"++X\" and \"X++\", statement[1] is '+'.\n        // For \"--X\" and \"X--\", statement[1] is '-'.\n        if (statement[1] == '+') {\n            x++;\n        } else {\n            x--;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the final value of x\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Efficiency Calculation:\n*   `x` (Character Comparisons for 100 instructions): The code performs exactly one character comparison (`statement[1] == '+'`) per instruction. For 100 instructions, this is `1 * 100 = 100` comparisons.\n*   `y` (Memory Size in Bytes): The main variables used are `int n`, `int x`, and `char statement[4]`. Assuming a common architecture where `int` is 4 bytes and `char` is 1 byte, the total memory is `4 + 4 + (4 * 1) = 12` bytes.\n\n<<<N100+12>>>"
