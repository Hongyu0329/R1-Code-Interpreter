    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of a given conductor $d$ and order $g$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n2.  **Character Decomposition**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a composite number $d = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n3.  **Primitivity Condition**: The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its components $\\chi_i$. For $\\chi$ to be primitive of conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be primitive for its corresponding modulus $p_i^{a_i}$. In our case, the prime factorization of $d$ is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$, which is square-free. For a prime modulus $p$, a character is primitive if and only if it is non-trivial (i.e., its order is greater than 1).\n4.  **Order Condition**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components. We are given that the order must be $g=6$. So, we must have $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n5.  **Counting Characters**: This condition implies that the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be a divisor of 6. Combined with the primitivity condition (order > 1), the possible orders for each component are {2, 3, 6}.\n6.  **Number of Choices per Component**: The number of characters of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $\\phi(p)$. We'll verify this condition for each prime factor of $d$.\n7.  **Combinatorial Calculation**: We calculate the total number of tuples of component characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ where each character's order is in {2, 3, 6}. Then, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to subtract the combinations where the lcm of the orders is a proper divisor of 6 (namely, 2 or 3).\n    *   The total number of choices for each component is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6)$.\n    *   The lcm is 2 if and only if all component orders are 2.\n    *   The lcm is 3 if and only if all component orders are 3.\n8.  **Final Result**: The final number is the total number of combinations minus those whose lcm is 2 or 3.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp = n\n    while p * p <= temp:\n        if temp % p == 0:\n            while temp % p == 0:\n                temp //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        result -= result // temp\n    return int(result)\n\ndef solve_dirichlet_character_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of counting primitive Dirichlet characters\n    of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order g = {g}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Prime factorization of d\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = sorted(list(factors.keys()))\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of d = {d} is {' * '.join(map(str, primes))}.\")\n    print(\"Since d is square-free, a character is primitive if its components are non-trivial.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Character order conditions\n    print(f\"Step 2: The order of the character must be {g}.\")\n    print(\"This means the order of each component character must be a non-trivial divisor of 6, i.e., from {2, 3, 6}.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Count character choices for each prime component\n    num_primes = len(primes)\n    print(f\"Step 3: Count the number of choices for the {num_primes} component characters.\")\n    \n    # We need to count characters of order k for k in {2,3,6}\n    # Number of characters of order k mod p is phi(k), provided k | phi(p)\n    # Check if this holds for our primes\n    for p in primes:\n        if not (phi(p) % 6 == 0):\n             print(f\"Note: for p={p}, phi(p)={phi(p)} is not divisible by 6, but this logic holds for subsets of divisors.\")\n\n    phi_2 = phi(2)\n    phi_3 = phi(3)\n    phi_6 = phi(6)\n    \n    num_choices_per_prime = phi_2 + phi_3 + phi_6\n    print(f\"The number of choices for each component (orders in {{2, 3, 6}}) is phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6) = {phi_2} + {phi_3} + {phi_6} = {num_choices_per_prime}.\")\n    \n    total_combinations = num_choices_per_prime ** num_primes\n    print(f\"With {num_primes} prime factors, the total combinations of such components is {num_choices_per_prime}^{num_primes} = {total_combinations}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Subtract cases where lcm is a proper divisor of g\n    print(f\"Step 4: Exclude combinations where the lcm of orders is a proper divisor of {g} (i.e., 2 or 3).\")\n    \n    # Case lcm = 2\n    bad_comb_2 = phi_2 ** num_primes\n    print(f\"The lcm is 2 if all components have order 2.
