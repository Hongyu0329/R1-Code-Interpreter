# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the core concepts: "genomic decay" and "persistence of small genomic fragments".
# 2. Evaluate the primary evolutionary forces at play: Natural selection and genetic drift.
# 3. Determine the relationship between these forces in the context of the question. Genomic decay is most prominent in organisms with small effective population sizes (e.g., endosymbionts).
# 4. In small populations, genetic drift is a powerful force. Small DNA fragments likely have a very small (nearly neutral) effect on fitness, meaning selection against them is very weak.
# 5. Conclude that strong genetic drift can overpower weak selection, allowing these fragments to persist randomly. This is known as the drift-barrier hypothesis.
# 6. Use a series of print statements to walk through this logic and present the final answer.

print("Step 1: Understand the context.")
print("Genomic decay is the reduction of genome size, common in organisms with small effective population sizes, like symbionts or parasites.")
print("The question asks why small, non-functional DNA fragments are not always deleted during this process.")
print("\nStep 2: Consider the primary evolutionary forces.")
print("   - Natural Selection: This force acts to remove DNA that has a negative impact on fitness. Carrying and replicating useless DNA has a small metabolic cost, so selection will weakly favor its deletion.")
print("   - Genetic Drift: This is the random fluctuation of genetic variants due to chance. Its effect is much stronger in small populations than in large ones.")
print("\nStep 3: Analyze the interplay between these forces.")
print("A small genomic fragment has a very tiny fitness cost. Therefore, the force of natural selection trying to remove it is extremely weak.")
print("In the small populations where genome decay occurs, the force of genetic drift is very strong.")
print("\nStep 4: Formulate the conclusion.")
print("The strong random force of genetic drift can easily overpower the very weak directional force of natural selection. This means the fate of a small fragment—whether it is deleted or persists—is determined more by chance (drift) than by its small fitness cost (selection).")
print("Therefore, the strength of genetic drift is the primary factor influencing the persistence of these fragments.")
print("="*70)
print("Evaluating the options based on this conclusion:")
print("A. The rate of beneficial mutations: Irrelevant to the persistence of old, non-functional DNA.")
print("B. The strength of genetic drift: Correct. It overpowers weak selection against small fragments.")
print("C. The efficiency of natural selection: Incorrect. High efficiency would lead to the removal of fragments.")
print("D. The presence of gene duplication: This creates fragments but doesn't explain their persistence.")
print("E. The level of environmental pressure: An indirect factor that influences selection, but drift is the direct mechanism of persistence.")
