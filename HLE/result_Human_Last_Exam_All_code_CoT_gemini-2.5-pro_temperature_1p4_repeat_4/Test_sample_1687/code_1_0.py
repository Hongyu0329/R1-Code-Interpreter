# The clinical scenario presents a patient who undergoes a difficult colonoscopy.

symptom_1 = "upper abdominal pain and left-shoulder discomfort"
# Left-shoulder pain is also known as Kehr's sign, caused by blood irritating the diaphragm.

initial_hemoglobin = 11.7
later_hemoglobin = 6.5
signs_of_shock = ["tachycardia", "hypotension", "dizziness"]

# Physical exam findings are consistent with internal bleeding and irritation of the abdominal lining.
exam_findings = ["tenderness to palpation involving her left upper quadrant", "worsening tenderness", "significant amount of guarding", "peritoneal signs", "worsening abdominal distension"]

# Let's analyze the options:
# A. Colonic perforation: Possible, but doesn't fully explain the specific LUQ + shoulder pain and the severity of bleeding.
# B. Lower GI bleeding: Unlikely to cause LUQ and shoulder pain.
# D. Postpolypectomy syndrome: Ruled out because no polypectomy was performed.

# C. Splenic laceration: This diagnosis fits all the pieces of the puzzle.
# The spleen is in the LUQ.
# A tear during a difficult colonoscopy (especially at the splenic flexure) can cause a laceration.
# A lacerated spleen bleeds profusely, explaining the shock and hemoglobin drop.
# Blood from the spleen irritates the diaphragm, causing referred pain to the left shoulder (Kehr's sign).
