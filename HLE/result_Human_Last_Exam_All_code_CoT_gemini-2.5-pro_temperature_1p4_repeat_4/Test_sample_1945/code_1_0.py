Step 1: The condition for a pair (p,q) to be 'good'.
A pair (p,q) is 'good' if we can get from any permutation of {1, ..., n} to any other by swapping numbers with difference p or q.
This is equivalent to the graph with vertices V = {1, ..., n} and edges between i and j if |i-j| in {p,q} being connected.
Given that 1 < p,q <= n are coprime integers, it has been established that a sufficient and necessary condition for this graph to be connected is:
p + q <= n + 1

    # Part 2: Limit of the probability
    probability_explanation = f"""
Step 2: Calculating the limit of Pr(n).
Pr(n) is the probability that a pair (p,q) randomly selected from {{2, ..., n}} x {{2, ..., n}} is both coprime and 'good'.
The total number of such pairs is (n-1)^2.

The number of 'good' and coprime pairs is the count of (p,q) such that:
1. 2 <= p <= n
2. 2 <= q <= n
3. gcd(p,q) = 1
4. p + q <= n + 1

As n approaches infinity, we can determine this probability by considering two independent events for randomly chosen integers:
a) The probability that they satisfy p + q <= n + 1.
   Geometrically, this corresponds to the ratio of the area of the triangle defined by p>=2, q>=2, p+q<=n+1 to the area of the square p in [2,n], q in [2,n].
   For large n, this ratio of areas approaches 1/2.
b) The probability that they are coprime.
   This is a well-known result from number theory, which is 1/zeta(2) = 6 / pi^2.

The limit of Pr(n) is the product of these two probabilities.
