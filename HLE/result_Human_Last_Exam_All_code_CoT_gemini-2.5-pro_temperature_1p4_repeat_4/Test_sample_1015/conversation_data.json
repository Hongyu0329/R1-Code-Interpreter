    "Of course. Here is my plan to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the specific ballet movement in question: the *cambré derrière*, which is a bend of the upper body backward. Then, I will research the stylistic and technical hallmarks of the two specified classical ballet methodologies, Vaganova and Balanchine, as they relate to this movement. I will create a Python script that programmatically defines the key characteristics of the cambré in each style. The script will then compare these characteristics based on the provided multiple-choice options and print out the most fundamental technical difference. This will lead to the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_ballet_techniques():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares the cambré derrière in Vaganova and Balanchine methods\n    to identify the primary technical difference.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the characteristics of cambré derrière for each method\n    vaganova = {\n        'id': 'Vaganova',\n        'Placement of hip': 'Hips remain square and vertically aligned over the supporting legs.
