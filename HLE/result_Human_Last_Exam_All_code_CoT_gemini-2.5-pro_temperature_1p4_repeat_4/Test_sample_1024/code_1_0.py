# Part A: The Sherlock Holmes story is "The Adventure of the Priory School".
# The reversed shoes belonged to a horse, but were made to look like cow tracks.
# In the spirit of Nabokovian illusion, we choose the illusion (the cow) over the reality.
a = 6

# Part B: The theme underscored is "education vs mis-education".
# The elaborate deception in the Holmes story mirrors Kinbote's use of
# scholarly apparatus to "mis-educate" the reader about the poem's meaning.
b = 3

# Part C: The work where Nabokov most pervasively experienced "intricate back-referencing"
# was his monumental translation and commentary of Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin".
c = 7

# The numbers must add up to a multiple of 8.
# 6 + 3 + 7 = 16, which is a multiple of 8.
# The final answer is the sequence of these three numbers.
