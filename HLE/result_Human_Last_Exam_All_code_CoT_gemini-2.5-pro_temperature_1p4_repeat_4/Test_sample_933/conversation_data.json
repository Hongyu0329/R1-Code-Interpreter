    "To solve this problem, I will use my knowledge of inorganic chemistry to identify the standard, efficient synthesis conditions for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Recall or look up the primary method for producing XeF₄. This is the direct reaction between xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas.\n2.  Identify the typical temperature required for this reaction to be efficient. The established method involves heating the reactants.\n3.  The chemical equation for the synthesis is Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄. The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" can be interpreted as displaying the stoichiometric coefficients and subscripts from this balanced equation.\n4.  Write a Python script that will encode this chemical knowledge, print the explanation including the reaction equation, and identify the correct temperature from the given choices.\n5.  The script will then print the final correct answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_xenon_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the optimal synthesis temperature for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\n    based on established chemical knowledge and identifies the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The user provided answer choices and their corresponding temperatures in Celsius.\n    choices = {\n        'A': 600,\n        'B': 400,\n        'C': 200,\n        'D': 78,\n        'E': 0,\n        'F': -78\n    }\n\n    # Chemical Knowledge: The most common and efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\n    # is achieved by the direct combination of xenon and fluorine gas at a specific temperature.\n    optimal_temperature_celsius = 400\n\n    # The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is: Xe + 2F₂ -> XeF₄\n    # Let's break down the numbers in the equation as requested.\n    reactants = {'Xe': 1, 'F₂': 2}\n    products = {'XeF₄': 1}\n    \n    print(\"The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is most efficiently performed by the direct reaction of its constituent elements, Xenon and Fluorine.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\")\n    \n    # Fulfilling the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\"\n    # by showing the coefficients and subscripts.\n    # The stoichiometric numbers are 1, 2, and 1.
