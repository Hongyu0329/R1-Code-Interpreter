    # Question 1: "What animal's coat color changed as a baby?"
    # Doc 1 states the change for young bulls happened "at a few months old".
    # Doc 2 states the change happened "as they reached puberty".
    # The phrase "at a few months old" is a much better match for the term "baby" than "puberty".
    # Therefore, Document 1 is the top-ranked document for Question 1.

    # --- Step 2: Analysis for Question 2 ---
    # Question 2: "What animal's coat color did not change as a baby?"
    # Both documents state that "Cows retained the reddish-brown colour".
    # However, the question specifically asks about the "baby" period.
    # Document 1 provides a clear timeframe for the baby/young period ("at a few months old")
    # against which the cows' lack of change can be measured.
    # Document 2's timeframe is "puberty", which is later than the "baby" stage.
    # Thus, Document 1 provides a more relevant context for the timeframe in Question 2.
    # Therefore, Document 1 is also the top-ranked document for Question 2.
