    "My plan is to solve this problem using logical deduction, which can be expressed through a simple Python script.\n\n1.  **Re-framing the Problem**: The condition that no queen attacks another queen applies to all queens on the board, regardless of their color. Therefore, placing `m` white queens and `m` black queens is equivalent to placing a total of `2 * m` queens on the board without any of them attacking each other.\n\n2.  **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**: On an N×N chessboard (in this case, 16×16), you can place at most N non-attacking queens. If you were to place N+1 queens, the Pigeonhole Principle dictates that at least two queens must occupy the same row, which would mean they attack each other.\n\n3.  **Setting up the Equation**: Based on the above, the maximum total number of non-attacking queens we can place on a 16×16 board is 16. Since the total number of queens is `2 * m`, the maximum value for `2 * m` must be 16.\n\n4.  **Solving for `m`**: The problem then simplifies to solving the equation `2 * m = 16`. The Python code below will formalize this reasoning and compute the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_max_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black queens\n    can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size_N = 16\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem.\")\n    print(\"The problem requires placing 'm' white queens and 'm' black queens on the board.\")\n    print(\"This means a total of 2 * m queens must be placed.\")\n    print(\"The key constraint is that no queen can attack any other queen, regardless of color.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Relate the problem to the N-Queens problem.\")\n    print(\"This setup is equivalent to placing 2 * m queens of a single color on the board without any attacks.\")\n    print(f\"On an {board_size_N}x{board_size_N} board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens you can place is {board_size_N}.\")\n    print(\"This is because if you place more than N queens (e.g., N+1), by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two queens must share the same row, causing an attack.\")\n    \n    max_total_queens = board_size_N\n    \n    print(f\"\\nStep 3: Formulate the equation.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum total number of queens is {max_total_queens}.\")\n    print(\"The total number of queens is also represented as 2 * m.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, we have the equation:\")\n    # Printing the numbers in the final equation\n    print(f\"2 * m = {max_total_queens}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Solve for m.\")\n    # In the equation 2 * m = 16\n    coefficient = 2\n    m = max_total_queens / coefficient\n    \n    print(f\"m = {max_total_queens} / {coefficient}\")\n    \n    # The result must be an integer\n    m = int(m)\n    print(f\"m = {m}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nConclusion: The maximum number m is {m}.\")\n\nsolve_max_queens()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
