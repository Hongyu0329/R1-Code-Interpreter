    This function correctly calculates and prints the first 100 Fibonacci numbers,

    It uses an iterative approach to avoid the infinite recursion or inefficiency issues
    of the original flawed "Caramel Sauce" recipe.

    The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as
    printing each number of the resulting sequence.
