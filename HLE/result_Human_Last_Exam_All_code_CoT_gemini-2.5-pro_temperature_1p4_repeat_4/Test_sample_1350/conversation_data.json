    "My plan is to first identify the character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who has direct experience with Roman culture. Then, I will recall or look up the specific chapter where this character discusses Roman history and mythology, specifically looking for a reference to a founding myth involving twins and a she-wolf, which corresponds to the story of Romulus and Remus. Finally, I will provide the character's name in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the character from\n    William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\" who describes the\n    Roman founding myth.\n    \"\"\"\n    character_name = \"Otter\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"In Chapter III, 'They Talk of the Romans', the character Otter, \"\n        \"a Goth who was captured and raised among the Romans before returning to his people, \"\n        \"describes Roman customs. He tells his kinsmen the story of the founding of the great \"\n        \"Roman city by twin brethren who were suckled by a she-wolf, which the reader \"\n        \"recognizes as the myth of Romulus and Remus.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The character is: {character_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nDetails:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<Otter>>>"
