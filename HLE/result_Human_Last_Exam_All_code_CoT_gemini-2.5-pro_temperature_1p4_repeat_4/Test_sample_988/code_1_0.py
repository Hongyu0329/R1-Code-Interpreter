    # Step 1: Explain the physiological basis of the stress response.
    explanation_intro = "High temperature stress disrupts metabolic balance in cyanobacteria, leading to the rapid overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) like the superoxide radical (O₂⁻) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). This causes oxidative stress."

    # Step 2: Detail the roles of different antioxidant systems.
    explanation_roles = "The cell's first and most immediate line of defense against a sudden burst of ROS is the enzymatic antioxidant system. Key enzymes include:"
    explanation_sod = "- Superoxide Dismutase (SOD): Rapidly converts superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide."
    explanation_cat = "- Catalase (CAT) and Peroxidases (APX): Quickly neutralize the hydrogen peroxide."
    explanation_conclusion = "This enzymatic cascade is considered the 'initial activation' because its catalytic activity can be ramped up almost instantly to manage the immediate threat. While other non-enzymatic antioxidants are essential, the enzymatic system provides the primary, rapid response."
