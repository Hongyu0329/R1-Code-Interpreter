# The user wants me to count the number of correct statements among the given options.

# Analysis of the statements:
# Statement A: Correct. The definition of segregation relies on an "order of appearance" of constants, which is not well-defined for Datalog programs (which are sets of rules). This makes the definition ambiguous.
# Statement B: Incorrect. The property gamma[gamma_inverse[P]] = P should hold because segregation replaces a constant c with c' from gamma_inverse(c), and by definition, gamma(c') = c. Aggregation reverses the process.
# Statement C: Correct. Aggregation (gamma) is potentially a many-to-one mapping, thus losing information. Applying segregation after aggregation (gamma_inverse[gamma[P]]) cannot perfectly recover the original program P in the general case.
# Statement D: Correct. This is a corollary of A. The ambiguous definition of segregation also applies to the set of facts S0, and this ambiguity could impact the result of the main claim.
# Statement E: Correct. This provides an accurate high-level interpretation of the main claim. It correctly frames the equation as stating that coarse-grained inference is complete with respect to the fine-grained path under the given conditions.

# Counting the number of correct statements.
correct_statements = ["A", "C", "D", "E"]
count = len(correct_statements)

# The final answer is the count of correct statements.
print(count)
