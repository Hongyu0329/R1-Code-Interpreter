# The problem is a theoretical question about topology and does not require a computational solution.
# The reasoning involves constructing a specific mathematical space and applying theorems from hyperspace theory.
# The user wants python or shell script code, so I will provide a conceptual python 'solution' that prints the answer and the logic.

    This function outlines the reasoning to find the smallest possible number of

    # Step 1: Analyze the properties of the space X.
    # X is an infinite, totally-disconnected ultrametric space.
    # An important theorem states that for any metric space X, the hyperspace CL(X)
    # (with the Wijsman topology) is connected if and only if X is connected.
    # Since X is totally disconnected, CL(X) is not connected.
    # Therefore, the number of connected components must be at least 2.
    min_components = 2

    # Step 2: Determine if 2 components is achievable.
    # We need to find an example of a space X for which CL(X) has exactly 2 components.
    # For many non-compact, proper metric spaces, CL(X) has two components:
    # 1. The collection of non-empty bounded closed sets.
    # 2. The collection of non-empty unbounded closed sets.
    # We construct an ultrametric space X with these properties.

    # Step 3: Construct the space X.
    # Let C be the Cantor set, which is a compact ultrametric space.
    # Let X be the disjoint union of a countable infinity of copies of the Cantor set, C_1, C_2, C_3, ...
    # Define a metric d on X:
    # - If x, y are in the same copy C_n, d(x,y) is the standard metric on the Cantor set (<= 1).
    # - If x is in C_n and y is in C_m (n != m), d(x,y) = n + m.
    # This space X is an infinite, totally-disconnected, unbounded, and locally compact ultrametric space.

    # Step 4: Conclude the number of components.
    # For this space X, the hyperspace CL(X) decomposes into two components:
    # the bounded closed subsets and the unbounded closed subsets.
    # An example of a bounded set is any closed subset of a single C_n.
    # An example of an unbounded set is a set containing one point from each C_n.
    # Thus, a space exists for which the number of components is 2.

    # Final result
    # Since the number of components is at least 2, and we have found a case where it is exactly 2,
    # the smallest possible number is 2.
