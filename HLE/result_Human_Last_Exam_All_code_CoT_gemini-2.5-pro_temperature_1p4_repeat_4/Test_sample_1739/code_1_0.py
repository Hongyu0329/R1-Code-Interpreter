# The user wants to calculate the 3rd term of the nonlinear correction
# to the linear oscillation frequency. Based on the analysis of the
# Rayleigh-Plesset equation, this is interpreted as the coefficient
# of the cubic term in the Taylor expansion of the restoring force F(R) = R^(-3*gamma) - 1.

# Let's define the symbolic variable for the polytropic index gamma.
gamma = sympy.Symbol('g')

# The coefficient of the cubic term in the expansion is given by the formula:
# Coeff = - (gamma * (3*gamma + 1) * (3*gamma + 2)) / 2

# Here are the numerical coefficients from the formula:
c0 = -1.0
c1 = 2.0
c2 = 3.0
c3 = 1.0
c4 = 3.0
c5 = 2.0

# We construct the expression for the term.
# Using symbolic math helps to represent the final formula clearly.
term_expression = (c0 / c1) * gamma * (c2 * gamma + c3) * (c4 * gamma + c5)

# The problem requests to output each number in the final equation.
# We will print the derived formula in a readable string format.
