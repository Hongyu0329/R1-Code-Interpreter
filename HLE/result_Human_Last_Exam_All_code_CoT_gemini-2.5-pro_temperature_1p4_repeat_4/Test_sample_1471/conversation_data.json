    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the equation, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Parse the Roman Numerals:** The first step is to convert the Roman numerals in the equation (VIII, CCC, and CCCI) into their modern integer equivalents.\n    *   VIII = 8\n    *   CCC = 300\n    *   CCCI = 301\n2.  **Formulate the Modern Equation:** After conversion, the equation becomes a standard arithmetic problem: 8 / 300 - 301.\n3.  **Calculate the Result:** Following the standard order of operations (division before subtraction), I will solve the equation.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that automates this process. The script will contain a function to convert Roman numerals to integers, apply it to the given numerals, perform the calculation, and print the full equation with the solution.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef roman_to_int(s):\n    \"\"\"Converts a Roman numeral string to an integer.\"\"\"\n    roman_map = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}\n    result = 0\n    prev_value = 0\n    # Iterate through the string from right to left for easier conversion logic\n    for char in reversed(s):\n        current_value = roman_map[char]\n        # If the current value is less than the previous one, it's a subtractive case (e.g., IV, IX)\n        if current_value < prev_value:\n            result -= current_value\n        else:\n            result += current_value\n        prev_value = current_value\n    return result\n\n# The Roman numerals from the original equation\nroman_numeral_1 = 'VIII'\nroman_numeral_2 = 'CCC'\nroman_numeral_3 = 'CCCI'\n\n# Convert each Roman numeral to its modern integer equivalent\nnum1 = roman_to_int(roman_numeral_1)\nnum2 = roman_to_int(roman_numeral_2)\nnum3 = roman_to_int(roman_numeral_3)\n\n# Perform the calculation\nsolution = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# Print the equation with modern numbers and the final result\nprint(f\"The equation with modern numbers is:\")\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {solution}\")\n```\n<<<-300.9733333333333>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
