# This problem is a conceptual chemistry question, not a calculation or data processing task.
# The user needs to identify a specific molecule based on chemical principles.
# No code is needed to solve this problem.
# The plan is to analyze the chemical reaction and deduce the key reactive intermediate
# that explains the difference in the experimental outcomes.

# Step 1: Identify the structural difference between the two probes.
probe_1_key_group = "4-hydroxyphenyl (a phenol)"
probe_2_key_group = "4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl (a benzyl alcohol)"

# Step 2: Consider the reaction conditions.
# The reaction is initiated by 417 nm light in the presence of a photosensitizer.
# This points to a photo-oxidation mechanism.

# Step 3: Evaluate the reactivity of the different functional groups.
# Phenols are readily oxidized by photosensitizers to form phenoxyl radicals.
# Benzyl alcohols are much less reactive under these conditions.

# Step 4: Conclude the identity of the key species.
# The high reactivity of Probe 1 is due to the efficient formation of a phenoxyl radical.
# The low reactivity of Probe 2 is due to the difficulty of oxidizing the benzyl alcohol group.
# Therefore, the phenoxyl radical is the molecule that leads to the observed difference.

# Step 5: Match the conclusion with the given answer choices.
# The species "phenoxyl radical" is listed as choice B.

answer_choice = "B"
reasoning = "The fluorescent difference arises because the first probe has a phenol group, which is easily photo-oxidized to a phenoxyl radical. This radical initiates the efficient labeling of proteins. The second probe has a benzyl alcohol group, which is not easily oxidized, leading to a much lower labeling efficiency. Therefore, the phenoxyl radical is the key species responsible for the difference."

print(f"The molecule that leads to the fluorescent difference is the {reasoning.split(',')[1].strip().split('which')[0].strip()}.")
print(f"This corresponds to answer choice B.")
