    "Based on my research, the premise of your question is incorrect. The former President of Nigeria's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name, and there are no public records of him ever identifying himself with that name. The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first President.\n\nTherefore, since the event never occurred, a year cannot be provided. I will provide a Python script to clarify this information.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_identity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the user's question about Goodluck Jonathan's name.\n    \"\"\"\n    correct_full_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    name_in_question = \"Azikiwe\"\n    associated_figure = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n    \n    print(f\"Searching for the year Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified as '{name_in_question}'...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Result of inquiry:\")\n    print(f\"The full name of the former president is {correct_full_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The name '{name_in_question}' is not part of his known name.\")\n    print(\"There is no public record of him ever identifying with the name 'Azikiwe'.\")\n    print(f\"This is likely a confusion with Nigeria's first president, {associated_figure}.\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: A year cannot be provided for an event that has not been recorded to have happened.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    check_name_identity()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe.
