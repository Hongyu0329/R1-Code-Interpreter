    "My plan is to calculate the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix A. I will use Python for this task.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Define the matrix A in the Python script.\n2.  Recall the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix: `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n3.  To satisfy the requirement of showing \"each number in the final equation\", I will break down the calculation.\n4.  The script will substitute the numerical values from matrix A into the formula and print this expression.\n5.  It will then calculate the intermediate products and the values of the 2x2 sub-determinants.\n6.  Finally, it will compute and print the final value of the determinant.\n\nThe information about the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is contextual background for the origin of the matrix, but the core task is the determinant calculation of the provided matrix A.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem is to compute the determinant of the matrix A.\n# The context about the Markov quiver and m_1/2 = 13 leads to this specific matrix,\n# but the calculation itself is a standard determinant problem.\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# For a 3x3 matrix [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]], the determinant is:\n# det = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\n# Extracting the elements for clarity\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Calculate the terms\nterm1 = a * (e * i - f * h)\nterm2 = -b * (d * i - f * g)\nterm3 = c * (d * h - e * g)\ndeterminant = term1 + term2 + term3\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation as requested\nprint(\"The matrix A is:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nThe determinant is calculated using the formula: det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values from matrix A into the formula:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the intermediate values:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * ({e*i - f*h}) - ({b}) * ({d*i - f*g}) + ({c}) * ({d*h - e*g})\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({term1}) + ({term2}) + ({term3})\")\n\nprint(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {determinant}\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
