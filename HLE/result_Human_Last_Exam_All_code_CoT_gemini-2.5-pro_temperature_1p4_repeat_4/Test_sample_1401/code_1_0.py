    """
    Calculates and explains the SQ lower bound for learning 2-layer ReLU networks.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of queries for an SQ algorithm to learn a 
    poly(d)-sized two-hidden-layer ReLU network over N(0,I) to squared loss 1/poly(d),
    with a non-negligible query tolerance.

    The theoretical lower bound for this problem is exponential in the dimension d. 
    This is because the task is at least as hard as learning a single "planted" 
    neuron, which is known to require exp(Ω(d)) queries for an SQ algorithm.
    """

    # The formula for the lower bound on the number of queries (Q) is:
    # Q >= exp(c * d)
    # where d is the input dimension and c is some positive constant.

    # For demonstration, let's use example values for d and c.
    d = 100  # Example dimension
    c = 0.1  # Example constant for the Omega notation Ω(d)
