    "To answer this question, I will write a Python script that searches through a predefined list of historical data.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start year, end year, and the name of an archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery for a specific period. This data is based on historical records.\n2.  The script will then iterate through this list.\n3.  For each entry, it will check if the target year, 1730, falls within the archimandrite's tenure (between the start and end year).\n4.  Once it finds the correct period, it will print the name of the corresponding archimandrite.\n\n```python\ndef find_archimandrite():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery for a specific year.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Historical data representing the tenures of the archimandrites.\n    # Each entry is a tuple: (start_year, end_year, name).\n    archimandrite_records = [\n        (1726, 1731, \"Markell\"),\n        (1731, 1732, \"Kirill\"),\n        (1732, 1745, \"Amvrosiy\"),\n        (1746, 1753, \"Veniamin\")\n    ]\n\n    # The period of interest is 1730-1731. We will search for the year 1730.\n    target_start_year = 1730\n    target_end_year = 1731\n\n    found_name = None\n    for start, end, name in archimandrite_records:\n        # Check if the target year is within the current record's range.\n        if start <= target_start_year < end:\n            found_name = name\n            break\n\n    if found_name:\n        # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n        # We will represent this by printing the years we searched for.\n        print(f\"Searching for the period: {target_start_year}-{target_end_year}\")\n        print(f\"The archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery during this time was: {found_name}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"No record found for the period {target_start_year}-{target_end_year}\")\n\nfind_archimandrite()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
