Based on its role in promoting T cell survival, persistence, and function, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit a significantly **increased** release of effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and GM-CSF) upon antigen stimulation when compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is because IL-15 fosters a more robust and functionally potent T cell population capable of a stronger response.
