    "Of course. I will solve this task using my coding skills. Here is my plan:\n\nI will derive the equilibrium properties of a photon gas (Bose case for light quanta) using the principle of maximum entropy. This principle, which stems from Boltzmann's work on statistical mechanics, is a cornerstone of large deviation theory and is formalized by theorems like Sanov's theorem. The core idea is that the equilibrium state of a system corresponds to the most probable macroscopic configuration, i.e., the one with the highest number of corresponding microscopic arrangements (microstates). Maximizing this number of microstates is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy.\n\nThe derivation will proceed as follows:\n1.  **Define System and Entropy**: I'll model the photons occupying discrete energy levels. The entropy `S` is given by `k_B * ln(Ω)`, where `Ω` is the number of ways to distribute `N_i` photons (bosons) among `g_i` available states in an energy level `ε_i`. I will use the established formula for `Ω` for bosons and apply Stirling's approximation to simplify `ln(Ω)`.\n2.  **Apply Constraints**: For a photon gas, the particle number is not conserved, but the total average energy is. I'll use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize the entropy `S` subject to a fixed total average energy `<u>`. The Lagrange multiplier, `β`, is physically identified with the inverse temperature (`1/(k_B*T)`).\n3.  **Symbolic Derivation**: I will use Python's `sympy` library to perform the symbolic mathematics. This includes differentiating the Lagrangian and solving for the equilibrium occupation number `<n_i> = <N_i>/g_i`.\n4.  **State Final Equations**: Using the derived expression for the equilibrium occupation number, I will then formulate and print the final equations for the mean energy `<u>` and the entropy `S` of the system at equilibrium.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the derivation and display the final equations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_bose_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and prints the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy\n    for a gas of light quanta (Bose case) using the principle of maximum entropy.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"Derivation of Equilibrium Properties for a Photon Gas (Bose case)\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"We use the principle of maximum entropy, a concept at the heart of\")\n    print(\"Boltzmann-Sanov and Chernoff large deviation theorems.\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium state is the one that maximizes the entropy S for a given mean energy U.\")\n    print(\"\\nFor bosons (like photons) in an energy level 'i' with energy epsilon_i,\")\n    print(\"the number of microstates Omega_i for N_i particles in g_i states is:\")\n    print(\"Omega_i = (N_i + g_i - 1)! / (N_i! * (g_i - 1)!)\")\n    print(\"The entropy is S_i = k_B * ln(Omega_i).
