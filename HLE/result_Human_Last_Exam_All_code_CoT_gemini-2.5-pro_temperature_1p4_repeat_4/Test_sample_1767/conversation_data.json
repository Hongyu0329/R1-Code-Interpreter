    "When two Chern insulators are joined together and the tunneling between them is not negligible, the resulting system can be treated as a single, larger topological system. The Chern number, being a topological invariant of the bulk electronic band structure, is an additive quantity in such cases.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the junction is simply the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual insulators.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate this:\n```python\n# The Chern number of the first insulator\nc1 = 1\n# The Chern number of the second insulator\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the combined system (the junction) is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the first insulator is: {c1}\")\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the second insulator is: {c2}\")\nprint(\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"Equation: {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
