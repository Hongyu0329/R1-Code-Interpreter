    "To determine which curve has \"good ordinary reduction\" above 2, we need to analyze the properties of each curve when reduced modulo primes `p > 2`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand \"Good Reduction above 2\"**: In the context of hyperelliptic curves of the form `z^2 = f(x)`, a curve has \"good reduction\" at a prime `p` if its reduction modulo `p` is a non-singular curve. This is true if `p` does not divide the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` (and `p` is not 2). \"Good reduction above 2\" means the curve has good reduction for all primes `p > 2`. This implies that the discriminant of `f(x)` must not be divisible by any odd prime. Therefore, the absolute value of the discriminant must be a power of 2.\n\n2.  **Calculate Discriminants**: For each of the five curves, we will calculate the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` on the right-hand side of the equation.\n\n3.  **Analyze Prime Factors**: We will find the prime factors of each discriminant. The curve whose discriminant's absolute value is a power of 2 is the one with good reduction for all odd primes.\n\nI will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform these calculations accurately. The script will iterate through each option, calculate its discriminant, and report the prime factors to identify the correct curve.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_curve_with_good_reduction_above_2():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies which of the given hyperelliptic curves has good reduction\n    for all primes p > 2.\n\n    A hyperelliptic curve z^2 = f(x) defined over the rational numbers has \"good reduction\"\n    at an odd prime p if the discriminant of the polynomial f(x) is not divisible by p.\n    \"Good reduction above 2\" means the curve has good reduction for all odd primes. This\n    is equivalent to stating that the prime factors of the discriminant's absolute value\n    must only consist of the number 2.\n\n    This script calculates the discriminant for each polynomial option and inspects its\n    prime factors to find the correct answer. The term \"ordinary\" is a more advanced\n    property, but in this context, the condition of good reduction is the key differentiator.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing hyperelliptic curves for good reduction above 2...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    x = sympy.symbols('x')\n\n    # Note: the expressions include all numbers as requested.\n    curves = {\n        \"A\": {\"expr_str\": \"z^2 = x**5 + 3\", \"poly\": x**5 + 3},\n        \"B\": {\"expr_str\": \"z^2 = x**5 - 1\", \"poly\": x**5 - 1},\n        \"C\": {\"expr_str\": \"z^2 = x**6 - 1\", \"poly\": x**6 - 1},\n        \"D\": {\"expr_str\": \"z^2 = 2*x**5 + 2*x**3 + 1\", \"poly\": 2*x**5 + 2*x**3 + 1},\n        \"E\": {\"expr_str\": \"z^2 = 4*x**5 + 4*x**3 + x**2 + 4*x\", \"poly\": 4*x**5 + 4*x**3 + x**2 + 4*x},\n    }\n\n    correct_answer_label = None\n\n    for label, data in curves.items():\n        poly = data[\"poly\"]\n        \n        # Output the full equation for each curve\n        print(f\"Curve {label}: {data['expr_str']}\")\n        \n        # Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial\n        disc = sympy.discriminant(poly, x)\n        print(f\"  Discriminant: {disc}\")\n\n        if disc == 0:\n            print(\"  Discriminant is 0.
