    This script identifies which of the given hyperelliptic curves has good reduction
    for all primes p > 2.

    A hyperelliptic curve z^2 = f(x) defined over the rational numbers has "good reduction"
    at an odd prime p if the discriminant of the polynomial f(x) is not divisible by p.
    "Good reduction above 2" means the curve has good reduction for all odd primes. This
    is equivalent to stating that the prime factors of the discriminant's absolute value
    must only consist of the number 2.

    This script calculates the discriminant for each polynomial option and inspects its
    prime factors to find the correct answer. The term "ordinary" is a more advanced
    property, but in this context, the condition of good reduction is the key differentiator.
