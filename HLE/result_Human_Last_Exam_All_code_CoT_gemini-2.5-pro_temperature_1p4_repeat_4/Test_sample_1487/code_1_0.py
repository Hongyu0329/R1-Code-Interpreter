# This script calculates the value of a mathematical expression based on properties of a functional in Hilbert space l_2.
# The key steps are calculating the norm of a vector 'alpha' and substituting it into the final expression.

# The value of the Basel problem sum: sum_{k=1 to inf} (1/k^2) = pi^2/6
basel_sum = math.pi**2 / 6

# Step 1: Calculate the denominator of the main expression, which is also the value of the sum_j=1^inf 1/(j+1)^2.
# This sum is equal to (pi^2/6) - 1.
denominator = basel_sum - 1

# Step 2: Calculate the norm squared of the vector 'alpha'.
# From the derivation, ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * ((pi^2/6) - 1).
norm_alpha_squared = 0.5 * denominator

# Step 3: Define the other components of the final expression.
numerator_coefficient = 2
constant_term = 10**15

print("We are calculating the expression: (2 * ||alpha||^2) / ((pi^2/6) - 1) + 10^15\n")

print("The values of each component in the final equation are:")
print(f"The numerator coefficient: {numerator_coefficient}")
print(f"The calculated value of ||alpha||^2: {norm_alpha_squared}")
print(f"The denominator's value, (pi^2/6 - 1): {denominator}")
print(f"The constant term: {constant_term}")

# Step 4: Assemble the equation with the calculated numerical values for printing.
print("\nThe final equation with these numbers is:")
print(f"({numerator_coefficient} * {norm_alpha_squared}) / {denominator} + {constant_term}")

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
# The expression simplifies to 1 + 10^15, so the result is exact despite using floating-point arithmetic.
result = (numerator_coefficient * norm_alpha_squared) / denominator + constant_term

print(f"\nThe final result of the expression is:")
# Use formatting to display the large number without scientific notation.
print(f"{result:.1f}")
