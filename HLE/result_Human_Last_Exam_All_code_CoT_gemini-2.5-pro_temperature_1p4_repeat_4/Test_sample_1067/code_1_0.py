# This script identifies the correct logical proposition that resolves the apparent contradiction.
# The contradiction is that the dog detected an intruder (P) but did not bark (¬Q),
# which violates the simple rule "If P, then Q".
# Choice C resolves this by introducing a condition (R: The dog was asleep) and
# modifying the rule to "(P and not R) implies Q".
# The logic then correctly deduces that if P and ¬Q are true, R must also be true.

# Define the propositions as used in the correct answer choice C
P = "The dog detects an intruder."
Q = "The dog barked."
R = "The dog was asleep."

# The chosen answer and its corresponding logical statement
chosen_answer = "C"
proposition = "[(P ∧ ¬R)→Q] ∧ (¬Q ∧ P),∴R"

# Print the final answer and the breakdown of the equation's components
