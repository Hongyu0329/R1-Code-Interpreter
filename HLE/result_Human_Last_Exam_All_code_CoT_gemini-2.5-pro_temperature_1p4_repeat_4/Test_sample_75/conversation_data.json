    "Based on StarCraft lore, the Second Great War began in the year 2500 and concluded in the year 2508.\n\nTo find the duration, we can subtract the start year from the end year. The result is an integer, so rounding it up does not change the value. The following Python script calculates and displays this duration.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the start and end years of the Second Great War\nstart_year = 2500\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The request is to round up the result. Since it's a whole number,\n# ceiling will return the same integer.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n# Print the final equation as requested\nprint(f\"The duration of the Second Great War is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"{end_year} - {start_year} = {final_duration}\")\nprint(f\"The war lasted for {final_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<8>>>"
