def solve_kb_completion():
    """
    This function contains the derived solution to the Knuth-Bendix completion problem.

    The derivation steps are as follows:

    Initial System (with assumed corrected precedence g<h<f):
    R1: f(g(x), h(x)) -> g(x)
    R2: f(y, y) -> g(h(y))
    R3: f(g(x), h(y)) -> h(x)

    Step 1: Find Critical Pair between R1 and R3.
    - Superposing f(g(x1), h(x1)) and f(g(x2), h(y2)) yields the critical pair (g(x), h(x)).
    - With the LPO g<h<f, we have h(x) > g(x).
    - This creates our first new rule.
    - New Rule R4: h(x) -> g(x)

    Step 2: Simplify the system using the new rule R4.
    - R1 simplifies to: f(g(x), g(x)) -> g(x)
    - R2 simplifies to: f(y, y) -> g(g(y))
    - R3 simplifies to: f(g(x), g(y)) -> g(x)
    - The simplified R1 is an instance of the simplified R3, so it is removed as redundant.
    - The updated rule set is now { f(y,y)->g(g(y)), f(g(x),g(y))->g(x), h(x)->g(x) }

    Step 3: Find Critical Pair between the simplified rules.
    - Superposing f(y,y) -> g(g(y)) and f(g(x),g(y)) -> g(x).
    - Unifying f(y1, y1) with f(g(x2), g(y2)) requires y1=g(x2) and y1=g(y2), which implies x2=y2.
    - This critical overlap on the term f(g(x),g(x)) yields the pair (g(g(g(x))), g(x)).
    - With the LPO, g(g(g(x))) > g(x) because g(x) is a subterm.
    - This creates our second new rule.
    - New Rule R5: g(g(g(x))) -> g(x)

    Step 4: Check for further critical pairs.
    - Further analysis shows that all other critical pairs, including those involving R5, are joinable (meaning they reduce to the same term). For example, the critical pair between f(g(x),g(y))->g(x) and R5 is joinable. The self-superposition of R5 also results in joinable pairs.
    - The algorithm terminates.

    Step 5: Order the added rules.
    - The added rules are R4: h(x) -> g(x) and R5: g(g(g(x))) -> g(x).
    - We must order them by their left-hand-side (LHS) using the LPO (g<h<f).
    - Comparing h(x) and g(g(g(x))): since h>g, h(x) is greater than g(g(g(x))).
    - Therefore, the rule with LHS g(g(g(x))) comes first.
