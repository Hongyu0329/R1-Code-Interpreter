    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will identify the specific information requested, which is the name of the fictional singer performing as a cardboard cutout in the \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" episode of the Homestar Runner series.\n\nNext, I will retrieve this information from my knowledge base about the series.\n\nFinally, I will create a simple Python script that assigns this name to a variable and then prints it to the console, as per your instructions.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know the name of the fictional singer who performs\n# as a cardboard cutout at the prom in \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n\n# The singer's name in the episode.\nsinger_name = \"Kaiser\"\n\n# Print the final answer to the user.\nprint(f\"The cardboard cutout of the fictional singer who performs at the Junior prom is: {singer_name}\")\n\n```\n<<<Kaiser>>>"
