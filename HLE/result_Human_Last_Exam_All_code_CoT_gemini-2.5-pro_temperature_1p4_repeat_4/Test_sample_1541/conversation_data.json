  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.\n\nThe teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board.

    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan:\n\nFirst, I will analyze the problem to find the most memory-efficient solution in the C programming language. The key idea is to avoid storing the entire input string. We can achieve this by reading the input character by character and using a \"counting sort\" approach, since the numbers are limited to only 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nI will then calculate the total memory in bytes (`m`) used by the variables in this highly-optimized C program. The calculation will be based on standard data type sizes (e.g., `int` is 4 bytes, `char` is 1 byte).\n\nFinally, as requested, I will provide a Python script that solves the problem. The script will read the input sum, sort the numbers, and print the rearranged sum.\n\n**Memory Analysis of the C Program**\n\nTo solve this problem with minimum memory, we should not store the entire input string (which could be up to 1000 bytes). Instead, we can process it one character at a time.\n\n1.  **Counting Array:** We need an array to count the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'. An integer array `counts[4]` or `counts[5]` is perfect for this. Since the number of terms can be up to 501 (e.g., a string of 1000 '1's and '+'s), the counts can exceed the capacity of a `char` or `short`. Thus, we must use `int`.\n    *   `int counts[4];` -> `4 * sizeof(int) = 4 * 4 = 16 bytes`.\n\n2.  **Input Character:** To read the input character by character, we can use `getchar()`. This function returns an `int` so it can represent all possible characters plus the special `EOF` (End Of File) value. Therefore, the variable holding its result must be an `int`.\n    *   `int c;` -> `sizeof(int) = 4 bytes`.\n\n3.  **Summand Reconstruction:** To print the sorted sum, we need to iterate through our counts. For example, print `counts[0]` ones, then `counts[1]` twos, and so on. To properly format the output with `+` signs, a flag is useful to track whether the number being printed is the first one. A boolean type is the most memory-efficient for a flag.\n    *   `bool is_first = true;` -> `sizeof(bool) = 1 byte`.\n\nAdding up the memory for these variables gives us the total:\nm = 16 (for counts) + 4 (for input character) + 1 (for flag) = **21 bytes**.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Read the entire line from standard input\ns = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n# The summands are separated by '+'. We can split the string by '+' to get a list of numbers.\n# Since the numbers are single digits '1', '2', '3', '4', sorting them as strings\n# is equivalent to sorting them as integers.\nsummands = s.split('+')\n\n# Sort the list of summands in non-decreasing order.\nsummands.sort()\n\n# Join the sorted summands back together with '+' and print the result.\n# The join method correctly handles printing each number in the final equation.\nprint('+'.join(summands))\n```\n<<<21>>>"
