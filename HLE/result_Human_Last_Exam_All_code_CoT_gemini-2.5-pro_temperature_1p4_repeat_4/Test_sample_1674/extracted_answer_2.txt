Yes, the theory will not hold. The reversal process is tailored to invert the transformation `T` of the random medium. When a birefringent plate `B` is added, the total transformation becomes `B * T`. Applying the old inverse `T_inv` to this new system results in the operation `T_inv * B * T`, which does not restore the original beam because the inverse operation is no longer matched to the forward operation.
