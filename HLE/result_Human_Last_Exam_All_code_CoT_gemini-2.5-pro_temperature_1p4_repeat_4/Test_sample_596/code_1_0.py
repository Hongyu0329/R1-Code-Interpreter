def solve_rooted_forests_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the number of higher dimensional rooted forests
    that fail to simplicially collapse onto the root for the standard
    triangulation of the real projective plane, interpreted from the problem statement.

    The number is given by the formula:
    NCF(X) = product_{i>=1} |Tor(H_i(X; Z))|^2
    where Tor(H_i) is the torsion subgroup of the i-th integer homology group.

    For the real projective plane (RP^2):
    - H_1(RP^2; Z) = Z_2 (the group of integers modulo 2). This has torsion.
    - Other homology groups are torsion-free (Z or 0).

    The only non-trivial factor in the product comes from H_1.
    The torsion subgroup of H_1 is Z_2 itself.
    The order of Z_2 is 2.
