    "Of course, I can help with that. First, I will find the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 from my historical knowledge base. Then, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints it in a clear, formatted sentence. The script will also display the individual digits of the year, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and prints the name of the judge of Bártfa\n    in the year 1461.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Storing the historical data in variables\n    year = 1461\n    city_name = \"Bártfa (now Bardejov)\"\n    judge_name = \"Mikuláš Bech\"\n\n    # Printing the answer in a full sentence\n    print(f\"The judge of {city_name} in {year} was {judge_name}.\")\n    \n    # As requested, printing the individual digits from the year in the query\n    year_string = str(year)\n    print(f\"The digits of the year {year} are: {year_string[0]}, {year_string[1]}, {year_string[2]}, {year_string[3]}\")\n\nfind_judge_of_bartfa()\n```\n<<<Mikuláš Bech>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Who was the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
