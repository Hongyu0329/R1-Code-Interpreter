    Analyzes the statements about Quaternion RoPE and determines which are true.
    
    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    - A: False. The inner product depends on (m-n), not |m-n|, because R_{n-m} is the conjugate of R_{m-n}, not equal.
    - B: False. Quaternion multiplication is not commutative, so in general (R_m*q)*(R_n*k) != (R_{m+p}*q)*(R_{n+p}*k).
    - C: True. The key property R_m * R_n = R_{m+n}, which allows for relative position encoding, only holds if the rotation axis `u` is constant for all positions.
    - D: False. The rotation R_m is parameterized by a single scalar position `m`, so it can only encode a 1D relative position, not a 3D one.
    - E: True. The rotation quaternion R_m is a unit quaternion (|R_m|=1). The norm of a product is the product of norms, so |R_m(v)| = |R_m|*|v| = |v|.
    - F: True. Quaternion multiplication is linear with respect to real scalar multiplication, so R_m * (αv) = α * (R_m * v).
    - G: True. The rotation is an orthogonal transformation, which preserves inner products. So, ⟨R_m(p), R_m(q)⟩ = ⟨p, q⟩. If ⟨p, q⟩=0, the property holds.
    - H: True. (R_m ∘ R_n)(v) = R_m * (R_n * v) = (R_m * R_n) * v. Since R_m and R_n share the same axis, they commute, and R_m * R_n = R_{m+n}.
    - J: True. Since R_m ∘ R_n = R_{m+n} and R_n ∘ R_m = R_{n+m}, the difference is the zero operator, which results in the zero quaternion. The zero quaternion has a zero real part, so it is purely imaginary.
    - K: False. The real part of R_p(v) is v_0*cos(pθ) - (v·u)*sin(pθ), which is not generally equal to v_0.
    - L: True. The matrix for left multiplication by a quaternion has the real part on the diagonal. Trace = 4 * Real(R_m) = 4*cos(mθ).
    - M: False. The commutator [R_m, R_n] is always zero because they share the same axis and thus commute. The statement "if and only if" makes it false.
    - N: False. As shown in E, |R_m(v)| is constant and equal to |v|. If |v|=1, the limit is 1, not 1/√2.
    
    The set of correct statements is {C, E, F, G, H, J, L}.
