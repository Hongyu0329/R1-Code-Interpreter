    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is most clearly seen in the frequency-momentum representation.\n\nFor example, the retarded Green's function, $G_0^R(\\omega, k)$, is given by the formula:\n\n$G_0^R(\\omega, k) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\omega$ is the energy (or frequency) of the particle.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy for a state with quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum).\n*   $\\eta$ is a small positive real number (an infinitesimal) that ensures causality by shifting the pole of the function slightly off the real axis.\n*   $i$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe key functional dependence is that the bare Green's function is inversely proportional to the difference between the particle's energy $\\omega$ and its characteristic single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$. It has a singularity (a pole) when $\\omega$ is very close to $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to demonstrate this relationship. The script will:\n1.  Define example values for $\\omega$, $\\epsilon_k$, and $\\eta$.\n2.  Substitute these values into the formula for $G_0^R$.\n3.  Print the equation with the numbers substituted in, as you requested.\n4.  Calculate and print the final complex value for $G_0^R$.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\n# 1. Define the parameters for the calculation.\n# We'll use example values for the frequency (omega), the single-particle energy (epsilon_k),\n# and the infinitesimal broadening term (eta).\nomega = 2.5  # Energy of the probe, in some arbitrary units\nepsilon_k = 2.0  # Single-particle energy eigenvalue\neta = 0.1  # A small positive constant for causality\n\n# 2. State the formula being used.\nprint(\"The retarded bare Green's function G_0 is a function of frequency ω and the single-particle energy ϵ_k:\")\nprint(\"G_0(ω, ϵ_k) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη)\\n\")\n\n# 3. Substitute the numerical values into the formula and print the step-by-step calculation.\nprint(\"For our chosen values:\")\nprint(f\"ω = {omega}\")\nprint(f\"ϵ_k = {epsilon_k}\")\nprint(f\"η = {eta}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The equation becomes:\")\n# Python uses 'j' for the imaginary unit, but we print 'i' for convention.\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / (({omega} - {epsilon_k}) + {eta}i)\")\n\n# 4. Perform the calculation.\n# The denominator is a complex number.\n# Python uses 'j' for the imaginary unit.\ndenominator_real = omega - epsilon_k\ndenominator_imag = eta\ndenominator = complex(denominator_real, denominator_imag)\n\n# Calculate G_0\nG0 = 1 / denominator\n\n# 5. Print the intermediate step and the final result.\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({denominator.real} + {denominator.imag}i)\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Result:\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = {G0}\")\nprint(f\"G_0 ≈ {G0.real:.4f} + ({G0.imag:.4f})i\")\n```\n<<<G_0^R(\\omega, k) = 1/(\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta)>>>"
