The analytical solution is an implicit equation relating the normalized density, $\tilde{\rho} = \rho/\rho_0$, and the normalized position, $\xi = x/L$:
$\ln\left[ \frac{(\tilde{\rho} - 1)^{1.5}}{\tilde{\rho}^{0.75} (2 - \tilde{\rho})^{0.75}} \right] = \xi + D$
where $D$ is a constant of integration determined by the location of the origin.
