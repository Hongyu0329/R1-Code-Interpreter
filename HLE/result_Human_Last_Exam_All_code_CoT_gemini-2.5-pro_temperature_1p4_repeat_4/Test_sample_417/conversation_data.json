    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify all chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The central core is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring substituted at the 1,3,5 positions. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n2.  **Effect of Symmetry:** Because of this C3 symmetry, the three large substituents (the triazolyl-methyl arms) are chemically equivalent to each other. Likewise, the three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are also chemically equivalent. This means we only need to count the number of distinct proton signals within a single repeating unit (one arm and one methyl group) to find the total number of signals.\n3.  **Analyze a Single Repeating Unit:** Let's count the unique proton environments in one of the three identical arms and its adjacent methyl group.\n    *   **Central Ring Methyl Group:** The three methyl groups (-CH3) at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent. They will produce a single signal.\n        *   Signals: 1\n    *   **Linker Methylene Group (-CH2-):** The three methylene groups linking the central ring to the indazole units are equivalent. However, the indazole unit is chiral. This makes the two protons on each CH2 group diastereotopic, meaning they are in different chemical environments and will produce two separate signals.\n        *   Signals: 2\n    *   **Indazole Unit Protons:** We now analyze the protons on one of the chiral `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole` units. This is a rigid, chiral structure derived from camphor. Due to the lack of free rotation and the inherent asymmetry, nearly all protons will be unique.\n        *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton (C3-H):** There is one proton on the heterocyclic pyrazole ring. It will give one signal.\n            *   Signals: 1\n        *   **Bridgehead Proton (C4-H):** There is one proton at one of the bridgehead carbons of the camphor-like skeleton. It will give one signal.\n            *   Signals: 1\n        *   **Bridgehead Methyl Group (C7-CH3):** There is a single methyl group on the other bridgehead carbon. It will produce one signal.\n            *   Signals: 1\n        *   **Gem-Dimethyl Group (C8-(CH3)2):** The two methyl groups on the C8 carbon are diastereotopic because of the overall chirality of the molecule. They will produce two distinct signals.\n            *   Signals: 2\n        *   **Ring Methylene Protons (C5-H2 and C6-H2):** There are two CH2 groups in the six-membered ring of the camphor skeleton. In each CH2 group, the two protons (exo and endo) are diastereotopic and will give separate signals. So, each CH2 group contributes two signals.\n            *   Signals from C5-H2: 2\n            *   Signals from C6-H2: 2\n4.  **Sum the Signals:** Now, we sum the number of signals from all unique proton environments.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this summation systematically.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule based on its structure and symmetry.\n    \n    The molecule is: 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n    \n    The logic is as follows:\n    1. The molecule has C3 symmetry, so we only need to analyze one of the three identical 'arms'.\n    2. We count the number of chemically non-equivalent proton environments in one arm and its associated methyl group on the central ring.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a description of the proton environment\n    # and the number of distinct NMR signals it produces.\n    signal_sources = [\n        (\"Central ring methyl groups (-CH3)\", 1),\n        (\"Linker methylene protons (-CH2-), diastereotopic\", 2),\n        (\"Pyrazole ring proton (C3-H)\", 1),\n        (\"Camphor skeleton bridgehead proton (C4-H)\", 1),\n        (\"Camphor skeleton bridgehead methyl group (C7-CH3)\", 1),\n        (\"Camphor skeleton gem-dimethyl protons (C8-Me2), diastereotopic\", 2),\n        (\"Camphor skeleton methylene protons (C5-H2), diastereotopic\", 2),\n        (\"Camphor skeleton methylene protons (C6-H2), diastereotopic\", 2)\n    ]\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of unique proton environments:\")\n    total_signals = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    for description, count in signal_sources:\n        print(f\"- {description}: {count} signal(s)\")\n        total_signals += count\n        equation_parts.append(str(count))\n        \n    print(\"\\nTotal number of expected peaks is the sum of signals from each unique environment.\")\n    equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"Calculation: {equation} = {total_signals}\")\n    \n    return total_signals\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_nmr_peaks()\n```\n<<<H>>>"
