    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Inputs**: The problem provides a polynomial `f` and a set of weights `(w_1, ..., w_5)` for the variables `(z_1, ..., z_5)`. The task is to compute the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n\n2.  **Verify Quasi-homogeneity and Find the Degree (d)**: A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous if every monomial term has the same weighted degree. I will calculate the degree for each term in the given polynomial using the provided weights.\n    *   `degree = a_1*w_1 + a_2*w_2 + ... + a_5*w_5` for a monomial `z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}...z_5^{a_5}`.\n    *   It's noted that one term in the polynomial seems to have a different degree, likely due to a typo. I will proceed by assuming the polynomial is meant to be quasi-homogeneous and use the degree shared by the majority of the terms.\n\n3.  **Check the Calabi-Yau Condition**: For a hypersurface singularity to be of Calabi-Yau type, its degree `d` must equal the sum of the weights `S = Σwᵢ`. I will calculate this sum and check if `d = S`.\n\n4.  **Apply the Invariant Formula**: For a singularity in `n` variables that is quasi-homogeneous, has an isolated critical point, and satisfies the Calabi-Yau condition, there's a direct formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant: `Invariant = n - 2`.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Answer**: Using the number of variables `n=5`, I will calculate the invariant and display the final equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the weights and the polynomial's monomials from the problem description.\n    # Weights for (z1, z2, z3, z4, z5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    num_variables = len(weights)\n\n    # Polynomial: 0 = z1^8z3 + z1^4z2^3z3 + z1z2^7 + z1z2z3z4z5 + z2z3^4 + z4^3z5 + z5^3\n    # Each tuple represents the exponents (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5) for a monomial.\n    monomials = [\n        (8, 0, 1, 0, 0),\n        (4, 3, 1, 0, 0),  # This term appears to have a different degree\n        (1, 7, 0, 0, 0),\n        (1, 1, 1, 1, 1),\n        (0, 1, 4, 0, 0),\n        (0, 0, 0, 3, 1),\n        (0, 0, 0, 0, 3)\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Verify the polynomial is quasi-homogeneous and determine its degree 'd'.\")\n    degrees = []\n    for i, mono in enumerate(monomials):\n        degree = sum(exp * w for exp, w in zip(mono, weights))\n        degrees.append(degree)\n        print(f\"  - Weighted degree of monomial {i+1} with exponents {mono}: {degree}\")\n    \n    unique_degrees = set(degrees)\n    if len(unique_degrees) > 1:\n        print(f\"\\nWarning: The polynomial is not perfectly quasi-homogeneous.
