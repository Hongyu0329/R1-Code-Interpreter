    "My plan is to identify the film based on the very specific scene described. The key elements are: an Oscar-nominated film, a character boarding a bus, saying \"Thank you,\" and this action sealing their fate. This sequence of events points directly to a pivotal scene in the 2015 film *Sicario*. In the film, the character Alejandro (played by Benicio Del Toro) identifies a corrupt police officer named Silvio by the polite way he says \"Gracias\" (\"Thank you\") as he and his son board a bus. This confirmation leads Alejandro to follow him, ultimately resulting in the character's death.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script that prints out the name of the film as the answer.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the answer to the user's film trivia question.\nmovie_title = \"Sicario\"\nprint(f\"The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying 'Thank you' while boarding a bus is '{movie_title}'.\")\n```\n<<<Sicario>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
