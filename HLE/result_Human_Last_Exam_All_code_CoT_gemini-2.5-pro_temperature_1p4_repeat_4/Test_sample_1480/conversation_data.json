    "To determine the rule activation level of a fuzzy set, we need to apply a t-norm operation to the membership degrees of the rule's antecedents. The problem provides two values: `Phi_k(x′)=0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. I will interpret these as the membership degrees for two antecedent parts of a single rule.\n\nThe rule activation level, or firing strength, is calculated by combining these membership degrees. A t-norm is a type of fuzzy logic operator used for this combination. The most common and standard t-norm is the `minimum` operator.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Store the two given membership values, 0.7 and 0.9, in variables.\n2.  Use the `min()` function to apply the minimum t-norm.\n3.  Print a clear statement showing the original numbers and the final calculated activation level.\n\n```python\n# The given membership values for the antecedents of the fuzzy rule.\n# Phi_k(x') is interpreted as the membership degree of the first antecedent.\nantecedent_1_membership = 0.7\n# μG_k_j(y_j) is interpreted as the membership degree of the second antecedent.\nantecedent_2_membership = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm operation is used to combine the antecedent memberships to find the\n# overall rule activation level. We will use the minimum t-norm, which is the\n# most common choice.\nrule_activation_level = min(antecedent_1_membership, antecedent_2_membership)\n\n# Display the final calculation and result.\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated by applying a t-norm to the antecedent membership degrees.\")\nprint(f\"Using the minimum t-norm, the equation is:\")\nprint(f\"min({antecedent_1_membership}, {antecedent_2_membership}) = {rule_activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
