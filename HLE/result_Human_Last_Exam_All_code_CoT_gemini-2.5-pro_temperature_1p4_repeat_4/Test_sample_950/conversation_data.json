    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the thinking process and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan to Solve the Problem\n\n1.  **Identify the Space:** The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. There is a diffeomorphism $G(k, n) \\cong G(n-k, n)$, so we can work with the simpler space $G(2, 5)$. This space is a compact, connected, non-orientable manifold of dimension $d = k(n-k) = 2(5-2) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Strategy:** We can find the rank of the torsion subgroup by relating the homology groups with different coefficients. The key tool is a formula derived from the Universal Coefficient Theorem, which connects integral homology, homology with $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients, and rational homology. The torsion of the integral cohomology of a real Grassmannian is exclusively 2-torsion (composed of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$).\n\n    The formula is:\n    $\\beta_i = b_i + t_i + t_{i-1}$\n\n    where:\n    *   $\\beta_i$ is the $i$-th Betti number with $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients, i.e., $\\beta_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}} H_i(G; \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   $b_i$ is the $i$-th Betti number with rational coefficients, which is the rank of the free part of the integral homology group $H_i(G; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   $t_i$ is the rank of the torsion subgroup of $H_i(G; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Calculate $\\beta_i$:** The $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ Betti numbers, $\\beta_i$, are determined by the number of Schubert cells of dimension $i$. For $G(2, 5)$, these are indexed by partitions $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ such that $3 \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge 0$. The dimension of a cell is $|\\lambda| = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate $b_i$:** The rational Betti numbers, $b_i$, are determined by the rational cohomology ring $H^*(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Q})$. This ring is generated by Pontryagin classes. For $G(2,5)$, this ring is known to be $\\mathbb{Q}[p_1]/(p_1^2)$, where $p_1$ is the first Pontryagin class of the tautological bundle, in degree 4.\n\n5.  **Calculate $t_i$:** With $\\beta_i$ and $b_i$ known, we can solve for the torsion ranks $t_i$ iteratively, starting with $t_{-1} = 0$.\n\n6.  **Find the Final Answer:** The question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral *cohomology* ring, $H^*(G; \\mathbb{Z})$. The Universal Coefficient Theorem implies that the rank of the torsion subgroup of $H^i(G; \\mathbb{Z})$ is equal to $t_{i-1}$. The total rank is the sum of these ranks over all degrees: $\\sum_{i=1}^{d+1} t_{i-1} = \\sum_{j=0}^{d} t_j$.\n\nThe following Python script implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Use the isomorphism G(3,5) ~ G(2,5). Let k=2, n=5. Dimension d = k(n-k) = 6.\n# 2. Find the mod 2 Betti numbers (beta_i) from Schubert cell counts.\n# 3. Find the rational Betti numbers (b_i) from the rational cohomology ring structure.\n# 4. Use the formula beta_i = b_i + t_i + t_{i-1} to compute the ranks of homology torsion (t_i).\n# 5.
