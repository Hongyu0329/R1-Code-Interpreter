    # In his 1900 dissertation, "Théorie de la Spéculation" (Theory of Speculation),
    # Louis Bachelier modeled the seemingly random fluctuations of stock prices.
    # He developed a mathematical model for this process, which is now known as a
    # stochastic process or random walk.

    # Bachelier discovered that the probability distribution of these price changes
    # over time followed the diffusion equation, which also describes how heat spreads.
    # This mathematical model is identical to the one used to describe the erratic,
    # random movement of microscopic particles suspended in a fluid (like pollen in water).

    # This physical phenomenon had been observed by botanist Robert Brown in 1827.
    # Bachelier's groundbreaking work was, in essence, the first mathematical
    # formalization of this process, five years before Albert Einstein's famous 1905 paper.
