    "Determining the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic performance is a complex task that relies on analyzing experimental data from scientific literature. A single, universally \"ideal\" ratio doesn't exist, as it often depends on the specific synthesis method, reaction conditions (temperature, pressure), and the desired outcome (e.g., conversion rate vs. selectivity).\n\nHere is my plan to answer your question using a computational approach:\n1.  I will create a Python script that simulates a database of experimental results compiled from various research papers.\n2.  This database will contain entries for different Ni/Ce atomic ratios and their measured catalytic performance for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS).\n3.  The script will then iterate through this data to programmatically find and report the Ni/Ce ratio that corresponds to the highest performance for each of the two reactions.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the optimal ratio and its corresponding performance value for both WGS and WS, demonstrating how one might analyze such a dataset.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\n\ndef find_optimal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a dataset of mock experimental results to find the\n    optimal Ni/Ce ratio for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Simulate a database of experimental findings.\n    # The 'performance' metric is arbitrary for demonstration purposes.\n    # For WGS, it could be 'CO Conversion % at 300Â°C'.\n    # For WS, it could be 'H2 production rate (mmol/g/h)'.\n    data_string = \"\"\"Reaction,Ni_Ce_Ratio,Performance,Source\nWGS,0.05,75.2,J.
