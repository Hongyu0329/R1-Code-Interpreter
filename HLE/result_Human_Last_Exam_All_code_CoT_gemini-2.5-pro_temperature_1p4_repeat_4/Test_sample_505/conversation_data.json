    "To solve this, we will use the property of planar surface codes where the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is equal to the number of \"holes\" or non-trivial boundaries created within the code.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Determine the number of logical qubits for a single patch of surface code with two holes. According to the rule, this is equal to the number of holes.\n2.  Since there are two separate and independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n3.  We will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\n# Number of separate surface code patches\nnum_patches = 2\n\n# Number of holes in each patch\nholes_per_patch = 2\n\n# For a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits is equal to the number of holes.\nqubits_per_patch = holes_per_patch\n\n# The total number of logical qubits is the sum of qubits from each independent patch.\ntotal_logical_qubits = qubits_per_patch * num_patches\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final equation.\nprint(f\"A single surface code patch with {holes_per_patch} holes can encode {qubits_per_patch} logical qubits.\")\nprint(f\"With {num_patches} such patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: {qubits_per_patch} + {qubits_per_patch} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
