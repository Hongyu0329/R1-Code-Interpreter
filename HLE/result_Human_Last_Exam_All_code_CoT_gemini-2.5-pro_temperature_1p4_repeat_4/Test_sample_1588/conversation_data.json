    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: The number of nonzero coefficients of order `n` in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is equivalent to the dimension of the `n`-th graded component of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements (usually denoted `X` and `Y`).\n2.  **Use Witt's Formula**: This dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula. For a free Lie algebra on `k` generators, the dimension of the `n`-th component is given by:\n    `dim(L_n(k)) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the order (in our case, `n = 10`).\n    *   `k` is the number of generators (in our case, `k = 2` for `X` and `Y`).\n    *   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n    *   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n3.  **Möbius Function `μ(d)`**: The Möbius function is defined as:\n    *   `μ(d) = 1` if `d` is a square-free positive integer with an even number of distinct prime factors.\n    *   `μ(d) = -1` if `d` is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of distinct prime factors.\n    *   `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations for `n=10` and `k=2`. The script will:\n    *   Find all divisors of 10.\n    *   Calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor `d`.\n    *   Calculate each term `μ(d) * 2^(10/d)` in the sum.\n    *   Print each component of the formula, the intermediate sum, and the final result, showing all the numbers involved in the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef moebius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Moebius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0  # n has a squared prime factor\n    return (-1)**len(factors) # (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef calculate_bch_coefficients(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order n for k generators\n    using Witt's formula and prints the calculation step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero BCH coefficients of order n={n} for k={k} generators is given by Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"  (1/{n}) * Σ_{{d|{n}}} μ(d) * {k}^({n}/d)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"The divisors 'd' of n={n} are: {divisors}\\n\")\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    sum_parts = []\n    \n    print(\"Calculating each term of the summation Σ μ(d) * k^(n/d):\")\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = moebius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        k_pow = k**power\n        term = mu_d * k_pow\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        print(f\"For d = {d}:\")\n        print(f\"  μ({d}) = {mu_d}\")\n        print(f\"  {k}^({n}/{d}) = {k}^{power} = {k_pow}\")\n        print(f\"  Term: μ({d}) * {k_pow} = {term}\")\n        sum_parts.append(str(term))\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The full summation is:\")\n    print(f\"  Σ μ(d) * k^(n/d) = {' + '.join(sum_parts).replace('+ -', '- ')}\")\n    print(f\"  Sum = {total_sum}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    print(\"Finally, the result is:\")\n    print(f\"  (1/{n}) * {total_sum} = {result}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThus, the number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is {result}.\")\n\n# Set parameters for the specific problem\norder_n = 10\ngenerators_k = 2\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_bch_coefficients(order_n, generators_k)\n\nprint(\"\\n<<<99>>>\")\n```"
