    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on them.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and count the edge squares.**\nAn 8x8 chessboard has a total of 64 squares. The edge squares are those on the first and last rows (ranks 1 and 8) and the first and last columns (files 'a' and 'h').\n*   Row 1 has 8 squares.\n*   Row 8 has 8 squares.\n*   Column 'a' has 8 squares (2 of which are corners, already counted in the rows). So, 6 new squares.\n*   Column 'h' has 8 squares (2 of which are corners, already counted in the rows). So, 6 new squares.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the goal and the rules of placement.**\nThe goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on these 28 edge squares so that no bishop attacks another. A bishop attacks any square along the two diagonals on which it sits. An important point is that bishops on white squares can never attack bishops on black squares, but for this problem, we can place bishops of any color.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.**\nThe maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an entire 8x8 board is a well-known chess puzzle result. The maximum is 14.\nThis means the maximum number of bishops we can place on the edge squares cannot exceed 14. Our goal is to see if it's possible to achieve this maximum of 14 by placing bishops *only* on the edge squares.\n\n**Step 4: Find a valid configuration for placing the maximum number of bishops on edge squares.**\nLet's try to place bishops on the squares of the outer columns, 'a' and 'h'. All 16 of these squares are edge squares.\n*   Squares on file 'a': {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8}\n*   Squares on file 'h': {h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, h8}\n\nNow, let's check for attacks. Bishops on the same file cannot attack each other. However, a bishop on file 'a' can attack a bishop on file 'h'.\nA bishop at (column, row) coordinates (1, `r1`) attacks a bishop at (8, `r2`) if the distance between the columns equals the distance between the rows.\n*   Distance between columns 'a' and 'h' is `8 - 1 = 7`.\n*   Therefore, an attack occurs if `abs(r1 - r2) = 7`.\n\nLet's find the attacking pairs:\n*   If `r1=1` and `r2=8`, `abs(1-8) = 7`. So, the bishop on **a1 attacks the bishop on h8**.\n*   If `r1=8` and `r2=1`, `abs(8-1) = 7`. So, the bishop on **a8 attacks the bishop on h1**.\nThere are no other pairs of rows on these files that have a difference of 7.\n\nTo create a non-attacking set, we must remove at least one bishop from each attacking pair. We can remove the bishops on h1 and h8.\nThis leaves us with the following set of squares:\n*   All 8 squares on file 'a': {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8}\n*   6 squares on file 'h': {h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7}\n\nThis configuration contains 8 + 6 = 14 bishops.\n*   Are they all on edge squares? Yes, all squares on files 'a' and 'h' are edge squares.\n*   Are they non-attacking? Yes, we have removed the attacking pairs.\n*   Is this the maximum possible? Yes, because we have achieved the theoretical maximum of 14 non-attacking bishops for the entire board.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the number of empty edge squares.**\nThe two players succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of bishops on the edge squares, which is 14.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28\n*   Number of placed bishops = 14\n*   Number of edge squares lacking bishops = Total edge squares - Number of placed bishops\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
