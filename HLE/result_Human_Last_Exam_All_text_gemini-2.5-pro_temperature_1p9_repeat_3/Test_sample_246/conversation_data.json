    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the fundamental group of the branched cover.**\nLet $X$ be the 4-manifold in question, which is the double branched cover of $S^4$ branched over the surface $S = S_{5,T}$, where $T$ is the trefoil knot.\nThe fundamental group of a double branched cover can be described using the fundamental group of the complement of the branch locus. Let $\\Pi = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S)$. There is a surjective homomorphism $\\phi: \\Pi \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$ that maps any loop representing a meridian of $S$ to the generator of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The fundamental group of the cover $X$ is the kernel of this homomorphism:\n$\\pi_1(X) = \\ker(\\phi)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the fundamental group of the complement of the branch locus.**\nThe branch locus $S$ is the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil knot $T$. Let $G_T = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus T)$ be the group of the trefoil knot. A standard presentation for $G_T$ is $\\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle$. The trefoil knot is a fibered knot. For a fibered knot $K$, a key result (due to Kanenobu, Litherland, and others) states that the fundamental group of the complement of its $m$-twist-spun knot, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S_{m,K})$, is isomorphic to the knot group $G_K$ itself.\nTherefore, for the 5-twist-spun trefoil, we have:\n$\\Pi = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S_{5,T}) \\cong G_T$.\n\n**Step 3: Define the homomorphism to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.**\nUnder the isomorphism $\\Pi \\cong G_T$, the meridian of the surface $S$ corresponds to a specific element in $G_T$. Various models for twist-spinning identify this meridian with elements like $\\mu^5$, $z\\mu^{-1}$, or $\\mu^{11}z^{-1}$, where $\\mu$ is a meridian of the trefoil $T$ and $z$ is the generator of the center of $G_T$.\n\nThe homomorphism $\\phi: G_T \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is determined by its action on the meridian of $S$. Let's analyze the image of these potential meridian elements under the abelianization map $\\psi: G_T \\to H_1(S^3 \\setminus T) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The abelianization $G_T^{ab}$ is obtained by adding the relation $[a,b]=1$ to the presentation of $G_T$, which gives $\\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3, ab=ba \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. A standard choice for the map $\\psi$ is $\\psi(a)=3$ and $\\psi(b)=2$. A meridian for the trefoil can be taken as $\\mu = ba^{-1}$, so $\\psi(\\mu) = \\psi(b)-\\psi(a) = 2-3 = -1$. The center generator $z=a^2=b^3$ maps to $\\psi(z)=2\\psi(a)=6$.\n\nLet's check the abelianization of the different candidates for the meridian of $S$:\n*   $\\psi(\\mu^5) = 5\\psi(\\mu) = -5$.\n*   $\\psi(z\\mu^{-1}) = \\psi(z)-\\psi(\\mu) = 6 - (-1) = 7$.\n*   $\\psi(\\mu^{11}z^{-1}) = 11\\psi(\\mu)-\\psi(z) = -11 - 6 = -17$.\n\nIn all cases, the image is an odd integer. The homomorphism $\\phi$ factors through the abelianization followed by reduction modulo 2: $\\phi(g) = \\psi(g) \\pmod 2$. Since the meridian of $S$ maps to an odd number, $\\phi$ maps it to $1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$. So, the kernel of $\\phi$ is the subgroup of $G_T$ consisting of elements whose abelianization is even:\n$\\pi_1(X) = K = \\{ g \\in G_T \\mid \\psi(g) \\text{ is even} \\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the minimal number of generators for $K = \\pi_1(X)$.**\nWe need to find $d(K)$, the minimal number of generators of the subgroup $K$. $K$ is a subgroup of index 2 in $G_T$.\nUsing the Reidemeister-Schreier method for the group $G_T = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2=b^3 \\rangle$ and the subgroup $K=\\psi^{-1}(2\\mathbb{Z})$, we can find generators for $K$. The cosets of $K$ in $G_T$ can be represented by $\\{1, a\\}$ since $\\psi(a)=3$ is odd. The Schreier generators are:\n*   $b$: $\\psi(b)=2$ is even, so $b \\in K$.\n*   $a^2$: $\\psi(a^2)=6$ is even, so $a^2 \\in K$.\n*   $aba^{-1}$: $\\psi(aba^{-1}) = \\psi(b) = 2$ is even, so $aba^{-1} \\in K$.\nA generating set for $K$ is $\\{b, a^2, aba^{-1}\\}$. Since $a^2=b^3$ in $G_T$, the generator $a^2$ is redundant (it equals $b^3$). So, $K$ is generated by $\\{b, aba^{-1}\\}$. This shows that $d(K) \\le 2$.\n\nTo find a lower bound on $d(K)$, we compute its abelianization, $H_1(K) = K/[K,K]$.\nA presentation for $K$ can be derived. The generators are $s_1 = b$ and $s_2 = aba^{-1}$. The relations for $G_T$, when written in terms of these generators, become the relations for $K$. The relation $a^2=b^3$ and its conjugate by $a$, $a(a^2b^{-3})a^{-1}=1 \\Rightarrow a^2=(aba^{-1})^3$, give the presentation:\n$K \\cong \\langle s_1, s_2 \\mid s_1^3 = s_2^3 \\rangle$.\n\nThe abelianization $K^{ab}$ is the abelian group with presentation $\\langle s_1, s_2 \\mid 3s_1 = 3s_2 \\rangle$. Let $u=s_1-s_2$ and $v=s_2$. This is a change of basis. The relation becomes $3(u+v) = 3v$, which simplifies to $3u=0$. The group is free abelian on generators $u,v$ with the relation $3u=0$, so $K^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ is 2.\n\nThe number of generators of a group is always greater than or equal to the number of generators of its abelianization:\n$d(K) \\ge d(K^{ab}) = d(\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) = 2$.\n\nSince we found that $d(K) \\le 2$ and $d(K) \\ge 2$, we can conclude that the minimal number of generators is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
