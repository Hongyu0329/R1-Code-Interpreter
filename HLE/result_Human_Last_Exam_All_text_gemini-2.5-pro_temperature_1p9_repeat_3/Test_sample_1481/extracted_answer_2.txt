The asymptotic behavior of the generating function H(s, s') in the limit as the arc-length separation |s' - s| → 0 is characterized by the following expansion:
H(s, s') = |s' - s| - (1/24)κ(s)²|s' - s|³ + O(|s' - s|⁵)
where κ(s) is the local curvature of the boundary at the point s. The leading-order term, |s' - s|, represents the arc-length approximation to the chord length. The first correction term, -(1/24)κ(s)²|s' - s|³, encapsulates the influence of the boundary's curvature, showing that the chord length is shorter than the arc length by an amount proportional to the square of the curvature and the cube of the separation distance.
