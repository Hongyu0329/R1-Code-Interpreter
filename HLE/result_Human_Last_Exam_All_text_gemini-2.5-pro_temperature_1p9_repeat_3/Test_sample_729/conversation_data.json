    "This problem asks for the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128. A \"power subgroup\" is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the Group Structure**\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $2^n$, denoted $Q_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n$Q_{2^n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{n-1}} = 1, x^{2^{n-2}} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nIn this problem, the group has size 128, so $128 = 2^7$. This means we are working with $Q_{2^7}$, so $n=7$.\nThe presentation for our group, $G = Q_{128}$, is:\n$G = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nThe elements of $G$ can be divided into two disjoint sets (excluding the identity):\n*   Elements in the cyclic subgroup generated by $x$: $\\{x^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 64\\}$. This set has 64 elements.\n*   Elements not in the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$: $\\{yx^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 64\\}$. This set also has 64 elements.\n\n**2. Strategy: Count Cyclic Subgroups Systematically**\nWe will find all cyclic subgroups by considering the two types of elements as generators. A cyclic subgroup is uniquely determined by its order and its generator(s). A common method is to count the number of elements of each possible order $d$ and then divide by $\\phi(d)$, Euler's totient function, to find the number of subgroups of order $d$. An alternative, and more direct approach for this group, is to classify the subgroups by their generators.\n\n**3. Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Powers of `x`**\nThese are the cyclic subgroups that are entirely contained within the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\nThe subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64.\nA fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that a cyclic group of order $m$ has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$.\nThe order of $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $m=64=2^6$. The divisors of 64 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\nThe number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1=7$.\nSo, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$. These are:\n*   $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{e\\}$ (order 1)\n*   $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n*   $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n*   $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n*   $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n*   $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n*   $\\langle x \\rangle$ (order 64)\n\n**4. Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Elements of the Form `yx^k`**\nNow, consider cyclic subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$. These generators must be of the form $g = yx^k$.\nLet's find the order of such an element:\n$g^2 = (yx^k)(yx^k) = y(x^k y)x^k = y(y x^{-k})x^k = y^2 x^{-k}x^k = y^2$\nFrom the group presentation, $y^2 = x^{32}$.\nSo, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\nTo find the order of $g$, we find the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $g^m=1$.\n$g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\nThe order of $g$ must divide 4.\n*   Order cannot be 1, because $yx^k=1$ implies $y = x^{-k}$, which is not true as $y \\notin \\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   Order cannot be 2, because $g^2=1$ implies $x^{32}=1$, which is not true in this group (order of $x$ is 64).\nTherefore, the order of any element of the form $yx^k$ is exactly **4**.\n\nThere are 64 such elements ($k=0, 1, \\dots, 63$), all of which have order 4. We need to find how many distinct cyclic subgroups they generate.\nA cyclic subgroup of order 4 is generated by its elements of order 4. Let $H_k = \\langle yx^k \\rangle$. The elements of order 4 in $H_k$ are $yx^k$ and $(yx^k)^3$.\n$(yx^k)^3 = (yx^k)^2 (yx^k) = x^{32} yx^k$.\nWe can check that $x^{32}$ commutes with $y$: $y^{-1}x^{32}y = (y^{-1}xy)^{32} = (x^{-1})^{32} = x^{-32} = x^{32}$. So $x^{32}y = yx^{32}$.\nTherefore, $(yx^k)^3 = yx^{32}x^k = yx^{k+32}$.\n\nTwo generators $yx^j$ and $yx^k$ generate the same subgroup if and only if $yx^j = yx^k$ or $yx^j = yx^{k+32}$. This implies $j \\equiv k \\pmod{64}$ or $j \\equiv k+32 \\pmod{64}$.\nThis means that for each $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 31\\}$, the pair of elements $\\{yx^k, yx^{k+32}\\}$ generate the same subgroup.\nSince there are 64 elements in total of the form $yx^k$, and they are paired up, they generate $64 / 2 = 32$ distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\n**5. Total Count**\nThe cyclic subgroups of $G$ are either contained in $\\langle x \\rangle$ or they are not.\n*   Number of cyclic subgroups in $\\langle x \\rangle$ = 7.\n*   Number of cyclic subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ = 32.\n\nThese two sets of subgroups are disjoint. A subgroup from the second set, like $\\langle yx^k \\rangle$, contains elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$, whereas all subgroups in the first set are entirely within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\nFinal Answer Check: A known formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in $Q_{2^n}$ (for $n \\ge 3$) is $n + 2^{n-2}$. For our group $Q_{128} = Q_{2^7}$, we have $n=7$.\nNumber of subgroups = $7 + 2^{7-2} = 7 + 2^5 = 7 + 32 = 39$. This confirms our detailed step-by-step analysis.\n\n<<<39>>>"
