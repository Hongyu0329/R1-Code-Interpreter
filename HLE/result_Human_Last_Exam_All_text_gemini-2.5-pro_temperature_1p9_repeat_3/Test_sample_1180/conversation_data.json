    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C$ defined by $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$ above 2.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the curve and the base field.**\n    The curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2, given by the equation $C: z^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$.\n    The base field is a 2-adic field, which we can take as $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2$, with a valuation $v$ normalized such that $v(2)=1$. The ring of integers is $R=\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and the residue field is $k=\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\n2.  **Locate the branch points of the curve.**\n    The branch points of the map $C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1_x$ are the roots of $f(x)=0$ and the point at infinity (since $\\deg(f)=5$ is odd).\n    We determine the valuations of the roots of $f(x)=2x^5+2x^3+1=0$ using the Newton polygon with respect to the valuation $v$. The polynomial coefficients are $a_5=2, a_3=2, a_0=1$. The points to plot are $(i, v(a_i))$: $(5,1)$, $(3,1)$, $(0,0)$.\n    The lower convex hull of these points is the single line segment connecting $(0,0)$ and $(5,1)$. The point $(3,1)$ lies on or above this segment, since for $x=3$ the line has height $y=1 \\cdot (3/5) = 3/5$, and $1 \\ge 3/5$.\n    The Newton polygon thus has one slope: $\\frac{1-0}{5-0} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n    The valuations of the roots are the negative of the slope. So, there are 5 roots, $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_5$, all having the same valuation $v(\\alpha_i) = -1/5$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the equation by a change of variables.**\n    The fact that all roots have the same non-integer valuation suggests that the curve has potentially good reduction. We need to extend the base field to \"un-cluster\" the roots.\n    Let $L=K(2^{1/5})$ be an extension of $K$. This is a totally ramified extension of degree 5. Let $\\pi = 2^{1/5}$ be a uniformizer for $L$, so that $v_L(\\pi)=1/5$ (if we keep $v_L$ normalized as an extension of $v$). Let's normalize the valuation on $L$ by $v_L(\\pi)=1$, so $v_L(2)=5$.\n    Let's change coordinates to move the roots into the valuation ring of $L$. Let $x = x'/\\pi$.\n    The curve equation becomes:\n    $z^2 = 2(x'/\\pi)^5 + 2(x'/\\pi)^3 + 1$\n    $z^2 = \\frac{2}{\\pi^5} (x')^5 + \\frac{2}{\\pi^3} (x')^3 + 1$\n    Since $2 = \\pi^5$, this simplifies to:\n    $z^2 = (x')^5 + \\pi^2(x')^3 + 1$.\n    Let's call this model $\\mathcal{C}_L$. The coefficients are now in the ring of integers $R_L$ of $L$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the reduction of the new model.**\n    The special fiber of $\\mathcal{C}_L$ over the residue field $k_L \\cong \\mathbb{F}_2$ is found by reducing the equation modulo $\\pi$:\n    $\\bar{z}^2 = (\\bar{x}')^5 + 1$.\n    In characteristic 2, this is $\\bar{z}^2 = (\\bar{x}'+1)(\\bar{x}'^4+\\bar{x}'^3+\\bar{x}'^2+\\bar{x}'+1)$.\n    This reduced curve is smooth in the affine part, but we found in thought process that it has a singularity at the point at infinity. The stable reduction is not necessarily good. The curve has potentially good reduction, and the stable reduction over $K$ is obtained as a quotient of the good reduction fiber over a Galois extension.\n\n5.  **Identify the nature of the stable reduction.**\n    The stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the clustering of its branch points.\n    The branch points of $z^2 = 2x^5+2x^3+1$ are the five roots $\\{\\alpha_i\\}$ and $\\{\\infty\\}$.\n    All five roots $\\alpha_i$ have $v(\\alpha_i) = -1/5$. This means they form a cluster. The point at infinity is separate. This partitions the branch points into two sets $S_1 = \\{\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_5\\}$ and $S_0 = \\{\\infty\\}$.\n    According to the theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves (due to Liu and others), a partition of the branch points into two sets $B_1, B_2$ of odd cardinality gives a stable reduction consisting of two components, $C_1$ and $C_2$, meeting transversally at a single point (a node).\n    The genera of the components are $g_1 = (|B_1|-1)/2$ and $g_2 = (|B_2|-1)/2$.\n    In our case, $|S_1|=5$ and $|S_0|=1$. So the stable model has two components:\n    *   $C_1$ with genus $g_1 = (5-1)/2 = 2$.\n    *   $C_0$ with genus $g_0 = (1-1)/2 = 0$.\n    These two components meet at a single double point.\n\n6.  **Calculate the thickness of the double point.**\n    The \"thickness\" of the double point connecting the components is a measure of the 2-adic distance between the corresponding clusters of branch points. Various (but related) definitions exist. In the context of tropical geometry and the dual graph of the stable fiber, the thickness is the length of the edge connecting the vertices corresponding to the components.\n    This length is determined by the valuation of the deformation parameter that distinguishes the curve from a simpler, more degenerate one.\n    In the model $z^2 = (x')^5 + \\pi^2(x')^3 + 1$, the term $\\pi^2(x')^3$ is a \"perturbation\" of the simpler model $z^2 = (x')^5+1$. The valuation of the coefficient of this perturbation term, $\\pi^2 = 2^{2/5}$, controls the geometry of the degeneration. The stable reduction process resolves the singularity at infinity, and the structure of this resolution is dictated by the valuation of $\\pi^2$.\n    The valuation of this coefficient is $v(\\pi^2) = v(2^{2/5}) = 2/5 \\cdot v(2) = 2/5 \\cdot 1 = 2/5$.\n    This value, $2/5$, represents the thickness of the double point in the stable reduction. It is a measure of how \"close\" the curve is to having a more degenerate reduction.\n\n### Careful points\n*   The genus of the curve is 2, not 3/2. This is from the formula $2g+1 = \\deg(f)$ when the degree is odd.\n*   The Newton polygon must be constructed carefully to determine the valuation of the roots.\n*   The change of variables to $x' = \\pi^{-1}x$ is key. It is essential to work over the appropriate field extension, which is $L = \\mathbb{Q}_2(2^{1/5})$.\n*   The concept of \"thickness\" is not universally defined but in this context, it relates to the metric properties of the dual graph of the stable reduction, which in turn are governed by the valuations of the key parameters in a good integral model of the curve.\n*   The partition of the branch points into two odd-cardinality sets correctly predicts a stable model with two components meeting at a single node. The thickness of this node is intrinsically linked to the valuation of the parameter that creates the singularity that needs to be resolved.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe curve $z^2 = 2x^5+2x^3+1$ is transformed by $x = 2^{-1/5}x'$ into $z^2=(x')^5+2^{2/5}(x')^3+1$. The stable reduction involves resolving a singularity at infinity for this model. The geometry of the resolution is determined by the coefficient $2^{2/5}$. The thickness of the resulting double point is the valuation of this coefficient.\n\nThickness $= v(2^{2/5}) = \\frac{2}{5} v(2) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 1 = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\n<<<2/5>>>"
