    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Product:** A single-dose container, specifically an ampule.\n    *   **Action:** Punctured (in the case of an ampule, this means broken open).\n    *   **Environment:** A sterile environment, which typically implies an ISO Class 5 environment or better (e.g., a laminar airflow workbench).\n    *   **Question:** What is the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for the container itself after this action?\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts and Governing Standards:**\n    *   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** This is the date and/or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) must not be used. The guidelines are set by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically in Chapter <797>.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container:** A container intended for single use for one patient. It typically lacks antimicrobial preservatives. Ampules and single-dose vials fall into this category.\n    *   **Ampule:** A sealed glass container that is broken at the neck to access the medication. A critical feature is that once it is opened, it cannot be resealed.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specifics of an Ampule:**\n    *   The defining characteristic of an ampule is that breaking it open creates an open system, directly exposing the sterile contents to the surrounding environment.\n    *   Unlike a vial with a rubber stopper that can be resealed by the elasticity of the rubber after a needle puncture, an ampule remains completely open.\n\n4.  **Apply USP <797> Guidelines:**\n    *   USP <797> provides rules for handling single-dose containers. It is important to distinguish between single-dose *vials* and single-dose *ampules*.\n    *   For a single-dose **vial** (with a rubber stopper), when punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, the contents may be used for up to **12 hours**. This is because the stopper provides a resealing barrier.\n    *   For an **ampule**, the situation is different. Because it cannot be resealed, its contents are continuously exposed to potential contamination once opened. Therefore, an opened ampule cannot be stored.\n    *   The contents of an opened ampule must be withdrawn immediately and used. Any medication left in the ampule must be discarded. It is not permissible to store an opened ampule for any length of time, not even for one hour.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ampule vs. Vial:** Do not confuse the rule for single-dose vials (up to 12 hours in an ISO 5 environment) with the rule for ampules. The physical inability to reseal an ampule is the critical factor.\n2.  **Definition of \"Use\":** The BUD applies to storage. For an opened ampule, there is no storage period. \"Immediate use\" is the correct principle. The drug should be drawn up into a syringe immediately.\n3.  **Disposition of Remainder:** Any unused medication in the ampule after the required dose is drawn must be discarded immediately. It cannot be saved for a later administration, even if that administration is within minutes.\n4.  **Environment is Not the Limiting Factor:** While the sterile environment is the best possible condition, it does not override the physical limitation of the open ampule. The risk of contamination in an open container is too high to permit storage.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBased on the physical characteristics of an ampule and established sterile compounding principles (USP <797>), once an ampule is broken open, its contents must be used immediately. The concept of a storage BUD does not apply to the opened ampule itself because it cannot be stored. Therefore, the medication must be withdrawn at once, and any unused portion must be discarded.\n\nThe Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule from the time of puncture (opening) is for **immediate use only**. The opened ampule must be discarded and cannot be stored for any period.\n\n<<<For immediate use only. The opened ampule and any remaining contents must be discarded and cannot be stored.>>>"
