The best replacement for the S-E-E-D sequence at positions 47-50 would be Alanine-Alanine-Alanine-Alanine (A-A-A-A). This is because replacing Serine (S) at position 47 with Alanine (A) creates a "phospho-dead" site, preventing the addition of a highly negative phosphate group. Replacing the negatively charged Glutamate (E) and Aspartate (D) residues at positions 48-50 with the small, uncharged Alanine effectively neutralizes the entire patch. This quadruple alanine mutant (S47A/E48A/E49A/D50A) is the most direct and clean experimental approach to eliminate the negative charge environment responsible for autoinhibition without introducing other significant chemical or structural changes.
