No. The second postulate is not superfluous and cannot be deduced from the first. Attempting to do so requires a hidden assumption that Maxwell's equations must be the invariant laws of physics, which was the very point of contention special relativity was created to solve. Postulate 1 alone allows for different models of spacetime (like Galilean relativity); Postulate 2 is the crucial, independent assertion that selects the correct model (Lorentzian relativity) by declaring the existence of a finite, universal invariant speed, which is the speed of light.
