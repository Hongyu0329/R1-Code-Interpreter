    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the notation of the 6-311G** basis set**\n\nThe notation `6-311G**` is a Pople-style basis set. To find the number of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs), we need to break down the name into its components and understand what each part signifies for different types of atoms.\n\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the core electrons of \"heavy atoms\" (any atom other than H or He). It means each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF) that is a sum of **6** PGFs.\n*   **`-311`**: This describes the valence electrons. It indicates a \"triple-split valence\" basis. The valence shell is described by three functions of varying spatial extent.\n    *   The \"inner\" part of the valence shell is a CGF composed of **3** PGFs.\n    *   The \"middle\" part is a CGF composed of **1** PGF.\n    *   The \"outer\" part is a CGF composed of **1** PGF.\n*   **`G`**: This simply stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of mathematical function used.\n*   **`**`**: These are polarization functions, which improve the description of chemical bonding by allowing for more flexible orbital shapes.\n    *   The first asterisk `*` applies to heavy atoms and adds a set of **d-type** polarization functions.\n    *   The second asterisk `*` applies to hydrogen atoms and adds a set of **p-type** polarization functions.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The number of PGFs is not a single value; it depends on the specific atom. Therefore, we must calculate the number for each type of atom separately (Hydrogen vs. heavy atoms).\n\n**Careful Point 2:** We need to count the *primitive* functions, not the *contracted* functions which are linear combinations of the primitives.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The number of functions in a polarization set depends on whether Cartesian or spherical harmonic Gaussians are used. The Pople basis sets, by convention in most computational chemistry programs (like Gaussian), use **6 Cartesian d-functions** and **3 Cartesian p-functions**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of PGFs for a Hydrogen atom (H)**\n\nHydrogen has no core electrons, so the `6-` part does not apply. Its single 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital.\n\n*   **Valence (1s orbital) from `-311`**:\n    *   Inner part: 3 PGFs\n    *   Middle part: 1 PGF\n    *   Outer part: 1 PGF\n    *   Total s-type PGFs = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5**\n\n*   **Polarization from the second `*`**:\n    *   This adds a set of p-type functions. A standard p-shell consists of three orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z).\n    *   These are uncontracted, so each is a single PGF.\n    *   Total p-type PGFs = **3**\n\n*   **Total for Hydrogen**: 5 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **8 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of PGFs for a 2nd-row heavy atom (e.g., Carbon, C)**\n\nA second-row heavy atom like Carbon has a 1s core orbital and 2s, 2p valence orbitals.\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital) from `6-`**:\n    *   The 1s core orbital is described by one CGF built from **6** s-type PGFs.\n\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals) from `-311`**:\n    *   For the 2s orbital: 3 (inner) + 1 (middle) + 1 (outer) = **5** s-type PGFs.\n    *   For the 2p shell (p_x, p_y, p_z): it receives the same `311` split. So, 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** p-type PGFs.\n\n*   **Polarization from the first `*`**:\n    *   This adds a set of d-type functions. A standard Cartesian d-shell has six functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   These are uncontracted, so each is a single PGF.\n    *   Total d-type PGFs = **6**.\n\n*   **Total for a 2nd-row heavy atom**: 6 (core s) + 5 (valence s) + 5 (valence p) + 6 (d-type) = **22 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussians in the 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom.\n\n*   For each **Hydrogen (H)** atom, there are **8** primitive Gaussians (5 s-type + 3 p-type).\n*   For each **second-row heavy atom (Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne)**, there are **22** primitive Gaussians (6 core s-type + 5 valence s-type + 5 valence p-type + 6 d-type).\n\nTherefore, to find the total number for a molecule, you would sum the counts for all atoms in the molecule. For example, for methane (CH₄), the total count would be 22 (for C) + 4 × 8 (for H) = 54 primitive Gaussians.\n\nThe question as stated is ambiguous and cannot be answered with a single number without specifying an atom or molecule. The answer is the rule for generating the basis set.\n\n<<<For a Hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians. For a second-row heavy atom (like Carbon or Oxygen), there are 22 primitive Gaussians.>>>"
