    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of how to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health in Expert Mode:**\n    The first step is to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode. This is the health value the boss has when there is only one player in the world. According to the game's data, the Eye of Cthulhu has **3,640 HP** in Expert Mode.\n\n2.  **Identify the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula:**\n    In Terraria, boss health increases in multiplayer to provide a challenge for multiple players. The scaling mechanic in Expert Mode is different from Normal Mode. For Expert Mode, boss health is increased by a specific percentage for each player present after the first.\n    The formula is:\n    `Final Health = Base Health × (1 + PlayerHealthBonus)`\n    Where `PlayerHealthBonus` is the sum of health modifiers from each player. In Expert Mode, the health modifier for each player after the first is **0.35** (or 35%).\n    So, for `P` number of players, the formula becomes:\n    `Final Health = Base Health × (1 + 0.35 × (P - 1))`\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to the Eye of Cthulhu:**\n    Now, we substitute the Eye of Cthulhu's Expert Mode base health into the formula:\n    `Health(P) = 3640 × (1 + 0.35 × (P - 1))`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Health Formula:**\n    To better understand how the health scales, we can simplify the equation:\n    *   `Health(P) = 3640 × (1 + 0.35P - 0.35)`\n    *   `Health(P) = 3640 × (0.65 + 0.35P)`\n    *   `Health(P) = (3640 × 0.65) + (3640 × 0.35P)`\n    *   `Health(P) = 2366 + 1274P`\n    This final equation shows that the Eye of Cthulhu's health is a linear function of the number of players (`P`). For every additional player, its health increases by a flat 1,274 HP.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Theoretical Maximum with an Infinite Number of Players:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an **infinite number of players**. This requires us to find the limit of the health function as `P` approaches infinity (`P → ∞`).\n    `limit as P→∞ of (2366 + 1274P)`\n    As the number of players (`P`) increases without bound, the term `1274P` also increases without bound. The constant `2366` becomes insignificant in comparison. Therefore, the function does not approach a specific maximum value; it grows infinitely large.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Mode-Specific Scaling:** It is crucial to use the Expert Mode scaling factor (35% per extra player) and not the Normal Mode (which has no per-player scaling) or Master Mode (which has a 50% factor) scaling.\n*   **Theoretical vs. Practical Limits:** The question is purely theoretical. In a real game, the number of players is limited by server software (e.g., to 8 or 255), and the health value would be limited by the maximum value of the data type used to store it (e.g., a 32-bit integer). However, the formula itself does not have a built-in cap.\n*   **Linear Growth:** The key insight is that the health scaling is linear. A linear function with a positive slope (in this case, `+1274` per player) will always tend towards infinity as its input tends towards infinity. There is no game mechanic mentioned in the source code that introduces a cap to this scaling formula.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the linear health scaling formula used in Terraria's Expert Mode, the health of the Eye of Cthulhu increases without any upper limit as the number of players increases. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health with an infinite number of players is infinite.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
