    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ (for $n \\ge 4$), denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    For this problem, the group size is 512, which is $2^9$. So, we are dealing with $SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$ where $n=9$.\n    The presentation is:\n    $SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The group consists of $2^{n-1}=256$ elements of the form $r^i$ (which form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle \\cong C_{256}$) and $256$ elements of the form $sr^i$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is equal to the set of $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$. That is, $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structure of k-th Powers in $SD_{512}$**\n\nTo determine when the set $G^k$ forms a subgroup, we analyze the structure of $k$-th powers. The exponent of the group is crucial here. The exponent of a group is the least common multiple of the orders of all its elements.\n*   The order of an element $r^i$ is $256 / \\gcd(i, 256)$. These orders are all powers of 2, up to 256.\n*   The order of an element $sr^i$ is either 2 or 4. Specifically, $(sr^i)^2 = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}} = r^{128i}$. If $i$ is even, $(sr^i)^2=1$. If $i$ is odd, $(sr^i)^2=r^{128}$, which has order 2, so $sr^i$ has order 4.\n*   The exponent of $SD_{512}$ is $\\text{lcm}(256, 4, 2) = 256$.\n\nWe can now analyze based on the parity of $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Case 1 - $k$ is an odd integer**\n\n*   When $k$ is odd, it is coprime to the exponent of the group, which is 256. So, $\\gcd(k, \\exp(G)) = \\gcd(k, 256) = 1$.\n*   A known theorem in group theory states that if $\\gcd(k, \\exp(G)) = 1$ for a finite group $G$, then the mapping $\\phi: g \\mapsto g^k$ is a permutation of the elements of $G$.\n*   This means that the set of $k$-th powers, $G^k$, is the same as the set of elements in $G$. Thus, $G^k = G$.\n*   Since $G$ itself is a subgroup, for any odd integer $k$, $G^k = G$ is a power subgroup.\n*   All odd values of $k$ result in the same power subgroup, namely $SD_{512}$ itself.\n*   This gives us **1** distinct power subgroup.\n\n**Step 4: Case 2 - $k$ is an even integer**\n\n*   Let $k$ be an even integer. We must compute the set $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. The elements $g$ are of the form $r^i$ or $sr^i$.\n    1.  For elements in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$: $(r^i)^k = r^{ik}$. As $i$ ranges from $0$ to $255$, this generates the subgroup $\\langle r^k \\rangle = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n    2.  For elements of the form $sr^i$: We first compute $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128i}$. Since $k$ is even, let $k=2m$. Then $(sr^i)^k = ((sr^i)^2)^m = (r^{128i})^m = r^{128im}$.\n*   The full set of $k$-th powers is the union of the sets from these two types of elements:\n    $G^k = \\{r^{ik} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{256} \\} \\cup \\{r^{128im} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{256} \\}$.\n*   As shown in Step 3, the first set is the subgroup $\\langle r^k \\rangle$. The second set is the subgroup generated by $r^{128m} = r^{64k}$, which is $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$.\n    $G^k = \\langle r^k \\rangle \\cup \\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$.\n*   For the union of two subgroups to be a subgroup, one must be contained within the other. The generator of $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$ is $r^{\\gcd(64k, 256)}$, and the generator of $\\langle r^k \\rangle$ is $r^{\\gcd(k, 256)}$. Since $\\gcd(k, 256)$ divides $\\gcd(64k, 256)$, it follows that $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle \\subseteq \\langle r^k \\rangle$.\n*   Therefore, the union is simply the larger subgroup: $G^k = \\langle r^k \\rangle$. This is a subgroup for any even $k$.\n*   We need to count how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way. The subgroups are of the form $\\langle r^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$ and $k$ is an even integer.\n*   Since $k$ is even, $d$ must be an even number. Also, $d$ must be a divisor of 256.\n*   The divisors of $256 = 2^8$ are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.\n*   The even divisors of 256 are $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\\}$.\n*   Each of these 8 values of $d$ gives a distinct subgroup. For any such $d$, we can simply choose $k=d$ (which is even) to obtain the subgroup $\\langle r^d \\rangle$.\n*   This gives us **8** distinct power subgroups: $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$, and $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup).\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\n\nWe combine the results from the two cases:\n*   From odd values of $k$, we found 1 power subgroup: $SD_{512}$ itself.\n*   From even values of $k$, we found 8 distinct power subgroups, which are all proper subgroups of $\\langle r \\rangle$ and therefore proper subgroups of $SD_{512}$.\n\nThe subgroup from the odd $k$ case ($SD_{512}$) is distinct from the 8 subgroups from the even $k$ cases.\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases: $1 + 8 = 9$."
