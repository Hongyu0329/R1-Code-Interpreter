    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the objects and the question**\n\n*   **C:** A compact Riemann surface (or smooth complex projective curve) of genus $g = 3$.\n*   **X:** The 15th symmetric power of C, denoted as $X = C^{(15)}$ or $Sym^{15}(C)$. This is the variety whose points are effective divisors of degree 15 on C. An effective divisor of degree 15 is a formal sum $D = P_1 + P_2 + \\dots + P_{15}$, where $P_i \\in C$ (points can be repeated). X is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi Group NS(X):** This is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. It is a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   **Rank of the Neron-Severi Group $\\rho(X)$:** This is the rank of the free part of the group NS(X), also known as the Picard number of X. We are asked to find the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(X)$, as C varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n### **Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi group of X to that of the Jacobian of C**\n\nA crucial tool for studying symmetric powers of a curve is the **Abel-Jacobi map**. For a fixed base point $P_0 \\in C$, the Abel-Jacobi map sends an effective divisor to a point in the Jacobian variety of C.\n\n*   **Jacobian Variety J(C):** The Jacobian $J(C)$ is a $g$-dimensional complex torus ($g=3$ here) that parameterizes degree 0 line bundles on C. It is a principally polarized abelian variety.\n*   **The map:** The Abel-Jacobi map $u: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$ is defined by $u(D) = [\\mathcal{O}_C(D - d \\cdot P_0)]$.\n\nThe geometry of $C^{(d)}$ depends on the relationship between the degree $d$ and the genus $g$.\n*   In our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$.\n*   A key result states that if $d \\ge 2g-1$, the symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ is a projective bundle over the Jacobian $J(C)$.\n*   Let's check the condition: $2g-1 = 2(3)-1 = 5$.\n*   Since $d=15 > 5$, the condition is satisfied. Specifically, $C^{(15)}$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{d-g} = \\mathbb{P}^{15-3} = \\mathbb{P}^{12}$ bundle over $J(C)$.\n\nWhen one variety is a projective bundle over another, their Neron-Severi groups are closely related. By the Leray-Hirsch theorem (applied to Chow groups or cohomology), the Neron-Severi group of the total space is generated by the pullback of the Neron-Severi group of the base and one \"new\" class (the relative hyperplane class).\n\nThis leads to a simple relationship between their ranks:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian J(C)**\n\nOur problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve C. The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ depends on the \"specialness\" of the curve C.\n\n*   **General Upper Bound:** For any complex abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$, its Picard number is bounded by the dimension of the space of Hodge classes of type (1,1). That is, $\\rho(A) \\le h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$.\n    *   For our Jacobian $J(C)$, the dimension is $g=3$.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum possible rank is $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: When is the rank minimized?**\n    The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ is related to the ring of endomorphisms of $J(C)$. For a **generic** curve C of genus $g$, its Jacobian has the smallest possible endomorphism ring, which is just multiplication by integers: $End(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    In this case, the Neron-Severi group (up to torsion) is generated by a single element, the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\n    Thus, for a generic curve C, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$. This is the minimum possible value.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: When is the rank maximized?**\n    The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ is maximized for very special curves C, whose Jacobians have **Complex Multiplication (CM)**. This means that the endomorphism ring $End(J(C))$ is larger than $\\mathbb{Z}$; it is an order in a CM field of degree $2g$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    The Hodge conjecture is known to be true for abelian varieties. It implies that every Hodge class on $J(C)$ is algebraic. This means that the upper bound $\\rho(J(C)) \\le g^2$ can be achieved.\n    There exist genus 3 curves whose Jacobians are of CM-type and have the maximum possible Picard number. For such a curve, we have $\\rho(J(C)) = g^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\n\nIn summary, for a genus 3 curve C:\n*   **Smallest rank:** $\\rho(J(C))_{min} = 1$ (for a generic curve).\n*   **Largest rank:** $\\rho(J(C))_{max} = g^2 = 9$ (for a specific CM curve).\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the final answer for X**\n\nWe combine the results from Step 2 and Step 3 using our key formula:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank of NS(X):**\n    $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    This occurs when C is a generic genus 3 curve.\n\n*   **Largest possible rank of NS(X):**\n    $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n    This occurs when C is a special genus 3 curve whose Jacobian has complex multiplication and achieves the maximum possible Picard number.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$ depends on the nature of the genus 3 curve C. For a generic curve, the rank is minimal. For a very special curve with complex multiplication, the rank is maximal.\n\n*   The smallest possible rank is 2.\n*   The largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
