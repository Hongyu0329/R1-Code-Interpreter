    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific physicist based on four key pieces of information:\n1.  The individual is a physicist.\n2.  They are primarily known for their contributions to microscopy.\n3.  They discovered an optical effect related to real imagery.\n4.  The discovery was inspired by an accidental observation made by a custodial worker (or a similar role) who was cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Clues**\n\n*   **\"Physicist better known for work in the microscopy field\"**: This narrows the search to figures who made significant contributions to the design and techniques of microscopes. Candidates could include Ernst Abbe, Frits Zernike, or Georges Nomarski.\n*   **\"Discovered an optical effect in real imagery\"**: This points to techniques that alter how an image is formed to reveal details that are otherwise invisible. Phase contrast, holography, and interference contrast are all examples of such effects.\n*   **\"Accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors\"**: This is the most specific and critical clue. It describes a particular story of discovery. We need to find which physicist's work is associated with this anecdote. A spherical grating, often used in spectrographs, acts as a concave mirror.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Clues to a Specific Physicist**\n\nLet's examine the candidates:\n*   Ernst Abbe and Frits Zernike made monumental contributions to microscopy, but their discovery stories do not involve a custodial worker and concave mirrors.\n*   The story of the custodial worker (sometimes retold as a laboratory technician) is famously associated with **Georges Nomarski**. The anecdote goes that a worker was cleaning a reflective spherical spectrograph grating (a type of concave mirror) and noticed that normally invisible fingerprints and smears became strikingly visible. When this was brought to the attention of Nomarski, he investigated the optical phenomenon.\n*   This observation led Nomarski to understand how subtle differences in the optical path (like those created by a thin smear) could be converted into visible changes in contrast. He then developed a special prism system to intentionally replicate this effect in a microscope.\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification**\n*   **Physicist?** Yes, Georges (Jerzy) Nomarski was a Polish physicist and optics expert.\n*   **Known for microscopy?** Yes, he is famous for developing Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy, a technique so closely associated with him that it is often simply called \"Nomarski microscopy\".\n*   **Optical effect in real imagery?** Yes, DIC is a powerful technique that enhances the contrast of unstained, transparent samples by creating a pseudo-3D relief effect in the final image.\n*   **Concave mirror and worker story?** Yes, this story is the specific inspiration for his invention.\n\nAll the points in the question converge on one individual.\n\n<<<Georges Nomarski>>>"
