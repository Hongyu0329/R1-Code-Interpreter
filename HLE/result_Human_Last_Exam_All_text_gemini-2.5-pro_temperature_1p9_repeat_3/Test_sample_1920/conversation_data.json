    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Conductor and Character Structure\nFirst, we factorize the conductor $d$:\n$d = 53599$\nLet's test small prime factors:\n$53599 / 7 = 7657$\n$7657 / 13 = 589$\n$589 / 19 = 31$\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 31$.\nSince $d$ is a product of distinct primes (i.e., it is square-free), any Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters modulo its prime factors:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$\nwhere $\\chi_1$ is a character mod 7, $\\chi_2$ is a character mod 13, $\\chi_3$ is a character mod 19, and $\\chi_4$ is a character mod 31.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Condition for a Primitive Character\nFor a character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_r$ with a square-free conductor $d=p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$, the character $\\chi$ is **primitive** if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i$.\nFor a character modulo a prime $p$, it is primitive if and only if it is not the principal (trivial) character. The principal character is the unique character of order 1.\nTherefore, for $\\chi$ to be primitive, each component character $\\chi_i$ must have an order greater than 1. Let $k_i = \\text{order}(\\chi_i)$, then the condition is $k_i > 1$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Order Condition\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{order}(\\chi_1), \\text{order}(\\chi_2), \\text{order}(\\chi_3), \\text{order}(\\chi_4)) = \\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6. So, we have the condition:\n$\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\nThis condition implies two things:\n1.  The order of each component, $k_i$, must be a divisor of 6. So $k_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n2.  To have an lcm of 6, the set of orders $\\{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4\\}$ must contain at least one order that is a multiple of 2, and at least one order that is a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Possible Orders for Component Characters\nThe order $k_i$ of a character $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ must divide the order of the multiplicative group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$.\nLet's check if the required orders (divisors of 6) are possible for each component:\n*   For $\\chi_1$ mod 7: The group order is $7-1=6$. Orders must divide 6. Divisors of 6 are possible.\n*   For $\\chi_2$ mod 13: The group order is $13-1=12$. Orders must divide 12. Divisors of 6 also divide 12. Possible.\n*   For $\\chi_3$ mod 19: The group order is $19-1=18$. Orders must divide 18. Divisors of 6 also divide 18. Possible.\n*   For $\\chi_4$ mod 31: The group order is $31-1=30$. Orders must divide 30. Divisors of 6 also divide 30. Possible.\n\nSo, for each component $i$, the order $k_i$ can indeed be any divisor of 6.\nThe number of characters of a specific order $k$ for a cyclic group of order $n$ (where $k|n$) is given by $\\phi(k)$. Since all groups $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ are cyclic and their orders are multiples of 6, this applies.\nNumber of characters of order $k$:\n*   $\\phi(1) = 1$ (the principal character)\n*   $\\phi(2) = 1$\n*   $\\phi(3) = 2$\n*   $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 2$\n\n### Step 5: Count the Valid Combinations\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ that satisfy both the primitive and order conditions.\nSummary of conditions on the orders $(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)$:\n1.  $k_i > 1$ for all $i=1,2,3,4$.\n2.  $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\nFrom these two conditions, each $k_i$ must be chosen from the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nWe will use a combinatorial approach based on complementary counting.\nFirst, let's count the total number of primitive characters whose order divides 6. This is the set of characters where each $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nFor each component $\\chi_i$, the number of choices is the sum of the number of characters of order 2, 3, or 6:\nNumber of choices for each $\\chi_i = \\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nSince there are 4 independent components, the total number of such character tuples is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, from this set of 625 characters, we must exclude those whose order is not exactly 6. Since all component orders divide 6, the lcm will also divide 6. The only way the order is not 6 is if it is a proper divisor of 6, i.e., 1, 2, or 3.\n*   The order cannot be 1, because that would require all $k_i=1$, which violates the primitive condition ($k_i > 1$).\n*   The order is 2: This occurs if and only if all $k_i$ are divisors of 2. Since $k_i>1$, this means $k_i=2$ for all $i$. The number of ways to choose such a tuple is $(\\phi(2))^4 = 1^4 = 1$.\n*   The order is 3: This occurs if and only if all $k_i$ are divisors of 3. Since $k_i>1$, this means $k_i=3$ for all $i$. The number of ways to choose such a tuple is $(\\phi(3))^4 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe set of characters with order 2 and the set of characters with order 3 are disjoint. So, the total number of characters from our pool of 625 that do not have order 6 is $1 + 16 = 17$.\n\nFinally, the number of primitive characters with conductor $d$ and order exactly 6 is:\nTotal characters with component orders in $\\{2,3,6\\}$ - (Characters with order 2) - (Characters with order 3)\nNumber = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
