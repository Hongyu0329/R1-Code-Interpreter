    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the conceptual entity mentioned in the question.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** The question centers on the historian Fernand Braudel.\n    *   **What:** Braudel quotes another person, Paul Morand.\n    *   **The Quote's Subject:** The quote is an assertion about a \"conceptual entity.\"\n    *   **Key Descriptors of the Entity:**\n        *   It is exemplified by the \"symbol of a nation.\"\n        *   It should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   **The Goal:** Identify this specific conceptual entity.\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:**\n    *   The first step is to find the specific text where Braudel quotes Morand. This famous quote appears in the preface to the first edition of Braudel's masterpiece, *The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II*. Braudel uses the quote to explain his ambition to move beyond a narrow, single-nation perspective and adopt a more holistic, global view.\n\n3.  **Examine the Exact Quote:**\n    *   Braudel, attributing the idea to Paul Morand, writes (with slight variations depending on the English translation):\n        > \"Every **national history** should be inscribed on a sphere in order to see all its aspects at once.\"\n    *   In this sentence, Braudel is directly stating what needs to be placed on a sphere to be properly understood.\n\n4.  **Identify the Conceptual Entity:**\n    *   The text explicitly identifies the entity as \"**national history**.\" This is the subject that needs to be viewed spherically, meaning it must be seen from all sides—in its geographical, economic, social, and political context, and in relation to all other histories happening simultaneously around the world.\n\n5.  **Reconcile with the Question's Phrasing:**\n    *   The question describes the entity as \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This aligns perfectly with the answer. \"National history\" is the history *of a nation*. The nation is the subject or symbol representing the specific history being studied.\n    *   The entity is \"conceptual\" because history itself is an intellectual construct, an interpretation of past events.\n    *   Therefore, the entity that should be \"inscribed within a sphere\" is **national history**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing between \"Nation\" and \"National History\":** It's crucial not to simply answer \"a nation.\" Braudel's point is not just about the nation as a static entity, but about its dynamic story through time—its history. It is the narrative and analysis of the nation's past that must be viewed holistically.\n*   **The Metaphor of the Sphere:** The sphere is a powerful metaphor for a global, interconnected perspective. Inscribing something on a sphere means you can turn it and see it from all angles simultaneously, understanding its relationship to everything else on the surface, which is Braudel's core methodological point.\n*   **Attribution:** While Braudel is the one who popularized this idea in a historical context, he is careful to attribute the original thought to Paul Morand, a writer and diplomat known for his travel writing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the quote from Fernand Braudel's work, the conceptual entity he argues should be inscribed within a sphere to be fully understood is national history.\n\n<<<national history>>>"
