    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n**1. Define Basic Combinators and Church Numerals**\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions of the core SKI combinators and Church numerals.\n*   **S x y z = x z (y z)**\n*   **K x y = x**\n*   **I x = x**\n*   A Church numeral `n`, denoted as `c_n`, is a function that takes two arguments, `f` and `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times: `c_n f x = f^n(x) = f(f(...f(x)...))`.\n\n**2. Analyze the High-Level Structure of the Expression**\n\nThe given expression is:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n\nLet's break this down into smaller, more manageable parts.\nLet `Φ = S(I)`. `Φ` is a combinator with the reduction rule `Φ x y = (S I) x y = I y (x y) = y (x y)`.\nThe expression can be written using `Φ`:\n`E = Φ(Φ(Φ(D)))(F)` where:\n*   `D = K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))`\n*   `F = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\nNow let's reduce the structure of `E`. The expression has the form `A B`, where `A = Φ(Φ(Φ(D)))` and `B = F`.\nApplying the rule for `Φ` repeatedly from the outside in:\n*   `Φ(Φ(Φ(D))) F` reduces to `F ( (Φ(Φ(D))) F )`\n*   The inner part `(Φ(Φ(D))) F` reduces to `F ( (Φ D) F )`\n*   The innermost part `(Φ D) F` reduces to `F (D F)`\n\nSubstituting these back, the entire expression `E` reduces to:\n`E = F(F(F(DF)))`\n\n**3. Identify and Evaluate D and F**\n\nWe need to figure out what `D` and `F` represent. They both contain the sub-expression `M = S(S(K(S))(K))`.\n\n*   **Analyzing M = S(S(K(S))(K))**: Let's see how `M` acts on a Church numeral `c_n`.\n    `M c_n f x = (S(S(KS)K) c_n) f x`\n    `= (S(KS)K f (c_n f)) x`\n    `= ( (KSf)(Kf) (c_n f) ) x` (This reduction is complex)\n    A more direct derivation shows that `M c_n f x = f(c_n f x) = f(f^n(x)) = f^(n+1)(x)`.\n    This means `M c_n` is equivalent to `c_{n+1}`. Therefore, `M` is the **Successor function (`SUCC`)**.\n\n*   **Evaluating F**:\n    `F = M (S(I)(I)) = SUCC (S(I)(I))`\n    For this to be meaningful, `S(I)(I)` should be a Church numeral. Let's test it:\n    `(S(I)I) f x = ((S I) I) f x`\n    First, `((S I) I) f` reduces to `(I f) (I f) = f (I f)`.\n    Then, `(f (I f)) x` reduces to `f ( (I f) x) = f (f x)`.\n    Since `f(f(x))` is the definition of `c_2 f x`, the combinator `S(I)(I)` represents the Church numeral `2` (`c_2`).\n    Therefore, `F = SUCC(c_2) = c_3`.\n\n*   **Evaluating D**:\n    `D = K (M I) = K (SUCC I)`\n    The identity combinator `I` is a valid representation for the Church numeral `1` (`c_1`), because `I f x = f x = f^1(x)`.\n    So, `SUCC I = SUCC c_1 = c_2`.\n    This makes `D = K(c_2)`.\n\n**4. Combine the Pieces and Evaluate the Final Expression**\n\nNow we substitute our findings for `D` and `F` back into the reduced expression for `E`:\n`E = F(F(F(DF)))`\n\nFirst, evaluate the innermost part, `DF`:\n`D F = (K c_2) c_3`. By the definition of `K`, this reduces to `c_2`.\n\nNow, substitute this result back into the expression for `E`:\n`E = c_3(c_3(c_3(c_2)))`\n\nThis expression represents repeated application of Church numerals. In combinatory logic and lambda calculus, the application of a Church numeral `c_e` to another Church numeral `c_b`, written `c_e c_b`, represents **exponentiation**, yielding a Church numeral for `b^e`.\n\nLet's evaluate the expression from the inside out:\n1.  `c_3(c_2)`: This corresponds to base `c_2` (number 2) and exponent `c_3` (number 3). The result is `c_{2^3} = c_8`.\n2.  `c_3(c_8)`: This corresponds to base `c_8` (number 8) and exponent `c_3` (number 3). The result is `c_{8^3} = c_{512}`.\n3.  `c_3(c_{512})`: This corresponds to base `c_{512}` (number 512) and exponent `c_3` (number 3). The result is `c_{512^3}`.\n\nSo, the Church numeral `n` represented by the entire expression is `512^3`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`n = 512^3`\nWe know that `512 = 2^9`.\nSo, `n = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9 * 3) = 2^27`.\n\nNow we can compute the logarithm:\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^27) = 27`.\n\n<<<27>>>"
