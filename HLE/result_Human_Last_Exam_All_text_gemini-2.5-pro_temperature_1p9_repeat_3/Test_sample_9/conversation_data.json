    "Answering this question requires identifying the topological space $X$ and then computing its first homology group.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Space X\nLet $X$ be the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n1.  **Lattice Representation:** A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis of two linearly independent vectors $(v_1, v_2)$. These vectors can be written as the columns of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M = (v_1|v_2)$. The condition that the lattice is nondegenerate means that $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent, so $\\det(M) \\neq 0$. Thus, the space of all possible bases for all nondegenerate lattices is the group $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n2.  **Unit Area Condition:** The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice $\\Lambda$ is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The condition of unit area restricts the representing matrices to the set $G = \\{M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) : |\\det(M)|=1\\}$. This set is a subgroup of $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and has two connected components: $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (where $\\det M=1$) and the set of matrices with determinant -1.\n\n3.  **The \"Moduli Space\" Identification:** Two bases $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(v'_1, v'_2)$, represented by matrices $M$ and $M'$, define the same lattice if and only if one basis can be obtained from the other by an integer linear transformation. This is equivalent to the condition $M' = MA$ for some matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the group of invertible integer matrices (which have determinant $\\pm 1$).\n    So, the space $X$ is the set of equivalence classes of matrices in $G$ under the right action of $\\Gamma = GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. That is, $X = G/GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Quotient Space:** Let's analyze this quotient $X = \\{M: |\\det M|=1\\} / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    Any matrix $M \\in G$ can be represented. Let's see if we can simplify this.\n    Let $[M]$ denote the equivalence class of $M$.\n    If $M \\in G$ has $\\det(M)=-1$, we can choose an element $A = \\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix} \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The matrix $M' = MA$ generates the same lattice. We have $\\det(M') = \\det(M)\\det(A) = (-1)(-1)=1$.\n    This means every equivalence class in $X$ has a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    Let's take two matrices $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. When are they equivalent in $X$? They are equivalent if $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    Therefore, the space $X$ can be described as the quotient of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ by the action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    $X = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n5.  **Relating to a More Common Space:** Let's define $X_0 = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This space is known as the moduli space of *oriented* lattices of unit area.\n    The group $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ can be written as a semidirect product $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$, where the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ group can be generated by a matrix of determinant -1, for example $\\gamma = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}$.\n    So, $X = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = (SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})) / \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    This means $X$ is the quotient of $X_0$ by the involution $\\tau: X_0 \\to X_0$ defined by $\\tau([M]) = [M\\gamma]$.\n\n### Step 2: Homology Calculation\n\nWe need to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. We can achieve this by studying the homology of $X_0$ and the effect of the involution $\\tau$.\n\n1.  **Homology of $X_0$:** The space $X_0 = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a well-studied object. It can be viewed as a Seifert fibered space. The fundamental group $\\pi_1(X_0)$ fits into a short exact sequence derived from the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the covering $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to X_0$:\n    $$1 \\to \\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\to \\pi_1(X_0) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$$\n    Since $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is homotopy equivalent to $SO(2) \\cong S^1$, its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. So we have:\n    $$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(X_0) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$$\n    This is an extension of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$. It is known that this is the universal central extension of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The abelianization of $\\pi_1(X_0)$ gives $H_1(X_0, \\mathbb{Z})$. A known result, which is non-trivial to derive, is that $H_1(X_0, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Alternatively, using more advanced results relating manifold topology and knot theory, $X_0$ is homotopy equivalent to the complement of the trefoil knot in $S^3$, whose first homology is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n2.  **Action of the Involution:** Now we consider the involution $\\tau$ on $X_0$ and its induced action $\\tau_*$ on $H_1(X_0, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The involution is multiplication on the right by $\\gamma = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}$. Geometrically, this operation reverses the orientation of the lattice basis vectors in the plane.\n    The generator of $H_1(X_0, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ comes from the generator of $\\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, which is represented by the loop of rotations in $SO(2)$. An orientation-reversing map on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ sends a rotation by $\\theta$ to a rotation by $-\\theta$. Therefore, the induced action of $\\tau_*$ on $H_1(X_0, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ is multiplication by $-1$.\n\n3.  **Homology of the Quotient:** We want to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(X_0/\\tau, \\mathbb{Z})$. For a quotient by a finite group action, there is a relationship between the homology of the original space and the quotient space. In particular, we can use the concept of coinvariants.\n    For a group $G$ acting on an abelian group $A$, the group of coinvariants is $A_G = A / I_G A$, where $I_G A$ is the subgroup generated by elements of the form $g \\cdot a - a$ for all $g \\in G, a \\in A$.\n    In our case, $G = \\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{e, \\tau\\}$ and $A=H_1(X_0, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The action of $\\tau$ is $\\tau(n) = -n$. The subgroup $I_G A$ is generated by elements of the form $\\tau(n) - n = -n - n = -2n$. So, $I_G A = 2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    The coinvariants are $H_1(X_0)_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} = \\mathbb{Z} / 2\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    For \"sufficiently nice\" spaces and actions (which holds here, as the fixed-point set has codimension at least 2), the low-dimensional homology of the quotient can be computed from the coinvariants.\n    The relevant part of the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence (or Mayer-Vietoris for the quotient) gives $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(X_0, \\mathbb{Z})_{\\mathbb{Z}_2}$.\n    Thus, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n*   The identification of the space $X$ with $SL(2,\\mathbb{R}) / GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ is robust.\n*   The reduction to $X = (SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}))/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is correct.\n*   The homology group $H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}))$ is a known, standard result, which is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The action of the orientation-reversing involution on this group is multiplication by $-1$.\n*   The first homology group of the quotient is the group of coinvariants, which is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe entire analysis stands.\n\nFinal answer: The first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is the cyclic group of order 2."
