    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the given Wittig reaction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and their structures.**\n\nThe reaction is a Wittig reaction between two compounds:\n1.  **Pivalaldehyde**: The common name for 2,2-dimethylpropanal. The \"pivaloyl\" group corresponds to a *tert*-butyl group attached to a carbonyl. As an aldehyde, the carbonyl carbon is also bonded to a hydrogen.\n    *   Structure: `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`\n    *   This provides the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part of the final alkene.\n\n2.  **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane**: This is the phosphorus ylide, or Wittig reagent. Let's break down the name to determine its structure.\n    *   \"triphenyl-λ5-phosphane\" indicates a pentavalent phosphorus atom bonded to three phenyl groups (`Ph₃P=`).\n    *   The group attached to the phosphorus via a double bond is `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)`. While the name might seem complex, it can be interpreted systematically. The \"ethyl\" part is a two-carbon chain. It is substituted at position 2 by a `2-chlorophenyl` group. The \"idene\" suffix indicates it's attached to the phosphorus via a double bond from position 1.\n    *   The `2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl` group is `(2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH₂-`.\n    *   Attaching this to `Ph₃P=` via a double bond at the terminal carbon (C1) gives the ylide structure `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)`.\n    *   This provides the `=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)` part of the final alkene.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Wittig Reaction Mechanism.**\n\nThe Wittig reaction involves the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a phosphorus ylide to form an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide. The carbonyl oxygen (`=O`) of the aldehyde is replaced by the carbanionic carbon (`=C...`) of the ylide.\n\n`R₁R₂C=O + Ph₃P=CR₃R₄  →  R₁R₂C=CR₃R₄ + Ph₃P=O`\n\nIn our specific case:\n` (CH₃)₃C-CH=O  +  Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)  →  (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄) + Ph₃P=O`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product.**\n\nThe stereochemistry (E/Z isomerism) of the newly formed double bond depends on the stability of the ylide.\n*   **Stabilized ylides** (where the carbanion is stabilized by an adjacent electron-withdrawing group like `-C=O`, `-CN`) typically yield the **E-alkene** (trans).\n*   **Non-stabilized ylides** (where the carbanion is attached to hydrogen or alkyl groups) typically yield the **Z-alkene** (cis) as the major product, especially under salt-free conditions.\n\nLet's classify our ylide: `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)`. The ylide carbon (`=CH-`) is bonded to a hydrogen and an alkyl-type group (`-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)`). There are no electron-withdrawing groups directly attached to the ylide carbon to stabilize the negative charge via resonance. Therefore, this is a **non-stabilized ylide**. As a result, the reaction will predominantly form the **Z-isomer** of the alkene.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product Structure and Name.**\n\nThe product is an alkene with the structure `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)`. Now, we need to name it according to IUPAC nomenclature.\n\n1.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond**: The chain is 5 carbons long: `C(CH₃)₃ - CH = CH - CH₂ - C₆H₄Cl`. So, the parent name is **pentene**.\n2.  **Number the chain**: To give the double bond the lowest possible locant (position number), we number from the right (the end closer to the phenyl ring).\n    ` (CH₃)₃C(4)-C(3)H=C(2)H-C(1)H₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)`\n    This numbering places the double bond starting at C2, so it's a **pent-2-ene**.\n3.  **Identify and name the substituents**:\n    *   At C1: A `2-chlorophenyl` group.\n    *   At C4: Two `methyl` groups.\n4.  **Assemble the name (without stereochemistry)**: `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n5.  **Assign stereochemistry (E/Z)**: We need to assign priorities to the groups on each carbon of the double bond (C2 and C3) using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    *   **On C2**: The groups are `H` and `-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)`. The `-CH₂-` group has a higher atomic number than `H`, so it has higher priority.\n    *   **On C3**: The groups are `H` and `-C(CH₃)₃` (*tert*-butyl). The *tert*-butyl group has higher priority than `H`.\n    *   As determined in Step 3, the major product is the **Z-isomer**, where the two high-priority groups (`-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)` and `-C(CH₃)₃`) are on the **same side** of the double bond.\n6.  **Final Product Name**: Combining all parts, the final name of the major product is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane yields an alkene. The ylide is non-stabilized, leading primarily to the Z-isomer of the product. The IUPAC name of this product is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
