    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Historical Figures and Context:**\n    *   **Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟):** A key commander of the Ming Dynasty forces during their occupation of Vietnam in the early 15th century (known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination).\n    *   **Event:** His \"first major defeat\". This points to a significant battle where his forces were decisively beaten, marking a turning point or a catastrophic failure for his specific command, rather than a minor skirmish or a stalemate.\n    *   **Location:** The battle site needs to be mapped to a current province in Vietnam.\n\n2.  **Examine Mu Sheng's Campaigns in Vietnam:**\n    *   Mu Sheng was involved in the Ming-Hồ War (1406-1407), which was a Ming victory.\n    *   Later, he was heavily involved in the campaigns against the Lam Sơn Uprising, led by the Vietnamese hero Lê Lợi. This is the period where his major defeats would have occurred.\n    *   The decisive phase of the war was in 1426-1427. The Ming court sent two large relief armies to break the Vietnamese siege of the main Ming fortress at Dongguan (modern-day Hanoi). This final campaign is the most likely source for Mu Sheng's major defeat.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final Campaign of 1427:**\n    *   The Ming plan involved a pincer movement with two armies:\n        *   An army from Guangxi, led by General Liu Sheng (柳升), would advance through the northeastern passes.\n        *   An army from Yunnan, led by **General Mu Sheng**, would advance from the northwest, down the Red River or Gam River valley.\n    *   General Liu Sheng's army was ambushed and completely destroyed at the Battle of Chi Lăng. This famous battle took place in modern **Lạng Sơn Province**. This was a massive Ming defeat, but it was Liu Sheng's army, not Mu Sheng's. This is a crucial distinction.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Specific Defeat:**\n    *   Mu Sheng's army advanced down the Gam River and reached what is now Tuyên Quang.\n    *   Upon receiving news of Liu Sheng's total annihilation at Chi Lăng, panic spread through Mu Sheng's ranks. He abandoned his advance and ordered a hasty retreat back to Yunnan.\n    *   The Vietnamese forces, under the command of generals like Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, seized the opportunity. They pursued Mu Sheng's retreating army.\n    *   The Vietnamese caught up with the disorganized Ming forces and inflicted a crushing defeat on them at **Lãnh Câu (冷溝) and Đan Xá (丹舍)**. Mu Sheng himself barely escaped, but his army was routed, losing tens of thousands of men and vast quantities of supplies. This was unequivocally his first truly catastrophic and personal defeat of the war.\n\n5.  **Identify the Modern Location:**\n    *   Historical records and geographical analysis place the sites of the battles of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá, where Mu Sheng's army was defeated during its retreat, within the territory of modern-day **Tuyên Quang Province**. The campaign and retreat followed the course of the Gam River (Sông Gâm), which flows through this province.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Don't confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with Liu Sheng's defeat.** Liu Sheng was defeated at Chi Lăng (Lạng Sơn Province). Mu Sheng was defeated later while retreating through a different region.\n*   **Defining \"Major Defeat\":** While Mu Sheng's forces faced setbacks prior to 1427, the battle at Lãnh Câu-Đan Xá was a large-scale, strategic disaster that resulted in the routing of his entire army and was part of the campaign that ended the Ming occupation of Vietnam. It is widely considered his primary major defeat.\n*   **Geographical Accuracy:** The path of the army from Yunnan followed the major river valleys. The Gam River valley in Tuyên Quang Province was the site of both his advance and his subsequent disastrous retreat and defeat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMing General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred in 1427 when his retreating army was routed by Vietnamese forces at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá. These battle sites are located in the area of what is now Tuyên Quang Province.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
