    "This problem asks for the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a specific small interval. The particle is in the n=2 quantum state.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe goal is to compute the probability of a particle's location within a given range. This requires using the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the concept of the wave function and probability density.\n\n**Step-by-step approach:**\n1.  State the formula for the probability of finding a particle in an interval, which involves integrating the probability density, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that interval.\n2.  Identify the correct normalized wave function, `ψn(x)`, for a particle in a 1D box.\n3.  Substitute the specific quantum number, n=2, into the wave function to get `ψ₂(x)`.\n4.  Calculate the probability density, `|ψ₂(x)|²`.\n5.  Set up the definite integral for the probability over the given interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n6.  Analyze the integrand. Notice that the interval is small and centered at a node of the n=2 wave function.\n7.  Use a suitable approximation (Taylor series expansion) to simplify the integral, as a direct evaluation can be cumbersome and a naive approximation would yield an incorrect result of zero.\n8.  Evaluate the simplified integral to find the probability.\n9.  Calculate the final numerical answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Correct Wave Function:** The normalized wave function for a 1D box of length `a` (from x=0 to x=a) is `ψn(x) = √(2/a) sin(nπx/a)`. It's crucial to use the correct formula and the correct state, `n=2`.\n2.  **Probability vs. Wave Function:** Probability is determined by the square of the magnitude of the wave function, `P(x) = |ψ(x)|²`, which is the probability density.\n3.  **Node at the Center:** For the `n=2` state, the wave function `ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) sin(2πx/a)` has a node at `x=a/2` because `sin(2π(a/2)/a) = sin(π) = 0`. The given interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]` is centered on this node.\n4.  **Choice of Approximation:** A simple approximation like `Probability ≈ P(x_center) × Δx` would incorrectly yield 0, as the probability density is zero at the center of the interval. Because the interval is very small, we can expand the probability density function around the node using a Taylor series, which will provide a highly accurate result.\n5.  **Small Angle Approximation:** The Taylor expansion method is equivalent to making a substitution `u = x - a/2` and then using the small angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ` for the resulting `sin²(2πu/a)` term, which becomes approximately `(2πu/a)²`.\n6.  **Cancellation of 'a':** The final probability must be a dimensionless number. One must ensure that the box length `a` properly cancels out in the final expression.\n7.  **Numerical Precision:** The final probability is a very small number. Calculations should be done carefully, especially with exponents and with a sufficiently accurate value of π.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Define the Probability Integral**\nThe probability (Prob) is found by integrating the probability density `|ψ₂(x)|²` from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n`Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] |ψ₂(x)|² dx`\n\n**Step 2: Define the Probability Density for n=2**\nFor n=2, `ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) sin(2πx/a)`.\nThe probability density is `P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) sin²(2πx/a)`.\n\n**Step 3: Set Up the Integral**\n`Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n\n**Step 4: Use an Approximation for the Small Interval**\nThe interval is small and centered at the node `x=a/2`. We can approximate the `sin²` function near this node. Let `x = a/2 + u`, where `u` represents the small displacement from the center. The new integration limits for `u` are from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n`sin²(2π(a/2 + u)/a) = sin²(π + 2πu/a) = [-sin(2πu/a)]² = sin²(2πu/a)`\nSince `u` is small, the argument `θ = 2πu/a` is also small. We use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\nSo, `sin²(2πu/a) ≈ (2πu/a)² = 4π²u²/a²`.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the Approximation and Integrate**\nSubstitute the approximation into the probability integral:\n`Prob ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * (4π²u²/a²) du`\n`Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] u² du`\n\nNow, perform the elementary integration:\n`Prob ≈ (8π²/a³) * [u³/3]` evaluated from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`\n`Prob ≈ (8π²/(3a³)) * [(+0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]`\n`Prob ≈ (8π²/(3a³)) * [2 * (0.005a)³]`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Numerical Value**\nThe `a³` term in the denominator cancels with the `a³` from `(0.005a)³`:\n`Prob ≈ (16π² / 3) * (0.005)³`\n`Prob ≈ (16π² / 3) * (5 × 10⁻³)³`\n`Prob ≈ (16π² / 3) * (125 × 10⁻⁹)`\n`Prob ≈ (2000π² / 3) × 10⁻⁹`\nThis can be expressed as `Prob ≈ (2/3)π² × 10⁻⁶`.\n\nUsing π ≈ 3.14159, so π² ≈ 9.8696:\n`Prob ≈ (2/3) * 9.8696 × 10⁻⁶`\n`Prob ≈ 6.5797 × 10⁻⁶`\n\nThis is approximately `0.00000658`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
