    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Reading:**\n    *   The word is 「弟」.\n    *   Its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otōto).\n\n2.  **Break the Word into Morae:**\n    *   A mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and rhythm in Japanese.\n    *   「おとうと」 consists of four morae:\n        *   お (o)\n        *   と (to)\n        *   う (u) - this is a long vowel, lengthening the preceding 'o' sound\n        *   と (to)\n    *   So, the structure is: o-to-u-to.\n\n3.  **Understand the Pitch Accent Patterns:**\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板式 - [0] pattern):** The pitch starts low on the first mora and rises on the second. It then stays high for the rest of the word and also for any grammatical particles that follow. For 「おとうと」, this would be `o(↓)tou-to(↑)`. A following particle like 「が」 would also be high: `otouto ga(↑)`.\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - [1] pattern):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second, staying low for the rest of the word and any following particles. For 「おとうと」, this would be `O(↑)touto(↓)`.\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - middle-high pattern):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second (or a later) mora, and then falls *within* the word itself. Any following particle is low. For a 4-mora word, the drop could happen on the third or fourth mora. Example: `o(↓)TO(↑)uto(↓)`.\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - tail-high pattern):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the following particle. For 「おとうと」, this would be `o(↓)tou-TO(↑)`, and a following particle would be low: `otouto GA(↓)`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Correct Pattern for 「弟」 (otōto):**\n    *   Consulting standard Japanese pitch accent dictionaries (such as the NHK 日本語発音アクセント新辞典), the accent for 「弟」 (otōto) is listed as **[0]**.\n    *   The [0] notation corresponds to the **Heiban (平板)** pattern.\n    *   Let's apply the Heiban pattern to the word with a particle like 「が」 (ga).\n        *   Word alone: おとうと -> The pitch starts low and rises, staying high. `o(L) t(H) o(H) u(H) t(H) o(H)`\n        *   Word with particle: 弟が (otōto ga) -> The particle continues the high pitch. `o(L) t(H) o(H) u(H) t(H) o(H) g(H) a(H)`\n    *   This lack of a pitch drop is the defining characteristic of the Heiban pattern.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 is Heiban. This matches choice A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** Pitch accent is based on morae, not syllables. 「とう」 (tō) is one syllable but two morae (to-u).\n*   **Notation:** The number in brackets, e.g., [0], [1], [2], indicates the accent kernel. [0] means Heiban. [1] means the pitch is high on the first mora and drops. [N] for a word with M morae (where 1 < N ≤ M) means the pitch is high from the second to the Nth mora, and then drops. If N is the last mora, it's an Odaka pattern; otherwise, it's Nakadaka.\n*   **Particles are Key:** The pitch of the particle following the noun is crucial for distinguishing between Heiban (particle is high) and Odaka (particle is low) patterns, as the word itself can sound similar in isolation.\n\nThe standard pitch accent for 「弟」 (otōto) is the Heiban pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
