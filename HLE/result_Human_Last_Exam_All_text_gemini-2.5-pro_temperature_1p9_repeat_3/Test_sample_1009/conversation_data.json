    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group G.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the problem and properties of G**\n\nWe are given a topological group G with the following properties:\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of G has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-countable:** The character of the group, $\\chi(G)$, is $\\aleph_0$. This means there is a countable local base at the identity element.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n*   **Potentially non-Hausdorff:** G is not required to be a Hausdorff space ($T_2$).\n\nWe want to find the largest possible value for the weight of G, denoted $w(G)$. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of G.\n\n**2. G must be non-Hausdorff**\n\nLet's consider what would happen if G were Hausdorff. For a compact Hausdorff group, there is a fundamental theorem that states its weight is equal to its character: $w(G) = \\chi(G)$.\nGiven that G is first-countable, we have $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. If G were Hausdorff, its weight would be $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\nAnother theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces (the Čech-Pospišil theorem) states that the cardinality of the space is bounded by its weight: $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$.\nIf G were Hausdorff, we would have $|G| \\le 2^{w(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\nHowever, we are given $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is strictly greater than $\\frak c$.\nThis contradiction shows that **G cannot be Hausdorff**.\n\n**3. The structure of non-Hausdorff topological groups**\n\nFor any topological group G, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $H = G/N$, with the quotient topology, is a Hausdorff topological group.\nLet's analyze the properties of this quotient group H:\n*   As the continuous image of a compact space G, H is **compact**.\n*   The character of the quotient is the same as the character of the original group, so $\\chi(H) = \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. Thus, H is **first-countable**.\n*   As established, H is **Hausdorff**.\n\nSo, $H = G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group. From the reasoning in Step 2, we can determine the properties of H:\n*   $w(H) = \\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   $|H| \\le 2^{w(H)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the cardinality relationship: $|G| = |H| \\cdot |N|$.\nGiven $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ and $|H| \\le \\frak c$, we must have:\n$|N| = \\frac{|G|}{|H|} \\ge \\frac{2^{2^\\frak c}}{\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\nSince $N$ is a subset of G, $|N| \\le |G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\nTherefore, the cardinality of the subgroup $N$ is exactly $|N| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n**4. Constructing an example to find the maximal weight**\n\nTo find the largest possible weight, we can try to construct a group G that satisfies all the given conditions and has a large weight.\nLet's build a group with the structure we've just deduced.\n*   Let $H$ be a suitable compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group with $|H| = \\frak c$. For example, the special unitary group $SU(2)$, which is a compact connected Lie group, has these properties. Since it's a compact manifold, it is second-countable, which implies $w(H)=\\aleph_0$ and $\\chi(H)=\\aleph_0$. Its cardinality is $\\frak c$.\n*   Let $K$ be an abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   Define the group G to be the direct product $G = H \\times K$. The cardinality is $|G| = |H| \\cdot |K| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   Now, we define a topology on G. Let $\\pi: G \\to H$ be the projection homomorphism, $\\pi(h,k)=h$. We equip G with the pullback topology from H. This means the local base at the identity $e_G = (e_H, e_K)$ is defined by the preimages of a local base at $e_H$. Let $\\{U_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ be a countable local base at $e_H$. We define a local base for G at $e_G$ as $\\{V_n = \\pi^{-1}(U_n) = U_n \\times K \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. This construction defines a valid topological group structure on G.\n\nLet's check the properties of this constructed G:\n*   **Compact:** $H$ is compact. The kernel of the projection is $N = \\{e_H\\} \\times K$. The subspace topology on $N$ is the indiscrete topology (any neighborhood of a point in N contains all of N), which is compact. A group extension of a compact group H by a compact group N is compact. So, G is compact.\n*   **First-countable:** By construction, the local base at the identity $\\{V_n\\}$ is countable. So $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, as constructed.\n*   **Non-Hausdorff:** The closure of the identity is $\\overline{\\{e_G\\}} = \\bigcap_n V_n = \\bigcap_n (U_n \\times K) = (\\bigcap_n U_n) \\times K = \\{e_H\\} \\times K = N$. Since $|N| > 1$, G is not Hausdorff.\n\n**5. Calculating the weight of the constructed group**\n\nNow we calculate the weight of this group G.\nA base for the topology of H can be chosen to be countable, let's call it $\\mathcal{B}_H = \\{B_m\\}_{m\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ (since $w(H)=\\aleph_0$).\nThe topology on G has as a subbase the collection of sets $\\{ g + V \\mid g \\in G, V \\text{ is in the local base at } e \\}$. More simply, a base is given by $\\{g\\pi^{-1}(B_m) \\mid g \\in G, m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\nNote that if $g_1$ and $g_2$ are in the same coset of $N=\\ker(\\pi)$, i.e., $g_1 = g_2 n$ for some $n \\in N$, then $g_1 \\pi^{-1}(B_m) = g_2 n \\pi^{-1}(B_m) = g_2 \\pi^{-1}(B_m)$, because $n$ is in the kernel and acts trivially on preimages.\nThis means we only need one representative $g$ for each coset of N. Let S be a set of coset representatives. Then $|S| = |G/N| = |H| = \\frak c$.\nA base for G is given by the collection $\\mathcal{B}_G = \\{s \\cdot \\pi^{-1}(B_m) \\mid s \\in S, m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\nThe cardinality of this base is $|S| \\cdot |\\mathcal{B}_H| = \\frak c \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\frak c$. So, for this construction, $w(G) \\le \\frak c$.\n\nTo show that the weight is exactly $\\frak c$, we must show that no smaller base exists.\nConsider the family of open sets $\\mathcal{F} = \\{ s \\cdot \\pi^{-1}(B_1) \\mid s \\in S\\}$, where $B_1$ is a fixed non-empty basic open set in H. The elements of $\\mathcal{F}$ are distinct for different choices of $s \\in S$, and they are disjoint. Specifically, if $s_1, s_2 \\in S$ with $s_1 \\neq s_2$, then their cosets $s_1N$ and $s_2N$ are disjoint. The sets $s_1 \\pi^{-1}(B_1)$ and $s_2 \\pi^{-1}(B_1)$ are unions of cosets contained entirely within $s_1 N \\pi^{-1}(B_1)$ and $s_2 N \\pi^{-1}(B_1)$ respectively, and are therefore disjoint.\nSince we have a collection of $\\frak c$ disjoint non-empty open sets, any base for the topology must contain at least one open set within each of these sets. Therefore, any base must have a cardinality of at least $|\\mathcal{F}| = |S| = \\frak c$.\nThis proves that for our constructed group, $w(G) = \\frak c$.\n\n**6. Upper bound for the weight**\n\nIt can be shown more generally that for any group G satisfying the given conditions, the weight is bounded above by $\\frak c$. The weight of a topological group is related to the weight of its Hausdorff quotient $H=G/N$. A plausible, though non-trivial, inequality is $w(G) \\le |G/N| \\cdot w(G/N)$. Using the facts we derived for $H=G/N$ ($|H|\\le\\frak c$ and $w(H)=\\aleph_0$), this gives $w(G) \\le \\frak c \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\frak c$.\n\nCombining the constructed example (which sets a lower bound on the maximum possible weight) and the upper bound, we conclude that the largest possible weight is $\\frak c$.\n\nFinal check of the steps: The reasoning that G must be non-Hausdorff is solid. The decomposition into G/N and N is standard. The properties of H are correctly derived. The construction provides a group that satisfies all conditions. The calculation of the weight for this constructed group to be $\\frak c$ seems correct, especially the argument using disjoint sets for the lower bound. The general argument for the upper bound suggests that $\\frak c$ is indeed the maximum.\n\nFinal answer is the cardinality of the continuum.\n$\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<2^{\\aleph_0}>>>"
