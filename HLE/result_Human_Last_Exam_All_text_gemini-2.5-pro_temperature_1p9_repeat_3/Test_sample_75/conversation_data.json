    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"Second Great War\"**\nThe \"Second Great War\" is the term used in StarCraft lore to describe the massive, sector-wide conflict that spans the entirety of the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*, including its epilogue). It is distinct from the First Great War (original *StarCraft*) and the Brood War (the *Brood War* expansion).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Point of the War**\nThe war is considered to have begun with the second major Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, led by the Queen of Blades. This is the inciting incident that kicks off the campaign of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*. According to the official StarCraft timeline, this event takes place in the year **2504**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Ending Point of the War**\nThe war concludes with the resolution of its central conflict: the threat of the fallen Xel'naga, Amon. This climax occurs in the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue campaign, \"Into the Void,\" where a unified force of Terrans, Zerg, and Protoss confronts and defeats Amon within the Void. The official timeline places the conclusion of this final battle in the year **2508**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Duration**\nTo find the duration of the war, we subtract the start year from the end year.\n*   End Year: 2508\n*   Start Year: 2504\n*   Calculation: 2508 - 2504 = 4 years.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Rounding**\nThe question asks for the duration in years, rounded up.\n*   Calculated duration: 4 years.\n*   Since 4 is a whole number, rounding it up still results in 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Defining the Conflict:** It is crucial to correctly identify that the \"Second Great War\" encompasses the entire *StarCraft II* saga, not just one of its campaigns. The conflict evolves from a Zerg invasion into a war against Amon's hybrid forces and the corrupted Golden Armada.\n2.  **Canonical Dates:** The accuracy of the answer depends entirely on using the officially established dates from StarCraft lore (2504 for the start and 2508 for the end).\n3.  **Calculation Method:** The duration is the difference between the end and start years. While events happen *within* these years, the standard way to measure the length of a conflict spanning multiple years is `End Year - Start Year`.\n4.  **Rounding Instruction:** The user specified to \"round up\". For an integer result like 4, this instruction does not change the final number. If the war had lasted, for example, 3.5 years, the answer would have been rounded up to 4.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the total duration of the Second Great War is 4 years.\n\n<<<4>>>"
