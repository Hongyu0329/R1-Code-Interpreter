    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Year:** 2008\n    *   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n    *   **Role:** Kitri\n    *   **Segment:** Act I variation\n    *   **Specific Move:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step:**\n    *   A \"pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\" is a very specific turn in classical ballet. The dancer starts with feet in the fifth position, performs a plié (bends the knees), then pushes off into a relevé (rises onto pointe) on the supporting leg while the other leg comes to the retiré position. They execute a single outward (en dehors) rotation and typically land back in the fifth position plié. To perform multiple, the dancer would repeat this entire sequence for each turn.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography of Kitri's Act I Variation:**\n    *   This variation is one of the most famous and technically demanding solos for a ballerina. Its choreography, especially in the Bolshoi tradition, is very well-established.\n    *   The key turning sequences in Kitri's Act I variation are famously:\n        1.  **A diagonal of piqué turns:** This is a traveling sequence where the dancer steps directly onto a straight leg on pointe for each turn. This is not a pirouette from fifth position.\n        2.  **A series of fouetté turns:** This is a stationary sequence of turns, usually performed at the end of a variation or coda, where the dancer whips the working leg around to propel each rotation while the supporting leg stays in place. This is also not a pirouette from fifth position.\n\n4.  **Review the Specific Performance:**\n    *   By reviewing available footage of Natalia Osipova performing this variation during her time at the Bolshoi (circa 2008-2011), we can confirm the choreographic content.\n    *   Her rendition is celebrated for its high energy, powerful jumps, and razor-sharp turns. She performs the standard choreographic elements, including the piqué turn diagonal and, in the coda, the fouetté turns.\n\n5.  **Cross-reference the Step with the Choreography:**\n    *   The specific step requested—a series of single-turn pirouettes from the fifth position—is not a feature of the standard choreography for this variation. It is a training step (an exercise often done in class) but is not typically used as a major showcase sequence in this context. The variation's structure favors the more brilliant and dynamic piqué and fouetté turns to express Kitri's fiery character.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the standard choreography for Kitri's Act I variation in *Don Quixote* and videos of Natalia Osipova's performances from that period, the specific sequence of \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\" is not performed. The turning sections in this variation consist of other types of turns (piqués and fouettés). Therefore, the number of such turns performed is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
