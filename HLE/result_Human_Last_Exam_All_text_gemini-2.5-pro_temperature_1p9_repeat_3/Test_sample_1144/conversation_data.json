    "This problem requires us to combine two fundamental concepts of early quantum mechanics: the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the Bohr model for the hydrogen atom.\n\n**Analysis of the Question:**\n*   **Objective:** Find the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum itself ($\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$) for an electron.\n*   **Conditions:** The electron is in the first Bohr orbit (n=1).\n*   **Given Information:** The uncertainty in the electron's position is $\\Delta x = 10$ pm.\n\n**Careful Points & Required Constants:**\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position ($\\Delta x$) and momentum ($\\Delta p$) is at least $\\hbar/2$. We will use the minimum uncertainty condition: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n2.  **Bohr's Model of the Atom:** For an electron in a circular orbit, the angular momentum ($L$) is quantized, meaning it can only take discrete values: $L = mvr = n\\hbar$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number.\n3.  **Momentum:** The linear momentum is given by $p = mv$.\n4.  **Units:** All values must be in SI units for consistency. We need to convert the given position uncertainty from picometers (pm) to meters (m). $1 \\text{ pm} = 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$.\n5.  **Constants:**\n    *   Radius of the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$), denoted as $r_1$ or $a_0$ (Bohr radius): $a_0 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11}$ m.\n    *   Reduced Planck's Constant: $\\hbar = 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ JÂ·s. (While we can solve this problem without its numerical value, it's good to be aware of it).\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Express the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$).**\nFrom the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, we can find the uncertainty in momentum, $\\Delta p$:\n$\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\Delta x}$\n\n**Step 2: Express the momentum of the electron ($p$).**\nAccording to the Bohr model, the angular momentum of an electron in the n-th orbit is quantized:\n$L = m_e v_n r_n = n\\hbar$\nFor the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$, so:\n$m_e v_1 r_1 = (1)\\hbar = \\hbar$\nThe momentum of the electron is $p = m_e v_1$. Substituting this into the angular momentum equation:\n$p \\cdot r_1 = \\hbar$\n$p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.**\nNow, we form the ratio using the expressions from Step 1 and Step 2:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\Delta x} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1} \\right)}$\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling out the reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar$:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\Delta x} \\cdot \\frac{r_1}{\\hbar}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{r_1}{2\\Delta x}$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the known values and calculate the final answer.**\nWe are given:\n*   Uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   Radius of the first Bohr orbit, $r_1 = a_0 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\nNow, substitute these values into our simplified ratio formula:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29}{2}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
