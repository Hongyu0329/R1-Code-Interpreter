    "Answering this question involves understanding the concepts of Boolean functions and their prime implicants, and then finding the maximum possible number of prime implicants for a function with 4 variables.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define a(n):** `a(n)` is the maximal number of prime implicants that any Boolean function of `n` variables can have. We are asked to find `a(4)`.\n\n2.  **Define Prime Implicant (PI):**\n    *   An **implicant** of a function `f` is a product term (AND of literals) `P` such that whenever `P` is true, `f` is also true. In a Karnaugh map (K-map), an implicant corresponds to a rectangular group of '1's.\n    *   A **prime implicant** is an implicant that is \"minimal\" in the sense that if you remove any literal from it, it is no longer an implicant of `f`. In a K-map, this corresponds to a rectangular group of '1's that is not fully contained within any single larger rectangular group of '1's.\n    *   The goal is to find a function `f(x1, x2, x3, x4)` (an arrangement of '1's and '0's on a 4-variable K-map) that results in the largest number of these maximal groupings.\n\n3.  **Analyze for smaller values of n:**\n    *   **a(1) = 1:** A function like `f(x) = x` has one PI (`x`). A function like `f(x)=1` has one PI (`1`). The maximum is 1.\n    *   **a(2) = 2:** The function `f(x1, x2) = x1'x2 + x1x2'` (XOR function) has two '1's on its K-map that cannot be grouped. Each minterm is a PI. Thus, it has 2 PIs. This is the maximum for n=2.\n    *   **a(3) = 6:** A common guess for maximizing PIs is the parity (XOR) function, which for `n=3` has `2^(3-1) = 4` PIs. However, this is not the maximum. The function `f(x1, x2, x3) = x1x2' + x2x3' + x3x1'` has 6 PIs. The PIs are the 3 terms in the expression and 3 others generated by consensus: `{x1x2', x2x3', x3x1', x1'x2, x2'x3, x3'x1}`.\n\n4.  **Hypothesize for n=4:**\n    Following the pattern from `n=3`, we can construct a candidate function for `n=4`. The structure `x1x2' + x2x3' + x3x1'` is a cyclic sum of products. For `n=4`, this generalizes to:\n    `f(x1, x2, x3, x4) = x1x2' + x2x3' + x3x4' + x4x1'`\n\n5.  **Find the Prime Implicants for the candidate function f(x1, x2, x3, x4):**\n    We need to find all the prime implicants of this function. We can test product terms of two literals to see if they are PIs. A term `P` is a PI if it implies `f` (`P=1 => f=1`) and it's minimal.\n\n    The prime implicants for this function fall into two categories based on the distance between variable indices in the cycle (1->2->3->4->1):\n\n    *   **Adjacent variables (distance 1):** Terms of the form `x_i x_{i+1}'` and `x_i' x_{i+1}` (indices are mod 4).\n        *   `x1x2', x2x3', x3x4', x4x1'`: These are the 4 terms used to build `f`. They are all PIs.\n        *   `x1'x2, x2'x3, x3'x4, x4'x1`: We can verify each of these is an implicant and is prime. For example, to check `x1'x2`, we must show `f=1` whenever `x1=0, x2=1`.\n            `f(0, 1, x3, x4) = (0*0) + (1*x3') + (x3*x4') + (x4*1) = x3' + x3x4' + x4`. Using the Boolean identity `A' + AB = A' + B`, we get `(x3' + x3x4') + x4 = (x3' + x4') + x4 = x3' + 1 = 1`. So, `x1'x2` is an implicant, and it can be shown to be prime.\n        This gives a total of `4 + 4 = 8` PIs from adjacent variables.\n\n    *   **\"Diagonal\" variables (distance 2):** Terms of the form `x_i x_{i+2}'` and `x_i' x_{i+2}` (indices are mod 4).\n        *   `x1x3'`: To check this, we test `f` when `x1=1, x3=0`.\n            `f(1, x2, 0, x4) = (1*x2') + (x2*1) + (0*x4') + (x4*0) = x2' + x2 = 1`. So `x1x3'` is a PI.\n        *   `x1'x3`: To check this, we test `f` when `x1=0, x3=1`.\n            `f(0, x2, 1, x4) = (0*x2') + (x2*0) + (1*x4') + (x4*1) = x4' + x4 = 1`. So `x1'x3` is a PI.\n        *   By symmetry, the other diagonal pair `{x2, x4}` also yields 2 PIs: `x2x4'` and `x2'x4`.\n        This gives a total of `2 + 2 = 4` PIs from diagonal variables.\n\n6.  **Calculate the total number of Prime Implicants:**\n    The total number of PIs for this constructed function is the sum from the two groups: `8 + 4 = 12`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The function `f = x1x2' + x2x3' + x3x4' + x4x1'` has 12 prime implicants. It is a known result in switching theory that this is the maximal number for a 4-variable function. Therefore, `a(4) = 12`.\n\nFinal Answer is the number 12.\n\n>>>12"
