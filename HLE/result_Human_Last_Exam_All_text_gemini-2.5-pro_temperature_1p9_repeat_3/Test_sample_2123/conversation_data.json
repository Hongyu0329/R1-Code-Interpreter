    "This is a classic literary puzzle that hinges on a pun between the Russian language and an English name. Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** We are looking for an English poet's surname. This surname appears in a Russian text (described as a \"Russian translation of a certain essay,\" which points to a Russian-language original). The context is a description of the \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\"\n\n2.  **Focus on the linguistic clue:** The core of the puzzle is almost certainly a play on words, or a homophone, that works in the Russian language. We need to find a Russian word related to \"wide boulevards\" that sounds like the name of an English poet.\n\n3.  **Analyze the setting: \"Wide boulevards of Vienna.\"** Vienna is famous for its grand, imposing architecture and wide avenues like the Ringstrasse. When you have a street lined with massive, ornate buildings, a visually striking feature is not just the wide open space of the boulevard itself, but also the narrow, canyon-like gaps or crevices *between* the buildings.\n\n4.  **Connect the setting to Russian vocabulary:** The Russian word for \"gaps\" or \"crevices\" is **\"щели\"** (pronounced roughly as *'shcheli'*).\n\n5.  **Find the phonetic match:** Now, we search for an English poet whose surname, when transliterated into Russian, sounds like \"щели\" (*shcheli*). The name that fits perfectly is **Shelley**. The Russian spelling and pronunciation of the poet's name is **\"Шелли\"** (*'Shelli'*), which is phonetically almost identical to \"щели\".\n\n6.  **Synthesize the information:** The author of the essay, often identified as the Nobel Prize-winning Russian poet Joseph Brodsky (who spent his first months in exile in Vienna), makes a sophisticated pun. While observing the wide boulevards of Vienna, he notes the \"щели\" (gaps) between the monumental buildings, and this word reminds him of the English Romantic poet \"Шелли\" (Shelley). Therefore, the poet's name appears in the description.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The clue \"wide boulevards\" is a slight misdirection. The answer doesn't come from a word meaning \"wide\" but from a feature *created by* the architecture on those boulevards (the gaps).\n*   The phrase \"Russian translation of a certain essay\" implies the original might not be Russian, but in the context of this well-known puzzle, it refers to a text written in Russian by a native Russian speaker.\n*   The connection is purely phonetic and relies on understanding the sound of the relevant Russian word.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe Russian word for \"gaps\" is \"щели\" (*shcheli*). This sounds like the Russian pronunciation of the surname \"Шелли\" (*Shelli*). The English poet is Percy Bysshe Shelley. His surname is Shelley.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
