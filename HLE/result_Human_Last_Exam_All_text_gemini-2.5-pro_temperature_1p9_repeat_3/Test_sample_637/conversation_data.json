    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for a deadbeat observer that makes the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` equal to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. The error dynamics of a Luenberger observer `x_hat(k + 1) = (A - LC)x_hat(k) + Bu(k) + Ly(k)` are governed by:\n`e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\nFor the error to become zero in a finite number of steps and stay zero, the matrix `A_c = A - LC` must be nilpotent, i.e., `(A - LC)^N = 0` for some integer `N`. The \"shortest possible number of steps\" corresponds to the minimum possible value of this integer `N`. This minimum value is the observability index `v_o` of the pair `(A, C)`.\n\n**2. Check Observability and Find the Observability Index (v_o)**\nThe system is observable if the observability matrix `O = [C^T, (CA)^T, ..., (CA^(n-1))^T]^T` has full rank `n`. Here `n=4`.\n`A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`, `C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\n*   **Step v=1:**\n    `O_1 = C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`.\n    The rank of `C` is 2, since the two rows are linearly independent. `rank(O_1) = 2 < 4`.\n\n*   **Step v=2:**\n    `CA = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\n    `O_2 = [C; CA] = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\n    The rank of this 4x4 matrix can be found by row reduction.\n    The vectors `[1 0 0 0]`, `[0 0 0 1]` (from R2-R1), `[0 0 1 0]` (from R4+2*R1) form a basis for 3 of the rows. The rank is 3. `rank(O_2) = 3 < 4`.\n\n*   **Step v=3:**\n    `A^2 = A * A = [0 0 1 -2; -3 0 2 -1; 2 0 -1 3; 0 1 -1 -1]`\n    `CA^2 = C * A^2 = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * A^2 = [0 0 1 -2; 0 1 0 -3]`\n    `O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2]`\n    The rank of `O_3` is the rank of `[1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0; 0 0 1 -2; 0 1 0 -3]`.\n    The rows from `O_2` span a 3D space. The new row `[0 1 0 -3]` from `CA^2` is linearly independent of the rows of `O_2`. Thus, `rank(O_3) = 4`.\n\nThe system is observable, and the observability index is `v_o = 3`. This is the minimum number of steps in which the error can be driven to zero.\n\n**3. Set Up Design Constraints**\nWe need to find the observer gain `L` such that:\n1.  The closed-loop observer matrix `A_c = A - LC` has all its eigenvalues at the origin. This means its characteristic polynomial must be `det(zI - A_c) = z^4`.\n2.  The nilpotency index of `A_c` is `v_o = 3`. This means `(A_c)^3 = 0` and `(A_c)^2 != 0`.\n    This implies that the minimal polynomial of `A_c` is `z^3`. For a `4x4` matrix with characteristic polynomial `z^4` and minimal polynomial `z^3`, its Jordan normal form must be `diag(J_3(0), J_1(0))`. This structure requires two Jordan blocks for the eigenvalue 0.\n3.  The number of Jordan blocks for an eigenvalue is equal to the dimension of the corresponding eigenspace (geometric multiplicity). Here, `dim(Nul(A_c - 0*I)) = dim(Nul(A_c)) = 2`.\n4.  This gives the crucial constraint: `rank(A_c) = n - dim(Nul(A_c)) = 4 - 2 = 2`.\n\n**4. Solve for the Observer Gain L**\nLet `L` be a `4x2` matrix: `L = [l_ij]`.\n`A_c = A - LC = A - [l11 l12; l21 l22; l31 l32; l41 l42] * [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n`A_c = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] - [l11+l12 0 0 l12; l21+l22 0 0 l22; l31+l32 0 0 l32; l41+l42 0 0 l42]`\n`A_c = [-1-(l11+l12) 0 0 1-l12; 1-(l21+l22) 0 0 2-l22; -(l31+l32) 1 0 -1-l32; -1-(l41+l42) 0 1 -1-l42]`\n\n*   **Apply the Rank Condition `rank(A_c) = 2`:**\n    The 2nd and 3rd columns of `A_c` are `[0;0;1;0]` and `[0;0;0;1]`. They are linearly independent, so `rank(A_c) >= 2`. For the rank to be exactly 2, the 1st and 4th columns must be linear combinations of the 2nd and 3rd. This means the first two entries of columns 1 and 4 must be zero.\n    1.  `-1 - (l11 + l12) = 0`\n    2.  `1 - (l21 + l22) = 0`\n    3.  `1 - l12 = 0`  =>  `l12 = 1`\n    4.  `2 - l22 = 0`  =>  `l22 = 2`\n\n    Substitute `l12` and `l22` back into the first two equations:\n    `l11 = -1 - l12 = -1 - 1 = -2`\n    `l21 = 1 - l22 = 1 - 2 = -1`\n\n*   **Apply the Characteristic Polynomial Condition `det(zI-A_c) = z^4`:**\n    With the values found, `A_c` has the form:\n    `A_c = [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; -(l31+l32) 1 0 -1-l32; -1-(l41+l42) 0 1 -1-l42]`\n    Let's find its characteristic polynomial:\n    `det(zI - A_c) = det([z 0 0 0; 0 z 0 0; l31+l32 -1 z 1+l32; 1+l41+l42 0 -1 z+1+l42])`\n    Expanding along the first row gives `z * det([z 0 0; -1 z 1+l32; 0 -1 z+1+l42])`.\n    Expanding again gives `z * (z * det([z 1+l32; -1 z+1+l42])) = z^2 * (z(z+1+l42) - (-1)(1+l32))`.\n    `det(zI - A_c) = z^2 * (z^2 + (1+l42)z + (1+l32)) = z^4 + (1+l42)z^3 + (1+l32)z^2`\n    For this to be equal to `z^4`, the coefficients of `z^3` and `z^2` must be zero:\n    1.  `1 + l42 = 0` => `l42 = -1`\n    2.  `1 + l32 = 0` => `l32 = -1`\n\n*   **Assemble the Gain Matrix L:**\n    We have found values for six of the eight entries in `L`. The remaining two, `l31` and `l41`, do not affect the conditions we imposed. The problem asks for *an* observer gain, so we can choose the simplest values for them, `l31 = 0` and `l41 = 0`.\n    The elements of `L` are:\n    `l11 = -2`, `l12 = 1`\n    `l21 = -1`, `l22 = 2`\n    `l31 = 0`,  `l32 = -1`\n    `l41 = 0`,  `l42 = -1`\n\n    The final observer gain matrix is:\n    `L = [-2  1;`\n    `     -1  2;`\n    `      0 -1;`\n    `      0 -1]`\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe gain matrix of the observer is:\n`L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]`\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
