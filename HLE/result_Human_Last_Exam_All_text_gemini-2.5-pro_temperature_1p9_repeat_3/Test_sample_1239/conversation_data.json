    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$) and one time dimension ($t \\in \\mathbb{R}$) are given by:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ is the fluid velocity vector, $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ is the pressure (divided by density), and $\\nu > 0$ is the constant kinematic viscosity.\n\nA Lie group of symmetries is a continuous group of transformations of the independent variables ($t, \\mathbf{x}$) and dependent variables ($\\mathbf{u}, p$) that maps solutions of the system to other solutions. The dimension of this group is the number of independent parameters that define the transformations. This is equivalent to finding the dimension of the corresponding Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators.\n\nWe can find these symmetries by considering the fundamental invariances of the physical laws they represent.\n\n1.  **Time Translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$ (they are autonomous). Therefore, if $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}))$ is a solution, so is $(\\mathbf{u}(t+c, \\mathbf{x}), p(t+c, \\mathbf{x}))$ for any constant $c$.\n    *   **Dimension:** 1\n\n2.  **Space Translations:** The equations have constant coefficients and are defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so they do not depend on the absolute position in space. A translation of the coordinate system $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}$ for any constant vector $\\mathbf{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ will yield another solution.\n    *   **Dimension:** 3 (one for each component of $\\mathbf{c}$)\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations:** The operators used in the equations ($\\nabla$, $\\nabla \\cdot$, $\\nabla^2$) are invariant under rotations. The term $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}$ is also rotationally covariant. This means that rotating the system in space maps a solution to another solution. The group of rotations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is SO(3).\n    *   **Dimension:** 3 (corresponding to rotations about the three coordinate axes)\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change to an inertial frame of reference moving at a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$. This transformation, known as a Galilean boost, is given by:\n    *   $t' = t$\n    *   $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{v}_0 t$\n    *   $\\mathbf{u}'(t', \\mathbf{x}') = \\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) - \\mathbf{v}_0$\n    *   $p'(t', \\mathbf{x}') = p(t, \\mathbf{x})$\n    This transformation preserves the form of the Navier-Stokes equations. Since $\\mathbf{v}_0$ is an arbitrary constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this introduces three more parameters.\n    *   **Dimension:** 3\n\n5.  **Scaling Transformation:** The Navier-Stokes equations possess a specific scaling symmetry. If we scale the variables as follows with a parameter $\\alpha > 0$:\n    *   $t' = \\alpha^2 t$\n    *   $\\mathbf{x}' = \\alpha \\mathbf{x}$\n    *   $\\mathbf{u}' = \\alpha^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$\n    *   $p' = \\alpha^{-2} p$\n    and apply these transformations to the equations, the equations remain invariant. This is a one-parameter family of transformations.\n    *   **Dimension:** 1\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Finite vs. Infinite Dimensionality:** The full Lie symmetry group of the Navier-Stokes equations is actually infinite-dimensional. This arises from so-called \"trivial\" or \"gauge\" symmetries. For example, since only the gradient of the pressure, $\\nabla p$, appears in the momentum equation, we can transform the pressure $p \\to p + f(t)$ for any arbitrary function $f(t)$ without changing the equation for $\\mathbf{u}$. This introduces an infinite-dimensional group of symmetries.\n*   **Physical Interpretation:** When the question asks for \"the dimension\", it is standard practice to refer to the dimension of the *maximal finite-dimensional symmetry subgroup*. This group corresponds to transformations between physically distinct solutions in inertial reference frames (e.g., changing position, orientation, velocity, or scale). The infinite-dimensional part is often considered a redundancy in the mathematical description rather than a generator of new physical states.\n*   **Basis of Lie Algebra:** The dimension is the number of basis vectors (infinitesimal generators) for the Lie algebra corresponding to this finite-dimensional group. Each of the symmetry types listed above corresponds to a set of these generators.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nWe sum the dimensions contributed by each of the finite-dimensional, physically significant symmetry transformations identified above:\n\n*   Time Translation: 1\n*   Space Translations: 3\n*   Spatial Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean Boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the (maximal finite-dimensional) Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
