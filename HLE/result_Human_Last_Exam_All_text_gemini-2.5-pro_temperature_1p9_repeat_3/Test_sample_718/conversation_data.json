    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of $n$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Basic Concepts**\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice (J):** An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements have a least upper bound (or join). We can view this poset as a category, where the objects are the elements of $J$, and there is a unique morphism from $i$ to $j$ if and only if $i \\leq j$. The composition of morphisms is given by the transitivity of the partial order.\n*   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$:** This is a representation of the poset $J$. To each object $i \\in J$, it assigns a vector space $f(i)$. To each morphism $i \\leq j$, it assigns a linear map $f(i \\to j): f(i) \\to f(j)$, such that if $i \\leq j \\leq k$, the map for $i \\leq k$ is the composition of the maps for $i \\leq j$ and $j \\leq k$.\n*   **n-resolvable:** A functor (or more generally, an object in an abelian category) $f$ is said to be $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence of the form:\n    $0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$\n    where each $P_i$ is a projective functor. This is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of $f$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$, is less than or equal to $n$.\n*   **Projective Functors in $J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$:** The standard projective functors are the representable functors, denoted $P_j$, for each $j \\in J$. The functor $P_j$ is defined by $P_j(i) = K[\\text{Hom}_J(j, i)]$, which is the vector space with a basis indexed by the morphisms from $j$ to $i$. Since there is at most one morphism, this simplifies to $P_j(i) = K$ if $j \\leq i$, and $P_j(i) = \\{0\\}$ otherwise. Any projective functor is a direct sum of these $P_j$.\n\n**Step 2: Connecting \"Tame\" Functor to the Properties of the Poset J**\n\nThe property of a functor being \"tame\" is not typically a property of a single functor, but rather a property of the entire category of functors, i.e., a property of the poset $J$ itself. When we say $f$ is a tame functor, it is standard to interpret this as $f$ being a functor from a poset $J$ which is of **tame representation type**. This means that the classification of all indecomposable representations of $J$ is manageable (in a precise sense, involving a finite number of one-parameter families for each dimension), as opposed to being of wild type (unclassifiable) or finite type (only a finite number of indecomposables in total).\n\n**Step 3: Using the Classification of Tame Posets**\n\nA fundamental result in the representation theory of posets, primarily due to Nazarova, is the classification of posets based on their representation type. A poset $J$ is of tame representation type if and only if it does not contain any of a list of specific \"critical\" posets as a subposet.\nOne of the most important forbidden subposets for tameness is the poset consisting of four mutually incomparable elements, often denoted $(1,1,1,1)$. This poset is an antichain of size 4.\n\n**Step 4: Relating the Tameness Criterion to a Structural Property of J**\n\nThe *width* of a poset $J$, denoted $\\text{width}(J)$, is the size of the largest antichain (a subset of mutually incomparable elements) in $J$.\nSince a tame poset $J$ cannot contain the poset $(1,1,1,1)$ as a subposet, this directly implies that the largest antichain in $J$ can have at most 3 elements. Therefore, a necessary condition for a poset $J$ to be of tame representation type is that its width must be at most 3.\nSo, if $J$ is a tame poset, then $\\text{width}(J) \\leq 3$.\n\n**Step 5: Invoking a Key Homological Theorem**\n\nThere is a deep connection, established by Auslander, between the width of a poset and the global dimension of its category of representations. The **global dimension** of the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all functors $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$.\n**Auslander's Theorem:** The category of representations of a poset $J$, $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, has global dimension at most 2 if and only if the width of $J$ is at most 3.\nThat is, $\\text{gldim}(\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)) \\leq 2 \\iff \\text{width}(J) \\leq 3$.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesizing the Argument to Find n**\n\n1.  We are given a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$. We interpret this to mean that the poset $J$ is of tame representation type.\n2.  If $J$ is of tame representation type, it cannot contain the critical poset $(1,1,1,1)$.\n3.  This implies that the width of the poset $J$ is at most 3, i.e., $\\text{width}(J) \\leq 3$.\n4.  By Auslander's theorem, if $\\text{width}(J) \\leq 3$, then the global dimension of the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is at most 2.\n5.  The global dimension is the supremum of all projective dimensions. Thus, for *any* functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ (where $J$ is a tame poset), we must have $\\text{pd}(f) \\leq \\text{gldim}(\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)) \\leq 2$.\n6.  A functor $f$ being $n$-resolvable means that $\\text{pd}(f) \\leq n$. Since we have shown that $\\text{pd}(f) \\leq 2$ for any such functor, it follows that any such functor is **2-resolvable**.\n\nThe value $n=2$ is the best possible upper bound, because there exist tame posets (e.g., the poset $(1,1,2)$, which has width 3) for which the global dimension of the representation category is exactly 2. For such posets, there will be functors with projective dimension equal to 2, which are 2-resolvable but not 1-resolvable.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Tame Functor\":** The crucial first step is to correctly interpret \"tame functor\" as a functor on a poset of tame representation type.\n*   **Representation Type of Posets:** Knowledge of the classification of posets by representation type (finite, tame, wild) and the associated forbidden subposets is essential. The key one for this problem is $(1,1,1,1)$.\n*   **Poset Width:** Understanding the definition of the width of a poset and its connection to forbidden subposets is needed.\n*   **Homological Dimension:** The final piece is connecting the structural property (width) to a homological property (global dimension) via Auslander's theorem.\n*   **n-resolvable vs. Projective Dimension:** Remembering that $f$ is $n$-resolvable is equivalent to the statement $\\text{pd}(f) \\leq n$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis establishes that for any functor $f$ on a tame poset $J$, its projective dimension is at most 2. Therefore, any such functor admits a projective resolution of length 2. This means any such functor is 2-resolvable.\n\nThe question asks for what $n$ a tame functor is $n$-resolvable. Since this must hold for *all* tame functors, $n$ must be an integer such that every tame functor has a projective dimension less than or equal to $n$. As the maximum possible projective dimension is 2, the value for $n$ is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
