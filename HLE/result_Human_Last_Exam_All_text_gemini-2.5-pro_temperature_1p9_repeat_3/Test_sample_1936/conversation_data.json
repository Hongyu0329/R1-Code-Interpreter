    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ of $n$ elements with a binary operation that is not a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of a Group\nA group is a set $G$, together with a binary operation $\\cdot$ on $G$, satisfying four fundamental properties (axioms):\n1.  **Closure**: For any two elements $a, b \\in G$, their product $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$.\n2.  **Associativity**: For any three elements $a, b, c \\in G$, the equation $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ holds.\n3.  **Identity Element**: There exists a unique element $e \\in G$ such that for every element $a \\in G$, $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$.\n4.  **Inverse Element**: For each element $a \\in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1} \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \\cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n\nThe question specifies \"a binary operation defined on it\", which means the closure property is guaranteed to hold. The structure $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group if it fails to satisfy at least one of the other three axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse).\n\n### Careful Point: Is the empty set considered?\nThe existence of an identity element (axiom 3) requires that the set $G$ is not empty. Most standard textbooks on abstract algebra explicitly state that a group must be a non-empty set. Therefore, we should search for the smallest integer $n \\geq 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the case for n = 1\nLet $G$ be a set with one element, say $G = \\{a\\}$.\nA binary operation on $G$ is a function from $G \\times G$ to $G$. The set $G \\times G$ has only one element: $(a, a)$. So, there is only one possible binary operation we can define:\n$a \\cdot a = a$\n\nLet's check if this structure $(G, \\cdot)$ is a group:\n*   **Closure**: Satisfied by definition ($a \\cdot a = a \\in G$).\n*   **Associativity**: We must check if $(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = x \\cdot (y \\cdot z)$ for all $x, y, z \\in G$. The only choice is $x=y=z=a$.\n    *   LHS: $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   RHS: $a \\cdot (a \\cdot a) = a \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   Since LHS = RHS, associativity holds.\n*   **Identity Element**: We need an element $e \\in G$ such that $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$. The only candidate for $e$ is $a$. Let's check if $e=a$ works: $a \\cdot a = a$. It does. So, $a$ is the identity element.\n*   **Inverse Element**: For each element (only $a$), we need an inverse. The inverse of $a$ must be an element $x \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot x = e$. Here, $e=a$, so we need $a \\cdot x = a$. The only choice for $x$ is $a$, and we have $a \\cdot a = a$. So, the inverse of $a$ is $a$ itself.\n\nSince all four axioms are satisfied, any set of size 1 with a binary operation forms a group. Thus, it's impossible to find a set of size $n=1$ that is *not* a group.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the case for n = 2\nLet $G$ be a set with two elements, say $G = \\{a, b\\}$.\nWe need to determine if we can define a binary operation $\\cdot$ on $G$ such that $(G, \\cdot)$ is *not* a group. We only need to find one such example.\n\nLet's try to construct an operation that fails the identity element axiom.\nConsider the following operation, defined by its Cayley table:\n```\n  . | a | b\n----+---+---\n  a | a | a\n  b | a | a\n```\nHere, the result of any operation is the element `a`.\nLet's check the properties of this structure:\n*   **Closure**: The result of any operation is `a`, which is in $G$. So, closure holds.\n*   **Identity Element**: Let's check if an identity element exists.\n    *   Can `a` be the identity? For `a` to be the identity, we would need $a \\cdot x = x$ for all $x \\in G$. Let's test $x=b$. We would need $a \\cdot b = b$. But according to our table, $a \\cdot b = a$. Since $a \\neq b$, `a` cannot be the identity element.\n    *   Can `b` be the identity? For `b` to be the identity, we would need $b \\cdot x = x$ for all $x \\in G$. Let's test $x=a$. We need $b \\cdot a = a$. This is true according to the table. Now let's test $x=b$. We need $b \\cdot b = b$. But our table says $b \\cdot b = a$. So `b` cannot be the identity element.\n\nSince neither element in $G$ is an identity element, the structure has no identity element. Therefore, $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n\nWe have successfully found an example of a set with $n=2$ elements and a binary operation that does not form a group.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n*   For $n=1$, any set with a binary operation is always a group.\n*   For $n=2$, we demonstrated that it is possible to define a binary operation on a set that does not form a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number $n$ such that a set of $n$ elements with a binary operation can fail to be a group is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
