    "Answering this question involves point-set topology in the plane. Let's break down the problem and build towards the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the conditions\nLet `S` be the unit square, `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\nWe are looking for two subsets, `A` and `B`, of the plane with the following properties:\n1.  `A` is a closed set.\n2.  `B` is a closed set.\n3.  `A` is a connected set.\n4.  `B` is a connected set.\n5.  Their union is the unit square: `A U B = S`.\n\nWe are interested in their intersection, `X = A ∩ B`. The question is: What is the largest possible number of connected components of `X`?\n\n### Step 2: Exploring simple cases\nLet's try to construct `A` and `B` and see how many components their intersection has.\n*   **Case 1:** Let `A` be the left half of the square and `B` be the right half.\n    *   `A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1]`\n    *   `B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1]`\n    *   All conditions are met. `A` and `B` are closed and connected rectangles. Their union is `S`.\n    *   The intersection `X = A ∩ B` is the line segment `{1/2} x [0, 1]`. This is connected.\n    *   Number of components = 1.\n\n*   **Case 2:** Let `B` be a smaller, closed square inside `S`, and `A` be everything else.\n    *   `B = [1/4, 3/4] x [1/4, 3/4]`\n    *   `A = S \\ Int(B)`, where `Int(B)` is the interior of `B`. This is equivalent to `cl(S \\ B)`.\n    *   `A` is the square with an open square removed from the middle. `A` is closed and connected (it is path-connected). `B` is a closed square, so it is also closed and connected. `A U B = S`.\n    *   The intersection `X = A ∩ B` is the boundary of `B`. This boundary is a single, closed rectangular loop. It is connected.\n    *   Number of components = 1.\n\nThese simple examples suggest the answer might be 1. One might try to prove this using a topological argument (like the Mayer-Vietoris sequence), but these arguments often have subtle prerequisites (like `S` being the union of the *interiors* of `A` and `B`) that are not met here.\n\n### Step 3: A crucial insight and a construction for more components\nThe simple examples above are of the form `A = cl(U)` and `B = cl(V)` where `U` and `V` are disjoint open sets whose union is almost the entire square. To get disconnected intersections, we need a more intricate arrangement.\n\nLet's try to construct a case with two components. We can define the sets `A` and `B` based on a predefined intersection `X`.\n1.  Let's define our target intersection `X`. For it to have two components, let's pick two disjoint closed sets. A good choice is two disjoint arcs on a circle. Let `D` be a closed disk inside the square `S`, and let `C` be its boundary circle. Let's take two disjoint closed arcs on `C`, call them `X_1` and `X_2`. Let `X = X_1 U X_2`. This set is closed and has 2 components.\n2.  The rest of the circle `C` consists of two disjoint open arcs. Let's call their union `G`. So `C = X U G`.\n3.  Now let's define `A` and `B`.\n    *   Let `A = (D \\ G)`. This is the closed disk `D` with the two open arcs `G` removed from its boundary.\n    *   Let `B = (S \\ D) U X`. This is the part of the square outside the disk `D`, plus the two closed arcs `X_1` and `X_2` on the boundary.\n\n4.  Let's check the conditions for these `A` and `B`.\n    *   **Is `A` closed?** Yes. `D` is closed, and `G` is a relatively open subset of its boundary. Removing it leaves a closed set.\n    *   **Is `A` connected?** Yes. It's path-connected. Any two points in `A` can be joined by paths that go through the center of the disk `D`.\n    *   **Is `B` closed?** Yes. Its complement, `Int(D) U G`, is open. So `B` is closed.\n    *   **Is `B` connected?** Yes. The set `S \\ D` is connected. The set `X` touches `S \\ D` along the entire length of `X`. So any point in `X` is connected to `S \\ D`. Thus, `B` is connected.\n    *   **Is `A U B = S`?** `A U B = (D \\ G) U (S \\ D) U X = (D \\ G) U X U (S \\ D)`. Since `X = C \\ G`, `(D \\ G) U X` is the entire disk `D`. So `A U B = D U (S \\ D) = S`. The union is the square.\n    *   **What is `A ∩ B`?** `A ∩ B = (D \\ G) ∩ ((S \\ D) U X)`. This intersection simplifies to `X`.\n\nSince our chosen `X` has two components (`X_1` and `X_2`), we have successfully constructed a valid pair of sets `A` and `B` whose intersection has **2** components.\n\n### Step 4: Generalizing the construction\nThis construction can be generalized to any finite number of components.\nFor any integer `n ≥ 1`:\n1.  Take a disk `D` inside the square `S`. Let its boundary be the circle `C`.\n2.  Decompose the circle `C` into `n` disjoint closed arcs `X_1, ..., X_n` and `n` disjoint open arcs `G_1, ..., G_n`.\n3.  Let `X = U_{i=1 to n} X_i`. This will be our intersection, with `n` components.\n4.  Define `A = D \\ (U G_i)`.\n5.  Define `B = (S \\ D) U X`.\nFollowing the same logic as in Step 3, these sets `A` and `B` satisfy all the required conditions, and their intersection is `A ∩ B = X`, which has `n` components.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nSince we can construct a valid example for *any* finite number of components `n`, there is no largest finite number. The number of components can be arbitrarily large. Therefore, there is no maximum number of components in the set of integers. The supremum of the possible number of components is infinity.\n\nIt is even possible to extend the construction to have a countably infinite, or even an uncountably infinite (with cardinality of the continuum) number of components, for instance by letting the intersection `X` be a Cantor set on the circle `C`.\n\nThe question asks for the \"largest number\". As there is no finite maximum, the answer is that the number of components can be arbitrarily large.\n\n<<<infinitely many>>>"
