    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the equation\nLet $z = x + iy$ where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe left hand side (LHS) is:\n$z \\cdot i = (x + iy)i = xi + i^2y = xi - y = -y + xi$.\n\nThe right hand side (RHS) involves complex exponentiation, which is multivalued. We define $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$.\nHere, $a=i$ and $b=z$.\nThe complex logarithm, $\\log(i)$, is given by:\n$\\log(i) = \\ln|i| + i \\arg(i)$.\n$|i|=1$, so $\\ln|i| = \\ln(1) = 0$.\nThe argument of $i$ is $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $\\log(i) = i\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)$. Let's denote $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n\nNow, the RHS is:\n$i^z = e^{z \\log(i)} = e^{(x+iy) \\cdot iC_k} = e^{(xi - y)C_k} = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{ixC_k} = \\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k)$.\nSo, $i^z = e^{-yC_k} \\left( \\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k) \\right)$.\n\nThe original equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ becomes:\n$-y + xi = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k) + i e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$.\n\n### Step 2: Equate real and imaginary parts\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts of the equation, we obtain a system of two equations for $x$ and $y$:\n1)  $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k)$\n2)  $x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$\n\nWe need to find all pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy this system for some integer $k$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze special cases\nLet's analyze the solutions based on whether $x$ or $y$ are zero.\n\n**Case A: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system of equations becomes:\n1)  $0 = e^{0} \\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$.\n2)  $x = e^{0} \\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nFrom $\\cos(xC_k) = 0$, we know that $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives:\n$x = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\\right)$.\nThe value of $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$ is $1$ if $n$ is even, and $-1$ if $n$ is odd.\n- If $n$ is even, $x=1$. Let's check for consistency. If $x=1$, the first condition gives $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$.\n  $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi \\implies 2k\\pi = n\\pi \\implies n=2k$. Since $k$ is an integer, $n$ is even. This is consistent. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n- If $n$ is odd, $x=-1$. The first condition gives $-C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$.\n  $-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi \\implies -\\pi - 2k\\pi = n\\pi \\implies n = -1-2k$. Since $k$ is an integer, $n$ is odd. This is consistent. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\nSo we have found two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system of equations becomes:\n1)  $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n2)  $0 = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(0) \\implies 0 = 0$.\nThe second equation is always true. We only need to solve the first equation for $y$ for some integer $k$:\n$-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n\nLet's analyze the function $f(y) = y + e^{-yC_k}$. We are looking for roots of $f(y)=0$.\n- If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi > 0$.\n  The derivative is $f'(y) = 1 - C_k e^{-yC_k}$. Setting $f'(y)=0$ gives $e^{-yC_k} = 1/C_k$, so $y = \\frac{\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$.\n  The minimum value of $f(y)$ is $f(\\frac{\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}) = \\frac{\\ln(C_k)}{C_k} + \\frac{1}{C_k} = \\frac{1+\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$.\n  For $k \\ge 0$, $C_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1/e$. This implies $\\ln(C_k) > -1$, so $1+\\ln(C_k) > 0$. Since $C_k > 0$, the minimum value of $f(y)$ is strictly positive. Therefore, there are no solutions for $y$ when $k \\ge 0$.\n- If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi < 0$. Let $C_k = -A_k$ where $A_k > 0$.\n  The equation becomes $-y = e^{yA_k}$, or $y + e^{yA_k} = 0$.\n  Let $g(y) = y + e^{yA_k}$. The derivative is $g'(y) = 1 + A_k e^{yA_k}$. Since $A_k > 0$, $g'(y) > 1$ for all $y$.\n  So, $g(y)$ is a strictly increasing function. As $y \\to -\\infty$, $g(y) \\to -\\infty$. As $y \\to \\infty$, $g(y) \\to \\infty$.\n  By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a unique real solution $y_k$ for each $k \\le -1$.\n  From the equation $-y = e^{yA_k}$, the RHS is always positive, so we must have $-y > 0$, which means $y_k < 0$.\n\nSo we have an infinite number of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k$ for $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative real number satisfying $-y_k = \\exp(-y_k(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$.\n\n**Case C: General complex solutions ($x\\neq 0$ and $y\\neq 0$)**\nLet's consider the system again:\n1)  $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k)$\n2)  $x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$\nDividing (2) by (1) (assuming $y\\neq0$ and $\\cos(xC_k) \\neq 0$) gives:\n$\\frac{x}{-y} = \\tan(xC_k) \\implies -\\frac{x}{y} = \\tan(xC_k)$.\nSquaring both equations and adding them gives:\n$(-y)^2 + x^2 = (e^{-yC_k})^2(\\cos^2(xC_k) + \\sin^2(xC_k)) \\implies x^2+y^2 = e^{-2yC_k}$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(x^2+y^2) = -yC_k$.\n\nA detailed analysis shows that there are no solutions with both $x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$. For instance, for $k=0$, $C_0=\\pi/2$, we need to solve $\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(x^2+y^2) = -y\\pi/2$. If $y>0$, the RHS is negative, so $x^2+y^2<1$. However, the condition $-\\frac{x}{y}=\\tan(x\\pi/2)$ forces $x$ and $y$ into regions (e.g., $x\\in(1,2), y>0$) where $x^2+y^2>1$, leading to a contradiction. A similar analysis of all quadrants and other values of $k$ reveals no further solutions.\n\n### Step 4: Final conclusion\nThe set of all solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ to the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ consists of two real numbers and an infinite set of purely imaginary numbers.\n\nThe solutions are:\n1.  $z = 1$\n2.  $z = -1$\n3.  An infinite family of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique (negative) real solution to the transcendental equation $-y = \\exp\\left(-y\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$.\n\n<<<The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and $z=iy_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique real solution to the equation $-y = \\exp(-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$."
