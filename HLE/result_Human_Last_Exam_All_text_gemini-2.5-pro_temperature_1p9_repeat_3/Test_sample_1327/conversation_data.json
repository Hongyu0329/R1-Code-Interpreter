    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the next number in the sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the sequence**\nThe given sequence of numbers is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple relationship between consecutive terms**\nLet's try to find a pattern based on multiplication and addition/subtraction, as the numbers are growing at a rate slightly faster than doubling. A common pattern for such sequences is `T(n) = a * T(n-1) + b`, where T(n) is the nth term. Let's test with `a=2`.\n\n*   To get from 2 to 11:\n    2 * 2 + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11\n*   To get from 11 to 23:\n    2 * 11 + 1 = 22 + 1 = 23\n*   To get from 23 to 51:\n    2 * 23 + 5 = 46 + 5 = 51\n*   To get from 51 to 119:\n    2 * 51 + 17 = 102 + 17 = 119\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the pattern found**\nThe pattern is `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + k_n`, where `k_n` is a sequence of numbers added at each step.\nThe sequence of added numbers `k` is {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}. To find the next term in the original sequence, we need to find the next number in this new sequence `k`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the pattern within the sequence `k`**\nThe sequence is `k = {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}`.\nThe first term, 7, seems to be an exception or an initial value. Let's analyze the pattern starting from the second term: `{1, 5, 17, ...}`.\n\nLet's find the differences between consecutive terms in this sub-sequence:\n*   5 - 1 = 4\n*   17 - 5 = 12\n\nThe differences are {4, 12}.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the pattern of the differences of `k`**\nThe sequence of differences is {4, 12}. This appears to be a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 to get the next term.\n*   4 * 3 = 12\n\n**Step 6: Predict the next term in the sequence of differences**\nFollowing the geometric progression, the next difference will be:\n*   12 * 3 = 36\n\n**Step 7: Use the predicted difference to find the next term in sequence `k`**\nThe next term in the sequence `k` will be the previous term (17) plus the next difference (36):\n*   Next `k` term = 17 + 36 = 53\n\n**Step 8: Use the next `k` term to find the missing number in the original sequence**\nThe next term in the original sequence, T(6), is `2 * T(5) + (next k term)`:\n*   T(6) = 2 * 119 + 53\n*   T(6) = 238 + 53\n*   T(6) = 291\n\nThe missing number in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
