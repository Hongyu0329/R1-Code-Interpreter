    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the starting material and reagents.**\n*   **Starting Material:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This is a benzene ring substituted with two groups: a tertiary amide, -C(=O)N(C₂H₅)₂, and a dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, located at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n*   **Reagents (First Step):** `sec-BuLi` (sec-Butyllithium), `TMEDA` (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine), and `THF` (tetrahydrofuran). This combination is characteristic of a Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM) reaction. `sec-BuLi` is a very strong base, and `TMEDA` is a ligand that chelates the lithium ion, increasing the basicity and directing ability of the base.\n*   **Reagent (Second Step):** `Methyl iodide` (CH₃I). This is a simple alkylating agent, which serves as an electrophile.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction (Directed Ortho-Metalation).**\nThe goal of this step is to deprotonate the most acidic proton on the starting material using the strong base `sec-BuLi`/`TMEDA`. In aromatic systems with suitable directing groups, protons at the ortho position become significantly more acidic.\n*   **Identify the directing groups:** There are two groups on the ring that can direct the lithiation: the tertiary amide group and the dimethylamino group.\n*   **Determine directing group strength:** Both groups can coordinate to the lithium ion via their lone pairs (on the carbonyl oxygen for the amide, and on the nitrogen for the amine), which directs the base to abstract a nearby ortho proton. The tertiary amide group, -C(=O)NR₂, is known to be one of the most powerful directing groups for ortho-metalation, much stronger than the amino group, -NR₂.\n*   **Determine the site of deprotonation:**\n    *   The amide group at position 1 directs deprotonation to its ortho positions (C2 and C6).\n    *   The dimethylamino group at position 3 directs deprotonation to its ortho positions (C2 and C4).\n    *   The proton at the C2 position is unique because it is ortho to *both* the powerful amide directing group and the secondary amine directing group. This is known as a **synergistic effect**. The combined directing influence of both groups makes the C2 proton the most acidic on the ring.\n    *   Therefore, the `sec-BuLi` will selectively remove the proton at the C2 position, forming a nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction (Electrophilic Quench).**\nThe aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a strong nucleophile. It is then reacted with the electrophile, methyl iodide.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The nucleophilic carbon atom at the C2 position of the ring attacks the electrophilic methyl carbon of CH₃I. This is a standard S_N2 reaction, where the iodide ion (I⁻) acts as the leaving group.\n*   **Result:** The lithium atom at the C2 position is replaced by a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the final product.**\nThe overall transformation is the regioselective substitution of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with a methyl group.\nThe resulting compound has the following structure: a benzene ring with an N,N-diethylcarboxamido group at C1, a methyl group at C2, and a dimethylamino group at C3.\n\nThe name of the final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
