    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria.**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, dissolves in pure water, it establishes multiple equilibria simultaneously.\n\n1.  **Dissolution of Al(OH)3:** The sparingly soluble salt dissolves to produce aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    `Al(OH)3 (s) <=> Al^3+ (aq) + 3 OH- (aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27)`\n\n2.  **Formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion:** The dissolved aluminum ions can react with hydroxide ions to form a soluble complex ion, Al(OH)4-.\n    `Al^3+ (aq) + 4 OH- (aq) <=> Al(OH)4- (aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the formation constant, K_f.\n    `K_f = [Al(OH)4-] / ([Al^3+][OH-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31`\n\n3.  **Autoionization of water:** Since the solvent is pure water, we must also consider its dissociation.\n    `H2O (l) <=> H+ (aq) + OH- (aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the ion product of water, Kw.\n    `Kw = [H+][OH-] = 1.0 * 10^(-14)`\n\n**Step 2: Define the molar solubility (S).**\nThe molar solubility, S, is defined as the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum species in the saturated solution.\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4-]`\n\n**Step 3: Establish the charge balance equation.**\nThe solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges. The ions in solution are `Al^3+`, `H+`, `OH-`, and `Al(OH)4-`.\n`3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH-] + [Al(OH)4-]`\n*(Note: The coefficient for [Al^3+] is 3 because it has a +3 charge).*\n\n**Step 4: Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH-].**\nWe can use the equilibrium constant expressions to relate the concentrations of the different species to the concentration of hydroxide ions, [OH-].\n\n*   From the K_sp expression:\n    `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3`\n\n*   From the K_f expression, substitute the expression for [Al^3+]:\n    `[Al(OH)4-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH-]^4 = K_f * (K_sp / [OH-]^3) * [OH-]^4 = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH-]`\n\n*   From the Kw expression:\n    `[H+] = Kw / [OH-]`\n\n**Step 5: Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation.**\nThis will give us a single equation with only one unknown, [OH-].\n`3 * (K_sp / [OH-]^3) + (Kw / [OH-]) = [OH-] + (K_sp * K_f) * [OH-]`\n\n**Step 6: Solve the equation for [OH-].**\nTo solve this equation, first multiply the entire equation by `[OH-]^3` to eliminate the fractions:\n`3*K_sp + Kw*[OH-]^2 = [OH-]^4 + (K_sp * K_f)*[OH-]^4`\n\nRearrange the equation into the form of a polynomial:\n`(1 + K_sp*K_f)*[OH-]^4 - Kw*[OH-]^2 - 3*K_sp = 0`\n\nThis equation is a quadratic equation in terms of `[OH-]^2`. Let `x = [OH-]^2`.\n`(1 + K_sp*K_f)*x^2 - Kw*x - 3*K_sp = 0`\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n*   K_sp = 5.3 * 10^(-27)\n*   K_f = 1.1 * 10^31\n*   Kw = 1.0 * 10^(-14)\n*   K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) * (1.1 * 10^31) = 5.83 * 10^4\n\nThe equation becomes:\n`(1 + 5.83 * 10^4)*x^2 - (1.0 * 10^-14)*x - 3*(5.3 * 10^-27) = 0`\n`58301 * x^2 - (1.0 * 10^-14) * x - 1.59 * 10^-26 = 0`\n\nWe solve for `x` using the quadratic formula `x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a`:\n`x = [ -(-1.0 * 10^-14) ± sqrt((-1.0 * 10^-14)^2 - 4(58301)(-1.59 * 10^-26)) ] / (2 * 58301)`\n`x = [ 1.0 * 10^-14 ± sqrt(1.0 * 10^-28 + 3.705 * 10^-21) ] / 116602`\nSince `3.705 * 10^-21` is much larger than `1.0 * 10^-28`, the expression under the square root simplifies to approximately `3.705 * 10^-21`.\n`x ≈ [ 1.0 * 10^-14 ± sqrt(3.705 * 10^-21) ] / 116602`\n`x ≈ [ 1.0 * 10^-14 ± 6.087 * 10^-11 ] / 116602`\n\nSince `x` (`[OH-]^2`) must be positive, we take the positive root:\n`x ≈ (1.0 * 10^-14 + 6.087 * 10^-11) / 116602 ≈ 6.088 * 10^-11 / 116602`\n`x ≈ 5.22 * 10^-16`\n\nNow, find [OH-]:\n`[OH-] = sqrt(x) = sqrt(5.22 * 10^-16) = 2.28 * 10^-8` mol L^-1\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species and the total solubility (S).**\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of [OH-], we can find the concentrations of the aluminum species.\n\n`[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH-]^3 = (5.3 * 10^-27) / (2.28 * 10^-8)^3 = 4.45 * 10^-4` mol L^-1\n\n`[Al(OH)4-] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.28 * 10^-8) = 1.33 * 10^-3` mol L^-1\n\nThe molar solubility `S` is the sum of these concentrations:\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4-] = (4.45 * 10^-4) + (1.33 * 10^-3) = 0.000445 + 0.00133 = 0.001775` mol L^-1\n`S = 1.78 * 10^-3` mol L^-1\n\n**Step 8: Final Answer**\nThe given constants have two significant figures. Therefore, the final answer should be rounded to two significant figures.\n`S = 1.8 * 10^-3` mol L^-1\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
