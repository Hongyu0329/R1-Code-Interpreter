    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\nThe goal is to find the maximum possible value of $|T|$, where $T$ is the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, with the additional constraint that $T$ must be a non-cyclic group. This requires knowledge of the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Classification Theorem\nThe structure of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields is a deep and well-studied problem. For quadratic fields, a complete classification is known. The primary reference for this classification is the paper \"Torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields\" by P. L. Clark, P. Etropolski, E. Gonzalez-Jimenez, √Å. Lozano-Robledo, and F. Najman (2017), which provides a definitive list of all possible torsion structures.\n\n### Step 3: List all Possible Non-Cyclic Torsion Subgroups over Quadratic Fields\nAccording to the classification mentioned above, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups, $T$, for an elliptic curve defined over *any* quadratic field are:\n1.  $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n2.  $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Orders of these Potential Groups\nNext, we calculate the order for each of these possible group structures to find the potential maximums.\n*   For the family $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$:\n    *   $N=1: |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}| = 4$\n    *   $N=2: |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}| = 8$\n    *   $N=3: |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}| = 12$\n    *   $N=4: |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}| = 16$\n    *   $N=5: |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}| = 20$\n    *   $N=6: |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}| = 24$\n*   For $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$: Order = 9.\n*   For $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$: Order = 16.\n\nFrom this list, the highest possible order is 24.\n\n### Step 5: Filter the List for the Specific Field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$\nThe existence of a given torsion group depends on the specific quadratic field. We must now determine which of these groups can be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This involves examining the conditions under which each torsion structure exists, which are detailed in the classification paper. The analysis is typically split based on whether the elliptic curve has Complex Multiplication (CM).\n\n#### Case A: Non-CM Elliptic Curves\nFor elliptic curves without complex multiplication, the classification theorem specifies which torsion groups can appear over which quadratic fields.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 24): This group can only be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(i)$. Thus, it is not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 20): This group can only be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$ or $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$. It is not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   The groups $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ are all possible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (by Mazur's Theorem). An elliptic curve defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be viewed as a curve over any extension field, including $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Thus, these torsion groups are all possible over $K$. The largest among these is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 16.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16): This group is only possible over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(i)$.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9): For non-CM curves, this is only possible over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ or $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$.\n\nThe maximum order for a non-cyclic torsion group of a non-CM elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 16.\n\n#### Case B: CM Elliptic Curves\nLet $E$ be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by an order in a quadratic field $K_{CM}$.\n*   If $K_{CM} \\neq K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$: The possible torsion subgroups are essentially restricted to those that appear over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The largest non-cyclic torsion group is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, with order 16.\n*   If $K_{CM} = K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$: This implies that the $j$-invariant of the elliptic curve must be $j=0$. For this specific situation ($j=0$ and $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$), the classification theorem states that the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 12)\n    The largest order in this subcase is 12.\n\n### Step 6: Conclude the Final Answer\nBy comparing the maximum orders from all possible cases:\n*   Non-CM curves: Maximum order is 16.\n*   CM curves with $K_{CM} \\neq K$: Maximum order is 16.\n*   CM curves with $K_{CM} = K$: Maximum order is 12.\n\nThe overall largest possible order is the maximum of {16, 16, 12}, which is 16. This order is achieved by the group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. This group is known to be the torsion subgroup of some elliptic curves defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and for these curves, the torsion does not grow upon extension to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nThe largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
