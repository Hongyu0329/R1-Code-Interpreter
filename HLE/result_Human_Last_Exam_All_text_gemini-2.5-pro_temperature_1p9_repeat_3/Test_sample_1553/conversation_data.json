    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Novel and Protagonist:** The question refers to the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) written by Jacek Dukaj. The main character of this novel is Adam Zamoyski, a man from our times who is cryogenically preserved and reawakened in the 29th century.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The question asks for the name of the character that Adam Zamoyski marries.\n\n3.  **Examine the Novel's Plot and Concepts:** In the complex, post-human world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" traditional human concepts like marriage do not exist in the same way. The beings in this future have evolved far beyond conventional biology and social structures. Relationships and unions are of a different nature.\n\n4.  **Identify the Key Relationship:** Throughout the story, Adam Zamoyski's most significant and intimate relationship is with a post-human entity (a \"stahs\") named Angelina. She serves as his guide, protector, and companion.\n\n5.  **Determine the Nature of their Union:** Instead of a traditional marriage ceremony, Adam and Angelina's relationship culminates in a far more profound union. Towards the end of the novel, in order to survive and evolve, they merge their consciousnesses and beings. They physically and mentally fuse into a single, more powerful entity.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** This act of fusion is the narrative's equivalent of a permanent and absolute marriage. Therefore, the character that the main character \"marries,\" in the context of the story, is Angelina.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   The term \"marries\" is a simplification. The actual event in the book is a metaphysical and physical fusion of two beings into one.\n*   The world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a \"hard sci-fi\" setting, meaning concepts are explored in a complex, scientifically-grounded (though speculative) way. A simple social custom like marriage from our time would not directly translate.\n*   The relationship between Adam and Angelina is central to the plot and Adam's development in this alien future.\n\nBased on this analysis, the name of the character is Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
