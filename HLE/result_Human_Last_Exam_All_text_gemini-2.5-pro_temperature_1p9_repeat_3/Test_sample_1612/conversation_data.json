    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to determine the total number of unique players who have won the Major League Baseball (MLB) batting Triple Crown.\n\n2.  **Define the \"Triple Crown\":** In MLB, the batting Triple Crown is a prestigious achievement for a hitter who leads their respective league (either the American League or National League) in three specific statistical categories in the same season:\n    *   Batting Average (BA)\n    *   Home Runs (HR)\n    *   Runs Batted In (RBI)\n\n3.  **Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   **Two Separate Leagues:** A player must lead their *own* league (AL or NL) in all three categories, not the entire MLB.\n    *   **Unique Winners vs. Total Wins:** The question asks \"how many winners are there,\" which implies counting the number of unique players, not the total number of times the Triple Crown has been won. Some players have won it more than once.\n    *   **Historical Context:** MLB officially recognizes winners from its precursor leagues, such as the American Association. These must be included in the count.\n    *   **Pitching vs. Batting:** There is also a Pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts). The question implicitly refers to the more common and well-known batting Triple Crown.\n\n4.  **List the Winners by League:** We will compile a list of all winners, organized by the American League and National League (including its predecessors).\n\n    **American League (AL) Winners:**\n    *   Nap Lajoie (1901)\n    *   Ty Cobb (1909)\n    *   Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n    *   Lou Gehrig (1934)\n    *   **Ted Williams** (1942 and 1947) - *Won twice*\n    *   Mickey Mantle (1956)\n    *   Frank Robinson (1966)\n    *   Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n    *   Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n\n    **National League (NL) and Predecessors Winners:**\n    *   Paul Hines (1878)\n    *   Tip O'Neill (1887) - *Won in the American Association, a recognized major league*\n    *   Hugh Duffy (1894)\n    *   Heinie Zimmerman (1912)\n    *   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922 and 1925) - *Won twice*\n    *   Chuck Klein (1933)\n    *   Joe Medwick (1937)\n\n5.  **Count the Unique Players:** Now, we count the number of individual players from the lists above, being careful not to double-count players who won more than once.\n\n    *   **Unique AL Winners:** Nap Lajoie, Ty Cobb, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski, Miguel Cabrera.\n        *   **Total = 9 players**\n    *   **Unique NL Winners:** Paul Hines, Tip O'Neill, Hugh Duffy, Heinie Zimmerman, Rogers Hornsby, Chuck Klein, Joe Medwick.\n        *   **Total = 7 players**\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** To find the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we add the number of unique winners from each league.\n    *   Total Unique Winners = (Unique AL Winners) + (Unique NL Winners)\n    *   Total Unique Winners = 9 + 7 = 16\n\n### Final Answer\nThere have been 16 unique players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<16>>>"
