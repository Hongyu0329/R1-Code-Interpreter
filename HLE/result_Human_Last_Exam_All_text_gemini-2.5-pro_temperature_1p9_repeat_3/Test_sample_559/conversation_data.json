    "**1. System and Coordinates**\n\nThe given system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\nLet's use the standard phase plane notation $(x, y)$ where $x = u$ and $y = d$. The system becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = 2y^2 + (5x^2-3x)y - x^3(1-x) $$\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2(x-1) $$\nWe are analyzing the system for $u \\ge 0$, which corresponds to the right half-plane $x \\ge 0$.\n\n**2. Find Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points are where $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$.\nFrom $\\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2(x-1) = 0$, we find $x=0$ or $x=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: x = 0**\n    Substituting $x=0$ into the equation for $\\frac{dy}{dt}$:\n    $2y^2 + (0)y - 0 = 0 \\implies 2y^2 = 0 \\implies y=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: x = 1**\n    Substituting $x=1$ into the equation for $\\frac{dy}{dt}$:\n    $2y^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))y - 1^3(1-1) = 0$\n    $2y^2 + 2y = 0 \\implies 2y(y+1) = 0 \\implies y=0$ or $y=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the region $x \\ge 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**3. Classify the Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe use the Jacobian matrix to classify the hyperbolic equilibrium points. Let $F(x,y) = x^3 - x^2$ and $G(x,y) = 2y^2 + (5x^2-3x)y - x^3+x^4$.\nThe Jacobian is $J(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3x^2-2x & 0 \\\\ (10x-3)y-3x^2+4x^3 & 4y+5x^2-3x \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2-2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(0)-3+4 & 4(0)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = 2$. Both are positive, so $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2-2(1) & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1)-3+4 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive, this is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point.\n\n**4. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of qualitatively different behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are always separatrices. We will find these manifolds for the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n\nLet's find the eigenvectors for $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n*   For the unstable manifold (eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$):\n    $(J-I)\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies -6v_x-3v_y=0 \\implies v_y = -2v_x$.\n    The eigenvector is $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The unstable manifold is tangent to the line with slope -2 at $(1,-1)$.\n\n*   For the stable manifold (eigenvalue $\\lambda_2=-2$):\n    $(J+2I)\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies 3v_x=0 \\implies v_x=0$.\n    The eigenvector is $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The stable manifold is tangent to the vertical line at $(1,-1)$.\n\nThe problem now is to find the equation for the separatrix. We will search for a simple algebraic invariant curve, which is a curve that is a union of trajectories. Let's test if a curve of the form $y = -x^2$ is an invariant curve. This is motivated by trying to find a simple curve passing through $(0,0)$ and $(1,-1)$.\n\nTo check if $y(t) = -[x(t)]^2$ is a solution, we must verify that it satisfies the system's dynamics. This means $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ computed from the curve's equation must match the $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ from the system's equation.\nFrom $y=-x^2$, we get $\\frac{dy}{dt} = -2x \\frac{dx}{dt}$ by the chain rule.\nSubstituting $\\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2(x-1)$:\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = -2x (x^2(x-1)) = -2x^4 + 2x^3$.\n\nNow let's compute $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ from the system equation by substituting $y=-x^2$:\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = 2(-x^2)^2 + (5x^2-3x)(-x^2) - x^3(1-x)$\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = 2x^4 - 5x^4 + 3x^3 - x^3 + x^4$\n$\\frac{dy}{dt} = -2x^4 + 2x^3$.\n\nBoth expressions for $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ are identical. Thus, the parabola $y=-x^2$ (or $d=-u^2$) is an invariant curve.\n\nNow we check if this corresponds to a manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\nThe curve $y=-x^2$ passes through $(1,-1)$ since $-1 = -(1)^2$.\nThe slope of the curve is $\\frac{dy}{dx} = -2x$. At $x=1$, the slope is $-2$.\nThis slope matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_1 = (1, -2)^T$.\nTherefore, the curve $y=-x^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$, written as $W^u(1,-1)$.\n\nThis unstable manifold is a separatrix. Given its explicit and non-trivial form, it is the most likely intended answer for \"the separatrix\". The other separatrix, the stable manifold $W^s(1,-1)$, can be shown to be the ray $\\{(u,d) | u=1, d<0\\}$. The question asks for a single separatrix. The unstable manifold is the more dynamically significant one in this context, as it includes a heteroclinic orbit connecting the saddle $(1,-1)$ to the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nThe equation for the separatrix is $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
