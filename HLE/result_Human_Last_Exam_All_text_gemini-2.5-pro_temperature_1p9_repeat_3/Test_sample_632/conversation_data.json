    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome (the square in front of the Pantheon).\n*   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n*   **Action:** Removed by the city administration.\n*   **Date:** 1950.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Clues and Eliminate Possibilities**\n*   The feature is in the *square*, not on the Pantheon church itself. This eliminates the famous twin bell towers of the Pantheon (nicknamed \"the donkey's ears\"), which were removed much earlier, in the 1890s.\n*   The feature existed until 1950. The well-known and chaotic food and fish market that dominated the square for centuries was cleared out in the late 19th century, also much earlier than 1950.\n*   The term \"architectural feature\" might not mean a building in the traditional sense, but could refer to a significant element of urban design or infrastructure that defines the space.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate Changes in Rome around 1950**\n*   The mid-20th century was a period of major modernization for many European cities, including Rome. A significant change during this time was the overhaul of public transportation systems.\n*   Many cities, Rome included, began dismantling their extensive electric tram networks to favor buses and private automobile traffic.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific Feature in Piazza della Rotonda**\n*   Historical photographs and city plans from the first half of the 20th century show that a tram line ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda.\n*   The \"unique\" aspect of this feature was its layout. The tram track did not simply pass through the side of the square; it formed a distinct circular loop around the central monumentâ€”the Fontana del Pantheon (the fountain with the obelisk).\n*   This circular track was a defining characteristic of the square for decades, with trams constantly circling the historic fountain.\n\n**Step 5: Confirm the Removal**\n*   As part of the post-war modernization and the move away from street-level trams in the city center, this specific line and its circular track were decommissioned and removed. Historical records confirm this removal occurred right around 1950.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe unique feature that was present in the Piazza della Rotonda until its removal in 1950 was the circular tram track that looped around the central fountain.\n\n<<<A circular tram track>>>"
