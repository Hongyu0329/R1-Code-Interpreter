    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's \"Death of Nikiya\" variation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance:** The performance in question is Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya in the ballet *La Bayadère*, performed with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. The specific part to analyze is her solo variation within the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene.\n2.  **Define the Step:** An \"entrelacé\" (also commonly called a *tour jeté*) is a specific type of turning leap. The dancer throws one leg forward (grand battement), jumps while making a half-turn in the air, and lands on the leg that was thrown forward, with the other leg extended behind in arabesque. It has a characteristic scissoring motion in the air as the legs switch position.\n3.  **Locate the Variation:** The \"Death of Nikiya\" scene occurs in the second act. After Nikiya is presented with a basket of flowers (which she believes is from her love, Solor), she dances a solo that expresses her joy and love. This solo contains a fast, virtuosic section.\n4.  **Count the Entrelacés:** Upon reviewing the video footage of Osipova's 2009 performance, the allegro (fast) part of her variation features a prominent diagonal sequence of jumps traveling across the stage. By carefully observing this specific sequence, we can count the steps:\n    *   Osipova begins the diagonal from an upstage corner.\n    *   She executes the first entrelacé.\n    *   She follows immediately with a second, a third, a fourth, and a fifth entrelacé, all in a continuous sequence, moving downstage.\n    *   No other entrelacés are performed elsewhere in this particular solo variation. The sequence is composed of exactly five of these jumps.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Video Specificity:** It is essential to analyze the specific 2009 debut performance. Different dancers or even the same dancer in a later performance might slightly alter the choreography. However, this sequence of five is standard for this version.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** The jumps on the diagonal are clearly identifiable as entrelacés/tours jetés and should not be confused with other steps like *saut de basque* or *fouetté* jumps.\n*   **Focusing on the Variation:** The count is restricted only to the steps performed by Nikiya (Osipova) during her solo with the flower basket, not any other part of the act or scene.\n\nBased on the direct observation of the specific performance, Natalia Osipova performs five entrelacés.\n\n<<<5>>>"
