    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. For example, a closed interval `[0, 1]` or a circle `S¹`.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `Comp(p)`, is the set of all points `q` in `X` for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `p` and `q`. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to `X` itself.\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum that can be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n\n### Step 2: The Relationship Between Decomposability and the Number of Composants\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory that connects the decomposability of a continuum to its number of composants:\n\n*   **Theorem 1:** A continuum `X` is **decomposable** if and only if it has exactly **one** composant. In this case, the single composant is the space `X` itself.\n*   **Theorem 2:** A continuum `X` is **indecomposable** if and only if it has **uncountably many** composants. More precisely, it has `c` (the cardinality of the continuum, `2^ℵ₀`) distinct composants. Each composant is dense in `X`, and the set of all composants forms a partition of `X`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Product of Two Continua\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. We are interested in their product, `Z = X × Y`. The product of two continua is also a continuum. The crucial question is whether `Z` is decomposable or indecomposable. This is determined by the properties of `X` and `Y`.\n\n*   **Theorem 3:** The product `X × Y` of two continua is **decomposable** if and only if at least one of the factor spaces, `X` or `Y`, is decomposable.\n*   **Corollary:** The product `X × Y` is **indecomposable** if and only if both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Possible Number of Composants for `X × Y`\n\nWe can now explore the different scenarios based on the nature of `X` and `Y` to find the largest possible number of composants for their product.\n\n**Case A: At least one factor is decomposable.**\nLet's choose `X` to be a decomposable continuum. A simple example of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum is the closed interval `I = [0, 1]`. Let `Y` be any nondegenerate continuum (it can be decomposable or indecomposable).\nAccording to Theorem 3, since `X` is decomposable, the product `Z = X × Y` is also decomposable.\nNow, using Theorem 1, since `Z` is a decomposable continuum, it has exactly **one** composant.\nFor example, if `X = Y = [0, 1]`, then `Z = [0, 1] × [0, 1]` is the unit square, which is decomposable and has only one composant.\n\n**Case B: Both factors are indecomposable.**\nTo maximize the number of composants, we should try to make the product `Z = X × Y` indecomposable. According to the Corollary of Theorem 3, this requires both `X` and `Y` to be indecomposable continua.\nNondegenerate indecomposable continua exist. Famous examples include the **pseudo-arc** and the **solenoid**.\nLet `X` be a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum, and let `Y` be another nondegenerate indecomposable continuum.\nThen, the product space `Z = X × Y` is an indecomposable continuum.\nNow, applying Theorem 2, since `Z` is an indecomposable continuum, it has **`c`** (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the two cases, we have found that the number of composants of the product `X × Y` can be:\n1.  **1**, if at least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable.\n2.  **`c`** (the cardinality of the continuum), if both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible number* of composants. Comparing the two possible outcomes, `c` is infinitely larger than 1. Therefore, the largest possible number of composants is `c`."
