    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a point `(x, y, z)` that simultaneously satisfies a system of three equations involving three functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. The conditions for the existence (and typically, uniqueness) of such a point are established by extending the principles of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to a system of operators on a product space.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the components:**\n    *   **Spaces:** Three non-empty sets `X`, `Y`, `Z`.\n    *   **Functions:** `F: X × Y × Z → X`, `G: Y × X × Y → Y`, and `H: Z × Y × X → Z`. (Note: The question listed `G` twice; it is standard to assume the third function is `H`. The domains and codomains are noted as given).\n    *   **Objective:** Find the conditions for the existence of an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\".\n\n2.  **Define \"FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\":** Based on the function signatures, an FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z` that satisfies the following system of equations:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    *   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n3.  **Formulate the Theoretical Framework:** The problem can be solved by defining a single operator `T` on the product space `W = X × Y × Z`. A fixed point of `T` will correspond to the FGH-tripled fixed point. We can then apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to `T`.\n    *   Define the operator `T: W → W` as:\n        `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n    *   A fixed point of `T` is a point `(x,y,z)` such that `T(x,y,z) = (x,y,z)`, which is precisely the system of equations we need to solve.\n\n4.  **Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem:** This theorem states that a contraction mapping on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point. This gives us the two main conditions we need.\n    *   **Condition 1:** The domain `W` must be a complete metric space.\n    *   **Condition 2:** The operator `T` must be a contraction mapping on `W`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Typo Correction:** The question states `G` twice. We assume this is a typo and the third function is `H: Z × Y × X → Z`.\n2.  **Unusual Function Arguments:** The arguments for `G` (`Y × X × Y`) and `H` (`Z × Y × X`) are non-standard compared to typical tripled fixed-point literature where arguments are cyclically permuted `(x,y,z), (y,z,x), (z,x,y)`. The analysis must strictly adhere to the given function signatures.\n3.  **Product Metric:** To make `W = X × Y × Z` a metric space, we must define a metric on it. A standard choice that simplifies analysis is the sum metric or the max metric. We will use a generalized approach that leads to a condition applicable to several standard metrics.\n4.  **Derivation of Contraction:** The core of the analysis is deriving the condition on the constants of the individual functions (`F`, `G`, `H`) that ensures the combined operator `T` is a contraction.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**Step 1: Condition on the Spaces `X`, `Y`, `Z`**\n\nFor the product space `W = X × Y × Z` to be a complete metric space (a requirement for the Banach theorem), the individual spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must each be a complete metric space. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n\n**Step 2: Condition on the Functions `F`, `G`, `H`**\n\nFor the operator `T` to be a contraction, there must exist a constant `k`, where `0 ≤ k < 1`, such that for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `W`:\n`d_W(T(x₁, y₁, z₁), T(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ k * d_W((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂))`\n\nLet's assume the functions F, G, and H are Lipschitz-continuous in their arguments. This means there exist non-negative constants such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`:\n\na) `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁·d_X(x₁, x₂) + b₁·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₁·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\nb) `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ a₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂·d_X(x₁, x₂)` (Note the arguments are `(y, x, y)`)\n\nc) `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ a₃·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + b₃·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₃·d_X(x₁, x₂)` (Note the arguments are `(z, y, x)`)\n\nNow, let's analyze the contraction condition for `T` using the sum metric on `W`, `d_W((u₁,v₁,w₁),(u₂,v₂,w₂)) = d_X(u₁,u₂) + d_Y(v₁,v₂) + d_Z(w₁,w₂)`:\n\n`d_W(T(x₁, y₁, z₁), T(x₂, y₂, z₂))`\n`= d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n\nSubstituting the inequalities from a), b), and c):\n`≤ [a₁·d_X(x₁,x₂) + b₁·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + c₁·d_Z(z₁,z₂)] + [a₂·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + b₂·d_X(x₁,x₂)] + [a₃·d_Z(z₁,z₂) + b₃·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + c₃·d_X(x₁,x₂)]`\n\nGroup the terms by `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`:\n`= (a₁ + b₂ + c₃)·d_X(x₁,x₂) + (b₁ + a₂ + b₃)·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (c₁ + a₃)·d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, this entire expression must be less than or equal to `k * [d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂)]` for some `k < 1`. A sufficient condition for this is:\n*   `a₁ + b₂ + c₃ ≤ k`\n*   `b₁ + a₂ + b₃ ≤ k`\n*   `c₁ + a₃ ≤ k`\n\nThis can be summarized as `max { (a₁ + b₂ + c₃), (b₁ + a₂ + b₃), (c₁ + a₃) } < 1`.\n\n***\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\nThe sufficient conditions for the functions `F: X×Y×Z → X`, `G: Y×X×Y → Y`, and `H: Z×Y×X → Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n**1. Condition on Spaces (Topological):**\nThe sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **complete metric spaces**.\n\n**2. Condition on Functions (Contractive):**\nThere must exist non-negative constants (`a₁, b₁, c₁`), (`a₂, b₂`), and (`a₃, b₃, c₃`) that satisfy two requirements:\n\n**(i) Lipschitz-type Inequalities:** For all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`:\n*   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁·d_X(x₁, x₂) + b₁·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₁·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n*   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ a₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n*   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ a₃·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + b₃·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₃·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\n**(ii) Overall Contraction:** The sum of the coefficients associated with each space's metric must be less than 1. Specifically:\n`max { (a₁ + b₂ + c₃), (b₁ + a₂ + b₃), (c₁ + a₃) } < 1`\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n1.  **(Completeness of Spaces):** The underlying sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces.\n2.  **(Contractive Mapping Condition):** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must jointly satisfy a contraction condition. Specifically, there must exist non-negative constants `a₁, b₁, c₁, a₂, b₂, a₃, b₃, c₃` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁·d_X(x₁, x₂) + b₁·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₁·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ a₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ a₃·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + b₃·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₃·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n    \n    And the sums of these constants must be less than 1 when grouped by their corresponding metric component:\n    `max { (a₁ + b₂ + c₃), (b₁ + a₂ + b₃), (c₁ + a₃) } < 1`>>>"
