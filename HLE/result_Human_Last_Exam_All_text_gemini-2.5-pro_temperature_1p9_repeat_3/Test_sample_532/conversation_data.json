    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's understand the terms used in the question.\n\n*   **Finite Nilpotent Group (G):** A finite group that is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. So, if `|G| = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}`, then `G \\cong P_1 \\times P_2 \\times \\cdots \\times P_k`, where `P_i` is the unique Sylow `p_i`-subgroup of `G`.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A non-empty subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any elements `a, b \\in S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `ab` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S \\cdot S \\cap S = \\emptyset`.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPF Set):** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called a filled group if the union of all its MIPF sets covers the entire group.\n\n### Step 2: Refining the Definition of a Filled Group\n\nA crucial observation about product-free sets is that they cannot contain the identity element, `e`. If `e \\in S`, then `e \\cdot e = e`, which is in `S`. This violates the product-free condition `S \\cdot S \\cap S = \\emptyset`.\n\nTherefore, any product-free set `S` is a subset of `G \\setminus \\{e\\}`, and the union of all MIPF sets is also a subset of `G \\setminus \\{e\\}`. For the union to \"fill G\", it must be interpreted as filling `G \\setminus \\{e\\}`. Thus, the definition of a filled group becomes:\n**A group G is filled if `\\bigcup_{S \\text{ is a MIPF}} S = G \\setminus \\{e\\}`.**\n\nThis means that for every non-identity element `g \\in G`, there must exist at least one MIPF set containing `g`.\n\n### Step 3: Utilizing the known classification of Finite Filled Groups\n\nThe classification of finite filled groups is a known, albeit recent, result in group theory. A key theorem by V. Vsemirnov states:\n\n**Theorem:** A finite group `G` is filled if and only if it does not contain a subgroup `K` isomorphic to `H \\rtimes C_3`, where `H` is a non-trivial abelian group, and the generator of `C_3` acts on `H` by inversion (i.e., for `z` generating `C_3` and `h \\in H`, `zhz^{-1} = h^{-1}`).\n\nWe need to apply this theorem to the specific case where `G` is a finite nilpotent group.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Classification to Nilpotent Groups\n\nLet `G` be a finite nilpotent group. According to the theorem, `G` is **not** filled if it contains a subgroup `K` of the specified form.\n\n1.  **Subgroups of nilpotent groups are nilpotent.** If `G` is nilpotent and `K \\le G`, then `K` must also be nilpotent.\n\n2.  **When is `K = H \\rtimes C_3` nilpotent?** Let the action be inversion. The lower central series of `K` can be computed. `[K,K]` is generated by elements of the form `[h,z] = hzh^{-1}z^{-1} = h(zh^{-1}z^{-1}) = h(h^{-1})^{-1} = h^2`. So, `[K,K] = H^2 = \\{h^2 | h \\in H\\}`. Similarly, the next term in the series is `[K, H^2] = H^4`, and so on. The series is `K \\supseteq H^2 \\supseteq H^4 \\supseteq H^8 \\supseteq \\dots`. For `K` to be nilpotent, this series must terminate at `{e}`, which means `H^{2^m} = \\{e\\}` for some `m`. This implies that every element in `H` must have an order which is a power of 2. In other words, `H` must be an abelian 2-group (a `p`-group with `p=2`).\n\n3.  **The structure of `K` inside a nilpotent group.** So, `G` (nilpotent) is not filled if it contains a nilpotent subgroup `K = H \\rtimes C_3` where `H` is a non-trivial abelian 2-group and the action is inversion. Since `G` is nilpotent, its Sylow subgroups are normal, and it is their direct product. `H` is a 2-group and `C_3` is a 3-group. They must be contained in the Sylow 2-subgroup (`P_2`) and Sylow 3-subgroup (`P_3`) of `G`, respectively. In a nilpotent group, elements from Sylow subgroups of different primes commute. Therefore, the action of `C_3` on `H` must be trivial.\n\n4.  **Reconciling the action.** The action is required to be inversion (`zhz^{-1} = h^{-1}`), but we deduced it must be trivial (`zhz^{-1} = h`). For these to be the same, we must have `h = h^{-1}` for all `h \\in H`, which means `h^2 = e` for all `h \\in H`. This means `H` must be an abelian group of exponent 2.\n\n5.  **Final condition for a nilpotent group to be non-filled.** A finite nilpotent group `G` is not filled if and only if it contains a subgroup `K = H \\times C_3`, where `H` is a non-trivial abelian group of exponent 2.\n\n### Step 5: Characterizing the Finite Filled Nilpotent Groups\n\nFor such a subgroup `K = H \\times C_3` to exist, two conditions must be met:\na.  `G` must contain a non-trivial abelian subgroup `H` of exponent 2. Any non-trivial finite 2-group `P_2` contains an element of order 2, which generates a subgroup `C_2` that satisfies this condition. Thus, this is equivalent to `G` having a non-trivial Sylow 2-subgroup (i.e., `|G|` is divisible by 2).\nb.  `G` must contain a subgroup isomorphic to `C_3`. This is equivalent to `G` having a non-trivial Sylow 3-subgroup (i.e., `|G|` is divisible by 3).\n\nSince in a nilpotent group `G = P_2 \\times P_3 \\times \\dots`, a subgroup `H \\le P_2` and `C_3 \\le P_3` will commute, forming the direct product `H \\times C_3` as a subgroup of `G`.\n\nTherefore, a finite nilpotent group `G` is **not filled** if and only if its order is divisible by both 2 and 3, i.e., divisible by 6.\n\nThis leads to the final characterization:\n\n**A finite nilpotent group `G` is a filled group if and only if its order is not divisible by 6.**\n\nThis can be stated in terms of Sylow subgroups: A finite nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if its Sylow 2-subgroup is trivial or its Sylow 3-subgroup is trivial.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe finite filled nilpotent groups are all finite nilpotent groups `G` such that the order of `G` is not divisible by 6.\n\n<<<The finite filled nilpotent groups are the finite nilpotent groups whose order is not divisible by 6.>>>"
