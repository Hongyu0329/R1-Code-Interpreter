    "This is a question about pre-flop opening ranges in No-Limit Hold'em, specifically from the button position. To answer it correctly, we need to consider several key factors.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Position: The Button (BTN)**\n    *   The button is the most powerful position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street (flop, turn, river).\n    *   This positional advantage allows you to play the widest range of hands profitably compared to any other position. A primary goal of opening from the button is to \"steal the blinds\" (the Small Blind and Big Blind) and win the pot pre-flop.\n\n2.  **Game Conditions: 100BB deep, Rake-Free**\n    *   **100BB:** This is the standard stack depth for cash games, meaning strategies are well-established.\n    *   **Rake-Free:** This is a critical detail. In most poker games, the house takes a small percentage of the pot (the rake). Rake reduces the profitability of playing marginal hands. In a rake-free game, even very marginal hands become more profitable to play because you get to realize 100% of your equity when you win the pot. This significantly widens our profitable opening range.\n\n3.  **The Question: \"Worst suited jack you should open\"**\n    *   This asks for the weakest hand of the form `JXs` (Jack-X suited) that is still considered a standard, profitable open-raise from the button under these conditions.\n    *   We need to rank all possible suited jack hands from best to worst and find the one at the bottom of the opening range.\n\n4.  **Ranking Suited Jack Hands (JXs)**\n    *   The hands are: JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n    *   Hands are valued based on high-card strength, connectivity (ability to make straights), and suitedness (ability to make flushes). All these hands are suited, so we focus on high-card value and connectivity.\n    *   **Top Tier (Premium):** JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs. These have high-card strength and/or excellent connectivity. They are always opened from any position.\n    *   **Mid Tier (Strong):** J9s, J8s, J7s. These are strong suited connectors and gappers that play well post-flop. They are standard opens from the button.\n    *   **Bottom Tier (Marginal):** J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s. These hands have a weaker kicker and poor connectivity (large gaps between the cards), reducing their straight potential. The value comes mostly from making a flush or a pair of jacks with a weak kicker.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Cutoff Point**\n    *   Given the power of the button and the rake-free environment, the opening range is extremely wide. A standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategy would advocate for opening *all* suited hands from the button in a rake-free game.\n    *   The incentive to steal 1.5 big blinds, combined with the post-flop playability of any two suited cards from the best position, makes even the weakest suited hands a profitable open.\n    *   Therefore, the \"worst\" suited jack you *should* open is simply the weakest suited jack that exists, as it is still part of this optimal, wide opening range.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy ranking the suited jack hands from best to worst, the hand with the lowest raw equity is `J2s`. It has the biggest gap (making straights very difficult) and the lowest kicker. In a rake-free game from the button, every suited hand is considered a profitable open-raise. Thus, the worst one on the list that you should still open is `J2s`.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
