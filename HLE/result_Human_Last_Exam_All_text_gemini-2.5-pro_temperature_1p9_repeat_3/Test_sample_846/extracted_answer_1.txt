To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape in response to sunlight.

**At sunrise:** When exposed to the sun's UV light, the table should convert from its stable, elongated *trans* form to a bent and more compact *cis* form. Essentially, it should contract or bend.

**At sunset:** In the absence of light, the table should thermally relax, changing from the bent *cis* form back to the stable, elongated *trans* form. Essentially, it should straighten out and lengthen.
