The edges are first smoothed by rounding off sharp corners. Then, the boundaries of any finite shapes begin to move inwards, causing the shapes to shrink. As $t \rightarrow \infty$, this shrinking continues until all finite shapes (and thus all edges) are eliminated, and the image converges to a uniform state of either all black or all white.
