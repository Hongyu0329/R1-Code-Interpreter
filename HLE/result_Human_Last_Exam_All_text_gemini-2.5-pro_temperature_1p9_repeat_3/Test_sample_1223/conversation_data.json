    "Answering this question requires combining several key results from the field of continuum theory.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the objects in the question:**\n    *   **Space X:** We start with a space $X$ which is a *hereditary indecomposable metric continuum*.\n        *   A *continuum* is a compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n        *   *Indecomposable* means $X$ cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n        *   *Hereditary indecomposable* means every subcontinuum of $X$ is also indecomposable. A famous example is the pseudo-arc.\n    *   **Composants of X:** In any indecomposable continuum, a *composant* of a point $p$ is the set of all points $q$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both $p$ and $q$. The composants partition the space. A fundamental result by Stefan Mazurkiewicz states that any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum (and thus $X$) has exactly $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum) distinct composants.\n    *   **The Punctured Space:** We then consider the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ for some point $x \\in X$. Since $X$ is a compact metric space, $Y$ is a locally compact, non-compact, separable, and $\\sigma$-compact metric space.\n    *   **The Stone-Cech Remainder:** We are interested in the Stone-Cech remainder of $Y$, which is denoted by $Y^*$ or $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$. This remainder is a compact Hausdorff space.\n\n2.  **Identify the nature of the Stone-Cech remainder:**\n    *   The structure of the remainder $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is deeply connected to the structure of the original continuum $X$.\n    *   A cornerstone theorem by David P. Bellamy (1971) asserts that if $X$ is an indecomposable continuum and $x \\in X$, then its remainder $Y^*$ is also an indecomposable continuum. (Note: A continuum in this more general setting is a compact, connected Hausdorff space; it is not necessarily metric).\n    *   So, the object whose composants we must count — the Stone-Cech remainder $Y^*$ — is itself an indecomposable continuum.\n\n3.  **Count the composants of the remainder:**\n    *   Now the question transforms into: \"How many composants does the indecomposable continuum $Y^*$ have?\".\n    *   While general non-metric indecomposable continua can have any number of composants (any cardinal $\\ge 2$, by a result of H. Cook), the remainder $Y^*$ is a very specific type of non-metric continuum. Its properties are determined by $X$.\n    *   A crucial, more recent theorem by M. Krupski and P. Mynesi (2018) provides the final piece of the puzzle. Their result states that for any indecomposable continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, there exists a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) between the set of composants of the remainder $Y^*$ and the set of composants of $X$ that do not contain the point $x$.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Let $\\text{Comp}(K)$ denote the set of composants of a continuum $K$. The Krupski-Mynesi theorem gives us the equality:\n        $|\\text{Comp}(Y^*)| = |\\text{Comp}(X) \\setminus \\{C_x\\}|$\n        where $C_x$ is the unique composant of $X$ that contains the point $x$.\n    *   As established in Step 1, since $X$ is an indecomposable metric continuum, the number of its composants is $|\\text{Comp}(X)| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   The number of composants of $X$ other than $C_x$ is therefore $|\\text{Comp}(X)| - 1 = \\mathfrak{c} - 1$.\n    *   For the infinite cardinal $\\mathfrak{c}$, subtracting one does not change the cardinality: $\\mathfrak{c} - 1 = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the number of composants of the remainder $Y^*$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the \"Maximum Possible\" Number:**\n    *   The analysis above holds for *any* hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and *any* point $x \\in X$. The result does not depend on the specific choice of $X$ or $x$.\n    *   The number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder is consistently $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum possible number of composants is also $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Careful points to note:\n*   The fact that $X$ is *hereditary* indecomposable is a stronger condition than necessary for the key theorems but ensures that $X$ is indeed indecomposable.\n*   The remainder $Y^*$ is generally a non-metric continuum, so we cannot directly apply the theorem about the number of composants for *metric* continua to $Y^*$. We must instead use the correspondence theorem which relates the composants of $Y^*$ back to the composants of the metric space $X$.\n*   The final answer is a cardinal number, $\\mathfrak{c}$, which is standard in this area of mathematics. It represents the size of the set of real numbers ($2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\n<<<c>>>"
