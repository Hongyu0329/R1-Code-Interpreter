    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Wallpaper Groups and Point Groups**\n*   **Wallpaper groups:** These are the 17 distinct groups of symmetries for a repeating two-dimensional pattern. They are also known as plane crystallographic groups.\n*   **Point group:** For each wallpaper group, the associated point group consists of the symmetries (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed. These symmetries must be crystallographically compatible, meaning the rotation orders can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n*   **Order of a group:** The number of elements (i.e., distinct symmetry operations) in the group.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the 2D Crystallographic Point Groups of Order 2**\nWe need to find which of the possible 2D crystallographic point groups have exactly two symmetry operations.\n\nThe 10 possible 2D crystallographic point groups are:\n*   $C_1$: Trivial group with only the identity operation. Order = 1.\n*   $C_2$: Group with identity and a 180° rotation. Order = 2.\n*   $C_3$: Group with identity, 120° rotation, and 240° rotation. Order = 3.\n*   $C_4$: Group with rotations of 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°. Order = 4.\n*   $C_6$: Group with rotations by multiples of 60°. Order = 6.\n*   $D_1$: Group with identity and one reflection. (This is also called $C_s$ or 'm'). Order = 2.\n*   $D_2$: Group with identity, a 180° rotation, and two perpendicular reflections. Order = 4.\n*   $D_3$: Order = 6.\n*   $D_4$: Order = 8.\n*   $D_6$: Order = 12.\n\nFrom this list, the point groups with an order of 2 are **$C_2$** and **$D_1$**.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Wallpaper Groups Corresponding to These Point Groups**\nNow we must go through the list of the 17 wallpaper groups and identify which ones have a point group of either $C_2$ or $D_1$. The international (Hermann-Mauguin) notation is helpful here.\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups with Point Group $C_2$:**\n    The notation for these groups will involve a '2', indicating a 2-fold rotational symmetry, but no 'm', indicating no reflection axes. There is only one such group.\n    1.  **p2**: This group's symmetries are based on a lattice with 2-fold rotation centers. Its point group is $C_2$.\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups with Point Group $D_1$ (or m):**\n    The notation for these groups will involve an 'm' (for mirror/reflection) but no numeral other than '1' (which is implicit), indicating reflection is the highest order symmetry.\n    2.  **pm**: This group has parallel reflection axes. Its point group is $D_1$.\n    3.  **pg**: This group has parallel glide reflection axes. Even though it involves glides, the macroscopic point group is still that of a single reflection, $D_1$.\n    4.  **cm**: This group also has reflections and glides. Its point group is $D_1$.\n\n**Step 4: Tally the Results**\nBy checking the complete list of 17 wallpaper groups, we can confirm these are the only ones.\n\n*   Group with point group $C_1$ (order 1): p1\n*   Groups with point group $C_2$ (order 2): **p2**\n*   Groups with point group $D_1$ (order 2): **pm, pg, cm**\n*   Groups with point group $D_2$ (order 4): p2mm, p2mg, p2gg, c2mm\n*   And so on for higher-order point groups...\n\nCounting the groups listed in bold above:\n1.  p2\n2.  pm\n3.  pg\n4.  cm\n\nThere are a total of 4 wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
