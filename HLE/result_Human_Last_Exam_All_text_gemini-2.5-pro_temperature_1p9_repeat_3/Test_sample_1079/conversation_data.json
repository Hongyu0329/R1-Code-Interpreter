    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements `w` in the reflection group of type H3 that satisfy a specific property. Let's break down the key terms:\n*   **Reflection group of type H3**: This is a finite Coxeter group, also known as the icosahedral group. Its order is `|H3| = 120`. It acts on a 3-dimensional Euclidean space.\n*   **Coxeter number**: For H3, the Coxeter number is `h = 10`.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order its Coxeter number 10**: This means an eigenvalue `λ` of `w` must be a primitive 10th root of unity. That is, `λ^10 = 1` but `λ^k ≠ 1` for `1 ≤ k < 10`.\n*   **Regular eigenvector**: An eigenvector `v` of an element `w` is called \"regular\" if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group H3. A reflecting hyperplane is the set of vectors fixed by a reflection in the group.\n\nSo, we are looking for the number of elements `w ∈ H3` for which there exists a vector `v` and a number `λ` such that:\n1.  `w v = λ v` (v is an eigenvector of w with eigenvalue λ).\n2.  `v` does not lie on any reflecting hyperplane.\n3.  `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\n**2. Relate the Properties to Standard Concepts**\n\nThe properties described in the question define a specific type of element in a reflection group.\n*   An element `w` in a Coxeter group `W` is called **regular** if it possesses at least one regular eigenvector. A key theorem states that an element is regular if and only if `1` is not one of its eigenvalues.\n*   An element `w` is called **h-regular** (or regular of period h) if it has a regular eigenvector `v` whose corresponding eigenvalue `λ` is a primitive `h`-th root of unity (`λ = e^(2πik/h)` with `gcd(k, h) = 1`).\n\nThe question is therefore asking for the number of **10-regular** elements in the group H3.\n\n**3. Apply the Main Theorem on h-Regular Elements**\n\nA fundamental theorem in the theory of reflection groups, due to T.A. Springer, characterizes the `h`-regular elements. For an irreducible finite Coxeter group `W` (like H3):\n\n> The set of `h`-regular elements of `W` is precisely the set of all elements conjugate to any **Coxeter element**.\n\nA **Coxeter element** `c` is defined as the product of all simple reflections `s_1, s_2, ..., s_n` in some order. For H3, a Coxeter element would be `c = s_1 s_2 s_3`.\n\nFurthermore, for H3 (and any irreducible Coxeter group whose longest element `w_0` is the central inversion `-I`), all Coxeter elements are conjugate to each other. This means they all belong to a single conjugacy class.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the size of the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element in H3.\n\n**4. Calculate the Size of the Coxeter Conjugacy Class**\n\nThe size of the conjugacy class of an element `c` in a group `W` is given by the formula:\n`|Cl(c)| = |W| / |C_W(c)|`\nwhere `C_W(c)` is the centralizer of `c` in `W` (the subgroup of elements that commute with `c`).\n\nWe need the following two pieces of information for H3:\n*   The order of the group: `|H3| = 120`.\n*   The size of the centralizer of a Coxeter element: For any irreducible Coxeter group, the centralizer of a Coxeter element `c` is the cyclic group generated by `c` itself, i.e., `C_W(c) = <c>`. The order of `c` is the Coxeter number `h`.\n\nFor H3, the Coxeter number is `h=10`. Thus, `|C_{H3}(c)| = h = 10`.\n\nNow, we can calculate the size of the conjugacy class:\n`|Cl(c)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n\nThis means there are 12 elements in H3 that are conjugate to a Coxeter element. According to the theorem, these are precisely the 12 elements that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n**5. Careful Points and Verification**\n\n*   **Existence of other elements**: The group H3 does contain other elements that have eigenvalues of order 10. H3 is isomorphic to `A_5 × Z_2`. There are two conjugacy classes of elements of order 10, both of size 12. Let's call them Class 1 and Class 2.\n*   **Which class is the Coxeter class?**: By computing the trace (the sum of eigenvalues) of a Coxeter element `c`, one finds `Tr(c) = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2`. This matches the trace of elements in one of the two classes (our Class 1), but not the other (where `Tr(w) = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2`). So, only the 12 elements in Class 1 are conjugate to a Coxeter element.\n*   **Why are the other 12 elements excluded?**: The elements in Class 2 also have eigenvalues of order 10. However, the theorem implies that their corresponding eigenvectors are **not regular**. This means that for any element `w` in Class 2, any eigenvector `v` associated with an eigenvalue of order 10 must lie on at least one of the reflecting hyperplanes of H3. This is the crucial distinction.\n*   **Conclusion**: The condition that the eigenvector must be \"regular\" is what limits the count to only the elements in the Coxeter conjugacy class.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements satisfying all conditions in the question is 12.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  The problem asks for the number of elements in H3 with a regular eigenvector whose eigenvalue is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n2.  The Coxeter number for H3 is `h=10`. An element with the described property is called a `10`-regular element.\n3.  The set of `10`-regular elements in H3 is precisely the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element `c`.\n4.  The size of this class is `|H3| / |C_{H3}(c)|`.\n5.  `|H3| = 120`.\n6.  `|C_{H3}(c)| = h = 10`.\n7.  The number of elements is `120 / 10 = 12`.\n\n<<<12>>>"
