    "This problem asks for the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$. Let this number be denoted by $N(2024, 5)$.\n\n### Step 1: Decomposing the problem\n\nA non-negative integer solution $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ can have some of its components equal to zero. The number of non-negative solutions can be found by summing up the number of solutions with a specific number of positive components.\n\nLet $N^+(n, k)$ be the number of solutions to $x_1^2 + \\dots + x_k^2 = n$ where all $x_i$ are positive integers.\nA non-negative solution to our problem with exactly $j$ positive components (and $5-j$ zero components) corresponds to a positive integer solution to a sum of $j$ squares. For a fixed $j$, there are $\\binom{5}{j}$ ways to choose which components are positive.\n\nTherefore, the total number of non-negative solutions is:\n$N(2024, 5) = \\sum_{j=1}^{5} \\binom{5}{j} N^+(2024, j)$\n$N(2024, 5) = \\binom{5}{5}N^+(2024, 5) + \\binom{5}{4}N^+(2024, 4) + \\binom{5}{3}N^+(2024, 3) + \\binom{5}{2}N^+(2024, 2) + \\binom{5}{1}N^+(2024, 1)$\n\n### Step 2: Eliminating impossible cases\n\nWe need to check for which $j$ the value $N^+(2024, j)$ can be non-zero.\n- **Sum of 1 square ($j=1$):** $x_1^2 = 2024$. This requires 2024 to be a perfect square. $44^2=1936$ and $45^2=2025$, so 2024 is not a perfect square. Thus, $N^+(2024, 1)=0$.\n- **Sum of 2 squares ($j=2$):** $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2024$. A number $n$ can be written as the sum of two squares if and only if the prime factorization of $n$ has no prime of the form $4k+3$ raised to an odd power. The prime factorization of 2024 is $2^3 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 23$. Since $11$ ($=4 \\cdot 2+3$) and $23$ ($=4 \\cdot 5+3$) appear with power 1 (odd), 2024 cannot be written as a sum of two squares. Thus, $N^+(2024, 2)=0$.\n- **Sum of 3 squares ($j=3$):** A number $n$ can be written as a sum of three squares if and only if $n$ is not of the form $4^k(8m+7)$. $2024=4 \\cdot 506 = 4^1(8 \\cdot 63 + 2)$. This is not of the forbidden form, so 2024 can be a sum of three squares. Thus, $N^+(2024, 3)>0$.\n- **Sum of 4 and 5 squares:** By Lagrange's four-square theorem, any positive integer is a sum of four squares. Therefore, solutions for $j=4$ and $j=5$ might exist.\n\nOur formula simplifies to:\n$N(2024, 5) = N^+(2024, 5) + 5 N^+(2024, 4) + 10 N^+(2024, 3)$\n\n### Step 3: Relating to the total number of integer solutions\n\nTo find the values of $N^+(n, k)$, we use the number of integer solutions $r_k(n)$, which allows for positive, negative, and zero values for the variables. There are well-known formulas for $r_k(n)$.\n\nThe relationship between $r_k(n)$ and $N^+(n, j)$ for $j \\le k$ is given by considering sign changes and zero components:\n$r_k(n) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\binom{k}{j} 2^j N^+(n, j)$\n\nLet's apply this for $k=3, 4, 5$:\n- For $k=3$: $r_3(2024) = \\binom{3}{3}2^3 N^+(2024, 3) + \\binom{3}{2}2^2 N^+(2024, 2) + \\dots = 8N^+(2024, 3)$.\n- For $k=4$: $r_4(2024) = \\binom{4}{4}2^4 N^+(2024, 4) + \\binom{4}{3}2^3 N^+(2024, 3) + \\dots = 16N^+(2024, 4) + 32N^+(2024, 3)$.\n- For $k=5$: $r_5(2024) = \\binom{5}{5}2^5 N^+(2024, 5) + \\binom{5}{4}2^4 N^+(2024, 4) + \\binom{5}{3}2^3 N^+(2024, 3) + \\dots = 32N^+(2024, 5) + 80N^+(2024, 4) + 80N^+(2024, 3)$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating $r_k(2024)$\n\nWe use standard formulas from number theory for $r_k(n)$.\n- **$r_3(2024)$:** For $n = 4^a m$ where $m \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, if $m \\not\\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$, $r_3(n)$ can be calculated using class numbers.\n  $2024 = 4^1 \\cdot 506$. Here $a=1, m=506$. $m \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. The formula gives $r_3(2024)=12 h(-4m) = 12h(-2024)$. The class number $h(-2024)$ is 16.\n  $r_3(2024) = 12 \\times 16 = 192$.\n- **$r_4(2024)$:** Jacobi's formula for the sum of four squares states that $r_4(n) = 8 \\sum_{d|n, 4 \\nmid d} d$.\n  $n=2024$. The divisors of 2024 not divisible by 4 are 1, 2, 11, 22, 23, 46, 253, 506.\n  Their sum is $1+2+11+22+23+46+253+506 = 864$.\n  $r_4(2024) = 8 \\times 864 = 6912$.\n- **$r_5(2024)$:** The formula for $r_5(n)$ is more complex. One form is given by $r_5(n) = \\frac{2}{3}(2^{2a+3} + (-1)^a\\chi_4(M))\\sum_{d|M}\\mu(d)d\\chi_4(M/d)$, where $n=2^aM$.\n  For $n=2024 = 2^3 \\cdot 253$, we have $a=3$ and $M=253$. $\\chi_4(k) = (-1)^{(k-1)/2}$ for odd $k$.\n  The sum is $\\sum_{d|253} \\mu(d)d\\chi_4(253/d) = 1\\cdot1\\chi_4(253) - 1\\cdot11\\chi_4(23) - 1\\cdot23\\chi_4(11) + 1\\cdot253\\chi_4(1) = 1(1) - 11(-1) - 23(-1) + 253(1) = 1+11+23+253=288$.\n  $r_5(2024) = \\frac{2}{3}(2^{2\\cdot3+3} + (-1)^3\\chi_4(253)) (288) = \\frac{2}{3}(2^9 - 1)(288) = \\frac{2}{3}(511)(288) = 2 \\cdot 511 \\cdot 96 = 98112$.\n\n### Step 5: Solving for $N^+(n, k)$ values\n\nWe now have a system of linear equations which we can solve step-by-step:\n1.  $r_3(2024) = 8 N^+(2024, 3)$\n    $192 = 8 N^+(2024, 3) \\implies N^+(2024, 3) = 24$.\n2.  $r_4(2024) = 16N^+(2024, 4) + 32N^+(2024, 3)$\n    $6912 = 16N^+(2024, 4) + 32(24)$\n    $6912 = 16N^+(2024, 4) + 768$\n    $6144 = 16N^+(2024, 4) \\implies N^+(2024, 4) = 384$.\n3.  $r_5(2024) = 32N^+(2024, 5) + 80N^+(2024, 4) + 80N^+(2024, 3)$\n    $98112 = 32N^+(2024, 5) + 80(384) + 80(24)$\n    $98112 = 32N^+(2024, 5) + 30720 + 1920$\n    $98112 = 32N^+(2024, 5) + 32640$\n    $65472 = 32N^+(2024, 5) \\implies N^+(2024, 5) = 2046$.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the final answer\n\nNow we substitute these values back into the expression for $N(2024, 5)$:\n$N(2024, 5) = N^+(2024, 5) + 5 N^+(2024, 4) + 10 N^+(2024, 3)$\n$N(2024, 5) = 2046 + 5(384) + 10(24)$\n$N(2024, 5) = 2046 + 1920 + 240$\n$N(2024, 5) = 4206$\n\nThe total number of non-negative integer solutions is 4206.\n\n<<<4206>>>"
