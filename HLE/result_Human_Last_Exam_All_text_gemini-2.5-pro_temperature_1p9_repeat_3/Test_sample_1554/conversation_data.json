    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific philosophical concept.\n    *   **The Concept:** The decomposition of the notion of a \"hallmark.\"\n    *   **The Components:** The hallmark is broken down into \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\"\n    *   **The Context:** The philosopher responsible belongs to the Lviv-Warsaw School of philosophy.\n\n2.  **Identify the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period.\n    *   Key figures include its founder, Kazimierz Twardowski, as well as Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   The school was known for its rigorous analytical methods, clarity of thought, and focus on logic, semantics, and epistemology. The question is very much in line with the school's interests.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conceptual Distinction:**\n    *   **Hallmark (or Indicator/Sign):** This is a general term for something that stands for or points to something else. The question is about a specific analysis of this relationship.\n    *   **Symptom:** This term implies a *natural* or *causal* connection. For example, a fever is a symptom of an illness. Smoke is a symptom of fire. The connection exists independently of human agreement. In Polish philosophy, this is often called an *objaw*.\n    *   **Signal:** This term implies a *conventional* or *intentional* connection. A traffic light turning red is a signal to stop. A bell ringing is a signal for the end of class. The meaning is established by rules, communication, or agreement. This is a *sygnał* or *znak*.\n\n4.  **Connect the Concept to the School's Philosophers:**\n    *   We need to find which philosopher within the Lviv-Warsaw School made this specific distinction a part of their work. This involves exploring the contributions of the main figures in areas like epistemology, semiotics (the theory of signs), and the methodology of science.\n    *   While many in the school were concerned with signs and meaning, **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is the philosopher most famously associated with this particular analysis.\n    *   In his works, particularly in his influential book *Logika pragmatyczna* (\"Pragmatic Logic\"), Ajdukiewicz thoroughly analyzed different kinds of signs and their role in inference and knowledge. He explicitly differentiated between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (which he called signs/signals) as part of his methodological framework. This distinction was central to his analysis of how we justify our beliefs based on different kinds of evidence.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the general notion of a hallmark or indicator into the sub-categories of symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n***\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
