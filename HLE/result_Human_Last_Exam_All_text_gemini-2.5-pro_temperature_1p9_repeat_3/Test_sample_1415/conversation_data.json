    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions**\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined by composition:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Integrand**\nThe question asks to evaluate the integral of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`.\nLet `u(x) = F₃(x)`. Then the integrand is `u'(x)/u(x)`.\nThis is a standard form. We know that the derivative of `ln(u(x))` with respect to `x` is `(1/u(x)) * u'(x) = u'(x)/u(x)`.\nTherefore, the integrand is the derivative of `ln(F₃(x))`.\n`∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = ln|F₃(x)| + C`\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Definite Integral**\nWe need to evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1:\n`V = ∫[from 0 to 1] (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate this as:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from x=0 to x=1.\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 4: Check if the argument of the logarithm is positive**\nBefore dropping the absolute value signs, we must check if `F₃(x)` is positive over the interval [0, 1].\n*   The interval is `x ∈ [0, 1]`. The argument of the `sin` function is in radians.\n*   For `x` in [0, 1], `sin(x)` is in the range `[sin(0), sin(1)] = [0, sin(1)]`. Since `1 < π/2`, `sin(1)` is positive.\n*   Therefore, `e^(sin(x))` is in the range `[e^0, e^(sin(1))] = [1, e^(sin(1))]`. This is always positive.\n*   Then `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than or equal to `1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   So, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` will always be greater than or equal to `ln(2)`.\n*   Since `ln(2) ≈ 0.693 > 0`, `F₃(x)` is positive for all `x` in the interval [0, 1]. We can safely remove the absolute value signs.\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n*   **For x = 0:**\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n*   **For x = 1:**\n    `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` (Note: `sin(1)` is sine of 1 radian)\n\n**Step 6: Substitute these values back into the expression for V**\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we get:\n`V = ln[ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / ln(2) ]`\n\n**Step 7: Numerical Calculation**\nNow, we compute the numerical value of V using a calculator (ensure it's set to radian mode).\n*   `sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.84147098) ≈ 2.3197770`\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 1 + 2.3197770 = 3.3197770`\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = F₃(1) ≈ ln(3.3197770) ≈ 1.2009224`\n*   `ln(2) = F₃(0) ≈ 0.6931472`\nNow substitute these into the expression for V:\n`V = ln[ 1.2009224 / 0.6931472 ]`\n`V = ln[1.7325515]`\n`V ≈ 0.549580`\n\n**Step 8: Final Calculation**\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.549580 = 5495.80`\nThe closest integer to 5495.80 is 5496.\n\n<<<5496>>>"
