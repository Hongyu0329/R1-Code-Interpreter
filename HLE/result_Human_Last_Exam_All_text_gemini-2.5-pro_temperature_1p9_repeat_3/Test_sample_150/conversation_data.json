    "An elegant step-by-step analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Statement\nThe goal is to compute the final value of a variable `x`, which starts at 0. We are given `n` statements to execute. Each statement is one of four possible strings: `\"++X\"`, `\"X++\"`, `\"--X\"`, or `\"X--\"`. The `++` operation increments `x` by 1, and the `--` operation decrements `x` by 1.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Provided Java Program\nThe Java program reads the number of statements `t` and initializes a result variable `tresult` to 0. It then enters a `while` loop that runs `t` times. Inside the loop, it reads a statement string `test` and performs the following checks:\n1.  `if (test.contains(\"++X\")) { tresult++; }`\n2.  `if (test.contains(\"--X\")) { tresult--; }`\n\nLet's evaluate this logic for all four possible inputs:\n*   **Input `\"++X\"`:** `test.contains(\"++X\")` is true. `tresult` is incremented. Correct.\n*   **Input `\"X++\"`:** `test.contains(\"++X\")` is false. `test.contains(\"--X\")` is false. `tresult` is unchanged. **Incorrect**. It should have been incremented.\n*   **Input `\"--X\"`:** `test.contains(\"--X\")` is true. `tresult` is decremented. Correct.\n*   **Input `\"X--\"`:** `test.contains(\"++X\")` is false. `test.contains(\"--X\")` is false. `tresult` is unchanged. **Incorrect**. It should have been decremented.\n\n**Conclusion:** The program is flawed because it only handles the prefix versions of the operations (`++X`, `--X`) and fails to handle the postfix versions (`X++`, `X--`). Therefore, it does not solve the problem correctly. The answer must start with 'N'.\n\n### Step 3: Design an Efficient C Solution\nTo meet the criteria of \"fastest\" and \"least memory,\" we need an optimal algorithm.\n\n**Careful Points & Optimization:**\n1.  All input statements (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`) are three characters long.\n2.  The operation type (increment or decrement) is uniquely determined by the presence of either a `+` or `-` character.\n3.  A more specific observation is that the character at the middle position (index 1) is *always* the operator sign that defines the operation.\n    *   `X`**`+`**`+`\n    *   `+`**`+`**`X`\n    *   `X`**`-`**`-`\n    *   `-`**`-`**`X`\n4.  Therefore, the most efficient algorithm is to read each statement and inspect only the character at index 1. If it's `+`, increment the counter. If it's `-`, decrement the counter.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Efficiency Metrics (x and y)\n\nThe question asks for `Nx+y` for an input of 100 instructions.\n\n*   **x: Smallest number of character comparisons (for 100 instructions)**\n    Based on our optimal algorithm, for each of the 100 instructions, we only need to perform a single character comparison (e.g., `statement[1] == '+'`).\n    Total comparisons = 100 instructions * 1 comparison/instruction = 100 comparisons.\n    This is the theoretical minimum, as you must inspect at least one character per line to determine the operation type.\n    Thus, **x = 100**.\n\n*   **y: Smallest memory size in Bytes (B)**\n    To implement the optimal algorithm in C, we need to declare variables to hold the state. The minimal set of variables required is:\n    1.  An integer to store the number of statements `n`. (`int n;` -> 4 bytes)\n    2.  An integer to store the final result `x`. (`int x;` -> 4 bytes)\n    3.  Storage for reading the input. We don't need to store the whole 3-character string. We can read and process the input in a way that only the middle character is ever stored in a variable. (`char op;` -> 1 byte). For instance, using `scanf(\" %*c%c\", &op)` would skip the first character and read the second into `op`.\n    The smallest total memory size for these variables is `sizeof(int) + sizeof(int) + sizeof(char)` which on a typical modern system is `4 + 4 + 1 = 9` bytes.\n    Thus, **y = 9**.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe Java program is incorrect, so the prefix is 'N'. The smallest number of comparisons `x` is 100, and the smallest memory size `y` is 9. Combining these into the required `Nx+y` format gives `N100+9`.\n\n<<<N100+9>>>"
