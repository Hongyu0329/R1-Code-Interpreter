    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the US city where Tommaso moves in the movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (Hard Boiled Egg)\n*   **Year:** 1997\n*   **Character:** Tommaso\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n*   **Action:** Moves to the United States\n*   **Information needed:** The name of the specific US city.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the character's role in the film's plot.**\nTommaso is the best friend of the main character, Piero. He comes from a wealthy, intellectual family and is portrayed as a rebel who is restless and dissatisfied with life in their provincial hometown of Livorno, Tuscany. His character arc involves him searching for meaning, first through radical politics and then by leaving Italy altogether.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the part of the plot concerning Tommaso's departure.**\nTowards the end of the film, the paths of Piero and Tommaso diverge significantly. While Piero builds a conventional life in Livorno, getting a factory job and starting a family, Tommaso decides to leave the country to find his own way.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the exact destination mentioned in the film.**\nThe film explicitly reveals Tommaso's location after he moves. He communicates with Piero by sending him a postcard. This postcard is sent from the United States and clearly shows that he has settled in New York City. This moment in the film serves as a powerful contrast between the two friends' destinies: one who embraces his roots and another who seeks a new life far away.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings to provide a definitive answer.**\nBy examining the plot of *Ovosodo*, specifically the storyline of the character Tommaso, we can confirm that after leaving Italy, he moves to New York City.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
