    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying detail is that this character feels \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This points to a specific piece of dialogue or monologue in the film.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the provided character choices.**\n*   **A. Kris (Kelvin):** The main character, a psychologist sent to the space station. Much of the film's beginning is dedicated to his deep connection with the natural world on Earth. While he certainly misses Earth, his primary emotional journey on the station revolves around his guilt and relationship with the resurrected Hari.\n*   **B. Hari:** Kris's wife, who appears on the station as a \"visitor\" or \"guest\" created by the sentient ocean of Solaris from Kris's memories. As a being with no direct, personal experience of Earth, she cannot miss its sounds. Her desires are focused on becoming human and being with Kris.\n*   **C. Snaut:** One of the two surviving scientists Kris meets on the station. He is weary, cynical, and philosophical. Having been isolated in space for a long time, he often reflects on the loss of humanity and the meaning of their scientific pursuits far from home.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** The other surviving scientist. He is cold, rational, and scientifically dogmatic. He views the \"visitors\" as mere phenomena to be studied and shows very little emotional vulnerability or nostalgia. It is out of character for him to admit to a feeling like shame over missing something from Earth.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** A scientist who committed suicide just before Kris arrived. We only see him in a video message he left for Kris. His message is filled with desperation and warning about the situation on the station, not a wistful longing for Earth.\n\n**Step 3: Recall the specific scene and dialogue.**\nThe key to answering the question lies in a significant conversation between Kris and Snaut in the station's library. The library is filled with books, paintings (like Bruegel's \"Hunters in the Snow\"), and other artifacts from Earth, which serve to highlight the characters' profound distance from it.\n\nDuring this conversation, Snaut delivers a poignant monologue reflecting on their condition. He says:\n> \"We've lost our sense of the pathetic. The tragic. You know, sometimes at night I'm flooded by a desire... I am just a human being... the desire to do something simple and pathetic. Something... you understand... For instance, to stroke a dog. I've forgotten what that's like... Or... I don't know... collect a handful of autumn leaves out of a puddle, as I used to do as a boy... And I'm sometimes simply overcome by a desire to hear the rustling of leaves... I'm ashamed of these desires, Kris.\"\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nThis dialogue directly attributes the sentiment of missing the rustling of leaves, and the accompanying shame for this \"weakness,\" to the character of Dr. Snaut. He is the one who has been away from Earth the longest and has had the most time to reflect on what has been lost. The shame comes from his conditioning as a scientist to suppress such \"simple\" or \"pathetic\" human emotions in the face of their grand cosmic mission.\n\nTherefore, the correct character is Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
