    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each classical ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts. The \"leg position\" includes not only the type of position (e.g., fifth) but also which foot is in front.\n\n**1. Analyze the starting and ending positions for each step:**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** The dancer begins in fifth position, for example, with the right foot in front.\n    *   **Action:** This is a jump where the legs beat six times. The dancer jumps vertically from fifth position. If starting with the right foot in front, the legs open slightly and the right foot beats behind the left, then in front of the left, and finally lands behind the left.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (left foot in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** The dancer begins in fifth position, for example, with the right foot in front.\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   *Échappé*: The dancer \"escapes\" the closed position by jumping to an open position (second position).\n        *   *Battu*: As the legs return from second position, they are \"beaten\" together before landing.\n        *   *Changé*: This term explicitly means \"changed.\" The dancer lands in fifth position with the feet having switched places.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (left foot in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different, as indicated by the term *changé*.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically starts from fifth position, for example, with the right foot in front.\n    *   **Action:** \"Assemblé\" means \"to assemble.\" The dancer brushes one leg out and then jumps off the supporting leg, bringing (\"assembling\") both legs together in the air before landing on two feet simultaneously in fifth position. Common variations include *assemblé dessus* (over) and *assemblé dessous* (under). In *assemblé dessus*, the back leg brushes to the side and lands in front. In *assemblé dessous*, the front leg brushes to the side and lands in the back. Both of these very common forms change which foot is in front. While an assemblé could theoretically be performed without changing feet, its most common named variations are designed to change position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** In its most common directional forms (*dessus* and *dessous*), the front foot changes.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Often changes position, so it's not the best answer.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** The dancer begins in fifth position, for example, with the right foot in front.\n    *   **Action:** \"Glissade\" means \"to glide.\"\n        *   *Derrière* means \"behind.\" This indicates that the second foot will close behind the first.\n        *   The step begins with the back foot (left foot) gliding to the side. The dancer transfers weight to that foot. The first foot (right foot) then glides to close *behind* the left foot in fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer is in fifth position, but now the left foot is in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** The dancer begins in fifth position, for example, with the right foot in front.\n    *   **Action:** \"Gargouillade\" (gurgling) is a complex, decorative step. It is essentially a *pas de chat* where the legs perform a *rond de jambe* (circular movement) in the air. In a standard *pas de chat* starting with the right foot in front, the dancer jumps by first lifting the back (left) leg, then the front (right) leg, landing on the left leg and then closing the right leg in front. This sequence maintains the starting position. The *gargouillade* adds a *rond de jambe* to each leg's movement during the jump but follows the same fundamental path.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in fifth position with the same foot (right foot) in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n**Final Careful Point Analysis:**\n- *Entrechat six*, *Échappé changé*, and *Glissade derrière* all change the front foot by their core definition or naming.\n- *Assemblé* has very common variations (*dessus*, *dessous*) that do change the front foot.\n- *Gargouillade*, being a decorative version of *pas de chat*, follows the same structure, which does not change the front foot in its standard execution.\n\nTherefore, among the given choices, Gargouillade is the step where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\n<<<E>>>"
