    "This question asks for the tallest historical mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad*, with the specific exclusion of Mount Olympus. To answer this, we must identify the mountains mentioned, confirm they are historical (i.e., real places), find their elevations, and then rank them.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify all mountains mentioned in the *Iliad***:\n    *   **Mount Olympus:** The most famous mountain in the epic, home of the gods. It is explicitly excluded by the question. Its highest peak is Mytikas at 2,918 meters (9,573 ft).\n    *   **Mount Ida:** A crucial mountain overlooking the Trojan plain. Zeus often sits on its summit (specifically Gargarus) to watch the battle. Hera also travels there to deceive Zeus in Book 14. This is a very prominent mountain in the narrative.\n    *   **Mount Samothrace:** An island with a high peak. In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits atop its summit to watch the Trojan War, as it offered a clear view of Troy and Mount Ida.\n    *   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, as the goddess Hera travels from Olympus to Lemnos, her flight path takes her \"over the snowy peaks of the Thracian horsemen, over Athos\".\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned as the source of the ash wood for Achilles' famous spear, which was a gift from the centaur Chiron to his father, Peleus.\n    *   **Mount Tmolus:** This mountain is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (specifically, the Trojan Achaean catalogue section) in Book 2. It is described as the snowy home of the Maeonians, who were allies of the Trojans.\n\n2.  **Confirm the mountains are historical and find their elevations**:\n    All the mountains listed are real geographical locations. We can find their modern accepted elevations.\n    *   **Mount Olympus (for reference):** 2,918 m (9,573 ft)\n    *   **Mount Tmolus (modern Bozdağ, Turkey):** 2,157 m (7,077 ft)\n    *   **Mount Athos (Greece):** 2,033 m (6,670 ft)\n    *   **Mount Ida (modern Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** 1,774 m (5,820 ft)\n    *   **Mount Pelion (Greece):** 1,624 m (5,328 ft)\n    *   **Mount Samothrace (peak Fengari, Greece):** 1,611 m (5,285 ft)\n\n3.  **Compare the heights and select the tallest (excluding Olympus)**:\n    We can now rank the mountains by height, from tallest to shortest:\n    1.  Mount Olympus (2,918 m) - Excluded\n    2.  **Mount Tmolus** (2,157 m)\n    3.  Mount Athos (2,033 m)\n    4.  Mount Ida (1,774 m)\n    5.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n    6.  Mount Samothrace (1,611 m)\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Mentioned\" vs. \"Significant\"**: The question asks for the tallest mountain that is *mentioned*, not the most narratively significant. While Mount Ida is far more important to the plot of the *Iliad*, Mount Tmolus and Mount Athos are both taller and are explicitly named in the text.\n*   **Accuracy of Heights**: The elevations are based on modern surveys, which is the standard way to answer such a question about historical geography.\n*   **Confirmation of Mention**: It is crucial to confirm that Mount Tmolus is indeed in the *Iliad*. It is mentioned in Book 2, line 866: \"...the Maeonians, whose captain was Mesthles, ... dwelt under the snowy heights of Tmolos.\" This confirms its place in the epic.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter excluding Mount Olympus, the next tallest mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Tmolus, located in modern-day Turkey.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
