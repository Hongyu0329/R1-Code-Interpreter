    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Premise**\n\nThe question asks whether a Schwartz class function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must be the zero function if all its moments are zero. Let's break down the components:\n\n*   **Schwartz class function:** A function $f$ is in the Schwartz space, denoted $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, if it is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) and all its derivatives decay faster than any polynomial as $|x| \\to \\infty$. Formally, for any non-negative integers $\\alpha, \\beta$, we have $\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |x^\\alpha f^{(\\beta)}(x)| < \\infty$. This is a very strong condition on the smoothness and decay of the function. Examples include the Gaussian function $e^{-x^2}$ and any smooth function with compact support (a \"bump function\").\n\n*   **Moments of a function:** The $k$-th moment of a function $f$ is given by the integral $m_k = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx$.\n\n*   **The Condition:** We are given that $m_k = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$.\n\n*   **The Question:** Does this condition imply that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$?\n\n### **2. Careful Points and Key Concepts**\n\n1.  **Function Class Matters:** The conclusion can depend heavily on the class of functions considered. For example, there exist non-zero functions in $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$ or even $C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$ which are not Schwartz functions, for which all moments are zero. The fact that $f$ is a Schwartz function is critical.\n2.  **Fourier Transform:** The Fourier transform is an extremely powerful tool for analyzing Schwartz functions. A key property is that the Fourier transform is an isomorphism from $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ to itself. This means it's a one-to-one and onto linear map, and both the map and its inverse are continuous with respect to the topology of $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n3.  **Moments and Derivatives of Fourier Transform:** There is a fundamental relationship between the moments of a function and the derivatives of its Fourier transform at the origin.\n4.  **Analyticity vs. Smoothness:** A function can be infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) at a point without being analytic (equal to its Taylor series in a neighborhood). The classic counterexample is $g(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$ for $x \\neq 0, g(0)=0$. All derivatives of $g$ at $x=0$ are zero, but the function is not identically zero. We must investigate if being a Schwartz function provides a stronger condition.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Relate moments of f to its Fourier transform.**\n\nLet $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ denote the Fourier transform of $f(x)$:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\nSince $f \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function, $\\hat{f} \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$. This means $\\hat{f}$ is infinitely differentiable. Let's compute its derivatives. We can differentiate under the integral sign because $f$ is a Schwartz function:\n$$ \\frac{d\\hat{f}}{d\\xi} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\xi}(e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) \\, dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (-2\\pi i x) f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\nRepeating this differentiation $k$ times gives the $k$-th derivative:\n$$ \\frac{d^k\\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\nNow, let's evaluate these derivatives at the origin, $\\xi = 0$:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\left. \\frac{d^k\\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} \\right|_{\\xi=0} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) \\, dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx $$\nWe are given that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, ... $$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the consequence for the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$.**\n\nWe have found that $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function whose derivatives of all orders are zero at the origin.\nThis means that the Taylor series of $\\hat{f}$ around $\\xi=0$ is identically zero.\nAs noted in the \"Careful Points\", for a general $C^\\infty$ function, this does not imply the function itself is zero. However, for Schwartz functions, this property is strong enough to force the function to be zero. This is a standard but non-trivial result in analysis. It can be summarized as:\n\n**Theorem:** If $g \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ and $g^{(k)}(a) = 0$ for some point $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and all integers $k \\ge 0$, then $g(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nApplying this theorem to our function $g = \\hat{f}$ at the point $a=0$, we conclude that:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R} $$\n\n**Step 3: Relate the zero Fourier transform back to the original function f.**\n\nWe have established that the Fourier transform of $f$ is the zero function. As mentioned earlier, the Fourier transform is an isomorphism on the space of Schwartz functions. A key property of an isomorphism (or any injective linear map) is that it maps only the zero vector to the zero vector.\nThe inverse Fourier transform is also a well-defined operator on $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ which can recover $f$ from $\\hat{f}$. The formula is:\n$$ f(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi $$\nSince we have shown that $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$, the integral on the right-hand side is clearly zero for any value of $x$.\n$$ f(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} 0 \\cdot e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi = 0 $$\nThus, it follows that $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nYes, if a Schwartz class function has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function. The reasoning relies on the properties of the Fourier transform on Schwartz space and the fact that a Schwartz function cannot be non-zero if it and all its derivatives vanish at a single point.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
