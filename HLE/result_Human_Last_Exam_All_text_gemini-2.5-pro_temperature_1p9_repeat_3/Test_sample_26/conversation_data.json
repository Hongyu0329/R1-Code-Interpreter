    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the space X**\n*   $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   The complex dimension of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 3. $X$ is a hypersurface, so its complex dimension is $3-1=2$. As a real manifold, its dimension is 4.\n\n**Step 2: Use Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem to find low-dimensional homotopy groups**\nThe Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem states that for a smooth hypersurface $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$ of complex dimension $n-1$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < n-1$ and a surjection for $k = n-1$.\n*   In our case, $n=3$, so the complex dimension of $X$ is 2. The theorem applies for $k < 2$.\n*   For $k=1$: $i_*: \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism.\n*   We know that $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is simply connected for $n \\ge 1$, so $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n*   Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. This means $X$ is a simply connected space.\n\n**Step 3: Relate homotopy to homology using the Hurewicz Theorem**\nThe Hurewicz Theorem states that for a simply connected space $Y$, the first non-trivial homotopy group is isomorphic to the first non-trivial homology group.\n*   Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, the Hurewicz map $h_2: \\pi_2(X) \\to H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an isomorphism. Thus, to understand $\\pi_2(X)$, we can compute the homology group $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Betti numbers of X**\nWe can compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ using Chern classes. The adjunction formula gives the tangent bundle of $X$: $TX \\oplus N_X \\cong T\\mathbb{CP}^3|_X$.\n*   The normal bundle $N_X$ to the quintic hypersurface is the restriction of the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(5)$, i.e., $N_X = \\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}(5)|_X$.\n*   The total Chern class of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is $c(T\\mathbb{CP}^3) = (1+h)^4 = 1+4h+6h^2+4h^3$, where $h$ is the hyperplane class.\n*   Let $h_X = i^*h$ be the restriction of $h$ to $X$. Then $c(N_X) = 1+5h_X$.\n*   From $c(TX) = c(T\\mathbb{CP}^3|_X) / c(N_X)$, we find $c(TX) = (1+4h_X+6h_X^2)(1-5h_X+25h_X^2-\\dots) = 1 - h_X + 11h_X^2$.\n*   The Euler characteristic is the integral of the top Chern class: $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(TX) = \\int_X 11h_X^2$.\n*   The integral $\\int_X h_X^2$ is the degree of $X$, which is 5. So, $\\chi(X) = 11 \\times 5 = 55$.\n*   The Euler characteristic is also given by the alternating sum of Betti numbers: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\n    *   $X$ is connected, so $b_0=1$.\n    *   $\\pi_1(X)=0 \\implies H_1(X)=0 \\implies b_1=0$.\n    *   $X$ is a 4-dimensional real manifold, so by PoincarÃ© duality, $b_4=b_0=1$ and $b_3=b_1=0$.\n    *   So, $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2+b_2$. This gives $b_2 = 53$.\n*   For smooth complex projective hypersurfaces, the integral homology is torsion-free. Thus $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$ and $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute $\\pi_3(X)$ using a Postnikov tower argument**\nThis argument relates $\\pi_3(X)$ to the homology of related spaces.\n1.  Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, we can construct a space $X_{(2)}$ from $X$ by killing the second homotopy group $\\pi_2(X)$. This space fits into a fibration sequence:\n    $K(\\pi_2(X), 2) \\to X \\to X_{(2)}$\n    where $K(\\pi_2(X), 2)$ is an Eilenberg-MacLane space. By construction, $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_k(X_{(2)})$ for $k \\ge 3$, and $\\pi_k(X_{(2)}) = 0$ for $k \\le 2$.\n\n2.  So, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(X_{(2)})$. Since $X_{(2)}$ is 2-connected ($\\pi_1=\\pi_2=0$), the Hurewicz Theorem tells us $\\pi_3(X_{(2)}) \\cong H_3(X_{(2)}, \\mathbb{Z})$. Thus, we need to compute $H_3(X_{(2)})$.\n\n3.  We use the Serre spectral sequence for the fibration $F \\to E \\to B$, where $F=K(\\pi_2(X), 2)$, $E=X$, and $B=X_{(2)}$. The low-degree terms of the associated Gysin exact sequence are:\n    $H_3(X) \\to H_3(X_{(2)}) \\to H_2(K(\\pi_2, 2)) \\to H_2(X)$\n\n4.  Let's analyze the groups and maps:\n    *   $H_3(X)=0$, as computed in Step 4.\n    *   For an Eilenberg-MacLane space $K(A, n)$ with $n \\ge 1$, $H_n(K(A,n), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong A$. Here, $A=\\pi_2(X)$ and $n=2$, so $H_2(K(\\pi_2, 2)) \\cong \\pi_2(X)$.\n    *   From Step 3, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   The map $H_2(K(\\pi_2, 2)) \\to H_2(X)$ in the sequence is induced by the inclusion of the fiber. Via the Hurewicz isomorphisms, this map corresponds to the map $\\pi_2(K(\\pi_2,2)) \\to \\pi_2(X)$ which is an isomorphism by the properties of the Postnikov fibration.\n\n5.  The exact sequence becomes:\n    $0 \\to H_3(X_{(2)}) \\to \\pi_2(X) \\xrightarrow{\\cong} H_2(X) \\to \\dots$\n    Since the map $\\pi_2(X) \\to H_2(X)$ is an isomorphism, the kernel of this map is trivial. By exactness, the image of the map from $H_3(X_{(2)})$ must be trivial. Since the map $H_3(X_{(2)}) \\to \\pi_2(X)$ is injective, this implies $H_3(X_{(2)})=0$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n*   We have $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(X_{(2)})$.\n*   We have $\\pi_3(X_{(2)}) \\cong H_3(X_{(2)})$.\n*   We have shown that $H_3(X_{(2)}) = 0$.\n*   Therefore, $\\pi_3(X) = 0$.\n*   The rank of a trivial group is 0.\n\nThis conclusion is also supported by a general theorem due to B. Totaro, which states that for a very general hypersurface $X \\subset \\mathbb{P}^n$ of degree $d$, $\\pi_k(X)$ is finite for $k \\le d-2$. For our case, $d=5, k=3$, so $\\pi_3(X)$ is finite, which means its rank is 0."
