    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\nThe user is asking for the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded given a specific set of physical resources for a surface code architecture.\n*   **Physical Resources:** Two separate patches of surface code.\n*   **Modifications:** A total of two holes are introduced into this system.\n*   **Objective:** Find the maximum number of logical qubits (`k_max`) that can be encoded.\n\n### Step 2: Modeling the Qubit Capacity of a Surface Code Patch\nTo solve this, we first need to understand how the number of logical qubits depends on the physical structure of a surface code.\n\n1.  **A Single Patch:** A standard, rectangular patch of surface code with no holes is specifically designed to protect a single logical qubit. The logical operators for this qubit (e.g., Logical X and Logical Z) are defined as strings of physical operators that stretch between the boundaries of the patch. So, for a patch with zero holes (`h=0`), it can encode `k=1` logical qubit.\n\n2.  **Introducing Holes:** When a hole is created inside a surface code patch, a new boundary is formed. This new boundary can be used to define a new, independent logical qubit. The logical operators for this new qubit can be pictured as looping around the hole. Each new hole provides the resources for one additional logical qubit.\n\n3.  **The General Formula for a Single Patch:** Based on the above points, the number of logical qubits `k_patch` that can be encoded in a single patch with `h` holes is given by:\n    `k_patch = 1 + h`\n    (where the '1' comes from the patch itself, and 'h' is the number of added qubits from the holes).\n\n### Step 3: Modeling the Total System\nThe problem specifies \"two patches of surface code\". These are physically separate and independent systems. Therefore, the total number of logical qubits that can be encoded is simply the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each patch.\n\n*   Let Patch 1 have `h_1` holes and encode `k_1` qubits.\n*   Let Patch 2 have `h_2` holes and encode `k_2` qubits.\n*   Total logical qubits `k_total = k_1 + k_2`.\n\nUsing our formula from Step 2:\n*   `k_1 = 1 + h_1`\n*   `k_2 = 1 + h_2`\n*   `k_total = (1 + h_1) + (1 + h_2) = 2 + h_1 + h_2`\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Constraints and Solving\nThe problem states there are \"two holes\" in total. This gives us the constraint:\n`h_1 + h_2 = 2`\n(where `h_1` and `h_2` are non-negative integers).\n\nNow, substitute this constraint into our equation for the total number of logical qubits:\n`k_total = 2 + (h_1 + h_2)`\n`k_total = 2 + 2 = 4`\n\n### Step 5: Verification of the Maximum\nTo ensure this is the maximum value, we can check the possible distributions of the two holes:\n\n*   **Case A: Both holes in one patch.**\n    *   `h_1 = 2`, `h_2 = 0`\n    *   `k_1 = 1 + 2 = 3`\n    *   `k_2 = 1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   `k_total = k_1 + k_2 = 3 + 1 = 4`\n\n*   **Case B: One hole in each patch.**\n    *   `h_1 = 1`, `h_2 = 1`\n    *   `k_1 = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   `k_2 = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   `k_total = k_1 + k_2 = 2 + 2 = 4`\n\nIn all possible configurations, the total number of logical qubits is 4. Therefore, the maximum number is 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Interpretation of \"Patch\":** It is crucial to understand that a \"patch of surface code\" in this context refers to a planar code structure capable of encoding `k=1` qubit by default, not just a raw topological disk.\n*   **Interpretation of \"with two holes\":** The phrasing implies a total of two holes to be distributed across the system, not two holes per patch.\n*   **Independence:** The model `k_patch = 1 + h` relies on the fact that the logical qubits defined by the patch boundaries and the various holes are independent (their logical operators can be constructed to commute), which is a standard feature of surface codes.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nThe number of logical qubits is the sum of the number of patches and the total number of holes.\n*   Number of patches = 2\n*   Number of holes = 2\n*   Total logical qubits = (Number of patches) + (Number of holes) = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
