    "This question requires identifying a historical figure based on an academic interpretation of his work by Veronika Campan. Let's break down the clues step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the key phrases in the prompt.**\n*   **\"Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: This is the starting point. We need to understand what this specific scholar has argued. A search for Veronika Campan reveals she has written about the Ten Commandments, particularly focusing on their textual and visual aspects.\n*   **\"HIS work\"**: The subject is a well-known work authored or delivered by a male figure (\"HE\"). Given Campan's specialty, this work is very likely the Ten Commandments.\n*   **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: This points to the final part of the text. The Ten Commandments are a list of ten rules, so this refers to the last commandment(s).\n*   **\"HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\"**: The Tenth Commandment in the Book of Exodus states: \"You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This directly addresses the desire for \"another's material possessions.\"\n*   **\"prohibition against representation\"**: This is a crucial clue. The Second Commandment is famously a \"prohibition against representation\": \"You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.\" This is also known as the principle of aniconism.\n*   **\"naturally ignoring the prohibition\"**: This is the core of Campan's interpretation. The final commandment, by listing specific, concrete, and visualizable things (house, wife, ox, donkey), forces the listener or reader to create a mental *image* or *representation* of those things. In this way, the text itself subtly bypasses the spirit of the Second Commandment's ban on images. The creation of a mental picture is a \"natural\" consequence of processing the text.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesize the clues to identify \"HE\".**\n*   The \"work\" is the Ten Commandments.\n*   The \"prohibition against representation\" is the Second Commandment.\n*   The section at the \"end of the work\" dealing with \"material possessions\" is the Tenth Commandment.\n*   The person (\"HE\") who is traditionally credited with receiving and delivering the Ten Commandments to the people is the prophet Moses. The text of the Ten Commandments is attributed to him as the lawgiver.\n\n**Step 3: State the final answer.**\nThe figure described, whose work is the Ten Commandments and who delivered the rule against coveting material possessions in a way that Veronika Campan interprets as subverting the rule against representation, is Moses. His \"full name\" as known in history and religion is simply Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
