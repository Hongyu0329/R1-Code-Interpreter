    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the etymological development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂g-ieti* into Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n*   **Starting Point:** The PIE verb is given as `*seh₂g-ieti`, meaning '(s)he’s giving a sign'. The root is `*seh₂g-`, and the `*-ieti` ending indicates a 3rd person singular present tense verb of the *-ye/yo-* class. The provided cognates, Hittite `sākizzi` and Latin `sāgīre`, confirm the root's meaning is related to seeking, perceiving, or knowing.\n*   **Target Languages:** We need to trace this root's development into four specific Germanic languages: Proto-Germanic (the unattested common ancestor), Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n*   **Methodology:** This requires applying a series of historical sound laws that governed the changes from PIE to Proto-Germanic, and then from Proto-Germanic to the individual daughter languages. We will use the reconstructed infinitive form for tracing, as it's a standard practice.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivations\n\n#### Step 1: From Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)\n\nWe start with the PIE verbal root `*seh₂g-` and the present stem suffix `*-ye/yo-`. In Germanic, verbs with this suffix become Class 1 weak verbs. The Proto-Germanic infinitive would end in `*-janą`.\n\n1.  **Laryngeal Effect:** The PIE laryngeal `*h₂` (the \"a-coloring\" laryngeal) preceding a consonant colors the preceding vowel `*e` to `*a` and then disappears.\n    *   `*seh₂g-` → `*sāg-` (The vowel becomes long `*ā`). This long `*ā` is confirmed by the Latin cognate `sāgīre`.\n\n2.  **PIE Vowel Shift:** PIE long `*ā` regularly becomes long `*ō` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   `*sāg-` → PGmc `*sōg-`\n\n3.  **Grimm's Law (First Germanic Sound Shift):** This law affects all PIE stop consonants. The relevant change here is that PIE voiced stops become voiceless stops in Proto-Germanic. Specifically, PIE `*g` becomes PGmc `*k`.\n    *   `*sōg-` → PGmc `*sōk-`\n\n4.  **Verbal Morphology:** The verb belongs to the PIE `*-ye/yo-` presents, which yield Class 1 weak verbs in Germanic. The infinitive suffix is reconstructed as `*-janą`. The combining form of the root `*sōk-` and the suffix `*-janą` gives us the PGmc infinitive.\n    *   **Proto-Germanic Result:** **`*sōkijaną`** (meaning 'to seek').\n\n#### Step 2: From Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)\n\nWe start with the PGmc infinitive `*sōkijaną`.\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The `*-j-*` in the suffix `*-janą` causes the preceding back vowel `*ō` to front, becoming a long front rounded vowel `*œ̄`.\n    *   `*sōkijaną` → stem becomes `*sœ̄k-`\n\n2.  **Ending Change:** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-ijaną` reduces to `*-ja` in Old Norse.\n    *   **Old Norse Result:** **`sœkja`** (often written `sækja`).\n\n#### Step 3: From Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)\n\nWe start with the PGmc infinitive `*sōkijaną`.\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** In West Germanic languages like Old English, the `*-j-*` was lost after long syllables, but not before it caused i-umlaut on the root vowel. In Old English, the i-umlaut of PGmc `*ō` results in `*ē`.\n    *   `*sōkjan` → stem becomes `*sēc-`\n\n2.  **Ending Change:** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an` in Old English.\n    *   **Old English Result:** **`sēcan`**\n\n#### Step 4: From Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)\n\nWe start with the PGmc infinitive `*sōkijaną`.\n\n1.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This set of changes distinguishes High German from other Germanic languages. The relevant change affects the PGmc voiceless stop `*k`. When it appears medially after a vowel, `*k` shifts to a voiceless velar fricative `*hh` [x].\n    *   `*sōkijaną` → stem becomes `*sōhh-`\n\n2.  **Old High German Vowel Shift:** PGmc `*ō` develops into the diphthong `*uo` in Old High German.\n    *   `*sōhh-` → `*suohh-`\n\n3.  **I-Umlaut and Final Form:** As in other Germanic languages, the `*-j-*` of the suffix triggers i-umlaut. The umlaut of `uo` is `üe`. However, in Old High German, especially in earlier texts, umlaut on `uo` was often not orthographically marked. The infinitive ending `*-an` becomes `-en`. Therefore, the attested form reflects the un-umlauted vowel.\n    *   **Old High German Result:** **`suohhen`** (alternative spelling `suochen`).\n\n### Final Summary of Forms\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sœkja; Old English: sēcan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
