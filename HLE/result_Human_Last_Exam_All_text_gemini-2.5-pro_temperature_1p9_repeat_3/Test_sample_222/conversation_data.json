    "An step-by-step analysis of the question is provided below.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem**\n\n*   We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    *   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n*   We need to find the 4-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Request**\n\nThe request is to find the \"4-point DFT for an 8-point sequence\". This is a non-standard operation. In Digital Signal Processing, this typically implies a two-step process:\n1.  **Time-Domain Aliasing (or Folding):** The 8-point sequence `y(n)` is converted into a 4-point sequence, let's call it `z(n)`, by folding the second half of `y(n)` and adding it to the first half.\n    `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n2.  **DFT Calculation:** A standard 4-point DFT is then performed on the resulting 4-point sequence `z(n)`.\n\n**Step 3: Find a Method using DFT Properties**\n\nThere is a well-known DFT property that simplifies this process significantly. The DFT of the time-aliased sequence `z(n)` is related to the DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`.\n*   Let `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(n)`.\n*   Let `Z(k)` be the 4-point DFT of the 4-point aliased sequence `z(n)`.\n\nThe property states that `Z(k)` is equal to the even-indexed samples of `Y(k)`:\n`Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nTherefore, our task reduces to finding the even-indexed samples (`Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)`) of the 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence `y(n)`.\n\n**Step 4: Relate Y(k) to the given X(k) and H(k)**\n\nThe interleaved sequence `y(n)` is constructed such that:\n*   The even-indexed elements `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The odd-indexed elements `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nThis structure is precisely the input to the Decimation-In-Time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be computed directly from the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` using the following formulas:\n*   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\nwhere `W_N^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / N)` are the DFT twiddle factors.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the Calculations**\n\nWe need to calculate `Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n*   **For Z(0):** `Z(0) = Y(0)`. Using the formula with `k=0`:\n    `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 H(0)`.\n    We have `X(0) = 1`, `H(0) = 0`, and `W_8^0 = 1`.\n    `Z(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`.\n\n*   **For Z(1):** `Z(1) = Y(2)`. Using the formula with `k=2`:\n    `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 H(2)`.\n    We have `X(2) = -1`, `H(2) = 1`, and `W_8^2 = exp(-j*2*pi*2/8) = exp(-j*pi/2) = -j`.\n    `Z(1) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j`.\n\n*   **For Z(2):** `Z(2) = Y(4)`. Using the formula `Y(k+4)` with `k=0`:\n    `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 H(0)`.\n    We have `X(0) = 1`, `H(0) = 0`, and `W_8^0 = 1`.\n    `Z(2) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1`.\n\n*   **For Z(3):** `Z(3) = Y(6)`. Using the formula `Y(k+4)` with `k=2`:\n    `Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 H(2)`.\n    We have `X(2) = -1`, `H(2) = 1`, and `W_8^2 = -j`.\n    `Z(3) = -1 - (-j)(1) = -1 + j`.\n\n**Step 6: State the Final Answer**\n\nCombining the calculated values, the 4-point DFT is:\n`Z(k) = [Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)]`\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly interpreting the question:** The phrase \"4-point DFT for an 8-point sequence\" is ambiguous. The standard interpretation is time-domain aliasing followed by DFT, which corresponds to frequency-domain sampling (`Y(2k)`).\n2.  **Using the right DFT properties:** The problem is greatly simplified by knowing the relationship `Z(k) = Y(2k)` and the Decimation-In-Time FFT formula that connects `Y(k)` to `X(k)` and `H(k)`. Doing this avoids the long process of computing IDFTs, interleaving, aliasing, and then a final DFT.\n3.  **Twiddle Factors:** Be careful with the calculation of twiddle factors `W_N^k`, especially the indices and signs. For example, `W_8^2 = -j`, not `j`.\n4.  **Periodicity of DFTs:** When using the FFT formulas, remember that `X(k)` and `H(k)` are 4-periodic, so for `Y(k)` you use `X(k mod 4)` and `H(k mod 4)`. This is implicitly handled by the formulas given.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nThe 4-point DFT for the sequence `{x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}` is `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
