    "### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core task is to identify the very first piece of legislation enacted by the modern State of Israel (i.e., post-1948) that explicitly contains the legal term \"good faith\". The Hebrew term for \"good faith\" is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). The answer must not include the statute's year or the word \"the\".\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Common Candidates:** The concept of \"good faith\" is famously central to Israeli private law. Most legal professionals would immediately think of the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**.\n    *   Section 12 of this law mandates good faith in negotiations.\n    *   Section 39 requires that contractual rights and obligations be exercised and fulfilled in good faith.\n    *   However, the question asks for the *first* statute, so 1973 is likely too late.\n\n3.  **Exploring Earlier Legislation from the 1960s:** Before the Contracts Law, the Knesset enacted several other significant civil laws.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** Section 10 of this law provides protection to a person who acquires a right in registered land for consideration and \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*). This predates the Contracts Law.\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** Section 34 of this law deals with the sale of goods by a non-owner. It protects a buyer who acquires the goods and takes possession of them \"in good faith\" (*be-tom-lev*). This predates the Land Law.\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law, in Section 8, imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) on the agent towards the principal. While related, \"loyalty\" is not the same concept as \"good faith,\" and the statute does not use the explicit term *tom lev*.\n\n4.  **Searching for Even Earlier Statutes (1950s):** The analysis so far points to the Sale Law of 1968. However, we must consider laws from the first decade of the state. Many laws from the British Mandate period were incorporated into Israeli law and later re-issued by the Knesset as a \"New Version\" (*Nusach Chadash*) in Hebrew. These \"New Versions\" are considered original Israeli statutes.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Correct Statute:**\n    *   The **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957** is one such law. It was enacted by the Knesset in 1957.\n    *   Section 28 of this Ordinance defines a \"holder in due course\" (*ochez k'shurah*).\n    *   One of the explicit conditions for a person to be considered a holder in due course is that they took the bill \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*).\n    *   Since this statute was enacted in 1957, it significantly predates the Sale Law (1968), the Land Law (1969), and the Contracts (General Part) Law (1973).\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   **\"Modern State of Israel\":** This limits the search to laws passed by the Knesset from 1948 onwards. It excludes British Mandate law unless it was re-enacted by the Knesset. The \"[New Version]\" of the ordinance qualifies as a Knesset statute.\n*   **\"Explicitly introduce\":** The exact term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) must appear in the text of the law itself, not just be a matter of judicial interpretation. The Bills of Exchange Ordinance meets this criterion.\n*   **\"First\":** This requires chronological comparison. The 1957 statute is the earliest confirmed instance.\n*   **Answer Format:** The final answer must be precise and follow the user's formatting instructions (no \"the\", no year).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the chronological analysis, the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957, was the first statute enacted in the modern State of Israel to explicitly use the Hebrew term for \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
