    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Vector Field `n = (nx, ny, nz)`**\n\nThe problem defines a vector field in 3D space `(x, y, z)`. Let's break down its components:\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)`: This is the standard azimuthal angle `φ` in cylindrical coordinates `(ρ, φ, z)`, where `ρ = sqrt(x² + y²)`. The value of `f` ranges from `-π` to `π`.\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x² + y² - 0.5)² + z²) = sqrt((ρ² - 0.5)² + z²)`: This expression represents the distance from a point `(x, y, z)` to a specific circle. The circle is defined by `r2 = 0`, which occurs when `z = 0` and `ρ² - 0.5 = 0`. This is the circle `x² + y² = 0.5` in the `z=0` plane. This is a key structural feature, the \"core\" of the configuration, and it hints at a toroidal geometry.\n*   `G = π * exp(-10 * r2)`: This is an angle `G` that depends on the distance `r2`.\n    *   On the core circle (`r2 = 0`), `G = π * exp(0) = π`.\n    *   Far away from the core circle (`r2 → ∞`), `G = π * exp(-∞) → 0`.\n*   `nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`, `ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`, `nz = cos(G)`: These are the components of the vector field `n`. We can verify that `n` is a unit vector: `nx² + ny² + nz² = sin²(G)(cos²(f) + sin²(f)) + cos²(G) = sin²(G) + cos²(G) = 1`. The angles `(G, f)` can be interpreted as the polar and azimuthal angles on the unit 2-sphere `S²`, respectively (with `G` being the polar angle measured from the z-axis).\n\n**2. Understand the Hopf Charge and Whitehead's Formula**\n\nThe vector field `n(x,y,z)` defines a map from the 3D space `R³` to the 2-sphere `S²`. For the Hopf charge to be well-defined, we check the behavior at infinity. As `(x,y,z) → ∞`, `r2 → ∞`, which means `G → 0`. The vector field `n` approaches `(sin(0)cos(f), sin(0)sin(f), cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)`.\nSince all points at infinity map to a single point (the North Pole of `S²`), we can consider the domain `R³` compactified to a 3-sphere `S³`. Thus, `n` is a map `S³ → S²`. The Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is an integer topological invariant that characterizes such maps.\n\nThe Hopf charge, `Q_H`, can be interpreted as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular points on the target sphere `S²`.\n`Q_H = Lk(n⁻¹(p₁), n⁻¹(p₂))` for `p₁, p₂ ∈ S²`.\n\nWhitehead's formula provides an integral representation for the Hopf charge, but its direct application can be complex, especially if the fields have singularities (which, as we'll see, they do).\n`Q_H = C ∫ A ∧ dA = C ∫ A ⋅ (∇ × A) dV`, where `dA = F = n*ω` is the pullback of the area form on `S²`, and `C` is a normalization constant. A calculation using this integral with the appropriate choice of potential `A` leads to `A ⋅ (∇×A) = 0`, which is a known paradox if the calculation ignores the singularity of the fields on the z-axis.\n\nA more intuitive physical approach involves recognizing the structure as a product of windings. The Hopf charge is given by `Q_H = p * q`, where `p` is a winding number in the toroidal direction (around the z-axis) and `q` is a winding number in the poloidal direction (in any plane containing the z-axis).\n\n**3. Calculating the Winding Numbers**\n\n*   **Toroidal Winding Number `p`:** The azimuthal dependence of the field is given by the angle `f = atan2(y, x)`. As we move a point once around the z-axis in a circle of constant `ρ` and `z`, `f` changes by `2π`. The components `(nx, ny)` are proportional to `(cos f, sin f)`. This corresponds to one full rotation in the equatorial plane of the target sphere `S²`. Therefore, the toroidal winding number is `p = 1`.\n\n*   **Poloidal Winding Number `q`:** The poloidal structure is determined by the angle `G`, which depends on `ρ` and `z`. Let's analyze the map in any half-plane with constant `f` (a poloidal plane). The boundary of this plane is the z-axis and infinity.\n    *   At the \"center\" of the structure (the core circle `r2=0`), we have `G=π`. This corresponds to the South Pole `(0, 0, -1)` of `S²`.\n    *   At the boundary of the plane (far away, `r2→∞`), we have `G=0`. This corresponds to the North Pole `(0, 0, 1)` of `S²`.\n    The map `G` continuously varies from `π` to `0` as we move from the core to infinity in the poloidal plane. This represents a full sweep from the South Pole to the North Pole on the target sphere `S²`. This constitutes a single \"wrap\" in the poloidal direction. Therefore, the poloidal winding number is `q = 1`.\n\n*   **Hopf Charge:** The total Hopf charge is the product of these two winding numbers: `Q_H = p * q = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\n**4. Confirmation via Linking Number of Preimages**\n\nLet's confirm this by finding the linking number of the preimages of two points.\n\n*   **Preimage of the South Pole `p₁ = (0, 0, -1)`:**\n    This requires `nz = cos(G) = -1`, which means `G=π`.\n    From the definition `G = π * exp(-10*r2)`, `G=π` implies `exp(-10*r2)=1`, which means `r2=0`.\n    The set of points where `r2=0` is the circle `x² + y² = 0.5`, `z=0`. Let's call this curve `C_S`. It's a circle in the xy-plane with radius `1/√2`.\n\n*   **Preimage of an equatorial point `p₂ = (1, 0, 0)`:**\n    This requires `nx=1`, `ny=0`, `nz=0`.\n    `nz = cos(G) = 0` ⇒ `G = π/2`. This means `exp(-10*r2) = 1/2`, so `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n    `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = sin(π/2)cos(f) = cos(f) = 1`.\n    `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = sin(π/2)sin(f) = sin(f) = 0`.\n    These imply `f=0`. The condition `f=0` means `y=0` and `x>0`.\n    So the preimage curve `C_E` is defined by `y=0`, `x>0`, and `(x² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²`.\n    This equation describes a closed loop in the xz-plane (specifically, the `y=0, x>0` half-plane). This loop surrounds the point where the `r2` distance is centered in that plane, which is at `x²=0.5, z=0`, i.e., the point `(1/√2, 0, 0)`.\n\n*   **Linking of the two curves `C_S` and `C_E`:**\n    `C_S` is a circle of radius `1/√2` in the `xy`-plane.\n    `C_E` is a closed loop in the `xz`-plane.\n    The circle `C_S` pierces the `xz`-plane at the point `(1/√2, 0, 0)`.\n    The loop `C_E` lies entirely in the `xz`-plane and, as we found, encircles this exact piercing point.\n    A circle and a loop that pierces the area bounded by the circle are linked. More specifically, one curve passes through the \"hole\" of the other. The linking number `Lk(C_S, C_E)` is therefore `±1`. The Hopf charge is the magnitude of this integer.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth the winding number heuristic and the more rigorous linking number analysis show that the field configuration has a non-trivial topology with a Hopf charge of 1."
