The most common reasons a functional MRI coil shows no resonance on a VNA with a pickup loop are that its **active decoupling circuit** is engaged (intentionally detuning the coil) or its **integrated preamplifier is unpowered**. The preamplifier is often an essential part of the coil's tuning and matching circuit, so without it being active, the coil will not resonate correctly. Additionally, for complex multi-element array coils, the pickup loop may be positioned in a spot with **poor magnetic coupling** to any of the resonant elements.
