    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Tank**\nThe tank is in the shape of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a convex polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 identical edges, and 12 vertices. It is a highly symmetrical object.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Orientation of the Tank**\nThe tank is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of its 20 triangular faces is positioned horizontally to serve as the base. A key property of the icosahedron is that for every face, there is an exactly opposite, parallel face. Therefore, when the icosahedron stands on one face, the opposite face is also horizontal, forming the top of the tank. The vertical axis connecting the centers of the base and top faces is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Water Level**\nThe tank is \"half-filled with water,\" meaning the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron. The icosahedron has point symmetry (or central symmetry), meaning it is symmetric with respect to its geometric center. Any plane passing through the center divides the icosahedron into two equal volumes. Since the water is a fluid at rest, its surface will be a horizontal plane. For the water to occupy half the volume, this horizontal surface must pass through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Water Surface**\nThe shape of the water surface is the shape of the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron passing through its center.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Cross-Sectional Shape**\nTo find this shape, we can analyze the structure of the icosahedron in this orientation.\n\n*   **Symmetry consideration:** Because the tank's orientation has a vertical 3-fold axis of rotational symmetry, the horizontal cross-section at its center must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Structural analysis:** The 12 vertices of the icosahedron can be grouped into four horizontal layers when it is resting on a face:\n    1.  The 3 vertices of the bottom face (base).\n    2.  A layer of 3 vertices above the base.\n    3.  A layer of 3 vertices below the top.\n    4.  The 3 vertices of the top face.\n*   The central horizontal plane (the water surface) is located exactly between the two middle layers of vertices (layers 2 and 3).\n*   The outline of the water surface is a polygon formed by the points where the central plane intersects the edges of the icosahedron. The only edges this plane can intersect are those that connect a vertex from the layer above the plane to a vertex from the layer below it.\n*   By examining the connections in an icosahedron, it can be found that there are exactly 6 edges that connect the vertices of the second layer to the vertices of the third layer.\n*   Since the plane cuts 6 edges, the resulting polygon has 6 sidesâ€”it is a hexagon.\n*   Given the high degree of symmetry (specifically, the 3-fold rotational symmetry and the central symmetry), this hexagon must be regular, meaning all its sides and angles are equal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen the icosahedron tank is standing on a face and is half-filled, the water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center. The intersection of this plane with the faces of the icosahedron forms a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
