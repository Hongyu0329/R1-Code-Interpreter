The two problems are:

1.  **A Categorical Contradiction:** The JTB definition requires that knowledge is a type of belief (i.e., knowledge is a subset of belief). However, the constraint that the only available epistemic states are "Knowledge" or "Belief" implies these categories are mutually exclusive. This creates a logical contradiction: for a state to qualify as Knowledge under JTB it must be a Belief, but under the given constraint, a state classified as Knowledge cannot simultaneously be a Belief. This makes the JTB definition internally incoherent within the system.

2.  **The Loss of Important Epistemic Distinctions:** The constraint forces all states that are not "Knowledge" into a single, undifferentiated category of "Belief." This conflates epistemically distinct states, such as a **Justified False Belief** (which is rational) and an **Unjustified True Belief** (which is merely a lucky guess). By collapsing them into the same category, the framework loses its ability to evaluate the rationality or justification of beliefs that fail to achieve the status of knowledge, thereby undermining the analytic power of the "Justification" condition.
