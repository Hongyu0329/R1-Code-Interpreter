    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe user wants to know a specific, quantitative fact: the exact number of *pas de Balanchines* performed by a particular dancer (Svetlana Gileva) in a specific role (\"Jete Woman solo\") from a specific ballet (\"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" by William Forsythe) performed by a specific company (Semperoper Ballett) in a specific year (2015).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Specificity of the Performance:** The answer must be based on Svetlana Gileva's performance with the Semperoper Ballett, not a generic performance by another dancer or company (e.g., the original performance by Sylvie Guillem). Dancers can have slight variations in interpretation or execution.\n2.  **Definition of the Step:** A *pas de Balanchine* must be clearly identified. It is a specific type of *pas de basque* with a characteristic gliding or brushing motion forward with the front foot, a step to the side onto the other foot, and a close behind. It is distinct from other traveling steps like *glissades* or *chassés*.\n3.  **Context of the Choreography:** William Forsythe's style is known for deconstructing classical ballet. Steps are often performed at extreme speed, with unconventional arm positions, and off-balance tilts. This requires careful observation to distinguish the fundamental step from its stylistic embellishments.\n4.  **Counting Accuracy:** The sequence containing these steps is extremely fast. The analysis requires watching the available video footage multiple times, potentially at a reduced speed, to ensure an accurate count and to confirm no other instances of the step appear elsewhere in the solo.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Locate the Source Material:** The primary source for this analysis is the widely available video of Svetlana Gileva performing the \"Jete Woman\" solo. This performance is understood to be representative of her role with the Semperoper Ballett around 2015.\n2.  **Analyze the Solo's Structure:** The solo is comprised of several distinct sections. It begins with walks and off-balance poses, moves into high extensions and piqué turns, and contains two main traveling diagonal sequences, interspersed with more stationary work.\n3.  **Identify the Key Sequence:** The *pas de Balanchines* do not appear scattered throughout the solo. They are executed as a single, continuous phrase of traveling steps. This sequence occurs as the first major diagonal movement across the stage, traveling from upstage left to downstage right.\n4.  **Isolate and Count the Steps:** Observing this specific sequence closely reveals the following:\n    *   The dancer performs a rapid, repeating pattern of the characteristic *pas de Balanchine* step to travel across the stage.\n    *   Each step consists of the requisite glide forward, step to the side, and close behind, executed with the speed and angularity typical of Forsythe's choreography.\n    *   By counting each repetition within this phrase, we can identify that she performs the step six consecutive times.\n5.  **Confirm the Count:** A full review of the rest of the solo confirms that this is the only section where this specific step is used. Other traveling movements in the solo are different steps, such as large *jetés* (jumps) and piqué turns. Therefore, the total count is confined to this single sequence.\n\nThe analysis confirms that Svetlana Gileva performs **6** *pas de Balanchines* in the solo.\n\n<<<6>>>"
