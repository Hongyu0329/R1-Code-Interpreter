    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify the Diagram\n\nThe question asks for the symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram with the following properties:\n*   **Two vertices**: This implies the diagram is a second-order contribution in the perturbative expansion of an interaction.\n*   **Four field contractions**: A field contraction corresponds to a propagator line in a Feynman diagram.\n*   **Context**: Perturbative Green's function analysis.\n\nLet's assume the most common context for such a problem: a scalar field theory with a $\\phi^4$ interaction. The interaction term in the Lagrangian is $L_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$.\nEach vertex in this theory has four lines (or field legs) attached. With two vertices, we have a total of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ field legs. To have four propagators (contractions), all eight legs must be paired up internally. This means the diagram is a **vacuum diagram** (it has no external lines).\n\nThe only way to connect two $\\phi^4$ vertices using exactly four propagators is for all four lines from the first vertex to connect to the four lines of the second vertex. Topologically, the diagram consists of two points connected by four lines.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Symmetry Factor (S)**: This is a combinatorial factor that corrects for overcounting in Feynman diagram calculations. It ensures that when you sum up all unique diagrams, you get the correct result from the operator-based perturbative expansion (Wick's theorem). A diagram's contribution is scaled by $1/S$.\n2.  **Sources of Overcounting**: Overcounting arises from symmetries in the diagram.\n    *   Identical vertices that can be swapped without changing the diagram's topology.\n    *   Identical propagators that can be swapped.\n    *   Identical lines attached to a single vertex (this is usually handled by the $1/n!$ factor in a $\\phi^n$ Lagrangian, but it's part of the broader combinatorial problem).\n3.  **Methods for Calculation**: There are two standard methods to calculate $S$.\n    *   **Method 1 (First Principles)**: Start from the perturbative expansion, count the number of Wick contractions that form the diagram, and combine all numerical pre-factors from the expansion ($1/n!$) and the Lagrangian ($1/k!$). The final coefficient gives $1/S$.\n    *   **Method 2 (Graph Automorphisms)**: Treat the diagram as a graph and count the number of ways its components (vertices and edges/propagators) can be permuted while leaving the graph's structure unchanged. This count is the symmetry factor $S$. This is often simpler and less error-prone.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed Analysis using Both Methods\n\n#### Method 1: Calculation from First Principles\n\n1.  The diagram has two vertices, so it arises from the second-order term of the expansion of the exponential $e^{iS_{int}}$. The prefactor for the $n=2$ order term is $\\mathbf{\\frac{1}{2!}}$.\n2.  The interaction Lagrangian is $L_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$. Each of the two vertices carries a factor of $\\frac{1}{4!}$. So, we have a combined factor of $(\\mathbf{\\frac{1}{4!}})^2$.\n3.  We need to calculate the number of ways to perform Wick contractions on the operator term $\\phi^4(z_1)\\phi^4(z_2)$ to form the diagram. For our diagram, all four fields at vertex $z_1$ must be contracted with the four fields at $z_2$.\n    *   Take the first field at $z_1$. It can be paired with any of the 4 fields at $z_2$.\n    *   Take the second field at $z_1$. It can be paired with any of the remaining 3 fields at $z_2$.\n    *   This continues until the last field.\n    *   The number of distinct ways to pair the four fields at $z_1$ with the four fields at $z_2$ is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = \\mathbf{4!}$.\n4.  The total numerical factor in front of the diagram's integral expression is the product of these combinatorial numbers. This factor is equal to $1/S$.\n    $\\frac{1}{S} = (\\text{from expansion}) \\times (\\text{from Lagrangian}) \\times (\\text{from contractions})$\n    $\\frac{1}{S} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2!}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4!}\\right)^2 \\times (4!)$\n    $\\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{(4!)^2} \\times 4! = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 4!} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 24} = \\frac{1}{48}$\n5.  From this, we conclude that the symmetry factor is $S = 48$.\n\n#### Method 2: Calculation from Diagram Symmetries (Graph Automorphisms)\n\n1.  We analyze the topological symmetries of the diagram, which consists of two vertices connected by four propagator lines.\n2.  **Vertex Permutation**: The two vertices are identical (both are $\\phi^4$ interaction points). We can swap their positions ($z_1 \\leftrightarrow z_2$), and the diagram remains topologically the same. This gives a symmetry factor of $\\mathbf{2!} = 2$.\n3.  **Propagator Permutation**: The four propagators are also identical. They all start at one vertex and end at the other. We can permute these four lines among themselves in any way without changing the diagram. This gives a symmetry factor of $\\mathbf{4!} = 24$.\n4.  The total symmetry factor $S$ is the product of the orders of these independent symmetry operations.\n    $S = (\\text{Vertex Symmetry}) \\times (\\text{Propagator Symmetry})$\n    $S = 2! \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBoth methods robustly yield the same result. The symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two $\\phi^4$ vertices connected to each other by four propagators is 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
