    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe quote, \"a joy-discovering sailor\" (мореплаватель-весельчак), comes from a work by the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. This immediately points us towards a famous poem or literary work and suggests the subject is a Russian or a figure significant to Russian history, who was involved in maritime exploration.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe question posed by Voznesensky, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" (Где могила твоя, хотя б холмик?), is a critical piece of information. It tells us that at the time the poem was written, the burial place of this \"sailor\" was unknown. This narrows down the possibilities significantly, as most famous historical explorers have well-known graves or memorials. This man's final resting place was a mystery.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third clue.**\n\"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" This is the key to solving the puzzle. We are looking for a historical figure whose lost grave was discovered or identified specifically in the late 1980s. This timeframe, coinciding with the Perestroika era in the Soviet Union, saw a renewed interest in re-examining and restoring lost parts of Russian history.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the clues.**\n*   The quotes are from Voznesensky's poem \"Saga,\" which formed the lyrical basis for the iconic Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n*   The subject of both the poem and the opera is the Russian diplomat, explorer, and Chamberlain of the Russian Imperial Court, Nikolai Rezanov.\n*   Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while returning from his expedition to Russian America. He was buried in the Voskresensky Cathedral.\n*   In the 1930s, the Soviet government destroyed the cathedral, and the exact location of Rezanov's grave was lost for decades, fitting the line \"Where is your grave?\".\n*   In the late 1980s, spurred by the immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos\" and the changing political climate, an expedition was organized in Krasnoyarsk. In 1989, archeologists were able to identify the likely spot of the original burial. A memorial tombstone was later erected on the site. This event provided the \"answer\" to Voznesensky's poetic question.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The \"sailor\" reference is figurative, as Rezanov was more of a diplomat and statesman who led a sea voyage, not a sailor by trade.\n*   The connection to Andrei Voznesensky is the primary link. Knowing his work, particularly \"Saga\" or the opera \"Juno and Avos,\" directly leads to the answer.\n*   The \"discovery\" in the late 1980s refers to the historical and archaeological confirmation of the grave's location, which had become a famous mystery partly because of Voznesensky's poem.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy combining the clues, we can confidently identify the man as Nikolai Rezanov. The poem is about him, his grave was famously lost, and its location was rediscovered in the specific timeframe mentioned. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
