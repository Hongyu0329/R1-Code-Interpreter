    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand the musical terms used in the question:\n*   **The Beatles:** The artist is specified, narrowing our search to their discography.\n*   **\"starts with\":** The specific chord progression must occur at the very beginning of the song.\n*   **\"Tonic\":** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It is designated with the Roman numeral I. For example, in the key of C Major, the tonic chord is C Major.\n*   **\"Minor fifth chord\":** This phrase is slightly ambiguous but has a very likely musical interpretation. The \"fifth\" refers to the fifth note of the scale (the dominant). A \"minor fifth chord\" means a *minor* chord built on that fifth note. In a major key, the chord on the fifth is naturally major (the V chord). A minor chord on the fifth (a 'v' chord) is a \"borrowed chord\" from the parallel minor key, giving it a distinctive, poignant sound.\n*   **\"Chord jump\":** This simply means a change from one chord to the next.\n\nSo, the question is asking for a Beatles song that opens with the chord progression: **I → v** (a major tonic chord followed by a minor dominant chord).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs\n\nLet's think through the openings of well-known Beatles songs to find this specific progression.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Starts with a famous, complex, dissonant chord. It's not a simple tonic.\n*   **\"Yesterday\":** Starts with G major (I). The next chord is F#m7. F# is the seventh degree of the G scale, so this is not the requested progression.\n*   **\"Hey Jude\":** Starts with F major (I). The second chord is C major (V), the standard dominant, not a minor dominant.\n*   **\"Let It Be\":** Starts with C major (I). The second chord is G major (V), also the standard dominant.\n*   **\"Something\":** Starts with C major. The progression is C → Cmaj7 → F. The F chord is the IV chord (subdominant), not the v chord.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Correct Song\n\nLet's consider the song **\"Michelle\"** from the album *Rubber Soul*.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key:** The song's main key is F major. Therefore, the tonic (I) chord is **F Major**.\n2.  **Analyze the Fifth:** The fifth note of the F major scale is C. The standard dominant (V) chord would be C Major.\n3.  **Analyze the \"Minor Fifth Chord\":** A minor chord built on the fifth (C) would be **C minor**. This is our target 'v' chord.\n4.  **Listen to the Intro:** The song begins with a memorable instrumental guitar passage.\n    *   The very first chord Paul McCartney plays is **F Major** (the tonic, I).\n    *   The very next chord he plays is **C minor** (the minor dominant, v).\n\nThis perfectly matches the progression described in the question. The jump from the bright F Major to the melancholic C minor is what gives the opening of \"Michelle\" its unique, continental-sounding charm.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   **Interpreting \"Minor Fifth Chord\":** It's crucial to correctly interpret this non-standard term. The most musically logical meaning is \"a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale\" (v), not a chord containing a flatted fifth (a diminished chord). The progression I → v is a known harmonic device, whereas starting a song I → Idim is extremely rare.\n*   **Identifying the \"Start\":** The instrumental introduction is part of the song and is where this progression occurs.\n*   **Verifying the Tonic:** One must be sure of the song's key to correctly identify the tonic and fifth chords. The rest of \"Michelle\" confirms F as the tonal center.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the song is unequivocally \"Michelle\".\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
