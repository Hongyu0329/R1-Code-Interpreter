    "An analysis of the question, leading to the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the components of the question**\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates, which we can denote as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate is a property that an element of the domain can either have or not have. For any element $u$ in a model, we can represent its properties as a 4-bit vector, e.g., $(1, 0, 1, 0)$ if $P_1(u)$ and $P_3(u)$ are true, and $P_2(u)$ and $P_4(u)$ are false.\n*   **Logical Language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic over the schema $S$. The only allowed logical constructs are:\n    *   $\\exists$: The existential quantifier.\n    *   $\\land$: Conjunction (logical AND).\n    *   $\\top, \\bot$: The logical constants for True and False.\n    *   Atomic formulas of the form $P_i(x)$, where $x$ is a variable.\n    *   We cannot use negation ($\\neg$), disjunction ($\\lor$), implication ($\\to$), or the universal quantifier ($\\forall$).\n*   **VC dimension**: The VC dimension measures the expressive power of a set of classifiers. In our context, the classifiers are the sets definable by formulas in our logical language with one free variable, say $\\phi(x)$. A formula $\\phi(x)$ classifies points $u$ in the domain: $u$ is \"in\" the set if the formula is true for $u$, and \"out\" otherwise. The VC dimension is the maximum size $d$ of a set of points that can be \"shattered\" by the collection of definable sets. A set of points $X$ is shattered if for every possible subset $X' \\subseteq X$, there is a definable set $C$ such that $C \\cap X = X'$.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the classifiers (definable sets)**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\nAny such formula can be written in prenex normal form. Since the only quantifier is $\\exists$, this form is $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula.\nThe quantifier-free part $\\psi$ can only be built from atomic formulas and the connectives $\\land, \\top, \\bot$. This means $\\psi$ must be a conjunction of atomic formulas, or $\\top$, or $\\bot$.\nLet's analyze the formula $\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$.\n\n1.  If $\\psi$ is or contains $\\bot$ as a conjunct, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$. This defines the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n2.  We can factor the conjunction $\\psi$ based on the variables: $\\psi \\equiv \\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_1(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land \\psi_m(y_m)$, where each $\\psi_v(v)$ is a conjunction of atoms involving only the variable $v$.\n3.  The formula becomes $\\phi(x) \\equiv \\psi_x(x) \\land (\\exists y_1 \\psi_1(y_1)) \\land \\dots \\land (\\exists y_m \\psi_m(y_m))$.\n4.  Each part of the form $(\\exists y_j \\psi_j(y_j))$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). In any given model (i.e., for a given interpretation of the predicates), such a sentence is either true or false for the whole model.\n    *   If any of these sentences is false in a model, then the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ is false for all $x$, defining the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n    *   If all these sentences are true in the model, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to just $\\psi_x(x)$.\n5.  The formula $\\psi_x(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving only $x$, i.e., $\\psi_x(x) \\equiv P_{i_1}(x) \\land P_{i_2}(x) \\land \\dots \\land P_{i_k}(x)$. This is known as a **positive monomial**.\n\nSo, for any given model, any set definable by a formula in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is either:\na.  The empty set (definable by $\\bot$).\nb.  A set defined by a positive monomial $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThe set of all positive monomials over 4 variables includes the case where the index set $I$ is empty. The empty conjunction is equivalent to $\\top$, which defines the entire universe of points.\n\nTherefore, the class of concepts $\\mathcal{C}$ we are analyzing consists of sets definable by any of the $2^4 = 16$ possible positive monomials, plus the empty set.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the upper bound of the VC dimension**\n\nTo shatter a set of points of size $d$, we need to be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets. This requires at least $2^d$ distinct classifiers.\nOur concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ has at most $16$ concepts from the monomials plus one concept for the empty set (from $\\bot$). The total number of distinct concepts is at most $16 + 1 = 17$.\nSo, to shatter a set of size $d$, we must have $2^d \\le 17$.\n*   If $d=4$, we need $2^4 = 16 \\le 17$. This is true, so the VC dimension could be 4.\n*   If $d=5$, we need $2^5 = 32 \\le 17$. This is false.\nThus, it is impossible to shatter any set of 5 points because we simply do not have enough distinct classifiers. This holds for any structure.\nTherefore, the VC dimension must be less than 5, i.e., $VCD(\\mathcal{C}) \\le 4$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the lower bound of the VC dimension**\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must find a set of 4 points that can be shattered. This requires us to construct a specific model (an interpretation of the predicates for those 4 points).\nLet our set of points be $X = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4\\}$. Let the number of predicates be $k=4$.\nLet's define the predicates for these points by assigning each point $u_i$ a type vector that has a $0$ at position $i$ and $1$s everywhere else:\n*   Type of $u_1$: $(0, 1, 1, 1)$. ($P_1(u_1)$ is false, $P_2(u_1), P_3(u_1), P_4(u_1)$ are true).\n*   Type of $u_2$: $(1, 0, 1, 1)$. ($P_2(u_2)$ is false).\n*   Type of $u_3$: $(1, 1, 0, 1)$. ($P_3(u_3)$ is false).\n*   Type of $u_4$: $(1, 1, 1, 0)$. ($P_4(u_4)$ is false).\n\nLet $S_i$ be the set of predicate indices that are true for $u_i$. So, $S_i = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus \\{i\\}$.\nOur classifiers are positive monomials of the form $C_I(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in I} P_j(x)$. A point $u_i$ is selected by this classifier if and only if all predicates $P_j$ for $j \\in I$ are true for $u_i$. This is equivalent to the condition $I \\subseteq S_i$.\n\nNow, let $Y$ be any desired subset of $X$. We must find an index set $I$ that selects exactly the points in $Y$.\nLet's choose the index set $I_Y = \\{j \\mid u_j \\notin Y\\}$.\n\n*   Consider a point $u_i \\in Y$. We need to check if $u_i$ is selected by $C_{I_Y}$, i.e., if $I_Y \\subseteq S_i$. An element $j \\in I_Y$ means $u_j \\notin Y$. Since $u_i \\in Y$, it must be that $j \\neq i$. So, the index $i$ is not in $I_Y$. The set $S_i$ contains all indices except $i$, so it certainly contains all of $I_Y$. Thus $I_Y \\subseteq S_i$ holds, and $u_i$ is selected.\n*   Consider a point $u_k \\notin Y$. We need to check if $u_k$ is rejected by $C_{I_Y}$, i.e., if $I_Y \\not\\subseteq S_k$. Since $u_k \\notin Y$, by our definition of $I_Y$, the index $k$ is in $I_Y$. However, the set $S_k$ is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus \\{k\\}$, so it does not contain $k$. Therefore, $I_Y$ cannot be a subset of $S_k$, and $u_k$ is rejected.\n\nSince this works for any choice of $Y \\subseteq X$, we have shown that this set of 4 points can be shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4, i.e., $VCD(\\mathcal{C}) \\ge 4$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nFrom Step 3, we have $VCD(\\mathcal{C}) \\le 4$.\nFrom Step 4, we have $VCD(\\mathcal{C}) \\ge 4$.\nCombining these results, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is exactly 4."
