    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Scaling Exponent α:** In the theory of critical phenomena, physical quantities exhibit power-law behavior near a critical point. The specific heat `C` near the critical temperature `T_c` scales as `C ~ |(T - T_c) / T_c|⁻ᵃ`. The exponent `α` characterizes this singular behavior.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** This is the spatial dimension at and above which the predictions of mean-field theory for critical exponents become exact. For a large class of systems, including the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models (collectively known as O(n) models), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`.\n*   **Epsilon (ϵ) Expansion:** This is a powerful technique developed by Kenneth Wilson and Michael Fisher within the Renormalization Group (RG) framework. It involves calculating physical quantities, such as critical exponents, as a power series in the parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`. This method is formally exact in the limit `ϵ → 0` (i.e., when the dimension `d` is very close to `d_c`), but it often provides good numerical estimates even when `ϵ` is not small (e.g., for `d=3`, where `ϵ=1`).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Parameters of the Problem**\n\n*   The spatial dimension is given as `d = 3`.\n*   The relevant upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`.\n*   The expansion parameter is `ϵ = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n\n**Step 3: Use the Hyperscaling Relation**\n\nA fundamental result from RG theory is the hyperscaling relation, which connects the specific heat exponent `α` to the spatial dimension `d` and the correlation length exponent `ν` (where the correlation length `ξ` scales as `ξ ~ |t|⁻ν`). This relation is:\n\n`dν = 2 - α`\n\nWe can rearrange this to express `α` in terms of `d` and `ν`:\n\n`α = 2 - dν`\n\nThis relation is believed to hold for `d ≤ d_c`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Epsilon Expansion for the Exponent ν**\n\nThe `ϵ`-expansion provides a formula for the exponent `ν` as a power series in `ϵ`. The result depends on the number of components `n` of the order parameter (the universality class). For the O(n) model, the first-order result is:\n\n`ν = 1/2 + (n+2) / (4(n+8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ²)`\n\n*   **Note:** In mean-field theory (`ϵ=0`), `ν = 1/2`. The second term is the first-order correction due to fluctuations below the upper critical dimension.\n\n**Step 5: Derive the Epsilon Expansion for α**\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for `d = 4 - ϵ` and the first-order expansion for `ν` into the hyperscaling relation `α = 2 - dν`. We only need to keep terms up to the first order in `ϵ`.\n\n`α = 2 - (4 - ϵ) * [1/2 + (n+2) / (4(n+8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ²)]`\n\nLet's expand the product:\n\n`α = 2 - [ (4 * 1/2) + (4 * (n+2)/(4(n+8)) * ϵ) - (ϵ * 1/2) + O(ϵ²) ]`\n\n`α = 2 - [ 2 + (n+2)/(n+8) * ϵ - ϵ/2 + O(ϵ²) ]`\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n`α = - [ (n+2)/(n+8) - 1/2 ] * ϵ + O(ϵ²)`\n\nFind a common denominator to combine the terms in the bracket:\n\n`α = - [ (2(n+2) - (n+8)) / (2(n+8)) ] * ϵ + O(ϵ²)`\n`α = - [ (2n + 4 - n - 8) / (2(n+8)) ] * ϵ + O(ϵ²)`\n`α = - [ (n - 4) / (2(n+8)) ] * ϵ + O(ϵ²)`\n\nThis gives us the final formula for `α` to first order in `ϵ`:\n\n`α = (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) * ϵ`\n\n**Step 6: Obtain the Numerical Value for d=3**\n\nTo get a numerical value, we must specify `n`. The question asks for \"the\" scaling exponent, which typically implies the most common and fundamental case: the **Ising model**, which has a single-component order parameter (`n=1`).\n\nWe substitute `n=1` and `ϵ=1` into our formula:\n\n`α ≈ (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8))`\n`α ≈ 3 / (2 * 9)`\n`α ≈ 3 / 18`\n`α ≈ 1/6`\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Universality Class:** The result for `α` depends on the system's universality class, specified by `n`. A single numerical answer can only be given if a specific class is assumed. The Ising model (`n=1`) is the standard choice if not otherwise specified.\n2.  **Approximation:** The `ϵ`-expansion is a perturbative series. Using it for `d=3` means setting `ϵ=1`, which is not infinitesimally small. Therefore, the result `α = 1/6` is a first-order approximation. Higher-order corrections (`O(ϵ²)`, `O(ϵ³)`, etc.) exist and would refine this value. (For reference, the accepted numerical value for the 3D Ising model is `α ≈ 0.110`, while `1/6 ≈ 0.167`).\n3.  **Validity of Relations:** The calculation relies on the validity of the hyperscaling relation `dν = 2 - α`, which is a central and well-established tenet of RG theory for `d < d_c`.\n\nThe calculation, performed to first order in the epsilon expansion for the n=1 Ising universality class, yields the value `1/6`.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
