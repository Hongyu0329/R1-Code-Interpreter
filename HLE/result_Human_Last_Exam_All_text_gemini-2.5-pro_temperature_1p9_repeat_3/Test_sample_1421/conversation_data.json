    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to derive the formula for the fermionic partition function using the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Starting Point - The Canonical Partition Function**\n\nIn quantum statistical mechanics, the partition function Z for a system in thermal equilibrium at inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is given by the trace of the statistical weight operator:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}})$\nHere, $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system, and the trace `Tr` is taken over a complete basis of the system's Hilbert space.\n\n**Step 2: Introducing Imaginary Time and Path Integrals**\n\nThe path integral formalism provides a way to calculate this trace. The core idea is to interpret the operator $e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$ as an evolution operator in *imaginary time*.\nIf we make the substitution $t = -i\\hbar\\beta$ in the standard time evolution operator $e^{-i\\hat{H}t/\\hbar}$, we get $e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$ (we will set $\\hbar=1$ from now on for simplicity). Thus, we are considering an \"evolution\" over a duration $\\beta$ in the imaginary time direction, denoted by $\\tau$.\n\nTo evaluate the trace, we break this imaginary time evolution into $N$ small steps of duration $\\epsilon = \\beta/N$:\n$e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}} = (e^{-\\epsilon \\hat{H}})^N$\nWe then insert a complete set of states between each of these small steps. For fermionic systems, the appropriate basis is that of **fermionic coherent states**.\n\n**Step 3: Fermionic Coherent States and Grassmann Variables**\n\nTo handle the anti-commuting nature of fermions (Pauli exclusion principle), we must use **Grassmann numbers** instead of ordinary complex numbers. Let $\\eta_i$ and $\\bar{\\eta}_i$ be a set of Grassmann variables corresponding to each fermionic mode $i$. They have the property that they anti-commute with each other:\n$\\{\\eta_i, \\eta_j\\} = \\eta_i \\eta_j + \\eta_j \\eta_i = 0$\n$\\{\\bar{\\eta}_i, \\bar{\\eta}_j\\} = 0$\n$\\{\\eta_i, \\bar{\\eta}_j\\} = 0$\nThis implies in particular that $\\eta_i^2 = 0$.\n\nA fermionic coherent state $|\\eta\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator $\\hat{c}_i$, and we have the relations:\n$\\hat{c}_i |\\eta\\rangle = \\eta_i |\\eta\\rangle$\n$\\langle \\bar{\\eta} | \\hat{c}_i^\\dagger = \\langle \\bar{\\eta} | \\bar{\\eta}_i$\n\nThe resolution of identity is given by:\n$\\hat{1} = \\int d\\bar{\\eta} d\\eta \\, e^{-\\sum_i \\bar{\\eta}_i \\eta_i} |\\eta\\rangle\\langle\\bar{\\eta}|$\nwhere the integration is the specific Berezin integral for Grassmann variables.\n\n**Step 4: Building the Path Integral Expression**\n\nBy inserting the identity operator $N-1$ times and using the trace property for fermions, we arrive at an integral over a set of Grassmann variables at each time slice. Taking the limit as $N \\to \\infty$ ($\\epsilon \\to 0$), this sum over time slices becomes a functional integral over continuous functions (paths) $\\eta(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\eta}(\\tau)$ defined on the imaginary time interval $[0, \\beta]$.\n\nThe resulting expression for the partition function is:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\eta} \\mathcal{D}\\eta \\, e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\eta}, \\eta]}$\nwhere:\n*   $\\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\eta} \\mathcal{D}\\eta$ is the functional measure, representing integration over all possible paths.\n*   $S_E[\\bar{\\eta}, \\eta]$ is the **Euclidean Action** for the fermionic system.\n\n**Step 5: The Euclidean Action and Boundary Conditions**\n\nThe Euclidean Action $S_E$ is obtained from the discretization process. It takes the form:\n$S_E[\\bar{\\eta}, \\eta] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, L_E(\\bar{\\eta}, \\eta) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\sum_i \\bar{\\eta}_i(\\tau) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} \\eta_i(\\tau) + H(\\bar{\\eta}(\\tau), \\eta(\\tau)) \\right]$\n\nLet's break down the components of the action:\n1.  **The \"Kinetic\" Term**: $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_i \\bar{\\eta}_i(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\eta_i(\\tau)$ comes from the overlap of coherent states at infinitesimally different times. It contains the time dynamics of the fields.\n2.  **The \"Potential\" Term**: $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, H(\\bar{\\eta}(\\tau), \\eta(\\tau))$ comes from the Hamiltonian. The function $H(\\bar{\\eta}, \\eta)$ is the c-number (or rather, Grassmann-number) representation of the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$. It is obtained by first writing $\\hat{H}$ in its normal-ordered form (all creation operators $\\hat{c}^\\dagger$ to the left of all annihilation operators $\\hat{c}$), and then simply replacing $\\hat{c}^\\dagger_i$ with $\\bar{\\eta}_i$ and $\\hat{c}_i$ with $\\eta_i$.\n\n**A Crucial Point: Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions**\n\nThe trace operation, $\\text{Tr}(\\hat{A}) = \\sum_n \\langle n | \\hat{A} | n \\rangle$, implies that the initial and final states must be the same. For fermions, the trace evaluated with coherent states takes a specific form that leads to **anti-periodic boundary conditions** in the imaginary time direction.\nThis means that the fields at the end of the imaginary time interval are the negative of the fields at the beginning:\n$\\eta_i(\\beta) = -\\eta_i(0)$\n$\\bar{\\eta}_i(\\beta) = -\\bar{\\eta}_i(0)$\nThis is a fundamental distinction from the bosonic case, where the boundary conditions are periodic. This sign difference is a direct quantum statistical effect stemming from the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields $\\eta(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\eta}(\\tau)$:\n\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\eta} \\mathcal{D}\\eta \\, e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\eta}, \\eta]}$\n\nwhere $S_E$ is the Euclidean action:\n\n$S_E[\\bar{\\eta}, \\eta] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\sum_i \\bar{\\eta}_i(\\tau) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} \\eta_i(\\tau) + H(\\bar{\\eta}(\\tau), \\eta(\\tau)) \\right]$\n\nThe components of this formula are:\n\n*   $\\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\eta} \\mathcal{D}\\eta$: The path integral measure over all Grassmann field histories.\n*   $\\bar{\\eta}_i(\\tau), \\eta_i(\\tau)$: Grassmann-valued fields representing the fermions, dependent on imaginary time $\\tau$.\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$: The length of the imaginary time interval, corresponding to the inverse temperature.\n*   $H(\\bar{\\eta}, \\eta)$: The Grassmann-valued symbol of the Hamiltonian, obtained by replacing creation operators $\\hat{c}^\\dagger_i$ with $\\bar{\\eta}_i$ and annihilation operators $\\hat{c}_i$ with $\\eta_i$ in the normal-ordered form of the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$.\n*   The integral is performed subject to **anti-periodic boundary conditions** for the Grassmann fields:\n    $\\eta_i(\\beta) = -\\eta_i(0)$\n    $\\bar{\\eta}_i(\\beta) = -\\bar{\\eta}_i(0)$\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in imaginary time path integral formalism is $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\eta} \\mathcal{D}\\eta \\, e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\eta}, \\eta]}$, where the Euclidean Action is $S_E[\\bar{\\eta}, \\eta] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\sum_i \\bar{\\eta}_i(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\eta_i(\\tau) + H(\\bar{\\eta}(\\tau), \\eta(\\tau)) \\right]$, and the path integral is performed over Grassmann fields that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions, $\\eta(\\beta) = -\\eta(0)$ and $\\bar{\\eta}(\\beta) = -\\bar{\\eta}(0)$.>>>"
