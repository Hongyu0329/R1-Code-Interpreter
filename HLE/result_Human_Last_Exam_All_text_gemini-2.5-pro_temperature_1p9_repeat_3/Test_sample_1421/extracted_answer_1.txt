The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in imaginary time path integral formalism is $Z = \int \mathcal{D}\bar{\eta} \mathcal{D}\eta \, e^{-S_E[\bar{\eta}, \eta]}$, where the Euclidean Action is $S_E[\bar{\eta}, \eta] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left[ \sum_i \bar{\eta}_i(\tau) \partial_\tau \eta_i(\tau) + H(\bar{\eta}(\tau), \eta(\tau)) \right]$, and the path integral is performed over Grassmann fields that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions, $\eta(\beta) = -\eta(0)$ and $\bar{\eta}(\beta) = -\bar{\eta}(0)$.
