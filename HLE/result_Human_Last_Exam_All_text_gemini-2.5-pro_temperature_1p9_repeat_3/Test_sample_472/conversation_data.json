    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line:\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThe meter is a Trochaic Septenarius, which consists of seven trochaic feet (`L S`) followed by a final, incomplete (catalectic) foot. The ideal pattern has 15 syllables: `L S | L S | L S | L S || L S | L S | L S | L^` (where `||` is the main caesura and `^` indicates a missing syllable). In Plautine comedy, several variations are allowed, most importantly the resolution of a long syllable (`L`) into two short ones (`S S`).\n\n**Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Hiatus**: The line contains 15 syllables. A potential elision between `bene` and `esse` (`ben(e) esse`) would reduce the count to 14, which does not fit the meter. Therefore, we must assume a *hiatus* (a break between vowels, with no elision), which is common in Plautus, especially at a pause or caesura.\n    The syllables are: `et | ti | bi | be | ne | es | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\n\n2.  **Determining Syllable Quantities**:\n    *   `et`: Long by position. The vowel `e` is followed by two consonants, `t` at the end of its own word and `t` at the start of the next (`tibi`). So, `et` is **L**.\n    *   `tibi`: Both `i` vowels are short by nature. `ti` is **S**, `bi` is **S**.\n    *   `bene`: Both `e` vowels are short by nature. `be` is **S**, `ne` is **S**.\n    *   `esse`: The first syllable `es-` is long by position because its vowel is followed by a double consonant `ss`. The final syllable `-se` contains a short `e`. So, `es` is **L**, `se` is **S**.\n    *   `soli`: The `o` in `solus` is long by nature (`s≈çlus`). The final `i` is short. So, `so` is **L**, `li` is **S**.\n    *   `quom`: This is equivalent to `cum`. Its vowel is followed by a final `m` before a word starting with a consonant (`sibi`), making it long by position. So, `quom` is **L**.\n    *   `sibi`: Both `i` vowels are short by nature. `si` is **S**, `bi` is **S**.\n    *   `sit`: The vowel `i` is short, but it becomes long by position as it's followed by `t` and the `m` of the next word (`male`). So, `sit` is **L**.\n    *   `male`: Both the `a` and the final `e` are short. `ma` is **S**, `le` is **S**.\n\n3.  **Grouping into Feet**: Now we arrange the sequence of long and short syllables into the seven and a half feet of the trochaic septenarius, applying Plautine substitution rules where necessary.\n\n    *   **Foot 1**: `et ti`\n        *   This is `L S`, a perfect trochee.\n\n    *   **Foot 2**: `bi be ne`\n        *   This is `S S S`. In a trochaic foot (`L S`), the initial long syllable can be \"resolved\" into two short ones. This substitution turns the `L S` foot into a three-syllable foot `S S S` (a tribrach). This is a common resolution.\n\n    *   **Foot 3**: `es se`\n        *   This is `L S`, a perfect trochee.\n\n    *   **Foot 4**: `so li`\n        *   This is `L S`, a perfect trochee. The main caesura (break in sense) falls here.\n\n    *   **Foot 5**: `quom si bi`\n        *   This is `L S S`. A trochaic foot (`L S`) can be replaced by a dactyl (`L S S`). This is another valid substitution.\n\n    *   **Foot 6**: `sit ma`\n        *   This is `L S`, a perfect trochee.\n\n    *   **Foot 7 (Catalectic)**: `le`\n        *   This is `S`. The final foot is incomplete (catalectic), consisting of a single syllable. The very last syllable of a line of Latin verse is considered *syllaba anceps*, meaning it can be either long or short without violating the meter. Therefore, the short `le` is a valid final syllable.\n\n**Final Scansion:**\n\nThe feet are divided and scanned as follows:\n*   Foot 1: `et ti` = `L S`\n*   Foot 2: `bi be ne` = `S S S`\n*   Foot 3: `es se` = `L S`\n*   Foot 4: `so li` = `L S`\n*   Foot 5: `quom si bi` = `L S S`\n*   Foot 6: `sit ma` = `L S`\n*   Foot 7: `le` = `S`\n\nCombining these with spaces between the feet gives the final answer.\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L S L S S L S S>>>"
