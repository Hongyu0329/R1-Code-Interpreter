    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices P1(s) and P2(s).\n\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2]\n\nP2 = [s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\nA polynomial matrix G(s) is a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s) if:\na) G(s) is a right divisor of both P1(s) and P2(s) (i.e., P1 = Q1*G and P2 = Q2*G for some polynomial matrices Q1 and Q2).\nb) Any other common right divisor D(s) is also a right divisor of G(s) (i.e., G = L*D for some polynomial matrix L).\n\nThe GCRD is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant).\n\n**2. Method of Solution**\n\nA standard method to find the GCRD is to use an extension of the Euclidean algorithm. We form a stacked matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] and perform elementary row operations to reduce it to the form [G(s); 0], where G(s) is an upper triangular matrix and 0 is a zero matrix. The resulting G(s) is a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Elementary row operations for polynomial matrices include:\n    1.  Swapping two rows.\n    2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n*   The polynomial arithmetic must be performed carefully at each step.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Form the stacked matrix M(s).**\nM(s) =\n[ s^2 + s,  -s     ]  (Row 1)\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2    ]  (Row 2)\n[ s,        0      ]  (Row 3)\n[ -s - 1,   1      ]  (Row 4)\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the matrix by creating a pivot row with constant entries.**\nWe can achieve this by adding Row 4 to Row 3.\n`R3_new = R3 + R4 = [s + (-s-1), 0 + 1] = [-1, 1]`\nThe matrix becomes:\nM' =\n[ s^2 + s,  -s     ]\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2    ]\n[ -1,       1      ]\n[ -s - 1,   1      ]\n\n**Step 3: Use the new simpler row to reduce the other rows.**\nLet's move the pivot row `[-1, 1]` to the top and normalize it.\nSwap R1 and R3:\nM'' =\n[ -1,       1      ]\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2    ]\n[ s^2 + s,  -s     ]\n[ -s - 1,   1      ]\n\nMultiply the new Row 1 by -1 to get a leading 1.\n`R1_new = -1 * [-1, 1] = [1, -1]`\nThe matrix is now:\nM''' =\n[ 1,       -1      ]\n[ -s^2 - 1, s^2    ]\n[ s^2 + s,  -s     ]\n[ -s - 1,   1      ]\n\n**Step 4: Eliminate the first column entries using the pivot row `[1, -1]`**\n*   `R2_new = R2 + (s^2+1)*R1_new = [-s^2-1, s^2] + (s^2+1)[1, -1] = [0, s^2 - (s^2+1)] = [0, -1]`\n*   `R3_new = R3 - (s^2+s)*R1_new = [s^2+s, -s] - (s^2+s)[1, -1] = [0, -s + (s^2+s)] = [0, s^2]`\n*   `R4_new = R4 + (s+1)*R1_new = [-s-1, 1] + (s+1)[1, -1] = [0, 1 - (s+1)] = [0, -s]`\n\nThe matrix transforms to:\nM'''' =\n[ 1, -1   ]\n[ 0, -1   ]\n[ 0, s^2  ]\n[ 0, -s   ]\n\n**Step 5: Reduce the second column.**\nThe row `[0, -1]` is an excellent pivot. Let's normalize it.\n`R2_new = -1 * [0, -1] = [0, 1]`\nThe matrix becomes:\nM''''' =\n[ 1, -1   ]\n[ 0, 1    ]\n[ 0, s^2  ]\n[ 0, -s   ]\n\nNow, use the new pivot row `[0, 1]` to eliminate other entries in the second column.\n*   `R1_new = R1 + R2_new = [1, -1] + [0, 1] = [1, 0]`\n*   `R3_new = R3 - s^2 * R2_new = [0, s^2] - s^2[0, 1] = [0, 0]`\n*   `R4_new = R4 + s * R2_new = [0, -s] + s[0, 1] = [0, 0]`\n\n**Step 6: Final reduced matrix.**\nAfter these operations, the matrix is:\n[ 1, 0 ]\n[ 0, 1 ]\n[ 0, 0 ]\n[ 0, 0 ]\n\nThis is in the form [G(s); 0].\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe non-zero part of the final matrix is G(s).\nG(s) = [1, 0;\n        0, 1]\nThis is the 2x2 identity matrix, denoted by I.\n\nThus, the greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the identity matrix. This means P1 and P2 are right coprime.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
