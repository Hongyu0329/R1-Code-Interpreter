No. Polynucleotides, including homopolynucleotides, are not structurally polysaccharides. They differ fundamentally in their monomeric units (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), the chemical bonds that link these units (phosphodiester bonds vs. glycosidic bonds), and the chemical composition of their backbone (sugar-phosphate vs. sugar-only).
