    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ (viewed as a locally posetal 2-category) from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint), satisfying the inequalities $id_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$ and $L \\circ R \\le id_{[n]}$. Here, $[k]$ denotes the totally ordered set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$, and for two maps $f, g: [a] \\to [b]$, the relation $f \\le g$ means $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [a]$.\n\nLet's analyze these conditions for $m=23$ and $n=37$. We are looking for the number of pairs of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$ such that:\n1.  For all $i \\in [23]$, $i \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$.\n2.  For all $j \\in [37]$, $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le j$.\n\nThis pair $(L, R)$ forms an adjunction. It can be shown that such an adjunction is completely determined by the following data:\n- A subset $Y \\subseteq [23]$.\n- A subset $X \\subseteq [37]$.\n- An order-isomorphism $\\phi: Y \\to X$.\n\nThe maps $L$ and $R$ are then constructed from this data, and conversely, any adjunction $(L, R)$ gives rise to such a triple. Let's describe the correspondence and constraints on $X$ and $Y$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Characterization of the adjunctions:**\n    An adjunction $(L, R)$ between $[m]$ and $[n]$ is uniquely determined by a triple $(Y, X, \\phi)$ where:\n    *   $Y$ is a subset of $[m]$.\n    *   $X$ is a subset of $[n]$.\n    *   $\\phi: Y \\to X$ is an order-isomorphism.\n\n    The maps $L$ and $R$ are determined by this triple, and the conditions on $Y$ and $X$ are derived from the adjunction inequalities.\n    Let $f = R \\circ L$ and $g = L \\circ R$. The conditions are $f \\ge id_{[m]}$ and $g \\le id_{[n]}$. Also, one can show that $f$ and $g$ are idempotent (i.e., $f \\circ f = f$ and $g \\circ g = g$).\n    *   $f: [m] \\to [m]$ is an order-preserving, inflationary ($f \\ge id_{[m]}$), idempotent map. Such a map is determined by its image, let's call it $Y = \\mathrm{Im}(f)$. For any $i \\in [m]$, $f(i) = \\min\\{y \\in Y \\mid y \\ge i\\}$. For this to be defined for all $i$, especially $i=m$, we must have $m \\in Y$.\n    *   $g: [n] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving, deflationary ($g \\le id_{[n]}$), idempotent map. Such a map is determined by its image, let's call it $X = \\mathrm{Im}(g)$. For any $j \\in [n]$, $g(j) = \\max\\{x \\in X \\mid x \\le j\\}$. For this to be defined for all $j$, especially $j=0$, we must have $0 \\in X$.\n    *   Furthermore, one can show that $L$ maps $Y$ isomorphically to $X$, and $R$ maps $X$ isomorphically to $Y$, with these maps being inverses of each other. So we need an order-isomorphism $\\phi: Y \\to X$.\n\n2.  **Counting the possibilities:**\n    We need to count the number of such triples $(Y, X, \\phi)$. The existence of an order-isomorphism $\\phi$ between $Y$ and $X$ implies that they must have the same finite cardinality. Let's call this cardinality $k$. For any two totally ordered finite sets of the same cardinality $k$, there exists exactly one order-isomorphism between them.\n    So, the problem reduces to counting pairs of subsets $(Y, X)$ with the specified properties and the same cardinality.\n\n3.  **Counting the subsets:**\n    *   **For Y:** We need to find the number of subsets $Y \\subseteq [23] = \\{0, 1, ..., 23\\}$ that contain $23$ and have size $k$. Since $23$ must be in $Y$, we need to choose the remaining $k-1$ elements from the set $[23] \\setminus \\{23\\} = \\{0, 1, ..., 22\\}$. The size of this set is $23$. The number of ways to choose $k-1$ elements is $\\binom{23}{k-1}$.\n    *   **For X:** We need to find the number of subsets $X \\subseteq [37] = \\{0, 1, ..., 37\\}$ that contain $0$ and have size $k$. Since $0$ must be in $X$, we need to choose the remaining $k-1$ elements from the set $[37] \\setminus \\{0\\} = \\{1, 2, ..., 37\\}$. The size of this set is $37$. The number of ways to choose $k-1$ elements is $\\binom{37}{k-1}$.\n\n4.  **Summing over all possible sizes k:**\n    The size $k$ of the subsets $Y$ and $X$ can range from a minimum of 1 (e.g., $Y=\\{23\\}, X=\\{0\\}$) up to the maximum possible size.\n    The size of $[23]$ is $24$. The size of $[37]$ is $38$.\n    So $k$ can range from $1$ to $\\min(24, 38) = 24$.\n\n    The total number of adjunctions is the sum over all possible values of $k$ of the product of the number of choices for $Y$ and $X$:\n    Total number = $\\sum_{k=1}^{24} \\left(\\text{ways to choose Y of size k}\\right) \\times \\left(\\text{ways to choose X of size k}\\right)$\n    Total number = $\\sum_{k=1}^{24} \\binom{23}{k-1} \\binom{37}{k-1}$\n\n5.  **Evaluating the sum:**\n    Let $j = k-1$. As $k$ goes from $1$ to $24$, $j$ goes from $0$ to $23$. The sum becomes:\n    Total number = $\\sum_{j=0}^{23} \\binom{23}{j} \\binom{37}{j}$\n\n    This sum can be calculated using Vandermonde's Identity, which states that $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{r}{k} \\binom{s}{n-k} = \\binom{r+s}{n}$.\n    We use the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$. Let's apply it to the second term: $\\binom{37}{j} = \\binom{37}{37-j}$.\n    The sum is $\\sum_{j=0}^{23} \\binom{23}{j} \\binom{37}{37-j}$.\n    This perfectly matches Vandermonde's Identity with $r=23$, $s=37$, and $n=37$. The summation index $j$ corresponds to $k$ in the identity formula. The summation is over the correct range, since for $j>23$, $\\binom{23}{j}=0$.\n    So, the sum is:\n    $\\binom{23 + 37}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ in $\\Delta$ is $\\binom{60}{37}$. Note that $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$."
