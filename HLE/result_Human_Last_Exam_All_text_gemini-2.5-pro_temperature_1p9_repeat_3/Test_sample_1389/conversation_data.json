    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Define Key Terms\n\nThe question asks us to compare two measures of vaccine efficacy under a specific vaccine model.\n\n*   **Quantity to Evaluate:** `1 - incidence rate ratio` (let's call this `VE_IR`). This is the standard measure of vaccine efficacy reported from clinical trials.\n    *   Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = (Incidence Rate in Vaccinated) / (Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated)\n    *   So, `VE_IR = 1 - (IR_v / IR_u)`\n*   **True Parameter to Estimate:** `per-exposure vaccine efficacy` (let's call this `VE_p`). This represents the biological efficacy of the vaccine in preventing infection from a single exposure event. It's also known as vaccine efficacy against susceptibility.\n*   **The Model:** The vaccine is an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine (also known as a \"perfect\" or \"take\" vaccine).\n\n### Step 2: Formalize the \"All-or-Nothing\" Vaccine Model\n\nIn an \"all-or-nothing\" model, the vaccine works perfectly for some people but not at all for others.\n*   Let `p` be the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are fully and perfectly protected. For this group, the probability of infection is 0. Their efficacy is 100%.\n*   The remaining proportion, `1-p`, of vaccinated individuals receive no protection at all. Their risk of infection is identical to that of an unvaccinated person. Their efficacy is 0%.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Trial-Based Efficacy (`VE_IR`)\n\nThis metric is based on comparing the rate of new infections in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups over a period of time.\n*   Let `IR_u` be the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n*   To find the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`), we consider it as a mixture of two sub-groups:\n    *   The `p` proportion that is fully protected contributes 0 new cases.\n    *   The `1-p` proportion that is unprotected will experience new cases at the same rate as the unvaccinated group, `IR_u`.\n*   The overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group is the weighted average:\n    `IR_v = (p * 0) + ((1-p) * IR_u) = (1-p) * IR_u`\n*   Now, we can calculate `VE_IR`:\n    `VE_IR = 1 - (IR_v / IR_u)`\n    `VE_IR = 1 - ((1-p) * IR_u / IR_u)`\n    `VE_IR = 1 - (1-p)`\n    `VE_IR = p`\n*   So, the efficacy measured by the incidence rate ratio is exactly `p`, the proportion of people who are fully protected.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Per-Exposure Efficacy (`VE_p`)\n\nThis metric refers to the average reduction in susceptibility to infection from a single exposure for a randomly chosen person from the vaccinated group.\n*   Let `S_u` be the susceptibility (probability of infection per exposure) of an unvaccinated individual.\n*   For the vaccinated group, we again have a mixture:\n    *   The `p` proportion that is fully protected has a susceptibility `S_v` of 0.\n    *   The `1-p` proportion that is unprotected has a susceptibility `S_v` equal to `S_u`.\n*   The *average* susceptibility for the vaccinated group (`S_v_avg`) is the weighted average:\n    `S_v_avg = (p * 0) + ((1-p) * S_u) = (1-p) * S_u`\n*   The per-exposure efficacy is the proportional reduction in this average susceptibility compared to the unvaccinated group:\n    `VE_p = 1 - (S_v_avg / S_u)`\n    `VE_p = 1 - ((1-p) * S_u / S_u)`\n    `VE_p = 1 - (1-p)`\n    `VE_p = p`\n*   So, the true per-exposure efficacy for the vaccinated population is also `p`.\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Two Measures and Conclude\n\n*   From Step 3, we found that `VE_IR = p`.\n*   From Step 4, we found that `VE_p = p`.\n\nSince `VE_IR = VE_p`, the measure `1 - incidence rate ratio` perfectly and accurately estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n### Careful Points:\n1.  **Model Specificity:** This conclusion is specific to the \"all-or-nothing\" model. For other models, like a \"leaky\" vaccine (where all vaccinated individuals have a partial reduction in susceptibility), the conclusion would still be the same, but the reasoning and the meaning of the efficacy value would be different.\n2.  **Average Efficacy:** It's important to recognize that \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" for a group is an average concept. The efficacy for any single individual in this model is either 100% or 0%, but the population-level parameter is the average of these, which is `p`.\n3.  **Assumptions:** This analysis assumes no other biases are present, such as behavioral changes post-vaccination (risk compensation) or differing exposure rates between groups, as would be expected in a well-designed randomized controlled trial.\n\nFinal Answer: The `1 - incidence rate ratio` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
