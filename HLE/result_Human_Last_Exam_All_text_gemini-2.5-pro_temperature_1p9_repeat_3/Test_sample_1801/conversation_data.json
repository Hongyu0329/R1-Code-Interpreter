    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron commercial.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** Two individuals.\n    *   **Qualification:** They must be Nobel laureates (either at the time or subsequently).\n    *   **Context:** Featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n    *   **Timeframe:** The year 2000.\n    *   **Identifier:** The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n    *   **Tone:** The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" which alludes to the dramatic collapse of Enron due to massive accounting fraud shortly after the ad campaign ran.\n\n2.  **List of Careful Points:**\n    *   **Verify the Campaign:** The first step is to confirm the existence and details of Enron's \"Ask Why\" ad campaign from 2000. This campaign is well-documented as part of Enron's effort to rebrand itself from an energy pipeline company to an innovative, forward-thinking global marketplace.\n    *   **Identify Participants:** The campaign featured several public intellectuals and thinkers in short, minimalistic spots. It is necessary to find a list of these participants.\n    *   **Check Nobel Status:** Once potential names are identified, each must be checked against the official list of Nobel Prize winners. It's a key point that one of the individuals won their prize *after* appearing in the commercial, but the question asks which \"Nobel laureates were featured,\" using their current status.\n    *   **Confirm Two Laureates:** The question specifically asks for two, so the final answer must contain precisely two names.\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Researching the Enron \"Ask Why\" campaign confirms it ran in 2000 and featured several notable individuals, including author and technology writer George Gilder and investor strategist Barton Biggs.\n    *   **Step 2:** Among the featured personalities, two are directly linked to the Nobel Prize. These individuals are John Nash and Paul Krugman.\n    *   **Step 3:** Verify the Nobel credentials of each individual.\n        *   **John Forbes Nash Jr.:** He was a co-recipient of the **1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences** for his work on game theory. He was already a Nobel laureate when the commercial was filmed.\n        *   **Paul Krugman:** He was awarded the **2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences** for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity. Although he was not a laureate at the time of the commercial in 2000, he was already a highly respected Princeton economist and columnist. He fits the description of a \"Nobel laureate who was featured\" in the ad.\n    *   **Step 4:** Conclude that the two Nobel laureates who appeared in the infamous Enron \"Ask Why\" commercials are John Nash and Paul Krugman. The infamy stems from the irony of a company built on deception using a campaign that promoted inquiry and transparency, featuring intellectuals associated with logic and economic truth.\n\n<<<John Nash and Paul Krugman>>>"
