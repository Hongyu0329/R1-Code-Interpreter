    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Visual Analysis**\n\nFirst, we look at the character 謄 as it is commonly written. It appears to be composed of two parts:\n*   On the left: 月\n*   On the right: 朕\n\nIf we were to guess the radical based on this visual form, the most likely candidate would be the left-side component, 月, which is a common radical part known as a 'hen' (偏).\n\n**Step 2: Checking for Consistency (Stroke Count)**\n\nA key method to verify a character's structure is its official stroke count.\n*   The component 月 has 4 strokes.\n*   The component 朕 has 10 strokes.\n*   The sum of these strokes is 4 + 10 = 14 strokes.\n*   However, official Japanese sources and dictionaries list 謄 as having **16 strokes**.\n\nThis discrepancy tells us that our initial visual decomposition of 月 + 朕 is incorrect for the purposes of lexicographical classification and stroke counting. The character is not built this way in the standard system.\n\n**Step 3: Understanding Kanji Classification for Simplified Characters**\n\nThe reason for the discrepancy is historical. Many modern Japanese characters (shinjitai) are simplified versions of older, more complex characters (kyūjitai). For consistency in dictionaries, these simplified characters are often still classified under the radical of their original, traditional form, even if that radical is no longer visually present.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Traditional Radical**\n\nWe need to find out how 謄 is traditionally classified. Reputable kanji dictionaries (such as the Kangxi dictionary system, on which Japanese classification is based) place 謄 under the **言 (speech, word)** radical.\n\nThis is because the character 謄 is a modification of an older form that was explicitly composed of the radical 言 (on the left) and a phonetic component 滕 (on the right). Although the modern character has been simplified in a way that hides the 言 radical, it retains its original classification for dictionary look-up purposes.\n\n**Step 5: Naming the Radical**\n\n*   The radical is **言**.\n*   The Japanese name for this radical is \"gon\" (ごん).\n*   When a radical appears on the left side of a character (as 言 does in the traditional form of 謄), it is called a \"hen\" (へん).\n*   The specific name for the 言 radical when it is on the left is **Gonben (ごんべん)**.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer Formulation**\n\nFollowing the example provided in the question (\"媛\" -> \"Onnahen\"), we need to provide the specific name of the radical part, which includes its position. Therefore, the correct name is \"Gonben\". The Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\".\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
