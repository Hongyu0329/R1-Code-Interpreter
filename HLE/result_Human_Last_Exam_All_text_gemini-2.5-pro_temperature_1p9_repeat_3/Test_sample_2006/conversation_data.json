    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **The Title as a Question:** The prompt states, \"The title is a question...\". The title is \"The Bays\".\n2.  **The Answer Format:** The answer should be presented \"in alphabetical order\". This implies the answer consists of multiple words.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Puns and Homophones:** Riddles often rely on words that sound alike but have different meanings. \"The Bays\" is the key to the entire puzzle.\n*   **Interpreting Clues:** Each line of the haiku is a clue that needs to be deciphered. These clues may involve numbers, historical figures, or common phrases.\n*   **Thematic Consistency:** Often, the answers to a complex riddle share a common theme. Identifying this theme can help confirm the individual parts of the answer.\n*   **Alphabetical Ordering:** The final step is to arrange the discovered words in alphabetical order, as explicitly instructed.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Decipher the Title \"The Bays\"**\n\nThe title \"The Bays\" is a homophone for \"The B's\". This is the central question of the riddle. It is asking for a list of words that start with the letter 'B'.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Clue: \"An August tempest\"**\n\n*   This line points to the word **Bible**.\n*   **\"August\"**: This can refer to Emperor Augustus. A famous decree from Caesar Augustus for a census is a key event at the beginning of the nativity story in the New Testament (Luke 2:1).\n*   **\"August\"**: The word \"august\" also means \"respected and impressive,\" a fitting description for the Bible.\n*   **\"Tempest\"**: The Bible contains numerous stories involving tempests (powerful storms), such as the story of Jonah and the great fish, or Jesus calming the storm on the Sea of Galilee.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Clue: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n\n*   This line points to the word **Betrayal**.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen\"**: This calculates to 30 (2 * 15 = 30).\n*   **\"Thirty\"**: This number is a direct reference to the \"thirty pieces of silver\" for which Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus.\n*   **\"Brings winds of change\"**: The act of betrayal was a pivotal moment that led to the crucifixion and subsequent events, representing a significant \"wind of change\" in the Christian narrative.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Third Clue: \"A divine one yields\"**\n\n*   This line points to the word **Blessing**.\n*   **\"A divine one\"**: This is a clear description of a deity, or God.\n*   **\"Yields\"**: This word means to produce, provide, or give.\n*   Therefore, the line describes something that a divine being gives, which is a **Blessing**.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble and Order the Final Answer**\n\nThe three words derived from the haiku are **Bible**, **Betrayal**, and **Blessing**. The instructions require the answer to be in alphabetical order.\n\n1.  **Be**trayal\n2.  **Bi**ble\n3.  **Bl**essing\n\nThe correct alphabetical order is Betrayal, Bible, Blessing.\n\n<<<Betrayal, Bible, Blessing>>>"
