    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain `F`.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a 2x2 matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has its eigenvalues at `λ = -1 ± j`.\n\nGiven matrices:\nA = [[-1, 1],\n     [ 1, 0]]\nB = [[1, 2],\n     [1, 0]]\n\n### **2. Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **Problem Formulation**: The closed-loop matrix is explicitly given as `A + BF`. We must adhere to this form. This corresponds to a feedback law `u = Fx` resulting in `x_dot = (A+BF)x`, or a law `u = -Kx` where `F = -K`. The calculation remains the same regardless of the control law interpretation.\n*   **System Type**: This is a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) system because the input vector `u` is 2x1 (implied by B being 2x2).\n*   **Non-uniqueness of Solution**: For multi-input systems, the state feedback gain matrix `F` that achieves a desired pole placement is generally not unique. There are infinite solutions. We need to find one valid solution. A common technique is to simplify the problem by setting some elements of `F` to zero.\n*   **Controllability**: Pole placement is only possible if the system `(A, B)` is controllable. We should verify this first.\n*   **Characteristic Polynomial**: For a 2x2 matrix `M`, the characteristic polynomial is `det(λI - M) = λ² - trace(M)λ + det(M)`. This is a useful shortcut.\n*   **Desired Eigenvalues**: The desired eigenvalues `λ = -1 ± j` must form a complex conjugate pair for a real system, which they do.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Check Controllability**\nThe controllability matrix is `C = [B | AB]`. The system is controllable if `rank(C) = n`, where `n=2` is the order of the system.\nFirst, calculate the product `AB`:\n`AB = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] * [[1, 2], [1, 0]] = [[-1*1 + 1*1, -1*2 + 1*0], [1*1 + 0*1, 1*2 + 0*0]] = [[0, -2], [1, 2]]`\nThe controllability matrix is:\n`C = [B | AB] = [[1, 2, 0, -2], [1, 0, 1, 2]]`\nTo find the rank of `C`, we can check if it has two linearly independent columns. The first two columns are the matrix `B`. The determinant of `B` is `det(B) = (1)(0) - (2)(1) = -2 ≠ 0`. Since `det(B)` is non-zero, the columns of `B` are linearly independent, and `rank(B) = 2`. Because `B` is a submatrix of `C`, `rank(C)` must be at least 2. Since `C` has only 2 rows, `rank(C)` cannot be greater than 2. Therefore, `rank(C) = 2`.\nThe system is controllable, so pole placement is possible.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`.\nThe desired characteristic polynomial, `p_d(λ)`, is:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j² = λ² + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p_d(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Closed-Loop Matrix `A_cl = A + BF`**\nLet the feedback gain matrix be `F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`.\nFirst, calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\nNow, form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\n**Step 4: Find the Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`**\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `p_cl(λ) = λ² - trace(A_cl)λ + det(A_cl)`.\n`trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃) + f₂ = f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1`\n`det(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃)(f₂) - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁)`\n`det(A_cl) = -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄)`\n`det(A_cl) = -1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄`\nSo, `p_cl(λ) = λ² - (f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1)λ + (-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄)`.\n\n**Step 5: Equate Coefficients**\nCompare the coefficients of `p_cl(λ)` with `p_d(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`.\n1.  Coefficient of λ: `-(f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1) = 2`\n    `f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1 = -2`\n    `f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1` (Equation I)\n2.  Constant term: `-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 2`\n    `-f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 3` (Equation II)\n\n**Step 6: Solve for `F`**\nWe have two equations with four unknowns (`f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄`). This confirms that the solution is not unique. We can find a specific solution by setting some variables to zero. A simple choice is to set `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`.\nWith `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`, the equations simplify to:\n(I) `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n(II) `-f₁ - 2f₂ = 3`\n\nNow, solve this system of two linear equations.\nAdd Equation (I) to Equation (II):\n`(f₁ + f₂) + (-f₁ - 2f₂) = -1 + 3`\n`-f₂ = 2`\n`f₂ = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f₂ = -2` into Equation (I):\n`f₁ + (-2) = -1`\n`f₁ = 1`\n\nSo, one possible solution for `F` is `f₁ = 1`, `f₂ = -2`, `f₃ = 0`, `f₄ = 0`.\n\nThe state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Step 7: Verification (Optional)**\nLet's check if this `F` gives the correct eigenvalues.\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThe roots of this equation are `λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)) / 2 = -1 ± j`.\nThe verification is successful.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
