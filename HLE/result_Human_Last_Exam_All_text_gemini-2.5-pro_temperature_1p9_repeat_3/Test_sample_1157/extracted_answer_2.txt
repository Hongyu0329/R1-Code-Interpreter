The appropriate management involves a phased approach starting with immediate medical stabilization of her uncontrolled diabetes, followed by local wound care of the avulsed tooth sockets. The cells of interest are primarily those involved in wound healing and immunity (neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, endothelial cells), whose function is impaired by diabetes. For definitive tooth replacement, the most suitable option is a Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD) made of a Chromium-Cobalt alloy with acrylic teeth and base. The abutment teeth would be the left second premolar and a tooth on the right side (e.g., the canine) for clasping, with a critical support rest placed on the cingulum of the left central incisor. This conservative design avoids high-risk surgery while providing the necessary support, stability, and retention.
