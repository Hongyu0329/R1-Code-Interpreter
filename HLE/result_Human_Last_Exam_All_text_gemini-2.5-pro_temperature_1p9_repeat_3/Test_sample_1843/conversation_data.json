    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of Dirichlet characters and the properties of primitive characters.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the character\n\nLet $\\chi$ be a Dirichlet character modulo $N = 36036$. We are looking for the number of such characters that are **primitive** and have **order 6**.\n\n1.  **Factorization of the modulus N**:\n    First, we factorize the conductor $N$ into its prime power components:\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n2.  **Decomposition of the character**:\n    A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters modulo each prime power factor:\n    $\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$,\n    where each $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a character modulo $p^k$.\n\n3.  **Condition for being primitive**:\n    A character $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p^k}$ is primitive modulo the respective prime power $p^k$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its components: $f(\\chi) = f(\\chi_{4})f(\\chi_{9})f(\\chi_{7})f(\\chi_{11})f(\\chi_{13})$. For $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $N$, we need $f(\\chi_{p^k}) = p^k$ for each prime power in the factorization of $N$.\n\n4.  **Condition on the order**:\n    The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{9}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n    We are given that this order must be 6.\n\nSo, the problem boils down to counting the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_{4}, \\chi_{9}, \\chi_{7}, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that:\na) Each $\\chi_{p^k}$ is primitive.\nb) $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\n### Step 2: Find the number of primitive characters for each component\n\nFor the lcm to be 6, the order of each component character must be a divisor of 6. Let's find the number of available primitive characters for each modulus whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. It has one principal character (conductor 1, order 1) and one non-principal character. This non-principal character must be primitive (conductor 4) and has order 2. So, there is **1** primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. A character is primitive if its conductor is 9. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$. The non-primitive characters are those induced from modulus 3, which have orders 1 and 2. Thus, the primitive characters mod 9 cannot have order 1 or 2. Since the group is cyclic of order 6, the possible orders for primitive characters are 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$. These are primitive.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$. These are primitive.\n    So, there are **4** choices for $\\chi_9$: 2 of order 3, and 2 of order 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. A character is primitive if it is not the principal character. We need its order to divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $1 + 2 + 2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. We need primitive characters whose order divides 6. The only possible order is 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    There is only **1** choice for $\\chi_{11}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. We need primitive characters whose order divides 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1 + 2 + 2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the results\n\nWe need to choose a tuple $(\\chi_{4}, \\chi_{9}, \\chi_{7}, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ from the sets of characters determined above, such that their lcm of orders is exactly 6. Let $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$.\n\nThe possible orders are:\n*   $o_{4} \\in \\{2\\}$\n*   $o_{9} \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_{7} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_{11} \\in \\{2\\}$\n*   $o_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nFor $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6$, we need two conditions to be met:\n1.  At least one order must be divisible by 2.\n2.  At least one order must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet's check these conditions for any valid combination:\n*   Condition 1: Since $\\chi_4$ must be primitive, its order must be 2. So $o_4=2$. This condition is always satisfied.\n*   Condition 2: Since $\\chi_9$ must be primitive, its order must be 3 or 6. In either case, its order is divisible by 3. So $o_9$ is always divisible by 3. This condition is also always satisfied.\n\nSince every possible combination of these primitive characters will have an lcm of orders equal to 6, we just need to multiply the number of choices for each component.\n\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: 4 (2 of order 3 + 2 of order 6)\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: 5 (1 of order 2 + 2 of order 3 + 2 of order 6)\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1 (1 of order 2)\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: 5 (1 of order 2 + 2 of order 3 + 2 of order 6)\n\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nThere are 100 such characters."
