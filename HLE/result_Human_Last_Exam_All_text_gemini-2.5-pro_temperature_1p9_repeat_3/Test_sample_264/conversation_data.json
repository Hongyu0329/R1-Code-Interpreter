    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the coordinate system and the first cube\nTo analyze the problem, we'll place the first cube (C1) in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's define C1 as the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n*   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\nThis is a cube with a side length of 1, with one vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) and the opposite vertex at (1, 1, 1). The volume of this cube is `1 * 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Define the main diagonal and the shift vector\nThe main diagonal of this cube connects opposite vertices, for instance, from (0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is `v = <1, 1, 1>`.\n\nThe problem states the second cube is \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" relative to the first one.\n\n**Careful Point:** This phrasing can be ambiguous.\n*   **Interpretation A:** The shift distance (magnitude) is 1/2. The shift vector would be `(1/2) * (unit vector of v) = (1/2) * <1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3> = <1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)>`.\n*   **Interpretation B:** The shift is `1/2` for each component of the diagonal vector. The shift vector `S` would be `(1/2) * v = (1/2) * <1, 1, 1> = <1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`.\n\nIn the context of such geometry problems, Interpretation B is the standard and intended one. It implies that for a movement \"along the diagonal\", the displacement in each coordinate axis is the same. Thus, we will use the shift vector `S = <1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`.\n\n### Step 3: Define the position of the second cube\nThe second cube (C2) is the first cube (C1) shifted by the vector `S = <1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`. To find the boundaries of C2, we add the shift vector's components to the boundaries of C1.\nSo, C2 is the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n### Step 4: Find the region of intersection\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where a point (x, y, z) belongs to *both* C1 and C2. To find this region, we need to find the overlap for each coordinate's range.\n\n*   **x-axis overlap:** The range for C1 is `[0, 1]`. The range for C2 is `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **y-axis overlap:** The range for C1 is `[0, 1]`. The range for C2 is `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **z-axis overlap:** The range for C1 is `[0, 1]`. The range for C2 is `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The resulting intersection is a shape whose coordinates (x, y, z) must satisfy all three overlapping ranges. This shape is a rectangular prism (specifically, another cube).\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the volume of the intersection\nThe intersection is a cube defined by:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\nTo find the volume of this smaller cube, we first find its side length.\n*   Side length in x-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in y-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in z-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe intersection is a cube with a side length of 1/2. The volume `V_intersection` is calculated as:\n`V_intersection = (side length)^3 = (1/2)^3 = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8`\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
