    "To determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group $G$, we will analyze the properties of such subgroups by studying the homomorphisms from $G$ to the symmetric group $S_4$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Relating Subgroups to Homomorphisms:** The number of subgroups of index $n$ in a group $G$ corresponds to the number of equivalence classes of transitive group actions of $G$ on a set of $n$ elements. Each such action is defined by a homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to S_n$ with a transitive image. A subgroup $H$ of index 4 in $G$ defines a transitive action of $G$ on the set of four left cosets $G/H$. This action corresponds to a homomorphism $\\phi_H: G \\to \\text{Sym}(G/H) \\cong S_4$. The image of this homomorphism, let's call it $T$, must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n2.  **Properties of the Grigorchuk Group and its Homomorphic Images:**\n    *   The Grigorchuk group $G$ is an infinite 2-group, which means that every element in $G$ has an order that is a power of 2.\n    *   Consequently, any finite homomorphic image of $G$ must be a finite 2-group. The order of $T = \\phi(G)$ must be a power of 2.\n    *   Furthermore, $G$ is generated by involutions (elements of order 2). This implies that any homomorphic image of $G$, including $T$, must also be generated by involutions.\n\n3.  **Identifying Possible Image Groups in $S_4$:** We list the transitive subgroups of $S_4$ and check if they satisfy the properties from Step 2.\n    *   $S_4$: Order 24, not a 2-group.\n    *   $A_4$: Order 12, not a 2-group.\n    *   $D_4$ (Dihedral group of order 8): Order is $2^3$, so it's a 2-group. It can be generated by two involutions (e.g., reflections). This is a possible image.\n    *   $V_4$ (Klein four-group): Order is $2^2$, a 2-group. It is generated by any two of its non-identity elements, which are all involutions. This is a possible image.\n    *   $C_4$ (Cyclic group of order 4): Order is $2^2$, a 2-group. However, it is cyclic and cannot be generated by its only element of order 2. So, $C_4$ cannot be an image of $G$.\n    Thus, the only possible images for the transitive action are $T=D_4$ or $T=V_4$.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Structure of the Subgroup:** Let $H$ be a subgroup of index 4. The homomorphism $\\phi_H: G \\to S_4$ has kernel $N = \\ker(\\phi_H) = \\text{core}_G(H)$, which is the largest normal subgroup of $G$ contained in $H$. The image $T$ is isomorphic to $G/N$.\n    *   **Case 1: $T \\cong V_4$.**\n        In this case, $|G/N| = |V_4| = 4$. We have a chain of subgroups $N \\subseteq H \\subset G$. The indices are $[G:H]=4$ and $[G:N]=4$. This implies $H=N$. Thus, $H$ must be a normal subgroup of $G$ with the quotient group $G/H \\cong V_4$.\n    *   **Case 2: $T \\cong D_4$.**\n        In this case, $|G/N| = |D_4| = 8$. We have $N \\subseteq H \\subset G$. The indices are $[G:H]=4$ and $[G:N]=8$, which implies $[H:N]=2$. This means $H/N$ is a subgroup of index 2 in $G/N \\cong D_4$. By definition of the core, $H$ corresponds to a subgroup $H/N$ in $G/N$ that is \"core-free,\" i.e., it contains no non-trivial normal subgroups of $G/N$.\n\n5.  **Ruling out the $D_4$ Case:** A subgroup of index 2 in any group is always a normal subgroup. Let $K = H/N$. Since $K$ has index 2 in $D_4$, it is a normal subgroup of $D_4$. The core of $K$ in $D_4$ is $K$ itself. For $K$ to be core-free, we must have $K = \\{e\\}$ (the trivial subgroup). However, a subgroup of index 2 in $D_4$ must have order $|D_4|/2 = 4$, so it cannot be the trivial subgroup. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no subgroups of index 4 in $G$ for which the corresponding image $T$ is $D_4$.\n\n6.  **Counting Subgroups in the $V_4$ Case:** From the above analysis, all subgroups of index 4 in $G$ must be normal subgroups with a quotient isomorphic to $V_4$. We need to count the number of such subgroups.\n    The number of normal subgroups $H$ with $G/H \\cong V_4$ is given by $|\\text{Epi}(G, V_4)| / |\\text{Aut}(V_4)|$, where $\\text{Epi}(G, V_4)$ is the set of surjective homomorphisms from $G$ to $V_4$.\n    *   Any homomorphism from $G$ to an abelian group like $V_4$ factors through its abelianization, $G_{ab} = G/[G,G]$.\n    *   It is a known result that the abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is $G_{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\n    *   So, $|\\text{Epi}(G, V_4)| = |\\text{Epi}(G_{ab}, V_4)| = |\\text{Epi}((\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3, (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2)|$. This is the number of surjective linear maps from a 3D vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ to a 2D vector space over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n    *   The total number of linear maps is $(2^2)^{\\text{dim}((\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3)} = 4^3 = 64$.\n    *   The non-surjective maps are those whose image is a proper subspace of $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. The proper subspaces are the {0} subspace and the three 1-dimensional subspaces.\n        *   Number of maps with image {0} is 1.\n        *   Number of 1D subspaces is $(2^2-1)/(2-1) = 3$. For each 1D subspace, there are $2^3-1=7$ non-zero linear maps from $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ to it. So, $3 \\times 7 = 21$ maps.\n        *   Total non-surjective maps: $1 + 21 = 22$.\n    *   Number of surjective maps = Total maps - Non-surjective maps = $64 - 22 = 42$.\n    *   The automorphism group of $V_4$ is $GL(2, \\mathbb{F}_2)$, and its order is $(2^2-1)(2^2-2) = 6$.\n    *   The number of distinct normal subgroups of index 4 is $42/6 = 7$.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, all subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group must be normal subgroups with a quotient isomorphic to the Klein four-group $V_4$. The number of such subgroups is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
