The final state of the system, after the gate Q is applied but before measurement, is given by the normalized vector $\frac{1}{\sqrt{22}} (2|0\rangle + 2|1\rangle + 3|2\rangle + 2|3\rangle + |4\rangle)$. Upon measurement, this state will collapse to $|0\rangle, |1\rangle, |2\rangle, |3\rangle, or |4\rangle$ with probabilities $\frac{4}{22}, \frac{4}{22}, \frac{9}{22}, \frac{4}{22}, and \frac{1}{22}$ respectively.
