Based on its role in promoting T cell survival, persistence, and a potent memory phenotype, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit a significantly **increased release of effector cytokines**, such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), upon stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. The IL-15-supported cells would be less exhausted and functionally more robust, leading to a stronger anti-tumor response.
