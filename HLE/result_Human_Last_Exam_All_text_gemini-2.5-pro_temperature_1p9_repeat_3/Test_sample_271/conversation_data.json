    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\n\nLet $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe try to group terms to find a common factor.\nLet's group terms with coefficients that are multiples of 3, and the rest.\n$P(x) = (3x^2 + 18x - 6) + (x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3)$\n$P(x) = 3(x^2 + 6x - 2) + x^3(x^4 - 2x^2 - 9)$. This is not fruitful.\n\nLet's try grouping by another pattern.\n$P(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nThis is also not correct due to sign issues with $18x$.\nLet's try the factorization I used in scratchpad.\n$P(x) = 3(x^2 - 2) + x(x^6 - 2x^4 - 9x^2 + 18)$\nThe second term can be factored by grouping:\n$x^6 - 2x^4 - 9x^2 + 18 = x^4(x^2-2) - 9(x^2-2) = (x^4-9)(x^2-2)$.\nSo, $P(x) = 3(x^2-2) + x(x^4-9)(x^2-2)$.\nWe can factor out $(x^2-2)$:\n$P(x) = (x^2 - 2) [3 + x(x^4 - 9)]$\n$P(x) = (x^2 - 2) (3 + x^5 - 9x)$\n$P(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\n\nLet $f(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe splitting field $K$ of $P(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois groups of the factors**\n\n*   **For f(x) = x^2 - 2:**\n    The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The Galois group is $Gal(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_2$.\n\n*   **For g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3:**\n    1.  **Irreducibility:** We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$.\n        - The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3.\n        - All other coefficients (0 for $x^4$, 0 for $x^3$, -9 for $x$, 3 for constant term) are divisible by 3.\n        - The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n        Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    2.  **Galois Group:** Since $g(x)$ is an irreducible quintic, its Galois group $G_g = Gal(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. We analyze the roots of $g(x)$ to determine the group.\n        $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are at $x^4=9/5$, which gives two real solutions $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. This means $g(x)$ can have at most three real roots.\n        Let's evaluate $g(x)$ at integer points:\n        $g(-2) = -32 + 18 + 3 = -11 < 0$\n        $g(-1) = -1 + 9 + 3 = 11 > 0$ (a root between -2 and -1)\n        $g(1) = 1 - 9 + 3 = -5 < 0$ (a root between -1 and 1, specifically 0 and 1 as g(0)=3)\n        $g(2) = 32 - 18 + 3 = 17 > 0$ (a root between 1 and 2)\n        So, $g(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots.\n        An irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ having exactly $p-2$ real roots has the symmetric group $S_p$ as its Galois group. Here $p=5$, so the Galois group of $g(x)$ is $S_5$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of K/Q**\n\n$K$ is the splitting field of $P(x)$, which is the compositum of $K_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $K_g$, the splitting field of $g(x)$.\nThe Galois group $G = Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the direct product $Gal(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times Gal(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ if and only if $K_f \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$K_f$ is a normal extension of degree 2. If $K_f \\cap K_g \\neq \\mathbb{Q}$, then $K_f \\subseteq K_g$. This would mean $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a subfield of $K_g$.\nThe only quadratic subfield of $K_g$ (whose Galois group is $S_5$) is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $g(x) = x^5-9x+3$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n a^{n-1} + (1-n)^{n-1}b^{n-1})$.\nFor $g(x)$, $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$D = (-1)^{10} (5^5 (-9)^4 + (-4)^4 (3)^4) = 5^5 \\cdot 3^8 + 4^4 \\cdot 3^4 = 3^4(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + 4^4) = 81(3125 \\cdot 81 + 256) = 81(253125+256) = 81 \\cdot 253381$.\nFor $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we would need $D = 2s^2$ for some rational $s$. However, $D$ is a large positive integer, not divisible by 2. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSo, $K_f \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, $G = Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong Gal(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times Gal(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of $G$ is $|G| = |S_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the degrees of normal intermediate fields**\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, a field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq L \\subseteq K$ is normal if and only if its corresponding Galois subgroup $H = Gal(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G = Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\nWe are looking for all possible values of $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ where $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$. This means we need to find the indices of all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G=S_2 \\times S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $S_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, the alternating group $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ are not always of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$. Additional \"skew\" subgroups can exist if there is an isomorphism between non-trivial sections of $G_1$ and $G_2$ which are centralized by the respective groups.\n1.  **Product-type normal subgroups:** $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\vartriangleleft S_2$ and $N_2 \\vartriangleleft S_5$.\n    The proper, non-trivial subgroups are:\n    -   $S_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: Order is 2. Index is $240/2 = 120$.\n    -   $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$: Order is $|A_5| = 60$. Index is $240/60 = 4$.\n    -   $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$: Order is $|S_5| = 120$. Index is $240/120 = 2$.\n    -   $S_2 \\times A_5$: Order is $2 \\cdot 60 = 120$. Index is $240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **Skew-type normal subgroups:** These arise from isomorphisms $\\phi: H_1/K_1 \\to H_2/K_2$ where $H_i, K_i \\vartriangleleft G_i$ and the action of $G_i$ on $H_i/K_i$ by conjugation is trivial.\n    -   From $S_2$, the only non-trivial section with trivial $S_2$-action is $S_2/\\{e\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    -   From $S_5$, the only non-trivial section with trivial $S_5$-action is $S_5/A_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    Since these two sections are isomorphic, there is one non-trivial isomorphism $\\phi: S_2/\\{e\\} \\to S_5/A_5$. This gives rise to one skew normal subgroup $H_{skew} = \\{(g, h) \\in S_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\phi(g\\{e\\}) = hA_5\\}$.\n    This subgroup has order $|S_5| = 120$. Its index is $240/120=2$.\n\n**Step 5: List the possible degrees**\n\nThe indices of the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_2 \\times S_5$ are:\n-   120 (from $S_2 \\times \\{e\\}$)\n-   4 (from $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$)\n-   2 (from $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$, $S_2 \\times A_5$, and $H_{skew}$)\n\nThe set of all possible degrees for such normal intermediate fields $L$ is the set of these index values.\nPossible degrees are $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
