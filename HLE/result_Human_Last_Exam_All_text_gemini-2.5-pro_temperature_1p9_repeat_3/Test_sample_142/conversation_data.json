    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a Full CI calculation.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)**\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of electrons in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. We do this by summing the atomic numbers (which equal the number of electrons in a neutral atom) of all atoms in the molecule.\n*   Carbon (C): 1 atom, Atomic Number = 6  -> 6 electrons\n*   Silicon (Si): 1 atom, Atomic Number = 14 -> 14 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 3 atoms, Atomic Number = 1  -> 3 x 1 = 3 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 1 atom, Atomic Number = 9 -> 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons, N = 6 + 14 + 3 + 9 = 32 electrons.\nThis is an even number of electrons, so the ground state will be a singlet state (Total Spin, S=0).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (K)**\n\nNext, we determine the number of atomic orbitals (basis functions) for the given 6-31G** basis set. The `**` notation, also written as 6-31G(d,p), means that a set of d-type polarization functions is added to all heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and a set of p-type polarization functions is added to all hydrogen atoms. We assume the standard use of 6 Cartesian d-functions and 3 p-functions.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 6-31G part gives a split-valence representation of the 1s orbital, resulting in 2 s-type basis functions.\n    *   The second `*` adds one set of p-functions (p_x, p_y, p_z), which consists of 3 functions.\n    *   Total per H atom = 2 (s) + 3 (p) = 5 basis functions.\n    *   For 3 H atoms: 3 * 5 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Carbon (C, a 2nd-row atom):**\n    *   The 6-31G part provides 9 basis functions ([3s2p] contraction: 3 s-type and 2x3=6 p-type functions).\n    *   The first `*` adds one set of d-functions. We use 6 Cartesian d-functions ($d_{x^2}, d_{y^2}, d_{z^2}, d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}$).\n    *   Total per C atom = 9 (s,p) + 6 (d) = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Fluorine (F, a 2nd-row atom):**\n    *   Same as Carbon.\n    *   Total per F atom = 9 (s,p) + 6 (d) = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si, a 3rd-row atom):**\n    *   The 6-31G part for a 3rd-row element provides 13 basis functions ([4s3p] contraction: 4 s-type and 3x3=9 p-type functions).\n    *   The first `*` adds one set of 6 Cartesian d-functions.\n    *   Total per Si atom = 13 (s,p) + 6 (d) = 19 basis functions.\n\n*   **Total basis functions (K):**\n    *   K = (functions for C) + (functions for Si) + 3 * (functions for H) + (functions for F)\n    *   K = 15 + 19 + 15 + 15 = 64 basis functions.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of CSFs**\n\nA Full CI calculation considers all possible arrangements of the N electrons in the K spatial orbitals. The number of CSFs for a system with N electrons in K orbitals for a state of total spin S is given by the formula:\n\n$N_{CSF}(K, N, S) = \\binom{K}{N/2 - S}\\binom{K}{N/2 + S} - \\binom{K}{N/2 - S - 1}\\binom{K}{N/2 + S + 1}$\n\nFor the ground state of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$, we have:\n*   Number of spatial orbitals, K = 64\n*   Number of electrons, N = 32\n*   Total spin, S = 0 (for a singlet state)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n*   $N/2 = 32 / 2 = 16$\n*   $N/2 - S = 16 - 0 = 16$\n*   $N/2 + S = 16 + 0 = 16$\n*   $N/2 - S - 1 = 15$\n*   $N/2 + S + 1 = 17$\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}\\binom{64}{16} - \\binom{64}{15}\\binom{64}{17}$\n\n**Step 4: Compute the binomial coefficients and the final answer**\n\nNow we calculate the values of the binomial coefficients. These are very large numbers, so a calculator or software capable of handling large integers is needed.\n\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = 63,219,007,132,740$\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = 193,608,221,855,650$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = 547,748,435,920,000$\n\nNow, we compute the final number:\n*   $\\left(\\binom{64}{16}\\right)^2 = (193,608,221,855,650)^2 = 37,484,541,755,750,560,938,014,922,500$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} \\times \\binom{64}{17} = (63,219,007,132,740) \\times (547,748,435,920,000) = 34,625,607,025,699,350,539,692,800,000$\n\nFinally, we take the difference:\n$N_{CSF} = 37,484,541,755,750,560,938,014,922,500 - 34,625,607,025,699,350,539,692,800,000$\n$N_{CSF} = 2,858,934,730,051,210,398,322,122,500$\n\nIn scientific notation, this is approximately $2.859 \\times 10^{27}$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Correctly summing electrons for all atoms.\n*   Correctly interpreting the basis set notation (6-31G**), especially for different row elements (H, 2nd, 3rd).\n*   Correctly accounting for polarization functions and using the standard number of Cartesian functions (6d, 3p). An alternative (5d) would change the result.\n*   Selecting the appropriate formula for singlet (S=0) CSFs.\n*   Using a high-precision calculator or software to handle the extremely large numbers involved in the binomial coefficients and final calculation to avoid overflow or rounding errors.\n\n<<<2858934730051210398322122500>>>"
