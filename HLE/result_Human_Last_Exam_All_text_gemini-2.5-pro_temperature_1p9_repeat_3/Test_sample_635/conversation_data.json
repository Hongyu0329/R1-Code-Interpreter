    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the following conditions:\na. $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$.\nb. $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\nc. $D(s)$ is an invertible matrix (i.e., its determinant, $\\det(D(s))$, is not identically zero).\n\nThe condition of being left coprime means that the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ must have full row rank for all complex values of $s$. This is equivalent to saying that the only common left divisors of $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are unimodular matrices (polynomial matrices with a constant non-zero determinant).\n\n**2. Pole Analysis and Minimal Order**\nFirst, let's analyze the poles of the system, which will determine the required complexity of our denominator matrix $D(s)$. The poles of a multivariable system are the roots of the pole polynomial, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of all minors of $H(s)$.\n\nThe entries of $H(s)$ are:\n$H_{11}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$\n$H_{12}(s) = 1$\n$H_{21}(s) = \\frac{2}{s^2-1}$\n$H_{22}(s) = 0$\n\nThe minors are:\n- 1x1 minors: The entries themselves. Their denominators are $(s+1)$, $1$, and $(s^2-1)$. The LCM is $s^2-1$.\n- 2x2 minor (the determinant):\n$\\det(H(s)) = \\left(\\frac{s-1}{s+1}\\right)(0) - (1)\\left(\\frac{2}{s^2-1}\\right) = -\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$.\nThe denominator is $s^2-1$.\n\nThe LCM of all these denominators is $\\phi(s) = s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$. The degree of this polynomial is 2. This is the McMillan degree of the system.\nFor a coprime factorization, the determinant of $D(s)$ must be proportional to this pole polynomial, i.e., $\\det(D(s)) = c \\cdot (s^2-1)$ for some non-zero constant $c$. The degree of $\\det(D(s))$ must be 2.\n\n**3. Constructing the Denominator Matrix D(s)**\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. The product $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ must be a polynomial matrix. This imposes constraints on the entries of $D(s)$.\n\nLet's look at the first row of $N(s)$:\n$\\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) \\\\ n_{12}(s) \\end{bmatrix}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\end{bmatrix}$\nFor both entries to be polynomials, we need:\n- $d_{11}(s)$ must be a polynomial. This is given by the problem definition.\n- $d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$ must be a polynomial. Clearing the denominator, this requires $d_{11}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}$ to be divisible by $(s-1)(s+1)$. This implies:\n    - At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(0)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$. So $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor $(s-1)$.\n    - At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-2)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n\nLet's find the simplest polynomials for the first row of $D(s)$ that satisfy these conditions. Let's try constant $d_{11}(s)=1$. The second condition becomes $2(1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(-1)=-2$.\nThe first condition requires $d_{12}(s)$ to have a factor $(s-1)$. Let's try the simplest form, $d_{12}(s) = c(s-1)$. Then $d_{12}(-1) = c(-2) = -2c$. So we have $-2c = -2 \\implies c=1$.\nThus, a candidate for the first row of $D(s)$ is $[d_{11}(s), d_{12}(s)] = [1, s-1]$.\n\nNow, for the second row of $D(s)$, $[d_{21}(s), d_{22}(s)]$, the same conditions must apply to make its product with $H(s)$ polynomial:\n- $d_{22}(1) = 0$.\n- $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n\nWe need to choose $d_{21}$ and $d_{22}$ to satisfy these, be linearly independent of the first row, and make $\\deg(\\det(D(s))) = 2$.\nLet's try a simple form for $d_{21}(s)$, say $d_{21}(s)=s$.\nThe condition $2d_{21}(-1)+d_{22}(-1)=0$ becomes $2(-1) + d_{22}(-1)=0 \\implies d_{22}(-1)=2$.\nThe condition $d_{22}(1)=0$ requires a root at $s=1$. Let's try a linear polynomial for $d_{22}(s)=as+b$.\n- $d_{22}(1) = a+b = 0 \\implies b=-a$.\n- $d_{22}(-1) = -a+b = 2$.\nSubstituting $b=-a$ gives $-a-a = 2 \\implies -2a=2 \\implies a=-1$. Then $b=1$.\nSo, $d_{22}(s) = -s+1 = -(s-1)$.\nA candidate for the second row of $D(s)$ is $[s, -(s-1)]$.\n\nOur candidate matrix $D(s)$ is:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s & -(s-1) \\end{bmatrix}$\nLet's check its determinant:\n$\\det(D(s)) = (1)(-(s-1)) - (s-1)(s) = -(s-1) - s(s-1) = (s-1)(-1-s) = -(s-1)(s+1) = -(s^2-1)$.\nThe degree of the determinant is 2, which matches the McMillan degree. This is a strong indication that we are on the right track.\n\n**4. Calculate the Numerator Matrix N(s)**\nNow we find $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s & -(s-1) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nFirst row of $N(s)$:\n$n_{11}(s) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} = \\frac{s+1}{s+1} = 1$.\n$n_{12}(s) = 1 \\cdot 1 + (s-1) \\cdot 0 = 1$.\n\nSecond row of $N(s)$:\n$n_{21}(s) = s \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} - (s-1) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{s(s-1)}{s+1} - \\frac{2}{s+1} = \\frac{s^2-s-2}{s+1} = \\frac{(s-2)(s+1)}{s+1} = s-2$.\n$n_{22}(s) = s \\cdot 1 - (s-1) \\cdot 0 = s$.\n\nSo, the numerator matrix is:\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-2 & s \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**5. Verify Coprimeness**\nWe must check that $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full rank (rank 2) for all $s$. The rank can only drop at the roots of $\\det(D(s))$, i.e., at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n$[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ s & -(s-1) & s-2 & s \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n- Check at $s=1$:\n$[D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. The two rows are linearly independent (e.g., subtracting them gives $[0, 0, 2, 0]$), so the rank is 2.\n\n- Check at $s=-1$:\n$[D(-1) \\quad N(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -3 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$. The two rows are linearly independent (e.g., adding them gives $[0, 0, -2, 0]$), so the rank is 2.\n\nSince the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all $s$, the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. The factorization is correct and coprime.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nA left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s & -(s-1) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-2 & s \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s & 1-s \\end{bmatrix}$, $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-2 & s \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
