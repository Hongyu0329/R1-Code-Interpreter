The function `f` and the formula `C` are defined as follows:

Let `\bot` be the multiplicative false constant in linear logic. We define exponentiation with `\otimes` such that `A^{\otimes n} = \underbrace{A \otimes A \otimes \dots \otimes A}_{n \text{ times}}` for `n > 0`, and `A^{\otimes 0} = 1` (the multiplicative true constant).

1.  The function `f` maps a natural number `w` to the linear logic formula:
    $$
    f(w) = \bot^{\otimes w}
    $$

2.  The linear formula `C = C(W, m, b)` is:
    $$
    C = (\bot^{\otimes b})^{\otimes m}
    $$
