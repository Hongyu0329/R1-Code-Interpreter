    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of such functions. We want to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the basic properties of any function $f \\in S$.**\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. The given equation implies $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, any function $f \\in S$ is injective.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** We are given that $f$ is continuous. A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. So, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Fixed Points:** A fixed point of $f$ is a value $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. If such a point exists, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. But we are given $f(f(x_0)) = e^{x_0}$. Thus, any fixed point must satisfy $x_0 = e^{x_0}$. The equation $x = e^x$ has no real solutions (since $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$). Therefore, any function $f \\in S$ cannot have fixed points.\n\n**Step 2: Rule out the case of a strictly decreasing function.**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$.\nConsider the function $g(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f$ is continuous, $g$ is also continuous.\nLet's analyze the limits of $g(x)$ at $\\pm \\infty$.\nSince $f$ is strictly decreasing, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$ exists, it's either a finite value $M$ or $-\\infty$. In either case, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (f(x) - x) = -\\infty$.\nSimilarly, $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ exists, it's either a finite value $L$ or $+\\infty$. In either case, $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (f(x) - x) = +\\infty$.\nSince $g(x)$ is a continuous function that goes from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist a point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(x_0) = 0$. This means $f(x_0) = x_0$, so $x_0$ is a fixed point of $f$.\nThis contradicts our finding from Step 1 that $f$ can have no fixed points.\nTherefore, no function in $S$ can be strictly decreasing.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the properties of a strictly increasing function.**\n\nSo, any function $f \\in S$ must be strictly increasing.\n\n1.  **Asymptotic Behavior:** Since $f$ is strictly increasing, the limits $L = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ and $M = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$ exist (and can be infinite). The range of $f$ is the interval $(L, M)$.\n    -   As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(f(x)) \\to \\infty$ since $e^x \\to \\infty$. Since $f$ is increasing, this implies that $M = \\infty$.\n    -   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(f(x)) \\to 0$ since $e^x \\to 0$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x) \\to L$. So $\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = 0$.\n        If $L = -\\infty$, then $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = 0$. This would mean $f$ is not strictly increasing (it would have to level off at 0). This is a contradiction. A strictly increasing function cannot have a finite limit as its argument goes to $-\\infty$ unless it is bounded below. The limit must be $-\\infty$. Oh wait. $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty}f(y) = L$. Yes, my bad. So $\\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} f(y)$ would be $-\\infty$, not 0. Let's re-evaluate. If $L=-\\infty$, then $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y=f(x) \\to -\\infty} f(y) = -\\infty$. But $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = 0$. So $-\\infty=0$, a contradiction.\n        Therefore, $L$ must be a finite real number. Let's call it $a$. So, $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = a$.\n        By continuity of $f$, we have $\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y) = f(a)$. So, $f(a) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Range and Domain Properties:**\n    -   The range of $f$ is $(a, \\infty)$.\n    -   Since $f(a)=0$ and $a$ is in the domain $\\mathbb{R}$, $0$ is in the set of values attained by $f$. The range is $(a, \\infty)$, so we must have $0 \\in (a, \\infty)$, which implies $a < 0$.\n    -   To summarize, any solution $f$ must be strictly increasing, and there is a unique $a<0$ associated with it, such that $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = a$ and $f(a)=0$.\n\n**Step 4: Constructing the solutions.**\n\nThe properties derived above allow us to construct all possible solutions. A solution $f$ is uniquely determined by the choice of $a \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ and the definition of $f$ on a \"seed\" interval.\n\n1.  **Choice of `a`:** The parameter $a$ can be any negative real number. For each different $a$, we get a different function $f$ because their ranges $(a, \\infty)$ will be different. The set of choices for $a$ is $(-\\infty, 0)$, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n2.  **Construction of `f` for a given `a`:**\n    Let's fix $a < 0$. We have $f(a)=0$.\n    From $f(f(x))=e^x$, we can find values of $f$ at specific points:\n    $f(0) = f(f(a)) = e^a$. Let $c=e^a$. Note that since $a<0$, we have $0<c<1$.\n    $f(c) = f(e^a) = f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$.\n    Let's choose a \"seed\" function. Let $f_0: [a, 0] \\to [0, c]$ be an arbitrary continuous and strictly increasing function such that $f_0(a) = 0$ and $f_0(0) = c = e^a$. We will define $f(x) = f_0(x)$ for $x \\in [a,0]$.\n    This initial choice determines the rest of the function $f$ on its entire domain $\\mathbb{R}$:\n    -   For $x \\in [0, c]$, we must have $x = f(y)$ for some unique $y \\in [a, 0]$. Specifically, $y = f_0^{-1}(x)$. The equation $f(f(y))=e^y$ then defines $f(x)$ as $f(x) = e^y = e^{f_0^{-1}(x)}$. This defines a strictly increasing continuous function on $[0, c]$ mapping it to $[c, 1]$.\n    -   This process can be iterated. We can define $f$ over a sequence of intervals that partition $[a, \\infty)$.\n    -   For $x \\in (-\\infty, a)$, let $y = f(x)$. Since $f$ is increasing, $y$ must be in $(a, 0)$. Then $f(y) = f(f(x)) = e^x$. Since $y \\in (a,0)$, $f(y)$ is determined by our initial seed function: $f(y) = f_0(y)$. So $f_0(y) = e^x$, which gives $y = f_0^{-1}(e^x)$. Therefore, for $x \\in (-\\infty, a)$, we have $f(x) = f_0^{-1}(e^x)$. This function is continuous and strictly increasing, and maps $(-\\infty, a)$ to $(a, 0)$, and it satisfies $\\lim_{x\\to a^-}f(x)=0$ and $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}f(x)=a$.\n\n3.  **Counting the choices:** A solution is uniquely specified by the pair $(a, f_0)$.\n    -   The number of choices for $a \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    -   For each fixed $a$, we need to choose the seed function $f_0: [a, 0] \\to [0, e^a]$. The number of such functions is the number of increasing homeomorphisms between two closed intervals. This number is known to be $\\mathfrak{c}$. To see this, we can construct an injective map from $(0,1)$ into the set of such homeomorphisms. For each $p \\in (0,1)$, consider a function that maps the midpoint $(a/2)$ to $p \\cdot e^a$ and is piecewise linear. This shows there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions. The number of such continuous functions is also at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, since a continuous function on a closed interval is determined by its values on a countable dense set (like the rationals), so there are at most $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$ of them.\n\n**Step 5: Final Cardinality Calculation.**\n\nThe total number of solutions is the number of possible pairs $(a, f_0)$. This is the product of the cardinalities of the sets of choices for each component.\nTotal number of solutions = (Number of choices for $a$) $\\times$ (Number of choices for $f_0$)\n$|S| = \\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$, which is the same as the cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n<<<c>>>"
