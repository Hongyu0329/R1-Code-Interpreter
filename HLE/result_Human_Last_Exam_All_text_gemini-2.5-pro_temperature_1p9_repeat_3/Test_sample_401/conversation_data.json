    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Terms\n\n*   **Continuum (not necessarily metric):** In general topology, a continuum is a compact, connected, Hausdorff space. The qualifier \"not necessarily metric\" is crucial, as some properties of continua only hold in the metric case.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. (A subcontinuum is a closed, connected subset. A proper subcontinuum is one that is not equal to the whole space $X$).\n*   **Composant:** For a point $p$ in a continuum $X$, its composant, $C_p$, is the set of all points $q \\in X$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $p$ and $q$. The collection of all distinct composants of a continuum forms a partition of the space.\n\n### Step 2: Determining the Lower Bound for the Number of Composants\n\nThe question is about the *smallest* possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum. Let's see if it can be 1.\n\n1.  If a continuum $X$ has only one composant, that single composant must be the entire space, $X$.\n2.  There is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory: **In an indecomposable continuum, every composant is a boundary set.** A set is a boundary set if its complement is dense in the space.\n3.  If a composant $C$ were the entire space $X$, its complement $X \\setminus C$ would be the empty set $\\emptyset$. The empty set is not dense in a non-empty space like a continuum.\n4.  This creates a contradiction. Therefore, no composant of an indecomposable continuum can be the whole space.\n5.  Since the composants must partition the entire space, there must be more than one of them.\n6.  This establishes that the smallest possible number of composants is at least **2**.\n\n*Careful Point:* For a *decomposable* continuum, it is possible to have only one composant. For example, in the interval $[0,1]$, any two points can be connected by a chain of proper subcontinua, so all points belong to a single composant. The theorem mentioned in point 2 applies specifically to *indecomposable* continua.\n\n### Step 3: Determining if the Lower Bound is Achievable\n\nNow we know the number of composants must be at least 2. The next question is whether an indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants can exist.\n\n1.  **For metric continua:** There is a theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz which states that in an indecomposable *metric* continuum, every composant is a meager set (or a set of the first category). The Baire Category Theorem states that a complete metric space (and a compact metric space is complete) cannot be the countable union of meager sets. Since the composants partition the space, there must be an *uncountable* number of them. Therefore, a metric indecomposable continuum cannot have 2 (or any finite or countable number of) composants. The number of composants in this case is always $c$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n2.  **For non-metric continua:** The restriction to metric spaces in the argument above is critical. The proof that composants are meager relies on the space having a countable base, a property that non-metric spaces may not have. The question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric\", so we must consider this broader class of spaces.\n\n3.  **Existence of an example:** The mathematician David P. Bellamy provided an explicit construction of such a space. In his 1971 paper \"A non-metric indecomposable continuum\" (Duke Mathematical Journal, Vol. 38, No. 1), he constructed a non-metric continuum that is indecomposable and has **exactly two** composants.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the previous steps:\n*   An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. Thus, the minimum number is at least 2.\n*   An example of a non-metric indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants exists (Bellamy's construction).\n*   Therefore, the lower bound of 2 is achievable.\n\nThe smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
