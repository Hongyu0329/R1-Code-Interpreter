    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question Step by Step**\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an initial value problem (IVP) and find the value of the solution at a specific time.\n*   **The Differential Equation:** The given ordinary differential equation (ODE) is $x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$. This is a first-order, non-linear ODE.\n*   **The Initial Condition:** We are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. This means when the input variable $t$ is 0, the value of the function $x$ is -8.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the value of the function $x(t)$ when $t=1$, which is denoted as $x(1)$.\n\nTo solve this, we will first find the general solution to the differential equation. Then, we will use the initial condition to find the particular solution. Finally, we will use this particular solution to calculate $x(1)$.\n\n**2. List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Identify the type of ODE:** The equation is in the form $x' = f(t)g(x)$, which means it is a separable equation. We can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ and group the $x$ terms with $dx$ and the $t$ terms with $dt$.\n*   **Check for constant solutions:** We will be dividing by $x^2$. We should check if $x(t) = 0$ is a solution. If we plug $x(t)=0$ into the ODE, we get $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is true. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8 \\neq 0$, so the solution we are looking for is not the constant solution. We can safely divide by $x^2$.\n*   **Integration:** Be careful when integrating both sides. The integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ (or $x^{-2}$) is $-\\frac{1}{x}$, not $\\ln|x^2|$. Don't forget the constant of integration, $C$.\n*   **Applying the Initial Condition:** When using the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ to find the constant $C$, be meticulous with the algebraic signs and values.\n*   **Final Calculation:** Ensure the arithmetic for the final calculation of $x(1)$ is correct, especially when dealing with fractions.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Separate the variables**\nStart with the given differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nSince $x(t)$ is not the zero function, we can divide by $x^2$ and multiply by $dt$ to separate the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Integrate both sides**\nNow, integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nThe left side integral is $\\int x^{-2} dx = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\nThe right side integral is $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\nCombining these with a constant of integration $C$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Apply the initial condition to find the constant C**\nUse the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. Substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = C\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Write the particular solution**\nNow substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this IVP:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Find the value of x(1)**\nThe goal is to find $x(1)$. Substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo combine the fractions on the right side, find a common denominator (which is 8):\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides to solve for $x(1)$:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
