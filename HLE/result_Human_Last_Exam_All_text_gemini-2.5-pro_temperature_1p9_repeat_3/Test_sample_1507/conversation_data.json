    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Object:** The question is about the **great icosahedron**. This is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex (star) polyhedra. It is constructed from 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces.\n\n2.  **Understand the \"Outer-Hull\":** The term \"outer-hull\" refers to the **convex hull** of the polyhedron. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that completely encloses the object. You can visualize this by imagining stretching a rubber sheet over the points of the great icosahedron; the resulting shape is its convex hull.\n\n3.  **Determine the Shape of the Outer-Hull:** The great icosahedron has 12 vertices. The arrangement of these 12 vertices in space is identical to the arrangement of the vertices of a **regular icosahedron**. Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Task: \"Triangulating the outer-hull\":** The task is to find the number of triangles on the surface of this outer-hull (the regular icosahedron).\n    *   A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid.\n    *   By definition, a regular icosahedron is a polyhedron made up of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces.\n    *   Since the faces of the outer-hull are already triangles, the surface is already triangulated.\n\n5.  **Interpret \"Minimal Number\":** The question asks for the \"minimal number\" of triangles. Since the faces of the regular icosahedron are already triangles, we don't need to subdivide them further. Thus, the minimal number of triangles required to form the surface is simply the number of faces the regular icosahedron has.\n\n6.  **Interpret \"Visible Triangles from the Outside\":** This part of the question clarifies the intent. When viewing the great icosahedron from the outside, the parts you see form its convex hull. The intersecting faces inside the structure are not visible. The \"visible triangles\" are therefore the faces of the convex hull.\n\n7.  **Count the Triangles:** A regular icosahedron has **20** triangular faces.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. The surface of a regular icosahedron is composed of 20 triangles. This is the minimal triangulation of its surface.\n\n<<<20>>>"
