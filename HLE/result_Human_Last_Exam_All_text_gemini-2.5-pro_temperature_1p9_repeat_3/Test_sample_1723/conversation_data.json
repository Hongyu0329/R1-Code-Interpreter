    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for the name of a *single genus* of mushroom. The key identifying characteristic is that it is \"known to produce a distinctly blue spore print.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Core Claim about Spore Prints\nA spore print is a crucial tool in mushroom identification. It's made by placing a mushroom cap on a surface (often paper) and allowing its spores to fall and create a pattern. The color of these spores is a key genetic trait.\nThe common spore print colors are:\n*   White, Cream, Yellowish\n*   Pink, Salmon\n*   Ochre, Rusty Brown, Cinnamon Brown\n*   Dark Brown, Purple-Brown, Purplish-Black\n*   Black\n\n### Step 3: Identify Careful Points and Potential Ambiguities\n*   **\"Distinctly blue\":** This is a very specific color. It is not grayish, purplish-black, or any other shade.\n*   **\"Known to produce\":** This phrase can be interpreted in two ways:\n    1.  It is scientifically documented and accepted that this genus produces a blue spore print.\n    2.  It is popularly or famously known for this trait, even if the information is technically a misconception.\n*   **Scientific Accuracy:** From a strictly mycological standpoint, a true, distinctly blue spore print is not known to exist in the fungal kingdom. Green spore prints are exceptionally rare (e.g., *Chlorophyllum molybdites*), but blue is considered non-existent. This suggests the question may be based on a common misunderstanding.\n\n### Step 4: Investigate Potential Candidates\nGiven that a scientifically accurate blue spore print is not a reality, we must look for a genus that is strongly associated with the color blue in other ways, leading to the misconception.\n\n*   **Genus *Lactarius***: The species *Lactarius indigo* is a striking indigo blue mushroom. However, its spore print is cream to yellowish.\n*   **Genus *Cortinarius***: This genus contains many species with vibrant blue and violet caps, like *Cortinarius violaceus*. However, all *Cortinarius* species have a rusty brown spore print.\n*   **Blue-staining Boletes (e.g., Genus *Gyroporus*)**: Some boletes, like *Gyroporus cyanescens*, instantly stain dark blue when cut or bruised. This is a chemical reaction in the mushroom's flesh, not the color of the spores. Their spore print is pale yellow.\n*   **Genus *Entoloma***: This is the most likely candidate. The genus contains the species ***Entoloma hochstetteri***, native to New Zealand and India. This mushroom is famous for its incredibly vivid, entirely blue coloration. Because the mushroom itself is so uniquely and thoroughly blue, it is often *mistakenly* believed to have a blue spore print.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Analysis\n*   No genus is scientifically documented to produce a blue spore print.\n*   The question states that a genus is \"known to\" have this feature.\n*   The genus *Entoloma* contains the iconic, brilliantly blue *Entoloma hochstetteri*.\n*   This species' striking appearance has led to the popular (but incorrect) belief that it produces a blue spore print. In reality, the spore print for the genus *Entoloma* is characteristically pink or pinkish-brown.\n*   Therefore, *Entoloma* is the genus that fits the description of being \"known\" for this characteristic, even if that knowledge is a popular misconception.\n\nBased on this analysis, the intended answer is the genus that is famously associated with the color blue.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
