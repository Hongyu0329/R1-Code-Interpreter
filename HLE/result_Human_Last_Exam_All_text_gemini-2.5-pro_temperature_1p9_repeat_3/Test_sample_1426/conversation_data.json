    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Piece and Section:** The piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". The specific section is the very end of the symphony, which is the final measure of the 4th movement (Finale: Allegro con fuoco).\n\n2.  **Locate the Score and Instrument Part:** To find the answer, one must consult the full orchestral score. Within the score, we need to locate the staff for the \"Violino I\" or \"First Violin\".\n\n3.  **Examine the Final Measure:** Looking at the last bar of the symphony for the first violin part, we see that it does not play three notes in a sequence. Instead, it plays a single, sustained chord consisting of three notes played simultaneously. This technique is called a \"triple stop\".\n\n4.  **Identify the Notes in the Chord:** The three notes written on the treble clef staff for the first violin's final chord are, from top to bottom:\n    *   **Top note:** D (written on the fourth line of the staff).\n    *   **Middle note:** B-flat (written on the third line of the staff). The key signature has two flats (B-flat and E-flat), so this B is played as B-flat.\n    *   **Bottom note:** G (written on the second line of the staff).\n\n5.  **Determine the Lowest Note:** The three notes are G, B-flat, and D. By comparing their positions on the staff and their musical pitches, it is clear that G is the lowest of the three.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Chord vs. Melody:** A crucial point is understanding that the \"three notes\" are played simultaneously as a chord (a triple stop), not one after another in a melodic line.\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature of the final movement (B-flat major) is important for correctly identifying the B as B-flat.\n*   **Clef:** The first violin part is written in the treble clef. The notes must be read according to this clef.\n*   **Orchestral Context:** While the entire orchestra ends on a powerful B-flat major chord, the first violin part plays only a portion of that chord (G, B-flat, and D), which forms an inversion of the chord. The question is specifically about the first violin's part, not the entire orchestra's final sound.\n\nBy following these steps, we have identified the three notes as G, B-flat, and D, and have determined that G is the lowest-pitched note among them.\n\n<<<G>>>"
