    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Individuals in the Question:** The question centers on two prominent figures in Nigerian history:\n    *   **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan:** The former President of Nigeria, who served from 2010 to 2015.\n    *   **Nnamdi Azikiwe:** A leading figure in Nigeria's independence movement and the nation's first President, serving from 1963 to 1966. He is often referred to as \"Zik.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Name:** The question asks when \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly identified himself as Azikiwe. This implies that \"Azikiwe\" is part of his name. We must first verify the full legal and publicly known name of the former president.\n    *   **Fact Check:** Goodluck Jonathan's universally recognized and official full name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. His middle name is \"Ebele,\" not \"Azikiwe.\"\n\n3.  **Address the Premise of the Question:** The question operates on the premise that Goodluck Jonathan at some point adopted or revealed \"Azikiwe\" as part of his identity. We must search for any evidence of this event.\n    *   **Research:** A thorough review of biographical data, official records, and news archives (such as the BBC, Reuters, Associated Press, and major Nigerian news outlets) shows no instance of Goodluck Jonathan adding \"Azikiwe\" to his name, using it as a pseudonym, or publicly identifying himself with that name as if it were his own.\n    *   **Distinction:** The two men are distinct historical figures from different ethnic groups (Jonathan is Ijaw, Azikiwe was Igbo) and different political eras. While Jonathan, as a Nigerian president, might have referenced Nnamdi Azikiwe in speeches as a respected elder statesman and founding father, this is fundamentally different from adopting his name.\n\n4.  **Identify Potential Sources of Confusion:** The question likely stems from a misunderstanding or a conflation of these two famous Nigerian presidents. It is common for names of prominent public figures to be confused or incorrectly combined in online discussions or informal settings.\n\n5.  **Conclusion of Analysis:**\n    *   Goodluck Jonathan's full name does not include \"Azikiwe.\"\n    *   There is no credible record of him ever publicly identifying as \"Azikiwe\" or adding it to his name.\n    *   The event described in the question did not happen.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on all available public and official records, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as Azikiwe or used \"Azikiwe\" as part of his name. His official and recognized full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The premise of the question is incorrect, as the event it describes never occurred.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. This event has never occurred.>>>"
