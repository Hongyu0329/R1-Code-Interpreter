    "To determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to find the number of permutations of length 333 that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly 3 inversions.\n\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\) with \\(n=333\\). The number of inversions is the number of pairs \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi_i > \\pi_j\\). A small number of inversions (k=3) means the permutation is \"close\" to the identity permutation \\((1, 2, ..., n)\\). The elements that are not at their natural positions (\\(\\pi_i \\neq i\\)) are few and/or not displaced by much.\n\nLet's classify the permutations with 3 inversions. A permutation with 3 inversions can be constructed from the identity by a sequence of operations that increases the inversion count by a total of 3. We can analyze the structure of these permutations. For a large \\(n\\) like 333, a 1324 pattern is likely to exist unless the permutation's non-trivial parts are confined to one end. A 1324 pattern is a subsequence of 4 elements \\(\\pi_{i_1}, \\pi_{i_2}, \\pi_{i_3}, \\pi_{i_4}\\) with \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) that satisfy the value relationship \\(\\pi_{i_1} < \\pi_{i_3} < \\pi_{i_2} < \\pi_{i_4}\\).\n\nWe look for types of permutations with 3 inversions and check if they avoid 1324. A general observation is that if the elements moved from their identity positions are far apart, it's easier to form a 1324 pattern. 1324-avoiding permutations with few inversions tend to have their rearranged elements clustered at the beginning or at the end of the permutation.\n\nThe permutations with 3 inversions are classified by the partitions of 3, which are {3}, {2,1}, and {1,1,1}. These partitions correspond to the shape of the Lehmer code of the permutation.\n\n**Type 1: Partition {3}**\nThis corresponds to one element creating 3 inversions.\nThis is achieved by moving an element \\(m\\) three positions to the left, over three smaller elements.\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be a permutation of the form \\((1, \\dots, j-1, j+3, j, j+1, j+2, j+4, \\dots, n)\\). There are \\(n-3\\) such permutations, for \\(j = 1, \\dots, n-3\\).\nIt has been shown that such a permutation contains a 1324 pattern if \\(1 < j < n-3\\). For \\(n=333\\), this holds for \\(j \\in [2, 329]\\).\nThe boundary cases are \\(j=1\\) and \\(j=n-3=330\\).\n*   For \\(j=1\\): \\(\\pi = (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots, 333)\\). To form a 1324 pattern \\(\\pi_{i_1} < \\pi_{i_3} < \\pi_{i_2} < \\pi_{i_4}\\), the inversion \\((\\pi_{i_2}, \\pi_{i_3})\\) must be one of \\((4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\\). In each case, \\(\\pi_{i_1}\\) must be smaller than 1, which is impossible as elements are positive integers. Thus, this permutation is 1324-avoiding.\n*   For \\(j=n-3=330\\): \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, 329, 333, 330, 331, 332)\\). The inversion is created by 333. For a 1324 pattern, we would need an element \\(\\pi_{i_4}\\) with \\(i_4 > i_2\\) and \\(\\pi_{i_4} > \\pi_{i_2}=333\\). No such element exists in a permutation of \\(\\{1, ..., 333\\}\\). Thus, this permutation is 1324-avoiding.\nThis gives us 2 avoiding permutations.\n\n**Type 2: Partition {2,1} and structure of a 3-cycle**\nThis corresponds to permutations like \\((3,2,1,4, \\dots)\\) which is generated by applying a 3-cycle to consecutive elements.\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be of the form \\((1, \\dots, i-1, i+2, i+1, i, i+3, \\dots, n)\\). It has 3 inversions: \\((i+2, i+1), (i+2, i), (i+1, i)\\). There are \\(n-2\\) such permutations for \\(i=1, \\dots, n-2\\).\nAgain, such a permutation contains a 1324 pattern except for the boundary cases. For \\(n=333\\), this holds for \\(i \\in [2, 330]\\).\n*   For \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = (3, 2, 1, 4, \\dots, 333)\\). Similar to the case above, any 1324 pattern would require \\(\\pi_{i_1} < 1\\), which is impossible. So it is 1324-avoiding.\n*   For \\(i=n-2=331\\): \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, 330, 333, 332, 331)\\). Any 1324 pattern would require \\(\\pi_{i_4} > 333\\), which is impossible. So it is 1324-avoiding.\nThis gives us 2 more distinct avoiding permutations.\n\n**Type 3: Partition {1,1,1} and structure of moving one element right**\nThis can be seen as moving an element rightwards past three larger elements.\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be of the form \\((1, \\dots, k-1, k+1, k+2, k+3, k, k+4, \\dots, n)\\). It has 3 inversions: \\((k+1,k), (k+2,k), (k+3,k)\\). There are \\(n-3\\) such permutations for \\(k=1, \\dots, n-3\\).\nAgain, such a permutation has a 1324 pattern except for boundary cases. For \\(n=333\\), this holds for \\(k \\in [2, 329]\\).\n*   For \\(k=1\\): \\(\\pi = (2, 3, 4, 1, 5, \\dots, 333)\\). To form a 1324 pattern, we need an inversion \\((\\pi_{i_2}, \\pi_{i_3})\\), so \\(\\pi_{i_3}\\) must be 1. We'd need \\(\\pi_{i_1} < 1\\), impossible. It is 1324-avoiding.\n*   For \\(k=n-3=330\\): \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, 329, 331, 332, 333, 330)\\). To form a 1324 pattern, we need \\(\\pi_{i_4} > \\pi_{i_2}\\). The elements involved in inversions are \\(\\{331,330\\}, \\{332,330\\}, \\{333,330\\}\\). If we take \\((\\pi_{i_2}, \\pi_{i_3})=(331,330)\\), we'd need \\(\\pi_{i_4} > 331\\). The elements available to the right of 330 are none. We need to be careful. The positions are \\(\\dots, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333\\). The values are \\(\\dots, 329, 331, 332, 333, 330\\). Let \\((i_2,i_3) = (330, 333)\\). Values are \\((\\pi_{330}, \\pi_{333})=(331,330)\\). We need \\(\\pi_{i_1} < 330 < 331 < \\pi_{i_4}\\) with \\(i_1<330, i_4>333\\). Impossible. It is 1324-avoiding.\nThis gives us 2 more distinct avoiding permutations.\n\nOther permutations with 3 inversions, such as \\((2,1,5,3,4,6,...)\\), involve non-local displacements. For large \\(n\\), these will almost certainly contain a 1324 pattern. For instance, in \\((2,1,5,3,4,6,...)\\), the subsequence at positions \\((1,3,4,6)\\) is \\((2,5,3,6)\\), whose values \\((2,3,5,6)\\) form a 1324 pattern (\\(2<3<5<6\\)).\n\nThe 6 permutations identified are:\n1.  \\((4, 1, 2, 3, 5, \\dots, 333)\\)\n2.  \\((1, \\dots, 329, 333, 330, 331, 332)\\)\n3.  \\((3, 2, 1, 4, \\dots, 333)\\)\n4.  \\((1, \\dots, 330, 333, 332, 331)\\)\n5.  \\((2, 3, 4, 1, 5, \\dots, 333)\\)\n6.  \\((1, \\dots, 329, 331, 332, 333, 330)\\)\n\nThese six permutations are distinct.\nThus, for \\(n=333\\), there are 6 such permutations."
