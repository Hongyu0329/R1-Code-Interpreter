    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"Reverse Turn\"**: This is a standard figure in ballroom dancing where the couple turns to their left. It is present in all five of the dances listed.\n    *   **\"Overturn\"**: This means to turn more than the standard or prescribed amount for the figure. For example, if a figure is supposed to turn 3/4, overturning would be turning a full rotation or more.\n    *   **\"Impossible ... without disregarding the technique\"**: This is the most critical part of the question. It asks in which dance the fundamental principles and characteristic movements make it impossible to add extra rotation to a reverse turn without violating the core nature of that dance.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Technique of Each Dance:**\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz, B. English Waltz, D. Slow Foxtrot, E. Quickstep**: These four dances belong to the \"swing\" dance category. A fundamental aspect of their technique is the use of body swing, rise and fall (except for some Foxtrot figures), and momentum generated from the body's movement through space. This pendulum-like swing creates a natural rotational force. While each figure has a standard amount of turn, the underlying technique of swing *allows* for the physical possibility of turning more. It might be considered poor form, lead to loss of balance, or be stylistically incorrect, but it is not a violation of the fundamental mechanic of swing itself. You can use the swing to \"over-rotate.\"\n    *   **C. European Tango**: The Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. Its core technique includes:\n        *   **No Rise and Fall**: The dancers maintain a constant level height.\n        *   **No Body Swing**: Movement is generated from the feet and legs, with a strong, staccato, progressive walk. There is no pendulum-like swing of the body.\n        *   **Grounded Action**: The feet are kept close to the floor. Steps are placed, not swung into position.\n        *   **Staccato Quality**: The movement is sharp and clipped, not flowing and continuous like in the swing dances.\n\n3.  **Apply the \"Overturning\" Concept to Tango:**\n    *   In a Tango Reverse Turn, the rotation is achieved through precise foot placements and controlled torso rotation over the standing foot. The turn is \"carved\" into the floor, not swung.\n    *   To \"overturn\" this turn (i.e., add significantly more rotation), a dancer would have to introduce a rotational mechanic that Tango technique expressly forbids. This would most likely be a pivot on the heel or ball of the foot, or an attempt to generate swing.\n    *   Introducing swing or a free-spinning pivot fundamentally changes the character of the movement. It is no longer a Tango step; it is a direct contradiction and disregard for the core technique of the dance. In the other dances, overturning is poor application of the technique; in Tango, it requires abandoning the technique and using a different one.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), one can physically overturn a reverse turn by exaggerating the natural swing, even if it's incorrect. In the European Tango, which lacks swing, any attempt to overturn a reverse turn requires introducing a mechanism (like a pivot or swing) that is alien to and contradictory to the fundamental technique of the dance. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn in Tango *without* disregarding the technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
