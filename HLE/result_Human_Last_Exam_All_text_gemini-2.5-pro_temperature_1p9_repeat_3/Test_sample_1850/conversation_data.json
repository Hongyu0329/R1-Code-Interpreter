    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify and count the number of \"historical saints\" who are \"mentioned by name\" within John Milton's epic poem, *Paradise Lost*. To do this accurately, we must carefully define our terms.\n\n**2. Careful Points & Definitions**\n*   **\"Paradise Lost\":** We must confine our search exclusively to the text of this specific poem, not Milton's other works like *Paradise Regained* or his prose.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\":** This means the individual's proper name (e.g., \"Moses,\" \"David\") must appear in the text. Allusions, titles, or descriptions (e.g., \"the Virgin,\" \"the Tuscan Artist,\" \"that Shepherd\") do not count unless the name is also present.\n*   **\"Historical Saints\":** This is the most crucial term to define.\n    *   **Historical:** Refers to figures who are understood to have lived in human history. This excludes purely mythological figures (like the classical muses Milton invokes) and angels who existed before humanity (like Michael or Gabriel).\n    *   **Saints:** This term is interpreted broadly. It is not limited to post-Christ figures canonized by the Roman Catholic Church, a tradition Milton often criticized. Instead, it refers to any major revered holy figure from the biblical-historical narrative, including Old Testament patriarchs and prophets who are considered saints in various Christian traditions (including Eastern Orthodox and some Protestant views). This interpretation is the most appropriate given Milton's deep engagement with the entire Bible as a source of historical and moral truth. Divine figures like God the Father and the Son (Jesus) are generally excluded from this category, as a \"saint\" is typically a holy human follower of God, not God himself.\n\n**3. Searching the Text for Candidates**\nThe most likely places to find such names are in the sections where Milton discusses future history, specifically the vision granted to Adam by the Archangel Michael in Books XI and XII, and in the introductory invocations.\n\n**Book I:**\n*   In the Proem, Milton refers to Moses as \"That Shepherd\" (I.8), but doesn't name him here.\n*   Later, describing Christ's coming, he mentions \"the Baptist Saint\" (I.23). **John the Baptist** is a historical figure and a universally recognized saint.\n    *   **Count: 1 (John the Baptist)**\n\n**Book XI:** In the vision shown to Adam:\n*   Adam sees \"one / Of middle age...hee also walk'd with God...and was seen no more...took him\" (XI.664-671). Michael names him: \"...th' onely just man alive...the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst, the faithful **ENOCH**\" (XI.700-706). Enoch is a revered patriarch.\n    *   **Count: 2 (Enoch)**\n*   Adam then sees the Great Flood and the Ark. The man who built it is explicitly named by Michael: \"...him the onely Son of light / In a dark Age...the second from thee, whom thou saw'st walk on the ground...was **NOAH**\" (XI.808-818). Noah is a revered patriarch.\n    *   **Count: 3 (Noah)**\n\n**Book XII:** The vision continues with Michael narrating history:\n*   Michael describes the calling of a new patriarch from Ur: \"...one faithful man...This Man...I will call **ABRAM**\" (XII.113-121). Abraham is a foundational patriarch and holy figure.\n    *   **Count: 4 (Abraham)**\n*   Michael tells of the deliverance from Egypt by a great Lawgiver, who is named: \"...his name / The great Deliverer, him **MOSES**...This is that **MOSES**...\" (XII.172-230). Moses is a preeminent prophet and holy figure.\n    *   **Count: 5 (Moses)**\n*   After Moses, his successor is named: \"**JOSHUA** whom the Gentiles JESUS call, / His Name and Office bearing\" (XII.310-311). Joshua is a revered historical leader.\n    *   **Count: 6 (Joshua)**\n*   Michael describes the lineage of kings in Israel: \"...and his Regal Seat / **DAVID**, and his succeeding Line...\" (XII.321-322). David is a revered king, prophet, and saint.\n    *   **Count: 7 (David)**\n\n**4. Reviewing and Excluding Other Possibilities**\n*   **Mary, mother of Jesus:** She is referred to as \"a Virgin\" (XII.368) and the \"Maid\" (X.183), but is never mentioned by the name **Mary**.\n*   **Jesus Christ (The Son):** He is the central figure of the divine plan but is considered God, not a human \"saint\" in the typical sense of the word.\n*   **Apostles (Peter, Paul, etc.):** They are alluded to as those who will spread the gospel (\"sent from him,\" XII.441), but none are mentioned by their individual names.\n*   **Solomon:** He is mentioned as David's \"next Son\" who will build the temple (XII.331), but is not named.\n*   **Catholic Saints (Francis, Dominic, etc.):** They are referenced mockingly through their orders (\"Fryars, / White, Black and Gray\", III.474-475) but are not mentioned by name.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on a systematic reading of *Paradise Lost* and applying a consistent definition of \"historical saint mentioned by name,\" we can identify exactly seven such figures. They are all biblical, venerated for their holiness, and explicitly named in the text.\n\nThe list is:\n1.  John the Baptist\n2.  Enoch\n3.  Noah\n4.  Abraham\n5.  Moses\n6.  Joshua\n7.  David\n\nThe total number is seven.\n\n<<<7>>>"
