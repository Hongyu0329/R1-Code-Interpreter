The bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space, $G_0(k, \omega)$, has the functional form of a simple pole, $1/(\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta_{\text{pole}})$. The functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ is that $\epsilon_k$ directly sets the real part of the pole's location in the complex frequency plane. Specifically, the dependence is contained within the denominator term $(\omega - \epsilon_k)$.
