    "This analysis aims to determine the functional dependence of the bare Green's function, $G_0$, on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, within the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Defining the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$) in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe Feynman path integral is a method to calculate quantum mechanical amplitudes, including correlation functions like the Green's function. We consider a non-interacting many-body system described by a Hamiltonian $H_0$. Since the system is non-interacting, $H_0$ can be diagonalized in a basis of single-particle states, indexed by a quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum), with corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe time-ordered two-point Green's function is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators. In the path integral formalism, this is expressed as a functional integral over fields (Grassmann fields $\\psi_k, \\bar{\\psi}_k$ for fermions):\n\n$G_0(k, t-t') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, \\psi_k(t) \\bar{\\psi}_k(t') \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}$\n\nHere, $S_0$ is the action for the non-interacting system.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The \"bare\" Green's function, denoted by the subscript '0', refers specifically to a non-interacting system governed by the action $S_0$. It is the fundamental building block for studying interacting systems using perturbation theory (Feynman diagrams).\n\n**Step 2: The Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe action $S_0$ is the time integral of the Lagrangian, $L_0$. In the basis where $H_0$ is diagonal ($H_0 = \\sum_k \\epsilon_k c_k^\\dagger c_k$), the action for the corresponding fields is:\n\n$S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int dt \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(t) (i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(t)$\n\nFor simplicity, we set $\\hbar=1$.\n\n$S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int dt \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(t) (i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(t)$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ appear directly in the system's action. This is the origin of the functional dependence we are seeking. The term $(i\\partial_t - \\epsilon_k)$ is a differential operator that governs the \"equation of motion\" for the field $\\psi_k$.\n\n**Step 3: Transforming to Frequency-Momentum Space**\n\nThe calculation is significantly simplified by performing a Fourier transform from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$).\n\n*   $\\psi_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{-i\\omega t} \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n*   $\\bar{\\psi}_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{i\\omega t} \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\omega)$\n\nUnder this transformation, the time derivative operator becomes a simple multiplication: $i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\omega$.\nThe action $S_0$ becomes:\n\n$S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Green's Function**\n\nThe path integral for $S_0$ is a Gaussian integral over the Grassmann fields $\\psi_k(\\omega)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}_k(\\omega)$. A fundamental property of such integrals is that the two-point correlator (which is the Green's function) is the inverse of the operator appearing in the quadratic term of the action.\n\nThe operator in frequency-momentum ($k, \\omega$) space is simply the algebraic term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. Therefore, the Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ must be its inverse:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) = 1$\n$\\implies G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Role of Causality and the \"iδ\" Prescription**\n\nThe expression above has a singularity (a pole) on the real frequency axis at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. This is physically problematic. The time-ordering ($\\mathcal{T}$) in the original definition of the Green's function is crucial and ensures causality. In the frequency domain, this is mathematically enforced by adding an infinitesimal imaginary part, $i\\delta$ (with $\\delta \\to 0^+$), to the denominator. This shifts the pole slightly off the real axis.\n\nThe sign of this imaginary term depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied or unoccupied in the ground state, which is determined by its energy $\\epsilon_k$ relative to the chemical potential $\\mu$.\n*   **For unoccupied states (particles, $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$):** The pole is shifted to the lower-half of the complex $\\omega$-plane: $\\omega = \\epsilon_k - i\\delta$. This corresponds to a propagator decaying forward in time.\n*   **For occupied states (holes, $\\epsilon_k < \\mu$):** The pole is shifted to the upper-half of the complex $\\omega$-plane: $\\omega = \\epsilon_k + i\\delta$. This corresponds to a propagator decaying backward in time.\n\nThese two conditions can be combined into a single compact expression:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nwhere $\\text{sgn}(x)$ is the sign function. At zero temperature, this is equivalent to the Lehmann representation of the non-interacting Green's function:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{\\theta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta} + \\frac{\\theta(\\mu - \\epsilon_k)}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\delta}$\n\nwhere $\\theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function.\n\n### Final Conclusion on Functional Dependence\n\nFrom the final expression for $G_0(k, \\omega)$, the functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is clear and direct:\n\n1.  **Pole Position:** The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is a rational function of frequency $\\omega$. Its most prominent feature is a simple pole. The real part of this pole's position is precisely the single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  **Denominator Structure:** The entire dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is encapsulated in the denominator of the form `(frequency - energy)`.\n3.  **Pole Character (Particle vs. Hole):** The character of the pole (i.e., its infinitesimal imaginary shift, determining whether it describes a particle or hole propagation) is also determined by $\\epsilon_k$ through its relationship to the chemical potential $\\mu$.\n\nIn summary, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function on $\\epsilon_k$ is that $\\epsilon_k$ sets the location of the pole of $G_0(k, \\omega)$ on the real frequency axis.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, has the functional form of a simple pole, $1/(\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta_{\\text{pole}})$. The functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is that $\\epsilon_k$ directly sets the real part of the pole's location in the complex frequency plane. Specifically, the dependence is contained within the denominator term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.>>>"
