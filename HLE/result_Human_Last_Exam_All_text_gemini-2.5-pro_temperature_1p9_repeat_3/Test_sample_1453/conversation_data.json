    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The goal is to determine the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, etc.) of a given protein sequence presumed to form a coiled-coil.\n2.  **Identify the Sequence:** `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n3.  **Identify the Method:** The analysis must be based on the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing and packing efficiency. This directs us to analyze the amino acid sequence in the context of a coiled-coil's repeating structure, primarily the heptad repeat.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Pattern**\n\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, called a heptad repeat, denoted by the positions `(abcdefg)n`. The key to the structure lies in the identity of the amino acids at specific positions:\n\n*   **Positions `a` and `d`:** These are the core positions. Their side chains are buried in the hydrophobic interface between the helices. They are the \"knobs\" that pack into the \"holes\" of the partner helix/helices. These positions are almost always occupied by hydrophobic residues (like Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), Alanine (A), Methionine (M), Phenylalanine (F), Tryptophan (W)).\n*   **Positions `e` and `g`:** These are flanking positions, often called the \"rim\" or \"ionic\" positions. They are located at the edges of the hydrophobic core and are often occupied by charged or polar residues (like Lysine (K), Arginine (R), Glutamate (E), Aspartate (D), Glutamine (Q), Asparagine (N)). They can form stabilizing salt bridges or hydrogen bonds between adjacent helices.\n*   **Positions `b`, `c`, and `f`:** These positions are solvent-exposed and generally occupied by polar or charged residues.\n\n**Step 2: Assign the Heptad Repeat Register to the Sequence**\n\nWe must find the correct alignment (or frame) of the `(abcdefg)` pattern onto the given sequence. The best alignment will place the bulky hydrophobic residues consistently at the `a` and `d` positions. Let's test the possible frames systematically. The sequence has a recurring pattern of hydrophobic residues (`I`, `A`, `L`, `W`). The most obvious `HxxxHxx` pattern (`H`=hydrophobic) is the best guide.\n\nLet's test the frame where the first Leucine (`L_7`) is at an `a` position.\n\n*   **Sequence:**   `G E I A Q S` **L K E I A Q S** **L K E I A K S** **L K E I A W S** **L K G**... (The repeats are slightly offset)\n*   Let's try a different registration. The pattern seems to be `...HxxH...`, specifically `IxxxL`. This is an `a-d` spacing. Let's try assigning `I_3` to `f` and `L_7` to `c`.\n*   Let's be systematic. We'll write the sequence and slide the `abcdefg` pattern along it, looking for the best fit.\n    *   S: G E **I** A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G\n*   Let's test the alignment that places the most hydrophobic residues (I, L, W) in the core `a` and `d` positions.\n\n    *   **Optimal Alignment:**\n        `e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e  f`\n        `G  E  I  A  Q  S  L  K  E  I  A  K  S  L  K  E  I  A  W  S  L  K  E  I  A  Q  S  L  K  G`\n\nLet's re-try this. A better frame exists:\nLet's assign the **first Isoleucine (`I_3`) to position `f`**.\n\n*   **Register:** `f  g  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c  d`\n*   **Sequence:** `I  A  Q  S  L  K  E  I  A  K  S  L  K  E  I  A  W  S  L  K  E  I  A  Q  S  L` (analyzing the core 28 residues)\n\nThis assignment gives us:\n*   **`a` positions:** Q, K, A, Q  -> This is not good. `a` positions are polar/charged.\n\nLet's try the frame that worked in our scratchpad analysis (`L` at `a`, `I/W` at `d`). This corresponds to placing `I_3` at position `e`.\n\n*   **Register:** `e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c  d`\n*   **Sequence:** `I  A  Q  S  L  K  E  I  A  K  S  L  K  E  I  A  W  S  L  K  E  I  A  Q  S  L`\n\nThis yields the following residues at the critical positions:\n\n*   **`a` positions:** S, S, S, S (all Serine)\n*   **`d` positions:** E, E, E, E (all Glutamate)\nThis alignment is also very poor, placing polar/charged residues in both core positions.\n\nLet's retry the successful frame from thinking: **L_7 at position a**.\n*   **Register:**   `... e  f  g` `a  b  c  d  e  f  g` `a  b  c  d  e  f  g` `a  b  c  d  e  f  g` `a  b  c  d ...`\n*   **Sequence:**   `... A  Q  S` `L  K  E  I  A  K  S` `L  K  E  I  A  K  S`... No, this parsing is wrong.\n\nLet's use the pattern directly: The hydrophobic residues are at positions 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25, 28.\nThe clear repeating distance is `3-7` (4 residues), `7-10` (3 residues), `10-14` (4 residues), `14-17` (3 residues). This `4,3,4,3` spacing is the hallmark of a heptad repeat (`d-a` and `a-d` spacings).\nThis definitively sets the core `a` and `d` positions.\n\nLet's take `I_3` as `a`. This gives `d=S_6`, `a=L_7`, `d=K_9`. No, that doesn't work.\n\nLet's take **`L_7` as position `d`**.\n*   `a` would be 3-4 residues before it, so `A_4` or `I_3`. Let's assume `a = A_4`.\n*   **Sequence:**  `G E I` **A** `Q S` **L** `K E` **I** `A K S` **L** `K E` **I** `A W S` **L** `K E` **I** `A Q S` **L** `K G`\n*   Let's check this assignment: `a, b, c, d, e, f, g`\n*   Repeat 1: `A, Q, S, L, K, E, I`\n*   Repeat 2: `A, K, S, L, K, E, I`\n*   Repeat 3: `A, W, S, L, K, E, I`\n*   Repeat 4: `A, Q, S, L, K, G`\n*   Let's tabulate:\n    *   **`a` positions:** **A, A, A, A** (Alanine: hydrophobic) -> **Good.**\n    *   **`d` positions:** **L, L, L, L** (Leucine: hydrophobic) -> **Excellent.**\n    *   **`e` positions:** K, K, K, K (Lysine: charged) -> **Good.**\n    *   **`g` positions:** I, I, I, (last repeat is short) -> (Isoleucine: hydrophobic). This is a slight imperfection. A hydrophobic `g` position is less ideal but can be tolerated.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Core (`a`, `d`) Residues for Oligomer State**\n\nWe have a consistent and biochemically sound heptad assignment:\n*   **`a` positions = Alanine**\n*   **`d` positions = Leucine**\n\nNow we apply knobs-into-holes principles:\n1.  **Dimer (2-mer):** Characterized by strong hydrophobic interactions at both the `a` and `d` positions. The packing is efficient, with `a` residues from one helix packing against `a` from the other (`a-a'`), and `d` against `d'` (`d-d'`). The pattern `a=A`, `d=L` fits perfectly with a dimeric structure. This is a classic \"leucine zipper\"-like motif.\n2.  **Trimer (3-mer):** Often have hydrophobic residues at `a` but can tolerate polar residues (like N or Q) at `d`. Having bulky hydrophobic residues at both `a` and `d` can create an overly greasy and non-specific core. While possible, the `A/L` pattern is less specific for a trimer than patterns involving polar residues.\n3.  **Tetramer (4-mer):** The packing geometry changes. Again, hydrophobic residues are needed at `a` and `d`, but specificity is often introduced by polar interactions or specific packing of Î²-branched residues. The `A/L` combination does not strongly point towards a tetramer over a dimer.\n4.  **Packing Efficiency:** The small Alanine at `a` and the larger Leucine at `d` provides excellent \"knobs-into-holes\" complementarity for a parallel dimeric coiled-coil. The knob from a Leucine `d` position can pack into the hole created by four surrounding residues on the partner helix, one of which is the small Alanine `a`. This efficient packing strongly stabilizes a dimer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe heptad repeat analysis reveals a clear pattern with Alanine at all `a` positions and Leucine at all `d` positions. This is a canonical hydrophobic core pattern (`HxxxHxx`). This type of sequence is strongly characteristic of a **dimeric coiled-coil**. The packing of these residues is most efficient in a two-stranded structure.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state would be 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
