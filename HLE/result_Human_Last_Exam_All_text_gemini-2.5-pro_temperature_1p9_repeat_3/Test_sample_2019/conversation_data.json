    "An analysis of the question about placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Board and Constraints**\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid that wraps around horizontally and vertically (a torus). Coordinates can be represented as `(x, y)` where `x, y` are integers modulo 5 (e.g., from 0 to 4).\n*   **Queen's Attack:** A queen at `(x, y)` attacks any square `(i, j)` that lies on the same:\n    *   **Row:** `i = x`\n    *   **Column:** `j = y`\n    *   **Main Diagonal:** `j - i ≡ y - x (mod 5)`\n    *   **Anti-Diagonal:** `j + i ≡ y + x (mod 5)`\n*   **The Problem:** We need to find the number of ways to place 4 queens such that no two queens attack each other. This means for any two queens at positions `(x_1, y_1)` and `(x_2, y_2)`, all four values (`x`, `y`, `y-x`, `y+x`) must be different.\n    *   `x_1 ≠ x_2`\n    *   `y_1 ≠ y_2`\n    *   `y_1 - x_1 ≢ y_2 - x_2 (mod 5)`\n    *   `y_1 + x_1 ≢ y_2 + x_2 (mod 5)`\n\n**2. The \"Completion\" Method: Connecting 4-Queens to 5-Queens**\n\nA key insight for this problem, particularly for an `n x n` board where `n` is a prime number like 5, is to analyze the relationship between a configuration with `n-1` queens and a full `n`-queen configuration. Here, we relate the 4-queen problem to the 5-queen problem.\n\n**Step 2a: Can any 4-queen configuration be extended?**\n\nLet's assume we have a valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens.\n*   This placement uses 4 distinct rows, leaving exactly **one row** empty.\n*   It uses 4 distinct columns, leaving exactly **one column** empty.\n*   It uses 4 distinct main diagonals, leaving exactly **one main diagonal** empty.\n*   It uses 4 distinct anti-diagonals, leaving exactly **one anti-diagonal** empty.\n\nTo add a 5th queen without it being attacked, it must be placed in the single empty row and the single empty column. This uniquely identifies a square, let's call it `(x_5, y_5)`. The question is whether placing a queen on this specific square respects the diagonal constraints. Does `(x_5, y_5)` lie on the empty main diagonal and the empty anti-diagonal?\n\nLet's verify this. Let the set of all row/column/diagonal indices be `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. The sum of these indices is `10`. Since `10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`, the sum of a full set of indices is `0 (mod 5)`.\n\n*   If the 4 used rows are `{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4}`, the empty row is `x_5 = 10 - (x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4)`. Modulo 5, `x_5 ≡ -(x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4)`. The same logic applies to the column `y_5`, main diagonal index `d_5`, and anti-diagonal index `s_5`.\n*   The main diagonal index of the new queen at `(x_5, y_5)` is `y_5 - x_5`. Let's calculate this modulo 5:\n    `y_5 - x_5 ≡ (-Σy_i) - (-Σx_i) = Σx_i - Σy_i = -Σ(y_i - x_i) = -Σd_i`.\n    The empty main diagonal index is `d_5 ≡ -Σd_i`.\n    Thus, `y_5 - x_5 ≡ d_5 (mod 5)`. The new queen lies on the empty main diagonal.\n*   Similarly, for the anti-diagonal:\n    `y_5 + x_5 ≡ (-Σy_i) + (-Σx_i) = -Σ(y_i + x_i) = -Σs_i`.\n    The empty anti-diagonal index is `s_5 ≡ -Σs_i`.\n    Thus, `y_5 + x_5 ≡ s_5 (mod 5)`. The new queen lies on the empty anti-diagonal.\n\nThis proves that **any** valid configuration of 4 non-attacking queens can be extended to a valid configuration of 5 non-attacking queens. Furthermore, the placement of the 5th queen is unique.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of 5-queen solutions**\n\nThe next step is to find the number of ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on the 5x5 toroidal board. This is a known result from combinatorial mathematics. For a prime `n`, the solutions to the toroidal `n`-queens problem are all \"linear\". This means the positions `(i, p(i))` are given by a linear function `p(i) = ai + b (mod n)`.\n\nFor such a linear arrangement to be a valid solution:\n1.  `a` must be coprime to `n` (to ensure `p(i)` is a permutation). For `n=5`, `a ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n2.  `a-1` must be coprime to `n` (for unique main diagonals). This means `a-1 ≠ 0 (mod 5)`, so `a ≠ 1`.\n3.  `a+1` must be coprime to `n` (for unique anti-diagonals). This means `a+1 ≠ 0 (mod 5)`, so `a ≠ 4`.\n\nCombining these, `a` must be in the set `{2, 3}`. There are 2 choices for `a`.\nThe value `b` (the \"intercept\") can be any value from `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, giving 5 choices.\nSo, the total number of 5-queen solutions is `2 × 5 = 10`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer**\n\nWe have established a clear relationship:\n*   Every 4-queen configuration can be uniquely completed to one of the 10 possible 5-queen solutions.\n*   Conversely, starting from any of the 10 solutions (each having 5 queens), we can generate a 4-queen configuration by removing one queen. Since there are 5 queens to choose from, each 5-queen solution can generate 5 distinct 4-queen configurations.\n*   These generated configurations are all unique. If two different 5-queen solutions `S1` and `S2` generated the same 4-queen set `C4`, it would imply that `C4` could be completed to either `S1` or `S2`, which contradicts the uniqueness of the completion we proved in Step 2.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4-queen configurations is the number of 5-queen solutions multiplied by the number of ways to remove one queen from each solution.\n\nNumber of ways = (Number of 5-queen solutions) × (Queens in each solution)\nNumber of ways = 10 × 5 = 50.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Toroidal Nature:** The wrap-around logic is critical. Using modular arithmetic for diagonals is the correct way to handle this.\n*   **Completability:** The proof that any `(n-1)`-queen configuration can be extended to an `n`-queen configuration is the central pillar of this solution. This property relies on `n=5` being an odd number (which makes the sum of indices `Σi` congruent to `0 mod n`).\n*   **Counting Full Solutions:** The count of 10 for the 5-queens problem is a standard result for prime `n>3`. For `n=5`, the formula is `(n-3) * n = 2 * 5 = 10`.\n*   **Uniqueness:** The reasoning that no two full solutions can generate the same partial solution by removing a queen is essential to avoid overcounting.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n1.  There are exactly 10 ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n2.  Any arrangement of 4 non-attacking queens can be uniquely extended to one of these 10 arrangements.\n3.  Therefore, any valid 4-queen arrangement must be a subset of one of the 10 full solutions.\n4.  Each full solution (with 5 queens) has `C(5, 4) = 5` subsets of 4 queens.\n5.  The total number of such arrangements is `10 solutions * 5 subsets/solution = 50`.\n\n<<<50>>>"
