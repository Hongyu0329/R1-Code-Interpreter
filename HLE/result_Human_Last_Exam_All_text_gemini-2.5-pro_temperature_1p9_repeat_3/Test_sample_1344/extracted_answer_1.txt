The optimal combination is a single-site **Zirconium (Zr)** catalyst, which is prepared by grafting a simple organometallic precursor such as **tetrabenzylzirconium (Zr(CH₂Ph)₄)** onto a **Sulfonated Zirconia (S-ZrO₂) support**. In this system, the strongly acidic surface of the support acts as both the anchor and the activator, generating the highly electrophilic cationic sites required for both catalytic functions.
