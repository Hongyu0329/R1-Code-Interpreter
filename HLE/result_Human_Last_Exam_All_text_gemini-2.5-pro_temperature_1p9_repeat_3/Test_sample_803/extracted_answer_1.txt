The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the groups isomorphic to the semidirect product $(C_q)^m \rtimes C_2$, where the generator of $C_2$ acts on the elementary abelian group $(C_q)^m$ by inverting every element. For each pair $(q,m)$, there is a unique such group up to isomorphism.
