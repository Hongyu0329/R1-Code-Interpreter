    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a \"filled group\"**\nA finite group $G$ is called a \"filled group\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in $G$ generates $G$. A product-free set $S$ is a subset where for all $a, b \\in S$, the product $ab$ is not in $S$. A key theorem by D'Andrea, Monetta, and Tracey provides a more accessible group-theoretic characterization:\n**Theorem:** A finite group $G$ is filled if and only if its Frattini subgroup is trivial ($\\Phi(G) = \\{1\\}$) and $G$ is indecomposable (i.e., it cannot be written as a direct product of two non-trivial subgroups).\n\nThis theorem is our primary tool for identifying filled groups. We are looking for nonabelian groups of order $2q^m$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of groups of order $2q^m$**\nLet $G$ be a group with $|G| = 2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number.\n*   By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow $q$-subgroups, $n_q$, must divide 2 and satisfy $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$. Since $q$ is an odd prime, $q \\nmid (2-1)=1$, so the only possibility is $n_q=1$. This means the Sylow $q$-subgroup, let's call it $Q$, is normal in $G$. $|Q| = q^m$.\n*   The Sylow 2-subgroup, let's call it $P$, has order 2, so $P \\cong C_2$.\n*   Since $Q$ is a normal subgroup, $G$ is a semidirect product of $Q$ by $P$. That is, $G \\cong Q \\rtimes P \\cong Q \\rtimes C_2$.\n*   Since we are looking for nonabelian groups, the semidirect product must be non-trivial. This means the homomorphism $\\phi: P \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(Q)$ defining the action of $P$ on $Q$ is not the trivial homomorphism.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Frattini-free condition ($\\Phi(G)=\\{1\\}$)**\n*   The Frattini subgroup $\\Phi(G)$ is the intersection of all maximal subgroups of $G$.\n*   For a semidirect product $G = Q \\rtimes P$ where the orders of $Q$ and $P$ are coprime (here, $q^m$ and 2), a theorem by GaschÃ¼tz states that $\\Phi(G) = \\Phi(Q) \\rtimes \\Phi(P)$.\n*   For $P \\cong C_2$, its only maximal subgroup is the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$, so $\\Phi(P)=\\{1\\}$.\n*   This simplifies the condition to $\\Phi(G) = \\Phi(Q)$.\n*   Therefore, the condition $\\Phi(G)=\\{1\\}$ is equivalent to $\\Phi(Q)=\\{1\\}$.\n*   For a $p$-group (here, a $q$-group) $Q$, the condition $\\Phi(Q)=\\{1\\}$ holds if and only if $Q$ is an elementary abelian group.\n*   This means $Q$ must be isomorphic to the direct product of $m$ copies of the cyclic group of order $q$, i.e., $Q \\cong (C_q)^m$.\n\nSo, any nonabelian filled group of order $2q^m$ must be of the form $G \\cong (C_q)^m \\rtimes C_2$, where the action is non-trivial.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the indecomposability condition**\nNow we must ensure that $G \\cong (C_q)^m \\rtimes C_2$ is indecomposable.\n*   The group $Q \\cong (C_q)^m$ can be viewed as an $m$-dimensional vector space $V$ over the field with $q$ elements, $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The automorphism group $\\operatorname{Aut}(Q)$ is then isomorphic to the general linear group $GL(m, q)$.\n*   The action of $P \\cong C_2 = \\langle x \\rangle$ on $Q$ is determined by an automorphism $\\alpha = \\phi(x) \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Q)$ of order dividing 2. As the action is non-trivial, $\\alpha$ has order 2. In $GL(m,q)$, this corresponds to a matrix $A$ such that $A^2 = I$ (the identity matrix) and $A \\neq I$.\n*   A matrix $A$ satisfying $A^2=I$ is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (since $q$ is odd, the polynomial $t^2-1=(t-1)(t+1)$ has distinct roots 1 and -1).\n*   This means the vector space $V$ (our group $Q$) splits into a direct sum of eigenspaces for the eigenvalues 1 and -1: $V = V_1 \\oplus V_{-1}$.\n    *   $V_1 = \\ker(A-I)$ is the subspace of vectors fixed by the action. Let's call the corresponding subgroup $Q_1$.\n    *   $V_{-1} = \\ker(A+I)$ is the subspace of vectors inverted by the action (since $Av=-v$ corresponds to $xqx^{-1}=q^{-1}$). Let's call the corresponding subgroup $Q_{-1}$.\n*   The group $G$ can be shown to be isomorphic to the direct product $(Q_{-1} \\rtimes C_2) \\times Q_1$. The subgroup $Q_1$ is the center of $G$, and $Q_{-1} \\rtimes C_2$ acts as its complement.\n*   For $G$ to be indecomposable, one of these direct factors must be trivial.\n    *   If $Q_{-1} \\rtimes C_2$ is trivial, then $Q_{-1}=\\{1\\}$, which means the action is trivial on all of $Q$. This would make $G=Q \\times C_2$ abelian, but we are looking for nonabelian groups.\n    *   Therefore, the other factor $Q_1$ must be trivial. $Q_1=\\{1\\}$ means the eigenspace $V_1$ is the zero space.\n*   $V_1=\\{0\\}$ means that the action of $x$ fixes no element of $Q$ other than the identity. All eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ must be -1, which means $A = -I$. This specifies the action uniquely up to isomorphism.\n\n**Step 5: Final Characterization**\nThe conditions force the group structure to be unique for each pair $(q,m)$:\n1.  The group is $G \\cong (C_q)^m \\rtimes C_2$.\n2.  The action of the generator of $C_2$ on $(C_q)^m$ must be inversion: $g \\mapsto g^{-1}$ for every element $g \\in (C_q)^m$.\n\nThese groups are guaranteed to be nonabelian (since the action is non-trivial), Frattini-free (since $(C_q)^m$ is elementary abelian), and indecomposable (since the action has no non-trivial fixed points). Therefore, they are the complete set of nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$.\n\nFor $m=1$, this group is the dihedral group $D_{2q}$. For $m > 1$, it is a generalized dihedral group.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the groups isomorphic to the semidirect product $(C_q)^m \\rtimes C_2$, where the generator of $C_2$ acts on the elementary abelian group $(C_q)^m$ by inverting every element. For each pair $(q,m)$, there is a unique such group up to isomorphism.>>>"
