    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to identify the part of speech of the first word, \"Fat,\" in the given sentence: \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Sentence Structure**\nThe sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is grammatically unusual. Let's break it down to understand the function of each word in its position.\n- The sentence begins with the phrase \"Fat people\".\n- The word \"Fat\" comes directly before the word \"people\".\n- \"People\" is a noun.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Role of the First Word (\"Fat\")**\nIn English grammar, a word that is placed before a noun to describe or modify it is typically an adjective.\n- Consider similar phrases: \"Tall people,\" \"Happy children,\" \"Red cars.\" In each of these examples, the first word (\"Tall,\" \"Happy,\" \"Red\") is an adjective describing the noun that follows.\n- Applying this rule to the phrase \"Fat people,\" the word \"Fat\" describes the noun \"people.\" Therefore, its grammatical function in this context is that of an adjective.\n\n**Step 4: Consider and Eliminate Other Possibilities**\nWhile the rest of the sentence (\"eat accumulates\") is confusing and grammatically incorrect, it doesn't change the grammatical function of the word \"Fat\" in relation to \"people\". We must analyze the word in its immediate context.\n*   **Is \"Fat\" a Noun?** \"Fat\" can be a noun (e.g., \"This food contains too much fat.\"). However, in this sentence, it is followed by another noun, \"people,\" without any punctuation or connecting words. The most natural reading is that \"Fat\" modifies \"people,\" not that they are two separate nouns. For \"Fat\" to be a noun here, the sentence would need to be rephrased, for instance, as \"The fat that people eat accumulates.\" But as written, \"Fat\" functions as a descriptor.\n*   **Is \"Fat\" a Verb?** \"Fat\" can be a verb (e.g., \"to fat up livestock\"). This does not fit the sentence structure at all.\n*   **Is \"Fat\" an Adverb or Conjunction?** \"Fat\" is not used as an adverb or a conjunction.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\nBased on its position directly before the noun \"people,\" the word \"Fat\" is serving as a descriptor. A word that describes a noun is an adjective.\n\n**Step 6: Select the Correct Answer Choice**\n*   A. Verb - Incorrect.\n*   B. Noun - Incorrect in this specific context.\n*   C. Adjective - Correct. It modifies the noun \"people.\"\n*   D. Adverb - Incorrect.\n*   E. Conjunction - Incorrect.\n\nThe first word, \"Fat,\" belongs to the part of speech known as an adjective.\n\n<<<C>>>"
