    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** A finite set $X$ with a metric $d$ that satisfies the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$.\n*   **Banach Space (B):** A complete normed vector space. We'll assume the space is over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, as is standard.\n*   **Cardinality K:** The Banach space $B$ has size $|B| = K$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the distance is preserved: $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n*   **The Goal:** Find the minimum possible value for the number of such isometric embeddings. The question's structure, \"What is the smallest possible number...\", implies we are free to choose the space $X$ and the space $B$ (that fit the description) in order to make the number of embeddings as small as possible.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the number of embeddings in the general case (non-trivial Banach space)**\n\nLet's assume $B$ is a non-trivial Banach space (i.e., $B \\neq \\{0\\}$). A non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ must be infinite. By the Baire category theorem, a non-trivial Banach space cannot be countably infinite, so its cardinality $K$ must be at least that of the continuum, $K \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSuppose we find one isometric embedding, $f: X \\to B$. Now consider the family of functions $g_v: X \\to B$ defined by translation:\n$g_v(x) = f(x) + v$\nwhere $v$ is any vector in $B$.\n\nLet's check if $g_v$ is also an isometric embedding:\n$\\|g_v(x_1) - g_v(x_2)\\| = \\|(f(x_1) + v) - (f(x_2) + v)\\| = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$.\nSo, $g_v$ is indeed an isometric embedding for any $v \\in B$.\n\nSince each choice of a different vector $v$ gives a different function $g_v$, there are at least $|B| = K$ isometric embeddings. Since $K$ is an infinite cardinality (like $\\mathfrak{c}$), this approach gives an infinite number of embeddings.\n\nThe question asks for a \"number\", which typically implies a finite integer. An answer like \"a continuum of embeddings\" or \"$K$ embeddings\" does not seem to fit the format of the question. This suggests we should look for a special case where this reasoning does not apply.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the trivial case**\n\nThe reasoning in Step 2 relied on $B$ being a non-trivial space with infinitely many points to translate by. What if we choose the trivial Banach space?\n\n*   Let's choose $B$ to be the vector space containing only the zero vector: $B = \\{0\\}$.\n*   Is this a Banach space?\n    *   It's a vector space.\n    *   We can define a norm $\\|0\\| = 0$.\n    *   The space is complete because the only Cauchy sequence is the constant sequence $(0, 0, ...)$, which converges to $0 \\in B$.\n*   So, $B=\\{0\\}$ is a valid Banach space. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n\n**Step 4: Find embeddings into the trivial Banach space**\n\nNow we need to find an isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$. The only function possible maps every element of $X$ to the zero vector in $B$. So, $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in X$.\n\nFor this function to be an isometric embedding, it must satisfy:\n$\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$ for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$.\nSubstituting $f(x)=0$, we get:\n$\\|0 - 0\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$\n$0 = d(x_1, x_2)$\n\nThis condition must hold for all pairs of points in $X$. For a metric space, $d(x_1, x_2)=0$ if and only if $x_1=x_2$. Thus, for an embedding into $B=\\{0\\}$ to exist, the space $X$ must consist of only a single point.\n\n*   Let's choose $X$ to be a single-point space, for example, $X = \\{p\\}$. This is a valid finite ultrametric space with the metric $d(p,p)=0$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the embeddings for the trivial case**\n\n*   Let's choose our Banach space to be $B = \\{0\\}$. (Cardinality $K=1$).\n*   Let's choose our finite ultrametric space to be $X = \\{p\\}$.\n*   How many isometric embeddings are there from this $X$ to this $B$?\n    *   There is only one possible function: $f(p) = 0$.\n    *   We check the isometry condition: $d(p,p) = \\|f(p) - f(p)\\| = \\|0-0\\| = 0$. This is satisfied.\n    *   Therefore, there is exactly one isometric embedding.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the minimum possible number**\n\nWe are looking for the *smallest possible number* of isometric embeddings.\n*   We have found a specific choice of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly 1.\n*   The number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer. It cannot be 0, because for any given finite ultrametric space $X$, one can always construct a Banach space into which $X$ can be isometrically embedded (for example, the space $\\ell_\\infty(X)$ of bounded functions on $X$ with the sup-norm).\n*   Since the number of embeddings cannot be 0, and we have found a case where the number is 1, the smallest possible number is 1."
