A filtering strategy to eliminate cancer gene contamination from the CAR T cell samples can be implemented on the command line after differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. The strategy leverages the fact that contamination is specific to the control 'CAR' group, meaning contaminant genes will show a strong negative log2 fold change (LFC) in the 'CAR-IL15 vs. CAR' comparison. The process is as follows: 1) First, generate a predefined list of contaminant genes specific to the cancer cell line used in the co-culture (e.g., 'cancer_genes.txt'). 2) Run the DGE analysis to produce a results table containing columns for gene name, LFC, and adjusted p-value (padj). 3) Use a command-line tool like `awk` to filter this DGE table. The script should be configured to remove any gene that simultaneously meets three criteria: a) it is present in the 'cancer_genes.txt' list, b) it shows a strong and significant downregulation (e.g., LFC < -2), and c) this result is statistically significant (e.g., padj < 0.05). Genes that do not meet all three conditions are retained in the final filtered results file for downstream analysis.
