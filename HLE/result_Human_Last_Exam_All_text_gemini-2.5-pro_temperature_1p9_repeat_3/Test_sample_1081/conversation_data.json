    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Classification of Rational Maximal Tori**\n\nLet $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A maximal torus $T$ of $G$ is said to be $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational if it is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The Frobenius endomorphism $F$ corresponding to the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure acts on $G$. A subtorus $T$ is $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational if and only if it is fixed by $F$, i.e., $F(T) = T$.\n\nThe classification of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori up to conjugacy by the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is a classical result in the theory of reductive groups. The central theorem states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori and the $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Define F-Conjugacy Classes**\n\nLet $W$ be the Weyl group of $G$. The Frobenius endomorphism $F$ of $G$ induces an automorphism of the Weyl group, which we also denote by $F: W \\to W$. An $F$-conjugacy class in $W$ is a set of the form:\n$$ \\{h \\cdot w \\cdot F(h)^{-1} \\mid h \\in W\\} $$\nfor some $w \\in W$. Our goal is to count the number of such classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Group Structure of Type $E_8$**\n\nThe type of a reductive group is determined by its root system. The group $G$ is of type $E_8$. The structure of the Frobenius action on the Weyl group $W$ is determined by the action of $F$ on the Dynkin diagram associated with the root system.\n\nThe Dynkin diagram for $E_8$ is:\n```\n      o\n      |\no--o--o--o--o--o--o\n```\nA crucial property of this diagram is that it has no non-trivial automorphisms. The automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram is trivial.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Frobenius Action on the Weyl Group**\n\nFor a reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the corresponding Frobenius map $F$ induces an automorphism on the Weyl group $W$. This automorphism is related to the permutation of the simple roots induced by $F$, which in turn corresponds to an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram.\n\nSince the Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has only the trivial automorphism, the Frobenius endomorphism must act trivially on the set of simple roots. This implies that the group $G$ must be a **split** group. For a split group defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the induced action of the Frobenius $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ is the identity map. That is, $F(w) = w$ for all $w \\in W$.\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the Counting Problem**\n\nWith the knowledge that the Frobenius action on $W = W(E_8)$ is trivial, we can simplify the definition of an $F$-conjugacy class. The $F$-conjugacy class of an element $w \\in W$ becomes:\n$$ \\{h \\cdot w \\cdot F(h)^{-1} \\mid h \\in W\\} = \\{h \\cdot w \\cdot h^{-1} \\mid h \\in W\\} $$\nThis is precisely the definition of an ordinary conjugacy class in the group $W$.\n\nTherefore, the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n**Step 6: Find the Number of Conjugacy Classes of $W(E_8)$**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to a question about the structure of the finite group $W(E_8)$, the Weyl group of type $E_8$. This is a well-known constant in group theory. The group $W(E_8)$ is a very large finite group of order $696,729,600 = 2^{14} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$.\n\nThe number of its conjugacy classes was computed by R. Carter and others. According to established results in the representation theory of finite groups of Lie type, the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has exactly **112** conjugacy classes.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the steps, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ (up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy) is the number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$, which is 112. It is important to note that this number is an integer constant and does not depend on the size $q$ of the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, as long as the group is of type $E_8$.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Split vs. Non-split:** The crucial point is to identify that a group of type $E_8$ must be split. If the Dynkin diagram had a non-trivial automorphism (like $A_n$, $D_n$, $E_6$), there would be non-split (twisted) forms, for which the Frobenius action on $W$ is non-trivial. In those cases, counting $F$-conjugacy classes is a different, more complex task.\n*   **Isogeny Type:** The question concerns a reductive group of \"type $E_8$\". This refers to the root system. Different groups can share the same root system (e.g., simply connected, adjoint, or other intermediate forms), but they all have the same Weyl group. The classification of maximal tori only depends on the Weyl group, so the result is independent of the specific isogeny type of $G$.\n*   **Independence from q:** The final answer is a constant integer. This happens because the group is split. The number of types of maximal tori in a split group over a finite field only depends on the structure of its Weyl group, not the field itself.\n\nFinal Answer: Based on the analysis, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This is a known value.\n\n<<<112>>>"
