    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user asks for the product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene) has the structure CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. It is a conjugated diene, a molecule with two double bonds separated by one single bond. In a Diels-Alder reaction, this will act as the **diene**.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene has the structure CCl₂=CF₂. It is an alkene with electron-withdrawing halogen substituents. In a Diels-Alder reaction, this will act as the **dienophile**.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, where the 4 π-electrons of the diene and the 2 π-electrons of the dienophile react in a concerted step to form a new six-membered ring.\n\n2.  **Determine Product Connectivity:**\n    *   In a Diels-Alder reaction, three π-bonds are broken (two in the diene, one in the dienophile), and two new σ-bonds and one new π-bond are formed.\n    *   The result is a six-membered ring. Let's number the carbons of the reactants to trace their positions in the product.\n        *   Diene: C¹H₂=C²H-C³H=C⁴H₂\n        *   Dienophile: CᴬCl₂=CᴮF₂\n    *   The reaction forms new single bonds between C¹-Cᴬ and C⁴-Cᴮ (or C¹-Cᴮ and C⁴-Cᴬ). A new double bond forms between C² and C³.\n    *   The resulting six-membered ring has the connectivity: -C¹-C²=C³-C⁴-Cᴮ-Cᴬ- and back to C¹.\n    *   The final product has a cyclohexene skeleton. The substituents from the dienophile (two Cl atoms and two F atoms) are now on adjacent carbons of the saturated portion of the ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze Regioselectivity:**\n    *   Regioselectivity concerns the orientation of the reactants when both are unsymmetrical.\n    *   The diene, 1,3-butadiene, is symmetrical. Flipping it end-over-end does not change the molecule (C¹ is equivalent to C⁴, and C² is equivalent to C³).\n    *   The dienophile, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, is unsymmetrical (one end has a -CCl₂ group, the other has a -CF₂ group).\n    *   Because the diene is symmetrical, there is only one possible regiochemical product. Let's demonstrate this:\n        *   **Orientation 1:** C¹ attacks Cᴬ(Cl₂) and C⁴ attacks Cᴮ(F₂).\n        *   **Orientation 2:** C¹ attacks Cᴮ(F₂) and C⁴ attacks Cᴬ(Cl₂).\n    *   Since C¹ and C⁴ of the diene are identical, these two orientations lead to the same molecule, just viewed from a different perspective. Therefore, a single regioisomeric product is formed.\n\n4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product:**\n    *   First, we establish the structure: a cyclohexene ring with a CCl₂ group and a CF₂ group on adjacent saturated carbons.\n    *   To name the product, we follow IUPAC nomenclature rules:\n        1.  The parent ring is **cyclohexene**.\n        2.  The double bond is given the lowest possible locants, so the carbons of the double bond are numbered 1 and 2.\n        3.  The ring is then numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. Let's draw the ring and number it:\n            ```\n                   (1)C=C(2)\n                      /   \\\n                 (6)C     C(3)\n                    \\   /\n                   (5)C-C(4)\n            ```\n            The carbons from the dienophile are adjacent and saturated. They must occupy positions (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), or (6,3). Tracing the atom connectivity from step 2 confirms they are at positions 4 and 5.\n        4.  We have two ways to number the double bond (1,2 or 2,1), which leads to two possible numbering schemes for the whole ring. Let's assume the -CCl₂ group is on C(x) and -CF₂ group is on C(y).\n            *   **Scheme A:** The -CCl₂ group is at position 4 and the -CF₂ group is at position 5. The name would start \"4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluoro...\". The locant set is {4,4,5,5}.\n            *   **Scheme B:** The -CF₂ group is at position 4 and the -CCl₂ group is at position 5. The name would start \"5,5-dichloro-4,4-difluoro...\". The locant set is also {4,4,5,5}.\n        5.  Since both numbering schemes give the identical locant set {4,4,5,5}, we apply the alphabetical rule. The substituents are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\". \"Dichloro\" comes first alphabetically. Therefore, the substituent cited first in the name must be given the lower locant.\n        6.  This means the -CCl₂ group receives position 4, and the -CF₂ group receives position 5.\n    *   The correct IUPAC name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n5.  **Consider Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific. However, the dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂) is planar and has no stereocenters.\n    *   The product molecule also has no chiral centers (the carbons bearing the halogens each have two identical substituents). Thus, there are no stereoisomers to consider.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Reaction Identification:** Correctly identifying the reaction as a Diels-Alder is the crucial first step.\n*   **Connectivity:** Ensuring the new bonds are formed correctly (C1 and C4 of diene to the two carbons of dienophile) and the new double bond is in the correct place (between C2 and C3 of the original diene). This places the substituents from the dienophile on carbons 4 and 5 of the resulting cyclohexene ring.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The key point is recognizing that the symmetry of butadiene simplifies the outcome, leading to only one product, avoiding a mixture of regioisomers.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:** Careful application of numbering rules is required. The priority is: 1) Double bond lowest number (1,2), 2) Substituents lowest locant set, 3) If locant sets are tied, give the alphabetically first substituent the lower number.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe reaction is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Butadiene acts as the diene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene acts as the dienophile. Due to the symmetry of butadiene, only one regioisomer is formed. The product is a cyclohexene ring substituted with a CCl₂ group and a CF₂ group on the adjacent carbons at positions 4 and 5. Based on IUPAC rules, the final product is named 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene.\n\n***\n\n**Structure of the product:**\n\n```\n       CH=CH\n      /     \\\n H₂C       CH₂\n   |         |\n  F₂C-------CCl₂\n```\n\nThis corresponds to the name **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
