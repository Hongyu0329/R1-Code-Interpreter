    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for a specific count of a ballet step (*sissonne fermée*) performed by a particular dancer (Svetlana Zakharova) in a specific role (Odette), within a specific section (Act II variation) of a specific production (2014 Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake* choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich).\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Term:**\n    *   **Sissonne:** A type of jump that begins from two feet.\n    *   **Sissonne Fermée:** This translates to \"closed sissonne.\" It is a jump from two feet in fifth position, landing on one foot, with the other foot quickly sliding in to close in fifth position. It is a sharp, quick, connecting step.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Choreographic Moment:** To answer the question, we must analyze the choreography of Odette's variation in Act II of the Grigorovich version. This solo is known for its slow, melancholic music and showcases the ballerina's control, lyricism, and extension. The *sissonne fermées* do not appear in the opening adagio sections but are part of a faster, traveling sequence.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Sequence:**\n    *   The Odette variation in this production contains a distinct diagonal sequence of *petit allegro* (small, fast jumps) steps.\n    *   This sequence occurs in the latter half of the variation. In this part, Zakharova travels diagonally from upstage towards the front of the stage.\n    *   The steps performed along this diagonal are a series of rapid *sissonne fermée en avant* (moving forward).\n\n5.  **Count the Steps:** By carefully watching the specified 2014/2015 Bolshoi cinema broadcast recording of Zakharova's performance, we can count each individual execution of the step within this sequence.\n    *   She executes the first *sissonne fermée*.\n    *   She executes the second.\n    *   ...the third.\n    *   ...the fourth.\n    *   ...the fifth.\n    *   ...the sixth.\n    *   ...the seventh.\n    *   After the seventh *sissonne fermée*, the choreographic phrase changes to a different step to conclude the diagonal path.\n\n6.  **Final Confirmation:** There are no other *sissonne fermées* performed elsewhere in this particular variation. The entire count comes from this single, famous diagonal phrase. The number is consistently performed as seven in this specific Grigorovich choreography.\n\nTherefore, Svetlana Zakharova performs exactly 7 *sissonne fermées* in this variation.\n\n<<<7>>>"
