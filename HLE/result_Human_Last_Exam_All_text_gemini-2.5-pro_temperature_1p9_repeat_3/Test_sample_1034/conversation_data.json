    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Problem\n\nLet the triangle be `ABC`. The lengths of the sides opposite to vertices A, B, and C are denoted by `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n*   `a = BC = S`\n*   `m∠B = 30°`\n*   `b = AC`\n*   `c = AB`\n\nThe question asks for the number of integer values of `b` (side `AC`) for which there are two possible values for `c` (side `AB`). This is a classic example of the \"ambiguous case\" in trigonometry, also known as the SSA (Side-Side-Angle) case.\n\n### Step 2: Derive the Condition for Two Possible Triangles\n\nThere are two primary methods to find the condition on `b` for two triangles to exist.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Law of Sines**\n\nThe Law of Sines states: `a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)`.\nUsing the given values, we can write:\n`S / sin(A) = b / sin(30°)`\n`sin(A) = (S * sin(30°)) / b = (S * 1/2) / b = S / (2b)`\n\nFor two possible triangles to exist, there must be two possible values for angle A. This happens when:\n1.  `0 < sin(A) < 1`. This ensures there are two solutions for A: an acute angle `A₁` and an obtuse angle `A₂ = 180° - A₁`.\n2.  Both of these angle solutions must lead to a valid triangle. The sum of angles in a triangle must be 180°.\n    *   For `A₁` (acute): `A₁ + B + C₁ = 180°`. Since `A₁ < 90°` and `B = 30°`, `A₁ + B < 120°`, so a valid triangle is always possible.\n    *   For `A₂` (obtuse): `A₂ + B + C₂ = 180°`. This is only possible if `A₂ + B < 180°`. Substituting `A₂ = 180° - A₁`, we get `(180° - A₁) + B < 180°`, which simplifies to `B < A₁`.\n\nLet's combine the conditions:\n*   From `0 < sin(A) < 1`: We get `0 < S / (2b) < 1`. Since S and b are side lengths, `S/(2b)` is positive. The condition becomes `S / (2b) < 1`, which implies `S < 2b`, or `b > S/2`.\n*   From `B < A₁`: Since both angles are acute, we can take the sine of both sides without changing the inequality: `sin(B) < sin(A₁)`. This means `sin(30°) < S / (2b)`, which gives `1/2 < S / (2b)`. This simplifies to `b < S`.\n\nCombining both conditions, we find that for two triangles to exist, the length of side `b` (AC) must satisfy `S/2 < b < S`.\n\n**Method 2: Using the Law of Cosines**\n\nWe can relate the sides and the given angle using the Law of Cosines with respect to angle B:\n`b² = a² + c² - 2ac * cos(B)`\n`b² = S² + c² - 2Sc * cos(30°)`\n`b² = S² + c² - 2Sc * (√3 / 2)`\n`b² = S² + c² - cS√3`\n\nWe can rearrange this into a quadratic equation for the unknown side `c = AB`:\n`c² - (S√3)c + (S² - b²) = 0`\n\nFor there to be two possible values for side `c` (AB), this quadratic equation must have two distinct positive real roots.\n1.  **Two distinct real roots**: The discriminant (`D`) must be greater than 0.\n    `D = (-S√3)² - 4(1)(S² - b²) > 0`\n    `3S² - 4S² + 4b² > 0`\n    `4b² - S² > 0`\n    `4b² > S²`\n    `2b > S` (since b and S must be positive lengths)\n    `b > S/2`\n2.  **Both roots must be positive**: For a quadratic equation `Ax²+Bx+C=0`, if the sum of roots (`-B/A`) and the product of roots (`C/A`) are both positive, then both roots are positive.\n    *   Sum of roots: `c₁ + c₂ = S√3`. Since `S > 0`, the sum is positive.\n    *   Product of roots: `c₁ * c₂ = S² - b²`. For this to be positive, we need `S² - b² > 0`, which means `S² > b²`. Since lengths are positive, this implies `S > b`.\n\nCombining these two conditions (`b > S/2` and `b < S`), we get `S/2 < b < S`, which confirms the result from the first method.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The value of S**: The problem states `S = SNYWR`. This is a placeholder, likely an answer from a previous question in a competition. Without this specific value, a final numerical answer cannot be calculated. A reasonable assumption based on known instances of this problem is `S=30`. We will use this value for the final calculation.\n*   **Ambiguous Case Condition**: The core of the problem is correctly identifying and applying the condition for the ambiguous case (SSA), which is that the side opposite the given angle must be longer than the altitude from the included vertex but shorter than the other given side.\n*   **Integer Values**: The question specifically asks for the *number of integer values* for `AC` (`b`). This means we must count the integers strictly between `S/2` and `S`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Establish the inequality for AC**: As derived above, for there to be two possible values for side `AB`, the length of side `AC` (denoted as `b`) must satisfy:\n    `S/2 < b < S`\n\n2.  **Substitute the value of S**: Assuming `S = 30` (as discussed in the careful points):\n    `30/2 < b < 30`\n    `15 < b < 30`\n\n3.  **Count the integers**: We need to find the number of integers `b` that satisfy `15 < b < 30`. These integers are:\n    `16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29`\n\n4.  **Final Count**: The number of integers is `29 - 16 + 1 = 13 + 1 = 14`.\n\nThus, there are 14 possible integer values for the side `AC`.\n\n<<<14>>>"
