    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source:** \"Homestar Runner\" online cartoon series.\n    *   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n    *   **Event within the Episode:** The Junior prom.\n    *   **Subject:** A cardboard cutout of a fictional singer.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the name of this singer.\n\n2.  **Recall/Research the Episode:**\n    *   \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" is the final issue of the series, where the four main characters (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attend their junior prom.\n    *   The episode is, as always, narrated by the character Strong Bad, who is drawing the comic.\n\n3.  **Focus on the Musical Performance:**\n    *   During the prom scene, Strong Bad announces a musical guest.\n    *   His narration is: \"The prom has a real live musical guest this year! Or, at least a cardboard cutout of one.\"\n    *   The camera then pans to the stage.\n\n4.  **Identify the Performer:**\n    *   On the stage, there is a cardboard cutout of a male figure holding an acoustic guitar. He has an indie/emo musician appearance, fitting the mid-2000s era when the cartoon was made.\n    *   As the cutout is shown, a caption appears on the screen to introduce him.\n\n5.  **Identify the Name:**\n    *   The name displayed in the caption is **\"Thompkins\"**.\n    *   Strong Bad then proceeds to \"sing\" a parody of a melodramatic indie song as if it were being performed by Tompkins (\"My face is my own! My face is my own! I have a receipt!\").\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Fictional Singer:** It is crucial to note that \"Thompkins\" is a fictional creation for this specific joke. He is not a real-world musician.\n*   **Cardboard Cutout:** The question specifically asks about a cardboard cutout, which is exactly what Strong Bad describes and what is shown on screen.\n*   **Episode Specificity:** This event occurs specifically in Issue #15, which is the prom-themed finale of the original Teen Girl Squad run.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately determine the name of the fictional singer.\n\n<<<Thompkins>>>"
