    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem asks for the long-term behavior of the probabilities $P_i(t)$ in a system described by the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations. Specifically, we need to find the sum of the steady-state probabilities $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$.\n\nLet $P_i = \\lim_{t\\to+\\infty} P_i(t)$. In the steady state, the probabilities are constant, which means their derivatives are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\n**1. Formulate the steady-state equations:**\nBy setting $P_i'(t) = 0$ in the given system of differential equations, we get a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1. $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$\n2. $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n3. $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}$\n4. $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n5. $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$ (This is the normalization condition for probabilities)\n\n**2. Check for consistency (Careful Point):**\nA key property of a valid Kolmogorov-Chapman system is the conservation of total probability. This means the sum of the derivatives must be zero: $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i'(t) = 0$. Let's check this with the given equations.\nSumming the first four equations:\n$P_0' + P_1' + P_2' + P_3' = (-\\lambda_{01}P_0 + \\lambda_{10}P_1) + (-\\lambda_{01}P_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_1 + \\dots) + \\dots$\nThe terms in $P_0$ are $-\\lambda_{01}P_0 - \\lambda_{01}P_0 = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0$.\nThe terms in $P_1$ are $\\lambda_{10}P_1 - (\\lambda_{10}+\\lambda_{12})P_1 + \\lambda_{12}P_1 = 0$.\nThe terms in $P_2$ are $\\lambda_{21}P_2 - (\\lambda_{21}+\\lambda_{23})P_2 + \\lambda_{23}P_2 = 0$.\nThe terms in $P_3$ are $\\lambda_{31}P_3 - \\lambda_{31}P_3 = 0$.\nThe sum is $P_0' + P_1' + P_2' + P_3' = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0$.\nFrom the fifth equation, $P_0+P_1+P_2+P_3=1$, we can differentiate with respect to $t$ to get $P_0'+P_1'+P_2'+P_3'=0$.\nThis leads to the contradiction $-2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t) = 0$. Since $\\lambda_{01}=0.019 \\neq 0$, this would imply $P_0(t)=0$, which further leads to all $P_i(t)=0$, violating the normalization condition.\nThe most likely reason for this is a typo in the second equation. In a standard Kolmogorov system, the term corresponding to flow from state $i$ to state $j$ (i.e., $\\lambda_{ij}P_i$) appears with a negative sign in the equation for $P_i'$ and a positive sign in the equation for $P_j'$. The term $\\lambda_{01}P_0$ represents flow from state 0, so it should be positive in the equation for $P_1'$.\nWe will proceed by assuming the corrected second equation is:\n$P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$.\nWith this correction, the sum of derivatives becomes zero, and the system is consistent. The steady-state version of the corrected second equation is automatically satisfied if the other balance equations hold, so we can disregard it and use the others.\n\n**3. Solve the system of linear equations:**\nOur system for the steady-state probabilities $P_i$ is:\n1. $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$\n2. $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}$\n3. $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n4. $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1$.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n$0.4 P_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) P_2 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_2 = P_3$.\n\nSo, we have $P_2 = P_1$ and $P_3 = P_1$.\n\n**4. Use the normalization condition:**\nSubstitute the expressions for $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$ into the normalization equation:\n$P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n$\\frac{650}{19} P_1 + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3) P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19}) P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}) P_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} P_1 = 1$\n$P_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$.\n\n**5. Calculate $P_0$:**\n$P_0 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$.\n\n**6. Find the required sum:**\nThe problem asks for $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$.\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\n\n**7. Final Answer Calculation:**\nTo get a numerical value, we compute the fraction:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\nRounding to five significant figures, the result is 0.94625.\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
