    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring ones on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n(Oganesson is a synthetic element and not relevant here).\n\n**Step 2: Define the Scope of \"Terrestrial Matter\"**\nThe question asks for the percentage of all terrestrial matter. This includes the Earth's atmosphere, crust, and oceans. The primary reservoir for most noble gases is the atmosphere.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas**\nWe need to compare the total amount of each gas on Earth. The specified year, 2002, does not significantly change the long-term abundances of these elements.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** It is the most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.934% of the Earth's atmosphere. Its abundance is high due to the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust over geological time.\n*   **Neon (Ne), Helium (He), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe):** These are the other stable noble gases. Their abundance in the atmosphere, from most to least common, is: Neon > Helium > Krypton > Xenon. Xenon is the rarest among this stable group, with an atmospheric concentration of about 0.087 parts per million (ppm).\n*   **Radon (Rn):** This gas is fundamentally different from the others because it is radioactive and has a very short half-life. The most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n\n**Step 4: The Critical Point - Stable vs. Radioactive**\nThe key to answering this question is understanding the difference between a stable rare gas like Xenon and a radioactive gas like Radon.\n\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Although it is very rare, Xenon is a stable element. This means that over Earth's history, the amount that has outgassed from the planet's interior has accumulated, primarily in the atmosphere. The total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is estimated to be in the trillions of kilograms.\n*   **Radon (Rn):** Radon is constantly being created in the Earth's crust through the radioactive decay chain of uranium and thorium. However, because its half-life is so short, it decays into other elements almost as quickly as it is produced. It does not accumulate in the environment. Its concentration at any given moment is incredibly low. Estimates place the total amount of radon in the entire atmosphere at any given time at only a few tens of kilograms.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nComparing the total amounts, the steady-state quantity of Radon on Earth at any given time is orders of magnitude less than the total quantity of Xenon. Therefore, as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, Radon is by far the rarest noble gas.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
