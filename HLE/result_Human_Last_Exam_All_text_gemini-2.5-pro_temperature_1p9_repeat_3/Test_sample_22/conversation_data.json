    "This question asks us to evaluate the relationship between two key concepts in statistical genetics: the predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS) and SNP heritability.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):**\n    *   Heritability, in general, is the proportion of variation in a trait (phenotype) that is due to genetic variation.\n    *   SNP heritability specifically refers to the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the *additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)* that are typically measured on a genotyping chip.\n    *   Crucially, h²_SNP is a theoretical concept. It represents the *maximum possible* variance that could be explained if we knew the *true, underlying effect size* of every single one of those SNPs and used them in a perfect linear predictive model. It's the theoretical ceiling for prediction based on this set of SNPs.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability:**\n    *   A Polygenic Score is a practical tool designed to predict a phenotype. It's a weighted sum of an individual's alleles for many SNPs.\n    *   The weights used in the PGS are not the true, unknown effect sizes. Instead, they are *estimates* derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n    *   The predictive ability of a PGS is measured in an independent test sample, typically by calculating the R² (the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can explain).\n\n3.  **Compare the two concepts:**\n    *   The key difference lies in the effect sizes (weights) used. SNP heritability assumes perfect knowledge of the *true* effect sizes, while a PGS uses *estimated* effect sizes.\n    *   Any real-world GWAS is based on a finite number of individuals. This finite sample size means that the effect sizes we estimate will always have some level of statistical noise or \"estimation error.\" They will not be exactly equal to the true effect sizes.\n    *   Because the PGS is built using these imperfect, estimated weights, it cannot be a perfect predictor. Its ability to explain variance will be degraded by the estimation error in the weights.\n    *   The SNP heritability represents the predictive performance of a hypothetical, perfect PGS built with true weights. The actual PGS, built with estimated weights, will therefore have lower predictive performance.\n\n### Careful points to consider:\n\n*   **The theoretical ceiling:** SNP heritability (h²_SNP) acts as the theoretical maximum R² achievable by any linear predictor using the given SNPs. A PGS is a linear predictor. Therefore, its performance is fundamentally capped by h²_SNP.\n*   **Factors affecting PGS performance:** The actual R² of a PGS is always lower than h²_SNP in practice and depends on factors like the sample size of the discovery GWAS (larger is better), the polygenicity of the trait, and the statistical methods used to build the score. As GWAS sample sizes increase, the R² of PGSs gets closer to the h²_SNP, but it cannot exceed it.\n*   **The word \"necessarily\":** The word \"necessarily\" implies this relationship must always hold. Given that a real PGS is built from imperfect data (a finite GWAS sample) and SNP heritability is defined as the theoretical maximum with perfect data, the predictive ability of the PGS is indeed necessarily lower than (or at best, in a hypothetical infinite sample, equal to) the SNP heritability. It cannot be higher.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe statement posits that the performance of a real-world predictive tool (PGS) is lower than the theoretical maximum possible performance (SNP heritability). This is analogous to saying that a weather forecast based on incomplete data will necessarily be less accurate than a hypothetical perfect forecast that used complete and perfect data. The logic holds.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
