The laboratory's mistake was misinterpreting the result of their Quality Control (QC) check. They observed growth of the QC bacterium, *Bacillus subtilis*, on the control plate and considered this an "expected" or successful result. However, for a selective medium containing chloramphenicol (an antibiotic), the correct result to confirm its efficacy would be the *inhibition* of bacterial growth. The growth they observed was actually evidence that the antibiotic had been inactivated (by being added before autoclaving) and that the media batch was defective and would not inhibit bacteria.
