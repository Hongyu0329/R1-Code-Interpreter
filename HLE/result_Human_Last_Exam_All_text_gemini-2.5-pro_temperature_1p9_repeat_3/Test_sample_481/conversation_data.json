    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the different numbers on the specified capsules.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The request is for Teva brand fluoxetine capsules.\n2.  **Identify the First Dosage:** The first dosage specified is 10mg.\n3.  **Research the Imprint for the 10mg Capsule:** A search for the imprint on a Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule reveals the code \"TEVA 7101\". The question asks for the number part of the imprint.\n4.  **Isolate the Number for the 10mg Capsule:** The number imprinted on the Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule is **7101**.\n5.  **Identify the Second Dosage:** The second dosage specified is 20mg.\n6.  **Research the Imprint for the 20mg Capsule:** A search for the imprint on a Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule reveals the code \"TEVA 7102\".\n7.  **Isolate the Number for the 20mg Capsule:** The number imprinted on the Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule is **7102**.\n8.  **Final Answer Formulation:** Based on the analysis, the different numbers are 7101 for the 10mg capsule and 7102 for the 20mg capsule. All constraints (no color, size, or the word \"PLIVA\") have been followed.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   The query specifically asks for \"Teva brand\" and explicitly excludes the word \"PLIVA\". This is important because Teva owns Pliva, and some fluoxetine capsules distributed by Teva may bear the \"PLIVA\" marking with different numbers (e.g., PLIVA 647 or PLIVA 648). The analysis must focus only on imprints containing the \"TEVA\" mark.\n*   The query focuses strictly on the \"numbers\" on the capsules, requiring the extraction of the numerical part of the full imprint code.\n*   Negative constraints (color, size) must be strictly adhered to, ensuring the answer does not contain this information.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsule has the number 7101 imprinted on it, and the 20mg capsule has the number 7102 imprinted on it.>>>"
