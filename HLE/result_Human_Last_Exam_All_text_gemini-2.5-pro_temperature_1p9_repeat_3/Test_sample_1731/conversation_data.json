    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta, using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Step 1: Conceptual Framework and Connection to Large Deviation Theory\n\nThe core of the problem lies in finding the most probable macroscopic state (the equilibrium state) of a system. Large Deviation Theory (LDT), specifically theorems like Cramer-Chernoff and Sanov, provides the mathematical foundation for the methods used in statistical mechanics.\n\n*   **Sanov's Theorem**: This theorem states that the probability of the empirical distribution of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables being \"far\" from the true underlying distribution decays exponentially. The rate of this decay is governed by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.\n*   **Principle of Maximum Entropy**: In statistical mechanics, we assume we have no prior knowledge about the system's microstate, other than certain macroscopic constraints (like fixed total energy). This corresponds to a uniform prior distribution over all possible microstates. According to LDT, finding the most likely configuration under a given constraint is equivalent to finding the distribution that minimizes the KL divergence from this uniform prior. This, in turn, is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy, $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the number of microstates corresponding to the macrostate.\n\nTherefore, \"using Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems\" translates to applying the **Principle of Maximum Entropy** to find the equilibrium distribution, which is the most probable one.\n\n### Step 2: System Definition and Entropy for a Photon Gas\n\nThe system is a gas of light quanta (photons) in a volume $V$.\n\n1.  **Photon Properties**: Photons are indistinguishable bosons. Crucially, they can be created and destroyed (e.g., absorbed and emitted by the container walls), which means their total number is not conserved. This implies their chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n2.  **Microstate Counting**: For a given energy level $\\epsilon_j$ with degeneracy $g_j$ (meaning there are $g_j$ distinct states with this energy), the number of ways to arrange $n_j$ indistinguishable photons is given by the Bose-Einstein counting formula:\n    $\\Omega_j = \\frac{(n_j + g_j - 1)!}{n_j! (g_j - 1)!}$\n3.  **Total Entropy**: The total number of microstates for a given distribution $\\{n_j\\}$ across all energy levels is $\\Omega = \\prod_j \\Omega_j$. The entropy of the system is given by Boltzmann's formula, $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. Using Stirling's approximation ($\\ln x! \\approx x\\ln x - x$) for large $n_j$ and $g_j$, the entropy becomes:\n    $S = k_B \\sum_j [ (n_j + g_j) \\ln(n_j + g_j) - n_j \\ln n_j - g_j \\ln g_j ]$\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Equilibrium Distribution via Maximization\n\nTo find the equilibrium state, we maximize the entropy $S$ subject to the constraint that the total mean energy $E$ is constant:\nConstraint: $E = \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j$\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers, maximizing the function $\\mathcal{L} = S/k_B - \\beta E$, where $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier. Setting the derivative with respect to $n_j$ to zero ($\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_j} = 0$) yields the most probable (equilibrium) number of photons in the energy level $\\epsilon_j$:\n\n$n_j = \\frac{g_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n\nThis is the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for particles with zero chemical potential. The Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$. The average number of particles per state is $\\langle n_j \\rangle = n_j/g_j = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy, E\n\nTo calculate the total energy, we replace the sum over discrete levels with an integral over a continuous energy spectrum. This requires the density of states for photons in a 3D box of volume $V$. Including the two polarization states, this is:\n$g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n\nThe total energy $E$ is the integral of the energy per state ($\\epsilon$) times the number of particles in that state ($n(\\epsilon) = \\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle g(\\epsilon)$):\n\n$E = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot \\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle \\cdot g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} \\cdot \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n$E = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution $x = \\beta \\epsilon$:\n$E = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\beta^4}\\right) \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\n\nThe definite integral is a standard result related to the Riemann zeta function: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$. Substituting this value and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ gives the equilibrium mean energy:\n\n$E = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V}{15 h^3 c^3} \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V}{15 h^3 c^3} T^4$\n\nThis result is the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law** for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy, S\n\nThe entropy can be calculated using the formula from Step 2, substituting the equilibrium distribution. A more direct thermodynamic approach is to use the relation $S = (E - F)/T$, where $F$ is the Helmholtz Free Energy. For a boson gas with $\\mu=0$, the free energy is given by:\n\n$F = -k_B T \\ln \\mathcal{Z} = k_B T \\sum_j g_j \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j})$\n\nAgain, we convert the sum to an integral:\n$F = k_B T \\int_0^\\infty \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}) \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n\nEvaluating this integral (typically via integration by parts) gives:\n$F = - \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V}{45 h^3 c^3} T^4$\n\nNotice that $F = -\\frac{1}{3} E$. Now we find the entropy:\n$S = \\frac{E - F}{T} = \\frac{E - (-\\frac{1}{3}E)}{T} = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{E}{T}$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $E$ from Step 4:\n$S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V}{15 h^3 c^3} T^4 \\right) = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V}{45 h^3 c^3} T^3$\n\nThis is the equilibrium entropy for a photon gas.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **LDT Connection**: The problem's framing requires understanding that LDT provides the rigorous justification for using the principle of maximum entropy to determine the equilibrium state.\n*   **Photon Statistics**: Correctly identifying photons as indistinguishable bosons with non-conserved particle number ($\\mu=0$) is fundamental.\n*   **State Counting**: Using the appropriate Bose-Einstein counting for microstates is crucial for deriving the entropy formula.\n*   **Continuous Approximation**: The transition from summation over discrete energy levels to integration over a continuous spectrum is an approximation valid for macroscopic systems where energy levels are closely spaced.\n*   **Density of States**: The calculation depends critically on using the correct density of states for a 3D photon gas, including the factor of 2 for polarization.\n*   **Standard Integrals**: The final results rely on the known values of specific definite integrals involving the Bose-Einstein function, such as $\\int_0^\\infty x^3/(e^x-1)dx = \\pi^4/15$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values of the mean energy and entropy for a photon gas (Bose case of light quanta) in a volume $V$ at temperature $T$ are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):**\n$E = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V}{15 h^3 c^3} T^4$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n$S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V}{45 h^3 c^3} T^3$\n\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $E = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V}{15 h^3 c^3} T^4$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B^4 V}{45 h^3 c^3} T^3$\n>>>"
