    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's computational time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Basic Operations:** The algorithm uses basic arithmetic operations such as assignment (`:=`), division (`⌊x/c⌋`), multiplication (`qc`), subtraction (`x - qc`), increment (`i := i + 1`), and comparison (`q > 0`). We assume that for integers that fit within a standard computer word, these operations take constant time, which is denoted as O(1).\n\n2.  **Analyze Non-Looping Part (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0;`: This is one assignment operation, taking O(1) time.\n    *   `x := n;`: This is one assignment operation, taking O(1) time.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: This involves one division operation, taking O(1) time.\n    *   `a_0 := x — qc;`: This involves one multiplication and one subtraction, taking O(1) time.\n    *   Therefore, the total time for the initialization in Step 1 is constant: O(1) + O(1) + O(1) + O(1) = O(1).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Loop (Step 2):**\n    The core of the algorithm's execution time is determined by the `while` loop. To find its complexity, we need to determine two things:\n    a. The cost of a single loop iteration.\n    b. The total number of times the loop executes.\n\n    **a. Cost of a Single Iteration (Step 2.1):**\n    *   `i := i + 1;`: One increment operation, O(1).\n    *   `x := q;`: One assignment, O(1).\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: One division, O(1).\n    *   `a_{i} := x — qc;`: One multiplication and one subtraction, O(1).\n    *   The total cost for a single iteration of the loop is the sum of these constant-time operations, which is O(1).\n\n    **b. Number of Iterations:**\n    *   The loop continues as long as the condition `q > 0` is true. We need to track how the value of `q` changes.\n    *   Before the loop, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   Inside the first iteration, `x` is set to the current `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋`, which is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`. Due to the properties of floor division, this is equal to `⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   After the second iteration, `q` becomes `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    *   In general, after `k` iterations of the loop, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` is no longer greater than 0, i.e., when `q = 0`. This occurs when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`, which means `n/c^(k+1) < 1`.\n    *   This is equivalent to `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    *   Let `k_max` be the total number of iterations. The loop executes as long as `n ≥ c^(k+1)`. The number of iterations is thus determined by how many times we can divide `n` by `c` before the result is less than 1. This is a logarithmic relationship.\n    *   The number of iterations is `k_max = ⌊log_c(n)⌋`. For example, if n=100 and c=10, `log₁₀(100) = 2`. The digits are (1,0,0). `i` goes from 0 to 2. The loop runs for i=1 and i=2, so it runs 2 times. `⌊log₁₀(100)⌋ = 2`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of loop iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`. In Big-O notation, this is `O(log_c n)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Loop Time:**\n    *   The total time complexity of the loop is the number of iterations multiplied by the cost per iteration.\n    *   Total Loop Time = `O(log_c n)` * `O(1)` = `O(log_c n)`.\n\n5.  **Analyze Step 3 (Return):**\n    *   The `return` statement gives back the sequence of calculated digits. The time to do this is at most proportional to the number of digits, which is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. This complexity is already captured by the analysis of the loop that generates these digits. It does not add a higher order of complexity.\n\n6.  **Overall Complexity:**\n    *   The total time complexity of the algorithm is the sum of the complexities of its parts:\n        Time(Total) = Time(Step 1) + Time(Step 2) + Time(Step 3)\n        Time(Total) = O(1) + O(log_c n) + O(1)\n    *   When combining complexities, we keep the term with the highest growth rate. In this case, the dominant term is `O(log_c n)`.\n    *   By the change of base rule for logarithms (`log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`), the base `c` is just a constant factor. In Big-O notation, constant factors are omitted.\n    *   Thus, the final complexity is written as `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Input Size:** The complexity is a function of the magnitude of the input integer `n`, not the number of bits required to store `n`. If the input size was defined as `k`, the number of bits in `n` (where `k ≈ log n`), the complexity would be `O(k)`. However, standard practice is to express complexity in terms of the value `n`.\n*   **Arithmetic Model:** The analysis assumes a \"uniform cost model\", where basic arithmetic operations on numbers take O(1) time. This is valid as long as `n` and `c` fit into a single machine word (e.g., 64 bits). If `n` were an arbitrary-precision integer, division would not be O(1), and the complexity would be higher (typically `O((log n)²) `). Given the simple pseudo-code, the O(1) assumption is standard.\n*   **Base of Logarithm:** The base `c` affects the actual number of operations, but not the asymptotic complexity class. `O(log_c n)` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations in the `while` loop. The value of `q` is divided by `c` in each iteration. This process is repeated until `q` becomes 0. The number of such divisions is proportional to `log_c(n)`. Since each iteration takes constant time, the total time complexity is `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
