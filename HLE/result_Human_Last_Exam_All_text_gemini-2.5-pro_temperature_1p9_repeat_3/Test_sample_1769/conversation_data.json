    "This is a question of counterfactual historical linguistics. To determine the answer, we must trace the etymology of the current word and its native counterpart.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the origin of the current word \"sister\".** The modern word \"sister\" is not a direct descendant of the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word. It is a loanword adopted into Middle English around the year 1200 from the Old Norse word *systir*. This borrowing occurred as a direct result of the extensive contact, settlement, and linguistic influence of the Norse-speaking Vikings in England, particularly in the Danelaw region.\n\n2.  **Identify the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word.** Before the Norse influence became dominant, the word used by the Anglo-Saxons for a female sibling was *sweostor*. This word is of Proto-Germanic origin (*swestr-), sharing a common ancestor with the Old Norse *systir* and other Germanic languages (e.g., German *Schwester*, Dutch *zuster*).\n\n3.  **Analyze the phonological development without Norse influence.** If the Norse had never invaded, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have evolved naturally into Modern English, much like other core family relationship words did. We can predict its likely evolution by comparing it to similar words:\n    *   Old English *brōþor* evolved into Modern English *brother*.\n    *   Old English *mōdor* evolved into Modern English *mother*.\n    *   Old English *fæder* evolved into Modern English *father*.\n\n4.  **Trace the likely path of *sweostor*.**\n    *   In Middle English, *sweostor* would have likely simplified. We see attested forms like *swoster* and, more commonly, *suster*. The initial \"sw-\" cluster often simplified to \"s-\" before a rounded back vowel (like the 'o' or 'u'). This loss of the /w/ sound is seen in words like \"sword\" (from OE *sweord*) where the 'w' is no longer pronounced.\n    *   The form *suster* became common in Middle English dialects, especially in the south and west where Norse influence was weaker.\n    *   Following the pattern of *mother* and *brother*, the vowel /u/ in *suster* (pronounced like the 'u' in \"put\") would have undergone the \"Great Vowel Shift\". Specifically, the short 'u' sound shifted to the /ʌ/ sound, which we hear in words like \"cut\" or \"sun\".\n    *   The ending \"-or\" or \"-er\" would have remained, just as it did in *brother* and *mother*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the regular patterns of English language evolution, the Old English word *sweostor* would have developed into the Middle English *suster*, and then into a Modern English form that would be spelled the same and pronounced with the /ʌ/ vowel sound. In fact, this word survived in some regional English dialects and in Scots long after \"sister\" became the standard.\n\nTherefore, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **suster**.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
