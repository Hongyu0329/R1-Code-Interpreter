    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number for any graph with 12345 vertices, with the condition that the graph is not a complete graph.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the key terms:**\n    *   **Graph G:** A set of vertices (V) and edges (E). Here, the number of vertices is $|V| = n = 12345$.\n    *   **Complete Graph ($K_n$)**: A graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n    *   **Proper Colouring**: An assignment of colours to the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour.\n    *   **Chromatic Number ($\\chi(G)$)**: The minimum number of colours needed for a proper colouring of graph G.\n    *   **The Goal**: Find the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ for any graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n\n2.  **Establish an upper bound for the chromatic number:**\n    *   A fundamental theorem in graph theory states that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n    *   The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$. This is because to need $n$ distinct colours, every vertex must be adjacent to every other vertex, which is the definition of a complete graph.\n\n3.  **Apply the constraint from the question:**\n    *   The problem specifies that the graph $G$ is **not** the complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n    *   Since $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$.\n    *   Therefore, for any such graph $G$, we must have $\\chi(G) < n$, which means $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n    *   This establishes $n-1 = 12345 - 1 = 12344$ as a theoretical upper bound for the number of colours needed.\n\n4.  **Verify if this upper bound is achievable:**\n    *   To confirm that 12344 is the maximum possible value, we need to show that there exists at least one graph $G$ that satisfies the conditions (12345 vertices, not a complete graph) and has a chromatic number of exactly 12344.\n    *   Let's construct such a graph. Consider a graph $G$ created by taking a complete graph on $n-1=12344$ vertices, called a $(n-1)$-clique or $K_{n-1}$, and adding one more vertex, $v$, that is not connected to any of the other vertices (an isolated vertex).\n    *   Let's check if this graph $G$ meets the criteria:\n        *   **Number of vertices:** It has $(n-1) + 1 = n = 12345$ vertices.\n        *   **Is it a complete graph?** No, because the vertex $v$ is not connected to the other $n-1$ vertices. So, $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n        *   **What is its chromatic number?** The subgraph $K_{n-1}$ is a clique of size $n-1$, so it requires $n-1$ distinct colours. The isolated vertex $v$ can be coloured with any of these $n-1$ colours (or a new one, but we seek the minimum). Since the chromatic number of the graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components, $\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_{n-1}) = n-1 = 12344$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that any graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph can be coloured with at most $12344$ colours.\n    *   We have also constructed a specific graph that satisfies these conditions and requires exactly $12344$ colours.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of colours that we could need is $n-1$.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nWith $n=12345$, the maximum number of colours is $12345 - 1 = 12344$. The mention of the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ is related to Brooks' Theorem, which provides an upper bound $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$ for most connected graphs. While this is a relevant concept, a more fundamental property of chromatic numbers is sufficient to solve this problem directly."
