    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Movement: Cambré Derrière**\n*   *Cambré* means \"arched\" or \"bent.\" *Derrière* means \"to the back.\"\n*   Therefore, a *cambré derrière* is a backward bend of the upper body, originating from the waist and arching the spine backward.\n*   This is a fundamental ballet movement used to develop back flexibility, strength, and artistry.\n\n**2. Analyze the Vaganova Method Approach**\n*   **Emphasis:** The Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia, is known for its precision, strength, epaulement (the artistic use of the head and shoulders), and anatomical correctness. The system is designed to be logical and progressive, building a strong and injury-free foundation.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   The bend is initiated by lifting the sternum up towards the ceiling, creating length in the spine *before* bending.\n    *   The arch happens primarily in the upper and middle back (thoracic spine).\n    *   **Crucial Point:** The hips and pelvis must remain absolutely still, square, and aligned over the supporting legs. There is a strong emphasis on *not* pushing the hips forward. This isolates the bend in the spine and protects the lower back (lumbar spine). The feeling is one of lifting \"up and over an imaginary object.\"\n\n**3. Analyze the Balanchine Method Approach**\n*   **Emphasis:** The Balanchine method, developed by George Balanchine for his New York City Ballet, is a neo-classical style. It emphasizes speed, musicality, athleticism, and long, extended lines. The technique often pushes classical vocabulary to its extremes to create a distinct aesthetic.\n*   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   The goal is often to create a deeper, more visually dramatic curve than in classical techniques.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** To achieve this deeper arch, dancers are explicitly taught to **press the hips forward**. This action creates a counterbalance that allows the entire spine to arch more deeply and creates a distinctive \"broken\" line that is a hallmark of the Balanchine aesthetic. It is a fundamental technical difference from the Vaganova approach.\n\n**4. Compare the Two Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in how arms are held (*port de bras*) and extended (*allongé*) between the methods, this is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the mechanics of the backbend itself.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the key difference identified in our analysis. Vaganova requires stable, square hips, while Balanchine requires the hips to press forward. This directly impacts the shape, depth, and muscular engagement of the entire movement.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is generally faster and more dynamic, a *cambré* can be performed at various tempos in either technique, depending on the musical accompaniment and the purpose of the exercise. Speed is a general characteristic, not a defining technical difference of this specific step.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The greater degree of backbend often seen in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the technique, specifically the forward hip placement. The hip placement is the *cause*, while the degree of the bend is the *effect*. Therefore, \"Placement of hip\" is a more precise and fundamental answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the principle is for the head to follow the line of the spine naturally. While the final position of the head will differ because the spine's curve is different, the principle guiding its placement is the same. It is not the primary point of technical divergence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most significant and taught difference in the execution of a *cambré derrière* between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the use of the hips. Vaganova technique keeps the hips stable and stationary, while Balanchine technique utilizes a forward press of the hips to achieve a deeper arch.\n\n<<<B>>>"
