    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question focuses on the symbolic use of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in Anton Chekhov's short story, \"The Chameleon.\"\n\n2.  **Understand the Symbolism:** The premise of the question is correct. Otchumyelov's physical reaction to the heat or cold, which causes him to take his coat off or put it on, is not a literal weather change. Instead, it symbolizes his mental state:\n    *   **Taking the coat off:** He feels \"hot\" and flustered when he thinks the dog's owner is a person of high status (like General Zhigalov or his brother). This heat represents his fear, obsequiousness, and the sweat of trying to please a superior.\n    *   **Putting the coat on:** He feels a \"chill\" and puts his coat back on when he believes the dog is a stray or belongs to someone unimportant. The cold represents him reasserting his official authority and the formal, \"chilly\" application of the law to commoners.\n\n3.  **Trace the Events and Count the Mentions:** To find the number of times the coat is described, we must read through the story and track each instance where Otchumyelov interacts with it.\n\n    *   **Instance 1:** Otchumyelov hears from someone in the crowd that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov.\n        *   **Action:** He says, \"'Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!'\"\n        *   **Reason:** Fear of offending a powerful man.\n\n    *   **Instance 2:** The policeman, Yeldyrin, suggests that the dog is not the General's.\n        *   **Action:** Otchumyelov says, \"'Put my coat on, Yeldyrin, my lad... There's a wind getting up. I feel a bit shivery.'\"\n        *   **Reason:** He feels his authority return and can be cold and official again.\n\n    *   **Instance 3:** Another person in the crowd insists it *is* the General's dog.\n        *   **Action:** Otchumyelov orders, \"'Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin...'\"\n        *   **Reason:** The fear and subservience return instantly.\n\n    *   **Instance 4:** The General's cook, Prokhor, arrives and states that the dog is not theirs.\n        *   **Action:** Otchumyelov says, \"'Put on my coat, brother Yeldyrin.'\"\n        *   **Reason:** His official, chilly demeanor is restored.\n\n    *   **Instance 5:** Prokhor clarifies that the dog belongs not to the General, but to the General's brother who is visiting.\n        *   **Action:** Otchumyelov exclaims, \"'The General's brother!... take my coat off...'\"\n        *   **Reason:** The owner is still a very important person, so his servile \"heat\" returns.\n\n    *   **Instance 6:** At the very end of the story, as Otchumyelov walks away after siding with the powerful owner, the final description is given.\n        *   **Action:** He is described as \"...wrapping himself in his greatcoat, goes on his way across the market-place.\"\n        *   **Reason:** This final act signifies him settling back into his comfortable, self-satisfied authority, now that the \"correct\" social outcome has been achieved.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The count is not just about the words \"coat\" or \"overcoat,\" but specifically about the descriptions of Otchumyelov *taking it off, putting it on, or wrapping himself in it* as a direct result of a change in his opinion.\n*   The initial description of him wearing \"a new overcoat\" sets the scene but is not part of the back-and-forth symbolic actions. The question asks about the descriptions symbolizing his \"shifts\" in mentality.\n*   The count includes him taking the coat off (3 times), putting it on (2 times), and the final act of wrapping it around himself (1 time). Each of these six actions is a distinct description linked to a specific shift in the situation.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy tallying each of these distinct instances where Chekhov describes Otchumyelov's interaction with his coat to reflect his changing attitude, we arrive at a total of 6 times.\n\n<<<6>>>"
