    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's criteria.**\nThe question asks for a specific Hollywood feature film with four key elements:\n1.  **Produced by a major film studio:** This means the film should come from one of the big studios like Warner Bros., Universal, Disney, Paramount, Sony, etc., not an independent or foreign studio.\n2.  **Features a teenager:** The character at the center of the described action must be a teenager. This could also apply to a virtual avatar representing a teenager.\n3.  **Rides a pink bike:** This is a very specific visual cue. The bike's color is explicitly stated as pink.\n4.  **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car:** This describes a specific, dramatic, or comical action sequence involving a confrontation between the bike and a car.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm potential genres and films.**\nThe described scene has elements that could fit into several genres:\n*   **Teen Comedy/Coming-of-Age:** A scene like this could be a moment of quirky rebellion or a comedic gag.\n*   **Action/Sci-Fi:** The scene could be part of a larger, chaotic action sequence.\n*   **Horror:** A teenager confronting danger is a common trope in horror films.\n\nLet's evaluate some films known for featuring teenagers and bikes:\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982):** Features famous bike scenes, but none involve a pink bike being pedaled toward a car. The bikes fly *over* cars. (Studio: Universal - Major)\n*   ***It* (2017):** Features a group of teens on bikes who face danger, including a menacing car driven by a bully. However, none of the main characters' bikes are pink, and the specific action of defiantly pedaling head-on into a car does not occur in this manner. (Studio: New Line/Warner Bros. - Major)\n*   ***Napoleon Dynamite* (2004):** Napoleon rides a bike, but it's red, and he is not depicted riding it toward a car. (Studio: Fox Searchlight - Major subsidiary at the time)\n\n**Step 3: Focus on the specific visual of the \"pink bike\" and the action.**\nThe combination of a \"pink bike\" and pedaling \"toward an oncoming car\" is highly specific. Let's recall films with large-scale, chaotic scenes where such a moment might occur as a background detail or a quick gag. This brings to mind the opening race sequence in a major sci-fi blockbuster.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the correct film and verify the scene.**\nThe film that perfectly matches this description is **Ready Player One (2018)**.\n*   **Major Studio:** The film was directed by Steven Spielberg and produced and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment. This is a definitive major studio production.\n*   **Teenager:** The film's protagonist, Wade Watts, is a teenager. The scene in question takes place inside the OASIS virtual reality world, and the character on the bike is an avatar, most likely controlled by a child or teenager.\n*   **Pink Bike:** During the chaotic first race for the Copper Key, there is a very memorable shot of an avatar that looks like a young girl. She is riding a small pink children's bike, complete with a white basket and pink-and-white tassels on the handlebars.\n*   **Pedals toward an oncoming car:** As cars crash and burn around her, a red car careens directly toward this avatar. Instead of moving out of the way, she defiantly rings the bell on her handlebars and continues to pedal straight at the car before being comically obliterated in the collision.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll four criteria from the question are explicitly met in a memorable scene from the film *Ready Player One*.\n\n<<<Ready Player One>>>"
