    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (or shortening) is a phonological rule in the history of English. It caused a long vowel to become short when it was in the antepenultimate syllable (third syllable from the end) of a word. This process occurred in Middle English, before the Great Vowel Shift. A classic example is the vowel difference between `sane` /seɪn/ and `sanity` /ˈsænɪti/. The long vowel in `sane` (from Middle English /aː/) was shortened in the three-syllable word `sanity`, resulting in a short vowel.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Word Analysis**\n\nWe will examine each word and its related long-vowel counterpart to see if trisyllabic laxing applies.\n\n*   **southern:**\n    *   **Related word:** `south` (/saʊθ/). The diphthong /aʊ/ developed from the Middle English long vowel /uː/ during the Great Vowel Shift.\n    *   **Analysis:** In Middle English, the word was *sūtherne* (three syllables: sū-ther-ne). The long vowel /uː/ was in the antepenultimate syllable. According to the rule, this /uː/ was shortened to a short /u/ *before* the Great Vowel Shift. This short /u/ later developed into the modern /ʌ/ sound in `southern` (/ˈsʌðərn/).\n    *   **Conclusion:** `southern` **has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative:**\n    *   **Related word:** `derive` (/dɪˈraɪv/). The diphthong /aɪ/ developed from the Middle English long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word `derivative` has four syllables. The relevant vowel is in the second syllable, which is the antepenultimate (third from the end). The long /iː/ from the root `derive` was shortened to a short /i/ (pronounced /ɪ/ today) because it was followed by two syllables (-at-ive).\n    *   **Conclusion:** `derivative` **has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity:**\n    *   **Related word:** `serene` (/səˈriːn/). The long vowel /iː/ developed from the Middle English long vowel /ɛː/.\n    *   **Analysis:** In the four-syllable word `serenity` (/səˈrɛnəti/), the long vowel /ɛː/ from the root `serene` was shortened to a short /ɛ/ because it was in the antepenultimate syllable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** `serenity` **has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant:**\n    *   **Related word:** `please` (/pliːz/). The long vowel /iː/ developed from the Middle English long vowel /ɛː/.\n    *   **Analysis:** `Pleasant` (/ˈplɛzənt/) is a two-syllable word (`pleas-ant`). Trisyllabic laxing requires the word to have at least three syllables. The shortening of the vowel in `pleasant` is due to a different rule, known as pre-cluster shortening, where vowels were often shortened before a consonant cluster (here, /znt/).\n    *   **Conclusion:** `pleasant` **has not undergone** *trisyllabic* laxing because it does not meet the syllable count condition.\n\n*   **gratitude:**\n    *   **Related word:** `grateful` (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/). The diphthong /eɪ/ developed from the Middle English long vowel /aː/. (From Latin *grātus*).\n    *   **Analysis:** `Gratitude` (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/) is a three-syllable word. The long /aː/ in the first syllable was shortened to a short /a/ (which became modern /æ/) because it was followed by two syllables (-i-tude).\n    *   **Conclusion:** `gratitude` **has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow:**\n    *   **Related word:** `shade` (/ʃeɪd/). The diphthong /eɪ/ developed from the Middle English long vowel /aː/.\n    *   **Analysis:** This pair is deceiving. While they are related in meaning, `shade` and `shadow` come from different Old English words with different original vowel lengths. `Shade` comes from Old English *scād*, which had a long vowel. `Shadow` comes from Old English *sceadu*, which had a *short* vowel from the beginning. Since the vowel in `shadow` was never long, it could not have been shortened or \"laxed\".\n    *   **Conclusion:** `shadow` **has not undergone** trisyllabic laxing because it never had a long vowel to be laxed.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\n\nBoth `pleasant` and `shadow` did not undergo trisyllabic laxing. However, `shadow` is the better answer for a more fundamental reason. Its short vowel is not the result of *any* Middle English shortening process; it was inherited as short from Old English. The vowel in `pleasant` *was* shortened in Middle English, but by a different rule (pre-cluster shortening), not trisyllabic laxing. The word `shadow` entirely fails the prerequisite for the rule (having a long vowel), making it the clearest case of a word that has not undergone the process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
