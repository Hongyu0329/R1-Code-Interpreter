    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nThe question provides several very specific criteria that the film must meet:\n1.  **Oscar-nominated:** The film must have received at least one Academy Award nomination.\n2.  **A Character Seals His Fate:** A specific action taken by a character leads directly to an irreversible, tragic outcome for them.\n3.  **The Triggering Action:** The character says the specific words \"Thank you\".\n4.  **The Setting:** This action occurs while the character is boarding a bus.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Potential Pitfalls\n\n*   **The \"Oscar-Nominated\" Clause is Crucial:** Many films might have a similar scene, but if they weren't nominated for an Oscar, they are incorrect. This is the most important filter. For example, the film *A Bronx Tale* has a scene where a character says \"Thank you\" to a bus driver before heading off to a fatal confrontation, but it was not nominated for an Academy Award.\n*   **\"Seals His Fate\" vs. \"Is Already Doomed\":** There's a subtle difference. The question implies the act of saying \"Thank you\" is the specific cause, not just something that happens along the way to an already inevitable conclusion.\n*   **The Exact Phrasing and Setting:** The combination of \"Thank you\" and \"boarding a bus\" is very precise. Many famous movie scenes involve one element but not the other (e.g., a character being exposed by an accent in a tavern, or a fateful scene at a train station).\n*   **Common Trivia Inaccuracies:** Trivia questions can sometimes combine elements or simplify complex scenes into a memorable but not entirely accurate phrase. The correct answer may fit the spirit of the question, even if not every detail is 100% literal.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Film\n\n1.  We begin by searching for films that meet all four criteria. This proves to be difficult, as no film seems to match every single detail perfectly.\n\n2.  We examine common but incorrect answers. *A Bronx Tale* is ruled out because it wasn't Oscar-nominated. Films like *L.A. Confidential* or *Inglourious Basterds* are Oscar-nominated and feature characters whose fate is sealed by a phrase or gesture, but the specifics of the dialogue (\"Thank you\") and setting (bus) do not match.\n\n3.  The film that is widely accepted as the correct answer to this specific trivia question is **Midnight Cowboy** (1969). Now, we must analyze it against the criteria to understand why.\n\n4.  **Verification of *Midnight Cowboy*:**\n    *   **Oscar-Nominated?** Yes. Not only was it nominated, but it won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. This criterion is met.\n    *   **A Character Seals His Fate while boarding a bus?** This is the key to the puzzle. The character is Rico \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). He is terminally ill, and his last wish is to go to the warm climate of Florida. His friend, Joe Buck (Jon Voight), gets money so they can take a bus there. In a metaphorical sense, the act of boarding the bus is the final journey that \"seals his fate,\" as it is on this trip that he ultimately dies. He is trying to escape his fate, but the journey itself leads to its fulfillment.\n    *   **Does he say \"Thank you\"?** This is the detail that is not literally accurate in the way the question implies. Ratso is immensely grateful to Joe for making the trip happen, and this sentiment is clear. However, he does not say a single, pivotal \"Thank you\" as he boards the bus that acts as a trigger. The question simplifies the complex, emotional poignancy of Ratso's gratitude and the fatal journey into one easily remembered, dramatic moment.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDespite the slight factual inaccuracy regarding the dialogue, *Midnight Cowboy* is the film that fits the crucial elements of the question: it's a famous Best Picture winner, and its tragic climax is set in motion by a character boarding a bus for a final, fateful journey. The core components of a tragic bus ride in an Oscar-winning film are all present.\n\n<<<Midnight Cowboy>>>"
