    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Core Concept of Rule Activation**\nIn a fuzzy logic system, a rule has the general form \"IF [antecedent conditions] THEN [consequent action]\". For example, \"IF temperature is HIGH THEN fan speed is FAST\".\n1.  **Antecedent Evaluation:** First, we evaluate how well the current inputs (e.g., the measured temperature) match the antecedent conditions (e.g., the fuzzy set \"HIGH\"). This results in a numeric value called the **firing strength** or **firing level** of the rule. This value is typically between 0 and 1.\n2.  **Implication (Rule Activation):** Second, this firing strength is used to determine the output of that specific rule. This process is called implication or rule activation. It modifies the consequent fuzzy set (e.g., \"FAST\") based on the firing strength. The result of this step is the \"activated\" consequent set. The \"rule activation level\" at a specific point in the output domain is the membership value of that point in this newly activated set.\n\n**Step 2: Interpreting the Given Values**\n*   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`: This represents the firing strength of the `k`-th rule given the input `x'`. It tells us that the \"IF\" part of the rule is satisfied to a degree of 0.7.\n*   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: This represents the original membership degree of a specific output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j` (the \"THEN\" part of the rule). Before activation, `y_j` belongs to the consequent set to a degree of 0.9.\n*   **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set:** This is a very advanced type of fuzzy set designed to handle extreme levels of uncertainty. In such a system, both the firing strength and the consequent membership would not be simple numbers but complex sets themselves (specifically, interval type-2 fuzzy sets). However, the problem provides us with single, crisp numbers (0.7 and 0.9). This strongly implies that we are looking at a simplified representation or a specific snapshot (like a single vertical slice or a type-reduced value) of the complex system. For calculation purposes, we can treat these numbers as standard membership grades.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the T-norm Operation**\nThe problem specifies that the rule activation is calculated using a **t-norm operation**. A t-norm is a function that models a fuzzy logical AND. In the context of fuzzy rule implication (specifically, the widely-used Mamdani method), the activation level of the output is calculated by applying a t-norm to the rule's firing strength and the original consequent membership degree.\n*   `Activation Level = t-norm(Firing Strength, Consequent Membership)`\n*   `Activation Level = t-norm(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n\n**Step 4: Choosing the Specific T-norm**\nThere are several types of t-norms. The most common one, and the standard for Mamdani-style implication, is the **minimum (min)** operator. Other t-norms include the algebraic product (`a*b`) and the Lukasiewicz t-norm (`max(0, a+b-1)`). Since the problem doesn't specify which one to use, it is standard practice to assume the most common one.\n*   Using the `min` t-norm: `t-norm(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculation**\nWe now substitute the given values into the formula using the `min` t-norm.\n*   `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   The minimum of 0.7 and 0.9 is 0.7.\n*   `Activation Level = 0.7`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Complexity Abstraction:** The term \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\" indicates a highly complex underlying model. The key is to recognize that the problem has been simplified by providing crisp numeric inputs, allowing a direct application of the fundamental fuzzy operation.\n2.  **T-norm Assumption:** The choice of the `min` operator as the t-norm is an assumption based on common practice in fuzzy logic systems. If another t-norm (like product) was intended, the result would be different (`0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`). However, without further specification, `min` is the most logical choice.\n3.  **Mamdani Implication:** The entire process described (combining firing strength and consequent membership with a t-norm) is characteristic of the Mamdani implication method, which results in \"clipping\" the original consequent fuzzy set at the height of the firing strength.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe rule activation level is the result of the fuzzy implication, calculated as the t-norm of the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership. Using the standard `min` t-norm:\nActivation Level = `min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\nActivation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\nActivation Level = `0.7`\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
