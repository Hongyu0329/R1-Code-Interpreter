Yes, the exotic ammonia molecule would still exhibit tunneling. The fundamental cause of tunneling—the double-well potential energy surface—is determined by the masses and charges of the nuclei and the electronic structure, which are unchanged. The change in nuclear spin from fermion (spin 1/2) to boson (spin 0) affects the allowed rotational states via the Pauli exclusion principle. However, for both the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational states that constitute the tunneling doublet, there exist corresponding allowed rotational states that satisfy the overall symmetry requirements for bosons. Since both energy levels of the tunneling doublet can be populated, the energy splitting between them still exists, and thus the molecule will still tunnel.
