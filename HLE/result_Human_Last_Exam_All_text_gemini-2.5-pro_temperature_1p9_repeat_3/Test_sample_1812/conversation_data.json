    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe problem asks for the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix, which is identified as the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". The matrix is explicitly provided:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe core task is to calculate det(A). The contextual information about the \"Markov quiver\" and \"\\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" serves to name or identify the matrix but does not change the calculation, as the matrix is given in full.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n1.  **Focus on the Matrix:** The most critical information is the matrix A itself. The accompanying text, while mathematically relevant in a broader context, is not required for the direct computation of the determinant.\n2.  **Accuracy in Calculation:** Determinant calculations involve several arithmetic operations. Care must be taken with signs and multiplication, especially when using methods like cofactor expansion or Sarrus' rule.\n3.  **Look for Matrix Properties:** Before diving into calculation, it's often helpful to inspect the matrix for special properties. A key property here is that the matrix is singular, which immediately determines the value of its determinant. A matrix is singular if its rows or columns are linearly dependent.\n4.  **Verification:** Using more than one method to calculate the determinant is a good practice to ensure the result is correct.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis and Computation\n\nWe will compute the determinant of matrix A using several methods to verify the result.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Property of Linearly Dependent Columns/Rows**\n\n1.  Sum the elements of each row of the matrix A:\n    *   Row 1:  \\( 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Row 2:  \\( -1 + 2 + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Row 3:  \\( -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0 \\)\n2.  Since the sum of the elements in each row is zero, the column vectors are linearly dependent. Specifically, the sum of the column vectors is the zero vector:\n    \\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n3.  A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that a square matrix has a determinant of zero if and only if its column vectors (or row vectors) are linearly dependent.\n4.  Therefore, we can conclude without further calculation that det(A) = 0.\n\n**Method 2: Using Cofactor Expansion**\n\nLet's expand along the first row:\n\\[ \\det(A) = 2 \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} \\]\n1.  Calculate the determinants of the 2x2 minors:\n    *   \\( \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n    *   \\( \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n    *   \\( \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 3 \\)\n2.  Substitute these values back into the expansion formula:\n    \\[ \\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3) = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0 \\]\n\n**Method 3: Using Row Operations to achieve Triangular Form**\n\n1.  Start with matrix A:\n    \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n2.  Perform the row operations \\(R_2 \\to R_2 + \\frac{1}{2}R_1\\) and \\(R_3 \\to R_3 + \\frac{1}{2}R_1\\). These operations do not change the determinant.\n    \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 2 - \\frac{1}{2} & -1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0 & -1 - \\frac{1}{2} & 2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{3}{2} & -\\frac{3}{2} \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{3}{2} & \\frac{3}{2} \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n3.  Perform the row operation \\(R_3 \\to R_3 + R_2\\):\n    \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{3}{2} & -\\frac{3}{2} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n4.  The determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements.\n    \\[ \\det(A) = (2) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\times (0) = 0 \\]\n\nAll three methods confirm that the determinant of the matrix A is 0.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe determinant of the given matrix is calculated to be 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
