    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source Text:** William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n    *   **Subject:** A specific character.\n    *   **Character's Experience:** This character must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Character's Action:** The character describes Roman religious practices.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The description must contain a clear reference to the founding myth of Rome, involving Romulus and Remus and the she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters:**\n    *   The novel focuses on the Goths of the Mark, who are defending their lands from the Romans. Most characters have never been to a Roman city.\n    *   However, the text introduces a character who was captured by the Romans and lived among them as a slave (thrall) before returning to his people. This direct experience makes him the most likely person to have firsthand knowledge of Roman cities and customs. This character is Otter.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Scene:**\n    *   In Chapter III, \"The Thrall Otter Pleadeth for the Goths,\" the Wolfings are gathered in their great hall discussing the impending war with the Romans.\n    *   Otter, the returned thrall, is given permission to speak and share what he learned during his captivity.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Character's Description:**\n    *   Otter describes the vastness and might of the Roman city where he was held.\n    *   He then speaks of their beliefs and gods. He explicitly describes seeing a temple and an image related to their city's founding.\n    *   He tells the assembled Goths that the Romans tell a tale of their city being founded by two twin brethren.\n    *   He describes how these twins, as infants, were suckled by a she-wolf in the wilderness.\n    *   Crucially, he states that he has seen this story depicted in a \"brazen image of a she-wolf giving suck to two man-babes.\"\n\n5.  **Connect the Description to the Myth:**\n    *   The story of twin brothers (Romulus and Remus) being nursed by a she-wolf is the famous foundation myth of Rome.\n    *   The \"brazen image\" (bronze statue) Otter describes is a clear reference to the real-life Capitoline Wolf statue, a famous symbol of Rome.\n    *   Therefore, Otter's eyewitness account directly matches the details required by the question.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   It is important to distinguish Otter, who has *firsthand* experience as a former captive, from other characters who might only have secondhand knowledge or rumors about the Romans.\n*   The question specifically asks about *religious practices*. While the foundation story is mythological and historical, its commemoration in temples and with statues places it firmly within the realm of civic and religious belief for the ancient Romans, which is how Otter presents it.\n*   The reference is not subtle; Otter's description of the she-wolf and the two \"man-babes\" is an unmistakable allusion that any reader familiar with the Roman myth would immediately recognize.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the character who visited a Roman city and described their foundation myth involving a she-wolf and two twins is Otter, the thrall.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
