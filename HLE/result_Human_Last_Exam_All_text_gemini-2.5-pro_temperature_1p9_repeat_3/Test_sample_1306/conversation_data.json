    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the algebraic object and its context.**\nThe question concerns the representation theory of the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity.\nThis algebra is the \"small\" quantum group associated with $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$. It is generated by elements $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ subject to the relations:\n1.  $KEK^{-1} = q^2 E$\n2.  $KFK^{-1} = q^{-2} F$\n3.  $[E, F] = \\frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}$\n4.  And, because $q$ is a primitive 3rd root of unity (i.e., $\\ell=3$), we have the additional relations: $E^3 = 0$, $F^3 = 0$, and $K^3 = 1$.\n\nThese relations define $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ as a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra over the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$. Its dimension is $\\ell^3 = 3^3 = 27$.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the irreducible representations.**\nThe question asks about irreducible representations, which are also called simple objects in a category. For any finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field, there is a finite number of non-isomorphic simple modules.\nFor $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ with $q$ a primitive $\\ell$-th root of unity, the simple modules are well-known. They are highest weight modules, denoted $L(m)$, for $m = 0, 1, \\dots, \\ell-1$. The module $L(m)$ has dimension $m+1$.\nIn our case, $\\ell=3$, so the irreducible modules are:\n*   $L(0)$: A 1-dimensional module (the trivial representation).\n*   $L(1)$: A 2-dimensional module.\n*   $L(2)$: A 3-dimensional module.\n\nSo, there are exactly 3 non-isomorphic irreducible (simple) representations for this algebra.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the indecomposable representations.**\nThe question considers the category $C$ whose objects are all the finite-dimensional indecomposable representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$. We need to understand how many such non-isomorphic objects exist. This is determined by the *representation type* of the algebra.\nFinite-dimensional algebras are classified into three representation types:\n*   **Finite type**: There is a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\n*   **Tame type**: There are infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations, but for each dimension $d$, they can be classified. They fall into a finite number of discrete modules and a finite number of one-parameter families. Over an infinite field like $\\mathbb{C}$, a single one-parameter family contains infinitely many non-isomorphic modules.\n*   **Wild type**: The classification of indecomposable representations is as difficult as classifying representations of a free algebra on two generators, which is considered an unsolved problem. There are many multi-parameter families of indecomposable modules.\n\nIt is a standard and important result in the representation theory of quantum groups that for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at a primitive $\\ell$-th root of unity:\n*   The algebra is of finite representation type for $\\ell=1,2$.\n*   The algebra is of **tame representation type** for $\\ell=3,4$.\n*   The algebra is of wild representation type for $\\ell \\geq 5$.\n\nSince our case is $\\ell=3$, the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is of tame representation type.\n\n**Step 4: Count the objects and compute the percentage.**\n*   The number of irreducible objects in $C$ is the number of non-isomorphic simple modules, which we found to be 3.\n*   The total number of objects in $C$ is the number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules. Since the algebra is of tame representation type and the base field is $\\mathbb{C}$ (which is algebraically closed and infinite), there are infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable modules. These arise from one-parameter families of \"band modules\".\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of the objects of $C$ that are irreducible. This is the ratio:\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Number of irreducible objects in } C}{\\text{Total number of objects in } C} \\times 100\\% $$\nPlugging in the numbers we found:\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{3}{\\infty} \\times 100\\% $$\nThis ratio is 0.\n\n**Careful points and summary:**\n*   The use of $u_q$ points towards the small quantum group, which is a finite-dimensional algebra. This is crucial as it implies a finite number of irreducible representations.\n*   The key to the problem is identifying the representation type of the algebra. For $q$ a 3rd root of unity, this algebra is tame.\n*   \"Tame type\" over the infinite field $\\mathbb{C}$ implies infinitely many indecomposable representations.\n*   The question seems designed to test this specific piece of knowledge rather than requiring a detailed calculation. The term \"percentage\" might lead one to search for two finite numbers to compare, but the core of the problem lies in the finite vs. infinite nature of the sets of modules.\n\nFinal calculation gives a clear answer."
