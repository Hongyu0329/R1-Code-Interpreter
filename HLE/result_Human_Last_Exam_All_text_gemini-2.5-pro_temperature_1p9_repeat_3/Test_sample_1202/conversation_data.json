    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the primary mechanism that explains two outcomes for genes that have been duplicated in the genome:\n    *   **Retention:** How are both copies of the gene kept in the genome over evolutionary time, avoiding being lost or silenced? The default fate for a redundant gene copy is to accumulate mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene.\n    *   **Divergence:** How do the two copies become different from each other in sequence and/or function?\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Answer Choice:**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene copy is \"overwritten\" by another homologous copy, making them identical or more similar. This mechanism actively works *against* divergence. While it can maintain multiple identical copies of a gene (like rRNA genes), it does not explain how duplicate genes become different from each other. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a gene copy accumulates deleterious mutations (like stop codons or frameshifts) and becomes non-functional. This is the most common fate of a duplicated gene because one copy is initially redundant and free from purifying selection. While this represents a form of divergence (one functional, one non-functional), it is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not functional *retention*. The question asks for a mechanism that retains the duplicates.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, after a gene duplication event, one copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the second copy is free to accumulate mutations. By chance, one of these mutations may result in a new, beneficial function.\n        *   **Retention:** The original copy is retained by selection to perform its essential function. The new copy is retained by positive selection for its new beneficial function. So, both are kept.\n        *   **Divergence:** The sequence of the new copy must diverge from the original to acquire the new function.\n        *   This is a valid and important mechanism for both retention and divergence, explaining the evolution of novel gene functions.\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in multiple different tissues/times. After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that disable different sub-functions. For example, copy A loses function 1 but keeps function 2, while copy B keeps function 1 but loses function 2.\n        *   **Retention:** Both copies are now required to carry out the full set of original ancestral functions. Losing either copy would be detrimental. This creates selection pressure to keep both.\n        *   **Divergence:** The genes diverge as they accumulate different degenerative mutations and specialize in their retained sub-functions.\n        *   This is also a very strong and valid mechanism for both retention and divergence.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single lineage diversifies rapidly to fill many different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is a macroevolutionary outcome, not the specific molecular mechanism responsible for retaining individual genes. This answer choice operates at the wrong biological level.\n\n3.  **Compare the Strongest Candidates (C and D):**\n\n    *   Both neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are the key accepted models explaining the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks which is \"most likely\".\n    *   The evolution of a brand new, beneficial function (neofunctionalization) is generally considered a rare event. The gene copy must avoid becoming a pseudogene long enough for such a rare mutation to occur and be selected for.\n    *   Subfunctionalization, on the other hand, relies on loss-of-function mutations in different parts of the gene or its regulatory elements. Loss-of-function mutations are much more common than gain-of-function mutations. This model provides a passive, neutral pathway for preserving both gene copies. Because it depends on more frequent mutational events, many evolutionary biologists argue that subfunctionalization is a more common or \"likely\" initial mechanism for preserving duplicate genes from being lost. Once preserved by subfunctionalization, one of the copies might then later gain a new function (sub-neofunctionalization).\n    *   Given that subfunctionalization provides a more probable route to avoid the immediate risk of pseudogenization, it is often considered the \"most likely\" mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of many duplicate genes.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization are correct mechanisms for gene retention and divergence. However, Subfunctionalization relies on more common degenerative mutations to partition ancestral functions, providing a more probable pathway for preserving both copies from being lost to pseudogenization compared to the rare event of gaining a completely new function. Therefore, it is arguably the \"most likely\" mechanism, especially for the initial preservation phase.\n\n<<<D>>>"
