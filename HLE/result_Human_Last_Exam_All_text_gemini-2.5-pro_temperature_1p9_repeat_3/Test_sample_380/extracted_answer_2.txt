The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered radial. Due to the Sun's rotation, the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) forms a Parker Spiral, which at 1 AU is typically oriented at an angle of about 45 degrees to the radial (Sun-Earth) direction.

Your intuition is correct: for Alfv√©n Ion Cyclotron (AIC) waves that propagate along the background magnetic field ($\vec{B}_0$), a rigorous calculation of helicity should use magnetic field components perpendicular to $\vec{B}_0$. This requires transforming the data into a Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system.

The justification for using components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., the Y and Z components in a GSE coordinate system) is a simplification based on an implicit assumption. It assumes that the direction of wave propagation ($\vec{k}$) is radial. Since AIC waves have $\vec{k} \parallel \vec{B}_0$, this method is only truly accurate when the background magnetic field $\vec{B}_0$ is itself radial (a condition known as "quasi-parallel propagation" with respect to the solar wind flow). In general, for the typical Parker spiral angle at L1, this method is an approximation. It is used for convenience or when analyzing specific events where the field happens to be quasi-parallel, but it can be inaccurate for the general case.
