    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in its native writing system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core requirements of the question.**\nThe question asks for four specific things:\n1.  An **\"earliest known\"** date, meaning the oldest one discovered and verified so far.\n2.  A **\"recorded\"** date, which must be physically written down, not just inferred.\n3.  From a **\"pre-Columbian civilization\"** in the Americas.\n4.  Using an **\"aboriginal writing system\"**, such as hieroglyphs.\n\nThis requires us to look at artifacts with inscribed dates, specifically from civilizations that developed calendrical and writing systems, like the Maya, Zapotec, and Olmec/Epi-Olmec.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the relevant calendar system.**\nThe most precise dating system used in ancient Mesoamerica was the **Long Count calendar**. Unlike cyclical calendars (which repeat every 52 years), the Long Count marks the number of days elapsed since a mythical starting point, equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE. This system allows for the recording of absolute, non-repeating dates. We must therefore look for the artifact with the oldest Long Count date inscription.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the key contenders for the earliest recorded date.**\nSeveral important artifacts are candidates for the earliest recorded date. We can list them in chronological order from newest to oldest to find the earliest one.\n\n*   **Tikal Stela 29:** Found at the Maya city of Tikal, this monument has a Long Count date of **8.12.14.8.15**, which correlates to **July 6, 292 CE**. For a long time, this was considered one of the oldest Maya Long Count dates, but it is not the earliest in Mesoamerica.\n*   **La Mojarra Stela 1:** This large stone slab, inscribed with Epi-Olmec (or Isthmian) script, records two Long Count dates. The earlier one is **8.5.3.3.5**, corresponding to **May 21, 143 CE**. This is significantly earlier than the Tikal stela.\n*   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** An artifact attributed to the Olmec or Epi-Olmec culture. The monument has an inscribed Long Count date of **7.16.6.16.18**. This is a \"B'ak'tun 7\" date, making it much older than the \"B'ak'tun 8\" dates above. It correlates to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** A stela fragment discovered at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. It bears a partial inscription, but the readable portion clearly shows a Long Count date.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2.**\nThe date on this stela is recorded as **7.16.3.2.13**. To compare it with the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C (**7.16.6.16.18**), we read the Long Count numbers from left to right (largest time period to smallest):\n*   Both dates are in B'ak'tun **7**.\n*   Both are in K'atun **16**.\n*   The Chiapa de Corzo date is in Tun **3**, while the Tres Zapotes date is in Tun **6**.\nSince 3 is less than 6, the Chiapa de Corzo date is demonstrably earlier than the Tres Zapotes date.\n\n**Step 5: Convert the earliest date to our calendar and conclude.**\nThe Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13** on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is converted using the standard GMT (Goodman-Martínez-Thompson) correlation.\n*   **Date:** 7.16.3.2.13\n*   **Calendar Equivalent:** **December 7, 36 BCE** (in the proleptic Gregorian calendar).\n\nThis date from Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is currently the most widely accepted earliest recorded date found in the Americas.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Recorded vs. Inferred Dates:** This answer focuses on dates explicitly *written* on monuments. There are earlier dates for human activity based on archaeological methods like radiocarbon dating, but these are not dates *recorded by the people themselves*.\n*   **Full Date vs. Partial Date:** Some artifacts, like Monument 3 from San José Mogote (~600 BCE), have calendar glyphs, but they represent a day name (e.g., \"1 Earthquake\") within a 260-day cycle, not a full, absolute date like a Long Count inscription.\n*   **Scholarly Consensus:** The interpretation of the Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 fragment as the earliest Long Count date represents the current consensus among epigraphers and archaeologists specializing in Mesoamerica. This could change if an earlier inscribed artifact is discovered.\n\n<<<December 7, 36 BCE>>>"
