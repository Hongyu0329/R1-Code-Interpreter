    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum number of *different* clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n\nLet's break down the terminology:\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** A graph `G = (V, E)` where the number of vertices `|V|` is 128.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is a complete graph `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is the graph whose vertex set is `S` and whose edge set consists of all edges in `E` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **Clique size appears as an induced subgraph:** This means that for a given size `k`, there must exist a subset of `k` vertices, let's call it `S_k`, such that the subgraph induced by `S_k` is a complete graph `K_k`.\n*   **Maximum number of different clique sizes:** We need to find a single graph `G` that contains induced cliques of sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`. The goal is to maximize `m`, the number of distinct sizes.\n\n**2. The Key Insight: The Structure of Clique Sizes**\n\nThe crucial point is to understand the relationship between different induced clique sizes within a single graph.\n\n*   **Property:** If a graph `G` has an induced clique of size `k` (an induced `K_k`), it must also have an induced clique of size `j` for all positive integers `j < k`.\n*   **Proof:** Let `S` be a set of `k` vertices that induces a clique `K_k` in `G`. By definition, this means every pair of vertices in `S` is connected by an edge in `G`. Now, consider any size `j` where `1 ≤ j < k`. We can choose any subset `S'` of `S` that has `j` vertices. Since every pair of vertices in the larger set `S` is connected, it must be true that every pair of vertices in the smaller set `S'` is also connected. Therefore, the subgraph induced by `S'`, which is `G[S']`, is a complete graph of size `j`, i.e., `K_j`.\n\n**3. Reformulating the Problem**\n\nThis key insight significantly simplifies the problem. It tells us that the set of all possible induced clique sizes in any graph `G` is not an arbitrary collection of numbers but is always a continuous sequence of integers starting from 1.\n\n*   Let `ω(G)` be the **clique number** of `G`, which is defined as the size of the largest clique in `G`.\n*   From our insight, if the largest induced clique has size `ω(G)`, then the graph `G` must also have induced cliques of all sizes `1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)-1`.\n*   Therefore, the set of all different induced clique sizes for a graph `G` is exactly `{1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`.\n*   The number of different clique sizes is simply `ω(G)`.\n\nThe original question, \"determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes,\" is now equivalent to a simpler question: **\"What is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` on 128 vertices?\"**\n\n**4. Finding the Maximum Clique Number**\n\n*   **Upper Bound:** By definition, a clique is a subset of the vertices of the graph. Therefore, the size of any clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. For a graph `G` with `n=128` vertices, the clique number `ω(G)` must be less than or equal to 128. So, `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n*   **Attainability:** To show that 128 is the maximum possible value, we must demonstrate that there exists a graph on 128 vertices with a clique number of 128. The complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted `K_{128}`, is such a graph. In `K_{128}`, all 128 vertices are connected to each other, forming a single clique of size 128. Thus, `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices is 128. Since the number of different induced clique sizes is equal to the clique number, the maximum possible number of different induced clique sizes is also 128.\n\nThe graph that achieves this is the complete graph `K_{128}`. This graph has induced subgraphs isomorphic to `K_k` for all `k` from 1 to 128. The set of clique sizes is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, and the total number of different sizes is 128.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Induced vs. Subgraph:** The word \"induced\" is critical. If it were just \"subgraph\", the analysis would be identical because a clique `K_k` as a subgraph is always an induced subgraph on its vertices.\n*   **Simultaneously Appear:** This simply means all the clique sizes must be present in the same graph `G`. It does not imply that the vertex sets for these cliques must be disjoint. In fact, making them overlap (by nesting them) is the most efficient way to maximize the number of sizes.\n*   **Potential Pitfall:** A common mistake is to think you need to construct disjoint cliques, `K_{k_1}, K_{k_2}, ...`, and sum their vertex counts. For instance, to get sizes {1, 2, 3, ..., m}, this would require `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + m ≤ 128` vertices. This gives `m(m+1)/2 ≤ 128`, which leads to a maximum `m` of only 15. This is far from the optimal answer because it doesn't leverage the fact that a large clique contains all smaller clique sizes.\n\nFinal answer is the maximum possible value of `ω(G)` for a graph `G` with 128 vertices.\n\n<<<128>>>"
