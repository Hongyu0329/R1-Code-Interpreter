    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Subject Matter**: The question is about the poem `'Aqeedat al-'Awaam` (عقيدة العوام), which translates to \"The Creed of the Laymen.\" This is a famous and widely-studied introductory text in Islamic theology (`aqeedah`), written in poetic form (*manzūmah*) by Sayyid Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Marzuqi al-Maliki. A core part of Islamic creed is the belief in the Prophets and Messengers, and this poem dedicates a section to listing the 25 Prophets whose names are mentioned in the Qur'an and must be known by every Muslim.\n\n2.  **Locate the Relevant Section**: The poem is structured to cover different pillars of faith. After discussing the attributes of Allah, it moves on to the attributes of the Prophets. Following the general attributes, it lists the Prophets by name. We need to find the specific verses (called *bayt* in Arabic, plural *abyāt*) where this list begins and ends.\n\n3.  **Identify the Introductory Verse**: Before listing the names, the author states the obligation to know them. This happens in *bayt* 29:\n    *   **Verse 29:**\n        > وَتَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ\n        > كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *   **Translation**: \"The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding upon every legally responsible person, so ascertain this and benefit.\"\n    *   **Careful Point**: This verse introduces the list but does not contain any names itself. The question asks from which *bayt* the *names* are mentioned. Therefore, the list starts in the verse immediately following this one.\n\n4.  **Identify the Starting Verse of the List**: The first verse that actually begins the enumeration of the Prophets' names is *bayt* 30.\n    *   **Verse 30:**\n        > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ\n        > صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Translation**: \"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim; all are to be followed.\"\n    *   **Careful Point**: This is the definitive starting point of the list of names.\n\n5.  **Trace the Verses Containing the Names**: The list continues over the next few verses.\n    *   **Verse 31**:\n        > لُوْطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيْلُ إِسْحَاقٌ كَذَا\n        > يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\n    *   **Translation**: \"Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq as well, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed suit.\"\n    *   **Verse 32**:\n        > شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ\n        > ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Translation**: \"Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa, and Al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman who followed.\"\n\n6.  **Identify the Concluding Verse of the List**: The list of the 25 Prophets concludes in the next verse.\n    *   **Verse 33**:\n        > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n        > عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *   **Translation**: \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [a title for Prophet Muhammad], the final one, so leave misguidance.\"\n    *   **Careful Point**: This verse contains the final names in the list. The next verse (34) gives a general prayer for all of them (\"Upon them be peace and blessings...\") and does not continue the enumeration. Therefore, this is the end of the list.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion**: The enumeration of the names of the Prophets begins in *bayt* 30 and concludes in *bayt* 33. Therefore, the names are mentioned from *bayt* 30 to *bayt* 33.\n\n<<<From bayt 30 to bayt 33.>>>"
