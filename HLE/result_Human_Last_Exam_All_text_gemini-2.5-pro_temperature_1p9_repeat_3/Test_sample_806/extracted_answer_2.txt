The specific biochemical reaction that initiated the process was the direct, non-covalent binding of the causative drug molecule to a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecule, part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). This created a new molecular structure that was recognized as foreign by T-cell receptors, thereby triggering the activation of a T-cell-mediated immune response.
