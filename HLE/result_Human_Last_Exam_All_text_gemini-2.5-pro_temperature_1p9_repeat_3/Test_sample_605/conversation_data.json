    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n**1. Understand the Crawley-Nordström Invariant**\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant, `inv(X)`, for a quasi-smooth hypersurface `X` defined by a polynomial of degree `d` in a weighted projective space `P(w_1, ..., w_n)` is given by the formula:\n`inv(X) = (d^2 - Σ(w_i^2)) / (24 * d)`\nwhere:\n- `d` is the weighted homogeneous degree of the defining polynomial.\n- `w_i` are the weights of the variables `z_i`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Given Data**\n- **Defining Polynomial:** `F = z_1^8*z_3 + z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3 + z_1*z_2^7 + z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5 + z_2*z_3^4 + z_4^3*z_5 + z_5^3 = 0`\n- **Weights:** `(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step A: Determine the degree `d` of the polynomial.**\nFor a polynomial to be weighted homogeneous, every monomial must have the same weighted degree. The weighted degree of a monomial `z_1^a * z_2^b * ...` is `a*w_1 + b*w_2 + ...`. Let's calculate the degree for each term in `F`:\n*   `deg(z_1^8 * z_3)` = `8 * w_1 + 1 * w_3` = `8 * 22 + 49` = `176 + 49` = **225**\n*   `deg(z_1^4 * z_2^3 * z_3)` = `4 * w_1 + 3 * w_2 + 1 * w_3` = `4 * 22 + 3 * 29 + 49` = `88 + 87 + 49` = **224**\n*   `deg(z_1 * z_2^7)` = `1 * w_1 + 7 * w_2` = `1 * 22 + 7 * 29` = `22 + 203` = **225**\n*   `deg(z_1 * z_2 * z_3 * z_4 * z_5)` = `w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + w_4 + w_5` = `22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75` = **225**\n*   `deg(z_2 * z_3^4)` = `1 * w_2 + 4 * w_3` = `29 + 4 * 49` = `29 + 196` = **225**\n*   `deg(z_4^3 * z_5)` = `3 * w_4 + 1 * w_5` = `3 * 50 + 75` = `150 + 75` = **225**\n*   `deg(z_5^3)` = `3 * w_5` = `3 * 75` = **225**\n\n**Careful Point:** There is an inconsistency. One monomial has a degree of 224, while all others have a degree of 225. For the object to be a well-defined weighted homogeneous hypersurface, all terms must have the same degree. Given that six of the seven terms have degree 225, it is almost certain that the term `z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3` is a typo in the problem statement and the intended degree is `d = 225`.\n\nFurthermore, for a hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau, its degree must equal the sum of the weights (`d = Σw_i`). Let's check this condition:\n`Σw_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`\nSince `d = 225` matches `Σw_i`, this strongly confirms that the correct degree is `d = 225`.\n\n**Step B: Calculate `Σ(w_i^2)`**\nWe need to find the sum of the squares of the weights:\n*   `w_1^2 = 22^2 = 484`\n*   `w_2^2 = 29^2 = 841`\n*   `w_3^2 = 49^2 = 2401`\n*   `w_4^2 = 50^2 = 2500`\n*   `w_5^2 = 75^2 = 5625`\n\nNow, we sum these values:\n`Σ(w_i^2) = 484 + 841 + 2401 + 2500 + 5625 = 11851`\n\n**Step C: Calculate `d^2`**\nUsing `d = 225`:\n`d^2 = 225^2 = 50625`\n\n**Step D: Calculate the numerator of the invariant formula: `d^2 - Σ(w_i^2)`**\n`Numerator = 50625 - 11851 = 38774`\n\n**Step E: Calculate the denominator of the invariant formula: `24 * d`**\n`Denominator = 24 * 225 = 5400`\n\n**Step F: Calculate the final invariant and simplify**\n`inv(X) = Numerator / Denominator = 38774 / 5400`\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. Both are even, so we can divide by 2:\n`38774 / 2 = 19387`\n`5400 / 2 = 2700`\nThe fraction becomes `19387 / 2700`.\n\nTo check if it can be simplified further, we find the prime factors of the denominator: `2700 = 27 * 100 = 3^3 * 10^2 = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2`. The prime factors are 2, 3, and 5.\n*   `19387` is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).\n*   `19387` is not divisible by 5 (doesn't end in 0 or 5).\n*   To check for divisibility by 3, we sum its digits: `1 + 9 + 3 + 8 + 7 = 28`, which is not divisible by 3.\nTherefore, the fraction `19387 / 2700` is irreducible.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n*   `d = 225`\n*   `Σw_i^2 = 11851`\n*   `inv(X) = (225^2 - 11851) / (24 * 225)`\n*   `inv(X) = (50625 - 11851) / 5400`\n*   `inv(X) = 38774 / 5400`\n*   `inv(X) = 19387 / 2700`\n\n<<<19387/2700>>>"
