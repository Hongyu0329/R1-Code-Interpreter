    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\nThe question provides two key pieces of information, both attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n\n1.  **A Quote about the Novel:** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  **A Description of the Author:** He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\nWe need to find a single novel and its author that fit both of these descriptions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Author Description (\"a continuator and simplifier of Faulkner\")**\n\n*   **Who is Faulkner?** William Faulkner was an American Nobel laureate known for his complex narrative structures, non-linear timelines, stream-of-consciousness style, and the creation of a mythical, self-contained fictional county (Yoknapatawpha) in which many of his stories are set. His novels, such as *The Sound and the Fury* and *Absalom, Absalom!*, often tell multi-generational family sagas.\n*   **\"Continuator\":** This implies the author in question was heavily influenced by Faulkner and worked with similar themes and techniques: a multi-generational family saga, a strong sense of place that becomes almost a character in itself, and a non-linear approach to time and history.\n*   **\"Simplifier\":** This is the crucial part. While the author uses Faulknerian elements, their style is more direct and accessible. The prose is not as dense or syntactically labyrinthine as Faulkner's, making the complex story easier for a wider audience to follow.\n*   **Leading Candidate:** The author most famously described in these terms is **Gabriel García Márquez**. His creation of the fictional town of Macondo is directly parallel to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha, and his masterpiece, which follows the Buendía family for generations, is a classic example of a Faulknerian saga. However, García Márquez's prose, while rich, is generally clearer and more straightforward than Faulkner's, fitting the \"simplifier\" description perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Quote (\"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\")**\n\nThis is a poetic description of the novel's qualities.\n\n*   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This suggests raw power, vitality, primal energy, and a gripping, forceful narrative. It points to a story filled with epic events, strong passions, and a sense of life at its most vivid and untamed.\n*   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This suggests immense complexity, intricate structure, and strategic depth. Like a chess game, the plot would be full of calculated moves, recurring patterns, surprising turns, and a deep, underlying logic that governs the fates of the characters.\n*   **Connecting to the Candidate Novel:** **_One Hundred Years of Solitude_** by Gabriel García Márquez fits this description flawlessly.\n    *   Its \"intensity\" comes from the larger-than-life characters, civil wars, magical plagues, forbidden love affairs, and the sheer epic sweep of the story.\n    *   Its \"chess-like variety\" is found in its intricate, circular structure where names and personality traits repeat through generations, the complex web of family relationships, and the prophetic manuscript that structures the entire narrative with a sense of fatalistic precision.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Findings**\n\nBoth clues point decisively to the same author and novel. Borges's description of an author who continues Faulkner's project but makes it more accessible perfectly describes Gabriel García Márquez's relationship to his predecessor. The specific quote about the tiger's intensity and the chess duel's variety is a well-known piece of praise that Borges gave to García Márquez's monumental work.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Attribution:** It's important to verify that Borges actually said this. The quotes are widely attributed to him from his lectures and prefaces, confirming the validity of the question's premise.\n2.  **Both Clues Must Match:** The strength of the answer lies in how a single work satisfies both the stylistic comparison to Faulkner and the specific poetic description of the novel's effect.\n3.  **Understanding \"Simplifier\":** This term is not a criticism. Borges meant it as a high compliment—that the author managed to handle Faulkner's immense complexity with a clarity and grace that made it universally powerful.\n4.  **Novel vs. Author:** The question specifically asks for the novel. While identifying the author is a key step, the final answer must be the book's title.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe author Borges described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is Gabriel García Márquez. The novel he praised for having \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" is García Márquez's masterpiece.\n\n<<<One Hundred Years of Solitude>>>"
