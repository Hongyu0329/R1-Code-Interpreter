    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theologian in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** A Christian theologian.\n    *   **What did they do:** They were the *first* to develop \"specialized terminology.\"\n    *   **What does the terminology describe:** \"Changes in the laws of nature.\"\n    *   **What are the applications of this terminology:** It must be applicable to two specific and seemingly different events:\n        1.  The virgin birth of Jesus (a singular, positive miracle).\n        2.  Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall (a general, negative change in the created order).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Miracles vs. Natural Law:** The core of the question lies in the relationship between God's miraculous power and the ordinary, predictable functioning of the world (natural law).\n    *   **\"First to develop\":** This points to a foundational figure, likely one of the Church Fathers or a major scholastic theologian, not a modern one.\n    *   **\"Specialized Terminology\":** We are not just looking for someone who discussed the topic, but for someone who coined a specific philosophical or theological term to systematize the idea.\n    *   **The Fall's Impact on Nature:** The idea that the Fall of Adam and Eve had physical consequences for the entire created order (e.g., introducing death for animals, thorns, natural disasters) is a specific theological position. The terminology must be able to account for this.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates:**\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas:** A strong candidate who wrote extensively on miracles. He used the terminology of **Primary Cause (God) and Secondary Causes (natural laws)**. A miracle, for him, is when God (the Primary Cause) acts directly, bypassing the usual chain of Secondary Causes. While this terminology is excellent for describing miracles like the virgin birth, it is less suited to describing a permanent \"alteration\" in the laws of nature at the Fall. It describes God's intervention *in relation to* the laws, not a change *of* the laws themselves.\n    *   **John Calvin:** He wrote extensively on God's sovereignty and providence, affirming God's power to work miracles. However, he is less known for coining new metaphysical terminology to explain the mechanics of *how* God does this. His focus was more on God's absolute power and will.\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo:** This is the most promising candidate. He was a foundational theologian who deeply contemplated creation, providence, and miracles. He wanted to understand how God could bring forth new and miraculous things without violating the goodness and integrity of His original creation.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint Augustine's Specific Contribution:**\n    *   Augustine developed the doctrine of ***rationes seminales***, which translates to **\"seminal reasons,\" \"seed principles,\" or \"causal reasons.\"**\n    *   **The Core Idea:** He proposed that in the initial act of creation, God embedded all future possibilities into matter as latent potentialities, or \"seed principles.\" These principles are not active but can be brought into being at a later time by God's providence.\n    *   This creates a framework where the laws of nature are not static but contain hidden potentials.\n\n5.  **Apply Augustine's Terminology to the Question's Requirements:**\n    *   **The Virgin Birth:** According to Augustine's framework, the virgin birth was not God \"breaking\" the law of biology. Instead, God activated a special *ratio seminalis* that He had placed within creation (and specifically within Mary) from the very beginning. This event was contrary to the *usual course* of nature but not contrary to the deeper, God-ordained potential *within* nature.\n    *   **Alterations at the Fall:** Likewise, the negative changes in nature after the Fall (e.g., the ground producing \"thorns and thistles,\" the pain of childbirth) were not God creating new evil things. Rather, humanity's sin activated dormant, negative \"seminal reasons\" that God, in his foreknowledge, had permitted within the created order as a potential consequence of disobedience. This constitutes a \"change in the laws of nature\" as they are experienced, directly explained by his specialized terminology.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Augustine of Hippo was the first major theologian to develop this specific conceptual tool—the *rationes seminales*—which provides a unified way to describe both unique miracles like the virgin birth and systemic changes to the natural order like those associated with the Fall. It is a \"specialized terminology\" that addresses precisely the phenomena described in the question.\n\n***\n\nThe Christian theologian who first developed the specialized terminology of ***rationes seminales*** (\"seminal reasons\" or \"seed principles\") to describe how the laws of nature could be altered or contain latent possibilities, and applied this concept to explain both the virgin birth of Jesus and the physical changes in the world after the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
