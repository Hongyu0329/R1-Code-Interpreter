    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Arrhenius's Impossibility Theorems:** These are a set of theorems in population ethics that show it's impossible to find a method for ranking populations (an axiology) that satisfies several seemingly intuitive and desirable ethical conditions simultaneously.\n    *   **Critical-Level Views:** This is a family of population axiologies. They evaluate the value of a population by summing the welfare of individuals, but only the welfare that is above a certain positive \"critical level\" (`c`). The formula is: Value = Σ (uᵢ - c), where `uᵢ` is the utility (welfare) of person `i`. A key implication is that adding a new person is only considered a positive change if their welfare is above the critical level `c`.\n\n2.  **Examine Each Condition and How Critical-Level Views Relate to It:**\n    The goal is to find the condition that is *violated* by critical-level views. Let's assume a standard critical-level view where the critical level `c` is positive (`c > 0`).\n\n    *   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This principle states that if population A is perfectly equal and population B has the same number of people, and every person in A is better off than their counterpart in B, then A is better than B. Critical-level views satisfy this. The sum of `(u - c)` for population A will mathematically be higher than for population B.\n\n    *   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority & C. Non-Elitism:** These are very similar anti-elitist principles. They essentially state that a sufficiently large number of people with good lives can outweigh one person with an extremely good life. More formally, for any high welfare level `y`, there exists some positive welfare level `z` and a number of people `n` such that a population of `n` people at level `z` is better than a population of one person at level `y`.\n        *   Value of one person at `y` = `y - c`.\n        *   Value of `n` people at `z` = `n * (z - c)`.\n        *   Can we always find `z > 0` and `n` to make `n * (z - c) > y - c`? Yes. We can simply choose a `z` that is greater than the critical level `c`. Then `(z - c)` is positive, and we can make `n` as large as needed. Thus, critical-level views *satisfy* Non-Elitism and related priority conditions.\n\n    *   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This principle states that adding a person with negative welfare (a life not worth living, `u < 0`) makes the population worse.\n        *   When adding such a person, the change in value according to a critical-level view is `u - c`.\n        *   Since `u` is negative and `c` is positive, `u - c` is always a negative number.\n        *   Therefore, the value of the population decreases. Critical-level views *satisfy* Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n    *   **E. Weak Quality Addition (WQA):** This principle states that adding a person with a positive welfare level (a life worth living, `u > 0`) to an existing population makes the population better.\n        *   According to a critical-level view, the change in value from adding a person with welfare `u` is `u - c`.\n        *   The WQA principle requires this change to be positive for *any* `u > 0`.\n        *   However, consider a person whose life is worth living but below the critical level, for instance, `0 < u < c`.\n        *   In this case, the change in value `u - c` is *negative*.\n        *   This means the critical-level view judges that adding a person with a positive but low-quality life makes the world *worse*. This is a direct contradiction of the Weak Quality Addition principle.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCritical-level views are specifically designed in a way that violates Weak Quality Addition. This violation is the very mechanism by which they avoid other problems like the Repugnant Conclusion. Adding a person with a positive welfare level is not always considered an improvement; it is only an improvement if their welfare exceeds the critical level.\n\n<<<E>>>"
