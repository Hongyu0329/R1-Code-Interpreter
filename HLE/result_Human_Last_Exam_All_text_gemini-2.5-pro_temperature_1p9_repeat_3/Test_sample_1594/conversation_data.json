    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the letter formed by the school buildings.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Schools and Location:** The question asks about the combined shape of two specific high schools in Pisa, Italy: Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini. A quick search on a map service confirms they are located adjacent to each other on Via Benedetto Croce.\n\n2.  **Use an Aerial/Satellite View:** To see the shape the buildings form, it's necessary to look at them from directly above. Using a satellite view from a tool like Google Maps or Google Earth is the best approach.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Combined Footprint:**\n    *   When you locate the two schools on the map, you can see they are part of a very large, interconnected complex.\n    *   There is a long, primary building section that runs in a north-south direction. This forms the long vertical line, or the \"spine,\" of a letter.\n    *   At the northern end of this spine, a distinct wing of the building extends out to the east. This forms the top horizontal bar of the letter.\n    *   Further down, around the middle of the vertical spine, another wing extends out to the east. This forms a second, shorter horizontal bar.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on the Shape:** The combination of a long vertical spine with two horizontal bars extending to the right (east on the map) creates the unmistakable shape of the capital letter 'F'.\n\n**Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Combined Shape:** It is crucial to look at the footprint of the two schools combined as a single complex, not as two separate buildings.\n*   **Correct Schools:** Ensure you are looking at the correct institutes. The Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\" and the I.I.S. \"Galilei-Pacinotti\" are the correct ones.\n*   **Map Orientation:** The letter 'F' is clearly visible when viewing the map with North pointing up. The vertical stem runs North-South, and the horizontal arms point East.\n*   **Verification:** This is a well-known local fact in Pisa, and searching for \"Pisa schools form letter F\" confirms this observation.\n\nBy following these steps and observing the satellite imagery, the final answer is determined.\n\n<<<F>>>"
