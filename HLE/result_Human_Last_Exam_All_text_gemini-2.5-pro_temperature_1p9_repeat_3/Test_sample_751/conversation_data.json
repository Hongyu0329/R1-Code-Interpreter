    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form and find the new output matrix `C_o`.\n\n### **1. System Definition**\n\nThe given discrete-time system is:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith matrices:\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe state `x` is of dimension `n=3`. The output `y` is of dimension `p=2`.\n\n### **2. Principle of Duality and Observer Canonical Form**\n\nThe problem asks to use duality. The duality principle states that a system `(A, C)` is observable if and only if its dual system, `(A^T, C^T)`, is controllable.\nReducing a system to observer canonical form requires the system to be observable. The canonical form `(A_o, C_o)` will have a special structure where the new output matrix `C_o` is very sparse, and the new state matrix `A_o` is in a block companion form.\n\nThe transformation is achieved by finding a transformation matrix `P` such that the new state `z` is given by `z = Px`. The new system matrices are then `A_o = P A P^{-1}` and `C_o = C P^{-1}`.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Check for Observability**\nFirst, we must verify that the system is observable. We construct the observability matrix `O`:\n`O = [C; C*A; C*A^2; ...]`\n\nThe rows of `C` are `c_1 = [0, 1, 0]` and `c_2 = [1, 1, 0]`.\nNext, we calculate `C*A`:\n`C*A = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [[2, 1, 1], [3, 2, 1]]`\nThe rows of `C*A` are `c_1*A = [2, 1, 1]` and `c_2*A = [3, 2, 1]`.\n\nThe observability matrix is:\n`O = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [3, 2, 1]]`\n\nWe need to select `n=3` linearly independent rows from `O`. We choose them in a standard lexicographical order: `c_1, c_2, c_1*A, c_2*A, ...`\n1.  Row `c_1 = [0, 1, 0]`\n2.  Row `c_2 = [1, 1, 0]` (Linearly independent from `c_1`)\n3.  Row `c_1*A = [2, 1, 1]` (Let's check independence with the first two)\n\nWe form a matrix from these three rows to check its rank:\n`P = [c_1; c_2; c_1*A] = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]]`\n`det(P) = 0 * (1*1 - 0*1) - 1 * (1*1 - 0*2) + 0 * (...) = -1 * (1) = -1`\nSince the determinant is non-zero, these three rows are linearly independent, and the rank of `O` is 3. The system is observable.\n\n**Step 2: Construct the Transformation**\nThe matrix `P` formed from the selected linearly independent rows is the transformation matrix that defines the new state vector `z`:\n`z(k) = P * x(k)`\nThe new system matrices will be `A_o = P A P^{-1}` and `C_o = C P^{-1}`.\nThe problem only requires us to find the new matrix `C`, which is `C_o`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the New C Matrix (`C_o`)**\nTo calculate `C_o = C P^{-1}`, we first need to find the inverse of `P`.\n\n`P = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]]`, and `det(P) = -1`.\n\nThe inverse `P^{-1}` is given by `(1/det(P)) * adj(P)`.\nFirst, we find the matrix of cofactors:\n`Cof(P) = [[(1*1 - 0*1), -(1*1 - 0*2), (1*1 - 1*2)], [-(1*1 - 0*1), (0*1 - 0*2), -(0*1 - 1*2)], [(1*0 - 1*0), -(0*0 - 1*0), (0*1 - 1*1)]]`\n`Cof(P) = [[1, -1, -1], [-1, 0, 2], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nThe adjugate matrix `adj(P)` is the transpose of the cofactor matrix:\n`adj(P) = Cof(P)^T = [[1, -1, 0], [-1, 0, 0], [-1, 2, -1]]`\n\nNow, we find `P^{-1}`:\n`P^{-1} = (1/-1) * [[1, -1, 0], [-1, 0, 0], [-1, 2, -1]] = [[-1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, -2, 1]]`\n\nFinally, we calculate the new `C` matrix, `C_o`:\n`C_o = C * P^{-1} = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[-1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, -2, 1]]`\n\nLet's compute the product row by row:\nRow 1 of `C_o`: `[0*(-1)+1*1+0*1, 0*1+1*0+0*(-2), 0*0+1*0+0*1] = [1, 0, 0]`\nRow 2 of `C_o`: `[1*(-1)+1*1+0*1, 1*1+1*0+0*(-2), 1*0+1*0+0*1] = [0, 1, 0]`\n\nSo, the new matrix `C` is:\n`C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]`\n\n**Careful points and verification:**\n*   The observability of the system is a prerequisite for this transformation.\n*   The selection of linearly independent rows from the observability matrix determines the structure of the canonical form. The standard lexicographical choice (`c_1, c_2, c_1A, ...`) leads to this result.\n*   The new state vector `z = Px` is defined as `z = [c_1x; c_2x; c_1Ax]`.\n*   We know `y_1 = c_1x` and `y_2 = c_2x`. Therefore, `z_1 = y_1` and `z_2 = y_2`.\n*   The output equation in the new coordinates is `y = C_o z`.\n    *   `y_1 = C_{o11}z_1 + C_{o12}z_2 + C_{o13}z_3`. Since `y_1 = z_1`, the first row of `C_o` must be `[1, 0, 0]`.\n    *   `y_2 = C_{o21}z_1 + C_{o22}z_2 + C_{o23}z_3`. Since `y_2 = z_2`, the second row of `C_o` must be `[0, 1, 0]`.\n*   This logical derivation confirms the result of the matrix multiplication.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe value of the new matrix C is:\n`[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]`\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]>>>"
