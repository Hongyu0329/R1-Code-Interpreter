    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the generators and the group G\n\nThe group $G$ is generated by three permutations $a, b, c$ of the set $S = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$, which has 12 elements.\n\n*   $a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$ is a cycle of length 11. It fixes the element $z$.\n*   $b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$ is a product of two disjoint 4-cycles. It fixes the elements $2, 3, y, z$.\n*   $c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$ is a product of six disjoint transpositions. It has no fixed points.\n\nLet's determine if these permutations are even or odd. The sign of a k-cycle is $(-1)^{k-1}$.\n*   $a$ is an 11-cycle, so its sign is $(-1)^{11-1} = (-1)^{10} = 1$. It is an even permutation.\n*   $b$ is a product of two 4-cycles. A 4-cycle is odd ($(-1)^{4-1}=-1$). The product of two odd permutations is even. So, $b$ is an even permutation.\n*   $c$ is a product of six 2-cycles. A 2-cycle is odd. The product of six odd permutations is even. So, $c$ is an even permutation.\n\nSince all generators $a, b, c$ are even permutations, the group $G = \\langle a, b, c \\rangle$ is a subgroup of the alternating group on 12 elements, $A_{12}$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the properties of the group action of G\n\nWe check if the action of $G$ on the set $S$ is transitive.\nLet's find the orbit of the element 1.\n*   $a(1)=3, b(1)=8, c(1)=2$. So {1, 2, 3, 8} are in the same orbit.\n*   From 3, $c(3)=z$. So $z$ is in the orbit.\n*   From 2, $a(2)=5$. So 5 is in the orbit.\n*   From 8, $a(8)=y$ and $c(8)=4$. So $y$ and 4 are in the orbit.\n*   From 5, $b(5)=9$ and $c(5)=6$. So 9 and 6 are in the orbit.\n*   From $y$, $a(y)=x$. So $x$ is in the orbit.\n*   From 4, $a(4)=7$. So 7 is in the orbit.\nAt this point, we have shown that the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z\\}$ constitutes a single orbit under the action of $G$. Thus, $G$ is a transitive group on 12 points.\n\nNext, we check if $G$ is a primitive group. A transitive group $G$ on a set $\\Omega$ of size $n$ is primitive if it preserves no non-trivial partition of $\\Omega$. A key theorem states that a transitive group on $n$ elements that contains a prime cycle of length $n-1$ is primitive.\nIn our case, $G$ is a transitive group on $n=12$ elements. It contains the element $a$, which is a cycle of length $11$ on the subset $S \\setminus \\{z\\}$. A cycle of length $11$ is of prime length. Since $11 = 12-1$, the conditions of the theorem are met, and we can conclude that $G$ is a primitive group.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the possible isomorphism class of G\n\nWe have established that $G$ is a primitive subgroup of $A_{12}$ on 12 elements and contains a cycle of type $(11,1)$. The classification of such groups is a known result in finite group theory. The possibilities for such a group are:\n1.  $A_{12}$, the alternating group on 12 elements.\n2.  $M_{12}$, the Mathieu group on 12 elements.\n3.  $PSL(2, 11)$, the projective special linear group of dimension 2 over the field with 11 elements, in its natural action on the 12 points of the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{F}_{11})$.\n\nWhile it would be tedious to determine which of these groups $G$ is exactly, we may not need to.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Schur Multiplier of G\n\nThe Schur multiplier of a group $H$ is the second homology group $H_2(H, \\mathbb{Z})$. We need to find the Schur multiplier $A=M(G)$. Let's check the Schur multipliers for the possible groups identified in the previous step.\n1.  For the alternating group $A_n$, the Schur multiplier $M(A_n)$ is $C_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2) for all $n \\geq 4$, except for $n=6, 7$. For $n=12$, we have $M(A_{12}) \\cong C_2$.\n2.  For the sporadic simple group $M_{12}$, the Schur multiplier is known to be $M(M_{12}) \\cong C_2$.\n3.  For the group $PSL(2,q)$, the Schur multiplier for $q=11$ (which is a prime $\\geq 4$) is $M(PSL(2,11)) \\cong C_2$.\n\nIn all possible cases, the Schur multiplier of $G$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2.\nSo, we can conclude that $A \\cong C_2$.\n\n### Step 5: Count the proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism\n\nWe are asked to count the number of proper subgroups of $A$, up to isomorphism.\n*   The group is $A \\cong C_2$.\n*   The subgroups of $C_2$ are the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ (of order 1) and the group $C_2$ itself (of order 2).\n*   A proper subgroup is any subgroup that is not the group itself. For $A \\cong C_2$, the only proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n*   We need to count the number of these proper subgroups \"up to isomorphism\". The only proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup, which is isomorphic to the trivial group $C_1$. All trivial subgroups are isomorphic to each other.\n*   Therefore, there is only one isomorphism class of proper subgroups of $A$.\n\nThe number of proper subgroups of $A$ up to isomorphism is 1."
