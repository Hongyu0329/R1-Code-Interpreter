    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core elements of the question.**\nThe question has two key criteria that must be met by the film:\n1.  It must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n2.  It must show a \"Luxor Obelisk\" on screen.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the locations of the Luxor Obelisks.**\nIt is a common misconception that there is only one. There are two obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   One obelisk remains in its original location at the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The second obelisk, known as the \"Ob√©lisque de Louxor,\" was gifted to France in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\nTherefore, the film in question must feature scenes set in either Luxor, Egypt (showing the temple) or Paris (showing the Place de la Concorde).\n\n**Step 3: Chronologically review the list of Best Picture winners for relevant settings.**\nWe must examine the winners in order, starting from the first award in 1928, to find the *earliest* film that fits the criteria.\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:** Most winners are set in America (*Wings*, *The Broadway Melody*, *It Happened One Night*) or Europe, but not Paris or Luxor (*All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Grand Hotel*). A notable exception is *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), which is set in Paris. However, this film is primarily shot on interior sets and in studio backlots representing Parisian streets. It does not feature prominent on-location or establishing shots of landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n\n*   **1940s:** Winners from this decade include films set in England (*Mrs. Miniver*, *Hamlet*), Morocco (*Casablanca*), and America (*Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, *The Lost Weekend*). None of these feature either Paris or Luxor.\n\n*   **1950s:** This decade presents several strong candidates.\n    *   **An American in Paris (1951):** As the title suggests, this musical is set entirely in Paris and is famous for its visual celebration of the city. The celebrated 17-minute final ballet sequence is a dreamlike tour of Paris stylized in the manner of famous French painters. During this sequence, there is a clear and deliberate depiction of the Place de la Concorde, with its fountains and the Luxor Obelisk at its center. This is a confirmed sighting.\n    *   **Around the World in 80 Days (1956):** This film's globetrotting plot includes a stop in Paris. It features establishing shots of the city, including a view of the Place de la Concorde with the obelisk. However, since this film won five years after *An American in Paris*, it cannot be the first.\n    *   **Gigi (1958):** Another musical set in Paris, *Gigi* also contains numerous scenes filmed in the city, including shots that feature the Place de la Concorde. Again, this is later than *An American in Paris*.\n\n*   **Later Films:** Other Best Picture winners, like *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962), are set in the Middle East but do not feature Luxor. Films that do feature the obelisks prominently, such as *Death on the Nile* (1978), did not win the Best Picture award.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nBy reviewing the Best Picture winners chronologically, we can eliminate films until we find the first confirmed depiction.\n*   *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is set in Paris but lacks a clear on-screen depiction of the obelisk.\n*   *An American in Paris* (1951) definitively features a stylized but unmistakable depiction of the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde during its famous ballet sequence.\n\nTherefore, *An American in Paris* is the first Best Picture winner to meet both criteria.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
