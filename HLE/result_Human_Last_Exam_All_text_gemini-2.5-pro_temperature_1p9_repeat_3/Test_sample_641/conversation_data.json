    "An involution in a group is an element that is its own inverse, i.e., an element $g$ such that $g^2=1$. Typically, this term refers to elements of order 2, meaning $g \\neq 1$. We will calculate the number of elements of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Group and the Question**\n    The group is PSU(4, 997), the projective special unitary group of dimension 4 over the field with $997^2$ elements. We are looking for the number of elements $\\bar{A} \\in \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ such that $\\bar{A}^2 = I$ and $\\bar{A} \\neq I$, where $I$ denotes the identity element of the group.\n\n2.  **Relating Involutions in PSU to SU**\n    The group PSU(n, q) is defined as the quotient group $SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))$, where $SU(n, q)$ is the special unitary group and $Z$ is its center.\n    An element $\\bar{A} \\in \\text{PSU}(n, q)$ is an involution (including the identity) if $\\bar{A}^2=I$. If $A \\in SU(n, q)$ is a representative of the coset $\\bar{A}$, this condition means $A^2 \\in Z(SU(n,q))$.\n\n3.  **Determining the Center Z(SU(4, 997))**\n    The center of $SU(n,q)$ consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^n=1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$.\n    For PSU(4, 997), we have $n=4$ and $q=997$.\n    The center $Z$ consists of $\\lambda I$ where $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_{997^2}^*$ satisfies $\\lambda^4=1$ and $\\lambda^{997+1} = \\lambda^{998}=1$.\n    The order of the center is $|Z| = \\gcd(n, q+1) = \\gcd(4, 998)$.\n    Since $998 = 2 \\times 499$ (and 499 is prime), $\\gcd(4, 998)=2$.\n    So the center has two elements. These must be $I$ (for $\\lambda=1$) and $-I$ (for $\\lambda=-1$), as both $1$ and $-1$ satisfy the conditions: $1^4=1, 1^{998}=1$ and $(-1)^4=1, (-1)^{998}=1$.\n    Thus, $Z(SU(4, 997)) = \\{I, -I\\}$.\n\n4.  **Finding Pre-images in SU(4, 997)**\n    We need to count the elements $A \\in SU(4, 997)$ such that $A^2=I$ or $A^2=-I$.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the equation $A^2 = -I$**\n    Let $A$ be an element of the unitary group $U(4,q)$. If $v$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$, then $A^2v = \\lambda^2v$. So if $A^2=-I$, eigenvalues must satisfy $\\lambda^2=-1$. Let's call such eigenvalues $\\pm i$.\n    A crucial point is whether $-1$ is a square in the base field $\\mathbb{F}_q = \\mathbb{F}_{997}$.\n    The Legendre symbol $(\\frac{-1}{p})$ is $1$ if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and $-1$ if $p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\n    Here, $q=997$. Since $997 = 4 \\times 249 + 1$, we have $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. This means $-1$ is a square in $\\mathbb{F}_{997}$. So, the eigenvalues $\\pm i$ are in $\\mathbb{F}_{997}$.\n    For any matrix $A$ in $U(n,q)$ and its eigenvalue $\\lambda$ with corresponding eigenvector $v$, we must have $(\\lambda\\lambda^q-1)H(v,v)=0$, where $H$ is the Hermitian form.\n    If $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_q$, then $\\lambda^q=\\lambda$. The condition becomes $(\\lambda^2-1)H(v,v)=0$.\n    For our eigenvalues $\\lambda = \\pm i$, we have $\\lambda^2=-1$. The condition is $(-1-1)H(v,v) = -2H(v,v)=0$. As the characteristic of the field is $997 \\neq 2$, this implies $H(v,v)=0$.\n    This means every eigenvector of $A$ must be isotropic. Since $A$ is diagonalizable, the entire space $V=(\\mathbb{F}_{q^2})^4$ is a direct sum of its eigenspaces, $V=V_i \\oplus V_{-i}$. It can be shown that these eigenspaces are totally isotropic, which contradicts the non-degeneracy of the Hermitian form $H$ on $V$.\n    Therefore, there are no elements $A$ in $U(4, 997)$ such that $A^2=-I$. Consequently, there are no such elements in $SU(4, 997)$.\n\n6.  **Counting Involutions in SU(4, 997)**\n    We are left with counting the elements $A \\in SU(4, 997)$ such that $A^2=I$. These are precisely the involutions of $SU(4, 997)$. Let $S_1$ be this set.\n    An involution in $U(4,q)$ is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. It is uniquely determined by its (-1)-eigenspace $W$, which must be a non-degenerate subspace of $V$. The involution acts as $I$ on $W^\\perp$ and $-I$ on $W$.\n    The determinant of such an involution is $(-1)^{\\dim(W)}$. For the involution to be in $SU(4,q)$, its determinant must be 1, so $\\dim(W)$ must be an even number.\n    The possible dimensions for $W$ are $k=0, 2, 4$.\n    The number of non-degenerate subspaces of dimension $k$ in an $n$-dimensional unitary space is given by $\\frac{|U(n,q)|}{|U(k,q)||U(n-k,q)|}$.\n    -   For $k=0$, the subspace is $\\{0\\}$. This corresponds to the identity matrix $I$. Number of such subspaces = 1.\n    -   For $k=4$, the subspace is the whole space $V$. This corresponds to the matrix $-I$. Number of such subspaces = 1.\n    -   For $k=2$, the number of subspaces is $\\frac{|U(4,q)|}{|U(2,q)||U(2,q)|}$.\n        Using the formula $|U(m,q)| = q^{m(m-1)/2}\\prod_{j=1}^m(q^j-(-1)^j)$, we have:\n        $|U(2,q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)$\n        $|U(4,q)| = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$\n        Number of subspaces for $k=2$ is $\\frac{q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{[q(q+1)(q^2-1)]^2} = \\frac{q^4(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n    The total number of involutions (order 1 or 2) in $SU(4,q)$ is $|S_1| = 1 + 1 + q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) = 2 + q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n7.  **Counting Involutions in PSU(4, 997)**\n    The elements in PSU(4,q) are cosets of the center $Z=\\{I, -I\\}$. The projection map $\\pi: SU \\to PSU$ sends an element $A$ to its coset $\\bar{A}=AZ$.\n    The set of elements $\\bar{A}$ in PSU satisfying $\\bar{A}^2=I$ is the image of $S_1$ under $\\pi$.\n    We need to find $|\\pi(S_1)|$.\n    Two elements $A,B \\in S_1$ map to the same coset if $B=A$ or $B=-A$.\n    For any $A \\in S_1$, we have $A^2=I$. Then $(-A)^2 = A^2 = I$, so $-A$ is also in $S_1$.\n    Since the characteristic is not 2, $A \\neq -A$. This means the elements of $S_1$ can be partitioned into pairs of the form $\\{A, -A\\}$.\n    The map $\\pi$ sends each such pair to a single element in PSU.\n    The total number of elements in PSU(4,q) of order 1 or 2 is $|S_1|/2 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n    This count includes the identity element of PSU(4,q), which corresponds to the pair $\\{I, -I\\}$ from $SU(4,q)$.\n    To find the number of involutions of order 2, we subtract 1 (for the identity).\n    Number of involutions (order 2) = $\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)\\right) - 1 = \\frac{1}{2}q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**\n    We just need to provide this formula with $q=997$. A numerical evaluation would result in a very large number.\n    Number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is $\\frac{1}{2}(997)^4((997)^2-997+1)((997)^2+1)$.\n    Let's check that the expression is an integer. $q=997$ is odd, so $q^2$ is odd. Then $q^2+1$ is even, so it's divisible by 2. The formula gives an integer.\n\nThe number of involutions (elements of order 2) in PSU(4, 997) is given by the formula:\n$\\frac{1}{2}q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)$, where $q=997$.\n\n<<<1/2 * 997^4 * (997^2+1) * (997^2-997+1)>>>"
