    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the name of a specific \"book of manners\" that was \"preserved alongside\" the poem \"Sir Launfal.\" The phrase \"preserved alongside\" is a key indicator that we are looking for two texts that appear together in the same historical document, most likely a manuscript.\n\n2.  **Identify \"Sir Launfal\":** The poem in question is the Middle English romance *Sir Launfal*, generally attributed to the late 14th-century poet Thomas Chestre. It's crucial not to confuse this with the much later 19th-century poem, *The Vision of Sir Launfal* by James Russell Lowell, as the context of manuscript preservation points directly to the medieval text.\n\n3.  **Locate the Manuscript:** The poem *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre is preserved in a single, important manuscript: **MS Cotton Caligula A.ii**, which is now held in the British Library. This manuscript is an anthology, meaning it is a collection of various works bound together in one volume.\n\n4.  **Examine the Manuscript's Contents:** To find the book of manners, we need to know what other texts are included in MS Cotton Caligula A.ii alongside *Sir Launfal*. The manuscript contains a mix of romances, lays, and didactic (instructional) literature.\n\n5.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\":** A \"book of manners,\" also known as a courtesy book, is a type of instructional text that teaches social etiquette, proper behavior, and morals. Looking through the contents of MS Cotton Caligula A.ii, we find a short didactic poem that fits this description perfectly.\n\n6.  **Name the Book:** This text is titled ***The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke*** (modern English: \"The Little Children's Little Book\"). This poem is a classic example of a courtesy book, providing instructions for children on how to behave properly, especially at the table and in the presence of their social superiors.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Manuscript Context:** The core of the question lies in understanding that \"preserved alongside\" refers to co-occurrence within a single manuscript codex.\n*   **Anthology Nature:** Realize that medieval manuscripts were often compilations of different, unrelated works that a scribe or patron chose to include together.\n*   **Genre Identification:** It is necessary to correctly identify *The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke* as belonging to the genre of \"book of manners\" or \"courtesy book.\" Its title and content make this clear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy tracing *Sir Launfal* to its sole manuscript source, MS Cotton Caligula A.ii, and then examining the other contents of that manuscript, we can identify the specific book of manners that was preserved with it.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke>>>"
