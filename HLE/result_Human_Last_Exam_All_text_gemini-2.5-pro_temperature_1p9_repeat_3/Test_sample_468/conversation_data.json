    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the common name for the genus *Perdita* and its origin date.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Currently Used Common Name\n\nThe first task is to find the common name for the genus *Perdita* that is currently used within its native range (North and Central America, primarily).\n\n1.  **Consult General Entomological Resources:** Popular and academic resources are checked.\n    *   The book \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" (2016) by Wilson & Carril, a standard guide for North American bees, explicitly states, \"Often called fairy bees, most Perdita are small enough to sit on the head of a pin.\"\n    *   BugGuide.net, a widely respected online resource for North American insects maintained by entomologists, lists the primary common name for the genus *Perdita* as \"Fairy Bees.\"\n    *   The definitive academic text \"The Bees of the World\" (2nd Ed., 2007) by Charles D. Michener notes that members of the genus *Perdita* are \"sometimes called 'fairy bees'.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze Other Potential Names:** Other names like \"sand bees\" or \"dwarf bees\" are sometimes associated with them. However, \"sand bees\" is a very general term that also applies to many other ground-nesting bees (like the genus *Andrena*). \"Dwarf bees\" is descriptive but less specific and less commonly used than \"Fairy bees.\"\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Common Name:** Based on its widespread use in both popular and scientific literature, **Fairy bees** is the most accurate and currently used common name. The name aptly describes their extremely small size and often iridescent, delicate appearance.\n\n### Step 2: Determine When the Name Was Coined\n\nThe second task is to find the year the name \"Fairy bees\" was coined. For common names, a formal \"coining\" event is rare and often undocumented. The most reliable approach is to find the earliest known date of its publication.\n\n1.  **Search for an Origin Point:** A search through scientific literature is conducted to find the first published use of the term \"fairy bees\" in reference to *Perdita*.\n2.  **Check Key Literature:** Major works on the genus, such as P.H. Timberlake's extensive revisions from the 1950s, do not appear to use this common name, suggesting it either came into use later or was considered an informal term not suitable for those specific monographs.\n3.  **Identify Early Publications:** A systematic search of digital archives of entomological literature (like the Biodiversity Heritage Library) is performed.\n    *   An initial finding points to a 1965 paper by J.G. Rozen, Jr. in *American Museum Novitates*, which refers to them by \"their common name -- 'the fairy bees',\" indicating the name was already established by then.\n    *   An earlier reference was found. In the April 1961 issue of *The Kansas School Naturalist* (Vol. 7, No. 4), in an article titled \"Bees of Kansas,\" the authors (including the world-renowned bee expert Charles D. Michener) write: \"Among our prettiest bees are the little species of *Perdita*... These are our smallest bees, and are often called **fairy bees**.\"\n4.  **Conclusion on Date:** This 1961 publication is a clear, authoritative, and documented use of the name. While the name may have been used colloquially before this date, 1961 is the earliest verifiable year it appeared in a publication. Therefore, it serves as the best answer for when the name was established in the public and scientific-educational record.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Common Name:** Fairy bees\n*   **Year of First Known Publication:** 1961\n\nThe final answer is constructed by combining these two elements in the requested format.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1961>>>"
