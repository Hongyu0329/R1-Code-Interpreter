    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the specific paper in question.**\nThe question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. This is one of his four groundbreaking \"Annus Mirabilis\" papers. The formal title of the paper is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n**Step 2: Understand what \"cite\" means in the context of early 20th-century physics papers.**\nUnlike modern papers with formal, numbered reference lists, citations in that era were often integrated directly into the text, acknowledging the work or ideas of others. The question specifically asks about \"lectures,\" which is a very precise detail.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the content of the paper for citations.**\nThe paper's core contribution was to demonstrate a way to predict the random motion of particles (like pollen in water) and, by doing so, provide a method to determine the size of atoms and Avogadro's number. To do this, Einstein built upon the foundations of statistical mechanics.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the specific mention of lectures.**\nWithin the paper, when Einstein derives the expression for osmotic pressure of suspended particles, he draws an analogy to the pressure exerted by gas molecules. In this section, he explicitly acknowledges the influence of another physicist's lectures. He notes that his method for deriving the diffusion equation is very similar to the approach used by this physicist in his treatment of the kinetic theory of gases.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the person whose lectures were cited.**\nThe physicist Einstein cited in this context was **Ludwig Boltzmann**. Einstein specifically mentioned that his derivation of the relationship involving osmotic pressure followed a method similar to one presented by Boltzmann in his lectures on gas theory.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **The Specificity of \"Lectures\":** The question is not about general influences but a direct citation of *lectures*. While Boltzmann had published his lectures as a book series titled *Vorlesungen über Gastheorie* (Lectures on Gas Theory), Einstein's reference points to the didactic approach presented in them.\n*   **The Context of the Citation:** Einstein was not citing Boltzmann for the discovery or theory of Brownian motion itself. Instead, he was crediting Boltzmann for a methodological approach from statistical mechanics (specifically, gas theory) that he was adapting and applying to the problem of suspended particles in a liquid.\n*   **Significance:** This citation is significant because it connects Einstein's work directly to Boltzmann's, who was a principal architect of statistical mechanics. Einstein's paper provided powerful evidence for the molecular-kinetic theory that Boltzmann had championed, validating the real existence of atoms and molecules at a time when they were still debated.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the answer is clear.\n\n***\n\nIn his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of **Ludwig Boltzmann**.\n\nSpecifically, when discussing osmotic pressure, Einstein noted that his method of derivation was very similar to the one used by Boltzmann in his lectures on the kinetic theory of gases.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
