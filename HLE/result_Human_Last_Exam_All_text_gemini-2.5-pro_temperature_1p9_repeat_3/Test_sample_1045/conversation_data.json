    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Molecule\nThe molecule is toluene, which has the chemical formula C7H8.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Basis Set Notation (6-31G)\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. We need to understand what this notation means for each type of atom in the molecule.\n\n*   **The hyphen (`-`)** separates the description of the core orbitals from the valence orbitals.\n*   **The first number (`6`)** describes the core orbitals. It means each core atomic orbital is represented by a single **contracted Gaussian function (CGF)**, which is a linear combination of 6 **primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs)**.\n*   **The numbers after the hyphen (`31`)** describe the valence orbitals. This means the valence shell is \"split\" into two basis functions per atomic orbital.\n    *   The first number (`3`) means the \"inner\" part of the valence shell is described by one CGF made from 3 PGFs.\n    *   The second number (`1`) means the \"outer\" part of the valence shell is described by one CGF made from 1 PGF.\n*   **The letter `G`** stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Number of Contracted Functions per Carbon Atom (C)\nA carbon atom (atomic number 6) has the electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p².\n*   **Core Orbitals:** The 1s orbital is the core orbital. According to the `6-` part of the basis set name, the 1s orbital is represented by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence Orbitals:** The 2s and 2p orbitals are the valence orbitals. According to the `-31G` part, they are split into two sets of functions.\n    *   **Inner Valence (described by the `3`):** This set consists of one 2s-type CGF and three 2p-type CGFs (for px, py, and pz). This gives a total of 1 + 3 = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (described by the `1`):** This set also consists of one 2s-type CGF and three 2p-type CGFs (px, py, pz). This gives another 1 + 3 = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Number of Contracted Functions per Hydrogen Atom (H)\nA hydrogen atom (atomic number 1) has the electron configuration 1s¹.\n*   **Core Orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons. The 1s electron is a valence electron. Therefore, only the valence description (`-31G`) applies.\n*   **Valence Orbitals:** The 1s orbital is split into two functions.\n    *   **Inner Valence (described by the `3`):** This consists of one 1s-type CGF. This is **1 CGF**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (described by the `1`):** This consists of another 1s-type CGF. This is **1 CGF**.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence) = **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Contracted Functions for Toluene (C7H8)\nNow, we sum the contributions from all atoms in the molecule.\n\n*   **Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms:**\n    7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs\n*   **Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms:**\n    8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs\n*   **Total number of contracted Gaussian functions:**\n    63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = 79 CGFs\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, a 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene (C7H8) uses a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
