    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Rational Number:** The first step is to find the continued fraction expansion of the given rational number, $4/7$. We use the Euclidean algorithm for this.\n    *   $4/7 = 0 + \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/4}$\n    *   $7/4 = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = 1 + \\frac{1}{4/3}$\n    *   $4/3 = 1 + \\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   $1/3 = \\frac{1}{3}$\n    *   Combining these, we get $4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]$. Let's denote the coefficients as $c_1=1, c_2=1, c_3=3$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Associated Quadratic Irrational:** The context of \"generalized Markov numbers\" suggests we should look into the theory of the Markov and Lagrange spectra. In this field, a common way to associate an irrational number to a rational number $p/q = [0; c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n]$ is to construct a new continued fraction with a periodic part based on the coefficients of the rational's own continued fraction. One standard construction, attributed to Cusick, is:\n    \\[ \\alpha_{p/q} = [0; c_1, \\ldots, c_{n-1}, \\overline{c_n, c_{n-1}, \\ldots, c_1}] \\]\n    For $4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]$, this construction yields:\n    \\[ \\alpha_{4/7} = [0; 1, 1, \\overline{3, 1, 1}] \\]\n\n3.  **Compute the Value of the Constructed Irrational Number:** To find the continued fraction in its standard form, we first need to compute the algebraic value of $\\alpha_{4/7}$.\n    *   First, let's find the value of the periodic part, $y = [\\overline{3, 1, 1}]$. This notation means $y = [3; 1, 1, y]$.\n    *   We can write this as an equation:\n        \\[ y = 3 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + 1/y}} = 3 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{y}{y+1}} = 3 + \\frac{y+1}{y+1+y} = 3 + \\frac{y+1}{2y+1} \\]\n    *   Now, we solve for $y$:\n        \\[ y(2y+1) = 3(2y+1) + (y+1) \\]\n        \\[ 2y^2 + y = 6y + 3 + y + 1 \\]\n        \\[ 2y^2 - 6y - 4 = 0 \\]\n        \\[ y^2 - 3y - 2 = 0 \\]\n    *   Using the quadratic formula, $y = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}$. Since $y$ must be positive (as its continued fraction starts with 3), we take the positive root: $y = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{17}}{2}$.\n    *   Now we substitute this back into the expression for $\\alpha_{4/7} = [0; 1, 1, y]$:\n        \\[ \\alpha_{4/7} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + 1/y}} = \\frac{y+1}{2y+1} \\]\n    *   Substituting the value of $y$:\n        \\[ \\alpha_{4/7} = \\frac{\\frac{3+\\sqrt{17}}{2} + 1}{2(\\frac{3+\\sqrt{17}}{2}) + 1} = \\frac{\\frac{5+\\sqrt{17}}{2}}{3+\\sqrt{17}+1} = \\frac{5+\\sqrt{17}}{2(4+\\sqrt{17})} \\]\n    *   To simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $(4-\\sqrt{17})$:\n        \\[ \\alpha_{4/7} = \\frac{(5+\\sqrt{17})(4-\\sqrt{17})}{2(4+\\sqrt{17})(4-\\sqrt{17})} = \\frac{20 - 5\\sqrt{17} + 4\\sqrt{17} - 17}{2(16 - 17)} = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{17}}{-2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17} - 3}{2} \\]\n\n4.  **Compute the Standard Continued Fraction:** The final step is to find the standard continued fraction representation of the number $\\frac{\\sqrt{17} - 3}{2}$. We apply the standard algorithm.\n    *   Let $x_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{17} - 3}{2}$. Since $4 < \\sqrt{17} < 5$, we have $\\frac{4-3}{2} < x_0 < \\frac{5-3}{2}$, so $0.5 < x_0 < 1$. Thus, the integer part is $a_0 = 0$.\n    *   $x_1 = \\frac{1}{x_0} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{17} - 3} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{17}+3)}{17-9} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{17}+3)}{8} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}+3}{4}$. The integer part is $a_1 = \\lfloor \\frac{4.123+3}{4} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1.78 \\rfloor = 1$.\n    *   $x_2 = \\frac{1}{x_1-1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{17}+3}{4}-1} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}-1} = \\frac{4(\\sqrt{17}+1)}{16} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}+1}{4}$. The integer part is $a_2 = \\lfloor \\frac{4.123+1}{4} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 1.28 \\rfloor = 1$.\n    *   $x_3 = \\frac{1}{x_2-1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{17}+1}{4}-1} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}-3} = \\frac{4(\\sqrt{17}+3)}{8} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}+3}{2}$. The integer part is $a_3 = \\lfloor \\frac{4.123+3}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor 3.56 \\rfloor = 3$.\n    *   $x_4 = \\frac{1}{x_3-3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{17}+3}{2}-3} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{17}-3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}+3}{4}$. This is equal to $x_1$.\n    *   Since $x_4=x_1$, the sequence of partial quotients will repeat from $a_1$. The sequence is $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots$.\n\nThe resulting continued fraction is $[0; \\overline{1,1,3}]$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The primary ambiguity is the meaning of \"continued fraction associated with\". The interpretation used here is a standard one in the mathematical literature concerning the Markov and Lagrange spectra.\n*   The constructed form $[0; 1, 1, \\overline{3, 1, 1}]$ and the final standard form $[0; \\overline{1,1,3}]$ represent the same number. Questions asking for \"the\" continued fraction usually imply the standard representation with the shortest possible period appearing as early as possible.\n*   Calculations involving quadratic irrationals need to be handled with care, especially during simplification (rationalization) and the application of the continued fraction algorithm."
