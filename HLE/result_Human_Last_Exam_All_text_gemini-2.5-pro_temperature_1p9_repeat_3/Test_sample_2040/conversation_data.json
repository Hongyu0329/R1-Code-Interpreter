    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\n\nSPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In essence, a single high-energy photon (the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons, conventionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons. This process must conserve both energy and momentum. The key material property required for SPDC to occur is a significant second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Material Requirement for a Non-Zero $\\chi^{(2)}$**\n\nA material's response to an applied electric field can be described by the induced polarization ($P$). For second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC, the relevant term in the expansion is $P_i = \\epsilon_0 \\sum_{jk} \\chi_{ijk}^{(2)} E_j E_k$. A fundamental rule in physics and materials science dictates that for the bulk of a material to possess a non-zero second-order susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$), its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion. Such materials are called \"non-centrosymmetric\". In a centrosymmetric material, applying an inverse electric field ($-E$) must produce an inverse polarization ($-P$). The $\\chi^{(2)}E^2$ term does not change sign when the field is inverted ($(-E)^2 = E^2$), which violates this condition. Therefore, by symmetry, $\\chi^{(2)}$ must be zero in any centrosymmetric material.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Crystal Structure of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\nThe next step is to determine if boron nanosheets possess a center of inversion.\n*   **Polymorphism:** Unlike graphene, which has one primary structure, boron nanosheets (or borophene) are highly polymorphic. This means they can exist in many different atomic arrangements or crystal structures.\n*   **Common Structures:** The most commonly synthesized and theoretically stable phases of borophene are the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ phases.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** Both the ideal, planar $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ structures belong to the orthorhombic crystal system with the space group *Pmmn*. A crucial feature of the *Pmmn* space group is that it contains an inversion center. Therefore, these common phases of borophene are **centrosymmetric**.\n\n**Step 4: Draw the Primary Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis so far:\n1.  SPDC requires a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  A non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n3.  The common, stable forms of borophene are centrosymmetric.\n\nTherefore, an ideal, perfect, free-standing boron nanosheet is expected to have $\\chi^{(2)} = 0$ and, as a result, **should not** exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\nWhile the conclusion based on the ideal structure is \"No\", several real-world factors can complicate this picture. These are crucial for a complete analysis.\n\n1.  **Symmetry Breaking at Surfaces/Interfaces:** For any material, inversion symmetry is inherently broken at its surface. Since a nanosheet is essentially all surface, this can be a relevant factor. However, for a *free-standing* sheet in a vacuum, the top and bottom environments are identical, so this does not necessarily break the symmetry unless the sheet structure itself is asymmetric in the out-of-plane direction (which is not the case for ideal borophene).\n\n2.  **Structural Imperfections:** Real-world materials are never perfect. Defects, vacancies (other than the structurally intrinsic ones), grain boundaries, and especially edges of the nanosheet are all locations where the perfect crystal symmetry is broken. These regions could locally have a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ and contribute to a very weak SPDC signal.\n\n3.  **Strain and Curvature:** Boron nanosheets are known to be flexible and often exhibit significant structural corrugation or ripples (out-of-plane buckling). This physical distortion breaks the perfect planar inversion symmetry of the ideal structure. If this buckling is asymmetric, it can induce a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ across the sheet, potentially enabling SPDC. This is analogous to observations of second-harmonic generation (another $\\chi^{(2)}$ process) in strained graphene.\n\n4.  **\"Expected To Exhibit\":** The phrasing of the question is important. It asks if borophene would be *expected* to exhibit SPDC. This usually refers to an intrinsic, characteristic property of the material, not an effect that arises from imperfections or external factors. For instance, materials like BBO or h-BN are non-centrosymmetric by nature and are thus *expected* to exhibit second-order nonlinearities. Borophene, being intrinsically centrosymmetric, is not.\n\n### Final Synthesis\n\nThe fundamental crystal structure of the most stable borophene phases is centrosymmetric, which forbids second-order nonlinear processes like SPDC by the rules of symmetry. Therefore, one would not choose borophene as a candidate material for generating SPDC, and it is not an expected intrinsic property. Although real-world effects like structural buckling and defects will break this symmetry and could potentially allow for a weak SPDC effect to be measured, it would not be a characteristic or efficient process. The primary answer, based on the fundamental physics of the material's ideal structure, is no.\n\n<<<No>>>"
