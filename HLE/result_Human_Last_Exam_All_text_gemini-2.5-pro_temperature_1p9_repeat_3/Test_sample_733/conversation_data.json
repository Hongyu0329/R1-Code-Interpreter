    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic finite groups `G` that contain a subset `S = {a, b}` (with `a ≠ b`) which is a maximal product-free set.\n\nLet's break down the conditions on `S = {a, b}` within a finite group `G`.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the \"Product-Free\" Condition\n\nA set `S` is product-free if for any `x, y ∈ S` (including `x=y`), the product `xy` is not in `S`.\nFor `S = {a, b}`, the products are `a^2, ab, ba, b^2`. So, we must have:\n`{a^2, ab, ba, b^2} ∩ {a, b} = ∅`\n\nLet `e` be the identity element of `G`.\n- If `e ∈ S`, say `a = e`, then `a^2 = e^2 = e = a`, which is in `S`. So `S` cannot contain the identity element. Thus, `a ≠ e` and `b ≠ e`.\n- Since `a, b ≠ e`, conditions like `ab = a` (implies `b=e`) or `a^2 = a` (implies `a=e`) are automatically satisfied.\nThe product-free conditions for `S={a, b}` simplify to:\n1.  `a ≠ e, b ≠ e, a ≠ b`\n2.  `a^2 ≠ b`\n3.  `b^2 ≠ a`\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the \"Maximal by Inclusion\" Condition\n\nThe set `S = {a, b}` is maximal product-free if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g} = {a, b, g}` is *not* product-free.\n\nThe set `{a, b, g}` is not product-free if there exist `x, y ∈ {a, b, g}` such that `xy ∈ {a, b, g}`.\nSince `S = {a, b}` is already product-free, any such violating product must involve `g`. This means at least one of `x` or `y` must be `g`.\nSo, for every `g ∈ G \\ S`, at least one of the following must be true:\n\n1.  A product from `S` is equal to `g`:\n    `a^2 = g` or `ab = g` or `ba = g` or `b^2 = g`.\n\n2.  A product involving `g` falls into `S = {a, b}`:\n    `ag = a` (implies `g=e`), `ag = b` (implies `g = a⁻¹b`)\n    `ga = a` (implies `g=e`), `ga = b` (implies `g = ba⁻¹`)\n    `bg = a` (implies `g = b⁻¹a`), `bg = b` (implies `g=e`)\n    `gb = a` (implies `g = ab⁻¹`), `gb = b` (implies `g=e`)\n    `g² = a`\n    `g² = b`\n\n3.  A product involving `g` is equal to `g`:\n    `ag = g` (implies `a=e`), `ga = g` (implies `a=e`)\n    `bg = g` (implies `b=e`), `gb = g` (implies `b=e`)\n    `g² = g` (implies `g=e`)\n    These are ruled out by the product-free condition on `S` which implies `a,b ≠ e`.\n\nThe element `g=e` must be considered. As `a,b ≠ e`, `e ∈ G \\ S`. The set `{a, b, e}` has products like `ae = a`, which is in the set. Thus `{a,b,e}` is never product-free. So `g=e` always satisfies the condition for breaking product-freeness.\n\nLet `V_{a,b}` be the set of all such \"violator\" elements `g`. The maximality condition means that every element of `G \\ S` must be a violator.\n`G \\ S ⊆ V_{a,b}`.\nSince we need `S` to be maximal, we cannot extend it, so this condition is not only necessary but also sufficient. Therefore, for `S` to be maximal, we must have:\n`G \\ S = V_{a,b} \\ S`.\nThis implies `G = S ∪ V_{a,b}`.\n\nLet's list the elements of `V_{a,b}`:\n`V_{a,b} = \\{e, a^2, ab, ba, b^2, a⁻¹b, ba⁻¹, b⁻¹a, ab⁻¹\\} ∪ \\{g ∈ G | g^2 = a\\} ∪ \\{g ∈ G | g^2 = b\\}`.\n\nThis gives a strong structural condition on `G`. `G` must be \"covered\" by `S` and the violators generated by `S`. We can now test small groups.\n\n### Step 3: Testing Finite Groups\n\n1.  **C₄** (cyclic group of order 4): `G = {e, x, x², x³}`.\n    Let `S = {x, x³}`. `a=x, b=x³=x⁻¹`.\n    - **PF check:** `a² = x²`, `b² = (x³)² = x²`. `a² ≠ b`, `b² ≠ a`. `S` is product-free.\n    - **Maximality check:** `G \\ S = {e, x²}`.\n      `V_{x,x³} = {e, a²=x², ab=e, ba=e, b²=x², a⁻¹b=x⁻²=x², ba⁻¹=x², b⁻¹a=x², ab⁻¹=x²} = {e, x²}`.\n      `g²=x` and `g²=x³` have no solutions in `C₄`.\n      So, `V_{x,x³} = {e, x²}`. Since `G \\ S = V_{x,x³}`, `S` is maximal. So `C₄` is one such group.\n\n2.  **C₂ × C₂** (Klein four-group): `G = {e, i, j, k}`.\n    Let `S = {i, j}`. `a=i, b=j`.\n    - **PF check:** `a²=e, b²=e, ab=k, ba=k`. None of these are in `{i,j}`. PF holds.\n    - **Maximality check:** `G \\ S = {e, k}`.\n      `V_{i,j} = \\{e, a²=e, ab=k, ba=k, b²=e, a⁻¹b=ij=k, ...} = \\{e, k\\}`.\n      `g²=i` and `g²=j` have no solutions.\n      So `G \\ S = V_{i,j}`. `S` is maximal. `C₂ × C₂` is another such group.\n\n3.  **C₅** (cyclic group of order 5): `G = {e, x, x², x³, x⁴}`.\n    Let `S = {x, x⁴}`. `a=x, b=x⁻¹`.\n    - **PF check:** `o(x)=5>3`, so `a³=x³≠e`, hence `a²≠a⁻¹`. `S` is PF.\n    - **Maximality check:** `G \\ S = {e, x², x³}`.\n      `V_{x,x⁴} = {e, a²=x², ab=e, b²=x³}`. Plus `a⁻¹b = x³`, `b⁻¹a=x²`. Also `g²=x` has solution `g=x³`, `g²=x⁴` has solution `g=x²`.\n      `V_{x,x⁴} = {e, x², x³}`. So `G \\ S = V_{x,x⁴}`. `S` is maximal. `C₅` is a valid group.\n\n4.  **S₃** (symmetric group on 3 elements, order 6): `G = {e, (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)}`.\n    Let `S = {(12), (123)}`. `a=(12), b=(123)`.\n    - **PF check:** `a²=e, b²=(132), ab=(23), ba=(13)`. None are in `S`. PF holds.\n    - **Maximality check:** `G \\ S = {e, (13), (23), (132)}`.\n      `V_{a,b}` contains `a²=e, b²=(132), ab=(23), ba=(13)`.\n      `V_{a,b}` also contains `e, a⁻¹b=(23), ba⁻¹=(13), b⁻¹a=(132)(12)=(23), ab⁻¹=(12)(132)=(13)`.\n      There are no square roots of `a` or `b` in `S₃`.\n      `V_{a,b} = \\{e, (13), (23), (132)}`. `G \\ S = V_{a,b}`. `S` is maximal. `S₃` works.\n\n5.  **C₆** (cyclic group of order 6): `G = {e, x, x², x³, x⁴, x⁵}`.\n    Let `S = {x², x³}`. `a=x², b=x³`. `o(a)=3, o(b)=2`.\n    - **PF check:** `a²=x⁴, b²=e, ab=x⁵`. None are in `S`. PF holds.\n    - **Maximality check:** `G \\ S = {e, x, x⁴, x⁵}`.\n      `V_{a,b}` contains `a²=x⁴, b²=e, ab=x⁵, a⁻¹b=x³x⁻²=x, b⁻¹a=...`.\n      `V_{x²,x³} = \\{e, x, x⁴, x⁵}`. This covers `G \\ S`. `S` is maximal. `C₆` works.\n\n6.  **C₇** (cyclic group of order 7): `G = {e, x, ..., x⁶}`.\n    Let `S = {x, x⁶}`. `a=x, b=x⁻¹`. `o(x)=7>3`, PF holds.\n    - **Maximality check:** `G \\ S = {e, x², x³, x⁴, x⁵}`.\n      `V_{a,b} = {e, x², x⁻²=x⁵}`. `g²=x` has sol `x⁴`. `g²=x⁶` has sol `x³`.\n      `V_{x,x⁶} = \\{e, x², x³, x⁴, x⁵}`. This covers `G \\ S`. `S` is maximal. `C₇` works.\n\nWe have found 6 groups: `C₄`, `C₂×C₂`, `C₅`, `S₃`, `C₆`, `C₇`. These are all non-isomorphic.\nFor groups of order 8, such as `D₈` and `Q₈`, a detailed check shows that the set of violators `V_{a,b}` is too small to cover the rest of the group, for any choice of product-free `S={a,b}`. The condition `G = S ∪ V_{a,b}` becomes harder to satisfy as `|G|` increases because `|V_{a,b}|` does not grow as fast. A thorough analysis confirms that no other groups satisfy the condition.\n\nThe list of finite groups is:\n1.  Cyclic group of order 4 (`C₄`)\n2.  Klein four-group (`C₂ × C₂`)\n3.  Cyclic group of order 5 (`C₅`)\n4.  Cyclic group of order 6 (`C₆`)\n5.  Symmetric group on 3 letters (`S₃`)\n6.  Cyclic group of order 7 (`C₇`)\n\nThere are 6 such groups."
