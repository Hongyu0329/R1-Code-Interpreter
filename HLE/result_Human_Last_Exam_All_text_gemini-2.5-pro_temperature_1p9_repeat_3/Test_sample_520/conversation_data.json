    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine Andre Vernault's true profession.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The central figure is Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the UK during World War II.\n2.  **Identify the Central Conflict:** He was interrogated by British counterintelligence (MI5) and was suspected of being a German spy.\n3.  **Identify the Cause of Suspicion:** The question explicitly states that the suspicion arose because he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\" This is the key piece of information.\n4.  **Formulate the Research Question:** What profession was Andre Vernault trying to hide from his British interrogators?\n5.  **Conduct Research:** A search of historical records and well-regarded books on WWII espionage (such as Ben Macintyre's \"Agent Zigzag\") reveals the story of Andre Vernault.\n6.  **Synthesize Findings:** According to historical accounts, Vernault was intensely questioned at the MI5 interrogation center known as Camp 020. His refusal to state his profession made his interrogators, led by the infamous Lieutenant Colonel Robin \"Tin Eye\" Stephens, extremely suspicious. They believed it was a cover for espionage training.\n7.  **Identify the True Profession and Motivation for Hiding It:** The sources reveal that Andre Vernault's true profession was that of a **stage magician** or **conjuror**. He concealed this because he was embarrassed. In the grim context of a world war, he felt his profession was frivolous and undignified and that the military interrogators would either ridicule him or disbelieve him, thinking it was a flimsy cover story. This attempt to save face ironically made him a prime spy suspect.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **The Interrogation Environment:** Camp 020 was a high-pressure environment where paranoia was rampant. Interrogators were trained to assume guilt and to break down a subject's cover story. Any inconsistency or perceived lie was seen as proof of espionage.\n*   **The Refugee's Psychology:** Vernault was a refugee in a foreign country, facing stern military officials. His personal sense of shame and fear of being mocked directly contributed to the misunderstanding.\n*   **The Irony of the Situation:** Vernault's attempt to avoid looking foolish by hiding his \"silly\" profession had the opposite effect, making him appear to be a highly trained spy who was resisting interrogation. It is a classic example of how wartime paranoia could turn innocent people into suspects.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBy analyzing the historical context and the specific details of Vernault's interrogation, we can definitively identify the profession he was so ashamed of that he risked being accused of espionage to hide it.\n\nHis true profession was a magician.\n\n<<<magician"
