    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The core of the question is to determine the total number of unique members belonging to the \"let-7\" microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans (`Homo sapiens`).\n\n2.  **Define \"let-7 Family Member\":**\n    *   A miRNA family is a group of miRNAs that share the same \"seed sequence\" (typically nucleotides 2-8 from the 5' end). This shared sequence means they generally target the same set of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts.\n    *   The question can be interpreted in two ways: (a) the number of unique mature miRNA sequences (e.g., let-7a, let-7b), or (b) the number of genomic loci (genes) that produce these miRNAs (e.g., `hsa-mir-let-7a-1` and `hsa-mir-let-7a-2` are two different genes that produce the same mature let-7a miRNA).\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** In molecular biology, when referring to the \"number of members\" of a functional RNA family, the standard convention is to count the number of unique mature functional sequences, not the number of genes that encode them. We will proceed with this standard interpretation.\n\n3.  **Identify Authoritative Sources:** The most reliable and widely accepted database for miRNA sequences and annotation is **miRBase**. We will base our count on the members listed for *Homo sapiens* in this database.\n\n4.  **List the Canonical let-7 Family Members:**\n    *   Searching through miRBase or established literature for human let-7 family members yields the following list, named with a letter suffix:\n        *   hsa-let-7a\n        *   hsa-let-7b\n        *   hsa-let-7c\n        *   hsa-let-7d\n        *   hsa-let-7e\n        *   hsa-let-7f\n        *   hsa-let-7g\n        *   hsa-let-7i\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** There is no `hsa-let-7h`. This member exists in other species like mouse (`mmu-let-7h`) but has not been identified in humans.\n\n5.  **Identify Other Members of the Family:**\n    *   Beyond those named with the \"let-7\" prefix, there is another miRNA that shares the same seed sequence and is considered a core part of the let-7 family.\n        *   hsa-miR-98\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** `miR-98` was discovered and named independently before its functional relationship to the let-7 family was fully understood. Due to its identical seed sequence, it is now universally classified as a member of the let-7 family.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Count:**\n    *   Counting the listed members:\n        *   let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i (8 members)\n        *   miR-98 (1 member)\n    *   Total = 8 + 1 = 9 members.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Based on the standard classification in authoritative databases like miRBase, the human let-7 family consists of 9 distinct mature miRNA members. These are encoded by a total of 12 different genes, but the number of unique family members is 9.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe human let-7 miRNA family consists of the following 9 distinct mature members: `let-7a`, `let-7b`, `let-7c`, `let-7d`, `let-7e`, `let-7f`, `let-7g`, `let-7i`, and `miR-98`.\n\n<<<9>>>"
