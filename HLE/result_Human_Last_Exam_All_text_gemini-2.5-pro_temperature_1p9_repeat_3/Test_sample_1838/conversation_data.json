    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the central pixel of the line using Bresenham's algorithm.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the coordinates of the middle pixel on a line drawn from point P1(1, 1) to P2(11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm.\n\n**2. Analyze the Line's Properties**\n\n*   Starting Point (x1, y1) = (1, 1)\n*   Ending Point (x2, y2) = (11, 5)\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in x and y (delta values):\n*   Δx = x2 - x1 = 11 - 1 = 10\n*   Δy = y2 - y1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n**3. Determine the Driving Axis**\n\nWe compare the absolute values of Δx and Δy to determine which axis will be incremented in every step.\n*   |Δx| = 10\n*   |Δy| = 4\n\nSince |Δx| > |Δy|, the line is \"x-major\" or \"gentle.\" This means that for every step, we will increment `x` by 1 and use a decision parameter to determine whether to increment `y`.\n\n**4. Set up Bresenham's Algorithm Parameters**\n\nThe initial decision parameter `p` is calculated as:\n*   `p0 = 2 * Δy - Δx`\n*   `p0 = 2 * 4 - 10 = 8 - 10 = -2`\n\nThe rules for updating the decision parameter at each step are:\n*   If `p < 0`, we choose the pixel `(x_k + 1, y_k)` and update `p` as: `p_k+1 = p_k + 2 * Δy`\n*   If `p >= 0`, we choose the pixel `(x_k + 1, y_k + 1)` and update `p` as: `p_k+1 = p_k + 2 * Δy - 2 * Δx`\n\n**5. Determine the Central Pixel's Position**\n\nThe algorithm will generate `Δx + 1` pixels because `x` is the driving axis.\n*   Total number of pixels = 10 + 1 = 11 pixels.\n\nSince there is an odd number of pixels (11), there will be a single central pixel. The position of this pixel in the sequence is:\n*   Central Pixel Position = (11 + 1) / 2 = 6th pixel.\n\nThis means we need to find the coordinates of the 6th pixel generated by the algorithm.\n\n**6. Trace the Algorithm to Find the 6th Pixel**\n\nWe start at (1, 1) and trace the algorithm step by step.\n\n*   **Pixel 1 (Start):**\n    *   Coordinates: (1, 1)\n    *   Initial decision parameter: `p = -2`\n\n*   **Pixel 2 (x=2):**\n    *   Current `p = -2` which is less than 0. So, `y` does not change.\n    *   Coordinates: (2, 1)\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * Δy = -2 + 2 * 4 = 6`\n\n*   **Pixel 3 (x=3):**\n    *   Current `p = 6` which is greater than or equal to 0. So, `y` increments.\n    *   Coordinates: (3, 2)\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * Δy - 2 * Δx = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6`\n\n*   **Pixel 4 (x=4):**\n    *   Current `p = -6` which is less than 0. So, `y` does not change.\n    *   Coordinates: (4, 2)\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * Δy = -6 + 8 = 2`\n\n*   **Pixel 5 (x=5):**\n    *   Current `p = 2` which is greater than or equal to 0. So, `y` increments.\n    *   Coordinates: (5, 3)\n    *   Update `p`: `p = p + 2 * Δy - 2 * Δx = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10`\n\n*   **Pixel 6 (x=6):**\n    *   Current `p = -10` which is less than 0. So, `y` does not change.\n    *   Coordinates: **(6, 3)**\n\nWe have now found the 6th pixel in the sequence.\n\n**7. Final Answer**\n\nThe 6th pixel, which is the central pixel of the line, has the coordinates (6, 3). This also corresponds to the geometric midpoint of the line segment `((1+11)/2, (1+5)/2) = (6, 3)`.\n\nThe list of all pixels would be:\n(1,1), (2,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,3), **(6,3)**, (7,3), (8,4), (9,4), (10,5), (11,5)\n\nThe central pixel is (6, 3).\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
