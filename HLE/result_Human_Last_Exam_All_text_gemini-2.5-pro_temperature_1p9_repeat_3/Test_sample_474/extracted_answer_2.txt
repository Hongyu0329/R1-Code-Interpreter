The approach is fundamentally flawed and therefore not valid. The ecological function of mimicry in bumblebees is to provide a clear and memorable warning signal to their natural predators, which are primarily birds. The validity of the researcher's method hinges on the assumption that human visual perception is a good proxy for avian visual perception. This assumption is incorrect.

Key reasons for the invalidity are:
1.  **Different Visual Systems:** Humans are trichromats, while birds are tetrachromats with the ability to see ultraviolet (UV) light. Bumblebee color patterns often have significant UV reflectance components that are completely invisible to humans. Two species that appear similar to a human might look distinct to a bird, and vice versa, rendering human-based similarity rankings ecologically meaningless.
2.  **Unstandardized Stimuli:** Using "field images" introduces uncontrollable variables such as lighting conditions, background colors, and animal posture, all of which can alter the perception of similarity in ways that are not related to the bee's actual, consistent warning pattern.
3.  **Irrelevant Perceptual Criteria:** Untrained humans will use their own subjective criteria for similarity, which may not align with the specific visual cues (e.g., color band width, contrast boundaries as seen by a bird) that a predator uses to learn and recognize the warning signal.

For the clustering to be ecologically valid, it must be based on the perception of the relevant signal-receiver (the predator), not a human. A valid method would use techniques like spectrometry and models of avian vision to quantify similarity.
