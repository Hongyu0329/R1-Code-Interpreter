    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the most memory-efficient solution and calculate the total memory used for its variables.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\n1.  **Input**: A string `s` representing a mathematical sum, like \"3+2+1+4+2\".\n    *   The string only contains digits ('1', '2', '3', '4') and the '+' character.\n    *   The string is non-empty and its length is at most 1000 characters.\n    *   The string represents a valid sum.\n2.  **Task**: Rearrange the numbers in the sum into non-decreasing (sorted) order.\n3.  **Output**: Print the new sorted sum string, for example, \"1+2+2+3+4\".\n4.  **Constraint**: The primary goal is to find the C program with the minimum possible memory usage for its variables and to quantify that usage in bytes (`m`).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution and Careful Points\n\nTo achieve minimum memory usage, we must avoid storing data unnecessarily.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Avoid storing the entire input string.**\nA naive approach would read the whole string into a character array, like `char s[1001];`. This alone would consume 1001 bytes. A more memory-efficient solution is to process the input character by character as it's being read, for instance by using the `getchar()` function, which reads a single character from the standard input. This way, we only need to store one character at a time.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Use an efficient sorting method suitable for the data.**\nThe numbers to be sorted are very limited: only 1, 2, 3, and 4. A general-purpose sorting algorithm like quicksort would require storing all the numbers in an array first. Given the small, fixed range of values, **Counting Sort** is the most efficient algorithm in terms of both time and memory. Instead of storing the numbers themselves, we only need to count the frequency of each number.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Use the smallest appropriate data types for variables.**\nWhen declaring variables, we should choose the smallest data type that can hold the required range of values. For example, for a simple flag that is either true or false (0 or 1), a `char` (1 byte) is more memory-efficient than an `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: The Most Memory-Efficient Approach\n\nFollowing the principles above, here is the step-by-step design of the optimal program and the calculation of its memory usage.\n\n**Step 1: Counting the Numbers (Input Phase)**\nWe will read the input character by character and update our counts.\n*   We need an array to store the frequency of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. An integer array of size 4 is perfect for this. Let's call it `counts`. `counts[0]` will store the count of 1s, `counts[1]` the count of 2s, and so on.\n*   We need a variable to hold the character being read from the input. Since `getchar()` returns an `int` (to be able to represent `EOF`), we will use an `int` variable for this.\n\n**Step 2: Printing the Sorted Sum (Output Phase)**\nAfter counting, we will iterate from 1 to 4 and print each number as many times as it was counted, separated by '+' signs.\n*   We need a loop counter to iterate from 1 to 4. An `int` variable is suitable.\n*   To correctly print the '+' signs (i.e., not before the first number and not after the last), we need a flag. We can use a `char` variable as a boolean flag. It will be initialized to 0 (false) and set to 1 (true) after the first number is printed. Before printing any subsequent number, we check this flag; if it's true, we print a '+' first.\n*   Inside the main loop, we need another loop to print a number `counts[i]` times. Instead of declaring a new loop variable, we can use a `while` loop that decrements the value in the `counts` array, thus re-using existing memory.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating Total Memory (`m`)**\nLet's sum the memory required for each variable declared in our optimal program, assuming a standard C environment where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n\n1.  **`int counts[4];`**: An array to store the frequency of the four numbers (1, 2, 3, 4).\n    *   Memory = `4 * sizeof(int)` = `4 * 4` = **16 bytes**.\n2.  **`int c;`**: A variable to store the character returned by `getchar()` during the input phase.\n    *   Memory = `1 * sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n3.  **`int i;`**: A loop variable for the main printing loop (iterating through numbers 1 to 4).\n    *   Memory = `1 * sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n4.  **`char plus_needed;`**: A flag to manage the printing of '+' separators.\n    *   Memory = `1 * sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n**Total Memory `m`**:\n`m = (memory for counts) + (memory for c) + (memory for i) + (memory for plus_needed)`\n`m = 16 + 4 + 4 + 1`\n`m = 25` bytes.\n\nThis approach is maximally memory-efficient because it avoids storing the input string and the list of numbers, and it uses the smallest appropriate data types for all auxiliary variables.\n\n<<<25>>>"
