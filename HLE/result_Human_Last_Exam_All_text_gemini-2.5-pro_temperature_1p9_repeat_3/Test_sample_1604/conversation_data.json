    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Artist and Scope of Work:** The question asks about paintings by Lady Butler. Lady Butler (Elizabeth Southerden Thompson, 1846–1933) was a famous British painter specializing in military scenes. To answer the question, we need to survey her notable works that depict specific historical battles or military campaigns and identify the date of each event.\n\n2.  **List Major Paintings and their Historical Dates:** We will list some of her most well-known paintings along with the date of the battle or event they depict. It is important to look at her entire career, not just her most famous Victorian-era paintings.\n\n    *   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the **Battle of Quatre Bras**, which occurred on **June 16, 1815**.\n    *   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the **Battle of Waterloo**, which occurred on **June 18, 1815**.\n    *   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (painted 1879): Depicts the arrival of Dr. William Brydon at Jalalabad, marking the end of the disastrous **Retreat from Kabul** in **January 1842** during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n    *   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Shows the aftermath of the **Battle of Inkerman**, which took place on **November 5, 1854**, during the Crimean War.\n    *   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Illustrates the **Battle of Rorke's Drift** on **January 22–23, 1879**, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n    *   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1882): Depicts the death of Lieutenant Robert Elwes at the **Battle of Laing's Nek** on **January 28, 1881**, during the First Boer War.\n    *   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted c. 1885): Shows the Gordon Relief Expedition in the Sudan. The campaign's notable engagement was the **Battle of Abu Klea** on **January 17, 1885**.\n    *   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** (painted 1920): Depicts an event from World War I, the **Retreat from Mons** in **August 1914**.\n    *   ***The Pipes of War*** (painted c. 1916-17): Shows pipers of the 16th (Scottish) Division during World War I, with the scene set around **Christmas 1916**.\n    *   ***A German 'Strong Point', Hindenburg Line, March 1918*** (painted c. 1918): This painting depicts a battle scene from World War I. The date is explicitly mentioned in the title.\n\n3.  **Compare the Historical Dates:** Now, let's compare the dates of these events:\n    *   Battle of Quatre Bras: 1815\n    *   Battle of Waterloo: 1815\n    *   Retreat from Kabul: 1842\n    *   Battle of Inkerman: 1854\n    *   Battle of Rorke's Drift: 1879\n    *   Battle of Laing's Nek: 1881\n    *   Battle of Abu Klea: 1885\n    *   Retreat from Mons: 1914\n    *   Christmas on the Western Front: 1916\n    *   Fighting on the Hindenburg Line: **March 1918**\n\n4.  **Identify the Latest Battle:** By comparing the dates, the latest historical event depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the fighting on the Hindenburg Line in March 1918. This battle was part of the German Spring Offensive (also known as the Kaiserschlacht or Ludendorff Offensive) during World War I.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Artist's Full Career:** It is crucial to consider the full span of Lady Butler's work. While she is most famous for her Victorian-era pieces, she continued painting into the 20th century and covered World War I subjects. Overlooking her later work would lead to an incorrect answer (e.g., citing the Battle of Abu Klea from 1885).\n*   **Painting Date vs. Event Date:** The question asks for the latest *historical* battle, not the latest painting. The date the painting was created is irrelevant; what matters is the date of the event being depicted.\n*   **Specificity of the Battle:** The \"battle\" may be a specific named engagement (like Waterloo) or a component of a larger offensive. In this case, the painting's title, *A German 'Strong Point', Hindenburg Line, March 1918*, clearly identifies the scene as part of the battles on the Western Front during the German Spring Offensive of 1918.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the fighting on the Hindenburg Line in March 1918, as shown in her painting *A German 'Strong Point', Hindenburg Line, March 1918*. This was part of the German Spring Offensive during World War I.\n\n<<<The battle on the Hindenburg Line in March 1918"
