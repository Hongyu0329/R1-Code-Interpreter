No, it is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and the logical-metaphysical framework of Gödel's ontological proof operate in entirely separate domains with incommensurable concepts. Quantum mechanics models the probabilistic behavior of physical systems, whereas Gödel's proof is a formal argument about metaphysical necessity. There is no way to represent the core concepts of Gödel's proof (e.g., "positive properties," "necessary existence") within the mathematics of quantum mechanics (e.g., Hilbert spaces, operators).
