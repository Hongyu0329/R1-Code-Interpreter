    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map\n\nWe are asked to find the connectivity of a map $\\alpha: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nLet's analyze the spaces involved:\n*   $S^4$ is the 4-sphere. It is 3-connected (i.e., $\\pi_i(S^4) = 0$ for $i \\leq 3$).\n*   $S^6$ is the 6-sphere. It is 5-connected (i.e., $\\pi_i(S^6) = 0$ for $i \\leq 5$).\n*   $\\Omega X$ denotes the loop space of a pointed space $X$. Its homotopy groups are given by $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(X)$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected, as $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_{i+1}(S^4) = 0$ for $i \\leq 2$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected, as $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_{i+1}(S^6) = 0$ for $i \\leq 4$.\n*   $X \\wedge Y$ is the smash product of two pointed spaces. For connectivity, if $X$ is $m$-connected and $Y$ is $n$-connected, then $X \\wedge Y$ is $(m+n+1)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n*   $\\Sigma X$ is the reduced suspension of a space $X$. Suspension increases connectivity by one.\n    *   The domain of our map, $D = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n*   The codomain of our map is $C = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    *   $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$. It is 9-connected.\n    *   Thus, $C = \\Omega S^{10}$ is $(9-1)=8$-connected.\n\nSo, the map $\\alpha$ is a map between two 8-connected spaces. To find its connectivity, we need to analyze the induced maps on homotopy groups $\\pi_i(\\alpha): \\pi_i(D) \\to \\pi_i(C)$ for $i \\ge 9$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the construction of the map\n\nThe problem states the map is \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\". This is a strong hint pointing towards a specific canonical construction in homotopy theory involving fibrations.\n\n1.  Consider the path space fibration for a pointed space $X$, $p_X: PX \\to X$, where $PX$ is the space of paths in $X$ starting at the basepoint. The total space $PX$ is contractible, and the fiber is the loop space $\\Omega X$. We have fibrations:\n    *   $\\Omega S^4 \\to PS^4 \\to S^4$\n    *   $\\Omega S^6 \\to PS^6 \\to S^6$\n\n2.  Now, consider the smash product of these two fibrations:\n    $p_{S^4} \\wedge p_{S^6}: PS^4 \\wedge PS^6 \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$.\n    This map is a quasifibration (and for CW complexes this is sufficient).\n\n3.  Let's identify the three parts of this fibration:\n    *   **Total space:** $E = PS^4 \\wedge PS^6$. Since $PS^4$ and $PS^6$ are contractible pointed spaces, their smash product is also contractible.\n    *   **Base space:** $B = S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$.\n    *   **Homotopy fiber:** Let the fiber be $F$. A standard result in algebraic topology (due to Sugawara and Ganea) states that the homotopy fiber of a smash product of fibrations like this is the join of their fibers, which is homotopy equivalent to the suspension of their smash product. So, $F \\simeq \\Omega S^4 * \\Omega S^6 \\simeq \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. This is precisely the domain of our map $\\alpha$.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the map to a fundamental homotopy equivalence\n\nWe have established a fibration sequence $F \\to E \\to B$ where:\n*   $F \\simeq \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$\n*   $E \\simeq *$ (contractible)\n*   $B \\simeq S^{10}$\n\nNow, we use a fundamental theorem of homotopy theory: For any fibration $F \\to E \\to B$ where the total space $E$ is contractible, the fiber $F$ is homotopy equivalent to the loop space of the base, $\\Omega B$.\n\nThe long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration is:\n... $\\to \\pi_{i+1}(E) \\to \\pi_{i+1}(B) \\stackrel{\\partial}{\\to} \\pi_i(F) \\to \\pi_i(E) \\to$ ...\nSince $E$ is contractible, $\\pi_k(E)=0$ for all $k$. The long exact sequence breaks into isomorphisms:\n$\\partial: \\pi_{i+1}(B) \\stackrel{\\cong}{\\longrightarrow} \\pi_i(F)$ for all $i \\ge 0$.\n\nThis means $\\pi_i(F) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(B)$ for all $i$.\nLet's substitute our spaces back:\n$\\pi_i(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(S^{10})$.\n\nNow, consider the codomain of our map $\\alpha$, which is $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Omega S^{10}$. Its homotopy groups are:\n$\\pi_i(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(S^{10})$.\n\nComparing the two, we see that $\\pi_i(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_i(\\Omega S^{10})$ for all $i$.\n\nThe map $\\alpha$ in the question is precisely this canonical map that realizes the homotopy equivalence between the fiber $F$ and the loop space of the base $\\Omega B$. Since the spaces involved are CW complexes, a weak homotopy equivalence is a true homotopy equivalence.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the connectivity of the map\n\nThe map $\\alpha: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nA map $f: X \\to Y$ is said to be $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$ is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$. This is equivalent to its homotopy fiber being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\nIf a map is a homotopy equivalence, its homotopy fiber is contractible. A contractible space is $n$-connected for any integer $n$. Therefore, the map is $k$-connected for any integer $k$. In this case, the connectivity is said to be infinite.\n\n### Final conclusion\nThe map described in the question is a well-known homotopy equivalence in algebraic topology. Therefore, it induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups.\n\nThe connectivity of the map is infinite.\n\n<<<inf>>>"
