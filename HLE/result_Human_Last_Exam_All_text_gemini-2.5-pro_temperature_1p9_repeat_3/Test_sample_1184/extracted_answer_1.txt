Here is the analysis of the requested residues in the human voltage-gated calcium channel beta-1 subunit (CACNB1, UniProt P54283-1).

**1) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for INTERACTION with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located within the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and form the hydrophobic binding pocket that accommodates the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit.

*   **Y215** (Tyrosine at position 215)
*   **L217** (Leucine at 217)
*   **D243** (Aspartic acid at 243) - Forms a critical hydrogen bond, an electrostatic hotspot.
*   **L248** (Leucine at 248)
*   **V255** (Valine at 255)
*   **V296** (Valine at 296)
*   **W318** (Tryptophan at 318)
*   **M343** (Methionine at 343)
*   **F345** (Phenylalanine at 345)

**2) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning GATING PROPERTIES (gating modulation) of the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues and regions are involved in the allosteric regulation of the channel's biophysics, often without being part of the primary binding pocket.

*   **N-terminal Domain (residues ~1-30):** This entire variable region is a major determinant of the speed and voltage-dependence of channel inactivation.
*   **I108** (Isoleucine at 108): Located in the SH3 domain, this residue is crucial for transmitting the modulatory signal that affects voltage-dependent inactivation.
*   **HOOK Region (linker between SH3 and GK domains, approx. residues 163-207):** The structure and flexibility of this linker are critical for correctly positioning the domains and communicating the modulatory effect.
*   **D243** (Aspartic acid at 243) and **E244** (Glutamic acid at 244): This pair of adjacent acidic residues acts as a critical transducer. While D243 is also a binding hotspot, mutations in this pair alter the voltage-dependence of channel activation, showing their role in converting the binding event into a gating signal.
