    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Who:** German painter Curt Querner.\n*   **When:** In 1933.\n*   **What:** A self-portrait.\n*   **Context:** Painted after he had escaped from (or been released by) the Gestapo/SA.\n*   **Core Inquiry:** What object is he holding in the painting, and what is its symbolic meaning of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Specific Artwork**\nThe artwork in question is Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait, which is famously titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Distel\" in German. This translates to \"Self-Portrait with Thistle.\" This title immediately identifies the object.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Object**\nBased on the painting's title and visual analysis, the object Curt Querner is holding in his bare hand is a large thistle plant.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Symbolism of the Object**\nTo understand why he chose a thistle, we must consider its characteristics and the historical context.\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Nature of the Thistle:** A thistle is not a delicate flower. It is a coarse, prickly, and thorny plant. It is known for its resilience and ability to grow in harsh, unwelcoming environments. It is difficult to handle or eradicate.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Artist's Action:** Querner is not just near the thistle; he is gripping it firmly in his bare hand, ignoring the pain its thorns would inflict. His facial expression is stern, defiant, and unwavering.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Historical Context:** In 1933, the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. Querner, being associated with leftist artist groups, was deemed an opponent of the new regime. He was arrested by the SA (the Nazi Party's stormtroopers) in March 1933. Painting this self-portrait after his release was a direct act of political expression.\n*   **Synthesis of Symbolism:** By holding the thorny thistle, Querner is symbolically embracing hardship and pain. The plant itself represents his own defiant, resilient, and unyielding spirit in the face of the brutal Nazi regime. It is a powerful declaration that he will not be broken or tamed, much like the resilient thistle. The act is a clear symbol of steadfast resistance against oppression.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the Final Answer**\nBy combining the identification of the object and the analysis of its symbolism, we can conclude that the object held is a thistle, and it represents his defiance and resilience.\n\n***\n\n<<<A thistle>>>"
