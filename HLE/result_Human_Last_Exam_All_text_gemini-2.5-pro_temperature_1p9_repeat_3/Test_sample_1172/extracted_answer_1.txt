The change in mutual inductance is ΔM=M2−M1. Per unit length, this is given by the expression:
ΔM′ = - (μ₀h²(R₂² - R₁²)) / (2πd²R₁²)
where μ₀ is the permeability of free space, h is the separation of wires in each circuit, d is the distance between the circuits, and R₁ and R₂ are the inner and outer radii of the concentrator shells.
