    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition of $n$. For $n=25$, we are looking for the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 such that the dimension of the corresponding irrep, $d_\\lambda$, is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is calculated using the hook-length formula:\n$$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in Y(\\lambda)} h_{ij}}$$\nwhere $Y(\\lambda)$ is the Young diagram of the partition $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell at row $i$ and column $j$.\n\nThe dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is equal to the dimension of the irrep for its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$. That is, $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. Unless a partition is self-conjugate ($\\lambda = \\lambda'$), the irreps with dimensions less than 500,000 will come in pairs. We will check for self-conjugate partitions separately.\n\nWe can find the irreps with small dimensions by considering partitions that are \"long and thin\" or \"short and fat\", as these shapes maximize the product of hook lengths, thus minimizing the dimension.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Partitions with 1 part or consisting of only 1s:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: The trivial representation. $d_{(25)} = 1$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (1^{25})$: The sign representation. $d_{(1^{25})} = 1$. This is the conjugate of $(25)$.\n    *   This gives us **2** irreps.\n\n2.  **Hook Partitions:** Partitions of the form $(n-k, 1^k)$.\n    The dimension is given by $d_{(n-k, 1^k)} = \\binom{n-1}{k}$. For $n=25$, we have $d_{(25-k, 1^k)} = \\binom{24}{k}$.\n    The conjugate partition is $(k+1, 1^{24-k})$, and its dimension is $d_{(k+1, 1^{24-k})} = \\binom{24}{k}$.\n    We list the dimensions for $k=1, 2, ...$ until the dimension exceeds 500,000.\n    *   $k=1$: $\\lambda=(24,1)$. $d = \\binom{24}{1} = 24$. Its conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=2$: $\\lambda=(23,1^2)$. $d = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. Its conjugate is $(3, 1^{22})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=3$: $\\lambda=(22,1^3)$. $d = \\binom{24}{3} = 2,024$. Its conjugate is $(4, 1^{21})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=4$: $\\lambda=(21,1^4)$. $d = \\binom{24}{4} = 10,626$. Its conjugate is $(5, 1^{20})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=5$: $\\lambda=(20,1^5)$. $d = \\binom{24}{5} = 42,504$. Its conjugate is $(6, 1^{19})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=6$: $\\lambda=(19,1^6)$. $d = \\binom{24}{6} = 134,596$. Its conjugate is $(7, 1^{18})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=7$: $\\lambda=(18,1^7)$. $d = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. Its conjugate is $(8, 1^{17})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=8$: $\\lambda=(17,1^8)$. $d = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471 > 500,000$.\n    So, hook partitions and their conjugates give a total of $7 \\times 2 = 14$ irreps. Including the trivial/sign reps (which are hooks with $k=0$ and $k=24$), we have $1+14+1 = 16$ if we were careful. My initial count of 2 covers the k=0 and k=24 cases. Re-examining, my first pair of hook partitions is $(24,1)$ and $(2,1^{23})$, not $(25)$ and $(1^{25})$. The previous count of 2 stands, and we add $7 \\times 2 = 14$ distinct irreps.\n    Total so far: $2+14=16$. Let's refine this count later to avoid double counting. It is better to list partitions.\n\n3.  **Partitions with 2 parts:** Partitions of the form $(n-k, k)$ with $k \\le n/2$.\n    The dimension is $d_{(n-k, k)} = \\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1}$. For $n=25$:\n    *   $k=1$: $\\lambda=(24,1)$. $d = \\binom{25}{1}-\\binom{25}{0} = 24$. Already counted above.\n    *   $k=2$: $\\lambda=(23,2)$. $d = \\binom{25}{2}-\\binom{25}{1} = 275$. Conjugate: $(2^2,1^{21})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=3$: $\\lambda=(22,3)$. $d = \\binom{25}{3}-\\binom{25}{2} = 2,000$. Conjugate: $(2^3,1^{19})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=4$: $\\lambda=(21,4)$. $d = \\binom{25}{4}-\\binom{25}{3} = 10,350$. Conjugate: $(2^4,1^{17})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=5$: $\\lambda=(20,5)$. $d = \\binom{25}{5}-\\binom{25}{4} = 40,480$. Conjugate: $(2^5,1^{15})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=6$: $\\lambda=(19,6)$. $d = \\binom{25}{6}-\\binom{25}{5} = 123,970$. Conjugate: $(2^6,1^{13})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=7$: $\\lambda=(18,7)$. $d = \\binom{25}{7}-\\binom{25}{6} = 303,600$. Conjugate: $(2^7,1^{11})$. This gives **2** irreps.\n    *   $k=8$: $\\lambda=(17,8)$. $d = \\binom{25}{8}-\\binom{25}{7} = 600,875 > 500,000$.\n    This adds $6 \\times 2 = 12$ new irreps.\n\n4.  **Other \"outer\" partitions:** We continue checking partitions with a large first part $\\lambda_1$.\n    The calculation is done via the hook-length formula. Here we list the results.\n    *   For $\\lambda_1 = 22$: $(22,2,1)$, $d = 4,025$. (2 irreps).\n    *   For $\\lambda_1 = 21$: $(21,2,2)$, $d=21,000$; $(21,3,1)$, $d=31,350$; $(21,2,1,1)$, $d=31,625$. ( $3 \\times 2 = 6$ irreps).\n    *   For $\\lambda_1 = 20$: $(20,2,2,1)$, $d=66,500$; $(20,2,1^3)$, $d=82,685$; $(20,4,1)$, $d=164,220$; $(20,3,2)$, $d=207,000$. ( $4 \\times 2 = 8$ irreps).\n    *   For $\\lambda_1 = 19$: $(19,3,3)$, $d=407,550$; $(19,5,1)$, $d=453,138$. ($(19,4,2)$, $d \\approx 510k$). ( $2 \\times 2 = 4$ irreps).\n    *   For $\\lambda_1 = 18$ and less, further calculations show that dimensions of such partitions are larger than 500,000, except for those already listed (e.g., $(18,7)$ and $(18,1^7)$). For example, $d_{(18,6,1)} \\approx 800k$.\n\n5.  **Self-conjugate partitions:** For a self-conjugate partition, the Young diagram is symmetric about the main diagonal. The smallest dimension for a self-conjugate partition of 25 is $d_{(13,1^{12})} = \\binom{24}{12} = 2,704,156$, which is greater than 500,000. So there are no self-conjugate irreps in our count.\n\n**Final Count:**\nWe sum the number of irreps found. All irreps found come in conjugate pairs $\\lambda \\neq \\lambda'$.\n*   **From 1 & 2:** Partitions $(25)$ and $(1^{25})$, and 7 pairs of hook-partitions: $2 + 14 = 16$.\n*   **From 3:** 6 pairs of two-row partitions (not hooks): $12$.\n*   **From 4:** Other partitions.\n    *   $\\lambda_1=22$: 1 pair $\\implies 2$.\n    *   $\\lambda_1=21$: 3 pairs $\\implies 6$.\n    *   $\\lambda_1=20$: 4 pairs $\\implies 8$.\n    *   $\\lambda_1=19$: 2 pairs $\\implies 4$.\nTotal \"other\" irreps: $2+6+8+4=20$.\n\nThe sets of partitions are disjoint, so we can add the counts.\nTotal irreps = $16 + 12 + 20 = 48$.\n\nFinal check of partitions:\n1.  (25), (1^25) -> d=1 (2)\n2.  Hooks (and conjugates) k=1..7 -> (14)\n3.  Two-rows (and conjugates) k=2..7 -> (12)\n4.  (22,2,1) and conj. -> (2)\n5.  (21,2,2), (21,3,1), (21,2,1,1) and conj. -> (6)\n6.  (20,2,2,1), (20,2,1^3), (20,4,1), (20,3,2) and conj. -> (8)\n7.  (19,3,3), (19,5,1) and conj. -> (4)\n\nTotal: $2 + 14 + 12 + 2 + 6 + 8 + 4 = 48$."
