    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The bromine (Br) is a good leaving group. The stereochemistry (1S,2R) is specified, which is a critical piece of information.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide ($KOC(CH_3)_3$, or t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** Tert-butyl alcohol ($HOC(CH_3)_3$, or t-BuOH). This is the conjugate acid of the base, commonly used as a solvent for such reactions.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an elimination reaction, specifically the E2 (bimolecular elimination) mechanism. Substitution (SN2) is highly disfavored due to the steric hindrance of both the base and the secondary carbon center.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Relative Stereochemistry of the Substrate**\nWe need to determine if the bromine and methyl groups are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans) of the cyclohexane ring. Assigning the absolute configuration (R/S) for cis and trans isomers shows:\n*   trans-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane corresponds to (1R,2R) or (1S,2S).\n*   cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane corresponds to (1R,2S) or (1S,2R).\nTherefore, our starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is the **cis** isomer.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\nThe cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations.\n*   **Conformation A:** The substituents are axial-equatorial.\n*   **Conformation B:** The substituents are equatorial-axial.\n\nTo determine which conformation is more stable, we consider the steric bulk of the substituents. The methyl group ($CH_3$) is significantly bulkier than the bromine atom (Br). The conformation that places the larger methyl group in the more spacious equatorial position will be lower in energy and thus the major conformation at equilibrium.\n*   **Major Conformation:** Methyl group is **equatorial**, and the Bromine atom is **axial**.\n*   **Minor Conformation:** Methyl group is **axial**, and the Bromine atom is **equatorial**.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Stereochemical Requirement for the E2 Reaction**\nThe E2 mechanism requires a specific geometry: the leaving group (Br) and the β-proton (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be **anti-periplanar**. In a cyclohexane chair, this corresponds to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement (both groups must be in axial positions, one pointing up and the other down).\n\nThe reaction must proceed through the conformation where the leaving group (Br) is axial. In our case, this is the **major conformation** (Me-eq, Br-ax).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Possible Elimination Products (Regiochemistry)**\nWith the bromine atom in an axial position, we look for β-protons that are also axial. The β-carbons are C2 and C6.\n*   **β-proton at C2:** The methyl group is in the equatorial position, which means the hydrogen on C2 is in the **axial** position. This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination of this proton forms a double bond between C1 and C2. This leads to the **Zaitsev product: 1-methylcyclohexene**. This is a trisubstituted alkene (more stable alkene).\n*   **β-proton at C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is equatorial, and one is **axial**. This axial hydrogen is also anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination of this proton forms a double bond between C1 and C6. This leads to the **Hofmann product: 3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a disubstituted alkene (less stable alkene).\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Major Product**\nThe choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann products is determined by the steric bulk of the base.\n*   Potassium tert-butoxide is a very bulky base.\n*   The β-proton at C2 is sterically hindered by the adjacent equatorial methyl group and other axial hydrogens.\n*   The β-proton at C6 is significantly less sterically hindered.\nDue to its large size, the tert-butoxide base will preferentially attack the more sterically accessible proton at C6. This leads to the formation of the Hofmann product.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe reaction proceeds via an E2 mechanism on the major conformer (axial Br, equatorial Me). The bulky base (t-BuOK) selectively removes the less sterically hindered β-proton from C6, leading to the formation of the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product).\n\nThe name of the major product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
