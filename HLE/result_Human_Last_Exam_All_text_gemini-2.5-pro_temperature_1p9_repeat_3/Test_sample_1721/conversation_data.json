    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe are looking for the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a subset $A$ of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ with a size of approximately $cN$ (formally, $|A| = (c+o(1))N$) for which the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares. Let $S = \\{k^2 \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ be the set of perfect squares. The condition is $(A+A) \\cap S = \\emptyset$.\n\n**Step 2: Constructing a Set to Find a Lower Bound for *c***\nA powerful method for constructing such sets is to use modular arithmetic. The idea is to find a modulus $q$ and a set of residue classes $I \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, q-1\\}$ such that for any $i, j \\in I$, the sum $i+j \\pmod q$ is never a quadratic residue modulo $q$. If we then define $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod q \\in I\\}$, then for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum $a_1+a_2$ will never be a perfect square.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Modular Method with Modulus 3**\nLet's choose the modulus $q=3$.\nFirst, we identify the quadratic residues modulo 3.\n$0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$\n$1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n$2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\nSo, the set of squares modulo 3 is $S_3 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThis means any perfect square number must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. Consequently, any number congruent to 2 modulo 3 cannot be a perfect square.\n\n**Step 4: Building the Set A**\nWe want to construct $A$ such that for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, the sum $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\nA simple way to achieve this is to ensure that every element in $A$ is congruent to the same residue class $r \\pmod 3$, such that $r+r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\nThis gives the equation $2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, which implies $r \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nSo, let's define our set $A$ as all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that are congruent to 1 modulo 3:\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$\nFor any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Their sum is $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\nSince no integer that is $2 \\pmod 3$ can be a square, $A+A$ contains no squares.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Density of A**\nThe set $A = \\{1, 4, 7, \\dots\\}$ consists of approximately one-third of the numbers from $1$ to $N$. More formally, $|A| = \\lfloor\\frac{N-1}{3}\\rfloor+1 = \\frac{N}{3} + O(1)$.\nIn the asymptotic notation of the problem, $|A| = (1/3 + o(1))N$.\nThis construction shows that it's possible to have such a set with $c = 1/3$. Therefore, we have a lower bound for the largest possible $c$: $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n**Step 6: Investigating other constructions**\nWe can try other moduli to see if we can find a better construction.\n-   **Modulus 4:** Squares mod 4 are $\\{0, 1\\}$. We need sums to be 2 or 3 mod 4. If we choose $A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}$, then $A+A \\subseteq \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4\\}$, which is square-free. The density is $c=1/4$. If we choose $A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\}$, we get the same density. If we try to take elements from both classes, say $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and $a_2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, their sum is $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$, which can be a square. So we are limited to a density of $1/4$.\n-   **Modulus 5:** Squares mod 5 are $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$. We need sums to be in $\\{2, 3\\}$. If $A$ contains numbers from only one residue class $r$, we need $2r \\in \\{2, 3\\} \\pmod 5$, so $r=1$ or $r=4$. This gives a density of $1/5$. If we try to combine classes, say $I=\\{1,4\\}$, then $1+4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5$, which can be a square.\nThese simple constructions do not improve upon the $c=1/3$ result.\n\n**Step 7: The Upper Bound for *c***\nThe argument for the lower bound $c \\ge 1/3$ is elementary. Proving that no denser set is possible (i.e., $c \\le 1/3$) is a much more difficult problem. For a long time, it was a major open conjecture in combinatorial number theory that the true value is $c=1/3$.\nThis longstanding conjecture was recently proven to be true. The proof confirms that $1/3$ is indeed the maximal asymptotic density. Any set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| > (1/3 + o(1))N$ must contain two elements $a_1, a_2$ such that their sum $a_1+a_2$ is a perfect square.\n\n**Step 8: Final Conclusion**\nCombining the lower bound from the explicit construction ($c \\ge 1/3$) and the difficult upper bound result from recent advances in number theory ($c \\le 1/3$), we can conclude that the largest number $c$ is $1/3$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
