    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate its variable memory usage.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe problem asks us to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two input strings. The strings are guaranteed to be of the same length, which is between 1 and 100 characters. Based on the comparison, we must print -1, 1, or 0.\n\n*   **Input:** Two strings on two separate lines.\n*   **Comparison:** Lexicographical, but case-insensitive (e.g., 'A' is equal to 'a').\n*   **Output:** \"-1\" if string1 < string2, \"1\" if string1 > string2, \"0\" if they are equal.\n*   **Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient\". We need to find `m`, the total memory in bytes used for the program's variables.\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\n1.  **Memory Efficiency:** The main goal is to minimize the memory used by variables. This means avoiding large data structures if possible and choosing the smallest appropriate data types for variables.\n2.  **Input Handling:** Standard input in C is often line-buffered. This implies that the first string (on the first line) must be consumed before the second string (on the second line) is available for reading. This is a critical constraint.\n3.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** Each character from both strings must be converted to a common case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison. The `tolower()` function from `<ctype.h>` is suitable for this.\n4.  **Same Length Guarantee:** The problem guarantees the strings are of the same length. This simplifies the logic, as we don't need to handle cases where one string is a prefix of the other. We can loop until we reach the end of one string, knowing the other will end at the same time.\n5.  **Variable Sizing:** We must select data types carefully. For an index that goes up to 100, `char` (1 byte) is sufficient instead of `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\nTo achieve maximum memory efficiency, we should avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously if possible.\n\n1.  **Storing String 1:** Due to the line-buffered nature of standard input, we cannot interleave reading from both strings. We must read the first string and store it to compare it against the second string later. The maximum length is 100, so we need an array of 101 characters to include the null terminator (`\\0`).\n    *   `char s1[101];` -> This will consume `101 * sizeof(char) = 101` bytes.\n\n2.  **Processing String 2:** We can avoid storing the entire second string. Instead, we can read it one character at a time and perform the comparison immediately. This saves a 101-byte buffer.\n\n3.  **Looping and Iteration:** We need a loop to iterate through the characters of the stored string `s1`. The loop index will go from 0 up to the string's length (max 99). A single `char` variable is sufficient to hold this index.\n    *   `char i;` -> This will consume `sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n4.  **Storing a Character from String 2:** Inside the loop, we need a variable to hold the character we are currently reading from the second string. A single `char` is perfect for this.\n    *   `char ch2;` -> This will consume `sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n5.  **Putting it all together (The Algorithm):**\n    a. Declare `char s1[101];`.\n    b. Read the first string into `s1` (e.g., using `scanf(\"%s\", s1);`).\n    c. Declare `char i = 0;` and `char ch2;`.\n    d. Start a loop that runs as long as `s1[i]` is not the null terminator.\n    e. Inside the loop, read a single character from the input into `ch2` (e.g., using `scanf(\" %c\", &ch2);`). The space in the format string cleverly handles any whitespace, like the newline between the two strings.\n    f. Compare `tolower(s1[i])` with `tolower(ch2)`.\n    g. If they differ, print \"-1\" or \"1\" and exit.\n    h. If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are equal. Print \"0\".\n\n6.  **Calculating Total Memory (`m`):**\n    The total memory is the sum of memory allocated for all variables defined in the program.\n    *   Memory for `s1`: 101 bytes\n    *   Memory for `i`: 1 byte\n    *   Memory for `ch2`: 1 byte\n    *   Total `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\nThis approach is optimally memory-efficient because storing the first string is unavoidable, and it uses the smallest possible variables for the required logic. A more straightforward solution storing both strings would use `101 + 101 + 4 = 206` bytes (using an `int` counter), which is significantly more.\n\n<<<103>>>"
