    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the differential equation**\nWe are given the autonomous ordinary differential equation:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nLet's denote the right-hand side as $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the system is in a steady state, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out a common term, $-x$:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term inside the parentheses is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points. They are:\n$$ x_1 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_2 = 1 $$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\nTo determine the stability, we can use the linearization method, which involves checking the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at each equilibrium point.\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\nThe rules for stability based on $f'(x^*)$ at an equilibrium point $x^*$ are:\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable (specifically, asymptotically stable).\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the linearization test is inconclusive, and we must use other methods.\n\nLet's test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the linearization test is inconclusive for this point.\n\n**Step 4: Alternative stability analysis for $x=1$**\nWhen the linearization test is inconclusive, we can analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point. This is often visualized with a phase line diagram.\nOur function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$. The term $(x-1)^2$ is always non-negative. Therefore, the sign of $f(x)$ is determined by the sign of the term $-x$ (for $x \\neq 1$).\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$):** $x>0$, so $-x<0$. This means $f(x) < 0$. Thus, $x'(t) < 0$, and the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving *away* from 1.\n*   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$):** $x>0$, so $-x<0$. This means $f(x) < 0$. Thus, $x'(t) < 0$, and the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving *towards* 1.\n\nLet's summarize the flow on a phase line:\n*   To the left of $x=0$ (e.g., $x=-1$), $f(x) = -(-1)(-1-1)^2 = 4 > 0$. So $x'(t) > 0$ (arrow points right: $\\rightarrow$).\n*   Between $x=0$ and $x=1$ (e.g., $x=0.5$), $f(x) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 < 0$. So $x'(t) < 0$ (arrow points left: $\\leftarrow$).\n*   To the right of $x=1$ (e.g., $x=2$), $f(x) = -2(2-1)^2 < 0$. So $x'(t) < 0$ (arrow points left: $\\leftarrow$).\n\nThe phase line looks like this:\n$$ \\xrightarrow{\\hspace{1cm}} \\quad 0 \\quad \\xleftarrow{\\hspace{1cm}} \\quad 1 \\quad \\xleftarrow{\\hspace{1cm}} $$\n\nFrom the phase line, we can see:\n*   At $x=0$, trajectories from both sides move towards it. This confirms that $x=0$ is an asymptotically **stable** equilibrium point (a sink).\n*   At $x=1$, the trajectory from the right moves towards it, but the trajectory from the left moves away from it. This is a **semi-stable** equilibrium point.\n\nAn equilibrium point must be stable from all nearby directions to be considered stable (in the sense of Lyapunov). Since trajectories starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the point $x=1$ is classified as **unstable**.\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of stable equilibrium points**\nBased on our analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point: $x=0$.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final expression**\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$, we get:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
