    "This problem asks for the number of distinct true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}. The symbols can be repeated.\n\nThe approach is to identify all possible valid syntactic structures for a 5-symbol expression, and for each structure, count the number of ways to assign literals (T/F) and operators (&/|) to make the expression evaluate to True. An expression \"written\" means we count distinct sequences of 5 symbols.\n\nLet L denote a literal (T or F), B a binary operator (& or |), and U a unary operator (!).\n\n### Part 1: Expressions without Parentheses\n\nThese are strings of 5 symbols from {T, F, !, &, |} that are well-formed.\n\n1.  **Structure `L B L B L`** (e.g., `T & F | T`)\n    There are 2³ ways to choose the three literals and 2² ways to choose the two operators, for a total of 32 unique written expressions. We need to count how many are true, considering operator precedence (`&` before `|`).\n    *   `L1 & L2 & L3`: This is true only if `L1=T`, `L2=T`, `L3=T`. (1 expression: `T&T&T`)\n    *   `L1 & L2 | L3`: True if `L3=T` (4 choices for L1,L2) or if `L1=T,L2=T,L3=F` (1 choice). (5 expressions)\n    *   `L1 | L2 & L3`: True if `L1=T` (4 choices for L2,L3) or if `L1=F,L2=T,L3=T` (1 choice). (5 expressions)\n    *   `L1 | L2 | L3`: True unless `L1=F`, `L2=F`, `L3=F`. (7 expressions)\n    Total for this structure: 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = **18**.\n\n2.  **Structure `!L B !L`** (e.g., `!T | !F`)\n    This has 5 symbols (`!,L,B,!,L`). There are 2² literal choices and 2 operator choices (8 expressions).\n    *   `!L1 & !L2`: True only if `!L1=T` and `!L2=T` (i.e., `L1=F, L2=F`). (1 expression: `!F&!F`)\n    *   `!L1 | !L2`: True unless `!L1=F` and `!L2=F` (i.e., `L1=T, L2=T`). (3 expressions)\n    Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n3.  **Structure `!!L B L`** (e.g., `!!T & F`)\n    This evaluates as `L1 B L2`.\n    *   `!!L1 & L2`: Evaluates as `L1 & L2`. True only for `L1=T, L2=T`. (1 expression: `!!T&T`)\n    *   `!!L1 | L2`: Evaluates as `L1 | L2`. True unless `L1=F, L2=F`. (3 expressions)\n    Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n4.  **Structure `L B !!L`** (e.g., `T | !!F`)\n    This is symmetric to the previous case.\n    Total for this structure: **4**.\n\n5.  **Structure `!!!!L`** (e.g., `!!!!T`)\n    The expression `!!!!L` evaluates to `L`.\n    *   It is true only if `L=T`. (1 expression: `!!!!T`)\n    Total for this structure: **1**.\n\nTotal for non-parenthesized expressions: 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = **31**.\n\n### Part 2: Expressions with Parentheses\n\nThese expressions must use `(` and `)` as two of their 5 symbols.\n\n1.  **Structure `( L B L )`**\n    The inner expression `LBL` has length 3. The total length is 5.\n    *   `(L & L)` is true only for `(T&T)`. (1 expression)\n    *   `(L | L)` is true for `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`. (3 expressions)\n    Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n2.  **Structure `( !!L )`**\n    The inner expression `!!L` has length 3. The total is 5. `(!!L)` evaluates as `L`.\n    *   True only for `L=T`. (1 expression: `(!!T)`)\n    Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n3.  **Structure `( ( L ) )`**\n    The inner expression `L` has length 1, `(L)` has 3, `((L))` has 5. `((L))` evaluates as `L`.\n    *   True only for `L=T`. (1 expression: `((T))`)\n    Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n4.  **Structure `( L ) B L`**\n    *   `(L1) & L2`: True only for `(T)&T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `(L1) | L2`: True for `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`. (3 expressions)\n    Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n5.  **Structure `L B ( L )`**\n    Symmetric to the previous case.\n    Total for this structure: **4**.\n\n6.  **Structure `! ( !L )`**\n    Inner expression `!L` has length 2. `(!L)` has 4. `!(!L)` has 5. It evaluates as `L`.\n    *   True only for `L=T`. (1 expression: `!(!T)`)\n    Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n7.  **Structure `!! ( L )`**\n    Inner expression `L` has length 1. `(L)` has 3. `!!(L)` has 5. It evaluates as `L`.\n    *   True only for `L=T`. (1 expression: `!!(T)`)\n    Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n8.  **Structure `! ( ( L ) )`**\n    Inner expression `L` has length 1. `(L)` has 3. `((L))` has 4. `!((L))` has 5. It evaluates as `!L`.\n    *   True only for `L=F`. (1 expression: `!((F))`)\n    Total for this structure: **1**.\n\n9.  **Structure `( ! ( L ) )`**\n    Inner `L` has length 1. `(L)` has 3. `!(L)` has 4. `(!(L))` has 5. It evaluates as `!L`.\n    *   True only for `L=F`. (1 expression: `(!(F))`)\n    Total for this structure: **1**.\n\nTotal for parenthesized expressions: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **18**.\n\n### Final Count\n\nCombining both cases:\nTotal = (Expressions without parentheses) + (Expressions with parentheses)\nTotal = 31 + 18 = 49.\n\nThere are 49 such true boolean expressions.\n\n<<<49>>>"
