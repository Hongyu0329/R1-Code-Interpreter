    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a \"conceptual entity.\" We are given several clues about this entity:\n    *   It's mentioned by the historian Fernand Braudel.\n    *   Braudel was quoting the writer Paul Morand.\n    *   The entity is exemplified by \"the symbol of a nation.\"\n    *   This entity should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   The context is a \"global historical perspective.\"\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** The first step is to find where Fernand Braudel quotes Paul Morand on this topic. A search reveals the source is the preface to Braudel's work, *The Identity of France, Volume One: History and Environment*.\n\n3.  **Examine the Original Quote:** In the preface, Braudel writes:\n    > \"I am fond of a remark by Paul Morand... He added that this passion [for France] should be 'subjected to the test of doubt', and concluded: '**A history of France** should from now on be inscribed within the sphere whose centre it would long occupy'. To inscribe France within the sphere... what better programme could there be for a historian?\"\n\n4.  **Connect the Quote to the Question's Phrasing:**\n    *   The question asks for a \"conceptual entity.\"\n    *   The direct object in the quote is \"**A history of France**.\"\n    *   The question states the entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" In the quote, the specific nation is France. Therefore, \"A history of France\" is a specific example of the more general conceptual entity.\n    *   Generalizing from the specific example (\"A history of France\"), the conceptual entity is the **history of a nation**.\n\n5.  **Verify the Answer with All Clues:**\n    *   **Conceptual entity:** \"History of a nation\" is an abstract, conceptual field of study. (✓)\n    *   **Exemplified by the symbol of a nation:** The specific example in the quote is the history of a particular nation, France. (✓)\n    *   **Inscribed within a sphere:** The quote explicitly states it \"should... be inscribed within the sphere.\" This metaphor means placing the national story into a global context, which is the core of Braudel's argument. (✓)\n    *   **Quoted by Braudel from Morand:** This is confirmed by the source text. (✓)\n    *   **Global historical perspective:** The very act of inscribing a national history within \"the sphere\" (the globe) is the definition of adopting a global perspective, moving beyond narrow, self-contained national narratives. (✓)\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Entity vs. the Example:** The entity is not the \"nation\" itself, but the *history* of the nation. The question is carefully phrased to make this distinction (\"exemplified by the symbol of a nation\").\n*   **The Metaphor:** \"Inscribed within a sphere\" is the key metaphor. It signifies contextualization on a global scale, breaking from traditional, isolated national histories.\n*   **The Intellectual Context:** Braudel championed the *Annales* school of history, which emphasized long-term structures (*longue durée*) and broad, interdisciplinary perspectives over singular events or purely political narratives. Adopting Morand's quote perfectly encapsulates this approach.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of the original quote from Braudel's *The Identity of France*, the specific phrase that fits the description of a \"conceptual entity\" is \"A history of France.\" Generalizing this specific example as requested by the question's phrasing (\"exemplified by... a nation\"), the entity is the history of a nation.\n\n<<<History of a nation"
