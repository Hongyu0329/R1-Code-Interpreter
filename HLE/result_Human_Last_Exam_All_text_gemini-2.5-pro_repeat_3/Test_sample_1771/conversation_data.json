    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gieti`.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European Form\n\n*   **PIE Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n*   **Root:** The root is `*seh₂g-`. The `h₂` represents a laryngeal consonant.\n*   **Suffix:** `-ie-` is a present tense suffix (a \"ye/yo-present\").\n*   **Ending:** `-ti` is the 3rd person singular active present indicative ending.\n*   **Laryngeal Effect:** The laryngeal `*h₂` has an \"a-coloring\" effect on an adjacent `*e`. Therefore, `*seh₂g-` was phonetically realized as `*sāg-`, with a long vowel `*ā`. The cognates provided (Latin `sāgīre`, Hittite `sākizzi`) confirm this reconstruction with a long `*ā`.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation into Proto-Germanic (PGmc)\n\nWe start with the PIE root form `*sāg-`. Two major sound laws apply to get to Proto-Germanic.\n\n1.  **PIE `*ā` > PGmc `*ō`:** This is a regular vowel shift. The long `*ā` in our root `*sāg-` becomes a long `*ō`.\n    *   `*sāg-` → `*sōg-`\n2.  **Grimm's Law (First Germanic Sound Shift):** This law affects consonants. The relevant part here is the shift of voiced stops to voiceless stops.\n    *   PIE `*g` → PGmc `*k`\n    *   Applying this to our intermediate form `*sōg-`, we get `*sōk-`.\n\n**Careful Point: Verner's Law**\nVerner's law voices the voiceless fricatives resulting from Grimm's Law if the original PIE accent did not immediately precede them. However, it does not apply to the voiceless *stops* (like `*k` from PIE `*g`) that resulted from Grimm's Law. It also does not apply to word-initial `*s`. Therefore, the root is correctly `*sōk-`.\n\n**Verb Formation:**\nThe PIE `*-ie/o-` present tense verbs merged with causative verbs to become the Class 1 weak verbs in Proto-Germanic. These verbs are formed with the suffix `*-ija-` and have the infinitive ending `*-aną`.\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** The infinitive form is `*sōkijaną`.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation into Daughter Languages\n\nWe start from the Proto-Germanic infinitive `*sōkijaną`. The key change affecting the root vowel in all three daughter languages is **i-umlaut** (or i-mutation), caused by the `*/j/` in the suffix.\n\n#### A. Old Norse (ON)\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** The `*/j/` in `*-ijaną` causes the back vowel `*ō` (`/oː/`) in the root to be fronted.\n    *   PGmc `*ō` → ON `œ` or `æ` (`/øː/`).\n    *   `*sōk-` → `sœk-` / `sæk-`\n2.  **Suffix Development:** The `*/j/` is retained after a short syllable but is lost after a long syllable (like `sōk-`) after it has caused umlaut. The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-a`.\n    *   `*-ijaną` → `-ja` (The `j` is orthographically present but represents the palatal quality affecting the consonant).\n*   **Old Norse Result:** `sækja` (or `sœkja`) 'to seek, visit, attack'.\n\n#### B. Old English (OE)\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The `*/j/` causes the root vowel `*ō` to front and raise.\n    *   PGmc `*ō` → OE `ē` (`/eː/`).\n    *   `*sōk-` → `sēc-`\n2.  **Palatalization:** The consonant `*k` was palatalized to a `c` (pronounced /tʃ/, as in \"church\") before the new front vowel `ē`.\n    *   `sēc-` → `sēċ-` (The dot is often omitted in standard spelling).\n3.  **Suffix Development:** The `*/j/` is lost, and the infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an`.\n*   **Old English Result:** `sēcan` 'to seek, look for'.\n\n#### C. Old High German (OHG)\n\n1.  **Old High German Vowel Shift:** Before other changes, Proto-Germanic `*ō` becomes `uo` in Old High German.\n    *   PGmc `*ō` → OHG `uo`.\n    *   `*sōk-` → `suok-`\n2.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This law affects voiceless stops.\n    *   PGmc `*k` → OHG `hh` (a long voiceless fricative, /xx/) when it follows a vowel. It is spelled `hh` or `ch`.\n    *   `suok-` → `suohh-` / `suoch-`\n3.  **I-Umlaut and Suffix Development:** The `*/j/` caused umlaut of `uo` to `üe`, but this change was often not written in Old High German manuscripts, only appearing consistently in Middle High German. The `*/j/` also caused the preceding consonant (`hh`) to be geminated (lengthened) and was then lost. The infinitive ending `*-aną` became `-an`.\n    *   `*-jan` → `-(h)en`.\n*   **Old High German Result:** `suohhen` (or `suochen`) 'to seek, search for'.\n\n### Final Summary\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sækja` (or `sœkja`)\n*   **Old English:** `sēcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen` (or `suochen`)\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sækja (or sœkja); Old English: sēcan; Old High German: suohhen (or suochen)>>>"
