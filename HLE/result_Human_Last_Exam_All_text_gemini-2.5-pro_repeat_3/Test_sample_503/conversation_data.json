    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is a pair of 1-morphisms $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to A$ along with 2-morphisms $\\eta: \\text{id}_A \\to g \\circ f$ and $\\epsilon: f \\circ g \\to \\text{id}_B$ satisfying the triangle identities. In a locally posetal 2-category like the one described, the triangle identities are automatically satisfied. Thus, we only need to find the number of pairs of morphisms $(f, g)$ for which the 2-morphisms $\\eta$ and $\\epsilon$ exist.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of $\\Delta$ as a 2-category.**\n*   **Objects:** The objects are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$.\n*   **1-morphisms:** A morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-morphisms:** For two parallel morphisms $f, h: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism from $f$ to $h$ exists if and only if $f \\le h$ in the pointwise order. That is, $f(i) \\le h(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the definition of an internal adjunction.**\nWe are looking for adjunctions from $[m]=[23]$ to $[n]=[37]$. An adjunction consists of a pair of order-preserving maps:\n*   $f: [23] \\to [37]$ (the left adjoint)\n*   $g: [37] \\to [23]$ (the right adjoint)\n\nAnd two 2-morphisms (which are inequalities in this context):\n*   The unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_{[23]} \\to g \\circ f$. This means $\\text{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (g \\circ f)(i)$ for all $i \\in [23]$, which simplifies to $i \\le g(f(i))$.\n*   The counit $\\epsilon: f \\circ g \\to \\text{id}_{[37]}$. This means $(f \\circ g)(j) \\le \\text{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$, which simplifies to $f(g(j)) \\le j$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of pairs of order-preserving maps $(f, g)$ satisfying these two conditions. This pair of conditions defines a Galois connection between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps.**\nThe two conditions $i \\le g(f(i))$ and $f(g(j)) \\le j$ are equivalent to the more common definition of a Galois connection:\n$f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ for all $i \\in [23]$ and $j \\in [37]$.\n\nThis equivalence implies that each of $f$ and $g$ uniquely determines the other.\n*   Given $g$, $f$ must be given by $f(i) = \\min \\{j \\in [37] \\mid i \\le g(j)\\}$. For this to be well-defined, the set must be non-empty for all $i \\in [23]$. This is true if and only if it holds for the largest element, $i=23$. There must be some $j$ such that $23 \\le g(j)$. Since the codomain of $g$ is $[23]$, this requires $g(j)=23$. As $g$ is order-preserving, this implies $g(37)=23$.\n*   Given $f$, $g$ must be given by $g(j) = \\max \\{i \\in [23] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$. For this to be well-defined, the set must be non-empty for all $j \\in [37]$. This is true if and only if it holds for the smallest element, $j=0$. There must be some $i$ such that $f(i) \\le 0$. Since the codomain of $f$ is $[37]$, this requires $f(i)=0$. As $f$ is order-preserving, this implies $f(0)=0$.\n\nThis can also be seen from the perspective of categorical adjunctions between posets viewed as categories. A functor between posets is an order-preserving map. An order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). In a finite total order like $[m]$, any order-preserving map preserves non-empty joins. For $f$ to preserve all joins, it must also preserve the empty join, which is the bottom element. Thus, $f(0)=0$.\nSimilarly, an order-preserving map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). This requires that it preserves the empty meet, which is the top element. Thus, $g(n)=m$.\n\nSo, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ with $f(0)=0$, which is also equal to the number of order-preserving maps $g: [37] \\to [23]$ with $g(37)=23$. We can use either to find the answer.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of such maps.**\nLet's count the number of order-preserving maps $g: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $g(37)=23$.\nAn order-preserving map $g: [37] \\to [23]$ is a sequence $(g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(37))$ such that $0 \\le g(0) \\le g(1) \\le \\dots \\le g(37) \\le 23$.\nThe condition $g(37)=23$ reduces the problem to counting the number of sequences $(g(0), \\dots, g(36))$ such that $0 \\le g(0) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le 23$.\nThis is precisely the number of order-preserving maps from $[36]$ to $[23]$.\n\nThe number of order-preserving maps from $[k]$ to $[l]$ is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{(l+1) + (k+1) - 1}{k+1} = \\binom{l+k+1}{k+1}$, which can be visualized using stars and bars.\nIn our case, $k=36$ and $l=23$. The number of maps is:\n$\\binom{23 + 36 + 1}{36 + 1} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have:\n$\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n*Alternative check:*\nLet's count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ with $f(0)=0$.\nThis is a sequence $(f(0), \\dots, f(23))$ with $0 \\le f(0) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$ and $f(0)=0$.\nWe need to count sequences $(f(1), \\dots, f(23))$ where $0 \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\nThis is the number of order-preserving maps from a set of 23 elements (say, $\\{1, \\dots, 23\\}$) to $[37]=\\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$. We can re-index the domain to be $[22]$. This is equivalent to counting order-preserving maps from $[22]$ to $[37]$.\nHere, $k=22$ and $l=37$. The number of maps is:\n$\\binom{37 + 22 + 1}{22 + 1} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\nThe results match, confirming our reasoning.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<60!/(23!*37!)>>>"
