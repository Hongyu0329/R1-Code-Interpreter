    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe problem asks us to perform two main tasks:\n1.  Analyze the differential equation `x'(t) = -x³(t) + 2x²(t) - x(t)` to find the number of stable equilibrium points. Let this number be `m`.\n2.  Calculate the value of the expression `m - 2^4048`.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points.**\n\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) of the system are the values of `x` for which `x'(t) = 0`.\nLet `f(x) = -x³ + 2x² - x`. We need to solve the equation `f(x) = 0`.\n\n$$ -x³ + 2x² - x = 0 $$\n\nWe can factor out `-x` from the expression:\n$$ -x(x² - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\n\nThe quadratic term `x² - 2x + 1` is a perfect square, `(x - 1)²`. So the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x - 1)² = 0 $$\n\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of `x` that make either factor equal to zero:\n*   `-x = 0 \\implies x = 0`\n*   `(x - 1)² = 0 \\implies x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1`\n\nSo, the equilibrium points are `x = 0` and `x = 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\n\nThe stability of an equilibrium point `x*` can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of `f(x)`, denoted `f'(x)`, at that point.\n*   If `f'(x*) < 0`, the equilibrium is **stable**.\n*   If `f'(x*) > 0`, the equilibrium is **unstable**.\n*   If `f'(x*) = 0`, the test is inconclusive, and further analysis is required.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of `f(x)`:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x³ + 2x² - x) = -3x² + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point `x = 0`:**\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)² + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since `f'(0) = -1 < 0`, the equilibrium point `x = 0` is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point `x = 1`:**\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)² + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since `f'(1) = 0`, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method to determine the stability of `x = 1`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stability of `x = 1` using the sign of `f(x)`.**\n\nWe analyze the sign of `f(x) = -x(x - 1)²` in the neighborhood of `x = 1`. The sign of `f(x)` tells us the direction of change of `x(t)`.\n*   If `f(x) > 0`, then `x'(t) > 0`, so `x(t)` is increasing.\n*   If `f(x) < 0`, then `x'(t) < 0`, so `x(t)` is decreasing.\n\nLet's examine the sign of `f(x)` on either side of `x = 1`.\nThe term `(x-1)²` is always positive for any `x ≠ 1`.\nThe term `-x` is negative for `x > 0`.\n\n*   **For `x` slightly greater than 1** (e.g., `x = 1.1`): `f(x) = -(\\text{positive}) \\times (\\text{positive})² = \\text{negative}`.\n    Since `f(x) < 0`, `x(t)` is decreasing. This means solutions starting to the right of 1 will move towards 1.\n\n*   **For `x` slightly less than 1** (e.g., `x = 0.9`): `f(x) = -(\\text{positive}) \\times (\\text{positive})² = \\text{negative}`.\n    Since `f(x) < 0`, `x(t)` is decreasing. This means solutions starting to the left of 1 will move away from 1 (towards 0).\n\nAn equilibrium point is only stable if solutions from *both* sides converge to it. Since solutions starting to the left of `x=1` move away from it, `x=1` is an **unstable** equilibrium point. (This type of point is more specifically called semi-stable, which falls under the general category of unstable points).\n\n**Step 4: Find `m`, the number of stable equilibrium points.**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   `x = 0` is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   `x = 1` is an unstable equilibrium point.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point. The number of stable equilibrium points is `m = 1`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression.**\n\nWe are asked to find the value of `m - 2^4048`.\nSubstituting `m = 1`:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Finding all equilibrium points:** It is crucial to correctly factor the polynomial `f(x)` to find all its roots. In this case, `x=0` and `x=1` are the only two.\n2.  **Definition of Stability:** The sign of the first derivative `f'(x)` is the standard test. A negative sign implies stability.\n3.  **Inconclusive Test:** When `f'(x*) = 0`, the first derivative test fails. It is essential to use another method, such as analyzing the sign of `f(x)` around the equilibrium point (phase line analysis) or using higher-order derivatives.\n4.  **Interpretation of Semi-Stable:** An equilibrium point that is attracting from one side and repelling from the other (semi-stable) is not considered stable in the formal sense (Lyapunov stability). Therefore, it should be counted as unstable.\n5.  **Interpreting the Question:** The phrase \"m is a number of stable equilibrium\" is interpreted in the standard mathematical sense as \"m is the count/quantity of stable equilibrium points\", which means `m` is an integer.\n\n### **Final Answer Calculation**\n\n*   Number of stable equilibrium points: `m = 1`.\n*   Expression to evaluate: `m - 2^4048`.\n*   Result: `1 - 2^4048`.\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
