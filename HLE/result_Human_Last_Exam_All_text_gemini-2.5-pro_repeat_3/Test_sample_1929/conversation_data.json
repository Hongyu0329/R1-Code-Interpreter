    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene.** Its chemical formula is C₄H₆, and its structure is CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. This molecule is a conjugated diene, meaning it has two double bonds separated by a single bond. It will act as the \"diene\" component in the reaction.\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.** Its chemical formula is C₂Cl₂F₂, and its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This molecule is an alkene (a molecule with a carbon-carbon double bond) and will act as the \"dienophile\" (diene-lover).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a specific type of pericyclic reaction known as a [4+2] cycloaddition. The \"4\" refers to the four pi (π) electrons from the diene, and the \"2\" refers to the two π electrons from the dienophile. This reaction forms a new six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the Mechanism and Product Formation**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted process, meaning all bond-making and bond-breaking occurs in a single step through a cyclic transition state.\n1.  **Align Reactants:** The butadiene molecule must be in its less stable *s-cis* conformation (where both double bonds are on the same side of the central single bond) to react.\n2.  **Electron Flow:** Three π bonds are broken (two in the diene, one in the dienophile), and two new sigma (σ) bonds and one new π bond are formed.\n    *   The π electrons from the C1-C2 double bond of butadiene form a new σ bond with the C2 of the dienophile (the one with the fluorine atoms).\n    *   The π electrons from the dienophile's double bond form a new σ bond with the C4 of butadiene.\n    *   The π electrons from the C3-C4 double bond of butadiene move to form a new π bond between C2 and C3.\n3.  **Resulting Structure:** This process creates a six-membered ring known as a cyclohexene derivative.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Final Product Structure**\nLet's trace the atoms to build the final product:\n*   The backbone of the product is a six-membered ring.\n*   A double bond exists within the ring between the carbons that were originally C2 and C3 of butadiene.\n*   The carbons that were C1 and C4 of butadiene are now part of the ring as -CH₂- groups.\n*   The carbons from the dienophile are now part of the ring and retain their substituents. One carbon is attached to two chlorine atoms (-CCl₂-), and the adjacent carbon is attached to two fluorine atoms (-CF₂-).\n\nThe connectivity will be as follows:\nA cyclohexene ring where the carbons of the original dienophile (CCl₂ and CF₂) are adjacent to each other.\n\n```\n       CH=CH\n      /     \\\n    H₂C       CH₂\n     |         |\n    C(F₂) --- C(Cl₂)\n```\n\n**Step 4: Name the Product using IUPAC Nomenclature**\n1.  The parent ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so it is a **cyclohexene**.\n2.  Number the ring carbons to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers, which will be C1 and C2.\n3.  Number the rest of the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (positions).\n    *   **Path A:** If we number so the -CCl₂- group is on C4 and the -CF₂- group is on C5, the locants are 4,4,5,5.\n    *   **Path B:** If we number so the -CF₂- group is on C4 and the -CCl₂- group is on C5, the locants are also 4,4,5,5.\n4.  Since both numbering paths yield the same set of locants, we use alphabetical order as a tie-breaker. \"Dichloro\" comes before \"difluoro\" alphabetically. Therefore, the dichloro group is given the lower number.\n5.  The correct name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Regiochemistry:** When both the diene and dienophile are unsymmetrical, multiple products (regioisomers) are possible. In this case, the dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂) is unsymmetrical, but the diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical. Therefore, regardless of how the dienophile orients itself relative to the diene, only one product is formed.\n2.  **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the reactants is preserved in the product. This is not a factor here since the dienophile does not have *cis/trans* isomers and no new chiral centers are created in the product.\n3.  **Reaction Conditions:** Diels-Alder reactions are typically favored by heat. The dienophile is considered \"activated\" because the electron-withdrawing halogen atoms (Cl and F) make its π bond electron-poor, increasing its reactivity towards the electron-rich diene.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a single product. The product is a cyclohexene derivative with the substituents from the dienophile retained on adjacent carbons. Based on IUPAC nomenclature rules, the product is named **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
