    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice, starting from a fixed origin. Let's denote this number by `a(n)`.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Definition of the problem:**\n    *   **Lattice:** A 2D square grid of points (x, y) where x and y are integers. This is also known as a Manhattan lattice.\n    *   **Walk:** A sequence of points starting at the origin (0,0). Each subsequent point is reached by taking a single step of length 1 either up, down, left, or right.\n    *   **n-step walk:** A walk consisting of n steps.\n    *   **Self-avoiding:** The walk never visits the same point more than once.\n\n2.  **Calculation for small values of n:**\n    *   **a(0):** A 0-step walk consists of only the starting point. There is only one such walk. `a(0) = 1`.\n    *   **a(1):** From the origin, we can take one step in 4 possible directions (Up, Down, Left, Right). All are valid.\n        `a(1) = 4`.\n    *   **a(2):** For each of the 4 possible first steps, the second step cannot reverse the first step (as that would revisit the origin). This leaves 3 valid choices for the second step.\n        `a(2) = a(1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12`.\n    *   **a(3):** For any 2-step walk, the endpoint is at a Manhattan distance of 2 from the origin. For example, `(0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)` or `(0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)`. A single third step cannot reach the origin from such an endpoint. Therefore, the only constraint on the third step is that it cannot reverse the second step. This again leaves 3 valid choices.\n        `a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36`.\n\n3.  **The complication at n=4:**\n    *   The simple pattern `a(n) = a(n-1) * 3` breaks down at `n=4`. We must check if the 4th step can land on a previously visited point (other than the point from which the step is being taken).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Consider a 3-step walk that forms a \"C\" shape, for example, `Right -> Up -> Left`. The sequence of points is `(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1)`.\n    *   From the endpoint `v3 = (0,1)`, a fourth step has 4 potential destinations: `(1,1)`, `(-1,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(0,0)`.\n        *   The move to `(1,1)` is backward to `v2`, which is forbidden.\n        *   The move to `(0,0)` is a visit to the starting point `v0`, which is also forbidden for a self-avoiding walk.\n    *   This means that for this specific path, there are only **2** valid choices for the fourth step, not 3.\n\n4.  **Systematic calculation of a(4):**\n    *   To find `a(4)`, we must account for the paths that restrict the number of next moves.\n    *   Out of the 36 paths of length 3, one can determine through careful counting (or by symmetry) that there are 8 paths that form this restrictive \"C\" shape. Each of these 8 paths has only 2 valid extensions.\n    *   The remaining `36 - 8 = 28` paths of length 3 do not have this issue, and each has 3 valid extensions.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of 4-step walks is:\n        `a(4) = (8 paths * 2 extensions) + (28 paths * 3 extensions) = 16 + 84 = 100`.\n\n5.  **Finding a(10):**\n    *   The method of classifying path shapes and counting their possible extensions becomes combinatorially very difficult for larger `n`. Calculating `a(10)` by hand is not feasible.\n    *   This is a well-known unsolved problem in mathematics in the sense that there is no simple closed-form formula for `a(n)`.\n    *   However, the values of `a(n)` have been computed for many `n` using powerful computers. We can use these established results.\n    *   The sequence of `a(n)` is:\n        *   `a(1) = 4`\n        *   `a(2) = 12`\n        *   `a(3) = 36`\n        *   `a(4) = 100`\n        *   `a(5) = 284`\n        *   `a(6) = 780`\n        *   `a(7) = 2,172`\n        *   `a(8) = 5,916`\n        *   `a(9) = 16,268`\n        *   `a(10) = 44,100`\n\nThe number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
