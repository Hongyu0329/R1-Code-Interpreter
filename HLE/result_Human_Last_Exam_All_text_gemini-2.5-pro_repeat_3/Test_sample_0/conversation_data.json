    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nA **Critical-Level View** is a principle in population ethics used to evaluate the goodness of different populations. It states that the value of a population is the sum of each individual's welfare level minus a \"critical level\" (let's call it *c*).\n\n*   **Formula:** Value = Σ (uᵢ - c), where uᵢ is the welfare of person *i*, and *c* is the positive critical level.\n*   **Key Implication:** Adding a new person to the world is only a good thing if their welfare level is *above* the critical level *c*. If their welfare *u* is positive but below *c* (0 < u < c), adding them is considered bad because it lowers the total value (since u - c is negative).\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's theorem shows that it's impossible for any population axiology to satisfy a set of seemingly desirable conditions simultaneously. Let's analyze each condition given in the answer choices.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This principle relates to equality. A simple version states that for a population of a fixed size, a more equal distribution of welfare is better than a less equal one, holding other things (like the total welfare) constant. Critical-level views focus on the sum, not the distribution. In same-number comparisons, a critical-level view `Σ(uᵢ - c)` behaves just like total utilitarianism `Σuᵢ`, as the `n*c` term is constant. Total utilitarianism is neutral about equality, so it doesn't violate this principle (it is merely indifferent). Thus, critical-level views are generally considered compatible with weak forms of this principle.\n\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This is a complex principle stating that a small welfare loss for some well-off people can be compensated by adding a sufficient number of people at a low but positive welfare level. Since critical-level views are aggregative (they sum up values), they generally allow for these kinds of trade-offs and satisfy this condition.\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This principle states that for any two positive welfare levels, a high one (*x*) and a lower one (*y*), a single life at level *x* cannot be better than *any* number of lives at level *y*. In other words, there must be some number (*k*) of lives at the lower level *y* that is at least as good as the one life at the high level *x*. This prevents giving \"elite\" status to very high welfare levels.\n\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This is a very basic principle. It states that a population where everyone has positive welfare is better than a population of the same size where everyone has negative welfare. A critical-level view easily satisfies this. If `x > 0` and `y < 0`, then `x > y`. The value for `n` people at `x` is `n*(x-c)` and for `n` people at `y` is `n*(y-c)`. Since `x > y`, it follows that `n*(x-c) > n*(y-c)`. So, this condition is satisfied.\n\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This principle states that adding a person with a sufficiently high positive welfare level can make a population better. For a critical-level view, as long as we add a person whose welfare `u` is greater than the critical level `c` (`u > c`), the total value of the population increases. Therefore, this condition is satisfied.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Violated Condition\n\nNow let's see which condition a critical-level view violates. The key is the **Non-Elitism** principle.\n\nLet's test it with an example:\n*   Assume a critical-level view with a critical level `c = 10`.\n*   Choose a high welfare level, `x = 20`.\n*   Choose a lower, but still positive, welfare level, `y = 5`.\n*   According to the critical-level view, the value of one life at welfare `x=20` is `20 - c = 20 - 10 = 10`.\n*   The value of *k* lives at welfare `y=5` is `k * (5 - c) = k * (5 - 10) = -5k`.\n\nThe Non-Elitism principle requires that we can find some number of people, *k*, such that the population of *k* people at level 5 is at least as good as the one person at level 20.\n*   Is it possible that `-5k ≥ 10`?\n*   This inequality would mean `k ≤ -2`.\n\nSince *k* must be a positive number of people, there is **no** possible value of *k* that can satisfy this. The value of adding people at welfare level 5 is always negative, so adding more of them only makes the population worse. One person at welfare 20 will always be judged as better than any number of people at welfare 5.\n\nThis is a direct violation of the Non-Elitism condition. The critical-level view creates an \"elite\" group of lives (those with welfare > c) that can outweigh any number of lives from the non-elite group (those with 0 < welfare ≤ c).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCritical-level views satisfy Weak Quality Addition, Weak Non-Sadism, and other common principles, but they fail the Non-Elitism condition because a single life above the critical level can be considered better than an arbitrarily large number of lives with positive welfare below the critical level.\n\n<<<C>>>"
