    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the upper bound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terminology**\n\n    *   **Squarefree natural numbers (N):** This indicates that we are working with quadratic number fields, which are extensions of the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 2. For a squarefree natural number $N$, we can form either a real quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ or an imaginary quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$. In both scenarios, the degree of the field is $n=2$.\n\n    *   **Covolume (V):** In the context of number fields, we consider the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of the field $K$. The ring of integers can be embedded into a real vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ via the Minkowski embedding. The image of $\\mathcal{O}_K$ under this embedding forms a full-rank lattice, let's call it $L$. The covolume $(V)$ is the volume of the fundamental parallelotope of this lattice $L$, i.e., $V = \\text{vol}(\\mathbb{R}^n/L)$. For a number field $K$ with $r_1$ real embeddings and $r_2$ pairs of complex conjugate embeddings ($n = r_1 + 2r_2$), the covolume of the lattice of integers is given by the formula $V = 2^{-r_2}\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$, where $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the field. For quadratic fields, $n=2$.\n\n    *   **Maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$):** This is the most technical part of the question.\n        *   The subscript $\\infty$ typically refers to the Archimedean places, which correspond to the embeddings into $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$. This suggests a norm on the Minkowski space $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n        *   \"Maximum norm\" is the common name for the $L_\\infty$-norm on a vector space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. For a vector $x = (x_1, ..., x_n)$, this norm is $||x||_\\infty = \\max(|x_1|, ..., |x_n|)$.\n        *   The notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ likely refers to a specific value associated with the lattice $L$ derived from the field $K$. A fundamental characteristic of a lattice is the length of its shortest non-zero vector. This is called the first successive minimum, denoted $\\lambda_1$.\n        *   Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that $k_{k,\\infty}$ represents the first successive minimum of the lattice $L = \\sigma(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ with respect to the $L_\\infty$-norm. That is, $k_{k,\\infty} = \\lambda_1 = \\min \\{||\\sigma(\\alpha)||_\\infty : \\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K, \\alpha \\neq 0 \\}$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Mathematical Tool**\n\n    The problem asks for an upper bound on the length of the shortest non-zero vector in a lattice, given its covolume. This is a classic problem in the Geometry of Numbers, and the fundamental tool to solve it is Minkowski's First Theorem on convex bodies.\n\n    **Minkowski's First Theorem:** Let $L$ be a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with covolume $V$. Let $C$ be a convex, 0-symmetric subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. If the volume of $C$ satisfies $\\text{vol}(C) \\ge 2^n V$, then $C$ must contain at least one non-zero vector from the lattice $L$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Theorem to the Problem**\n\n    *   We want to find an upper bound for $\\lambda_1$, the $L_\\infty$-norm of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice $L = \\sigma(\\mathcal{O}_K)$.\n    *   The appropriate convex body for the $L_\\infty$-norm is the n-dimensional hypercube, defined as $C_1 = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : ||x||_\\infty \\le 1\\} = [-1, 1]^n$. This body is convex and 0-symmetric.\n    *   The volume of this hypercube is $\\text{vol}(C_1) = 2^n$.\n    *   Let's consider a scaled hypercube $C_\\lambda = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : ||x||_\\infty \\le \\lambda\\} = [-\\lambda, \\lambda]^n$. Its volume is $\\text{vol}(C_\\lambda) = (2\\lambda)^n$.\n    *   According to Minkowski's theorem, if we choose $\\lambda$ such that $\\text{vol}(C_\\lambda) \\ge 2^n V$, the existence of a non-zero lattice vector within $C_\\lambda$ is guaranteed.\n    *   Let's set $(2\\lambda)^n = 2^n V$.\n    *   This equation simplifies to $\\lambda^n = V$, which gives $\\lambda = V^{1/n}$.\n    *   This result means that the hypercube of side length $2V^{1/n}$ is guaranteed to contain a non-zero lattice vector. The $L_\\infty$-norm of any vector in this hypercube is at most $V^{1/n}$.\n    *   Therefore, the norm of the shortest non-zero vector, $\\lambda_1$, must be less than or equal to this value: $\\lambda_1 \\le V^{1/n}$.\n\n4.  **Specialize for Quadratic Fields**\n\n    *   The question specifies that we are dealing with fields derived from squarefree natural numbers $N$. These are all quadratic fields, for which the degree is $n=2$.\n    *   Substituting $n=2$ into the general bound derived in the previous step gives:\n        $\\lambda_1 \\le V^{1/2}$\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**\n\n    The upper bound for the maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$), interpreted as the first successive minimum of the integer lattice with respect to the $L_\\infty$-norm, in relation to the covolume $V$ for quadratic fields is $\\sqrt{V}$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ is given by the expression $V^{1/n}$. Since the problem deals with squarefree natural numbers $(N)$, we are considering quadratic fields, for which the degree $n=2$. Therefore, the upper bound is $V^{1/2}$.\n\n<<<V^(1/2)>>>"
