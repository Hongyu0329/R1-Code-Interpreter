    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of the Question:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 1: \"Andrei Voznesensky called this man 'a joy-discovering sailor'...\"**\n    *   **The Author:** Andrei Voznesensky was a famous Russian poet. This immediately places the context within Russian culture and history.\n    *   **The Description:** \"a joy-discovering sailor\" (мореплаватель, открывающий радость) is a poetic phrase. It suggests an explorer, someone who traveled by sea, and whose mission was associated with something positive or romantic, not just conquest.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 2: \"...and wondered, 'Where is your grave, even a mound?'\"**\n    *   This is a direct quote from a poem. The central theme is a lost or unknown burial place. The subject of the poem must be a historical figure whose grave was destroyed, lost, or never found for a long period.\n    *   Combining this with the first clue, we are looking for a famous Russian explorer whose final resting place was a mystery.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 3: \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"**\n    *   This provides a specific timeframe. The mystery of the grave was solved, or significant information about it was discovered, around 1987-1989. This could refer to an archaeological discovery or a major historical re-evaluation during the period of Glasnost in the Soviet Union.\n\n**Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n\n1.  **Connecting the Clues:** The clues point directly to the subject of Voznesensky's most famous narrative work, the rock opera **\"Juno and Avos\"** («Юнона и Авось»). The libretto (lyrics) for this opera was written by Voznesensky.\n2.  **Identifying the Protagonist:** The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer **Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov** (1764–1807). He fits the description of a \"sailor\" perfectly, having led an expedition to California on behalf of the Russian-American Company. His romantic story with Concepción Argüello in California is the \"joy-discovering\" element that Voznesensky poeticized.\n3.  **Verifying the Lost Grave:** Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 while returning from his expedition. He was buried there, but his tombstone and the cemetery itself were destroyed by the Soviet authorities in the 20th century. For decades, the exact location of his grave was lost, perfectly matching Voznesensky's line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n4.  **Verifying the Timeline:** The premiere of \"Juno and Avos\" in 1981 created a massive cultural wave and revived interest in Rezanov's story. This interest peaked in the late 1980s during Glasnost, when rediscovering lost history became a national preoccupation. It was during this period that historical investigations and public discussions effectively \"answered\" the question of his fate and resting place for the general public, even if a formal monument was erected later. The process of finding the answer truly emerged in the public consciousness in the late 1980s.\n\nTherefore, all clues point to one man. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
