    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Understand and Visualize the Feynman Diagram\n\nThe question describes a Feynman diagram with the following properties:\n*   **Two vertices:** These are the points where interactions occur. Let's call them $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n*   **Four field contractions:** In a Feynman diagram, field contractions are represented by lines (propagators). These four lines connect the vertices. Since there are only two vertices, all four lines must connect $v_1$ to $v_2$.\n\nThis describes a vacuum bubble diagram. Topologically, it consists of two nodes connected by four parallel edges.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Symmetry Factor (S)\n\nIn Quantum Field Theory, the value of a Feynman diagram is calculated by an integral expression multiplied by a numerical prefactor. This prefactor includes factors from the perturbative expansion (like $1/n!$) and from the interaction Lagrangian (e.g., $1/k!$ for a $\\phi^k$ interaction). The symmetry factor, $S$, is a final combinatorial correction that accounts for the indistinguishability of internal lines and vertices. It is defined as the number of permutations of the internal components (lines and vertices) that leave the diagram topologically unchanged.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Symmetries of the Diagram\n\nWe need to count the number of ways we can rearrange the internal parts of the diagram without altering its structure.\n\n1.  **Symmetry from Permuting Lines:**\n    *   The diagram has four lines connecting the two vertices.\n    *   These lines are internal and represent the same type of particle propagator. Therefore, they are indistinguishable from each other.\n    *   We can permute these four lines among themselves in any order, and the diagram will look exactly the same.\n    *   The number of ways to permute four distinct items is $4!$ (4-factorial).\n    *   $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n\n2.  **Symmetry from Permuting Vertices:**\n    *   The diagram has two vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n    *   In a perturbative expansion, these vertices typically arise from the same interaction term in the Lagrangian (e.g., two $\\phi^4$ interactions). Therefore, the vertices are also indistinguishable.\n    *   We can swap the position of vertex $v_1$ with vertex $v_2$, and the diagram remains topologically identical (the four lines that connected $v_1$ to $v_2$ will now connect $v_2$ to $v_1$, which is the same structure).\n    *   The number of ways to permute these two vertices is $2!$.\n    *   $2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor\n\nThe total symmetry factor $S$ is the product of the number of possible permutations for each independent set of symmetric components. The permutations of the lines are independent of the permutations of the vertices.\n\n*   $S = (\\text{Number of line permutations}) \\times (\\text{Number of vertex permutations})$\n*   $S = 4! \\times 2!$\n*   $S = 24 \\times 2$\n*   $S = 48$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Indistinguishability:** The core concept is the indistinguishability of identical internal components. If the lines or vertices were of different types, the symmetry would be reduced.\n*   **Independence of Symmetries:** It is crucial that the counted symmetries are independent. Swapping the vertices is a distinct operation from re-arranging the lines that connect them.\n*   **External Lines:** This diagram is a vacuum bubble and has no external lines. If there were external lines attached to the vertices, it could break the symmetry. For example, if $v_1$ had an external line attached but $v_2$ did not, we could no longer swap them. In this case, there are no external lines, so the full symmetry is present.\n*   **Analogy:** This diagram is a direct analogue of the \"sunset diagram,\" which has two vertices connected by three lines. The sunset diagram's symmetry factor is $S = 3! \\times 2! = 12$. Our problem simply extends this to four lines, logically leading to $S = 4! \\times 2!$.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the symmetry factor is the product of the permutations of the four identical lines and the two identical vertices.\n\n$S = 4! \\times 2! = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
