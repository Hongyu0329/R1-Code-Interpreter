    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core of the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character in Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying detail is a unique emotional confession: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This points to a moment of dialogue where a character reveals their deep-seated homesickness and the psychological toll of their mission.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Emotion and its Context**\nThe feeling is not just simple nostalgia, but *shame* associated with it. This is a crucial detail. A character feeling this would likely be someone who embarked on a grand, scientific, or exploratory mission, believing they were pursuing a higher purpose. The shame comes from the realization that despite their lofty goals of cosmic exploration, they are still bound by simple, terrestrial, human needs. It's an admission that their grand ambition feels defeated by a basic longing for home.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Character Based on this Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist, a psychologist sent to the Solaris station. The film heavily uses flashbacks and imagery of his home on Earth to contrast with the sterile station. While he certainly feels a connection to Earth, he is a newcomer to the station. The deep-seated, long-term weariness and shame described in the question is more likely to be felt by someone who has been there for a much longer time.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** Hari is a \"guest,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his deceased wife, created by the sentient ocean of Solaris. She has no authentic experience or memory of Earth herself. Her entire existence is confined to the station and Kris's psyche. Therefore, she could not miss something she has never known.\n\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** Snaut is one of the two surviving scientists Kris meets on the station. He has been there for a long time and has become cynical and philosophical about their situation. He often serves as the film's voice of reason and despair, explaining the psychological effects of Solaris. It is very much in his character to reflect on the failure of their mission in such human terms. The feeling of shame for being reduced to such \"primitive\" nostalgia fits his world-weary and introspective personality.\n\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** Sartorius is the other surviving scientist. He is depicted as cold, clinical, and obsessed with a purely scientific approach to the Solaris phenomenon. He is emotionally detached and tries to suppress the human element, viewing the \"guests\" as objects of study. It is highly unlikely that he would voice such a vulnerable, poetic, and emotional sentiment. He would likely see such feelings as a weakness to be overcome, not something to confess.\n\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Gibarian is the scientist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. Kris watches his final video message, but Gibarian's state is one of utter despair and warning. While he clearly succumbed to the psychological pressure, we don't have a specific dialogue from him expressing this particular feeling of shame about missing nature.\n\n**Step 4: Recall or Verify the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nIn a key conversation with Kris in the station's library, Dr. Snaut delivers a monologue about humanity's purpose in space. He says, \"We don't want other worlds. We want a mirror.\" He explains that their mission is a failure because they were not prepared to confront themselves. In this context, he confesses his longing for simple, earthly things and explicitly mentions his shame over it. He feels ashamed that the great endeavor of space exploration has been undone by a simple, sentimental longing for the rustling of leaves, seeing it as a sign of human weakness and failure.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the character profiles and the specific dialogue in the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling is Dr. Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
