    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Graph:** We are considering a graph `G` with a vertex set `V` where `|V| = n = 128`.\n    *   **Induced Subgraph:** For any subset of vertices `W ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[W]` is the graph formed by the vertices in `W` and all the edges from `G` that connect pairs of vertices within `W`.\n    *   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is denoted `K_k`.\n    *   **Condition:** We are looking for \"different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs\". This means we are interested in the set of integers `k` for which there exists a subset of vertices `W` of size `k` such that the induced subgraph `G[W]` is a complete graph `K_k`.\n    *   **Objective:** We need to find a single graph `G` on 128 vertices that maximizes the number of such different values of `k`.\n\n2.  **Translating the Condition:**\n    The condition that an induced subgraph `G[W]` is a complete graph `K_k` is the very definition of `W` being a clique of size `k` in the graph `G`. So, the problem asks for the maximum size of the set `S(G) = {k | G has a clique of size k}`.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Set of Clique Sizes `S(G)`:**\n    *   Let `ω(G)` be the **clique number** of the graph `G`, which is defined as the size of the largest clique in `G`.\n    *   By definition, there exists at least one clique in `G` of size `ω(G)`. Let's call one such clique `C_{max}`.\n    *   Since `C_{max}` is a clique of size `ω(G)`, the number `ω(G)` is in our set `S(G)`.\n    *   Now, consider any integer `k` such that `1 ≤ k ≤ ω(G)`. We can choose any subset `W` of `C_{max}` such that `|W| = k`.\n    *   Because `C_{max}` is a clique, every pair of vertices in `C_{max}` is connected. This property also holds for any of its subsets. Therefore, `W` is also a clique, specifically a clique of size `k`.\n    *   This means that for every integer `k` from 1 to `ω(G)`, the graph `G` contains a clique of size `k`.\n    *   Furthermore, by the definition of `ω(G)`, there can be no clique of size larger than `ω(G)`.\n    *   Therefore, the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph `G` is precisely the set of integers `{1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`.\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Objective:**\n    The number of different clique sizes is the size of the set `S(G)`, which is `|{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}| = ω(G)`.\n    So, the problem is simplified to: What is the maximum possible clique number `ω(G)` for a graph `G` on 128 vertices?\n\n5.  **Finding the Maximum Clique Number:**\n    *   For any graph `G` with `n` vertices, its clique number `ω(G)` cannot be greater than `n`.\n    *   The maximum possible value `ω(G) = n` is achieved if the graph contains a clique of size `n`.\n    *   A graph on `n` vertices that is itself a clique is the **complete graph** `K_n`.\n    *   For `n = 128`, the complete graph `K_{128}` has a clique number of `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128. This is achieved by the complete graph on 128 vertices, `K_{128}`. In `K_{128}`, for any integer `k` between 1 and 128, any subset of `k` vertices forms a `K_k`, so it has induced cliques of all possible sizes from 1 to 128.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Induced Clique vs. Maximal Clique:** The most important point is not to confuse an \"induced subgraph that is a clique\" with a \"maximal clique\". The question does not require the cliques to be maximal. For instance, in a `K_{128}`, a clique of size 127 is an induced subgraph, but it is not a maximal clique because it is contained within the larger clique of size 128. If the question had asked for maximal clique sizes, the problem would be different and more complex, likely yielding a much smaller answer (the analysis for that case would lead to an answer of 15).\n*   **\"Simultaneously Appear\":** This phrase means that a single graph must possess all the properties. It does not imply that the vertex sets for the different sized cliques must be disjoint.\n*   **Structure of Clique Sizes:** The set of possible clique sizes in any graph is always a continuous interval of integers starting from 1 (i.e., `{1, 2, ..., k_{max}}`). It's impossible for a graph to have, for example, a `K_5` and a `K_7` without also having a `K_6`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The problem asks for the maximum number of different values `k` such that a graph `G` on 128 vertices has an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`.\n2.  This is equivalent to finding the maximum size of the set `S(G) = {k | G has a clique of size k}`.\n3.  The set of clique sizes in any graph `G` is `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`, where `ω(G)` is the size of the largest clique.\n4.  The size of this set is `ω(G)`.\n5.  The problem is reduced to finding `max ω(G)` for a graph `G` with 128 vertices.\n6.  The maximum clique size for a graph on `n` vertices is `n`, achieved by the complete graph `K_n`.\n7.  For `n = 128`, the maximum is 128, achieved by `K_{128}`.\n\n<<<128>>>"
