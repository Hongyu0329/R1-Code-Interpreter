    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the definitions from point-set topology and key theorems about continua.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question and Defining Terms\n\nThe question asks for the smallest number of composants in an indecomposable continuum, which is not necessarily metric.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected Hausdorff topological space. The \"not necessarily metric\" clause means we cannot assume the topology is induced by a distance function, although any result demonstrated with a metric continuum will also hold for the general case.\n*   **Component vs. Composant:** The question explicitly distinguishes between these.\n    *   A **component** of a space is a maximal connected subset. Since a continuum is itself connected, it has only one component: the entire space.\n    *   A **composant** is a more subtle concept. For a point `x` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `x`, denoted `C(x)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `x`. A **subcontinuum** is a subset that is also a continuum, and it is **proper** if it is not equal to the entire space `X`.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. That is, if `X = A ∪ B` where `A` and `B` are subcontinua, then either `A = X` or `B = X`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Properties of Composants in an Indecomposable Continuum\n\n1.  **Composants as Equivalence Classes:** The relation `x ~ y` if and only if there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both `x` and `y` is an equivalence relation on an indecomposable continuum. The equivalence classes of this relation are precisely the composants. This means the set of all composants of an indecomposable continuum forms a partition of the space; they are pairwise disjoint and their union is the entire space.\n\n2.  **Number of Composants > 1:** We can show that any indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant.\n    *   A continuum `X` is decomposable if and only if there is at least one point `x` for which the composant `C(x)` is the entire space `X`.\n    *   **Proof Sketch:** If `X` is decomposable, say `X = A ∪ B` with `A, B` proper subcontinua, then for any `x ∈ A ∩ B`, both `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua containing `x`. Any point in `X` is in either `A` or `B`, and thus is in a proper subcontinuum with `x`. Therefore, `C(x) = X`.\n    *   Conversely, if `C(x) = X` for some `x`, it means `X` is the union of all proper subcontinua containing `x`. By the compactness of `X`, it must be the union of a *finite* number of these proper subcontinua, say `X = A₁ ∪ A₂ ∪ ... ∪ Aₙ`. This can be shown to imply that `X` is the union of two proper subcontinua, making it decomposable.\n    *   Therefore, for a continuum `X` to be **indecomposable**, it must be the case that for every point `x ∈ X`, its composant `C(x)` is a proper subset of `X`.\n    *   Since the composants partition `X`, and no single composant can be all of `X`, there must be more than one composant.\n\n3.  **Conclusion of Step 2:** The number of composants in an indecomposable continuum must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Smallest Possible Number\n\nNow that we have established a lower bound of 2, the question becomes: does there exist an indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants?\n\n1.  **Historical Context and a Flawed Theorem:** For a long time, a famous theorem by the mathematician Stefan Mazurkiewicz was thought to have established that every *metric* indecomposable continuum has `c` (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., `2^ℵ₀`) composants. If this were true and applied to the general case, the answer would be very different.\n\n2.  **Resolution and Modern Results:** However, in the 1980s, an error was found in the proof of Mazurkiewicz's theorem. Subsequently, the mathematician Jan van Mill provided a definitive answer to the question of how many composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n    *   In 1982, van Mill constructed, for each integer `n ≥ 2`, an indecomposable *metric* continuum `Xₙ` that has precisely `n` composants. He also constructed examples with a countably infinite number of composants.\n\n3.  **Answering the Question:** Since van Mill successfully constructed an indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants, the lower bound of 2 is achievable. A metric continuum is a specific type of (not necessarily metric) continuum, so this example serves to answer the more general question.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis proceeds as follows:\n1.  An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. This sets the minimum possible number at 2.\n2.  The question of whether a continuum with exactly 2 composants can exist is an existence problem.\n3.  Constructions by Jan van Mill demonstrate that for any integer `n ≥ 2`, there exists an indecomposable (metric) continuum with exactly `n` composants.\n4.  Therefore, an indecomposable continuum with 2 composants exists.\n\nCombining these points, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
