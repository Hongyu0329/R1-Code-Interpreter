    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core task.**\nThe goal is to find the specific numbers imprinted on two different strengths (10mg and 20mg) of fluoxetine capsules manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals.\n\n**Step 2: Define the constraints and exclusions.**\nThe analysis must focus only on the imprinted numbers. It must explicitly exclude any mention of:\n*   Color differences between the capsules.\n*   The word \"PLIVA\", which may have been used on older versions of the medication.\n*   Differences in capsule size.\n\n**Step 3: Research the imprint on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule.**\nBy consulting reliable pharmaceutical databases (such as the FDA's National Drug Code Directory or Drugs.com), we can identify the specific markings on this capsule. The Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is imprinted with \"TEVA\" on one part and a number on the other part.\n*   **Careful Point:** The question specifically asks for the *number*, so the text \"TEVA\" should be disregarded for the final answer.\n*   **Finding:** The number imprinted on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is **3105**.\n\n**Step 4: Research the imprint on the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule.**\nUsing the same research methods, we identify the markings on the 20mg strength capsule from Teva. Similar to the 10mg version, it has \"TEVA\" on one part and a unique number on the other.\n*   **Careful Point:** Again, we must isolate only the numerical part of the imprint.\n*   **Finding:** The number imprinted on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is **3106**.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings to answer the question.**\nThe question asks for the \"different numbers\" between the two capsules. Based on the research:\n*   The 10mg capsule has the number **3105**.\n*   The 20mg capsule has the number **3106**.\nThese are the two different numbers that distinguish the strengths, fulfilling all the requirements of the prompt.\n\n<<<The number on the 10mg capsule is 3105, and the number on the 20mg capsule is 3106.>>>"
