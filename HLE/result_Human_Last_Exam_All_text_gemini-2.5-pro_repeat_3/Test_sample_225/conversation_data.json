    "An elegant problem that delves into the properties of Lissajous curves. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of self-intersection points.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Curve and its Properties**\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nThis is a classic example of a Lissajous curve, which has the general form x(t) = A sin(at + δ) and y(t) = B sin(bt). In our case, A=1, B=1, a=9, b=5, and the phase shift δ is π/2 (since cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2)).\n\nA self-intersection point occurs when the curve passes through the same physical point (x, y) at two or more different times. That is, we are looking for the number of distinct points (x₀, y₀) for which there exist at least two distinct time values, t₁ and t₂, such that:\n(x(t₁), y(t₁)) = (x(t₂), y(t₂)) = (x₀, y₀)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Period of the Curve**\nTo find all intersections, we need to consider the curve over one full period.\nThe period of the x-component, cos(9t), is Tₓ = 2π/9.\nThe period of the y-component, sin(5t), is Tᵧ = 2π/5.\nThe period of the entire curve is the least common multiple (LCM) of Tₓ and Tᵧ.\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1 / HCF(9, 5)) = 2π * (1/1) = 2π.\nSo, we need to find the number of self-intersections for t in an interval of length 2π, for example, t ∈ [0, 2π).\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Standard Formula for Lissajous Curves**\nFor Lissajous curves, there are well-established formulas to calculate the number of self-intersection points. The specific formula depends on the parameters 'a' and 'b' and the phase shift.\n\nThe parameters for our curve are a = 9 and b = 5.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Check if the parameters are coprime.**\n    The greatest common divisor of a and b is gcd(9, 5) = 1. So, they are coprime. This simplifies the problem, as the curve will be a single closed loop (non-degenerate).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Check the parity of the parameters.**\n    Both a = 9 and b = 5 are odd integers.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Select the correct formula.**\n    For a Lissajous curve of the form x = cos(at), y = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are coprime and both are odd integers, the number of self-intersection points (N) is given by the formula:\n    N = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Number of Self-Intersection Points**\nSubstitute the values of a = 9 and b = 5 into the formula:\nN = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nN = (8)(4) / 2\nN = 32 / 2\nN = 16\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe analysis based on the established formula provides a clear and direct answer. The curve has 16 distinct self-intersection points. An attempt to derive this from first principles by solving the system of trigonometric equations `cos(9t₁) = cos(9t₂)` and `sin(5t₁) = sin(5t₂)` is significantly more complex and prone to subtle errors related to counting points versus counting pairs of times, especially when points have different multiplicities (are crossed more than twice). The standard formula encapsulates the result of this complex analysis.\n\nThe number of self-intersection points for the curve is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
