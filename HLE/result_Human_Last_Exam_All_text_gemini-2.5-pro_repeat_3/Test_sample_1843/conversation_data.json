    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the Conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet Character\nAny Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a character modulo $p^k$.\n\nThere are two main conditions to satisfy:\n1.  **Primitivity:** A character $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n2.  **Order:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$. We require this to be 6.\n\nThis means that the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^k})$, must be a divisor of 6.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Component Character\nWe now count the number of valid choices for each component character. A character is primitive modulo $p^k$ if its conductor is exactly $p^k$. The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $m$ (if $d|m$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(d)$.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_4$ (modulo $2^2=4$):**\n    *   The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. The orders of characters can be 1 or 2.\n    *   A character is primitive mod 4 if its conductor is 4. The principal character has conductor 1. The other character, of order 2, has conductor 4.\n    *   So, $\\chi_4$ must be the unique primitive character of order 2.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1. Its order is 2.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_9$ (modulo $3^2=9$):**\n    *   The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. Orders can be 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   A character is primitive mod 9 if its conductor is not 1 or 3. Characters with conductor 1 or 3 are induced from characters modulo 3. The characters modulo 3 have orders 1 and 2.\n    *   Therefore, a primitive character modulo 9 must have an order that is not 1 or 2. The possible orders are 3 and 6. Both 3 and 6 are divisors of 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_9$: $2 + 2 = 4$. Its order will be 3 or 6.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_7$ (modulo 7):**\n    *   The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. Orders can be 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   A character is primitive mod 7 if it is not the principal character (which has conductor 1). So, the possible orders for primitive characters are 2, 3, and 6. All these orders divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_7$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_{11}$ (modulo 11):**\n    *   The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$.\n    *   The order of $\\chi_{11}$ must divide both 10 (the group order) and 6 (the required total order). Thus, its order must divide $\\text{gcd}(10, 6) = 2$.\n    *   For $\\chi_{11}$ to be primitive, its order cannot be 1. So, its order must be 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1. Its order is 2.\n\n*   **Component $\\chi_{13}$ (modulo 13):**\n    *   The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$.\n    *   The order of $\\chi_{13}$ must divide both 12 and 6. Thus, its order must divide $\\text{gcd}(12, 6) = 6$.\n    *   For $\\chi_{13}$ to be primitive, its order cannot be 1. Possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results and Verify the LCM\nLet the orders of the chosen components be $(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13})$. From our analysis:\n*   $d_4 = 2$\n*   $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_{11} = 2$\n*   $d_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nWe need to check if $\\text{lcm}(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13}) = 6$.\n*   The lcm must be divisible by 2, since $d_4=2$.\n*   The lcm must be divisible by 3, since $d_9$ is either 3 or 6.\n*   Since the lcm is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6.\n*   Since all individual orders are divisors of 6, their lcm cannot be greater than 6.\n\nTherefore, for any valid combination of component characters, the lcm of their orders is automatically 6.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component character:\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
