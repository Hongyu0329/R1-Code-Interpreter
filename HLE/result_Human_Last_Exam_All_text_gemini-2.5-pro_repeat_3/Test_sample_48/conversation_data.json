    "An analysis of the regular expression is required to determine the number of states in the minimal deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA).\n\nLet the given regular expression be $L$.\n$L = ( (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^* (b a | b b a | c a) )^* (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*$.\n\nLet's break down the expression into simpler parts:\nLet $S = (b | c)$. So $S^*$ is the set of all strings consisting of only 'b's and 'c's.\nLet $A = ( a | bc | cb | bbb )$. So $A^*$ is the language formed by concatenating strings from the set $\\{a, bc, cb, bbb\\}$.\nLet $T = ( ba | bba | ca )$. This is the set of strings $\\{ba, bba, ca\\}$.\n\nThe expression for the language $L$ can be written as:\n$L = ( S^* a A^* T )^* S^* a A^*$.\n\nLet $R = S^* a A^* T$ and $F = S^* a A^*$. Then $L = R^* F$.\nThis means a string is in $L$ if it is composed of zero or more blocks of type $R$, followed by one block of type $F$.\n\nWe will construct the minimal DFA by identifying the equivalence classes of strings under the Myhill-Nerode theorem. The state of the DFA will represent the set of possible futures for the string processed so far. The key is to identify what information about the prefix of a string we need to remember to decide if an arbitrary suffix can complete it into a string in $L$.\n\nThe structure of the language is determined by the occurrences of the symbol 'a' and the sequences of 'b's and 'c's between them.\n\nLet's define the states of the minimal DFA:\n1.  **State $q_0$ (Initial State)**: This state represents prefixes that do not contain any 'a'. These are strings in $S^* = (b|c)^*$. If we are in this state and read a 'b' or a 'c', we are still in $S^*$. So, there's a loop on $q_0$ for 'b' and 'c'. Reading an 'a' transitions us to a new state. This state is non-accepting as strings without 'a' are not in $L$.\n    $q_0 = [\\epsilon] = [w | w \\in S^*]$.\n\n2.  **State $q_1$ (Accepting State)**: This state is reached after reading an 'a' following a string that belongs to class $q_0$. This state represents prefixes that form a valid string in $L$ and can also be extended to form longer strings in $L$. Specifically, it represents strings that have just completed a component of the form $S^*aA^*$, which could be the final part of a string in $L$, or could be extended by another component from $A^*$. For example, the string 'a' (with $S^*=\\epsilon, A^*=\\epsilon$) leads to this state. Since 'a' is in $L$, $q_1$ is an accepting state.\n    -   $q_0 \\xrightarrow{a} q_1$.\n    -   If we are in $q_1$ and read an 'a', the string remains in $L$ because 'a' is a valid component of $A^*$. So, $q_1 \\xrightarrow{a} q_1$.\n    -   If we are in $q_1$ and read a 'b' or 'c', the resulting string is not in $L$ but is a prefix of other strings in $L$. This requires new states.\n\n3.  **State $q_2$**: This state is reached from $q_1$ on input 'b'. It represents prefixes that end in '...b' where the part before 'b' corresponds to state $q_1$. For example, after processing 'a', we are in $q_1$. Reading 'b' gets us to state $q_2$ (for the prefix 'ab'). This state is non-accepting.\n    -   $q_1 \\xrightarrow{b} q_2$.\n    -   From $q_2$ (e.g., prefix 'ab'), if we read 'c', we get 'abc'. 'bc' is in $A$, so 'a(bc)' is in $S^*aA^*$, which is in $L$. So we transition back to an accepting state, which is $q_1$. Thus, $q_2 \\xrightarrow{c} q_1$.\n    -   From $q_2$ (e.g., prefix 'ab'), if we read 'a', we get 'aba'. 'ba' is in $T$. So 'a(ba)' is a complete $R$-block ($S^*aA^*T$). After an $R$-block, we expect to see a string from $L=R^*F$ again. This means we are back at a state equivalent to the initial state, $q_0$. Thus, $q_2 \\xrightarrow{a} q_0$.\n    -   From $q_2$ (e.g., prefix 'ab'), if we read 'b', we get 'abb'. This could be a prefix of 'abbb' (from $A$) or 'abba' (from $T$). This requires a new state.\n\n4.  **State $q_3$**: This state is reached from $q_1$ on input 'c' (e.g., prefix 'ac'), or from $q_2$ on input 'b' (e.g., prefix 'abb').\n    -   We need to distinguish the state after '...b' ($q_2$) from the state after '...c'. Let's check if they are distinguishable.\n        -   From $q_2$ (prefix 'ab'): on 'b' we can form 'abb', which can be completed to 'abbb' $\\in L$ or 'abba' $\\in L$.\n        -   Let's define a state for prefixes ending in '...c' from $q_1$. Let this be $q_c$. (e.g., 'ac'). From 'ac', 'b' gives 'acb' ($cb \\in A$), which is in $L$. 'c' gives 'acc', which is not a prefix of any valid component in $A$ or $T$.\n    -   Let's check if we can merge states. Let's try to define states by the required suffix structure:\n        -   $q_0$: initial, need $S^*a...$\n        -   $q_1$: accepting, have $S^*aA^*$. Can continue with $A^*$ or $T$.\n        -   $q_b$: have $...b$. Need 'c' (for $bc \\in A$), 'b' (for $bbb \\in A$ or $bba \\in T$), or 'a' (for $ba \\in T$).\n        -   $q_c$: have $...c$. Need 'b' (for $cb \\in A$) or 'a' (for $ca \\in T$).\n        -   $q_{bb}$: have $...bb$. Need 'b' (for $bbb \\in A$) or 'a' (for $bba \\in T$).\n    -   Let's check if $q_c$ and $q_{bb}$ are equivalent.\n        -   From $q_c$: $a \\to q_0$ (completes $ca \\in T$), $b \\to q_1$ (completes $cb \\in A$), $c \\to$ sink.\n        -   From $q_{bb}$: $a \\to q_0$ (completes $bba \\in T$), $b \\to q_1$ (completes $bbb \\in A$), $c \\to$ sink.\n        -   Since they have the same transitions to the same future states, $q_c$ and $q_{bb}$ are equivalent.\n\n5.  **State $q_4$ (Sink State)**: For any input that leads to a string that cannot be a prefix of any string in $L$. For instance, from state $q_c$, reading a 'c'.\n\nBased on this analysis, the states are:\n-   $q_0$: Initial state for prefixes in $S^*$. Non-accepting.\n-   $q_1$: State for strings in $S^*aA^*$. Accepting.\n-   $q_2$: State for prefixes of the form $(S^*aA^*)b$. Non-accepting.\n-   $q_3$: State for prefixes of the form $(S^*aA^*)c$ or $(S^*aA^*)bb$. Non-accepting. (Since $q_c$ and $q_{bb}$ are equivalent).\n-   $q_4$: Sink state. Non-accepting.\n\nTotal number of states is 5.\n\nLet's write down the full transition table for this 5-state automaton:\nLet states be $\\{q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4\\}$, with $q_0$ initial and $q_1$ accepting.\n-   $\\delta(q_0, b) = q_0$\n-   $\\delta(q_0, c) = q_0$\n-   $\\delta(q_0, a) = q_1$\n\n-   $\\delta(q_1, a) = q_1$ (since $a \\in A$)\n-   $\\delta(q_1, b) = q_2$\n-   $\\delta(q_1, c) = q_3$\n\n-   $\\delta(q_2, a) = q_0$ (completes a $T$-word `ba`)\n-   $\\delta(q_2, b) = q_3$ (prefix `bb`)\n-   $\\delta(q_2, c) = q_1$ (completes an $A$-word `bc`)\n\n-   $\\delta(q_3, a) = q_0$ (completes a $T$-word `ca` or `bba`)\n-   $\\delta(q_3, b) = q_1$ (completes an $A$-word `cb` or `bbb`)\n-   $\\delta(q_3, c) = q_4$ (sink)\n\n-   $\\delta(q_4, a) = q_4$\n-   $\\delta(q_4, b) = q_4$\n-   $\\delta(q_4, c) = q_4$\n\nThis construction gives a DFA with 5 states. We have argued for the necessity of each state (except the sink state, which is standard) and showed that two potential states could be merged, suggesting this is minimal.\n\nFinal check of the states:\n- $q_0 = [(b|c)^*]$\n- $q_1 = [S^*aA^*]$ (Accepting)\n- $q_2 = [S^*aA^*b]$\n- $q_3 = [S^*aA^*c] \\cup [S^*aA^*bb]$\n- $q_4$ = All other non-prefix strings.\n\nThe number of states is 5."
