    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining \"Historical Saint\" in the Context of *Paradise Lost***\n\nFirst, we must establish what \"historical saint\" means for this question. John Milton was a 17th-century English Protestant. His view of sainthood differs significantly from the formal canonization process of the Roman Catholic Church. In Protestant theology, a \"saint\" is generally understood as any true believer or one of God's elect.\n\nFor the purpose of this analysis, a \"historical saint\" will be defined as:\n*   A specific, named individual (not an allegorical figure).\n*   A person considered historical within the Judeo-Christian tradition.\n*   A figure regarded as holy or a venerable exemplar of faith in major Christian traditions (including Old Testament patriarchs and prophets, who are considered saints in Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant thought).\n\n### **Step 2: Establishing the Search Criteria**\n\nBased on the question, we are looking for figures who meet the definition above and are explicitly **\"mentioned by name\"** within the poetic text of *Paradise Lost*. This means references by title alone (e.g., \"the Virgin,\" \"the Tishbite\") do not count if the person's proper name is not used.\n\n### **Step 3: Systematic Search of *Paradise Lost***\n\nWe will search the poem by categories of saints.\n\n**Category 1: Primordial Saints (The First Humans)**\n\n*   **Adam** and **Eve**: As the central human characters of the epic, they are mentioned by name countless times. They are the first to repent and receive the promise of salvation, making them the first human saints in the narrative. They are considered saints in some traditions, such as Eastern Orthodoxy.\n    *   *Count: 2 (Adam, Eve)*\n\n**Category 2: Old Testament Saints (Patriarchs and Prophets)**\n\nBooks XI and XII of *Paradise Lost* feature the Archangel Michael showing Adam a vision of future biblical history. Many Old Testament figures are named here.\n\n*   **Abel**: Mentioned by name in Book XI as the first martyr.\n*   **Enoch**: Mentioned by name in Book XI as the holy man \"translated\" to Heaven.\n*   **Noah**: Mentioned by name in Book XI as the just man who builds the ark.\n*   **Abraham**: Mentioned by name in Book XII as the \"Father of the Faithful.\"\n*   **Isaac**: Mentioned by name in Book XII as Abraham's son.\n*   **Jacob**: Mentioned by name in Book XII, also referred to by his other name, **Israel**.\n*   **Joseph**: Mentioned by name in Book XII in the context of the Israelites in Egypt.\n*   **Moses**: Mentioned by name in Book I and Book XII as the great lawgiver.\n*   **Joshua**: Mentioned by name in Book XII as Moses's successor who leads the tribes into Canaan.\n*   **David**: Mentioned by name in Book XII as the king from whose line the Messiah will come.\n\n*Careful Point*: Some OT figures are referenced but not named. For instance, **Elijah** is referenced as \"the great Tishbite\" (Book III) but not by his name. **Solomon** is named (Book I), but in the context of his later idolatry, making his status as a \"saint\" from Milton's perspective highly questionable. Therefore, he is excluded from the count.\n\n*   *Count for this category: 10*\n\n**Category 3: New Testament and Later Christian Saints**\n\nMilton's references to post-biblical saints are few and often critical, reflecting his anti-Catholic sentiments. They appear most prominently in Book III's description of the \"Paradise of Fools.\"\n\n*   **Peter**: Mentioned by name as \"Saint Peter\" in Book III, ironically depicted as guarding \"Heaven's wicket.\" He is an apostle and historical saint.\n*   **Dominic**: Mentioned by name in Book III in a critique of the Dominican order (\"weeds of Dominic\"). Saint Dominic is a historical saint.\n*   **Francis**: Mentioned by name in Book III in a critique of the Franciscan order (\"in Franciscan think to pass disguised\"). Saint Francis of Assisi is a historical saint.\n\n*Careful Point*: Many key New Testament figures are referenced but not named.\n*   The **Virgin Mary** is referred to as \"thy virgin Mother\" (Book XII) but never by the name \"Mary.\"\n*   **John the Baptist** is described as \"The voice of one crying in the Desert\" (Book XII) but is not named.\n*   **John the Apostle** is alluded to as the one exiled on Patmos (Book IV) but is not named \"John.\"\n\n*   *Count for this category: 3*\n\n### **Step 4: Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from each category:\n*   Primordial Saints: 2 (Adam, Eve)\n*   Old Testament Saints: 10 (Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, David)\n*   New Testament/Later Saints: 3 (Peter, Dominic, Francis)\n\nTotal = 2 + 10 + 3 = 15\n\nThere are 15 historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n<<<15>>>"
