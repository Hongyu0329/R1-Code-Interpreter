    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph without loops (edges from a vertex to itself) or multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has n=5 vertices.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or 2-connected):** A connected graph that remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph has no cut vertices (or articulation points). A graph must have at least 3 vertices to be 2-connected.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures, regardless of how the vertices are labeled.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a strategy\nThe most systematic way to solve this problem is to consider all nonisomorphic connected graphs with 5 vertices, categorized by their number of edges (m), and then check each one for the 2-connectivity property.\n\n*   A connected graph with n vertices must have at least n-1 edges. So, for n=5, m >= 4.\n*   A 2-connected graph with n vertices must have at least n edges. So, for n=5, m >= 5.\n*   The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with n=5 is the number of edges in the complete graph K5, which is C(5,2) = 10.\n\nSo, we need to examine the cases for m = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each case based on the number of edges (m)\n\n**Case m = 4:**\n*   A connected graph with n=5 vertices and m=4 edges is a tree.\n*   There are 3 nonisomorphic trees on 5 vertices (the path P5, the star K1,4, and one other).\n*   Any tree with more than 2 vertices has at least one non-leaf vertex, which is a cut vertex. Therefore, no tree on 5 vertices is 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=4: 0**\n\n**Case m = 5:**\n*   A connected graph with n=5 vertices and m=5 edges must contain exactly one cycle (it's a unicyclic graph).\n*   The graph can be a cycle of length 3, 4, or 5, possibly with trees attached.\n*   If the graph is the 5-cycle (C5), removing any vertex results in a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. So, C5 is 2-connected.\n*   If the cycle is shorter (C3 or C4), there must be one or more edges attached as \"tails\" to form a graph with 5 vertices. The vertex where a tail is attached to the cycle is a cut vertex.\n*   Therefore, among all unicyclic graphs on 5 vertices, only C5 is 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=5: 1**\n\n**Case m = 6:**\n*   There are 5 nonisomorphic connected graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges. We check each for cut vertices.\n    1.  **The House Graph (C5 with one chord):** This graph is 2-connected. Removing any vertex leaves a connected subgraph.\n    2.  **The complete bipartite graph K_2,3:** This graph is 2-connected. Removing any vertex from one partition leaves the vertices in the other partition connected to the remaining vertex in the first partition.\n    3.  **The bowtie/butterfly graph (two triangles sharing a vertex):** The shared vertex is a cut vertex. Not 2-connected.\n    4.  **K4 with a pendant edge:** The vertex in K4 to which the edge is attached is a cut vertex. Not 2-connected.\n    5.  **A C3 with a path of length 2 attached to one vertex:** The vertex of attachment is a cut vertex. Not 2-connected.\n*   Thus, there are 2 such graphs.\n*   **Count for m=6: 2**\n\n**Case m = 7:**\n*   There are 4 nonisomorphic connected graphs with 5 vertices and 7 edges. A useful method here is to consider their complements, which have 5 vertices and C(5,2) - 7 = 3 edges. One can show that the complements of all 4 graphs with 3 edges are connected except for one (the complement of K1,3 U K1 has a cut vertex). However, a direct check of the 4 graphs is also possible.\n    1.  **The Fan Graph F_1,4 (a P4 with a universal vertex):** This is 2-connected.\n    2.  **K_2,3 with an edge added between the two vertices in the smaller partition:** This is 2-connected.\n    3.  **The complement of a P3 U K2 graph:** This is 2-connected.\n    4.  **The House graph with an additional chord:** This is 2-connected.\n*   It turns out that all 4 connected graphs with 7 edges are 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=7: 4**\n\n**Case m = 8:**\n*   We look at the complements, which have 5 vertices and C(5,2) - 8 = 2 edges.\n*   There are 2 nonisomorphic graphs with 2 edges:\n    1.  Two disjoint edges (2K2). The complement is K5 with two disjoint edges removed.\n    2.  Two edges sharing a vertex (P3). The complement is K5 with a path of length 2 removed.\n*   Both of these resulting graphs with 8 edges are 2-connected (in fact, they are 3-connected).\n*   **Count for m=8: 2**\n\n**Case m = 9:**\n*   The complement has C(5,2) - 9 = 1 edge. There is only one such graph (K2 U 3K1).\n*   The graph is K5 with one edge removed (K5-e). This graph is 3-connected, and therefore 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=9: 1**\n\n**Case m = 10:**\n*   The only graph is the complete graph K5.\n*   K5 is 4-connected, and therefore 2-connected.\n*   **Count for m=10: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nSumming the counts from each case:\nTotal = (count for m=5) + (count for m=6) + (count for m=7) + (count for m=8) + (count for m=9) + (count for m=10)\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11.\n\nThere are 11 such graphs.\n\n<<<11>>>"
