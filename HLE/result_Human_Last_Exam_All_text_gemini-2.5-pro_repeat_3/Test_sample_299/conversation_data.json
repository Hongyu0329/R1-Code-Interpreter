    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the fundamental properties of the function `f`\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of f:**\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    Using the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$.\n    Since the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, it is injective. Thus, $x_1 = x_2$.\n    Therefore, $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of f:**\n    We are given that $f$ is a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$. A theorem in real analysis states that any continuous injective function defined on an interval (in this case, $\\mathbb{R}$) must be strictly monotonic.\n    This means $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n### Step 2: Determine if `f` can be strictly decreasing\n\nLet's assume $f$ is strictly decreasing.\nIf $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$ because $f$ is decreasing.\nApplying $f$ again, since $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$ and $f$ is decreasing, we get $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$.\nThis means that the function $g(x) = f(f(x))$ is strictly increasing.\nThe given equation is $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. The function $\\exp(x)$ is indeed strictly increasing, so this is consistent.\n\nHowever, let's consider the range of $f$. A continuous, strictly decreasing function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be a bijection, meaning its range is all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\nLet $R_f$ denote the range of $f$. So, $R_f = \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe equation is $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. The range of $\\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$.\nThe range of the composite function $f(f(x))$ is the set of values $f(y)$ where $y$ is in the range of the inner function $f$.\nSo, the range of $f(f(x))$ is $f(R_f) = f(\\mathbb{R})$.\nWe have $f(\\mathbb{R}) = (0, \\infty)$.\nBut we established that if $f$ is a strictly decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range must be $\\mathbb{R}$. This leads to a contradiction: $\\mathbb{R} = (0, \\infty)$ is false.\nTherefore, $f$ cannot be a strictly decreasing function.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly increasing\n\nSince $f$ must be strictly monotonic and cannot be strictly decreasing, it must be strictly increasing.\n\n1.  **Relationship between f(x) and x:**\n    For any real number $x$, we know that $\\exp(x) > x$.\n    The equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ implies $f(f(x)) > x$.\n    If there were some $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) \\le x_0$, then since $f$ is strictly increasing, we would have $f(f(x_0)) \\le f(x_0) \\le x_0$. This contradicts $f(f(x_0)) > x_0$.\n    Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Behavior as x approaches -âˆž:**\n    As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x) \\to L$ for some $L \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{-\\infty\\}$.\n    Since $f(x) > x$, it is impossible that $L = -\\infty$. Thus, $L$ must be a finite real number.\n    Taking the limit of the equation as $x \\to -\\infty$:\n    $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} \\exp(x) = 0$.\n    Also, since $f$ is continuous and $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = L$, we have $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = f(\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)) = f(L)$.\n    So, we must have $f(L) = 0$.\n    From the property $f(x) > x$, we apply it to $L$: $f(L) > L$, which means $0 > L$.\n\n3.  **Summary of properties for an increasing solution:**\n    *   $f$ is strictly increasing.\n    *   $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   There exists a number $L < 0$ such that $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = L$ and $f(L) = 0$.\n    *   The range of $f$ is $(L, \\infty)$.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the solutions and determining the cardinality\n\nThe properties derived above show that any solution $f$ is uniquely determined by its behavior on the interval $[L, 0]$. The construction of a solution proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Choose L:** We can choose any value for $L$ in the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$. The set of possible values for $L$ is uncountably infinite, with cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., of $\\mathbb{R}$).\n\n2.  **Choose an initial function segment `h`:** For a fixed $L < 0$, we must define $f$ on the interval $[L, 0]$. Let's call this segment $h(x) = f(x)$ for $x \\in [L, 0]$.\n    *   The function $h$ must map the interval $[L, 0]$ to the interval $[f(L), f(0)]$. We know $f(L)=0$. From $f(f(L)) = \\exp(L)$, we get $f(0) = \\exp(L)$. So, $h$ must be a function from $[L, 0]$ to $[0, \\exp(L)]$.\n    *   $h$ must be continuous and strictly increasing.\n    *   $h$ must satisfy the condition $h(x) > x$ for all $x \\in [L, 0]$. This is always possible since the endpoints $(L, 0)$ and $(0, \\exp(L))$ both lie above the line $y=x$.\n    *   The set of such functions $h$ is uncountably infinite. To see this, consider that for any value $c \\in (0, \\exp(L))$, we can construct a valid function $h$ such that $h(L/2) = c$. Since there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $c$, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions. As the set of all continuous functions on an interval has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, the number of choices for $h$ is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n3.  **Extend `f` to all of R:** Once $L$ and $h$ are chosen, the function $f$ is uniquely determined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   For $x > 0$, $f$ is defined iteratively. For example, for $x \\in (0, \\exp(L)]$, $x = h(y)$ for some unique $y \\in (L, 0]$. We must define $f(x) = f(h(y)) = f(f(y)) = \\exp(y) = \\exp(h^{-1}(x))$. This process can be continued to define $f$ on all of $[L, \\infty)$.\n    *   For $x < L$, we need to find $y$ such that $f(y) = \\exp(x)$. Since $x<L<0$, $\\exp(x) \\in (0, \\exp(L))$. We have defined $f$ on $[L,0]$ as $h$, which maps $[L,0]$ to $[0, \\exp(L)]$. So there is a unique $y \\in (L,0)$ such that $h(y)=\\exp(x)$. We must define $f(x) = y = h^{-1}(\\exp(x))$.\n\nThis construction shows that a unique solution $f$ corresponds to each pair $(L, h)$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Cardinality Calculation\n\nThe total number of solutions is the number of possible pairs $(L, h)$.\n*   The number of choices for $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   For each choice of $L$, the number of choices for the function $h$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe total cardinality of the set $S$ is the product of the cardinalities of the sets of choices:\n$|S| = |\\text{choices for L}| \\times |\\text{choices for h}| = \\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, which is the cardinality of the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ (also denoted $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\n<<<c>>>"
