    "Answering this question involves determining the asymptotic slice rank of a specific tensor and extracting the parameter K from the given formula.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Tensor and the Space**\n    The problem considers three copies of the vector space of complex-valued functions on the Boolean cube $\\{0, 1\\}^n$, which we can denote as $W_n = \\text{Func}(\\{0,1\\}^n, \\mathbb{C})$. The dimension of this space is $2^n$.\n    The function in question is:\n    \\[ T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1 \\]\n    This function maps $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$, and it is viewed as a tensor in the 3-partite tensor space $W_n \\otimes W_n \\otimes W_n$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Tensor**\n    The tensor $T$ is a sum of two parts: $T = P - C$, where\n    *   $P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$\n    *   $C(x, y, z) = 1$ (the constant function)\n\n    The slice rank satisfies the triangle inequality:\n    $\\text{slice\\_rank}(P) - \\text{slice\\_rank}(C) \\le \\text{slice\\_rank}(T) \\le \\text{slice\\_rank}(P) + \\text{slice\\_rank}(C)$.\n\n    The constant function $C(x, y, z) = 1$ can be written as $1(x) \\cdot 1(y,z)$, where $1(x)$ is the constant function 1 on the first variable, and $1(y,z)$ is the constant function 1 on the other two. This corresponds to a rank-1 slice. Thus, $\\text{slice\\_rank}(C) = 1$.\n\n    This means $\\text{slice\\_rank}(P) - 1 \\le \\text{slice\\_rank}(T) \\le \\text{slice\\_rank}(P) + 1$. For large $n$, the slice rank of $T$ is asymptotically dominated by the slice rank of $P$. We therefore focus on finding the slice rank of $P$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Tensor P**\n    The function $P$ is a product of $n$ identical functions for each coordinate:\n    $P(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f_1(x_i, y_i, z_i)$, where $f_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$.\n    The tensor corresponding to $P$ is the $n$-th tensor power of the tensor corresponding to $f_1$. Let's call the tensor for $f_1$ as $T_1$. Then the tensor for $P$ is $T_1^{\\otimes n}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Slice Rank of P**\n    We will determine the slice rank of $P$ with respect to the first party (the space of functions of $x$). By symmetry, the result will be the same for the other parties.\n    The slice rank is the minimum $k$ such that $P(x,y,z) = \\sum_{j=1}^k A_j(x) B_j(y,z)$.\n\n    *   **Upper Bound:** We construct a decomposition to get an upper bound.\n        The base function can be decomposed as $f_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + (y_1+z_1)$. Let's define two functions of $x_1$: $A_1(x_1)=x_1$ and $A_2(x_1)=1$. And two functions of $(y_1,z_1)$: $B_1(y_1,z_1)=1$ and $B_2(y_1,z_1)=y_1+z_1$.\n        Then $f_1(x_1,y_1,z_1) = A_1(x_1)B_1(y_1,z_1) + A_2(x_1)B_2(y_1,z_1)$. This expresses $f_1$ as a sum of 2 slices of type 1.\n        Now consider $P = T_1^{\\otimes n}$. We can expand this using the decomposition for $T_1$:\n        \\[ P(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (A_1(x_i)B_1(y_i,z_i) + A_2(x_i)B_2(y_i,z_i)) \\]\n        Expanding the product gives a sum of $2^n$ terms. Each term corresponds to choosing either the first or second part of the sum for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. A generic term is of the form:\n        \\[ \\left(\\prod_{i \\in S} A_1(x_i) \\prod_{i \\notin S} A_2(x_i)\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{i \\in S} B_1(y_i,z_i) \\prod_{i \\notin S} B_2(y_i,z_i)\\right) \\]\n        for some subset $S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. Each of these $2^n$ terms is a slice of type 1 (a function of $x$ times a function of $(y,z)$).\n        Therefore, $P$ can be written as a sum of $2^n$ slices. This gives the upper bound:\n        $\\text{slice\\_rank}(P) \\le 2^n$.\n\n    *   **Lower Bound:** A standard method to lower bound the slice rank is to find the dimension of the vector space spanned by the \"slices\" of the tensor. Let's fix the first variable $x$ to a specific vector $x_0 \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$. This gives a slice $P(x_0, y, z)$, which is a function of $y$ and $z$. The number of linearly independent such functions gives a lower bound on the slice rank.\n        Let's consider the set of $2^n$ functions $\\{P(x_0, y, z) \\mid x_0 \\in \\{0,1\\}^n\\}$.\n        A function in this set is given by:\n        \\[ f_{x_0}(y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_{0,i} + y_i + z_i) = \\prod_{i: x_{0,i}=1} (1 + y_i + z_i) \\prod_{i: x_{0,i}=0} (y_i + z_i) \\]\n        We need to find the dimension of the span of these $2^n$ functions. We can show they are linearly independent. Let $u_i = y_i + z_i$. The functions are $g_{x_0}(u) = \\prod_{i:x_{0,i}=1}(1+u_i) \\prod_{i:x_{0,i}=0} u_i$.\n        Consider a linear combination $\\sum_{x_0 \\in \\{0,1\\}^n} c_{x_0} g_{x_0}(u) = 0$. This must hold for all $u \\in \\{0,1,2\\}^n$. We treat this as a polynomial identity in variables $u_1, \\dots, u_n$ over $\\mathbb{C}$. Let's perform a change of variables: $w_i = u_i+1$. Then $u_i = w_i-1$.\n        The functions become $p_{x_0}(w) = \\prod_{i:x_{0,i}=1} w_i \\prod_{i:x_{0,i}=0} (w_i-1)$.\n        Let's evaluate the linear combination at points $w^{(S)} \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ where $w_i=1$ if $i \\in S$ and $w_i=0$ if $i \\notin S$.\n        For a given $S_0 \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, consider $w^{(S_0)}$.\n        $p_{x_0}(w^{(S_0)}) = \\prod_{i:x_{0,i}=1} w_i^{(S_0)} \\prod_{i:x_{0,i}=0} (w_i^{(S_0)}-1)$.\n        This term is non-zero only if for all $i$ with $x_{0,i}=1$, we have $w_i^{(S_0)}=1$ (i.e., $i \\in S_0$), and for all $i$ with $x_{0,i}=0$, we have $w_i^{(S_0)}=0$ (i.e., $i \\notin S_0$). This happens only if the set of indices where $x_{0,i}=1$ is exactly $S_0$.\n        Thus, $p_{x_0}(w^{(S_0)}) \\ne 0$ if and only if $x_0$ is the indicator vector of $S_0$.\n        Evaluating $\\sum c_{x_0} p_{x_0}(w^{(S_0)}) = 0$ gives $c_{S_0} \\cdot p_{S_0}(w^{(S_0)}) = 0$. Since $p_{S_0}(w^{(S_0)})$ is non-zero, we must have $c_{S_0}=0$. As this holds for any $S_0$, all coefficients are zero.\n        The $2^n$ functions are linearly independent. Therefore, the dimension of their span is $2^n$.\n        This gives the lower bound: $\\text{slice\\_rank}(P) \\ge 2^n$.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Slice Rank:** From the upper and lower bounds, we conclude that $\\text{slice\\_rank}(P) = 2^n$.\n\n5.  **Determine K**\n    We established that $\\text{slice\\_rank}(T) = 2^n \\pm 1$. The asymptotic behavior is given by:\n    \\[ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (\\text{slice\\_rank}(T))^{1/n} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (2^n \\pm 1)^{1/n} = 2 \\]\n    The problem states that the slice rank is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The base of this exponential growth is $3/2^K$.\n    Equating the two expressions for the asymptotic base:\n    \\[ \\frac{3}{2^K} = 2 \\]\n    Solving for $K$:\n    \\[ 3 = 2 \\cdot 2^K \\]\n    \\[ 3 = 2^{K+1} \\]\n    Taking the logarithm base 2 on both sides:\n    \\[ \\log_2(3) = K+1 \\]\n    \\[ K = \\log_2(3) - 1 \\]\n\nThis can also be written as $K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3/2)$."
