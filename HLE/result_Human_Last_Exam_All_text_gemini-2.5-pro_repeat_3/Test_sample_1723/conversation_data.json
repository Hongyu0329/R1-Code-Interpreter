    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the specific name of a single genus of mushroom that is known for producing a \"distinctly blue\" spore print. The phrasing implies that such a genus exists and is recognized for this characteristic.\n\n2.  **Define Spore Print:** A spore print is a crucial identification tool in mycology. It is made by placing a mushroom cap on a surface (like paper) and allowing its microscopic spores to fall and create a pattern. The color of this deposit is a key characteristic for identifying the mushroom's genus.\n\n3.  **Analyze Spore Print Colors:** Common spore print colors include white, cream, pink, yellow, various shades of brown (ochre, rusty, cinnamon), purple-brown, and black. Green is very rare (found in *Chlorophyllum molybdites*), and blue is generally considered non-existent in the world of mushroom spores.\n\n4.  **Investigate Potential Candidates:**\n    *   The most common source of confusion regarding blue spore prints comes from mushrooms that are themselves blue in color. The most famous of these is ***Lactarius indigo***.\n    *   **Lactarius indigo**: This mushroom is remarkable for its deep blue color, and it even \"bleeds\" an indigo-blue latex or \"milk\" when cut. Because the entire mushroom is so vividly blue, it is a very common misconception that its spores must also be blue.\n    *   **The Reality**: If you make a spore print from *Lactarius indigo*, the actual color of the spores is cream to yellowish. However, the blue latex from the gills can easily leak onto the paper, staining the print and making it *appear* bluish.\n\n5.  **Consider Other Blue Mushrooms:** Other mushrooms, like some species in the genus *Entoloma* (e.g., *Entoloma hochstetteri*), are also blue. However, the spore print of the *Entoloma* genus is characteristically pink to reddish-pink.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   From a strictly scientific and mycological standpoint, there is no known mushroom genus that produces a truly and distinctly blue spore print. The pigments that create blue colors in mushroom flesh do not appear in the spores.\n    *   The question is likely based on the widespread and persistent misconception surrounding *Lactarius indigo*. Because it is the only mushroom famous for \"bleeding\" blue milk that can stain a spore print, its genus, *Lactarius*, is almost certainly the intended answer. It is the genus \"known\" (albeit incorrectly) for this feature.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:** The question points to a single genus. The genus *Lactarius* contains the iconic *Lactarius indigo*, a mushroom so thoroughly blue that it is commonly mistaken for having a blue spore print. Therefore, *Lactarius* is the answer.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinction between Flesh Color and Spore Color:** It is critical not to confuse the color of the mushroom's body (the fruiting body) with the color of its microscopic spores. Many mushrooms are blue, but their spores are not.\n*   **The Role of Latex/Juice:** In the case of *Lactarius indigo*, the blue latex can contaminate and stain the spore print, leading to the false conclusion that the spores themselves are blue.\n*   **Common Misconceptions in Quizzes:** This type of question often appears in quizzes and relies on popular, though technically inaccurate, knowledge. The goal is to identify the subject of this common misconception.\n\n***\nThe single genus of mushroom known (though by common misconception) to produce a distinctly blue spore print is *Lactarius*.\n\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
