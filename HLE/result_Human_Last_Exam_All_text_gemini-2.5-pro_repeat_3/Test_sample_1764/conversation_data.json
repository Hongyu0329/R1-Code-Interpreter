    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$. The phrase \"smallest possible number\" implies that we are allowed to choose the space $X$ and the space $B$ (subject to the given conditions) in order to make the number of embeddings as small as possible. The number of embeddings is a non-negative integer. Therefore, if we can find a valid pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of embeddings is 0, then 0 must be the minimum possible number.\n\n### Step 2: Devising a Strategy to Achieve 0 Embeddings\nOur goal is to find a specific finite ultrametric space $X$ and a specific Banach space $B$ such that there is no isometric embedding from $X$ to $B$. If we can do this, the number of embeddings for this pair is 0, and we have found our minimum.\n\n### Step 3: Choosing the Finite Ultrametric Space X\nLet's consider a simple space $X$ with more than two points. Let $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$ be a set of three distinct points. We need to define an ultrametric $d$ on $X$. A simple choice is the discrete metric, where the distance between any two distinct points is a constant. Let's set this constant to 1.\nSo, we define the metric $d$ on $X$ as:\n$d(x_i, x_j) = 1$ if $i \\neq j$\n$d(x_i, x_i) = 0$\n\n**Careful Point 1: Verify that $(X,d)$ is an ultrametric space.**\nWe must check if the strong triangle inequality holds: $d(a, c) \\le \\max(d(a, b), d(b, c))$ for all $a, b, c \\in X$.\n- If $a, b, c$ are not all distinct (e.g., $a=b$), the inequality is trivial. For instance, $d(a,c) \\le \\max(d(a,a), d(a,c)) = \\max(0, d(a,c)) = d(a,c)$.\n- If $a, b, c$ are all distinct points from $X$, then they must be $x_1, x_2, x_3$ in some order. The distances are all 1. The inequality becomes $1 \\le \\max(1, 1)$, which is true.\nSo, our chosen space $(X,d)$ is a finite ultrametric space.\n\n### Step 4: Choosing the Banach Space B\nWe need to choose a Banach space $B$ of some cardinality $K$. Let's pick a very simple, well-known Banach space: the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard norm, which is the absolute value $\\|v\\| = |v|$.\n- $\\mathbb{R}$ is a complete normed vector space, so it is a Banach space.\n- The cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. So, we are considering the case where $K=c$. This is a valid cardinality for a non-trivial Banach space.\n\n### Step 5: Proving Non-existence of an Isometric Embedding\nNow, we must show that there is no isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$, where $X$ and $B$ are the spaces we chose in the previous steps.\n\nAn isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ would be a function that assigns a real number to each point in $X$, say $f(x_1) = p_1$, $f(x_2) = p_2$, and $f(x_3) = p_3$, such that the distances are preserved:\n$\\|f(x_i) - f(x_j)\\|_{\\mathbb{R}} = d(x_i, x_j)$ for all $i,j$.\nThis translates to the following conditions on the real numbers $p_1, p_2, p_3$:\n1.  $|p_1 - p_2| = d(x_1, x_2) = 1$\n2.  $|p_2 - p_3| = d(x_2, x_3) = 1$\n3.  |p_1 - p_3| = d(x_1, x_3) = 1\n\n**Careful Point 2: Analyze the geometric constraints in the target space B = $\\mathbb{R}$.**\nThe points $p_1, p_2, p_3$ lie on the real number line. Let's order them. Without loss of generality, assume $p_1 < p_2 < p_3$.\n- The distance between $p_1$ and $p_2$ is $p_2 - p_1$.\n- The distance between $p_2$ and $p_3$ is $p_3 - p_2$.\n- The distance between $p_1$ and $p_3$ is $p_3 - p_1$.\n\nFrom the ordering, it is clear that $(p_2 - p_1) + (p_3 - p_2) = p_3 - p_1$. This means that on the real line, for any three distinct points, one of the three distances between them is the sum of the other two.\n\nLet's see if our required distances $\\{1, 1, 1\\}$ can satisfy this property. We would need $1 + 1 = 1$, which is $2=1$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, it is impossible to find three points $p_1, p_2, p_3$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the distance requirements.\n\nThis proves that for our chosen space $X$ (the 3-point space with discrete metric 1) and our chosen space $B$ (the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$), there are no isometric embeddings. The number of such embeddings is 0.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\nWe have found a valid pair of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is 0. Since the number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer, the smallest possible value it can take is 0.\n\nThis argument can be generalized. A key property of any three points $a,b,c$ in an ultrametric space is that the triangle they form is isosceles, with the third side being less than or equal to the length of the two equal sides. In contrast, any three distinct points on the real line form a \"degenerate triangle\" where the largest distance is the sum of the other two. These two properties are mutually exclusive for any set of three distinct points. Therefore, no ultrametric space with 3 or more points can be isometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFinal answer is 0."
