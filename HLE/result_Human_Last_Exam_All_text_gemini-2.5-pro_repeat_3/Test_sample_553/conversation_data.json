    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology in the Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand the specific musical terms used in the question: \"tonic chord\" and \"minor fifth chord\".\n\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord that the song feels most resolved on. In music theory, it's represented by the Roman numeral 'I' in a major key or 'i' in a minor key. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic is the C major chord. In the key of A minor, the tonic is the A minor chord.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord:** This refers to a minor chord built on the fifth note of the scale. This is a crucial detail.\n    *   In a major key (e.g., C major), the fifth note is G. The standard dominant chord is a G major (V). A \"minor fifth\" chord would be a G minor (v). This is a less common but very effective \"borrowed\" chord.\n    *   In a minor key (e.g., A minor), the fifth note is E. The chord built on the fifth note using the natural minor scale is an E minor (v). This is a very common chord in minor key folk and rock songs.\n\nThe question asks for a song that \"starts with a chord jump\" from the tonic (I or i) to this minor fifth (v).\n\n### Step 2: Search for a Beatles Song with this Specific Introduction\n\nWe need to scan the Beatles' discography, paying close attention to the very beginning of their songs.\n\n*   Many Beatles songs have famous intros, but they don't fit this specific progression (e.g., \"A Hard Day's Night\" starts on a complex dissonant chord, \"Help!\" starts with vocals on the ii chord, \"I Feel Fine\" starts with a guitar riff on the tonic).\n*   Let's consider the song **\"Things We Said Today\"** from the album *A Hard Day's Night*.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Introduction of \"Things We Said Today\"\n\nNow, let's analyze this song against the criteria from Step 1.\n\n*   **Key of the Song:** \"Things We Said Today\" is in the key of A minor.\n*   **Tonic Chord:** In the key of A minor, the tonic chord (i) is **A minor (Am)**.\n*   **Fifth Note and Chord:** The fifth note in the key of A minor is E. The minor chord built on this note is **E minor (Em)**. This is the minor fifth chord (v).\n*   **The Opening Chord Progression:** The song begins immediately with a stark, rhythmic strum on an acoustic guitar. The very first chord played is **A minor**. This is immediately followed by a \"jump\" to an **E minor** chord. The intro consists of this Am â†’ Em progression repeated before the vocals enter.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe song \"Things We Said Today\" starts with a clear and distinct chord jump from its tonic chord (A minor) to its minor fifth chord (E minor). This perfectly matches the description in the question.\n\n<<<Things We Said Today>>>"
