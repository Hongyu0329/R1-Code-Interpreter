    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for a specific anatomical detail of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*: the number of depressions contained within its lacrimal recess.\n\n2.  **Define the Key Terms:**\n    *   ***Irritator challengeri***: This is a species of spinosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived during the Early Cretaceous period in what is now Brazil. Our knowledge of its anatomy comes primarily from a well-preserved, though incomplete, skull (holotype specimen SMNS 58022).\n    *   **Lacrimal Bone:** This is a bone of the skull that in most tetrapods is located in front of the eye socket.\n    *   **Lacrimal Recess:** This is a depression or fossa (a pit or hollow area) on the outer surface of the lacrimal bone. It is part of the larger antorbital fossa system. The question is not about the recess itself, but about any smaller depressions *within* it.\n\n3.  **Locate the Primary Scientific Source:** To answer a detailed anatomical question like this, we must refer to the primary scientific literature that describes the fossil. The most comprehensive and authoritative description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull is the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, published in the *Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology*.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Anatomical Description from the Source:**\n    *   In their paper, Sues et al. (2002) provide a detailed description of each bone in the skull. When describing the lacrimal bone, they note the presence of a distinct lacrimal recess.\n    *   The crucial detail is how they describe this recess. The paper states that the lacrimal recess is **\"subdivided by a low, oblique ridge into two smaller, subsidiary fossae\"**.\n    *   These \"two smaller, subsidiary fossae\" are the depressions located within the main lacrimal recess.\n\n5.  **List Careful Points:**\n    *   **Specificity is Key:** The question is not asking for the number of lacrimal recesses (there is one on each lacrimal bone), but the number of depressions *inside* that recess.\n    *   **Source Reliability:** The answer relies entirely on the published description of the single known skull of *Irritator*. Any new discoveries could potentially change this, but based on current knowledge, the 2002 paper is the definitive source.\n    *   **Anatomical Terminology:** It's important to understand that \"fossae,\" \"depressions,\" and \"pits\" are often used interchangeably in paleontological descriptions to refer to such features. The paper uses the term \"subsidiary fossae\" for these depressions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed description in the primary scientific literature (Sues et al., 2002), the lacrimal recess on the skull of *Irritator challengeri* is divided by a ridge, creating two smaller depressions (subsidiary fossae) within it.\n\n<<<2>>>"
