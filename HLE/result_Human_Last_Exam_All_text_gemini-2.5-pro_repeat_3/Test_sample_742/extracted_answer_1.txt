No. It is not possible to prove the existence of Gödel's god-like entities using the customary mathematical setting of quantum mechanics. The two frameworks are fundamentally incompatible in their domains, concepts, and axioms. Quantum mechanics is a physical theory describing the behavior of matter and energy, while Gödel's proof is a metaphysical argument in formal logic. The core concepts of Gödel's proof, such as "positive property" and "necessary existence," have no natural or non-arbitrary translation into the mathematical language of quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces, operators, etc.).
