    "### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Noble Gases:** The noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The ones that occur naturally on Earth are:\n    *   Helium (He)\n    *   Neon (Ne)\n    *   Argon (Ar)\n    *   Krypton (Kr)\n    *   Xenon (Xe)\n    *   Radon (Rn)\n    *(Note: Oganesson (Og) is also in Group 18, but it is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth, so its abundance is zero and it is not considered in this context.)*\n\n2.  **Determine the Abundance of Each Noble Gas:** The question asks for the abundance \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" However, the vast majority of noble gases (except Helium and Radon, which are also found in the crust due to radioactive decay) are located in the Earth's atmosphere. Comparing their atmospheric abundances provides a clear ranking of their rarity. The abundances in dry air are approximately:\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** 9,340 parts per million (ppm) or 0.934%. It is the most abundant noble gas.\n    *   **Neon (Ne):** 18.18 ppm.\n    *   **Helium (He):** 5.24 ppm.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** 1.14 ppm.\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** 0.087 ppm.\n\n3.  **Consider Radon (Rn):** Radon is a special case. It is a noble gas, but it is radioactive and has a very short half-life (the most stable isotope, Rn-222, has a half-life of about 3.8 days). It is constantly being formed by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust and soil. Because it decays so quickly, it never accumulates to significant concentrations.\n    *   The average concentration of Radon in the atmosphere is extremely low and highly variable. It is typically measured in the range of 6 x 10⁻¹⁹ parts per million. This is many orders of magnitude lower than Xenon's 0.087 ppm.\n\n4.  **Compare the Abundances to Find the Rarest:**\n    *   When comparing the stable noble gases, Xenon (Xe) is the rarest at 0.087 ppm.\n    *   However, the question asks for the rarest \"noble gas\" without specifying that it must be stable. Radon is a noble gas.\n    *   Comparing Xenon's abundance (~0.087 ppm) with Radon's abundance (~6 x 10⁻¹⁹ ppm), it is clear that Radon is vastly rarer. The same conclusion holds if we consider the total estimated mass of each gas on Earth (atmosphere, crust, and oceans combined). The total mass of Radon present at any one time is estimated in the millions of kilograms, while the total mass of Xenon is in the trillions of kilograms.\n\n5.  **Consider the Timeframe (2002):** The relative atmospheric concentrations of stable noble gases are constant over human timescales. The average concentration of Radon is also considered to be in a steady state (rate of creation equals rate of decay). Therefore, the data from 2002 would be effectively the same as current data, and the ranking of rarity remains unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, while Xenon is the rarest *stable* noble gas, Radon is a naturally occurring noble gas that is present in far smaller quantities due to its radioactivity and short half-life. Therefore, Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth in 2002.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
