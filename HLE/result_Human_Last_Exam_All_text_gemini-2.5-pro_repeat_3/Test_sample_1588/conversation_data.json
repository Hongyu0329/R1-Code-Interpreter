    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the BCH Formula and its Terms**\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula gives an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables. The formula is an infinite series:\n$Z(X, Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\n\nEach term $Z_n(X, Y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of total degree $n$ in $X$ and $Y$. More specifically, $Z_n(X, Y)$ is an element of the free Lie algebra $L(X, Y)$ generated by $X$ and $Y$. The \"order\" of a term corresponds to this degree $n$. The \"coefficients\" are the rational numbers multiplying the basis elements of this Lie algebra.\n\nWe are looking for the number of linearly independent Lie brackets of degree 10 that have a non-zero coefficient in the expression for $Z_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\n**2. Finding the Total Number of Possible Terms**\n\nThe space of all possible terms of order $n$ is the $n$-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, denoted $L_n(X, Y)$. The dimension of this space gives the maximum possible number of non-zero coefficients. This dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula:\n\n$\\dim L_n(k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nHere, we have $n=10$ (order) and $k=2$ (generators $X$ and $Y$).\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must correctly identify the divisors of $n=10$ and the values of the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for these divisors.\n    *   The divisors of 10 are $d \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n    *   The Möbius function values are:\n        *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n        *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is a single prime)\n        *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is a single prime)\n        *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 is a product of two distinct primes)\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $\\dim L_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1)2^{10/1} + \\mu(2)2^{10/2} + \\mu(5)2^{10/5} + \\mu(10)2^{10/10} \\right]$\n    $= \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^5 + (-1) \\cdot 2^2 + (1) \\cdot 2^1 \\right]$\n    $= \\frac{1}{10} [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]$\n    $= \\frac{1}{10} [990] = 99$\n\nSo, there are 99 linearly independent Lie brackets of order 10. This is the maximum possible number of non-zero coefficients.\n\n**3. Using Symmetry Properties to Constrain the Solution**\n\nThe BCH formula $Z(X, Y)$ has a specific symmetry. Consider the relationship:\n$(e^X e^Y)^{-1} = e^{-Y} e^{-X}$\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides gives:\n$\\log((e^X e^Y)^{-1}) = \\log(e^{-Y} e^{-X})$\n$-Z(X, Y) = Z(-Y, -X)$\n\nLet's analyze the effect of this symmetry on the homogeneous component $Z_n(X, Y)$. If we replace $X$ with $-Y$ and $Y$ with $-X$, a term of degree $n$ gets multiplied by $(-1)^n$. Let $S$ be the operator that swaps $X$ and $Y$. The relation is $S(Z_n(-X, -Y)) = -Z_n(X,Y)$.\nSince $Z_n$ is homogeneous of degree $n$, $Z_n(-X, -Y) = (-1)^n Z_n(X, Y)$.\nSubstituting this into the symmetry equation gives:\n$(-1)^n S(Z_n(X, Y)) = -Z_n(X, Y)$\n$S(Z_n(X, Y)) = (-1)^{n+1} Z_n(X, Y)$\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Applying this symmetry to our specific case of $n=10$.\n    For $n=10$, we have $S(Z_{10}) = (-1)^{10+1} Z_{10} = -Z_{10}$.\n    This means that $Z_{10}$ is an anti-symmetric element with respect to the swapping of $X$ and $Y$. It must lie entirely within the anti-symmetric subspace of $L_{10}(X, Y)$, which we denote as $L_{10}^-$.\n\nThe number of non-zero coefficients is therefore not the full dimension of $L_{10}(X, Y)$, but the dimension of its anti-symmetric subspace, $L_{10}^-$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Dimension of the Anti-Symmetric Subspace**\n\nWe can find the dimension of the symmetric ($L_n^+$) and anti-symmetric ($L_n^-$) subspaces using character theory. The dimensions are given by:\n$\\dim L_n^{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\dim L_n \\pm \\text{Tr}_{L_n}(S))$\nwhere $\\text{Tr}_{L_n}(S)$ is the trace of the swap operator $S$ on the space $L_n(X, Y)$.\n\nThe trace can be calculated using a formula related to Witt's formula:\n$\\text{Tr}_{L_n}(S) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) (\\text{Tr}_V(S^d))^{n/d}$\nwhere $V$ is the vector space spanned by the generators $\\{X, Y\\}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must correctly calculate the trace of powers of the swap matrix $S$.\n    In the basis $\\{X, Y\\}$, $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $S^2 = I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    So, $S^d = S$ for odd $d$, and $S^d = I$ for even $d$.\n    The traces are $\\text{Tr}_V(S) = 0$ and $\\text{Tr}_V(I) = 2$.\n    Thus, $\\text{Tr}_V(S^d)$ is 0 for odd $d$ and 2 for even $d$.\n\n*   **Calculation of the Trace for n=10:**\n    The divisors are $d \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n    The terms for odd divisors ($d=1, 5$) will be zero because $\\text{Tr}_V(S^1)=\\text{Tr}_V(S^5)=0$.\n    $\\text{Tr}_{L_{10}}(S) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(2)(\\text{Tr}_V(S^2))^{10/2} + \\mu(10)(\\text{Tr}_V(S^{10}))^{10/10} \\right]$\n    $= \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ (-1) \\cdot (2)^5 + (1) \\cdot (2)^1 \\right]$\n    $= \\frac{1}{10} [-32 + 2] = \\frac{-30}{10} = -3$\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we have all the pieces to find the dimension of the anti-symmetric subspace $L_{10}^-$.\n$\\dim L_{10} = 99$\n$\\text{Tr}_{L_{10}}(S) = -3$\n\n$\\dim L_{10}^- = \\frac{1}{2} (\\dim L_{10} - \\text{Tr}_{L_{10}}(S))$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} (99 - (-3))$\n$= \\frac{1}{2} (99 + 3) = \\frac{102}{2} = 51$\n\nThe number of non-zero coefficients is the dimension of the subspace in which the solution must lie. It is a known property of the BCH formula that it is \"generic\" in the sense that it has non-zero components for all basis vectors of this subspace. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients is 51.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\bf{51}$.\n<<<51>>>"
