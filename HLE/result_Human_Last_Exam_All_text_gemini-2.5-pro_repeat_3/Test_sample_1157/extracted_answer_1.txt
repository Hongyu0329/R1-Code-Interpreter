A comprehensive management plan involves three phases.
**Phase 1 (Emergency Management):** Focus on systemic stabilization by consulting a physician to manage her uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%) with medication and monitoring. The dental management involves confirming no other major trauma, cleaning the wound, and suturing soft tissues. Replantation of the avulsed teeth (left lateral incisor, canine, first premolar) is contraindicated due to the 28-hour delay. Prophylactic antibiotics and analgesics are prescribed.
**Phase 2 (Healing):** Allow 3-6 months for the extraction sites to heal while the patient works to bring her diabetes under stable control.
**Phase 3 (Definitive Treatment):** Plan the prosthetic replacement.
