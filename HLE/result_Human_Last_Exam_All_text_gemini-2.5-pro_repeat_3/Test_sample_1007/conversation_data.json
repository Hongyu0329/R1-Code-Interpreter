    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends with the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**Analysis of the Question:**\nThe question asks to identify the classical ballet step, from the given options, where the final position of the legs is identical to the initial position. This specifically refers to which foot is in front and which is in back in a crossed position like the fifth position.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the options:**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** The dancer jumps vertically. While in the air, the legs perform three changes, resulting in six distinct leg movements (open-cross-open-cross-open-cross). For an *entrechat six* starting with the right foot in front, the sequence is: open, beat left leg in front, open, beat right leg in front, open, beat left leg in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (left foot in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** The name itself gives clues. *Échappé* means to \"escape,\" where the feet jump from fifth to second position. *Battu* means \"beaten,\" indicating the legs beat together. *Changé* means \"changed.\" The step involves jumping from fifth to second, then jumping from second, beating the legs, and closing in fifth. The word *changé* explicitly states that the feet will have changed their position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (left foot in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" A dancer brushes one leg out, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (\"assembles\") both legs together in the air before landing. There are many types. An *assemblé dessus* (\"over\") starts with the back foot brushing to the side and ends with it in front. An *assemblé dessous* (\"under\") starts with the front foot brushing to the side and ends with it in the back. Both of these common forms change the feet.\n    *   **Ending Position:** In most common school forms, the feet change their front/back orientation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are usually different.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** *Glissade* means \"to glide.\" *Derrière* means \"behind.\" From fifth position, the back foot glides out to the side, takes the weight, and the front foot then glides to close in fifth position *behind* the other foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** If you start with the right foot in front, the left foot (back foot) glides out, and the right foot closes behind it. You end in fifth position with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a decorative step, often described as a *pas de chat* with a *rond de jambe* (circular movement of the leg) performed by each leg in the air. The dancer jumps, the leading leg (right foot) performs a small circle outwards (*en dehors*), and the second leg (left foot) performs a small circle inwards (*en dedans*). The dancer then lands on the first leg (right foot) and then closes the second leg (left foot) back into its original position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The step is designed as a flourish that returns to its origin. The dancer lands back in the same fifth position they started in (right foot in front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending leg positions are the same.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nAfter analyzing all the options, *Gargouillade* is the only step among the choices that, by its standard definition and execution, concludes with the legs in the same position from which it began. The other steps listed (*Entrechat six*, *Échappé battu changé*, *Assemblé dessus/dessous*, *Glissade derrière*) all involve a change in which foot is in front.\n\n<<<E>>>"
