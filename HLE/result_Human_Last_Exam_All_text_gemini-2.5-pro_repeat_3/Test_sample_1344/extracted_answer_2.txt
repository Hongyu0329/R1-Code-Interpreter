The optimal combination is a **Zirconium (Zr)** metal center complexed with a **Constrained-Geometry Catalyst (CGC) type ligand** (e.g., a linked monocyclopentadienyl-amido ligand). This complex should be activated by a **borate activator** (e.g., [Ph₃C][B(C₆F₅)₄]) and immobilized on a **high-surface-area porous silica (SiO₂) support**.
