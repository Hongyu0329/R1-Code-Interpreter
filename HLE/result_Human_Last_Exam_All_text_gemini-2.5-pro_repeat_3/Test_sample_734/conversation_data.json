    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who?** The question asks for a specific \"Christian theologian.\"\n    *   **What did he do?** He \"first developed specialized terminology.\" This implies a unique or particular set of words or concepts, not just a general discussion.\n    *   **What does the terminology describe?** It describes \"changes in the laws of nature.\" This is a key point. The concept isn't merely about miracles happening *within* a static set of laws, but about the possibility of the laws themselves being altered.\n    *   **What are the applications?** The terminology must be applicable to two specific theological events:\n        1.  The virgin birth of Jesus.\n        2.  Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall of man.\n\n2.  **Initial Theological and Historical Context:**\n    *   The concept of fixed, universal \"laws of nature\" is primarily a product of the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. Theologians before this period (like Augustine or Aquinas) spoke of the \"order of nature\" or \"secondary causes,\" but the modern concept of inviolable \"laws\" forced later theologians to respond in a more specific way.\n    *   Therefore, the theologian in question is likely from the 19th or early 20th century, a period when theologians were directly engaging with scientific naturalism and uniformitarianism (the idea that natural processes have always operated in the same way).\n\n3.  **Evaluating Potential Candidates:**\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430):** Augustine discussed miracles extensively. His view was that miracles are not contrary to nature, but contrary to *our knowledge* of nature. He proposed that God placed \"seminal reasons\" (rationes seminales) within creation, which could later emerge as miraculous events. While profound, this is more about a pre-programmed potential within a higher natural order than a \"change\" to existing laws. It doesn't quite fit the specific phrasing of the question.\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274):** Aquinas distinguished between God as the \"Primary Cause\" and natural laws as \"secondary causes.\" He saw miracles as events where God acts directly, bypassing the chain of secondary causes. This is a suspension or superseding of a law in a specific instance, rather than a fundamental \"change\" in the law itself.\n    *   **Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield (1851–1921):** As a leading theologian at Princeton Theological Seminary, Warfield was at the forefront of defending traditional Christianity against 19th-century liberal theology and scientific skepticism. He needed a precise way to talk about God's action in a world that science was describing in terms of immutable laws.\n\n4.  **Identifying Warfield's Specialized Terminology:**\n    *   Warfield developed a specific conceptual distinction to address this exact problem. He distinguished between the **autogenetic** operation of force and the **exogenetic** introduction of force.\n    *   **Autogenetic** (from Greek *auto* \"self\" + *genesis* \"origin\"): This term describes the natural world operating according to its own internal principles and forces—the very \"laws of nature\" that God established at creation and upholds through His providence.\n    *   **Exogenetic** (from Greek *exo* \"outside\" + *genesis* \"origin\"): This term describes the direct, creative, and miraculous intervention of God, where a new force is introduced into the natural system *from the outside*. This is not a violation of nature, but the introduction of a higher, creative power that alters the outcome.\n\n5.  **Applying Warfield's Terminology to the Question's Examples:**\n    *   **The Fall:** The state of nature before the Fall operated according to a certain set of \"autogenetic\" principles. The curse described in Genesis 3 can be understood as an \"exogenetic\" act by God that altered the operating principles of the natural world, introducing new regularities like futility, decay, and thorns (as referenced in Romans 8). The laws of nature were, in effect, changed or re-calibrated.\n    *   **The Virgin Birth:** The normal process of human conception is \"autogenetic.\" The virgin birth was a unique \"exogenetic\" event. The Holy Spirit introduced a new, creative force from outside the established system of natural law, causing a conception to occur without the normal means. This action changed the outcome in this one specific instance without permanently abolishing the general law of human reproduction.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Benjamin B. Warfield's terminology of \"autogenetic\" and \"exogenetic\" operations is a specialized framework developed specifically to explain how the regular \"laws of nature\" can coexist with divine actions that fundamentally alter their operation, whether in a single instance (the virgin birth) or in a lasting way (the Fall). He is the theologian who best fits all the criteria of the question.\n\n<<<Benjamin B. Warfield>>>"
