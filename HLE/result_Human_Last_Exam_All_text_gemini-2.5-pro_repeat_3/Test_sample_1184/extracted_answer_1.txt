**1) Hotspots for interaction (binding):** These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain and form a hydrophobic pocket that binds the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the α1-subunit. For human β1-subunit (CACNB1, UniProt P54289), the key hotspot residues are:
    *   **Y373 (Tyrosine 373)**
    *   **L406 (Leucine 406)**
    *   **V408 (Valine 408)**
    *   **I461 (Isoleucine 461)**
    *   **V465 (Valine 465)**

**2) Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (gating modulation):** These residues are primarily located in the variable regions outside the conserved GK binding domain.
    *   **The N-terminal domain (residues 1-30):** This entire region acts as a major modulator of channel activation and inactivation.
    *   **KIKK motif (Lysine-15, Isoleucine-16, Lysine-17, Lysine-18):** A specific, critical hotspot motif within the N-terminus that significantly influences gating modulation.
    *   **The Hook Region (approx. residues 248-355):** This flexible linker region between the SH3 and GK domains also plays a crucial role in allosterically modulating channel gating.
