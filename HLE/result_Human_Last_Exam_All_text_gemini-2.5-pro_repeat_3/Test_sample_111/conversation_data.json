    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Date of Death:** The first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that she died of the plague on **September 12, 1368**.\n\n2.  **Establish Chaucer's Role and Residence at the Time:** By the late 1360s, Geoffrey Chaucer was no longer a youth.\n    *   In 1366, he married Philippa de Roet, who was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Philippa of Hainault, Edward III's wife. This placed him firmly within the royal court circles in England.\n    *   By 1367, Chaucer was receiving a life pension as an *esquire* to King Edward III. This was a significant position that required his presence at or near the royal court, which was based in England (primarily London and Windsor).\n\n3.  **Analyze Chaucer's Connection to Blanche and her Husband, John of Gaunt:**\n    *   Blanche of Lancaster was the first wife of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, one of King Edward III's sons.\n    *   John of Gaunt became Chaucer's most important patron. Chaucer's wife, Philippa, was the sister of Katherine Swynford, who would later become John of Gaunt's third wife. This created a close personal and professional bond.\n    *   Blanche died in England, at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire.\n\n4.  **Consider the Evidence of Chaucer's First Major Poem:**\n    *   Chaucer's first major work, *The Book of the Duchess*, is a long allegorical poem written as an elegy for Blanche of Lancaster.\n    *   The poem was commissioned by or written to console the grieving John of Gaunt. It is widely believed to have been written shortly after her death, between 1368 and 1372.\n    *   The creation of such a significant, personal, and timely work strongly implies that Chaucer was present in the same courtly environment where this tragic event was deeply felt. It would be highly unusual for him to have written it from abroad without being part of the immediate circle of mourners.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Chaucer's Known Travels:**\n    *   Chaucer was known to travel to the continent on diplomatic missions. Records show he was granted leave to travel abroad in 1368.\n    *   However, his major, well-documented trips to Italy did not occur until 1372-73.\n    *   While it is possible he was on the continent for a short mission when he heard the news, his home, his wife, his job, his patron, and the subject of the death were all in **England**. The overwhelming evidence of his life at this stage points to England as his base of operations.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Absence of Absolute Proof:** We do not have a diary entry or letter from Chaucer dated September 12, 1368, stating, \"I am in London today.\" Historical records from this period are often incomplete.\n*   **Scholarly Consensus vs. Absolute Certainty:** The answer relies on strong circumstantial evidence and scholarly consensus. Based on his position in the royal court, his marriage, his patronage by John of Gaunt, and his writing of *The Book of the Duchess*, historians are confident he was in England.\n*   **Eliminating Other Options:** We can confidently rule out Italy (his trip was later) and Scotland (no evidence of a visit then). France is a remote possibility, but far less likely than his home country where his entire career and personal life were centered. Therefore, England is the most logical and evidence-based conclusion.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on his established role as an esquire in the English royal court, his marriage to a lady-in-waiting, the location of his patron John of Gaunt, and the composition of his elegy *The Book of the Duchess*, all evidence points to Geoffrey Chaucer being in England when Blanche of Lancaster died in 1368.\n\n<<<C>>>"
