    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Type of Differential Equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$\nx'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)\n$$\nThis can be written as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. This is a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). We can see that the variables $x$ and $t$ can be separated, so it is a separable equation.\n\n**2. Separate the Variables**\nTo solve a separable equation, we move all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side.\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt\n$$\n**Careful Point:** When we divide by $x^2$, we are implicitly assuming that $x(t)$ is not identically zero. We can check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. The right side of the equation becomes $(t-1) \\cdot 0^2 = 0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant (or equilibrium) solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is non-zero. By the uniqueness theorem for ODEs, our solution curve cannot cross the equilibrium solution $x(t)=0$. Therefore, $x(t)$ will never be zero for our specific initial condition, and dividing by $x^2$ is valid.\n\n**3. Integrate Both Sides**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nLet's compute each integral:\n*   The left side: $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n*   The right side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n\nCombining these and adding the constant of integration, C:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\n\n**4. Use the Initial Condition to Find the Constant C**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution to find the value of C.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = C\n$$\n\n**5. Write the Particular Solution**\nNow we substitute the value of C back into our general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**6. Find the Value of x(1)**\nThe goal is to find $x(1)$. We can substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution equation. We don't need to solve for $x(t)$ explicitly first, which can save time and prevent algebraic errors.\nSubstitute $t=1$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nNow, simplify the right-hand side:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $x(1)$. Multiply both sides by -1:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nTake the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\nFinal Answer check:\nThe solution is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}}$.\nAt $t=0$, $x(0) = \\frac{1}{0+0-1/8} = -8$. This matches the initial condition.\nAt $t=1$, $x(1) = \\frac{1}{-1/2+1-1/8} = \\frac{1}{1/2-1/8} = \\frac{1}{4/8-1/8} = \\frac{1}{3/8} = 8/3$. The calculation is correct.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
