    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe want to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices:\nP1(s) = [s^2 + s, -s;\n         -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nP2(s) = [s, 0;\n         -s - 1, 1]\n\nA matrix G(s) is a GCRD if it is a common right divisor of P1 and P2 (i.e., P1 = Q1*G and P2 = Q2*G for some polynomial matrices Q1, Q2) and any other common right divisor D(s) is a right divisor of G(s) (i.e., G = H*D for some polynomial matrix H).\n\n**2. Choose a Method**\nA standard method for finding the GCRD is to use the Euclidean algorithm, which can be implemented by performing elementary row operations on a stacked matrix. The elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping any two rows.\n2.  Multiplying any row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\n**3. Set up the Initial Matrix**\nWe form a block matrix M by stacking P1 on top of P2:\nM = [ P1(s) ] = [ s^2 + s,  -s   ]  (Row 1)\n    [ P2(s) ]   [ -s^2 - 1, s^2  ]  (Row 2)\n                [ s,        0    ]  (Row 3)\n                [ -s - 1,   1    ]  (Row 4)\n\n**4. Perform Elementary Row Operations to Reduce the Matrix**\nOur goal is to use these operations to transform the matrix M into the form [G; 0], where G is a 2x2 matrix that will be the GCRD, and 0 is a 2x2 zero matrix.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is often strategic to use rows with simple elements, like constants or low-degree polynomials, to eliminate entries in other rows. Row 4 has a '1' in the second column, which is very useful.\n\n*   **Step 4.1: Use Row 4 to eliminate the entries in the second column of Row 1 and Row 2.**\n    *   Perform the operation: `Row 1 <- Row 1 + s * Row 4`\n        [s^2 + s, -s] + s*[-s - 1, 1] = [(s^2 + s) + (-s^2 - s), -s + s] = [0, 0]\n    *   Perform the operation: `Row 2 <- Row 2 - s^2 * Row 4`\n        [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2*[-s - 1, 1] = [(-s^2 - 1) - (-s^3 - s^2), s^2 - s^2] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0] = [s^3 - 1, 0]\n\n    The matrix M now looks like this:\n    [ 0,        0    ]\n    [ s^3 - 1,  0    ]\n    [ s,        0    ]\n    [ -s - 1,   1    ]\n\n*   **Step 4.2: Simplify the rows with non-zero entries.**\n    We have three non-zero rows. Let's focus on the rows with zeros in the second column. We can use `Row 3 = [s, 0]` to simplify `Row 2 = [s^3 - 1, 0]`.\n    *   Perform the operation: `Row 2 <- Row 2 - s^2 * Row 3`\n        [s^3 - 1, 0] - s^2*[s, 0] = [s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0] = [-1, 0]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [ 0,        0    ]\n    [ -1,       0    ]\n    [ s,        0    ]\n    [ -s - 1,   1    ]\n\n*   **Step 4.3: Use the new simple row `[-1, 0]` to further reduce the matrix.**\n    Let the current non-zero rows be `R_a = [-1, 0]`, `R_b = [s, 0]`, and `R_c = [-s - 1, 1]`.\n    *   Perform the operation: `Row 3 <- Row 3 + s * Row 2` (i.e., `R_b <- R_b + s * R_a`)\n        [s, 0] + s*[-1, 0] = [s - s, 0] = [0, 0]\n    *   Perform the operation: `Row 4 <- Row 4 - (s + 1) * Row 2` (i.e., `R_c <- R_c - (s+1) * R_a`)\n        [-s - 1, 1] - (s + 1)*[-1, 0] = [(-s - 1) - (-s - 1), 1 - 0] = [0, 1]\n\n    The matrix is now reduced to:\n    [ 0,   0 ]\n    [ -1,  0 ]\n    [ 0,   0 ]\n    [ 0,   1 ]\n\n**5. Extract the GCRD**\nThe non-zero rows remaining are `[-1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`. We can arrange these to form the GCRD matrix G(s).\nG(s) = [ -1, 0;\n          0, 1 ]\n\n**6. Finalize the Answer**\nThe GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant). The matrix G(s) we found has `det(G) = (-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1`, so it is unimodular. This implies that the original matrices P1 and P2 are **right coprime**.\n\nAny unimodular matrix is a valid GCRD in this case. For a canonical and simpler answer, we can perform one last elementary row operation on G(s) to put it in row-echelon form: `Row 1 <- -1 * Row 1`.\n[ -1, 0;  0, 1 ] -> [ 1, 0; 0, 1 ]\nThis resulting matrix is the 2x2 identity matrix, I.\n\nThus, the greatest common right divisor is the identity matrix.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
