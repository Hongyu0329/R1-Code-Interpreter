No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is determined by the perception of natural predators (e.g., birds), not humans. Avian and human visual systems are fundamentally different; most importantly, birds can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which is a critical component of bee coloration patterns but is invisible to humans and not captured by standard photography. Therefore, clustering species based on human-perceived similarity is not a reliable method for identifying ecologically functional mimicry rings.
