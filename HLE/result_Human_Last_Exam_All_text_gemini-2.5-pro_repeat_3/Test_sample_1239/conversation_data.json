    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Write down the equations\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. In three spatial dimensions ($\\vec{x} = (x, y, z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$), the velocity field $\\vec{u}(t, \\vec{x}) = (u, v, w)$ and the pressure field $p(t, \\vec{x})$ are governed by the following system of partial differential equations:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:**\n    $\\frac{\\partial \\vec{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\vec{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\vec{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\vec{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:**\n    $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\rho$ is the constant fluid density and $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity ($\\nu > 0$). Without loss of generality, we can set $\\rho=1$ by absorbing it into the pressure term.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Concept of a Lie Group of Symmetries\n\nA Lie group of symmetries of a system of differential equations is a group of continuous transformations of the independent variables ($t, x, y, z$) and dependent variables ($u, v, w, p$) that maps any solution of the system to another solution. The dimension of this Lie group is the number of independent parameters that define these transformations. This is equivalent to finding the dimension of the corresponding Lie algebra, which is spanned by the infinitesimal generators of these transformations.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Symmetries Systematically\n\nWe can identify the symmetries by considering the physical principles the equations embody or by a formal scaling analysis.\n\n1.  **Time Translation (1 dimension):**\n    The equations do not explicitly depend on the time variable $t$. Therefore, if $(\\vec{u}(t, \\vec{x}), p(t, \\vec{x}))$ is a solution, so is $(\\vec{u}(t+c, \\vec{x}), p(t+c, \\vec{x}))$ for any constant $c$.\n    *   Transformation: $t' = t + c$\n    *   This contributes **1** dimension to the group.\n\n2.  **Space Translations (3 dimensions):**\n    The equations are defined on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and their coefficients are constant, so they are invariant under translations in space. If $(\\vec{u}(t, \\vec{x}), p(t, \\vec{x}))$ is a solution, so is $(\\vec{u}(t, \\vec{x}+\\vec{c}), p(t, \\vec{x}+\\vec{c}))$ for any constant vector $\\vec{c}$.\n    *   Transformation: $\\vec{x}' = \\vec{x} + \\vec{c}$\n    *   This contributes **3** dimensions (one for each spatial direction).\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations (3 dimensions):**\n    The equations are formulated using vector operators (like gradient, divergence, Laplacian) that are covariant under rotations. This means the form of the equations is preserved under a rotation of the coordinate system.\n    *   Transformation: $\\vec{x}' = R\\vec{x}$, $\\vec{u}' = R\\vec{u}$, where $R \\in SO(3)$ is a rotation matrix.\n    *   The group of rotations in 3D, $SO(3)$, is a 3-parameter group.\n    *   This contributes **3** dimensions.\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts (3 dimensions):**\n    The equations are invariant under a transformation to a frame of reference moving at a constant velocity $\\vec{v}$.\n    *   Transformation: $t' = t$, $\\vec{x}' = \\vec{x} - \\vec{v}t$, $\\vec{u}'(t', \\vec{x}') = \\vec{u}(t, \\vec{x}) - \\vec{v}$. The pressure remains unchanged: $p'(t', \\vec{x}') = p(t, \\vec{x})$.\n    *   The constant velocity vector $\\vec{v}$ can be chosen in any of the three spatial directions.\n    *   This contributes **3** dimensions.\n\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation) Symmetry (1 dimension):**\n    This is a less obvious symmetry. We look for a transformation of the form $t' = a^\\alpha t$, $\\vec{x}' = a^\\beta \\vec{x}$, $\\vec{u}' = a^\\gamma \\vec{u}$, $p' = a^\\delta p$ that leaves the equations invariant for any scaling factor $a>0$. By substituting these into the Navier-Stokes equations and requiring the scaling factors to cancel out, we find a single set of relations between the exponents: $\\alpha=2$, $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma=-1$, $\\delta=-2$.\n    *   Transformation: $t' = a^2 t$, $\\vec{x}' = a \\vec{x}$, $\\vec{u}' = a^{-1} \\vec{u}$, $p' = a^{-2} p$.\n    *   Since this is defined by a single parameter $a$, it contributes **1** dimension.\n\n6.  **Pressure Shift Symmetry (1 dimension):**\n    The pressure $p$ appears in the momentum equation only through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This implies that we can add any function of time, $f(t)$, to the pressure without affecting the momentum equation. The incompressibility condition does not involve pressure. So, if $(\\vec{u}, p)$ is a solution, then $(\\vec{u}, p+f(t))$ is also a solution for any arbitrary function $f(t)$. This represents an infinite-dimensional group of symmetries.\n    *   **Careful Point:** When asked for \"the dimension\", it is standard practice to refer to the dimension of the *maximal finite-dimensional* symmetry Lie algebra. The infinite-dimensional part is usually separated. The finite-dimensional part includes the simplest case of this symmetry: a constant shift in pressure.\n    *   Transformation: $p' = p + c$, where $c$ is a constant.\n    *   This contributes **1** dimension to the maximal finite-dimensional algebra.\n\n### Step 4: Sum the Dimensions\n\nWe sum the dimensions from each independent symmetry transformation:\n*   Time Translation: 1\n*   Space Translations: 3\n*   Spatial Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean Boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n*   Pressure Shift: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of point symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a 12-parameter group. This group is composed of the Galilean group (10 parameters: translations in time and space, rotations, and Galilean boosts), a one-parameter scaling group, and a one-parameter group of constant pressure shifts.\n\n<<<12>>>"
