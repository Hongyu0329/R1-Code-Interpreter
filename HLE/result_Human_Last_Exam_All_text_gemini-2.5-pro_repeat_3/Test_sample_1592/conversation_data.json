    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Location of the Waskaganish Gathering Place:**\n    *   The \"Waskaganish gathering place\" refers to the community of Waskaganish.\n    *   Waskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec.\n    *   Geographically, it is situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n\n2.  **Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories:**\n    *   Quebec is a large province that shares borders with several other Canadian provinces and territories.\n    *   The provinces and territories bordering Quebec are:\n        *   **Ontario** (to the west and southwest)\n        *   **New Brunswick** (to the southeast)\n        *   **Newfoundland and Labrador** (to the east)\n        *   **Nunavut** (to the north, including a small land border and the islands in Hudson Bay and James Bay)\n\n3.  **Eliminate Distant Options:**\n    *   Waskaganish is located in the northwestern part of Quebec's inhabited regions.\n    *   **New Brunswick** and **Newfoundland and Labrador** are located to the far southeast and east, respectively. They are clearly not the closest.\n    *   The choice is between **Ontario** and **Nunavut**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Proximity to Ontario:**\n    *   The border between Quebec and Ontario runs north-south just west of Waskaganish.\n    *   Waskaganish is located on the coast of James Bay. The provincial border is a short distance inland to the west and southwest.\n    *   Looking at a map, the distance from the community of Waskaganish to the Ontario border is a relatively short overland journey. The border is a straight line running south from the bay along the 79°31′W meridian of longitude. Waskaganish is at approximately 78°45′W longitude, making the distance to the border line quite small (approximately 50-60 km).\n\n5.  **Analyze Proximity to Nunavut:**\n    *   The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands located within James Bay.\n    *   To reach Nunavut from Waskaganish, one would have to travel across the water of James Bay to one of these islands.\n    *   The closest major islands belonging to Nunavut are Charlton Island, the Twin Islands, and Akimiski Island.\n    *   Of these, Charlton Island is the nearest to Waskaganish.\n\n6.  **Compare the Distances:**\n    *   **Distance to Ontario:** The shortest distance from Waskaganish to the province of Ontario is a westward, overland route to the provincial border. This distance is approximately **55 kilometers (about 34 miles)**.\n    *   **Distance to Nunavut:** The shortest distance from Waskaganish to the territory of Nunavut is a northwesterly route across James Bay to the nearest point on Charlton Island. This distance is approximately **80 kilometers (about 50 miles)**.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   By comparing the shortest distances, the land border with the province of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the nearest island belonging to the territory of Nunavut.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   The question specifies \"province or territory,\" requiring consideration of both Ontario and Nunavut.\n*   The \"Waskaganish gathering place\" is correctly interpreted as the community/town of Waskaganish itself.\n*   It is crucial to know that the islands in James Bay are part of Nunavut, not Quebec or Ontario. This is a key geographical fact for this question.\n*   The comparison is between the shortest possible distance to any point in the neighboring province/territory. For Ontario, this is the land border; for Nunavut, it is the coast of the nearest island.\n\nBased on this analysis, the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
