    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues in the Prompt**\n\n*   **\"HE\" and \"HIS work\":** We are looking for the full name of a male author or originator of a significant work.\n*   **\"at the end of HIS work\":** The specific point of interest is located at the conclusion of this work.\n*   **\"separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\":** This is a thematic clue. It points towards a rule, law, or commandment against desiring or coveting what belongs to someone else. This is most famously articulated in the Ten Commandments.\n*   **\"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\":** This is the most critical and specific clue. \"The prohibition against representation\" is a direct reference to the Second Commandment in the Abrahamic traditions, which forbids the making of graven images or idols.\n*   **\"Veronika Campan's interpretation\":** The entire analysis is framed through the lens of this specific interpreter. This suggests the interpretation might be a modern theological or philosophical one.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Clues to a Specific Work and Person**\n\n*   The combination of a commandment against coveting \"material possessions\" and a \"prohibition against representation\" points directly to the **Ten Commandments** (the Decalogue) from the Hebrew Bible.\n*   The Tenth Commandment is \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This matches the clue about \"another's material possessions\" and it appears at the **end** of the list.\n*   The Second Commandment is \"You shall not make for yourself an idol.\" This is the \"prohibition against representation.\"\n*   The person (\"HE\") who, according to the biblical narrative (in the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy), received these commandments from God on Mount Sinai and delivered them to the Israelites is the prophet **Moses**. \"HIS work,\" in this context, is the delivery of God's law.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Veronika Campan's Interpretation**\n\n*   The interpretation links the Second and Tenth Commandments in a unique way.\n*   The Second Commandment forbids making *physical representations* (idols).\n*   The Tenth Commandment forbids *coveting*, which is an internal act of thought and desire.\n*   To covet something, you must first create a *mental image or representation* of it in your mind.\n*   Therefore, Campan's interpretation suggests that the Tenth Commandment, by regulating our internal thoughts and desires, operates within the realm of mental representation. In doing so, it shifts focus from the forbidden external, physical representations of the Second Commandment to the realm of internal, mental ones. By legislating on these mental images, it \"naturally ignores\" the specific prohibition on physical ones, engaging with the concept of representation on a different, more abstract level.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information to Identify \"HIM\"**\n\n*   All the evidence converges on the figure responsible for delivering the Ten Commandments. This figure is unequivocally Moses.\n*   The prompt asks for HIS \"full name.\" In common usage, as well as in historical and religious contexts, his name is simply Moses. While a patronymic (Moses ben Amram, or \"Moses, son of Amram\") exists, \"Moses\" is universally understood as his complete name.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
