    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Deciphering the Question**\n\n*   The first instruction is that the title of the haiku, \"The Bays\", is a question.\n*   \"The Bays\" is a homophone (sounds the same as) for \"The B's\".\n*   Therefore, the question being asked is \"What are the B's?\", implying that the answer will be a list of words starting with the letter 'B' that are hidden within the haiku.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the First Line of the Haiku**\n\n*   **Line:** \"An August tempest\"\n*   **Analysis:** A \"tempest\" is a violent, windy storm. A sudden, strong gust of wind associated with such a storm is often called a \"blast\".\n*   **Careful Point:** We are looking for a word that starts with 'B' and fits the description.\n*   **The 'B' Word:** **Blast**\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Second Line of the Haiku**\n\n*   **Line:** \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"\n*   **Analysis:** \"Twice fifteen\" is a mathematical clue: 2 x 15 = 30. The line mentions \"winds\", which points towards a wind measurement scale. The Beaufort scale measures wind speed.\n*   **Careful Point:** A wind speed of around 30 mph (or knots) on the Beaufort scale is categorized as a strong \"breeze\" (Force 6).\n*   **The 'B' Word:** **Breeze**\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the Third Line of the Haiku**\n\n*   **Line:** \"A divine one yields\"\n*   **Analysis:** This line suggests a mythological or divine figure (\"a divine one\") that produces or \"yields\" something. Given the haiku's theme of wind and storms, this points to a wind god.\n*   **Careful Point:** In Greek mythology, the god of the cold north wind and the bringer of winter is named Boreas.\n*   **The 'B' Word:** **Boreas**\n\n**Step 5: Compiling and Ordering the Answer**\n\n*   We have identified three 'B' words from the haiku: **Blast, Breeze, Boreas**.\n*   The final instruction is to provide the answer \"in alphabetical order\".\n*   Let's alphabetize the three words:\n    1.  **Blast** (B-L...)\n    2.  **Boreas** (B-O...)\n    3.  **Breeze** (B-R...)\n*   The correct alphabetical order is Blast, Boreas, Breeze.\n\n<<<Blast, Boreas, Breeze>>>"
