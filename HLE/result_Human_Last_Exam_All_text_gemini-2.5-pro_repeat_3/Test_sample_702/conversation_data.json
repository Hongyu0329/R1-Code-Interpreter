    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Spaces and the Map**\n    *   **Domain:** The space is $X = \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n        *   $\\Omega S^n$ is the based loop space of the $n$-sphere $S^n$.\n        *   $\\wedge$ is the smash product of based spaces.\n        *   $\\Sigma$ is the reduced suspension.\n    *   **Codomain:** The space is $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n        *   $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is the smash product of the 4-sphere and the 6-sphere. Topologically, $S^p \\wedge S^q \\cong S^{p+q}$, so $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\cong S^{10}$.\n        *   Therefore, the codomain is $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   **The Map:** The map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is a standard, natural map in homotopy theory, often called the (suspended) Samelson product map or a distributivity map relating loops and suspensions. The description \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" refers to its construction, which involves the evaluation maps $\\epsilon_X: \\Sigma\\Omega X \\to X$, where $\\Omega X$ is the fiber of the path-space fibration $PX \\to X$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Connectivity of the Spaces**\n    *   A space $Z$ is $k$-connected if its homotopy groups $\\pi_i(Z)$ are trivial for all $i \\le k$.\n    *   **Connectivity of $\\Omega S^n$:** $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^n) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(S^n)$. Since $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected, $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected.\n        *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   **Connectivity of the Domain:** The domain is $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n        *   The connectivity of a smash product of a $c_1$-connected space and a $c_2$-connected space is $(c_1 + c_2 + 1)$.\n        *   Connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2 + 4 + 1) = 7$.\n        *   The suspension $\\Sigma Z$ of a $c$-connected space $Z$ is $(c+1)$-connected.\n        *   Therefore, the domain $X$ is $(7+1)=8$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(X)$.\n    *   **Connectivity of the Codomain:** The codomain is $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n        *   This space is $(10-2)=8$-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(Y) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Connectivity of the Map**\n    *   The connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(k-1)$-connected.\n    *   Since both the domain and codomain are 8-connected, their homotopy groups are zero for $i \\le 8$. The map $f_*$ is trivially an isomorphism for $i < 9$. Thus, the connectivity is at least 9.\n    *   To find the precise connectivity, we must analyze the map's behavior on higher homotopy groups.\n\n4.  **Recall Relevant Theorems**\n    There are two key theorems regarding the connectivity of the map $h_{X,Y}: \\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$.\n\n    *   **Ganea's Theorem (General Case):** If $X$ is $(n-1)$-connected and $Y$ is $(m-1)$-connected (for $n,m \\ge 2$), then the map $h_{X,Y}$ is $(n+m-1)$-connected.\n        *   For our case, $X=S^4$ is $(4-1)=3$-connected, so $n=4$.\n        *   $Y=S^6$ is $(6-1)=5$-connected, so $m=6$.\n        *   According to this theorem, the map is $(4+6-1)=9$-connected. This would mean $f_*$ is an isomorphism for $i < 9$ and an epimorphism for $i=9$.\n\n    *   **Cohen-Lada-May Theorem (Special Case):** The general result is improved under an additional condition. The theorem states that if either $X$ or $Y$ is a suspension (i.e., $X \\simeq \\Sigma X'$ or $Y \\simeq \\Sigma Y'$), then the map $h_{X,Y}$ is a weak homotopy equivalence.\n        *   A weak homotopy equivalence is a map that induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for all $i \\ge 0$.\n\n5.  **Apply the Correct Theorem**\n    *   We must check if the condition for the stronger theorem holds.\n    *   The space $X=S^4$ can be written as the reduced suspension of the 3-sphere, $S^4 \\cong \\Sigma S^3$.\n    *   Similarly, $Y=S^6 \\cong \\Sigma S^5$.\n    *   Since at least one of the spaces (in fact, both) is a suspension, the condition of the Cohen-Lada-May theorem is satisfied.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is a weak homotopy equivalence.\n    *   This means that $f_*: \\pi_i(\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\to \\pi_i(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6))$ is an isomorphism for all $i \\ge 0$.\n    *   When a map induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups, its connectivity is not bounded by any finite integer. By convention, we say the connectivity is infinite.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is an instance of the natural map $h_{X,Y}: \\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$ for $X=S^4$ and $Y=S^6$. A theorem by Cohen, Lada, and May states that this map is a weak homotopy equivalence if either $X$ or $Y$ is a suspension. Since $S^4 = \\Sigma S^3$ is a suspension, the theorem applies. A weak homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups, so its connectivity is infinite.\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
