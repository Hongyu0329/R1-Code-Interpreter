    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   We are looking for the largest natural number $n$ (i.e., $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$).\n    *   The object of study is the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27$.\n    *   We are interested in its algebraic $K$-groups, specifically the even-indexed groups $K_{2n}(R)$.\n    *   The condition is that this group must be nonzero: $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Type of K-theory:**\n    The term \"K-group\" can refer to several different theories, most commonly Quillen K-theory ($K_i$) or Milnor K-theory ($K_i^M$). The solution depends crucially on which theory is intended.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Quillen K-theory.** This is the standard definition in modern algebraic topology and algebra.\n    *   **Case 2: Milnor K-theory.** This is an older, more elementary definition, often used in number theory.\n\n    Let's analyze both cases.\n\n3.  **Analysis with Quillen K-theory:**\n    The computation of the Quillen K-groups of rings like $\\mathbb{Z}/m$ is a deep result in algebraic K-theory, established by the work of Quillen, SoulÃ©, Hesselholt, Madsen, and others. The structure of $K_i(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ for a prime $p$ is known.\n\n    *   **The Ring:** We have $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27 = \\mathbb{Z}/3^3$. So, $p=3$ and $k=3$.\n    *   **The K-groups:** We are interested in $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$.\n    *   **The Formula:** For an odd prime $p$, and an integer $k \\ge 2$, the structure of the even K-groups is given by the following formula (a consequence of the Hesselholt-Madsen calculations):\n        *   $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p^{a}$ if $n$ is a multiple of $p-1$.\n        *   $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k) = 0$ if $n$ is not a multiple of $p-1$.\n        The exponent $a$ is given by $a = k - 1 - \\lfloor \\frac{k-2}{p-1} \\rfloor$.\n\n    *   **Applying the Formula to our Problem:**\n        *   $p=3$, $k=3$.\n        *   The condition for the group to be non-zero is that $n$ must be a multiple of $p-1 = 3-1 = 2$. So, $n$ must be an even number.\n        *   If $n$ is even, the group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/3^a$, where the exponent $a$ is:\n            $a = 3 - 1 - \\lfloor \\frac{3-2}{3-1} \\rfloor = 2 - \\lfloor \\frac{1}{2} \\rfloor = 2 - 0 = 2$.\n        *   So, for any even natural number $n$, we have $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/3^2 = \\mathbb{Z}/9$.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for Quillen K-theory:** The group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero (it's $\\mathbb{Z}/9$) for all even natural numbers $n=2, 4, 6, 8, \\ldots$. This means there is no largest natural number $n$ that satisfies the condition. This contradicts the premise of the question, which asks for the \"largest\" such number. This suggests that either the question is flawed or it refers to a different K-theory.\n\n4.  **Analysis with Milnor K-theory:**\n    Let's consider the possibility that \"K-group\" refers to Milnor K-theory, denoted $K_i^M(R)$.\n\n    *   **Key Theorem:** For any finite ring $R$, the higher Milnor K-groups vanish. Specifically, a result by J. Graham states that $K_i^M(R) = 0$ for all $i \\ge 3$.\n    *   **Applying the Theorem:** We are looking for $n$ such that $K_{2n}^M(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\n        *   According to the theorem, if the index $2n$ is greater than or equal to 3, the group must be zero.\n        *   $2n \\ge 3 \\implies n \\ge 1.5$.\n        *   Since $n$ must be a natural number, this means that for all $n \\ge 2$, we have $K_{2n}^M(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = 0$.\n\n    *   **Checking the Remaining Case:** The only natural number not covered by the vanishing result is $n=1$. We need to check if $K_{2 \\cdot 1}^M(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = K_2^M(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero.\n        *   The structure of $K_2^M(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is also a known result. For an odd prime $p$ and $k \\ge 1$, there is a surjective map from $K_2^M(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ to $K_2^M(\\mathbb{Z}/p)$.\n        *   $K_2^M(\\mathbb{Z}/p) = K_2^M(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is known to be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2$ for any prime $p > 2$.\n        *   Since there is a surjection from $K_2^M(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ onto the non-zero group $K_2^M(\\mathbb{F}_3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2$, the group $K_2^M(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ must be non-zero.\n\n    *   **Conclusion for Milnor K-theory:**\n        *   For $n=1$, $K_2^M(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero.\n        *   For all $n \\ge 2$, $K_{2n}^M(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is zero.\n        *   Therefore, the largest natural number $n$ for which the group is non-zero is $n=1$.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The interpretation of \"K-group\" as Quillen K-theory leads to a contradiction with the question's statement. The interpretation as Milnor K-theory leads to a consistent and unique answer. It is highly probable that Milnor K-theory was intended.\n\nFinal answer step-by-step:\n1.  Assume the question refers to Milnor K-theory.\n2.  For a finite ring $R$, $K_i^M(R) = 0$ for $i \\ge 3$.\n3.  We need $K_{2n}^M(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\ne 0$. This requires the index $2n$ to be less than 3.\n4.  $2n < 3 \\implies n < 1.5$.\n5.  The only natural number $n$ satisfying this is $n=1$.\n6.  We check if $K_{2 \\cdot 1}^M(\\mathbb{Z}/27) = K_2^M(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is indeed nonzero. It is, as it surjects onto $K_2^M(\\mathbb{F}_3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2$.\n7.  Thus, the largest such $n$ is 1."
