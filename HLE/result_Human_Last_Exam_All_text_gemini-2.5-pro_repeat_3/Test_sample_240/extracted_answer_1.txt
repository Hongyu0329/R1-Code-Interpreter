The reason a fully functional MRI coil may not show resonance when probed with a magnetic loop and a VNA is that the coil is not in its operational "receive" mode. This can be due to several factors, with the most common being:

1.  **Active Decoupling Circuits:** Most MRI coils have safety circuits (often using PIN diodes) that actively detune the coil to make it non-resonant during the scanner's high-power transmit pulse. When the coil is disconnected from the scanner on the bench, it is not receiving the necessary DC bias voltage to disable this detuning circuit. Therefore, the coil may be in a "fail-safe," detuned state by default.

2.  **Unpowered Preamplifiers:** Modern coils have integrated low-noise preamplifiers (LNAs). The coil's resonant element is designed to be impedance-matched to the input of the LNA *when it is powered on*. When the coil is on the bench, the LNA is unpowered, and its input impedance is completely different. This incorrect impedance termination spoils the quality factor (Q) of the resonant circuit, making the resonance peak too broad and shallow to be detected.

In essence, the coil and its integrated electronics form a system that is designed to be resonant and functional only when it is connected to the MRI scanner, which provides the necessary power and control signals. A lack of resonance on a bench test does not necessarily indicate a fault.
