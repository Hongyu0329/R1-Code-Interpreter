    "Answering this question requires knowledge from algebraic number theory, specifically about Galois groups of polynomials and the Chebotarev density theorem.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the polynomial's structure.**\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\nLet's analyze the part of the polynomial without the constant term: $g(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$.\nThis structure is characteristic of a family of polynomials related to Chebyshev polynomials. Let's define a substitution $x = y + c/y$. Then we can express $x^k$ in terms of $y^k + (c/y)^k$.\nA specific family of polynomials, which we can call $S_n(x, c)$, is defined by the relation:\n$S_n(y + c/y, c) = y^n + (c/y)^n$.\nThe recurrence relation for these polynomials is $S_n(x,c) = x S_{n-1}(x,c) - c S_{n-2}(x,c)$, with $S_0(x,c)=2$ and $S_1(x,c)=x$.\nLet's compute $S_7(x,c)$:\n$S_7(x,c) = x^7 - 7cx^5 + 14c^2x^3 - 7c^3x$.\nIf we set $c=2$, we get:\n$S_7(x,2) = x^7 - 7(2)x^5 + 14(2^2)x^3 - 7(2^3)x = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$.\nThis is exactly $g(x)$.\nSo, the polynomial $f(x)$ can be written as $f(x) = S_7(x,2) + 22$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of f(x) over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nThe equation $f(x)=0$ is equivalent to $S_7(x,2) = -22$.\nUsing the substitution $x = y + 2/y$, the equation becomes $y^7 + (2/y)^7 = -22$.\nMultiplying by $y^7$ gives $(y^7)^2 + 22y^7 + 128 = 0$.\nThis is a quadratic equation for $z = y^7$. The roots are:\n$z = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{22^2 - 4(1)(128)}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{484 - 512}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{-28}}{2} = -11 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}$.\nLet $z_1 = -11 + i\\sqrt{7}$. The roots of $f(x)$ are given by $x_k = y_k + 2/y_k$, where $y_k$ are the seven 7th roots of $z_1$.\nThe structure of such polynomials is well-studied.\n1.  **Irreducibility:** The polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This is a known result for polynomials of the form $S_n(x,c)+a$ where $n$ is prime.\n2.  **Galois Group:** The Galois group of $S_n(x,c)-a=0$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is typically the dihedral group $D_n$. It is smaller only in special cases. One such case is when the group is cyclic ($C_n$), which happens if the discriminant of the quadratic in $y^n$, namely $a^2-4c^n$, is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    In our case, $n=7, c=2, a=-22$. The discriminant is $(-22)^2 - 4(2^7) = 484 - 512 = -28$.\n    Since $-28$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is not $C_7$. Given the irreducibility and the structure of the roots, the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the dihedral group $D_7$ of order $2 \\times 7 = 14$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem.**\nWe want to find the natural density of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$.\nFor a prime $p$ that does not divide the discriminant of $f(x)$, the polynomial $f(x) \\pmod p$ remains irreducible if and only if the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_p$ acts as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$.\nThe Galois group of $f(x)$ is $G = D_7$. Since $f(x)$ has degree 7, $G$ is viewed as a permutation group on the 7 roots. For $f(x) \\pmod p$ to be irreducible, the Frobenius element must correspond to a 7-cycle in this permutation representation.\nThe Chebotarev density theorem states that the density of primes $p$ for which $\\text{Frob}_p$ belongs to a given conjugacy class $C$ of $G$ is $|C|/|G|$. To find the total density for a certain property, we sum the densities for all conjugacy classes whose elements satisfy that property.\n\n**Step 4: Count the relevant elements in the Galois group $D_7$.**\nThe group $D_7$ is the group of symmetries of a regular heptagon, generated by a rotation $r$ (by $2\\pi/7$) and a reflection $s$. Its elements are:\n*   The identity element, $e$.\n*   Six rotations: $r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, r^6$. All of these have order 7.\n*   Seven reflections: $s, sr, sr^2, ..., sr^6$. All of these have order 2.\n\nThe action of $D_7$ on the vertices of the heptagon corresponds to its permutation representation on the 7 roots of $f(x)$.\n*   The rotations $r^k$ (for $k \\neq 0$) permute all 7 vertices cyclically. They are 7-cycles.\n*   The reflections each fix one vertex and swap the remaining 6 vertices in 3 pairs. Their cycle structure is $(1)(2)(2)(2)$.\n*   The identity element fixes all vertices. Its cycle structure is $(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)$.\n\nFor $f(x) \\pmod p$ to be irreducible, the Frobenius element must be a 7-cycle. The elements in $D_7$ that are 7-cycles are the 6 rotations $r, r^2, ..., r^6$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final density.**\nThe number of elements in $D_7$ that are 7-cycles is 6.\nThe total number of elements in $D_7$ is 14.\nThe density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible mod $p$ is the proportion of such elements in the Galois group.\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles in $D_7$) / (Order of $D_7$) = $6/14 = 3/7$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n1.  **Correctly identifying the polynomial family:** This is the crucial first step. Without recognizing $f(x)$ as $S_7(x,2)+22$, the problem is much harder.\n2.  **Confirming the Galois group:** One must rely on the theorem that the Galois group for this type of polynomial is indeed $D_n$. Verifying the conditions (e.g., that $-28$ is not a square) is important.\n3.  **Interpreting \"irreducible mod p\":** This condition translates to the Frobenius element being a cycle of maximum length (a 7-cycle in this case).\n4.  **Counting elements in $D_7$:** Correctly identifying which elements of the dihedral group correspond to 7-cycles is essential. All non-identity rotations are 7-cycles, while reflections are not.\n\nFinal calculation is straightforward once these steps are established."
