    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the objects in the question\n\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. This is a very strong condition. The pseudo-arc is a key example.\n*   **$X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:** This is the space $X$ with one point removed. Since $X$ is a continuum, $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a non-compact, locally compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\})$:** This is the largest possible compact Hausdorff space that contains $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** The remainder is the set of points added to $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ to form its Stone-Cech compactification. It is denoted by $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $p$ in a continuum $C$, the composant of $p$ is the set of all points $q \\in C$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $C$ containing both $p$ and $q$. The composants of a continuum partition it into disjoint sets.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the remainder to the original space $X$\n\nSince $X$ is itself a compactification of $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, there exists a unique continuous surjective map $\\pi: \\beta Y \\to X$ that is the identity on $Y$. This map sends all the points of the remainder $R$ to the single point $x \\in X$. Thus, the remainder $R$ can be identified with the fiber over $x$, i.e., $R = \\pi^{-1}(x)$.\n\nIt is a standard result in topology that if $Y$ is a connected, non-compact, locally compact space, its Stone-Cech remainder $R$ is a continuum (i.e., it is compact and connected).\n\n### Step 3: Find the number of composants of the remainder $R$\n\nThe problem now is to determine the number of composants of the continuum $R$. There are powerful theorems that connect the structure of the remainder $R$ to the structure of the original space $X$.\n\n*   **Theorem (H. Cook, 1970):** If $X$ is a continuum that is indecomposable at a point $x$ (meaning $x$ is in the closure of every composant of $X$), then the remainder $R = \\beta(X\\setminus\\{x\\})\\setminus(X\\setminus\\{x\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum. A non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is indecomposable at every point.\n*   **Theorem (D. P. Bellamy, 1973):** Let $X$ be a continuum and $x \\in X$. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the composants of the remainder $R = \\beta(X\\setminus\\{x\\})\\setminus(X\\setminus\\{x\\})$ and the composants of $X$ that do not contain the point $x$.\n\nThese theorems are the key to solving the problem. The question about the remainder's composants is transformed into a question about the composants of the original space $X$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the number of composants of $X$\n\nWe need to find the number of composants of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$. The question asks for the *maximum possible* number, which suggests we might need to consider different possibilities for $X$.\n\nLet's consider two cases for the continuum $X$:\n\n**Case 1: $X$ is a degenerate continuum.**\nA single point, say $X=\\{p\\}$, is a compact, connected metric space, so it is a continuum.\n*   Is it indecomposable? Yes. It has no proper subcontinua, so it cannot be written as a union of two.\n*   Is it hereditary indecomposable? Yes. Its only subcontinuum, $\\{p\\}$, is indecomposable.\nSo, a single point is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\nLet $X=\\{x\\}$. Then $X \\setminus \\{x\\} = \\emptyset$. The Stone-Cech compactification of the empty set is the empty set, $\\beta(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$. The remainder is $R = \\beta(\\emptyset) \\setminus \\emptyset = \\emptyset$. The empty set has 0 composants.\nSo, 0 is a possible number of composants for the remainder.\n\n**Case 2: $X$ is a non-degenerate continuum.**\nIf $X$ is a non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable continuum, it is also indecomposable.\n*   **Theorem (S. Mazurkiewicz, ~1920):** Any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., $2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants.\nSo, $X$ has $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants. Let the set of these composants be $\\mathcal{C}$.\nFor the given point $x \\in X$, exactly one of these composants contains $x$. Let's call it $C_x$.\nThe set of composants of $X$ that do not contain $x$ is $\\mathcal{C} \\setminus \\{C_x\\}$.\nThe number of such composants is $|\\mathcal{C}| - 1 = \\mathfrak{c} - 1 = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nNow, applying Bellamy's theorem, the number of composants of the remainder $R = \\beta(X\\setminus\\{x\\})\\setminus(X\\setminus\\{x\\})$ is equal to the number of composants of $X$ not containing $x$.\nThus, for any non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$, the number of composants of the remainder is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the maximum possible number\n\nFrom the analysis of the two cases, the possible values for the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder are 0 (for a degenerate continuum) and $\\mathfrak{c}$ (for a non-degenerate continuum).\n\nThe question asks for the **maximum possible number**. Comparing the two possible values, the maximum is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximum possible number of composants is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThe cardinality of the continuum is denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<$2^{\\aleph_0}$>>>"
