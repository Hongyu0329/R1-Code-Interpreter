    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\nThe primary task is to compute the determinant of the 3x3 matrix `A`:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe context \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" specifies the origin of this matrix in a particular mathematical theory, but it is not required for the calculation itself, as the matrix is explicitly provided.\n\n**2. List Careful Points and Choose a Method**\nThere are several methods to calculate the determinant of a 3x3 matrix.\n*   **Method A: Cofactor Expansion (Standard Formula):** This is a general method that always works.\n*   **Method B: Sarrus's Rule:** A mnemonic shortcut for 3x3 matrices only.\n*   **Method C: Using Matrix Properties:** Observing properties like linear dependence of rows or columns can simplify the calculation significantly. This is often the quickest method if such a property exists.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix for any special properties first (Method C).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis using Matrix Properties (Method C)**\n*   **Step 3.1: Examine the rows of the matrix.**\n    *   Row 1 (R1): `[2, -1, -1]`\n    *   Row 2 (R2): `[-1, 2, -1]`\n    *   Row 3 (R3): `[-1, -1, 2]`\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Check for linear dependence.** A simple way to check for linear dependence is to see if a combination of rows adds up to the zero vector. Let's add all three rows together.\n    *   `R1 + R2 + R3 = [2 + (-1) + (-1), -1 + 2 + (-1), -1 + (-1) + 2]`\n    *   `R1 + R2 + R3 = [2 - 1 - 1, -1 + 2 - 1, -1 - 1 + 2]`\n    *   `R1 + R2 + R3 = [0, 0, 0]`\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Apply the determinant property.**\n    *   A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that if the rows (or columns) of a matrix are linearly dependent, the determinant of the matrix is 0.\n    *   Since `R1 + R2 + R3 = 0`, the rows are linearly dependent. For example, `R3 = -R1 - R2`.\n    *   Therefore, the determinant of matrix `A` must be 0.\n\n**4. Verification using Cofactor Expansion (Method A)**\nTo be certain, we can verify the result with the standard formula.\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix `[[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]` is `a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n\n*   **Step 4.1: Apply the formula to matrix A.**\n    *   `a = 2`, `b = -1`, `c = -1`\n    *   `d = -1`, `e = 2`, `f = -1`\n    *   `g = -1`, `h = -1`, `i = 2`\n\n*   **Step 4.2: Calculate.**\n    *   `det(A) = 2 * ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - (-1) * ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))`\n    *   `det(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 - (-2))`\n    *   `det(A) = 2 * (3) + 1 * (-3) - 1 * (1 + 2)`\n    *   `det(A) = 6 - 3 - 1 * (3)`\n    *   `det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3`\n    *   `det(A) = 0`\n\nBoth methods confirm the result.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThe determinant of the given matrix `A` is 0. The simplest way to see this is by noting that the sum of the three rows is the zero vector, which implies the rows are linearly dependent.\n\n<<<0>>>"
