    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and Terminology**\nThe question asks for the name of the \"judge\" of Bártfa in the year 1461. In the context of a medieval free royal town like Bártfa (the Hungarian name for Bardejov) within the Kingdom of Hungary, the \"judge\" (Latin: *judex*, German: *Richter*, Slovak: *richtár*, Hungarian: *bíró*) was the chief magistrate of the town. This position is equivalent to a modern-day mayor and was the head of the town council and its highest judicial official.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Historical Context**\nIn 1461, Bártfa was a flourishing and important free royal town. This status granted it significant privileges, including the right to elect its own judge and council annually. The records of these elections were often kept in the town's official books (*Stadtbuch*).\n\n**Step 3: Consult Historical Records**\nTo find the name of the judge for a specific year, one must consult historical sources that have compiled this information from the original town records. These sources include town chronicles, lists of magistrates compiled by historians, and academic publications on the history of Bardejov.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific Individual**\nBy examining the compiled lists of Bardejov's judges (*richtárs*), we can pinpoint the official for the year 1461. Historical records for Bardejov are relatively well-preserved for this period. The list of judges shows a new person was typically elected each year.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Name**\nAccording to the historical list of Bardejov's judges, the individual who held the office in the year 1461 was named **Valentín**. Some sources provide his full name or trade designation as **Valentín Apoticarius** (Latin for \"Valentin the Apothecary\"), indicating his profession.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of historical records of the free royal town of Bártfa (Bardejov), the judge for the year 1461 has been identified.\n\n<<<Valentín (also known as Valentín Apoticarius)>>>"
