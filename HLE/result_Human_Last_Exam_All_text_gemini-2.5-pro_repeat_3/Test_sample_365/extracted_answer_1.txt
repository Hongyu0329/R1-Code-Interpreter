The product is a tricyclic ether, an isomer of the starting material, formed via a base-catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation. A new ether bond is formed between the oxygen of the original C2-hydroxyl group and the C5 carbon of the original norbornene double bond. This 5-exo-trig cyclization results in a new five-membered ether ring fused to the bicyclic framework. All other substituents, including the cyclopentenyl group, the TBS ether, and the dimethoxy ketal, remain unchanged.
