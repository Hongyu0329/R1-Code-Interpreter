    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** The key elements are:\n    *   A Russian translation of an essay.\n    *   The essay describes the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   In this description, the surname of an English poet is mentioned.\n    *   The task is to name this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the source:** The question points to a specific, well-known literary reference. The author in question is the Nobel Prize-winning poet and essayist Joseph Brodsky. Although he later wrote in English and became an American citizen, his formative essays were written in Russian.\n\n3.  **Locate the specific reference:** In one of his essays where he describes his travels in Europe, Brodsky contrasts the cramped, vertical feel of his native Leningrad (St. Petersburg) with the spacious, horizontal layout of Western cities like Vienna.\n\n4.  **Analyze the description:** When describing the boulevards of Vienna (such as the famous Ringstrasse), Brodsky wanted to convey their impressive width. Instead of using a standard measurement or a simple adjective, he used a literary and cultural metaphor.\n\n5.  **Identify the poet and the metaphor:** He wrote that the streets were \"шириной с Байрона\" (pronounced \"shirinoy s Bayrona\"). This phrase translates literally to \"[with] a width of Byron.\" The poet he is referring to is the famous English Romantic poet, Lord Byron.\n\n6.  **Interpret the meaning:** Brodsky wasn't saying the street was named after Byron. He was using Byron's name as a symbol of immense scale, grandeur, and a larger-than-life persona. The \"width\" of Byron's fame, influence, and epic life was used as a metaphor for the physical width of the Viennese boulevards.\n\n7.  **Address the \"translation\" aspect:** The essay was originally written in Russian by Brodsky. The question refers to the text as a \"Russian translation\" which might mean either the standard Russian text as read today or a translation of an essay from another language. However, the reference is definitively from Brodsky's original Russian-language work.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   The connection is metaphorical, not literal. The poet's name is not on a street sign.\n*   The reference is highly specific to the work of Joseph Brodsky, a prominent figure in Russian and world literature.\n*   The comparison is based on the poet's cultural stature (\"width\" of influence) being used to describe physical width.\n*   The poet is Lord Byron, a central figure of English Romanticism.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the conclusion that the English poet's surname is Byron.\n\n<<<Byron>>>"
