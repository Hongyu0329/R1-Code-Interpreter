No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial for the purpose of calculating the normalized magnetic helicity of Alfv√©n Ion Cyclotron (AIC) waves. Your expectation is correct: because AIC waves propagate along the local magnetic field ($\vec{B}_0$), their helicity must be calculated using the magnetic field components perpendicular to $\vec{B}_0$.

The justification is as follows:
1.  **Parker Spiral:** The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) at L1 is governed by the Parker Spiral model. Due to the Sun's rotation, the magnetic field lines are spiral-shaped, not purely radial. At 1 AU (the location of L1), the average angle between the IMF and the radial direction is approximately 45 degrees. Therefore, the local magnetic field is not aligned with the radial direction.
2.  **Physical Definition of Helicity:** The helicity (polarization) of a wave is defined by the sense of rotation of the wave's vector field (in this case, the magnetic field) in the plane perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. For AIC waves, the propagation direction is along the local background magnetic field, $\vec{B}_0$.
3.  **Correct Calculation Method:** The rigorous method requires a coordinate transformation. One must first determine the average direction of the local magnetic field ($\vec{B}_0$) from the data and then rotate the coordinate system so that one axis is parallel to $\vec{B}_0$. The helicity is then calculated using the two magnetic field components perpendicular to this new axis.

Using components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., the Y and Z components in a standard GSE or RTN coordinate system) without this transformation is physically incorrect and would only be valid in the rare case that the IMF happened to be perfectly radial at that moment. Any definition suggesting this approach is likely a simplification for teaching purposes or an approximation used in some data analysis contexts, not the proper physical definition.
