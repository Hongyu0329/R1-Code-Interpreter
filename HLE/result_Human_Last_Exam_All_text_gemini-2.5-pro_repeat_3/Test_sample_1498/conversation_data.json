    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the core subject:** The question asks about a specific section within the Islamic poem `'Aqeedat al-'Awaam` (عقيدة العوام).\n2.  **Identify the author:** The author is correctly named as Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. This confirms we are dealing with the well-known text.\n3.  **Identify the specific content:** The question wants to know where the names of the Prophets (`Anbiya'`) are mentioned.\n4.  **Identify the required format:** The answer needs to specify the range of verses, using the Arabic term for a line of poetry, `bayt`.\n5.  **Task breakdown:**\n    *   First, I need to access or recall the text of the poem `'Aqeedat al-'Awaam`.\n    *   Second, I must scan the poem to find the section dedicated to the Prophets.\n    *   Third, within that section, I must pinpoint the exact verses where the 25 prophets are listed by name.\n    *   Fourth, I need to determine the verse numbers for the start and end of this list based on standard numbering of the poem.\n    *   Finally, I will formulate the answer according to the user's instructions.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Verse Numbering:** Different publications or manuscripts of the poem might have slight variations in verse numbering, especially concerning the introductory lines. However, the block of verses containing the prophets' names is a contiguous and well-defined section, so the range should be consistent across most standard editions. The numbering used here is the most widely accepted one.\n2.  **The Scope of the \"Prophets Section\":** The poem mentions prophets before the list of names begins. For example, it discusses the attributes of prophets in general. The question specifically asks for where the **names** are mentioned, not the entire section discussing them. Therefore, one must distinguish between the general discussion and the specific enumeration.\n3.  **The Name of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ):** In the final verse of the list, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is referred to by the name `Taha` (طَهَ), which is one of his appellations derived from the opening letters of Surah Taha in the Qur'an. He is also described as `Khatim` (خَاتِمٌ), meaning \"the Seal [of the Prophets]\".\n4.  **Total Count:** The poem explicitly lists the 25 prophets whom Muslims are required to know by name as part of their foundational creed. The analysis must confirm that the identified verses contain all 25 names.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  The poem `'Aqeedat al-'Awaam` is structured to teach the fundamentals of Islamic creed. After discussing the attributes of Allah, it moves on to the topic of His Messengers.\n2.  The author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, first establishes the obligation to know the prophets by name in detail. This is found in `Bayt` (verse) 30:\n    > حَتْمٌ عَلَى كُلِّ ذِي التَّكْلِيفِ مَعْرِفَةٌ ** بِأَنْبِيَاءٍ عَلَى التَّفْصِيلِ قَدْ عُلِمُوا\n    > (It is binding on every responsible person to know ** the prophets who have been known in detail)\n3.  However, this verse introduces the topic but does not list the names. The actual enumeration of the 25 prophets begins a few verses later.\n4.  The list of names starts in **Bayt 34**. This verse names Adam, Idris, Nuh (Noah), Hud, Salih, and Ibrahim (Abraham).\n    > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسٌ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعَ ** صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعُ\n5.  The list continues in **Bayt 35**, which names Lut (Lot), Isma'il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya'qub (Jacob), Yusuf (Joseph), and Ayyub (Job).\n    > لُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا ** يَعْقُوبُ يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى\n6.  The list proceeds in **Bayt 36**, naming Shu'ayb, Harun (Aaron), Musa (Moses), al-Yasa' (Elisha), Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud (David), and Sulayman (Solomon).\n    > شُعَيْبٌ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَاليَسَعْ ** ذُو الكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n7.  The list concludes in **Bayt 37**, which names Ilyas (Elijah), Yunus (Jonah), Zakariyya (Zechariah), Yahya (John), 'Isa (Jesus), and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ).\n    > إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ** عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n8.  Therefore, the specific verses that contain the names of the prophets are from Bayt 34 to Bayt 37 inclusive.\n\n<<<From Bayt 34 to Bayt 37>>>"
