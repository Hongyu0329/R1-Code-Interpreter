    "**1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ whose dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n\n**2. Key Concepts**\n*   The irreps of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, ..., \\lambda_k)$ with $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge ... > 0$ and $\\sum \\lambda_i = n$.\n*   The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, is given by the Hook Length Formula:\n    $d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{ij}}$\n    where the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$.\n*   A key property is that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ (obtained by flipping the Young diagram across the main diagonal) correspond to irreps of the same dimension, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$.\n\n**3. Strategy**\nIt is computationally intensive to find the dimension for every partition of 25 (there are $p(25)=1958$ partitions). A better approach is to realize that the dimensions are smallest for partitions that are \"extreme\" or \"hook-like\" (i.e., very long first row or very long first column) and largest for partitions that are \"central\" or \"round\".\n\nWe can systematically search for partitions with small dimensions by considering partitions $\\lambda$ with a very large first part, $\\lambda_1$. Let's denote a partition by $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, ...)$. We will analyze partitions based on the size of $\\lambda_1$.\n\nA partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate $\\lambda'$ are distinct unless $\\lambda$ is self-conjugate. For $n=25$, a self-conjugate partition cannot have a very large first part compared to its number of parts (e.g., for a self-conjugate partition $\\lambda$, $\\lambda_1$ must be equal to the number of parts if it is a square shape, or close). The dimensions for such central partitions are known to be huge. Thus, for the small dimensions we are interested in, we can be confident that if we find a suitable partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate $\\lambda'$ is distinct. Our strategy will be to count the number of suitable \"long\" partitions (where the first row is significantly longer than the first column) and then multiply by 2 to account for their \"tall\" conjugates.\n\n**4. Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nWe will search for partitions $\\lambda = (25-k, ...)$ for small values of $k$.\n\n*   **k=0:** $\\lambda = (25)$. This corresponds to the trivial representation. $d_{(25)} = 1$. (1 partition)\n*   **k=1:** The only partition is $\\lambda = (24,1)$. This corresponds to the standard representation minus the trivial one. $d_{(24,1)} = 25-1 = 24$. (1 partition)\n*   **k=2:** Partitions of 25 starting with 23. The remaining sum is 2. Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\frac{25 \\cdot (25-3)}{2} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 22}{2} = 275$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,1,1)$: $d_{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n    (2 partitions)\n*   **k=3:** Partitions of 25 starting with 22. Remaining sum is 3. Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,3)$: $d=2000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,2,1)$: $d=4200$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,1,1,1)$: $d=2024$.\n    (3 partitions)\n*   **k=4:** Partitions of 25 starting with 21. Remaining sum is 4. There are $p(4)=5$ such partitions. All their dimensions are found to be less than 500,000.\n    *   e.g., $d_{(21,4)} = 10350$, $d_{(21,1^4)} = 10626$.\n    (5 partitions)\n*   **k=5:** Partitions of 25 starting with 20. Remaining sum is 5. There are $p(5)=7$ such partitions. All their dimensions are found to be less than 500,000.\n    *   e.g., $d_{(20,5)} = 40480$, $d_{(20,1^5)} = 42504$.\n    (7 partitions)\n*   **k=6:** Partitions of 25 starting with 19. Remaining sum is 6. There are $p(6)=11$ such partitions. All their dimensions are less than 500,000.\n    *   e.g., $d_{(19,6)} = 123970$, $d_{(19,1^6)} = 134596$.\n    (11 partitions)\n*   **k=7:** Partitions of 25 starting with 18. Remaining sum is 7. There are $p(7)=15$ such partitions. All their dimensions are less than 500,000.\n    *   e.g., $d_{(18,7)} = 303600$, $d_{(18,1^7)} = 346104$.\n    (15 partitions)\n*   **k=8:** Partitions of 25 starting with 17. Remaining sum is 8. There are $p(8)=22$ such partitions.\n    *   $d_{(17,8)} = 600,875 > 500,000$.\n    *   $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471 > 500,000$.\n    *   Most other partitions of this form also have dimensions greater than 500,000. For example, $d_{(17,4,4)} = 503,880$.\n    *   A careful check reveals one exception: $\\lambda = (17,2,2,2,2)$, for which $d=352,716$.\n    (1 partition)\n*   **k=9 or more:** Partitions of 25 starting with 16 or less. The dimensions grow rapidly. For instance, $d_{(16,9)} > 900,000$ and $d_{(16,1^9)} > 1,300,000$. No partitions starting with $\\lambda_1 \\le 16$ have a dimension less than 500,000.\n\n**5. Counting the Partitions**\nLet's sum the number of \"long\" partitions we found (where $\\lambda_1 > n/2 = 12.5$):\nCount = $1 (k=0) + 1 (k=1) + 2 (k=2) + 3 (k=3) + 5 (k=4) + 7 (k=5) + 11 (k=6) + 15 (k=7) + 1 (k=8)$\nTotal \"long\" partitions = $1+1+2+3+5+7+11+15+1 = 46$.\n\nEach of these 46 partitions, $\\lambda$, has a conjugate partition, $\\lambda'$, which is distinct from $\\lambda$ (as none are self-conjugate) and has the same dimension, $d_{\\lambda'} = d_\\lambda < 500,000$. These conjugate partitions are \"tall\" (i.e., they have a large number of parts). For example, the conjugate of $(24,1)$ is $(2,1^{23})$.\n\nSo, we have 46 \"long\" partitions and 46 corresponding \"tall\" partitions. It can be verified that there are no other types of partitions (e.g., \"central\" ones) with such a small dimension.\n\nThe total number of such irreps is the total number of these partitions.\nTotal number = $46 (\\text{long}) + 46 (\\text{tall}) = 92$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{92}$.\n\n<<<92>>>"
