    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{4n}$):** The generalized quaternion group of order $4n$ is given by the presentation $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **The Specific Group:** We are considering the group of size 128. So, $|G| = 4n = 128$, which implies $n=32$. The group is $G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    *   The group $G$ has a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n    *   The elements of $G$ can be partitioned into two sets: $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$ and the coset $\\langle x \\rangle y = \\{x^i y \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$.\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it can be expressed as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. Our goal is to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n### **Step 2: Compute the $k$-th Powers of Elements**\n\nWe need to compute $g^k$ for every element $g \\in G$. We analyze the elements from the two partitions of $G$.\n\n1.  **Elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$**: For an element $g = x^i$, its $k$-th power is simply $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$. The set of all such powers is $\\{x^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\} = \\langle x^k \\rangle = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Elements in $\\langle x \\rangle y$**: For an element $g = x^i y$, let's first compute its square:\n    $g^2 = (x^i y)^2 = (x^i y)(x^i y) = x^i(yx^i)y = x^i(x^{-i}y)y = (x^i x^{-i})y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    A key observation is that the square of any element not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $x^{32}$.\n    Now we can compute the $k$-th power:\n    *   **If $k$ is even (let $k=2m$):**\n        $(x^i y)^k = (x^i y)^{2m} = ((x^i y)^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$.\n        The $k$-th power is the same element, $x^{32m}$, for all elements in the coset $\\langle x \\rangle y$.\n    *   **If $k$ is odd (let $k=2m+1$):**\n        $(x^i y)^k = (x^i y)^{2m}(x^i y) = x^{32m} x^i y$.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Power Subgroups $G^k$**\n\nNow we combine the results from Step 2 to find the set $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $k$ is an odd integer.**\n    $G^k = \\{ (x^i)^k \\} \\cup \\{ (x^j y)^k \\} = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle \\cup \\{ x^{32m}x^j y \\mid 0 \\le j < 64 \\}$, where $k=2m+1$.\n    *   Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$. Thus, $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$.\n    *   The set $\\{ x^{32m}x^j y \\mid 0 \\le j < 64 \\}$ is simply the coset $x^{32m}(\\langle x \\rangle y)$. Since multiplying by an element of $\\langle x \\rangle$ just permutes the elements of the coset, this set is equal to $\\langle x \\rangle y$.\n    *   Therefore, for any odd $k$, $G^k = \\langle x \\rangle \\cup \\langle x \\rangle y = G = Q_{128}$.\n    *   This gives us our first power subgroup: **$Q_{128}$**.\n\n*   **Case 2: $k$ is an even integer.**\n    Let $k=2m$.\n    $G^k = \\{ (x^i)^k \\} \\cup \\{ (x^j y)^k \\} = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle \\cup \\{ x^{32m} \\}$.\n    For this set to be a subgroup, the element $x^{32m}$ must be contained within the subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$. Let's verify this. Let $d = \\gcd(k, 64) = \\gcd(2m, 64)$. We need to show that $x^{32m}$ is a power of $x^d$, which is true if and only if $d$ divides $32m$.\n    By the definition of gcd, $d$ divides $k=2m$. If $d|2m$, then $d$ must also divide any multiple of $2m$, including $16 \\times (2m) = 32m$. The condition holds.\n    So, for any even $k$, the power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\n### **Step 4: Count the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nWe need to count how many unique subgroups we found.\n1.  From odd values of $k$, we found one subgroup: $Q_{128}$.\n2.  From even values of $k$, we found subgroups of the form $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$. These are cyclic subgroups of $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\nLet's find the possible subgroups from the even $k$ case. The subgroup is determined by the value of $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$, where $k$ is an even integer.\n*   Since $d$ is a divisor of 64, $d$ must be in the set $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n*   Since $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ and $k$ is even, $d$ must be a common divisor of an even number and 64. Therefore, $d$ must be even.\n*   The even divisors of 64 are $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n\nFor each of these even divisors $d$, can we find an even $k$ such that $\\gcd(k, 64) = d$? Yes, we can simply choose $k=d$. Since $d$ is an even divisor of 64, $k=d$ is an even number, and $\\gcd(d, 64) = d$.\nSo, the power subgroups generated by even values of $k$ are precisely the subgroups $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ for every even divisor $d$ of 64. These are:\n*   $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n*   $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n*   $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n*   $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n*   $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n*   $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\nThese 6 subgroups are all distinct since they have different orders.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Tally**\n\nThe set of all distinct power subgroups of $Q_{128}$ is the union of the results from the odd and even cases:\n1.  $Q_{128}$\n2.  $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$\n3.  $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$\n4.  $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$\n5.  $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$\n6.  $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$\n7.  $\\{1\\}$\n\nThese are 7 distinct subgroups. The first is the entire group, while the other six are distinct cyclic subgroups. Therefore, there are a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
