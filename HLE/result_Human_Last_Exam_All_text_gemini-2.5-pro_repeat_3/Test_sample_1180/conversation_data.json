    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the thickness of the double point.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the curve and the valuation.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\nThe valuation $v$ is on a field $K$ containing $\\mathbb{Q}$, it is an extension of the 2-adic valuation, and it is normalized such that $v(2)=1$. We work over the completion, which we can assume to be $K=\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the valuations of the roots of the polynomial.**\nLet $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The stable reduction of the curve is determined by the valuations of the roots of $f(x)=0$ and their differences. We use the Newton polygon method to find the valuations of the roots.\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = a_5 x^5 + a_3 x^3 + a_0$ with $a_5=2, a_3=2, a_0=1$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v(a_i))$ for $a_i \\neq 0$:\n$P_0 = (0, v(1)) = (0,0)$\n$P_3 = (3, v(2)) = (3,1)$\n$P_5 = (5, v(2)) = (5,1)$\n\nThe Newton polygon is the lower convex hull of these points.\nLet's check the slopes. The slope of the segment from $P_0$ to $P_3$ is $(1-0)/(3-0)=1/3$. The slope of the segment from $P_0$ to $P_5$ is $(1-0)/(5-0)=1/5$.\nSince $1/5 < 1/3$, the first segment of the hull must connect to $P_5$, assuming no other point lies below this segment.\nThe line segment connecting $P_0(0,0)$ and $P_5(5,1)$ is given by the equation $y=x/5$.\nLet's check the position of the point $P_3(3,1)$. At $x=3$, the line is at $y=3/5$. Since $1 > 3/5$, the point $P_3$ lies *above* the segment $P_0P_5$.\nTherefore, the lower convex hull consists of a single segment from $(0,0)$ to $(5,1)$.\n\nThe slope of this segment is $m = 1/5$. The horizontal length of this segment is 5.\nAccording to the Newton polygon theorem, there are 5 roots, and their valuations are equal to the negative of the slope.\nSo, for all five roots $\\alpha_1, ..., \\alpha_5$ of $f(x)$, we have $v(\\alpha_i) = -m = -1/5$.\n\nThis can be verified by considering the reciprocal polynomial $f^*(x) = x^5 f(1/x) = x^5(2/x^5 + 2/x^3 + 1) = 2 + 2x^2 + x^5$. The roots of $f^*(x)$ are $\\beta_i = 1/\\alpha_i$. The Newton polygon for $f^*(x)$ has points $(0, v(2)=1), (2, v(2)=1), (5, v(1)=0)$. The hull is a single segment from $(0,1)$ to $(5,0)$, with slope $m' = (0-1)/(5-0) = -1/5$. The valuations of the roots of $f^*$ are $v(\\beta_i) = -m' = 1/5$. Since $\\alpha_i = 1/\\beta_i$, we have $v(\\alpha_i) = -v(\\beta_i) = -1/5$. This confirms our calculation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the clustering of roots.**\nSince all roots have the same valuation, they form a single cluster. To determine the structure of the stable reduction, we need to check if this cluster can be refined. This is done by \"zooming in\" on the roots.\nWe perform a change of variables. Let's pass to a field extension $L/K$ with ramification index $e=5$, for instance $L = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\pi)$ with $\\pi^5 = -2$. The valuation $v_L$ on $L$ is normalized so that $v_L(\\pi)=1$. Then $v_L(2)=v_L(-\\pi^5)=5$. The original valuation is $v = v_L/5$.\nThe roots have valuation $v_L(\\alpha_i) = 5 \\cdot v(\\alpha_i) = 5 \\cdot (-1/5) = -1$.\nLet's define new variables $y$ by $x = y/\\pi$. The roots $y_i = \\pi \\alpha_i$ of the transformed polynomial will have valuation $v_L(y_i) = v_L(\\pi) + v_L(\\alpha_i) = 1 + (-1) = 0$. So the $y_i$ are units in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_L$.\nLet's find the polynomial for $y$.\n$f(y/\\pi) = 2(y/\\pi)^5 + 2(y/\\pi)^3 + 1 = 0$\n$2y^5/\\pi^5 + 2y^3/\\pi^3 + 1 = 0$\nMultiply by $\\pi^5$: $2y^5 + 2\\pi^2 y^3 + \\pi^5 = 0$.\nUsing $2=-\\pi^5$: $(-\\pi^5)y^5 + (-\\pi^5)\\pi^2 y^3 + \\pi^5 = 0$.\nDividing by $-\\pi^5$: $y^5 + \\pi^2 y^3 - 1 = 0$.\nLet $g(y) = y^5 + \\pi^2 y^3 - 1$. The roots of this polynomial are the rescaled roots $y_i$.\nTo check for sub-clusters, we examine the roots of $g(y)$ over the residue field $k_L = \\mathbb{F}_2$.\n$\\bar{g}(y) = y^5 - 1 = y^5+1 \\pmod \\pi$.\nThe roots of $y^5+1=0$ in $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_2$ are the 5th roots of unity. The polynomial factors as $(y+1)(y^4+y^3+y^2+y+1)$. The second factor is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. The roots are all distinct in the extension field $\\mathbb{F}_{16}$.\nSince the roots $\\bar{y}_i$ of the reduced polynomial are distinct, Hensel's lemma implies that the roots $y_i$ themselves are distinct and $v_L(y_i-y_j)=0$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the stable reduction and find the thickness.**\nThe structure of the stable reduction is determined by the valuation of the differences of roots.\n$v(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j) = v((y_i-y_j)/\\pi) = v(y_i-y_j) - v(\\pi)$.\nIn our original valuation $v$, $v(y_i-y_j) = v_L(y_i-y_j)/5 = 0/5=0$. And $v(\\pi)=1/5$.\nSo, $v(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j) = 0 - 1/5 = -1/5$ for all $i \\neq j$.\nThe fact that all pairwise distances $v(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j)$ are equal and there is only one cluster of roots implies that the stable reduction of the curve consists of a single component. This component is the normalization of the special fiber of the model $z^2 = g(y) = y^5 + \\pi^2 y^3 - 1$.\nThe special fiber is $C_0: z^2 = y^5+1$. We must check if this curve is stable. A curve is stable if its only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\nThe affine part of $C_0$ is smooth. The point at infinity is singular. The local equation at this singularity is $w^3=y^5$ (up to constants and higher order terms), which is a higher-order cusp, not a node.\nTherefore, the special fiber is not stable. The stable reduction process resolves this singularity. This resolution process replaces the cusp with a chain of $\\mathbb{P}^1$s. The original component (the normalization of $z^2=y^5+1$) gets connected to this chain at a node. This must be the double point mentioned in the question.\n\nThe thickness of such a double point, which arises from resolving a model whose branch points have \"collided\", is related to the valuations of the branch points. In our transformed model $z^2=g(y)$, all the roots $y_i$ are units. The reduction $\\bar{g}(y)$ has distinct roots. The model is regular except at the point at infinity of the special fiber.\nThe formation of this cusp at infinity is due to all the roots $\\alpha_i$ sharing the same valuation $v(\\alpha_i)=-1/5$. The model is constructed by a scaling $x=y/\\pi$ where $v(\\pi)=-v(\\alpha_i)=1/5$. This scaling parameter's valuation represents the radius of the disc containing all the roots. In the context of stable reduction models, this value corresponds to the length of the edge in the reduction graph that connects the component to the \"base\" vertex representing the chosen origin for scaling. This length is interpreted as the thickness of the resulting node.\nThe thickness of the double point is the valuation of the scaling parameter used to separate the roots, which is $1/5$.\n\nFinal verification: The thickness must be a positive rational number, and $1/5$ is a plausible value. It is directly derived from the properties of the polynomial defining the curve."
