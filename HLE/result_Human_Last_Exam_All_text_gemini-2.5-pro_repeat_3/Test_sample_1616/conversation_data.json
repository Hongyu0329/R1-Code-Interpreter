    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept: Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing (also known as Trisyllabic Shortening) is a historical sound change rule in English. The rule states that a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable of a word. The antepenultimate syllable is the third syllable from the end. For this rule to apply, a word must have at least three syllables.\n\n*   **Tense Vowels:** /iː/ (as in *serene*), /eɪ/ (as in *sane*), /aɪ/ (as in *divine*), /oʊ/ (as in *cone*), /uː/ (as in *crude*).\n*   **Lax Vowels:** /ɛ/ (as in *serenity*), /æ/ (as in *sanity*), /ɪ/ (as in *divinity*), /ɒ/ (as in *conic*), /ʌ/ (as in *suffer*).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each word to see if it underwent Trisyllabic Laxing.**\n\nWe will look at each word, determine its syllable count, identify the relevant vowel, and compare it to a related word with a tense vowel.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    *   Syllabification: `se-ren-i-ty` (4 syllables).\n    *   Antepenultimate syllable: `-ren-`.\n    *   Related word: `serene` (pronounced with a tense vowel /iː/).\n    *   Analysis: In `serenity`, the vowel in the antepenultimate syllable is /ɛ/, which is the lax version of the /iː/ in `serene`. This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   Verdict: **Has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**\n    *   Syllabification: `de-riv-a-tive` (4 syllables).\n    *   Antepenultimate syllable: `-riv-`.\n    *   Related word: `derive` (pronounced with a tense diphthong /aɪ/).\n    *   Analysis: In `derivative`, the vowel in the antepenultimate syllable is /ɪ/, which is the lax version of the /aɪ/ in `derive`. This is another classic example.\n    *   Verdict: **Has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    *   Syllabification: `grat-i-tude` (3 syllables).\n    *   Antepenultimate syllable: `grat-`.\n    *   Related word: `grateful` (pronounced with a tense vowel /eɪ/).\n    *   Analysis: In `gratitude`, the vowel in the antepenultimate syllable is /æ/, which is the lax version of the /eɪ/ in `grateful`.\n    *   Verdict: **Has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the remaining words.**\n\nThe answer must be one of the remaining words, which have not undergone the process.\n\n*   **southern**\n    *   Syllabification: `south-ern` (2 syllables).\n    *   Analysis: Because `southern` only has two syllables, it cannot undergo *trisyllabic* laxing, as there is no antepenultimate (third-from-end) syllable. While its vowel (/ʌ/) is a shortened form related to the vowel in `south` (/aʊ/), this change is due to a different historical shortening rule, not trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   Verdict: **Has not undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    *   Syllabification: `pleas-ant` (2 syllables).\n    *   Analysis: Like `southern`, `pleasant` is a two-syllable word and thus does not meet the structural requirement for trisyllabic laxing. The vowel change from `please` (/iː/) to `pleasant` (/ɛ/) is a different type of shortening, often occurring before consonant clusters.\n    *   Verdict: **Has not undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**\n    *   Syllabification: `shad-ow` (2 syllables).\n    *   Analysis: `shadow` is also a two-syllable word and cannot have undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   Verdict: **Has not undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between the final candidates (`southern`, `pleasant`, `shadow`).**\n\nAll three words are technically correct answers because none are trisyllabic. However, in this type of question, we must find the *best* answer by looking more closely at the phonological history.\n\n*   For both `southern` and `pleasant`, a vowel laxing/shortening rule *did* apply during their development, it just wasn't the trisyllabic laxing rule. A historically long vowel in a related form was shortened.\n*   For `shadow`, the case is different. It comes from the Old English word `sceadu`, which already had a short vowel. The related modern word `shade` comes from a different Old English noun (`scead`), which developed a long vowel later in its history (through Open Syllable Lengthening). Therefore, the short vowel in `shadow` is not the result of shortening the long vowel from `shade`. `shadow` simply inherited its short vowel. It never underwent a process of laxing from a long-vowel counterpart.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile `southern` and `pleasant` did not undergo *trisyllabic* laxing, they did undergo other forms of vowel laxing. `shadow` is the only word on the list whose vowel history does not involve a laxing process at all; its short vowel was inherited directly. Therefore, it is the most definitive example of a word that has not undergone this type of sound change.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
