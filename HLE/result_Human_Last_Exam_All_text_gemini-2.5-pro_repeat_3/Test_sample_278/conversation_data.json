    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the parametric curve definition.**\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b\\sin t$\nwhere the parameter `b` depends on the interval of `t`:\n- For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $b=1$.\n- For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $b=5$.\n\nThis means the curve is composed of two different parts.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first part of the curve ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$).**\nIn this interval, the equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\sin t$\nIf we square and add these equations, we get $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of a unit circle.\nLet's check the range of `t`:\n- When $t=0$, $(x, y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n- When $t=\\pi/2$, $(x, y) = (\\cos(\\pi/2), \\sin(\\pi/2)) = (0, 1)$.\n- When $t=\\pi$, $(x, y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\nSince $\\sin t \\ge 0$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, this part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of radius 1, centered at the origin.\nFor this part, the range of x is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y is $[0, 1]$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second part of the curve ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$).**\nIn this interval, the equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5\\sin t$\nFrom these, we can write $x = \\cos t$ and $y/5 = \\sin t$. Squaring and adding gives $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis.\nLet's check the range of `t`:\n- As $t \\to \\pi^+$, $(x, y) \\to (\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$. This point connects continuously with the end of the first part.\n- When $t=3\\pi/2$, $(x, y) = (\\cos(3\\pi/2), 5\\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n- As $t \\to 2\\pi^-$, $(x, y) \\to (\\cos(2\\pi), 5\\sin(2\\pi)) = (1, 0)$. This connects back to the starting point of the whole curve.\nSince $\\sin t < 0$ for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, this part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse.\nFor this part, the range of x is $[-1, 1]$ and the range of y is $[-5, 0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the bounding box for the entire figure.**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for `x` and `y` by combining the ranges from both parts.\n- **Range of x:** In both parts, $x = \\cos t$. Over the full interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, the value of $\\cos t$ ranges from -1 to 1. So, $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$.\n- **Range of y:**\n    - From the first part ($y = \\sin t$), y ranges from 0 to 1.\n    - From the second part ($y = 5\\sin t$), y ranges from -5 to 0.\n    - Combining these, the total range for y is from -5 to 1. So, $y_{min} = -5$ and $y_{max} = 1$.\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle defined by $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in [-5, 1]$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the dimensions of the smallest enclosing square.**\nThe width of the figure's bounding box is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\nThe height of the figure's bounding box is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\nA square that encloses this figure must have a side length that is at least as large as both the width and the height. Therefore, the side length `S` of the smallest possible square must be the maximum of these two dimensions.\n$S = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the area of the smallest square.**\nThe area of a square with side length `S` is $S^2$.\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n- **Piecewise Definition:** The most critical point is noticing that `b` is not a constant, which means the curve is not a simple ellipse or circle.\n- **Bounding Box:** The smallest enclosing square is determined by the overall width and height of the figure. You must find the global extrema for x and y over the entire interval of `t`.\n- **Final Answer:** The question asks for the area of the square, not its side length.\n\nThe final figure is an upper semi-circle on top of a lower semi-ellipse. The maximum extent is from $y=1$ to $y=-5$ (height of 6) and from $x=-1$ to $x=1$ (width of 2). The smallest enclosing square must have a side length of 6.\n\n<<<36>>>"
