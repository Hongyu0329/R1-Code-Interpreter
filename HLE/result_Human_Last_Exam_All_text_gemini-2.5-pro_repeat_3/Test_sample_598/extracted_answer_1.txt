Yes, such a combination of parameters and a pair of graphs exists. For the parameters $(n,d,\lambda,\mu)=(16,6,2,2)$, there are two non-isomorphic strongly regular graphs: the $L_2(4)$ graph and the Shrikhande graph. Since they share the same parameters, they are co-spectral and thus have the same number of closed walks of any given length. However, they have been shown to possess different numbers of 5-cycles. Specifically, the $L_2(4)$ graph has 192 (or 384, depending on convention) 5-cycles, while the Shrikhande graph has 120 (or 240) 5-cycles.
