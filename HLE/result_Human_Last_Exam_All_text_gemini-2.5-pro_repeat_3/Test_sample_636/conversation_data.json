    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` for a linear system defined by matrices `A` and `B`. The control law is applied such that the new system matrix, `A_cl = A + BF`, has its eigenvalues at specific locations in the complex plane, namely at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Define Variables**\n*   System matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n*   The system is 2nd order (since A is 2x2) and has 2 inputs (since B is 2x2).\n*   The feedback gain matrix `F` must be a 2x2 matrix for the matrix multiplication `BF` to be valid and result in a 2x2 matrix. Let's define `F` as:\n    `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n*   The desired eigenvalues are `λ_d1 = -1 + j` and `λ_d2 = -1 - j`.\n\n**3. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe characteristic polynomial of a system determines its eigenvalues. For a system with the desired eigenvalues, the characteristic polynomial `p_d(λ)` is:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - λ_d1) * (λ - λ_d2)`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j)) * (λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j) * ((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\nThis is the target characteristic polynomial for our closed-loop system.\n\n**4. Determine the Actual Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\nFirst, we compute the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF`.\n*   Calculate `BF`:\n    `BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n*   Calculate `A_cl = A + BF`:\n    `A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]] = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\nNext, we find the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl`, which is `p_act(λ) = det(λI - A_cl)`.\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ - (-1 + f1 + 2*f3), -(1 + f2 + 2*f4)], [-(1 + f1), λ - f2]]`\n`det(λI - A_cl) = (λ + 1 - f1 - 2*f3)(λ - f2) - (-(1 + f2 + 2*f4))(-(1 + f1))`\n`det(λI - A_cl) = λ^2 - f2*λ + (1 - f1 - 2*f3)λ - f2(1 - f1 - 2*f3) - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)`\nExpanding and collecting terms by powers of `λ`:\n*   `λ^2` term: `λ^2`\n*   `λ^1` term: `-f2 + 1 - f1 - 2*f3`\n*   `λ^0` term (constant): `-f2(1 - f1 - 2*f3) - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `= -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1*f2 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n    `= -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n\nSo, the actual characteristic polynomial is:\n`p_act(λ) = λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**5. Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\nNow, we equate the coefficients of `p_act(λ)` with those of the desired polynomial `p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n*   Comparing coefficients of `λ^1`:\n    `1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3 = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1`  (Equation 1)\n*   Comparing coefficients of `λ^0`:\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `f1 + 2*f2 - 2*f2*f3 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4 = -3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This indicates that there is no unique solution for `F`; there are infinite possible `F` matrices. We can find one solution by making a simplifying choice. A common approach is to set some elements of `F` to zero.\n\nLet's assume `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. This simplifies the equations significantly.\n*   Equation 1 becomes: `f1 + f2 + 2(0) = -1` => `f1 + f2 = -1`\n*   Equation 2 becomes: `f1 + 2*f2 - 2*f2(0) + 2(0) + 2*f1(0) = -3` => `f1 + 2*f2 = -3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `f1 + 2*f2 = -3`\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(f1 + 2*f2) - (f1 + f2) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` back into Equation 1:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nSo, we have found one possible solution: `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\nThis gives the feedback gain matrix:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**6. Verification**\nLet's verify this solution by calculating the eigenvalues of `A + BF` with our found `F`.\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\nSubstituting `f1=1, f2=-2, f3=0, f4=0`:\n`A_cl = [[-1 + 1 + 0, 1 + (-2) + 0], [1 + 1, -2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThis is exactly our desired characteristic polynomial. The roots of this quadratic equation are:\n`λ = [-2 ± sqrt(2^2 - 4*1*2)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [-2 ± 2j] / 2 = -1 ± j`\nThe verification is successful.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Sign Convention**: The problem specifies the closed-loop matrix as `A + BF`, which corresponds to a control law `u = Fx`. This is different from the more common formulation `A - BF` (from `u = -Fx`). Be careful to use the correct signs throughout the derivation.\n2.  **Non-uniqueness of Solution**: Since the system has multiple inputs (MIMO), there are more degrees of freedom than constraints. This leads to an infinite number of possible solutions for the feedback matrix `F`. The method of setting some elements of `F` to zero is a valid way to find one specific solution.\n3.  **Algebraic Manipulation**: The derivation of the characteristic polynomial involves expanding a 2x2 determinant with symbolic entries. This step is prone to algebraic errors, so it's important to be meticulous. Verifying the final answer is a good way to catch any such mistakes.\n4.  **Controllability**: For a solution to exist for any arbitrary pole placement, the pair (A, B) must be controllable. We can check this by finding the rank of the controllability matrix `C = [B, AB]`. In this case, `rank(B) = 2`, which is equal to the system order, so the system is controllable and a solution is guaranteed to exist.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, a valid state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
