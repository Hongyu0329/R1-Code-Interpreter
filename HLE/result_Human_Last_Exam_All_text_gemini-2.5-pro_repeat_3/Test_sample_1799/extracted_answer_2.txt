No, it is not true that the 2nd postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the first. The deduction requires the additional assumption that Maxwell's equations are fundamental laws that must obey the first postulate, which was the very problem Einstein sought to resolve. The second postulate is a crucial, independent assertion that resolves the conflict between classical mechanics and electromagnetism by identifying a finite, universal invariant speed.
