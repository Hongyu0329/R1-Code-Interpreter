    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `a, b \\in S` (including the case `a=b`), their product `ab` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S^2 \\cap S = \\emptyset`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `M` is maximal by inclusion (or simply maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. In other words, for any element `g \\in G \\setminus M`, the set `M \\cup \\{g\\}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Fills G:** A subset `S` of `G` fills `G` if every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or its inverse is in `S`. This can be written as `G = S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{1_G\\}`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called \"filled\" if *every* maximal product-free set in `G` fills `G`. This is a very strong condition.\n\n### Step 2: The Crucial Characterization of Filled Groups\n\nThe problem of checking every maximal product-free set for every possible group is intractable. We need a structural property of the group that is equivalent to being filled. A known theorem in this area of group theory provides exactly that.\n\n**Theorem:** A finite group `G` is a filled group if and only if it contains a unique element of order 2 (a unique involution).\n\n**Careful Point:** This theorem is the key to solving the problem. It transforms a complex combinatorial property (every maximal product-free set fills `G`) into a simple, verifiable structural property (existence of a unique involution). Our task is now simplified to finding all nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` that have exactly one element of order 2.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of Groups of Order `2q^m`\n\nLet `G` be a group of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m \\ge 1` is a natural number. We use Sylow's Theorems to analyze its structure.\n\n1.  **Sylow q-subgroup:** Let `P` be a Sylow `q`-subgroup of `G`. Its order is `|P| = q^m`. Let `n_q` be the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups.\n2.  According to Sylow's Third Theorem, `n_q` must divide the index of `P` in `G`, which is `|G|/|P| = (2q^m) / q^m = 2`. So, `n_q` can be 1 or 2.\n3.  Also, `n_q` must be congruent to `1` modulo `q`, i.e., `n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q`.\n4.  If we assume `n_q = 2`, then we would have `2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q`. This implies that `q` divides `2-1=1`, which is impossible for a prime `q`.\n5.  Therefore, `n_q` must be 1.\n\n**Careful Point:** Since there is only one Sylow `q`-subgroup, it must be a normal subgroup of `G`. We write this as `P \\unlhd G`.\n\n6.  **Sylow 2-subgroup:** Let `Q` be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Its order is `|Q|=2`. `Q` is cyclic, `Q \\cong C_2`. `Q` consists of the identity and one element of order 2.\n\nSince `P` is a normal subgroup and its order `q^m` is coprime to the order of `Q`, which is 2, `G` is a semidirect product of `P` and `Q`.\n`G \\cong P \\rtimes Q \\cong P \\rtimes C_2`.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Unique Involution Condition\n\nWe are looking for groups with a unique element of order 2. Let this unique involution be `t`.\n\nA second key theorem helps us here:\n\n**Theorem:** An involution `t` in a finite group `G` is the unique involution if and only if `t` is in the center of `G` (`t \\in Z(G)`), and the quotient group `G/\\langle t \\rangle` has no elements of order 2 (i.e., it has odd order, which is not quite right, but it cannot have involutions).\n\nLet's apply this to our group `G \\cong P \\rtimes C_2`. Let `t` be the non-identity element of `C_2`. This `t` is our candidate for the unique involution.\n\n1.  **Condition 1: `t` must be central.**\n    For `t` to be in `Z(G)`, it must commute with every element of `G`. Since it already commutes with elements of `C_2`, it must commute with every element `p \\in P`.\n    The commutation relation in the semidirect product is defined by the action of `C_2` on `P`. The action `t(p)` is conjugation, `tpt^{-1}`.\n    For `t` to be central, we need `tpt^{-1} = p` for all `p \\in P`. This means the homomorphism `\\phi: C_2 \\to Aut(P)` that defines the semidirect product must be the trivial homomorphism (i.e., it maps `t` to the identity automorphism on `P`).\n    When the action is trivial, the semidirect product becomes a direct product.\n    So, `G` must be of the form `G \\cong P \\times C_2`.\n\n2.  **Condition 2: `G/\\langle t \\rangle` has no involutions.**\n    If `G = P \\times C_2`, the subgroup generated by `t` is `\\{1\\} \\times C_2`.\n    The quotient group is `G/\\langle t \\rangle \\cong (P \\times C_2) / (\\{1\\} \\times C_2) \\cong P`.\n    So, the condition is that the group `P` must not have any elements of order 2.\n    The order of `P` is `q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in `P` must divide `q^m`. Since `q` is odd, any power of `q` is also odd. An element of order 2 cannot exist in `P`, as 2 does not divide `q^m`. This condition is therefore automatically satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion so far:** The filled groups of order `2q^m` are precisely the direct products `P \\times C_2`, where `P` is any group of order `q^m`.\n\n### Step 5: Imposing the Nonabelian Condition\n\nThe question asks for the **nonabelian** filled groups of this order.\nThe group `G = P \\times C_2` is nonabelian if and only if `P` is nonabelian (since `C_2` is abelian).\n\nSo we need to determine for which values of `m` a group `P` of order `q^m` can be nonabelian.\n*   If `m=1`, `|P|=q`. Any group of prime order is cyclic and thus abelian.\n*   If `m=2`, `|P|=q^2`. Any group of order `p^2` (for a prime `p`) is abelian.\n*   If `m \\ge 3`, for any odd prime `q`, there exist nonabelian groups of order `q^m`. For example, for `m=3`, the Heisenberg group over the field `F_q` is a nonabelian group of order `q^3`.\n\n### Final Answer Synthesis\n\nCombining all the steps:\n1.  A group is filled if and only if it has a unique involution.\n2.  A group `G` of order `2q^m` must be a semidirect product `P \\rtimes C_2` where `|P|=q^m`.\n3.  For `G` to have a unique involution, the product must be direct: `G \\cong P \\times C_2`.\n4.  For `G` to be nonabelian, the group `P` must be nonabelian.\n5.  Nonabelian groups `P` of order `q^m` exist if and only if `m \\ge 3`.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are the groups that can be expressed as a direct product `P \\times C_2`, where `P` is any nonabelian group of order `q^m` (`q` is an odd prime, `m \\ge 3`) and `C_2` is the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the groups isomorphic to a direct product `P \\times C_2`, where `P` is any nonabelian group of order `q^m` and `C_2` is the cyclic group of order 2. Such nonabelian groups `P` exist if and only if `m \\ge 3`.>>>"
