The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the groups isomorphic to a direct product `P \times C_2`, where `P` is any nonabelian group of order `q^m` and `C_2` is the cyclic group of order 2. Such nonabelian groups `P` exist if and only if `m \ge 3`.
