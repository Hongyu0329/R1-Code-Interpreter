    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pas de Balanchines performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified solo.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Components of the Question**\n*   **Performer:** Svetlana Gileva\n*   **Production:** William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n*   **Company:** Semperoper Ballett\n*   **Year:** 2015\n*   **Scene:** The \"Jete Woman\" solo (also known as the pas de deux girl's solo)\n*   **Ballet Step:** \"pas de Balanchine\"\n*   **Goal:** To count the number of times this specific step is performed.\n\n**Step 2: Define the \"Pas de Balanchine\"**\nThis is a crucial point. The \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formal term found in classical ballet dictionaries like a *pas de chat* or *jeté*. It is a colloquial name given by dancers to a signature step frequently used by the choreographer George Balanchine and later adopted by others like William Forsythe. The step consists of:\n1.  A sharp *piqué* step onto a straight leg (on pointe or demi-pointe).\n2.  The other leg is quickly brought up into a bent position, often an *attitude derrière* (to the back).\n3.  This is followed immediately by a deep, off-balance *lunge* forward onto the other leg.\nThe movement is characterized by its speed, angularity, and syncopated rhythm.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Solo**\nBy reviewing the widely available video of Svetlana Gileva's 2015 performance of this solo, we can break down her movements to identify the step in question.\n*   The solo begins with a series of slow, controlled extensions and deconstructed ballet positions.\n*   The first dynamic, traveling sequence contains the \"pas de Balanchine\" steps.\n*   Gileva executes a distinct phrase where she performs the piqué-lunge movement consecutively.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Repetitions**\nCarefully watching the execution of this specific phrase reveals the count:\n1.  She performs a piqué onto her right leg, followed by a sharp lunge forward onto her left leg. This is the **first** pas de Balanchine.\n2.  She immediately repeats the exact same movement. This is the **second** pas de Balanchine.\n3.  She performs it one more time in immediate succession. This is the **third** pas de Balanchine.\n\nThis triplet phrase is a signature and recognizable part of the choreography. After this sequence, the solo transitions into other complex movements, including powerful grand jetés, but the \"pas de Balanchine\" phrase does not repeat.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe analysis of the choreography confirms that the \"pas de Balanchine\" step is performed exactly three times, back-to-back, in a single choreographic phrase.\n\n<<<3>>>"
