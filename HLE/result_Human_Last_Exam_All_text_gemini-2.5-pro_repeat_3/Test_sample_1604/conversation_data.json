    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Lady Butler and her work\nFirst, we need to understand who Lady Butler was. Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933), was a prominent British painter who specialized in military scenes. Her work is notable for its realism and focus on the experiences of ordinary soldiers. The question requires us to identify the latest historical event among all the battles she painted. This means we must differentiate between the date a painting was created and the date of the historical event it portrays.\n\n### Step 2: List Lady Butler's major battle paintings and the historical events they depict\nWe will compile a list of her famous paintings and identify the specific battle or military campaign each one represents, along with the date of that event.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which took place on **June 16, 1815**, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo, on **June 18, 1815**.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Shows a roll call of the Grenadier Guards after the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War. The Battle of Inkerman was on **November 5, 1854**.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Portrays the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava, on **October 25, 1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the famous defence during the Anglo-Zulu War, which occurred on **January 22–23, 1879**.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1898): Illustrates an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War. The battle was on **January 28, 1881**.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted 1885): Shows the Highland Brigade at the Battle of Tel El Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War on **September 13, 1882**.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted c. 1890s): Depicts the British Camel Corps during the Nile Expedition of **1884–1885**, which was an attempt to relieve Major-General Gordon during the Mahdist War.\n*   ***The Gates of Damascus*** (painted in the 1920s): This later work depicts the 1st Australian Light Horse Brigade entering Damascus. This event, the Capture of Damascus, was part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I and took place on **October 1, 1918**.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the dates of the historical events\nNow, let's list the dates of the battles and campaigns in chronological order to find the latest one.\n\n1.  Battle of Quatre Bras: **1815**\n2.  Battle of Waterloo: **1815**\n3.  Battle of Balaclava / Inkerman (Crimean War): **1854**\n4.  Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n5.  Battle of Laing's Nek (First Boer War): **1881**\n6.  Battle of Tel El Kebir: **1882**\n7.  Nile Expedition: **1884-1885**\n8.  Capture of Damascus (World War I): **1918**\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the analysis\nBy comparing the dates, it is clear that the Capture of Damascus in 1918 is the latest historical event depicted in a painting by Lady Butler. The painting itself is titled *The Gates of Damascus*.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Focus on the event's date, not the painting's date:** *Scotland for Ever!* was painted in 1881, but it depicts the Battle of Waterloo from 1815. The question is about the historical timeline of the battles themselves.\n*   **Inclusion of later, less famous works:** While Lady Butler is most famous for her Victorian-era paintings, her career extended into the 20th century. It is crucial to consider her later works, like *The Gates of Damascus*, to find the correct answer.\n*   **Specificity of the \"battle\":** The event is the Capture of Damascus, a key military action at the end of World War I's Middle Eastern theatre.\n\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Capture of Damascus.\n\n<<<Capture of Damascus>>>"
