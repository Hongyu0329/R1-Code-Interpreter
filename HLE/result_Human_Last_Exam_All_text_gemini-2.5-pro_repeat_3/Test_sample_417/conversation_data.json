    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given molecule.\n\n**Molecule:** 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the overall structure and symmetry of the molecule.**\n\n*   The core of the molecule is a hexasubstituted benzene ring: 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene with large substituents at the 1,3,5-positions.\n*   The three substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 are identical: `[((4S,7R)-...)-indazol-2-yl)methyl]`.\n*   The three substituents at positions 2, 4, and 6 are identical: methyl groups (`-CH3`).\n*   This substitution pattern (1,3,5-A and 2,4,6-B) gives the entire molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. The axis passes through the center of the benzene ring, perpendicular to its plane.\n*   **Careful Point:** Due to this C3 symmetry, the three large substituent \"arms\" are chemically equivalent to each other, and the three methyl groups on the central ring are also chemically equivalent to each other. Therefore, we only need to determine the number of unique proton signals in *one* of the large arms and *one* of the central methyl groups.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the protons on the central benzene core.**\n\n*   There are three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6. Because of the C3 symmetry, these three methyl groups are chemically equivalent.\n*   They will produce a single peak in the 1H NMR spectrum (with an integration of 9H).\n*   **Number of signals from the core methyls = 1**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the linker protons.**\n\n*   Each large substituent is connected to the central ring by a methylene (`-CH2-`) group (this is the `methyl` in `(...)methyl]`).\n*   The three `-CH2-` linkers are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n*   Let's consider one `-CH2-` group. It is attached to the central aromatic ring on one side and to a chiral center on the other side. The entire `((4S,7R)-...)-indazol-2-yl` group is a chiral moiety.\n*   **Careful Point:** Protons on a methylene group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic. This means they are in chemically different environments and are non-equivalent. They will have different chemical shifts and will typically appear as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet) due to geminal coupling.\n*   **Number of signals from the linker -CH2- group = 2**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the protons within one chiral substituent group.**\n\n*   The substituent is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. This is a complex, rigid, chiral bicyclic system derived from camphor. The key is that it is chiral and lacks any internal plane of symmetry. This means that protons that are not related by methyl group rotation will be chemically unique.\n*   Let's identify and count the unique sets of protons in this fragment (let's call it 'R'):\n    1.  **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** There is one proton on the five-membered pyrazole ring. This is a unique environment. **(1 signal)**\n    2.  **Bicyclic Skeleton Protons (non-methyl):** The saturated bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (norbornane) part of the structure contains several protons. Based on the structure derived from camphor (or the systematic name), we have:\n        *   One bridgehead proton (-CH-). **(1 signal)**\n        *   Two methylene groups (-CH2-). Since the entire fragment is asymmetric, the two protons within each methylene group are diastereotopic, and the two methylene groups themselves are in different environments. This gives four unique protons. **(4 signals)**\n    3.  **Methyl Protons:** The name specifies three methyl groups (`7,8,8-trimethyl` or `1,7,7-trimethyl` in camphor nomenclature).\n        *   These three methyl groups are all in different chemical environments within the rigid, asymmetric structure. For example, in the camphor-derived structure, there is one methyl at the C1 bridgehead and a gem-dimethyl pair at the C7 bridge. The two gem-dimethyls are diastereotopic because they are on a prochiral center in a chiral molecule. Therefore, all three methyl groups are non-equivalent. **(3 signals)**\n\n*   **Total signals from one chiral substituent group (R):**\n    *   1 (from pyrazole H) + 1 (from bridgehead CH) + 4 (from 2x CH2) + 3 (from 3x CH3) = **9 signals**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of expected peaks.**\n\n*   Sum the signals from each unique part of the molecule:\n    *   Total Signals = (Signals from core methyls) + (Signals from linker CH2) + (Signals from one R group)\n    *   Total Signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 distinct peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Core Methyls: 1 signal\n*   Linker CH2: 2 signals (diastereotopic)\n*   Chiral Group R:\n    *   Pyrazole H: 1\n    *   Aliphatic CH/CH2: 5\n    *   Methyls: 3\n    *   Subtotal for R: 9 signals\n*   Total: 1 + 2 + 9 = 12 signals.\n\nThe analysis is consistent.\n\n<<<H>>>"
