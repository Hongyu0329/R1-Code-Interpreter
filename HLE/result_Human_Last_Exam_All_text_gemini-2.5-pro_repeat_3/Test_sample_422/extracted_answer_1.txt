Problem 1: The model conflates rational error with irrationality. The "Belief" state serves as a catch-all for any belief that is not knowledge. This means it includes both Justified False Beliefs (e.g., a scientist's well-supported but incorrect theory) and Unjustified Beliefs (e.g., a superstition). The framework thus loses the crucial epistemic distinction between being reasonably mistaken and being irrational.

Problem 2: The model creates an unsolvable regress problem for justification. For a belief to be "Knowledge", it needs justification, which comes from other beliefs. If these justifying beliefs must also be "Knowledge", it creates an impossible infinite regress. If they can be mere "Beliefs", then knowledge is being grounded by propositions that are not themselves known and could be false or unjustified, which undermines the entire point of the justification condition.
