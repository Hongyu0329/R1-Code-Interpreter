    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks us to identify two problems with the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge, given two very specific constraints:\n1.  Our only available epistemic states are **Knowledge** and **Belief**.\n2.  **Gettier problems** are to be ignored.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **JTB Definition:** Knowledge is defined as a belief that is simultaneously Justified, True, and a Belief. All three conditions must be met for a state to be considered Knowledge.\n2.  **The Two-State System:** This is the most critical constraint. Any epistemic state regarding a proposition must be either \"Knowledge\" or \"Belief\". There are no other categories like \"doubt\", \"unjustified belief\", or \"justified false belief\" as distinct states.\n3.  **Defining \"Belief\":** Since \"Knowledge\" is precisely defined as JTB, the state of \"Belief\" must logically be its complement. Therefore, \"Belief\" is the state one is in when one has a belief, but at least one of the JTB conditions is not met. This means the state of \"Belief\" includes:\n    *   Justified False Beliefs (JFB)\n    *   Unjustified True Beliefs (UTB)\n    *   Unjustified False Beliefs (UFB)\n4.  **Ignoring Gettier Problems:** This means we should not focus on scenarios where all three JTB conditions are met, but intuition tells us it is not knowledge (e.g., cases of epistemic luck). The problems must lie elsewhere.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Answer\n\nBased on the points above, we can identify two fundamental problems that arise from these specific constraints.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis for Problem 1: The Problem of Falsehood and Conflation**\n\n1.  Consider a belief that is well-reasoned and strongly justified based on all available evidence, but happens to be false. A classic example is the Ptolemaic model of the universe; for centuries, it was rational and justified to believe the sun revolved around the Earth.\n2.  According to the JTB definition, since this belief is false, it cannot be Knowledge.\n3.  According to the two-state system, if it's not Knowledge, it must be categorized under the state of \"Belief\".\n4.  Now consider a belief that is completely unjustifiedâ€”a wild guess, a superstition, or a belief based on delusion. This is also not Knowledge because it lacks justification. Therefore, it also falls into the category of \"Belief\".\n5.  **The Problem:** The single category of \"Belief\" is forced to contain both **rational, justified errors** and **irrational, unjustified beliefs**. The framework loses all ability to distinguish between someone who is reasonably mistaken and someone who is being irrational. This conflation makes the state of \"Belief\" an epistemically crude and almost useless category, as it treats a scientist's falsified theory the same as a gambler's hunch.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis for Problem 2: The Problem of Justification and Infinite Regress**\n\n1.  Focus on the \"J\" (Justification) condition for Knowledge. For a person S to know a proposition P, S's belief in P must be justified.\n2.  Typically, a belief is justified by other supporting beliefs. Let's say belief P is justified by belief Q.\n3.  We must now ask: What is the epistemic status of the justifying belief Q? According to the two-state system, Q must be either \"Knowledge\" or \"Belief\".\n4.  **Scenario A: The justifier Q must be \"Knowledge\".** If this is the case, then Q itself must be a Justified True Belief. Its own justification will rely on another belief, R, which must also be \"Knowledge\", and so on. This creates an infinite regress where each justification requires a prior justification that is also knowledge. This is impossible for a finite mind to possess.\n5.  **Scenario B: The justifier Q can be a mere \"Belief\".** If this is the case, Q is not Knowledge. This means Q could be unjustified or even false. How can a belief (P) be elevated to the certain status of \"Knowledge\" if its foundation (Q) is something that is not known and could be false or unjustified? This would make the justification condition too weak to guarantee knowledge.\n6.  **The Problem:** The JTB model, under this two-state constraint, runs into an unsolvable dilemma regarding justification. It either requires an impossible infinite chain of knowledge (infinite regress) or it must allow knowledge to be grounded in beliefs that are not themselves known, which seems to defeat the purpose of requiring justification in the first place.\n\n---\n\n<<<Problem 1: The model conflates rational error with irrationality. The \"Belief\" state serves as a catch-all for any belief that is not knowledge. This means it includes both Justified False Beliefs (e.g., a scientist's well-supported but incorrect theory) and Unjustified Beliefs (e.g., a superstition). The framework thus loses the crucial epistemic distinction between being reasonably mistaken and being irrational.\n\nProblem 2: The model creates an unsolvable regress problem for justification. For a belief to be \"Knowledge\", it needs justification, which comes from other beliefs. If these justifying beliefs must also be \"Knowledge\", it creates an impossible infinite regress. If they can be mere \"Beliefs\", then knowledge is being grounded by propositions that are not themselves known and could be false or unjustified, which undermines the entire point of the justification condition.>>>"
