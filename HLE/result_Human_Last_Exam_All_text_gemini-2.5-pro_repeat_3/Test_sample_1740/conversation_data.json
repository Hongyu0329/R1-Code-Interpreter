    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans to date. This requires consulting up-to-date biological databases.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Family Member\"**\nThe term \"member\" in the context of a gene family like let-7 can be interpreted in two main ways:\n1.  **Distinct Mature Sequences:** This refers to the unique, functional mature miRNA molecules. For example, let-7a and let-7b have slightly different sequences and are considered distinct members.\n2.  **Distinct Gene Loci (Paralogs):** This refers to the number of different genes in the human genome that code for let-7 family miRNAs. Sometimes, a single type of mature miRNA (like let-7a) can be produced from multiple different genes located at different positions in the genome.\n\nCounting the gene loci is the most precise and comprehensive method for determining the size of a gene family, as it reflects the genomic complexity and redundancy. We will proceed with this definition.\n\n**Step 3: Consult a Definitive Source**\nThe most authoritative and widely used database for miRNA sequences and annotation is **miRBase**. We will use the information from miRBase (the current version as of this analysis) to identify all human let-7 genes.\n\n**Step 4: List and Count the Human let-7 Gene Loci**\nThe core let-7 family is characterized by a conserved seed sequence (GAGGTAG). The following is a list of all distinct human gene loci that produce let-7 family miRNAs, as cataloged in miRBase:\n\n*   **let-7a:** This mature miRNA is encoded by **3** distinct genes:\n    1.  `hsa-let-7a-1`\n    2.  `hsa-let-7a-2`\n    3.  `hsa-let-7a-3`\n\n*   **let-7b:** Encoded by **1** gene:\n    4.  `hsa-let-7b`\n\n*   **let-7c:** Encoded by **1** gene:\n    5.  `hsa-let-7c`\n\n*   **let-7d:** Encoded by **1** gene:\n    6.  `hsa-let-7d`\n\n*   **let-7e:** Encoded by **2** distinct genes (the mature miRNA produced by `hsa-mir-4500` is identical to `hsa-let-7e`):\n    7.  `hsa-let-7e`\n    8.  `hsa-mir-4500`\n\n*   **let-7f:** Encoded by **2** distinct genes:\n    9.  `hsa-let-7f-1`\n    10. `hsa-let-7f-2`\n\n*   **let-7g:** Encoded by **1** gene:\n    11. `hsa-let-7g`\n\n*   **let-7i:** Encoded by **1** gene:\n    12. `hsa-let-7i`\n\n*   **miR-98:** This miRNA is considered a member of the let-7 family due to its shared seed sequence and function. It is encoded by **1** gene:\n    13. `hsa-mir-98`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Member\":** As noted, the term can be ambiguous. Specifying that the count refers to gene loci is crucial for accuracy. If the question were about distinct mature sequences, the answer would be 9 (let-7a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i, and miR-98).\n*   **Database Version:** The number of identified genes can change as genome annotation improves. The answer is based on the current data in major databases like miRBase.\n*   **Inclusion of miR-98:** miR-98 is consistently grouped with the let-7 family in scientific literature and databases due to high sequence homology, particularly in the seed region.\n*   **Exclusion of others:** Some sources might loosely include other miRNAs like miR-202 in the let-7 super-family or cluster, but miR-202 has a different seed sequence and is not considered a canonical member of the core let-7 family.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSumming the distinct gene loci from Step 4:\n3 (for let-7a) + 1 (for let-7b) + 1 (for let-7c) + 1 (for let-7d) + 2 (for let-7e) + 2 (for let-7f) + 1 (for let-7g) + 1 (for let-7i) + 1 (for miR-98) = **13**\n\nTo date, 13 distinct gene loci that encode for members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans.\n\n<<<13>>>"
