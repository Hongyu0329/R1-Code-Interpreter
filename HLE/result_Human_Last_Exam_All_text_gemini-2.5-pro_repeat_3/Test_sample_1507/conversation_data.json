    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Great Icosahedron**\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges. A key characteristic is that its faces pass through the interior of the figure, intersecting each other.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the \"Outer-Hull\"**\nThe \"outer-hull\" or \"convex hull\" of a geometric object is the smallest convex set that contains it. For a polyhedron, this can be visualized as stretching a rubber sheet over its vertices. The vertices of the great icosahedron are located at the same positions as the vertices of a regular convex icosahedron. Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a **regular icosahedron**.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Task: \"Triangulating the Outer-Hull\"**\nThe question asks for the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the surface of this outer-hull. \"Triangulation\" means dividing a surface into a set of non-overlapping triangles. The phrase \"number of visible triangles from the outside\" reinforces that we are concerned only with the surface of the convex hull, not the internal, intersecting faces of the great icosahedron itself.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Surface of the Outer-Hull (the Regular Icosahedron)**\nThe outer-hull is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid, and by definition, its surface is composed entirely of identical, non-overlapping triangles. Specifically, a regular icosahedron has **20** equilateral triangular faces.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Minimal Number of Triangles**\nSince the surface of the regular icosahedron is already perfectly divided into triangles (its faces), no further subdivision is needed. The existing faces form the most efficient and minimal triangulation possible. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the surface is simply the number of faces the regular icosahedron has.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nA regular icosahedron has 20 faces. Each face is a triangle. Thus, the minimal number of triangles needed to form its surface is 20.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Object vs. Hull:** It is crucial not to confuse the great icosahedron (with its 20 self-intersecting faces) with its convex hull (the regular icosahedron). The question is about the hull.\n2.  **Definition of Triangulation:** The problem asks for a minimal triangulation. Since the surface is already composed of triangles, the minimal number is simply its face count.\n3.  **Properties of the Icosahedron:** Knowing the basic properties of a regular icosahedron (a Platonic solid with 20 triangular faces) is essential to solving the problem directly. This can also be confirmed using Euler's formula for polyhedra (V - E + F = 2). For an icosahedron, V=12 (vertices) and E=30 (edges), so 12 - 30 + F = 2, which gives F = 20.\n\nThe final answer is the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n\n<<<20>>>"
