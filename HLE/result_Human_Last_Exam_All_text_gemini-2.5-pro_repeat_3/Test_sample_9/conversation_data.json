    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the space X\n\n1.  **Lattices and Bases:** A nondegenerate lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be generated by a basis of two linearly independent vectors $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$. We can represent this basis by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M = [v_1 | v_2]$, which must be in $GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\n2.  **Area of a Lattice:** The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The problem states that the lattices have unit area, so we are considering matrices $M$ such that $|\\det(M)| = 1$.\n\n3.  **Moduli Space:** Two bases $M_1$ and $M_2$ generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by an integer change of basis, i.e., $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. The group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ consists of $2 \\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$.\n\n4.  **Formal Definition of X:** The moduli space $X$ is the quotient space of all basis matrices of unit-area lattices by the equivalence relation of generating the same lattice.\n    $X = \\{ M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R}) : |\\det(M)| = 1 \\} / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, where the action is right multiplication.\n\n### Step 2: Relate X to a quotient of the upper half-plane\n\nA more convenient representation for the space of lattices is through positive-definite quadratic forms.\n\n1.  **From Lattices to Quadratic Forms:** A lattice $L$ with basis $M = [v_1|v_2]$ can be associated with a positive-definite quadratic form $q(x,y) = \\|xv_1 + yv_2\\|^2$. This form can be represented by a symmetric matrix $S = M^T M$. The matrix $S$ is symmetric and positive-definite.\n\n2.  **Unit Area Condition:** The determinant of $S$ is $\\det(S) = \\det(M^T M) = (\\det M)^2 = (\\text{Area}(L))^2$. The condition of unit area for $L$ means $\\det(S) = 1$. Let $\\mathcal{P}_2^1$ be the space of $2 \\times 2$ symmetric positive-definite matrices with determinant 1.\n\n3.  **Equivalence Relation:** If two bases $M_1$ and $M_2$ generate the same lattice, $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. The corresponding matrices of quadratic forms are $S_1 = M_1^T M_1$ and $S_2 = (M_1 A)^T (M_1 A) = A^T M_1^T M_1 A = A^T S_1 A$.\n    So, $X$ is the quotient space $X = \\mathcal{P}_2^1 / \\sim$, where $S_1 \\sim S_2$ if $S_2 = A^T S_1 A$ for some $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n4.  **Identification with the Upper Half-Plane:** The space $\\mathcal{P}_2^1$ is homeomorphic to the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H} = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : \\text{Im}(z) > 0 \\}$. A matrix $S = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ b & c \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathcal{P}_2^1$ can be mapped to $z = \\frac{b+i}{c} \\in \\mathbb{H}$. (This is one of several possible conventions, another is $z=b/a + i/a$).\n    The action on $\\mathcal{P}_2^1$ translates to an action on $\\mathbb{H}$.\n    *   For $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, the action $S \\mapsto A^T S A$ corresponds to the fractional linear transformation $z \\mapsto \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$ on $\\mathbb{H}$. The group acting is $PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) = SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})/\\{\\pm I\\}$.\n    *   For $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ with $\\det(A)=-1$, we can take a representative like $A_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The action $S \\mapsto A_0^T S A_0$ corresponds to the map $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$ on $\\mathbb{H}$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion of Step 2:** The space $X$ is the orbifold quotient $X = \\mathbb{H} / \\Gamma_{ext}$, where $\\Gamma_{ext}$ is the group of transformations on $\\mathbb{H}$ generated by $PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ and the map $\\rho(z) = -\\bar{z}$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the first homology group\n\n1.  **Homology and Fundamental Group:** For an orbifold like $X$, the first homology group with integer coefficients is the abelianization of its orbifold fundamental group: $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1^{\\text{orb}}(X)^{\\text{ab}}$.\n    The orbifold fundamental group is the group of transformations, $\\pi_1^{\\text{orb}}(X) = \\Gamma_{ext}$.\n\n2.  **Presentation of the Group:** We need a presentation for $\\Gamma_{ext}$.\n    *   $PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ has the presentation $\\langle S, T \\mid S^2=I, (ST)^3=I \\rangle$, where $S(z)=-1/z$ and $T(z)=z+1$.\n    *   The map $\\rho(z)=-\\bar{z}$ satisfies $\\rho^2=I$.\n    *   We need the relations between $\\rho$ and the generators of $PSL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n        *   $\\rho S \\rho^{-1}(z) = \\rho S(-\\bar{z}) = \\rho(1/\\bar{z}) = -\\overline{(1/\\bar{z})} = -1/z = S(z)$. So $\\rho S = S \\rho$.\n        *   $\\rho T \\rho^{-1}(z) = \\rho T(-\\bar{z}) = \\rho(-\\bar{z}+1) = - \\overline{(-\\bar{z}+1)} = -(-z+1) = z-1 = T^{-1}(z)$. So $\\rho T \\rho^{-1} = T^{-1}$.\n    *   A presentation for $\\Gamma_{ext}$ is $\\langle S, T, \\rho \\mid S^2=I, (ST)^3=I, \\rho^2=I, S\\rho=\\rho S, \\rho T \\rho T=I \\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Abelianization:** We compute the abelianization of $\\Gamma_{ext}$, denoted $\\Gamma_{ext}^{\\text{ab}}$. Let $s, t, r$ be the images of $S, T, \\rho$ in the abelian group. The relations become:\n    *   From $S^2=I \\implies 2s=0$.\n    *   From $(ST)^3=I \\implies 3(s+t)=0$.\n    *   From $\\rho^2=I \\implies 2r=0$.\n    *   From $S\\rho=\\rho S \\implies sr=rs$, which is always true in an abelian group.\n    *   From $\\rho T \\rho T = I \\implies rtr t = 1 \\implies t^2 = 1$ (since $r^2=1$ and the group is abelian). This implies $2t=0$.\n\n4.  **Simplifying the Relations:** We have the following system of relations for the abelian group generated by $s, t, r$:\n    1.  $2s=0$\n    2.  $3s+3t=0$\n    3.  $2r=0$\n    4.  $2t=0$\n\n    Using $2t=0$ in relation (2), it simplifies: $3s + t = 0$.\n    Using $2s=0$ in this new relation, it simplifies further: $s + t = 0$.\n    So, the full set of relations is equivalent to:\n    *   $s+t=0 \\implies s=-t$.\n    *   $2s=0$.\n    *   $2t=0$.\n    *   $2r=0$.\n\n    The relation $s=-t$ combined with $2t=0$ implies $s=t$. So the relation $2s=0$ is redundant if we have $2t=0$. The generators of the group can be chosen as $t$ and $r$. The relations are $2t=0$ and $2r=0$.\n    The resulting abelian group is $\\langle t \\rangle \\oplus \\langle r \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\Gamma_{ext}$. The calculation shows that this group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$."
