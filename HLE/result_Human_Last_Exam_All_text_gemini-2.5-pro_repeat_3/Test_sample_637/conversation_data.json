    "**1. Understanding the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to design a full-state observer for the given discrete-time system:\n*   `x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n*   `y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nThe observer should be a \"deadbeat\" observer, which means the state observation error, `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)`, must converge to zero in the shortest possible number of time steps.\n\n**2. Observer Dynamics**\n\nThe standard Luenberger observer is defined by:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - y_hat(k))`\nwhere `L` is the observer gain matrix to be designed, and `y_hat(k) = Cx_hat(k)`.\n\nThe error dynamics are governed by the equation:\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nFor the error to become zero after `v` steps, regardless of the initial error `e(0)`, the condition is:\n`(A - LC)^v = 0`\nThe \"shortest possible number of steps\" corresponds to the smallest integer `v` for which this is achievable. This integer `v` is the observability index of the system pair `(A, C)`.\n\n**3. Determining the Shortest Time (Observability Index)**\n\nThe observability index `v` is the smallest integer such that the observability matrix `O_v` has full rank, where `n` is the state dimension (`n=4`).\n`O_v = [C^T, (CA)^T, (CA^2)^T, ..., (CA^(v-1))^T]^T`\n\nFirst, let's compute the required matrices:\n`A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]`\n`C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n\n`CA = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] * A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe observability matrix for `v=2` is `O_2 = [C; CA]`:\n`O_2 = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`\nThe rank of this 4x4 matrix is 3 (as the third row is `row_2 - 2*row_1`). Since `rank(O_2) < 4`, the observability index `v` must be greater than 2.\n\nLet's compute `CA^2`:\n`A^2 = A*A = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [-3, 0, 2, -1], [1, -1, -1, 3], [2, -1, -1, -1]]`\n`CA^2 = C*A^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [2, -1, 0, -3]]`\n\nThe observability matrix for `v=3` is `O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2]`:\n`O_3` is a 6x4 matrix. We can find 4 linearly independent rows (e.g., row 1, 2, 4, 6), which confirms that `rank(O_3) = 4`.\nTherefore, the observability index is `v = 3`. The shortest possible time for the error to converge to zero is 3 steps.\n\n**4. Designing the Gain Matrix L**\n\nWe need to find a 4x2 matrix `L` such that `(A - LC)^3 = 0`.\nLet `M = A - LC`. Our goal is to choose `L` to give `M` a structure that makes it nilpotent with index 3.\n\n`LC = L * [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] = [[l_11, l_12], [l_21, l_22], [l_31, l_32], [l_41, l_42]] * [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n`LC = [[l_11+l_12, 0, 0, l_12], [l_21+l_22, 0, 0, l_22], [l_31+l_32, 0, 0, l_32], [l_41+l_42, 0, 0, l_42]]`\n\n`M = A - LC` will have its 2nd and 3rd columns equal to the 2nd and 3rd columns of `A`, because the 2nd and 3rd columns of `LC` are zero.\n`M_col2 = A_col2 = [0, 0, 1, 0]^T`\n`M_col3 = A_col3 = [0, 0, 0, 1]^T`\n\nLet's see if we can simplify `M` by choosing `L` appropriately. We can try to make the 1st and 4th columns of `M` zero.\n*   **Set column 4 of M to zero:**\n    `M_col4 = A_col4 - (LC)_col4 = 0`\n    `[1, 2, -1, -1]^T - [l_12, l_22, l_32, l_42]^T = 0`\n    This directly gives the second column of `L`:\n    `l_12 = 1`, `l_22 = 2`, `l_32 = -1`, `l_42 = -1`.\n\n*   **Set column 1 of M to zero:**\n    `M_col1 = A_col1 - (LC)_col1 = 0`\n    `[-1, 1, 0, -1]^T - [l_11+l_12, l_21+l_22, l_31+l_32, l_41+l_42]^T = 0`\n    Substituting the values for the second column of `L`:\n    `l_11 + 1 = -1  =>  l_11 = -2`\n    `l_21 + 2 = 1   =>  l_21 = -1`\n    `l_31 - 1 = 0   =>  l_31 = 1`\n    `l_41 - 1 = -1  =>  l_41 = 0`\n\nThis gives the first column of `L`.\n\n**5. Final Gain Matrix and Verification**\n\nCombining the columns, the observer gain matrix is:\n`L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]`\n\nLet's verify that with this `L`, the condition `(A-LC)^3 = 0` is met.\nThe resulting matrix `M = A - LC` is:\n`M = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]`\n\nNow, we compute the powers of `M`:\n`M^2 = M * M = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]] * [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]`\n`M^2 = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]]`\n\n`M^3 = M * M^2 = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]] * [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]]`\n`M^3 = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n\nSince `M^2` is not the zero matrix but `M^3` is, the error indeed becomes identically zero in exactly 3 steps, which is the shortest time possible.\n\nThe designed observer gain matrix `L` is:\n`[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]`\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
