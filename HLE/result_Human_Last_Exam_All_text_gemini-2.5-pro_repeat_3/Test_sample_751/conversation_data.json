    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form of the given discrete-time system using duality.\n\n### Step 1: Define the System and its Dual\n\nThe given discrete-time system is:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith matrices:\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe principle of duality connects the observability of a system (A, C) to the controllability of its dual system (A^T, C^T). Transforming (A, C) to observer canonical form is dual to transforming (A^T, C^T) to controller canonical form.\n\nLet's define the dual system:\n`z(k+1) = A_d * z(k) + B_d * u(k)`\n\nwhere:\n`A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Controllability of the Dual System\n\nTo transform the dual system to controller canonical form, we must first check its controllability. The controllability matrix `W_c` is constructed from the columns of `B_d` and their successive products with `A_d`.\nLet the columns of `B_d` be `b1` and `b2`:\n`b1 = [0, 1, 0]^T`\n`b2 = [1, 1, 0]^T`\n\nNow, we compute `A_d*b1`:\n`A_d*b1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T`\n\nWe need to find `n=3` linearly independent vectors from the set `{b1, b2, A_d*b1, A_d*b2, ...}`. Let's check the set `{b1, b2, A_d*b1}`:\nMatrix `M = [b1, b2, A_d*b1] = [[0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]]`\nThe determinant of `M` is `det(M) = 0 - 1*(1*1 - 1*0) + 2*(1*0 - 1*0) = -1`.\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the vectors are linearly independent, and the rank of the controllability matrix is 3. The dual system (A_d, B_d) is controllable.\n\nFrom the selection process, we have one vector from the chain of `b2` and two vectors from the chain of `b1`. This gives us the controllability indices `mu_1 = 2` and `mu_2 = 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Transformation Matrix for Controller Canonical Form\n\nA standard method to find the controller canonical form is to use a similarity transformation `z_bar = T_c * z`. The transformation matrix `T_c` is the inverse of a matrix `S` constructed from the linearly independent vectors we found. The ordering of these vectors in `S` determines the specific structure of the canonical form. A common choice is to group vectors from the same chain together.\n\nLet `S = [b1, A_d*b1, b2] = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\nThe transformation matrix `T_c` is the inverse of `S`.\n`T_c = S^(-1)`\n\nWe calculate the inverse of `S`:\n`S^(-1) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`\nSo, `T_c = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`\n\n### Step 4: Determine the New C Matrix using Duality\n\nThe transformed system is `(A_c, B_c)`, where `A_c = T_c * A_d * T_c^(-1)` and `B_c = T_c * B_d`.\nThe original system `(A, C)` is transformed to the observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)`.\nThe duality theorem states:\n`A_o = A_c^T`\n`C_o = B_c^T`\n\nThe question asks for the value of the new matrix C, which is `C_o`. Therefore, we need to calculate `B_c` and then take its transpose.\n\n`B_c = T_c * B_d`\n`B_c = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\nLet's compute the product:\nRow 1: `[-1*0 + 1*1 + 1*0, -1*1 + 1*1 + 1*0] = [1, 0]`\nRow 2: `[0*0 + 0*1 + 1*0, 0*1 + 0*1 + 1*0] = [0, 0]`\nRow 3: `[1*0 + 0*1 - 2*0, 1*1 + 0*1 - 2*0] = [0, 1]`\n\nSo, the matrix `B_c` is:\n`B_c = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\nFinally, the new matrix `C` for the observer canonical form, `C_o`, is the transpose of `B_c`.\n`C_o = B_c^T = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
