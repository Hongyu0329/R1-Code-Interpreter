    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about a specific television commercial for the company Enron.\n2.  **Identify Key Details:**\n    *   **Company:** Enron\n    *   **Year:** 2000\n    *   **Tagline:** \"Ask Why\"\n    *   **Participants:** Two Nobel laureates.\n3.  **Research the \"Ask Why\" Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major corporate branding effort by Enron in 2000. Its goal was to portray Enron as an innovative, forward-thinking company that was changing markets, not just an energy trading firm. To lend credibility to this image, they featured several prominent intellectuals and thinkers in the commercials.\n4.  **Identify Participants in the Campaign:** Research into the campaign's participants shows that several well-known figures were involved. We need to find the two who were also Nobel Prize winners. The two economists most frequently cited as being in these ads are Paul Krugman and Merton Miller.\n5.  **Verify Nobel Laureate Status of the Participants:**\n    *   **Merton Miller:** He was an American economist who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990, along with Harry Markowitz and William F. Sharpe, for their work in the theory of financial economics.\n    *   **Paul Krugman:** He is an American economist, professor, and columnist who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Timing of the Nobel Prize:** It is crucial to note the timing of when each person won their Nobel Prize relative to when the commercial aired in 2000.\n    *   **Merton Miller** was already a Nobel laureate for a decade when he appeared in the ad. Tragically, he passed away in June 2000, the same year the campaign launched.\n    *   **Paul Krugman** was a prominent economist in 2000 but had not yet won the Nobel Prize. He won it eight years later, in 2008.\n*   **Wording of the Question:** The question asks \"Which two Nobel laureates were featured...\". This phrasing is correct because both men are, as of today, Nobel laureates. The question does not specify that they had to be laureates *at the time of filming*. This is a common point of confusion. Krugman has since expressed regret for his participation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy confirming that both Merton Miller and Paul Krugman were featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial campaign and that both are recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, we can definitively answer the question.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
