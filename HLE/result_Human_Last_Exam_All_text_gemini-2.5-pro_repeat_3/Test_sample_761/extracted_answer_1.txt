No. Polynucleotides are structurally distinct from polysaccharides. They differ in their fundamental monomer units (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), the chemical bonds linking the monomers (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic bonds), and the composition of their polymer backbone (a sugar-phosphate backbone vs. a sugar-only backbone).
