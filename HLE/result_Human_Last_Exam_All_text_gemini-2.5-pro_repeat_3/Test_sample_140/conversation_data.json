    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that can fit inside a cube of edge length 15.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Initial Analysis\n\n*   We have a large cube with dimensions 15x15x15.\n*   We have small blocks (rectangular prisms) with dimensions 9x1x1.\n*   The goal is to fit the maximum possible number of these blocks inside the cube.\n\nA common first step for packing problems is to compare volumes to find a theoretical maximum.\n\n*   **Volume of the cube:** 15 x 15 x 15 = 3375 cubic units.\n*   **Volume of one block:** 9 x 1 x 1 = 9 cubic units.\n*   **Theoretical maximum number of blocks:** Volume of Cube / Volume of Block = 3375 / 9 = 375.\n\nThis value of 375 is an upper bound. It assumes that the blocks can be packed with no wasted space at all. However, we must consider the geometric constraints of packing a 9-unit length into a 15-unit length.\n\n### Step 2: Develop a Packing Strategy\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to figure out how to arrange the 9-unit length of the blocks within the 15-unit length of the cube. The most straightforward relationship between these numbers is the simple equation:\n\n`15 = 9 + 6`\n\nThis suggests that a good strategy is to divide the 15x15x15 cube into smaller regions based on this split. We can do this by imagining planes cutting through the cube at 9 units from each edge.\n\nLet's place the cube in a coordinate system, occupying the space from (0,0,0) to (15,15,15). We can make cuts along the planes `x=9`, `y=9`, and `z=9`. This divides the large cube into 8 smaller, non-overlapping rectangular prisms:\n\n1.  **1 cube** with dimensions `9 x 9 x 9`\n2.  **3 cuboids** with dimensions `9 x 9 x 6`\n3.  **3 cuboids** with dimensions `9 x 6 x 6`\n4.  **1 cube** with dimensions `6 x 6 x 6`\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Blocks in Each Region\n\nNow, we calculate how many 9x1x1 blocks can fit into each of these regions.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A 9x1x1 block can only be placed in a region if at least one of the region's dimensions is 9 or greater.\n\n1.  **In the 9x9x9 cube:**\n    We must align the 9-unit length of the blocks with one of the 9-unit dimensions of this cube. Let's align it with the x-axis.\n    *   Number of blocks along the x-axis = `floor(9/9) = 1`\n    *   Number of blocks along the y-axis = `floor(9/1) = 9`\n    *   Number of blocks along the z-axis = `floor(9/1) = 9`\n    This region can be perfectly filled.\n    Total blocks = 1 x 9 x 9 = **81 blocks**.\n\n2.  **In the three 9x9x6 cuboids:**\n    Again, we must align the 9-unit length of the blocks with one of the 9-unit dimensions.\n    *   Number of blocks = `floor(9/9) * floor(9/1) * floor(6/1) = 1 * 9 * 6 = 54`.\n    Since there are three such cuboids, this gives:\n    Total blocks = 3 x 54 = **162 blocks**.\n\n3.  **In the three 9x6x6 cuboids:**\n    We must align the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 9-unit dimension.\n    *   Number of blocks = `floor(9/9) * floor(6/1) * floor(6/1) = 1 * 6 * 6 = 36`.\n    Since there are three such cuboids, this gives:\n    Total blocks = 3 x 36 = **108 blocks**.\n\n4.  **In the 6x6x6 cube:**\n    The dimensions of the block are 9x1x1. The longest side of the block is 9.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since all dimensions of this region (6, 6, 6) are less than the block's longest dimension (9), no blocks can fit inside this space.\n    Total blocks = **0 blocks**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Blocks\n\nTo get the final answer, we sum the number of blocks from all the regions that can be filled.\n\nTotal Blocks = (Blocks in 9x9x9) + (Blocks in 3x 9x9x6) + (Blocks in 3x 9x6x6) + (Blocks in 6x6x6)\nTotal Blocks = 81 + 162 + 108 + 0\nTotal Blocks = 351\n\nThis packing strategy is optimal because it systematically fills all the volume where a 9-unit block can fit, isolating the \"unusable\" volume into a single `6x6x6` corner.\n\n<<<351>>>"
