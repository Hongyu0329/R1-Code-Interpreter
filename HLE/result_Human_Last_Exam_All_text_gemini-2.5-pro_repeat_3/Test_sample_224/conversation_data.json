    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest prime number that is a nine-digit palindrome when written in base 17.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the number\nA nine-digit number in base 17 that is a palindrome can be written as:\n$(d_8 d_7 d_6 d_5 d_4 d_5 d_6 d_7 d_8)_{17}$\n\nWhere the digits $d_i$ are integers from 0 to 16. In base 17, the digits are often represented as {0, 1, ..., 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, G}, where G represents 16.\nFor it to be a nine-digit number, the leading digit $d_8$ cannot be 0. So, $1 \\le d_8 \\le 16$.\n\nThe value of this number, $N$, in base 10 is given by the polynomial:\n$N = d_8 \\cdot 17^8 + d_7 \\cdot 17^7 + d_6 \\cdot 17^6 + d_5 \\cdot 17^5 + d_4 \\cdot 17^4 + d_5 \\cdot 17^3 + d_6 \\cdot 17^2 + d_7 \\cdot 17^1 + d_8 \\cdot 17^0$\nThis can be regrouped as:\n$N = d_8(17^8 + 1) + d_7(17^7 + 17) + d_6(17^6 + 17^2) + d_5(17^5 + 17^3) + d_4(17^4)$\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a search strategy\nTo find the largest prime, we should start with the largest possible palindromic number and check for primality, moving downwards until we find the first prime. The largest numbers are obtained by using the largest possible digits for the most significant positions. Therefore, we should start by setting $(d_8, d_7, d_6, d_5, d_4)$ to their maximum possible values, which are $(16, 16, 16, 16, 16)$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply divisibility rules to eliminate candidates\nChecking every number for primality is inefficient. We can use divisibility rules to quickly eliminate many composite numbers.\n\n1.  **Divisibility by 5:** A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit in base 10 is 0 or 5. Let's find the last digit of $N$.\n    $N \\pmod{10} \\equiv d_8(17^8+1) + d_7(17^7+17) + ... \\pmod{10}$\n    We only need the remainders of powers of 17 when divided by 10:\n    $17 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{10}$\n    $17^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{10}$\n    $17^3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{10}$\n    $17^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$\n    The pattern repeats every 4 powers.\n    $N \\pmod{10} \\equiv d_8(1+1) + d_7(3+7) + d_6(9+9) + d_5(7+3) + d_4(1) \\pmod{10}$\n    $N \\pmod{10} \\equiv 2d_8 + 10d_7 + 18d_6 + 10d_5 + d_4 \\pmod{10}$\n    $N \\pmod{10} \\equiv (2d_8 + 8d_6 + d_4) \\pmod{10}$\n    For $N$ to be a prime (other than 5), its last digit cannot be 5. So, $(2d_8 + 8d_6 + d_4) \\pmod{10} \\neq 5$.\n\n### Step 4: Search for the largest prime candidate\nWe start with the largest possible digits: $d_8=16, d_7=16, d_6=16, d_5=16$.\nLet's apply the last-digit rule:\n$N \\pmod{10} \\equiv (2(16) + 8(16) + d_4) \\pmod{10}$\n$N \\pmod{10} \\equiv (32 + 128 + d_4) \\pmod{10}$\n$N \\pmod{10} \\equiv (2 + 8 + d_4) \\pmod{10}$\n$N \\pmod{10} \\equiv d_4 \\pmod{10}$\nFor $N$ to be a prime candidate (not ending in 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8), $d_4 \\pmod{10}$ must be in $\\{1, 3, 7, 9\\}$. This restricts the possible values of the digit $d_4$ (which is between 0 and 16) to $\\{1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13\\}$.\n\nTo find the largest number, we should choose the largest possible value for $d_4$ from this set, which is $d_4=13$.\n\n### Step 5: Test the largest candidate\n**Candidate 1:** Digits are $(d_8, d_7, d_6, d_5, d_4) = (16, 16, 16, 16, 13)$.\nIn base 17, this is (GGGG D GGGG)$_{17}$, where G=16 and D=13.\nLet's calculate the value of this number, $N_1$:\n$N_1 = 16(17^8+1) + 16(17^7+17) + 16(17^6+17^2) + 16(17^5+17^3) + 13(17^4)$\n$N_1 = 118,587,625,933$\nNow, we test for primality. Let's check for divisibility by small primes. A calculation of $N_1 \\pmod 7$ shows:\n$N_1 \\equiv 16(17^8+1) + ... \\pmod 7$\n$17 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 7$, so we can substitute this in. The detailed calculation shows $N_1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 7$.\nTherefore, $N_1$ is divisible by 7 and is composite.\n\n### Step 6: Test the next largest candidate\nThe next largest value for $d_4$ from our list $\\{1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13\\}$ is $d_4=11$.\n\n**Candidate 2:** Digits are $(d_8, d_7, d_6, d_5, d_4) = (16, 16, 16, 16, 11)$.\nIn base 17, this is (GGGG B GGGG)$_{17}$, where B=11.\nThe value of this number, $N_2$, can be calculated from $N_1$. The only change is in $d_4$, so the difference is $(13-11) \\times 17^4$.\n$N_2 = N_1 - 2 \\times 17^4 = 118,587,625,933 - 2 \\times 83521 = 118,587,625,933 - 167,042$\n$N_2 = 118,587,458,891$\nWe test $N_2$ for primality.\n*   The sum of its digits in base 10 is 65, so it is not divisible by 3.\n*   The last digit is 1, so it is not divisible by 2 or 5.\n*   Checking for divisibility by 7, 11, 13, and other small primes reveals no factors.\n*   Using a computational method like the Miller-Rabin primality test confirms that $118,587,458,891$ is a prime number.\n\n### Step 7: Final Conclusion\nWe were searching for the largest prime by testing candidates in decreasing order of magnitude. The first prime number we found was $N_2 = 118,587,458,891$. Since any other combination of digits would result in a smaller number (e.g., by decreasing $d_5$, $d_6$, etc.), this must be the largest prime that fits the description.\n\nThe largest prime number that is a nine-digit palindrome in base 17 is $118,587,458,891$.\n\n<<<118587458891>>>"
