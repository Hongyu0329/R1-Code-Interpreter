    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Context:** Painted after his release/escape from the Gestapo (or more accurately, the SA, as he was arrested in March 1933 and held in Hohnstein Castle).\n*   **Question:** What object is he holding in his hand, and what is its symbolic meaning as a form of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork.**\nThe painting in question is titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\" (Self-Portrait with Pipe), created in 1933. As the title suggests, the object he is holding is a pipe. This was painted after he was arrested for his communist affiliations and imprisoned in Hohnstein Castle, a provisional concentration camp at the time.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the symbolism of the object within the historical context.**\n*   **Careful Point 1: The nature of resistance.** Resistance against a totalitarian regime like the Nazis was not always overt or violent. It could be subtle, personal, and intellectual.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The pipe as a personal object.** A pipe is a common, everyday object associated with contemplation, calm, and personal routine.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Connecting the object to the context.** For a man who had just been imprisoned for his political beliefs, depicting himself with a pipe was a powerful statement. The Nazi regime sought to break the will of its opponents and erase their individuality. By painting himself with this simple, personal item, Querner asserts his identity.\n*   **Symbolic Interpretation:** The pipe symbolizes his **unbroken will** and **intellectual freedom**. It is a quiet act of defiance, showing that despite his physical imprisonment, his spirit and mind remain his own. He is not depicted as a broken victim, but as a thoughtful, resolute individual who clings to his sense of self. The pipe represents this inner fortitude and calm resistance against the dehumanizing force of the regime.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the findings to form a final answer.**\nIn his 1933 self-portrait, painted after being released from imprisonment by the early Nazi regime, Curt Querner holds a **pipe**. The pipe serves as a symbol of his **unbroken spirit and quiet resistance**. It represents his refusal to be broken, his claim to individuality, and his continued intellectual freedom in the face of totalitarian oppression.\n\n<<<He holds a pipe. It symbolizes his unbroken will and inner, intellectual freedom, a quiet act of defiance asserting his individuality against the dehumanizing Nazi regime.>>>"
