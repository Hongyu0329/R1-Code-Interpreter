    "This is an excellent question that delves into the fascinating world of historical linguistics and counterfactual history. To determine the answer, we must trace the etymology of the current word and then map out its likely development without a key historical influence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Current Word \"Sister\"**\n\n*   The Modern English word \"sister\" does not descend directly and unchanged from its Old English ancestor.\n*   The original Old English word was **sweostor**.\n*   The word we use today, \"sister,\" is a hybrid. While its roots are in Old English, its modern form is heavily influenced by the Old Norse word **systir**.\n*   The key influences from Old Norse *systir* are:\n    1.  The vowel sound: The \"-i-\" in \"sister\" comes from the \"-y-\" in *systir*.\n    2.  The consonant sound: The hard /sk/ sound (as in \"sky\" or \"task\") in the middle of \"sister\" is also a Scandinavian borrowing. The native Old English pronunciation of \"sc\" would have palatalized into a \"sh\" sound.\n\n**Step 2: Remove the Norse Influence**\n\n*   The core of the question is to imagine a timeline where the Norse invasions (roughly 8th to 11th centuries) never happened.\n*   In this alternate timeline, there would be no Old Norse *systir* to influence the native Old English word.\n*   Therefore, we must start with the purely Anglo-Saxon word, **sweostor**, and trace its natural evolution into Modern English based on known sound changes.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the Evolution of \"Sweostor\"**\n\n*   **From Old English to Middle English:** The Old English *sweostor* would have undergone standard sound changes. The most significant change would be the simplification of the diphthong `eo`. In Middle English, this would have typically smoothed into a simple `e`.\n    *   *sweostor* â†’ *swester*\n*   **Historical Attestation:** This is not just a guess. The form **swester** is well-attested in Middle English texts. It existed for centuries, competing directly with the Norse-influenced *sister*. For example, the Wycliffe Bible (late 14th century) uses both \"sister\" and \"suster\" (a common variant of *swester*). Over time, the Norse form won out and became standard.\n\n*   **From Middle English to Modern English:** The next major event is the Great Vowel Shift (approx. 1400-1700), which primarily affected long vowels. The `e` in the Middle English word *swester* was a short vowel (as in \"bet\").\n    *   Short vowels were largely unaffected by the Great Vowel Shift.\n    *   Therefore, the pronunciation would have remained very similar.\n    *   The spelling would likely have standardized as **swester**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **It's a \"what if\" scenario:** This is a linguistic projection, not a historical certainty. However, it is based on the known, predictable patterns of language evolution.\n2.  **Competition of forms:** Languages often have competing words for the same thing (e.g., \"fall\" vs. \"autumn\"). In our real timeline, *sister* won out over *swester*. In the counterfactual timeline, *swester* would have had no competitor and would have become the sole standard.\n3.  **Pronunciation:** The hypothetical word \"swester\" would rhyme with words like \"jester\" or \"tester.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy removing the documented influence of Old Norse *systir* and tracing the natural, internal evolution of the original Old English word *sweostor*, we can confidently conclude what the word would have become. The `eo` would have become `e`, and this short vowel would have been stable through the Great Vowel Shift.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
