    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Stats:**\n    First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode. This is the health value with only one player present. According to the game's data, the Eye of Cthulhu has **3,640 HP** in single-player Expert Mode.\n\n2.  **Determine the Health Scaling Formula:**\n    Next, we must understand how boss health scales with additional players in Expert Mode. The source code specifies a clear formula for this:\n    *   For each player in the world beyond the first, the boss's health is increased by 35%.\n    *   This can be expressed with the formula: `Total Health = Base Health * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`, where `N` is the number of players.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to the Eye of Cthulhu:**\n    Substituting the Eye of Cthulhu's base Expert Mode health into the formula, we get:\n    `Total Health(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Formula with an Infinite Number of Players:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. Mathematically, this means we need to find the limit of the `Total Health(N)` function as `N` approaches infinity.\n    *   Let's simplify the formula:\n        `Total Health(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)`\n        `Total Health(N) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35N)`\n        `Total Health(N) = 2366 + 1274N`\n    *   This is a linear function. As the number of players (`N`) increases, the health increases without any mathematical upper bound. As `N` approaches infinity, the total health also approaches infinity.\n\n5.  **Consider Technical Limitations from the Source Code:**\n    The phrase \"according to the source code\" is critical. It implies we must consider the technical constraints of the game engine, not just the pure mathematical formula.\n    *   In Terraria's source code (written in C#), the health of an NPC is stored in a variable of type `int`.\n    *   A standard 32-bit signed integer (`int`) has a maximum possible value. Any value higher than this cannot be stored correctly.\n    *   The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2³¹ - 1.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Theoretical Maximum:**\n    While the mathematical scaling formula would result in infinite health, the game's code cannot store a number larger than the maximum value of an `int`. Therefore, the practical and theoretical maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu (or any NPC) can have is limited by this data type.\n\n    *   Maximum value of `int` = 2,147,483,647.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Mode and Boss Specifics:** It is essential to use the values for Expert Mode and the correct boss. Normal Mode and Master Mode have different base health and scaling factors.\n*   **Scaling Logic:** The scaling is applied for each player *after the first*, which is why the formula uses `(N - 1)`.\n*   **\"Theoretical Maximum\" Interpretation:** The key to this problem is interpreting \"theoretical maximum\" in the context of the source code. This points to a technical limitation (data type limit) rather than a mathematical one (which would be infinity).\n*   **Data Type:** The choice of the `int` data type in the game's programming is the ultimate limiting factor.\n\nBased on this analysis, the theoretical maximum health is the maximum value a 32-bit signed integer can hold.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
