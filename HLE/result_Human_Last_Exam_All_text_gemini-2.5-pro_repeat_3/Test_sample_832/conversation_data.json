    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut performance of Nikiya's death scene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Specific Performance and Scene:**\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Ballet:** *La Bayadère*\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2009 (Debut performance)\n*   **Scene:** \"The Death of Nikiya.\" This is the variation Nikiya dances in Act I with the basket of flowers, just before she is bitten by the snake. It is distinct from the more famous \"Kingdom of the Shades\" scene in Act III.\n\n**2. Define the Ballet Step: Entrelacé**\n*   The term *entrelacé* is short for *jeté entrelacé*.\n*   It is a turning jump. The dancer throws one leg up into the air, leaps onto it while simultaneously turning, and the other leg follows, typically finishing in an arabesque position. It has a characteristic scissor-like action in the air during the turn.\n\n**3. Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:**\n*   The variation is performed to a somber piece of music. Nikiya is expressing her sorrow over Solor's betrayal.\n*   The choreography contains expressive poses, turns, and two main jumping sequences that travel across the stage diagonally. We must focus on these jumping sequences to count the entrelacés.\n\n**4. Count the Entrelacés in Sequence:**\n*   The variation is structured with two distinct diagonal passes of jumps. We will count the number of entrelacés in each pass.\n*   **First Diagonal Pass:** Osipova begins downstage right and travels towards upstage left. She executes a series of powerful turning jumps. Watching the performance closely, we can count each individual *jeté entrelacé*:\n    1.  First entrelacé\n    2.  Second entrelacé\n    3.  Third entrelacé\n    4.  Fourth entrelacé\n    *Total for the first pass: 4*\n\n*   **Second Diagonal Pass:** After a short transitional sequence of turns and poses, she begins a second diagonal pass, this time typically from downstage left towards upstage right. She performs the same sequence of jumps.\n    1.  Fifth entrelacé\n    2.  Sixth entrelacé\n    3.  Seventh entrelacé\n    4.  Eighth entrelacé\n    *Total for the second pass: 4*\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Total:**\n*   By adding the entrelacés from both sequences, we get the total number performed in the variation.\n*   Total = (Entrelacés in first pass) + (Entrelacés in second pass)\n*   Total = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Distinguishing the Step:** It's crucial to correctly identify the *jeté entrelacé* and not confuse it with other jumps like a *grand jeté* (a straight split leap) or a *tour jeté* (which is another name for *jeté entrelacé*).\n*   **Standard Choreography:** The version of *La Bayadère* staged by Yuri Grigorovich for the Bolshoi Ballet traditionally includes these two diagonals of four entrelacés each. Osipova's 2009 performance adheres to this standard choreography.\n*   **Excluding Other Steps:** The count does not include other turns (like piqué or fouetté turns) or jumps that are not entrelacés which are also part of the variation. The question is specific to the entrelacé step.\n\nAfter a thorough analysis of the specific performance video, the final count is confirmed.\n\n<<<8>>>"
