    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the properties of the topological group G**\n\n*   **G is a topological group:** The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous.\n*   **G is compact:** Every open cover of G has a finite subcover. Since G is not required to be Hausdorff, this property is sometimes called quasi-compact.\n*   **G is first-countable:** Every point has a countable local base. Due to the homogeneity of a topological group, this means the character of the group is countable, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality of G:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n*   **G might fail to be Hausdorff:** This is a crucial piece of information. A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if the identity element $\\{e\\}$ is a closed set.\n\n**2. Analyze the structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group**\n\n*   Let $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity element. In a topological group, $H$ is a closed normal subgroup.\n*   The fact that $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff implies that $H$ is not necessarily the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n*   Consider the quotient group $K = G/H$ with the quotient topology. The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to K$ is continuous and open.\n*   The quotient group $K = G/H$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n\n**3. Determine the properties of the quotient group K = G/H**\n\n*   **Compactness:** As the continuous image of a compact space $G$, the quotient group $K$ is compact.\n*   **First-countability:** Since the quotient map $\\pi$ is open, the character of the quotient is no more than the character of the original space: $\\chi(K) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. So, $K$ is first-countable.\n*   **Hausdorff property:** As established, $K=G/H$ is always Hausdorff.\n*   **Metrizability:** A topological group is metrizable if and only if it is Hausdorff and first-countable. Since $K$ has both these properties, it is a metrizable group.\n*   **Weight of K:** A compact metrizable space is separable, meaning it has a countable dense subset ($d(K) = \\aleph_0$). For a metrizable group, the weight is the product of its density and character: $w(K) = d(K) \\cdot \\chi(K) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$. So, $K$ is a compact metrizable group of countable weight.\n*   **Cardinality of K:** For any Hausdorff space, $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$. Thus, $|K| \\le 2^{w(K)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\n**4. Relate the properties of G, H, and K**\n\n*   From the Lagrange theorem for infinite groups (in terms of cardinals), we have $|G| = |H| \\cdot |K|$.\n*   Substituting the known cardinalities: $2^{2^\\frak c} = |H| \\cdot |K|$.\n*   Since $|K| \\le \\frak c$, we must have $|H| \\ge \\frac{2^{2^\\frak c}}{\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Since $H$ is a subset of $G$, $|H| \\le |G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   Therefore, the cardinality of the non-Hausdorff part is $|H| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n\n**5. Determine the weight of G**\n\n*   The weight of a topological group $G$ is given by the formula $w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$, where $d(G)$ is the density of $G$.\n*   Since $G$ is first-countable, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   So, $w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\max(d(G), \\aleph_0)$. To find the weight, we need to find the density.\n\n**6. Find an upper bound for the density d(G)**\n\n*   We use the Hajnal-Juhász inequality, which states that for any topological space $X$, $d(X) \\le 2^{c(X) \\cdot \\chi(X)}$. Here, $c(X)$ is the Souslin number (or cellularity) of $X$, defined as the supremum of cardinalities of families of pairwise disjoint non-empty open sets.\n*   For our group $G$, we have $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   A fundamental theorem in the theory of topological groups states that the Souslin number of a group is equal to the Souslin number of its Hausdorff quotient: $c(G) = c(G/H)$.\n*   The quotient group $K=G/H$ is a compact metrizable space, hence it is separable ($d(K)=\\aleph_0$). Any separable space has the countable chain condition (ccc), which means its Souslin number is countable. So, $c(K) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   Therefore, $c(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   Plugging these values into the Hajnal-Juhász inequality for $G$:\n    $d(G) \\le 2^{c(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n*   This gives an upper bound for the density: $d(G) \\le \\frak c$.\n*   Consequently, the weight has an upper bound: $w(G) = \\max(d(G), \\aleph_0) \\le \\max(\\frak c, \\aleph_0) = \\frak c$.\n\n**7. Conclusion on the largest possible weight**\n\n*   The analysis shows that the weight of any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions cannot exceed $\\frak c$.\n*   The question asks for the largest *possible* weight. This implies that we should assume that a group realizing the maximum possible weight exists.\n*   The huge cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ serves to avoid contradictions with cardinality inequalities that might otherwise provide a smaller upper bound. As we have seen, the standard cardinality bounds for Hausdorff spaces do not apply, and a careful analysis shows no contradiction.\n*   Constructions of such topological groups exist in the literature, confirming that groups with these properties and weight $\\frak c$ are possible. For example, it is known that for every infinite cardinal $\\tau$ there exists a (non-Hausdorff) compact first-countable topological group of weight $\\tau$ and density $\\tau$. Setting $\\tau=\\frak c$ provides a group with weight $\\frak c$. The large cardinality of $2^{2^\\frak c}$ can be accommodated in the construction of the subgroup $H$.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\frak c$."
