    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nFirst, we must understand the precise requirements of the question:\n*   **What:** The *first statute*. This means we are looking for the earliest law chronologically.\n*   **Where:** In the *modern State of Israel*. This sets the starting point after the state's establishment in 1948. Laws passed by the Israeli Knesset, including \"New Versions\" of older British Mandate ordinances, qualify.\n*   **Action:** To *explicitly introduce the concept*. The statute must use the specific term \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*). It cannot merely imply the principle; the words must be present in the text.\n*   **Concept:** *\"good faith\"*. This is the legal principle requiring honesty, fairness, and the absence of a desire to defraud or seek an unconscionable advantage.\n*   **Formatting:** The final answer must not include the prefix \"the\" or the statute's year.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Potential Candidates\nThe principle of \"good faith\" is a cornerstone of Israeli private law. Several major statutes explicitly use this term. We must identify the most prominent ones and then determine which was enacted first.\n\n*   **Contracts (General Part) Law:** This law, enacted in 1973, is famously responsible for establishing \"good faith\" as a general, overarching principle in Israeli law, applying to both pre-contractual negotiations (Section 12) and the performance of contractual obligations (Section 39). Due to its profound impact, it is often mistakenly thought to be the first.\n*   **Land Law:** This law was enacted in 1969. Section 9 deals with conflicting transactions involving real estate and gives preference to a later buyer who acted in \"good faith\" (*be-tom lev*), paid consideration, and completed the registration.\n*   **Sale Law:** This law was enacted in 1968. Section 34, which establishes the \"market overt\" rule (*takanat hashuk*), protects a buyer of movable property if, among other conditions, the purchase was made in \"good faith\".\n*   **Agency Law:** Enacted in 1965, this law also uses the concept. For instance, Section 15 protects a third party who dealt with an agent without knowing the agency had been terminated, provided the third party acted in \"good faith\".\n*   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]:** This is a Knesset-enacted Hebrew consolidation of the pre-state British Mandate law. It was passed in 1957. Section 28 of this ordinance defines a \"holder in due course\" as someone who took a bill, among other things, \"in good faith\".\n\n### Step 3: Chronological Analysis\nNow, let's arrange these statutes by their year of enactment to find the earliest one:\n\n1.  **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] - 1957**\n2.  Agency Law - 1965\n3.  Sale Law - 1968\n4.  Land Law - 1969\n5.  Contracts (General Part) Law - 1973\n\n### Step 4: Drawing a Conclusion\nThe chronological list clearly shows that the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]** from 1957 is the earliest statute among the major candidates to explicitly use the term \"good faith\". While the Contracts Law of 1973 is famous for elevating \"good faith\" to a fundamental principle governing all contracts, the concept itself was introduced into the statutory law of the modern State of Israel in more specific contexts years earlier. The 1957 ordinance's use of \"good faith\" in defining a \"holder in due course\" is a clear and explicit introduction of the concept into the Israeli statute book.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **\"Introduction\" vs. \"Generalization\":** It is crucial to distinguish between the first *introduction* of a concept in a specific context and its later *generalization* into a broad, overarching principle. The question asks for the former.\n*   **\"Statute of the State of Israel\":** A \"[New Version]\" of a Mandate-era ordinance, when passed by the Knesset, becomes an official statute of the State of Israel. Therefore, the 1957 ordinance qualifies.\n*   **Explicit Language:** The analysis relies on finding the explicit Hebrew term \"תום לב\" in the statute's text, which is present in all the candidates listed.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the first statute is the Bills of Exchange Ordinance. Following the formatting instructions, the answer should be provided without \"the\" or the year.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance>>>"
