    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Problem and Define the Scope**\n\nThe goal is to find the number of syntactically correct boolean expressions that can be written with exactly 5 symbols from the set `{T, F, !, &, |, (, )}` and evaluate to True.\n\n*   **Symbols:** T (True literal), F (False literal), ! (NOT), & (AND), | (OR), ( (left parenthesis), ) (right parenthesis). Symbols can be repeated.\n*   **Expression Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Evaluation:** The expression must evaluate to True.\n*   **Precedence:** The order of operations is `!` (highest), then `&`, then `|` (lowest). Parentheses `()` can be used to override precedence.\n\nWe can solve this by categorizing all possible valid expressions of length 5 by the number of literals (T or F) they contain. An expression must contain at least one literal to have a boolean value. The maximum number of literals is 3 (e.g., `T&F|T`).\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis by Number of Literals**\n\nWe will analyze three cases based on the number of literals in the 5-symbol expression:\n1.  Case 1: 1 Literal\n2.  Case 2: 3 Literals\n3.  Case 3: 2 Literals\n\n(We analyze the 3-literal case before the 2-literal case as it is more constrained and simpler).\n\n### **Case 1: Expressions with 1 Literal**\n\nIf an expression has 1 literal, the other 4 symbols must be operators (`!`, `(`, `)`). We need to find all valid 5-symbol structures that wrap a single literal `L`. The expression must evaluate to True, which means the structure must preserve the truthiness of the literal, and the literal itself must be `T`.\n\nThe possible structures are:\n1.  `!!!!L`: e.g., `!!!!T`. This evaluates to `L`. For the expression to be true, `L` must be `T`. This gives 1 true expression: `!!!!T`.\n2.  `!!(L)`: e.g., `!!(T)`. This evaluates to `L`. For it to be true, `L` must be `T`. This gives 1 true expression: `!!(T)`.\n3.  `!(!L)`: e.g., `!(!T)`. This evaluates to `L`. For it to be true, `L` must be `T`. This gives 1 true expression: `!(!T)`.\n4.  `(!!L)`: e.g., `(!!T)`. This evaluates to `L`. For it to be true, `L` must be `T`. This gives 1 true expression: `(!!T)`.\n5.  `((L))`: e.g., `((T))`. This evaluates to `L`. For it to be true, `L` must be `T`. This gives 1 true expression: `((T))`.\n\n**Total for 1 Literal:** 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5** true expressions.\n\n### **Case 2: Expressions with 3 Literals**\n\nIf an expression has 3 literals (`L1`, `L2`, `L3`), the other 2 symbols must be binary operators (`B1`, `B2`). The only possible structure is `L1 B1 L2 B2 L3`. Parentheses cannot be used as that would increase the length beyond 5 (e.g., `(L1 B1 L2) B2 L3` has 7 symbols).\n\nThe parsing of the expression depends on the precedence of `B1` and `B2`.\n1.  **B1 = &, B2 = &**: The expression is `L1 & L2 & L3`, parsed as `(L1 & L2) & L3`. This is true only if all literals are `T`.\n    *   `T&T&T` (1 expression).\n2.  **B1 = |, B2 = |**: The expression is `L1 | L2 | L3`, parsed as `(L1 | L2) | L3`. This is true unless all literals are `F`. There are 2³ = 8 combinations of literals, so 8 - 1 = 7 are true.\n    *   (7 expressions).\n3.  **B1 = &, B2 = |**: The expression is `L1 & L2 | L3`, parsed as `(L1 & L2) | L3` due to precedence. This is true if `L3` is `T`, or if `L1` and `L2` are both `T`.\n    *   `L3=T`: 4 combinations for `L1, L2` (`T&T|T`, `T&F|T`, `F&T|T`, `F&F|T`).\n    *   `L3=F` and `L1=T, L2=T`: 1 combination (`T&T|F`).\n    *   Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n4.  **B1 = |, B2 = &**: The expression is `L1 | L2 & L3`, parsed as `L1 | (L2 & L3)`. This is true if `L1` is `T`, or if `L2` and `L3` are both `T`.\n    *   `L1=T`: 4 combinations for `L2, L3`.\n    *   `L1=F` and `L2=T, L3=T`: 1 combination (`F|T&T`).\n    *   Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n\n**Total for 3 Literals:** 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18** true expressions.\n\n### **Case 3: Expressions with 2 Literals**\n\nThis is the most complex case. A 5-symbol expression with 2 literals must have 3 operator symbols. We can classify the structures by their top-level operator. An expression `E` must have one of three forms: `X B Y` (binary), `!A` (negation), or `(A)` (parenthesized).\n\n**A. Form `X B Y`**\nHere, `X` and `Y` are expressions formed from the two literals `L1` and `L2`, and `B` is `&` or `|`. The total length is `len(X) + len(Y) + 1 = 5`, so `len(X) + len(Y) = 4`.\n*   For any valid `X` and `Y`, `X&Y` is true for 1 combination of truth values of `X` and `Y`, and `X|Y` is true for 3 combinations. So, each structure `X B Y` gives 1+3=4 true expressions.\n*   We must find all valid pairs of structures for `X` and `Y`.\n    *   **len(X)=1, len(Y)=3**: `X=L1`. `Y` can be `!!L2`, `(L2)`, or `!(L2)`. (3 structures)\n    *   **len(X)=2, len(Y)=2**: `X=!L1`, `Y=!L2`. (1 structure)\n    *   **len(X)=3, len(Y)=1**: Symmetric to the first case. `X` can be `!!L1`, `(L1)`, or `!(L1)`. (3 structures)\n*   This gives a total of 3 + 1 + 3 = 7 unique structures of the form `X B Y`.\n*   Total true expressions = 7 structures × 4 true expressions/structure = **28**.\n\n**B. Form `!A`**\nHere, `A` must be a valid expression of length 4. The expression `!A` is true if `A` is false.\n*   **`A = (L1 B L2)`**: `A` is length 5, so this is not possible. (Wait, `(LBL)` is length 5, `LBL` is length 3. So `A = LBL` is length 3. `!A` would be length 4. My mistake, let's correct).\n    *   `A` must be length 4. Possible structures for `A`:\n        1.  `A = (LBL)` is invalid (length 5). `A = (E)` where `E` has length 3. `A = (!L)` is valid.\n        2.  `A = L1 B !L2`: `!(L1 B !L2)`. True if `L1 B !L2` is false.\n            *   `L1 & !L2` is false for 3 literal pairs.\n            *   `L1 | !L2` is false for 1 literal pair. Total = 4 true expressions.\n        3.  `A = !L1 B L2`: `!(!L1 B L2)`. By symmetry, this gives another 4 true expressions.\n        4.  Let's consider `A= (L1 B L2)`. The length of this is 5. So `!(A)` is `!( (L1 B L2) )` which has length 7.\n        5.  `A` could be `(LBL)` where this has length 5. No, this isn't correct.\nLet's restart the `!A` case.\n`A` must be a valid expression of length 4. The possible structures for a 2-literal expression of length 4 are `L1 B !L2` and `!L1 B L2`.\n1.  `A = L1 B !L2`. Expression is `!(L1 B !L2)`. True if `A` is false.\n    *   If `B=&`, `L1&!L2` is false for 3 pairs of literals. (3 expressions)\n    *   If `B=|`, `L1|!L2` is false for 1 pair of literals. (1 expression)\n    *   Total for this structure: 3 + 1 = 4.\n2.  `A = !L1 B L2`. Expression is `!(!L1 B L2)`. By symmetry, this also gives 4 true expressions.\nThere is also `A=(LBL)`, where `LBL` is 3 symbols. `!(LBL)` has length 5.\n3.  `A = L1 B L2`. Expression is `!(L1 B L2)`. This has length 5. True if `A` is false.\n    *   If `B=&`, `L1&L2` is false for 3 pairs. (3 expressions)\n    *   If `B=|`, `L1|L2` is false for 1 pair. (1 expression)\n    *   Total for this structure: 3 + 1 = 4.\n*   Total true expressions = 4 + 4 + 4 = **12**.\n\n**C. Form `(A)`**\nHere, `A` must be a valid expression of length 3. The only 2-literal structure of length 3 is `L1 B L2`.\n1.  `A = L1 B L2`. Expression is `(L1 B L2)`. True if `A` is true.\n    *   If `B=&`, `L1&L2` is true for 1 pair. (1 expression)\n    *   If `B=|`, `L1|L2` is true for 3 pairs. (3 expressions)\n    *   Total for this structure: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n\n**Total for 2 Literals:** 28 (from `X B Y`) + 12 (from `!A`) + 4 (from `(A)`) = **44** true expressions.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nSum the counts from all cases:\n*   1 Literal: 5\n*   2 Literals: 44\n*   3 Literals: 18\n\nTotal True Expressions = 5 + 44 + 18 = 67.\n\n<<<67>>>"
