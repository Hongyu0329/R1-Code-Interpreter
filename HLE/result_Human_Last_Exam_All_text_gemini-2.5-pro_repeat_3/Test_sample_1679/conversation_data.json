    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question**\nThe goal is to find the *first* movie that won the \"Best Picture\" Oscar and contains a scene showing a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Luxor Obelisks**\nIt's crucial to know that there are two famous Luxor Obelisks, which were originally a pair at the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   **Obelisk 1:** Remains at its original location in front of the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   **Obelisk 2:** Was gifted to France in 1833 and now stands at the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\nTherefore, we need to search for films that show either Luxor, Egypt, or the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\n**Step 3: Create a chronological list of Best Picture winners and analyze their settings**\nWe must go through the winners in order, starting from the first awards ceremony, to find the earliest example.\n\n*   **1st Awards (1927/1928):** *Wings*. Set in France during WWI. While it features scenes in Paris, they are primarily focused on the Folies Berg√®re and interior party scenes. There is no clear shot of the Place de la Concorde.\n*   **2nd - 9th Awards (1928-1936):** Winners like *The Broadway Melody*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Cimarron*, *Grand Hotel*, *Cavalcade*, *It Happened One Night*, *Mutiny on the Bounty*, and *The Great Ziegfeld* are set in locations like New York, the German Front, the American West, Berlin, and London, none of which feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n*   **10th Awards (1937):** *The Life of Emile Zola*. This film is set in Paris. However, as a historical drama, its scenes are concentrated in interiors like courtrooms, offices, and apartments. It does not feature prominent establishing shots of Parisian landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n*   **11th - 15th Awards (1938-1942):** Winners like *You Can't Take It with You*, *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, *How Green Was My Valley*, and *Mrs. Miniver* are not set in Paris or Luxor.\n*   **16th Awards (1943):** ***Casablanca***. The film is primarily set in Morocco, but it contains an iconic and lengthy flashback sequence of the protagonists' romance in Paris before the German occupation.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must analyze this Paris flashback. During the romantic montage set to music, there is a clear shot of the characters Rick and Ilsa being driven in a car. In the background, they pass through the Place de la Concorde, and the Luxor Obelisk is distinctly visible.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm that no earlier winner fits and no later winner set in Egypt came first**\nHaving identified *Casablanca* (1943 winner) as featuring the Paris obelisk, we confirm that no prior winner had a confirmed sighting. We should also check if any film featuring the obelisk in Luxor, Egypt, won before or around the same time.\n\n*   Films set in ancient Egypt like *The Ten Commandments* (1956) or *Cleopatra* (1963) were nominated for Best Picture but did not win.\n*   *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956 winner) passes through Egypt via the Suez Canal, but the characters do not visit Luxor.\n*   *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962 winner) features scenes in Cairo but not at the Luxor Temple.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe search confirms that the first Best Picture winner to show a Luxor Obelisk is not one set in Egypt, but one set in Paris. By proceeding chronologically, we can confidently state that *Casablanca* is the first film to win Best Picture that depicts a Luxor Obelisk (the one in the Place de la Concorde).\n\n<<<Casablanca>>>"
