    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question's Clues**\n\nThe question provides two distinct but related clues attributed to Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  **The Quote:** The novel has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" This metaphor suggests a work that is simultaneously fierce and passionate (the tiger) while also being intellectually complex, strategic, and multifaceted (the chess duel).\n2.  **The Author's Description:** The author is described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\" This points to a writer whose style and thematic concerns are influenced by the American modernist William Faulkner, but who, in Borges's view, presents them in a more direct or less convoluted manner.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Author**\n\n*   The description of an author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is a famous critical assessment made by Borges.\n*   Borges applied this specific label to the Uruguayan novelist **Juan Carlos Onetti**.\n*   Onetti's work often features dense, pessimistic prose, existential themes, and the creation of a recurring fictional setting (the city of Santa Mar√≠a), which directly parallels Faulkner's creation of Yoknapatawpha County. This makes the \"continuator of Faulkner\" link very strong and well-documented in literary criticism.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Novel**\n\n*   Now that we have identified the author as Juan Carlos Onetti, we need to find which of his novels Borges described with the \"tiger\" and \"chess\" quote.\n*   Borges wrote a review of Onetti's 1950 novel, **_La vida breve_** (published in English as _A Brief Life_).\n*   This review was published in the influential literary magazine *Sur* in 1951 and was later collected in Borges's renowned book of essays, *Otras Inquisiciones* (Other Inquisitions).\n*   It is in this specific review of *La vida breve* that Borges uses the memorable phrase, praising the novel for its combination of raw, visceral power and intricate, deliberate structure.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBy connecting the two clues, we can confidently conclude:\n*   The author described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is Juan Carlos Onetti.\n*   The novel praised for having \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" is Onetti's *La vida breve*.\n\nTherefore, Jorge Luis Borges was referring to the novel **_La vida breve_** by **Juan Carlos Onetti**.\n\n<<<The novel is *La vida breve* (A Brief Life) by Juan Carlos Onetti.>>>"
