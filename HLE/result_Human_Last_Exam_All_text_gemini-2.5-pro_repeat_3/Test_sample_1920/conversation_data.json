    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of Dirichlet characters**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters based on the prime factorization of the modulus $d$.\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $d = 53599$.\n*   $53599$ is not divisible by 2, 3, 5.\n*   Trying prime 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Trying prime 13 for 7657: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Trying prime 19 for 589: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n*   Both 19 and 31 are prime numbers.\nSo, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\nLet $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$. Any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_i$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p_i$.\n\n**Step 2: Conditions on the component characters**\n\nWe are given two conditions on the character $\\chi$:\n1.  **The conductor of $\\chi$ is $d$**: A character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$ is primitive with conductor $d = p_1 \\cdots p_k$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive with conductor $p_i$. For a prime modulus $p_i$, a character $\\chi_i$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (the trivial character which maps all applicable integers to 1). The principal character is the unique character of order 1. Therefore, for each $i$, the order of $\\chi_i$, let's call it $o_i$, must be greater than 1 ($o_i > 1$).\n\n2.  **The order of $\\chi$ is 6**: The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components. So, we must have $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the possible orders for each component character**\n\nFrom the condition $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$, it follows that each order $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\nCombining with the primitivity condition ($o_i > 1$), the possible orders for each $\\chi_i$ are $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nWe need to check if characters of these orders exist for each prime modulus $p_i$. The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $\\phi(p)$.\n*   For $p_1=7$, $\\phi(7)=6$. The orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 6.\n*   For $p_2=13$, $\\phi(13)=12$. The orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 12.\n*   For $p_3=19$, $\\phi(19)=18$. The orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 18.\n*   For $p_4=31$, $\\phi(31)=30$. The orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 30.\nThus, for each prime factor $p_i$, it is possible to choose a character $\\chi_i$ with an order from the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of choices for each component character**\n\nFor each modulus $p_i$, we count the number of available characters for each possible order:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nSo, for each of the four components $\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4$, there are $1+2+2=5$ possible characters to choose from (one of order 2, two of order 3, and two of order 6).\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of tuples of characters satisfying the lcm condition**\n\nWe need to find the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that their orders $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$ satisfy $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$, where each $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nWe can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, or complementary counting.\nThe total number of ways to choose a tuple of characters where each character has an order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$ is met if and only if:\n(a) At least one order $o_i$ is divisible by 2 (i.e., is 2 or 6).\n(b) At least one order $o_j$ is divisible by 3 (i.e., is 3 or 6).\n\nWe count the number of tuples that *fail* this condition. A tuple fails if the lcm is not 6. Given the possible orders are from $\\{2,3,6\\}$, the lcm can only be 2, 3, or 6. So we count the cases where the lcm is 2 or 3.\n*   **Case 1: The lcm is 2.** This happens if and only if all orders $o_i$ are 2. For each component, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. So, there is $1^4 = 1$ such tuple of characters.\n*   **Case 2: The lcm is 3.** This happens if and only if all orders $o_i$ are 3. For each component, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. So, there are $2^4 = 16$ such tuples of characters.\n\nThe total number of \"bad\" tuples (where the lcm is not 6) is the sum of these cases, as they are disjoint: $1 + 16 = 17$.\n\nThe number of \"good\" tuples is the total number of possibilities minus the \"bad\" ones.\nNumber of desired characters = $625 - 17 = 608$."
