    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the varieties and their relationship**\nLet `C` be a compact Riemann surface of genus `g=3`. Let `X = Sym¹⁵(C)` be its 15th symmetric power. `X` is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension `n=15`.\nLet `J(C)` be the Jacobian of `C`, which is a principally polarized abelian variety (ppav) of dimension `g=3`.\n\nFor `n ≥ g`, the `n`-th symmetric power `Symⁿ(C)` is a projective bundle over the Jacobian `J(C)`. Specifically, the Abel-Jacobi map `u: Symⁿ(C) -> J(C)` given by `u({p₁, ..., pₙ}) = [∑ pᵢ - n p₀]` (for a fixed basepoint `p₀`) presents `Symⁿ(C)` as a `Pⁿ⁻ᵍ`-bundle over `J(C)`.\n\nIn our case, `n=15` and `g=3`, so `n ≥ g` holds. Therefore, `X = Sym¹⁵(C)` is a `P¹⁵⁻³ = P¹²`-bundle over `J(C)`. Let `π: X -> J(C)` be the bundle projection.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Néron-Severi group of X to that of J(C)**\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group, `ρ(V) = rank(NS(V))`, is also known as the Picard number of a variety `V`. It is the dimension of the vector space of algebraic 1-cycles (divisors) modulo algebraic equivalence, `NS(V) ⊗ ℚ`.\n\nFor a projective space bundle `π: X -> B` with fiber `P^k`, the Chow group of 1-cycles (which corresponds to the Néron-Severi group) is given by a formula of Grothendieck:\n`CH¹(X) ≅ CH¹(B) ⊕ CH⁰(B)`.\nThe second summand `CH⁰(B)` is generated by the class of the bundle `B` itself, which corresponds to the pullback of the hyperplane class from the fibers.\nApplying this to our situation (`X=Sym¹⁵(C)`, `B=J(C)`):\n`NS(X) ⊗ ℚ ≅ (NS(J(C)) ⊗ ℚ) ⊕ (NS(P¹²-fiber) ⊗ ℚ)`\nMore precisely, `NS(X) ⊗ ℚ ≅ π*(NS(J(C)) ⊗ ℚ) ⊕ ℚζ`, where `ζ` is the class of the relative hyperplane bundle `O_X(1)`.\nTaking the ranks of these free abelian groups (or dimensions of the ℚ-vector spaces), we get:\n`ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`.\n\nThis crucial relation reduces the problem of finding the range of `ρ(X)` to finding the range of `ρ(J(C))`.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the range of the Picard number for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve**\nWe need to find the smallest and largest possible values of `ρ(J(C))` where `C` is any curve of genus 3. `J(C)` is a 3-dimensional ppav.\n\nThe Picard number `ρ(A)` of an abelian variety `A` is bounded by its (1,1)-Hodge number: `ρ(A) ≤ h¹‚¹(A)`. For an abelian variety of dimension `g`, `h¹‚¹(A) = g²`. In our case, `g=3`, so `h¹‚¹(J(C)) = 3² = 9`. Thus, `ρ(J(C)) ≤ 9`.\n\n**Smallest possible rank for `ρ(J(C))`:**\nFor a \"very general\" curve `C` (which form a dense open subset in the moduli space of curves), the Jacobian `J(C)` is a simple abelian variety whose endomorphism ring is just `End(J(C)) = ℤ`. For such abelian varieties, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization `Θ`. Therefore, `ρ(J(C)) = 1`.\nThis is the minimum possible rank for any ppav.\nThus, the smallest possible rank for `ρ(J(C))` is 1.\n\n**Largest possible rank for `ρ(J(C))`:**\nThe rank `ρ(J(C))` is maximal when `J(C)` has the largest possible number of algebraic cycles. This occurs for curves with special properties, such as having complex multiplication (CM).\nBy a theorem of Pohlmann, for an abelian variety `A` with complex multiplication, all Hodge classes are algebraic. This implies that `ρ(A) = h¹‚¹(A)`.\nFor `J(C)`, this would mean `ρ(J(C)) = h¹‚¹(J(C)) = 9`.\nWe need to ensure that such a curve `C` of genus 3 exists. A well-known example is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation `x⁴ + y⁴ = z⁴` in `P²`. This is a smooth non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 3, and its Jacobian `J(C)` is a simple abelian variety with complex multiplication.\nThus, the maximum value `ρ(J(C)) = 9` is attainable.\n\nSo, the possible range for `ρ(J(C))` is `[1, 9]`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the smallest and largest ranks for `ρ(X)`**\nUsing the relation `ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`, we can now find the range for `ρ(X)`.\n\n*   **Smallest rank:** This occurs when `ρ(J(C))` is minimal.\n    `ρ_min(X) = ρ_min(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n*   **Largest rank:** This occurs when `ρ(J(C))` is maximal.\n    `ρ_max(X) = ρ_max(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\nThis largest value is consistent with the Hodge-theoretic bound `ρ(X) ≤ h¹‚¹(X)`. Let's compute `h¹‚¹(X)`.\nFrom the projective bundle structure, `h^{p,q}(X) = ∑_i h^{p-i,q-i}(J(C))`.\n`h¹‚¹(X) = h¹‚¹(J(C)) + h⁰‚⁰(J(C)) = 9 + 1 = 10`.\nSo, the maximum possible rank is indeed 10.\n\nFinal Answer: The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10."
