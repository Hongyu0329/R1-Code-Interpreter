    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the common name for the genus *Perdita* and when it was coined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The question asks for the common name of the bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*, which is native to North and Central America.\n\n2.  **Determine the current common name:**\n    *   The genus *Perdita* is one of the largest bee genera in North America, with over 600 described species. They are known for being exceptionally small.\n    *   Consulting modern, authoritative entomological sources is necessary to find the currently accepted common name.\n    *   Resources like \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" (Wilson & Carril, 2016) and \"The Bees of the World\" (Michener, 2007), as well as conservation organizations like the Xerces Society, consistently refer to the genus *Perdita* by the common name **Fairy Bees**.\n    *   This name is fitting due to their tiny size (many are less than 3 mm long) and their often bright, metallic, and jewel-like coloration.\n\n3.  **Determine when the name was coined:**\n    *   Unlike scientific names, common names do not have a formal code of nomenclature, so finding a precise \"coining\" date can be difficult. We look for the first significant, published proposal of the name by a recognized authority.\n    *   The eminent bee systematist Charles D. Michener, in his definitive work \"The Bees of the World\" (2nd ed., 2007), attributes the name to another key figure in bee research. He states, \"The common name fairy bees (coined by Timberlake) is appropriate because of their small size...\"\n    *   This points to Philip H. Timberlake (1883-1981), who was the world's leading expert on the genus *Perdita*, having described a majority of its species.\n    *   To find the specific publication, we must search Timberlake's extensive body of work. In the introduction to Part III of his monumental series, \"A Revisional Study of the Bees of the Genus Perdita F. Smith...\", published in *University of California Publications in Entomology* (Volume 14, No. 5), Timberlake wrote: \"...an enormous genus of little bees which, on account of their minute size and often brilliant metallic colors, may be aptly called the 'fairy bees'.\"\n    *   The publication date for this part of his study is **1958**. This is the earliest known formal proposal of the name in a major scientific work by the foremost authority on the genus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Common vs. Scientific Names:** It's crucial to distinguish between the formal scientific name (*Perdita*), which has a strict starting point (Smith, 1853), and the common name (\"Fairy Bees\"), which enters usage more informally.\n*   **Attribution:** The attribution of the name to Timberlake by Michener provides a strong lead for the investigation.\n*   **\"Coining\" a Name:** For a common name, \"coining\" is best interpreted as its first appearance in a significant, widely-read publication by an expert, which serves to popularize it. Timberlake's 1958 paper fits this description perfectly.\n*   **Native Range Context:** The name \"Fairy Bees\" is used primarily in North America, which is the native range of the genus *Perdita*, as requested by the user.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nCombining the findings:\n*   The currently used common name is **Fairy Bees**.\n*   The year it was formally coined in a major scientific publication is **1958**.\n\nThe answer, formatted as requested, is \"Fairy Bees, 1958\".\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 1958>>>"
