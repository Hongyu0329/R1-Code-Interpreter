    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for four key things:\n    *   **An explicit date:** Not just an age estimate of an artifact, but a specific day recorded on it.\n    *   **Recorded in writing:** The date must be inscribed using a native, pre-Columbian writing system.\n    *   **Aboriginal System:** The calendar and numeral system used must be indigenous to the Americas.\n    *   **Earliest Known:** It must be the oldest such recorded date discovered and verified by archaeologists to date.\n\n2.  **Identify the Correct Calendar System:** To record a specific, non-repeating date, a civilization needs a linear or \"absolute\" calendar, not just a cyclical one. In Mesoamerica, the system that fulfills this requirement is the **Long Count calendar**. This system counts the number of days elapsed since a mythical creation date (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE). This is different from the cyclical 260-day (Tzolk'in) and 365-day (Haab') calendars, which repeat frequently. Therefore, we must look for the earliest known artifact with a Long Count date inscribed on it.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Primary Candidates:** Several artifacts from Mesoamerica bear very early Long Count dates. The main contenders are:\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** Found in the former Olmec heartland and attributed to the subsequent Epi-Olmec culture. The monument has a Long Count date, but the first digit (the *b'ak'tun*, a 144,000-day cycle) was missing. Based on the style and other numbers, archaeologists inferred the missing digit was '7'. This gives a date of **7.16.6.16.18**, which correlates to **September 1, 32 BCE**.\n    *   **El Baúl Stela 1:** A monument from Guatemala with a clear Long Count date of **7.19.15.7.12**. This corresponds to **March 6, 37 CE**. This is significantly later than the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C.\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this monument fragment contains the lower portion of a date inscription. The inscription is clear and unambiguous. It reads **7.16.3.2.13**. This date is slightly earlier than the one on Tres Zapotes Stela C.\n\n4.  **Compare the Dates and Determine the Earliest:**\n    *   We need to convert the Long Count dates to our modern Gregorian calendar to compare them.\n    *   The date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is **7.16.3.2.13**. This translates to **December 7, 36 BCE**.\n    *   The date on Tres Zapotes Stela C is **7.16.6.16.18**. This translates to **September 1, 32 BCE**.\n    *   Comparing the two, December of 36 BCE is earlier than September of 32 BCE.\n\n5.  **Address Other Potential Candidates:**\n    *   **Zapotec Writing:** The Zapotec civilization at Monte Albán produced some of the earliest writing in Mesoamerica (c. 600 BCE). However, their monuments record dates using the 260-day cyclical calendar, not the absolute Long Count. So while the writing is older, it doesn't record a specific, non-repeating date that can be pinpointed in history as the \"earliest date.\"\n    *   **Olmec Writing:** The Cascajal Block (c. 900 BCE) is a candidate for the earliest writing in the Americas, but it contains no recognizable calendar dates.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system is found on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico**. The inscription is a Long Count date of **7.16.3.2.13**, which corresponds to **December 7, 36 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This artifact provides the oldest unambiguous, specific date recorded by any civilization of the ancient Americas.\n\n<<<December 7, 36 BCE>>>"
