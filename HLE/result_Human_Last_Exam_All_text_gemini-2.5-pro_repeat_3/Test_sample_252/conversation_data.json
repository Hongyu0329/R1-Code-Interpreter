    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\" using \"computed tomography\".\n    *   **Spectral Volume:** This is a 3D data set, often called a hyperspectral data cube, with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, 位). For each pixel (x, y) in a scene, we want to know its full spectrum of light.\n    *   **Single Image:** All the information required for the reconstruction must be captured in a single snapshot on a 2D detector (like a CCD or CMOS camera sensor). We cannot take multiple pictures with different settings.\n    *   **Computed Tomography (CT):** This is a mathematical technique used to reconstruct a 3D volume from a set of its 2D projections. Think of a medical CT scan that takes X-ray images from many angles around a patient to build a 3D model of their insides.\n    *   **Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS):** This specific technique applies the principles of CT to spectroscopy. The \"projections\" are not created by rotating a camera, but by using a dispersive element (the diffraction grating) to project the 3D spatio-spectral data cube `(x, y, 位)` onto the 2D detector from different \"angles\".\n\n2.  **How CTIS Works:**\n    *   A diffraction grating is placed in the optical path of a camera.\n    *   The grating splits the incoming light. It creates a central, undispersed image called the \"zeroth-order\" diffraction. This is essentially a standard black-and-white image.\n    *   It also creates multiple dispersed images, called the \"first-order\", \"second-order\", etc., diffractions. In these images, the light from each point in the scene is spread out into its spectrum (a rainbow line).\n    *   Each of these diffracted orders (the zeroth, first, etc.) can be thought of as a different 2D \"projection\" of the 3D `(x, y, 位)` data cube.\n    *   The single image captured by the detector is a complex, overlapping pattern containing all these different projections simultaneously.\n    *   A CT reconstruction algorithm then unscrambles this single, complex image to reconstruct the original 3D spectral volume.\n\n3.  **The Role of the Number of Gratings:**\n    *   The fundamental principle of computed tomography (related to the Fourier Slice Theorem) states that to reconstruct a 3D volume, you need projections from many different angles. If all your projections are taken from the same direction (or along the same line), you don't have enough information to perform the 3D reconstruction. This would be like trying to understand the shape of a coffee mug by only looking at it from the top; you wouldn't know its height or the shape of its handle.\n    *   **Case 1: One 1D Grating.** A standard grating has parallel lines and disperses light in only one direction (e.g., horizontally). This would create a zeroth-order image and a series of dispersed images along a single line on the detector. All these \"projections\" are essentially oriented along the same axis. This is not enough angular information to uniquely reconstruct the 3D `(x, y, 位)` cube. There would be significant ambiguity and artifacts in the reconstruction.\n    *   **Case 2: Two 1D Gratings.** To solve this, we need to disperse the light in more than one direction. The standard method is to use a 2D diffraction grating. A 2D grating acts like two 1D gratings placed on top of each other, typically with their lines oriented at 90 degrees to each other (like a grid or checkerboard). One grating disperses the light horizontally, and the other disperses it vertically.\n    *   This 2D dispersion creates a 2D array of diffracted orders on the detector (e.g., orders (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (-1,0), etc.). These orders represent projections of the spectral cube from a variety of different angles. This rich set of projections provides sufficient information for the CT algorithm to reconstruct the full 3D spectral volume.\n\n4.  **Careful Points & Conclusion:**\n    *   The question asks for the *minimum number* of gratings.\n    *   While a 2D grating is often a single physical component, it functions by having two distinct grating patterns (one for each dimension of dispersion).\n    *   The fundamental physical requirement is to have dispersion in at least two non-parallel directions to generate the necessary variety of projections for tomographic reconstruction.\n    *   One direction of dispersion (from one 1D grating) is insufficient.\n    *   Two directions of dispersion (achieved by two crossed 1D gratings, or a single 2D grating) are sufficient.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum number of gratings (or distinct grating patterns) required to implement the principle is two.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
