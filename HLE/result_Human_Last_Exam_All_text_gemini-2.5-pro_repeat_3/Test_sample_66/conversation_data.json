    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of the matrix**\n\nThe problem asks us to consider an image of the flag of Tonga and represent it as a matrix. Every red pixel is assigned a value of $a$, and every white pixel is assigned a value of $b$.\n\nThe flag of Tonga has the following structure:\n1.  The main field of the flag is red.\n2.  There is a white rectangle, called the canton, in the upper-left corner.\n3.  Inside the white canton, there is a red \"couped\" cross. A couped cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the container (the canton, in this case).\n\nLet's model this as an $M \\times N$ matrix, $A$. The canton is an $m \\times n$ submatrix in the top-left corner.\n\nThe matrix $A$ can be described by the colors of its regions:\n*   **Region 1 (Canton Background):** The parts of the canton that are not the cross are white (value $b$). These are pixels $(i,j)$ where $1 \\le i \\le m$, $1 \\le j \\le n$, and $(i,j)$ is not on the cross.\n*   **Region 2 (Canton Cross):** The cross within the canton is red (value $a$). The cross consists of a vertical bar and a horizontal bar. Let the horizontal bar occupy a set of rows $I_h$ and the vertical bar occupy a set of columns $I_v$. A pixel $(i,j)$ is on the cross if $i \\in I_h$ or $j \\in I_v$ (for $1 \\le i \\le m, 1 \\le j \\le n$).\n*   **Region 3 (Main Field):** All pixels outside the canton are red (value $a$).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the rows of the matrix**\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's analyze the structure of the rows of matrix $A$. We can classify the rows into three types based on their vertical position.\n\n*   **Type 1: Rows below the canton ($i > m$)**\n    These rows are entirely in the red field of the flag. Therefore, every entry in these rows is $a$. All these rows are identical vectors: $(a, a, \\dots, a)$.\n\n*   **Type 2: Rows that intersect the horizontal bar of the cross ($1 \\le i \\le m$ and $i \\in I_h$)**\n    For a row $i$ that is part of the horizontal bar of the cross, all pixels within the canton ($1 \\le j \\le n$) are red (value $a$). The pixels outside the canton ($j > n$) are also red. Thus, these rows are also identical vectors: $(a, a, \\dots, a)$.\n\n*   **Type 3: Rows in the canton that do not intersect the horizontal bar of the cross ($1 \\le i \\le m$ and $i \\notin I_h$)**\n    For a row $i$ of this type, let's examine its entries:\n    *   For columns $j$ corresponding to the vertical bar of the cross ($j \\in I_v$), the pixel is red, so the entry is $a$.\n    *   For columns $j$ within the canton but not on the vertical bar ($1 \\le j \\le n$ and $j \\notin I_v$), the pixel is white, so the entry is $b$.\n    *   For columns $j$ outside the canton ($j > n$), the pixel is red, so the entry is $a$.\n    Importantly, all rows of this third type are identical to each other.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the dimension of the row space**\n\nFrom the analysis above, we see that no matter how large the matrix $A$ is, its rows are constructed from only **two** distinct patterns:\n1.  **Vector $v_1$**: The \"all-red\" row, $(a, a, \\dots, a)$. This corresponds to Type 1 and Type 2 rows.\n2.  **Vector $v_2$**: The \"mixed\" row from the canton. This corresponds to Type 3 rows. The entries of this vector are $b$ for the white parts of the canton, and $a$ everywhere else.\n\nThe set of all rows of the matrix $A$ is $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$. The row space of $A$ is the vector space spanned by these two vectors. The rank of $A$ is the dimension of this space, which can be at most 2.\n\n**Step 4: Find the maximal possible rank**\n\nThe rank will be exactly 2 if the vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent. The rank will be 1 if they are linearly dependent (and not both zero), and 0 if both are the zero vector.\n\nThe vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly dependent if one is a scalar multiple of the other. Let's assume $v_2 = k \\cdot v_1$ for some scalar $k$.\n$v_1 = (a, a, \\dots, a)$. This is a constant vector.\nFor $v_2 = k \\cdot v_1$, $v_2$ must also be a constant vector. The entries of $v_2$ can be either $a$ or $b$. For $v_2$ to be a constant vector, we must have $a = b$.\nIf $a=b$, then $v_2$ becomes $(a, a, \\dots, a)$, which is identical to $v_1$. In this case, the vectors are linearly dependent, and the rank of the matrix is 1 (assuming $a=b \\neq 0$).\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose $a$ and $b$ such that $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent. This can be achieved by choosing $a \\neq b$.\nLet's check for linear independence when $a \\neq b$:\n*   $v_1$ is a constant vector (all entries are $a$).\n*   $v_2$ is not a constant vector, as it contains both $a$ and $b$ as entries. (This is guaranteed because the cross is \"couped\", meaning it doesn't cover the entire canton, so there are both red and white pixels in these rows).\nA non-constant vector cannot be a multiple of a non-zero constant vector. So, if $a \\neq 0$ and $a \\neq b$, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent.\nIn this case, the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ is 2.\n\nLet's consider the special case where $a=0$.\nIf $a=0$ and $b \\neq 0$:\n*   $v_1 = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$.\n*   $v_2$ has entries that are either $0$ or $b$. Since $b \\neq 0$, $v_2$ is not the zero vector.\nThe set of row vectors is $\\{ \\mathbf{0}, v_2 \\}$. The space spanned by them has dimension 1.\n\nSo, the possible ranks are:\n*   Rank 0 if $a=b=0$.\n*   Rank 1 if $a=b \\neq 0$.\n*   Rank 1 if $a=0$ and $b \\neq 0$.\n*   Rank 2 if $a \\neq 0$ and $a \\neq b$. (For example, we can choose $a=1, b=0$ or $a=2, b=1$).\n\nThe maximal value among these possibilities is 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe matrix representing the flag of Tonga has a highly structured pattern where all rows are one of only two distinct types. This limits the rank of the matrix. By choosing the values for red ($a$) and white ($b$) pixels appropriately (e.g., $a=1, b=2$), we can ensure the two distinct row types are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2. Any other choice of $a$ and $b$ results in a rank of 1 or 0. Therefore, the maximal possible rank is 2."
