**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected.**

The absorption cross-section $\sigma_a(\omega)$ is given by:
$$ \sigma_a(\omega) = K \cdot N \epsilon_0 |\vec{\mu} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}|^2 \exp\left[-\frac{T^2}{2}\left(\frac{\epsilon_0}{\hbar} - \omega\right)^2\right] $$
where:
*   $K = \frac{\pi\sqrt{2\pi}T}{c\epsilon_0\hbar^2}$ is a constant containing fundamental constants and pulse parameters.
*   $N$ is the number of molecules.
*   $\epsilon_0$ is the excitation energy of a single molecule.
*   $\vec{\mu}$ is the transition dipole moment of a single molecule.
*   $\hat{\epsilon}$ is the polarization vector of the laser electric field.
*   $T$ is the Gaussian pulse duration.
*   $\omega$ is the carrier frequency of the laser pulse.
*   $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.

This equation represents a Gaussian absorption profile centered at the single-molecule transition frequency $\epsilon_0/\hbar$, with an amplitude proportional to $N$.

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered.**

The absorption cross-section $\sigma_b(\omega)$ is given by:
$$ \sigma_b(\omega) = K \cdot N (\epsilon_0+2J) |\vec{\mu} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}|^2 \exp\left[-\frac{T^2}{2}\left(\frac{\epsilon_0+2J}{\hbar} - \omega\right)^2\right] $$
where $J$ is the near-neighbor interaction energy (coupling), and all other symbols are as defined above.

This equation represents a Gaussian absorption profile centered at a new frequency $(\epsilon_0+2J)/\hbar$. The peak is shifted by the interaction energy term $2J$. Due to a quantum mechanical selection rule, all the absorption intensity is concentrated into this single transition to the $k=0$ exciton state.
