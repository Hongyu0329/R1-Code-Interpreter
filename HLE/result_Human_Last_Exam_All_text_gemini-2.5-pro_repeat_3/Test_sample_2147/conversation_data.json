    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core elements of the question are:\n1.  **Subject:** Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian politician and historian.\n2.  **Action:** He \"frequently accused\" and \"denounced\" something.\n3.  **Object of Criticism:** \"The Western culture of his time\" and, more specifically, \"X-Ys\".\n4.  **The Denunciation:** He called them a \"stagnant swamp\".\n5.  **The Goal:** Identify what \"X-Y\" stands for.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Pavel Milyukov's Stance**\nPavel Milyukov was a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) and a famous \"Westernizer.\" This means he generally admired Western political institutions (like British parliamentarianism) and advocated for Russia to follow a similar path of liberal, secular, constitutional development. The claim that he \"accused the Western culture\" seems contradictory at first glance. However, it is plausible that he was critical of specific *trends* within Western or Russian culture that he saw as decadent or counter-productive to the progress he envisioned.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate the \"Stagnant Swamp\" Quote**\nThe phrase \"stagnant swamp\" is most famously associated with Milyukov's powerful speech to the State Duma on November 1, 1916. In this speech, often called the \"Stupidity or Treason?\" speech, he relentlessly attacked the incompetence and failures of the Tsarist government during World War I. He used the \"stagnant swamp\" metaphor to describe the foul atmosphere of corruption, intrigue, and inefficiency surrounding the government, which he attributed to the \"dark forces\" of the empress's circle and Rasputin. While the original target of this specific quote was the Russian government, the question applies it to a cultural group. This suggests the question might be combining Milyukov's famous metaphor with his known views on another subject.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Milyukov's Cultural Criticisms**\nAs a historian trained in the 19th-century positivist tradition, Milyukov was a firm believer in reason, science, and social progress. He was therefore highly critical of the turn-of-the-century cultural movements that rejected rationalism in favor of mysticism, religious revival, and aestheticism. A prominent movement in Russia at this time, reacting to the perceived spiritual emptiness of Western modernity, was known as **\"God-seeking\"** (in Russian, *Bogoiskatel'stvo*).\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate \"God-seekers\" as the \"X-Y\"**\nLet's see if this term fits the criteria:\n*   **Is it a two-word phrase (X-Y)?** Yes, \"God-seekers\" fits this structure perfectly.\n*   **Was Milyukov critical of them?** Yes. To a secular liberal like Milyukov, the \"God-seekers\" (who included figures like Nikolai Berdyaev and Dmitri Merezhkovsky) represented a dangerous retreat from civic duty and rational politics into what he would consider unproductive and obscurantist mysticism. He saw their movement as a betrayal of the progressive, socially-engaged tradition of the Russian intelligentsia.\n*   **Does the \"stagnant swamp\" metaphor fit?** From Milyukov's rationalist viewpoint, a movement focused on inward-looking spiritual quests rather than outward political and social reform could easily be characterized as a \"stagnant swamp\" â€” a place of decay, inaction, and unhealthy introspection, detached from the real-world progress he championed.\n*   **Does it relate to \"Western culture\"?** The \"God-seeking\" movement was a direct Russian response to trends in Western culture, namely the rise of materialism, positivism, and nihilism. It was an attempt to forge a unique spiritual path for Russia in the modern world. Milyukov, who advocated for a more direct adoption of Western liberal models, would have viewed this unique path as a regressive and unhealthy deviation.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy combining Milyukov's famous metaphor (\"stagnant swamp\") with his known intellectual opposition to the religious and mystical trends of his era, we can identify \"X-Y\". The term that best fits the historical context, Milyukov's philosophical position, and the structure of the question is \"God-seekers\".\n\n<<<God-seekers>>>"
