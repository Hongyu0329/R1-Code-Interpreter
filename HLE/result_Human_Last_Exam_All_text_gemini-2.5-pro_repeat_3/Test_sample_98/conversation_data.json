    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron\n*   An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 faces.\n*   Each of its 20 faces is an equilateral triangle.\n*   It has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n*   A key property of the icosahedron (like all regular polyhedra) is that it has a center of symmetry. This means there is a point in the center of the icosahedron such that for any point P within the solid, the point directly opposite through the center (-P) is also within the solid.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Setup\n*   **\"Standing on one of its faces\"**: This means the icosahedron is oriented so that one of its triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base of the tank. Because of the icosahedron's symmetry, this implies there is another triangular face perfectly parallel to the base, forming the top of the tank.\n*   **\"Half-filled with water\"**: This means the volume of the water is exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron tank.\n\n### Step 3: Use Symmetry to Locate the Water Surface\n*   The water surface will be a flat, horizontal plane due to gravity.\n*   The center of symmetry of the icosahedron is its geometric center. Any plane that passes through this center of symmetry divides the icosahedron into two solids of equal volume.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled, the water volume is half the total volume. Therefore, the horizontal water surface must be the plane that passes through the exact center of the icosahedron.\n*   This central plane is parallel to the base and the top face, and it lies exactly halfway between them.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section\n*   The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by cutting the icosahedron with this central horizontal plane.\n*   To determine this shape, let's consider the structure of the icosahedron in this orientation. The 12 vertices are arranged in four distinct horizontal layers:\n    1.  The 3 vertices of the bottom face.\n    2.  A layer of 3 vertices above the base.\n    3.  A layer of 3 vertices below the top.\n    4.  The 3 vertices of the top face.\n*   The central horizontal plane (the water surface) passes exactly between the two middle layers of vertices. This means the plane does not pass through any of the icosahedron's vertices.\n*   Instead, the plane must cut through the edges that connect the two middle layers of vertices.\n*   By analyzing the structure of the icosahedron, we can determine that there are 6 such edges connecting the second layer of vertices to the third layer. These edges form a zigzag pattern around the \"equator\" of the icosahedron.\n*   The central plane intersects each of these 6 edges. The intersection points become the vertices of the polygon that forms the water's surface.\n*   Because of the icosahedron's high degree of symmetry (specifically, a 3-fold rotational symmetry around the vertical axis passing through the centers of the top and bottom faces), these 6 intersection points are arranged in a highly symmetric way. They form the vertices of a **regular hexagon**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n1.  **Orientation is Key**: The problem specifies the icosahedron is resting on a face, which defines the \"up\" direction and the orientation of symmetry.\n2.  **Symmetry is the Shortcut**: Realizing that a central plane bisects the volume is the crucial insight that avoids complex calculations.\n3.  **Cross-Section Shape**: The shape of the water surface is the shape of the central cross-section parallel to a face.\n4.  **Vertices vs. Edges**: The cross-section plane does not pass through any vertices of the icosahedron but instead cuts through 6 of its edges.\n5.  **Regularity**: The symmetry of the icosahedron ensures that the resulting hexagon is not just any hexagon, but a regular one (all sides equal, all angles equal).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe shape of the water surface is the regular hexagon formed by the cross-section of the icosahedron at its horizontal mid-plane.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
