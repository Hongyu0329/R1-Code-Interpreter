    "Answering this question requires combining concepts from poset theory, representation theory of algebras, and homological algebra. Let's break down the question and build the solution step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Terminology\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice (J):** A partially ordered set (poset) $(J, \\le)$ where for any two elements $i, j \\in J$, their least upper bound (or supremum, or join), denoted $i \\vee j$, exists in $J$. We can view any poset as a small category where there is a unique morphism from $i$ to $j$ if and only if $i \\le j$.\n*   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$:** This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a $K$-vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(i \\to j): f(i) \\to f(j)$ to each relation $i \\le j$, such that composition is respected (i.e., $f(j \\to k) \\circ f(i \\to j) = f(i \\to k)$ for $i \\le j \\le k$). The category of such functors is an abelian category, equivalent to the category of modules over the *incidence algebra* $KJ$.\n*   **Tame Functor:** The term \"tame\" refers to the representation type of the category. A category of representations is of **tame type** if its indecomposable objects can be classified and, for any given dimension, fall into a finite number of discrete objects and a finite number of one-parameter families (parameterized by the field $K$). This is in contrast to **finite type** (finitely many indecomposables in total) and **wild type** (classification is as hard as classifying pairs of matrices, a known \"unsolvable\" problem). The phrase \"a tame functor\" implies that the functor $f$ is an object in a category of tame representation type. Thus, we assume that the poset $J$ is of tame representation type.\n*   **n-resolvable:** A functor (or module) $f$ is said to be **n-resolvable** if it has a projective resolution of length $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence of the form:\n    $P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$\n    where each $P_i$ is a projective functor. This is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of $f$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$, is less than or equal to $n$.\n\n### Step 2: Rephrasing the Question\n\nThe question can be rephrased in the language of homological algebra:\n\n\"Let $J$ be an upper semilattice such that its representation category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is of tame type. What is the maximum possible projective dimension of a functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$?\"\n\nFinding this maximum value, let's call it $N$, means any functor is $N$-resolvable. The question asks for the smallest integer $n$ that works for all such functors, which would be this maximum value $N$.\n\n### Step 3: Connecting the Concepts\n\nThe core of the problem is to find a relationship between the structural properties of $J$ (being an upper semilattice of tame type) and the homological properties of its representation category (the global dimension, which is the supremum of all projective dimensions).\n\n1.  **Incidence Algebra:** The category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is equivalent to the category of left modules over the incidence algebra $KJ$. The global dimension of the functor category is equal to the left global dimension of the algebra $KJ$.\n2.  **Upper Semilattice Property:** The fact that $J$ is an upper semilattice is a strong structural constraint. However, it does not by itself limit the global dimension significantly. For example, one can construct upper semilattices of wild representation type, which are expected to have infinite global dimension.\n3.  **Tame Type Property:** The assumption that $J$ is of tame type is the crucial restriction. The celebrated \"Tame-Wild Dichotomy\" by Drozd shows that representation types are sharply divided. Tame algebras are structurally much more constrained than wild ones.\n4.  **Homological Dimension of Tame Algebras:** There are deep theorems connecting the representation type of an algebra to its global dimension.\n    *   For a finite-dimensional algebra $A$ over an algebraically closed field, if $A$ is of tame representation type, it is known that its global dimension, if finite, must be small.\n    *   More specifically, for a **directed algebra** (an algebra whose quiver has no oriented cycles), which includes all incidence algebras of posets, there is a result that if it is of tame representation type, its global dimension is at most 2. This result can be attributed to the work of several representation theorists, including Happel, Ringel, and Simson.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesizing the Answer\n\nLet's put the pieces together.\n\n1.  We are considering a functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice and of tame representation type.\n2.  This is equivalent to studying a module $f$ over the incidence algebra $KJ$.\n3.  The incidence algebra $KJ$ of any finite poset $J$ is a directed algebra.\n4.  A key theorem in representation theory states that a finite-dimensional directed algebra of tame representation type has a global dimension of at most 2.\n5.  Therefore, $\\text{gldim}(KJ) \\le 2$.\n6.  The global dimension is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all modules. So, for any functor $f$, we have $\\text{pd}(f) \\le \\text{gldim}(KJ) \\le 2$.\n7.  Since $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 2$, there exists a projective resolution of $f$ of length 2. This means that $f$ is 2-resolvable.\n8.  To ensure that $n=2$ is the best possible answer, we need to know if a global dimension of exactly 2 is achievable. Indeed, there exist upper semilattices of tame type (specifically, of tubular type, e.g., associated with the extended Dynkin quiver $\\tilde{D}_4$) whose incidence algebras have a global dimension of exactly 2. For such a poset, there will exist functors $f$ with $\\text{pd}(f) = 2$.\n\nConclusion: Any tame functor on an upper semilattice is 2-resolvable, and 2 is the smallest integer for which this is universally true."
