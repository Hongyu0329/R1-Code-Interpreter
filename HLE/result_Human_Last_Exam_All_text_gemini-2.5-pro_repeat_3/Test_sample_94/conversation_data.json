    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key identifiable clues.**\nThe question is asking for the name of a specific physicist. The clues provided are:\n1.  The person is a physicist.\n2.  They are \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\"\n3.  They discovered an \"optical effect in real imagery.\"\n4.  The discovery was prompted by an accidental observation made by a custodial worker.\n5.  The worker was \"cleaning concave mirrors.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the most specific clue - the discovery story.**\nThe anecdote about a discovery being sparked by a custodial worker cleaning a piece of equipment is very specific and a strong starting point. This is not a common story in the history of science, so it should point to a particular event and person. The mention of \"concave mirrors\" further narrows the context to a specific area of optics.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the story to a specific optical effect and physicist.**\nThe story described is a well-known, if sometimes embellished, anecdote about the discovery of the **phase-contrast method**. The physicist in this story is the Dutch Nobel laureate **Frits Zernike**.\n\n*   **The setting:** Zernike was working with optical instruments, including concave diffraction gratings (a type of ruled concave mirror used to separate light into a spectrum).\n*   **The observation:** He was studying imperfections known as \"ghosts\" in the spectra produced by these gratings. He noticed that scratches on the mirror's surface, which don't block light but merely alter the phase of the light that reflects off them (making them \"phase objects\"), could be made visible under certain optical conditions. The popular story mentions that he observed this effect in relation to the dust or cleaning film on the mirror, which led him to understand the underlying principle.\n*   **The \"optical effect\":** This is the principle of phase contrast, where invisible differences in the phase of light waves are converted into visible differences in brightness (amplitude).\n\n**Step 4: Verify the other clues against the identified physicist.**\n*   **Is Frits Zernike a physicist?** Yes, he was a Dutch physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953.\n*   **Is he \"better known for work in the microscopy field?\"** Absolutely. While his discovery originated from studying macroscopic mirrors/gratings, he immediately realized its profound implication for microscopy. He invented the **phase-contrast microscope**, which revolutionized biology and medicine by allowing scientists to view transparent, unstained living cells for the first time. This is his most famous contribution.\n*   **Is the effect related to \"real imagery?\"** Yes, the phase-contrast microscope works by manipulating light in the diffraction plane of the objective lens to produce a visible, real image with enhanced contrast at the image plane.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the analysis to form a conclusion.**\nAll the clues in the question point directly to Frits Zernike. The unique discovery story involving concave mirrors and an accidental observation, combined with his fame in the field of microscopy for applying that discovery, confirms his identity as the correct answer.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
