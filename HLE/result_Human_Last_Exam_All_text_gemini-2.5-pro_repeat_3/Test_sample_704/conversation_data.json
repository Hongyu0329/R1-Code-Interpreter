    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand Newton's Colour Circle and Musical Correspondence**\nIsaac Newton proposed a connection between the seven colours of the visible light spectrum and the seven notes of a Western musical scale. He arranged these colours on a circle. The standard correspondence is as follows:\n*   **Red** -> **C** (Do)\n*   **Orange** -> **D** (Re)\n*   **Yellow** -> **E** (Mi)\n*   **Green** -> **F** (Fa)\n*   **Blue** -> **G** (Sol)\n*   **Indigo** -> **A** (La)\n*   **Violet** -> **B** (Si/Ti)\n\nThe colours are arranged on the circle in the order of the spectrum: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet, and then back to Red.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Starting Point of the Range**\nThe question specifies the starting point as \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\".\n*   **Careful Point:** We must consider what \"combining\" means. In subtractive colour mixing (like with paints or pigments), mixing yellow and blue produces **green**. On Newton's colour circle itself, the colour located between yellow and blue is also **green**. Therefore, the starting point of our range is Green.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Ending Point of the Range**\nThe question clearly states the ending point is \"blue itself\".\n*   So, the ending point of our range is **Blue**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Range on the Colour Circle**\nThe question asks for the note corresponding to the \"range between\" Green and Blue.\n*   **Careful Point:** On the colour circle, the colours are sequential sectors. The order is ..., Yellow, Green, Blue, ...\n*   The \"range between Green and Blue\" refers to the section of the circle that follows Green and leads up to and includes Blue. This is the sector assigned to the colour **Blue**.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Musical Note for the Identified Range**\nNow we map the identified colour sector to its corresponding musical note using the correspondence from Step 1.\n*   The colour sector is **Blue**.\n*   The musical note that corresponds to Blue is **G**.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBy analyzing the components of the question, we determined the range starts at Green and ends at Blue. This range on Newton's circle corresponds to the Blue colour sector. The musical note associated with the Blue sector is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
