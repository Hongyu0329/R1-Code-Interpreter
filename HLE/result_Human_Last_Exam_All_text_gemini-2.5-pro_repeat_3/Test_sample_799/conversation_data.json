    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Definitions\n\n*   **Sidon Set (in the reals):** A set of real numbers, $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums of its elements are unique up to permutation. Formally, for any four elements $a, b, c, d \\in A$, the equation $a+b=c+d$ implies that the set $\\{a, b\\}$ is equal to the set $\\{c, d\\}$. This means either ($a=c$ and $b=d$) or ($a=d$ and $b=c$).\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension ($\\dim_H$):** A concept from fractal geometry used to measure the \"roughness\" or \"complexity\" of a set. It generalizes the notion of dimension to non-integer values. For example, the Hausdorff dimension of a line segment is 1, a square is 2, but the middle-third Cantor set has a dimension of $\\log(2)/\\log(3) \\approx 0.631$.\n\nThe question asks for the value of $\\sup\\{\\dim_H(A) \\mid A \\subset [0,1] \\text{ is a Sidon set}\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound for the Dimension\n\nThis is a non-trivial result from harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The proof is technical and beyond a simple explanation, but its conclusion is crucial.\n*   **Result (J.-P. Kahane, 1994):** If $A$ is a Sidon set, its Hausdorff dimension cannot be greater than 1/2. That is, for any Sidon set $A$, we have $\\dim_H(A) \\le 1/2$.\n*   **Intuition:** The Sidon property imposes a very strong arithmetic restriction on the set. It forces the elements to be \"spread out\" in a way that is incompatible with the geometric \"clustering\" required for a set to have a Hausdorff dimension greater than 1/2. The proof typically involves studying the Fourier transform of a measure supported on the set and using the Sidon property to bound the energy integral of the measure, which relates directly to the Hausdorff dimension via Frostman's Lemma.\n\nThis establishes that the maximum possible dimension is at most 1/2.\n\n### Step 3: Establish a Lower Bound for the Dimension\n\nTo show that 1/2 is the maximum, we need to demonstrate that this upper bound can be achieved. This is done by constructing Sidon sets in $[0,1]$ whose Hausdorff dimension can be made arbitrarily close to 1/2.\n\n*   **Construction Strategy:** The general approach is to build a fractal set, similar to a Cantor set, whose elements are determined by sequences of \"digits\" drawn from an integer Sidon set.\n*   **Integer Sidon Sets:** First, we need dense Sidon sets of integers. It is a classic result (due to Singer, and Bose & Chowla) that for certain large integers $N$, there exist Sidon sets $S \\subset \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$ whose size $|S|$ is approximately $\\sqrt{N}$.\n*   **Cantor-like Construction:** We can construct a set of real numbers in $[0,1]$ using a base-$q$ expansion where the digits are restricted to an integer Sidon set $S$. A simple version is $C = \\{ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{s_k}{q^k} \\mid s_k \\in S \\text{ for all } k \\}$.\n    *   **Dimension of the Construction:** The Hausdorff dimension of such a set is given by $\\dim_H(C) = \\frac{\\log|S|}{\\log q}$. If we choose an integer Sidon set $S \\subset \\{1, ..., N-1\\}$ with $|S| \\approx \\sqrt{N}$ and set the base $q=N$, the dimension is $\\dim_H(C) \\approx \\frac{\\log(\\sqrt{N})}{\\log N} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\log N}{\\log N} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This suggests that 1/2 is achievable.\n*   **Careful Point (The Subtlety of the Construction):** The simple construction described above does *not* necessarily yield a Sidon set in the reals. The reason is that if one takes two numbers $a, b \\in C$ with digit sequences $(s_1, s_2, \\dots)$ and $(t_1, t_2, \\dots)$, one can form new numbers $c$ and $d$ by swapping digits (e.g., $c$ has digits $(s_1, t_2, s_3, \\dots)$ and $d$ has digits $(t_1, s_2, t_3, \\dots)$). It can happen that $a,b,c,d$ are all distinct members of $C$, and $a+b=c+d$, which violates the Sidon property.\n*   **Corrected Construction:** To fix this issue, a more sophisticated construction is required. This is typically done using a \"lacunary\" or rapidly growing sequence of bases ($q_k$). For example, one can define a set as $A = \\{ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{s_k}{q_1 q_2 \\cdots q_k} \\mid s_k \\in S_k \\}$, where $S_k$ is a Sidon set of integers and the bases $q_k$ grow extremely fast (e.g., $q_{k+1}$ is much larger than $q_k^2$). This high degree of lacunarity ensures that the \"place values\" are so different that the digit-swapping problem is avoided, and the resulting set is indeed a Sidon set. By carefully choosing the sets $S_k$ and bases $q_k$, the Hausdorff dimension of $A$ can be shown to be arbitrarily close to 1/2. In fact, a compact Sidon set with dimension exactly 1/2 can be constructed.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\n1.  The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ is at most 1/2.\n2.  There exist constructions of Sidon sets in $[0,1]$ whose Hausdorff dimension is equal to 1/2.\n\nCombining these two facts, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is exactly 1/2.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1/2}$.\n<<<1/2>>>"
