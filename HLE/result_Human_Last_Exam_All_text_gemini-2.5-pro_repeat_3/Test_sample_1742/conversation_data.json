    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules\n\nThe algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q$ with three vertices and two arrows in a line: $1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a representation-finite algebra of type $A_3$.\n\nThe indecomposable $A$-modules can be indexed by intervals $[i,j]$ where $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. The module $M_{[i,j]}$ has dimension 1 at vertices $k$ such that $i \\le k \\le j$, and 0 otherwise. The maps are identities where possible. There are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6$ such modules:\n1.  $M_{[1,1]} = S_1$ (simple module at vertex 1). This is also the injective module $I_1$.\n2.  $M_{[2,2]} = S_2$ (simple module at vertex 2).\n3.  $M_{[3,3]} = S_3$ (simple module at vertex 3). This is also the projective module $P_3$.\n4.  $M_{[1,2]} = I_2$ (injective module for vertex 2).\n5.  $M_{[2,3]} = P_2$ (projective module for vertex 2).\n6.  $M_{[1,3]} = P_1 = I_3$ (projective for vertex 1 and injective for vertex 3).\n\n### Step 2: The Auslander-Reiten (AR) Quiver\n\nThe AR-quiver for this algebra has the shape of a triangle. The vertices are the indecomposable modules. We denote $M_{[i,j]}$ by $(i,j)$:\n```\n      (1,3)\n     /   \\\n  (1,2)   (2,3)\n  /   \\   /   \\\n(1,1)   (2,2)   (3,3)\n```\nThe arrows in this diagram represent irreducible maps, pointing downwards and to the left/right.\n\n*   Projective modules are on the right edge: $P_1=(1,3)$, $P_2=(2,3)$, $P_3=(3,3)$.\n*   Injective modules are on the left edge: $I_1=(1,1)$, $I_2=(1,2)$, $I_3=(1,3)$.\n\n### Step 3: Identify all $\\tau$-tilting modules\n\nFor an algebra of type $A_n$, the number of $\\tau$-tilting modules is given by the Catalan number $C_n = \\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2n}{n}$. For $n=3$, this is $C_3=5$. These five modules are known and can be listed in terms of the indecomposable modules identified above:\n\n1.  $T_A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3 = M_{[1,3]} \\oplus M_{[2,3]} \\oplus M_{[3,3]}$\n2.  $T_B = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3 = M_{[1,1]} \\oplus M_{[1,2]} \\oplus M_{[1,3]}$\n3.  $T_C = S_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3 = M_{[1,1]} \\oplus M_{[2,3]} \\oplus M_{[3,3]}$\n4.  $T_D = I_2 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus P_3 = M_{[1,2]} \\oplus M_{[2,2]} \\oplus M_{[3,3]}$\n5.  $T_E = S_1 \\oplus P_1 \\oplus S_2 = M_{[1,1]} \\oplus M_{[1,3]} \\oplus M_{[2,2]}$\n\n### Step 4: Define a Slice Module\n\nA slice module is a tilting module whose indecomposable summands form a **slice** in the AR-quiver. A key property of a slice is that it must be **convex**. A full subquiver $\\Sigma$ of the AR-quiver is convex if for any path $X_1 \\to X_2 \\to \\dots \\to X_k$ in the AR-quiver, if the endpoints $X_1$ and $X_k$ are in $\\Sigma$, then the entire path (all $X_i$) must be in $\\Sigma$.\n\nA $\\tau$-tilting module is a \"slice\" if the set of its indecomposable summands is convex in the AR-quiver.\n\n### Step 5: Check which of the $\\tau$-tilting modules is not a slice\n\nWe check the convexity of the set of indecomposable summands for each of the five $\\tau$-tilting modules.\n\n1.  **$T_A = M_{[1,3]} \\oplus M_{[2,3]} \\oplus M_{[3,3]}$**: The set of summands is $\\Sigma_A = \\{(1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\\}$. Any path between two modules in this set stays within the set. For example, the only path is $(2,3) \\to (3,3)$, but this path does not start and end in $\\Sigma_A$ in a way that violates convexity as there are no intermediate vertices. This set is convex. It forms a slice.\n\n2.  **$T_B = M_{[1,1]} \\oplus M_{[1,2]} \\oplus M_{[1,3]}$**: The set of summands is $\\Sigma_B = \\{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\\}$. The paths $(1,3) \\to (1,2)$ and $(1,2) \\to (1,1)$ are contained entirely within $\\Sigma_B$. This set is convex. It forms a slice.\n\n3.  **$T_C = M_{[1,1]} \\oplus M_{[2,3]} \\oplus M_{[3,3]}$**: The set of summands is $\\Sigma_C = \\{(1,1), (2,3), (3,3)\\}$. There are no paths in the AR-quiver between any two distinct modules in this set. Thus, the convexity condition is trivially satisfied. This forms a slice.\n\n4.  **$T_D = M_{[1,2]} \\oplus M_{[2,2]} \\oplus M_{[3,3]}$**: The set of summands is $\\Sigma_D = \\{(1,2), (2,2), (3,3)\\}$. The only path between modules in the set is $(1,2) \\to (2,2)$. This set is convex. It forms a slice.\n\n5.  **$T_E = M_{[1,1]} \\oplus M_{[1,3]} \\oplus M_{[2,2]}$**: The set of summands is $\\Sigma_E = \\{(1,1), (1,3), (2,2)\\}$. Consider the path in the AR-quiver: $(1,3) \\to (1,2) \\to (2,2)$. The endpoints of this path, $(1,3)$ and $(2,2)$, are in $\\Sigma_E$. However, the intermediate module, $(1,2)$, is not in $\\Sigma_E$. This violates the convexity condition.\n\nTherefore, the set of summands for $T_E$ is not convex, and thus $T_E$ is not a slice module.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe five $\\tau$-tilting modules are analyzed, and only one of them, $T_E = M_{[1,1]} \\oplus M_{[1,3]} \\oplus M_{[2,2]}$, has a set of indecomposable summands that is not convex in the AR-quiver. This makes it the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice. Expressed in terms of simple, projective, and injective modules, this module is $S_1 \\oplus P_1 \\oplus S_2$.\n\n<<<S_1 \\oplus P_1 \\oplus S_2>>>"
