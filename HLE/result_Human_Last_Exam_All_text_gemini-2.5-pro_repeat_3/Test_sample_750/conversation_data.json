    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the equation and define the terms**\nThe equation we need to solve is $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\nLet $z = x + iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe left side (LHS) of the equation is straightforward:\nLHS = $(x+iy) \\cdot i = xi + i^2y = -y + ix$.\n\nThe right side (RHS) involves complex exponentiation, which is multi-valued. The general definition is $a^b = e^{b \\ln(a)}$.\nRHS = $i^z = e^{z \\ln(i)}$.\n\nThe complex logarithm $\\ln(w)$ is defined as $\\ln(w) = \\ln|w| + i(\\arg(w) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\nFor $w=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\pi/2$.\nSo, $\\ln(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nLet's define the constant $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for an integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThus, $\\ln(i) = iC_k$.\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for the RHS:\nRHS = $i^z = e^{z \\cdot (iC_k)} = e^{(x+iy)iC_k} = e^{ixC_k + i^2yC_k} = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$, we can expand the RHS:\nRHS = $e^{-yC_k} \\cdot e^{ixC_k} = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\n**Step 2: Equate the two sides and form a system of equations**\nNow we set LHS = RHS:\n$-y + ix = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts, we get a system of two equations:\n1.  Real part: $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k)$\n2.  Imaginary part: $x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$\n\nWe need to find all pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy this system for some integer $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze special cases**\n\n**Case A: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $0 = e^{0} \\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$.\n2.  $x = e^{0} \\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nFrom $\\cos(xC_k) = 0$, we must have $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nSubstitute this into the second equation: $x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$.\nThe value of $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$ is either $1$ (for even $n$) or $-1$ (for odd $n$).\n*   If $x=1$: We must have $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)=1$, which means $n$ is an even integer, say $n=2m$. The condition on $C_k$ becomes $1 \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$. Since $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, this implies $k=m$. This is possible for any integer $k$. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n*   If $x=-1$: We must have $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)=-1$, which means $n$ is an odd integer, say $n=2m+1$. The condition on $C_k$ becomes $(-1) \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + (2m+1)\\pi = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$. This means $-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$, which simplifies to $-1-k=m$. This is also possible for any integer $k$. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n2.  $0 = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(0) \\implies 0=0$. This is always true.\n\nSo we only need to solve the equation $-y = e^{-yC_k}$ for $y$. Let's analyze this equation.\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi > 0$. Let $f(y)=-y$ and $g(y)=e^{-yC_k}$. A graphical analysis or a study of the function $h(y) = e^{-yC_k} + y$ shows that $h(y)$ has a minimum value when $h'(y)=-C_ke^{-yC_k}+1=0$, which occurs at $y=\\frac{\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$. The minimum value is $h(\\frac{\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}) = \\frac{1}{C_k}+\\frac{\\ln(C_k)}{C_k}$. For a solution to exist, this minimum must be $\\le 0$. This requires $1+\\ln(C_k) \\le 0$, or $C_k \\le 1/e$. However, for $k \\ge 0$, $C_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1/e$. Therefore, there are no solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n*   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k < 0$. In this case, the function $f(y)=-y$ is strictly decreasing, while $g(y)=e^{-yC_k}$ is strictly increasing (since the exponent's coefficient $-C_k$ is positive). Therefore, there must be exactly one intersection point, meaning a unique solution for $y$ for each integer $k \\le -1$. A check shows these values of $y$ are always negative.\n\nThe equation $-y = e^{-yC_k}$ can be rewritten as $y e^{yC_k} = -1$. Let $u = yC_k$. Then $y=u/C_k$, so $\\frac{u}{C_k}e^u = -1$, which gives $ue^u = -C_k$.\nThe solution for $u$ is given by the Lambert W function, $u = W(-C_k)$.\nSince $k \\le -1$, $C_k < 0$, so $-C_k > 0$. For a positive argument, the Lambert W function has a single real value, given by the principal branch $W_0$.\nSo, $u = W_0(-C_k)$, and the solution for $y$ is $y_k = \\frac{u}{C_k} = \\frac{W_0(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\nSince $W_0(-C_k)>0$ and $C_k<0$, we have $y_k<0$.\nSo, for each integer $k \\le -1$, we have a purely imaginary solution $z_k = i y_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$.\n\n**Case C: Other complex solutions ($x \\ne 0, y \\ne 0$)**\nIt can be shown that there exist other solutions that are not purely real or purely imaginary. These solutions are the roots of a complicated system of transcendental equations and do not have a simple closed-form expression in terms of standard mathematical functions. For most contexts, \"solving\" an equation implies finding these closed-form solutions. The solutions found in Cases A and B are the only such solutions.\n\n**Final Summary of Solutions**\nBased on the analysis, the solutions that can be expressed in a closed form are:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions, one for each integer $k \\le -1$. These solutions are given by $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-\\pi(1/2+2k))}{\\pi(1/2+2k)}$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n\nFinal answer will list these solutions.\n\n<<<The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-\\pi(\\frac{1}{2}+2k))}{\\pi(\\frac{1}{2}+2k)}$ for all integers $k \\le -1$, where $W_0$ denotes the principal branch of the Lambert W function."
