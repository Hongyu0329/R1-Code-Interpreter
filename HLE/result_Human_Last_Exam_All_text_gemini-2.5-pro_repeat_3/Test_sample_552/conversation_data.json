    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know the name of the person whose lectures were cited by Albert Einstein in his specific 1905 paper concerning Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Paper:** The paper in question is one of Einstein's \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers from 1905. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Term \"Cite\":** The word \"cite\" can have two meanings:\n    *   **Strict/Formal Meaning:** To include a formal reference, footnote, or in-text attribution that explicitly names the person and/or their work.\n    *   **Broad/Intellectual Meaning:** To use as a direct foundation or basis for one's own work, even if not explicitly named.\n\n4.  **Examine the Paper for Citations (Strict Meaning):** A careful examination of Einstein's 1905 Brownian motion paper reveals a significant point often noted by historians of science: the paper contains **no formal citations or bibliography**. Einstein, particularly in his early work, tended to derive results from first principles and did not reference the work of others, even when it was highly relevant. So, in the strictest sense, he cited no one.\n\n5.  **Examine the Paper for Influence (Broad Meaning):** The question uses the specific word \"lectures,\" which is a strong clue. While Einstein didn't formally cite anyone, the entire theoretical framework of his paper—connecting the random motion of particles to the kinetic theory of heat using statistical methods—is built directly upon the work of a single, monumental figure in physics. The foundational concepts, such as the statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics, were learned by Einstein from this physicist's writings.\n\n6.  **Identify the Influential Scientist and their Work:** The physicist whose work was the unacknowledged foundation for Einstein's paper is **Ludwig Boltzmann**. Einstein's understanding of statistical mechanics came primarily from studying Boltzmann's book titled **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"**, which translates to **\"Lectures on Gas Theory\"**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Lack of Formal Citation:** It is crucial to understand that there is no line in the 1905 paper that reads \"according to Boltzmann's lectures...\" or a similar explicit attribution. The \"citation\" is one of intellectual inheritance, not formal academic practice as we know it today.\n*   **The Specificity of \"Lectures\":** The question is well-posed because it points directly to the form of Boltzmann's most famous work on the topic, his \"Lectures on Gas Theory.\" This is the source from which Einstein drew the theoretical tools he needed.\n*   **Contrast with Later Work:** It is informative to note that in a later, more detailed paper on Brownian motion published in 1906, Einstein *did* explicitly cite Boltzmann's \"Lectures on Gas Theory.\" This confirms that Boltzmann's work was indeed the basis for his reasoning.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlthough Albert Einstein did not include any formal citations in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, the entire theoretical argument is based on the principles of statistical mechanics that he learned from the writings of Ludwig Boltzmann. Specifically, the influential work was Boltzmann's book \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" (*Vorlesungen über Gastheorie*). Therefore, Ludwig Boltzmann is the person whose lectures were the fundamental source for Einstein's paper.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
