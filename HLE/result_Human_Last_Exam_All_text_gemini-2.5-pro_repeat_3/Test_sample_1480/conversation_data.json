    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify Key Concepts\n\n*   **Fuzzy System Type:** The question specifies an **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3FS)**. This is a type of fuzzy set with a higher degree of uncertainty than standard Type-1 or Type-2 fuzzy sets. A key feature is the concept of primary and secondary memberships.\n*   **Task:** Calculate the **rule activation level** (also known as firing strength). This value represents how strongly a given input `x'` activates a specific fuzzy rule `k`.\n*   **Given Values:**\n    1.  `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n    2.  `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n*   **Operation:** The combination must be done using a **t-norm operation**.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Given Values in the Context of a Fuzzy Rule\n\nA fuzzy IF-THEN rule has the general form: `IF (antecedent) THEN (consequent)`. The rule activation level is determined exclusively by the **antecedent** (the IF part).\n\n1.  **Analyzing `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`**:\n    *   The notation `G_k` typically represents the fuzzy set in the **consequent** (the THEN part) of rule `k`.\n    *   The membership `μG_k_j(y_j)` is calculated during the implication step, which occurs *after* the rule activation level has been determined.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is highly probable that this term is a typo and was intended to represent the membership of the input `x'` in the antecedent fuzzy set `F_k`. We will proceed by assuming this is the **primary membership grade** of the input in the antecedent part of the rule.\n    *   So, we interpret this as: Primary Membership = 0.9.\n\n2.  **Analyzing `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`**:\n    *   The \"Type-3\" nature of the fuzzy set implies an additional layer of uncertainty beyond the primary membership. This is often conceptualized as a \"secondary membership\".\n    *   The notation `Phi` (Φ) or similar Greek letters are often used in advanced fuzzy literature to denote these higher-order membership functions or potentials.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is logical to interpret `Phi_k(x′)` as the **secondary membership grade** associated with the primary membership. This value quantifies the uncertainty about the primary membership value itself.\n    *   So, we interpret this as: Secondary Membership = 0.7.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the T-norm Operation\n\nThe problem states that a t-norm must be used to calculate the final activation level. A t-norm is a function that models the logical `AND` operation in fuzzy logic. It combines multiple membership values into a single one.\n\n*   Based on our interpretation, the rule activation level is the combination of the primary and secondary membership grades.\n*   Activation Level (`α`) = t-norm(Primary Membership, Secondary Membership)\n*   `α` = t-norm(0.9, 0.7)\n\n### Step 4: Select a Specific T-norm and Calculate the Final Answer\n\nThe problem does not specify which t-norm to use. The most common and standard t-norms are:\n*   **Minimum (MIN):** `min(a, b)`\n*   **Algebraic Product (PRODUCT):** `a * b`\n\n*   **Careful Point:** In the absence of specific instructions, the **MIN** t-norm is the most conventional choice for fuzzy logic operations, especially for combining antecedent clauses or different levels of membership.\n\nLet's calculate the activation level using the MIN t-norm:\n`α = min(0.9, 0.7)`\n`α = 0.7`\n\nIf we were to use the PRODUCT t-norm, the result would be `0.9 * 0.7 = 0.63`. However, MIN is the standard assumption.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy interpreting the provided values as primary and secondary membership grades and combining them with the standard MIN t-norm, we arrive at the final activation level.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n*   Primary Membership (assumed): 0.9\n*   Secondary Membership: 0.7\n*   T-norm Operation: MIN\n*   Rule Activation Level = min(0.9, 0.7) = 0.7\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
