    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order `2^m`, denoted `SD_{2^m}`, has the presentation:\n    `SD_{2^m} = <a, b | a^(2^(m-1)) = e, b^2 = e, bab = a^(-1 + 2^(m-2))>`\n    In this problem, the size of the group is 512, which is `2^9`. So, we have `m=9`.\n    The group is `G = SD_512`, with the presentation:\n    `G = <a, b | a^256 = e, b^2 = e, bab = a^(128 - 1) = a^127>`\n    The order of the subgroup `<a>` is 256. The elements of `G` are of the form `a^i` or `a^i * b` for `0 <= i < 256`.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A power subgroup of a group `G` is a subgroup of the form `G^n`, which is defined as the subgroup generated by the n-th powers of all elements in `G`.\n    `G^n = <g^n | g ∈ G>`\n    Our goal is to find the number of distinct subgroups in the set `{G^n | n ∈ Z}`.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Problem\nThe set of power subgroups `{G^n | n ∈ Z}` is identical to `{G^d | d divides exp(G)}`, where `exp(G)` is the exponent of the group `G`. However, a more direct simplification is available for p-groups.\nFor any integer `n`, we can write `n = 2^j * k` where `k` is an odd integer.\nSince `G` is a 2-group (its order is a power of 2), the mapping `g -> g^k` is an automorphism of `G` because `gcd(k, |G|) = 1`. This means the set `{g^k | g ∈ G}` is equal to `G`.\nTherefore, `G^n = G^(2^j * k) = <g^(2^j * k) | g ∈ G> = <(g^k)^(2^j) | g ∈ G>`. Since `{g^k | g ∈ G} = G`, this is equal to `<h^(2^j) | h ∈ G> = G^(2^j)`.\nThis crucial simplification means we only need to find the distinct subgroups for `n` being powers of 2, i.e., `n = 2^j` for `j ≥ 0`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Powers of Elements in G\nWe need to compute `g^n` for the two types of elements in `G`.\n1.  **Elements of the form `a^i`:**\n    `(a^i)^n = a^(in)`\n\n2.  **Elements of the form `a^i * b`:** We first compute the square of such an element.\n    `(a^i * b)^2 = (a^i * b) * (a^i * b) = a^i * (b * a^i * b) = a^i * (b a b)^i = a^i * (a^127)^i = a^i * a^(127i) = a^(128i)`.\n    Since `a^128` has order 2, we have `(a^128)^2 = a^256 = e`.\n    So, `(a^i * b)^4 = ((a^i * b)^2)^2 = (a^(128i))^2 = a^(256i) = e`.\n    This implies that for any `n` that is a multiple of 4, `(a^i * b)^n = e`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Power Subgroups G^(2^j)\nWe now compute the subgroups `G^n` where `n = 2^j`.\n\n*   **`j = 0` (n = 1, odd case):**\n    `G^1 = <g^1 | g ∈ G> = G`.\n    This gives our first power subgroup, `G` itself.\n\n*   **`j = 1` (n = 2, even case):**\n    `G^2 = <g^2 | g ∈ G>`. The generators are `(a^i)^2 = a^(2i)` and `(a^i * b)^2 = a^(128i)`.\n    The set `{a^(2i)}` generates the subgroup `<a^2>`.\n    The set `{a^(128i)}` generates the subgroup `<a^128>`.\n    `G^2 = <a^2, a^128> = <a^gcd(2, 128)> = <a^2>`.\n    This is a cyclic subgroup of order `256/2 = 128`. This is our second power subgroup.\n\n*   **`j = 2` (n = 4, even case):**\n    `G^4 = <g^4 | g ∈ G>`. The generators are `(a^i)^4 = a^(4i)` and `(a^i * b)^4 = e`.\n    The set `{a^(4i)}` generates `<a^4>`.\n    The set `{e}` generates the trivial subgroup `{e}`.\n    `G^4 = <a^4, e> = <a^4>`.\n    This is a cyclic subgroup of order `256/4 = 64`. This is our third power subgroup.\n\n*   **`j ≥ 2` (n = 2^j, even case):**\n    For `j ≥ 2`, `n = 2^j` is a multiple of 4.\n    `G^n = <g^n | g ∈ G>`. The generators are `(a^i)^n = a^(in)` and `(a^i * b)^n = e`.\n    The set `{a^(in)}` generates `<a^n> = <a^(2^j)>`.\n    Thus, for `j ≥ 2`, `G^(2^j) = <a^(2^j)>`.\n\n### Step 5: List all Distinct Power Subgroups\nBased on the previous steps, the set of power subgroups is:\n1.  `G^1 = G`\n2.  `G^2 = <a^2>`\n3.  `G^4 = <a^4>`\n4.  `G^8 = <a^8>`\n5.  `G^16 = <a^16>`\n6.  `G^32 = <a^32>`\n7.  `G^64 = <a^64>`\n8.  `G^128 = <a^128>`\n9.  `G^256 = <a^256> = {e}` (the trivial subgroup)\n\nFor any `j > 8`, `n = 2^j` is a multiple of 256. Since the exponent of `G` is 256, `g^n = e` for all `g ∈ G`, so `G^n = {e}`. Thus, `G^256` is the last distinct subgroup in this sequence.\n\nThe orders of these subgroups are 512, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, respectively. Since all the orders are different, the subgroups are all distinct.\n\nCounting them, we have a total of 9 distinct power subgroups.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512 is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
