The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is highly dependent on the specific application, as the catalytic mechanisms and operating conditions for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS) are vastly different.

For the **Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, the optimal performance is achieved by maximizing the synergistic interface between Ni nanoparticles and the ceria support. This typically occurs at a Ni loading of 5-15 wt%. A widely reported optimal value is around 10 wt% Ni, which corresponds to a **Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately 0.25-0.35**.

For **thermochemical Water Splitting (WS)**, Ni is generally used as a dopant to enhance the bulk redox properties of ceria and its stability at very high temperatures. The ideal concentration is much lower to prevent phase separation and sintering. The optimal performance is found with a Ni dopant concentration of 1-5 mol%, corresponding to a **Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately 0.01-0.05**.

Therefore, there is no single ideal ratio; the optimal Ni/Ce molar ratio for WGS is about an order of magnitude higher than for WS.
