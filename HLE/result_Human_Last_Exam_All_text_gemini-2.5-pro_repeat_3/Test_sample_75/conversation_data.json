    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Conflict:** The \"Second Great War\" is the common term for the galaxy-spanning conflict that takes place during the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*). This conflict is also referred to as the \"End War\".\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date:** The war officially begins with the start of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign. The Zerg Swarm, led by the Queen of Blades, launches a full-scale invasion of the Terran Dominion. According to the official StarCraft timeline, this event occurs in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date:** The war concludes after the final campaign of *Legacy of the Void*, in the epilogue titled \"Into the Void\". In this final arc, the united forces of the Terran, Protoss, and Zerg venture into the Void to confront and ultimately destroy the dark god Amon, the true architect of the war. This final victory takes place in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Elapsed Time:** The war begins at some point in the year 2504 and ends at some point in the year 2506. To calculate the duration, we consider the entire period:\n    *   The initial phase of the war, including the events of *Wings of Liberty* and *Heart of the Swarm*, occurs during **2504**.\n    *   The year **2505** is a period of relative quiet on the main fronts but is still part of the war's timeline. During this time, the various factions regroup and prepare for the next phase (Artanis unifies the Protoss, Kerrigan evolves the Swarm, etc.).\n    *   The final, decisive phase of the war, encompassing the events of *Legacy of the Void* and its epilogue, takes place in **2506**.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation and Rounding:** The conflict spans a period that includes parts of 2504, the entirety of 2505, and parts of 2506. This means the total duration is more than one year (all of 2505) plus some additional months from 2504 and 2506. This results in a duration that is greater than 1 year and is likely just over 2 years (e.g., 2 years and a few months).\n\n    The question specifically asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**.\n    *   Since the duration is certainly greater than 2.0 years (e.g., 2 years and 2 months is ~2.17 years), rounding this value up to the nearest whole number gives 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of \"War\":** The duration of a war is measured from its official start to its official end, including any lulls or periods of lower-intensity conflict in between.\n*   **Official Timeline:** The years 2504 and 2506 are based on the canonical timeline provided by Blizzard Entertainment for the StarCraft universe.\n*   **Rounding Instruction:** The \"rounded up\" requirement is key. Any duration that is not an exact whole number must be rounded to the next highest integer. Since the war did not start on January 1st, 2504, and end on December 31st, 2505 (which would be exactly 2 years), its duration will be a fractional number greater than 2, which rounds up to 3.\n\nBy following this analysis, we conclude the length of the Second Great War.\n\n<<<3>>>"
