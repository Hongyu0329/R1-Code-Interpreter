    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing that turns to the dancer's left. It is a fundamental part of all five International Standard dances listed in the options.\n    *   **Overturning:** This means turning more than the prescribed amount for a given step or figure. For example, if a step is supposed to turn 3/8, overturning would mean turning 1/2 or more. It is generally considered a technical fault.\n    *   **\"Impossible... without disregarding the technique\":** This is the crucial part of the question. It doesn't ask if it's physically impossible to turn more. It asks in which dance the *correct technique itself* makes overturning a violation of its fundamental principles, rather than just a quantitative error (i.e., turning too much).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Technique of Each Dance:**\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz, B. English Waltz, D. Slow Foxtrot, E. Quickstep:** These four dances are known as \"swing dances.\" Their technique is built upon principles of momentum, swing, sway, Contra Body Movement (CBM), and rise and fall. The turns in these dances are flowing and continuous. While each figure has a prescribed amount of turn, overturning is a common mistake that involves exaggerating the existing mechanics (e.g., too much swing, too much sway). It is a *quantitative* errorâ€”doing too much of a correct action. It's bad technique, but it doesn't fundamentally contradict the nature of the dance. You are still using swing and sway, just incorrectly.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** The Tango stands apart from the other four. Its technique is fundamentally different.\n        *   **No Swing or Sway:** Tango technique explicitly forbids the body sway used in swing dances.\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is performed on a level plane with bent knees, without the characteristic rise and fall of the Waltz or Foxtrot.\n        *   **Staccato Action:** Movement is sharp, clipped, and decisive, not flowing. The feet are picked up and placed, not glided.\n        *   **Turns in Tango:** Because there is no swing or momentum to carry the couple around, turns are created through sharp, controlled rotation and swivels. They are often described as \"turning a corner\" rather than \"swinging around a curve.\" The Reverse Turn in Tango is structured with precise foot placements and body actions that achieve a specific amount of turn without any flow. To \"overturn\" a Tango turn, a dancer would be forced to introduce momentum and a swinging action to create the extra rotation. This swinging action is a direct and fundamental violation of Tango technique. Therefore, the very act of overturning is not just an exaggeration of correct technique, but an introduction of an *incorrect* and forbidden technical element (swing).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    In the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, etc.), overturning is a fault of *degree*. In the Tango, overturning is a fault of *kind*. You cannot overturn a Tango turn without introducing swing, which means you are no longer dancing with Tango technique. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn in Tango without disregarding its core technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
