    "### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific character in William Morris's novel, *The House of the Wolfings*. The character must meet three criteria:\n    *   They visited a Roman city.\n    *   They describe Roman religious practices.\n    *   This description includes a recognizable account of the Romulus and Remus myth.\n\n2.  **Examine the Main Characters and their Roles:**\n    *   **Thiodolf:** He is the war-leader of the Wolfings. His story is centered on leading his people in the defense of their homeland, Mirkwood, against the invading Roman army. He has not traveled to a Roman city; his experience with Romans is purely as an enemy on the battlefield.\n    *   **Hall-Sun:** She is Thiodolf's wife and a daughter of the gods (a Valkyrie-like figure). Her sphere of influence and knowledge is rooted in the divine and the world of the Goths. She provides the magical hauberk but has no direct experience with Roman cities or their culture.\n    *   **Otter:** He is a thrall (a slave or bondsman) in the household of the Wolfings. His backstory, which is revealed during the novel, is crucial. As a thrall, he was captured in war and has lived among different peoples before coming to the Wolfings.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Otter's Backstory against the Question's Criteria:**\n    *   **Visited a Roman city?** Yes. In Chapter VI, \"Otter tells of the Roman Folk,\" Otter recounts his past. He explicitly states that he was a thrall in a Roman town before being captured by the Wolfings' kinsmen, the Gepid Goths.\n    *   **Describes Roman religious practices?** Yes. The entire purpose of his tale in Chapter VI is to inform the Wolfing chieftains about the nature of the Romans. He describes their cities, their society, and their beliefs, contrasting them with the Gothic ways.\n    *   **Refers to Romulus and Remus?** Yes, this is the key point. In his description, Otter talks about the Roman gods. He says they do not worship the \"Gods of the Goths\" but instead worship the founders of their great city. He then describes the founding myth as he heard it: \"...they tell of the first builders of that great burg, that they were twin brethren, and that a she-wolf gave them suck when they were babies...\"\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   Thiodolf and Hall-Sun do not fit the criteria. Their knowledge of Romans is not based on firsthand cultural observation within a Roman city.\n    *   Otter's character arc includes a specific scene where he details his life as a captive among the Romans.\n    *   In this scene, he provides a description of the Roman founding myth that is a clear and unmistakable reference to the story of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe character who visited a Roman city and described its founding myth involving twin brothers and a she-wolf is the thrall, Otter.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
