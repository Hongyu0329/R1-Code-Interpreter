    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z.\n\n### Step 1: Write down the general formula for the grand canonical partition function.\nThe grand canonical partition function, Z, for a system described by a Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ and a particle number operator $\\hat{N}$ at inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ and chemical potential $\\mu$ is given by the trace:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left( e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right)$\n\n### Step 2: Substitute the given Hamiltonian into the formula.\nThe problem states that the Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. We substitute this into the expression for Z:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left( e^{-\\beta(-\\mu \\hat{N} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right)$\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left( e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu \\hat{N})} \\right)$\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left( e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} \\right)$\n\n### Step 3: Relate the expression to the path integral formalism.\nThe question requires using path integrals. The path integral representation for the partition function Z is given by:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\nwhere $\\psi$ and $\\psi^*$ are complex fields (for bosons) or Grassmann fields (for fermions), and S is the Euclidean action.\n\nThe action S is derived from the grand canonical Hamiltonian operator, $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N}$.\nIn our case, $\\hat{K} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$.\nThe general form of the action is $S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}$, where the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ is given by $\\mathcal{L} = \\psi^* \\partial_\\tau \\psi + \\mathcal{K}$. Here, $\\mathcal{K}$ is the density corresponding to the operator $\\hat{K}$.\nThe particle number operator $\\hat{N}$ corresponds to $\\int d^d x \\, \\psi^* \\psi$. Thus, the operator $\\hat{K} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$ corresponds to the Hamiltonian density term $\\mathcal{K} = -2\\mu \\psi^* \\psi$.\nThe action is therefore:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, (\\psi^* \\partial_\\tau \\psi - 2\\mu \\psi^* \\psi)$\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(\\tau, \\vec{x}) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the structure of the action.\nA key point is that the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$ does not contain any kinetic energy term (which would involve spatial derivatives like $\\nabla^2$). Consequently, the action does not couple different spatial points. This implies that all spatial modes of the field are degenerate and independent. The path integral effectively reduces to a problem in zero spatial dimensions, i.e., the quantum mechanics of a single site or mode.\nThe problem can thus be analyzed by considering a single quantum mode that can be occupied by particles.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the partition function for a single mode.\nWe can evaluate the trace from Step 2 for a single mode. The nature of the result depends on the statistics of the particles (bosons or fermions).\n\n**Case A: Bosons**\nFor a single bosonic mode, the particle number N can be any non-negative integer: $N = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. Each N-particle state is non-degenerate for a single mode. The trace becomes a sum over these states:\n$Z_B = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} \\langle N | e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} | N \\rangle = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} e^{2\\beta\\mu N}$\nThis is a geometric series with ratio $r = e^{2\\beta\\mu}$. The series converges if $|r|<1$, which means $e^{2\\beta\\mu} < 1$. Since $\\beta > 0$, this requires $2\\beta\\mu < 0$, or $\\mu < 0$.\nAssuming this condition holds, the sum is:\n$Z_B = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\n**Case B: Fermions**\nFor a single fermionic mode, the Pauli exclusion principle restricts the occupation number to $N=0$ or $N=1$. The trace is a sum over these two states:\n$Z_F = \\sum_{N=0}^{1} \\langle N | e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} | N \\rangle = e^{2\\beta\\mu \\cdot 0} + e^{2\\beta\\mu \\cdot 1}$\n$Z_F = 1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}$\n\n### Step 6: Conclude the most probable answer.\nThe standard path integral formalism using complex fields $\\psi, \\psi^*$ describes bosons. Without further specification, this is the default assumption. The problem is well-posed for bosons under the condition $\\mu<0$. Therefore, the bosonic result is the most appropriate answer. The analysis via path integrals, involving the evaluation of $\\text{Det}(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)^{-1}$, confirms this result after proper regularization.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\bf{(1-e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-1}}$.\n\n<<< (1-e^(2*beta*mu))^(-1) >>>"
