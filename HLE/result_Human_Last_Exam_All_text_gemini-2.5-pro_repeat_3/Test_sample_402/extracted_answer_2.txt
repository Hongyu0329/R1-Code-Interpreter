The proposed filtering strategy is a multi-step process. First, generate a reference list of genes known to be highly expressed in the specific cancer cell line used for the co-culture but not in T cells; this is the `potential_contaminants.txt` list. Second, perform a paired differential expression analysis (e.g., using DESeq2 with the design `~donor + condition`) comparing the CAR-IL15 group to the CAR-only group. Third, from the differential expression results, identify all genes that exhibit a strong negative log2 Fold Change (e.g., LFC < -5), as this indicates high abundance in the CAR-only samples and absence in the CAR-IL15 samples. Fourth, create a final filter list by finding the intersection of the `potential_contaminants.txt` list and the list of genes with strong negative LFC. Finally, remove the genes on this final filter list from the original raw count matrix and use this newly cleaned count matrix for all subsequent bioinformatics analyses to ensure that the comparisons reflect true T cell biology.
