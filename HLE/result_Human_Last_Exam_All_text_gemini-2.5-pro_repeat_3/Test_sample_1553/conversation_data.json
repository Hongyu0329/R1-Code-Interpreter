    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\n*   **Book:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Protagonist:** The main character of the novel.\n*   **Action:** Marriage.\n*   **Target Information:** The name of the character the protagonist marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\".**\n*   The protagonist of the novel is Adam Zamoyski, a 21st-century man who is cryogenically frozen and resurrected in the very distant future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the main character's significant relationships.**\n*   Upon his resurrection, Adam Zamoyski's primary guide and companion is a post-human entity. Her name is Angelica.\n*   Their relationship is central to the plot, evolving from guide-and-subject to a deep, personal bond.\n\n**Step 4: Determine if a \"marriage\" takes place and with whom.**\n*   The concept of \"marriage\" in the far-future, post-human setting of the novel is not a traditional ceremony.\n*   Instead, Adam and Angelica decide to undergo a profound unification process. They choose to merge and become a \"dwójnia\" (a dyad), which is a single entity composed of two formerly separate consciousnesses.\n*   This act of becoming a dyad is the novel's thematic and functional equivalent of marriage, representing the deepest possible commitment and union between two beings.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the name of the character.**\n*   The character with whom Adam Zamoyski undergoes this ultimate union is Angelica. Therefore, she is the one he \"marries\" in the context of the story.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **The meaning of \"marriage\":** It's crucial to understand that the term is used loosely. The union in the book is a science-fictional concept of merging consciousnesses, far beyond a traditional human marriage.\n*   **Character Identification:** Ensuring the correct main character (Adam Zamoyski) and his partner (Angelica) is key. There are no other characters who fit this description in the novel.\n*   **Source of information:** The analysis relies on established plot summaries and knowledge of Jacek Dukaj's work.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer is the name of the character Adam Zamoyski unites with.\n\n<<<Angelica>>>"
