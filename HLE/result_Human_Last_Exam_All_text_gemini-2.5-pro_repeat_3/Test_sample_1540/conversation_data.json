    "Answering the question involves two parts: first, devising the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem, and second, calculating the total memory used by its variables.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Problem Understanding**: The core task is to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring the case of the letters. The strings are guaranteed to have the same length, which is between 1 and 100.\n\n2.  **Algorithm Design**:\n    *   Read the two input strings.\n    *   Iterate through the strings from the first character to the last.\n    *   At each position `i`, compare the character from the first string, `s1[i]`, with the character from the second string, `s2[i]`.\n    *   To handle case-insensitivity, convert both characters to a common case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison. The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is suitable for this.\n    *   If `tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(s2[i])`, the first string is smaller. The program should print \"-1\" and terminate.\n    *   If `tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(s2[i])`, the first string is larger. The program should print \"1\" and terminate.\n    *   If the characters are equal, continue to the next position.\n    *   If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are equal. The program should print \"0\".\n\n3.  **Memory Efficiency Analysis**: To write the *most* memory-efficient program, we must minimize the memory allocated for variables.\n\n    *   **Input String Storage**: Since the comparison happens character by character (e.g., `s1[i]` vs `s2[i]`), and we can only read the second string after the first one is fully read from standard input, we must store both strings in memory.\n    *   **Buffer Sizing**: The maximum string length is 100. In C, a string requires an extra byte for the null terminator (`\\0`). Therefore, we need character arrays of size `100 + 1 = 101`.\n        *   `char s1[101];` -> This allocates `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n        *   `char s2[101];` -> This allocates `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n    *   **Loop Index Variable**: We need a variable to keep track of the current position in the strings. The index will range from 0 up to a maximum of 99.\n        *   An `int` (typically 4 bytes) would work, but it's not the most efficient.\n        *   A `short` (typically 2 bytes) would also work.\n        *   The most memory-efficient choice is a data type that is just large enough. An `unsigned char` (1 byte) can store values from 0 to 255, which is sufficient for an index up to 100.\n        *   `unsigned char i;` -> This allocates `1 * sizeof(unsigned char)` = `1 * 1` = **1 byte**.\n    *   **Other Variables**: A common approach might be to use a variable to store the result (e.g., `int result = 0;`). However, to be maximally memory-efficient, we can avoid this. The program can print the result and exit immediately upon finding the first difference. This eliminates the need for any additional variables to store the final result or temporary characters.\n\n### Final Memory Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used for variables in the most efficient implementation is the sum of the memory for each necessary variable.\n\n*   Memory for the first string (`s1`): 101 bytes\n*   Memory for the second string (`s2`): 101 bytes\n*   Memory for the loop index (`i`): 1 byte\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 101 + 1 = **203 bytes**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Null Terminator**: A common mistake is forgetting the extra byte for the null terminator in C strings. A string of length `N` needs an array of size `N+1`.\n*   **Data Type Sizing**: Choosing the smallest appropriate data type for variables like loop counters is key to memory optimization. `unsigned char` is better than `int` for an index that won't exceed 255.\n*   **Standard Library Overhead**: The calculation focuses on variables declared by the programmer. It does not include memory used internally by standard library functions (like `scanf`'s input buffer) or the function call stack overhead, as this is typically outside the scope of such problems.\n*   **Avoiding Temporary Variables**: The comparison `if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(s2[i]))` is performed directly, avoiding the need to declare extra `char` variables to hold the lowercase results.\n\nThe final answer is the total calculated memory in bytes.\n\nm = 203\n\n<<<203>>>"
