    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nFirst, we need to understand the components of the system described.\n1.  **\"Two patches of surface code\"**: This means we have two separate, physically distinct 2D arrays of qubits. The total number of logical qubits in the system will be the sum of the logical qubits encoded on each patch.\n2.  **\"with two holes\"**: This phrase describes the total number of \"holes\" or \"defects\" available in the entire system. A hole is a modification to the surface code lattice that allows for the encoding of additional logical qubits. The ambiguity lies in how these two holes are distributed between the two patches.\n3.  **\"How many logical qubits at most\"**: This implies that different configurations (i.e., different distributions of holes) might yield a different total number of logical qubits. We need to find the configuration that maximizes this total number.\n\n### Step 2: How Logical Qubits are Encoded in a Surface Code Patch\nTo solve the problem, we need a model for how the number of logical qubits on a single patch depends on the number of holes it contains.\n\n*   **A standard patch with no holes (h=0):** A single, planar patch of surface code with properly defined boundaries (e.g., \"smooth\" and \"rough\" boundaries) encodes exactly **one** logical qubit.\n*   **A patch with holes (h > 0):** Holes are topological features. Each hole adds a new boundary to the surface. For a patch that is topologically a disk, adding `h` holes makes it a disk with `h` punctures. A surface with `h` holes can support `h` independent logical qubits based on operators that loop around these holes or connect them.\n*   **Combining these facts:** A crucial point is how the \"base\" qubit from the boundaries interacts with the qubits from the holes.\n    *   If `h=0`, we have `k=1`.\n    *   If `h=1`, we can form a logical qubit with an operator running from the hole to the boundary. This single qubit is all the patch can encode. So, `k=1`.\n    *   If `h=2`, we can form a logical qubit with an operator running between the two holes, and another one with an operator running from one hole to the boundary. This gives `k=2`.\n*   **The Model:** This pattern suggests that for a single patch with `h` holes, the number of logical qubits it can encode is `k = h` if `h > 0`, and `k = 1` if `h = 0`. This can be concisely written as:\n    `k_patch = max(1, h)`\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Different Configurations\nWe have two patches (Patch 1, Patch 2) and a total of two holes to distribute between them. Let `h1` be the number of holes on Patch 1 and `h2` be the number of holes on Patch 2. The constraint is `h1 + h2 = 2`, where `h1` and `h2` must be non-negative integers.\n\nThe total number of logical qubits is `K_total = k1 + k2 = max(1, h1) + max(1, h2)`.\n\nWe need to check all possible distributions of the two holes:\n\n**Configuration A: One hole on each patch.**\n*   Holes distribution: `h1 = 1`, `h2 = 1`.\n*   Qubits on Patch 1: `k1 = max(1, 1) = 1`.\n*   Qubits on Patch 2: `k2 = max(1, 1) = 1`.\n*   Total logical qubits: `K_total = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n**Configuration B: Both holes on one patch.**\n*   Holes distribution: `h1 = 2`, `h2 = 0`. (The case `h1=0, h2=2` is symmetric and gives the same total).\n*   Qubits on Patch 1: `k1 = max(1, 2) = 2`.\n*   Qubits on Patch 2: `k2 = max(1, 0) = 1`.\n*   Total logical qubits: `K_total = 2 + 1 = 3`.\n\n### Step 4: Determining the Final Answer\nBy comparing the total number of logical qubits from all possible configurations, we can find the maximum.\n*   Configuration A yields 2 logical qubits.\n*   Configuration B yields 3 logical qubits.\n\nThe maximum number is 3. This is achieved by placing both holes on one of the patches and leaving the other patch as a standard, hole-free surface code."
