    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to determine the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a specific type of drug container under specific conditions.\n*   **Item:** Single-dose container ampule.\n*   **Action:** Puncture (more accurately, \"opened\" or \"broken\").\n*   **Environment:** Sterile environment (implying an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, such as a laminar airflow workbench).\n*   **Question:** What is the BUD?\n\n**Step 2: Define Key Terms**\n*   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** The date or time after which a preparation shall not be used, stored, or transported. It is determined from the time the preparation is compounded or the container is opened. The BUD's purpose is to ensure the preparation remains sterile and stable.\n*   **Single-Dose Container:** A container holding a quantity of sterile medication intended for parenteral administration as a single dose. Once opened, it cannot be resealed with assurance that sterility has been maintained. These containers do not contain antimicrobial preservatives.\n*   **Ampule:** A specific type of single-dose container made of glass. It is hermetically sealed and must be broken at the neck to access the contents. Once broken, it is an open container and cannot be resealed.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Governing Standard**\nThe standards for sterile compounding in the United States are set by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically in **Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations**. This is the authoritative source for determining BUDs.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Critical Distinction in Container Type**\nUSP <797> makes a crucial distinction between different types of single-dose containers once they are opened.\n*   **Ampule:** An ampule is broken open, leaving the contents fully exposed to the surrounding environment. It is a completely open system.\n*   **Vial:** A vial has a rubber stopper (septum) that is punctured with a needle. The stopper provides a degree of resealing, though not perfectly, after the needle is withdrawn.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the USP <797> Guideline for Ampules**\nAccording to the current USP <797> guidelines:\n*   An opened **ampule** must be used **immediately**.\n*   The contents are withdrawn into a sterile syringe, and any unused portion of the medication in the ampule must be discarded immediately.\n*   An opened ampule cannot be stored for any period, even in an ISO Class 5 environment, because it is an open system highly susceptible to contamination.\n\n**Step 6: Contrast with Other Single-Dose Containers for Clarity (Careful Point)**\nIt is important not to confuse the rule for ampules with the rule for single-dose *vials*.\n*   For a single-dose **vial** (with a rubber stopper), if it is punctured within an ISO Class 5 environment, its contents may be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial puncture to prepare compounded sterile preparations (CSPs).\n*   The user's question specifically names an **ampule**, so the 12-hour rule does not apply. The slightly inaccurate use of the word \"puncture\" in the question should be interpreted as \"opened,\" but the key identifier remains \"ampule.\"\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the specific guidelines in USP <797> for an ampule opened in a sterile environment, there is no storage time permitted. The medication must be withdrawn and used right away. Therefore, the BUD is \"immediate use.\"\n\n<<<Immediate use>>>"
