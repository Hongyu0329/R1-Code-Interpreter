    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes.\n    *   **Process in Focus:** The question asks about the mechanism that allows for two key outcomes after a gene duplication event:\n        1.  **Retention:** Both copies of the gene are kept in the genome over evolutionary time, rather than one being lost.\n        2.  **Divergence:** The two gene copies become different from each other in sequence and/or function.\n    *   **Qualifier:** The question asks for the \"*most likely*\" mechanism, suggesting that while multiple mechanisms might be involved, one is considered more common or a more probable initial step.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a molecular process where a DNA sequence in one gene copy is replaced by the sequence from the other homologous copy. This process tends to make gene duplicates *more similar*, not more different. It works against divergence and is a mechanism of concerted evolution, not divergent evolution. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one of the duplicate genes accumulates deleterious mutations and becomes non-functional (a pseudogene). While this is the most common *fate* for a duplicated gene, it does not explain the *retention* of two functional, diverging genes. It explains the loss of one copy. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that after duplication, one gene copy retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy is free from purifying selection and accumulates mutations. By chance, one of these mutations may result in a brand new, beneficial function. Natural selection would then act to preserve this new gene, leading to the retention of both copies. This explains both retention and divergence. This is a valid and important mechanism.\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model posits that the original, single-copy gene had multiple functions or complex regulation (e.g., it was active in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, degenerative mutations can occur in each copy, but in different subfunctions. For example, copy 1 might lose the ability to function in tissue A but retain its function in tissue B, while copy 2 loses its function in tissue B but retains it in tissue A. Now, both gene copies are required to perform the full range of the original gene's functions. This \"complementation\" ensures both copies are retained by purifying selection. This process also leads to divergence as each copy specializes. This is also a valid and important mechanism.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single ancestral species rapidly diversifies into many new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is a macroevolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism for gene retention. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Compare Plausible Mechanisms (C vs. D):**\n    *   Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models that explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    *   The key to choosing the \"*most likely*\" mechanism lies in considering the probability of the underlying mutational events.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** requires the evolution of a new, beneficial function. Gain-of-function mutations are generally considered to be very rare events.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization** relies on the loss of a part of the gene's original function. Such degenerative mutations are much more common than gain-of-function mutations.\n    *   Because subfunctionalization relies on more frequent mutational events, it provides a more common and passive pathway to preserve both gene copies immediately following duplication. It essentially creates a \"safe harbor\" where both copies are protected from being lost, allowing them a longer evolutionary timeframe to potentially evolve new functions later.\n    *   For this reason, many evolutionary biologists consider subfunctionalization to be a more frequent, and thus \"more likely,\" mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nSubfunctionalization provides a robust mechanism for preserving duplicate genes based on common degenerative mutations, making it a highly probable route for retention and subsequent divergence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
