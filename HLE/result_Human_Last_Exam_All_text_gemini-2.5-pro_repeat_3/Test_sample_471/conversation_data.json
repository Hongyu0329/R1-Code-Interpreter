    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Torus ($T^2$)**: The 2-torus is a compact, connected, orientable surface without boundary. It can be visualized as the surface of a donut.\n*   **Smooth Function**: A function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$).\n*   **Critical Point**: A point $p \\in T^2$ where the derivative of $f$ is zero. In local coordinates $(x,y)$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n\n**2. Basic Existence of Critical Points**\n\n*   Since the torus $T^2$ is a compact space, any continuous function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must attain a global minimum and a global maximum.\n*   These points of global minimum and maximum are necessarily critical points.\n*   Therefore, any smooth function on the torus must have at least **2** critical points (one minimum and one maximum).\n\n**3. Applying Topological Constraints (Morse Theory)**\n\nMorse theory connects the number of critical points of a function on a manifold to the manifold's topology. The main results we need are based on the **Betti numbers** and the **Euler characteristic** of the torus.\n\n*   **Topological Invariants of the Torus ($T^2$)**:\n    *   The Betti numbers of the torus are:\n        *   $b_0 = \\dim H_0(T^2, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (it has one connected component).\n        *   $b_1 = \\dim H_1(T^2, \\mathbb{R}) = 2$ (it has two fundamental non-trivial loops).\n        *   $b_2 = \\dim H_2(T^2, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (it is a closed, orientable surface).\n    *   The Euler characteristic is an alternating sum of the Betti numbers:\n        $\\chi(T^2) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n\n*   **Types of Critical Points**: For a function on a 2-dimensional surface, non-degenerate critical points can be classified by their **index**:\n    *   **Index 0**: Local minimum (Hessian has 2 positive eigenvalues).\n    *   **Index 1**: Saddle point (Hessian has 1 positive and 1 negative eigenvalue).\n    *   **Index 2**: Local maximum (Hessian has 2 negative eigenvalues).\n    Let $c_k$ be the number of critical points of index $k$.\n\n*   **The Morse Inequalities**: For any Morse function (a function with only non-degenerate critical points) on a compact manifold, the number of critical points of each index is bounded below by the corresponding Betti number:\n    *   $c_0 \\ge b_0 = 1$\n    *   $c_1 \\ge b_1 = 2$\n    *   $c_2 \\ge b_2 = 1$\n\n**4. Calculating the Lower Bound**\n\nFrom the Morse inequalities, any Morse function on the torus must have:\n*   At least 1 minimum ($c_0 \\ge 1$).\n*   At least 2 saddle points ($c_1 \\ge 2$).\n*   At least 1 maximum ($c_2 \\ge 1$).\n\nThe total number of critical points is $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. Summing the minimal requirements gives a lower bound on the total number of critical points:\n$C \\ge 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\nThis argument, derived for Morse functions, extends to all smooth functions. A general smooth function can have degenerate critical points, but it can be slightly perturbed to become a Morse function. This perturbation splits degenerate critical points into multiple non-degenerate ones, so the total number of critical points does not decrease. Thus, any smooth function must have at least 4 critical points.\n\n**5. Verifying with the Euler Characteristic**\n\nA fundamental result (the Poincar√©-Hopf theorem applied to the gradient field of $f$) states that for a function with isolated critical points, the alternating sum of the number of critical points of each index equals the Euler characteristic of the manifold:\n$c_0 - c_1 + c_2 = \\chi(T^2) = 0$.\n\nLet's check if the minimal numbers derived from the Morse inequalities ($c_0=1, c_1=2, c_2=1$) are consistent with this formula:\n$1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\nThe values are consistent. This strengthens the conclusion that a minimum of 4 critical points is required.\n\n**6. Constructing an Example to Show the Bound is Sharp**\n\nTo prove that 4 is the minimum, we must show that it is achievable. We need to find an explicit smooth function on the torus that has exactly 4 critical points.\n\n*   Represent the torus as the square $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$ with opposite sides identified. A function on the torus corresponds to a function $f(x, y)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that is periodic with period 1 in both $x$ and $y$.\n*   Consider the function $f(x, y) = \\cos(2\\pi x) + \\cos(2\\pi y)$.\n*   **Find critical points**: Set the gradient to zero.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x) = 0 \\implies x = 0, 1/2$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi y) = 0 \\implies y = 0, 1/2$.\n*   In the domain $[0, 1) \\times [0, 1)$, we have exactly four critical points:\n    1.  $(0, 0)$\n    2.  $(0, 1/2)$\n    3.  $(1/2, 0)$\n    4.  $(1/2, 1/2)$\n*   **Classify the critical points** using the Hessian matrix:\n    $H(f) = \\begin{pmatrix} -4\\pi^2 \\cos(2\\pi x) & 0 \\\\ 0 & -4\\pi^2 \\cos(2\\pi y) \\end{pmatrix}$\n    1.  At $(0, 0)$: $H$ has two negative eigenvalues. This is a **local maximum** (index 2).\n    2.  At $(0, 1/2)$: $H$ has one negative and one positive eigenvalue. This is a **saddle point** (index 1).\n    3.  At $(1/2, 0)$: $H$ has one positive and one negative eigenvalue. This is a **saddle point** (index 1).\n    4.  At $(1/2, 1/2)$: $H$ has two positive eigenvalues. This is a **local minimum** (index 0).\n\nThis function has $c_0=1$, $c_1=2$, and $c_2=1$, for a total of $1+2+1=4$ critical points.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe theoretical lower bound derived from Morse theory is 4. The construction of the function $f(x, y) = \\cos(2\\pi x) + \\cos(2\\pi y)$ shows that this lower bound can be achieved. Therefore, the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on the 2-torus is 4."
