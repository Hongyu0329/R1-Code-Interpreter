Yes, changing the structure to incorporate a PEG group is a very effective and standard strategy to increase the aqueous solubility of a molecule and will likely solve the precipitation problem. The precipitation is caused by the low water solubility of the probe, which is due to its large hydrophobic regions (the thioxanthone core and the hexyl chain). Replacing a hydrophobic part of the molecule with a highly hydrophilic PEG chain will significantly increase the overall polarity and water solubility of the probe, allowing it to remain dissolved at the desired concentration.
