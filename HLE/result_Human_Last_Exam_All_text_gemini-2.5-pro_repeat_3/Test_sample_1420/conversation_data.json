    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n*   **Scaling Exponent α:** In the study of critical phenomena, the specific heat ($C$) of a system near its critical temperature ($T_c$) is described by a power law: $C \\propto |T - T_c|^{-\\alpha}$. The exponent $\\alpha$ is a universal critical exponent, meaning it is the same for a wide class of systems.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** This is the spatial dimension above which the predictions of mean-field theory for critical exponents become exact. For the universality class of the Ising model, XY model, and Heisenberg model (or the general $n$-vector model), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$. Below this dimension, fluctuations become important and modify the exponents from their mean-field values.\n*   **Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion:** This is a powerful technique within the renormalization group framework to calculate critical exponents for dimensions $d$ slightly below the upper critical dimension $d_c$. It involves defining a small parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$ and calculating the exponents as a power series in $\\epsilon$.\n\n**2. Define the Parameters for the Problem**\n*   **Spatial Dimension (d):** The problem specifies $d=3$.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** For the relevant universality classes (like the Ising model), we have $d_c = 4$.\n*   **Epsilon ($\\epsilon$):** Using the definition $\\epsilon = d_c - d$, we get $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$. Although $\\epsilon=1$ is not infinitesimally small, the $\\epsilon$-expansion is often used for $d=3$ by calculating the result as a function of $\\epsilon$ and then setting $\\epsilon=1$. This provides a first-order approximation.\n\n**3. State the General Formula for α**\nThe $\\epsilon$-expansion provides a formula for the critical exponents as a series in $\\epsilon$. For the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ in the $n$-vector model (where $n$ is the number of components of the order parameter), the result to the first order in $\\epsilon$ is:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)} \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**4. Identify the Universality Class (Value of n)**\nThe problem does not specify the system (e.g., Ising magnet, liquid-vapor transition, superfluid helium). However, the most fundamental and commonly referenced case is the **Ising universality class**, which describes systems with a scalar order parameter (up/down spins, liquid/gas density).\n*   For the Ising model, the order parameter has one component, so we set **n=1**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Value of α**\nNow, we substitute the values of $n$ and $\\epsilon$ into the first-order formula.\n*   $n = 1$\n*   $\\epsilon = 1$\n\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times (1)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{3}{2(9)}$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{3}{18}$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Choice of `n`:** The result depends on the number of components of the order parameter, $n$. Without explicit information, assuming the Ising model ($n=1$) is the standard convention. For the XY model ($n=2$), $\\alpha = \\frac{2}{20}\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{10}\\epsilon$. For the Heisenberg model ($n=3$), $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{22}\\epsilon$.\n*   **Approximation Level:** This calculation is only to the first order in $\\epsilon$. Higher-order corrections ($O(\\epsilon^2)$, etc.) exist and provide more accurate results. However, the question asks for the result from the (standard, first-order) $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n*   **Validity of $\\epsilon=1$:** The expansion is formally derived for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Setting $\\epsilon=1$ is a standard extrapolation that gives a reasonable, though not exact, estimate for three dimensions. The result $\\alpha \\approx 1/6 \\approx 0.167$ is a well-known first-order approximation, compared to the more accurate value from advanced calculations and experiments which is closer to $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat in the $n$-vector model near the upper critical dimension $d_c=4$ is given to first order by $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$. For the specified spatial dimension $d=3$, we have $\\epsilon = 4-3=1$. Assuming the standard Ising universality class ($n=1$), the calculation yields $\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1 = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
