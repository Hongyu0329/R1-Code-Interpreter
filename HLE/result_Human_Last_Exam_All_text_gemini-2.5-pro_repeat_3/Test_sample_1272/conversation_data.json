    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the period of the Lam Sơn uprising (1418–1427), led by the future Vietnamese emperor Lê Lợi against the rule of the Chinese Ming Dynasty. Mu Sheng (沐晟) was one of the primary Ming generals tasked with suppressing this rebellion.\n\n2.  **Trace Mu Sheng's Campaigns in Vietnam:** Mu Sheng was involved in several campaigns. Initially, the Ming forces were largely successful. However, as Lê Lợi's forces grew stronger and adapted their tactics, the tide began to turn.\n\n3.  **Search for a \"Major Defeat\":** We need to find the first battle that qualifies as a \"major defeat\" for an army personally commanded by Mu Sheng. This implies a significant loss of troops, the failure of a strategic objective, and a forced retreat of the general himself.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Key Battle:** In 1425, Lê Lợi's forces had successfully expanded their operations from their base in Thanh Hóa south into the populous and resource-rich region of Nghệ An. They laid siege to the Nghệ An citadel, the main Ming stronghold in the area. In response, the Ming court dispatched General Mu Sheng with a large relief army of 50,000 troops from Yunnan to break the siege.\n\n5.  **The Ambush at Khả Lưu:** As Mu Sheng's army marched through the mountainous terrain of western Nghệ An, Vietnamese commanders Đinh Lễ and Nguyễn Xí laid a trap. They ambushed the Ming army at the **Khả Lưu Pass**. The surprise attack in difficult terrain caused chaos in the Ming ranks.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Outcome:** The Battle of Khả Lưu was a decisive victory for the Lam Sơn forces. Mu Sheng's army was routed, and he was forced to abandon his objective of relieving the Nghệ An citadel. He narrowly escaped with his life and fled with the remnants of his army back to Đông Quan (modern-day Hanoi).\n\n7.  **Confirming \"First Major Defeat\":** While there were earlier skirmishes and losses for the Ming, the Battle of Khả Lưu in 1425 was the first time a large relief army, personally led by a top general like Mu Sheng, was comprehensively defeated in a major engagement. It was a huge strategic and psychological blow to the Ming war effort and is considered a major turning point in the war. Later defeats, such as Tốt Động–Chúc Động (1426) and Chi Lăng–Xương Giang (1427), were even more catastrophic for the Ming, but Khả Lưu was Mu Sheng's first personal, large-scale disaster.\n\n8.  **Identify the Modern Location:** The historical Khả Lưu Pass is located in what is today **Nghệ An Province** in the North Central Coast region of Vietnam.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing \"major defeat\":** It is important to differentiate this from smaller skirmishes or defeats of subordinate commanders. The defeat at Khả Lưu involved a large army under Mu Sheng's direct command with a clear strategic goal that failed catastrophically.\n*   **Chronology:** This battle in 1425 occurred before other famous Ming defeats like Tốt Động–Chúc Động (1426) and Chi Lăng–Xương Giang (1427), solidifying its status as his *first* major defeat.\n*   **Location Mapping:** The historical battle site of Khả Lưu must be correctly mapped to its corresponding modern-day province.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred at the Battle of Khả Lưu in 1425, which took place in the territory of modern-day Nghệ An Province.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
