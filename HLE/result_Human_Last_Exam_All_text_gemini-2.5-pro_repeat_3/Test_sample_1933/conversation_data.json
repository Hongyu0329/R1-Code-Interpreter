    "An analysis of the question is as follows, with a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the components of the question:**\n\n*   **Schema S:** The schema consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A structure (or database instance) over this schema consists of a domain of elements $U$ and an interpretation for each predicate, which is a subset of the domain, i.e., $P_i^I \\subseteq U$.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$:** This is a fragment of first-order logic. The formulas in this language are built using:\n    *   Atomic formulas: $P_i(x)$, where $x$ is a variable.\n    *   Connectives: Conjunction ($\\land$).\n    *   Quantifiers: Existential quantifier ($\\exists$).\n    *   Constants: True ($\\top$) and False ($\\bot$).\n    *   Notably, negation ($\\lnot$), disjunction ($\\lor$), the universal quantifier ($\\forall$), and equality are not allowed.\n*   **VC Dimension:** The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the expressive power of a set of classifiers. In this context, the \"classifiers\" are the concepts defined by the formulas of our logic.\n    *   A formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable defines a concept, which is the set of elements in the domain that satisfy the formula.\n    *   A set of points $C = \\{c_1, \\dots, c_d\\}$ from the domain is said to be **shattered** by the logic if for every possible subset $C' \\subseteq C$, there exists a formula $\\phi(x)$ in the logic such that the set defined by $\\phi(x)$ intersected with $C$ is exactly $C'$.\n    *   The VC dimension of the logic is the size of the largest set of points that can be shattered. To show the VC dimension is $d$, we must:\n        1.  Show that there exists *some* structure (a domain and an interpretation of predicates) and a set of $d$ points within it that can be shattered. (This proves VC-dim $\\ge d$).\n        2.  Show that it's impossible to shatter *any* set of $d+1$ points in *any* structure. (This proves VC-dim $\\le d$).\n\n**2. Characterize the expressive power of the logic**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. A general formula in this logic can be written in the form:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m (\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m))$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. We can separate the atomic formulas involving the free variable $x$ from those that do not:\n$\\psi \\equiv \\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(y_1, \\dots, y_m)$\nSo, the formula becomes:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m (\\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(y_1, \\dots, y_m))$\nSince $\\psi_x(x)$ does not contain any of the quantified variables $y_i$, we can pull it out of the quantifier:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\psi_x(x) \\land (\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(y_1, \\dots, y_m))$\nThe part $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(y_1, \\dots, y_m)$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). For any given structure, this sentence is either true or false.\n*   If the sentence is true, $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\psi_x(x)$.\n*   If the sentence is false, $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\psi_x(x) \\land \\bot$, which is $\\bot$.\n\nThe term $\\psi_x(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving only $x$, so it is of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. If $I$ is the empty set, this conjunction is equivalent to $\\top$.\n\nTherefore, on any given structure, any concept definable by a formula in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is equivalent to a concept defined by one of the following simpler formulas:\n1.  $\\bot$ (the empty set).\n2.  $\\top$ (the entire domain).\n3.  $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for a non-empty index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n**3. Establish an Upper Bound for the VC Dimension**\n\nThe number of distinct non-empty index sets $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ is $2^4 - 1 = 15$.\nSo, on any structure, the total number of concepts we can possibly define is at most:\n1 (from $\\bot$) + 1 (from $\\top$) + 15 (from the non-empty conjunctions) = 17.\n\nFor a set of size $d$ to be shattered, we must be able to define all $2^d$ of its subsets. This means the number of definable concepts must be at least $2^d$.\nSo, we must have $2^d \\le 17$.\nThe largest integer $d$ satisfying this inequality is $d=4$ (since $2^4 = 16 \\le 17$ and $2^5 = 32 > 17$).\nThus, the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n**4. Establish a Lower Bound for the VC Dimension**\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that it is possible to shatter a set of 4 points. This requires constructing a specific structure (domain and predicate interpretations) where this is possible.\n\n*   **Domain:** Let the domain be a set of 4 points, $C = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$.\n*   **Predicate Interpretations:** We define the 4 unary predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ on this domain. A clever choice is to define each predicate to include all points *except* one:\n    *   $P_1 = C \\setminus \\{c_1\\} = \\{c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$\n    *   $P_2 = C \\setminus \\{c_2\\} = \\{c_1, c_3, c_4\\}$\n    *   $P_3 = C \\setminus \\{c_3\\} = \\{c_1, c_2, c_4\\}$\n    *   $P_4 = C \\setminus \\{c_4\\} = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3\\}$\n\n*   **Shattering:** Now we must show that for any subset $C' \\subseteq C$, we can find a formula $\\phi(x)$ in our logic that defines it.\n    Let $C' \\subseteq C$ be an arbitrary target subset. Let $J \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ be the set of indices of the points that are **not** in $C'$. That is, $J = \\{j \\mid c_j \\notin C'\\}$.\n\n    Consider the formula $\\phi_{J}(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_j(x)$. Let's see what set this formula defines:\n    The set defined is $\\bigcap_{j \\in J} P_j = \\bigcap_{j \\in J} (C \\setminus \\{c_j\\}) = C \\setminus \\bigcup_{j \\in J} \\{c_j\\}$.\n    By our definition of $J$, the set $\\bigcup_{j \\in J} \\{c_j\\}$ is exactly the complement of our target set $C'$ within $C$.\n    So, the formula defines the set $C \\setminus (C \\setminus C') = C'$.\n\n    Let's check this for all cases:\n    *   If we want to define $C' = C$, then no points are excluded, so $J = \\emptyset$. The formula is the empty conjunction, which is $\\top$, and correctly defines the whole set $C$.\n    *   If we want to define $C' = \\{c_1, c_2\\}$, then $c_3$ and $c_4$ are excluded, so $J=\\{3, 4\\}$. The formula is $P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$. This defines the set $P_3 \\cap P_4 = \\{c_1, c_2, c_4\\} \\cap \\{c_1, c_2, c_3\\} = \\{c_1, c_2\\}$, which is exactly $C'$.\n    *   If we want to define $C' = \\emptyset$, then all points are excluded, so $J=\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The formula is $P_1(x) \\land P_2(x) \\land P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$, which defines the set $P_1 \\cap P_2 \\cap P_3 \\cap P_4 = \\emptyset$.\n\n    Since we can construct a formula for every one of the $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $C$, the set $C$ is shattered.\n    This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nFrom Step 3, we have VC-dim $\\le 4$.\nFrom Step 4, we have VC-dim $\\ge 4$.\nTherefore, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with 4 unary predicates is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
