    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the atoms in the molecule.**\nThe chemical formula for toluene is C7H8.\n*   This means there are 7 Carbon (C) atoms.\n*   This means there are 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The name tells us how the atomic orbitals (AOs) are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). We need to analyze it for each type of atom in the molecule (Carbon and Hydrogen).\n\n*   **The hyphen (-)** separates the description of the core orbitals from the valence orbitals.\n*   **The number before the hyphen (6)** describes the core orbitals. It means each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **The numbers after the hyphen (31)** describe the valence orbitals. This indicates a \"split valence\" shell, meaning each valence atomic orbital is represented by two basis functions.\n    *   The first number **(3)** means the \"inner\" part of the valence shell is represented by one CGF composed of 3 PGFs.\n    *   The second number **(1)** means the \"outer\" part of the valence shell is represented by one CGF composed of 1 PGF (i.e., it's a single uncontracted Gaussian).\n*   **The 'G'** stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions for each Hydrogen (H) atom.**\n*   A Hydrogen atom has one electron in the 1s orbital. It has **no core electrons**, only a valence electron.\n*   Therefore, only the \"31\" part of the basis set name applies.\n*   The 1s valence orbital is split into two functions:\n    1.  An \"inner\" 1s' function, which is 1 CGF (from 3 PGFs).\n    2.  An \"outer\" 1s'' function, which is 1 CGF (from 1 PGF).\n*   **Total CGFs per H atom = 1 + 1 = 2.**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions for each Carbon (C) atom.**\n*   A Carbon atom has electrons in the 1s (core) and 2s, 2p (valence) orbitals.\n*   **Core Orbitals (1s):**\n    *   This is described by the \"6\" in 6-31G.\n    *   The 1s core orbital is represented by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):**\n    *   These are described by the \"31\" split. This split applies to all valence orbitals (one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals: 2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    *   **Inner Valence (\"3\"):** This part consists of one function for the 2s orbital and three functions for the 2p orbitals.\n        *   1 s-type CGF + 3 p-type CGFs = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (\"1\"):** This part also consists of one function for the 2s orbital and three functions for the 2p orbitals.\n        *   1 s-type CGF + 3 p-type CGFs = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total CGFs per C atom** = (Core CGFs) + (Inner Valence CGFs) + (Outer Valence CGFs) = 1 + 4 + 4 = **9**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire toluene (C7H8) molecule.**\n*   Total CGFs = (Number of C atoms × CGFs per C) + (Number of H atoms × CGFs per H)\n*   Total CGFs = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n*   Total CGFs = 63 + 16\n*   Total CGFs = 79\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinguish Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for the number of **contracted** functions, not the total number of primitive Gaussians.\n2.  **Atom Count:** Ensure the correct number of each atom type from the molecular formula (7 Carbons, 8 Hydrogens) is used.\n3.  **Core vs. Valence:** Correctly identify which electrons are core (1s for Carbon) and which are valence (2s, 2p for Carbon; 1s for Hydrogen). Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n4.  **p-Orbitals:** Remember that for elements in the second row and beyond, the \"p\" shell consists of three orbitals (px, py, pz). Therefore, a single \"p\" description in the basis set notation (like in the inner or outer valence shell) contributes 3 basis functions.\n5.  **Split Valence Application:** The split (e.g., \"31\") applies to all orbitals within the valence shell (both s and p types).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis:\n*   Each of the 7 Carbon atoms contributes 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n*   Each of the 8 Hydrogen atoms contributes 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n*   Total = (7 * 9) + (8 * 2) = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
