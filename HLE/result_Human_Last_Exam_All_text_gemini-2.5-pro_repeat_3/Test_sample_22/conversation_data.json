    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP)**\n\n*   SNP heritability is a population parameter.\n*   It represents the proportion of the total variation in a trait (phenotypic variance) that can be explained by the additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are typically measured on a genotyping array.\n*   Crucially, it is a theoretical concept representing the *maximum possible* variance that could be explained if we knew the *true* causal effect of every single SNP and could combine them in a perfect linear model. It is the theoretical ceiling of prediction using these SNPs.\n\n**Step 2: Define a Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability**\n\n*   A polygenic score is a practical tool, not a theoretical limit.\n*   It is a single score calculated for an individual by summing up the effects of many genetic variants (SNPs).\n*   The \"effects\" (weights) used in this sum are not the true, unknown effects. Instead, they are *estimates* derived from a real-world study, typically a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by how well it correlates with the actual trait in a *new, independent* group of people. This is often quantified as R², which is the proportion of variance in the trait that the PGS can explain.\n\n**Step 3: Compare SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability**\n\nThe core of the question is the relationship between the theoretical maximum (h²_SNP) and the practical result (PGS R²). The predictive ability of a PGS is lower than SNP heritability for several key reasons:\n\n1.  **Imperfect Effect Size Estimates:** The weights used to build a PGS are derived from a GWAS with a finite sample size. This means the estimated effects have statistical error and are not the true effects. This \"noise\" in the weights directly reduces the accuracy of the resulting score. The larger the GWAS, the better the estimates and the better the PGS, but the estimates will never be perfectly accurate.\n2.  **Incomplete Model of Genetic Architecture:** PGS construction methods make simplifying assumptions. For example, the popular \"clumping and thresholding\" method only includes SNPs that pass a certain statistical significance threshold, thereby ignoring many true causal variants of small effect. More advanced methods like LDpred try to model all SNPs, but they still rely on assumptions about the underlying genetic architecture that may not be perfectly correct.\n3.  **Differences Between Study Populations:** A PGS is typically developed in one set of individuals (the \"discovery\" or \"training\" sample) and tested in another (the \"target\" sample). If there are differences in genetic ancestry, Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) patterns, or environmental factors between these groups, the predictive ability of the score will decrease.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion on the \"Necessarily Lower\" Clause**\n\n*   SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the glass ceiling for prediction using a linear combination of SNPs.\n*   A polygenic score (PGS) is an attempt to build a predictor that reaches this ceiling.\n*   Due to the unavoidable real-world limitations described in Step 3 (especially the finite sample size of the discovery GWAS), any practical PGS will be an imperfect estimate of the ideal, true predictor.\n*   An imperfect predictor will, by definition, explain less variance than the perfect, theoretical one. The only way for the PGS predictive ability to equal the SNP heritability would be under impossible conditions, such as having a discovery GWAS of infinite size.\n*   Therefore, the predictive ability of a polygenic score is **necessarily** lower than the SNP heritability.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{True}$."
