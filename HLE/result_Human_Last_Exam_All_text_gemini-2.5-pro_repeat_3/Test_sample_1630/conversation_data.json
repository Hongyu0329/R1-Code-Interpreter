    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem Mathematically\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point of $h(x)$ is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$.\nWe are given:\n1.  $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n2.  $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n3.  $f'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$. This means $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n4.  $g'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$. This means $g(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Degree of the Fixed-Point Polynomial\nLet's analyze the equation we need to solve: $f(g(x)) = x$.\nThis is equivalent to finding the roots of the polynomial $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\n*   Since $f(x)$ has degree 3 and $g(x)$ has degree 3, the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ has a degree equal to the product of their degrees, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The polynomial $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is also of degree 9, because subtracting $x$ does not change the leading term of degree 9.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 has at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the number of fixed points cannot exceed 9.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Conditions on the Derivatives\nThe conditions $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ have implications for the coefficients of the polynomials.\n*   Let $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$. Then $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$. For $f'(x)$ to be always positive, the parabola it represents must open upwards ($3a > 0 \\implies a>0$) and have no real roots (discriminant must be negative: $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 - 3ac < 0$).\n*   Similarly, if $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, then $p>0$ and $q^2 - 3pr < 0$.\n*   The leading coefficient of $h(x) = f(g(x))$ will be $ap^3$. Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, the leading coefficient $ap^3$ is positive.\n*   This means the polynomial $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ also has a positive leading coefficient. Consequently, as $x \\to \\infty$, $H(x) \\to \\infty$, and as $x \\to -\\infty$, $H(x) \\to -\\infty$.\n\n### Step 4: Use Rolle's Theorem and Analyze the Derivative of H(x)\nTo have the maximum number of roots (9), the polynomial $H(x)$ must change direction as many times as possible. Between any two roots of $H(x)$, there must be a root of its derivative, $H'(x)$. If $H(x)$ has 9 distinct real roots, then $H'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $H(x)$:\n$H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\n\nNow, let's determine the degree of $H'(x)$:\n*   $g(x)$ is degree 3.\n*   $f'(x)$ is degree 2. So, $f'(g(x))$ is a composition of a degree-2 polynomial and a degree-3 polynomial, making it a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   The product $f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   Therefore, $H'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$ is a polynomial of degree 8.\n\nA polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots. This is consistent with the requirement for $H(x)$ to have 9 real roots.\n\n### Step 5: Check if 9 Roots is an Achievable Maximum\nTo show that 9 is the maximum, we need to argue that a configuration leading to 9 roots is possible.\n\n1.  **Roots of H'(x):** We need $H'(x) = 0$ to have 8 distinct real roots. This is the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$. Let $K(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$. $K(x)$ is a degree-8 polynomial with a positive leading coefficient (since the leading coefficients of $f'$ and $g'$ are positive). This means $\\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty} K(x) = +\\infty$. For the equation $K(x) = 1$ to have 8 distinct real roots, the graph of $K(x)$ must intersect the line $y=1$ eight times. This is possible if $K(x)$ has 7 local extrema (4 minima and 3 maxima), with the local minima having values less than 1 and the local maxima having values greater than 1.\n    *Careful point:* We must also satisfy $K(x) > 0$, since $f'>0$ and $g'>0$. This means the local minima must be in the interval $(0, 1)$. Given the number of free parameters in the coefficients of $f$ and $g$, such a polynomial $K(x)$ can be constructed.\n\n2.  **Roots of H(x):** If $H'(x)$ has 8 distinct real roots, say $r_1 < r_2 < \\dots < r_8$, these are the locations of the local extrema of $H(x)$.\n    *   Since $H(x)$ is a degree 9 polynomial with a positive leading coefficient, we know $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} H(x) = -\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} H(x) = \\infty$.\n    *   The derivative $H'(x)$ is a degree 8 polynomial with a positive leading coefficient. Thus, for $x<r_1$, $H'(x)>0$, and the sign of $H'(x)$ alternates in the intervals between the roots. This means $H(x)$ is increasing on $(-\\infty, r_1)$, decreasing on $(r_1, r_2)$, increasing on $(r_2, r_3)$, and so on.\n    *   This implies that the extrema of $H(x)$ are:\n        *   $H(r_1)$: local maximum\n        *   $H(r_2)$: local minimum\n        *   $H(r_3)$: local maximum\n        *   ...\n        *   $H(r_8)$: local minimum\n    *   To get 9 roots for $H(x)=0$, the values of these extrema must alternate in sign.\n        *   For a root in $(-\\infty, r_1)$, we need $H(r_1) > 0$.\n        *   For a root in $(r_1, r_2)$, we need $H(r_2) < 0$.\n        *   For a root in $(r_2, r_3)$, we need $H(r_3) > 0$.\n        *   ...\n        *   For a root in $(r_7, r_8)$, we need $H(r_8) < 0$.\n        *   Finally, since $H(r_8) < 0$ and $H(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$, there must be a ninth root in $(r_8, \\infty)$.\n    *   *Careful point:* Is it possible to make the extrema have these signs? The constant term of $f(x)$ (let's call it $d$) becomes an additive constant in $H(x)$. By changing $d$, we can shift the entire graph of $H(x)$ vertically without changing its shape or the location of its extrema. Therefore, we can adjust this constant to position the graph such that the extrema values alternate in sign as required.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real roots of a polynomial of degree 9. Algebraically, this maximum is 9. The analysis of the derivatives shows that the conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ do not preclude the existence of the 8 critical points necessary for 9 roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
