    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify all historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*.**\n\nThe first task is to comb through Homer's epic to find all references to actual, physical mountains. The gods and heroes in the *Iliad* often interact with the landscape, using mountains as vantage points or as landmarks. The key mountains mentioned are:\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The most prominent mountain, serving as the home of the Olympian gods. It is mentioned countless times throughout the epic.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain range near Troy is a crucial location. Zeus frequently sits on its highest peak, Gargarus, to watch the Trojan War unfold.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Peak: Fengari):** The sea god Poseidon watches the battle from the highest peak of the island of Samothrace, from which he can see both Mount Ida and the city of Troy.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Mentioned during Hera's journey in Book 14. She travels from Olympus across the lands of Thrace, passing over Mount Athos before reaching the island of Lemnos.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly, Greece, is mentioned as the source of the ash wood used to make the spear of Achilles, which was a gift from the centaur Chiron.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Located in Lydia (modern-day Turkey), this mountain is mentioned as a place from which Zeus observes events.\n\n**Step 2: Find the modern elevations of these mountains.**\n\nTo determine which mountain is the tallest after Olympus, we need to find their current, accepted elevations.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus (Greece):** The highest peak, Mytikas, is **2,918 meters** (9,573 feet).\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Modern name: Bozdağ, Turkey):** The highest peak is **2,159 meters** (7,083 feet).\n*   **Mount Athos (Greece):** The highest peak is **2,033 meters** (6,670 feet).\n*   **Mount Ida (Modern name: Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** The highest peak is **1,774 meters** (5,820 feet).\n*   **Mount Pelion (Greece):** The highest peak is **1,624 meters** (5,328 feet).\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Peak: Fengari, Greece):** The highest peak is **1,611 meters** (5,285 feet).\n\n**Step 3: Rank the mountains by height and determine the second tallest.**\n\nNow we can create a ranked list of the mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* from tallest to shortest.\n\n1.  **Mount Olympus** (2,918 m)\n2.  **Mount Tmolus** (2,159 m)\n3.  **Mount Athos** (2,033 m)\n4.  **Mount Ida** (1,774 m)\n5.  **Mount Pelion** (1,624 m)\n6.  **Mount Samothrace** (1,611 m)\n\nThe question asks for the tallest historical mountain mentioned *after* Mount Olympus. Based on the ranking, the second mountain on the list is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Source Text Specificity:** The analysis is strictly limited to the *Iliad*. Other mountains prominent in Greek mythology, such as Mount Parnassus or Mount Ossa (famous for being piled on Pelion in the *Odyssey*), are not mentioned in the *Iliad* and are therefore excluded.\n2.  **Identifying Historical Locations:** All the mountains listed are real, geographical places that can be identified today. This fulfills the \"historical mountain\" part of the question.\n3.  **Distinguishing Multiple Mountains of the Same Name:** It is important to identify the correct Mount Ida. The *Iliad* refers to the one near Troy (in modern Turkey), not the taller one on the island of Crete which is associated with Zeus's birth.\n4.  **Using Modern Data for Ranking:** While the ancient Greeks had a sense of which mountains were large, they did not have precise elevation data. The question is answered using modern, accurate measurements to determine the definitive ranking.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter compiling a list of all historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* and ranking them by their modern-day elevation, Mount Olympus is the tallest. The second tallest is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
