    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nThe question asks for the common name of a specific mathematical object used in the field of nuclear criticality. Let's break down the key components:\n\n1.  **The Function:** The starting point is the \"generalized pair correlation function\".\n    *   In the context of nuclear physics and neutron transport, this function describes the correlation between the presence of neutrons at two different points in space-time.\n    *   Mathematically, if we consider the neutron number density $n(\\vec{r}, t)$, the correlation function is related to the covariance of the fluctuations in this density: $C(\\vec{r}_1, t_1; \\vec{r}_2, t_2) = \\langle \\delta n(\\vec{r}_1, t_1) \\delta n(\\vec{r}_2, t_2) \\rangle$, where $\\delta n = n - \\langle n \\rangle$ is the fluctuation around the mean density.\n    *   For a statistically stationary and homogeneous system, this function depends only on the separation in space $(\\vec{R} = \\vec{r}_2 - \\vec{r}_1)$ and time $(\\tau = t_2 - t_1)$. We can write it as $C(\\vec{R}, \\tau)$.\n\n2.  **The Transformation:** The function undergoes a \"space-time, double Fourier transform\".\n    *   This means we apply a Fourier transform with respect to both the spatial variable ($\\vec{R}$) and the temporal variable ($\\tau$).\n    *   The spatial transform converts the position vector $\\vec{R}$ into a wavevector $\\vec{k}$.\n    *   The temporal transform converts the time difference $\\tau$ into an angular frequency $\\omega$.\n    *   The mathematical operation looks like this:\n        $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\int d^3R \\ e^{-i(\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{R} - \\omega \\tau)} C(\\vec{R}, \\tau)$\n\n3.  **The Context:** The name for this transformed function is specific to the \"nuclear criticality community\".\n    *   This field deals with the physics of neutron chains reactions in fissile materials, reactor noise analysis, and criticality safety. The terminology used here is often very specific, though it sometimes borrows from other areas of physics like statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis and Identification of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Analogy to other fields:** The mathematical form of this transform is identical to one used in condensed matter physics. There, experimental techniques like inelastic neutron scattering (where neutrons are used as a probe) are used to measure the properties of materials (like solids or liquids). The quantity measured in those experiments, which is the double Fourier transform of the particle density correlation function, is called the **Dynamic Structure Factor**, denoted $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$.\n\n2.  **Terminology in Nuclear Criticality:** We must verify if the nuclear community uses the same name for the analogous quantity describing the neutron population *within* a multiplying system (like a nuclear reactor).\n    *   Research into reactor noise analysis and space-dependent kinetics confirms that the term was indeed adopted. The study of the space-time fluctuations of the neutron field is a key part of advanced noise analysis.\n    *   This transformed function, $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$, describes how neutron density fluctuations of a certain wavelength (related to $1/|\\vec{k}|$) and frequency ($\\omega$) are correlated and propagate through the system. It contains fundamental information about the neutronic properties of the medium.\n\n3.  **Distinguishing from similar concepts:** It is crucial not to confuse the target quantity with other related terms used in noise analysis:\n    *   **Power Spectral Density (PSD):** This is typically a Fourier transform with respect to *time only* of a signal's auto-correlation function. For a detector at a single point, it would be $P(\\omega)$.\n    *   **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD):** This is the time-only Fourier transform of the cross-correlation function between signals from two different detectors. It's a function of the detector locations and frequency, $P(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2, \\omega)$.\n    *   **Static Structure Factor:** This is the integral of the Dynamic Structure Factor over all frequencies, $S(\\vec{k}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int S(\\vec{k}, \\omega) d\\omega$. It describes only the spatial correlations.\n\nThe question explicitly asks for the *space-time double Fourier transform*, which uniquely points to the quantity that depends on both wavevector $\\vec{k}$ and frequency $\\omega$.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the function, the transformation, and the specific context, the standard name for the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function of the neutron population is the **Dynamic Structure Factor**. To be more specific in the nuclear context, it is sometimes called the \"Neutronic Dynamic Structure Factor\" to distinguish it from the one used in materials science, but \"Dynamic Structure Factor\" is the common and correct term.\n\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"
