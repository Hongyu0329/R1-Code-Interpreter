    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\nThis line is from Plautus and is an example of a polymetric *canticum*, which involves complex and varied meters. The most likely analysis reveals it to be a form of pentameter (a 5-foot line), rather than the more common iambic senarius (6-foot line). The scansion requires an understanding of Plautine metrical phenomena, especially *brevis brevians* (iambic shortening).\n\n**Step 1: Syllabification**\nFirst, we break the line into its component syllables:\n`et | ti | bi | be | ne | es | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\n\n**Step 2: Determining Base Syllable Quantities**\nNext, we determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on vowel length and position.\n*   `et`: Long by position (closed syllable, ending in a consonant). **L**\n*   `ti-bi`: Both vowels are naturally short. **S S**\n*   `be-ne`: Both vowels are naturally short. **S S**\n*   `es-se`: The first syllable `es-` is long by position (vowel 'e' is followed by two consonants 'ss'). The second syllable `-se` is short. **L S**\n*   `so-li`: From `sōlus, sōlī`. Both the 'o' and the 'i' are naturally long. **L L**\n*   `quom`: Long by position (closed syllable, archaic form of `cum`). **L**\n*   `si-bi`: Both vowels are naturally short. **S S**\n*   `sit`: Long by position (closed syllable). **L**\n*   `ma-le`: From `mălus`. The 'a' is short, and the final 'e' of the adverb is short. **S S**\n\nThe sequence of base quantities is: `L S S S S L S L L L S S L S S`\n\n**Step 3: Applying Iambic Shortening (Brevis Brevians)**\nPlautine meter often uses iambic shortening, where a long syllable following a short one (an iambic sequence, S L) can be scanned as short (S S).\n*   Look for an S L sequence. We find one across the word boundary between `esse` and `soli`: `...se so...`.\n*   The syllable `-se` is short (S) and `so-` is long (L).\n*   Applying *brevis brevians*, the long `so-` is shortened to `sŏ-` (S).\n*   This changes the quantity of `soli` from L L to **S L**.\n\nThe new sequence of quantities is: `L S S S S L S **S L** L S S L S S`\n\n**Step 4: Parsing into Metrical Feet**\nNow, we can group this sequence of long and short syllables into metrical feet.\n*   **Foot 1:** `et tibi` -> **L S S** (This is a Dactyl).\n*   **Foot 2:** `bene es-` -> The syllables are `be-`(S), `ne-`(S), `es-`(L). This forms **S S L** (an Anapest).\n*   **Foot 3:** `-se soli` -> The syllables are `-se`(S), `sŏ-`(S, due to shortening), `lī`(L). This forms **S S L** (an Anapest).\n*   **Foot 4:** `quom sibi` -> `quom`(L), `si-`(S), `bi`(S). This forms **L S S** (a Dactyl).\n*   **Foot 5:** `sit male` -> `sit`(L), `ma-`(S), `le`(S). This forms **L S S** (a Dactyl).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Plautine Meter:** Do not assume a simple, rigid meter. Plautus uses many substitutions and metrical licenses.\n2.  **Iambic Shortening:** This is crucial. Identifying the S L sequence (`...se so...`) and applying the rule (`S L` -> `S S`) is the key to making the line scan regularly.\n3.  **Foot Division:** The division must account for all syllables in the line. This parsing results in a 5-foot line, which is consistent and rhythmically balanced (Dactyl, Anapest, Anapest, Dactyl, Dactyl).\n\n**Final Answer Construction:**\nCombining the feet with spaces in between gives the final scansion.\n\nFoot 1: L S S\nFoot 2: S S L\nFoot 3: S S L\nFoot 4: L S S\nFoot 5: L S S\n\n<<<L S S S S L S S L L S S L S S>>>"
