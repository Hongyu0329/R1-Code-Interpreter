    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Non-Attacking Rules\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid, where coordinates (r, c) can be represented by numbers from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\n*   **Toroidal:** The board wraps around. This means that row 0 is adjacent to row 4, and column 0 is adjacent to column 4. All arithmetic for positions should be done modulo 5.\n*   **Non-Attacking Queens:** Two queens at positions (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) are non-attacking if they are not in the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, this translates to:\n    1.  **Row:** `r1 ≠ r2`\n    2.  **Column:** `c1 ≠ c2`\n    3.  **Main Diagonals:** `(r1 - c1) mod 5 ≠ (r2 - c2) mod 5`\n    4.  **Anti-Diagonals:** `(r1 + c1) mod 5 ≠ (r2 + c2) mod 5`\n\nIn essence, if we have a set of 4 queen positions {(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)}, the following four sets must each contain 4 distinct elements:\n*   The set of rows: {r1, r2, r3, r4}\n*   The set of columns: {c1, c2, c3, c4}\n*   The set of main diagonal indices: {(r1-c1) mod 5, (r2-c2) mod 5, (r3-c3) mod 5, (r4-c4) mod 5}\n*   The set of anti-diagonal indices: {(r1+c1) mod 5, (r2+c2) mod 5, (r3+c3) mod 5, (r4+c4) mod 5}\n\n### Step 2: Method 1 - The Completion Method\n\nThis problem can be solved by first considering the simpler, more structured problem of placing 5 queens on the 5x5 toroidal board, and then relating it to the 4-queen problem.\n\n**A. Solving the 5-Queens Problem**\n\nA solution to the 5-queens problem is a set of 5 positions such that all 5 rows, 5 columns, 5 main diagonals, and 5 anti-diagonals are occupied exactly once. This is equivalent to finding a permutation `c` of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} for the rows `r = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)`, such that the mappings `r -> (r - c(r)) mod 5` and `r -> (r + c(r)) mod 5` are also permutations.\n\nFor prime-sized boards like 5x5, it is a known result that all solutions are of the \"linear\" form:\n`c(r) = a*r + b (mod 5)`\n\nFor `c(r)` to be a permutation, `a` must be a non-zero element of Z5, so `a` can be {1, 2, 3, 4}.\nFor `r - c(r) = r - (ar+b) = (1-a)r - b` to be a permutation, `(1-a)` must be non-zero. This means `a ≠ 1`.\nFor `r + c(r) = r + (ar+b) = (1+a)r + b` to be a permutation, `(1+a)` must be non-zero. This means `a ≠ -1 mod 5`, so `a ≠ 4`.\n\nCombining these, `a` can only be **2 or 3**.\nThe value `b` can be any of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, representing a cyclic shift of the columns.\n\n*   Number of choices for `a`: 2 (either 2 or 3)\n*   Number of choices for `b`: 5\n*   Total number of 5-queen solutions: 2 * 5 = **10** solutions.\n\n**B. Relating the 4-Queens Problem to the 5-Queens Problem**\n\nThere is a theorem (the completion theorem for n-queens on a toroidal board) which states that for a prime number `n`, any valid placement of `n-1` non-attacking queens can be uniquely extended to a valid placement of `n` queens.\n\nThis means that every solution for 4 queens on the 5x5 toroidal board is simply a solution for 5 queens with one queen removed.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4-queen placements is the number of 5-queen solutions multiplied by the number of ways to remove one queen from each solution.\n\n*   Number of 5-queen solutions = 10\n*   Number of queens to remove from each solution = 5\n*   Total 4-queen placements = 10 * 5 = **50**\n\nWe must ensure this process doesn't count the same 4-queen arrangement multiple times. Two distinct 5-queen solutions can share at most one queen. Therefore, removing one queen from two different 5-queen solutions will never result in the same set of 4 queens. The 50 arrangements are all unique.\n\n### Step 3: Method 2 - Direct Combinatorial Counting (Verification)\n\nThis method confirms the result from Method 1 by direct counting, making careful use of symmetry.\n\n1.  **Count Ordered Placements:** We first count the number of ways to place queens Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 in a specific order. Since the queens are identical, we will later divide by 4! (the number of ways to order 4 queens).\n\n2.  **Place Q1:** A toroidal board is completely symmetric. Any square is equivalent to any other. We can place Q1 at a fixed position, say (0,0), and multiply our final result by 25.\n    *   Choices for Q1: **25**\n\n3.  **Place Q2:** With Q1 at (0,0), 16 squares are attacked (4 on the row, 4 on the column, 4 on each of the two diagonals). This leaves 25 - 1 - 16 = 8 squares for Q2. All these 8 squares are equivalent under the symmetries of the board that fix (0,0). So, we can place Q2 at any of these spots, say (1,2), and multiply by 8.\n    *   Choices for Q2, given Q1: **8**\n\n4.  **Place Q3:** With Q1 at (0,0) and Q2 at (1,2), we must find a valid spot for Q3. By enumerating the remaining 3x3 subgrid and checking for diagonal attacks from Q1 and Q2, we find there are **3** possible squares for Q3: (2,4), (3,1), and (4,3). These 3 choices are not equivalent, so we analyze them separately.\n\n5.  **Place Q4:**\n    *   If Q3 is placed at (2,4), there are **2** valid spots left for Q4.\n    *   If Q3 is placed at (3,1), there are **2** valid spots left for Q4.\n    *   If Q3 is placed at (4,3), there are **2** valid spots left for Q4.\n    The total number of choices for Q3 and Q4, given Q1 and Q2, is 2 + 2 + 2 = **6**.\n\n6.  **Calculate Total Sets:**\n    *   Number of ordered placements = 25 (for Q1) * 8 (for Q2) * 6 (for Q3 & Q4) = **1200**.\n    *   Since the 4 queens are identical, we divide by the number of ways to order them, which is 4! = 24.\n    *   Number of unique sets = 1200 / 24 = **50**.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Toroidal Geometry:** The attack rules must use modular arithmetic. A common mistake is to use standard diagonal rules.\n*   **Symmetry:** The board is highly symmetric. Using this symmetry (as in Method 2) is crucial for simplifying direct counting and avoiding errors.\n*   **Relationship between (n-1)- and n-Queens:** The completion theorem is a powerful tool, but it's specific to certain conditions (e.g., n being prime). Its application here is the most elegant path to the solution.\n*   **Indistinguishable Queens:** The problem asks for the number of \"ways to place,\" which implies the queens are identical. If we count ordered placements, we must divide by the number of permutations of the queens.\n*   **Overcounting:** When combining results from different starting points or sub-problems, it's essential to ensure no arrangement is counted more than once. The argument that different 5-queen solutions lead to different 4-queen solutions is a key part of Method 1's validity.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis from two different methods concludes that there are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
