    "Answering the question requires finding the number of permutations of length 333 that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly 3 inversions. The notation for this quantity is \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\nLet n be the length of the permutation and k be the number of inversions. We are asked to find \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) for n=333 and k=3. Since n=333 is a large number, we expect the answer to be independent of n for n greater than some small integer. Let's denote this value as \\(a_k\\).\n\nStep 1: Analyze permutations with a small number of inversions.\nAn inversion in a permutation \\(\\pi = \\pi_1 \\pi_2 \\dots \\pi_n\\) is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and \\(\\pi_i > \\pi_j\\).\nA permutation \\(\\pi\\) contains the pattern 1324 if there exist indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) such that \\(\\pi_{i_1} < \\pi_{i_3} < \\pi_{i_2} < \\pi_{i_4}\\).\n\nk=0: The only permutation is the identity \\(\\pi = (1, 2, \\dots, n)\\). It has 0 inversions. It is not possible to find indices satisfying \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) with \\(\\pi_{i_2} > \\pi_{i_3}\\), so it avoids 1324.\nThus, \\(av_n^0(1324) = 1\\) for all \\(n \\ge 1\\). So, \\(a_0 = 1\\).\n\nk=1: A permutation with one inversion is of the form \\(\\pi = (1, 2, \\dots, i-1, i+1, i, i+2, \\dots, n)\\) for some \\(i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}\\). There are \\(n-1\\) such permutations.\nA 1324 pattern requires an inversion, so for \\(\\pi_{i_2} > \\pi_{i_3}\\) with \\(i_2 < i_3\\), we must have the indices involved with the single inversion in \\(\\pi\\). The only inversion is (\\(i, i+1\\)). This implies we must have \\(i_2=i\\) and \\(i_3=i+1\\).\nThe pattern condition becomes \\(\\pi_{i_1} < \\pi_{i+1} < \\pi_i < \\pi_{i_4}\\) for some \\(i_1 < i < i+1 < i_4\\).\nSubstituting the values from \\(\\pi\\), we get \\(\\pi_{i_1} < i < i+1 < \\pi_{i_4}\\).\nFor \\(i_1 < i\\), \\(\\pi_{i_1}=i_1\\). For \\(i_4 > i+1\\), \\(\\pi_{i_4}=i_4\\). The condition becomes \\(i_1 < i < i+1 < i_4\\).\nA pattern exists if we can find such \\(i_1\\) and \\(i_4\\). This is possible if \\(i>1\\) and \\(i+1 < n\\), i.e., \\(1 < i < n-1\\).\nThe permutations that avoid 1324 are those for which this condition fails, which is when \\(i=1\\) or \\(i=n-1\\).\nFor \\(n \\ge 3\\), there are two such permutations: \\((2, 1, 3, \\dots, n)\\) and \\((1, 2, \\dots, n-2, n, n-1)\\).\nThus, \\(av_n^1(1324) = 2\\) for \\(n \\ge 3\\). So, \\(a_1 = 2\\).\n\nk=2: Through a similar but more detailed case analysis (based on how two inversions can be formed), we can find the number of avoiding permutations. The permutations with 2 inversions are \"close\" to the identity. The ones that avoid 1324 for large n are those where the elements not in their natural sorted position are all at the beginning or all at the end of the permutation.\nThe permutations with 2 inversions are of three types:\n1.  \\((3,1,2,4,\\dots)\\) and its symmetric versions. (Type A)\n2.  \\((2,3,1,4,\\dots)\\) and its symmetric versions. (Type C)\n3.  \\((2,1,4,3,\\dots)\\) and its symmetric versions. (Type B)\nFor large n, the avoiding permutations are:\n-   From Type A: \\((3,1,2,4,\\dots,n)\\) and \\((1,2,\\dots,n-3,n,n-2,n-1)\\). (2 permutations)\n-   From Type C: \\((2,3,1,4,\\dots,n)\\) and \\((1,2,\\dots,n-3,n-1,n,n-2)\\). (2 permutations)\n-   From Type B: \\((2,1,3,\\dots,n-2,n,n-1)\\). (1 permutation)\nTotal: \\(2+2+1=5\\).\nThus, \\(av_n^2(1324) = 5\\) for \\(n \\ge 4\\). So, \\(a_2 = 5\\).\n\nStep 2: Generalize the approach for k=3.\nThe permutations that avoid 1324 for large n must have their non-fixed points (action) concentrated at the ends of the permutation. This is because any \"action\" in the middle of the permutation has space on both sides to pick the other elements needed to form a 1324 pattern.\n\nWe can classify the 1324-avoiding permutations with k=3 based on where the \"action\" occurs.\n1.  Action is at the beginning: The permutation is of the form \\(\\sigma \\oplus id_{n-m} = (\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_m, m+1, \\dots, n)\\) where \\(\\sigma\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{1,\\dots,m\\}\\) with 3 inversions. Such a permutation avoids 1324 if and only if \\(\\sigma\\) avoids the pattern 132. We need to find the number of 132-avoiding permutations \\(\\sigma\\) with 3 inversions. The number of non-fixed points in such a permutation is small.\n    -   \\(\\sigma \\in S_3\\): \\(\\sigma=(3,2,1)\\) has 3 inversions and is 132-avoiding. (1 perm)\n    -   \\(\\sigma \\in S_4\\): The permutations with 3 inversions are \\((1,4,3,2), (2,3,4,1), (2,4,1,3), (3,1,4,2), (3,2,1,4), (4,1,2,3)\\). Out of these, the 132-avoiding ones are \\((2,3,4,1), (3,2,1,4), (4,1,2,3)\\). (3 perms)\n    -   \\(\\sigma \\in S_m, m \\ge 5\\): It can be shown that any permutation with 3 inversions on 5 or more elements contains a 132 pattern.\n    This gives \\(1+3=4\\) permutations.\n\n2.  Action is at the end: The permutation is of the form \\(id_{n-m} \\oplus \\sigma = (1, \\dots, n-m, \\sigma_1+n-m, \\dots, \\sigma_m+n-m)\\). Such a permutation avoids 1324 if and only if \\(\\sigma\\) is separable (i.e., avoids 2413 and 3142).\n    -   \\(\\sigma \\in S_3\\): \\(\\sigma=(3,2,1)\\) is separable. (1 perm)\n    -   \\(\\sigma \\in S_4\\): The separable permutations with 3 inversions are \\((1,4,3,2), (2,3,4,1), (3,2,1,4), (4,1,2,3)\\). (4 perms)\n    This gives \\(1+4=5\\) permutations.\n\n3.  Action is at both ends: The permutation has some non-fixed points at the beginning and some at the end. The number of inversions must sum to 3.\n    -   k=1 at the start, k=2 at the end: 2 permutations.\n        -   \\((2,1,3,\\dots,n-3,n,n-2,n-1)\\)\n        -   \\((2,1,3,\\dots,n-3,n-1,n,n-2)\\)\n    -   k=2 at the start, k=1 at the end: 2 permutations.\n        -   \\((3,1,2,4,\\dots,n-1,n)\\)\n        -   \\((2,3,1,4,\\dots,n-1,n)\\)\n    This gives \\(2+2=4\\) permutations.\n\nTotal number of permutations: \\(4 + 5 + 4 = 13\\).\nThe lists of permutations generated by these three rules are mutually exclusive for large n. A permutation from rule 1 has its non-fixed points within the first few positions. A permutation from rule 2 has them at the last few positions. A permutation from rule 3 has them at both ends.\n\nThe sequence we've found is \\(a_0=1, a_1=2, a_2=5, a_3=13\\). This corresponds to the odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers: \\(F_1=1, F_3=2, F_5=5, F_7=13\\), where the Fibonacci sequence starts \\(F_1=1, F_2=1\\). The formula is \\(a_k = F_{2k+1}\\).\n\nSince n=333 is large enough for these classifications to hold, the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) is 13."
