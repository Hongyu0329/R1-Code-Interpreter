    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the specified manifold.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Definition of the Manifold\n\nThe manifold in question is the \"double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\" Let's break this down:\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot ($K$):** The trefoil knot, denoted $3_1$ or $T(2,3)$, is the simplest non-trivial knot. It is a knot in the 3-sphere $S^3$.\n*   **The 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil ($\\Sigma$):** This is a 2-dimensional sphere ($S^2$) embedded in the 4-sphere ($S^4$). The embedding is constructed from the trefoil knot $K$ using a procedure called \"5-twist-spinning.\" Let's denote this surface by $\\Sigma = \\tau_5(K)$.\n*   **Double branched cover of $S^4$ over $\\Sigma$ ($M$):** This is a 4-dimensional manifold, which we will call $M$, that \"covers\" $S^4$ twice. The two sheets of the cover are joined along the surface $\\Sigma$, which is the branch set.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of this manifold $M$, denoted as $d(\\pi_1(M))$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Branch Locus $\\Sigma$\n\nA crucial step is to determine the nature of the embedded surface $\\Sigma$. Is it a complicated, knotted 2-sphere in $S^4$, or is it simple?\n\nA key theorem by E. C. Zeeman provides a criterion to determine if a twist-spun knot is unknotted (i.e., smoothly isotopic to the standard, \"equator\" 2-sphere in $S^4$).\n\n**Zeeman's Unknotting Criterion:** The $m$-twist-spun knot $\\tau_m(K)$ is unknotted in $S^4$ if and only if the fundamental group of the 3-manifold obtained by $m/1$ Dehn surgery on the original knot $K$ is a cyclic group.\n\nLet's apply this criterion to our case:\n*   The knot is the trefoil, $K = T(2,3)$.\n*   The number of twists is $m=5$.\n*   We need to compute the fundamental group of the 3-manifold $M(K, 5/1)$, which results from 5/1-surgery on the trefoil knot.\n\nThe fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement, $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$, can be presented as $G_K = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3 \\rangle$. The surgery introduces a new relation. For a $(p,q)$-torus knot $T(p,q)$, the group of the manifold after $m/1$ surgery is given by adding the relation $(x^u y^v)^{m-pq} x^p = 1$ to the knot group, where $u,v$ are integers satisfying $pu+qv=1$.\n\n*   For the trefoil $T(2,3)$, we have $p=2, q=3$. We can choose integers $u=-1, v=1$ since $2(-1) + 3(1) = 1$.\n*   The surgery coefficient is $m=5$.\n*   The new relation is $(x^{-1}y)^{5 - (2)(3)} x^2 = 1$.\n*   This simplifies to $(x^{-1}y)^{-1} x^2 = 1$, which means $(y^{-1}x)x^2 = 1$, so $y^{-1}x^3 = 1$, or $y=x^3$.\n\nNow, we substitute this into the original group relation $x^2=y^3$:\n$x^2 = (x^3)^3 = x^9$\nThis implies $x^7 = 1$.\n\nThe fundamental group of the surgery manifold is therefore $\\langle x, y \\mid y=x^3, x^7=1 \\rangle$, which is isomorphic to $\\langle x \\mid x^7=1 \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_7$.\n\nSince $\\mathbb{Z}_7$ is a cyclic group, Zeeman's criterion tells us that the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, $\\Sigma$, is **unknotted**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Simplified Problem\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over an **unknotted** 2-sphere.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Covering Manifold $M$\n\nThe double branched cover of $S^4$ over an unknotted 2-sphere is a well-known 4-manifold.\nIt is a standard result in 4-manifold topology that this manifold is homeomorphic to the product of a circle and a 3-sphere:\n$M \\cong S^1 \\times S^3$.\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Fundamental Group of $M$\n\nNow we can compute the fundamental group of $M$ using its known topology:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\pi_1(S^1 \\times S^3)$\n\nUsing the property that the fundamental group of a product space is the product of the fundamental groups:\n$\\pi_1(S^1 \\times S^3) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1) \\times \\pi_1(S^3)$\n\nThe fundamental groups of the factor spaces are:\n*   $\\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ (the infinite cyclic group of integers).\n*   $\\pi_1(S^3) \\cong \\{1\\}$ (the trivial group, as the 3-sphere is simply connected).\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of our manifold is:\n$\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{1\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Minimal Number of Generators\n\nThe question asks for the minimal number of generators of this group. The group is the infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$. This group can be generated by a single element (either 1 or -1).\n\nThus, the minimal number of generators is 1."
