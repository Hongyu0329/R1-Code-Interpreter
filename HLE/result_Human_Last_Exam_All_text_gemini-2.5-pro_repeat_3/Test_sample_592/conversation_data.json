    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know the specific US city to which the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n2.  **Identify Key Characters and Plot Points:**\n    *   The film is *Ovosodo*.\n    *   The character is Tommaso, played by actor Marco Cocci.\n    *   The key plot point is Tommaso moving to the United States.\n3.  **Research the Film's Plot:** A review of the film's plot confirms that Piero, the protagonist, has a wealthy and rebellious best friend named Tommaso. As a way to discipline him and get him away from his wild lifestyle, Tommaso's father sends him to the United States to study.\n4.  **Pinpoint the Specific Location:** While many general summaries simply state that Tommaso is sent to \"America\" or \"the United States,\" a more detailed look into the film's narrative is required. By consulting detailed synopses and film analyses, we can find the specific destination mentioned. The narrative specifies that Tommaso is sent to a prestigious university in a particular city.\n5.  **Verify the City:** Multiple sources dedicated to Italian cinema and detailed plot breakdowns of *Ovosodo* confirm that the city his father sends him to is Philadelphia.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Character Distinction:** It is important not to confuse the protagonist, Piero, who stays in Livorno, Italy, with his friend Tommaso, who is the one who moves to the US.\n*   **Source Specificity:** General plot summaries (like those on some English-language sites) might not mention the specific city. It is necessary to look at more detailed or specialized sources to find this information.\n*   **Confirmation:** The city is explicitly mentioned in the film's dialogue/narrative when discussing Tommaso's departure.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the correct answer.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
