This is a very specific historical period in the Russian Empire, during the reign of Empress Anna Ioannovna.\n\n3.  **Research the historical leadership:** To answer the question, one must consult a historical list of the abbots (archimandrites) of the Pskov-Caves Monastery. Such lists are available in historical archives, church histories, and reliable encyclopedic sources.\n\n4.  **Examine the succession of archimandrites around the 1730-1731 period:**\n    *   Archimandrite Markell (Radyshevsky) was the superior from 1727 to 1729.\n    *   Archimandrite **Kirill (Florinsky)** was appointed and served as the superior from **1730 to 1731**.\n    *   Archimandrite Innokentiy (Mitskevich) succeeded Kirill and served from 1731 to 1736.\n\n5.  **Compare the finding with the provided answer choices:**\n    *   A. Feofan: Not the archimandrite during this period.\n    *   B. Serafim: Not the archimandrite during this period.\n    *   C. Filaret: Not the archimandrite during this period.\n    *   D. Innokentiy: He became the archimandrite *in* 1731, but Kirill held the position *from 1730 to 1731*.\n    *   E. Amvrosiy: Not the archimandrite during this period.\n    *   F. Markell: He was the predecessor, serving until 1729.\n    *   G. Veniamin: He served later, from 1736.\n    *   H. **Kirill**: This matches the historical record. Kirill (Florinsky) was the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery from 1730 to 1731.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the historical records of the Pskov-Caves Monastery's leadership, the archimandrite from 1730 to 1731 was Kirill.\n\n<<<H>>>"
