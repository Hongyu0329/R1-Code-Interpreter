    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point.\n*   **Composant:** For a point *p* in a continuum *X*, the composant of *p*, denoted Comp(*p*), is the union of all proper subcontinua of *X* that contain *p*. A subcontinuum is a closed, connected subset. A proper subcontinuum is one that is not equal to the entire space *X*. The set of all composants of *X* forms a partition of *X*.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continuum:**\n    *   A continuum *X* is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua, i.e., *X = A U B* where *A* and *B* are proper subcontinua of *X*.\n    *   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n*   **Product of Continua:** If *X* and *Y* are continua, their Cartesian product *X x Y* with the product topology is also a continuum. Since *X* and *Y* are nondegenerate, *X x Y* is also nondegenerate.\n\n**2. Relate the Number of Composants to Decomposability**\n\nThis is a fundamental result in continuum theory:\n*   If a continuum *X* is **decomposable**, it has exactly **one** composant, which is the space *X* itself.\n*   If a continuum *X* is **indecomposable**, it has **uncountably many** composants. The cardinality of the set of composants is *c*, the cardinality of the continuum ($2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\n**3. Frame the Question in Terms of Decomposability**\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible number* of composants of the product *Z = X x Y*, where *X* and *Y* are nondegenerate continua. Based on the point above, the number of composants can be either 1 or uncountable (*c*). The largest possible value is therefore uncountable (*c*).\n\nThe question thus becomes: **Can the product of two nondegenerate continua, *X x Y*, be an indecomposable continuum?**\n\n*   If the answer is **no** (i.e., *X x Y* is always decomposable), then the number of composants is always 1, and this would be the largest possible number.\n*   If the answer is **yes** (i.e., there exists at least one pair of nondegenerate continua *X*, *Y* such that *X x Y* is indecomposable), then the largest possible number of composants is uncountable (*c*).\n\n**4. Analyze the Decomposability of the Product *X x Y***\n\nLet's investigate when *X x Y* is decomposable.\n\n*   **Case 1: At least one of the continua (*X* or *Y*) is decomposable.**\n    Let's assume *X* is decomposable. By definition, there exist two proper subcontinua *A* and *B* of *X* such that *X = A U B*.\n    Now consider the product *X x Y*:\n    *X x Y = (A U B) x Y = (A x Y) U (B x Y)*.\n    Let *M1 = A x Y* and *M2 = B x Y*.\n    *   Is *M1* a proper subcontinuum of *X x Y*? Yes. Since *A* is a proper subcontinuum of *X*, there is a point *x* in *X \\ A*. Then for any *y* in *Y*, the point *(x, y)* is in *X x Y* but not in *M1*. Also, *M1* is a product of two continua, so it is a continuum.\n    *   Similarly, *M2* is a proper subcontinuum of *X x Y*.\n    *   Since *X x Y = M1 U M2*, we have shown that *X x Y* is decomposable.\n    *   A symmetric argument holds if *Y* is decomposable.\n    *   **Conclusion for Case 1:** If either *X* or *Y* is decomposable, their product *X x Y* is decomposable and has exactly **1** composant.\n\n*   **Case 2: Both *X* and *Y* are indecomposable.**\n    This is the crucial case. It is not immediately obvious whether the product *X x Y* must be decomposable or can be indecomposable. It turns out that for many \"common\" indecomposable continua (like the pseudo-arc), the product with another continuum (or even itself) is decomposable. For example, R. H. Bing showed that the product of two pseudo-arcs is decomposable. This might lead one to incorrectly guess that the product is always decomposable.\n\n    However, this is not true in general. The question of whether the product of two indecomposable continua can be indecomposable was a famous open problem for some time. It was solved by **David P. Bellamy in 1970**.\n\n    **Theorem (Bellamy, 1970):** There exists a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum *K* such that its product with itself, *K x K*, is also indecomposable.\n\n**5. Synthesize and Conclude**\n\n1.  The number of composants of a continuum is either 1 (if decomposable) or uncountable (*c*) (if indecomposable).\n2.  We want the *largest possible* number. This would be uncountable, provided we can find an example.\n3.  Let *K* be the indecomposable continuum from Bellamy's theorem. *K* is a nondegenerate continuum.\n4.  Choose *X = K* and *Y = K*. Both are nondegenerate continua.\n5.  Their product, *Z = X x Y = K x K*, is an indecomposable continuum.\n6.  Since *Z* is indecomposable, it has an uncountable number of composants.\n7.  Therefore, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is uncountable.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   It is crucial to know the relationship between the number of composants and the property of (in)decomposability.\n*   The condition that the continua are *nondegenerate* is essential. It ensures that \"slices\" like *X x {y}* are proper subcontinua, which is used in the argument for Case 1.\n*   One must not assume that the product of two indecomposable continua is always indecomposable, nor that it is always decomposable. The answer depends on a deep and non-trivial result from the mathematical literature.\n*   The number of composants of an indecomposable continuum is not just \"more than one\", but specifically uncountable with cardinality *c*. This is a consequence of the Baire Category Theorem.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of composants of a continuum is either 1 (if it is decomposable) or uncountable (if it is indecomposable). It has been proven that there exist two nondegenerate indecomposable continua whose product is also indecomposable. Therefore, the product of two nondegenerate continua can be indecomposable, in which case it has an uncountable number of composants. This is the maximum possible number.\n\n<<<Uncountable>>>"
