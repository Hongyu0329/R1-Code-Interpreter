    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core physical principles and formulas required.**\nThe problem combines two key concepts from early quantum mechanics:\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position ($\\Delta x$) to the uncertainty in its momentum ($\\Delta p$). The mathematical relationship is:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar = h/2\\pi$). For this problem, we will consider the case of minimum uncertainty, so we use the equality:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\Delta x}$\n\n2.  **Bohr's Model of the Atom:** This model provides a value for the momentum ($p$) of an electron in a specific orbit. According to Bohr's quantization condition, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in the n-th orbit is an integer multiple of $\\hbar$:\n    $L = mvr = n\\hbar$\n    For the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$. The linear momentum is $p = mv$. Therefore, we can write the angular momentum as $L = p \\cdot r_1 = 1 \\cdot \\hbar$. From this, we can find the momentum of the electron:\n    $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n    where $r_1$ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the ratio to be calculated.**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum itself, which is $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\nUsing the expressions derived in Step 1:\n*   $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\Delta x}$\n*   $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n\nThe ratio becomes:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\Delta x}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}}$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the expression for the ratio.**\nWe can simplify the complex fraction by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\Delta x} \\cdot \\frac{r_1}{\\hbar}$\n\nThe reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ cancels out, which simplifies the calculation significantly:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{r_1}{2\\Delta x}$\n\n**Step 4: Identify the values of the given quantities and constants.**\n1.  **Given Uncertainty in Position ($\\Delta x$):**\n    $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$\n\n2.  **Constant - First Bohr Radius ($r_1$):**\n    The radius of the first Bohr orbit is a well-known physical constant, also called the Bohr radius ($a_0$).\n    $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 52.9 \\text{ pm}$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the values and calculate the final answer.**\nNow we plug the values for $r_1$ and $\\Delta x$ into our simplified formula from Step 3.\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{52.9 \\text{ pm}}{2 \\times 10 \\text{ pm}}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{52.9}{20}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity, as the units (pm) cancel out.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Minimum Uncertainty:** We assume the product of uncertainties is at its theoretical minimum ($\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\hbar/2$). This is a standard approach for such problems unless specified otherwise.\n2.  **Bohr Model Limitations:** The Bohr model is a semi-classical model and is not fully consistent with the uncertainty principle (e.g., it assumes a well-defined radius and momentum simultaneously). However, for problems like this, we are expected to use the values derived from the model.\n3.  **Consistency of Units:** It is crucial to use consistent units for $\\Delta x$ and $r_1$. Using picometers (pm) for both is the most direct method as the units cancel, avoiding the need to convert to SI units (meters).\n4.  **Cancellation of $\\hbar$:** A key insight is that $\\hbar$ cancels out, meaning we don't need its numerical value ($1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}$) for the final calculation. This greatly simplifies the problem.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   Momentum Uncertainty: $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\Delta x}$\n*   Momentum: $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n*   Ratio: $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{r_1}{2\\Delta x}$\n*   Values: $r_1 = 52.9 \\text{ pm}$, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$\n*   Calculation: $\\frac{52.9}{2 \\times 10} = \\frac{52.9}{20} = 2.645$\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
