    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we will follow the standard procedure for constructing game values from the book \"Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Decompose the number into its binary representation.**\n\nThe value of a red-blue-Hackenbush game is a surreal number. For dyadic rationals (fractions with a power of 2 in the denominator), we can construct the game by first expressing the number in binary.\n\nThe number is $\\frac{13}{16}$. Let's convert it to binary:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8 + 4 + 1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nIn terms of powers of two, this is:\n$2^{-1} + 2^{-2} + 2^{-4}$\n\nThe binary representation is therefore $0.1101_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Hackenbush representation for the components.**\n\nThe value of a sum of games, like $G(A+B)$, is represented by placing the game for A and the game for B side-by-side, both connected to the ground. Therefore, the representation for $\\frac{13}{16}$ will consist of three separate game structures (stalks), one for each term in the sum: $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nWe need to know the canonical construction for a game with the value $1/2^n$.\n\n*   **The game for $1/2$ (i.e., $1/2^1$):** This game has the value $\\{0|1\\}$. It is constructed from a stalk of one red edge at the base and one blue edge on top.\n    *   Pieces: 1 red, 1 blue.\n\n*   **The game for $1/4$ (i.e., $1/2^2$):** This game has the value $\\{0|1/2\\}$. The canonical construction is a stalk of one red edge at the base and two blue edges on top.\n    *   Pieces: 1 red, 2 blue.\n\n*   **The general game for $1/2^n$:** Following the pattern, the game for $1/2^n$ is represented by a single stalk made of one red edge at the base with *n* blue edges stacked on top of it.\n    *   Pieces: 1 red, *n* blue.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces for each component stalk.**\n\nNow, we apply this rule to the three components of $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n1.  **Component for $\\frac{1}{2}$ ($n=1$):**\n    *   The structure requires 1 red piece and 1 blue piece.\n    *   Total pieces for this stalk: $1+1=2$.\n\n2.  **Component for $\\frac{1}{4}$ ($n=2$):**\n    *   The structure requires 1 red piece and 2 blue pieces.\n    *   Total pieces for this stalk: $1+2=3$.\n\n3.  **Component for $\\frac{1}{16}$ ($n=4$):**\n    *   The structure requires 1 red piece and 4 blue pieces.\n    *   Total pieces for this stalk: $1+4=5$.\n\n**Step 4: Sum the pieces from all components.**\n\nThe total number of pieces needed to represent $\\frac{13}{16}$ is the sum of the pieces from the three individual stalks.\n\n*   **Total Red Pieces:** $1 (\\text{from } 1/2) + 1 (\\text{from } 1/4) + 1 (\\text{from } 1/16) = 3$ red pieces.\n*   **Total Blue Pieces:** $1 (\\text{from } 1/2) + 2 (\\text{from } 1/4) + 4 (\\text{from } 1/16) = 7$ blue pieces.\n*   **Total Pieces:** $3 \\text{ red} + 7 \\text{ blue} = 10$ pieces.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Decomposition:** The binary decomposition must be correct. $13_{10} = 1101_2$, so $\\frac{13}{16}$ is $0.1101_2$, which corresponds to the sum $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$. This is a crucial first step.\n*   **Canonical Form:** The question implies the use of the standard, or canonical, representation for the number. The method described above (sum of games for each binary '1') is the canonical one.\n*   **Structure of $1/2^n$:** It is essential to know the correct structure for the game $1/2^n$. The stalk with 1 red edge at the base and *n* blue edges on top correctly evaluates to the value $1/2^n$.\n*   **Summation of Games:** The sum of games in Hackenbush corresponds to a disjoint union of the game graphs. This means the pieces for each component game are simply added together.\n\n### Final Answer\nFollowing the step-by-step analysis, the total number of pieces is the sum of pieces for the games representing $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$, which is $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$.\n\n<<<10>>>"
