    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe query asks for a specific scene with several key elements:\n1.  **A Hollywood feature film:** A movie made for theatrical release.\n2.  **Produced by a major film studio:** Backed by one of the large, established Hollywood studios (e.g., Paramount, Universal, Warner Bros., Fox, Sony, Disney).\n3.  **A teenager character:** The person on the bike must be aged 13-19.\n4.  **Rides a pink bike:** The color of the bicycle is a critical visual detail.\n5.  **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car:** This describes a specific, deliberate action of not swerving or stopping until the last moment.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination**\nSome movies feature famous scenes with teenagers and vehicles, but they don't match all the criteria.\n*   ***Footloose* (1984):** This film has a famous scene of defiance involving vehicles. However, the protagonist, Ren McCormack, plays \"chicken\" with his rival using two large farm tractors, not a pink bike and a car.\n*   ***Pretty in Pink* (1986):** While the title is suggestive and the characters are teenagers, no one rides a pink bike toward a car. The character Duckie rides a distinctive bicycle, but it is not pink.\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982):** This film has one of the most iconic bicycle scenes in history, but the bike is not pink, and the children fly *over* the roadblock of cars, rather than pedaling toward them.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Correct Film and Scene**\nThe film that matches all the specific details is **Napoleon Dynamite (2004)**.\n\n**Step 4: Careful Analysis of *Napoleon Dynamite* Against the Criteria**\n1.  **Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio?** Yes. While it started as an independent film, *Napoleon Dynamite* was acquired and given a wide theatrical release by Fox Searchlight Pictures (then a subsidiary of 20th Century Fox) and Paramount Pictures, making it a major studio-backed feature film.\n2.  **A teenager character?** Yes. The character in the scene is **Deb Bradshaw**, played by Tina Majorino. Deb is a fellow high school student of Napoleon's, making her a teenager.\n3.  **Rides a pink bike?** Yes. Deb is often seen riding her distinctive light pink bicycle throughout the film.\n4.  **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes. In one specific scene, Napoleon's brother, Kip, is driving his van and pulls out into the road, blocking Deb's path. Instead of stopping or swerving, Deb continues to pedal with a determined look on her face, heading directly for the side of the van until her front wheel makes contact with it.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe scene from *Napoleon Dynamite* perfectly matches every detail requested in the question. A teenage character (Deb) on a pink bike pedals directly toward an oncoming/obstructing vehicle in a feature film distributed by a major studio.\n\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
