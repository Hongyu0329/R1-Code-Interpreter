    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source Material:** The question is about the online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\". This is a very specific universe with its own lore and characters.\n2.  **Narrow Down to the Specific Episode:** The question points directly to \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". This means we only need to recall or look up the events of this particular installment.\n3.  **Identify the Setting and Event:** The key event mentioned in the question is the \"Junior prom\".\n4.  **Identify the Performer:** The question asks for the name of the fictional singer who \"performs\" at the prom.\n5.  **Note the Key Detail:** The performance is by a \"cardboard cutout\" of the singer, not a live person or animated character.\n6.  **Recall or Research the Scene:** In \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the girls are at their Junior Prom. Cheerleader exclaims her excitement about the musical guest.\n7.  **Analyze the Dialogue and Visuals:**\n    *   **Dialogue:** Cheerleader says, \"i can't believe we got the real live Cardboard Cutout of **Thompkins** to play at our j-prom!\"\n    *   **Visuals:** On the stage, there is a cardboard cutout of a singer holding a guitar. The name \"**THOMPKINS**\" is written on the cutout's stand. A song with the lyrics \"You're a real life prom queen...\" plays.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Fictional vs. Real:** The question specifically asks for a *fictional* singer. Thompkins is a character created solely for this cartoon.\n*   **Spelling:** The name is spelled \"Thompkins\".\n*   **The Joke:** The humor comes from Cheerleader's excitement over a \"real live Cardboard Cutout,\" highlighting the low-budget, hand-drawn nature of the Teen Girl Squad's world.\n*   **Confirmation:** The name is confirmed both by a character's dialogue (Cheerleader) and by text written on the object in question (the cutout itself).\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBy analyzing the dialogue and the visual evidence from the specific scene in \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", we can definitively identify the name of the fictional singer represented by the cardboard cutout at the prom.\n\n<<<Thompkins>>>"
