    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We first try to find factors of this polynomial. By rearranging the terms, we can find a common factor:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 9x^3) - (2x^5 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^3(x^4 - 9) - 2x(x^4 - 9) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^3 - 2x)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 3) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = x(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 3) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nNow, we can factor out the term $(x^2 - 2)$:\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2) [x(x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 3) + 3]$\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2) [x(x^4 - 9) + 3]$\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2) (x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n\nSo, the polynomial $f(x)$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$ into two polynomials: $p_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $p_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nWe check the irreducibility of $p_2(x)$. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n1.  The prime 3 does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\n2.  The prime 3 divides all other coefficients (0, 0, -9, 3).\n3.  The prime squared, $3^2=9$, does not divide the constant term (3).\nTherefore, $p_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the splitting field K and its Galois group**\n\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the smallest field containing all the roots of $p_1(x)$ and $p_2(x)$. Let $K_1$ be the splitting field of $p_1(x)$ and $K_2$ be the splitting field of $p_2(x)$. Then $K$ is the composite field $K_1K_2$.\n\n*   **For $p_1(x) = x^2 - 2$**: The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **For $p_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$**: This is an irreducible quintic polynomial. Its Galois group, let's call it $G_2 = \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. To determine the group, we find the number of real roots. The derivative is $p_2'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $p_2'(x)$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. There are two real critical points. This means $p_2(x)$ has at most three real roots. Evaluating $p_2(x)$ at these points reveals one local maximum with a positive value and one local minimum with a negative value, which confirms there are exactly 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots. The complex conjugation acts as a transposition on the set of roots. A transitive subgroup of $S_5$ that contains a transposition and an element of order 5 (which must exist since the degree is 5) is $S_5$ itself. Thus, $G_2 \\cong S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[K_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n*   **The composite field K**: The Galois group of $K = K_1K_2$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Its structure depends on the intersection $K_1 \\cap K_2$. Since $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a degree 2 extension, the intersection is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If the intersection were $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ would be a subfield of $K_2$. The Galois group of $K_2$ is $S_5$. $S_5$ has exactly one normal subgroup of index 2, which is $A_5$. This corresponds to a unique quadratic subfield of $K_2$, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $p_2(x)$.\n    The discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} (n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1} a^n)$.\n    For $p_2(x)$, $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n    $D = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 3125 \\cdot 81 - 256 \\cdot 59049 = 253125 - 15116544 < 0$.\n    Since $D < 0$, the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is an imaginary quadratic field. However, $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and the intersection is $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince the intersection is trivial, the Galois group of the composite field is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify normal subfields and their degrees**\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between intermediate fields $L$ of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ and subgroups $H$ of the Galois group $G$. The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if the corresponding subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nThe problem asks for the degrees of all normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$. This corresponds to finding the indices of all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the normal subgroups of G**\n\nThe normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{e_1\\}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e_2\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ are not always direct products of normal subgroups of $G_1$ and $G_2$. However, we can classify them.\n\n1.  **Product Subgroups**: Subgroups of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\triangleleft \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $N_2 \\triangleleft S_5$.\n    The proper, non-trivial ones are:\n    *   $H_a = \\{e_1\\} \\times A_5$. $|H_a| = 1 \\cdot 60 = 60$.\n    *   $H_b = \\{e_1\\} \\times S_5$. $|H_b| = 1 \\cdot 120 = 120$.\n    *   $H_c = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\{e_2\\}$. $|H_c| = 2 \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n    *   $H_d = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times A_5$. $|H_d| = 2 \\cdot 60 = 120$.\n\n2.  **Diagonal Subgroups**: These subgroups arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of normal subgroups. The only non-trivial possibility here is an isomorphism $\\phi: (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})/\\{e_1\\} \\to S_5/A_5$. Both quotient groups are isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. This gives rise to a normal subgroup:\n    *   $H_e = \\{(g, \\sigma) \\in \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5 \\mid \\phi(g) = \\sigma A_5\\}$.\n        This subgroup consists of pairs $(g, \\sigma)$ where $g$ corresponds to the sign of the permutation $\\sigma$. Its order is $|H_e| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the degrees**\n\nWe calculate the index $[G:H]$ for each of these normal subgroups:\n*   $[G:H_a] = |G|/|H_a| = 240 / 60 = 4$.\n*   $[G:H_b] = |G|/|H_b| = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n*   $[G:H_c] = |G|/|H_c| = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n*   $[G:H_d] = |G|/|H_d| = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n*   $[G:H_e] = |G|/|H_e| = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n\nThe set of possible indices is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$. These are the possible degrees for the normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$.\n\nFinal list of possible degrees: 2, 4, 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
