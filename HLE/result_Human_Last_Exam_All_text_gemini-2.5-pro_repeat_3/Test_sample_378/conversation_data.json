    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific year when an individual named \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Subject's Name**\nThe first and most critical point is to verify the name of the person in question. The former President of Nigeria is known worldwide as **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. His full, official name does not include \"Azikiwe\".\n\n**Step 3: Identify Potential Confusion**\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" is a very famous name in Nigeria, belonging to Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria (1963â€“1966). It is a point of careful consideration that the question may be conflating two different Nigerian presidents.\n\n**Step 4: Search for Evidence**\nTo answer the question, one must search for any public record, official statement, news report, or biographical entry where Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has either legally changed his name to include \"Azikiwe\" or publicly referred to himself as such.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Findings**\nA thorough review of credible sources, including official biographies, news archives, and historical records, reveals no instance of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\". His name has consistently been documented as Goodluck Ebele Jonathan throughout his public life. The premise of the question is based on a factual inaccuracy.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nSince Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name is not \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" and there is no record of him ever publicly identifying as \"Azikiwe\", the event described in the question has never occurred. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a year for something that did not happen.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. His name does not include \"Azikiwe,\" and this event has never occurred.>>>"
