    "This problem requires us to determine how the bare Green's function $G_0$ depends on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ using the Feynman path integral formalism. We will proceed by defining the bare Green's function within this formalism, evaluating the relevant path integral for a non-interacting system, and analyzing the resulting expression.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe Green's function (or propagator) describes the amplitude for a particle to propagate between two spacetime points. For a non-interacting system, this is called the *bare* Green's function, $G_0$. In the path integral formalism (for fermions, using Grassmann fields $\\psi$ and $\\psi^*$), it is defined as the expectation value of two fields:\n\n$G_0(x,t; x',t') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x,t) \\psi^*(x',t') \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}$\n\nHere, $S_0$ is the action for the free (non-interacting) particle. The time-ordering is implicitly handled by the formalism. (Note: A prefactor of $-i$ is often used to match the operator definition, but this does not affect the functional dependence on $\\epsilon_k$).\n\n**Step 2: The Non-Interacting Action and Diagonalization**\n\nThe action for a non-interacting system is quadratic in the fields. In real space and time, it is given by:\n\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x,t) \\left( i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - H_0 \\right) \\psi(x,t)$\n\nwhere $H_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian. To find the dependence on its eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$, we must work in the basis where $H_0$ is diagonal. Let $|k\\rangle$ be the eigenstates of $H_0$ (e.g., momentum states for a translationally invariant system) such that $H_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$.\n\nWe perform a Fourier transform of the fields from the position-time basis $(x, t)$ to the momentum-frequency basis $(k, \\omega)$:\n\n$\\psi(x,t) = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{i(k \\cdot x - \\omega t)} \\psi(k, \\omega)$\n\nSubstituting this into the action, the differential operator becomes an algebraic term in the new basis:\n*   $i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ becomes $\\omega$.\n*   $H_0$ becomes $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe action transforms into a sum over uncoupled modes, which is key to solving the path integral:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\, \\psi^*(k, \\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi(k, \\omega)$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Path Integral**\n\nWith the diagonalized action, the path integral for the Green's function in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis becomes:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\langle \\psi(k,\\omega) \\psi^*(k,\\omega) \\rangle_0$\n\nBecause the action is a sum of independent terms, the path integral factorizes, and we only need to evaluate a standard Gaussian integral for Grassmann variables for each mode $(k, \\omega)$. For a generic single-mode action $S = \\psi^* A \\psi$, the result of the path integral for the propagator is $\\langle \\psi \\psi^* \\rangle = A^{-1}$.\n\nIn our case, the operator $A$ for a given mode $(k, \\omega)$ is simply the scalar function $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. Therefore, its inverse is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 4: Incorporating Causality (The $i\\delta$ Prescription)**\n\nThe expression above is not well-defined as it has a pole on the real frequency axis at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. A more careful derivation of the path integral (e.g., by starting in imaginary time and analytically continuing, or by including a convergence factor) shows that an infinitesimal imaginary part must be added to the denominator to ensure causality. This term, often denoted as $i\\delta$ (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$), shifts the pole slightly off the real axis. The sign of this shift depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied or unoccupied in the ground state. The standard Feynman propagator is written as:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nThe physical interpretation is that $G_0$ has a simple pole in the complex frequency plane at $\\omega \\approx \\epsilon_k$. This pole signifies a long-lived excitation (in this case, an infinitely long-lived particle since there are no interactions) with energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Interacting:** This analysis is strictly for the *bare* propagator $G_0$, governed by the non-interacting action $S_0$. The interacting propagator $G$ would include a self-energy term, $\\Sigma(k, \\omega)$, modifying the denominator.\n2.  **Basis is Key:** The simple algebraic dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is only manifest in the energy-momentum basis where the Hamiltonian $H_0$ is diagonal. In real space, the dependence is a complex integral transform involving all the eigenvalues.\n3.  **Causality:** The $i\\delta$ term in the denominator is a crucial feature that arises from the path integral prescription and ensures the propagator respects causality.\n4.  **Formalism:** While derived here for fermions at zero temperature, the same functional form holds for bosons, and a similar structure exists in the finite-temperature Matsubara formalism, where $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is an **inverse linear relationship** in the denominator. Specifically, in the momentum-frequency representation, the Green's function has the form:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nThis shows that $G_0$ has a simple pole, and the location of this pole in the complex frequency plane is directly determined by the value of the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function in the momentum-frequency representation, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is inversely proportional to the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta)$. This means the functional dependence is an inverse linear relationship, where $\\epsilon_k$ appears as a simple pole in the denominator of the Green's function. The final expression is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$.>>>"
