The bare Green's function in the momentum-frequency representation, $G_0(k, \omega)$, is inversely proportional to the term $(\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta)$. This means the functional dependence is an inverse linear relationship, where $\epsilon_k$ appears as a simple pole in the denominator of the Green's function. The final expression is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\delta}$.
