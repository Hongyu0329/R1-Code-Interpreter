    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the name of the \"value\" that is measured \"between heartbeats\" to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n2.  **Understand the Technology (PPG):** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a technique that uses a light source and a photodetector to measure blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. Each heartbeat sends a pulse of blood through the vessels, causing a peak in the PPG signal.\n3.  **Identify the Core Measurement:** The phrase \"beat-to-beat intervals\" is key. This refers to measuring the amount of time that passes from the peak of one pulse wave (representing one heartbeat) to the peak of the very next pulse wave.\n4.  **Define the \"Value\":** This measured time between two consecutive heartbeats is the fundamental data point. It is a duration, typically expressed in milliseconds (ms).\n5.  **Name the Value:** This specific time duration between consecutive heartbeats is most commonly called the **inter-beat interval**, or **IBI**. In the specific context of PPG, it can also be called the pulse-to-pulse interval (PPI). In the context of an ECG (electrocardiogram), the same concept is called the R-R interval. However, \"inter-beat interval\" (IBI) is the most accurate and widely used general term.\n6.  **Connect to HRV:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is not this single interval itself. Instead, HRV is a statistical calculation performed on a *sequence* of many consecutive IBIs. For example, metrics like SDNN (Standard Deviation of Normal-to-Normal intervals) or RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) are calculated from this series of IBI values to quantify how much they vary. The IBI is the raw data used to compute HRV.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinction between IBI and HRV:** It is critical not to confuse the two. The IBI is the raw time measurement between two beats. HRV is a statistical measure of the *variability* of a collection of IBIs over time. The question asks for the former.\n*   **Measurement Units:** The inter-beat interval (IBI) is a measure of time, almost always expressed in milliseconds (ms).\n*   **Contextual Terminology:** While **inter-beat interval (IBI)** is the most common and correct general term, be aware that in ECG-specific literature, you will see **R-R interval**. In PPG-specific literature, you might see **pulse-to-pulse interval (PPI)**. IBI is the best overarching term.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the value computed between heartbeats, which serves as the basis for HRV calculation, is the time duration between those beats. This value is called the inter-beat interval.\n\n<<<Inter-beat interval (IBI)>>>"
