    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the kanji 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Deconstruct the Character**\nThe character in question is 謄.\nWe must first break down this character into its constituent parts. Like many complex kanji, 謄 is a compound character made of a left part and a right part.\n*   **Left part:** 言\n*   **Right part:** 滕\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nThe radical (部首, bushu) is the component of a kanji used for classification in dictionaries. In phono-semantic compound characters (形声文字, keisei moji) like 謄, the radical usually provides the general meaning, while the other part provides the sound.\n*   The left part, 言 (gen, gon, koto), means \"word\" or \"speech\".\n*   The right part, 滕 (tō), primarily serves as the phonetic component, indicating the character's pronunciation (tō).\n*   The meaning of 謄 is \"to transcribe\" or \"to copy,\" which is directly related to \"words\" or \"writing.\"\nTherefore, the semantic component and the radical of 謄 is the left part: 言.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Name of the Radical based on its Position**\nJapanese radicals are often given specific names based on their position within a character. A radical that appears on the left side of a character is called a へん (hen).\nThe radical 言, when it appears on the left side, is known as ごんべん (gonben). The \"ben\" is a result of euphonic change (rendaku) from \"hen\".\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Radical's Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe final step is to write the name ごんべん (gonben) using Hepburn transcription.\n*   ご (go)\n*   ん (n)\n*   べ (be)\n*   ん (n)\nThe Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\". This follows the pattern of the example provided (媛 -> Onnahen).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Correctly identifying the components:** It is crucial to correctly see the character as 言 + 滕. One might mistakenly see other components if not looking closely.\n*   **Understanding radical naming conventions:** Knowing that radicals have specific names based on their position (like hen, tsukuri, kanmuri, etc.) is key. The example \"Onnahen\" for 媛 clearly indicates that this positional name is what is required.\n*   **Hepburn transcription:** Ensure the Japanese name is transcribed accurately into the standard Hepburn system.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined that the radical is 言, its positional name is Gonben, and this is the required answer.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
