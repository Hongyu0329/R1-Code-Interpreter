    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** The question asks for a specific person's name.\n    *   **What:** This person \"decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals.\" This means they took a general concept (a hallmark, a sign, an indicator) and broke it down into two distinct categories: symptoms and signals.\n    *   **Where/Which School:** The person must be a philosopher from the \"Lviv-Warsaw School,\" a highly influential movement in 20th-century Polish philosophy known for its emphasis on logical clarity and rigorous analysis.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This narrows down the possible candidates to figures like Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, and Alfred Tarski, among others.\n    *   **Hallmark / Sign:** The general concept being analyzed is that of a sign—one thing indicating the existence or presence of another. In Polish philosophy, the term *znak* (sign) or *znamię* (mark, hallmark) is relevant here.\n    *   **Symptom vs. Signal:** This is the crucial distinction. We need to find the philosopher who defined these two types of signs.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Distinction (Symptom vs. Signal):**\n    *   A **symptom** typically implies a natural, causal relationship. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire because fire *causes* smoke. A fever is a symptom of an illness. This is often called a \"natural sign.\"\n    *   A **signal** implies a conventional, rule-based, or intentional relationship. The word \"dog\" is a signal for the animal, but there is no natural connection between the sound/letters and the creature; it's a linguistic convention. A red traffic light is a signal to stop, based on an agreed-upon rule. This is often called a \"conventional sign.\"\n\n4.  **Connect Concepts to Philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   The analysis of signs, language, and meaning (semiotics) was a central concern for many members of the school.\n    *   While many touched upon it, **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is the philosopher most famously associated with this specific and influential distinction.\n    *   In his works, particularly in his seminal text *Logika pragmatyczna* (Pragmatic Logic), Ajdukiewicz performs a detailed analysis of signs (*znaki*).\n\n5.  **Elaborate on Ajdukiewicz's Contribution:**\n    *   Ajdukiewicz distinguished between what he called *oznaka* (which translates well to \"symptom\" or \"natural sign\") and *sygnał* (\"signal\" or \"conventional sign\").\n    *   **Oznaka (Symptom):** For Ajdukiewicz, something is an *oznaka* of something else if its existence allows one to infer the existence of the other based on a known natural law or empirical regularity. His example is clouds being a symptom of impending rain.\n    *   **Sygnał (Signal):** A *sygnał* is a sign created or used intentionally by someone to convey a specific thought or to cause a specific behavior in a receiver who understands the meaning-rule or convention. Linguistic signs (words) are the primary example of signals.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the general notion of a sign (or hallmark) into the categories of symptoms (natural, causal signs) and signals (conventional, intentional signs) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. This distinction is a cornerstone of his philosophy of language and semiotics.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is meticulously derived from the step-by-step analysis above.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
