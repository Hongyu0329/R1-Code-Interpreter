    "This problem asks for the conditions under which a set of three functions has a \"tripled fixed point\". This is a concept from fixed-point theory, typically studied in the context of complete metric spaces. We will use an approach based on the well-known Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, extended to a system of operators.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Problem and Clarify Notation**\n\nFirst, we must clearly define the functions and the concept of a tripled fixed point.\n\n*   **Spaces:** We are given three non-empty sets, `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n*   **Functions:** The problem specifies three functions. There appears to be a typo, as `G` is listed twice. We will assume the standard convention for such problems and analyze the case for three distinct functions, `F`, `G`, and `H`, with the given signatures:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n*   **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z`, that simultaneously satisfies the following three equations:\n    1.  `x = F(x, y, z)`\n    2.  `y = G(y, x, y)`\n    3.  `z = H(z, y, x)`\n\n**Careful Point:** The primary challenge is to find a set of sufficient conditions on the spaces `X, Y, Z` and the functions `F, G, H` that guarantees the existence (and uniqueness) of such a point `(x, y, z)`.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Mathematical Framework**\n\nThe most common framework for solving such problems is the theory of metric spaces. The core result we will adapt is the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, which requires a complete metric space and a contraction mapping.\n\n*   **Condition on Spaces:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **complete metric spaces**. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n*   **Product Space:** We can consider the Cartesian product `W = X × Y × Z` as a single metric space. We can define a metric `d_W` on this space, for example, the sum metric:\n    `d_W((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    If `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces, then the product space `(W, d_W)` is also a complete metric space.\n\n**Careful Point:** The completeness of the spaces is a fundamental prerequisite. Without it, a sequence of points might \"converge\" to a limit that is not in the space, and a fixed point may not exist.\n\n**Step 3: Define a Combined Operator and Apply Banach's Theorem**\n\nThe key idea is to combine the three functions `F, G, H` into a single operator `T` on the product space `W`.\n\n*   **Operator Definition:** Let's define an operator `T: W → W` as follows:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n*   **Equivalence:** A point `(x, y, z) ∈ W` is a fixed point of `T` if `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`. This is precisely the definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n*   **Applying Banach's Theorem:** The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that if `W` is a complete metric space and `T` is a **contraction mapping** on `W`, then `T` has a unique fixed point.\n\n**Careful Point:** The problem now reduces to finding the conditions on `F, G, H` that make the combined operator `T` a contraction mapping on `W`.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Contraction Conditions**\n\nA mapping `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `p₁, p₂ ∈ W`, `d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d_W(p₁, p₂)`. Let's translate this into conditions on `F, G, H`.\n\nLet `p₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` be two points in `W`.\nThe distance between their images under `T` is:\n`d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂)) = d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n\nTo ensure this is a contraction, `F, G, H` must satisfy a set of mixed Lipschitz-type conditions. Let's assume there exist non-negative constants `aᵢ, bᵢ, cᵢ` such that for all `x₁,x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁,y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁,z₂ ∈ Z`:\n\n1.  `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ a₁·d_X(x₁,x₂) + b₁·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + c₁·d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n2.  `d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ a₂·d_X(x₁,x₂) + b₂·d_Y(y₁,y₂)`\n3.  `d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ a₃·d_X(x₁,x₂) + b₃·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + c₃·d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nNow, we substitute these inequalities back into the expression for `d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂))`:\n`d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ (a₁d_X+b₁d_Y+c₁d_Z) + (a₂d_X+b₂d_Y) + (a₃d_X+b₃d_Y+c₃d_Z)`\n\nGrouping terms by metric:\n`d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ (a₁+a₂+a₃)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (b₁+b₂+b₃)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (c₁+c₃)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nLet `k_x = a₁+a₂+a₃`, `k_y = b₁+b₂+b₃`, and `k_z = c₁+c₃`. Let `k = max(k_x, k_y, k_z)`.\nThen:\n`d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k·d_X(x₁,x₂) + k·d_Y(y₁,y₂) + k·d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n`d_W(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k · (d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂)) = k · d_W(p₁, p₂)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, we need the constant `k` to be strictly less than 1.\n\n**Careful Point:** The specific structure of the arguments for `G` and `H` is crucial. For `G`, there is no `z` dependence, and for `H`, there is no `z` dependence in its `d_Y` and `d_X` component bounds. This simplifies the final condition slightly.\n\n### Final Answer: Summary of Conditions\n\nThe functions `F: X*Y*Z→X`, `G: Y*X*Y→Y`, and `H: Z*Y*X→Z` have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point if the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **(Complete Metric Spaces):** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n\n2.  **(Contraction Conditions):** There exist non-negative constants `a₁, a₂, a₃, b₁, b₂, b₃, c₁, c₃` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following three inequalities hold:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁·d_X(x₁, x₂) + b₁·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₁·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ a₂·d_X(x₁, x₂) + b₂·d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ a₃·d_X(x₁, x₂) + b₃·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₃·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n3.  **(Overall Contraction):** The sum of these constants for each dimension must define a contraction factor less than 1. Specifically, if we let `k = max(a₁+a₂+a₃, b₁+b₂+b₃, c₁+c₃)`, then we must have `k < 1`.\n\nUnder these conditions, the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem guarantees that the combined operator `T` has a unique fixed point, which is the unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n1.  The spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n2.  The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` satisfy a set of contraction-type inequalities. That is, there exist non-negative constants (`a₁`, `a₂`, `a₃`, `b₁`, `b₂`, `b₃`, `c₁`, `c₃`) such that for all relevant inputs:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ a₁d_X(x₁,x₂) + b₁d_Y(y₁,y₂) + c₁d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ a₂d_X(x₁,x₂) + b₂d_Y(y₁,y₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ a₃d_X(x₁,x₂) + b₃d_Y(y₁,y₂) + c₃d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n3.  The maximum of the sums of the coefficients for each dimension is less than 1. That is, `max(a₁+a₂+a₃, b₁+b₂+b₃, c₁+c₃) < 1`.>>>"
