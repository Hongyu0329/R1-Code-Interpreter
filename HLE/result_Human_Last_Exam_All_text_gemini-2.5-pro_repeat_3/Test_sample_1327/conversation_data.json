    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe user provides a sequence of numbers and asks to find the next number in the sequence from a given set of options.\nThe sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nThe options are: A. 291, B. 285, C. 171, D. 167\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between consecutive numbers**\nFirst, let's try to find a simple arithmetic or geometric relationship.\n*   **Check for a common difference (Arithmetic Progression):**\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The differences (9, 12, 28, 68) are not constant, so it's not a simple arithmetic sequence.\n\n*   **Check for a common ratio (Geometric Progression):**\n    *   11 / 2 = 5.5\n    *   23 / 11 ≈ 2.09\n    *   51 / 23 ≈ 2.21\n    The ratios are not constant, so it's not a simple geometric sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a more complex pattern**\nSince simple progressions do not fit, let's explore more complex recursive patterns. A common type involves multiplication and addition/subtraction, such as `Term(n+1) = a * Term(n) + b`. The numbers are roughly doubling, so let's try a rule based on multiplying by 2.\n\n*   **Let's test the pattern `Term(n+1) = 2 * Term(n) + C` where C is some number.**\n    *   From 2 to 11: 11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n    *   From 11 to 23: 23 = 2 * 11 + 1\n    *   From 23 to 51: 51 = 2 * 23 + 5\n    *   From 51 to 119: 119 = 2 * 51 + 17\n\n*   **Analyze the added numbers.**\n    The sequence of added numbers is {7, 1, 5, 17}. This sequence does not have an obvious simple pattern. This suggests that the pattern might not apply to the very first term, or the pattern is even more complex.\n\n*   **Re-examine the pattern, starting from the second term.**\n    Let's look at the rule `Term(n+1) = 2 * Term(n) + C(n)` starting from the calculation of the third term (23).\n    *   To get 23: `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`. The added number `C(1)` is 1.\n    *   To get 51: `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`. The added number `C(2)` is 5.\n    *   To get 119: `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`. The added number `C(3)` is 17.\n\n*   **Find the pattern in the sequence of added numbers {1, 5, 17, ...}.**\n    Let's find the differences between the terms in this new sequence.\n    *   Difference between 5 and 1: 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Difference between 17 and 5: 17 - 5 = 12\n    The differences are {4, 12}. This is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 (4 * 3 = 12).\n\n**Step 4: Use the discovered pattern to find the next term**\n*   **Predict the next difference.**\n    Following the pattern of the differences {4, 12, ...}, the next difference should be 12 * 3 = 36.\n\n*   **Predict the next added number.**\n    The next term in the sequence of added numbers {1, 5, 17, ...} will be the previous term plus the next difference: 17 + 36 = 53.\n\n*   **Calculate the missing term in the original sequence.**\n    The next term in the original sequence is found by applying the rule with the new added number we found.\n    *   Next Term = 2 * (Last Term) + (Next Added Number)\n    *   Next Term = 2 * 119 + 53\n    *   Next Term = 238 + 53\n    *   Next Term = 291\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe calculated next term is 291. This matches option A.\n\n**Summary of the pattern:**\nThe sequence `T(n)` is defined by the rule `T(n+1) = 2 * T(n) + C(n-1)` for n ≥ 2.\nThe sequence `C(n)` is {1, 5, 17, 53, ...}.\nThe differences in `C(n)` form a geometric progression {4, 12, 36, ...} with a common ratio of 3.\n\n<<<A>>>"
