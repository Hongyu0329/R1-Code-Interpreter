    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\n*   **Graph:** We start with a complete graph $K_n$, where $n=35$. A complete graph has an edge between every pair of distinct vertices. The total number of vertices is 35.\n*   **Covering:** We need to find a collection (a family) of bipartite graphs, let's call them $G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k$. The \"covering\" condition means that every edge in $K_{35}$ must be present in at least one of these bipartite graphs $G_i$.\n*   **Bipartite Graphs:** Each graph $G_i$ in our family must be bipartite. This means its vertex set, $V(G_i)$, can be partitioned into two disjoint sets, say $A_i$ and $B_i$, such that every edge in $G_i$ connects a vertex in $A_i$ to one in $B_i$. The vertices of these bipartite graphs are taken from the vertex set of $K_{35}$.\n*   **Objective:** We want to minimize the *total number of vertices* in this family of graphs. This is the sum of the number of vertices in each graph: $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(G_i)|$.\n\n**2. Identifying the Core Mathematical Problem**\n\nThis is a well-known problem in extremal graph theory. Let $f(n)$ be the minimum possible value for $\\sum |V(G_i)|$ for a covering of $K_n$. The problem can be rephrased in the language of set theory:\n\n*   For each graph $G_i$ with its bipartition $A_i \\cup B_i$, and for each vertex $v$ of $K_n$, we can define which partition $v$ belongs to if it's in the graph $G_i$.\n*   The condition that an edge $(u,v)$ is covered by the family means there must be at least one graph, say $G_j$, where $u$ and $v$ are in different parts of the partition (e.g., $u \\in A_j$ and $v \\in B_j$).\n*   Minimizing $\\sum |V(G_i)|$ is equivalent to minimizing the sum, over all vertices $v$ of $K_n$, of the number of graphs $G_i$ that $v$ belongs to.\n\n**3. The Relevant Theorem (Peck's Theorem)**\n\nThis problem was solved by G. W. Peck in 1984. The theorem states that the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite subgraphs covering all edges of $K_n$ is given by the formula:\n\n**Minimum total vertices = $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$**\n\nwhere $\\lceil x \\rceil$ is the ceiling function, which gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.\n\n**4. Applying the Theorem to this Specific Case**\n\nWe are given $n = 35$. We need to plug this value into the formula.\n\n*   **Step 4.1: Calculate $\\log_2 n$**\n    We need to find $\\log_2 35$. We can determine its range by looking at the powers of 2:\n    *   $2^5 = 32$\n    *   $2^6 = 64$\n    Since $32 < 35 \\le 64$, we can take the logarithm base 2 of the inequality:\n    $\\log_2(32) < \\log_2(35) \\le \\log_2(64)$\n    $5 < \\log_2(35) \\le 6$\n\n*   **Step 4.2: Calculate the ceiling $\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$**\n    From the inequality above, the value of $\\log_2 35$ is strictly greater than 5 and at most 6. The ceiling function rounds this value up to the next integer.\n    $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$\n\n*   **Step 4.3: Calculate the final result**\n    Now, we multiply this value by $n$:\n    Minimum total vertices = $35 \\times 6$\n    $35 \\times 6 = 210$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"number of vertices\"**: The question asks for the sum of the number of vertices in each graph of the family ($\\sum|V_i|$), not the number of unique vertices used across all graphs ($|\\cup V_i|$). The formula $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ correctly addresses this specific interpretation.\n2.  **Covering vs. Decomposition**: The problem requires a \"covering\", where edges can be in multiple bipartite graphs. A \"decomposition\" (or partition) would require each edge to be in exactly one graph. The result by Peck holds for the more general case of covering.\n3.  **Ceiling Function**: It is crucial to use the ceiling function ($\\lceil \\cdot \\rceil$) and not the floor function or simple rounding. For $n=32$, $\\log_2 32 = 5$, so the factor would be 5. For any $n$ from 33 to 64, the factor will be 6. Getting this part of the calculation wrong would lead to an incorrect answer.\n4.  **Construction Intuition**: The formula is not arbitrary. It comes from a specific construction. One can achieve this bound by assigning a unique binary string of length $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ to each of the $n$ vertices. Then, for each of the $k$ bit positions, a bipartite graph is created where the partition is based on whether a vertex's assigned string has a 0 or a 1 at that position. This construction uses $k$ bipartite graphs, each with $n$ vertices, for a total of $nk$ vertices. The theorem proves that you cannot do any better than this.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **n:** 35\n*   **Formula:** $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$\n*   **Calculation of log term:** $2^5 = 32 < 35 \\le 64 = 2^6$, so $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n*   **Final Result:** $35 \\times 6 = 210$.\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs is 210.\n\n<<<210>>>"
