    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**1. Understand the System and Find Equilibrium Points**\n\nThe system is given by:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)^3(1-u(t))$$\n$$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nWe are interested in the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$. Equilibrium points (or critical points) are points $(u, d)$ where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are zero.\n\nFirst, set $u'(t) = 0$:\n$$(u-1)u^2 = 0$$\nThis gives us two possible values for $u$: $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow, for each value of $u$, we set $d'(t) = 0$ to find the corresponding value(s) of $d$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $$d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - (0)^3(1-0) = 0$$\n    $$2d^2 = 0$$\n    This gives $d=0$. So, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $$d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - (1)^3(1-1) = 0$$\n    $$2d^2 + 2d = 0$$\n    $$2d(d+1) = 0$$\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, two more equilibrium points are **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nIn summary, the equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**2. Analyze the Stability of the Equilibrium Points**\n\nTo understand the behavior of trajectories near these points, we linearize the system by finding the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d)$:\n$$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (-3+10u)d - 3u^2+4u^3 & 4d-3u+5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $$J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ 0-3+4 & 0-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, **(1, 0) is an unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $$J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ (-3+10)(-1)-3+4 & 4(-1)-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7-3+4 & -4+2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $$J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    Linearization fails. This is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point.\n\n**3. Identify the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. Separatrices are often the stable and/or unstable manifolds of saddle points. We have a saddle point at (1, -1), so its stable and unstable manifolds will be separatrices for the system.\n\nLet's look for an invariant curve, which is a curve that is a union of trajectories. Such a curve, if it passes through a saddle point, must be part of its stable or unstable manifold. We can test for a simple algebraic curve of the form $d = f(u)$. If $d=f(u)$ is an invariant curve, it must satisfy the differential equation for the trajectories:\n$$\\frac{d(d)}{dt} = f'(u) \\frac{du}{dt}$$\n\nLet's test the simple parabolic curve $d = -u^2$, which notably passes through two of the equilibrium points: (0, 0) and (1, -1).\n\nIf $d = -u^2$, then the chain rule gives its time derivative as:\n$$d' = -2u \\cdot u'$$\nSubstitute the expression for $u'$:\n$$d' = -2u \\cdot (u-1)u^2 = -2u^3(u-1) = 2u^3 - 2u^4$$\n\nNow, let's substitute $d = -u^2$ into the original equation for $d'(t)$:\n$$d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$$\n$$d' = 2u^4 + (3u^3 - 5u^4) - (u^3 - u^4)$$\n$$d' = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$$\n$$d' = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$$\n$$d' = -2u^4 + 2u^3$$\n\nComparing the two expressions for $d'$, we see they are identical: $2u^3 - 2u^4 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\nThis confirms that the curve **$d = -u^2$** is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe curve $d = -u^2$ is a trajectory (or union of trajectories) that connects the saddle point (1, -1) to the equilibrium point (0, 0). As it is an invariant manifold passing through a saddle point, it forms part of that saddle's stable or unstable manifold. Such a curve acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane into regions with different long-term behaviors. Specifically, for trajectories in the strip $0 < u < 1$, this curve separates those that converge to the origin (0, 0) from those where $d \\to \\infty$. Therefore, $d = -u^2$ is the separatrix we are looking for.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
