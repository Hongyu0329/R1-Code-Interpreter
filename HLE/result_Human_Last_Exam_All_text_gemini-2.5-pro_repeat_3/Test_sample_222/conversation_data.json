    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Given Information:**\n    *   `x(n)` and `h(n)` are 4-point sequences.\n    *   `X(k)` is the 4-point DFT of `x(n)`, and `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`.\n    *   `H(k)` is the 4-point DFT of `h(n)`, and `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`.\n2.  **Goal:**\n    *   Find the 4-point DFT for the new 8-point sequence `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Sequence Length Mismatch:** The core of the problem is finding a \"4-point DFT\" for an 8-point sequence. This is a non-standard operation that implies time-domain aliasing.\n2.  **Time-Domain Aliasing:** To compute an N-point DFT of a 2N-point sequence, one must first create an N-point sequence by aliasing (wrapping and adding) the original sequence. If `y(n)` is the 8-point sequence, the corresponding 4-point sequence `y_4(n)` is given by:\n    `y_4(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n3.  **DFT Property for Aliasing:** A crucial DFT property states that the DFT of the aliased sequence `y_4(n)` is equivalent to taking the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`. If `Y(k)` is the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, then the desired 4-point DFT, let's call it `Z(k)`, is given by:\n    `Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    Therefore, we need to find `Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)`.\n4.  **Decimation-in-Time Property:** The sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`. This means the even-indexed elements of `y(n)` are `x(n)` and the odd-indexed elements are `h(n)`. The decimation-in-time radix-2 FFT algorithm gives us a direct way to compute the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` from the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` without calculating the time-domain sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Relate the 8-point DFT Y(k) to X(k) and H(k)**\n\nBased on the decimation-in-time property, the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` of the interleaved sequence `y(n)` is related to the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` by the following \"butterfly\" equations:\n\n*   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`  for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n*   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\nwhere `W_8^k = e^(-j*2*pi*k/8)` is the 8-point DFT twiddle factor.\n\n**Step 2: Determine which components of Y(k) are needed**\n\nAs noted in the careful points, the required 4-point DFT is `Z(k) = [Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)]`. We only need to calculate these four values.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the necessary twiddle factors**\n\nWe need `W_8^0` and `W_8^2` for our calculations.\n*   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*2*pi*2/8) = e^(-j*pi/2) = -j`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the components of the final DFT**\n\n*   **Calculate Z(0) = Y(0):**\n    Use the formula `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` with `k=0`.\n    `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculate Z(1) = Y(2):**\n    Use the formula `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` with `k=2`.\n    `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **Calculate Z(2) = Y(4):**\n    Use the formula `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` with `k=0`.\n    `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculate Z(3) = Y(6):**\n    Use the formula `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` with `k=2`.\n    `Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j)(1) = -1 + j`\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the final result**\n\nThe 4-point DFT is `Z(k) = [Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)]`.\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n`Z(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
