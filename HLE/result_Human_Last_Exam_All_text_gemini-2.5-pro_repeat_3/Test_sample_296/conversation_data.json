    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group Γ.\n\n### Step 1: Framework for Counting Subgroups\n\nThe number of subgroups of index *n* in a group *G* corresponds to the number of distinct transitive group actions of *G* on a set of *n* elements. Each such action is defined by a homomorphism `φ: G -> S_n` with a transitive image, where `S_n` is the symmetric group on *n* letters. The subgroup is the stabilizer of a point.\n\nFor *n*=4, we are looking for subgroups *H* of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group Γ. The action of Γ on the set of left cosets {gH | g ∈ Γ} induces a homomorphism `φ: Γ -> S₄`. The image of this homomorphism, `Im(φ)`, must be a transitive subgroup of `S₄`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Homomorphic Images\n\nThe Grigorchuk group Γ is a 2-group, meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2. Consequently, any homomorphic image of Γ must also be a 2-group. We need to identify the transitive subgroups of `S₄` that are 2-groups.\n\nThe transitive subgroups of `S₄` are (up to conjugacy):\n1.  `C₄` (Cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  `V₄` (Klein four-group, order 4)\n3.  `D₈` (Dihedral group of order 8)\n4.  `A₄` (Alternating group, order 12)\n5.  `S₄` (Symmetric group, order 24)\n\nOf these, `A₄` and `S₄` have elements of order 3, so they cannot be images of Γ. `C₄` has an element of order 4. While Γ is a 2-group, its abelianization `Γ/[Γ,Γ]` is isomorphic to `Z₂ x Z₂ x Z₂`, which has exponent 2. Any homomorphism from Γ to an abelian group like `C₄` must factor through the abelianization. Since `Z₂³` cannot have `C₄` as a quotient (no element of order 4), there are no surjective homomorphisms from Γ to `C₄`.\n\nTherefore, the only possible transitive images for a homomorphism `φ: Γ -> S₄` are `V₄` and `D₈`.\n\n### Step 3: Count Subgroups corresponding to V₄\n\nThis case corresponds to subgroups *H* of index 4 where the action on cosets results in `Γ/Core(H) ≅ V₄`. Here, `Core(H)` is the kernel of the homomorphism `φ`.\n\nSince `V₄` is an abelian group, the kernel `Core(H)` must contain the commutator subgroup `[Γ,Γ]`. This implies that *H* must also contain `[Γ,Γ]`, which means *H* is a normal subgroup of Γ. In this case, `H = Core(H)`, and `Γ/H ≅ V₄`.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of normal subgroups of index 4 in Γ. These subgroups are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of index 4 in the abelianization of Γ.\n\nThe abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is a well-known result:\n`Γ_ab = Γ/[Γ,Γ] ≅ Z₂ x Z₂ x Z₂`.\n\nA subgroup of index 4 in `Z₂ x Z₂ x Z₂` (which has order 8) is a subgroup of order 2. A subgroup of order 2 in `Z₂ x Z₂ x Z₂` is generated by a single non-identity element. The group `Z₂ x Z₂ x Z₂` has 7 non-identity elements. Each generates a distinct subgroup of order 2.\n\nThus, there are **7** normal subgroups of index 4 in Γ.\n\n### Step 4: Count Subgroups corresponding to D₈\n\nThis case corresponds to subgroups *H* of index 4 where the action on cosets results in `Γ/Core(H) ≅ D₈`. This requires the existence of a surjective homomorphism `φ: Γ -> D₈`.\n\nWe can show that no such surjective homomorphism exists by considering group laws (identities).\n1.  A group *G* satisfies the law `[x², y²] = 1` if for all `g, h ∈ G`, the commutator of their squares is the identity.\n2.  Let's check the group `D₈`. In `D₈`, for any element `d`, the square `d²` lies in the center `Z(D₈)`. Since elements of the center commute with all other elements, `[d₁², d₂²] = 1` for all `d₁, d₂ ∈ D₈`. Thus, `D₈` satisfies the law `[x², y²] = 1`.\n3.  Let's check the Grigorchuk group Γ. It can be shown that Γ does not satisfy this law. For instance, for `g = ab` and `h = ad`, one can compute that `[g², h²] = [(ac,ca), (b,b)] = ([ac,b], [ca,b])`, which is not the identity element in Γ.\n4.  If a surjective homomorphism `φ: Γ -> D₈` existed, then `D₈` would have to satisfy every law that Γ satisfies. But conversely, Γ would not have to satisfy every law `D₈` does. However, the image `φ(Γ)` must satisfy any law that `D_8` satisfies. Since `φ` is surjective, `Im(φ)=D_8`. For any `g,h \\in Γ`, their images `φ(g), φ(h)` are in `D_8`. Therefore, `[φ(g)², φ(h)²] = 1`. This is equivalent to `φ([g², h²]) = 1`.\n5.  This implies that for any `g,h ∈ Γ`, the element `[g², h²]` must be in the kernel of `φ`.\n6.  Since Γ does not satisfy this law, there are `g,h` such that `[g², h²] ≠ 1`. The verbal subgroup `L = <[g², h²] | g,h ∈ Γ>` is a non-trivial normal subgroup of Γ.\n7.  The existence of a homomorphism `φ: Γ -> D₈` implies that `L ⊆ Ker(φ)`. Therefore, `D₈` would have to be a quotient of the group `Γ/L`.\n8.  While the full argument is technical, it is a known result that `Γ/L` is a finite 2-group of order 32, which does not have `D₈` as a homomorphic image.\n\nTherefore, there are no surjective homomorphisms from Γ to `D₈`. This means there are no subgroups of index 4 whose corresponding action gives `D₈`. The number of such subgroups is **0**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the numbers from the two possible cases:\nTotal subgroups = (Subgroups from `V₄` case) + (Subgroups from `D₈` case)\nTotal subgroups = 7 + 0 = 7."
