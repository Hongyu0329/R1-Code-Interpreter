    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that wrap around each other. Their amino acid sequences typically follow a seven-residue repeating pattern, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The positions within this repeat have specific chemical properties that dictate the structure:\n\n*   **Positions `a` and `d`:** These are the core positions. They are almost always occupied by hydrophobic residues (like Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Alanine). These residues interlock in a \"knobs-into-holes\" fashion, forming a stable hydrophobic core that holds the helices together.\n*   **Positions `e` and `g`:** These are flanking positions, often occupied by charged or polar residues (like Lysine, Arginine, Glutamate, Aspartate, Glutamine). They can form electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices, contributing to the stability and specificity of the oligomer.\n*   **Positions `b`, `c`, and `f`:** These positions are exposed to the solvent and are typically occupied by hydrophilic residues.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Given Sequence**\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to align this sequence to the `abcdefg` pattern. The key is to place the bulky hydrophobic residues (I, L, W, A) into the core `a` and `d` positions. A repeating pattern of `(Hydrophobic)-X-X-(Hydrophobic)` is the main clue.\n\nLet's test an alignment. If we start the first full heptad at the first Alanine (A), we get the following registration:\nSequence: `G E I` **`A Q S L K E I`** **`A K S L K E I`** **`A W S L K E I`** **`A Q S L K G`**\nPositions: `e f g` **`a b c d e f g`** **`a b c d e f g`** **`a b c d e f g`** **`a b c d e f g`** (last heptad is incomplete)\n\nLet's list the residues at the key positions based on this alignment:\n*   **`a` positions:** A, A, A, A (Alanine)\n*   **`d` positions:** L, L, L, L (Leucine)\n*   **`e` positions:** E, E, E, Q (Glutamate, Glutamine)\n*   **`g` positions:** I, I, I, K (Isoleucine, Lysine)\n\nThis alignment is chemically very sensible:\n*   The `a` and `d` positions are consistently hydrophobic, forming a perfect hydrophobic seam.\n*   The `e` positions are charged/polar, as expected.\n*   The `g` positions are mostly hydrophobic (Isoleucine), which is a critical clue.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Packing Efficiency and \"Knobs-into-Holes\" Interactions for Different Oligomeric States**\n\nThe identity of the amino acids at the `a`, `d`, and `g` positions strongly influences the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.).\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** In a standard dimer, the `a` and `d` residues form the entire hydrophobic core. The `g` position is located at the edge of this core, largely exposed to the solvent. Placing a large hydrophobic residue like Isoleucine at the `g` position would be energetically unfavorable due to exposure to water.\n\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Similar to a dimer, the `g` position in a trimer is also significantly solvent-exposed. Therefore, a hydrophobic residue at the `g` position is also disfavored in trimers.\n\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** In a tetramer, the helices pack together differently. The packing is less angled than in a dimer, which changes the relative positions of the side chains. Crucially, the **`g` position rotates into the hydrophobic core**, where it can pack against the `a` position of an adjacent helix (`g` packs with `a'`). This means a hydrophobic residue at the `g` position is not only tolerated but *strongly favors* the formation of a tetramer because it can be buried in the core, contributing to the overall stability.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Oligomeric State**\n\nLet's evaluate our sequence based on the analysis above:\n*   **`a` positions = Alanine (small hydrophobic)**\n*   **`d` positions = Leucine (large hydrophobic)**\n*   **`g` positions = Isoleucine (large hydrophobic)**\n\nThe most telling feature is the presence of the large hydrophobic residue **Isoleucine (I) at three of the four `g` positions**. This arrangement would be highly unstable in a dimer or a trimer due to solvent exposure. However, it is a classic signature of a **tetrameric coiled-coil**, as this structure allows the hydrophobic `g`-position side chains to be buried within the central core, maximizing favorable hydrophobic interactions.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is designed to form a 4-helix bundle.\n\n<<<C>>>"
