After applying gate Q to the first ququint of the entangled pair and measuring it, the final state of the two-ququint system will be one of the following, with the specified probabilities:
1.  With probability 2/10 (or 1/5), the measurement outcome for A is $|0\rangle$, and the system collapses to the state: $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
2.  With probability 2/10 (or 1/5), the measurement outcome for A is $|1\rangle$, and the system collapses to the state: $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
3.  With probability 3/10, the measurement outcome for A is $|2\rangle$, and the system collapses to the state: $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
4.  With probability 2/10 (or 1/5), the measurement outcome for A is $|3\rangle$, and the system collapses to the state: $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5.  With probability 1/10, the measurement outcome for A is $|4\rangle$, and the system collapses to the state: $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
