    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object $X$\nLet $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n*   $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is the 3-dimensional complex projective space. It is a real 6-dimensional manifold.\n*   A hypersurface is defined by the zero set of a single polynomial equation.\n*   \"Quintic\" means this polynomial is homogeneous of degree 5.\n*   \"Smooth\" means the resulting manifold has no singularities.\n*   $X$ is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ of complex dimension $3-1=2$. Thus, $X$ is a complex surface.\n*   As a real manifold, the dimension of $X$ is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\n### Step 2: Basic topological properties of $X$\nWe can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem to understand the low-dimensional homotopy groups of $X$.\n*   **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem (Homotopy version):** If $X$ is a smooth complex submanifold of dimension $n$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^N$, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^N$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^N)$ for $k < n$ and a surjection for $k=n$.\n*   In our case, $X$ is a complex surface ($n=2$) in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ ($N=3$). So the inclusion $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ for $k < 2$.\n*   We know that $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected, i.e., $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$.\n*   Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. This means $X$ is simply connected.\n*   Also, $\\pi_0(X) \\cong \\pi_0(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$ (path-connected).\n\n### Step 3: Computing the Betti numbers of $X$\nThe rank of the homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ can be determined using rational homotopy theory, which requires knowing the rational cohomology of $X$. We first compute the Betti numbers $b_k(X) = \\text{rank}(H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = \\dim(H_k(X; \\mathbb{Q}))$.\n*   Since $X$ is a compact, connected, 4-dimensional manifold: $b_0(X) = 1$.\n*   Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, the first homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$, so $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. Thus, $b_1(X) = 0$.\n*   By PoincarÃ© Duality for a compact orientable 4-manifold (complex manifolds are always orientable), $b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X)$.\n    *   $b_4(X) = b_0(X) = 1$.\n    *   $b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\n*   To find $b_2(X)$, we can compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^4 (-1)^k b_k(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n*   The Euler characteristic can be computed by integrating the top Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$. We use the adjunction formula. The short exact sequence of vector bundles on $X$ is:\n    $0 \\to T_X \\to T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X \\to N_X \\to 0$\n    where $T_X$ is the tangent bundle of $X$, $T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X$ is the tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ restricted to $X$, and $N_X$ is the normal bundle of $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n*   For a hypersurface of degree $d=5$, the normal bundle is the restriction of the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(5)$ to $X$, so $N_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(5)$.\n*   The total Chern class is multiplicative: $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X) = c(T_X) \\cdot c(N_X)$. Let $h$ be the hyperplane class on $X$ (the restriction of the hyperplane class of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$).\n    *   $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}) = (1+H)^4$, so $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X) = (1+h)^4 = 1 + 4h + 6h^2$. (Higher powers $h^k$ are zero for $k > 2 = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} X$).\n    *   $c(N_X) = c(\\mathcal{O}_X(5)) = 1 + c_1(\\mathcal{O}_X(5)) = 1 + 5h$.\n*   Therefore, $c(T_X) = \\frac{c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X)}{c(N_X)} = \\frac{1+4h+6h^2}{1+5h} = (1+4h+6h^2)(1-5h+25h^2-\\dots) = 1 - h + (6-20+25)h^2 + \\dots = 1 - h + 11h^2$.\n*   The second Chern class of $X$ is $c_2(T_X) = 11h^2$.\n*   The Euler characteristic is $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(T_X) = \\int_X 11h^2 = 11 \\int_X h^2$.\n*   The integral $\\int_X h^2$ is the self-intersection of a hyperplane section, which equals the degree of the hypersurface $X$. So $\\int_X h^2 = 5$.\n*   $\\chi(X) = 11 \\times 5 = 55$.\n*   Using $\\chi(X) = 2 + b_2$, we find $b_2(X) = 55 - 2 = 53$.\n*   So, the Betti numbers of $X$ are $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4) = (1, 0, 53, 0, 1)$.\n\n### Step 4: Using Rational Homotopy Theory\nThe rank of an abelian group $G$ is the dimension of the rational vector space $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$. We want to find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$. Rational homotopy theory connects the rational homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ with the rational cohomology algebra $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n*   For a simply connected space, one can construct a minimal Sullivan model, which is a commutative differential graded algebra $(\\Lambda V, d)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ whose cohomology is isomorphic to $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Q})$. The graded vector space $V = \\bigoplus_{k \\ge 2} V^k$ is related to the rational homotopy groups by $\\dim(V^k) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_k(X))$.\n*   For a simply connected, closed 4-manifold like $X$, there is a well-known result that describes the structure of its minimal model.\n    *   $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V^2$, so $\\dim(V^2) = b_2(X) = 53$.\n    *   The differential maps $d: V^3 \\to \\Lambda^2 V^2$.\n    *   There is a short exact sequence:\n        $0 \\to V^3 \\to \\Lambda^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\xrightarrow{\\cup} H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to 0$.\n    *   This sequence tells us that $V^3$ is isomorphic to the kernel of the cup product map $\\cup: \\Lambda^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Rank of $\\pi_3(X)$\nWe can now compute the dimension of $V^3$, which equals the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n*   We have the vector spaces $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}^{53}$ and $H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   The cup product map is a linear map $\\cup: \\Lambda^2(\\mathbb{Q}^{53}) \\to \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   The dimension of the domain is $\\dim(\\Lambda^2(\\mathbb{Q}^{53})) = \\binom{53}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 53 \\times 26 = 1378$.\n*   The cup product map is not the zero map. For example, the hyperplane class $h \\in H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ has a non-zero self-intersection $h \\cup h \\in H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$, since its integral is 5.\n*   Since the target space $\\mathbb{Q}$ is one-dimensional, any non-zero linear map into it must be surjective.\n*   By the rank-nullity theorem, $\\dim(\\Lambda^2 H^2) = \\dim(\\ker(\\cup)) + \\dim(\\text{im}(\\cup))$.\n*   $1378 = \\dim(\\ker(\\cup)) + 1$.\n*   Therefore, $\\dim(\\ker(\\cup)) = 1377$.\n*   From the exact sequence in Step 4, $\\dim(V^3) = \\dim(\\ker(\\cup)) = 1377$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is equal to $\\dim(V^3)$.\nRank of $\\pi_3(X) = 1377$.\n\n<<<1377>>>"
