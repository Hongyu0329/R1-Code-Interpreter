The edges of the image are progressively smoothed, with sharp corners being rounded off and small features being removed. This process is analogous to a geometric flow that reduces the total length of the edges. Convex shapes shrink and concave regions are filled in. As $t \rightarrow \infty$, this leads to the annihilation of any closed or curved boundaries. Unless the initial image consists solely of perfectly straight edges dividing the entire frame, the image will converge to a constant state (either all black or all white), and thus all edges will eventually disappear.
