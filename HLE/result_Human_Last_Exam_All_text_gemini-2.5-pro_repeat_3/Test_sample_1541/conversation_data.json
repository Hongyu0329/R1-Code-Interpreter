    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate its memory usage.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary task is to reorder the numbers in a given sum string (e.g., \"3+2+1+4+1\") so that they are in non-decreasing order (e.g., \"1+1+2+3+4\"). The numbers involved are only 1, 2, 3, and 4. The secondary and most crucial goal is to design a C program that uses the minimum possible amount of memory for its variables.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Algorithm Choice:**\n    *   A straightforward approach would be to read the entire string, parse the numbers into an integer array, sort that array using a standard library function like `qsort`, and then print the sorted numbers with '+' signs.\n    *   However, this approach is not memory-efficient. If the input string is 1000 characters long, it would require a `char` array of size 1001 (for the null terminator) and an `int` array of up to 501 elements (since numbers and '+' alternate). This would consume over 3 Kilobytes of memory (`1001 * sizeof(char) + 501 * sizeof(int)` ≈ 1001 + 2004 = 3005 bytes).\n    *   A much better algorithm for this specific problem is **Counting Sort**. Since the set of numbers is very small and fixed (1, 2, 3, 4), we can simply count the occurrences of each number and then generate the output string from these counts.\n\n3.  **Designing the Memory-Efficient Algorithm:**\n    *   **Avoid Storing the Full Input:** To save memory, we should avoid reading the entire input string into a buffer. We can process the input one character at a time using the `getchar()` function in a loop. This eliminates the need for a large `char` array (like `char s[1001]`).\n    *   **Use Counters:** We will use a small array to store the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. An array of size 5 is perfect, where `counts[1]` holds the frequency of '1', `counts[2]` holds the frequency of '2', and so on. `counts[0]` will be unused.\n    *   **Generate Output from Counts:** After reading the whole input and populating our counters, we can iterate from 1 to 4. For each number `i`, we print it `counts[i]` times. We'll need a simple flag variable to ensure we print '+' signs between numbers but not before the very first number.\n\n### Careful Points and Variable Memory Calculation\n\nTo find the total memory (`m`), we must select the smallest appropriate data type for each variable in our memory-efficient program and sum up their sizes. We will assume standard sizes on a typical competitive programming platform (`sizeof(char)`=1, `sizeof(short)`=2, `sizeof(int)`=4).\n\n1.  **Counters Array (`counts`):**\n    *   The input string is at most 1000 characters long. The numbers appear at indices 0, 2, 4, etc. The maximum number of terms is `(1000 + 1) / 2 = 500.5`, which means a maximum of 501 numbers.\n    *   Therefore, any single counter can hold a value up to 501.\n    *   A `signed char` (range -128 to 127) or `unsigned char` (range 0 to 255) is too small.\n    *   A `short int` (range -32,768 to 32,767) is sufficient.\n    *   Variable: `short counts[5];`\n    *   Memory: `5 * sizeof(short)` = 5 * 2 = **10 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Input Character Variable (`c`):**\n    *   We use `getchar()` to read characters. A crucial detail is that `getchar()` returns an `int`, not a `char`. This is to allow it to return special values like `EOF` (End of File), which is typically -1 and would not fit in a `char` type if `char` is unsigned.\n    *   Therefore, the variable must be an `int` to handle input correctly and safely.\n    *   Variable: `int c;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Output Formatting Flag (`first`):**\n    *   This variable is a simple flag (e.g., 1 for true, 0 for false) to track if we are printing the first number.\n    *   A `char` is the smallest data type that can serve this purpose.\n    *   Variable: `char first;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n4.  **Loop Counters (`i`, `j`):**\n    *   The outer loop counter `i` iterates from 1 to 4. A `short` is sufficient.\n    *   The inner loop counter `j` iterates from 0 up to the value in `counts[i]`, which can be at most 501. A `short` is also sufficient for this.\n    *   Variables: `short i; short j;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(short) + sizeof(short)` = 2 + 2 = **4 bytes**.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nNow, we sum the memory usage of all variables required for the most memory-efficient implementation.\n\nm = (memory for `counts`) + (memory for `c`) + (memory for `first`) + (memory for loop counters `i` and `j`)\nm = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4\nm = **19 bytes**\n\n<<<19>>>"
