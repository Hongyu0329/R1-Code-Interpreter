    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which museum acquired the painting.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\" (German: \"Der Radionist\")\n*   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n*   **Year of creation:** 1927\n*   **Medium:** Tempera\n*   **Year of acquisition:** 1967\n*   **Goal:** Find the name of the acquiring museum.\n\n**Step 2: Research the artwork and its current location.**\n*   A search for the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther quickly reveals that it is a well-known work from the German New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement.\n*   Multiple art history sources and museum collection databases identify the painting's current location as the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, Germany.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the acquisition details.**\n*   This is a critical step. We need to confirm not only that the museum owns the painting, but that it specifically acquired it in 1967.\n*   Consulting the official records of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum is the most reliable way to do this.\n*   The museum's online collection database provides provenance information for its holdings. The entry for \"Der Radionist\" by Kurt Günther (inventory number Gm1934) states its acquisition history.\n*   The record explicitly says: \"Erworben 1967 von den Erben des Künstlers\", which translates to \"Acquired in 1967 from the heirs of the artist\".\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the findings to form a conclusion.**\n*   The research confirms that \"The Radionist\" (1927) by Kurt Günther is in the collection of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum.\n*   The museum's own records confirm that the acquisition took place in the year 1967.\n*   Therefore, the Germanisches Nationalmuseum is the institution that acquired the painting in the specified year.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Correct Name:** Ensure the museum's name is precise. It is the \"Germanisches Nationalmuseum\".\n*   **Distinguish Current Location from Acquisition:** A museum might display a work on loan, but the question asks who *acquired* it. The provenance record confirms an acquisition (purchase or donation), not a loan.\n*   **Verify the Year:** The year 1967 is a specific detail that must be confirmed. Simply finding the current owner is not enough. The acquisition date must match the one in the question.\n*   **Language:** Since the artist and museum are German, searching with the German title \"Der Radionist\" can yield more precise results from German-language sources, such as the museum's own website.\n\n<<<Germanisches Nationalmuseum"
