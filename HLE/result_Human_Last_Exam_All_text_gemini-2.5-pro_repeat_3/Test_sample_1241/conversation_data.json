    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nThe problem provides a system of four linear ordinary differential equations, known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, which describe the probabilities of a system being in one of four states {0, 1, 2, 3} over time. We are also given a normalization condition, $P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$, which states that the total probability must be 1 at all times. The goal is to find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, which is the sum of the probabilities of being in state 0 and state 1 after the system has reached a steady state (or equilibrium) as time $t$ approaches infinity.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\nIn the steady state, the probabilities no longer change with time. This means that the derivatives of the probabilities with respect to time are zero. Let $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ represent the steady-state probability of being in state $i$. We can set all the derivatives $P_{i}'(t)$ to zero in the given system of equations:\n\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n\nThe normalization condition also holds for the steady-state probabilities:\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the Given Numerical Values**\nWe are given the following values for the transition rates $\\lambda_{ij}$:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n$\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n$\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n$\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n$\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n$\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nSubstitute these values into the system of algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 \\pi_{0} + 0.65 \\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 \\pi_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) \\pi_{1} + 0.392 \\pi_{2} + 0.008 \\pi_{3} \\implies 0 = 0.019 \\pi_{0} - 1.05 \\pi_{1} + 0.392 \\pi_{2} + 0.008 \\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 \\pi_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_{2} \\implies 0 = 0.4 \\pi_{1} - 0.4 \\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 \\pi_{2} - 0.008 \\pi_{3}$\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the System of Linear Equations**\nWe can solve this system by expressing probabilities $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 \\pi_{2} = 0.008 \\pi_{3} \\implies \\pi_3 = \\pi_2$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 \\pi_{1} = 0.4 \\pi_{2} \\implies \\pi_1 = \\pi_2$\n\nCombining these two results, we have:\n$\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$\n\nNow, from equation (1):\n$0.019 \\pi_{0} = 0.65 \\pi_{1} \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1$\n\nAt this point, we have expressed $\\pi_0, \\pi_2$, and $\\pi_3$ all in terms of $\\pi_1$. (Note: Equation (2) is redundant and will be satisfied automatically if the others are. We can use it as a check, but it's not needed for the solution).\n\n**Step 5: Use the Normalization Equation**\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1) + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) \\pi_1 = 1$\n\nTo solve for $\\pi_1$, we can find a common denominator:\n$\\left( \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} \\right) \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left( \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} \\right) \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left( \\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\right) \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\pi_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$. We can now calculate this sum.\nWe know that $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1$.\nSo, $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right) \\pi_1 + \\pi_1$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1\\right) \\pi_1$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.019}\\right) \\pi_1$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.669}{0.019}\\right) \\pi_1$\n\nNow, substitute the value we found for $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.669}{0.019}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.019}{0.707}\\right)$\nThe term $0.019$ cancels out, leaving:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we perform the division:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of significant figures (e.g., six decimal places) gives 0.946252.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = \\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768$"
