    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Question**\n*   **System:** A particle confined to a one-dimensional box.\n*   **Box dimensions:** The box extends from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   **State of the particle:** The particle is in the second energy level, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   **Objective:** Calculate the probability of finding the particle within a very small interval, from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Physics Principles**\n*   **Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n*   **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a given position `x` is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, `|ψ_n(x)|^2`. This is the probability density function, `P(x)`.\n    `P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(nπx / a)`\n*   **Probability over an Interval:** To find the probability of the particle being in an interval `[x1, x2]`, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval:\n    `Probability = ∫[x1, x2] P(x) dx`\n\n**3. Apply the Principles to the Specific Problem**\n*   **Step 3.1: Define the specific wavefunction and probability density.**\n    *   For `n = 2`, the wavefunction is: `ψ_2(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`.\n    *   The probability density is: `P(x) = |ψ_2(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx / a)`.\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Set up the integral for the probability.**\n    *   The interval is from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`.\n    *   The probability is: `Probability = ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (2/a) * sin^2(2πx / a) dx`.\n\n**4. List Careful Points and Potential Pitfalls**\n*   **The Node:** The interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]` is centered at `x = 0.5a`. For the `n=2` state, `x = a/2` is a node. A node is a point where the wavefunction, and therefore the probability density, is zero.\n    `P(0.5a) = (2/a) * sin^2(2π(0.5a) / a) = (2/a) * sin^2(π) = (2/a) * 0^2 = 0`.\n*   **The Approximation Trap:** Because the interval `Δx = x2 - x1 = 0.01a` is very small, one might be tempted to use the approximation: `Probability ≈ P(center) * Δx`. However, since `P(center) = 0`, this would incorrectly yield a probability of 0. This approximation is invalid because the probability density is not constant; it changes from zero at the center to non-zero values at the edges of the interval.\n*   **Correct Approach:** We must either solve the integral exactly or use a more suitable approximation that accounts for the function's behavior near the node.\n\n**5. Solve the Problem (Approximation Method)**\nSince the interval is very small and centered around the node at `x = a/2`, we can approximate the `sin^2` function.\n\n*   **Step 5.1: Express position `x` in terms of a small deviation `δ` from the node.**\n    *   Let `x = a/2 + δ`. The interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]` corresponds to `δ` ranging from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n\n*   **Step 5.2: Approximate the probability density function `P(x)` near the node.**\n    *   Substitute `x = a/2 + δ` into the argument of the sine function:\n        `2πx/a = 2π(a/2 + δ)/a = π + 2πδ/a`\n    *   The sine term becomes:\n        `sin(π + 2πδ/a) = -sin(2πδ/a)`\n    *   Since the argument `2πδ/a` is very small, we can use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n        `-sin(2πδ/a) ≈ -2πδ/a`\n    *   Now, substitute this back into the probability density function:\n        `P(x) = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx/a) ≈ (2/a) * (-2πδ/a)^2 = (2/a) * (4π^2δ^2/a^2) = (8π^2/a^3)δ^2`\n\n*   **Step 5.3: Integrate the approximated probability density.**\n    *   The probability is the integral of this approximated function with respect to `δ` from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n        `Probability ≈ ∫[-0.005a, 0.005a] (8π^2/a^3)δ^2 dδ`\n    *   `Probability ≈ (8π^2/a^3) * [δ^3/3]` evaluated from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n    *   `Probability ≈ (8π^2/a^3) * [((0.005a)^3/3) - ((-0.005a)^3/3)]`\n    *   `Probability ≈ (8π^2/a^3) * [2 * (0.005a)^3 / 3]`\n    *   `Probability ≈ (16π^2/3a^3) * (0.005)^3 * a^3`\n\n*   **Step 5.4: Calculate the final numerical value.**\n    *   The `a^3` terms cancel out.\n        `Probability ≈ (16π^2/3) * (0.005)^3`\n    *   `Probability ≈ (16π^2/3) * (1.25 x 10^-7)`\n    *   `Probability ≈ (16 * (3.14159)^2 / 3) * 1.25 x 10^-7`\n    *   `Probability ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 1.25 x 10^-7`\n    *   `Probability ≈ (52.638) * 1.25 x 10^-7`\n    *   `Probability ≈ 6.5797 x 10^-6`\n\nThis result can also be obtained by performing the exact integration and using a Taylor series expansion for the resulting trigonometric functions, which confirms the validity of this approximation.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval from `0.495a` to `0.505a` for `n=2` is approximately `6.58 x 10^-6`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
