    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n*   **Key Landmark:** The Pantheon church.\n*   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n*   **Action:** It was \"removed\" by the city administration.\n*   **Timeframe:** The feature existed \"until 1950\", meaning it was removed in or around that year.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination**\n*   The Piazza has several famous features. The most prominent are the Pantheon itself, the Renaissance fountain (Fontana del Pantheon) in the center, and the Egyptian obelisk placed on top of the fountain. These have not been removed.\n*   The Pantheon itself underwent changes. Famously, two bell towers designed by Bernini, nicknamed the \"ass's ears\" (`orecchie d'asino`), were added in the 17th century. However, these were highly criticized and removed in 1883, which does not fit the \"1950\" timeframe.\n*   The Piazza was historically a crowded market, but a market is a function, not an architectural feature, although it had associated stalls and structures. The main fish market was moved in the 19th century.\n*   The area around the Pantheon was subject to various \"liberation\" projects, where buildings constructed against the ancient monument were demolished. Much of this happened in the 1920s and 1930s under Mussolini's regime. The question specifies a later date, around 1950.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the 1950 Timeframe**\n*   Research into the urban development of Rome after World War II is necessary. Post-war planning often involved \"modernizing\" or \"regularizing\" historical cityscapes.\n*   Looking at historical photographs of the Piazza della Rotonda before and after 1950 reveals a significant change on the south side of the square (the side opposite the Pantheon's portico).\n*   Before the demolition, this side of the square was lined with a block of medieval houses.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the \"Unique Architectural Feature\"**\n*   The key feature of this block of houses was not just the buildings themselves, but a specific architectural element at ground level.\n*   There was a **covered walkway, or portico**, supported by arches and columns, running along the front of these buildings.\n*   This structure was known as the **\"Portico dei Concorrenti\"** (Portico of the Competitors) or \"Portico della Rotonda\". It was a remnant of medieval Rome and gave the square a more enclosed and picturesque, albeit irregular, character.\n\n**Step 5: Confirming the Removal**\n*   In the late 1940s (specifically documented around 1948-1949), as part of a plan to create a more open and monumental setting for the Pantheon, the city administration demolished this entire block of houses, including the historic portico.\n*   This event fits the timeframe \"until 1950\" perfectly. The removal of this distinctive medieval portico was a significant and controversial alteration to the historical fabric of the famous piazza.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe unique architectural feature that existed in the Piazza della Rotonda until it was removed around 1950 was the \"Portico dei Concorrenti,\" a medieval covered walkway on the south side of the square.\n\n<<<The \"Portico dei Concorrenti\" (Portico of the Competitors), a medieval covered walkway that lined the south side of the square.>>>"
