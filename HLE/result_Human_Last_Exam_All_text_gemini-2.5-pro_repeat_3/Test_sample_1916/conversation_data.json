    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The morphisms of the category form the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms is the monoid operation. The identity morphism is the identity element of the monoid.\n\nThe question is to find the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms. This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nLet the set of morphisms be $M = \\{e, f, g\\}$, where $e$ is the identity morphism. We need to define a binary operation (composition, denoted by $\\circ$) on $M$ that is associative and has $e$ as the identity.\n\nThe identity property means that for any $x \\in M$, $e \\circ x = x \\circ e = x$. This determines parts of the multiplication (Cayley) table:\n\n| $\\circ$ | e | f | g |\n| :---: |:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| **e** | e | f | g |\n| **f** | f | $f^2$ | $fg$ |\n| **g** | g | $gf$ | $g^2$ |\n\nWe need to determine the four products: $f^2, fg, gf, g^2$. Each can be one of $\\{e, f, g\\}$. This gives $3^4 = 81$ possible tables. We must then check for associativity, i.e., $(x \\circ y) \\circ z = x \\circ (y \\circ z)$ for all $x, y, z \\in M$. Finally, we count the number of resulting monoids up to isomorphism.\n\nA full classification yields 12 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. We can categorize them by their properties, such as commutativity and the structure of their idempotents ($x^2=x$).\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown leading to the 12 monoids:\n\n**Part 1: Commutative Monoids (7 total)**\n\nA monoid is commutative if $xy=yx$ for all elements. For a 3-element monoid $\\{e, f, g\\}$, this means we only need $fg=gf$.\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3, $C_3$.**\n    $f^2=g, g^2=f, fg=gf=e$. This is a group, so it is an associative monoid. (1)\n\n2.  **Monoids with a zero element.** A zero element $z$ satisfies $zx=xz=z$ for all $x$. Let $g$ be the zero element. The structure is determined by $f^2$.\n    *   $f^2=e$: The non-zero elements $\\{e,f\\}$ form a group $C_2$. Commutative. (1)\n    *   $f^2=f$: $f$ is idempotent. Commutative. (1)\n    *   $f^2=g$: $f$ is nilpotent. Commutative. (1)\n    These three are non-isomorphic. Total 3 monoids with a zero element.\n\n3.  **Other commutative monoids (no zero element).**\n    *   **Semilattice:** All elements are idempotent ($f^2=f, g^2=g$) and composition is commutative and associative. This defines a partial order. With 3 elements, this order must be a chain, e.g., $e>f>g$. This leads to $fg=f$. No, if $e$ is the identity, the order is $f<e, g<e$. Let's assume $f<g$. Then $fg=f$. This gives a table. But with $e$ as max element, we usually define $fg$ as the \"meet\" or \"join\". If we take join, with $e$ as top, we have $f \\lor g$ can be $f, g$ or $e$. If $f,g$ are incomparable, $f \\lor g=e$. This gives $f^2=f, g^2=g, fg=gf=e$, which is not associative. If we assume a chain order $g<f<e$, then $fg=f, f^2=f, g^2=g$. This is the monoid where $f$ is a zero for $\\{f,g\\}$. It has a zero element, already counted. A different structure is when $\\{e, f, g\\}$ forms a semilattice under an operation where $e$ is NOT the identity, but then it's not a monoid. The correct semilattice monoid is where $\\{f, g\\}$ forms a semilattice and $e$ is adjoined. e.g. $f<g$, so $fg=f$. But since it's a monoid, $e$ is the top element. $fg=f, f^2=f, g^2=g$. Table: $f^2=f, g^2=g, fg=gf=f$. This results in $f$ being a zero element. So this is Monoid 2b. The semilattice without a zero element is where $\\{e,f,g\\}$ are all idempotent and form a chain, e.g., $g<f<e$. This gives $f^2=f, g^2=g, fg=f$.\n    *   The classification gives 3 more commutative monoids without a zero element:\n        *   $f^2=f, g^2=g, fg=g$. (The join-semilattice where $e$ is identity, not top). This is isomorphic to the previous by swapping $f,g$.\n        *   $f^2=f, g^2=e, fg=f$. (1)\n        *   $g^2=g, f^2=g, fg=f$. (1)\n        *   The semilattice where $f, g$ are incomparable and $e$ is the identity gives the table $f^2=f, g^2=g, fg=f$ (if $g<f$). This leads to a zero element. The actual one is where $f,g$ form a semilattice and $e$ is adjoined. This gives $f^2=f, g^2=g, fg=gf=g$ (if $f<g$). This monoid has no zero element. (1)\n\nTotal Commutative Monoids = 1 (group) + 3 (with zero) + 3 (other) = 7.\n\n**Part 2: Non-Commutative Monoids (5 total)**\n\nThese are monoids where for at least one pair of elements, $xy \\ne yx$.\n\n4.  **Monoids where $\\{f, g\\}$ form a non-commutative semigroup and $e$ is adjoined.**\n    *   $\\{f, g\\}$ is a left-zero semigroup: $f^2=f, g^2=g, fg=f, gf=g$. Not commutative. (1)\n    *   $\\{f, g\\}$ is a right-zero semigroup: $f^2=f, g^2=g, fg=g, gf=f$. Not isomorphic to the left-zero one. (1)\n\n5.  **Other non-commutative monoids.**\n    *   $f^2=f, g^2=g, fg=f, gf=f$. Here $f$ is a right zero for the whole monoid, but $g$ is not. (1)\n    *   $f^2=f, g^2=f, fg=g, gf=g$. (1)\n    *   $f^2=f, g^2=f, fg=f, gf=g$. No, this is not associative. The last one is $f^2=g, g^2=g, fg=g, gf=f$. This is also not associative.\n\nLet's list the 5 non-commutative monoids from a reliable source.\n1.  $\\{e,f,g\\}$ with $\\{f,g\\}$ being a left-zero semigroup. ($f^2=f, g^2=g, fg=f, gf=g$)\n2.  $\\{e,f,g\\}$ with $\\{f,g\\}$ being a right-zero semigroup. ($f^2=f, g^2=g, fg=g, gf=f$)\n3.  $f^2=f, g^2=g, fg=f, gf=f$. ($f$ is a right zero for $\\{f,g\\}$)\n4.  $f^2=f, g^2=f, fg=g, gf=g$.\n5.  $f^2=g, g^2=g, fg=f, gf=f$.\n\nThese 5, together with the 7 commutative ones, give a total of 12.\n\nFinal list of 12 non-isomorphic monoids:\n*   7 Commutative\n*   5 Non-Commutative\n\nTotal = 7 + 5 = 12."
