    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the MLB Batting Triple Crown\nThe Triple Crown in Major League Baseball refers to a batter leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three specific statistical categories in the same season. These categories are:\n1.  **Batting Average (BA)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: List the Triple Crown Winners by League\nWe need to list all the players who have achieved this feat in either the American League (AL) or the National League (NL).\n\n**National League (NL) Triple Crown Winners:**\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878)\n*   **Tip O'Neill** (1887) - Achieved in the American Association, which is recognized as a major league for that period.\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1925)\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937)\n\n**American League (AL) Triple Crown Winners:**\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1947)\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012)\n\n### Step 3: Identify Careful Points and Distinctions\n1.  **\"Winners\" vs. \"Wins\":** The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which implies counting the unique players. It's important to note that two players have won the Triple Crown more than once.\n    *   **Rogers Hornsby** won it twice (1922, 1925).\n    *   **Ted Williams** won it twice (1942, 1947).\n    Therefore, while the Triple Crown has been achieved 17 times, the number of unique players who have done it is lower.\n\n2.  **Historical Eras:** The earliest winners (Hines, O'Neill, Duffy) played in the 19th century, before the \"modern era\" of baseball (which is generally considered to have started in 1901). However, they are officially recognized as Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step 4: Consolidate the List and Count the Unique Winners\nTo find the total number of individual winners, we compile a single list of all the names and count each player only once.\n\n1.  Paul Hines\n2.  Tip O'Neill\n3.  Hugh Duffy\n4.  Nap Lajoie\n5.  Ty Cobb\n6.  Rogers Hornsby (won twice, counted as one winner)\n7.  Chuck Klein\n8.  Jimmie Foxx\n9.  Lou Gehrig\n10. Joe Medwick\n11. Ted Williams (won twice, counted as one winner)\n12. Mickey Mantle\n13. Frank Robinson\n14. Carl Yastrzemski\n15. Miguel Cabrera\n\nCounting the unique players on this consolidated list gives us the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer\nBy counting each player who has won the Triple Crown exactly once, regardless of how many times they achieved the feat, we arrive at the total number of winners.\n\n<<<15>>>"
