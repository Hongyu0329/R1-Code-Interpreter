    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Movement: Cambré Derrière**\n    *   *Cambré* is a French ballet term meaning \"arched.\"\n    *   *Derrière* means \"to the back.\"\n    *   Therefore, a *cambré derrière* is a bend of the body from the waist backwards, requiring flexibility and strength in the back and core.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method Execution**\n    *   **Core Principle:** The Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia, emphasizes strength, stability, and precise, clean lines.\n    *   **Hip Placement:** This is a crucial point. In a Vaganova cambré derrière, the dancer must keep their hips stationary and square, directly aligned over their supporting leg(s). The pelvis does not push forward. This isolates the bend to the upper and middle back.\n    *   **Initiation of Bend:** The bend originates from the upper thoracic spine, lifting the chest towards the ceiling before arching back. The lower back is kept long and supported to prevent injury.\n    *   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine, lifting and looking up and back. The arms (*port de bras*) are held in specific, graceful positions to frame the body and aid the line.\n    *   **Goal:** The goal is to create a pure, long, and even curve in the spine while maintaining perfect pelvic stability. It is an exercise in control and spinal flexibility.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method Execution**\n    *   **Core Principle:** The Balanchine method, developed by George Balanchine, is known for its speed, musicality, and dynamic, often extreme, lines that push the boundaries of classical technique.\n    *   **Hip Placement:** This is the most significant point of difference. In the Balanchine style, the dancer intentionally pushes the hips *forward* as the upper body bends back.\n    *   **Effect of Hip Placement:** Pushing the hips forward acts as a counterbalance, allowing the dancer to achieve a much deeper and more dramatic backbend. It creates a dynamic, \"off-balance\" look that is a hallmark of the style.\n    *   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the deeper curve of the back, often dropping further back than in the Vaganova style. The arms are used to create expansive, elongated lines, often with a sharp *allongé* (lengthening).\n    *   **Goal:** The goal is to create a visually striking, expansive, and dynamic line that emphasizes length and musicality, even at the cost of the static stability prized in the Vaganova method.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in the *port de bras*, the fundamental arm positions are not the primary technical distinction. Both methods use *allongé*.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core technical difference. Vaganova insists on stationary, square hips. Balanchine utilizes a forward push of the hips. This single difference fundamentally changes the mechanics, stability, and aesthetic of the entire movement.\n    *   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's choreography is often faster, speed is a stylistic or choreographic choice rather than a fundamental difference in the technique of executing the cambré itself. A cambré can be done slowly or quickly in either style.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The difference in the degree of the backbend is a *result* of the differing techniques, not the cause. The Balanchine method achieves a deeper backbend *because* of the forward hip placement. Therefore, the hip placement is the more fundamental answer.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** The head placement is also a consequence of the spinal curve. In both methods, the head follows the line of the back. Since the Balanchine bend is deeper, the head naturally goes further back. This is a result of the hip placement, not the primary difference itself.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most critical and defining difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the **placement of the hip**. Vaganova requires the hips to remain stable and square, while Balanchine uses a forward thrust of the hips to achieve a deeper, more dynamic line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
