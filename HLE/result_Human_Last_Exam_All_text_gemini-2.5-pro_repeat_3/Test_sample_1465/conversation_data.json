    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\n**Fundamental Concepts:**\nCoiled-coil proteins consist of Î±-helices wrapped around each other. Their oligomeric state (how many helices bundle together) is largely determined by the amino acid sequence, which follows a seven-residue repeating pattern called a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n*   **Core Positions (`a`, `d`):** These are typically hydrophobic residues (like I, L, V, A) that form the core where the helices interact. The specific amino acids at these positions are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state.\n*   **Flanking Positions (`e`, `g`):** These are typically charged or polar residues (like E, K, Q, R) that form electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices, further stabilizing the structure.\n*   **Solvent-Exposed Positions (`b`, `c`, `f`):** These residues are on the outside of the bundle and interact with the solvent.\n\n**Key Sequence Motifs and Their Oligomeric States:**\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Often formed by `a=I, d=L` or when a polar residue like Asparagine (N) is present in the core `a` position.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Often formed by `a=I, d=I` or `a=I, d=A`. A polar Glutamine (Q) at the `a` position (Q-zipper) is also a strong trimer signal.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Often formed by `a=L, d=I` or `a=A, d=I`. A core of `a=I, d=T` can also form tetramers.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Sequence:\n\n**1. Sequence: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **Analysis:** We need to find the correct `a-g` phasing. The most plausible phasing that places hydrophobic residues at the core `a` and `d` positions is `g(abcdefg)`. This assigns the first `E` to the `g` position.\n    *   Repeat unit: `(IAQALKE)n` (with some substitutions).\n    *   **`a` positions:** I, I, I, I\n    *   **`d` positions:** A, A, W, A\n*   **Conclusion:** The core is dominated by Isoleucine (I) at the `a` position and Alanine (A) at the `d` position. The `a=I, d=A` motif is a classic signature for a **trimer (3)** because the bulky Isoleucine at `a` sterically favors the packing geometry of a three-helix bundle.\n\n**2. Sequence: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **Analysis:** The most striking feature of this sequence is the presence of a polar Asparagine (N) within the third repeat (`...KENA...`). This polar residue in a mostly hydrophobic context is a powerful determinant. The most likely phasing places this `N` in a core position.\n    *   Phasing `g(abcdefg)` gives the repeat `(IAALKQE)n`.\n    *   **`a` positions:** I, I, **N**, I\n    *   **`d` positions:** A, A, K, A\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of Asparagine (N) at an `a` position is a very strong signal for a parallel **dimer (2)**. The polar side chain of `N` forms a stabilizing hydrogen bond with its counterpart on the other helix across the dimer interface.\n\n**3. Sequence: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **Analysis:** Let's determine the phasing. The phasing `g(abcdefg)` yields a very consistent repeat.\n    *   Repeat unit: `(IAAIKQE)n`.\n    *   **`a` positions:** I, I, I, I\n    *   **`d` positions:** I, I, I, I\n*   **Conclusion:** The core consists exclusively of Isoleucine (I) at both the `a` and `d` positions. This `a=I, d=I` motif is a canonical signature for a **trimer (3)**.\n\n**4. Sequence: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence contains a repeating `QKQL` motif. We test phasings to find a logical core. The phasing `c(defgab)` gives a consistent core pattern.\n    *   Repeat unit: `(QKQLKEI)n`.\n    *   **`a` positions:** Q, Q, Q, Q\n    *   **`d` positions:** I, I, I, I\n*   **Conclusion:** The core has Glutamine (Q) at all `a` positions and Isoleucine (I) at all `d` positions. Glutamine at the `a` position creates a \"Q-zipper\" motif, where the polar side chains form a hydrogen-bonded network within the core, strongly specifying a **trimer (3)**.\n\n**5. Sequence: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **Analysis:** We find the heptad repeat by aligning the similar segments: `(EIAxTLK)n`, where `x` is the variable residue. To find the core, we test phasings. The `g(abcdefg)` phasing is the most plausible.\n    *   Repeat unit: `(IAxTLKE)n`.\n    *   **`a` positions:** I, I, I, I\n    *   **`d` positions:** T, T, T, T (Threonine)\n*   **Conclusion:** The core consists of Isoleucine (I) at the `a` position and Threonine (T) at the `d` position. While T is polar, it can be accommodated in the core. The `a=I, d=T` motif is a known signature for a **tetramer (4)**, where the hydroxyl groups of the threonine residues form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network down the center of the four-helix bundle.\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n*   Sequence 1: **3** (Trimer)\n*   Sequence 2: **2** (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 3: **3** (Trimer)\n*   Sequence 4: **3** (Trimer)\n*   Sequence 5: **4** (Tetramer)\n\nThe resulting sequence of oligomeric states is **3, 2, 3, 3, 4**. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
