    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and Key Information**\n\n*   **Input Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n*   **Key Constraint:** The sequence is from the \"middle of an ORF\" (Open Reading Frame).\n*   **Implication:** An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain any stop codons (except at the very end, which is not the case here). Therefore, the correct reading frame for this sequence must be the one that has **no stop codons**. The standard stop codons in DNA are `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA`.\n*   **Goal:** Find the correct reading frame and translate it into a protein sequence using the one-letter amino acid codes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Three Possible Reading Frames**\n\nA DNA sequence can be read in three different frames, depending on which nucleotide you start with. We will examine each frame for the presence of stop codons.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 1 (starts at the 1st nucleotide):**\n    *   Codons: `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc cta ccc caa taa tct taa cag tgt cct ggc tga ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This frame contains multiple stop codons: `tag`, `taa`, `taa`, and `tga`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is **not** the correct reading frame.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 2 (starts at the 2nd nucleotide):**\n    *   We ignore the first nucleotide (`g`) and group the rest into codons.\n    *   Codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n    *   **Analysis:** Scanning this sequence of codons reveals no instances of `TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a valid open reading frame and is the most likely candidate.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 3 (starts at the 3rd nucleotide):**\n    *   We ignore the first two nucleotides (`gg`) and group the rest into codons.\n    *   Codons: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga agt ttt caa gct ctt tac cct acc cca ata atc tta aca gtg tcc tgg ctg ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** This frame contains two stop codons: `tga`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is **not** the correct reading frame.\n\n**Step 3: Translate the Correct Reading Frame (Frame 2)**\n\nNow we translate the sequence of codons from Frame 2 using the standard genetic code into their corresponding one-letter amino acid codes.\n\n*   **Codons:** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   gac -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   att -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   gtt -> V (Valine)\n    *   gtt -> V (Valine)\n    *   agc -> S (Serine)\n    *   gaa -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   gac -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   ttg -> L (Leucine)\n    *   aat -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   gga -> G (Glycine)\n    *   acg -> T (Threonine)\n    *   gtg -> V (Valine)\n    *   aag -> K (Lysine)\n    *   ttt -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   tca -> S (Serine)\n    *   agc -> S (Serine)\n    *   tct -> S (Serine)\n    *   tta -> L (Leucine)\n    *   ccc -> P (Proline)\n    *   tac -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   ccc -> P (Proline)\n    *   aat -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   aat -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   ctt -> L (Leucine)\n    *   aac -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   agt -> S (Serine)\n    *   gtc -> V (Valine)\n    *   ctg -> L (Leucine)\n    *   gct -> A (Alanine)\n    *   gag -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   cga -> R (Arginine)\n    *   ctg -> L (Leucine)\n    *   gag -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   aag -> K (Lysine)\n    *   tgg -> W (Tryptophan)\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Final Protein Sequence**\n\nBy concatenating the one-letter codes from the translation in Step 3, we get the final protein sequence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe correct reading frame is Frame 2. The translated protein sequence is:\nDIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLLPYPNNLNSVLALERLEKW\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLLPYPNNLNSVLALERLEKW>>>"
