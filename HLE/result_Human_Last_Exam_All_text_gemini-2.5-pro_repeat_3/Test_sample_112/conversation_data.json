    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a \"book of manners\" that was preserved in the same historical document as the poem \"Sir Launfal\". This requires knowledge of the manuscript tradition of \"Sir Launfal\".\n\n**Step 2: Determine the manuscript containing \"Sir Launfal\".**\nThe Middle English romance *Sir Launfal*, written by Thomas Chestre, survives in its complete form in only one manuscript. This manuscript is a famous collection of English literature.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific manuscript.**\nThe manuscript in question is known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**, which is now held in the British Library. It was compiled in the mid-15th century.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the other contents of the manuscript.**\nCotton Caligula A.ii is a miscellany, meaning it contains several different works bound together. To answer the question, we need to know what other texts are included. Besides *Sir Launfal*, the manuscript contains other major works like *Layamon's Brut* and *The Owl and the Nightingale*.\n\n**Step 5: Locate the \"book of manners\" within the manuscript's contents.**\nThe question specifically asks for a \"book of manners,\" which is a type of instructional text on etiquette and social conduct, also known as a courtesy book. By examining a list of the contents of Cotton Caligula A.ii, we find a text that fits this description precisely.\n\n**Step 6: Name the specific book of manners.**\nThe book of manners preserved in the same manuscript as *Sir Launfal* is titled **The Boke of Curtasye** (often modernized as *The Book of Courtesy*). This poem provides detailed instructions for a young man on how to behave properly in a noble household, covering everything from table manners to personal hygiene and service to a lord.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy tracing *Sir Launfal* to its source manuscript, Cotton Caligula A.ii, and then examining the other texts within that collection, we can identify the specific book of manners it was preserved alongside.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
