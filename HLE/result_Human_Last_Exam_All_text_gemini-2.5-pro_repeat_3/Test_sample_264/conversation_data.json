    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Coordinate System and the First Cube**\n\nTo analyze the problem, we first set up a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a standard position with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and its edges aligned with the coordinate axes. Since the side length is 1, Cube A occupies the region defined by the inequalities:\n*   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**2. Interpret the \"Shift along the Main Diagonal\"**\n\n*   **Main Diagonal:** A main diagonal of a cube connects two opposite vertices. For Cube A in our chosen position, the main diagonal starting from the origin (0,0,0) connects to the opposite vertex at (1,1,1). The vector representing this main diagonal is `d = (1, 1, 1)`.\n*   **The Shift:** The problem states the second cube (Cube B) is \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" relative to the first. In geometric problems of this type, this is standardly interpreted to mean that the shift vector is half of the main diagonal vector.\n*   **Shift Vector (s):** Therefore, the shift vector `s` is `1/2 * d = 1/2 * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n\n**3. Define the Second Cube**\n\nCube B is identical to Cube A but is translated by the shift vector `s = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. To find the region occupied by Cube B, we add the shift vector's components to the inequalities for Cube A:\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**4. Determine the Intersection of the Two Cubes**\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the inequalities for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We can find this region by finding the intersection of the coordinate ranges for each axis.\n\n*   **For the x-axis:**\n    *   Cube A requires `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n    *   Cube B requires `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`.\n    *   The intersection of these two ranges is `max(0, 1/2) ≤ x ≤ min(1, 3/2)`, which is `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n\n*   **For the y-axis:**\n    *   Cube A requires `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\n    *   Cube B requires `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`.\n    *   The intersection is `max(0, 1/2) ≤ y ≤ min(1, 3/2)`, which is `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\n\n*   **For the z-axis:**\n    *   Cube A requires `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n    *   Cube B requires `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n    *   The intersection is `max(0, 1/2) ≤ z ≤ min(1, 3/2)`, which is `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\n\nThe intersection is a geometric shape defined by the inequalities:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\nThis describes a smaller cube. We find the length of its sides:\n*   Side length in x-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in y-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in z-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume of a cube is `(side length)^3`.\nVolume of intersection = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Shift:** The most crucial step is correctly interpreting \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". The alternative, a shift by a *distance* of 1/2, would involve a vector of `(1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3))` and lead to a much more complex calculation and an irrational answer. The interpretation as a shift vector of `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)` is standard and leads to a clean result.\n2.  **Axis Alignment:** The problem is greatly simplified because the cubes' edges are aligned with the coordinate axes, and the shift vector has equal components along each axis. This allows for a simple, dimension-by-dimension analysis.\n3.  **Finding the Intersection Region:** The core of the solution lies in finding the overlapping interval for each coordinate independently and then combining them to define the intersection volume.\n4.  **Volume Calculation:** The final step is a simple calculation of the volume of the resulting shape, which is a cube. Be careful not to make a simple arithmetic error.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  **Cube A definition:** `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n2.  **Cube B definition:** Cube A shifted by `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. This gives `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n3.  **Intersection ranges:**\n    *   x-range: `[0, 1] ∩ [1/2, 3/2] = [1/2, 1]`\n    *   y-range: `[0, 1] ∩ [1/2, 3/2] = [1/2, 1]`\n    *   z-range: `[0, 1] ∩ [1/2, 3/2] = [1/2, 1]`\n4.  **Intersection shape:** A cube with side lengths `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n5.  **Intersection volume:** `(1/2)^3 = 1/8`.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
