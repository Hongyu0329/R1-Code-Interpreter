    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The bromine atom is a good leaving group.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** Tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH). This is a polar protic solvent that is also bulky.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction. Substitution reactions (SN1/SN2) are disfavored.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry and Conformation of the Substrate**\n*   **Cis/Trans Isomerism:** The stereochemical descriptors (1S, 2R) indicate a *cis* relationship between the bromine and methyl groups on the cyclohexane ring. (For 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexanes, R,S or S,R configurations are cis, while R,R or S,S are trans).\n*   **Chair Conformations:** As a *cis*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, it exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations:\n    *   **Conformer A:** One substituent is axial, and the other is equatorial (axial-equatorial).\n    *   **Conformer B:** After a ring flip, the substituents switch positions (equatorial-axial).\n*   **Conformational Stability:** To determine which conformer is more stable, we compare the steric bulk of the substituents. The methyl group (-CH3) is significantly bulkier than the bromine atom (-Br). The most stable conformation of a substituted cyclohexane places the largest group in the equatorial position to minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions).\n    *   Therefore, the more stable (and major) conformation will have the **methyl group equatorial** and the **bromine atom axial**.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Requirements for the E2 Mechanism**\n*   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Br) and the proton being removed (a β-proton) must be in an **anti-periplanar** arrangement. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means they must be **trans-diaxial** (both in axial positions, one pointing up and one pointing down).\n*   The reaction will proceed through the conformation that meets this requirement. In our case, the major conformer (Br axial, CH3 equatorial) has the leaving group (Br) in the required axial position. This means the reaction can proceed readily from the most stable conformation.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Possible β-Protons and Products**\n*   The leaving group, Br, is on C1. The adjacent carbons with protons (β-carbons) are C2 and C6.\n*   We must look for **axial** protons on C2 and C6 in the reactive conformation (Br axial, CH3 equatorial).\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is equatorial, which means the hydrogen atom on C2 is **axial**. This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination involving this proton is possible. This would form a double bond between C1 and C2. The product is **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted alkene, known as the **Zaitsev product**.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The **axial** hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination involving this proton is also possible. This would form a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group remains on C2. Numbering the new alkene to give the double bond the lowest numbers (C1-C6), the methyl group is on the adjacent carbon, C2. The proper IUPAC name requires numbering the double bond as 1 and 2, so the methyl group is at position 3. The product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene, known as the **Hofmann product**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Major Product (Regioselectivity)**\n*   We have two possible products: 1-methylcyclohexene (Zaitsev) and 3-methylcyclohexene (Hofmann). The regioselectivity (which product is major) is determined by the nature of the base.\n*   Potassium tert-butoxide is a **bulky base**. Due to its large size, it preferentially attacks the most sterically accessible β-proton.\n*   **Accessibility of β-Protons:**\n    *   The β-proton on C2 is on the same carbon as the methyl group, making it sterically hindered.\n    *   The β-proton on C6 is on a simple CH₂ group and is much less hindered.\n*   Because the base is bulky, it will preferentially remove the more accessible proton on C6. This leads to the formation of the Hofmann product as the major product.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with the bulky base potassium tert-butoxide favors the E2 elimination pathway that forms the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product) due to steric hindrance. Therefore, the major product is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
