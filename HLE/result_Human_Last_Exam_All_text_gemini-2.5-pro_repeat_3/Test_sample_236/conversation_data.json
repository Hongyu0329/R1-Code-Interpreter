    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant concepts\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_H^3$)**: This is the set of equivalence classes of oriented integral homology 3-spheres, where two are equivalent if they co-bound an acyclic 4-manifold. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This means performing Dehn surgery on a knot $K \\subset S^3$ with an integer framing $p/q$ where $q=1$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S_p^3(K)$.\n*   **Condition for Homology Sphere**: For $S_p^3(K)$ to be an integral homology sphere, its first homology group, $H_1(S_p^3(K);\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_{|p|}$, must be trivial. This requires $|p|=1$. Thus, we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries.\n\n### Step 2: List all knots with at most four crossings\n\nWe need to consider all knots up to crossing number 4. The list is:\n*   **0 crossings**: The unknot, $0_1$.\n*   **1 or 2 crossings**: None.\n*   **3 crossings**: The trefoil knot, $3_1$. This knot is chiral, so we must consider both the right-handed trefoil ($+3_1$) and its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$).\n*   **4 crossings**: The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image ($4_1 = -4_1$).\n\nSo the full list of knots to analyze is: $0_1$, $+3_1$, $-3_1$, and $4_1$.\n\n### Step 3: List all possible surgery manifolds\n\nWe perform $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on each of the knots identified above:\n1.  $S_{+1}^3(0_1)$ and $S_{-1}^3(0_1)$\n2.  $S_{+1}^3(+3_1)$ and $S_{-1}^3(+3_1)$\n3.  $S_{+1}^3(-3_1)$ and $S_{-1}^3(-3_1)$\n4.  $S_{+1}^3(4_1)$ and $S_{-1}^3(4_1)$\n\n### Step 4: Use manifold identities to simplify the list\n\n*   **Unknot**: Surgery on the unknot gives $S^3$. $S_{\\pm 1}^3(0_1) = S^3$. This represents the identity element in $\\Theta_H^3$.\n*   **Mirror Image Identity**: The surgery on the mirror of a knot is related to the surgery on the original knot by the diffeomorphism $S_p^3(-K) \\cong -S_{-p}^3(K)$, where $-Y$ denotes the manifold $Y$ with reversed orientation.\n    *   Applying this to the trefoil:\n        *   $S_{+1}^3(-3_1) \\cong -S_{-1}^3(+3_1)$\n        *   $S_{-1}^3(-3_1) \\cong -S_{+1}^3(+3_1)$\n*   **Amphichiral Identity**: Since the figure-eight knot is amphichiral ($4_1 = -4_1$), we can apply the same identity:\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(4_1) \\cong S_{+1}^3(-4_1) \\cong -S_{-1}^3(4_1)$\n\nThese identities mean that the set of all generated manifolds, up to orientation-preserving diffeomorphism and orientation reversal, is generated by:\n*   $S^3$\n*   $S_{+1}^3(+3_1)$\n*   $S_{-1}^3(+3_1)$\n*   $S_{+1}^3(4_1)$\n\nThe full list of generated manifolds is:\n$\\{S^3, S_{+1}^3(+3_1), S_{-1}^3(+3_1), -S_{-1}^3(+3_1), -S_{+1}^3(+3_1), S_{+1}^3(4_1), -S_{+1}^3(4_1)\\}$.\n\n### Step 5: Use homology cobordism invariants to distinguish the classes\n\nTo determine if these manifolds represent distinct elements in $\\Theta_H^3$, we use homology cobordism invariants. The most common are the Casson invariant ($\\lambda$) and the Neumann-Siebenmann invariant ($\\bar{\\mu}$). Two manifolds with different invariants must belong to different homology cobordism classes.\n\nThe relevant formulas for the invariants of an integral surgery manifold $S_p^3(K)$ are:\n*   $\\lambda(S_p^3(K)) = \\frac{\\Delta_K''(1)}{2p}$\n*   $\\bar{\\mu}(S_p^3(K)) = -\\frac{\\sigma(K)}{8} \\pmod 1$\n    *   (Note: There are different conventions for $\\bar{\\mu}$. We use one that is consistent with the diffeomorphism identities.)\n\nWe need the signature ($\\sigma$) and the second derivative of the Alexander polynomial ($\\Delta_K''(1)$) for each knot:\n*   **Unknot ($0_1$)**: $\\sigma(0_1)=0$, $\\Delta_{0_1}(t)=1 \\implies \\Delta_{0_1}''(1)=0$.\n*   **Right-handed Trefoil ($+3_1$)**: $\\sigma(+3_1)=-2$, $\\Delta_{+3_1}(t)=t^{-1}-1+t \\implies \\Delta_{+3_1}''(1)=2$.\n*   **Left-handed Trefoil ($-3_1$)**: $\\sigma(-3_1)=+2$, $\\Delta_{-3_1}(t)=t-1+t^{-1} \\implies \\Delta_{-3_1}''(1)=2$.\n*   **Figure-eight ($4_1$)**: $\\sigma(4_1)=0$, $\\Delta_{4_1}(t)=-t^{-1}+3-t \\implies \\Delta_{4_1}''(1)=-2$.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the invariants for each surgery manifold\n\nWe now compute the pair of invariants $(\\lambda, \\bar{\\mu})$ for each distinct surgery manifold.\n\n1.  **$S^3$ (from $0_1$)**:\n    *   $(\\lambda, \\bar{\\mu}) = (0, 0)$.\n\n2.  **Surgeries on $+3_1$**:\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(+3_1)$ ($p=+1$):\n        *   $\\lambda = \\frac{2}{2(1)} = 1$\n        *   $\\bar{\\mu} = - \\frac{-2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n        *   Pair: $(1, 1/4)$\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(+3_1)$ ($p=-1$):\n        *   $\\lambda = \\frac{2}{2(-1)} = -1$\n        *   $\\bar{\\mu} = - \\frac{-2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n        *   Pair: $(-1, 1/4)$\n\n3.  **Surgeries on $-3_1$**:\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(-3_1)$ ($p=+1$):\n        *   $\\lambda = \\frac{2}{2(1)} = 1$\n        *   $\\bar{\\mu} = - \\frac{2}{8} = -\\frac{1}{4}$\n        *   Pair: $(1, -1/4)$\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(-3_1)$ ($p=-1$):\n        *   $\\lambda = \\frac{2}{2(-1)} = -1$\n        *   $\\bar{\\mu} = - \\frac{2}{8} = -\\frac{1}{4}$\n        *   Pair: $(-1, -1/4)$\n\n4.  **Surgeries on $4_1$**:\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(4_1)$ ($p=+1$):\n        *   $\\lambda = \\frac{-2}{2(1)} = -1$\n        *   $\\bar{\\mu} = - \\frac{0}{8} = 0$\n        *   Pair: $(-1, 0)$\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(4_1)$ ($p=-1$):\n        *   $\\lambda = \\frac{-2}{2(-1)} = 1$\n        *   $\\bar{\\mu} = - \\frac{0}{8} = 0$\n        *   Pair: $(1, 0)$\n\n### Step 7: Count the number of distinct elements\n\nWe list all the distinct pairs of invariants $(\\lambda, \\bar{\\mu})$ that we found:\n1.  $(0, 0)$\n2.  $(1, 1/4)$\n3.  $(-1, 1/4)$\n4.  $(1, -1/4)$\n5.  $(-1, -1/4)$\n6.  $(-1, 0)$\n7.  $(1, 0)$\n\nAll seven pairs of invariants are distinct. Since manifolds with different homology cobordism invariants must represent different elements in the group $\\Theta_H^3$, we have found 7 distinct elements. For this set of simple manifolds (Brieskorn spheres and hyperbolic manifolds), the pair of invariants $(\\lambda, \\bar{\\mu})$ is known to be a complete invariant of their homology cobordism class.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 distinct elements of the homology cobordism group represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings."
