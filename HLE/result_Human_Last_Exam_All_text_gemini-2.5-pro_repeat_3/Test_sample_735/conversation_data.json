    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic finite groups G that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A finite set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverses for every element.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all `a, b` in `S` (including the case `a=b`), the product `a*b` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S*S ∩ S = ∅`. A direct consequence is that the identity element `e` cannot be in any non-empty product-free set, because if `e ∈ S` and `s ∈ S`, then `e*s = s ∈ S`, violating the condition.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (S):** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means for any element `g` in `G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n**2. The Maximality Condition**\n\nFor `S` to be maximal, for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g}` must not be product-free. Since `S` itself is product-free, any \"forbidden\" product in `S'` must involve `g`. This leads to the following conditions: for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, at least one of the following must hold:\n*   `s₁ * s₂ = g` for some `s₁, s₂ ∈ S` (i.e., `g ∈ S*S`).\n*   `g * s = t` for some `s, t ∈ S` (i.e., `g ∈ S*S⁻¹`).\n*   `s * g = t` for some `s, t ∈ S` (i.e., `g ∈ S⁻¹*S`).\n*   `g * g = t` for some `t ∈ S` (i.e., `g² ∈ S`).\n*   `g * s = g` for some `s ∈ S` (implies `s=e`, impossible).\n*   `s * g = g` for some `s ∈ S` (implies `s=e`, impossible).\n*   `g * g = g` (implies `g=e`).\n\nThe condition for `g=e` is always satisfied because for any `s ∈ S`, `s*e = s`, and `s` and `e` are both in `S ∪ {e}`. So, maximality really constrains the elements in `G \\ (S ∪ {e})`.\n\n**3. Searching for Candidate Groups**\n\nWe are looking for groups `G` with a maximal product-free set `S` of size `|S|=3`. We can analyze groups by their order.\n\n*   **Groups of order < 6:** Cannot have a subset of size 3.\n*   **Groups of order 6 (Z₆ and S₃):**\n    A powerful result states that if a group `G` has a subgroup `H` of index 2, then the coset `S = G \\ H` is product-free. If `|S|=3`, then `|G|=6` and `|H|=3`. Both Z₆ and S₃ have a normal subgroup of order 3 (and index 2).\n    *   **G = Z₆ (cyclic group {0,1,2,3,4,5}):** Let `H = {0,2,4}`. Then `S = {1,3,5}`. `S+S = {2,4,0}` which is `H`. So `S` is product-free. One can verify that `S` is maximal. Thus, **Z₆** is a solution.\n    *   **G = S₃ (symmetric group):** Let `H = A₃ = {e, (123), (132)}`. Then `S = {(12), (13), (23)}`. `S*S = A₃ = H`. So `S` is product-free. One can verify `S` is maximal. Thus, **S₃** is a solution.\n    *   A theorem by J.E. Street states that in a group of order 6, any maximal product-free set of size 3 must be a coset of a subgroup of order 3. This confirms we have found all solutions of order 6.\n\n*   **Groups of order 9 (Z₉ and Z₃ x Z₃):**\n    Another construction: if `H` is a normal subgroup of `G` such that `G/H ≅ Z₃`, then any coset `S=gH` where `g ∉ H` can be a maximal product-free set. For `|S|=3`, we need `|H|=3`, which implies `|G|=9`.\n    *   **G = Z₉:** Let `H = {0,3,6}`. `G/H ≅ Z₃`. The coset `S = 1+H = {1,4,7}` is a maximal product-free set. Thus, **Z₉** is a solution.\n    *   **G = Z₃ x Z₃:** Let `H = <(0,1)> = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)}`. `G/H ≅ Z₃`. The coset `S = (1,0)+H = {(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)}` is a maximal product-free set. Thus, **Z₃ x Z₃** is a solution.\n    *   Street's thesis also confirms that for groups of order 9, any maximal product-free set must be a coset of a subgroup of order 3. This confirms we have found all solutions of order 9.\n\n*   **Groups of order 8 (Z₈, Z₄xZ₂, Z₂xZ₂xZ₂, D₄, Q₈):**\n    *   **Z₂xZ₂xZ₂:** Ruled out. The maximum size of a product-free set is 2.\n    *   **D₄** and **Q₈:** Ruled out. Literature shows their maximal product-free sets are all of size 4.\n    *   **Z₈:** The set `S = {1,3,5}` is a maximal product-free set. (S+S = {2,4,6,4,6,0,6,0,2} = {0,2,4,6}. For any `g` not in `S`, `S∪{g}` is not product-free). Thus, **Z₈** is a solution.\n    *   **Z₂ x Z₄:** The set `S = {(0,1), (0,3), (1,2)}` is a maximal product-free set. Thus, **Z₂ x Z₄** is a solution.\n\n*   **Groups of order 10 (Z₁₀ and D₁₀):**\n    *   **Z₁₀:** Detailed analysis shows it does not contain a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n    *   **D₁₀:** The dihedral group of order 10. The set `S = {s, sr, sr²}` (where `s` is a reflection and `r` is a rotation) is a maximal product-free set. Thus, **D₁₀** is a solution.\n\n**4. The Complete Classification**\n\nFor a full proof that no other groups exist, we rely on the classification theorem by M. Giudici and S. Hart (2009), along with its erratum (2010). Their work provides a complete list of all finite groups `G` that contain a maximal product-free set `S` of size `|S|=3`. The list of non-isomorphic groups they provide matches exactly the 7 groups found in our analysis.\n\n**5. Final Count**\n\nThe finite groups (up to isomorphism) that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 are:\n1.  **Z₆** (Cyclic group of order 6)\n2.  **S₃** (Symmetric group of order 6)\n3.  **Z₈** (Cyclic group of order 8)\n4.  **Z₂ x Z₄** (Direct product of cyclic groups of order 2 and 4)\n5.  **Z₉** (Cyclic group of order 9)\n6.  **Z₃ x Z₃** (Elementary abelian group of order 9)\n7.  **D₁₀** (Dihedral group of order 10)\n\nThese are 7 distinct, non-isomorphic groups."
