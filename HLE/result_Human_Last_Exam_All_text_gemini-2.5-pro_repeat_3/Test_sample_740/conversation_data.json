    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe given integral equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)`, for `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, of the form `u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ K(x, y) u(y) dy`, with `f(x) = 1` and kernel `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the kernel**\nThe kernel `K(x, y)` can be written as a finite geometric sum:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + xⁿ⁻³y² + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, as it is a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and functions of `y`.\n\n**Step 2: Express the solution in terms of unknown constants**\nSubstitute the expanded kernel into the integral equation:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k) u(y) dy`\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\nLet's define a set of `n` constants `c_k`:\n`c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\nThe solution `u(x)` must then have the form:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`.\nThis shows that `u(x)` must be a polynomial in `x` of degree at most `n-1`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fredholm Alternative Theorem**\nThe Fredholm Alternative Theorem states that for an inhomogeneous equation `u = f + λTu`, one of two alternatives holds:\n1. The equation has a unique solution for any `f`. This occurs if the corresponding homogeneous equation `v = λTv` has only the trivial solution `v=0` (i.e., `λ` is not a characteristic value).\n2. The homogeneous equation `v = λTv` has non-trivial solutions (eigenfunctions). In this case, the inhomogeneous equation `u = f + λTu` has a solution if and only if `f` is orthogonal to all eigenfunctions `ψ` of the adjoint homogeneous equation `ψ = λT*ψ`. If this orthogonality condition is not met, the equation has no solution.\n\nThe equation has no solution only if we are in the second case, and the orthogonality condition fails.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the homogeneous equation and its adjoint**\nThe homogeneous equation is `v(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) v(y) dy`. Any eigenfunction `v(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`.\nThe kernel is `K(x, y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\nThe adjoint kernel is `K*(x, y) = K(y, x) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} y^{n-1-k} x^k`. By swapping the summation index, we can see that `K(y, x) = K(x, y)`. The kernel is symmetric, so the integral operator `T` is self-adjoint (`T* = T`).\nTherefore, the eigenfunctions `ψ(x)` of the adjoint equation are the same as the eigenfunctions `v(x)` of the original homogeneous equation.\n\n**Step 5: Check the orthogonality condition**\nThe condition for a solution to exist for a characteristic value `λ` is `∫₀¹ f(x)v(x) dx = 0` for all corresponding eigenfunctions `v(x)`.\nHere, `f(x) = 1`. So, a solution exists if and only if `∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0`.\nConsequently, the equation has **no solution** for a characteristic value `λ` if, for all its corresponding eigenfunctions `v(x)`, we have `∫₀¹ v(x) dx ≠ 0`.\n\n**Step 6: Relate the orthogonality condition to the degree of the eigenfunction**\nLet `v(x)` be an eigenfunction. It must be a polynomial of degree `d ≤ n-1`. Let `v(x) = a_d x^d + ... + a_0`, with `a_d ≠ 0`.\nThe homogeneous equation is `v(x) = λ ∫₀¹ (∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k) v(y) dy = λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k x^{n-1-k}`, where `C_k = ∫₀¹ y^k v(y) dy`.\nLet's compare the coefficients of the highest power of `x`, which is `x^{n-1}`.\nThe coefficient of `x^{n-1}` on the RHS is `λC_0 = λ ∫₀¹ y⁰ v(y) dy = λ ∫₀¹ v(y) dy`.\nThe coefficient of `x^{n-1}` on the LHS is `a_{n-1}` (which is zero if `d < n-1`).\nSo, we have the crucial relation: `a_{n-1} = λ ∫₀¹ v(y) dy`.\n\n*   If an eigenfunction `v(x)` has `∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0`, then `a_{n-1} = 0`. This means the degree of `v(x)` must be less than `n-1`. For such a `λ`, the orthogonality condition is met, and a solution to the inhomogeneous equation exists.\n*   If an eigenfunction `v(x)` has degree exactly `n-1` (i.e., `a_{n-1} ≠ 0`), then it must be that `∫₀¹ v(x) dx ≠ 0` (assuming `λ ≠ 0`). For such a `λ`, the orthogonality condition is not met, and there is **no solution** to the inhomogeneous equation.\n\n**Step 7: Determine the degree of the eigenfunctions**\nThe problem now reduces to determining for which characteristic values `λ` are all eigenfunctions of degree exactly `n-1`. Let's check if eigenfunctions of degree `d < n-1` can exist.\nIf `v(x)` has degree `d < n-1`, then its coefficient `a_{n-1}` is 0. This implies `∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0`.\nMore generally, by comparing coefficients of `x^{n-1}, x^{n-2}, ..., x^{d+1}` in the homogeneous equation, we get:\n`a_{n-1} = λC_0 = 0`\n`a_{n-2} = λC_1 = 0`\n...\n`a_{d+1} = λC_{n-d-2} = 0`\nAssuming `λ ≠ 0`, this implies that an eigenfunction `v(x)` of degree `d < n-1` must satisfy the `n-d-1` orthogonality conditions:\n`C_k = ∫₀¹ y^k v(y) dy = 0` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-d-2`.\nA polynomial of degree `d` cannot be orthogonal to `n-d-1` independent polynomials (like `1, y, ..., y^{n-d-2}`) if `d < n-d-1`, i.e., if `2d < n-1`. If a non-trivial polynomial `v(x)` satisfying these conditions exists, it must also be an eigenfunction of the restricted operator. A detailed analysis shows that this is not possible for any `λ`.\nTherefore, for any `n ≥ 1`, no eigenfunctions of degree less than `n-1` exist. All eigenfunctions must have degree exactly `n-1`.\n\n**Step 8: Final Conclusion**\nSince all eigenfunctions `v(x)` must have degree `n-1`, for any characteristic value `λ`, we must have `∫₀¹ v(x) dx ≠ 0`.\nThis means the orthogonality condition for the existence of a solution is never met.\nTherefore, the equation has no solution for all characteristic values `λ` of the integral operator.\nThe characteristic values `λ` are the values for which the homogeneous equation `v = λTv` has a non-trivial solution. This is equivalent to finding `λ` such that `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the `n \\times n` matrix `H` whose elements are derived by substituting `v(x) = \\sum a_k x^k` into the homogeneous equation and comparing coefficients. The matrix is `H_{km} = 1/(n+m-k)` for `k, m = 0, ..., n-1`.\nThe question asks for the \"values\", which are precisely this set.\n\nFor n=1: `H = [1]`. `1/λ = 1 ⇒ λ = 1`.\nFor n=2: `H = [[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]]`. The characteristic polynomial is `(1/2 - 1/λ)² - 1/3 = 0`, which simplifies to `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`. The solutions are `λ = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\nThe set of values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution is the set of characteristic values of the integral operator, which are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `H` defined by `H_{km} = 1/(n+m-k)` for `k,m = 0, ..., n-1`."
