    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(3).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **a(n):** This is a function that counts a specific type of Feynman diagram.\n    *   **Feynman diagrams:** These are pictorial representations used in quantum field theory to describe particle interactions.\n    *   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** The specific theory we are working in, which describes the interaction between electrons (matter) and photons (light).\n    *   **Order 2n:** In QED, the fundamental interaction is a vertex where two electron lines meet one photon line. The \"order\" of a diagram refers to the number of such vertices. So, an order 2n diagram has 2n vertices.\n    *   **Electron or the photon propagators:** We are interested in diagrams that describe the propagation of a single particle (an electron or a photon) from one point to another, including all its self-interactions. These are also known as \"self-energy\" diagrams. They have two external lines of the same type (either two electron lines or two photon lines).\n    *   **Non-vanishing:** This means we only count diagrams that give a non-zero contribution. In this context, it means we are counting the number of topologically distinct diagrams that are allowed by the rules of QED. This is generally understood to mean the number of one-particle-irreducible (1PI) diagrams, which are the fundamental building blocks for these calculations.\n    *   **The Goal:** We need to find **a(3)**. This means we need to find the number of these diagrams at order 2n = 2 * 3 = 6. In other words, we need to find the number of 6-vertex Feynman diagrams for the electron or photon propagator.\n\n2.  **Identify the Mathematical Sequence:**\n    The problem of counting these diagrams is a well-known problem in mathematical physics. The number of 1PI diagrams for the electron self-energy at order 2n is known to be the same as the number of 1PI diagrams for the photon self-energy at order 2n. This number is precisely what the function a(n) represents.\n\n3.  **Determine the First Few Terms of the Sequence a(n):**\n    *   **For n=1 (Order 2):** There is 1 diagram for the electron propagator (an electron emits and reabsorbs a virtual photon) and 1 diagram for the photon propagator (a photon briefly becomes a virtual electron-positron pair). Thus, **a(1) = 1**.\n    *   **For n=2 (Order 4):** There are 2 distinct 1PI diagrams for the electron propagator and 2 distinct 1PI diagrams for the photon propagator. Thus, **a(2) = 2**.\n    *   **For n=3 (Order 6):** This is the value we need to find. We need to determine the number of distinct 1PI diagrams with 6 vertices.\n\n4.  **Consult Authoritative Sources:**\n    Drawing all the diagrams of order 6 is complex and prone to error. It is standard practice to refer to established results from the physics literature or mathematical databases.\n    *   The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) lists this sequence as A000698, titled \"Number of connected Feynman diagrams for the electron or photon propagator in QED at order 2n.\"\n    *   The sequence is given as: a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, **a(3) = 10**, a(4) = 74, a(5) = 706, ...\n    *   This result is confirmed in numerous physics textbooks and research papers on quantum field theory, such as those by Broadhurst, Kreimer, and Bogomolny, who have studied the combinatorics of Feynman diagrams extensively.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the established results for counting Feynman diagrams in QED, the number of non-vanishing diagrams of order 6 (which corresponds to n=3) for the electron or photon propagator is 10.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe value of a(3) is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
