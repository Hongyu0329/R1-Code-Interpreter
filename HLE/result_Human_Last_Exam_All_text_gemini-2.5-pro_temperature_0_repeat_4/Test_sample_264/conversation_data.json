    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the initial setup and coordinate system.**\nLet's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a standard 3D Cartesian coordinate system. We can define its boundaries by placing one vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) and the opposite vertex at (1, 1, 1).\n*   **Cube A:** The set of all points (x, y, z) such that `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n*   The side length of Cube A is 1, and its volume is `1³ = 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the shift and define the second cube.**\nThe problem states the second cube is \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" relative to the first.\n*   **Main Diagonal:** The main diagonal of Cube A connects opposite vertices. We'll use the diagonal from the origin (0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is `d = (1, 1, 1)`.\n*   **Interpreting the Shift:** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most naturally interpreted as a shift vector `S` that is `1/2` times the diagonal vector `d`.\n    *   Shift Vector `S = (1/2) * d = 1/2 * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n*   **Cube B:** The second cube, Cube B, is obtained by shifting every point of Cube A by the vector `S`. We find its boundaries by adding `1/2` to the coordinate ranges of Cube A.\n    *   x-range: `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   y-range: `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   z-range: `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the region of intersection.**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that is part of both Cube A and Cube B. To find this region, we must find the overlap in the coordinate ranges for each dimension.\n*   **x-dimension:** The region must satisfy both `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` (for Cube A) and `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2` (for Cube B). The intersection of these two intervals is `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n*   **y-dimension:** Similarly, the region must satisfy `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` and `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`. The intersection is `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\n*   **z-dimension:** The region must satisfy `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`. The intersection is `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\nThe intersection is a new, smaller cube defined by these overlapping ranges.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\nThe intersection is a cube whose sides are defined by the intervals found in the previous step.\n*   Side length in x-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   Side length in y-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   Side length in z-direction: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths.\n*   Volume = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Interpretation of the Shift:** The most crucial point is interpreting the phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". The interpretation of the shift vector as `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)` is standard for such problems and leads to a clean, symmetric result. An alternative (a shift of distance 1/2) is less likely as it would be phrased differently and result in a more complex answer.\n2.  **Axis-Alignment:** The problem is greatly simplified because the cubes remain aligned with the coordinate axes after the shift. This allows us to analyze each dimension (x, y, z) independently.\n3.  **Intersection of Intervals:** The core of the calculation is finding the intersection of one-dimensional intervals for each coordinate. The length of the intersection of `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` is `max(0, min(b, d) - max(a, c))`. For our x-dimension, this is `min(1, 3/2) - max(0, 1/2) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n\nThe final volume of the intersection is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
