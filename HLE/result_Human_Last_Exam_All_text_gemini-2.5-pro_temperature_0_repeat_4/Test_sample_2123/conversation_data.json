    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The key elements are:\n    *   A Russian text, specifically the \"Russian translation of a certain essay.\"\n    *   The text describes the \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\"\n    *   In this description, the \"surname of an English poet\" is mentioned.\n    *   The goal is to provide this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source Text:** The question points to a well-known passage in Russian literature. The author is the Russian poet and essayist Osip Mandelstam, and the work is his essay \"Journey to Armenia\" (\"Путешествие в Армению\"), written in 1933.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The question states it's a \"Russian translation of an essay.\" This is a slight misdirection. The essay was originally written in Russian by Mandelstam. The core of the clue remains valid, but it's important to recognize this potential inaccuracy in the question's phrasing.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Passage:** In the essay, Mandelstam describes the streets of Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. He contrasts them with the grand, established boulevards of major European cities. He uses a striking metaphor to capture the feeling of a wide, straight street.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The question mentions the \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\" While Mandelstam doesn't explicitly name Vienna in the key sentence, he mentions other famous European thoroughfares (Nevsky Prospekt in St. Petersburg, Boulevard Haussmann in Paris). Vienna's Ringstrasse is a prime example of the type of grand, wide boulevard he is evoking. The question uses Vienna as a specific example of this general concept.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Metaphor:** The crucial sentence from Mandelstam's essay is:\n    > \"Это нечто вроде широченной рифмы, вроде двустишия **Байрона**.\"\n\n    Translated into English, this means:\n    > \"It is something like a very wide rhyme, like a couplet by **Byron**.\"\n\n5.  **Identify the Poet's Surname:**\n    *   The surname mentioned in the Russian text is **\"Байрона\"** (Bayrona).\n    *   This is the genitive case (possessive form, \"of Byron\" or \"Byron's\") of the name **\"Байрон\"** (Bayron).\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** The name refers to the famous English Romantic poet, Lord Byron.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The Russian surname \"Байрон\" corresponds directly to the English surname \"Byron\". Therefore, the surname of the English poet is Byron.\n\n<<<Byron>>>"
