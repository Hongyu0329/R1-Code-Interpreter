    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` for a linear system defined by matrices `A` and `B`. The feedback should place the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system `A + BF` at the specified locations, which are `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Define the System and Feedback Law**\n\n*   The state matrix is `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`.\n*   The input matrix is `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`.\n*   The state feedback gain matrix `F` will be a 2x2 matrix, let's denote it as `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\n*   The closed-loop system matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`.\n\n**3. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial for a system with these eigenvalues is given by:\n`α(λ) = (λ - p1)(λ - p2) = 0`\n`α(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`α(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n`α(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`α(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`α(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`\n\n**4. Formulate the Closed-Loop System's Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nFirst, calculate the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M` is `p(λ) = λ^2 - trace(M)λ + det(M) = 0`.\nLet's find the trace and determinant of `A_cl`:\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) * f2 - (1 + f2 + 2*f4) * (1 + f1)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n\n**5. Equate the Polynomials and Formulate Equations**\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of the actual characteristic polynomial `p(λ)` with the desired one `α(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`, we get:\n*   `trace(A_cl) = -2`\n*   `det(A_cl) = 2`\n\nThis gives us a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`):\n1.  `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1 = -2  =>  f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1`\n2.  `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2  =>  -f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 3`\n\n**6. Solve the System of Equations**\n\nThe system is underdetermined, meaning there are infinitely many solutions for `F`. We can find a particular solution by making a simplifying assumption. A common approach is to set some elements of `F` to zero.\n\nLet's assume we only use the first control input, which corresponds to setting the second row of `F` to zero: `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\n\nThe system of equations simplifies to:\n1.  `f1 + f2 + 2(0) = -1  =>  f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2(0) - 2(0) - 2*f1(0) = 3  =>  -f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n`(f1 + f2) + (-f1 - 2*f2) = -1 + 3`\n`-f2 = 2`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` into the first equation:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\n**7. Final Answer Formulation**\n\nWe found a solution where `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, and `f4 = 0`. Therefore, a valid state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The problem uses the closed-loop form `A + BF`, which is less common than `A - BF` but must be followed as stated.\n*   The existence of infinite solutions is a key feature of pole placement for multi-input systems. The extra degrees of freedom can be used to satisfy other design criteria.\n*   The simplifying assumption (e.g., `f3=f4=0`) is valid because the system is controllable through the first input channel (i.e., the pair `(A, b1)` is controllable, where `b1` is the first column of `B`).\n*   Other valid solutions exist. For example, assuming `f1=f2=0` would yield `F = [[0, 0], [-0.5, -1.5]]`. Any correct solution is acceptable unless further constraints are given.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
