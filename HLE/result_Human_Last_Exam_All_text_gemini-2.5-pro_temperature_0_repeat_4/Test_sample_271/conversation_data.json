    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial and find its irreducible factors.**\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe try to find a factorization by grouping terms.\nNotice the coefficients of the last three terms are multiples of 3: $3x^2 + 18x - 6 = 3(x^2 + 6x - 2)$.\nLet's try to find a factor of the form $(x^2 - a)$ or $(x^3 - a)$.\nLet's try grouping terms that have a common factor of $(x^2-2)$:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nSo, the polynomial $f(x)$ factors into two polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$h(x) = x^2 - 2$\n$g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of each factor over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nFor $h(x) = x^2 - 2$:\nThe roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2).\n\nFor $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:\n1.  **Irreducibility:** We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The coefficients are 1, 0, 0, -9, 3. The prime 3 divides all coefficients except the leading one (1). The constant term 3 is not divisible by $p^2=9$. Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Galois Group:** Since $g(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, its Galois group $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_5$. The order of $G_g$ is divisible by 5, so it contains a 5-cycle.\n    To further identify the group, we find the number of real roots of $g(x)$.\n    The derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    Let's evaluate $g(x)$ at these critical points:\n    -   $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 - 9(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) + 3 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}(9/5 - 9) + 3 = 3 - \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. Since $\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > \\sqrt[4]{1} = 1$, we have $\\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 7.2$, so $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) < 0$.\n    -   $g(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -(\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 + 9(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) + 3 = 3 + \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 0$.\n    Since $g(x)$ has a local maximum greater than 0 and a local minimum less than 0, it must have exactly three real roots. The other two roots must be a complex conjugate pair.\n    A subgroup of $S_5$ that contains a 5-cycle (from irreducibility of degree 5) and a transposition (from complex conjugation swapping the two non-real roots) must be the entire group $S_5$.\n    So, $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, and the degree of the splitting field extension is $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the splitting field K.**\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its factors, i.e., $K = K_g K_h = K_g(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the direct product $G_g \\times G_h \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe order of the group is given by $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}][K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_g \\cap K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]}$.\nWe need to determine the intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe intersection is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so it is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nIf $K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ would be a subfield of $K_g$.\nBy Galois theory, quadratic subfields of $K_g$ correspond to index-2 normal subgroups of $G_g = S_5$. The only such subgroup is the alternating group $A_5$. The corresponding subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\nFor a quintic of the form $x^5+px+q$, the discriminant is $D = 2^8 p^5 + 5^5 q^4$. For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $p=-9$ and $q=3$.\n$D = 256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, which is an imaginary quadratic field.\nSince $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field, they cannot be the same.\nTherefore, $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K_g:\\mathbb{Q}][K_h:\\mathbb{Q}] = 120 \\cdot 2 = 240$, and the Galois group is the direct product $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible degrees of normal intermediate extensions.**\nWe are looking for the degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, such extensions $L$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ include subgroups of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\triangleleft G_1$ and $N_2 \\triangleleft G_2$, as well as \"diagonal\" subgroups arising from isomorphisms between quotient groups of $N_1$ and $N_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$ are:\n1.  **Product type:**\n    -   $\\{e\\} \\times C_2$: order is 2.\n    -   $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: order is $|A_5| = 60$.\n    -   $A_5 \\times C_2$: order is $60 \\times 2 = 120$.\n    -   $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: order is $|S_5| = 120$.\n2.  **Diagonal type:** These arise from isomorphisms $\\phi: N_1/K_1 \\to N_2/K_2$. The only non-trivial case here is an isomorphism from a quotient of $S_5$ to a quotient of $C_2$. The only non-trivial quotient of $S_5$ is $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$. The only non-trivial quotient of $C_2$ is $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$. This gives rise to a normal subgroup $H_d = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(g) = c\\}$, where we identify $C_2$ with $\\{1, -1\\}$. The order of this subgroup is 120.\n\nSo, the orders of the proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ are 2, 60, and 120.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the corresponding degrees.**\nThe degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the index $[G:H] = |G|/|H| = 240/|H|$.\n-   If $|H|=2$, the degree is $240/2 = 120$.\n-   If $|H|=60$, the degree is $240/60 = 4$.\n-   If $|H|=120$, the degree is $240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees for such normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
