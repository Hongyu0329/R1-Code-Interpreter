No, it is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and GÃ¶del's ontological proof operate in fundamentally different, incommensurable domains (physics vs. formal logic/metaphysics). The core concepts such as "property," "possibility," and "existence" have entirely different meanings in each context, making it a category error to apply the tools of one to the other.
