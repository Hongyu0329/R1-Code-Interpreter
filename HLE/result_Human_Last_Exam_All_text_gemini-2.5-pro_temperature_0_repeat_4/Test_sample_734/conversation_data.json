    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian who meets several criteria:\n1.  **He was a Christian theologian.** This narrows the field to figures within the history of Christian thought.\n2.  **He was the *first* to develop *specialized terminology*.** This is a crucial point. We are not just looking for someone who discussed these topics, but for an originator of a specific conceptual vocabulary.\n3.  **The terminology describes *changes in the laws of nature*.** This points to a theologian who engaged with philosophy and the natural world, considering how divine action relates to the regular, observable patterns of nature.\n4.  **The terminology is applicable to two specific events:**\n    *   The virgin birth of Jesus (a unique, singular miracle).\n    *   Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall (a fundamental, ongoing shift in the state of the created order).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Theological Concepts**\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** This is a classic example of a miracle. Theologically, it is explained as a direct act of God that supersedes the normal biological process of human conception. A theologian explaining this would need a framework that allows for God to act outside the \"ordinary course of nature.\"\n*   **The Fall and Natural Law:** The idea that the Fall of Adam and Eve affected not just humanity's spiritual state but also the physical world (introducing death, decay, disease, natural disasters, etc.) is a specific theological position. Explaining this requires a concept of how the \"laws of nature\" themselves could be altered from a primordial, perfect state to their current, \"fallen\" state.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Potential Candidates**\n*   **Early Church Fathers (pre-Augustine):** While figures like Irenaeus and Athanasius wrote about the incarnation and creation, they did not typically develop a systematic, philosophical terminology for the mechanics of nature and miracles in the way the question implies.\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** Aquinas developed a highly sophisticated system of primary and secondary causality. God is the Primary Cause, who normally works through secondary causes (the laws of nature). A miracle is when God bypasses the secondary cause and acts directly. This framework is excellent for explaining the virgin birth. However, he is building on earlier thought, and the question asks for the *first* to develop such terminology.\n*   **The Protestant Reformers (16th Century):** Figures like Martin Luther and John Calvin affirmed these biblical events but their primary focus was on soteriology (salvation) and ecclesiology (the church). They were not known for creating new philosophical terminology about the laws of nature in this specific way.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (4th-5th Century):** Augustine is the strongest candidate. He wrote extensively on creation (especially in his commentary *De Genesi ad litteram* - \"The Literal Meaning of Genesis\"), miracles, and God's providence. He was deeply engaged with the relationship between God's will and the natural order.\n\n**Step 4: Examine Augustine's Specific Terminology**\nAugustine developed a unique and influential framework to address exactly these kinds of problems. The key specialized term he developed is ***rationes seminales*** (or *rationes causales*), which can be translated as \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal principles.\"\n\n*   **What are *rationes seminales*?** Augustine proposed that at the initial moment of creation, God embedded latent potentialities—the \"seeds\" of everything that would ever come to be—into matter.\n*   **How does this explain the \"laws of nature\"?** The \"ordinary course of nature\" is the gradual, predictable unfolding of these pre-programmed seminal reasons over time. A tree grows from a seed because God placed that potential within creation from the beginning.\n*   **How does this apply to the Virgin Birth?** A miracle, for Augustine, is not God violating His own laws or creating something entirely new *ex nihilo* after the initial creation week. Instead, it is God directly activating a *ratio seminalis* that would not have unfolded in the ordinary course of nature. The potential for a virgin birth was woven into creation by God from the beginning, and He chose to actualize it at a specific moment in history. It is extraordinary, but not \"unnatural\" from the perspective of God the Creator, who is master of these principles.\n*   **How does this apply to the Fall?** Augustine argued that the Fall introduced death, decay, and suffering into the world. In his framework, this can be understood as a fundamental change in the *conditions* under which the seminal reasons operate. Before the Fall, the human body's seminal principles were such that it was immortal (*posse non mori* - able not to die). After the Fall, due to sin, these principles were altered or corrupted, leading to an inevitable state of decay and death (*non posse non mori* - not able not to die). This represents a fundamental \"alteration in the laws of nature\" as they apply to humanity and creation.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nAugustine of Hippo was the first major Christian theologian to develop a specialized and systematic terminology—centered on the concept of ***rationes seminales***—that could coherently account for both unique miracles like the virgin birth and a fundamental shift in the operation of the natural world as a result of the Fall. He provides a single, sophisticated framework applicable to both scenarios as required by the question.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
