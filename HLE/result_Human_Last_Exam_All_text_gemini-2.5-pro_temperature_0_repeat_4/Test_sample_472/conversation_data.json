    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Meter and Initial Syllable Count**\nThe line is from Roman comedy (Terence, *Andria* 919) and is written in **iambic senarius**. This meter consists of six iambic feet, for a total of 12 syllables. The basic pattern is S L | S L | S L | S L | S L | S L, but substitutions are very common.\nA simple count of the syllables as written gives:\n`et (1) ti-bi (2) be-ne (2) es-se (2) so-li (2) quom (1) si-bi (2) sit (1) ma-le (2) = 15 syllables.`\nThis is three syllables too long, so we must look for syllable compression techniques common in this type of verse.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Rules of Syllable Compression**\nTo reduce the syllable count from 15 to the required 12, we must identify instances of elision and synizesis.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Elision.** When a word ending in a vowel (or -m) is followed by a word beginning with a vowel (or h-), the first vowel is dropped (elided). In our line, `bene` ends in `-e` and `esse` begins with `e-`. Therefore, `bene esse` is pronounced as one unit, `ben'esse`. This reduces the syllable count by one, to 14.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Synizesis.** We still need to eliminate two more syllables. In comic verse, short iambic words like `tibi` (S S) and `sibi` (S S) are frequently compressed into a single long syllable through synizesis (e.g., `tibi` becomes `tibj`, `sibi` becomes `sibj`). Applying this to both words reduces the syllable count by two more, bringing the total to the required 12.\n\n**Step 3: Determine Syllable Quantities in the Compressed Line**\nAfter applying these changes, the line is scanned as if it were written: `et tibj ben'esse soli quom sibj sit male`. Now we determine the quantity (Long 'L' or Short 'S') of each of the 12 syllables.\n\n1.  `et`: Short by nature. **(S)**\n2.  `tibj`: Long due to synizesis. **(L)**\n3.  `be-`: The first syllable of the elided `ben'esse`. It is short. **(S)**\n4.  `-nes-`: The second syllable, formed from `ne` + `es`. The syllable `es-` in `esse` is long by position (followed by two consonants, `ss`). Thus, `-nes-` is long. **(L)**\n5.  `-se`: The final syllable of `ben'esse`. It is short. **(S)**\n6.  `so-`: The first syllable of `soli`. It is long by nature (from *s≈çlus*). **(L)**\n7.  `-li`: The second syllable of `soli`. It is short. **(S)**\n8.  `quom`: Long by position, as it ends in a consonant (`m`) and is followed by a word starting with a consonant (`s` in `sibj`). **(L)**\n9.  `sibj`: Long due to synizesis. **(L)**\n10. `sit`: Long by position, as it ends in a consonant (`t`) and is followed by a word starting with a consonant (`m` in `male`). **(L)**\n11. `ma-`: The first syllable of `male`. It is short. **(S)**\n12. `-le`: The second syllable of `male`. It is short. **(S)**\n\n**Step 4: Group Syllables into Feet**\nFinally, we group the 12 syllables and their quantities into the six feet of the iambic senarius.\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et tibj` = **S L** (Iamb)\n*   **Foot 2:** `be nes-` = **S L** (Iamb)\n*   **Foot 3:** `-se so-` = **S L** (Iamb)\n*   **Foot 4:** `-li quom` = **S L** (Iamb)\n*   **Foot 5:** `sibj sit` = **L L** (Spondee, a common substitution)\n*   **Foot 6:** `ma- -le` = **S S** (Pyrrhic, allowed in the final position)\n\nThe complete scansion is a regular sequence of four iambs, followed by a spondee and a final pyrrhic.\n\n<<<S L S L S L S L L L S S>>>"
