Let the given partition of n be $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_r$. Let $v_1, \dots, v_k$ be the distinct values among the $a_i$'s, and let $m_j$ be the number of times the value $v_j$ appears in the partition. The number of Tverberg's partitions of X is given by the formula for the number of partitions of a set of n elements into unlabeled parts of specified sizes:
$$ \frac{n!}{a_1! a_2! \cdots a_r! \cdot m_1! m_2! \cdots m_k!} $$
