    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** The question specifies a \"not necessarily metric\" continuum. In topology, this refers to a **compact, connected, Hausdorff space**.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. That is, if $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are both continua contained in $X$, then either $A = X$ or $B = X$.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $x$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $x$, denoted $C(x)$, is the set of all points $y \\in X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$. The relation \"$y$ is in the same composant as $x$\" is an equivalence relation, and the composants are the equivalence classes. They form a partition of the continuum $X$.\n\n### Step 2: Relating Indecomposability to the Number of Composants\n\nA fundamental theorem in continuum theory connects the property of decomposability to the number of composants.\n\n*   **Theorem:** A continuum $X$ is decomposable if and only if it has exactly one composant.\n\nLet's briefly consider why this is true:\n1.  **Decomposable ⇒ One Composant:** If $X$ is decomposable, say $X = A \\cup B$ with $A, B$ being proper subcontinua, one can show that for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both. This means all points belong to the same composant.\n2.  **One Composant ⇒ Decomposable:** If a continuum has only one composant, it means for any two points, there's a proper subcontinuum containing them. This property can be shown to imply that the continuum must be decomposable. While the proof for metric spaces often uses the Baire Category Theorem, the result holds for general non-metric continua as well and is considered a classical theorem in the field.\n\nFrom this theorem, we can draw a crucial conclusion for indecomposable continua:\n\n*   **Conclusion:** A continuum $X$ is **indecomposable** if and only if it has **more than one** composant.\n\nThis establishes a lower bound on the number of composants for an indecomposable continuum. The number must be strictly greater than 1. Therefore, the smallest possible integer value is 2.\n\n### Step 3: Determining if Two Composants is Possible\n\nNow we know the number of composants must be at least 2. The next question is whether a value of 2 is actually achievable.\n\n*   **Case 1: Separable (e.g., Metric) Continua:** If we restrict ourselves to separable continua (which includes all metric continua), there is another important theorem. It states that in an indecomposable separable continuum, every composant is a \"meager\" or \"first category\" set (a countable union of nowhere dense sets). By the Baire Category Theorem, the continuum itself (being a compact Hausdorff space) is a \"Baire space\" and cannot be a meager set. If there were only a countable number of composants (e.g., 2, 3, or countably infinite), the entire continuum would be a countable union of meager sets, which is itself a meager set. This is a contradiction. Therefore, any **indecomposable separable continuum must have an uncountable number of composants** (specifically, it has $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants).\n\n*   **Case 2: Non-Metric Continua:** The question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric\". This is the critical point. The Baire category argument used above fails for non-separable spaces because a composant may no longer be a meager set. This opens the possibility of having a finite number of composants greater than one.\n\nIndeed, this possibility was realized by the Polish mathematician Stanisław Mazurkiewicz.\n\n*   **Mazurkiewicz's Example (1930):** Mazurkiewicz constructed an example of a **non-metric indecomposable continuum that has exactly two composants**.\n\nThis construction is complex, but its existence is a well-established result in topology. It confirms that the number 2 is not just a theoretical lower bound but an attainable value for the number of composants in an indecomposable continuum, provided the continuum is not required to be metric.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant. This means the minimum number is at least 2.\n2.  There exists a (necessarily non-metric) indecomposable continuum that has exactly two composants.\n3.  Combining these two facts, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
