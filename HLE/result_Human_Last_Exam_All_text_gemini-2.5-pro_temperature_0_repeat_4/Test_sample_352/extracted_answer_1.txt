The best replacement for the S-E-E-D sequence at positions 47-50 would be to mutate all four amino acids to Alanine (A). The resulting sequence would be A-A-A-A. This S47A/E48A/E49A/D50A mutant would eliminate the negative charges from the glutamate and aspartate residues and, crucially, would also remove the hydroxyl group from serine, preventing phosphorylation and the associated strong negative charge at that site. This design directly and cleanly tests the hypothesis that the negative charge of this patch is responsible for autoinhibition.
