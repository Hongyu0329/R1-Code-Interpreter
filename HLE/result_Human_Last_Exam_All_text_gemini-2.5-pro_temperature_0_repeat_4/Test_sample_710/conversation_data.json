    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number N.\n\n**Step 1: Define the set of numbers**\n\nThe problem asks for sums of distinct numbers from the set $S$ defined by the formula $s_n = 2n^2+3n+1$ for positive integers $n$.\nLet's list the first few elements of this set. The formula can be factored as $s_n = (n+1)(2n+1)$.\n*   $s_1 = (1+1)(2(1)+1) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$\n*   $s_2 = (2+1)(2(2)+1) = 3 \\times 5 = 15$\n*   $s_3 = (3+1)(2(3)+1) = 4 \\times 7 = 28$\n*   $s_4 = (4+1)(2(4)+1) = 5 \\times 9 = 45$\n*   $s_5 = (5+1)(2(5)+1) = 6 \\times 11 = 66$\n*   $s_6 = (6+1)(2(6)+1) = 7 \\times 13 = 91$\n*   $s_7 = (7+1)(2(7)+1) = 8 \\times 15 = 120$\n*   $s_8 = (8+1)(2(8)+1) = 9 \\times 17 = 153$\nSo, the set is $S = \\{6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91, 120, 153, \\dots\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a suitable method**\n\nWe are looking for the smallest integer $N$ such that any integer $x \\ge N$ can be written as a sum of distinct elements of $S$. This is a variation of the Frobenius Coin Problem, for which a standard method exists using modular arithmetic. This number $N$ is one greater than the largest number that cannot be expressed in the desired form (this largest number is called the conductor or Frobenius number of the set of subset sums).\n\nThe method is as follows:\n1.  Check that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in $S$ is 1. If $\\gcd(S) = d > 1$, only multiples of $d$ can be formed.\n    $\\gcd(6, 15) = 3$.\n    $\\gcd(6, 15, 28) = \\gcd(3, 28) = 1$.\n    Since the GCD of all elements is 1, it is possible that all sufficiently large integers are representable.\n2.  Choose a suitable element $a$ from the set $S$. The smallest element, $a=s_1=6$, is a good choice.\n3.  For each residue class $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ modulo $a=6$, find the smallest number $w_j$ that can be formed by a sum of distinct elements from the set $S' = S \\setminus \\{a\\}$.\n4.  The largest number that cannot be represented as a sum of distinct elements of $S$ is given by the formula $g(S) = \\max_{j}(w_j) - a$.\n5.  The number $N$ we are looking for is $N = g(S) + 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the method**\n\nLet $a = s_1 = 6$. The set $S'$ is $\\{15, 28, 45, 66, 91, 120, 153, \\dots\\}$.\nWe need to find the residues of the elements of $S'$ modulo 6:\n*   $s_2 = 15 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 6$\n*   $s_3 = 28 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 6$\n*   $s_4 = 45 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 6$\n*   $s_5 = 66 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$\n*   $s_6 = 91 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$\n*   $s_7 = 120 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$\n*   $s_8 = 153 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 6$\n*   $s_9 = 190 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 6$\n\nNow, we find the smallest sum of distinct elements from $S'$ for each residue class modulo 6.\n\n*   **$w_0$ (residue 0):** We need a sum $\\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$.\n    - Single elements from $S'$: $s_5=66$, $s_7=120$, etc.\n    - Sum of two elements: $s_2+s_4 = 15+45=60$.\n    Comparing these, the smallest is 60. So, $w_0 = 60$.\n\n*   **$w_1$ (residue 1):** We need a sum $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$.\n    - Single elements from $S'$: $s_6=91$.\n    - Sum of two elements: $s_2+s_3 = 15+28=43$. ($3+4=7 \\equiv 1$).\n    Comparing 91 and 43, the smallest is 43. So, $w_1 = 43$.\n\n*   **$w_2$ (residue 2):** We need a sum $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 6$.\n    - No single element has residue 2.\n    - Sum of two elements: No combination of residues $\\{0,1,3,4\\}$ sums to 2.\n    - Sum of three elements: $s_2+s_3+s_6 = 15+28+91=134$. The residues are $3+4+1=8 \\equiv 2$.\n    - Another three-element sum is $s_3+s_4+s_6 = 28+45+91=164$.\n    - A two-element sum using later elements is $s_3+s_9 = 28+190=218$.\n    The smallest sum found is 134. So, $w_2 = 134$.\n\n*   **$w_3$ (residue 3):** We need a sum $\\equiv 3 \\pmod 6$.\n    - The smallest single element from $S'$ with residue 3 is $s_2=15$. Any sum would be larger.\n    So, $w_3 = 15$.\n\n*   **$w_4$ (residue 4):** We need a sum $\\equiv 4 \\pmod 6$.\n    - The smallest single element from $S'$ with residue 4 is $s_3=28$.\n    - A sum could be $s_2+s_6 = 15+91=106$.\n    The smallest is 28. So, $w_4 = 28$.\n\n*   **$w_5$ (residue 5):** We need a sum $\\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$.\n    - No single element has residue 5.\n    - Sum of two elements: $s_3+s_6 = 28+91=119$. (Residues $4+1=5$).\n    - Sum of three elements: $s_2+s_3+s_5 = 15+28+66=109$ (Residues $3+4+0=7 \\equiv 1$).\n    The smallest sum found is 119. So, $w_5 = 119$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer**\n\nWe have the set of minimum sums for each residue class:\n$W = \\{w_0, w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5\\} = \\{60, 43, 134, 15, 28, 119\\}$.\n\nThe maximum value in this set is $\\max(W) = 134$.\nThe chosen modulus is $a=6$.\n\nThe largest number that cannot be written as a sum of distinct elements of $S$ is:\n$g(S) = \\max(W) - a = 134 - 6 = 128$.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest number $N$ such that any number $\\ge N$ can be written in the desired form. This is $g(S)+1$.\n$N = 128 + 1 = 129$.\n\nFinal check of the careful points:\n- The set S is correctly identified.\n- The GCD is 1, so the problem is well-posed.\n- The modulo method is appropriate for this type of problem.\n- The calculation of the minimal sums $w_j$ for each residue class is the most critical step. The values $\\{60, 43, 134, 15, 28, 119\\}$ have been carefully checked by considering combinations of the smallest available elements for each residue.\n- The final formula $N = (\\max(w_j) - a) + 1$ is standard for this problem.\n\nThe analysis leads to the conclusion that every integer greater than or equal to 129 can be expressed as a sum of distinct numbers from the set $S$.\n\n<<<129>>>"
