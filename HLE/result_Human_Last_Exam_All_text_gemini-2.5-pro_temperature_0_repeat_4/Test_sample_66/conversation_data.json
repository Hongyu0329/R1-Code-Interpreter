    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the flag and the matrix\n1.  **The Flag of Tonga:** The flag consists of a red field with a white canton (a rectangle in the top-left corner). Inside the white canton, there is a red couped cross (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n2.  **The Matrix Representation:** We create a matrix `M` where every red pixel is assigned the value `a` and every white pixel is assigned the value `b`.\n\nLet the entire image be represented by an `m x n` matrix `M`. Let the canton be a `k x l` submatrix in the top-left corner. The matrix `M` can be represented in a block structure:\n`M = [ M_11  A_12 ]`\n    `[ A_21  A_22 ]`\nwhere:\n*   `M_11` is the `k x l` matrix for the canton. Its entries are `a` for the red cross and `b` for the surrounding white area.\n*   `A_12`, `A_21`, and `A_22` are matrices representing the red field. All their entries are `a`.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the matrix to calculate its rank\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of its row space (or column space) and is invariant under elementary row and column operations.\n\n1.  **Column Operations:** The last `n-l` columns of `M` are identical, each being a vector of `a`'s. If `a ≠ 0`, we can subtract the `(l+1)`-th column from all subsequent columns (`l+2` to `n`). This makes the last `n-l-1` columns all zero, without changing the rank. The rank of `M` is now the rank of the first `l+1` columns.\n\n2.  **Row Operations:** Similarly, the last `m-k` rows of the simplified matrix are identical, consisting of `l+1` entries of `a`. We can subtract the `(k+1)`-th row from all subsequent rows (`k+2` to `m`), making them zero rows. The rank is now determined by the first `k+1` rows.\n\nAfter these operations, the problem reduces to finding the rank of the following `(k+1) x (l+1)` matrix, let's call it `B`:\n`B = [ M_11      | a*j_k ]`\n    `[ a*j_l^T   | a     ]`\nwhere `j_k` is a `k x 1` column vector of ones, and `j_l^T` is a `1 x l` row vector of ones.\n\n3.  **Further Row Operations on B:** Let's subtract the last row of `B` (which is `[a, a, ..., a]`) from each of the first `k` rows. The `i`-th row of `B` (for `i ≤ k`) becomes `[ (row i of M_11) - a*j_l^T , a - a ]`. This gives a new matrix `B'` which is row-equivalent to `B`:\n`B' = [ M_11 - aJ | 0 ]`\n     `[ a*j_l^T   | a ]`\nwhere `J` is the `k x l` matrix of all ones, and `0` is a `k x 1` zero vector.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Rank of B':** The first `k` rows of `B'` have a zero in the last column. The last row has `a` in its last entry. If we choose `a ≠ 0`, the last row is linearly independent of the first `k` rows. Therefore, the rank of `B'` is the rank of the submatrix formed by the first `k` rows, plus one.\n    `rank(M) = rank(B) = rank(B') = rank(M_11 - aJ) + 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the rank of the canton submatrix\nNow we need to find the maximal rank of `M_11 - aJ`.\n\n1.  **Structure of `M_11 - aJ`:**\n    *   The red pixels of the cross in `M_11` have value `a`. In `M_11 - aJ`, these become `a - a = 0`.\n    *   The white pixels of the canton in `M_11` have value `b`. In `M_11 - aJ`, these become `b - a`.\n\n2.  **Introducing the Pattern Matrix `W`:** Let `W` be a `k x l` matrix of 0s and 1s that represents the pattern of the canton's background. `W_{ij} = 1` if the pixel is white, and `W_{ij} = 0` if it's part of the red cross. Then, `M_11 - aJ = (b-a)W`.\n\n3.  **Rank of `W`:** If we choose `a ≠ b`, then `b-a ≠ 0`, and `rank(M_11 - aJ) = rank(W)`.\n    So, `rank(M) = rank(W) + 1`. To maximize `rank(M)`, we need to maximize `rank(W)`.\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the rank of the pattern matrix `W`\nThe rank of `W` depends on the specific shape and position of the red cross within the canton. Since the problem does not specify these details, we can define them in a way that maximizes the rank.\n\n1.  **Shape of the Cross:** A couped cross is the union of a horizontal rectangle (`H`) and a vertical rectangle (`V`).\n    `H = [h_1, h_2] x [w_1, w_2]`\n    `V = [v_1, v_2] x [c_1, c_2]`\n    The 0s in `W` correspond to the pixels in `H U V`.\n\n2.  **Row Patterns in `W`:** A row `i` of `W` is determined by which parts of the cross it intersects. There are four possibilities for a row `i`:\n    a. It intersects neither `H` nor `V`.\n    b. It intersects `H` only.\n    c. It intersects `V` only.\n    d. It intersects both `H` and `V`.\n\n3.  **Generating Linearly Independent Rows:** By choosing the geometry of the cross appropriately, we can ensure that all four types of rows exist and are distinct. For example, we can make the row intervals `[h_1, h_2]` and `[v_1, v_2]` partially overlap, and the column intervals `[w_1, w_2]` and `[c_1, c_2]` also partially overlap. This generates four distinct types of row vectors in `W`:\n    *   `r_1 = (1, 1, ..., 1)`\n    *   `r_2`, with zeros in columns `[w_1, w_2]`\n    *   `r_3`, with zeros in columns `[c_1, c_2]`\n    *   `r_4`, with zeros in columns `[w_1, w_2] U [c_1, c_2]`\n\n4.  **Linear Independence:** These four types of row vectors can be shown to be linearly independent. Let `u_1` be the all-ones vector, `u_H` be the indicator vector for columns `[w_1, w_2]`, and `u_V` for `[c_1, c_2]`. The row space of `W` is spanned by vectors like `u_1`, `u_1-u_H`, `u_1-u_V`, and `u_1-max(u_H, u_V)`. The space spanned by these vectors is `span(u_1, u_H, u_V, max(u_H, u_V))`. It can be proven that these four generating vectors are linearly independent if the column intervals for `H` and `V` are chosen to be distinct, non-empty, and partially overlapping. Thus, it is possible to construct `W` to have a rank of 4.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nThe maximal rank of the pattern matrix `W` is 4.\nThe maximal rank of the overall matrix `M` is given by `rank(M) = rank(W) + 1`.\nMaximal `rank(M) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n\nThis maximum is achieved by choosing `a` and `b` such that `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`. For example, `a=1` and `b=2`. If we were to choose `a=0`, the rank would be `rank(W) = 4`, which is not the maximum possible."
