    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Movement (Cambré Derrière):** A cambré is a bend of the body from the waist, in any direction. A *cambré derrière* is a bend backwards. The goal is to create an elegant, arched line with the upper body while maintaining stability in the lower body.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach:**\n    *   The Vaganova method, developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia, emphasizes strength, precision, and a clean, classical line.\n    *   In a Vaganova cambré derrière, the core principle is **stability from the waist down**. The hips must remain directly over the supporting leg(s) and stay perfectly square to the front.\n    *   The bend originates from the upper and middle back. The dancer works to lift the chest towards the ceiling and bend backward without displacing the hips forward.\n    *   This creates a pure, unbroken curve in the spine but limits the absolute depth of the backbend in favor of maintaining the classical alignment.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method's Approach:**\n    *   The Balanchine method, or style, was developed by George Balanchine for his New York City Ballet. It is known for its speed, musicality, and extreme, elongated lines.\n    *   In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the aesthetic goal is often a deeper, more dramatic backbend.\n    *   To achieve this, the Balanchine technique **allows and encourages the hips to press forward**. This \"breaks\" the straight line at the hip, but it facilitates a much greater range of motion in the spine, allowing the dancer to achieve a more extreme arch.\n    *   This forward placement of the hip is a key characteristic that distinguishes the Balanchine style from more traditional classical techniques like Vaganova.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there can be stylistic differences in arm pathways, the fundamental mechanical difference is not in the arms. Both styles use arms to complement the line of the backbend.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core difference. Vaganova insists on keeping the hips stationary and square. Balanchine allows the hips to press forward to increase the bend. This is a fundamental technical distinction.\n    *   **C. Speed:** A cambré can be performed at various speeds in both techniques, depending on the exercise or choreography. While Balanchine's style is generally faster, the speed of the cambré itself is not the defining difference between the two techniques' execution of the step.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique used, not the cause of the difference. The Balanchine method typically achieves a deeper backbend *because* it allows the hips to move forward. Therefore, the hip placement is the more fundamental point of difference.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** In both techniques, the head follows the line of the spine and completes the curve. The exact angle might differ slightly due to the overall depth of the bend, but it's a secondary difference resulting from the primary distinction in torso and hip mechanics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most significant and defining technical difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova method and the Balanchine method is the placement of the hips. Vaganova requires the hips to remain stable and square, while Balanchine allows them to press forward to achieve a deeper bend.\n\n<<<B>>>"
