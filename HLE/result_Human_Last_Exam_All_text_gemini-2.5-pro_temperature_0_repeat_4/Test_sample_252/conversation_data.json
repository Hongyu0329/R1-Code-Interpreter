    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\".\n*   A **spectral volume** (also known as a hyperspectral data cube) is a 3D dataset with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). We can represent it as `I(x, y, λ)`.\n*   **From a single image** means this must be a \"snapshot\" technique. We only get one 2D measurement from a camera sensor in a single exposure. We cannot change the setup over time (e.g., by rotating a grating or using a filter wheel).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Method**\nThe method specified is **computed tomography (CT)**.\n*   Standard CT (like in medical imaging) reconstructs a 3D object by taking multiple 2D projection images from different angles around the object.\n*   In this context, the \"object\" is the 3D spectral volume `I(x, y, λ)`. The \"projections\" are created on the 2D camera sensor.\n*   The core principle of CT is that to reconstruct a 3D object, you need a set of 2D projections that view the object from a sufficient variety of angles.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Tool**\nThe tool used to create the projections is the **diffraction grating**.\n*   A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits and diffracts light into several beams traveling in different directions. The directions of these beams depend on the wavelength of the light.\n*   When light from the scene passes through a grating before hitting the sensor, it creates multiple copies of the scene image on the sensor.\n    *   The **zeroth-order** diffraction (m=0) is an undispersed image, essentially a regular black-and-white picture where all wavelengths from a point (x,y) fall on the same sensor pixel. This is a projection of the data cube along the wavelength axis.\n    *   The **first-order** (m=±1) and higher-order diffractions are spectrally dispersed. A single point source from the scene is spread into a line of colors (a spectrum). This dispersed image is a projection of the data cube from a specific \"angle\".\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Minimum Requirements for Tomography**\nThis is the crucial step. Can we reconstruct the 3D spectral volume `I(x, y, λ)` using the projections from just one simple (1D) diffraction grating?\n*   A standard **1D diffraction grating** disperses light along a single axis (let's call it the x-axis). It produces a central undispersed image (0th order) and a series of dispersed images (±1st, ±2nd orders, etc.) spread out along that one axis.\n*   In the language of tomography, all these projections represent \"views\" from angles that lie within a single plane. This is a classic \"limited-angle tomography\" problem.\n*   Reconstructing a 3D volume from projections that are all coplanar is mathematically ill-posed and generally impossible. You cannot distinguish between features that lie along the direction perpendicular to the plane of projections. In this case, you cannot fully disentangle the spatial information in the y-direction from the spectral information (λ).\n*   Therefore, a single 1D diffraction grating is **insufficient** to construct a full spectral volume.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Solution**\nTo solve the limited-angle problem, we need projections from \"angles\" that are not all in the same plane.\n*   This requires dispersing the light in at least two different, non-parallel directions.\n*   To get dispersion in a second direction (e.g., the y-axis), we need a second diffraction grating oriented perpendicularly to the first one.\n*   The combination of two perpendicular 1D gratings provides the necessary diversity of projection \"angles\". For example, it creates diffraction orders like (1,0) which is dispersed along x, (0,1) which is dispersed along y, and (1,1) which is dispersed diagonally. This set of projections is sufficient to sample the 3D data cube's information in a way that allows for tomographic reconstruction.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The question asks for the \"minimum number\". Since one grating is insufficient, the minimum must be greater than one.\n*   Two gratings (oriented at an angle to each other) are sufficient. Therefore, the minimum number is two.\n*   It is important to note that in practice, these two grating functions are often combined into a single physical component called a **2D grating** or a **crossed grating** (often implemented as a Computer-Generated Hologram, CGH). However, the question asks for the number of \"gratings\" necessary for the principle to work. The fundamental principle requires two distinct dispersion functions (i.e., the effect of two gratings). The physical implementation as a single component does not change the fundamental requirement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the principles of computed tomography, a single 1D grating provides insufficient information for reconstruction. A minimum of two non-parallel grating functions are required to provide the necessary projection diversity.\n\nFinal Answer is 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
