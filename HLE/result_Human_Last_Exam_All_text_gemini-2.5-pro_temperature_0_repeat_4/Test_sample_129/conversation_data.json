    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\nThe analysis is broken down by the number of pairs of parentheses in the expression. An expression must be syntactically valid and evaluate to True. The precedence of operators is `!` > `&` > `|`.\n\n### Case 0: No Parentheses (0 pairs)\n\nFor a valid expression with no parentheses, the number of operands (`n_op`) is one more than the number of binary operators (`n_bin`). Let `n_un` be the number of unary not operators (`!`). The total length is `n_op + n_bin + n_un = 5`. Substituting `n_op = n_bin + 1`, we get `2*n_bin + n_un = 4`.\n\n1.  **`n_bin = 2, n_un = 0`**: This implies `n_op = 3`. The structure is `O₁ B₁ O₂ B₂ O₃`.\n    *   `O₁ & O₂ & O₃`: True only for `T & T & T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `O₁ & O₂ | O₃`: This is `(O₁ & O₂) | O₃`. It's true if `O₃=T` (4 combinations for O₁, O₂) or if `O₁=T, O₂=T, O₃=F`. Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n    *   `O₁ | O₂ & O₃`: This is `O₁ | (O₂ & O₃)`. It's true if `O₁=T` (4 combinations for O₂, O₃) or if `O₁=F, O₂=T, O₃=T`. Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n    *   `O₁ | O₂ | O₃`: True for all combinations of operands except `F | F | F`. Total: 2³ - 1 = 7 expressions.\n    *   Sub-total: 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 18.\n\n2.  **`n_bin = 1, n_un = 2`**: This implies `n_op = 2`. The structure involves one binary operator and two `!` operators.\n    *   `!!O₁ B O₂`: `!!T&T`, `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`. (4 expressions)\n    *   `O₁ B !!O₂`: `T&!!T`, `T|!!T`, `F|!!T`, `T|!!F`. (4 expressions)\n    *   `!O₁ B !O₂`: `!F&!F`, `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`. (4 expressions)\n    *   Sub-total: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.\n\n3.  **`n_bin = 0, n_un = 4`**: This implies `n_op = 1`. The structure is `!!!!O`.\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!!!!F` evaluates to `F`.\n    *   Sub-total: 1.\n\n**Total for Case 0: 18 + 12 + 1 = 31.**\n\n### Case 1: One Pair of Parentheses\n\nThe expression has length 5 and contains one `(` and one `)`. We analyze the possible valid structures.\n\n1.  **`(A)` where `A` is a 3-symbol expression.**\n    *   `A = OBO`: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`. (4 expressions)\n    *   `A = !!O`: `(!!T)`. (1 expression)\n    *   Sub-total: 4 + 1 = 5.\n\n2.  **`!(A)` where `A` is a 3-symbol expression that evaluates to False.**\n    *   `A = OBO`: `T&F`, `F&T`, `F&F`, `F|F`. `!(A)` gives 4 true expressions.\n    *   `A = !!O`: `!!F`. `!(A)` gives 1 true expression.\n    *   Sub-total: 4 + 1 = 5.\n\n3.  **`!!(O)`**: The expression `!!(T)` is true. (1 expression)\n\n4.  **`(O₁) B O₂`**: Parentheses around a single operand. These are syntactically valid and distinct from expressions without them. The expression evaluates like `O₁ B O₂`.\n    *   True expressions: `(T)&T`, `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`. (4 expressions)\n\n5.  **`O₁ B (O₂)`**: Similar to the above.\n    *   True expressions: `T&(T)`, `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`. (4 expressions)\n\n**Total for Case 1: 5 + 5 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 19.**\n\n### Case 2: Two Pairs of Parentheses\n\nThe expression has length 5 and contains two `(` and two `)`. The parentheses must be nested.\n\n1.  **`((O))`**: The expression `((T))` is true. (1 expression)\n\n2.  **Structures with one `!` and one `O`**:\n    *   `(! (O))`: `(! (F))` evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!((O))`: `!((F))` evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `((!O))`: `((!F))` evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `(!(O))`: `(!(F))` evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   Sub-total: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\n**Total for Case 2: 1 + 4 = 5.**\n\n### Case 3: Three or More Pairs of Parentheses\n\nAn expression with three pairs of parentheses would have a length of at least 6. Thus, this is not possible.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of true boolean expressions is the sum of the counts from all cases.\nTotal = (Case 0) + (Case 1) + (Case 2)\nTotal = 31 + 19 + 5 = 55.\n\n<<<55>>>"
