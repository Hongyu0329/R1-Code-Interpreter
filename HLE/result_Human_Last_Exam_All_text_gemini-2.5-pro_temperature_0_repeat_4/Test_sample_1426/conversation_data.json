    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Work:** The piece in question is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\".\n2.  **Identify the Specific Part:** We need to look at the part for the first violin (\"Violino I\" in the score).\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Section:** The question concerns the very end of the symphony, which is the conclusion of the fourth movement (Finale: Allegro con fuoco).\n4.  **Examine the Score:** Consulting the orchestral score, we look at the final measure for the first violin.\n5.  **Identify the \"Three Notes\":** The symphony concludes with a powerful, sustained chord played by the entire orchestra. For the first violins, this final chord is a \"triple stop,\" meaning they play three notes simultaneously. These are the three notes on which the part ends.\n6.  **List the Notes:** The three notes written for the first violin in this final chord are, from the lowest to the highest pitch:\n    *   B♭4 (B-flat on the middle line of the treble clef)\n    *   D5 (D on the fourth line of the treble clef)\n    *   F5 (F in the top space of the treble clef)\n7.  **Determine the Lowest Note:** By comparing these three pitches (B♭4, D5, and F5), we can identify the lowest one. B♭4 is lower in pitch than both D5 and F5.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important to look at the specific part for the *first violin*, not the entire orchestra or another instrument.\n*   The phrase \"ends on three notes\" refers to the final chord played by the first violins, which is composed of three distinct pitches played at the same time. It does not refer to the last three notes played in sequence.\n*   The key signature of the symphony (B-flat major) is a helpful clue, as the final chord is a B-flat major chord, reinforcing the tonic key.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the score, the three final notes for the first violin are B♭4, D5, and F5. The lowest of these is B♭4.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
