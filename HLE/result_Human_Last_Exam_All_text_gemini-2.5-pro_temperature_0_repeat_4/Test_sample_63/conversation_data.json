    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\nThe question provides three key pieces of information:\n1.  The subject is a man.\n2.  Kurt Vonnegut is quoted as saying this man \"looks like a porcupine in all the pictures.\" This points to a specific visual characteristic, likely a spiky or bristly haircut.\n3.  The man's name consists of two words that both begin with the same letter (an alliterative name).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vonnegut Reference**\nA search for the quote reveals that Kurt Vonnegut used this description in his novel *Breakfast of Champions*. However, he used it to describe a fictional character, the Pontiac dealer Dwayne Hoover, whose severe crew cut made him look like a porcupine. Dwayne Hoover's name does not fit the alliterative rule (D and H). This means Dwayne Hoover is not the answer, but the *description* of his appearance is the primary clue. We are looking for a real person who matches that description.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Visual Characteristic**\nThe \"porcupine\" look, in the context of Vonnegut's description of a crew cut, refers to very short, bristly hair that stands on end. We need to find a famous person known for this signature look.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Visual Clue with the Naming Rule**\nNow we must find a famous man with an alliterative two-word name who had a \"porcupine-like\" haircut. Let's consider candidates:\n*   **Don King:** Famous for his hair that stands straight up, which could be described as porcupine-like. However, his name (\"Don King\") does not start with the same letter.\n*   **Bertolt Brecht:** The famous German playwright and poet.\n    *   **Name:** \"Bertolt Brecht\". This is a two-word name, and both words start with the letter 'B'. This fits the naming rule.\n    *   **Appearance:** Bertolt Brecht was well-known for his very severe, short, bristly haircut (a buzz cut or crew cut) that stood on end. This appearance perfectly matches the \"porcupine\" description that Vonnegut used for his character.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBertolt Brecht fits all the criteria. His name is alliterative (\"Bertolt Brecht\"), and his signature bristly haircut matches the \"porcupine\" description referenced in the clue from Kurt Vonnegut.\n\n<<<Bertolt Brecht>>>"
