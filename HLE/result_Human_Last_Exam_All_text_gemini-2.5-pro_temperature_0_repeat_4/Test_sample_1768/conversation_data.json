    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Key Information**\n\n*   **Nucleotide Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n*   **Sequence Length:** The provided sequence has 99 nucleotides.\n*   **Crucial Clue:** The sequence is taken from the *middle* of an Open Reading Frame (ORF). An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that is read by the ribosome to make a protein. It starts with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. Since this fragment is from the middle, the correct reading frame should not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Three Possible Reading Frames**\n\nA DNA sequence can be read in three different ways, or \"frames,\" on the forward strand. We will translate the sequence in each frame and check for stop codons.\n\n*   **Frame 1: Starts at the 1st nucleotide.**\n    *   The sequence is grouped into codons starting from the first base:\n        `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** The fifth codon is `tag`, which is a stop codon.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 is incorrect because a stop codon would terminate translation, and this sequence is from the middle of an ORF.\n\n*   **Frame 2: Starts at the 2nd nucleotide.**\n    *   The first nucleotide (`g`) is ignored. The sequence is grouped into codons starting from the second base (`g`):\n        `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga act`\n        (The last two nucleotides, `gg`, are incomplete and not translated).\n    *   **Analysis:** We scan the 32 complete codons in this frame for any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). There are no stop codons present.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Frame 2 is a valid candidate for the correct reading frame as it forms a continuous, uninterrupted chain of codons.\n\n*   **Frame 3: Starts at the 3rd nucleotide.**\n    *   The first two nucleotides (`gg`) are ignored. The sequence is grouped into codons starting from the third base (`a`):\n        `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa ...`\n    *   **Analysis:** The eighth codon is `tga`, which is a stop codon.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 is incorrect for the same reason as Frame 1.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Correct Frame and Translate**\n\nBased on the analysis, Frame 2 is the only reading frame that does not contain a stop codon. Therefore, it is the correct frame. Now, we translate the codons from Frame 2 into their corresponding amino acids using the one-letter code.\n\n*   **Codons:** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga act`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `act` -> T (Threonine)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe correct reading frame is **Frame 2**. The translated protein sequence is:\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERT>>>"
