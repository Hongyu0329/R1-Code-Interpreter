    "This is a classic question in point-set topology. To answer it, we need to carefully analyze the definitions and apply a series of deep classification theorems.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the terms in the question.**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Since we are talking about planar continua, these are subsets of the plane ($\\mathbb{R}^2$) that are closed, bounded, and connected.\n*   **Planar:** A space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This means there is a homeomorphism from the space to a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a homeomorphism $f: X \\to X$ such that $f(x) = y$. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Classes:** We are not looking for every single example, but for the number of distinct topological types. Two spaces are in the same class if they are homeomorphic to each other.\n\nSo, the question asks for the number of topologically distinct, compact, connected, homogeneous subsets of the plane.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the main classification theorems.**\n\nThe classification of homogeneous planar continua is a major result in topology, built upon the work of several mathematicians over many decades (including Mazurkiewicz, Moore, Bing, and Jones). The classification proceeds by dividing the continua based on their topological properties. A key property is **local connectedness**.\n\n*   **Case 1: The continuum is locally connected.**\n    A theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz (1920) states that any locally connected, homogeneous, planar continuum is homeomorphic to the **circle** ($S^1$).\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** We must also consider the simplest possible continuum: the **point**. A single point is compact, connected, homogeneous (trivially), and planar. It is also locally connected. So, the point is a distinct homeomorphism class.\n    *   Therefore, in the locally connected case, we have two distinct homeomorphism classes:\n        1.  **The Point**\n        2.  **The Circle**\n\n*   **Case 2: The continuum is NOT locally connected.**\n    This case is more complex and requires further subdivision based on whether the continuum is decomposable or indecomposable.\n    *   A continuum is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. Otherwise, it is **indecomposable**.\n\n    *   **Subcase 2a: The continuum is indecomposable and not locally connected.**\n        A theorem by F. Burton Jones (1951) states that a non-degenerate, indecomposable, homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to the **pseudo-arc**.\n        *   **Careful Point 2:** The pseudo-arc is a very specific, snake-like continuum. It is known to be homogeneous, planar, and indecomposable. It is topologically unique, meaning any two pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic. This gives us our third class.\n        3.  **The Pseudo-arc**\n\n    *   **Subcase 2b: The continuum is decomposable and not locally connected.**\n        The analysis of this case is more recent, relying on work by J. T. Rogers, Jr. and others. It has been proven that there is only one such object (up to homeomorphism). This object is known as the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. It can be visualized as a circle where each point has been \"thickened\" into its own pseudo-arc in a continuous way.\n        *   **Careful Point 3:** This object is distinct from the previous three. It is not locally connected (unlike the point and circle), and it is decomposable (unlike the pseudo-arc). This gives us our fourth and final class.\n        4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs**\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the results and list all careful points.**\n\nThe theorems mentioned above provide a complete classification. Every homogeneous planar continuum must fall into one of these four categories.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Exclusion of other candidates.** One might think of other homogeneous continua, like the solenoids (inverse limits of circles). However, a key theorem by R. H. Bing states that solenoids are **not planar**. Therefore, they are excluded from our count.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Completeness of the list.** The combination of the theorems of Mazurkiewicz, Jones, and Rogers provides a complete partition of the possibilities. A homogeneous planar continuum is either locally connected or not. If it is, it's a point or a circle. If it's not, it's either indecomposable (the pseudo-arc) or decomposable (the circle of pseudo-arcs). There are no other options.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, we have identified exactly four distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n1.  **The Point:** (Locally connected, degenerate)\n2.  **The Circle:** (Locally connected, non-degenerate)\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc:** (Not locally connected, indecomposable)\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** (Not locally connected, decomposable)\n\nThus, there are 4 such classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
