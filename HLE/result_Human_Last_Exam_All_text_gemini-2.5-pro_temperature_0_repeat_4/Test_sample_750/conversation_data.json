    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the components of the equation**\nThe equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\nThe left side, $z \\cdot i$, is a simple multiplication in the complex plane. If $z = x+yi$, then $z \\cdot i = (x+yi)i = xi + yi^2 = -y + xi$.\nThe right side, $i^z$, is a complex exponentiation. This is defined as $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. So, $i^z = e^{z \\log i}$.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the complex logarithm $\\log i$**\nThe complex logarithm $\\log w$ is a multi-valued function defined as $\\log w = \\ln|w| + i(\\arg(w) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nFor $w=i$:\n*   The modulus is $|i| = 1$, so $\\ln|i| = \\ln(1) = 0$.\n*   The principal argument is $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nSo, the values of $\\log i$ are:\n$\\log i = 0 + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 3: Rewrite the equation using the logarithm**\nSubstituting the expression for $\\log i$ into the definition of $i^z$, the original equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot i\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)}$\nThis equation must hold for some integer $k$. We need to find solutions for $z$ for each possible value of $k$.\n\n**Step 4: Rearrange the equation to use the Lambert W function**\nThe Lambert W function, denoted $W(a)$, is defined as the function that satisfies the equation $W(a)e^{W(a)} = a$. We can solve our equation by rearranging it into this form.\nLet $X_k = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$. The equation is:\n$zi = e^{ziX_k}$\nTo isolate $z$, we can divide by $i$ (or multiply by $-i$):\n$z = \\frac{1}{i} e^{ziX_k} = -i e^{ziX_k}$\nNow, move the exponential term to the left side:\n$z e^{-ziX_k} = -i$\nThis is close to the Lambert W form. Let's define a new variable $w = -ziX_k$.\nFrom this definition, we can express $z$ in terms of $w$:\n$z = \\frac{w}{-iX_k} = \\frac{iw}{X_k}$\nSubstitute this expression for $z$ back into the rearranged equation:\n$(\\frac{iw}{X_k}) e^w = -i$\nNow, solve for $we^w$:\n$we^w = -i \\cdot \\frac{X_k}{i} = -X_k$\nSo we have the equation in the standard Lambert W form:\n$we^w = -X_k = -\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$\n\n**Step 5: Solve for w and then for z**\nThe solution for $w$ is given by the Lambert W function. Since the Lambert W function is also multi-valued for complex arguments, its branches are indexed by an integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n$w = W_n(-X_k) = W_n(-\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k))$\nNow, we substitute this back into our expression for $z$ in terms of $w$:\n$z = \\frac{iw}{X_k} = i \\frac{W_n(-\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k))}{\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)}$\nThis is the general form for all solutions $z$, where $k$ and $n$ are any integers.\n\n**Step 6: Identify specific solutions from the general formula**\nThe general formula contains all solutions, but some specific, simpler solutions are worth noting.\n\n*   **Real Solutions:** Let's test for $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n    *   If $z=1$: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1 = i$. So $z=1$ is a solution.\n    *   If $z=-1$: $-1 \\cdot i = -i$. For the right side, we must choose a branch for $i^{-1}$. Using the definition $i^{-1} = e^{-1 \\log i} = e^{-i(\\pi/2 + 2k\\pi)} = \\cos(-\\pi/2 - 2k\\pi) + i\\sin(-\\pi/2 - 2k\\pi) = 0 - i = -i$. So $z=-1$ is a solution.\n    These solutions are contained within the general formula. For any $k$, there exists a branch $n$ of the Lambert W function such that $W_n(-X_k) = -iX_k$ (which gives $z=1$) and another branch $n'$ such that $W_{n'}(-X_k) = iX_k$ (which gives $z=-1$).\n\n*   **Purely Imaginary Solutions:** A solution $z=iy$ is purely imaginary. This occurs when the value of $W_n(-X_k)$ is real. The argument of the Lambert W function, $-X_k = -\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$, is real.\n    *   If $k \\ge 0$, then $-X_k \\le -\\pi/2$. For real arguments less than $-1/e$, the Lambert W function has no real values. Thus, there are no purely imaginary solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n    *   If $k < 0$ (i.e., $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$), then $-X_k$ is positive. For positive arguments, only the principal branch $W_0$ is real.\n    Therefore, for each negative integer $k$, there is one purely imaginary solution:\n    $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k))}{\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)}$ for $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$.\n\n*   **Other Complex Solutions:** For all other combinations of integers $(k, n)$, the solution $z$ is a complex number with non-zero real and imaginary parts.\n\nThe complete set of solutions for $z$ is given by the general formula derived in Step 5.\n\n<<<The set of all solutions for $z$ is given by the formula:\n$z = i \\frac{W_n(-\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k))}{\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)}$\nfor all integers $k, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function.\nThis set includes the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, as well as an infinite number of purely imaginary solutions and other complex solutions.>>>"
