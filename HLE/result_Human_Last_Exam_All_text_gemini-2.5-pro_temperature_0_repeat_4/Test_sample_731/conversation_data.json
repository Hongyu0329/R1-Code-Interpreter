    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the structure of the semidihedral group and its power subgroups.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Semidihedral Group**\n\nThe semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. In general, the semidihedral group of order $2^n$, for $n \\ge 4$, is denoted $SD_{2^n}$.\nThe order of our group is $512 = 2^9$, so we are dealing with $SD_{2^9}$, which means $n=9$.\n\nThe presentation of $SD_{2^n}$ is given by:\n$G = SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$\n\nFor our specific group $G = SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$:\n*   $n=9$\n*   The order of the group is $2^9 = 512$.\n*   The generator $r$ has order $2^{n-1} = 2^8 = 256$.\n*   The generator $s$ has order $2$.\n*   The relation between them is $srs = r^{2^{9-2}-1} = r^{2^7-1} = r^{127}$.\n\nThe elements of $G$ are of two forms:\n1.  Powers of $r$: $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$. These form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order 256.\n2.  Elements of the form $sr^i$: $sr^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a **power subgroup** if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is equal to the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. This set is denoted by $G^k$.\n$G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of $G^k$**\n\nWe need to compute the $k$-th power of every element in $G$. We can split this analysis into two cases based on whether $k$ is odd or even.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is an odd integer**\n\n*   **Powers of elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$**: Let $g = r^i$. Then $g^k = (r^i)^k = r^{ik}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 256) = 1$. This means that as $i$ runs from 0 to 255, $ik \\pmod{256}$ also takes on all values from 0 to 255. Therefore, the set of $k$-th powers of elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$ is $\\langle r \\rangle$ itself.\n*   **Powers of elements not in $\\langle r \\rangle$**: Let $g = sr^i$. Then $g^k = (sr^i)^k$. Since $k$ is odd, $g^k$ will be of the form $r^j s r^l$, which is not in $\\langle r \\rangle$. For example, $s^k = s$ since $k$ is odd.\n*   **The resulting set $G^k$**: The set $G^k$ contains $\\langle r \\rangle$ (from the powers of $r^i$) and the element $s$ (from $s^k$). For $G^k$ to be a subgroup, it must contain the subgroup generated by $\\langle r \\rangle$ and $s$, which is the entire group $G = \\langle r, s \\rangle$.\n*   It can be shown that for any element $g' \\in G$, there exists an element $g \\in G$ such that $g^k = g'$. This means $G^k = G$.\n*   Therefore, for any odd integer $k$, we get the same power subgroup: $G$ itself. This gives us **1** power subgroup.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the structure of $G^k$**\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is an even integer**\n\nLet $k = 2m$ for some integer $m$.\n\n*   **Powers of elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$**: Let $g = r^i$. Then $g^k = (r^i)^{2m} = r^{2im}$. All these elements belong to $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n*   **Powers of elements not in $\\langle r \\rangle$**: Let $g = sr^i$. We first compute the square of this element:\n    $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i sr^i = s(r^i s)r^i$. Using the relation $srs=r^{127}$, we can derive $sr^i s = r^{127i}$.\n    So, $(sr^i)^2 = (sr^i s)r^i = r^{127i}r^i = r^{128i} = r^{i \\cdot 2^7}$.\n    Note that $128 = 2^{n-2}$ for $n=9$.\n    Now, $g^k = (sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^{2m} = ((sr^i)^2)^m = (r^{i \\cdot 2^7})^m = r^{im \\cdot 2^7}$. These elements also belong to $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n*   **The resulting set $G^k$**: When $k$ is even, the $k$-th power of any element in $G$ is an element of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$. Thus, $G^k$ is a subgroup of $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n*   A more detailed analysis shows that $G^k = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 2^{n-1})} \\rangle$. For our group, $G^k = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n*   We need to find what distinct subgroups can be generated this way. Let $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$. Since $k$ is an even integer, $k$ is a multiple of 2. Therefore, $d$ must also be a multiple of 2.\n*   Also, $d$ must be a divisor of 256. The divisors of $256 = 2^8$ are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\dots, 2^8$.\n*   Since $d$ must be even, the possible values for $d$ are $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8$.\n    *   $d=2$: Choose $k=2$. $\\gcd(2, 256)=2$. This gives the subgroup $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   $d=4$: Choose $k=4$. $\\gcd(4, 256)=4$. This gives the subgroup $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   ...\n    *   $d=256=2^8$: Choose $k=256$. $\\gcd(256, 256)=256$. This gives the subgroup $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup).\n*   These are 8 distinct subgroups of $\\langle r \\rangle$. They are all cyclic and are distinct from the whole group $G$, which is non-abelian.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\n\nWe list all the distinct power subgroups found:\n1.  From the case where $k$ is odd: The group $G = SD_{512}$ itself. (1 subgroup)\n2.  From the case where $k$ is even: The subgroups $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. (8 subgroups)\n\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases:\nTotal = 1 (from odd k) + 8 (from even k) = 9.\n\nIn general, for the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$, the number of power subgroups is $n$. For $SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$, we have $n=9$."
