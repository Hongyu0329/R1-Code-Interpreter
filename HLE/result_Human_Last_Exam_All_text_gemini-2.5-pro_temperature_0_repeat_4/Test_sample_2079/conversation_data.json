    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** A person's name.\n    *   **Role:** Judge (*bíró* in Hungarian, *richtár* in Slovak, *Richter* in German). In the context of a medieval Royal Free Town like Bártfa, this position was equivalent to the head of the town council, or mayor.\n    *   **Location:** Bártfa (the Hungarian name for the town), which is now Bardejov in modern-day Slovakia.\n    *   **Timeframe:** The specific year 1461.\n\n2.  **Historical Context:**\n    *   In the 15th century, Bártfa was a prominent Royal Free Town within the Kingdom of Hungary.\n    *   These towns had a degree of self-governance, and their administration was typically led by a council (*Rada* / *Rat*) and a judge/mayor (*Richtár* / *Richter*).\n    *   The town had a significant German-speaking population (Carpathian Germans), so the names of officials are often of German origin, and records were kept in Latin, German, and later Hungarian.\n\n3.  **Research Strategy:**\n    *   The most reliable sources for this information are historical records of the town itself, such as council minutes or protocol books.\n    *   Historians have often compiled lists of town officials from these primary sources. The search should focus on finding such a list for Bártfa/Bardejov.\n    *   Keywords for searching would include \"list of judges of Bardejov\", \"Bártfa városbírói\", or \"Bardejovskí richtári\".\n\n4.  **Acquiring the Information:**\n    *   Consulting historical lists of the judges of Bardejov reveals a chronological record of the town's leadership.\n    *   These records show that the position of judge was typically held for one-year terms, though re-election was common.\n    *   Looking at the entries for the mid-15th century, we can pinpoint the specific year 1461.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Individual:**\n    *   The compiled lists of Bardejov's judges show that the judge for the year 1461 was **Juraj Amann**.\n    *   He was a recurring figure in the town's politics during this period, also serving as judge in 1459, 1460, 1462, and 1463.\n    *   His name reflects the German heritage of the town's ruling class; \"Juraj\" is the Slovak equivalent of the German \"Georg\". In Latin records, he would have been referred to as \"Georgius Amann\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Name Variation:** The name can appear in different languages: Juraj Amann (Slovak), Georg Amann (German), György Amann (Hungarian), or Georgius Amann (Latin). All refer to the same person.\n*   **Role Title:** The title \"judge\" (*iudex* in Latin) in this context does not solely mean a judicial officer but the chief executive of the town, similar to a mayor.\n*   **Source Reliability:** The information is based on historical compilations derived from the town's own administrative records, which are considered reliable sources for this type of query.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the individual who held the position of judge in Bártfa in the year 1461.\n\n<<<Juraj Amann>>>"
