    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core question.**\nThe user wants to know the current common name for the bee genus *Perdita* and the year this name was officially established or \"coined\". The answer must be for the year 2024 and apply to the bee's native range (North America).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the common name.**\n*   The genus *Perdita* is a very large group of small bees native to North and Central America.\n*   While several informal names might exist, we need the most widely accepted and official common name.\n*   Authoritative sources like the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation and BugGuide.net refer to the genus *Perdita* as \"fairy bees\". This name reflects their tiny size and often iridescent coloration.\n*   To confirm the official status, we must consult the primary authority for insect common names in North America: the Entomological Society of America (ESA).\n\n**Step 3: Determine when the name was coined.**\n*   The term \"coined\" in a scientific context usually refers to the date of formal publication or adoption by a recognized body.\n*   While \"fairy bees\" may have been used colloquially for some time, a major effort was recently undertaken to standardize the common names for all bee genera found in the United States and Canada.\n*   This effort was led by a committee of bee experts and the results were formally published. This publication serves as the definitive record for the official coining of these names.\n*   The key publication is: Portman, Z. M., H. T. Ngo, T. M. Harrison, J. S. Ascher, and T. L. Griswold. \"Common names of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila) of the United States and Canada.\" *Journal of the Entomological Society of Kansas*, 95(2), pp.1-33.\n*   This paper was published in **2023**.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the final answer.**\n*   The publication from 2023 formally establishes \"fairy bees\" as the common name for the genus *Perdita*.\n*   As of 2024, this is the most current and officially recognized common name.\n*   Therefore, the common name is \"fairy bees\" and the year it was officially coined in this comprehensive list is 2023.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to differentiate between informal, colloquial names and officially adopted common names. The ESA list is the standard for the latter.\n*   The year of \"coining\" is best interpreted as the year of formal publication in a peer-reviewed, official list, which provides a concrete and verifiable date. The 2023 paper is the most recent and comprehensive source for this.\n*   The native range of *Perdita* is North America, which aligns perfectly with the scope of the ESA common names list for the US and Canada.\n\n<<<fairy bees, 2023>>>"
