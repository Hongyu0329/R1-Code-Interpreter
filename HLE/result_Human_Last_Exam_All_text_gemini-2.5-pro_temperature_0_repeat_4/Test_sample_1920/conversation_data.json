    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks for the number of **primitive** Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ that have a specific **conductor** $d=53599$ and a specific **order** of 6.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Conductor and Character Structure\nA key property of Dirichlet characters is that they can be factored into components based on the prime factorization of the modulus.\n\n1.  **Factorize the conductor `d`**:\n    We need to find the prime factors of $d = 53599$.\n    *   $53599$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n    *   Trying small prime divisors:\n        $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$\n        $7657 = 13 \\times 589$\n        $589 = 19 \\times 31$\n    *   So, the prime factorization is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Let's denote the primes as $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n2.  **Decomposition of the Character**:\n    Since the conductor $d$ is a product of distinct primes, any Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo each prime factor:\n    $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the \"Primitive\" Condition\nFor a character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$ corresponding to a modulus $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ (where $p_i$ are distinct primes), the conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its components: $c(\\chi) = c(\\chi_1)c(\\chi_2)\\cdots c(\\chi_k)$.\n\n1.  We are given that $\\chi$ is a **primitive** character with conductor $d$. This means its conductor is exactly $d$.\n    $c(\\chi) = d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$.\n\n2.  This implies that for each component character $\\chi_i$, its conductor must be $c(\\chi_i) = p_i$.\n\n3.  **Careful Point**: The conductor of a character $\\chi_i$ modulo a prime $p_i$ is $p_i$ if and only if $\\chi_i$ is a **non-trivial** character. If $\\chi_i$ were the trivial character, its conductor would be 1.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The condition that $\\chi$ is primitive with conductor $d$ is equivalent to requiring that all component characters $\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4$ are non-trivial.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the \"Order 6\" Condition\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters.\n\n1.  Let $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ be the order of the character $\\chi_i$. We are given that $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = 6$.\n    Therefore, $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\n2.  This lcm condition implies several things about the individual orders $k_i$:\n    *   Each $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6. So, $k_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    *   At least one $k_i$ must be a multiple of 2.\n    *   At least one $k_i$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\n3.  **Careful Point**: We must also respect the properties of the component characters. The order $k_i$ of a character $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ must divide the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$.\n    *   For $p_1=7$, $p_1-1=6$. $k_1$ must divide 6.\n    *   For $p_2=13$, $p_2-1=12$. $k_2$ must divide 12.\n    *   For $p_3=19$, $p_3-1=18$. $k_3$ must divide 18.\n    *   For $p_4=31$, $p_4-1=30$. $k_4$ must divide 30.\n    The condition that each $k_i$ must divide 6 is compatible with these constraints.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Number of Valid Component Characters\nCombining the conditions from the previous steps, for each component $\\chi_i$:\n*   It must be non-trivial, so $k_i \\neq 1$.\n*   Its order $k_i$ must divide 6.\n*   Therefore, the possible orders for each $k_i$ are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nNow, we count how many characters exist for each of these possible orders. The number of characters of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ (where $k | p-1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nFor each of the four primes $p_i$, the number of available non-trivial characters whose order divides 6 is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 6: Combine the Choices Using Inclusion-Exclusion\nWe need to find the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ is chosen from the 5 available options, such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n\n1.  **Total combinations**: If we choose any of the 5 available characters for each of the 4 components, the total number of combinations is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$. This set includes all combinations where the lcm of orders divides 6.\n\n2.  **Exclude unwanted combinations**: We must subtract the combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., the lcm is 1, 2, or 3).\n    *   **Case A: lcm divides 3.** This occurs if and only if all component orders $k_i$ divide 3. Since $k_i \\neq 1$, this means $k_i=3$ for all $i$. For each component, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. The total number of such combinations is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n    *   **Case B: lcm divides 2.** This occurs if and only if all component orders $k_i$ divide 2. Since $k_i \\neq 1$, this means $k_i=2$ for all $i$. For each component, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. The total number of such combinations is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n    *   **Careful Point (Overlap)**: The intersection of Case A and Case B would be combinations where the lcm divides both 2 and 3, meaning the lcm divides 1. This would require all orders to be 1, but we have already excluded trivial characters. Thus, the two sets of excluded combinations are disjoint.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation**: The number of characters with order exactly 6 is the total number of combinations minus the excluded ones.\n    Number = (Total combinations) - (Combinations where lcm divides 3) - (Combinations where lcm divides 2)\n    Number = $625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6 is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
