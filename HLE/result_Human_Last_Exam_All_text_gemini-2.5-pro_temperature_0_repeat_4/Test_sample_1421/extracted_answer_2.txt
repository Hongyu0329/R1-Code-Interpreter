The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is $Z = \int \mathcal{D}\psi^* \mathcal{D}\psi \, e^{-S_E[\psi^*, \psi]}$, where the integral is a functional integral over Grassmann fields $\psi(\tau)$ and $\psi^*(\tau)$ that obey anti-periodic boundary conditions $\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)$. The action is the Euclidean action, given by $S_E = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left( \psi^*(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi(\tau) + H(\psi^*, \psi) \right)$.
