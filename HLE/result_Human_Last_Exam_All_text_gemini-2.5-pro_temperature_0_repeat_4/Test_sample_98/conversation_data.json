    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron and its Orientation**\n*   An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   The problem states the icosahedron tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of its triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base of the tank.\n*   Due to the high symmetry of the icosahedron, if one face is the base, there is an identical, parallel face that forms the top.\n*   The axis passing through the center of the base face and the center of the top face is a vertical axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Position of the Water Surface**\n*   The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" For a symmetrical container like an icosahedron, the center of volume coincides with its geometric center.\n*   To contain exactly half the total volume, the water level must form a horizontal plane that passes through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n*   Therefore, the water surface is the cross-section of the icosahedron created by a plane that is parallel to the base and passes through the center.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Shape of the Cross-Section**\n*   We need to determine the shape of the polygon formed by the intersection of the icosahedron and this specific cutting plane.\n*   As established in Step 1, the cutting plane is perpendicular to the 3-fold symmetry axis that runs from the center of the base to the center of the top face.\n*   The cross-section of a regular icosahedron taken at its center and perpendicular to a 3-fold axis is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Step 4: Visualize the Result (Careful Points)**\n*   One can visualize the vertices of the icosahedron arranged in four horizontal layers when it stands on a face.\n    *   Layer 1: 3 vertices forming the bottom face.\n    *   Layer 2: 3 vertices forming a larger, rotated triangle just below the center.\n    *   Layer 3: 3 vertices forming another large, rotated triangle just above the center.\n    *   Layer 4: 3 vertices forming the top face.\n*   The cutting plane (the water surface) passes exactly between Layer 2 and Layer 3.\n*   The plane intersects the six edges that connect the vertices of Layer 2 to the vertices of Layer 3.\n*   The points where the plane cuts these six edges form the vertices of the resulting polygon.\n*   Due to the 3-fold rotational symmetry and the point symmetry through the center, these six vertices form a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWhen an icosahedron tank standing on one of its faces is half-filled, the water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center. The intersection of this plane with the icosahedron forms a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
