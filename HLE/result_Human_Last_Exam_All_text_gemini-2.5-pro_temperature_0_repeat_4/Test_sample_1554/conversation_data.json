    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** The philosopher must belong to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School.\"\n    *   **Key Contribution:** This philosopher is known for a specific conceptual analysis: decomposing the notion of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland, active primarily between the two World Wars.\n    *   It was founded by Kazimierz Twardowski in Lviv.\n    *   Key members include Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   The school was renowned for its emphasis on clarity, logical rigor, and the analysis of language.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Philosophical Concepts:**\n    *   **Hallmark (or Sign):** The general term in Polish is *znak*. This refers to something that stands for or indicates something else.\n    *   **Symptom:** This refers to a *natural sign*. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is based on a natural, often causal, connection. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire. The Polish term used for this is *oznaka*.\n    *   **Signal:** This refers to a *conventional sign*. The relationship is established by rules, agreement, or convention, not by a natural link. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"tree\" is a signal for the concept of a tree.\n\n4.  **Connect the Concepts to the School's Philosophers:**\n    *   The analysis of signs, meaning, and language was a central theme for many philosophers in the Lviv-Warsaw School. The task is to find the specific philosopher who articulated this particular distinction.\n    *   A review of the major works of the school's members reveals that **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** was deeply engaged in the philosophy of language, epistemology, and semiotics (the theory of signs).\n    *   In his work, particularly in his epistemological and semantic writings, Ajdukiewicz explicitly analyzes the concept of a sign (*znak*). He distinguishes between natural signs, which he calls *oznaki* (symptoms or indications), and conventional signs, which are *znaki* in a narrower sense (signals or symbols), whose meaning is determined by linguistic rules or conventions.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who is credited with this specific decomposition of the concept of a sign (hallmark) into natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals). This distinction was fundamental to his theory of meaning and his broader philosophical project.\n\n***\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
