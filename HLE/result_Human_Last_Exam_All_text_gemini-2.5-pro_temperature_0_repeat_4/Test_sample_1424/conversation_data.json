    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Definition of the Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe starting point is the definition of the two-point (or single-particle) Green's function in the Feynman path integral formalism. For a non-interacting system (hence \"bare,\" denoted by the subscript 0), the Green's function $G_0(x, x')$ is the time-ordered correlation function of the field operators, calculated as a functional average weighted by the action $S_0$.\n\n*   **Fields:** $\\psi(x)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(x')$ are Grassmann-valued fields, where $x=(t, \\mathbf{r})$ represents spacetime coordinates.\n*   **Action:** The bare action $S_0$ for a system described by a single-particle Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$ is:\n    $S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int dt \\int d^d\\mathbf{r} \\, \\bar{\\psi}(t, \\mathbf{r}) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0 \\right) \\psi(t, \\mathbf{r})$\n*   **Green's Function:** The Green's function is defined as:\n    $G_0(x, x') = -i \\langle T[\\psi(x) \\bar{\\psi}(x')] \\rangle_0 = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x) \\bar{\\psi}(x') \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]/\\hbar}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]/\\hbar}}$\n    (Note: We will set $\\hbar=1$ from now on for simplicity, and restore it in the final result).\n\nThe operator in the action, $\\mathcal{K} = i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0$, is the key object. The Green's function is fundamentally the inverse of this operator, i.e., $\\mathcal{K} G_0(x, x') = \\delta(x-x')$.\n\n**2. Diagonalization of the Action**\n\nThe path integral is difficult to evaluate in the $(t, \\mathbf{r})$ basis because the operator $\\mathcal{K}$ mixes different points in space (via $\\hat{H}_0$, which typically contains derivatives like $\\nabla^2$) and time (via $\\partial/\\partial t$). The standard technique is to transform to a basis where $\\mathcal{K}$ is diagonal (i.e., it becomes a simple number).\n\n*   **Step 2a: Spatial Transformation to the Eigenbasis of $\\hat{H}_0$**\n    Let $|\\phi_k\\rangle$ be the orthonormal eigenstates of the single-particle Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$ with corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n    $\\hat{H}_0 |\\phi_k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |\\phi_k\\rangle$\n    The label $k$ represents the set of quantum numbers for the single-particle states (e.g., momentum for a free particle). We expand the fields $\\psi(t, \\mathbf{r})$ in this basis:\n    $\\psi(t, \\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_k \\psi_k(t) \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r})$\n    $\\bar{\\psi}(t, \\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(t) \\phi_k^*(\\mathbf{r})$\n    Substituting this into the action and using the orthonormality of the $\\phi_k(\\mathbf{r})$, the action simplifies:\n    $S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\, \\bar{\\psi}_k(t) \\left( i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k \\right) \\psi_k(t)$\n    The action is now diagonal in the quantum number $k$, but the time derivative still couples different times.\n\n*   **Step 2b: Temporal Fourier Transformation**\n    To diagonalize the time-derivative part, we perform a Fourier transform from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$):\n    $\\psi_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{-i\\omega t} \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n    The time derivative $i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ becomes multiplication by $\\omega$. Substituting this into the action gives:\n    $S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\, \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n    The action is now fully diagonal in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis. The operator $\\mathcal{K}$ has been transformed into a simple algebraic function, $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Green's Function in the Diagonal Basis**\n\nIn the $(k, \\omega)$ basis, the Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is the inverse of the operator $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. This can be seen from the path integral for the correlation function $\\langle \\psi_k(\\omega) \\bar{\\psi}_{k'}(\\omega') \\rangle_0$. Due to the diagonal nature of the action, this correlation is only non-zero for $k=k'$ and $\\omega=\\omega'$. The result of the Gaussian Grassmann integral is:\n$\\langle \\psi_k(\\omega) \\bar{\\psi}_{k'}(\\omega') \\rangle_0 = -i \\cdot 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega-\\omega') \\delta_{k,k'} \\cdot \\frac{i}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k} = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega-\\omega') \\delta_{k,k'} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\nThe term multiplying the delta functions is the Green's function in the $(k, \\omega)$ representation:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**4. The Causal Propagator and the $i\\eta$ Prescription**\n\nThe expression above has a pole on the real axis at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$, making integrals over $\\omega$ ill-defined. The time-ordering $T$ in the original definition of the Green's function provides the correct prescription for handling this pole, ensuring causality (particles propagate forward in time, holes propagate backward). This is implemented by adding a small imaginary infinitesimal, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), to the denominator. The sign of this term depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied or unoccupied relative to the Fermi sea.\n\n*   For an unoccupied state (particle, $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$ where $\\mu$ is the chemical potential), the pole is shifted to $\\epsilon_k - i\\eta$.\n*   For an occupied state (hole, $\\epsilon_k < \\mu$), the pole is shifted to $\\epsilon_k + i\\eta$.\n\nThis can be written compactly as:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nRestoring $\\hbar$, the final expression is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Choice of Basis:** The entire analysis hinges on transforming to the basis $(k, \\omega)$ where the non-interacting action $S_0$ is diagonal. This transforms a complex functional integral problem into a simple algebraic inversion for each mode.\n2.  **The Role of $i\\eta$:** The infinitesimal $i\\eta$ is not an ad-hoc addition but a direct consequence of the time-ordering in the definition of the Green's function within the path integral. It correctly places the poles in the complex frequency plane to ensure that the time-domain Green's function respects causality.\n3.  **Physical Interpretation:** The functional form $G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$ has a profound physical meaning. The poles of the Green's function correspond to the energies of the elementary excitations of the system. For the bare Green's function, these are simply the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$. When interactions are included, these poles shift, giving the quasi-particle energies.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that by diagonalizing the bare action $S_0$, the operator $i\\hbar\\partial_t - \\hat{H}_0$ becomes the algebraic expression $\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k$ in the frequency-eigenstate basis. The bare Green's function $G_0$ is the inverse of this operator. Therefore, the functional dependence of $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is that $\\epsilon_k$ determines the location of the simple pole of the Green's function in the frequency domain.\n\nThe explicit functional form is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta_k}$\nwhere $k$ labels the single-particle eigenstate and $\\eta_k$ is an infinitesimal term whose sign depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied or not, ensuring causality. The core dependence is the term $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function in the frequency-eigenstate representation, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, has a simple pole structure. The functional dependence is such that the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ sets the location of this pole on the real frequency axis. The explicit form is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta_k}$, where $\\eta_k$ is an infinitesimal that enforces causality.>>>"
