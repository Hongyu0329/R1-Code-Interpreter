    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) to determine the coldest efficient production temperature.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Reaction**\nThe synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride involves the direct reaction of Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F2) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\nXe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Reaction Conditions**\nThis reaction is not spontaneous at room temperature and requires an input of energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. The primary method for synthesizing XeF₄ is thermal activation, which means heating the reactants. Other methods like photochemical activation (using UV light) or electric discharge exist, but the most common, reliable, and \"efficient\" method in a standard laboratory or industrial context is the thermal method.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Role of Temperature in the Synthesis**\nTemperature is a critical factor that must be carefully controlled for an efficient synthesis of XeF₄.\n*   **If the temperature is too low:** The rate of reaction will be extremely slow. Even though the reaction is exothermic, the activation energy is high, so insufficient thermal energy means the reactants will not combine at a practical or \"efficient\" rate.\n*   **If the temperature is too high:** Two problems arise. First, at very high temperatures, the product XeF₄ can decompose back into its constituent elements or into other xenon fluorides like XeF₂. Second, and more importantly, higher temperatures (especially above 500 °C) combined with excess fluorine favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) instead of XeF₄.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Optimal Temperature for Efficient Production**\nBased on extensive chemical research and established synthesis procedures, the optimal conditions for producing XeF₄ efficiently are:\n*   **Reactant Ratio:** A molar ratio of Xe to F₂ of about 1:5 is used. The excess fluorine helps to ensure the formation of XeF₄ over the lower fluoride, XeF₂.\n*   **Pressure:** The reaction is typically carried out at elevated pressures, around 6 atmospheres, which favors the formation of the product according to Le Chatelier's principle (since 3 moles of gas produce a solid product).\n*   **Temperature:** The mixture is heated to **400 °C**. This temperature is high enough to provide a rapid reaction rate but low enough to prevent significant formation of XeF₆ or decomposition of the desired XeF₄ product.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Answer Choices**\nLet's compare the standard efficient temperature with the options provided:\n*   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is too high and would lead to the formation of a significant amount of XeF₆, making the synthesis of pure XeF₄ inefficient.\n*   **B. 400 °C:** This matches the well-established, optimal temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄.\n*   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate would be too slow to be considered efficient for practical purposes.\n*   **D. 78 °C, E. 0 °C, F. -78 °C:** These temperatures are far too low for the thermal reaction to proceed at any meaningful rate.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe coldest temperature from the given options at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently using the standard, most common method is 400 °C.\n\n<<<B>>>"
