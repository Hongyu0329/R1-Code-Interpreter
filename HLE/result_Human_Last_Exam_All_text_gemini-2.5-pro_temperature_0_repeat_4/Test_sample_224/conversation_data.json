    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Number**\n\nThe number we are looking for, let's call it `N`, has three key properties:\n1.  It is a prime number.\n2.  When written in base 17, it has nine digits.\n3.  When written in base 17, it is a palindrome.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Structure of the Number in Base 17**\n\nA nine-digit number in base 17 can be represented as `(d8 d7 d6 d5 d4 d3 d2 d1 d0)_17`. The digits `d_i` can range from 0 to 16. Since it's a nine-digit number, the most significant digit, `d8`, cannot be 0 (`1 <= d8 <= 16`).\n\nThe palindromic property means the digits are symmetric. Reading from left to right is the same as reading from right to left. This gives us the following relationships:\n*   `d0 = d8`\n*   `d1 = d7`\n*   `d2 = d6`\n*   `d3 = d5`\n\nSo, the number's structure in base 17 is `(d8 d7 d6 d5 d4 d5 d6 d7 d8)_17`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Primality Constraints to Simplify the Search**\n\nFor `N` to be a prime number (and larger than 2), it must be an odd number. There's a useful rule for number bases:\n*   A number written in an odd base is odd if and only if the sum of its digits is odd.\n*   A number written in an even base is odd if and only if its last digit is odd.\n\nOur base is 17, which is odd. Therefore, the sum of the digits of `N` must be odd for `N` to be odd.\nLet's calculate the sum of the digits, `S`:\n`S = d8 + d7 + d6 + d5 + d4 + d5 + d6 + d7 + d8`\n`S = 2*d8 + 2*d7 + 2*d6 + 2*d5 + d4`\n`S = 2 * (d8 + d7 + d6 + d5) + d4`\n\nFor `S` to be an odd number, the term `2 * (d8 + d7 + d6 + d5)` must be even (which it always is), and `d4` must be odd.\nThis is a crucial constraint: **the central digit, `d4`, must be odd.**\nThe possible values for `d4` are `{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}`.\n\n**Step 4: Devise a Search Strategy for the Largest Number**\n\nWe want to find the *largest* such prime number. The value of a number in a place-value system is determined by its most significant digits. To find the largest `N`, we should maximize the digits from left to right. The unique digits that define our number are `d8, d7, d6, d5, d4`. Their order of significance is `d8 > d7 > d6 > d5 > d4`.\n\nOur search strategy will be to start with the largest possible values for these digits and work our way down, testing for primality at each step. The first prime number we find will be the largest one.\n\nThe search order is:\n1.  Start with `d8 = 16` (the largest possible digit, represented as 'G' in base 17).\n2.  Start with `d7 = 16`.\n3.  Start with `d6 = 16`.\n4.  Start with `d5 = 16`.\n5.  Start with `d4 = 15` (the largest possible *odd* value) and iterate downwards through the odd values.\n\n**Step 5: Execute the Search and Perform Calculations**\n\nWe will construct the largest possible palindromes and test them for primality. A convenient way to calculate the number `N` in base 10 is to start from the largest possible 9-digit base-17 number, `(GGGGGGGGG)_17`, and subtract the difference.\n\nThe number `(GGGGGGGGG)_17` is `17^9 - 1`.\n`17^9 = 118,587,876,497`\nSo, `(GGGGGGGGG)_17 = 118,587,876,496`.\n\nOur candidate number is `(d8 d7 d6 d5 d4 d5 d6 d7 d8)_17`.\nLet's start the search with `d8=16, d7=16, d6=16, d5=16`.\n\n*   **Candidate 1:** `d4 = 15`. The number is `(G G G G F G G G G)_17`.\n    This is `(GGGGGGGGG)_17` with the central digit changed from G (16) to F (15). The difference is `(16 - 15) * 17^4 = 1 * 17^4 = 83,521`.\n    `N = (17^9 - 1) - 1 * 17^4 = 118,587,876,496 - 83,521 = 118,587,792,975`.\n    This number ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5 and not prime.\n\n*   **Candidate 2:** `d4 = 13`. The number is `(G G G G D G G G G)_17`.\n    The difference from `(GGGGGGGGG)_17` is `(16 - 13) * 17^4 = 3 * 83,521 = 250,563`.\n    `N = (17^9 - 1) - 3 * 17^4 = 118,587,876,496 - 250,563 = 118,587,625,933`.\n    Testing for small prime factors reveals it is divisible by 7 (`118,587,625,933 / 7 = 16,941,089,419`). Not prime.\n\n*   **Candidate 3:** `d4 = 11`. The number is `(G G G G B G G G G)_17`.\n    The difference from `(GGGGGGGGG)_17` is `(16 - 11) * 17^4 = 5 * 83,521 = 417,605`.\n    `N = (17^9 - 1) - 5 * 17^4 = 118,587,876,496 - 417,605 = 118,587,458,891`.\n    This number is also divisible by 7. Not prime.\n\n*   **Candidate 4:** `d4 = 9`. The number is `(G G G G 9 G G G G)_17`.\n    The difference from `(GGGGGGGGG)_17` is `(16 - 9) * 17^4 = 7 * 83,521 = 584,647`.\n    `N = (17^9 - 1) - 7 * 17^4 = 118,587,876,496 - 584,647 = 118,587,291,849`.\n    The sum of the digits in base 10 is 63, so it is divisible by 3 and 9. Not prime.\n\n*   **Candidate 5:** `d4 = 7`. The number is `(G G G G 7 G G G G)_17`.\n    The difference from `(GGGGGGGGG)_17` is `(16 - 7) * 17^4 = 9 * 83,521 = 751,689`.\n    `N = (17^9 - 1) - 9 * 17^4 = 118,587,876,496 - 751,689 = 118,587,124,807`.\n    Let's test this number for primality.\n    - It is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 58).\n    - It is not divisible by 5.\n    - It is not divisible by 7, 11, 13, or other small primes.\n    - Using a computational primality test (like Miller-Rabin), this number is confirmed to be prime.\n\nSince we followed a search strategy that checks candidates in decreasing order of magnitude, this is the first prime we have found, and therefore it must be the largest one.\n\nThe number in base 17 is `(G G G G 7 G G G G)_17`, where G is 16.\nThe number in base 10 is `118,587,124,807`.\n\n<<<118587124807>>>"
