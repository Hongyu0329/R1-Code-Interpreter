    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific character in a specific movie who expresses a particular sentiment.\n*   **Movie:** Andrei Tarkovsky's *Solaris* (1972 version).\n*   **Character:** One of the listed options (Kris, Hari, Snaut, Sartorius, Gibarian).\n*   **Sentiment:** Being *ashamed* to miss a specific sound.\n*   **Sound:** The rustling of leaves on Earth.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points and Considerations**\n*   **Source Specificity:** The question is about the 1972 Tarkovsky film, not the original novel by Stanis≈Çaw Lem or the 2002 American remake. Character portrayals and specific lines of dialogue can differ significantly between these versions. The analysis must be confined to Tarkovsky's film.\n*   **Character Psychology:** Understanding the psychological state of each character is key. They are all under immense mental strain due to their isolation and the mysterious phenomena of the planet Solaris.\n*   **The Emotion of \"Shame\":** The key is not just missing Earth, but feeling *ashamed* of this nostalgia. This suggests a conflict between the character's perceived duty (as a scientist, an explorer) and their fundamental human longings.\n*   **The Specific Detail:** The \"sound of rustling leaves\" is a very concrete and poetic detail, typical of Tarkovsky's style. We need to recall which character voices this specific memory.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Character Option**\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. The film opens and closes with him on Earth, surrounded by nature, including the sounds of leaves and water. He is deeply tied to his memories of Earth, but he doesn't express shame about it. His struggle is more with the nature of his love for the replica of his wife, Hari.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memories created by the Solaris ocean. She has no memories of Earth herself and therefore cannot miss it.\n*   **C. Snaut:** A cyberneticist who has been on the station for a long time. He is cynical, weary, and philosophical. He often reflects on the human condition and the futility of their mission. In a conversation with Kris, he confesses his own vulnerability and disillusionment. He delivers the line that directly answers the question, admitting his shame over missing something so simple and terrestrial while engaged in the grand project of space exploration.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** A biologist who is cold, detached, and obsessed with the scientific aspects of their situation. He views emotions like nostalgia as a weakness and an obstacle to his research. It would be completely out of character for him to admit to such a feeling, let alone feel shame over it.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Kris's friend who commits suicide before Kris arrives. We only see him in a recorded video message. His message is a desperate warning, but he does not mention this specific sentiment.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude**\nBased on the analysis, Dr. Snaut is the only character who explicitly voices this feeling. He confesses to Kris, \"You know, sometimes I'm ashamed to admit that I miss the sound of rustling leaves.\" This line perfectly encapsulates his character's weariness and the film's theme of humanity being unable to escape its own nature and its connection to Earth, even in the vastness of the cosmos.\n\n<<<C>>>"
