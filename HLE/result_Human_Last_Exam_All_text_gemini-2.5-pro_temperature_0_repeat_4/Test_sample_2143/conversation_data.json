    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\nThe question provides several key pieces of information:\n*   **\"HE\"**: A male figure associated with a significant work.\n*   **\"HIS work\"**: A foundational text or set of laws.\n*   **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: The specific part being referenced is the conclusion or final section.\n*   **\"separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\"**: This refers to a rule or law against desiring or taking someone else's property.\n*   **\"prohibition against representation\"**: This is a very specific concept, often referring to a ban on making images or idols.\n*   **\"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: The act of addressing material possessions is said to bypass or ignore the ban on representation.\n*   **\"Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: The entire analysis is based on the scholarship of this specific person.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Core Concepts**\n*   The \"prohibition against representation\" is a famous religious and philosophical concept, most notably found in the Second Commandment of the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments): \"You shall not make for yourself a carved image...\"\n*   The rule about \"another's material possessions\" at the \"end\" of a set of laws strongly points to the Tenth Commandment: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.\" This is the last of the Ten Commandments.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Concepts with Veronika Campan's Interpretation**\nThe puzzle hinges on how the Tenth Commandment \"naturally ignores\" the Second. According to Veronika Campan's analysis (often cited by other thinkers like Slavoj Žižek), the Tenth Commandment is unique. While the Second Commandment forbids making external images, the Tenth Commandment, by listing the objects of desire (house, wife, ox, donkey), forces the individual to create a *mental representation* or *internal image* of the very things they are forbidden to covet. In this way, the text itself generates the representation it elsewhere prohibits, thus \"naturally ignoring\" the absolute ban on images.\n\n**Step 4: Identify \"HE\" and \"HIS work\"**\n*   The work in question is the Ten Commandments, which are a central part of the Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament).\n*   According to Judeo-Christian and Islamic tradition, the Ten Commandments were given by God to a prophet on Mount Sinai. This prophet then delivered these laws to his people and is traditionally considered the author of the Torah.\n*   This central figure, who received and transmitted this work, is Moses.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe figure who, according to the biblical narrative, delivered the Ten Commandments (HIS work), which ends with the prohibition on coveting material possessions and, in doing so, \"ignores the prohibition against representation\" (per Campan's interpretation), is Moses. The question asks for HIS full name. In this historical and religious context, \"Moses\" is his full and complete name.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
