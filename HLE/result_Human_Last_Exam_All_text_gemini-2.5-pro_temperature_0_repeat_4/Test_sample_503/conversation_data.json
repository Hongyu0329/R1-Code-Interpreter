    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category consists of a pair of 1-morphisms $L: A \\to B$ and $R: B \\to A$, and two 2-morphisms, the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_B$, satisfying the triangle identities. We are asked to find the number of such adjunctions from $A = [23]$ to $B = [37]$ in the 2-category $\\Delta$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the 2-category $\\Delta$**\nThe objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$, viewed as posets with the standard order.\nThe 1-morphisms are the morphisms in the simplex category, which are order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$. That is, if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\nThe 2-morphisms are given by the structure of a locally posetal 2-category. For any two parallel 1-morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism $f \\Rightarrow g$ exists if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. This is the pointwise order on the set of morphisms.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the definition of an internal adjunction**\nLet's apply the definition to our specific case with $A = [23]$ and $B = [37]$.\nAn internal adjunction consists of:\n1.  Two 1-morphisms (order-preserving maps): $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n2.  A unit 2-morphism $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$. By the definition of 2-morphisms in $\\Delta$, this means $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$ for all $i \\in [23]$. This simplifies to $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n3.  A counit 2-morphism $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$. This means $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$. This simplifies to $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThe two conditions $i \\le R(L(i))$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$ are precisely the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $[23]$ and $[37]$. The maps $L$ and $R$ are called a pair of adjoint functors between posets, where $L$ is the left adjoint and $R$ is the right adjoint.\n\nThe triangle identities for the adjunction are automatically satisfied because the hom-sets are posets (any two parallel 2-morphisms are equal if they exist), so we don't need to check them separately.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to count the number of pairs of order-preserving maps $(L, R)$ that form a Galois connection between $[23]$ and $[37]$.\n\n**Step 3: Counting Galois connections**\nA key property of adjunctions is that the left adjoint $L$ determines the right adjoint $R$ (and vice-versa). Thus, we only need to count the number of possible left adjoints $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n\nA map between posets is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (suprema). The posets $[n]$ are complete lattices. The joins are given by the maximum element of a subset, and the join of the empty set is the bottom element, $0$.\nAn order-preserving map between total orders automatically preserves non-empty joins (maxima). For $L$ to preserve all joins, it must also preserve the empty join, which means it must map the bottom element of the domain to the bottom element of the codomain.\nSo, a map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $L(0) = 0$.\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ that satisfy $L(0) = 0$.\nAn order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is a sequence of 24 integers $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that $0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. So we need to count the number of sequences $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that $0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. It is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps from a poset with 23 elements (e.g., $[22]$) to the poset $[37]$.\nThe number of order-preserving maps from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\left(\\!\\!{n+1 \\choose m+1}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{(n+1)+(m+1)-1}{m+1} = \\binom{n+m+1}{m+1}$.\nIn our case, we are choosing a non-decreasing sequence of 23 values ($L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $37+1=38$ elements. This is equivalent to counting order-preserving maps from $[22]$ to $[37]$.\nSo, we have $m=22$ and $n=37$.\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{37 + 22 + 1}{22 + 1} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n**Step 4: Verification (optional but recommended)**\nWe can also count the number of right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$. A map is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all meets (infima). For posets $[n]$, this means the map must be order-preserving and preserve the top element.\nSo, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $R(37) = 23$.\nThis means we need to choose a sequence $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ such that $0 \\le R(0) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$.\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps from $[36]$ to $[23]$.\nHere, $m=36$ and $n=23$.\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{23 + 36 + 1}{36 + 1} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we can see that our two calculations agree:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nThis gives us confidence in the result.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$."
