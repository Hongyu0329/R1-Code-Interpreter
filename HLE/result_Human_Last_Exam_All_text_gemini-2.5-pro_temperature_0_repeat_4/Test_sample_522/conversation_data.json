    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle's logic.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Transformation in Input_A and Output_A**\n\n*   **Input_A:**\n    ```\n    001111\n    121111\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_A:**\n    ```\n    201111\n    101111\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** The character '2' is at position (row=1, col=1) in the input. In the output, this position becomes '0'. A new '2' appears at position (row=0, col=0), which was originally '0'. This suggests the '2' has moved from (1,1) to (0,0), and its original location was filled with a '0'.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Transformation in Input_B and Output_B**\n\n*   **Input_B:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000011110\n    1111002111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_B:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000211110\n    1111000111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** The '2' is at (row=3, col=6) in the input. In the output, this position becomes '0'. A new '2' appears at (row=2, col=7), which was originally '0'. The '2' moved from (3,6) to (2,7).\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Transformation Rule**\n\nBased on the observations, we can deduce a set of rules for the movement of the '2'. Let's treat the grid as a physical space where '1's are walls and '0's are empty spaces.\n\n1.  **Pre-condition for movement:** In both examples, the '2' has a '1' directly below it. This suggests the '2' must be \"supported\" by a '1' (or be on the bottom row) to initiate a move.\n    *   In A, `Input_A[2][1]` is '1', supporting the '2' at `(1,1)`.\n    *   In B, `Input_B[4][6]` is '1', supporting the '2' at `(3,6)`.\n\n2.  **Vertical Movement:** If supported, the '2' first attempts to move one step up, provided the space is empty ('0').\n    *   In A, the '2' at `(1,1)` moves up to `(0,1)` because `Input_A[0][1]` is '0'.\n    *   In B, the '2' at `(3,6)` moves up to `(2,6)` because `Input_B[2][6]` is '0'.\n\n3.  **Horizontal Movement (Sliding):** After moving up, the '2' attempts to slide sideways into an empty space ('0'). There appears to be a directional preference.\n    *   In A, after moving to `(0,1)`, it checks its sides. The right side `(0,2)` is a '1' (blocked). The left side `(0,0)` is a '0' (open). So, it slides left to `(0,0)`.\n    *   In B, after moving to `(2,6)`, it checks its sides. The right side `(2,7)` is '0' (open). The left side `(2,5)` is also '0' (open). It moves right to `(2,7)`.\n    *   This implies a \"try right first, then left\" rule for sliding.\n\n4.  **Finalizing the Transformation:** The '2' moves to its final determined position. Its original position is replaced by a '0'.\n\n**Summary of the Rule:**\n1.  Find the '2'.\n2.  If the cell below the '2' is a '1' (or it's the last row) AND the cell above the '2' is a '0':\n    a. The '2' moves one step up.\n    b. From this new position, it tries to slide right into a '0'.\n    c. If it cannot slide right, it tries to slide left into a '0'.\n    d. The original position of the '2' becomes '0', and the final position becomes '2'.\n3.  If these conditions are not met, no change occurs.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Rule to Input_C to find MISSING**\n\n*   **Input_C:**\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **Analysis:**\n    1.  The '2' is at `(row=1, col=4)`.\n    2.  The cell below it, `(2,4)`, is '1'. The '2' is supported.\n    3.  The cell above it, `(0,4)`, is '0'. The space is open.\n    4.  Therefore, the '2' will move.\n    5.  **Vertical move:** It moves up to the intermediate position `(0,4)`.\n    6.  **Horizontal slide:** From `(0,4)`, it checks its sides.\n        *   Check right: The cell `(0,5)` is '0'. It can slide right.\n        *   The final destination is `(0,5)`.\n    7.  **Update the grid:**\n        *   The original position `(1,4)` becomes '0'.\n        *   The final position `(0,5)` becomes '2'.\n\n*   **Constructing the Output:**\n    *   Row 0 (`000000`) changes at index 5: `000002`.\n    *   Row 1 (`011120`) changes at index 4: `011100`.\n    *   Row 2 (`111111`) is unchanged.\n\n*   **The value of MISSING is:** `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
