    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)\nFirst, we identify the atoms in the molecule and sum their electrons.\n*   Carbon (C): Atomic number 6 -> 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): Atomic number 1. There are 3 H atoms (2 in $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ and 1 in $\\mathrm{SiH}$) -> 3 * 1 = 3 electrons\n*   Silicon (Si): Atomic number 14 -> 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): Atomic number 9 -> 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons (N) = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = **32 electrons**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (K)\nNext, we determine the number of basis functions contributed by each atom for the 6-31G** basis set.\n*   **6-31G**: This is a split-valence basis set. Core orbitals are described by one function (from 6 primitive Gaussians). Valence orbitals are split into two functions (an inner part from 3 primitives and an outer part from 1 primitive).\n*   **\\*\\***: These are polarization functions. The first `*` adds a set of d-functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. The second `*` adds a set of p-functions to hydrogen atoms. We will assume the standard 6 Cartesian d-functions and 3 p-functions.\n\nLet's count the functions for each atom:\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**:\n    *   Valence (1s) is split into 2 functions.\n    *   Polarization (`**` adds p-functions) adds 3 functions (px, py, pz).\n    *   Total per H = 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n    *   For 3 H atoms: 3 * 5 = **15 basis functions**.\n\n*   **Carbon (C)** (a second-row heavy atom):\n    *   Core (1s) is 1 function.\n    *   Valence (2s, 2p) gives 1 (for 2s inner) + 1 (for 2s outer) + 3 (for 2p inner) + 3 (for 2p outer) = 8 functions. A simpler way: 1 (2s) + 3 (2p) = 4 valence orbitals, each split in two -> 4 * 2 = 8 functions.\n    *   Total from 6-31G part = 1 (core) + 8 (valence) = 9 functions.\n    *   Polarization (`**` adds d-functions) adds 6 functions (dxx, dyy, dzz, dxy, dxz, dyz).\n    *   Total per C = 9 + 6 = **15 basis functions**.\n\n*   **Fluorine (F)** (also a second-row heavy atom):\n    *   The count is the same as for Carbon.\n    *   Total per F = **15 basis functions**.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si)** (a third-row heavy atom):\n    *   Core (1s, 2s, 2p) gives 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 functions.\n    *   Valence (3s, 3p) gives 1 (3s) + 3 (3p) = 4 orbitals, each split in two -> 4 * 2 = 8 functions.\n    *   Total from 6-31G part = 5 (core) + 8 (valence) = 13 functions.\n    *   Polarization (`**` adds d-functions) adds 6 functions.\n    *   Total per Si = 13 + 6 = **19 basis functions**.\n\nTotal number of basis functions (K) = 15 (from 3H) + 15 (from C) + 15 (from F) + 19 (from Si) = **64 basis functions**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of singlet CSFs\nFor a full CI calculation, we need to find the number of ways to distribute the N electrons among the K spatial orbitals for a given spin state. The molecule has an even number of electrons (N=32), so the ground state is a singlet state (total spin S=0).\n\nThe number of CSFs for a system with N electrons, K spatial orbitals, and total spin S is given by the formula:\n$N_{CSF}(N, K, S) = \\binom{K}{N/2-S} \\binom{K}{N/2+S} - \\binom{K}{N/2-S-1} \\binom{K}{N/2+S+1}$\n\nFor our system:\n*   N = 32\n*   K = 64\n*   S = 0\n*   N/2 = 16\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16-0} \\binom{64}{16+0} - \\binom{64}{16-0-1} \\binom{64}{16+0+1}$\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15} \\binom{64}{17}$\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the binomial coefficients\nWe need to calculate the values for the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15!49!} = 952,758,518,657,960$\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16!48!} = 2,917,809,220,890$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17!47!} = 8,238,520,152,865,880$\n\n### Step 5: Compute the final number\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation for $N_{CSF}$:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16}^2 = (2,917,809,220,890)^2 = 8,513,618,916,811,314,922,100$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} \\times \\binom{64}{17} = (952,758,518,657,960) \\times (8,238,520,152,865,880) = 7,849,267,483,544,579,548,928,000$\n\nFinally, subtract the second term from the first:\n$N_{CSF} = 8,513,618,916,811,314,922,100 - 7,849,267,483,544,579,548,928,000$\n$N_{CSF} = 664,351,433,266,735,373,172,00$\n\nThis number can be written in scientific notation as approximately $6.64 \\times 10^{23}$."
