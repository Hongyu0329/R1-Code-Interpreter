    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons).\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Connection to Large Deviation Theory**\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems are fundamental results in large deviation theory. In the context of statistical mechanics, they provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the second law of thermodynamics and the principle of maximum entropy.\n\n*   **Core Idea:** The probability of a large system of particles spontaneously arranging into a macroscopic state (a \"macrostate\") that deviates from equilibrium is exponentially small. The equilibrium state is the most probable macrostate, which corresponds to the one with the highest number of accessible microscopic configurations (\"microstates\").\n*   **Entropy and Rate Function:** The entropy `S` is related to the number of microstates `Ω` by Boltzmann's formula, `S = k_B ln(Ω)`. The probability of a macrostate is proportional to `Ω`, so `P(macrostate) ∝ exp(S/k_B)`. Large deviation theory expresses this probability as `P ≈ exp(-N * I)`, where `I` is the rate function. This implies a direct relationship between entropy and the rate function: **the equilibrium state minimizes the rate function, which is equivalent to maximizing the entropy `S`**.\n*   **Our Task:** We will find the equilibrium state by maximizing the entropy of the photon gas, subject to the physical constraints of the system.\n\n### **Step 2: Defining the System and Constraints**\n\n*   **System:** A gas of light quanta (photons) in a volume `V` at thermal equilibrium.\n*   **Particles:** Photons are bosons, meaning any number of them can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Constraints:**\n    1.  **Energy:** The system has a fixed total mean energy, `U = Σ_i n_i ε_i`, where `n_i` is the number of photons in the energy level `ε_i`.\n    2.  **Particle Number:** Crucially, for photons, the total number of particles is **not conserved**. They can be created and destroyed (e.g., absorbed or emitted by the walls of the container). This means there is no constraint on the total number `N = Σ_i n_i`, which is equivalent to setting the chemical potential `μ` to zero.\n\n### **Step 3: Maximizing the Entropy**\n\nThe number of ways to distribute `n_i` indistinguishable bosons into `g_i` degenerate states within an energy level `ε_i` is given by `Ω_i = (n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! (g_i - 1)!)`. The total number of microstates for a given set of occupation numbers `{n_i}` is `Ω = Π_i Ω_i`.\n\nThe entropy is `S = k_B ln(Ω) = k_B Σ_i ln(Ω_i)`. Using Stirling's approximation (`ln(x!) ≈ x ln(x) - x`) for large `n_i` and `g_i`, the entropy becomes:\n\n`S/k_B ≈ Σ_i [ (n_i + g_i) ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i ln(n_i) - g_i ln(g_i) ]`\n\nWe need to maximize this `S` subject to the energy constraint `U = Σ_i n_i ε_i`. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers, maximizing the function `L = S/k_B - β(Σ_i n_i ε_i - U)`, where `β` is the Lagrange multiplier.\n\nTaking the derivative with respect to `n_i` and setting it to zero:\n`∂L/∂n_i = ∂(S/k_B)/∂n_i - β ε_i = 0`\n`ln(n_i + g_i) - ln(n_i) - β ε_i = 0`\n`ln((n_i + g_i) / n_i) = β ε_i`\n`1 + g_i/n_i = exp(β ε_i)`\n`g_i/n_i = exp(β ε_i) - 1`\n\nThis gives the equilibrium occupation number per state for energy level `ε_i`:\n`<n_i>/g_i = 1 / (exp(β ε_i) - 1)`\n\nThis is the celebrated **Bose-Einstein distribution**. The Lagrange multiplier `β` is identified with the inverse temperature, `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**\n\nThe total mean energy `U` is the sum of the energies of all occupied states. We replace the sum with an integral over the density of states `g(ε)`. For photons in a 3D box of volume `V`, including two polarization states, the density of states is:\n`g(ε) dε = (8πV / (h³c³)) ε² dε`\n\n`U = ∫_0^∞ ε * <n(ε)> dε = ∫_0^∞ ε * [g(ε) * (1 / (exp(β ε) - 1))] dε`\n`U = (8πV / (h³c³)) ∫_0^∞ ε³ / (exp(β ε) - 1) dε`\n\nTo solve the integral, we substitute `x = βε`:\n`U = (8πV / (h³c³)) * (1/β⁴) ∫_0^∞ x³ / (e^x - 1) dx`\n\nThe definite integral is a standard form whose value is `π⁴/15`. Substituting `β = 1/(k_B T)`:\n`U = (8πV / (h³c³)) * (k_B T)⁴ * (π⁴/15)`\n\nThis gives the final expression for the equilibrium mean energy:\n`U = (8π⁵ k_B⁴ / (15 h³c³)) * V * T⁴`\nThis is the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law** for the energy of black-body radiation.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nWe can calculate the entropy by substituting the equilibrium occupation numbers back into the entropy formula. However, a more direct thermodynamic approach is to use the relation `S = (U - F)/T`, where `F` is the Helmholtz free energy.\n\nThe free energy is `F = -k_B T ln(Z)`, where `Z` is the total partition function. For bosons, `ln(Z) = -Σ_i g_i ln(1 - exp(-β ε_i))`.\n`F = k_B T ∫_0^∞ g(ε) ln(1 - exp(-β ε)) dε`\n`F = k_B T * (8πV / (h³c³)) ∫_0^∞ ε² ln(1 - exp(-β ε)) dε`\n\nSolving this integral (typically via integration by parts) yields:\n`F = - (8π⁵ k_B⁴ / (45 h³c³)) * V * T⁴`\n\nComparing this with the expression for `U`, we see a simple relationship:\n`F = -U/3`\n\nNow we can find the entropy:\n`S = (U - F) / T = (U - (-U/3)) / T = (4U/3) / T`\n\nSubstituting the expression for `U`:\n`S = (4 / (3T)) * (8π⁵ k_B⁴ / (15 h³c³)) * V * T⁴`\n\nThis gives the final expression for the equilibrium entropy:\n`S = (32π⁵ k_B⁴ / (45 h³c³)) * V * T³`\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe equilibrium values for a photon gas, derived from the principle of maximum entropy (which is justified by large deviation theorems), are:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n    `U = (8π⁵ k_B⁴ / (15 h³c³)) * V * T⁴`\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n    `S = (32π⁵ k_B⁴ / (45 h³c³)) * V * T³`\n\nwhere `V` is the volume, `T` is the temperature, `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `h` is the Planck constant, and `c` is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\nThe equilibrium mean energy is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black-body radiation:\n`U = (8π⁵ k_B⁴ / (15 h³c³)) * V * T⁴`\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\nThe equilibrium entropy is given by:\n`S = (32π⁵ k_B⁴ / (45 h³c³)) * V * T³`\n\nHere, `V` is the volume, `T` is the absolute temperature, `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, `h` is the Planck constant, and `c` is the speed of light.\n>>>"
