    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject and Anatomical Feature:** The question focuses on a specific dinosaur, *Irritator challengeri*, and a particular feature of its skull: the lacrimal recess. The lacrimal is a bone that typically forms the front border of the eye socket. A recess is a depression or hollow area on a bone.\n\n2.  **Consult Primary Scientific Literature:** To answer a specific anatomical question like this, we must refer to the scientific papers that describe the fossil. The primary reference for the skull of *Irritator challengeri* (holotype specimen SMNS 58022) is the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David Martill, and Diane Scott, titled \"*Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\"\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Description:** Within this paper, we need to find the section describing the lacrimal bone. The authors provide a detailed description of each part of the preserved skull.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Recess:** In their description of the lacrimal bone, Sues et al. (2002) state that the lateral (outer) surface of the lacrimal is deeply excavated by the lacrimal recess. This recess is part of the larger antorbital fossa (a large opening in the skull in front of the eye).\n\n5.  **Count the Depressions/Openings within the Recess:** The crucial part of the description for answering the question is what the paper says is *housed* within this recess. The paper explicitly states: \"This recess houses **two** large subsidiary openings, the maxillary and lacrimal fenestrae...\"\n\n6.  **Interpret the Terminology:** The term \"depressions\" in the user's question corresponds to the \"subsidiary openings\" or \"fenestrae\" mentioned in the scientific paper. A fenestra is an opening or window in the bone, which is a form of depression. Therefore, the lacrimal recess contains two such features.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Based on the authoritative scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* type specimen, the lacrimal recess contains two distinct depressions, which are the maxillary and lacrimal fenestrae.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important to distinguish between the lacrimal recess itself (which is one large depression) and the features *contained within* it, which is what the question asks for.\n*   Relying on the primary scientific description of the holotype specimen is crucial for accuracy, as this is the basis for our knowledge of the species' anatomy.\n*   The terminology can be complex (recess, fossa, fenestra), but in this context, the \"depressions\" refer to the two smaller openings located inside the larger lacrimal recess.\n\n<<<2>>>"
