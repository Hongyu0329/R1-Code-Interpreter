    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal\".\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Poem and its Source:** The question refers to \"Sir Launfal,\" a Middle English romance poem written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century. To find what it was preserved alongside, we must first identify the manuscript in which the poem survives.\n\n2.  **Locate the Manuscript:** The poem \"Sir Launfal\" exists in only one surviving manuscript. This manuscript is known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**, which is held in the British Library.\n\n3.  **Understand the Nature of the Manuscript:** A careful point to note is that medieval manuscripts were often *miscellanies* or *anthologies*. This means they were collections of various different texts bound together in a single volume, rather than containing just one work. Therefore, \"Sir Launfal\" is just one of several texts included in Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n\n4.  **Examine the Contents of the Manuscript:** The next step is to identify the other works contained within the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript. This manuscript is famous for containing other important Middle English works, such as *Layamon's Brut* and *The Owl and the Nightingale*.\n\n5.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\":** We must now search the list of contents for a work that fits the description of a \"book of manners.\" These were also known as \"courtesy books\" and provided instruction on etiquette, social conduct, and proper behavior, particularly for those in noble households. Within the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript, there is a text that perfectly fits this description.\n\n6.  **Pinpoint the Specific Title:** The book of manners preserved in this same manuscript is titled **\"The Boke of Curtasye\"** (which translates to \"The Book of Courtesy\"). This work details the proper conduct for a young man serving in a great lord's court, covering everything from table manners to personal hygiene and service.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy tracing the poem \"Sir Launfal\" to its sole surviving manuscript, Cotton Caligula A.ii, and then examining the other contents of that manuscript, we can identify the specific book of manners it was preserved with.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
