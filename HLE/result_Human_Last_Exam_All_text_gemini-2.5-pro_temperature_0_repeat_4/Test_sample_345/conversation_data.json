A search query like `\"The Radionist\" Kurt Günther museum provenance` is a good starting point. Since the artist is German, using the German title, \"Der Radionist,\" can also be effective.\n\n3.  **Execution and Information Gathering:**\n    *   Searching for \"Kurt Günther Der Radionist\" quickly identifies the painting as a significant work of the New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement in Germany.\n    *   Multiple sources, including art databases and museum collection websites, point to one specific institution as the owner of this painting.\n    *   The museum identified is the **Lindenau-Museum** located in **Altenburg, Germany**.\n\n4.  **Verification of Acquisition Date:** The next crucial step is to confirm that this museum acquired the painting specifically in **1967**.\n    *   Checking the official collection data for the Lindenau-Museum Altenburg is the most reliable method.\n    *   The museum's records for the painting \"Der Radionist\" (inventory number: G 1418) state that it was acquired in 1967. The records often specify that it was acquired from the artist's estate (\"aus dem Nachlass des Künstlers\").\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the verified information from reliable sources, the Lindenau-Museum Altenburg acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in the year 1967.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Artist and Title Spelling:** Ensure the correct spelling of \"Kurt Günther\" and the painting's title. Using the German title \"Der Radionist\" can yield more precise results.\n*   **Distinguishing Dates:** It is essential to differentiate between the painting's creation date (1927) and the museum's acquisition date (1967). The question specifically asks about the acquisition.\n*   **Source Reliability:** Rely on official museum websites, reputable art collection databases (such as Germany's *Bildindex der Kunst & Architektur*), and academic art history sources for verification.\n*   **Provenance:** The key to answering this question lies in the painting's provenance, which tracks its history of ownership.
