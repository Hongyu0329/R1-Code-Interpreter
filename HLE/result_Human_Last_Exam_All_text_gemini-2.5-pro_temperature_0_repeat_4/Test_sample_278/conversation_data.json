    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve**\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b \\sin t$\nfor $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThe parameter $b$ is defined piecewise:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b=1$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n    This satisfies the equation $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\n    As $t$ varies from $0$ to $\\pi$, $y = \\sin t \\ge 0$. This part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of a circle with radius 1, centered at the origin. It starts at $(1,0)$, goes up to $(0,1)$, and ends at $(-1,0)$.\n\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b=5$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n    This satisfies the equation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\n    As $t$ varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $y = 5\\sin t \\le 0$. This part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis. It starts at $(-1,0)$, goes down to $(0,-5)$, and ends at $(1,0)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the bounding box of the figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that contains the figure, we first find the minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates. This defines the smallest axis-aligned rectangle (the bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **Range of x:** For the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, $x = \\cos t$. The minimum value of $\\cos t$ is -1 and the maximum is 1. So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n    The width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Range of y:**\n    For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin t$, so $y \\in [0, 1]$. The maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n    For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5\\sin t$, so $y \\in [-5, 0)$. The minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n    Combining these, the total range for y is $y \\in [-5, 1]$.\n    The height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the smallest axis-aligned square**\n\nThe smallest square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes that contains the figure must have a side length equal to the larger dimension of the bounding box.\nSide length $S_{aligned} = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\nThe area of this square is $A_{aligned} = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Step 4: Consider rotated squares**\n\nThe question asks for the \"smallest square\", which implies we can rotate the square to find a better fit. The smallest square containing the figure is the same as the smallest square containing the convex hull of the figure.\n\nThe extreme points of our figure are $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(-1,0)$, and $(0,-5)$. The convex hull is the kite formed by these four vertices. We need to find the smallest square that contains this kite.\n\nA key theorem in computational geometry states that the minimum-area bounding rectangle of a convex polygon must have one of its sides collinear with one of the polygon's edges. We can test the orientations given by the edges of the kite.\n\nThe vertices of the kite are $A=(1,0)$, $B=(0,1)$, $C=(-1,0)$, $D=(0,-5)$.\nThe slopes of the edges are:\n*   Slope of BC: $(0-1)/(-1-0) = 1$\n*   Slope of AB: $(1-0)/(0-1) = -1$\n*   Slope of CD: $(-5-0)/(0-(-1)) = -5$\n*   Slope of DA: $(0-(-5))/(1-0) = 5$\n\nLet's analyze the bounding box oriented at 45 degrees (aligned with the edges of slope 1 and -1).\n\n*   **Width 1 (in the direction with slope 1):** This is the distance between the two parallel support lines with slope 1. We find the maximum and minimum of the expression $y-x$ for the vertices.\n    $y-x$ values: $A: -1$, $B: 1$, $C: 1$, $D: -5$.\n    Max value is 1, Min value is -5.\n    The distance is $\\frac{|\\text{max} - \\text{min}|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = \\frac{|1 - (-5)|}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n*   **Width 2 (in the direction with slope -1):** This is the distance between the two parallel support lines with slope -1. We find the maximum and minimum of the expression $y+x$ for the vertices.\n    $y+x$ values: $A: 1$, $B: 1$, $C: -1$, $D: -5$.\n    Max value is 1, Min value is -5.\n    The distance is $\\frac{|\\text{max} - \\text{min}|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{|1 - (-5)|}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe bounding box in this 45-degree orientation has dimensions $3\\sqrt{2} \\times 3\\sqrt{2}$. This is a square.\nThe side length is $S_{45^\\circ} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe area is $A_{45^\\circ} = (3\\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 \\times 2 = 18$.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the areas**\n\nWe have found two possible squares:\n1.  The axis-aligned square with area 36.\n2.  The 45-degree rotated square with area 18.\n\n(For completeness, checking the orientation aligned with the edge of slope 5 gives a bounding rectangle of size $\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{26}} \\times \\frac{30}{\\sqrt{26}}$. The smallest square containing this would have side $\\frac{30}{\\sqrt{26}}$, and area $\\frac{900}{26} \\approx 34.6$, which is larger than 18).\n\nThe smallest area is 18."
