    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Mathematical Object:** The question concerns the category $C$ of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let's denote the algebra by $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. The condition on $q$ means that $q^3=1$ and $q \\neq 1$. Let $l=3$ be the order of $q$.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Category C:** The algebra $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $q$ a root of unity is a complex object. Its representation theory is known to be \"wild\", which means there is no reasonable classification of all its indecomposable modules. They exist in continuous families, making the total number of non-isomorphic modules infinite. Asking for a \"percentage\" in such a context would be ill-defined, as it would involve ratios of infinite quantities.\n\n    This strongly implies that the question refers to a well-behaved, finite part of the representation theory. The standard interpretation in this context is to consider the representations of the **small quantum group**, also known as the Frobenius-Lusztig kernel, which we denote by $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This is the finite-dimensional Hopf algebra obtained by adding the relations $E^l=0$, $F^l=0$, and $K^l=1$ to the standard relations for $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. For $l=3$, this algebra is known to be of **finite representation type**, meaning it has a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. We will proceed with the analysis for this algebra.\n\n3.  **Count the Irreducible Representations:** The next step is to determine the number of non-isomorphic irreducible (or simple) modules for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with $l=3$.\n    *   The simple modules are highest weight modules, classified by their highest weight $\\lambda$.\n    *   For a representation of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, the highest weight $\\lambda$ must satisfy $\\lambda^l=1$.\n    *   For $l=3$, we need $\\lambda^3=1$. The possible highest weights are of the form $\\sigma q^k$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ and $\\sigma = \\pm 1$. The condition $\\lambda^3=1$ implies $(\\sigma q^k)^3 = \\sigma^3 (q^3)^k = \\sigma^3 = 1$. Since $l=3$ is odd, this forces $\\sigma=1$.\n    *   Thus, the possible highest weights are $q^0=1$, $q^1=q$, and $q^2$.\n    *   These three distinct highest weights give rise to three non-isomorphic simple modules, which we can label $L_0, L_1, L_2$.\n    *   **Careful point:** We must confirm these are all the simple modules. This is a standard result in the theory.\n    *   So, the number of irreducible objects in $C$ is $l=3$.\n\n4.  **Count the Total Indecomposable Representations:** Now we need to find the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with $l=3$.\n    *   This is a known, non-trivial result from the structure theory of these algebras. The small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is isomorphic to the Drinfeld double of the Taft algebra $T_l$.\n    *   The number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules for the Drinfeld double of the Taft algebra $T_l$ is known to be $l^2$.\n    *   For $l=3$, the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules is $3^2 = 9$.\n    *   **Careful point:** This result relies on deep structural theorems about quantum groups at roots of unity. The 9 indecomposable modules can be explicitly constructed as quotients and submodules of the three indecomposable projective modules, but for this problem, we only need the total count.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Percentage:** The final step is to compute the required percentage.\n    *   Number of irreducible (simple) objects = 3.\n    *   Total number of indecomposable objects = 9.\n    *   The fraction of objects that are irreducible is $\\frac{\\text{Number of Irreducible Objects}}{\\text{Total Number of Indecomposable Objects}} = \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    *   To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n        Percentage = $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 100\\% = 33.333...\\%$\n\nThe final answer is $100/3$.\n\n<<<33.33333333333333>>>"
