    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the benchmark mountain.**\nThe question explicitly sets Mount Olympus as the primary and tallest mountain. Mount Olympus is the home of the gods in Greek mythology and is a real mountain range in Greece. Its highest peak, Mytikas, stands at 2,918 meters (9,573 feet). Our task is to find the next tallest real-world mountain mentioned in the epic.\n\n**Step 2: List all other historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad.**\nA careful reading of the Iliad reveals several other real, physical mountains that are mentioned by name.\n\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain is mentioned frequently, most notably as the vantage point from which Zeus observes the Trojan War. The context makes it clear this is the Mount Ida near Troy (in modern-day Turkey), not the one on Crete. Its modern name is Kaz Dağı.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (referred to as Samos):** In Book 13, Poseidon watches the battle from \"the topmost peak of wooded Samos, the isle of Thrace.\" This identifies the mountain as being on the island of Samothrace. The highest peak on this island is Mount Fengari.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, the goddess Hera travels from Olympus to Lemnos. Her journey takes her over several mountains, and the text states, \"...from the peak of Athos she stepped upon the sea.\" Mount Athos is a prominent mountain on a peninsula in northeastern Greece.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** In Book 2, the advance of the Achaean army is compared to the earth groaning when Zeus strikes the land of the Arimi, \"where they say Typhoeus lies, under Mount Tmolus.\" This mountain is located in ancient Lydia, in modern-day Turkey, and is now called Bozdağ.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly, Greece, is mentioned as the source of the ash wood used to make the great spear of Achilles.\n*   **Mount Sipylus:** In Book 24, Achilles tells the story of Niobe, who was turned to stone on Mount Sipylus after grieving for her children. This mountain is near ancient Smyrna, now İzmir in Turkey, and is called Spil Dağı today.\n\n**Step 3: Find and compare the elevations of these mountains.**\nNow we must find the modern elevations of these mountains to rank them by height.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 m (9,573 ft) - This is our reference point.\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ):** 2,159 m (7,083 ft)\n*   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m (6,670 ft)\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 m (5,820 ft)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m (5,328 ft)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 m (5,285 ft)\n*   **Mount Sipylus (Spil Dağı):** 1,513 m (4,964 ft)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the tallest mountain after Mount Olympus.**\nBy comparing the elevations from Step 3, we can create a ranking of the mountains mentioned in the Iliad by height:\n1.  Mount Olympus (2,918 m)\n2.  **Mount Tmolus (2,159 m)**\n3.  Mount Athos (2,033 m)\n4.  Mount Ida (1,774 m)\n5.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n6.  Mount Samothrace (1,611 m)\n7.  Mount Sipylus (1,513 m)\n\nThe tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Historical vs. Mythological:** The question specifies \"historical mountain,\" so all candidates must be real, identifiable geographic locations. All the mountains listed fit this criterion.\n*   **Contextual Identification:** It is crucial to use the context within the Iliad to identify the correct mountain when a name is shared (e.g., Mount Ida near Troy vs. Mount Ida on Crete) or ambiguous (e.g., \"Samos\" being identified as Samothrace).\n*   **Accuracy of Mentions:** Each mountain must be explicitly named or clearly referenced in the text of the Iliad. The mountains listed are all verifiably mentioned.\n*   **Elevation Data:** Modern elevation data is used for this comparison, as ancient measurements are unavailable or unreliable. The relative ranking is consistent across geographical sources.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
