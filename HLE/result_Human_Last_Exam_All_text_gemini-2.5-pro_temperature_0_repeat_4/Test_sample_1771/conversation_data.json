    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the etymological development.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form\n\n*   **Root:** The given PIE form is `*seh₂gieti`. The root is `*seh₂g-`. The `h₂` represents a laryngeal consonant.\n*   **Meaning:** The meaning is given as '(s)he’s giving a sign', related to 'tracking, perceiving, seeking out'. This is confirmed by cognates like Latin `sāgīre` ('to perceive keenly') and Hittite `sākizzi` ('he gives a sign').\n*   **Formation:** The form `*seh₂gieti` is a third-person singular present tense verb with the `*-ie-` suffix.\n\n### Step 2: Trace from PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)\n\n1.  **Vowel Development:** The attested Germanic forms (like English *seek*, German *suchen*) point to a PGmc verb `*sōkijaną`. This PGmc `*ō` vowel is best explained as deriving from the PIE o-grade of the root, likely in a causative formation like `*soh₂g-éie-`. In this combination, PIE `*o` + `*h₂` regularly yields PGmc `*ō`. While the question provides an e-grade form (`*seh₂g-`), we must follow the evidence that leads to the actual descendant words.\n2.  **Consonant Development (Grimm's Law):** The PIE voiced velar stop `*g` undergoes Grimm's Law and becomes the voiceless velar stop `*k` in Proto-Germanic. The initial `*s` is unaffected.\n3.  **Suffix Development:** The PIE suffix `*-ie-` (or `*-éie-`) becomes `*-ja-` in Proto-Germanic, forming a Class 1 weak verb. The infinitive form of these verbs ends in `*-janą`.\n4.  **Reconstruction:** Combining these changes, the PIE root `*seh₂g-` (in its o-grade) gives us the Proto-Germanic infinitive **`*sōkijaną`**.\n\n### Step 3: Trace from Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages\n\n#### **Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **Starting Point:** PGmc `*sōkijaną`.\n2.  **Vowel Change (i-umlaut):** The `*j` in the suffix causes the preceding back vowel `*ō` to be fronted. In Old Norse, the result of i-umlaut on `*ō` is `ǿ` (sometimes written `œ`).\n3.  **Consonant/Suffix Change:** The `*k` remains, and the infinitive ending `*-janą` reduces to `-ja`.\n4.  **Result:** The Old Norse form is **`sǿkja`**.\n\n#### **Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **Starting Point:** PGmc `*sōkijaną`.\n2.  **Vowel Change (i-umlaut):** The `*j` causes i-umlaut of `*ō`. In Old English, `*ō` umlauts to `ē`.\n3.  **Consonant Change (Palatalization):** The velar consonant `*k` is followed by the glide `*j` (and the resulting front vowel `ē`). This phonetic environment causes `*k` to palatalize into the affricate `[tʃ]`, written as `ċ`.\n4.  **Suffix Change:** After a heavy syllable (like `sēc-`), the `*j` is lost, and the infinitive ending becomes `-an`.\n5.  **Result:** The Old English form is **`sēċan`**.\n\n#### **Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **Starting Point:** PGmc `*sōkijaną`.\n2.  **Vowel Change:** The PGmc long vowel `*ō` regularly shifts to the diphthong `uo` in Old High German. The expected i-umlaut (`uo` > `üe`) from the `*j` is often not written or did not occur in all dialects for this verb, so the standard form retains `uo`.\n3.  **Consonant Change (High German Consonant Shift):** The PGmc voiceless stop `*k` is affected by the Second Sound Shift. In post-vocalic position, it becomes the long voiceless velar fricative `[xx]`, written as `hh`.\n4.  **Suffix Change:** The `*j` is lost, and the infinitive ending becomes `-en` (or `-an`).\n5.  **Result:** The Old High German form is **`suohhen`**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sǿkja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēċan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sǿkja; Old English: sēċan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
