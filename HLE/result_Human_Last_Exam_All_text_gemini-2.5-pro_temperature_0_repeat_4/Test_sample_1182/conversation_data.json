    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ above the prime 2.\n\n**Step 1: Define the curve and the problem**\nLet the curve be $C: y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve. Since the degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is 5, the genus of the curve is $g = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\nWe need to find the number of double points (nodes) in the stable reduction of this curve modulo 2. The stable reduction is a semistable curve (a curve whose only singularities are nodes) that is birationally equivalent to the original curve.\n\n**Step 2: Find a minimal model of the curve over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$**\nThe given equation has integer coefficients, so it defines a model over $\\mathbb{Z}$. We want to find a model over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ that is minimal, which generally means the 2-adic valuation of its discriminant is minimal.\nLet's try a change of variables of the form $x = 2^k X$ and $y = 2^m Y$. A standard choice for a curve of this form is to try to make the coefficients of the polynomial integral and \"as small as possible\" in terms of 2-adic valuation.\nLet's try the transformation $x = X/2$ and $y = Y/2$.\n$(Y/2)^2 = 8(X/2)^5 + 4(X/2)^4 + 4(X/2)^3 + (X/2)^2 + 8(X/2)$\n$Y^2/4 = 8X^5/32 + 4X^4/16 + 4X^3/8 + X^2/4 + 4X$\n$Y^2/4 = X^5/4 + X^4/4 + X^3/2 + X^2/4 + 4X$\nMultiplying the entire equation by 4, we get a new model for the curve:\n$C': Y^2 = F(X) = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$.\nThis model has coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the 2-adic valuation of the discriminant of the new model**\nThe discriminant of the curve is related to the discriminant of the polynomial $F(X)$. The valuation of the discriminant is a key invariant for determining the reduction type.\nThe roots of $F(X) = X(X^4 + X^3 + 2X^2 + X + 16) = 0$ determine the discriminant. Let the roots be $R_i$. One root is $R_0=0$.\nTo find the 2-adic valuations of the other four roots, we use the Newton polygon for the polynomial $P(X) = X^4 + X^3 + 2X^2 + X + 16$ with respect to the prime $p=2$.\nThe 2-adic valuations of the coefficients are: $v_2(1)=0, v_2(1)=0, v_2(2)=1, v_2(1)=0, v_2(16)=4$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(0,4), (1,0), (2,1), (3,0), (4,0)$.\nThe lower convex hull consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0,4)$ to $(1,0)$, with slope $(0-4)/(1-0) = -4$. Its horizontal length is 1. This corresponds to one root $R_1$ with valuation $v_2(R_1) = -(-4) = 4$.\n2.  A segment from $(1,0)$ to $(4,0)$, with slope $(0-0)/(4-1) = 0$. Its horizontal length is 3. This corresponds to three roots $R_2, R_3, R_4$ with valuation $v_2(R_i) = -(0) = 0$.\n\nThe discriminant of the polynomial $F(X)$ is $\\Delta_F = \\prod_{0 \\le i < j \\le 4} (R_i - R_j)^2$.\nThe valuation is $v_2(\\Delta_F) = 2 \\sum_{0 \\le i < j \\le 4} v_2(R_i - R_j)$.\nLet's compute the pairwise valuations:\n-   $v_2(R_1 - R_0) = v_2(R_1) = 4$.\n-   $v_2(R_i - R_0) = v_2(R_i) = 0$ for $i=2,3,4$.\n-   $v_2(R_i - R_1) = \\min(v_2(R_i), v_2(R_1)) = \\min(0, 4) = 0$ for $i=2,3,4$.\n-   For $i,j \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$, $R_i$ are roots with valuation 0. Their reductions modulo 2 are the roots of $X^3+X^2+1=0$ (from $P(X) \\pmod 2$), which are distinct in $\\mathbb{F}_8$. Thus, $R_i - R_j$ are 2-adic units, so $v_2(R_i - R_j) = 0$.\nThe sum of valuations is $4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4$.\nSo, $v_2(\\Delta_F) = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nFor a genus 2 curve in the form $y^2=f(x)$ with $\\deg(f)=5$ or 6, the model is considered minimal if $v_2(\\Delta_f) < 12$. Since $v_2(\\Delta_F)=8 < 12$, our model $C'$ is a minimal model.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the reduction of the minimal model**\nWe reduce the equation $Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$ modulo 2.\n$\\tilde{Y}^2 \\equiv X^5 + X^4 + X^2 \\pmod 2$\n$\\tilde{Y}^2 \\equiv X^2(X^3 + X^2 + 1) \\pmod 2$.\nThe reduced curve has a singularity where its partial derivatives are zero.\n$\\partial/\\partial \\tilde{Y} = 2\\tilde{Y} \\equiv 0$.\n$\\partial/\\partial X = 5X^4 + 4X^3 + 2X \\equiv X^4 \\equiv 0 \\implies X=0$.\nIf $X=0$, then $\\tilde{Y}^2=0$, so $\\tilde{Y}=0$. The only singular point is $(0,0)$.\nNear $(0,0)$, the equation looks like $\\tilde{Y}^2 \\approx X^2$, or $(\\tilde{Y}-X)^2 \\equiv 0$. This is a cusp, which is not a node. Therefore, the reduction is not semistable (it is additive reduction). The stable reduction is obtained by resolving this singularity.\n\n**Step 5: Use the classification of stable reductions**\nThe theory of stable reduction for genus 2 curves, developed by Liu and others, classifies the possible types of stable fibers. For each type, there are formulas relating the number of nodes ($\\delta$) to the valuation of the minimal discriminant ($v_2(\\Delta_{min})$).\nWe need to find a reduction type that is consistent with our curve's properties ($g=2$, additive reduction at $p=2$, $v_2(\\Delta_{min})=8$).\n\nLet's test a known type from the classification:\n-   **Type:** The stable fiber is an irreducible rational curve (genus 0) with $\\delta$ nodes.\n-   **Genus check:** The arithmetic genus of the stable fiber must be $g=2$. The formula is $g = g_{comp} + \\delta - N_v + 1$, where $g_{comp}$ is the genus of the component, $\\delta$ is the number of nodes, and $N_v$ is the number of components.\n    For this type, $g_{comp}=0$ and $N_v=1$. So, $g = 0 + \\delta - 1 + 1 = \\delta$.\n    For the genus to be 2, we must have $\\delta=2$.\n-   **Discriminant check:** For this specific type of reduction, the number of nodes is given by the formula $\\delta = (v_2(\\Delta_{min}) - 4) / 2$.\n-   **Consistency check:** Using our value $v_2(\\Delta_{min})=8$, the formula gives $\\delta = (8 - 4) / 2 = 2$.\nThis matches the required number of nodes from the genus check. The consistency of these two conditions is strong evidence that this is the correct reduction type.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve consists of a single rational curve with 2 nodes.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of double points (nodes) in the stable reduction of the curve is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
