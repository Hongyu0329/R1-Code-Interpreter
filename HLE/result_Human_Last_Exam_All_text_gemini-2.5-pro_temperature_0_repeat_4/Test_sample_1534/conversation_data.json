    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** Brain anatomy of the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis* or similar). The general brain plan is highly conserved among coleoid cephalopods (cuttlefish, squid, octopus).\n    *   **Key Structure:** Palliovisceral lobe.\n    *   **Anatomical Direction:** \"Adjacent posteriorly,\" which means immediately behind or caudal to this lobe.\n    *   **Task:** Identify and list the brain regions that meet this criterion.\n\n2.  **Locate the Palliovisceral Lobe:**\n    *   The cephalopod brain is a complex mass of nervous tissue surrounding the esophagus, broadly divided into a supraesophageal mass (above the esophagus) and a subesophageal mass (below the esophagus).\n    *   The palliovisceral lobe is a large, unpaired lobe that forms the most posterior (caudal) part of the subesophageal mass.\n    *   Its name indicates its function: \"pallio-\" refers to the mantle, and \"visceral\" refers to the internal organs. This lobe is the primary motor control center for the mantle (used for jet propulsion and breathing), the funnel, the fins, and the viscera (gills, heart, digestive tract, etc.).\n\n3.  **Identify Posteriorly Adjacent \"Brain Regions\":**\n    *   Since the palliovisceral lobe is the most posterior lobe of the central brain itself, there are **no other lobes of the central brain** located behind it. Its posterior surface essentially marks the end of the central brain mass.\n    *   Therefore, the structures lying \"adjacent posteriorly\" are not part of the central brain but are major components of the peripheral nervous system that receive direct and massive projections from the palliovisceral lobe.\n    *   The term \"brain regions\" in a functional context can sometimes extend to these large, complex peripheral ganglia due to their critical role and tight integration with the central brain.\n\n4.  **List the Specific Posterior Structures:**\n    *   **Nerve Tracts:** Emerging directly from the posterior surface of the palliovisceral lobe are large nerve trunks. The most prominent are the paired **pallial nerves**. These nerves contain the giant axon system responsible for rapid, synchronous contraction of the mantle. The **visceral nerves** also emerge posteriorly to control the internal organs.\n    *   **Ganglia (Major Neural Regions):** These nerves connect the palliovisceral lobe to other major neural centers located more posteriorly in the cuttlefish's body.\n        *   **Stellate Ganglia:** The pallial nerves travel to the two stellate ganglia, which are large, star-shaped ganglia located on the inner surface of the mantle. These ganglia act as critical relay and coordination centers, receiving commands from the palliovisceral lobe and distributing them to the mantle muscles. They are the most significant and distinct neural regions found directly posterior to the central brain's outputs.\n        *   **Visceral Ganglia:** The visceral nerves connect to a network of smaller, more diffuse ganglia associated with the various internal organs. These ganglia control autonomic functions like heart rate, digestion, and gill movement.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Central vs. Peripheral Nervous System:** A strict definition of \"brain regions\" would limit the answer to lobes of the central nervous system (CNS). In that case, the answer would be \"none.\" However, this would be an incomplete functional description. The stellate ganglia are so large, complex, and crucial for behavior that they are often considered \"peripheral brains\" and are the most logical answer to what lies functionally posterior to the palliovisceral lobe.\n*   **\"Adjacent\":** This implies immediate proximity. The roots of the pallial and visceral nerves are immediately adjacent. These nerves then lead directly to the stellate and visceral ganglia, which are the next major neural *regions* in the pathway.\n*   **Plural \"Regions\":** The question asks for \"regions\" (plural), making a list of the key ganglia (stellate and visceral) the most appropriate response.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is the rearmost lobe of the central brain. The neural regions located adjacent and posterior to it are the major peripheral ganglia it controls. These are the stellate ganglia (controlling the mantle) and the visceral ganglia (controlling the internal organs).\n\n***\n\nThe brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the **stellate ganglia** and the **visceral ganglia**. These are technically part of the peripheral nervous system but are the major neural centers that receive direct output from the posterior side of the palliovisceral lobe via the pallial and visceral nerves, respectively."
