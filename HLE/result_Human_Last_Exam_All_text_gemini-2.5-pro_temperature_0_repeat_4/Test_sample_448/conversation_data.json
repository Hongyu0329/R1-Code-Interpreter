    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*(Note: Oganesson (Og) is also a noble gas, but it is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth and is therefore not a candidate.)*\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas as a \"percentage of all terrestrial matter\" in \"2002\".\n*   **\"All terrestrial matter\"**: This means we should consider the entire Earth (atmosphere, crust, mantle, core), not just the atmosphere.\n*   **\"2002\"**: The relative abundances of naturally occurring elements do not change on such short timescales. This date is not significant to the outcome.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Abundances of the Stable Noble Gases**\nThe primary reservoir for noble gases on Earth is the atmosphere. Let's look at their concentrations in the air (by volume):\n*   **Argon (Ar)**: ~0.934% (or 9,340 parts per million, ppm). It is by far the most common noble gas.\n*   **Neon (Ne)**: ~18.2 ppm\n*   **Helium (He)**: ~5.2 ppm\n*   **Krypton (Kr)**: ~1.1 ppm\n*   **Xenon (Xe)**: ~0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion, ppb)\n\nBased on this, Xenon is the rarest of the *stable* noble gases. Now we must compare it to Radon.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Abundance of Radon (Rn)**\n*   **Source and Stability**: Radon is different from the other noble gases because it is radioactive. It is not a primordial element from Earth's formation but is instead continuously generated from the radioactive decay of radium (which in turn comes from the decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust).\n*   **Half-life**: Radon's most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days. This means it decays away almost as quickly as it is formed.\n*   **Steady-State Concentration**: Because of its rapid decay, the total amount of Radon present on the entire planet at any given moment is incredibly small. This is known as its steady-state concentration. While its concentration can be locally higher near the ground in areas with uranium deposits, its average concentration in the atmosphere is minuscule, estimated at around 1 part in 10^21 (or 10^-15 ppm).\n\n**Step 5: Final Comparison and Conclusion**\n*   **Xenon (Xe)** is a stable element. Its total amount on Earth is relatively fixed and persists over geological time. Its atmospheric concentration is about 90 parts per billion.\n*   **Radon (Rn)** is a transient element. Due to its 3.8-day half-life, it exists in a state of equilibrium where its rapid decay is balanced by its continuous production. This results in an infinitesimally small total amount of Radon on Earth at any one time.\n\nThe total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is estimated to be in the trillions of kilograms. In stark contrast, the total mass of Radon in the entire atmosphere is estimated to be only a few kilograms. Therefore, Radon is many orders of magnitude rarer than Xenon.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  Distinguish between stable and radioactive noble gases. The key to Radon's rarity is its radioactivity and short half-life.\n2.  Recognize that the year \"2002\" is not relevant to the relative abundance of natural elements.\n3.  Understand that \"all terrestrial matter\" doesn't change the outcome, as the fundamental property of Radon's rapid decay makes its total quantity on the planet (in the crust, atmosphere, or anywhere else) extremely small compared to the stable element Xenon.\n\nThe rarest noble gas on Earth is Radon.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
