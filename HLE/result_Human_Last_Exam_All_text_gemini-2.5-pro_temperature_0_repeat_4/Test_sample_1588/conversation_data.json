    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Expansion**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z$ in the equation $e^Z = e^X e^Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting elements of a Lie algebra (like square matrices). The solution $Z$ is given as an infinite series:\n$Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\n\nEach term $Z_n(X, Y)$ is a homogeneous Lie polynomial of degree $n$. A Lie polynomial is a linear combination of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$. The degree of a term is the total count of $X$'s and $Y$'s within it.\n\nFor example:\n*   $Z_1 = X + Y$ (degree 1)\n*   $Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$ (degree 2)\n*   $Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] - \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [X, Y]]$ (degree 3)\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Question**\n\nThe question \"What is the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\" asks for the number of linearly independent terms (or basis elements) that can appear at degree 10. Any specific term $Z_{10}$ will be a linear combination of these basis elements. The number of such basis elements is the dimension of the vector space of all Lie polynomials of degree 10 in two variables, $X$ and $Y$.\n\n**Step 3: Connect to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe set of all Lie polynomials of degree $n$ in $k$ variables forms a vector space. This space is known as the $n$-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on $k$ generators, denoted $L_n(k)$. The problem is thus reduced to finding the dimension of this space for degree $n=10$ and $k=2$ generators ($X$ and $Y$).\n\n**Step 4: Apply Witt's Formula**\n\nThe dimension of the space $L_n(k)$ is given by Witt's formula:\n$dim(L_n(k)) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nHere:\n*   $n$ is the degree, which is 10.\n*   $k$ is the number of generators, which is 2 (for $X$ and $Y$).\n*   The sum is over all positive integers $d$ that divide $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n**Careful Points for Witt's Formula:**\n*   **Möbius Function $\\mu(d)$:**\n    *   $\\mu(d) = 1$ if $d$ is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    *   $\\mu(d) = -1$ if $d$ is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    *   $\\mu(d) = 0$ if $d$ has a squared prime factor.\n    *   By definition, $\\mu(1) = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculation for n=10 and k=2**\n\nWe need to compute $dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$.\n\n1.  **Find the divisors of n=10:**\n    The positive divisors of 10 are $d = \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n    *   For $d=1$: $\\mu(1) = 1$.\n    *   For $d=2$: $2$ is prime (1 prime factor). $\\mu(2) = -1$.\n    *   For $d=5$: $5$ is prime (1 prime factor). $\\mu(5) = -1$.\n    *   For $d=10$: $10 = 2 \\times 5$ (2 distinct prime factors). $\\mu(10) = (-1)^2 = 1$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the terms in the summation:**\n    The sum is $\\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$.\n    *   Term for $d=1$: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = (1) \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$.\n    *   Term for $d=2$: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = (-1) \\cdot 2^5 = -32$.\n    *   Term for $d=5$: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = (-1) \\cdot 2^2 = -4$.\n    *   Term for $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = (1) \\cdot 2^1 = 2$.\n\n4.  **Compute the sum:**\n    Sum = $1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990$.\n\n5.  **Divide by n=10 to get the final answer:**\n    $dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{990}{10} = 99$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of non-zero coefficients (which corresponds to the number of linearly independent Lie polynomials) of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
