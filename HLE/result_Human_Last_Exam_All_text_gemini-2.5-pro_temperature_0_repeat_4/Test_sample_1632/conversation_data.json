    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, which is another name for a 2D square grid. Let's denote this number by a(n) for an n-step walk.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Lattice and Walk:**\n    *   A Manhattan lattice is a grid of points (x, y) where x and y are integers.\n    *   A walk starts at a fixed point, conventionally the origin (0,0).\n    *   At each step, the walk moves from its current point (x, y) to one of its four neighbors: (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), or (x, y-1).\n    *   A \"self-avoiding\" walk means that the walk never visits the same point more than once.\n    *   An \"n-step\" walk consists of n such moves.\n\n2.  **Calculating for small values of n:**\n    *   **a(1):** From the origin, there are 4 possible moves (right, left, up, down). All are valid 1-step self-avoiding walks.\n        *   a(1) = 4.\n    *   **a(2):** For each of the 4 initial moves, the second move cannot be back to the origin. This leaves 3 possible choices for the second step.\n        *   For example, if the first move is to (1,0), the second move can be to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1).\n        *   Total number of walks = (choices for 1st step) × (choices for 2nd step) = 4 × 3 = 12.\n        *   a(2) = 12.\n    *   **a(3):** Now it gets more complex because the number of choices for the third step depends on the path taken.\n        *   Consider walks starting with (0,0) -> (1,0). There are 3 such 2-step walks:\n            1.  (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0). From (2,0), we can't go to (1,0). We can go to (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1). (3 choices)\n            2.  (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1). From (1,1), we can't go to (1,0). We can go to (2,1), (0,1), (1,2). (3 choices)\n            3.  (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,-1). From (1,-1), we can't go to (1,0). We can go to (2,-1), (0,-1), (1,-2). (3 choices)\n        *   The total number of 3-step walks starting with a move to the right is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.\n        *   By symmetry, the total number of walks is 4 × 9 = 36.\n        *   a(3) = 36.\n\n3.  **The Challenge for n=10:**\n    *   As n increases, the number of possible paths grows exponentially, and the task of checking for self-intersection at each step becomes computationally intensive.\n    *   Manually enumerating all paths for n=10 is not feasible. There is no simple closed-form formula for a(n).\n    *   This is a well-known problem in combinatorics and statistical physics. The values of a(n) for small n have been calculated using powerful computers and sophisticated algorithms.\n\n4.  **Using Known Results:**\n    *   The sequence for the number of self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is a standard mathematical sequence. It is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n    *   We can look up the value for n=10 in this sequence.\n\n5.  **Listing the known values of a(n):**\n    *   a(1) = 4\n    *   a(2) = 12\n    *   a(3) = 36\n    *   a(4) = 100\n    *   a(5) = 284\n    *   a(6) = 780\n    *   a(7) = 2172\n    *   a(8) = 5916\n    *   a(9) = 16268\n    *   **a(10) = 44100**\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Ensure the lattice type is correctly identified (Manhattan = square grid).\n*   Understand the definition of a self-avoiding walk (no repeated vertices).\n*   Recognize that direct enumeration for n=10 is impractical and error-prone.\n*   Relying on established, computed results from mathematical literature or databases like OEIS is the standard and most reliable method for this type of question.\n\nBased on the established results from computational enumeration, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
