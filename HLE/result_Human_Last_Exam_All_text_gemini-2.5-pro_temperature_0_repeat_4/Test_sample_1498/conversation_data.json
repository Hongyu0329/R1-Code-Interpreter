    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The request is to identify the specific range of verses (couplets, or *abyat* in Arabic) in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the names of the 25 Prophets of Islam are explicitly listed.\n\n2.  **Identify the Poem and its Structure:** The poem is *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. It is a foundational text on Islamic creed, structured thematically. The section on Prophethood first discusses the general attributes of Prophets before listing their names.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Section:** We need to find the part of the poem dedicated to enumerating the Prophets. Before the list begins, there is an introductory verse that states the obligation of knowing the 25 Prophets. This is Bayt (verse) 29:\n    > تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ *** كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    > (The details of twenty-five [Prophets] are binding upon every responsible person, so verify and seize the opportunity.)\n\n4.  **Identify the Starting Verse of the List:** The actual listing of the names begins immediately after the introductory verse. The first verse in the list is Bayt 30, which starts with Prophet Adam (peace be upon him):\n    > هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ *** صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    > (They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.)\n\n5.  **Identify the Concluding Verse of the List:** The list continues over the next few verses, naming all 25 Prophets. The enumeration concludes in Bayt 33, which ends with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (referred to by one of his names, Taha):\n    > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى *** عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    > (Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [Muhammad], the Seal; leave misguidance.)\n\n6.  **Determine the Full Range:** Based on the starting and ending verses, the complete list of the Prophets' names is contained within the range starting from Bayt 30 and ending at Bayt 33.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Introductory Verse vs. The List:** It is crucial to distinguish Bayt 29, which introduces the topic, from the verses that actually contain the names. The question asks where the names *are mentioned*, which starts from Bayt 30.\n*   **Verse Numbering:** The verse numbering (29, 30, 31, 32, 33) is standard across most published editions of the poem.\n*   **Name of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:** In the final verse of the list (Bayt 33), Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is referred to as \"Taha\" (طه), which is one of his names mentioned in the Qur'an.\n*   **Verification of Count:** The verses from 30 to 33 list exactly 25 Prophets, confirming this is the correct section:\n    *   Bayt 30: 6 Prophets\n    *   Bayt 31: 6 Prophets\n    *   Bayt 32: 7 Prophets\n    *   Bayt 33: 6 Prophets\n    *   Total: 6 + 6 + 7 + 6 = 25 Prophets.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from Bayt 30 to Bayt 33 in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam*.\n\n<<<From Bayt 30 to Bayt 33>>>"
