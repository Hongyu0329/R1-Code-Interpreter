    "This problem requires us to analyze the quadratic part of the action for a neutral scalar field in the functional integral representation of the partition function at finite temperature.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Partition Function and Euclidean Action**\n\nIn finite-temperature quantum field theory, the partition function, $Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H})$, can be expressed as a functional integral (or path integral) over field configurations. For a neutral scalar field $\\phi$, this is given by:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n\nHere, the integral is performed over all field configurations that are periodic in imaginary time $\\tau$ with period $\\beta = 1/T$ (where $T$ is the temperature and we set $k_B=1, \\hbar=1$). The action $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action, obtained from the Minkowski action by a Wick rotation ($t \\to -i\\tau$).\n\nFor a free, neutral scalar field with mass $m$, the Minkowski Lagrangian density is $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial^\\mu \\phi) - \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2$. The corresponding Euclidean action is:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E[\\phi]$\nwhere the Euclidean Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2$\n\nSo, the full action is:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Operator $D_\\phi$ and the Inner Product**\n\nThe Euclidean action $S_E[\\phi]$ is a quadratic functional of the field $\\phi$. It is often written in a compact form using an operator $D_\\phi$ and an inner product notation:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi)$\n\nTo find the explicit form of the operator $D_\\phi$, we can use integration by parts on the action. Let's denote the 4-dimensional Euclidean spacetime volume element as $d^4x_E = d\\tau d^3x$.\n\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nWe integrate the derivative terms by parts:\n*   $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 = [\\phi (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)]_0^\\beta - \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi)$\n*   $\\int d^3x (\\nabla \\phi)^2 = \\int d\\vec{S} \\cdot (\\phi \\nabla \\phi) - \\int d^3x \\, \\phi (\\nabla^2 \\phi)$\n\nThe boundary terms vanish due to the physical conditions:\n1.  **Temporal boundary term:** For a bosonic field, we impose periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time: $\\phi(\\tau=0, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\tau=\\beta, \\vec{x})$. This makes the term $[\\phi (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)]_0^\\beta$ vanish.\n2.  **Spatial boundary term:** We assume the fields vanish at spatial infinity, so the surface integral over the boundary at infinity is zero.\n\nApplying these conditions, the action becomes:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x_E) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(x_E)$\n\nComparing this to the compact form $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi)$, we can identify:\n*   The operator $D_\\phi$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator: $D_\\phi = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 = -\\partial_E^2 + m^2$, where $\\partial_E^2$ is the Euclidean d'Alembertian (or 4D Laplacian).\n*   The inner product $(\\phi, f)$ is defined by the integral: $(\\phi, f) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x_E) f(x_E)$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Inner Product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$**\n\nUsing the definition of the inner product from the previous step, we can now write down the expression for $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$.\n\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x_E) (D_\\phi \\phi(x_E))$\nSubstituting the explicit form of the operator $D_\\phi$:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\nFrom our derivation in Step 2, we know that this expression is exactly equal to twice the Euclidean action, $2S_E[\\phi]$. Therefore, we can also write it in the form before integration by parts:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = 2 S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nBoth integral forms are valid representations of the inner product.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Euclidean vs. Minkowski:** The entire formalism for the partition function is in Euclidean spacetime. This changes the sign of the spatial derivative terms in the action and the operator, turning the wave operator into an elliptic operator (the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator).\n2.  **Boundary Conditions:** The periodic boundary condition in imaginary time for bosonic fields, $\\phi(0, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\beta, \\vec{x})$, is a cornerstone of the finite-temperature formalism. It is essential for the integration by parts to work out correctly.\n3.  **Definition of Inner Product:** The notation $(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is a physicist's shorthand for the standard $L^2$ inner product over the space of real functions on the Euclidean spacetime manifold ($\\mathbb{S}^1_\\beta \\times \\mathbb{R}^3$).\n4.  **Result is a Functional:** The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is not a constant number; it is a functional that assigns a real number to each field configuration $\\phi(x_E)$. The functional integral then sums the contributions from all possible configurations.\n5.  **Relation to Action:** The inner product is intrinsically linked to the action. By construction, for a free theory, $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = 2S_E[\\phi]$. This relationship is fundamental to performing Gaussian functional integrals.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field is given by the integral of the field $\\phi$ against the result of applying the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator $D_\\phi = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$ to the field. This is equivalent to twice the Euclidean action $S_E[\\phi]$.\n\nIn its explicit integral form, it is:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n<<<>>>\n$\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$"
