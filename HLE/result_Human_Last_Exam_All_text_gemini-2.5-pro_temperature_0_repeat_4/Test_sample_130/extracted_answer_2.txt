As $t \rightarrow \infty$, the edges in the image will be smoothed. Sharp convex corners will be eroded and rounded off, while sharp concave corners will be filled in and rounded out. Straight edges will remain unchanged. Small isolated features (e.g., spots or holes smaller than the filter's neighborhood size) will be completely eliminated. The final result is an image where the boundaries between black and white regions are smooth, with a minimum radius of curvature related to the parameter $\delta$.
