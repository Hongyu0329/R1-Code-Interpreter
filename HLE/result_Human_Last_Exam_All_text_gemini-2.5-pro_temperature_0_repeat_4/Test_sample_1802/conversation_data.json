    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Understand the components of the question:**\n    *   **Qudit:** A quantum system living in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n    *   **Pauli Channel $\\Lambda$:** A specific type of quantum channel acting on the density matrix $\\rho$ of a qudit. We need to know its mathematical form and properties.\n    *   **Complementary Channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$:** For any channel $\\Lambda$ described by a Stinespring dilation, its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ describes the evolution of the state of the environment.\n    *   **Rank of a Channel:** The rank of a quantum channel is a measure of its complexity, defined as the rank of its Choi matrix.\n    *   **Maximal Rank:** We are asked to find the maximum possible value for this rank, considering all possible Pauli channels for a given dimension $d$.\n\n2.  **Formulate a plan:**\n    *   First, define the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ using its Kraus operators. This requires defining the generalized Pauli operators for a $d$-dimensional system.\n    *   Second, find a method to calculate the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. A key result connects the rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ to the Gram matrix of the Kraus operators of the original channel $\\Lambda$.\n    *   Third, compute this Gram matrix for the general Pauli channel.\n    *   Fourth, determine the rank of the Gram matrix. This rank will depend on the probabilities defining the Pauli channel.\n    *   Finally, maximize this rank by choosing the probabilities appropriately, subject to the constraints that they must be non-negative and sum to one.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Generalized Pauli Operators:** The standard Pauli matrices $\\{I, X, Y, Z\\}$ are for qubits ($d=2$). For a qudit ($d>2$), we must use the generalized Pauli operators, also known as Weyl-Heisenberg operators. These are $d^2$ operators that form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n2.  **Orthogonality:** The generalized Pauli operators are orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, i.e., $\\text{Tr}(A^\\dagger B)$. This property is crucial for simplifying the Gram matrix calculation.\n3.  **Rank of the Complementary Channel:** The rank of a channel is not the same as the rank of an output density matrix. It is a property of the channel itself. The connection between the rank of the complementary channel and the Gram matrix of the original channel's Kraus operators is a non-trivial theorem that is central to the solution.\n4.  **Maximization:** The final step involves maximization. We need to show that it is physically possible to construct a Pauli channel that achieves the maximum calculated rank. This involves finding a set of probabilities $\\{p_{jk}\\}$ that are all non-zero while still satisfying the conditions for a valid quantum channel.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel and its Kraus Operators**\n\nA qudit is a quantum state in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. The generalized Pauli operators on $\\mathcal{H}_d$ are given by $U_{jk} = X^j Z^k$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$, where $X$ and $Z$ are the generalized shift and clock operators:\n*   $X|l\\rangle = |l+1 \\pmod d\\rangle$\n*   $Z|l\\rangle = \\omega^l |l\\rangle$, with $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / d}$.\n\nThese $d^2$ operators form an orthogonal basis for the space of linear operators on $\\mathcal{H}_d$, satisfying the relation:\n$\\text{Tr}(U_{jk}^\\dagger U_{lm}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{jl} \\delta_{km}$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel whose action on a density matrix $\\rho$ is given by:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{jk} U_{jk} \\rho U_{jk}^\\dagger$\nwhere $\\{p_{jk}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{jk} \\ge 0$ for all $j,k$ and $\\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{jk} = 1$.\n\nThe Kraus operators for this channel can be written as $E_{jk} = \\sqrt{p_{jk}} U_{jk}$. There are $d^2$ such Kraus operators, one for each pair $(j,k)$.\n\n**Step 2: The Rank of the Complementary Channel**\n\nLet a channel $\\mathcal{E}$ have Kraus operators $\\{E_m\\}$. Its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\mathcal{E}}$ has a rank given by the rank of the Gram matrix $K$ of the Kraus operators. The entries of the Gram matrix are given by:\n$K_{mn} = \\text{Tr}(E_m^\\dagger E_n)$\n\nSo, to find the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, we need to compute the rank of this Gram matrix for the Pauli channel's Kraus operators.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Gram Matrix for the Pauli Channel**\n\nLet's use a single index $m$ and $n$ to label the pairs $(j,k)$ and $(l,m)$ respectively. The indices $m, n$ run from $1$ to $d^2$. The Kraus operators are $E_m = \\sqrt{p_m} U_m$.\nThe entries of the Gram matrix $K$ are:\n$K_{mn} = \\text{Tr}(E_m^\\dagger E_n) = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_m} U_m)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_n} U_n))$\n$K_{mn} = \\sqrt{p_m p_n} \\text{Tr}(U_m^\\dagger U_n)$\n\nUsing the orthogonality property of the generalized Pauli operators, $\\text{Tr}(U_m^\\dagger U_n) = d \\cdot \\delta_{mn}$, we get:\n$K_{mn} = \\sqrt{p_m p_n} (d \\cdot \\delta_{mn})$\n\nThis expression simplifies to:\n$K_{mn} = d \\cdot p_m \\cdot \\delta_{mn}$\n\nThis means that the Gram matrix $K$ is a diagonal matrix of size $d^2 \\times d^2$. Its diagonal entries are $K_{mm} = d \\cdot p_m$.\n$K = \\begin{pmatrix} d \\cdot p_1 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\ 0 & d \\cdot p_2 & \\dots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\dots & d \\cdot p_{d^2} \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 4: Determine and Maximize the Rank**\n\nThe rank of a diagonal matrix is simply the number of its non-zero diagonal entries.\n$\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(K) = \\text{Number of } m \\text{ such that } K_{mm} \\neq 0$.\n\nSince $K_{mm} = d \\cdot p_m$ and $d \\ge 1$, $K_{mm}$ is non-zero if and only if the probability $p_m$ is non-zero.\nTherefore, the rank of the complementary channel is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_m$ (or $p_{jk}$) that define the Pauli channel.\n$\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = |\\{m \\mid p_m > 0\\}|$\n\nTo find the *maximal* rank, we need to find the maximum possible number of non-zero probabilities $p_m$. The total number of these probabilities is $d^2$. We can choose a channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero. For example, the completely depolarizing channel, which maps any state $\\rho$ to the maximally mixed state $I/d$, can be expressed as a Pauli channel with $p_{jk} = 1/d^2$ for all $j,k$. In this case, all $d^2$ probabilities are strictly positive.\n\nSince it is possible for all $d^2$ probabilities to be non-zero, the maximum number of non-zero probabilities is $d^2$.\n\nThus, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
