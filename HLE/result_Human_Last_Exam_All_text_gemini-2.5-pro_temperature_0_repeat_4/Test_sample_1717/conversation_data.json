    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Determine the Base Health:** First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player.\n    *   In Normal Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has 2,800 health.\n    *   In Expert Mode, its health is increased. The specific value for a single player in Expert Mode is 3,640 health.\n\n2.  **Understand Multiplayer Health Scaling:** Next, we need to understand how boss health scales with the number of players in Expert Mode.\n    *   According to the game's mechanics, boss health is increased by a certain percentage for each additional player present when the boss is spawned.\n    *   In Expert Mode, this increase is 35% for each player *after the first one*.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Health Calculation:** We can create a formula to calculate the Eye of Cthulhu's health based on the number of players.\n    *   Let `H` be the final health.\n    *   Let `H_base` be the base Expert Mode health (3,640).\n    *   Let `N` be the number of players.\n    *   The formula is: `H = H_base * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n    *   Substituting the base health: `H = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players.\n    *   If we look at the formula purely from a mathematical perspective, as the number of players (`N`) approaches infinity, the health (`H`) also approaches infinity. The formula describes a line with a positive slope, so it is unbounded.\n\n5.  **Consider the Game's Technical Limitations (Source Code):** The crucial part of the question is \"According to the source code\". This directs us to consider how the game actually stores the health value.\n    *   In Terraria's source code (written in C#), the health of an NPC (Non-Player Character), including bosses, is stored in a variable of type `int`.\n    *   An `int` in C# is a 32-bit signed integer.\n    *   A variable of this type has a minimum and a maximum value it can hold. The maximum value is `2^31 - 1`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Value:** The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer determines the absolute ceiling for any health value in the game.\n    *   `2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,648 - 1 = 2,147,483,647`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the health scaling formula would increase health indefinitely with more players, the game engine itself has a hard limit imposed by the data type used to store the health value. No matter how many players are present, the Eye of Cthulhu's health cannot exceed the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health is this value.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Expert Mode vs. Normal Mode:** The scaling percentage (35%) is specific to Expert and Master Mode. Normal Mode has a different scaling factor.\n*   **Scaling per Player:** The scaling applies to each player *after the first*, which is why the formula uses `(N - 1)`.\n*   **\"Theoretical\" vs. \"Practical\":** The question asks for a *theoretical* maximum with infinite players, which pushes the calculation to its absolute system limit, rather than a practical limit like the server's maximum player count (255).\n*   **Source Code Implication:** The mention of \"source code\" is the key to understanding that the answer lies in a technical limitation (data type limits) rather than the mathematical formula alone.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
