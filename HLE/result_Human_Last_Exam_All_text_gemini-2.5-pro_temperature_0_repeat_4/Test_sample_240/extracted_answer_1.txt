The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance when probed is due to built-in **active decoupling circuits**. These circuits, often using PIN diodes, are a critical safety feature designed to detune the coil during the high-power RF transmit pulse to prevent patient burns and equipment damage. Many coils are designed to be "fail-safe," meaning they default to this non-resonant, decoupled state when disconnected from the scanner and not receiving a specific control voltage. Therefore, when you test it on the bench, you are measuring a circuit that is intentionally non-resonant. A secondary, but also common, reason is **preamplifier decoupling**, where the coil is only designed to be resonant when connected to the specific low-impedance preamplifier it is paired with; without it, the resonant circuit is incomplete.
