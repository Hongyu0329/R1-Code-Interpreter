    "Answering this question requires analyzing permutations with a small number of inversions and checking if they contain the pattern 1324.\n\nLet \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\) be the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) with \\(k\\) inversions that avoid the pattern \\(\\sigma\\). We are asked to find \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\nA permutation \\(\\pi\\) of \\(\\{1, ..., n\\}\\) contains the pattern 1324 if there exist indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) such that \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2) < \\pi(i_4)\\).\n\nFor a small number of inversions \\(k\\), the permutations are \"close\" to the identity permutation \\(12...n\\). The non-identity values are typically localized in one or a few small blocks. A 1324-pattern requires four elements to be in a specific relative order, which often requires them to be spread out. This suggests that for a fixed small \\(k\\), most permutations with \\(k\\) inversions will contain a 1324 pattern if \\(n\\) is large. The permutations that avoid the pattern are those where the inversions are structured in a way that prevents the formation of a 1324 pattern. This typically happens when the disordered elements are confined to the beginning or the end of the permutation.\n\nFor \\(k=0\\), the only permutation is the identity \\(12...n\\), which has 0 inversions and avoids 1324. So, \\(av_n^0(1324) = 1\\) for any \\(n \\ge 0\\).\n\nFor \\(k=1\\), a permutation has one inversion if and only if it is of the form \\(1...j-1(j+1)j(j+2)...n\\) for some \\(1 \\le j \\le n-1\\). Such a permutation contains a 1324 pattern if and only if we can find \\(i_1 < j < j+1 < i_4\\) such that \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(j+1) < \\pi(j) < \\pi(i_4)\\). This simplifies to finding \\(i_1 < j\\) and \\(i_4 > j+1\\) such that \\(i_1 < j < j+1 < i_4\\). This is possible if and only if \\(j>1\\) and \\(j+1<n\\), i.e., \\(1 < j < n-1\\).\nThe permutations that avoid 1324 are those for which this condition fails, i.e., \\(j=1\\) or \\(j=n-1\\).\nFor \\(n=333\\), these are \\(2134...333\\) and \\(12...331(333)(332)\\).\nSo, \\(av_n^1(1324) = 2\\) for \\(n \\ge 3\\).\n\nFor \\(k=2\\), a detailed analysis shows that there are two main types of permutations with 2 inversions: those with two disjoint adjacent swaps, like \\(2143...n\\), and those with a 3-element block being permuted, like \\(231...n\\) or \\(312...n\\). A similar analysis shows that these permutations avoid 1324 only when the disordered block is at the very beginning or very end of the permutation. For \\(n \\ge 4\\), this gives a constant number of avoiding permutations. The number is \\(av_n^2(1324) = 5\\) for \\(n \\ge 4\\).\n\nFor \\(k=3\\), the number of inversions is still small. The permutations with 3 inversions are generated by permuting a small number of elements. For \\(n=333\\), which is much larger than \\(k=3\\), the number of 1324-avoiding permutations with \\(k\\) inversions becomes independent of \\(n\\). We need to enumerate the types of permutations with 3 inversions and count how many of them avoid 1324.\n\nThe permutations with 3 inversions can be classified by the structure of their disordered elements.\n1.  A block of 3 elements is fully reversed (e.g., `...432...`). This corresponds to the permutation `321` applied to `(j, j+1, j+2)`. The permutation is `1... (j+2)(j+1)j ...n`. This avoids 1324 if the block is at the beginning (`j=1`, giving `3214...n`) or at the end (`j=n-2`, giving `1... (n-3)n(n-1)(n-2)`). This gives 2 permutations.\n2.  A block of 4 elements is permuted according to a permutation with 3 inversions. There are 4 such permutations in \\(S_4\\) (up to reversal): `2341`, `2413`, `3142`, `4123`. Each of these types, when embedded in a permutation of length \\(n\\), avoids 1324 only when the block is at the beginning or the end.\n    *   Type `2341`: `23415...n` and `1...(n-4)(n-2)(n-1)n(n-3)`. (2 permutations)\n    *   Type `2413`: `24135...n` and `1...(n-4)(n-2)n(n-3)(n-1)`. (2 permutations)\n    *   Type `3142`: `31425...n` and `1...(n-4)(n-1)(n-3)n(n-2)`. (2 permutations)\n    *   Type `4123`: `41235...n` and `1...(n-4)n(n-3)(n-2)(n-1)`. (2 permutations)\n3.  The inversions are split between two disjoint blocks. For example, one adjacent swap (`21`) and a block with 2 inversions (`231` or `312`).\n    *   `21` at the beginning, `231` or `312` at the end. This gives `21...(n-3)(n-1)n(n-2)` and `21...(n-3)n(n-2)(n-1)`. (2 permutations)\n    *   `231` or `312` at the beginning, `21` at the end. This gives `231...(n-2)n(n-1)` and `312...(n-2)n(n-1)`. (2 permutations)\n4.  Three disjoint adjacent swaps (e.g., `214365...`). A careful analysis shows that for \\(n \\ge 6\\), these permutations always contain a 1324 pattern.\n\nSumming up the distinct permutations found for \\(n \\ge 5\\):\n*   From type 1: 2 permutations.\n*   From type 2: \\(2 \\times 4 = 8\\) permutations.\n*   From type 3: 4 permutations.\n\nTotal: \\(2 + 8 + 4 = 14\\).\n\nAll these 14 permutations are distinct for large \\(n\\). Since \\(n=333\\) is large enough (\\(n \\ge 5\\)), the count is stable.\n\nTherefore, \\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 14\\).\n\nFinal check of the 14 permutations for \\(n \\ge 5\\):\n1.  `32145...`\n2.  `12...(n-3)n(n-1)(n-2)`\n3.  `23415...`\n4.  `12...(n-4)(n-2)(n-1)n(n-3)`\n5.  `24135...`\n6.  `12...(n-4)(n-2)n(n-3)(n-1)`\n7.  `31425...`\n8.  `12...(n-4)(n-1)(n-3)n(n-2)`\n9.  `41235...`\n10. `12...(n-4)n(n-3)(n-2)(n-1)`\n11. `213...(n-3)(n-1)n(n-2)`\n12. `213...(n-3)n(n-2)(n-1)`\n13. `2314...(n-2)n(n-1)`\n14. `3124...(n-2)n(n-1)`\n\nThese are all distinct permutations with 3 inversions that avoid the 1324 pattern."
