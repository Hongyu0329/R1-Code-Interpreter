    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Primary Landmark:** The Pantheon.\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action:** It was removed.\n    *   **Specific Date:** The removal happened around 1950.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination of Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   **The Pantheon's Bell Towers:** The most famous \"removed feature\" associated with the Pantheon are the two bell towers added in the 17th century by Bernini (or his school). They were widely disliked and mockingly called *\"le orecchie d'asino\"* (the donkey's ears). However, these were removed in **1883**, not 1950. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n    *   **The Market Stalls:** For centuries, the Piazza della Rotonda hosted a bustling, and often messy, market, particularly for fish and poultry. This involved numerous stalls and cages. While these were a defining feature of the square, the main market was cleared out in the late 19th century as part of an effort to restore the monumental dignity of the area. So, this does not fit the 1950 timeline.\n\n3.  **Focusing on the 1950 Timeframe:**\n    *   The period after World War II and leading up to the 1960 Rome Olympics was a time of significant urban change in Rome. The city administration focused on modernizing infrastructure and \"beautifying\" its historic center by removing elements considered unsightly or obstructive.\n    *   One of the most significant changes during this era was the dismantling of large parts of the city's tram network, especially the lines that ran through the heart of the historic piazzas.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Feature:**\n    *   A tram line ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda, with tracks passing between the central fountain and the portico of the Pantheon.\n    *   This tramway, including its metal tracks set into the cobblestones and the associated overhead electrical lines, was a very prominent feature of the square's landscape for the first half of the 20th century.\n    *   In the context of urban planning and landscape, this extensive infrastructure can certainly be considered an \"architectural feature\" as it fundamentally defined the appearance, sound, and use of the space.\n    *   The removal of these tram tracks from the Piazza della Rotonda occurred in the post-war period, fitting the \"until 1950\" timeframe specified in the question. This was done to clear the visual clutter and restore an unobstructed view of the Pantheon.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The key to this question is the date, **1950**. Many people immediately think of the \"donkey's ears\" bell towers, but their removal date is incorrect.\n*   The term \"architectural feature\" should be interpreted broadly to include significant urban infrastructure that shapes a space, not just buildings or parts of buildings.\n*   The removal was part of a wider city-wide project to modernize Rome and prepare it for the post-war tourism boom and the 1960 Olympics.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the unique feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda around 1950 was the tramway line.\n\n<<<The tramway line (tracks and overhead wires)>>>"
