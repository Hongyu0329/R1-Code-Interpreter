    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nA self-intersection point is a point (x, y) on the curve that is reached at two or more different values of the parameter t. The curve is a Lissajous curve. The full curve is traced as t varies over the interval [0, 2π), since the least common multiple of the periods of cos(9t) (which is 2π/9) and sin(5t) (which is 2π/5) is 2π.\n\nThe total number of self-intersection points is the sum of the points in the interior of the bounding box [-1, 1] x [-1, 1] and the points on the boundary of this box. For this curve, the boundary consists of the x and y axes, as the curve does not pass through the corners (±1, ±1).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Interior Intersection Points**\nFor a Lissajous curve given by x = cos(at) and y = sin(bt), where a and b are coprime integers, there is a standard formula for the number of self-intersection points in the interior of the bounding box.\nIf a and b are both odd (as is the case here with a=9 and b=5), the number of interior intersection points is:\nN_interior = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\nGiven a = 9 and b = 5:\nN_interior = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nN_interior = (8)(4) / 2\nN_interior = 32 / 2\nN_interior = 16\n\nSo, there are 16 self-intersection points in the open square (-1, 1) x (-1, 1).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Intersection Points on the Axes**\nWe need to find the points where the curve intersects itself on the x-axis or the y-axis.\n\n**A. Intersections on the y-axis (x = 0)**\nFor a point to be on the y-axis, its x-coordinate must be zero.\nx(t) = cos(9t) = 0\nThis occurs when 9t = π/2 + kπ, which means t = (2k + 1)π / 18 for some integer k.\nFor the interval t in [0, 2π), k can range from 0 to 17.\n\nA self-intersection occurs if there are two different times, t1 and t2, where x is zero and the y-values are the same.\nLet t1 = (2k1 + 1)π / 18 and t2 = (2k2 + 1)π / 18, with k1 ≠ k2.\nWe need y(t1) = y(t2), which means sin(5*t1) = sin(5*t2).\nsin(5(2k1 + 1)π / 18) = sin(5(2k2 + 1)π / 18)\nThis equality holds if A = nπ + (-1)^n * B, where A = 5(2k1 + 1)π / 18 and B = 5(2k2 + 1)π / 18.\n- If n is even, this leads to k1 = k2, which is not a self-intersection.\n- If n is odd (n = 2m+1), the condition becomes:\n  5(2k1 + 1) = 18(2m+1) - 5(2k2 + 1)\n  10(k1 + k2 + 1) = 18(2m+1)\n  5(k1 + k2 + 1) = 9(2m+1)\nSince 5 and 9 are coprime, (k1 + k2 + 1) must be a multiple of 9. Also, for n to be odd, p in (k1+k2+1)=9p must be odd.\nLet k1 + k2 + 1 = 9p, where p is an odd integer.\nWe consider k1, k2 in the range [0, 17] with k1 < k2.\n- If p = 1, k1 + k2 = 8. The pairs (k1, k2) are (0,8), (1,7), (2,6), (3,5). This gives 4 distinct intersection points.\n- If p = 3, k1 + k2 = 26. The pairs (k1, k2) are (9,17), (10,16), (11,15), (12,14). This gives another 4 distinct intersection points.\n- Other odd values of p do not yield solutions in the required range.\nIn total, there are 4 + 4 = 8 self-intersection points on the y-axis.\n\n**B. Intersections on the x-axis (y = 0)**\nFor a point to be on the x-axis, its y-coordinate must be zero.\ny(t) = sin(5t) = 0\nThis occurs when 5t = kπ, which means t = kπ / 5 for some integer k.\nFor the interval t in [0, 2π), k can range from 0 to 9.\n\nA self-intersection occurs if there are two different times, t1 and t2, where y is zero and the x-values are the same.\nLet t1 = k1π / 5 and t2 = k2π / 5, with k1 ≠ k2.\nWe need x(t1) = x(t2), which means cos(9*t1) = cos(9*t2).\ncos(9k1π / 5) = cos(9k2π / 5)\nThis equality holds if A = 2mπ ± B, where A = 9k1π/5 and B = 9k2π/5.\n- The '+' case leads to k1 = k2, which is not a self-intersection.\n- The '-' case leads to the condition:\n  9k1π / 5 = 2mπ - 9k2π / 5\n  9(k1 + k2) = 10m\nSince 9 and 10 are coprime, (k1 + k2) must be a multiple of 10.\nWe consider k1, k2 in the range [0, 9] with k1 < k2.\nThe only possibility is k1 + k2 = 10.\nThe pairs (k1, k2) are (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6).\nThese 4 pairs correspond to 4 distinct intersection points on the x-axis: (±cos(π/5), 0) and (±cos(2π/5), 0).\nIn total, there are 4 self-intersection points on the x-axis.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Intersection Points**\nThe total number of self-intersection points is the sum of the interior points and the points on the axes.\nN_total = N_interior + N_on_y_axis + N_on_x_axis\nN_total = 16 + 8 + 4\nN_total = 28"
