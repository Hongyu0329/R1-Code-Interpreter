    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We want to find the number of elements `x` in the group `G = PSU(4, 997)` such that `x^2 = 1` and `x ≠ 1`.\n\n### Step 1: Relate involutions in PSU(n, q) to elements in SU(n, q)\n\nThe Projective Special Unitary Group `PSU(n, q)` is defined as the quotient group `SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where `SU(n, q)` is the Special Unitary Group and `Z(SU(n, q))` is its center.\n\nFor our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. The center `Z(SU(4, q))` consists of scalar matrices `λI` such that `λ^4 = 1` and `λ^(q+1) = 1`.\nWith `q = 997`, we have `q+1 = 998`. The size of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nThe center is `Z = {I, -I}`.\n\nAn element `x = gZ` in `PSU(4, q)` (where `g ∈ SU(4, q)`) is an involution if and only if `x ≠ 1` and `x^2 = 1`.\n*   `x ≠ 1` means `gZ ≠ Z`, which implies `g ∉ Z`. So, `g ≠ I` and `g ≠ -I`.\n*   `x^2 = 1` means `(gZ)^2 = Z`, which implies `g^2 Z = Z`, so `g^2 ∈ Z`.\n\nTherefore, we need to count the number of elements `g ∈ SU(4, 997)` such that `g ∉ {I, -I}` and `g^2 ∈ {I, -I}`. Let this set of elements be `S`.\nThe map from `S` to the set of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is a `|Z|`-to-1 map. Thus, the number of involutions is `|S| / |Z| = |S| / 2`.\n\nThe set `S` can be partitioned into two disjoint sets:\n1.  `S_1 = {g ∈ SU(4, q) | g^2 = I, g ∉ {I, -I}}`\n2.  `S_2 = {g ∈ SU(4, q) | g^2 = -I}` (Note: if `g^2 = -I`, then `g` cannot be `I` or `-I` as `I^2=I` and `(-I)^2=I`).\n\nSo, `|S| = |S_1| + |S_2|`.\n\n### Step 2: Count the elements `g` with `g^2 = I`\n\nWe need to find the number of solutions to `g^2 = I` in `SU(4, q)`. These are the identity element `I` plus all involutions. The number of solutions is found by summing the sizes of the conjugacy classes of elements whose square is `I`.\nIn `U(n, q)`, these elements are conjugate to diagonal matrices of the form `J_k = diag(I_{n-k}, -I_k)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n`.\nFor an element to be in `SU(n, q)`, its determinant must be 1. `det(J_k) = (-1)^k`. So, `k` must be even.\nFor `n=4`, the possible values for `k` are `0, 2, 4`.\n\nThe size of the conjugacy class corresponding to `J_k` in `SU(n, q)` is `|U(n, q)| / (|U(n-k, q)| |U(k, q)|)`.\n\n*   **k=0:** `J_0 = I`. The class size is `|U(4,q)| / (|U(4,q)| |U(0,q)|) = 1`. This is the identity element.\n*   **k=2:** `J_2 = diag(I_2, -I_2)`. The class size is `|U(4,q)| / |U(2,q)|^2`.\n    Using the formula `|U(m, q)| = q^{m(m-1)/2} ∏_{i=1 to m} (q^i - (-1)^i)`, we get:\n    `|U(4,q)| = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n    `|U(2,q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)`\n    Class size = `[q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q(q+1)(q^2-1)]^2 = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n*   **k=4:** `J_4 = -I`. The class size is `|U(4,q)| / (|U(0,q)| |U(4,q)|) = 1`. This is the central element `-I`.\n\nThe total number of solutions to `g^2 = I` in `SU(4, q)` is `1 + q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + 1 = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + 2`.\nThe set `S_1` excludes `I` and `-I`, so `|S_1| = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n\n### Step 3: Count the elements `g` with `g^2 = -I`\n\nWe need to find `|S_2|`, the number of solutions to `g^2 = -I` in `SU(4, q)`. The structure of these solutions depends on whether `-1` is a square in the field `F_q`.\nHere `q = 997`. Since `997 ≡ 1 (mod 4)`, `-1` is a square in `F_{997}`.\n\nFor `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)` and `n=2m` (here `n=4, m=2`), it is a known result that any element `g ∈ U(n, q)` with `g^2 = -I` has eigenspaces for `i` and `-i` that are totally isotropic and have dimension `m`. This implies there is only one conjugacy class of such elements in `U(n, q)`.\nThe centralizer of such an element in `U(2m, q)` is isomorphic to `GL(m, q)`.\nThe number of solutions to `g^2 = -I` in `U(4, q)` is `|U(4, q)| / |GL(2, q)|`.\n\nThe determinant of such an element `g` is `i^m(-i)^m = 1^m = 1`. For `m=2`, the determinant is 1. This means all solutions in `U(4, q)` are already in `SU(4, q)`.\nSo, `|S_2| = N(SU(4,q), -I) = |U(4, q)| / |GL(2, q)|`.\n\n`|GL(2, q)| = (q^2-1)(q^2-q) = q(q-1)(q^2-1)`.\n`|S_2| = [q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q(q-1)(q^2-1)]`\n`|S_2| = q^5 (q+1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1) / (q-1)`\n`|S_2| = q^5 (q+1)(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q-1)(q+1)(q^2+1) / (q-1)`\n`|S_2| = q^5(q+1)^3(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the final number\n\nThe total number of preimages of involutions is `|S| = |S_1| + |S_2|`.\n`|S| = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^5(q+1)^3(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\nWe can factor this expression:\n`|S| = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) * [1 + q(q+1)^3]`.\n\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is `|S| / 2`.\nNumber of involutions = `(1/2) * q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) * [1 + q(q+1)^3]`.\n\nSubstituting `q = 997`:\nNumber = `(1/2) * 997^4 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) * (997^2 + 1) * [1 + 997 * (997 + 1)^3]`\nNumber = `(1/2) * 997^4 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) * (997^2 + 1) * (1 + 997 * 998^3)`.\n\nThis formula gives the precise number of involutions."
