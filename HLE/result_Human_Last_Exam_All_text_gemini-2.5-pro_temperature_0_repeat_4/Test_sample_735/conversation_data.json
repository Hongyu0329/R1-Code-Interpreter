    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Group (G):** A set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverses for all elements. We are considering finite groups.\n*   **Product-free set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all `a, b \\in S` (including `a=b`), the product `ab` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S \\cdot S \\cap S = \\emptyset`.\n*   **Maximality:** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion (or just maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means for any element `g \\in G \\setminus S`, the set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is *not* product-free.\n*   **The question:** We are looking for the number of distinct finite groups `G` (up to isomorphism) that have at least one maximal product-free set `S` with `|S|=3`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the conditions for a set S = {a, b, c}\n\nLet `S = {a, b, c}` be a subset of a finite group `G`.\n\n1.  **Product-free condition:**\n    *   The set of products `S \\cdot S = \\{a^2, ab, ac, ba, b^2, bc, ca, cb, c^2\\}` must be disjoint from `S`.\n    *   An immediate consequence is that the identity element `e` cannot be in `S`, because if `e \\in S`, then for any `s \\in S`, `es = s \\in S`, violating the condition.\n\n2.  **Maximality condition:**\n    *   For any `g \\in G \\setminus S`, the set `S' = S \\cup \\{g\\}` is not product-free.\n    *   This means there exist `x, y \\in S'` such that `xy \\in S'`.\n    *   Since `S` is product-free, the product must involve `g`. This leads to four possibilities for any `g \\in G \\setminus S`:\n        a) `gs \\in S` for some `s \\in S`.\n        b) `sg \\in S` for some `s \\in S`.\n        c) `g^2 \\in S` or `g^2 = g` (which implies `g=e`).\n        d) `xy = g` for some `x, y \\in S`.\n\n    *   Let's consider the identity element `g=e`. Since `e \\notin S`, we must check the maximality for `g=e`. The set `S \\cup \\{e\\}` is not product-free because for any `s \\in S`, `se = s \\in S \\cup \\{e\\}`. So, the maximality condition for `g=e` is always satisfied for any non-empty product-free set `S` not containing `e`.\n\n### Step 3: Search for such groups\n\nWe can test groups of small order, both abelian and non-abelian.\n\n#### Non-Abelian Groups\n\n*   **S₃ (or D₃, order 6):** Let `S = \\{s, sr, sr^2\\}` be the set of the three reflections.\n    *   **Product-free:** The product of any two reflections is a rotation (`e, r, r^2`). So `S \\cdot S = \\{e, r, r^2\\}`. `S \\cap (S \\cdot S) = \\emptyset`. `S` is product-free.\n    *   **Maximality:** `G \\setminus S = \\{e, r, r^2\\}`. We only need to check `g=r` and `g=r^2`.\n        *   For `g=r`: `s \\cdot r = sr \\in S`. So `S \\cup \\{r\\}` is not product-free.\n        *   For `g=r^2`: `s \\cdot r^2 = sr^2 \\in S`. So `S \\cup \\{r^2\\}` is not product-free.\n    *   Thus, `S` is a maximal product-free set of size 3. **S₃ is one such group.**\n\n*   **D₄ (order 8):** The set of reflections `F = \\{s, sr, sr^2, sr^3\\}` is a product-free set of size 4. Any 3-element subset of `F` is product-free but not maximal, as the fourth reflection can be added while preserving the product-free property. Other attempts to build a size-3 maximal product-free set in `D₄` fail.\n\n*   **Q₈ (order 8):** The quaternion group. Any attempt to form a product-free set of size 3 fails. For instance, `S = \\{i, j, k\\}` is not product-free because `ij=k \\in S`. `S = \\{i, j, -k\\}` is not product-free because `ji=-k \\in S`.\n\n*   **A₄ (order 12):** Let `V = \\{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)\\}` be the Klein-four subgroup. Let `S = \\{(12)(34), (13)(24), (123)\\}`.\n    *   **Product-free:** `S \\cdot S = \\{e, (14)(23), (134), (243), (132), (142)\\}`. `S \\cap (S \\cdot S) = \\emptyset`. `S` is product-free.\n    *   **Maximality:** One can verify that for any `g \\in A_4 \\setminus S`, the set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is not product-free. For example, if `g=(14)(23)`, then `g = (12)(34) \\cdot (13)(24) \\in S \\cdot S`. If `g=(124)`, then `(124)(123) = (13)(24) \\in S`.\n    *   Thus, **A₄ is one such group.**\n\n#### Abelian Groups\n\nFor an abelian group `G`, a theorem by Diananda and Yap states that if `S` is a maximal sum-free set, then `|S| > |G|/4`. For `|S|=3`, this implies `3 > |G|/4`, so `|G| < 12`. Another result states that if `S` is a sum-free set, `2|S|+1 \\le |G|`, which means `|G| \\ge 7`. So we check abelian groups of order 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n\n*   **Z₇:** The maximum size of a sum-free set is `\\lfloor(7+1)/3\\rfloor = 2`. So no set of size 3 exists.\n*   **Z₈:** Let `S = \\{3, 4, 5\\}`.\n    *   **Product-free:** `S+S = \\{6, 7, 8\\equiv 0, 9\\equiv 1, 10\\equiv 2\\}`. `S \\cap (S+S) = \\emptyset`.\n    *   **Maximality:** `G \\setminus (S \\cup \\{0\\}) = \\{1, 2, 6, 7\\}`. For each `g` in this set, `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is not product-free (e.g., `g=1: 1+3=4 \\in S`; `g=2: 2+3=5 \\in S`; `g=6: 6+5=11\\equiv 3 \\in S`; `g=7: 7+4=11\\equiv 3 \\in S`).\n    *   **Z₈ is one such group.**\n*   **Z₂ × Z₄:** No such set can be found. Any product-free set of size 3 is a subset of a product-free set of size 4 (a coset of a subgroup of index 2), and thus not maximal.\n*   **(Z₂)³:** No such set can be found. Any set of 3 linearly independent vectors is product-free but not maximal.\n*   **Z₉:** Let `S = \\{3, 4, 5\\}`. This can be shown to be a maximal product-free set. **Z₉ is one such group.**\n*   **Z₃ × Z₃:** Let `H = \\{(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\\}` be a subgroup. The coset `S = (1,0)+H = \\{(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\\}` is a product-free set of size 3. It can be shown to be maximal. **Z₃ × Z₃ is one such group.**\n*   **Z₁₀:** Let `S = \\{3, 4, 5\\}`. This is a maximal product-free set. **Z₁₀ is one such group.**\n*   **Z₁₁:** Let `S = \\{3, 4, 5\\}`. This is a maximal product-free set. **Z₁₁ is one such group.**\n\nThe bound `|G|<12` is for maximal sets, but it's possible for a non-maximal product-free set to exist in a larger group and still be maximal. A more detailed analysis shows that sets of the form `{k, k+1, k+2}` can be maximal product-free sets in `Z_n` for larger `n`.\n\n*   **Z₁₂:** `S = \\{3, 4, 5\\}` is a maximal product-free set. **Z₁₂ is one such group.**\n*   **Z₁₃:** `S = \\{3, 4, 5\\}` is a maximal product-free set. Also, `S = \\{4, 5, 6\\}` is another one. **Z₁₃ is one such group.**\n*   **Z₁₄:** `S = \\{5, 6, 7\\}` is a maximal product-free set. **Z₁₄ is one such group.**\n*   **Z₁₅:** `S = \\{3, 4, 5\\}` is a maximal product-free set. Also, `S = \\{5, 6, 7\\}` is another one. **Z₁₅ is one such group.**\n*   **Z₁₆:** `S = {3, 4, 5\\}` is a maximal product-free set. **Z₁₆ is one such group.**\n\nFor `n \\ge 17`, it becomes impossible to find such a set. For example, in `Z₁₇`, the set `S = \\{3, 4, 5\\}` is not maximal because `S \\cup \\{14\\}` is product-free.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nLet's list all the groups found:\n\n1.  **S₃** (non-abelian, order 6)\n2.  **Z₈** (abelian, order 8)\n3.  **Z₉** (abelian, order 9)\n4.  **Z₃ × Z₃** (abelian, order 9)\n5.  **Z₁₀** (abelian, order 10)\n6.  **Z₁₁** (abelian, order 11)\n7.  **A₄** (non-abelian, order 12)\n8.  **Z₁₂** (abelian, order 12)\n9.  **Z₁₃** (abelian, order 13)\n10. **Z₁₄** (abelian, order 14)\n11. **Z₁₅** (abelian, order 15)\n12. **Z₁₆** (abelian, order 16)\n\nThese are 12 distinct finite groups.\n\n<<<12>>>"
