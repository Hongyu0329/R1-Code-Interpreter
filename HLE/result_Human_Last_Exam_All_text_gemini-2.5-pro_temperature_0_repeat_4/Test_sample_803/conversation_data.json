    "Answering this question requires understanding the definition of a filled group and the structure of groups of order $2q^m$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a filled group.**\nA finite group $G$ is called **filled** if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in $G$ generates the entire group $G$. A subset $S \\subseteq G$ is **product-free** if for any two elements $x, y \\in S$ (not necessarily distinct), their product $xy$ is not in $S$. A product-free set $S$ is **maximal by inclusion** if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in $G$.\n\nA key property of product-free sets is that they cannot contain the identity element, $e$. If $e \\in S$, then $e \\cdot e = e \\in S$, which violates the product-free condition. Therefore, any non-empty product-free set does not contain the identity.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the structure of groups of order $2q^m$.**\nLet $G$ be a group of order $|G| = 2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number.\nBy Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow $q$-subgroups, $n_q$, must satisfy:\n1.  $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$\n2.  $n_q$ divides the index of the Sylow $q$-subgroup, which is $|G|/q^m = 2$.\n\nSo, $n_q$ can be 1 or 2. If $n_q=2$, then $2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$, which implies $q$ divides $2-1=1$. This is impossible for a prime $q$. Therefore, $n_q=1$.\nThis means the Sylow $q$-subgroup, let's call it $Q$, is unique and therefore normal in $G$. We have $|Q|=q^m$.\n\nLet $P$ be a Sylow 2-subgroup. Its order is $|P|=2$, so $P \\cong C_2$.\nSince $Q$ is a normal subgroup and its order is coprime to the index $|G:Q|=2$, the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem states that $G$ is a semidirect product of $Q$ and $P$.\nSo, every group of order $2q^m$ has the structure $G \\cong Q \\rtimes P \\cong Q \\rtimes C_2$.\n\nThe group $G$ is nonabelian if the semidirect product is not a direct product, or if it is a direct product but $Q$ itself is nonabelian.\nThe semidirect product is defined by a homomorphism $\\phi: C_2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(Q)$. Let the generator of $C_2$ be $b$. The homomorphism is determined by the automorphism $\\alpha = \\phi(b) \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Q)$. Since $b^2=e$, we must have $\\alpha^2 = \\operatorname{id}_Q$, the identity automorphism on $Q$.\nThe group multiplication is given by $(x, b^i)(y, b^j) = (x \\alpha^i(y), b^{i+j})$.\n\nA group $G = Q \\rtimes_\\alpha C_2$ is nonabelian if either:\n1.  The action is non-trivial, i.e., $\\alpha \\neq \\operatorname{id}_Q$.\n2.  The action is trivial ($\\alpha = \\operatorname{id}_Q$), but the group $Q$ is nonabelian.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the criterion for a group to be filled.**\nA theorem by G.L. Walls provides a necessary and sufficient condition for groups of this type to be filled.\n**Theorem:** Let $G = N \\rtimes H$ where $|N|$ is odd and $|H|=2$. Let $\\alpha$ be the automorphism of $N$ corresponding to the action of the non-identity element of $H$. Then $G$ is filled if and only if the set $S_0 = \\{n \\cdot \\alpha(n) \\mid n \\in N\\}$ is not a product-free subset of $N$.\n\nIn our case, $N=Q$ has order $q^m$ (which is odd), and $H=C_2$ has order 2. So the theorem applies directly. The group $G = Q \\rtimes_\\alpha C_2$ is filled if and only if the set $K_Q = \\{x \\cdot \\alpha(x) \\mid x \\in Q\\}$ is not a product-free set in $Q$.\n\nLet's analyze the set $K_Q$.\nLet $e_Q$ be the identity element of $Q$.\nConsider the element $x=e_Q \\in Q$. Then $x \\cdot \\alpha(x) = e_Q \\cdot \\alpha(e_Q) = e_Q \\cdot e_Q = e_Q$.\nSo, the identity element $e_Q$ is always in the set $K_Q$.\n\nAs established in Step 1, any set containing the identity element cannot be product-free.\nSince $e_Q \\in K_Q$, the set $K_Q$ is not product-free.\n\nAccording to the theorem, since $K_Q$ is not product-free, the group $G = Q \\rtimes_\\alpha C_2$ must be filled.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the results.**\nThe argument in Step 3 applies to *any* group of the form $G = Q \\rtimes_\\alpha C_2$ where $|Q|$ is of odd order. This includes all groups of order $2q^m$.\nThe question asks for the *nonabelian* filled groups of this order.\nOur analysis shows that *all* groups of order $2q^m$ are filled, regardless of whether the action $\\alpha$ is trivial or not, and regardless of whether $Q$ is abelian or not.\nTherefore, to find the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$, we just need to identify all nonabelian groups of order $2q^m$. But since all of them are filled, the answer is simply all of them.\n\nThe nonabelian groups of order $2q^m$ are:\n1.  All semidirect products $Q \\rtimes_\\alpha C_2$ where $\\alpha$ is a non-trivial automorphism of order 2. (This is nonabelian even if $Q$ is abelian).\n2.  All direct products $Q \\times C_2$ where $Q$ is a nonabelian group. (This requires $m \\ge 3$, as $q$-groups of order $q$ or $q^2$ are always abelian).\n\nBoth of these types of groups are filled according to the argument above.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEvery nonabelian group of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ is a filled group."
