    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a \"single genus of mushroom\" that is \"known to produce a distinctly blue spore print.\"\n\n2.  **Understand \"Spore Print\":** A spore print is a fundamental tool for mushroom identification. It is the colored deposit of spores left on a surface after placing a mushroom cap on it for several hours. Spore print colors are generally consistent within a genus and are a key taxonomic feature.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Premise of a \"Blue Spore Print\":** In mycology, spore prints come in a specific range of colors: white, cream, yellow, pink/salmon, ochre, rusty brown, dark brown, purple-brown, and black. True blue and green spore prints are considered virtually non-existent among macrofungi (mushrooms). This suggests the question might be a trick question or refer to a common misconception.\n\n4.  **Distinguish Spore Color from Mushroom Color:** It is crucial not to confuse the color of the mushroom's body (cap, gills, stem) or the color it bruises with the color of its spores. Many mushrooms are blue or bruise blue, but this is due to chemical reactions in the mushroom's flesh and is unrelated to the spore color.\n    *   **Example 1:** Many *Psilocybe* species bruise blue, but their spore print is purple-brown.\n    *   **Example 2:** *Entoloma hochstetteri* is a vibrant blue mushroom, but its spore print is pink.\n\n5.  **Identify the Most Likely Candidate:** The question asks for the genus that is \"known\" for this characteristic. This can be interpreted as \"famous for\" or \"reputed to have,\" even if the reputation is technically incorrect. The most famous blue mushroom in the world is *Lactarius indigo* (which has since been moved to the genus *Lactifluus*, but is still widely known by its former name).\n    *   This mushroom is blue through-and-through: its cap, gills, and stem are all shades of indigo blue.\n    *   When cut, it \"bleeds\" a blue latex (milk).\n    *   Because of its overwhelmingly blue nature, it is the mushroom most commonly and incorrectly assumed to have a blue spore print.\n\n6.  **Verify the Candidate's Actual Spore Print:** Despite its name and color, the spore print of *Lactarius indigo* is not blue. It is actually yellowish to cream-colored.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** While no genus of mushroom is scientifically confirmed to produce a distinctly blue spore print, the genus *Lactarius* is the one that is famously and uniquely associated with the color blue due to the species *Lactarius indigo*. It is the genus that is \"known\" in popular culture and among amateur foragers to be the \"blue mushroom,\" leading to the widespread (though false) belief that it would have a blue spore print. Therefore, it is the most logical answer to this trivia-style question.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The question's premise is factually incorrect from a strict scientific standpoint.\n*   The key is the phrase \"known to produce,\" which points towards reputation rather than scientific fact.\n*   It is essential to differentiate between the mushroom's physical color and its spore color.\n*   While the species *Lactarius indigo* is now technically in the genus *Lactifluus*, it is almost universally known and referenced in literature and conversation by its original genus, *Lactarius*.\n\nBased on this analysis, the intended answer is the genus most famously associated with the color blue.\n\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
