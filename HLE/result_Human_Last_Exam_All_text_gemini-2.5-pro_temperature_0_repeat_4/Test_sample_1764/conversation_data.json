    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the definitions\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** A finite set $X$ equipped with a distance function $d(x, y)$ that satisfies the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$.\n*   **Banach Space (B):** A complete normed vector space over the field of real or complex numbers. The distance between two vectors $u, v \\in B$ is given by the norm of their difference, $\\|u - v\\|$.\n*   **Cardinality K:** The number of elements in the set $B$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, i.e., for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the equality $d(x_1, x_2) = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|$ holds.\n*   **The Question:** We are asked for the smallest possible value for the number of isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$. This means we can choose the space $X$ and the space $B$ (among those that satisfy the given conditions) in order to make the number of embeddings as small as possible, with the constraint that at least one embedding must exist.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the number of embeddings from a given one\nLet's assume that for a given pair $(X, B)$, there exists at least one isometric embedding, which we'll call $f_0: X \\to B$. We can use this embedding to construct others.\n\nConsider the family of functions $f_b: X \\to B$ defined by $f_b(x) = f_0(x) + b$ for any vector $b \\in B$. Let's check if these are also isometric embeddings:\n$\\|f_b(x_1) - f_b(x_2)\\| = \\|(f_0(x_1) + b) - (f_0(x_2) + b)\\| = \\|f_0(x_1) - f_0(x_2)\\|$.\nSince $f_0$ is an isometric embedding, $\\|f_0(x_1) - f_0(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$.\nThus, $\\|f_b(x_1) - f_b(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$, which means that $f_b$ is also an isometric embedding for any $b \\in B$.\n\nEach choice of $b \\in B$ gives a distinct embedding, since if $f_{b_1} = f_{b_2}$, then $f_0(x) + b_1 = f_0(x) + b_2$ for all $x \\in X$, which implies $b_1 = b_2$.\nTherefore, if one embedding exists, there are at least $|B| = K$ embeddings.\n\n### Step 3: Considering the cardinality K of the Banach space B\nA Banach space is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$.\n*   If the dimension of $B$ is greater than 0, its cardinality $K$ is at least that of the continuum ($2^{\\aleph_0}$), which is infinite.\n*   If the dimension of $B$ is 0, then $B$ is the trivial space containing only the zero vector, $B = \\{0\\}$. In this case, its cardinality is $K=1$.\n\nThis leads to two main scenarios.\n\n### Step 4: Scenario 1: Non-trivial spaces\nLet's consider a non-trivial ultrametric space $X$, meaning $|X| \\ge 2$. In such a space, there must be at least two points $x_1, x_2$ with a non-zero distance $d(x_1, x_2) = c > 0$.\nIf an isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ exists, then we must have $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = c > 0$. This requires that the Banach space $B$ is not the trivial space $\\{0\\}$.\nTherefore, if $|X| \\ge 2$, $B$ must be a non-trivial Banach space, which means its cardinality $K$ is infinite.\nFrom Step 2, the number of isometric embeddings is at least $K$. So, for any non-trivial finite ultrametric space, the number of isometric embeddings into any suitable Banach space is infinite. This cannot be the \"smallest possible number\" in the sense of a finite integer.\n\n### Step 5: Scenario 2: The trivial case\nThe only way to obtain a finite number of embeddings is if the Banach space $B$ is finite. As established, this means $B$ must be the trivial space $B = \\{0\\}$, with cardinality $K=1$.\n\nNow, we must check if it's possible to have an isometric embedding into $B=\\{0\\}$.\nLet $f: X \\to \\{0\\}$. The only such function is the zero map, $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in X$.\nFor this to be an isometric embedding, the condition $d(x_1, x_2) = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|$ must hold for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$.\nThis becomes $d(x_1, x_2) = \\|0 - 0\\| = 0$.\nThis condition implies that the distance between any two points in $X$ must be zero, which means $X$ can only contain a single point.\n\nSo, let's choose our spaces to be the trivial ones:\n*   Let $X$ be a one-point space, $X = \\{p\\}$. This is a valid finite ultrametric space (the ultrametric inequality holds trivially).\n*   Let $B$ be the zero Banach space, $B = \\{0\\}$.\n\nWe need to find the number of isometric embeddings from this $X$ to this $B$.\nThere is only one possible function $f: \\{p\\} \\to \\{0\\}$, which is $f(p) = 0$.\nLet's check if it is an isometry: $d(p, p) = \\|f(p) - f(p)\\|$. This is $0 = \\|0 - 0\\| = 0$, which is true.\nSo, $f(p)=0$ is an isometric embedding. Since it is the only possible function, it is the only isometric embedding.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nWe have found a valid choice of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which there is exactly one isometric embedding.\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of such embeddings. Since we are assuming at least one embedding exists, the number must be at least 1. We have demonstrated a case where the number is exactly 1.\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
