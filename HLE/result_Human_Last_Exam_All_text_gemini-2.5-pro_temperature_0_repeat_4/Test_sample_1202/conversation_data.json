    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the *most likely* mechanism responsible for two key outcomes following a gene duplication event in eukaryotes:\n1.  **Retention:** Both copies of the duplicated gene are kept in the genome over evolutionary time, rather than one copy being lost.\n2.  **Divergence:** The two copies accumulate differences in their DNA sequence, leading to them becoming distinct from one another.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Answer Choices**\n\n1.  **A. Gene conversion:**\n    *   **What it is:** A non-reciprocal process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the case of duplicate genes, one copy can act as a template to \"overwrite\" the other.\n    *   **Careful point:** This process causes the two gene copies to become more similar or identical. It actively works *against* divergence. Therefore, it cannot be the primary mechanism for retaining two *divergent* genes.\n\n2.  **B. Pseudogenization:**\n    *   **What it is:** The process where one of the duplicate genes accumulates deleterious mutations (like stop codons or frameshifts) that render it non-functional. The non-functional copy is called a pseudogene.\n    *   **Careful point:** This is the most common fate for a duplicate gene. However, it results in the *loss* of a functional gene, not the *retention* of two functional copies. The question specifically asks for a mechanism of retention.\n\n3.  **C. Neofunctionalization:**\n    *   **What it is:** After duplication, one copy maintains the original, essential function, while the other copy is free from selective pressure. This second copy can then accumulate mutations that lead to a completely new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Careful point:** This mechanism explains both retention (the original copy is kept for its function, and the new copy is kept for its new beneficial function) and divergence (the second copy evolves a new sequence for its new role). This is a valid and important mechanism. However, it relies on the occurrence of a rare beneficial mutation. Until that rare event happens, the duplicate copy is redundant and at high risk of being lost through pseudogenization.\n\n4.  **D. Subfunctionalization:**\n    *   **What it is:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns (e.g., it was active in multiple tissues). After duplication, each copy accumulates different degenerative mutations, causing each to lose a different subset of the original functions.\n    *   **Careful point:** As a result, both copies become essential, as together they are required to perform the full range of the original ancestral gene's functions. This explains retention (both copies are now indispensable) and divergence (they specialize and their sequences change accordingly). This mechanism relies on common loss-of-function mutations, which occur much more frequently than the rare gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization. Because it provides a more immediate and probable pathway to making both copies necessary for survival, it is considered a very likely, if not the most likely, mechanism for preserving duplicate genes.\n\n5.  **E. Adaptive radiation:**\n    *   **What it is:** A macroevolutionary process where a single lineage rapidly diversifies to form many new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche.\n    *   **Careful point:** This is a pattern at the species or lineage level, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level. While gene duplication can provide the genetic novelty that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not the mechanism itself that causes the retention and divergence of individual genes. This option is at the wrong biological scale.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, the question asks for the *most likely* mechanism. Subfunctionalization provides a pathway for preserving both gene copies that relies on common, degenerative mutations. This \"rescues\" the duplicate from being lost much more readily than the neofunctionalization model, which must wait for a rare, beneficial mutation to occur. Therefore, subfunctionalization is often considered the more frequent and probable mechanism for the initial retention of gene duplicates.\n\n<<<D>>>"
