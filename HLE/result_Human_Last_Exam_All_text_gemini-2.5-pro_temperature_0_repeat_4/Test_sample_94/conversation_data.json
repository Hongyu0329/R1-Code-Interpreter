    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key clues.**\nThe question provides several specific pieces of information to identify the physicist:\n1.  **A physicist.**\n2.  **Better known for work in the microscopy field.** This is a major qualifier.\n3.  **Discovered an optical effect.** The discovery is in the field of optics.\n4.  **The effect was observed in real imagery.** This points to phenomena related to lenses or mirrors.\n5.  **It was accidentally observed by a custodial worker (or similar assistant).** This is a very specific and memorable detail of the discovery story.\n6.  **The worker was cleaning concave mirrors.** This pinpoints the exact equipment involved in the accidental observation.\n\n**Step 2: Search for the specific story.**\nThe most distinctive clue is the story of an optical effect being discovered by a custodial worker or lab assistant cleaning a concave mirror. This specific anecdote points directly to the American experimental physicist Robert W. Wood.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the story and the people involved.**\nThe story goes that at Johns Hopkins University, a laboratory assistant named August Herman Pfund (who was not a custodial worker but an assistant who later became a notable physicist himself) was polishing a concave mirror. He was using a sodium flame as a light source to check the mirror's surface. He noticed dark bands in the reflection of the flame. He brought this strange observation to the attention of Robert W. Wood.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the optical effect.**\nRobert W. Wood investigated Pfund's observation. He correctly deduced that the phenomenon was **resonance radiation** (also known as optical resonance). The hot sodium vapor from the lamp itself was absorbing the specific wavelengths of light (the sodium D-lines) emitted by the lamp before the light reached the mirror. This created dark absorption lines in the reflected spectrum.\n\n**Step 5: Connect the physicist to the field of microscopy.**\nThe final step is to confirm that Robert W. Wood is \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\" While Wood was a polymath famous for a vast range of work in optics (including debunking N-rays and pioneering infrared and ultraviolet photography), his contributions to microscopy are indeed significant and well-known.\n*   **UV Microscopy:** He pioneered photography and optics in the ultraviolet spectrum, which is the foundation of ultraviolet microscopy.\n*   **Wood's Lamp:** He invented the \"Wood's lamp,\" an ultraviolet light source that filters out visible light. This lamp became an essential tool in many fields, including fluorescence microscopy, for observing specimens that fluoresce under UV light.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll the clues in the question point to one individual. Robert W. Wood was the physicist who investigated and explained the optical effect of resonance radiation, which was first noticed by his assistant, A. H. Pfund, while polishing a concave mirror. Wood's invention of the Wood's lamp and his work in UV optics make him a major figure in the history of microscopy.\n\n<<<Robert W. Wood>>>"
