    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Object - The Great Icosahedron**\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is composed of 20 large, intersecting triangular faces. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges. A key feature is that its faces self-intersect within the volume of the shape.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the \"Outer-Hull\"**\nThe \"outer-hull\" of a polyhedron is its convex hull. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that encloses all the vertices of the original object. Imagine stretching a rubber sheet over all the vertices of the great icosahedron; the resulting shape is its convex hull.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Convex Hull of the Great Icosahedron**\nThe 12 vertices of the great icosahedron are located at the same positions as the 12 vertices of a standard, convex regular icosahedron. Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. The problem is now simplified to analyzing the surface of a regular icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Understand \"Triangulating the Outer-Hull\"**\nThe question asks for the minimal number of triangles needed to \"triangulate\" the surface of this outer-hull (the regular icosahedron). Triangulation means dividing a surface entirely into non-overlapping triangles. The phrase \"visible triangles from the outside\" confirms that we are only concerned with the surface of this convex hull.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Surface of a Regular Icosahedron**\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid. By definition, its surface is already composed of 20 identical, equilateral triangles. Since the surface is already perfectly divided into triangles, this existing structure represents the most efficient and minimal triangulation possible. No further subdivision is necessary.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the Minimal Number**\nThe surface of the regular icosahedron (which is the outer-hull of the great icosahedron) is composed of 20 triangular faces. This is the minimal number of triangles required to form its surface.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Distinction:** It is crucial not to confuse the 20 self-intersecting faces of the great icosahedron with the 20 faces of its convex hull. The question is about the hull, not the original complex shape.\n*   **Convex Hull:** The core of the problem is identifying that the convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n*   **Minimal Triangulation:** Since the surface of a regular icosahedron is already made of triangles, the minimal number for a triangulation is simply its number of faces. We don't need to subdivide them further.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n1.  The object is the great icosahedron.\n2.  Its outer-hull (convex hull) is a regular icosahedron.\n3.  The task is to find the minimal number of triangles on the surface of a regular icosahedron.\n4.  A regular icosahedron has 20 triangular faces.\n5.  Therefore, the minimal number of triangles is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
