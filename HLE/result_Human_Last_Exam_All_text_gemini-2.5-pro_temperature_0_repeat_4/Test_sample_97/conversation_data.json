    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria.**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, two main reactions occur. First, the solid dissolves to a small extent, and second, the resulting aluminum ion reacts with hydroxide ions to form a soluble complex ion.\n\n1.  **Dissolution Equilibrium:** The solid Al(OH)3 dissolves to form aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    `K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷`\n\n2.  **Complex Formation Equilibrium:** The dissolved aluminum ions (Al³⁺) can react with hydroxide ions (OH⁻) to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    `Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the formation constant, K_f.\n    `K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹`\n\n3.  **Water Autoionization:** We must also consider the autoionization of water, which establishes the relationship between H⁺ and OH⁻.\n    `H₂O(l) <=> H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n    `K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴`\n\n**Step 2: Define Solubility and Relate Species Concentrations.**\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution at equilibrium.\n`S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\nWe can express the concentration of both aluminum species in terms of the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻], using the equilibrium constant expressions.\nFrom the K_sp expression:\n`[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³`\n\nFrom the K_f expression, we can derive an expression for [Al(OH)₄⁻]:\n`[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴`\nSubstituting the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n`[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]`\n\n**Step 3: Use Charge Balance to Find the Equilibrium [OH⁻].**\nThe solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\n`Total Positive Charge = Total Negative Charge`\n`3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [Al(OH)₄⁻] + [OH⁻]`\n\nBecause K_sp is very small and K_f is very large, the concentrations of the aluminum species ([Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻]) will be significantly larger than the concentrations of H⁺ and OH⁻ from water autoionization. This allows for a valid approximation by simplifying the charge balance equation:\n`3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻] from Step 2 into this simplified charge balance equation:\n`3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) ≈ K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]`\n\nWe can cancel K_sp from both sides and rearrange to solve for [OH⁻]:\n`3 / [OH⁻]³ ≈ K_f * [OH⁻]`\n`3 ≈ K_f * [OH⁻]⁴`\n`[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / K_f`\n`[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / (1.1 * 10³¹) = 2.727 * 10⁻³¹`\n`[OH⁻] ≈ (2.727 * 10⁻³¹)^(1/4) ≈ 2.285 * 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Concentrations of the Dissolved Aluminum Species.**\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of hydroxide, we can calculate the concentrations of the two aluminum species.\n`[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 * 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹`\n`[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻] = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 * 10³¹) * (2.285 * 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹`\n\n*Careful Point:* We can check our approximation from Step 3. `3 * [Al³⁺] = 3 * (4.44 * 10⁻⁴) = 1.332 * 10⁻³`. This is extremely close to our calculated `[Al(OH)₄⁻]` of `1.33 * 10⁻³`. Thus, the approximation was valid.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Molar Solubility (S).**\nThe total solubility is the sum of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.\n`S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n`S ≈ (4.44 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 * 10⁻³)`\n`S ≈ 0.000444 + 0.00133`\n`S ≈ 0.001774 mol L⁻¹`\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\n`S ≈ 1.8 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹`\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
