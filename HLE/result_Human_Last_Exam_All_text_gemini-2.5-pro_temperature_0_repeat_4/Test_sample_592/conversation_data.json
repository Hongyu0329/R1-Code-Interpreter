    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the US city Tommaso moves to in the movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the specific US city that the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, moves to in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n\n2.  **Recall or research the plot of *Ovosodo*:** The film follows the life of the protagonist, Piero, growing up in Livorno, Italy. Tommaso is Piero's best and oldest friend.\n\n3.  **Focus on Tommaso's character arc:** Tommaso is portrayed as a rebellious punk who feels stifled by the provincial life in Livorno. As the friends grow up and finish school, their paths diverge.\n\n4.  **Locate the specific plot point of Tommaso's departure:** In the latter part of the movie, Tommaso decides to leave Italy to seek a new life and opportunities. He chooses to emigrate to the United States.\n\n5.  **Identify the destination city:** The film explicitly shows or mentions Tommaso's destination. He sends postcards back to his friend Piero, which reveal that he has moved to San Francisco, California. This city, known for its counter-culture history, is a fitting choice for his punk character.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Character Distinction:** It is important not to confuse Tommaso with the main protagonist, Piero, who remains in Livorno for most of the film. Tommaso is the friend who leaves.\n*   **Source of Information:** The information is derived directly from the narrative of the film itself, primarily through the postcards shown on screen.\n*   **Film Title:** The film is known as *Ovosodo* in Italian and sometimes translated as *Hard Boiled Egg* in English.\n*   **Verification:** Checking plot summaries on reliable film databases (like IMDb) or encyclopedias (like Wikipedia) confirms this detail.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the city.\n\n<<<San Francisco>>>"
