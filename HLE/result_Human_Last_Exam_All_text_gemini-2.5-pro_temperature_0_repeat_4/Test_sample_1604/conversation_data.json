    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe goal is to identify a specific battle. This battle must meet two criteria:\n1.  It was the subject of a painting by the artist Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler.\n2.  Of all the battles she painted, this one occurred most recently in history (i.e., has the latest date).\nIt is crucial to distinguish between the date the painting was created and the date of the historical event it portrays. We are interested in the date of the event.\n\n**Step 2: Compile a List of Lady Butler's Battle Paintings and Their Historical Dates**\nWe need to list Lady Butler's significant military paintings and the dates of the events they depict.\n\n*   **\"Steady the Drums and Fifes\" (painted 1897):** Depicts the Battle of Albuera, which took place on **16 May 1811**.\n*   **\"Scotland for Ever!\" (painted 1881):** Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo, which took place on **18 June 1815**.\n*   **\"The Remnants of an Army\" (painted 1879):** Depicts Dr. William Brydon's arrival at Jalalabad, marking the end of the retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War in **January 1842**.\n*   **\"The Roll Call\" (painted 1874):** Depicts a scene after the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War. The battle occurred on **5 November 1854**.\n*   **\"Balaclava\" (painted 1876):** Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava, which took place on **25 October 1854**.\n*   **\"The Defence of Rorke's Drift\" (painted 1880):** Depicts the Battle of Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War, which occurred on **22â€“23 January 1879**.\n*   **\"Floreat Etona!\" (painted 1882):** Depicts an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War, which took place on **28 January 1881**.\n*   **\"Tel-el-Kebir\" (painted 1885):** Depicts the Battle of Tel El Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War, which occurred on **13 September 1882**.\n*   **\"The Camel Corps\" (painted c. 1890s):** Depicts the Gordon Relief Expedition, which included the Battle of Abu Klea on **17 January 1885**.\n*   **\"The Gate of the Dead, Peking\" (painted 1905):** Depicts the aftermath of the Boxer Rebellion and the Relief of the Legations in Peking in **August 1900**.\n*   **\"Within Sound of the Guns\" (painted 1903):** Depicts a scene from the Second Boer War, which lasted from **1899 to 1902**.\n*   **\"In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards\" (painted 1915):** Depicts the Great Retreat following the Battle of Mons at the beginning of World War I. The battle took place on **23 August 1914**.\n\n**Step 3: Chronologically Order the Battles**\nNow, we arrange the historical events by date to find the latest one.\n\n1.  Battle of Albuera: **1811**\n2.  Battle of Waterloo: **1815**\n3.  Retreat from Kabul: **1842**\n4.  Battle of Balaclava / Inkerman: **1854**\n5.  Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n6.  Battle of Laing's Nek: **1881**\n7.  Battle of Tel El Kebir: **1882**\n8.  Battle of Abu Klea: **1885**\n9.  Relief of Peking (Boxer Rebellion): **1900**\n10. Second Boer War: **1899-1902**\n11. Battle of Mons: **1914**\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Latest Battle**\nBy comparing the dates, the latest historical event depicted by Lady Butler is the Battle of Mons, which occurred in **1914**. This event was portrayed in her painting \"In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards\".\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Painting Date vs. Event Date:** Always focus on the date of the historical event, not when the artwork was completed. For example, \"Scotland for Ever!\" was painted in 1881, but the Battle of Waterloo was in 1815.\n*   **Specificity:** The question asks for a \"battle.\" While some paintings depict broader campaigns (like the Second Boer War or the Boxer Rebellion), the Battle of Mons is a specific, named engagement.\n*   **Comprehensiveness:** It's important to consider Lady Butler's entire career, including her later works, as she continued to paint contemporary military events like World War I.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nThe chronological list clearly shows that 1914 is the latest date among all the historical events painted by Lady Butler. The battle associated with this date is the Battle of Mons.\n\n<<<The Battle of Mons>>>"
