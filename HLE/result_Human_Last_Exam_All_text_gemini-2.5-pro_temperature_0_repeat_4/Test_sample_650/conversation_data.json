    "An analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the main components of the algorithm:**\n    *   **Step 1: Initialization.** This step involves a fixed number of assignments and arithmetic operations (`i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc`).\n    *   **Step 2: The `while` loop.** This is the core of the algorithm. Its running time depends on the number of times the loop executes.\n    *   **Step 3: Return.** This step returns the computed representation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the complexity of each component:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Initialization):** This step performs a constant number of operations, regardless of the size of `n` or `c`. Therefore, its time complexity is constant, which is denoted as **O(1)**.\n    *   **Step 3 (Return):** This step is a single action. Its complexity is also constant, **O(1)**.\n    *   **Step 2 (The `while` loop):** The complexity of a loop is the product of the number of iterations and the complexity of the operations inside the loop body.\n        *   **Complexity of the loop body (Step 2.1):** The operations inside the loop are `i := i + 1`, `x := q`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, and `a_{i} := x — qc`. These are all basic arithmetic operations (increment, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). Assuming these operations take constant time, the complexity of the loop body is **O(1)**.\n        *   **Number of iterations:** We need to determine how many times the loop runs. The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's trace the value of the variable `x` which is updated in each iteration.\n            *   Before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n            *   In the first iteration, `x` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`. Then `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n            *   In the second iteration, `x` becomes `⌊n/c²⌋`. Then `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`.\n            *   In general, after `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n            *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, which is equivalent to `n < c^(k+1)`.\n            *   Taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides gives `log_c(n) < k+1`. The number of iterations, `k`, is roughly `log_c(n)`.\n            *   More formally, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋` (for `n ≥ c`). This is because each iteration effectively computes one digit of the base `c` representation, and the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. The loop runs once for each digit except the last one (`a_0`), so it runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n            *   Therefore, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`. The complexity for the number of iterations is **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n3.  **Combine the complexities:**\n    *   Total Time Complexity = (Complexity of Step 1) + (Number of Iterations) × (Complexity of Loop Body) + (Complexity of Step 3)\n    *   T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) × O(1) + O(1)\n    *   T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(1)\n    *   T(n) = **O(log_c(n))**\n\n4.  **Final Simplification:**\n    *   In Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm does not affect the complexity class if the base is a constant. This is because of the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c ≥ 2` is a constant, `log_b(c)` is also a constant. Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Dominant Operation:** The analysis correctly identifies the `while` loop as the most time-consuming part of the algorithm for large `n`.\n2.  **Cost of Arithmetic:** The analysis assumes a standard computational model (unit-cost RAM) where arithmetic operations on machine-sized integers take constant time (O(1)). If `n` were an arbitrarily large number requiring special multi-precision arithmetic, the cost of division and multiplication would depend on the number of bits in `n`, leading to a higher complexity (typically `O((log n)²)`). However, for standard analysis, the O(1) assumption is conventional.\n3.  **Logarithm Base:** The number of iterations is directly related to `log_c(n)`. It's important to recognize that for the purpose of Big-O notation, this is equivalent to `O(log n)` as constant factors are ignored.\n4.  **Loop Variable:** The loop's continuation depends on `q`. The value of `q` (and `x`) is reduced by a factor of approximately `c` in each step. This multiplicative reduction is the hallmark of a logarithmic time complexity.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The loop executes approximately `log_c(n)` times, and each iteration takes constant time. Therefore, the total time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`. In Big-O notation, the constant base of the logarithm is omitted.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
