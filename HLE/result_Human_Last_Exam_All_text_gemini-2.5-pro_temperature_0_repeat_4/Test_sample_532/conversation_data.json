    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all elements `x, y` in `S` (including the case `x=y`), the product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S ∩ (S ⋅ S) = ∅`.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (Maximal Product-Free Set):** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means for any element `g` in `G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is called a filled group if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to `G`. Let `M(G)` be the collection of all maximal product-free sets in `G`. `G` is filled if `⋃_{S ∈ M(G)} S = G`.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. All finite abelian groups are nilpotent.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the \"Filled Group\" Condition**\n\nLet's analyze the properties of a product-free set `S`.\nLet `e` be the identity element of the group `G`.\nConsider any product-free set `S`.\nIf we assume that `e ∈ S`, then by the definition of a product-free set, for `x=e` and `y=e` (which are in `S`), the product `xy = e ⋅ e = e` must not be in `S`.\nThis is a contradiction: `e` must be in `S` and must not be in `S` simultaneously.\nTherefore, the assumption that `e ∈ S` must be false.\n\nThis means that **the identity element `e` cannot be an element of any product-free set `S`**.\n\nNow, let's consider a filled group `G`.\nBy definition, the union of all its maximal product-free sets must be `G`.\n`⋃_{S ∈ M(G)} S = G`\nSince every maximal product-free set `S` is, by definition, a product-free set, none of these sets can contain the identity element `e`.\nThe union of sets that do not contain `e` cannot contain `e`.\nSo, `e ∉ ⋃_{S ∈ M(G)} S`.\n\nThis implies that `⋃_{S ∈ M(G)} S` is always a subset of `G \\ {e}`.\nFor the union to be equal to `G`, it must contain `e`. This is impossible for any group `G` with more than one element.\n\nWhat if `G` is the trivial group, `G = {e}`?\nThe subsets of `G` are `∅` and `{e}`.\n*   Is `{e}` product-free? No, because `e ⋅ e = e`, and `e` is in the set.\n*   Is `∅` (the empty set) product-free? Yes, the condition \"for all x, y in ∅, xy ∉ ∅\" is vacuously true.\nSo, the only product-free set in `G={e}` is `∅`.\nIs `∅` a maximal product-free set? We check if for any `g ∈ G \\ ∅`, the set `∅ ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n`G \\ ∅ = {e}`. So we check `∅ ∪ {e} = {e}`. As we've seen, `{e}` is not product-free.\nThus, `∅` is the only maximal product-free set in `G={e}`.\nThe collection of maximal product-free sets is `M({e}) = {∅}`.\nThe union is `⋃_{S ∈ M({e})} S = ∅`.\nFor `G={e}` to be a filled group, this union must be equal to `G={e}`. Since `∅ ≠ {e}`, the trivial group is not a filled group.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion of the Analysis**\n\nBased on the standard definitions provided in the problem, no product-free set can contain the identity element. Consequently, the union of all maximal product-free sets is always a subset of `G \\ {e}` and can never be equal to `G`.\n\nThis means that no finite group `G` can be a filled group.\n\n**Careful Points and Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe question asks to find all finite filled nilpotent groups. Our rigorous analysis shows that no such groups exist. This suggests a potential flaw in the problem statement as posed, which is known to happen in mathematical competitions. For instance, if the condition was that the union of maximal product-free sets equals `G \\ {e}`, the answer would be all finite nilpotent groups of odd order. However, based strictly on the question as written, there is only one possible answer.\n\nThe analysis leads to the conclusion that the set of finite filled nilpotent groups is empty.\n\n<<<There are no finite filled nilpotent groups.>>>"
