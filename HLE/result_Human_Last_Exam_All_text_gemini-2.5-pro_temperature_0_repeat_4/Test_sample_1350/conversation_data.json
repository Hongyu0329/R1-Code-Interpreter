    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who meets three criteria:\n1.  The character visited a Roman city.\n2.  The character describes Roman religious practices.\n3.  The description clearly alludes to the myth of Romulus and Remus (twin brothers suckled by a she-wolf who found a city).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and Plot of *The House of the Wolfings***\nThe novel is about a tribe of Goths, the Wolfings, preparing to fight the Romans. Most of the main characters, like the war-leader Thiodolf and his foster-daughter Wood-Sun, are Goths who have not lived among the Romans. We need to find a character who has a backstory involving the Roman Empire.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Character with Roman Experience**\nWithin the story, there is a character known as \"the Thrall.\" A thrall is a slave or serf. This character's backstory reveals that he was captured by the Romans as a child and lived among them for many years before escaping and returning to his people. He is later revealed to be Otter, Thiodolf's long-lost brother. His time spent in the Roman Empire makes him the only character with firsthand knowledge of Roman cities and customs.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the Relevant Scene in the Text**\nIn Chapter V, titled \"The Thrall tells a Tale,\" the Wolfings gather in their great hall and ask the Thrall to tell them about the Romans. He is the expert on the enemy because he has lived with them.\n\n**Step 5: Examine the Thrall's Description of Roman Religion**\nWhen asked about the Romans' gods and their city, the Thrall (Otter) describes their founding myth. He explains that the Romans worship a she-wolf as a goddess. He recounts the story of how the city's founders, two twin brothers, were abandoned as infants but were discovered and suckled by a she-wolf. This allowed them to survive, grow up, and build their great city.\n\n**Step 6: Connect the Description to Romulus and Remus**\nThe story of twin brothers suckled by a she-wolf who go on to found a great city is the famous founding myth of Rome, featuring Romulus and Remus. The Thrall's account is a direct, though unnamed, reference to this legend. The readers of the novel would immediately recognize the myth.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe character who visited a Roman city and describes their religious practices by alluding to Romulus and Remus is the man known for most of the book as **the Thrall**, whose true name is **Otter**.\n\n<<<The Thrall (also known as Otter)>>>"
