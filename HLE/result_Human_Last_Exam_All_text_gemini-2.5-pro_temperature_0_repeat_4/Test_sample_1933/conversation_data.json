    "An analysis of the question step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question and understand the components.**\n\n*   **Schema S:** The schema consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. A unary predicate defines a property of a single element in the universe. In any given model (or database instance), $P_i$ corresponds to a subset of the universe.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$:** This is a fragment of First-Order Logic.\n    *   **FO:** First-Order Logic.\n    *   **[S]:** The formulas are built using the predicates from schema S.\n    *   **Allowed components:**\n        *   Atomic formulas: $P_i(y)$ (where $y$ is a variable).\n        *   Logical connectives: Only conjunction ($\\land$).\n        *   Quantifiers: Only the existential quantifier ($\\exists$).\n        *   Constants: $\\top$ (True) and $\\bot$ (False).\n*   **VC dimension:** The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the expressive power of a class of classifiers. In this context, the \"classifiers\" are the concepts defined by the formulas in our logic fragment. A concept is the set of elements that satisfy a given formula with one free variable.\n    *   A set of points $X = \\{x_1, \\dots, x_d\\}$ is **shattered** by a class of concepts if, for every possible subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there is a concept $C$ in the class such that $C \\cap X = Y$.\n    *   The VC dimension is the size of the largest set $X$ that can be shattered.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the classifiers defined by the logic.**\n\nWe are interested in formulas with one free variable, say $x$, as these are the formulas that classify individual elements. Let's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(x) \\in \\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\nA general formula $\\phi(x)$ can have existential quantifiers over other variables, e.g., $\\exists y_1 \\exists y_2 \\dots \\exists y_k (\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k))$. The part inside the quantifiers, $\\psi$, must be a conjunction of atomic formulas.\n\nLet's simplify such a formula. We can separate the atomic formulas based on the variables they contain.\n$\\phi(x) = \\exists \\vec{y} (\\text{atoms with } x \\land \\text{atoms with only } \\vec{y})$\nUsing the property $\\exists y (A(x) \\land B(y)) \\equiv A(x) \\land \\exists y B(y)$, we can rewrite $\\phi(x)$ as:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\psi(x) \\land \\theta$\nwhere:\n*   $\\psi(x)$ is a conjunction of all atomic formulas involving the free variable $x$. So, $\\psi(x)$ has the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This is a **monomial** over the predicates.\n*   $\\theta$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables) of the form $\\exists \\vec{z} (\\dots)$.\n\nFor any given model (or structure) $M$, the sentence $\\theta$ is either true or false.\n*   If $M \\models \\theta$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\psi(x)$. The concept defined is the set of elements satisfying the monomial $\\psi(x)$.\n*   If $M \\not\\models \\theta$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$ (False). The concept defined is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n\nTherefore, for any given model $M$, the class of concepts definable by our logic is a subset of:\n$\\mathcal{C}_M = \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$\nwhere $P_i^M$ is the interpretation of the predicate $P_i$ in the model $M$. The set $\\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\}$ is the class of concepts definable by monomials over the 4 predicates.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the VC dimension.**\n\nThe VC dimension of the logic is the largest integer $d$ such that there *exists* a model $M$ and a set of points $X$ of size $d$ that can be shattered by the formulas in the logic.\n\n**Lower Bound (Showing VC-dim $\\ge 4$)**\n\nWe need to show that a set of size 4 can be shattered. To do this, we must construct a model $M$ and a set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$ such that every subset of $X$ can be defined by a formula in our logic.\n\n*   Let the universe of our model be $X$.\n*   Define the interpretations of the predicates as follows: $P_i^M = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$ for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$. This means $P_i(x_j)$ is true if and only if $i \\neq j$.\n\nNow, we must show that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find a formula $\\phi_Y(x)$ that selects exactly the elements in $Y$.\nLet $Y$ be an arbitrary subset of $X$. Let $I_Y = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\}$.\nConsider the formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_Y} P_i(x)$. This is a monomial and is part of our allowed logic.\nThe set of elements defined by this formula is:\n$C_Y = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^M = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} (X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}) = X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I_Y} \\{x_i\\} = X \\setminus \\{x_i \\mid i \\in I_Y\\} = Y$.\n\n*   **Example:** To select $Y = \\{x_1, x_3\\}$, we need to exclude $x_2$ and $x_4$. So, $I_Y = \\{2, 4\\}$. The formula is $P_2(x) \\land P_4(x)$. The defined set is $P_2^M \\cap P_4^M = (X \\setminus \\{x_2\\}) \\cap (X \\setminus \\{x_4\\}) = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\} \\cap \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\} = \\{x_1, x_3\\}$. This works.\n*   **Example (Empty Set):** To select $Y = \\emptyset$, we need to exclude all elements. $I_Y = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The formula is $P_1(x) \\land P_2(x) \\land P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$. The defined set is $\\bigcap_{i=1}^4 (X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}) = \\emptyset$.\n*   **Example (Full Set):** To select $Y = X$, we need to exclude no elements. $I_Y = \\emptyset$. The formula is the empty conjunction, which is $\\top$. The defined set is the whole universe $X$.\n\nSince we can construct a formula for every subset of $X$, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Upper Bound (Showing VC-dim $\\le 4$)**\n\nWe need to show that no set of size 5 can be shattered, regardless of the model.\nLet $k=4$ be the number of predicates. We will show that for any model $M$, no set $X$ of size $k+1=5$ can be shattered by the concepts definable in that model.\n\nThe class of concepts definable in any model $M$ is $\\mathcal{C}_M \\subseteq \\{ \\text{monomials on } P_1..P_4 \\} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$. The VC dimension of the class of monomials on $k$ features is known to be $k$. Adding the empty set to a concept class does not increase its VC dimension. Therefore, the VC dimension of $\\mathcal{C}_M$ is at most 4.\n\nLet's sketch the proof for why the VC dimension of $k$-monomials is at most $k$.\n*   Let $X = \\{x_1, \\dots, x_{k+1}\\}$ be any set of $k+1$ points in any model.\n*   For each point $x_j$, we can form a binary vector $v_j \\in \\{0,1\\}^k$ where the $i$-th component is 1 if $P_i(x_j)$ is true, and 0 otherwise.\n*   We now have $k+1$ vectors in the $k$-dimensional vector space over the field of two elements, $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Any set of $k+1$ vectors in a $k$-dimensional space must be linearly dependent.\n*   This means there exists a non-empty subset of indices $J \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, k+1\\}$ such that $\\sum_{j \\in J} v_j = \\vec{0}$ (the zero vector). This means that for any coordinate $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, an even number of vectors $\\{v_j \\mid j \\in J\\}$ have a 1 in that coordinate.\n*   Now, consider the labeling (dichotomy) that assigns label 1 to a point $x_j$ if $j \\in J$ and an odd number of points in $J$ are to be labeled 1, and 0 otherwise. A simpler, provably non-realizable labeling is to pick any $j_0 \\in J$ and try to realize the set $Y = \\{x_j \\mid j \\in J \\setminus \\{j_0\\}\\}$.\n*   Suppose this set $Y$ is realized by a monomial formula $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. This implies that for any $j \\in J \\setminus \\{j_0\\}$, the vector $v_j$ must have 1s in all positions indexed by $I$. It also implies that for $j_0$, the vector $v_{j_0}$ must have a 0 in at least one position indexed by $I$.\n*   This leads to a contradiction with the fact that $\\sum_{j \\in J} v_j = \\vec{0}$. Specifically, for any $i_0 \\in I$ where $v_{j_0}$ has a 0, all other $v_j$ (for $j \\in J$) must have a 1 at position $i_0$. This would mean an odd number of vectors in $\\{v_j \\mid j \\in J\\}$ have a 1 at position $i_0$, contradicting the linear dependence.\n\nSince no set of size 5 can be shattered in any model, the VC dimension of the logic cannot be 5 or greater.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe VC dimension is at least 4 and at most 4. Therefore, the VC dimension is exactly 4."
