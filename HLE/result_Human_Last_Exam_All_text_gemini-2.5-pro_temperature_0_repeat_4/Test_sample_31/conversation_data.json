    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required to identify any PLL case.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe goal is to find the absolute minimum number of side stickers on the last layer that we need to see to be able to distinguish any of the 21 PLL cases from each other and from the solved state. We are looking for the number required in the worst-case scenario, meaning we need to find the most similar pair of cases and determine the minimum number of stickers needed to tell them apart.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Pieces and Stickers\n*   The last layer has 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces.\n*   Each corner piece has 2 non-top-facing (side) stickers.\n*   Each edge piece has 1 non-top-facing (side) sticker.\n*   Total non-top-facing stickers: (4 corners * 2) + (4 edges * 1) = 12 stickers.\n*   The state of the last layer is determined by the permutation (position) of these 8 pieces.\n\n### Step 3: Establish a Lower Bound (Prove that 4 stickers are not enough)\nTo find the minimum number, we first need to establish a lower bound by finding a scenario where a certain number of stickers is insufficient. Let's consider if 4 stickers are enough.\n\n1.  **Consider two similar PLL cases:** The H-perm and the Z-perm.\n    *   **H-perm:** Swaps opposite edges (UF↔UB, UL↔UR). All 4 corners are in their correct positions.\n    *   **Z-perm:** Swaps adjacent edges (UF↔UL, UB↔UR). All 4 corners are in their correct positions.\n\n2.  **Choose a set of 4 stickers to observe.** Let's choose the 4 side-stickers belonging to two adjacent corners, for example, the UFL (Up-Front-Left) and UFR (Up-Front-Right) corners.\n    *   Stickers observed: The front and left stickers of the UFL piece, and the front and right stickers of the UFR piece.\n\n3.  **Analyze the observation.**\n    *   In an H-perm, the UFL and UFR corner pieces are completely solved. The 4 stickers we observe will show the colors of a solved cube.\n    *   In a Z-perm, the UFL and UFR corner pieces are also completely solved. The 4 stickers we observe will also show the colors of a solved cube.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for the lower bound.** Since the H-perm and Z-perm are indistinguishable when looking at these 4 stickers, 4 stickers are not sufficient in all cases. Therefore, the minimum number required must be greater than 4.\n    *   **Minimum number must be at least 5.**\n\n### Step 4: Establish an Upper Bound (Prove that 5 stickers are sufficient)\nNow we need to show that 5 stickers are always enough to identify any case. To do this, we must propose a set of 5 stickers that can be used to uniquely identify every single PLL case.\n\n1.  **Choose a set of 5 stickers to observe.** Let's choose a set that allows us to identify the pieces in three specific locations on one face.\n    *   The 2 side-stickers of the **UFL corner**.\n    *   The 2 side-stickers of the **UFR corner**.\n    *   The 1 side-sticker of the **UF edge**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the information gained.**\n    *   Seeing the 2 side-stickers of a corner piece (e.g., UFL) allows you to uniquely identify which of the four last-layer corner pieces is currently in that UFL position.\n    *   Seeing the 1 side-sticker of an edge piece (e.g., UF) allows you to uniquely identify which of the four last-layer edge pieces is currently in that UF position.\n    *   Therefore, our chosen set of 5 stickers tells us exactly which pieces are in the UFL, UFR, and UF positions.\n\n3.  **Prove sufficiency.** Let's assume for the sake of contradiction that two different PLL cases, P1 and P2, are indistinguishable using these 5 stickers.\n    *   This would mean that for both P1 and P2, the same corner piece is in the UFL slot, the same corner piece is in the UFR slot, and the same edge piece is in the UF slot.\n    *   If this were true, the permutation `P2 * P1_inverse` would have to be a valid PLL algorithm that leaves the pieces in the UFL, UFR, and UF slots unchanged (it would fix these three pieces).\n    *   However, if you examine the 21 standard PLL algorithms, you will find that **no non-identity PLL fixes all three of these pieces simultaneously**. For example, the T-perm fixes the UFL and UFR corners but moves the UF edge. The Ra-perm fixes the UFL and UF pieces but moves the UFR corner.\n    *   Since no two distinct PLLs result in the same three pieces occupying these three slots, identifying these three pieces is enough to uniquely determine the PLL case.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for the upper bound.** The 5 specified stickers are sufficient to distinguish any PLL case from all others. Therefore, the minimum number required is no more than 5.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n*   From Step 3, we established that the minimum number of stickers required is at least 5.\n*   From Step 4, we established that the minimum number of stickers required is at most 5.\n\nCombining these two points, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case is exactly 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
