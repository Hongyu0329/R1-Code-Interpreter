    "This problem asks for the size of the smallest algebraic structure that can be used to color the figure-eight knot. To solve this, we need to understand the principles of knot coloring.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand Knot Coloring and the Algebraic Structure**\n\nKnot coloring is a method of assigning a label, called a \"color\", to each arc of a knot diagram. These colors are elements of an algebraic structure, and the assignment must follow a specific rule at each crossing.\n\n*   **The Algebraic Structure:** The most common structure used for knot coloring is the set of integers modulo `n`, denoted as `Z_n = {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}`. The size, or number of elements, of this structure is `n`.\n*   **The Coloring Rule (Fox n-coloring):** At every crossing in the knot diagram, there is one over-arc and two under-arcs. If the color of the over-arc is `c`, and the colors of the two under-arcs are `a` and `b`, the following congruence must hold:\n    `a + b ≡ 2c (mod n)`\n*   **Trivial vs. Non-trivial Coloring:** A coloring is considered \"trivial\" if all arcs are assigned the same color. This is always possible for any knot and any `n`. We are interested in \"non-trivial\" colorings, where at least two different colors are used. The question implicitly asks for the smallest structure that allows for a non-trivial coloring.\n\n**Step 2: The Condition for Non-trivial Colorability**\n\nA fundamental result in knot theory provides a simple way to determine if a knot can be non-trivially colored with `n` colors.\n\n*   **Knot Determinant:** Every knot has an associated integer invariant called the **determinant**, denoted `det(K)`.\n*   **Colorability Theorem:** A knot `K` has a non-trivial `n`-coloring if and only if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and the knot's determinant is greater than 1.\n    `gcd(n, det(K)) > 1`\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the determinant of the figure-eight knot and then find the smallest integer `n > 1` that satisfies this condition.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Determinant of the Figure-Eight Knot**\n\nThe determinant can be calculated from a system of linear equations derived from the coloring rule.\n\n1.  **Draw and Label the Diagram:** We use a standard diagram of the figure-eight knot (also known as knot 4₁), which has 4 arcs and 4 crossings. Let's label the arcs `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, and `x₄`.\n\n     \n\n2.  **Write the Equations:** We apply the rule `a + b = 2c` at each crossing.\n    *   At crossing C₁: `x₂` is over; `x₁` and `x₃` are under.  Equation: `x₁ + x₃ ≡ 2x₂ (mod n)`\n    *   At crossing C₂: `x₁` is over; `x₃` and `x₄` are under.  Equation: `x₃ + x₄ ≡ 2x₁ (mod n)`\n    *   At crossing C₃: `x₄` is over; `x₁` and `x₂` are under.  Equation: `x₁ + x₂ ≡ 2x₄ (mod n)`\n    *   At crossing C₄: `x₃` is over; `x₂` and `x₄` are under.  Equation: `x₂ + x₄ ≡ 2x₃ (mod n)`\n\n3.  **Form the Coloring Matrix:** We can rewrite these equations as a homogeneous system `M * x = 0`.\n    *   `x₁ - 2x₂ + x₃ = 0`\n    *   `-2x₁ + x₃ + x₄ = 0`\n    *   `x₁ + x₂ - 2x₄ = 0`\n    *   `x₂ - 2x₃ + x₄ = 0`\n\n    The coefficient matrix `M` is:\n    ```\n    [  1  -2   1   0 ]\n    [ -2   0   1   1 ]\n    [  1   1   0  -2 ]\n    [  0   1  -2   1 ]\n    ```\n\n4.  **Calculate the Determinant:** The determinant of the knot is the absolute value of the determinant of any `(k-1)x(k-1)` submatrix of the `k x k` coloring matrix. Here, `k=4`. Let's delete the last row and column.\n    `M' = [  1  -2   1 ]`\n    `     [ -2   0   1 ]`\n    `     [  1   1   0 ]`\n\n    `det(M') = 1 * (0*0 - 1*1) - (-2) * ((-2)*0 - 1*1) + 1 * ((-2)*1 - 0*1)`\n    `det(M') = 1 * (-1) - (-2) * (-1) + 1 * (-2)`\n    `det(M') = -1 - 2 - 2 = -5`\n\n    The determinant of the figure-eight knot is `det(4₁) = |det(M')| = |-5| = 5`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Smallest Number of Elements `n`**\n\nNow we need to find the smallest integer `n > 1` such that `gcd(n, 5) > 1`.\n\n*   The number 5 is a prime number. Its only divisors are 1 and 5.\n*   For `gcd(n, 5)` to be greater than 1, `n` must share a factor with 5 other than 1. This means `n` must be a multiple of 5.\n*   We are looking for the smallest such `n` that is greater than 1.\n*   Let's test values of `n`:\n    *   `n=2`: `gcd(2, 5) = 1`. No non-trivial coloring.\n    *   `n=3`: `gcd(3, 5) = 1`. No non-trivial coloring.\n    *   `n=4`: `gcd(4, 5) = 1`. No non-trivial coloring.\n    *   `n=5`: `gcd(5, 5) = 5`. Since `5 > 1`, a non-trivial coloring exists.\n\nThe smallest integer `n > 1` that allows for a non-trivial coloring is 5.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smallest algebraic structure that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot is `Z₅`. The number of elements in this structure is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
