The two problems the JTB definition of knowledge runs into under the specified constraints are:

1.  **The Regress of Justification leads to Circularity or an Inadequate Foundation:** For a belief to be justified, it must be based on other beliefs or evidence. Given the only epistemic states are Knowledge or Belief, a dilemma arises. If the justification is based on a mere 'Belief', the foundation is too weak to create knowledge. If the justification must be based on 'Knowledge', the definition of knowledge becomes circular (i.e., to know something, you must already know something else).

2.  **The Inability to Distinguish Between Justified and Unjustified Non-Knowledge:** The framework cannot properly classify a Justified False Belief. Since this state is not Knowledge (because it's false), it must be categorized as a mere 'Belief'. This lumps it into the same category as completely unjustified or irrational beliefs, failing to capture the important epistemic difference between a rational mistake and an irrational guess.
