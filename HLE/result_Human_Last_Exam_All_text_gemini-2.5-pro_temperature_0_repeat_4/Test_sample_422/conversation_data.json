    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and its Premises**\n\n*   **Core Theory:** The question is based on the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge. According to this definition, for an agent S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  **T (Truth):** The proposition P must be true.\n    2.  **B (Belief):** The agent S must believe that P is true.\n    3.  **J (Justification):** The agent S must be justified in believing P.\n*   **Core Constraint:** The most important part of the question is the constraint that the *only available epistemic states* are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. This means any mental state an agent has concerning a proposition must be categorized as one of these two. There is no intermediate state like \"justified belief\" as a standalone category.\n*   **Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems describe scenarios where a person has a justified true belief that still doesn't seem to be knowledge, typically because the justification is flawed or lucky. We must find other problems.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Problem - The Regress of Justification**\n\nThe JTB theory hinges on the \"Justification\" condition. We must ask: what counts as a valid justification?\n\n1.  **The Nature of Justification:** Justification for a belief (let's call it P1) is typically based on other beliefs or evidence (let's call the justifying belief P2). For example, your justification for believing \"it is raining\" (P1) might be your belief that \"the ground outside is wet\" (P2).\n2.  **The Justification Chain:** For P2 to be a *good* justification for P1, what must be your epistemic state regarding P2? This is where the constraint becomes critical. Your state regarding P2 can only be \"Knowledge\" or \"Belief\".\n3.  **The Dilemma:**\n    *   **Option A: The justification is a 'Belief'.** If your justification for P1 is merely a *belief* in P2, the foundation is weak. A mere belief can be unjustified, irrational, or false. An unjustified belief cannot provide the strong support needed to turn another true belief into knowledge.\n    *   **Option B: The justification is 'Knowledge'.** If your justification for P1 must be *knowledge* of P2, then the definition of knowledge becomes circular. The definition would be: \"To have knowledge of P1, you must have knowledge of P2\". This doesn't explain what knowledge is; it just defines it in terms of itself.\n4.  **Conclusion for Problem 1:** The constraint forces the JTB theory into an inescapable dilemma. Justification must either be founded on mere 'belief' (making it too weak) or on 'knowledge' (making the entire definition circular). This is a version of the classic epistemic regress problem, made particularly sharp by the limited state options.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Problem - The Classification of Non-Knowledge States**\n\nThe JTB theory analyzes knowledge by breaking it down into components (J, T, B). This naturally creates other possible combinations of these components. Let's consider a state that is not knowledge.\n\n1.  **The Case of Justified False Belief:** An agent can have a belief that is well-justified but happens to be false. For example, you look at a very reliable clock that has always been accurate, and it reads 3:00. You form the justified belief that it is 3:00. However, unbeknownst to you, the clock stopped exactly 12 hours ago. Your belief is justified (J) and it is a belief (B), but it is false (not T).\n2.  **Applying the Constraint:** What is the epistemic state of this agent? According to the rules, the only options are \"Knowledge\" or \"Belief\".\n    *   It cannot be \"Knowledge\" because the belief is false (the 'T' condition fails).\n    *   Therefore, it must be categorized simply as \"Belief\".\n3.  **The Issue with this Classification:** This categorization is problematic because it lumps a **Justified False Belief** into the exact same category as an **Unjustified Belief** (e.g., a wild guess, a superstition, or a delusion). Epistemically, a belief based on strong evidence that turns out to be wrong is very different from a belief with no rational basis at all. The former is a rational error, while the latter is irrational.\n4.  **Conclusion for Problem 2:** The framework, with its limited states, loses the ability to make a crucial epistemic distinction. It cannot differentiate between a well-reasoned belief that is not knowledge (because it's false) and a completely unreasoned belief. The value and status of \"justification\" are lost whenever a belief is not also true.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<\nThe two problems the JTB definition of knowledge runs into under the specified constraints are:\n\n1.  **The Regress of Justification leads to Circularity or an Inadequate Foundation:** For a belief to be justified, it must be based on other beliefs or evidence. Given the only epistemic states are Knowledge or Belief, a dilemma arises. If the justification is based on a mere 'Belief', the foundation is too weak to create knowledge. If the justification must be based on 'Knowledge', the definition of knowledge becomes circular (i.e., to know something, you must already know something else).\n\n2.  **The Inability to Distinguish Between Justified and Unjustified Non-Knowledge:** The framework cannot properly classify a Justified False Belief. Since this state is not Knowledge (because it's false), it must be categorized as a mere 'Belief'. This lumps it into the same category as completely unjustified or irrational beliefs, failing to capture the important epistemic difference between a rational mistake and an irrational guess.\n>>>"
