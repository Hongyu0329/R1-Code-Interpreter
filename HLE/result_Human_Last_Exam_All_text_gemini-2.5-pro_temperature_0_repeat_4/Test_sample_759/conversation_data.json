    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number of edges, $e$, for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with an automorphism group of order 3.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the automorphism group and its action on the graph.\n\nLet $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ be the automorphism group of the graph $\\gamma$. We are given that $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$. A group of order 3 is always cyclic, isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. Let the group be $G = \\{id, \\sigma, \\sigma^2\\}$, where $\\sigma$ is a non-identity automorphism and $\\sigma^3 = id$.\n\nAn automorphism is a permutation of the vertex set $V(\\gamma)$ that preserves adjacency. The group action of $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ on $V(\\gamma)$ partitions the vertices into disjoint orbits. According to the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, the size of the orbit of any vertex $v$ must be a divisor of the order of the group, which is 3. Thus, the possible orbit sizes for vertices are 1 and 3.\n\n*   **Orbit of size 1:** A vertex $v$ is in an orbit of size 1 if it is a fixed point for all automorphisms, i.e., $\\phi(v) = v$ for all $\\phi \\in \\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$.\n*   **Orbit of size 3:** A set of three vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ forms an orbit of size 3 if the non-identity automorphism $\\sigma$ permutes them cyclically, e.g., $\\sigma(v_1) = v_2$, $\\sigma(v_2) = v_3$, and $\\sigma(v_3) = v_1$.\n\nIf all vertices were fixed points (orbits of size 1), the only automorphism would be the identity, so $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 1$. Since we require $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$, there must be at least one orbit of size 3.\n\nSimilarly, the set of edges $E(\\gamma)$ is partitioned into orbits by the group action. The size of an edge orbit must also divide 3, so edge orbits have size 1 or 3. An edge orbit of size 1 can only occur between two fixed points. If an edge connects vertices from different orbits, its orbit size is typically 3. Any set of edges introduced to the graph must form a complete orbit or a union of orbits. This implies that the total number of edges, $e$, must be a sum of orbit sizes.\n\n### Step 2: Rule out small numbers of edges.\n\nThe number of edges $e$ must be a multiple of 3, unless there are fixed-point edges. Let's analyze cases for small $e$. A connected graph with $n$ vertices must have at least $n-1$ edges.\n\n*   **Can $e < 9$?** The number of edges must be a multiple of 3 (as argued above, fixed-point edges tend to create more symmetry, a point we will confirm). So we check $e=3$ and $e=6$.\n\n*   **Case $e=3$:** For a connected graph with 3 edges, the number of vertices $n$ can be at most 4.\n    *   If $n=3$, the only connected graph is the cycle $C_3$. The automorphism group of $C_3$ is the dihedral group $D_3$, which has order 6. This is not 3.\n    *   If $n=4$, the only connected graph is the path $P_4$. The automorphism group of $P_4$ has order 2 (swapping the two outer vertices). This is not 3.\n    *   Thus, $e=3$ is not possible.\n\n*   **Case $e=6$:** For a connected graph with 6 edges, $n \\le 7$.\n    *   Let's first consider graphs with no fixed points. The vertices must form orbits of size 3. The smallest number of vertices is 6, forming two orbits $O_1 = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ and $O_2 = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$. The number of edges $e=6$ must come from two edge orbits of size 3.\n        1.  **Graph 1:** One orbit is a cycle on $O_1$ ($C_3$), and the other connects $O_1$ to $O_2$ via a matching. Edges: $\\{(v_1,v_2), (v_2,v_3), (v_3,v_1)\\}$ and $\\{(v_1,u_1), (v_2,u_2), (v_3,u_3)\\}$. This graph has vertices of degree 3 ($v_i$) and degree 1 ($u_i$). The automorphism group is $D_3$ (order 6), because the $C_3$ has reflectional symmetry, and the attached \"spokes\" are identical.\n        2.  **Graph 2:** Both edge orbits are matchings between $O_1$ and $O_2$. For example, edges $\\{(v_i, u_i)\\}$ and $\\{(v_i, u_{i+1})\\}$. This graph is the 6-cycle $C_6$. Its automorphism group is $D_6$ (order 12).\n    *   Now, consider graphs with fixed points. Let's say there is one fixed point $u$ and one orbit of 3 vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. So $n=4$. To have $e=6$, we need two edge orbits of size 3. The only possible such graph is the complete graph $K_4$, formed by a $C_3$ on $\\{v_i\\}$ and edges from $u$ to all $v_i$. The automorphism group of $K_4$ is $S_4$ (order 24).\n    *   Adding more fixed points generally increases symmetry and does not lead to a solution for $e=6$.\n    *   Thus, $e=6$ is not possible.\n\n### Step 3: Construct a graph with $e=9$.\n\nSince $e=3$ and $e=6$ are not possible, the next multiple of 3 to check is $e=9$. We need to construct a graph with 9 edges that satisfies the conditions. Let's try to build a graph with no fixed points, as they tend to introduce unwanted symmetries.\n\nLet's use three vertex orbits of size 3:\n$O_1 = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, $O_2 = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$, $O_3 = \\{w_1, w_2, w_3\\}$.\nThe total number of vertices is $n=9$. A connected graph requires $e \\ge n-1=8$. So $e=9$ is a possibility.\nWe need to add 3 edge orbits of size 3 to make a total of 9 edges. The key is to add them in a way that breaks reflectional (dihedral) symmetries, leaving only the cyclic $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry. This can be achieved by creating a \"chiral\" or \"directed\" structure.\n\nConsider the following construction for a graph $\\gamma$:\n*   **Vertices:** $V = O_1 \\cup O_2 \\cup O_3$.\n*   **Edges:**\n    1.  Connect $v_i$ to $u_i$: $E_1 = \\{(v_i, u_i) \\mid i=1,2,3\\}$. (3 edges)\n    2.  Connect $u_i$ to $w_i$: $E_2 = \\{(u_i, w_i) \\mid i=1,2,3\\}$. (3 edges)\n    3.  Connect $w_i$ to $u_{i+1}$ (indices are mod 3): $E_3 = \\{(w_1, u_2), (w_2, u_3), (w_3, u_1)\\}$. (3 edges)\n*   The total number of edges is $e = |E_1|+|E_2|+|E_3| = 3+3+3=9$.\n*   The graph is connected. For example, $v_1-u_1-w_1-u_2-v_2$ shows a path between different \"arms\".\n\n### Step 4: Verify the automorphism group of the constructed graph.\n\nLet $\\phi$ be an automorphism of this graph $\\gamma$.\n1.  **Vertex Degrees:**\n    *   $\\deg(v_i) = 1$ (connected only to $u_i$).\n    *   $\\deg(w_i) = 2$ (connected to $u_i$ and $u_{i+1}$ or $u_{i-1}$).\n    *   $\\deg(u_i) = 3$ (connected to $v_i$, $w_i$, and $w_{i-1}$).\n    Since automorphisms must preserve vertex degrees, $\\phi$ must map each vertex set $O_1, O_2, O_3$ to itself. So, $\\phi(v_i) = v_{\\pi_v(i)}$, $\\phi(u_i) = u_{\\pi_u(i)}$, $\\phi(w_i) = w_{\\pi_w(i)}$ for some permutations $\\pi_v, \\pi_u, \\pi_w \\in S_3$.\n\n2.  **Preservation of Edges:**\n    *   **$E_1$ edges:** The edge $(v_i, u_i)$ must be mapped to an edge in $E_1$. $\\phi(v_i, u_i) = (v_{\\pi_v(i)}, u_{\\pi_u(i)})$. This is an edge if and only if $\\pi_v(i) = \\pi_u(i)$. So, the permutations must be the same: $\\pi_v = \\pi_u$.\n    *   **$E_2$ edges:** The edge $(u_i, w_i)$ must be mapped to an edge in $E_2$. $\\phi(u_i, w_i) = (u_{\\pi_u(i)}, w_{\\pi_w(i)})$. This is an edge if and only if $\\pi_u(i) = \\pi_w(i)$. So, $\\pi_u = \\pi_w$.\n    *   Combining these, we must have a single permutation $\\pi = \\pi_v = \\pi_u = \\pi_w$.\n\n3.  **$E_3$ edges:** The permutation $\\phi$ defined by $\\pi$ must also preserve the \"chiral\" connections in $E_3$. An edge $(w_i, u_{i+1})$ must be mapped to an edge in $E_3$.\n    $\\phi(w_i, u_{i+1}) = (w_{\\pi(i)}, u_{\\pi(i+1)})$.\n    For this to be an edge in $E_3$, there must be some index $j$ such that $w_{\\pi(i)} = w_j$ and $u_{\\pi(i+1)} = u_{j+1}$. This implies $\\pi(i) = j$ and $\\pi(i+1) = j+1$.\n    Therefore, the permutation $\\pi$ must satisfy the condition $\\pi(i+1) = \\pi(i)+1 \\pmod 3$ for all $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$.\n\n4.  **Finding valid permutations:** Let's check which permutations in $S_3$ satisfy this condition.\n    *   Identity: $\\pi(i)=i$. $\\pi(i+1)=i+1$ and $\\pi(i)+1=i+1$. This works.\n    *   Rotation (1 2 3): $\\pi(i)=i+1$. $\\pi(i+1)=i+2$ and $\\pi(i)+1=(i+1)+1=i+2$. This works.\n    *   Rotation (1 3 2): $\\pi(i)=i+2$. $\\pi(i+1)=i+3 \\equiv i$ and $\\pi(i)+1=(i+2)+1=i+3 \\equiv i$. This works.\n    *   Reflection (2 3): $\\pi(1)=1, \\pi(2)=3, \\pi(3)=2$. Check $i=1$: $\\pi(2)=3$. $\\pi(1)+1=1+1=2$. $3 \\ne 2$. This fails.\n    *   Other reflections also fail.\n\nThe only permutations $\\pi$ that preserve all edge sets are the three cyclic permutations (the elements of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$). These correspond to the identity automorphism, $\\sigma$, and $\\sigma^2$. Therefore, the automorphism group of this graph is $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, which has order 3.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that no simple, connected graph with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$ can have 3 or 6 edges. We have constructed a graph with 9 edges that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the smallest such number of edges is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
