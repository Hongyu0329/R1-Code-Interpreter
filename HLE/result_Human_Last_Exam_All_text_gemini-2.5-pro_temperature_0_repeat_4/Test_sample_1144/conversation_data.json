    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum ($\\Delta p$) to its actual momentum ($p$) for an electron in the first Bohr orbit. This ratio is represented as $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n2.  **Identify the Given Information:**\n    *   The electron is in the **first Bohr orbit**, which means the principal quantum number is $n=1$.\n    *   The uncertainty in the electron's position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n3.  **Identify the Necessary Physical Principles:**\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) to the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$). We will use the minimal uncertainty relation: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n    *   **Bohr Model:** This model is used to determine the momentum ($p$) of the electron in the first orbit. The key postulate is the quantization of angular momentum: $L = n\\hbar$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Unit Consistency:** The position uncertainty is given in picometers (pm). It must be converted to SI units (meters) to be consistent with the Bohr radius. ($1 \\text{ pm} = 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$).\n*   **Minimum Uncertainty:** The uncertainty principle is an inequality ($\\ge$). The problem implies finding the ratio under the condition of minimum possible uncertainty, so we use the equality $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n*   **Momentum Calculation:** The momentum ($p$) is the linear momentum of the electron, which can be derived from the Bohr model's quantization of angular momentum ($L = r \\cdot p$).\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** It is often easier and less error-prone to simplify the expression for the ratio algebraically before substituting numerical values.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Express the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$).**\nAccording to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step 2: Express the momentum ($p$) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.**\nIn the Bohr model, the angular momentum ($L$) is quantized:\n$L = n\\hbar$\nFor the first orbit, $n=1$, so the angular momentum is $L = \\hbar$.\nAngular momentum is also defined as $L = r \\cdot p$, where $r$ is the orbital radius and $p$ is the linear momentum. For the first orbit, this is $L = r_1 \\cdot p$, where $r_1$ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit (also known as the Bohr radius, $a_0$).\nBy equating the two expressions for $L$, we get:\n$r_1 \\cdot p = \\hbar$\nSolving for the linear momentum $p$:\n$p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n\n**Step 3: Form the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$ and simplify.**\nNow, we can find the desired ratio by dividing the expression from Step 1 by the expression from Step 2:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}\\right)}$\nThe reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$, cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{1}{2 \\Delta x} \\cdot \\frac{r_1}{1} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the known values and calculate the final answer.**\nThe values we need are:\n*   The radius of the first Bohr orbit, $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   The given uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\nNow, substitute these values into the simplified ratio:\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29}{2}$\n$\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
