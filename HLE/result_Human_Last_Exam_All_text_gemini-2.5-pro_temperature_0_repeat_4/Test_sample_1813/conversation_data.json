    "An analysis of the question involves several steps to understand the concepts and compute the result.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the terminology.**\nThe question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\)\". This requires understanding two concepts:\n1.  **Generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\)**: This is an extension of the classical Markov numbers (1, 2, 5, 13, ...) which are integers. The generalization associates a number (or a set of numbers) to any rational number \\( p/q \\). There are several non-equivalent definitions in the literature.\n2.  **Associated continued fraction**: In the classical theory, each Markov number \\( m \\) is associated with a class of quadratic irrational numbers, which have a specific periodic continued fraction. For example, the Markov number 5 is associated with the continued fraction \\( [0; \\overline{2,2,1,1}] \\). The question implies a similar association exists in the generalized theory.\n\nThe phrasing \"associated with\" suggests that we are not simply computing the continued fraction of the number \\( m_{4/7} \\) itself (which is a rational number and thus has a finite continued fraction), but rather finding a periodic continued fraction that is canonically constructed from the rational number \\( 4/7 \\) in the context of the theory of generalized Markov numbers.\n\n**Step 2: Find the continued fraction of the given rational number.**\nFirst, we need to express the rational number \\( 4/7 \\) as a continued fraction.\n\\( \\frac{4}{7} = 0 + \\frac{4}{7} = 0 + \\frac{1}{7/4} \\)\n\\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} = 1 + \\frac{1}{4/3} \\)\n\\( \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\)\nCombining these, we get:\n\\( \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\)\nThis gives us the sequence of partial quotients (the \"word\") \\( w = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n\n**Step 3: Understand the association between the rational number and the periodic continued fraction.**\nThe classical Markov numbers are associated with periodic continued fractions of the form \\( [0; \\overline{a_1, \\dots, a_k}] \\) where the block of quotients \\( (a_1, \\dots, a_k) \\) is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).\nA natural way to generalize this is to take a rational number \\( p/q = [0; w] \\) where \\( w = (a_1, \\dots, a_n) \\) is not necessarily a palindrome, and construct an associated periodic continued fraction whose period *is* a palindrome.\nA standard construction in this field is to form a new word by concatenating \\( w \\) with its reverse, \\( w^T \\).\nLet \\( w = (a_1, \\dots, a_n) \\). Its reverse is \\( w^T = (a_n, \\dots, a_1) \\).\nThe new word is \\( W = (w, w^T) = (a_1, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_1) \\). This new word \\( W \\) is always a palindrome.\nThe \"associated continued fraction\" is then defined as \\( [0; \\overline{W}] \\). This construction provides a canonical mapping from any rational number to a quadratic irrationality with a palindromic period in its continued fraction, thereby generalizing the classical case.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the construction to \\( 4/7 \\).**\n1.  From Step 2, the word for \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( w = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n2.  The reverse of this word is \\( w^T = (3, 1, 1) \\).\n3.  Concatenate \\( w \\) and \\( w^T \\) to get the new palindromic word:\n    \\( W = (w, w^T) = (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\).\n4.  The associated continued fraction is \\( [0; \\overline{W}] \\).\n\nTherefore, the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is \\( [0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}] \\).\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n*   Rational number: \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\)\n*   Continued fraction of the rational number: \\( \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\). This gives the sequence \\( w = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n*   Reverse of the sequence: \\( w^T = (3, 1, 1) \\).\n*   The associated periodic continued fraction is formed by creating a palindromic period from \\( w \\) and \\( w^T \\): \\( [0; \\overline{w, w^T}] \\).\n*   Final result: \\( [0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}] \\).\n\n>>> \\( [0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}] \\)"
