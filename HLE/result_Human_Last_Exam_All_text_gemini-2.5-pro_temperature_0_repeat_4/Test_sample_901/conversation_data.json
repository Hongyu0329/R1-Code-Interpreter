    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The bromine (Br) is a good leaving group.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol. This is a polar protic solvent, often used with its conjugate base (tert-butoxide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. SN2 is disfavored due to the bulky base, and E1/SN1 are disfavored because the base is strong, not weak.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\n*   The E2 reaction is a concerted (one-step) process that has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Br) and the proton (H) being eliminated must be in an **anti-periplanar** orientation.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this anti-periplanar arrangement means the leaving group and the proton must be **trans-diaxial** (one axial-up, the other axial-down on an adjacent carbon).\n\n**Step 3: Draw the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\n*   To determine the outcome, we must draw the chair conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and see which one can undergo the E2 reaction. A substituent is more stable in the equatorial position to minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions). The A-value (a measure of this strain) for a methyl group (~1.7 kcal/mol) is much larger than that for a bromine atom (~0.5 kcal/mol). Therefore, the conformation with the methyl group in the equatorial position will be the more stable and major conformer.\n\n*   **Conformation A (More Stable):** Methyl group is equatorial, Bromine is axial.\n    *   Let's place the methyl group at C2 in the equatorial position.\n    *   This forces the bromine at C1 to be in the axial position.\n    *   (This conformation corresponds to the (1S,2R) stereoisomer, as confirmed by Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules).\n\n*   **Conformation B (Less Stable):** Methyl group is axial, Bromine is equatorial.\n    *   This is the result of a chair flip from Conformation A. It is higher in energy and exists in a lower concentration at equilibrium.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Reactive Conformation for E2 Elimination**\n*   The E2 reaction can only proceed from a conformation where the leaving group (Br) is **axial**. Therefore, we must analyze **Conformation A**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Conformation A (axial Br, equatorial Me):**\n    *   The leaving group, Br, is at C1 and is in an **axial** position.\n    *   We need to find a β-proton (a proton on a carbon adjacent to C1, i.e., C2 or C6) that is also axial and trans to the Br.\n    *   **β-proton at C2:** The methyl group is equatorial. This means the hydrogen on C2 is **axial**. However, if the Br at C1 is axial-up, the H at C2 is also axial-up. They are *syn-periplanar*, not anti-periplanar. **Elimination cannot occur towards C2.**\n    *   **β-proton at C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is equatorial, and one is **axial**. If the Br at C1 is axial-up, the axial H at C6 is axial-down. They are **trans-diaxial** and perfectly aligned for E2 elimination.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Product**\n*   Since the only available anti-periplanar β-proton is on C6, the base (tert-butoxide) will abstract this proton.\n*   Simultaneously, the C-H bond electrons will form a double bond between C1 and C6, and the C-Br bond will break, expelling the bromide ion.\n*   The resulting product has a double bond between C1 and C6, and the methyl group remains at C2.\n*   When naming this product according to IUPAC rules, the double bond is given the lowest possible numbers (C1 and C2). Therefore, the original C1 is now C1, the original C6 is now C2, and the original C2 (with the methyl group) is now C3.\n*   The name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction is highly regioselective due to the strict stereochemical requirements of the E2 mechanism. Although the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene) is the more substituted and typically more stable alkene, it cannot be formed because there is no β-proton at C2 in the required anti-periplanar orientation. The reaction is forced to form the less substituted Hofmann-like product, 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
