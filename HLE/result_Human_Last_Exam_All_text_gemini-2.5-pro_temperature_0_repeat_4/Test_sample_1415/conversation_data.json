    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions**\n\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined recursively:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integrand**\n\nThe question asks to evaluate the definite integral:\n`V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\n\nThe integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is a classic form. If we let `u = F₃(x)`, then `du = F₃'(x) dx`. The integral becomes `∫ (1/u) du`.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the indefinite integral**\n\nThe indefinite integral of `u'/u` is `ln|u|`.\nTherefore, `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = ln|F₃(x)| + C`.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n\nTo evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]_0^1 = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n\nFirst, let's calculate `F₃(0)`:\n*   `F₀(0) = 0`\n*   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n*   `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\nNext, let's calculate `F₃(1)`:\n*   `F₀(1) = 1`\n*   `F₁(1) = sin(1)` (Note: the argument of sin is in radians)\n*   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the values back into the integral expression**\n\nNow we substitute `F₃(0)` and `F₃(1)` into the expression for `V`:\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)| = ln|ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))| - ln|ln(2)|`\n\n**Careful Point:** We need to check if the arguments of the logarithms are positive.\n*   For any real `x`, `sin(x)` is between -1 and 1.\n*   `e^(sin(x))` is always positive.\n*   `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than 1.\n*   Therefore, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always greater than `ln(1) = 0`.\n*   Since `F₃(x)` is always positive, we can remove the absolute value signs.\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can simplify `V`:\n`V = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )`\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the numerical value of V**\n\nWe need to use a calculator to find the numerical value. Ensure the calculator is in radian mode.\n*   `sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.31977045`\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 1 + 2.31977045 = 3.31977045`\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.31977045) ≈ 1.1999983`\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718`\n\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for `V`:\n`V ≈ ln(1.1999983 / 0.69314718)`\n`V ≈ ln(1.731241)`\n`V ≈ 0.548833`\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the final requested value**\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548833 = 5488.33`\n\nThe closest integer to 5488.33 is 5488.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
