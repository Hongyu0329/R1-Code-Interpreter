    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function `f`\n\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of `f`**:\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    Using the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$.\n    The exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, and therefore injective. Thus, $x_1 = x_2$.\n    This shows that $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of `f`**:\n    The function $f$ is given to be continuous and we have shown it is injective. A continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\n    *   **Case 1: `f` is strictly increasing.**\n        If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$. Since $f$ is increasing, applying it again preserves the inequality: $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means $\\exp(x_1) < \\exp(x_2)$, which is true as $\\exp(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. So, it is possible for $f$ to be strictly increasing.\n\n    *   **Case 2: `f` is strictly decreasing.**\n        A continuous, strictly decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must be a bijection, with $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = +\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x \\to +\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n        Let's analyze the limit of $f(f(x))$ as $x \\to -\\infty$.\n        Let $y = f(x)$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $y \\to +\\infty$.\n        So, $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to +\\infty} f(y) = -\\infty$.\n        However, the right side of the equation gives $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\exp(x) = 0$.\n        This leads to the contradiction $-\\infty = 0$.\n        Therefore, $f$ cannot be strictly decreasing.\n\n    We conclude that any solution `f` must be a continuous, strictly increasing function.\n\n### Step 2: Further properties of increasing solutions\n\n1.  **`f` has no fixed points**:\n    If $f(c) = c$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $f(f(c)) = f(c) = c$.\n    This would mean $\\exp(c) = c$. The equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions (since $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$).\n    Thus, $f$ has no fixed points.\n\n2.  **`f(x) > x` for all `x`**:\n    Since $f$ is a continuous function with no fixed points, either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\n    Suppose $f(x) < x$ for all $x$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, for any $x$, we have $f(x) < x \\implies f(f(x)) < f(x)$.\n    Combining these, we get $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$.\n    But the given equation is $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, and we know $\\exp(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    This is a contradiction.\n    Therefore, any solution `f` must satisfy $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n3.  **Inequality Chain**:\n    From $f(x) > x$ and the fact that $f$ is strictly increasing, we have the chain of inequalities:\n    $x < f(x) < f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step 3: Construction of solutions and counting them\n\nThe properties we've derived allow us to construct the solutions. The key idea is that if we define $f$ on a certain \"starting\" interval, its values everywhere else are determined by the functional equation.\n\n1.  **Choosing a starting point and interval**:\n    Let's consider the value of $f$ at $x=0$. From the inequality $x < f(x) < \\exp(x)$, we have $0 < f(0) < \\exp(0) = 1$.\n    Let's denote $f(0) = a$. This value `a` can be any number in the interval $(0, 1)$. The number of choices for `a` is the cardinality of the interval $(0, 1)$, which is $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n2.  **Defining `f` on a \"fundamental\" interval**:\n    Once we have chosen $a = f(0)$, we can determine the value of $f(a)$:\n    $f(a) = f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\n    Now, we need to define the function $f$ on the interval $[0, a]$. Since $f$ must be continuous and strictly increasing, it must map the interval $[0, a]$ to the interval $[f(0), f(a)] = [a, 1]$.\n    So, for a chosen $a \\in (0, 1)$, we must define $f$ on $[0, a]$ to be a continuous, strictly increasing function $h: [0, a] \\to [a, 1]$ such that $h(0) = a$ and $h(a) = 1$. In other words, $h$ must be a homeomorphism between these two intervals.\n\n3.  **Counting the number of choices for `h`**:\n    For a fixed $a \\in (0, 1)$, how many such functions $h$ are there?\n    Let's find the cardinality of the set of homeomorphisms from $[0, a]$ to $[a, 1]$.\n    This is equivalent to finding the cardinality of the set of homeomorphisms from $[0, 1]$ to $[0, 1]$ that fix the endpoints.\n    Let's construct a family of such homeomorphisms to find a lower bound on the cardinality. Pick a point $p \\in (0, a)$. For any $q \\in (a, 1)$, we can define a piecewise linear homeomorphism $h_q$ that passes through the points $(0, a)$, $(p, q)$, and $(a, 1)$. Since there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $q$ in the interval $(a, 1)$, and each choice gives a distinct function $h_q$ (as $h_q(p) = q$), there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such homeomorphisms.\n    The set of all such functions $h$ is a subset of the set of all continuous functions from $[0, a]$ to $[a, 1]$, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    Therefore, for each choice of $a$, there are exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ possible functions $h$.\n\n4.  **Uniqueness of the extension**:\n    Once we have chosen $a \\in (0, 1)$ and a homeomorphism $h: [0, a] \\to [a, 1]$, the function $f$ is uniquely determined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This is because any $x$ can be related to the interval $[0, a]$ by repeatedly applying $\\exp$ or its inverse, $\\ln$. The relation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ and the derived commutation relation $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$ allow us to uniquely determine the value of $f(x)$ from the values of $f$ on $[0, a]$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the total cardinality**:\n    The set of all solutions can be partitioned based on the value of $f(0) = a$.\n    Let $S$ be the set of all solutions. Let $S_a$ be the set of solutions where $f(0) = a$.\n    $S = \\bigcup_{a \\in (0,1)} S_a$.\n    The sets $S_a$ are disjoint for different values of $a$.\n    The cardinality of the index set $(0, 1)$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    The cardinality of each set $S_a$ is the number of possible choices for the function $h$, which we found to be $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    The total cardinality is the sum of the cardinalities of these disjoint sets:\n    $|S| = \\sum_{a \\in (0,1)} |S_a| = |(0, 1)| \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    Using cardinal arithmetic, $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0} \\times 2^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 + \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of such functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum."
