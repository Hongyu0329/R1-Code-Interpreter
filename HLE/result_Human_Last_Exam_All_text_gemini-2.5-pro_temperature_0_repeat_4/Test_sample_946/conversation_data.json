    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the name of a specific fictional singer. The key details are:\n    *   **Source:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n    *   **Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n    *   **Event:** The Junior prom.\n    *   **Performer:** A cardboard cutout.\n\n2.  **Locate the Scene:** The question directs us to the Junior prom scene within \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". In this part of the episode, the four main girls (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) have arrived at their prom.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Dialogue:** The identity of the performer is revealed through dialogue between Cheerleader and So and So.\n    *   Cheerleader exclaims, \"I can't believe we got Kaiser to play at our junior prom!\"\n    *   So and So clarifies the situation by replying, \"I can't believe we got a cardboard cutout of Kaiser to play at our junior prom!\"\n\n4.  **Analyze the Visuals:** The scene then shows the stage. On the stage, there is a cardboard cutout of a male singer holding a microphone. In front of the cutout is a bass drum with the name \"KAISER\" written on it in all caps.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Information:** Both the dialogue and the on-screen text explicitly identify the fictional performer as \"Kaiser\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Fictional vs. Real:** The name \"Kaiser\" is a direct reference to the real-world British band, Kaiser Chiefs, who were popular around the time the episode was made (2008). However, the question asks for the *fictional* singer's name *as presented in the cartoon*. Within the world of Teen Girl Squad, the performer is simply named \"Kaiser\".\n*   **Singer vs. Band:** The name \"Kaiser\" is written on a bass drum, which typically displays a band's name. However, the \"performer\" is a single cardboard cutout of a singer, and the dialogue refers to \"Kaiser\" as a singular entity (\"we got Kaiser to play\"). Therefore, \"Kaiser\" is the correct answer for the name of the fictional performer.\n*   **Specificity:** The question is very specific to episode #15, the Junior prom scene, and the cardboard cutout, all of which point directly to this single answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the direct evidence from the dialogue and visuals within \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the name of the fictional singer represented by the cardboard cutout at the Junior prom is Kaiser.\n\n<<<Kaiser>>>"
