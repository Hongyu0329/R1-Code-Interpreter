    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"first statute\"**: We are looking for the earliest law in chronological order.\n    *   **\"in the modern State of Israel\"**: The timeframe begins with the establishment of the state in 1948. Any law enacted by the Knesset (the Israeli parliament) qualifies.\n    *   **\"to explicitly introduce\"**: The statute must contain the actual words for \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*). An implied principle or a concept of fairness that doesn't use this specific term would not qualify.\n    *   **\"the concept of 'good faith'\"**: This is the specific legal principle we are searching for.\n    *   **Formatting Rules**: The final answer must not include \"the\" at the beginning or the year of the statute at the end.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:**\n    *   A common answer might be the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. This law is famous for establishing \"good faith\" (in Sections 12 and 39) as a foundational, overarching principle in Israeli contract law. However, the question asks for the *first* statute, and 1973 is relatively late. We must check for earlier laws.\n    *   The major project of creating original Israeli civil legislation began in the 1960s. This period is a likely source for the answer. Let's examine key statutes from this era:\n        *   **Land Law, 1969**: Section 9 of this law explicitly uses \"good faith\" (*be-tom lev*) in the context of competing transactions. This is a valid candidate, but we need to see if anything is earlier.\n        *   **Pledge Law, 1967**: Section 5 of this law uses \"good faith\" (*be-tom lev*) regarding the validity of a pledge against other creditors. Since 1967 is earlier than 1969, this is a better candidate than the Land Law.\n        *   **Bailees Law, 1967**: Section 12(b) of this law also explicitly uses \"good faith\" (*be-tom lev*). A check of the enactment dates reveals that the Bailees Law was passed on March 21, 1967, and the Pledge Law was passed on March 28, 1967. Therefore, the Bailees Law is the first among the major original civil statutes of the 1960s to introduce the concept.\n\n3.  **Searching for an Even Earlier Statute:**\n    *   Before the wave of original legislation in the 1960s, the Knesset passed \"New Version\" (*Nusach Hadash*) laws. These were official Hebrew translations and re-enactments of laws from the British Mandate period, making them official statutes of the State of Israel.\n    *   We must examine the **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957**. This is a statute enacted by the Knesset.\n    *   Section 28(b) of this ordinance defines a \"holder in due course.\" One of the conditions for a holder to qualify is that \"he took the bill in **good faith** (*be-tom lev*) and for value...\"\n    *   This ordinance was enacted in 1957.\n\n4.  **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   We have two main contenders: the Bailees Law (1967) and the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] (1957).\n    *   The Bailees Law represents the first introduction of the concept in an *original* piece of Israeli civil legislation, marking the beginning of its integration as a broad principle.\n    *   However, the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] is a formal statute of the modern State of Israel, enacted by the Knesset. It explicitly uses the term \"good faith\" and predates the Bailees Law by a full decade (1957 vs. 1967).\n    *   Based on a strict chronological reading of the question \"Which was the first statute in the modern State of Israel...\", the 1957 ordinance is the correct answer. It is the first legislative act of the Israeli state that codified the explicit term \"good faith\" into its laws.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **\"Explicitly introduce\" vs. Implied Principle**: It is crucial to distinguish between laws that use the literal words \"good faith\" and those that merely embody principles of fairness. The question demands the explicit term.\n*   **\"Statute in the modern State of Israel\"**: This includes \"New Version\" laws, as they are official re-enactments by the Knesset, not just holdovers from the British Mandate.\n*   **Chronology is Key**: The most famous law (Contracts Law, 1973) is not the first. Careful checking of enactment dates is necessary to identify the earliest instance.\n*   **Original Legislation vs. Re-enactment**: While legal scholars often focus on the wave of original legislation in the 1960s as the true \"introduction\" of good faith as a pervasive doctrine, the question is a factual one about the first appearance in any Israeli statute.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
