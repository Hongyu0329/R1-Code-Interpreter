The approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is based on the perception of natural predators, primarily birds. Human vision is fundamentally different from avian vision, as humans cannot see the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, which is a critical component of bumblebee coloration and warning signals. Using standard photographs further invalidates the method, as these images do not capture UV light. Therefore, clusters based on the visual assessment of untrained humans using standard photos would not accurately reflect the mimicry syndromes as they are perceived by predators in their natural environment.
