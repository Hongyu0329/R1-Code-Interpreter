    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed expression of the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in terms of q-series notation.**\nLet the infinite product be denoted by $P$.\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}) $$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\dots $$\nIn the standard notation of q-series, this is the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q;q^2)_\\infty$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to the Euler function $\\phi(q)$.**\nThe Euler function is defined as $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$.\nWe can split the product for $\\phi(q)$ into terms with even and odd powers of $q$:\n$$ \\phi(q) = \\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1})\\right) \\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})\\right) $$\nThe first part is our product $P$. The second part is $\\phi(q^2)$.\n$$ \\phi(q) = P \\cdot \\phi(q^2) $$\nTherefore, we can express $P$ as a ratio of Euler functions:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)} = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})} $$\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Euler function to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$.**\nThe Dedekind eta function is defined for $\\tau$ in the upper half-plane as:\n$$ \\eta(\\tau) = e^{\\pi i \\tau / 12} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{2\\pi i n \\tau}) $$\nLet $Q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$. Then $\\eta(\\tau) = Q^{1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-Q^n) = Q^{1/24} \\phi(Q)$.\nSo, $\\phi(Q) = Q^{-1/24} \\eta(\\tau)$.\n\nWe need to evaluate $\\phi(e^{-\\pi})$ and $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$.\nFor $\\phi(e^{-\\pi})$, let $Q = e^{-\\pi}$. Then $e^{-\\pi} = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$, which gives $-\\pi = 2\\pi i \\tau$, so $\\tau = i/2$.\n$$ \\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i/2) = e^{\\pi/24} \\eta(i/2) $$\nFor $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$, let $Q = e^{-2\\pi}$. Then $e^{-2\\pi} = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$, which gives $-2\\pi = 2\\pi i \\tau$, so $\\tau = i$.\n$$ \\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i) = e^{2\\pi/24} \\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i) $$\n\n**Step 4: Express the product $P$ in terms of the eta function.**\nSubstituting the expressions from Step 3 into the ratio for $P$:\n$$ P = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24} \\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i)} = e^{\\pi/24 - \\pi/12} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} $$\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the ratio of eta functions $\\eta(i/2)/\\eta(i)$.**\nWe can use the properties of Weber modular functions. The function $f(\\tau)$ is defined as:\n$$ f(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta^2(\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau/2)\\eta(2\\tau)} $$\nIt is also related to the elliptic modulus $k$ by $f(\\tau) = (k'/k)^{1/12}$, where $q=e^{i\\pi\\tau}$.\nFor $\\tau=i$, we have the singular modulus $k=k'=1/\\sqrt{2}$.\nThus, $f(i) = (1)^{1/12} = 1$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of $f(\\tau)$:\n$$ 1 = f(i) = \\frac{\\eta(i)^2}{\\eta(i/2)\\eta(2i)} $$\nNow, we use the modular transformation property of the eta function: $\\eta(-1/\\tau) = \\sqrt{-i\\tau}\\eta(\\tau)$.\nLet $\\tau = i/2$. Then $-1/\\tau = 2i$.\n$$ \\eta(2i) = \\sqrt{-i(i/2)}\\eta(i/2) = \\sqrt{1/2}\\eta(i/2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\eta(i/2) $$\nSubstitute this into the equation for $f(i)$:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{\\eta(i)^2}{\\eta(i/2) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\eta(i/2)\\right)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\eta(i)^2}{\\eta(i/2)^2} $$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}\\right)^2 = \\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2} $$\nTaking the square root of both sides (the ratio is positive):\n$$ \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} = (2^{1/2})^{1/2} = 2^{1/4} $$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final closed expression for $P$.**\nSubstitute the value of the ratio from Step 5 into the expression for $P$ from Step 4:\n$$ P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/4} $$\n\nThe closed expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/4}e^{-\\pi/24}$."
