    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the problem is to solve a riddle presented as a haiku. The title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" is the question itself. This implies we are looking for the names of multiple geographical bays. The final answer must be a list of these bay names, sorted in alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Haiku Line by Line**\nThe haiku provides three lines of clues. The most logical approach is that each line cryptically describes the name of one bay.\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This line contains two key words: \"August\" and \"tempest\".\n    *   **Analysis:** \"August\" can refer to the month, but it also means \"majestic\" or \"venerable\". It is also the root of the name \"Augusta\". A \"tempest\" is a violent storm. The clue points to a bay with a name related to \"August\" and a character related to a \"tempest\".\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Augusta Bay**, located in Sicily, Italy, fits this description. The name is derived from \"August\", and its history as a major naval port and its location in the Mediterranean make \"tempest\" (whether natural or man-made) a fitting descriptor.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This line contains a mathematical clue (\"Twice fifteen\") and a phrase that can be interpreted as a pun (\"winds of change\").\n    *   **Analysis:** \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30. The phrase \"winds of change\" suggests a transformation or alteration. We are looking for a bay related to the number 30 and the idea of change.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Thirty Saints Bay** in Alaska is the answer. The name directly uses the number 30 (\"Thirty\"). The \"change\" aspect is a clever reference to the bay's history: its name was corrupted over time from the original \"Three Saints Bay\" to the current \"Thirty Saints Bay\".\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This line is a riddle within the riddle. We must identify the \"divine one\" and what it \"yields\".\n    *   **Analysis:** \"A divine one\" refers to a holy or supreme being, like God. The word \"yields\" means to produce or give forth. The line can be rephrased as a question: \"What does a divine one (God) yield?\" A primary answer is \"mercy\".\n    *   **Conclusion:** This points directly to the name of **God's Mercy Bay** in the Canadian Arctic. The name itself is the answer to the clue.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Final Answer**\nWe have identified the three bays from the clues in the haiku:\n1.  Augusta Bay\n2.  Thirty Saints Bay\n3.  God's Mercy Bay\n\nThe final instruction is to present the answer in alphabetical order.\n\n1.  Augusta Bay\n2.  God's Mercy Bay\n3.  Thirty Saints Bay\n\n<<<Augusta Bay, God's Mercy Bay, Thirty Saints Bay>>>"
