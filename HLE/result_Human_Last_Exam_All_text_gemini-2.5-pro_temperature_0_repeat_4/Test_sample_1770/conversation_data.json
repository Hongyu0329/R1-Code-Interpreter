    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the gene that should be knocked out in *Corynebacterium glutamicum* to prevent p-coumaric acid degradation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Metabolic Context**\nThe problem states that you have engineered *Corynebacterium glutamicum* to produce p-coumaric acid, but the organism is degrading the product. This implies that *C. glutamicum* has a native metabolic pathway that uses p-coumaric acid as a substrate, likely as a carbon and energy source. Our goal is to identify and disable the first committed step of this degradation pathway.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the p-Coumaric Acid Degradation Pathway in *C. glutamicum***\nTo find the correct gene to knock out, we must first understand how *C. glutamicum* metabolizes p-coumaric acid. Research into the metabolism of aromatic compounds in this bacterium reveals a specific pathway for hydroxycinnamates (the class of compounds p-coumaric acid belongs to).\n\nThe degradation proceeds in two main steps:\n1.  **Activation:** p-coumaric acid is first activated by attaching a Coenzyme A (CoA) molecule. This reaction converts p-coumaric acid into **p-coumaroyl-CoA**. This is catalyzed by a CoA ligase.\n2.  **Cleavage:** The p-coumaroyl-CoA molecule is then cleaved. This is the key degradation step that breaks down the molecule into smaller parts that can enter central metabolism.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Key Enzyme and its Gene**\nThe crucial enzyme in this pathway is the one that performs the cleavage of p-coumaroyl-CoA. This enzyme is a **p-coumaroyl-CoA hydratase/lyase**. It hydrates the double bond in the side chain of p-coumaroyl-CoA and then cleaves it, yielding 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA.\n\nBy knocking out the gene for this enzyme, the degradation pathway is blocked right after the initial activation step. The cell can no longer break down p-coumaroyl-CoA. This blockage leads to the accumulation of its precursor, p-coumaric acid, which is the desired outcome.\n\nIn the scientific literature and genomic databases for *C. glutamicum* and related organisms, the gene encoding this p-coumaroyl-CoA hydratase/lyase is commonly designated as **`hclA`**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Specificity of the Target:** The `hclA` gene encodes an enzyme that acts on hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs, including both p-coumaroyl-CoA and feruloyl-CoA. This makes it the perfect target for preventing the degradation of p-coumaric acid.\n2.  **Choosing the Right Knockout:** While one could also consider knocking out the CoA ligase (the activation enzyme), targeting the hydratase/lyase (`hclA`) is often preferred. It is the first irreversible step committed to degradation, making it a very effective and clean target for knockout.\n3.  **Gene Nomenclature:** While the common gene name is `hclA`, specific strain annotations might use a locus tag (e.g., `cg3070` in *C. glutamicum* ATCC 13032). However, `hclA` is the widely accepted name for this gene function in the context of metabolic engineering.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nTo prevent the degradation of the produced p-coumaric acid, you should knock out the gene that encodes the enzyme responsible for the first committed step in its catabolic pathway. This enzyme is the p-coumaroyl-CoA hydratase/lyase, and its corresponding gene is **`hclA`**.\n\n<<<hclA>>>"
