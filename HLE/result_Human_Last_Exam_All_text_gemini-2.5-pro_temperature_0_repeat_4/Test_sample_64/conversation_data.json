    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its pronunciation.**\nThe word is the kanji 「弟」. Its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Break down the word into morae.**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and rhythm in Japanese. The word 「おとうと」 is composed of four morae:\n1.  お (o)\n2.  と (to)\n3.  う (u) - This 'u' serves to lengthen the 'o' sound of 'to', but it counts as a separate mora.\n4.  と (to)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the four main pitch accent patterns in standard (Tokyo) Japanese.**\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式):** The pitch starts low on the first mora and rises on the second. It then stays high for the rest of the word and also remains high on any particle that follows. The notation is [0]. For a 4-mora word, the pattern is L-H-H-H.\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second, remaining low for the rest of the word. The notation is [1]. For a 4-mora word, the pattern is H-L-L-L.\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and then falls on a subsequent mora *within* the word. The notation is [2], [3], etc., depending on which mora the drop occurs after. For a 4-mora word, the drop could be after the 2nd mora (L-H-L-L) or 3rd mora (L-H-H-L).\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the particle that follows. The notation is [n], where n is the number of morae in the word. For a 4-mora word, the pattern is L-H-H-H, but it becomes L-H-H-H-L when a particle is attached.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the pitch accent of 「弟」 (otouto).**\nThe standard pitch accent for 「弟」 is pronounced as follows:\n*   お (low)\n*   と (high)\n*   う (high)\n*   と (high)\n\nThis gives the pattern L-H-H-H.\n\n**Step 5: Distinguish between Heiban and Odaka.**\nBoth Heiban and Odaka patterns can have a L-H-H-H pattern for a 4-mora word when spoken in isolation. The key difference is how they behave with a particle, such as 「が」 (ga).\n*   **Heiban:** The pitch stays high on the particle.\n    *   「弟が」 (otouto ga) is pronounced L-H-H-H-H.\n*   **Odaka:** The pitch drops on the particle.\n    *   An example of a 4-mora Odaka word is 「命」 (inochi). 「命が」 (inochi ga) is pronounced L-H-H-H-L.\n\nSince 「弟が」 is pronounced L-H-H-H-H (the pitch does not drop), the pattern for 「弟」 is **Heiban**. This is often represented with the accent nucleus number [0].\n\n**Step 6: Match the finding with the answer choices.**\n*   A. Heiban: This matches our analysis.\n*   B. Atamadaka: Incorrect.\n*   C. Nakadaka: Incorrect.\n*   D. Odaka: Incorrect.\n*   E. Heiban or Nakadaka: Incorrect, the standard pattern is consistently Heiban.\n\nTherefore, the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
