    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the function f(a, b, c)**\n\nThe function $f$ is defined by the recurrence relation:\n$f(a,b,c) = f(a-1,b,c) + f(a,b-2,c) + f(a,b,c-3)$\nwith the base case $f(0,0,0)=1$ and $f(a,b,c)=0$ if any argument is negative.\n\nThis recurrence describes the number of ways to reach the point $(a,b,c)$ from $(0,0,0)$ by taking steps of size $(1,0,0)$, $(0,2,0)$, and $(0,0,3)$. Let $n_1, n_2, n_3$ be the number of steps of each type, respectively. To reach $(a,b,c)$, we must have:\n$n_1 \\cdot 1 = a \\implies n_1 = a$\n$n_2 \\cdot 2 = b \\implies n_2 = b/2$\n$n_3 \\cdot 3 = c \\implies n_3 = c/3$\n\nThis implies that $f(a,b,c)$ can be non-zero only if $b$ is an even integer and $c$ is a multiple of 3. Otherwise, $f(a,b,c)=0$.\nIf these conditions are met, the total number of steps is $n = n_1+n_2+n_3 = a + b/2 + c/3$. The number of ways to arrange these steps is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n$f(a,b,c) = \\binom{a+b/2+c/3}{a, b/2, c/3} = \\frac{(a+b/2+c/3)!}{a! (b/2)! (c/3)!}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the arguments $\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p$**\n\nWe are given $p = 2^{127}-1$, which is a Mersenne prime. The arguments are:\n$\\alpha_{p}=\\sum_{i=0}^{N}{(p^{3i}+3p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})}$\n$\\beta_{p}=\\sum_{i=0}^{N}{(8p^{3i}+4p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})}$\n$\\gamma_{p}=\\sum_{i=0}^{N}{(3p^{3i}+9p^{3i+1}+12p^{3i+2}})}$\nwhere $N = \\frac{3p-1}{2}$.\n\nFirst, let's check the conditions for $f$ to be non-zero.\n- $\\beta_p$ is a sum of terms which are all even (e.g., $8p^{3i}$), so $\\beta_p$ is even.\n- $\\gamma_p = 3 \\sum_{i=0}^{N}{(p^{3i}+3p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})$. This is clearly a multiple of 3.\nSo, $f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p)$ is non-zero.\n\nWe need to compute $f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) = \\frac{(A+B+C)!}{A! B! C!} \\pmod p$, where:\n$A = \\alpha_p$\n$B = \\beta_p/2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{N}{(4p^{3i}+2p^{3i+1}+2p^{3i+2}})}$\n$C = \\gamma_p/3 = \\sum_{i=0}^{N}{(p^{3i}+3p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})} = \\alpha_p = A$.\n\n**Step 3: Using Lucas's Theorem**\n\nTo compute the multinomial coefficient modulo a prime $p$, we use Lucas's Theorem. This requires the base-$p$ representation of the arguments $A, B, C$.\nThe expressions for $\\alpha_p, \\beta_p/2, \\gamma_p/3$ are given as sums of powers of $p$. Since $p=2^{127}-1$ is very large, the coefficients (e.g., 1, 3, 4 for $\\alpha_p$) are all less than $p$. The powers of $p$ are distinct. Thus, these sums are the base-$p$ expansions.\n\nLet $A_k, B_k, C_k$ be the digits of $A, B, C$ in base $p$.\n- For $k=3i+j$ with $j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ and $i \\in [0, N]$:\n  - $A_k$ follows the pattern $(1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, \\dots)$\n  - $B_k$ follows the pattern $(4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, \\dots)$\n  - $C_k = A_k$ follows the pattern $(1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, \\dots)$\n- For other $k$, the digits are 0.\n\nLet $S = A+B+C$. The digits of $S$ in base $p$, $S_k$, are $S_k = A_k+B_k+C_k = 2A_k+B_k$, since there are no carries (the sums are small).\n- For $k=3i$: $S_k = 2(1)+4 = 6$.\n- For $k=3i+1$: $S_k = 2(3)+2 = 8$.\n- For $k=3i+2$: $S_k = 2(4)+2 = 10$.\nAll these digits are less than $p$.\n\nLucas's Theorem for multinomial coefficients states:\n$\\binom{A+B+C}{A, B, C} \\equiv \\prod_k \\binom{S_k}{A_k, B_k, C_k} \\pmod p$.\n\nThe product is over all powers $k$. The terms repeat in a cycle of 3.\n- For $k=3i$: $\\binom{S_k}{A_k,B_k,C_k} = \\binom{6}{1,4,1} = \\frac{6!}{1!4!1!} = 30$.\n- For $k=3i+1$: $\\binom{S_k}{A_k,B_k,C_k} = \\binom{8}{3,2,3} = \\frac{8!}{3!2!3!} = 560$.\n- For $k=3i+2$: $\\binom{S_k}{A_k,B_k,C_k} = \\binom{10}{4,2,4} = \\frac{10!}{4!2!4!} = 3150$.\n\nThe number of indices $i$ is from $0$ to $N = \\frac{3p-1}{2}$, which is a total of $\\frac{3p-1}{2}+1 = \\frac{3p+1}{2}$ times.\nThe value is the product of these three multinomials, raised to the power of the number of occurrences.\nLet $V = f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\pmod p$.\n$V \\equiv (30 \\cdot 560 \\cdot 3150)^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the expression**\n\nLet $X = 30 \\cdot 560 \\cdot 3150 = 52,920,000$.\nWe need to compute $V \\equiv X^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$.\nUsing Fermat's Little Theorem ($a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$):\n$\\frac{3p+1}{2} = \\frac{3(p-1)+4}{2} = \\frac{3(p-1)}{2} + 2$.\nSo, $V \\equiv X^{\\frac{3(p-1)}{2} + 2} = (X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}})^3 \\cdot X^2 \\pmod p$.\n\nWe need to evaluate $X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\pmod p$, which is the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{X}{p})$.\n$X = 2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2$.\n$(\\frac{X}{p}) = (\\frac{2^6 3^3 5^4 7^2}{p}) = (\\frac{2^6}{p}) (\\frac{3^3}{p}) (\\frac{5^4}{p}) (\\frac{7^2}{p})$.\nSince $(\\frac{a^2}{p})=1$, this simplifies to $(\\frac{3}{p})$.\n\nWe use the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity to compute $(\\frac{3}{p})$:\n$(\\frac{3}{p}) = (\\frac{p}{3}) (-1)^{\\frac{(p-1)(3-1)}{4}} = (\\frac{p}{3}) (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$.\n- $p = 2^{127}-1$. Since $127$ is odd, $2^{127} = 2 \\cdot (2^2)^{63} = 2 \\cdot 4^{63} \\equiv 2 \\cdot 1^{63} = 2 \\pmod 3$.\n  So, $p \\equiv 2-1 = 1 \\pmod 3$. This means $(\\frac{p}{3}) = (\\frac{1}{3}) = 1$.\n- $p = 2^{127}-1$. Since $127 \\ge 2$, $p \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\n  This means $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ is odd. So, $(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} = -1$.\nTherefore, $(\\frac{3}{p}) = 1 \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\n\nNow, we can find the value of $V$:\n$V \\equiv (X^{\\frac{p-1}{2}})^3 \\cdot X^2 \\equiv (-1)^3 \\cdot X^2 = -X^2 \\pmod p$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nThe value is congruent to $-X^2$ modulo $p$.\n$X = 52,920,000$.\n$X^2 = (52,920,000)^2 = 2,790,526,400,000,000$.\nThe value of $f(\\alpha_{p},\\beta_{p},\\gamma_{p})\\mod p$ is the remainder of this number when divided by $p$. Since $p=2^{127}-1$ is a very large positive number, the standard representative for the class $-X^2 \\pmod p$ is $p-X^2$. However, any integer in the congruence class is a valid representative. The question asks for \"the value\", and $-X^2$ is a specific integer value.\n\nThe final value is $-2,790,526,400,000,000$.\n\n>>>-2790526400000000"
