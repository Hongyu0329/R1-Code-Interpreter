    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{4n}$):** The generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A power subgroup is another name for a **cyclic subgroup**. A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is cyclic if there exists an element $g \\in G$ such that $H = \\langle g \\rangle$.\n*   **The Specific Group:** We are considering the generalized quaternion group of size 128. This means its order is 128.\n    $|Q_{4n}| = 4n = 128 \\implies n = 32$.\n    So, the group is $Q_{128}$, with the presentation:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Structure and Elements of $Q_{128}$\n\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be divided into two disjoint sets:\n1.  The elements of the subgroup generated by $x$: $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 64\\}$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n2.  The elements of the coset $y\\langle x \\rangle$: $\\{yx^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 64\\}$. There are 64 such elements.\n\nWe will count the number of cyclic subgroups generated by elements from each of these sets.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Cyclic Subgroups within $\\langle x \\rangle$\n\nThe subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64. A fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that a cyclic group of order $N$ has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $N$. The number of subgroups is therefore $\\tau(N)$, the number of divisors of $N$.\n\n*   The order of $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $N=64$.\n*   We need to find the number of divisors of 64. Since $64 = 2^6$, the number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1 = 7$.\n*   These 7 subgroups are $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d$ is a divisor of 64. Specifically, they are:\n    *   $\\langle x^{64/1} \\rangle = \\langle x^0 \\rangle = \\langle 1 \\rangle$ (order 1)\n    *   $\\langle x^{64/2} \\rangle = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n    *   $\\langle x^{64/4} \\rangle = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n    *   $\\langle x^{64/8} \\rangle = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n    *   $\\langle x^{64/16} \\rangle = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n    *   $\\langle x^{64/32} \\rangle = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n    *   $\\langle x^{64/64} \\rangle = \\langle x^1 \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$ (order 64)\n\nSo, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups contained entirely within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$\n\nThese subgroups are generated by elements of the form $g = yx^k$. Let's determine the order of these elements.\n\n*   We use the relations $y^2 = x^{32}$ and $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}$ (which implies $yx = x^{-1}y$).\n*   Let's compute $g^2$:\n    $g^2 = (yx^k)^2 = yx^k yx^k = y(x^k y)x^k = y(y x^{-k})x^k = y^2 x^{-k} x^k = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n*   Since $x^{32} \\neq 1$ (it has order 2), the order of any element $yx^k$ is not 1 or 2.\n*   Let's compute $g^4$:\n    $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   Since $g^4=1$ and $g^2 \\neq 1$, the order of every element $g = yx^k$ is exactly **4**.\n\nThis means all cyclic subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ must have order 4. Now we need to count how many *distinct* such subgroups there are.\n\n*   A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators (where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function).\n*   Let $H_k = \\langle yx^k \\rangle$. The two generators of $H_k$ are $yx^k$ and $(yx^k)^3$.\n*   Let's find an expression for the second generator, $(yx^k)^3$:\n    $(yx^k)^3 = (yx^k)^2 (yx^k) = x^{32} yx^k$.\n    We need to write this in the form $yx^j$. We use the relation $x^{32}y = yx^{-32} = yx^{32}$.\n    $x^{32} yx^k = (x^{32}y)x^k = (yx^{32})x^k = yx^{32+k} = yx^{k+32}$.\n*   So, the two generators for the subgroup $\\langle yx^k \\rangle$ are $yx^k$ and $yx^{k+32}$.\n*   This means that $\\langle yx^k \\rangle = \\langle yx^{k+32} \\rangle$.\n*   There are 64 elements of the form $yx^k$ (for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 63$). Since each cyclic subgroup is generated by exactly two of these elements, the number of distinct subgroups is the total number of elements divided by 2.\n*   Number of distinct subgroups = $64 / 2 = 32$.\n\nThese 32 subgroups are distinct from the 7 subgroups found in Step 3, because they contain elements (like $yx^k$) that are not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Power Subgroups\n\nTo find the total number of power (cyclic) subgroups, we sum the counts from the two disjoint collections of subgroups we identified.\n\n*   Number of cyclic subgroups within $\\langle x \\rangle$: 7\n*   Number of cyclic subgroups not within $\\langle x \\rangle$: 32\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\bf{39}$.\n<<<39>>>"
