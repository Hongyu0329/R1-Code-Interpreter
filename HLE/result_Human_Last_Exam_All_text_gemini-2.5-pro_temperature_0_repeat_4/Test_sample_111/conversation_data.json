    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key date.**\nThe first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that she died on **September 12, 1368**, likely from the plague, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\n**Step 2: Research Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in 1368.**\nNext, we need to find out where Geoffrey Chaucer was during that specific time. We can consult historical records and scholarly biographies of Chaucer.\n*   During this period, Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III as an esquire. His duties often involved diplomatic travel to the continent.\n*   Surviving documents, known as the *Chaucer Life-Records*, show that on July 17, 1368, Chaucer was granted letters of protection to travel abroad on the king's service. He was away from England from mid-July until late October 1368.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude that Chaucer was not in England.**\nSince Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission abroad from July to October 1368, he could not have been in England when Blanche died there on September 12. This immediately eliminates \"England\" (C) and \"Scotland\" (E) as possible answers.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the destination of Chaucer's mission.**\nWhile the official records do not explicitly state his destination, the strong consensus among Chaucerian scholars is that his mission was to Milan, **Italy**. The purpose was likely negotiations with the powerful Visconti family. This is supported by the fact that King Edward III's son, Lionel of Antwerp, had married Violante Visconti in Milan just a few months earlier, in June 1368.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the travel timeline and location.**\n*   Chaucer left England in mid-July. Blanche's death occurred on September 12, nearly two months later.\n*   To reach Milan (Italy) from England, Chaucer would have had to travel through **France**.\n*   A journey from London to Milan in the 14th century would have taken several weeks, but it is highly probable that after nearly two months of travel, Chaucer would have already reached his destination in Italy. He was more likely conducting his diplomatic business in Italy than still being in transit through France.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the remaining choices and select the best one.**\n*   **A. Italy:** This was the likely destination of his mission, and he had sufficient time to get there. This is a very strong possibility.\n*   **B. France:** He would have passed through France, so this is also possible, but less likely than him being at his destination.\n*   **D. Unknown:** While his exact location on the specific day isn't known, we have a very strong scholarly consensus on his destination. \"Italy\" is a more specific and probable answer than \"Unknown.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the evidence, the most probable location for Geoffrey Chaucer on September 12, 1368, was Italy, where he was carrying out his diplomatic mission.\n\n<<<A>>>"
