    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Context:** HR (Heart Rate) and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) are being tracked.\n    *   **Method:** The tracking is done by capturing \"beat-to-beat intervals\" using PPG (Photoplethysmography), a technology common in smartwatches and fitness trackers.\n    *   **Core Inquiry:** The question asks for the specific name of the \"value between heartbeats\" that is used to compute HRV.\n\n2.  **Identify the Fundamental Measurement:**\n    *   Both HR and HRV are derived from the same basic measurement: the precise amount of time that passes between one heartbeat and the very next one.\n    *   This measurement is a time interval, typically expressed in milliseconds (ms).\n\n3.  **List and Evaluate Potential Names for this Value:**\n    *   The question itself uses the term \"beat-to-beat interval,\" which is a correct and descriptive term. However, in scientific and clinical contexts, more specific terminology is used.\n    *   **R-R Interval (or RR Interval):** This is the most common and standard term used in the field of HRV analysis. It originates from the Electrocardiogram (ECG), where the most prominent spike in the electrical signal of a heartbeat is called the \"R wave.\" The R-R interval is the time between two consecutive R waves. Even when using PPG, which measures blood volume changes (pulse waves) instead of electrical signals, the term \"R-R interval\" is ubiquitously used by convention to refer to the time between consecutive pulse peaks.\n    *   **Inter-beat Interval (IBI):** This is another very common and accurate term. It is more general than \"R-R interval\" and simply means the interval of time between beats. It is often used interchangeably with R-R interval.\n    *   **N-N Interval (Normal-to-Normal Interval):** This is a more refined version of the R-R interval. It refers to the interval between two consecutive *normal* heartbeats. Data is often filtered to remove artifacts or abnormal beats (like ectopic beats), and the resulting intervals are called N-N intervals. This is the data typically used for the most accurate HRV calculations.\n\n4.  **Clarify the Distinction from HRV:**\n    *   A crucial point is that HRV is *not* the R-R interval itself.\n    *   The R-R interval is the raw data point (e.g., 850 ms, then 875 ms, then 840 ms).\n    *   HRV is a statistical measure calculated from a *series* of these R-R intervals to quantify how much they vary. For example, a common HRV metric is SDNN (the standard deviation of all N-N intervals) or RMSSD (the root mean square of successive differences between N-N intervals).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The value measured between heartbeats is a time interval.\n    *   The most standard and widely recognized name for this value in the context of HRV is the **R-R interval**. The term **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** is also correct and frequently used.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate and standard term for the value computed between heartbeats to measure HRV is the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
