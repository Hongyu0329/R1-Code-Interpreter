    "Answering this question requires understanding two key mathematical concepts: Sidon sets and Hausdorff dimension, and then combining results from harmonic analysis and fractal geometry.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Sidon Sets\n\nA set $A$ in an abelian group (like the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$) is called a **Sidon set** (or a $B_2$ set) if it satisfies the following property: for any four elements $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\in A$, the equality\n$$x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4$$\nimplies that the set of summands on the left is the same as the set of summands on the right, i.e.,\n$$\\{x_1, x_2\\} = \\{x_3, x_4\\}$$\nThis means that either $x_1 = x_3$ and $x_2 = x_4$, or $x_1 = x_4$ and $x_2 = x_3$.\n\nEssentially, Sidon sets are sets where all pairwise sums are unique, up to the order of addition. This property implies that the set must be \"additively sparse\". For instance, a finite Sidon set $A \\subset \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ can have at most $\\sim\\sqrt{N}$ elements.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding Hausdorff Dimension\n\nThe **Hausdorff dimension** is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set. It generalizes the notion of dimension to sets that are not smooth manifolds. For a set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, its Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(E)$, can be any non-negative real number.\n\n*   A finite set of points has a Hausdorff dimension of 0.\n*   A smooth curve (like a line segment) has a Hausdorff dimension of 1.\n*   A smooth surface has a Hausdorff dimension of 2.\n*   Fractal sets, like the middle-third Cantor set, can have non-integer dimensions. The middle-third Cantor set has a dimension of $\\log(2)/\\log(3) \\approx 0.631$.\n\nWe are looking for a Sidon set within the interval $[0, 1]$ that is as \"large\" as possible in the sense of Hausdorff dimension.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Maximum Hausdorff Dimension\n\nThis is a well-known problem in harmonic analysis. The solution is a specific number, which is established by proving an upper bound and a lower bound that match.\n\n#### The Upper Bound\n\nIt has been proven that any Sidon set $A \\subset [0, 1]$ must have a Hausdorff dimension of at most $1/2$.\n\n**Theorem (Astala, 1994):** If $A \\subset [0, 1]$ is a Sidon set, then $\\dim_H(A) \\le 1/2$.\n\nThe proof is quite technical and relies on tools from Fourier analysis. The core idea is as follows:\n1.  If a set $E$ has $\\dim_H(E) > 1/2$, a result by R. Kaufman implies that it must support a probability measure $\\mu$ whose Fourier transform $\\hat{\\mu}(t) = \\int e^{-ixt} d\\mu(x)$ has very good decay properties (specifically, $\\hat{\\mu} \\in L^p$ for any $p < \\infty$).\n2.  The property that $\\hat{\\mu} \\in L^4$ implies that the convolution measure $\\nu = \\mu * \\mu$ (which describes the distribution of sums $x+y$ with $x,y \\in E$) is a continuous function.\n3.  However, the Sidon property imposes strong restrictions on the structure of sums. It implies that the convolution measure $\\mu * \\mu$ should be highly \"singular\" or \"spiky\", rather than being a continuous function.\n4.  This contradiction shows that the initial assumption must be false, so a Sidon set cannot have a Hausdorff dimension greater than $1/2$.\n\n#### The Lower Bound (Existence)\n\nTo show that $1/2$ is the maximum possible dimension, one must construct a Sidon set that actually achieves this dimension. This has proven to be a very subtle problem, and several proposed constructions have been found to be flawed.\n\nThe general strategy for construction is to build a Cantor-like set. A typical (but flawed) attempt is as follows:\n1.  Take a very sparse Sidon set of integers, $\\{n_k\\}$, such that its density gives the desired dimension. For dimension $1/2$, we need a set where $n_k$ grows roughly like $k^2$.\n2.  Construct the set $E = \\left\\{ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{c_k}{2^{n_k}} : c_k \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\right\\}$.\n3.  The Hausdorff dimension of this set $E$ is indeed $1/2$.\n4.  However, as shown in the thought process, this specific set $E$ is not a Sidon set due to the possibility of creating non-trivial sum equalities by swapping coefficients (e.g., $x_1+x_2 = (x_1+x_2)+0$).\n\nCorrect constructions are more complex and often rely on probabilistic methods or more intricate deterministic choices for the exponents or coefficients. Despite the technical difficulties in the construction, the existence of a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension $1/2$ is a well-established result in the field, with the first correct proof attributed to S. V. Konyagin.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we find the maximum possible value.\n*   No Sidon set in $[0,1]$ can have a Hausdorff dimension greater than $1/2$.\n*   There exists at least one Sidon set in $[0,1]$ with a Hausdorff dimension equal to $1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is $1/2$.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
