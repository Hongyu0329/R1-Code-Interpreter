    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the derivation of the most memory-efficient solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Objective:** The main goal is to compare two strings lexicographically.\n2.  **Input:** Two strings are provided as input, each on a new line.\n3.  **Constraints:**\n    *   The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n    *   The lengths of the two strings are identical and range from 1 to 100 characters.\n4.  **Comparison Rule:** The comparison must be case-insensitive. This means an uppercase letter (e.g., 'A') is considered equivalent to its lowercase counterpart (e.g., 'a').\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically less than the second.\n    *   Print \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n6.  **Specific Task:** The core task is to devise the C program that uses the least amount of memory for its variables and to calculate this total memory usage in bytes, denoted as `m`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** To handle the case-insensitivity, the most reliable method is to convert characters from both strings to a uniform case (either all lowercase or all uppercase) before comparing them. The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is ideal for this.\n2.  **Lexicographical Comparison:** The comparison must proceed from the first character of each string to the last. The very first position where the characters differ determines the lexicographical order of the entire strings. If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are considered equal.\n3.  **Memory Optimization:** The prompt emphasizes creating the *most memory-efficient* solution. A standard approach might be to declare two character arrays, one for each string (e.g., `char s1[101], s2[101]`). However, to minimize memory, we should question if it's necessary to store both strings in memory simultaneously. We can store the first string and then read the second string one character at a time, comparing it against the corresponding character of the stored first string. This avoids allocating a second large buffer.\n4.  **Input Handling in C:** When reading the first string with `scanf(\"%s\", s1);`, the newline character (`\\n`) that follows it remains in the input buffer. When reading the second string character by character, this newline must be skipped. A `scanf` format string with a leading space, like `scanf(\" %c\", &char_var);`, is an effective way to consume any leading whitespace, including newlines, before reading the actual character.\n5.  **Variable Memory Sizes:** For calculating the total memory `m`, we must assume standard sizes for C data types in a typical competitive programming environment:\n    *   `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte\n    *   `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n6.  **String Termination:** C-style strings require a null terminator (`\\0`). To store a string of up to 100 characters, the character array must be of size at least 101.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nBased on the points above, we can design the most memory-efficient algorithm and calculate its memory footprint.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Declare a character array `s1` of size 101 to store the first string. This size accommodates the maximum length of 100 characters plus the null terminator.\n2.  Read the first string from the input into `s1` using `scanf(\"%s\", s1);`.\n3.  Declare an integer variable `i` to use as a loop counter and index for `s1`.\n4.  Declare a single character variable `c2` to store one character at a time from the second string.\n5.  Start a loop that iterates from `i = 0` as long as `s1[i]` is not the null terminator (`\\0`).\n6.  Inside the loop:\n    a. Read a single character from the standard input into `c2` using `scanf(\" %c\", &c2);`. The leading space in the format string ensures that any whitespace (like the newline left from the first `scanf`) is skipped.\n    b. Convert the characters `s1[i]` and `c2` to lowercase for comparison.\n    c. If `tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2)`, the first string is smaller. Print \"-1\" and terminate the program.\n    d. If `tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(c2)`, the first string is larger. Print \"1\" and terminate the program.\n7.  If the loop finishes without terminating, it means all characters were equal case-insensitively. Print \"0\".\n\n**Memory Calculation:**\n\nNow, let's calculate the total memory `m` used by the variables in this optimized program.\n\n*   **`char s1[101];`**: An array to store the first string.\n    *   Memory = 101 elements * `sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 byte = **101 bytes**.\n*   **`int i;`**: An integer for the loop index.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n*   **`char c2;`**: A single character variable to read the second string.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nm = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `c2`)\nm = 101 + 4 + 1\nm = 106 bytes.\n\nThis is the most memory-efficient implementation as it avoids allocating a second 101-byte array for the second string.\n\n<<<106>>>"
