    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify the person whose lectures were cited by Albert Einstein in his specific 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The key elements are:\n*   **Who:** Albert Einstein\n*   **What:** A citation to someone's lectures\n*   **Where:** In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific scientific paper.**\nIn 1905, his \"Annus Mirabilis\" or \"miracle year,\" Einstein published several seminal papers. The one on Brownian motion is titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the citations within that specific paper.**\nA careful examination of the original 1905 paper on Brownian motion published in the journal *Annalen der Physik* reveals a crucial fact: the paper contains no citations or footnotes referencing the work of other scientists. This was characteristic of some of Einstein's early papers (most famously his paper on special relativity from the same year), where he built his arguments from fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 4: Consider closely related work from the same period.**\nThis leads to a potential ambiguity. While the Brownian motion paper itself has no citations, Einstein's work on this topic in 1905 also includes his doctoral thesis, which he completed in the same year. The thesis, titled \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"), is thematically and methodologically foundational to the Brownian motion paper. It is possible the question is conflating the two works or referring to his overall research on the topic in 1905.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the citations in the doctoral thesis.**\nUnlike the Brownian motion paper, Einstein's doctoral thesis *does* contain references to the work of other scientists.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the specific citation that matches the question's wording.**\nThe question specifically asks about \"lectures\". In his doctoral thesis, Einstein cites Ludwig Boltzmann's influential book, **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"**, which translates to **\"Lectures on Gas Theory\"**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nStrictly speaking, Einstein cited no one in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion. However, the question's specific mention of \"lectures\" strongly points to a known reference in his closely related work from the same year. In his 1905 doctoral thesis, which laid the groundwork for the Brownian motion paper, he cited Ludwig Boltzmann's \"Lectures on Gas Theory\". Therefore, the most complete and intended answer is Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n***\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
