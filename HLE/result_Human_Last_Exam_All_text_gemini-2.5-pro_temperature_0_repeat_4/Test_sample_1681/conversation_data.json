    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the quantum prisoner's dilemma to find its equilibrium point.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Classical Prisoner's Dilemma\n\nFirst, let's understand the classical game described by the payoff matrix:\n$P = \\begin{pmatrix} (5,5) & (0,7) \\\\ (7,0) & (1,1) \\end{pmatrix}$\nThe rows represent Player 1's choices (Cooperate, Defect) and the columns represent Player 2's choices (Cooperate, Defect).\n*   **(C, C) -> (5, 5):** Both cooperate, a good outcome for both.\n*   **(C, D) -> (0, 7):** Player 1 cooperates and gets suckered; Player 2 defects and gets the highest reward.\n*   **(D, C) -> (7, 0):** Player 2 cooperates and gets suckered; Player 1 defects and gets the highest reward.\n*   **(D, D) -> (1, 1):** Both defect, a poor outcome for both.\n\nIn classical game theory, the dominant strategy for each player is to Defect, regardless of what the other player does. This leads to the unique Nash Equilibrium of (Defect, Defect), with a payoff of (1, 1). This is the \"dilemma,\" as both players would be better off if they had both cooperated to get (5, 5).\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the Quantum Game\n\nTo play the game in \"quantum space,\" we use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n\n1.  **State Space:** Each player's choice is represented by a qubit. The basis states $|C\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $|D\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ correspond to Cooperate and Defect.\n2.  **Initial State:** The game starts with a shared entangled state. The question states we can \"design the initial states for an optimal\" outcome. The optimal setup for resolving the dilemma involves maximal entanglement. The initial state is created by an entangling operator $J$ acting on the classical state $|CC\\rangle$:\n    $|\\psi_{in}\\rangle = J|CC\\rangle$\n    The operator $J$ is given by $J = \\exp(i\\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\sigma_x \\otimes \\sigma_x)$, where $\\sigma_x$ is the Pauli-X matrix (bit-flip) and $\\gamma$ is the entanglement parameter ($0 \\le \\gamma \\le \\pi/2$). For maximal entanglement, we set $\\gamma = \\pi/2$.\n    This results in the initial state: $|\\psi_{in}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|CC\\rangle + i|DD\\rangle)$.\n3.  **Strategies:** Players' strategies are no longer just C or D, but any 2x2 unitary matrix $U$ acting on their respective qubit. The classical strategies are embedded as specific unitary operators:\n    *   Cooperate: $\\hat{C} = I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ (Identity)\n    *   Defect: $\\hat{D} = \\sigma_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ (Bit-flip)\n4.  **Final State and Payoff:** If Player 1 chooses strategy $\\hat{U}_1$ and Player 2 chooses $\\hat{U}_2$, the state of the system becomes $|\\psi\\rangle = (\\hat{U}_1 \\otimes \\hat{U}_2)|\\psi_{in}\\rangle$. To determine the outcome, a disentangling operator $J^\\dagger$ (the conjugate transpose of $J$) is applied before measurement.\n    $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = J^\\dagger (\\hat{U}_1 \\otimes \\hat{U}_2) J |CC\\rangle$\n    The expected payoffs are then calculated based on the probabilities of measuring the four classical outcomes ($|CC\\rangle, |CD\\rangle, |DC\\rangle, |DD\\rangle$) from this final state.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Equilibria in the Quantum Game\n\nThe key to resolving the dilemma is the availability of a new, purely quantum strategy, often called the \"Miracle\" move, $\\hat{Q}$:\n$\\hat{Q} = i\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\\\ 0 & -i \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nLet's analyze the payoffs for different strategy combinations with maximal entanglement ($\\gamma = \\pi/2$).\n\n1.  **Classical Equilibrium (Defect, Defect):**\n    Let's see if $(\\hat{D}, \\hat{D})$ is still an equilibrium. The payoff for this pair is calculated to be (1, 1), same as the classical game. Now, consider if Player 1 has an incentive to deviate. If Player 1 unilaterally switches to the quantum strategy $\\hat{Q}$ while Player 2 sticks with $\\hat{D}$, the new profile is $(\\hat{Q}, \\hat{D})$. The calculation for this payoff yields (7, 0). Player 1's payoff increases from 1 to 7. Therefore, Player 1 has a strong incentive to deviate.\n    **Conclusion:** The classical Nash Equilibrium $(\\hat{D}, \\hat{D})$ is **not** an equilibrium in the quantum game.\n\n2.  **New Quantum Equilibrium (Miracle, Miracle):**\n    Now let's analyze the strategy profile $(\\hat{Q}, \\hat{Q})$.\n    *   Both players choose the quantum strategy $\\hat{Q}$.\n    *   The final state is calculated as $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = J^\\dagger (\\hat{Q} \\otimes \\hat{Q}) J |CC\\rangle$.\n    *   This calculation simplifies to show that the final state is $|CC\\rangle$ (up to a global phase). This means the probability of measuring (Cooperate, Cooperate) is 100%.\n    *   The resulting payoff is **(5, 5)**.\n\n3.  **Stability of the Quantum Equilibrium:**\n    Is $(\\hat{Q}, \\hat{Q})$ a stable Nash Equilibrium? We must check if either player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate.\n    *   Assume Player 2 plays $\\hat{Q}$. Player 1's payoff is 5.\n    *   If Player 1 deviates to the classical Defect strategy $\\hat{D}$, the profile is $(\\hat{D}, \\hat{Q})$. The calculation for this payoff yields (0, 7). Player 1's payoff drops from 5 to 0. There is no incentive to defect.\n    *   If Player 1 deviates to the classical Cooperate strategy $\\hat{C}$, the profile is $(\\hat{C}, \\hat{Q})$. The calculation for this payoff yields (1, 1). Player 1's payoff drops from 5 to 1. There is no incentive to change.\n    *   It can be proven that no other unitary strategy can yield a payoff greater than 5 for Player 1 as long as Player 2 plays $\\hat{Q}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nIn the quantum version of the Prisoner's Dilemma with maximal entanglement, the classical Nash Equilibrium of (Defect, Defect) is eliminated. A new, unique Nash Equilibrium emerges where both players choose the quantum strategy $\\hat{Q}$. This equilibrium point results in the payoff vector (5, 5), which corresponds to the Pareto optimal outcome of mutual cooperation. The dilemma is resolved.\n\nThe equilibrium point is the outcome where both players cooperate, yielding a payoff of (5, 5).\n\n<<(5, 5)>>>"
