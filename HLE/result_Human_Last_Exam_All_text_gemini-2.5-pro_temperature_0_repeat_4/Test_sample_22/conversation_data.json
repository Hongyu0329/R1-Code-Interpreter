    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP)**\nSNP heritability is a population parameter that quantifies the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype that can be explained by the additive effects of all common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) considered together. It represents the theoretical maximum predictive power of an ideal linear model that uses all SNPs and their *true* effect sizes. It is an upper bound on how well we could possibly predict a trait using only common genetic variants.\n\n**Step 2: Define a Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability**\nA Polygenic Score (or Polygenic Risk Score, PRS) is a tool used to predict an individual's phenotype based on their genotype. It is calculated by summing the number of risk alleles an individual carries across many genetic loci, with each allele's contribution weighted by its *estimated* effect size. These effect sizes are typically derived from a large-scale Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by how much of the variance in the phenotype it can explain in a new, independent \"test\" sample. This is often measured by R², the squared correlation between the PGS and the phenotype.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Foundations of h²_SNP and PGS Predictive Ability**\nThe crucial difference lies in the effect sizes (or weights) used:\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** Based on the *true*, unknown effect sizes of all SNPs. It is a theoretical ceiling.\n*   **PGS Predictive Ability (R²_PGS):** Based on *estimated* effect sizes from a GWAS discovery sample of a finite size.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Why PGS Predictive Ability is Lower than SNP Heritability**\nThe predictive ability of a PGS will be lower than the SNP heritability because the process of creating and applying a PGS introduces several sources of imperfection that are not present in the theoretical concept of SNP heritability.\n\n*   **Estimation Error:** The effect sizes used to build the PGS are estimated from a finite GWAS sample. Due to this sampling, the estimated effects will have some error and will not be the true effect sizes. A predictive model built with imperfect (estimated) weights will necessarily explain less variance than a perfect model built with the true weights. The predictive power of the perfect model is, by definition, the SNP heritability.\n*   **Incomplete Information:** A PGS is often constructed using only a subset of SNPs (e.g., those that pass a certain statistical significance threshold in the GWAS), whereas SNP heritability accounts for the contribution of *all* common SNPs. Using a subset of predictors naturally limits the total variance that can be explained.\n*   **Differences Between Samples:** The predictive ability of a PGS can be further reduced if the test sample (where prediction is performed) differs from the discovery sample (where effect sizes were estimated) in terms of genetic ancestry, allele frequencies, or patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD). SNP heritability is a property of a single population, while a PGS often involves this cross-population application.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nSNP heritability represents the theoretical maximum variance that can be explained by a linear combination of SNPs. A polygenic score is a practical implementation of such a linear model, but it relies on estimated, and therefore imperfect, parameters. A model with imperfect parameters will always have a predictive performance that is less than or equal to the performance of the optimal model with true parameters. In any real-world scenario with a finite discovery sample, the PGS performance will be strictly lower than the SNP heritability. Therefore, the statement is correct.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
