    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Who:** Two specific individuals.\n*   **What:** They are Nobel laureates.\n*   **Where:** They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n*   **When:** The commercial aired in the year 2000.\n*   **Key Detail:** The commercial had the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Advertising Campaign**\nThe question points to a specific, well-known (and later, infamous) advertising campaign by Enron. The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major branding effort by Enron in 2000 to position itself as an innovative, intellectual, and transformative company, moving beyond its image as just an energy pipeline company.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Participants**\nThe campaign featured several prominent thinkers and public figures. The task is to find the two who were or would become Nobel laureates. Research into this specific ad campaign is required.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the First Nobel Laureate**\n*   One of the economists featured in the commercials was **Kenneth Arrow**.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must verify his Nobel laureate status. Kenneth Arrow was a co-recipient of the 1972 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Therefore, at the time of the commercial in 2000, he was already a Nobel laureate.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Second Nobel Laureate**\n*   The other prominent economist featured was **Paul Krugman**.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must verify his Nobel laureate status and the timing. Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008. This is a critical detail: when the commercial aired in 2000, Krugman was a highly respected economist but was **not yet** a Nobel laureate. He became one eight years later. The question asks which two \"Nobel laureates\" were featured, which is accurate from a present-day perspective, even if one of them had not yet received the award at the time of the commercial. Both individuals have since expressed regret over their participation, given Enron's subsequent collapse and scandal.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals who are Nobel laureates and were featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial are Kenneth Arrow and Paul Krugman.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Kenneth Arrow>>>"
