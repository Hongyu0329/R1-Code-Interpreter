    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The goal is to find the total number of unique members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans to date.\n\n2.  **Define \"let-7 family member\":** This is a crucial point. A \"family member\" in the context of miRNAs typically refers to a unique mature miRNA sequence. This is different from the number of genes that encode these miRNAs. Multiple genes, often located at different positions in the genome, can produce the exact same mature miRNA.\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Members:** The let-7 family is named with letters (e.g., let-7a, let-7b). In humans and other mammals, the primary members are:\n    *   let-7a\n    *   let-7b\n    *   let-7c\n    *   let-7d\n    *   let-7e\n    *   let-7f\n    *   let-7g\n    *   let-7i\n    *(Note: let-7h and let-7j are not found in mammals like humans).*\n\n4.  **Include Structurally and Functionally Related Members:** Scientific literature and databases like miRBase classify miR-98 as a member of the let-7 family due to its high sequence similarity (especially in the critical \"seed\" region) and related function.\n    *   miR-98\n\n5.  **Count the Unique Mature miRNAs:** By listing the unique members identified in the steps above, we can count them:\n    1.  let-7a\n    2.  let-7b\n    3.  let-7c\n    4.  let-7d\n    5.  let-7e\n    6.  let-7f\n    7.  let-7g\n    8.  let-7i\n    9.  miR-98\n\n    This gives a total of **9** distinct mature miRNA members.\n\n6.  **Address Potential Confusion (Genes vs. Members):** It is important to note why some sources might cite a different number, such as 12. This higher number typically refers to the number of miRNA *genes* (precursor hairpins), not the unique mature products.\n    *   **let-7a** is produced by 3 different genes (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, let-7a-3).\n    *   **let-7f** is produced by 2 different genes (let-7f-1, let-7f-2).\n    *   The other 7 members (let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98) are each produced by a single gene.\n    *   Counting the genes gives: 3 (for let-7a) + 2 (for let-7f) + 7 (for the others) = **12 genes**.\n\n    Since the question asks for the number of \"members,\" the most accurate answer is the number of unique mature miRNAs, not the number of genes that code for them.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the standard classification which counts unique mature microRNA sequences, there are 9 members in the human let-7 family. These are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98.\n\n<<<9>>>"
