    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C$ defined by $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the curve and its reduction type**\nThe curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$, since the equation is of the form $z^2=f(x)$ with $\\deg(f)=5$, and the genus is $g = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\nThe coefficients of the defining polynomial are integers, so the curve is defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We are interested in its reduction over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe discriminant of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$ is $\\Delta_f = 2^{16} \\cdot 197$. Since the valuation $v(\\Delta_f)=16 > 0$ (with $v(2)=1$), the curve has bad reduction at the prime $p=2$.\nThe stable reduction of the curve will have a special fiber that is a stable curve. For a genus 2 curve, this means it is a connected curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the branch points of the curve**\nThe geometry of the hyperelliptic curve is determined by its branch points, which are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. The stable reduction is determined by the 2-adic clustering of these roots. We find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)$ using Newton's polygon method.\n\nLet $f(x) = a_5x^5 + a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$.\nThe coefficients are $a_5=2, a_4=0, a_3=2, a_2=0, a_1=0, a_0=1$.\nThe valuation is the 2-adic valuation $v$, normalized by $v(2)=1$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v(a_i))$ for $a_i \\neq 0$.\nThe set of points with finite y-coordinates is $S = \\{(0, v(a_0)=0), (3, v(a_3)=1), (5, v(a_5)=1)\\}$.\n\nThe Newton polygon is the lower convex hull of these points. It consists of two segments:\n1.  The segment from $(0,0)$ to $(3,1)$.\n    The slope is $m_1 = \\frac{1-0}{3-0} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    The number of roots corresponding to this segment is the length of its projection on the x-axis, which is $3-0=3$.\n    The valuation of these roots is $-m_1 = -1/3$.\n2.  The segment from $(3,1)$ to $(5,1)$.\n    The slope is $m_2 = \\frac{1-1}{5-3} = 0$.\n    The number of roots is $5-3=2$.\n    The valuation of these roots is $-m_2 = 0$.\n\nSo, the five roots of $f(x)$ are split into two groups based on their 2-adic valuation:\n*   A set $R_1$ of 3 roots $\\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3\\}$ with valuation $v(\\alpha_i) = -1/3$.\n*   A set $R_2$ of 2 roots $\\{\\beta_1, \\beta_2\\}$ with valuation $v(\\beta_j) = 0$.\n\n*Self-Correction/Refinement:* One might worry that roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients must be algebraic integers and thus have non-negative valuations. This is only true for roots of a *monic* polynomial with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Since $f(x)$ is not monic and its leading coefficient is not a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, its roots are not necessarily 2-adic integers, and can have negative valuations. Thus, the Newton polygon result is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the structure of the stable reduction**\nThe clustering of roots determines the structure of the special fiber of the stable model. Each cluster of roots corresponds to a component of the special fiber.\n*   The cluster $R_1$ has size 3. It corresponds to a component $C_1$ whose genus is $g_1 = \\lfloor (\\#R_1 - 1)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (3-1)/2 \\rfloor = 1$. So, $C_1$ is an elliptic curve.\n*   The cluster $R_2$ has size 2. It corresponds to a component $C_2$ whose genus is $g_2 = \\lfloor (\\#R_2 - 1)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (2-1)/2 \\rfloor = 0$. So, $C_2$ is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n\nThe total arithmetic genus of the special fiber must equal the genus of the generic fiber, which is $g=2$. The formula for the arithmetic genus of a curve with two components intersecting at $\\delta$ nodes is $p_a = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 1$.\nSubstituting the known values: $2 = 1 + 0 + \\delta - 1$, which gives $\\delta=2$.\nSo, the stable reduction consists of an elliptic curve component $C_1$ and a rational component $C_2$ intersecting at two nodes.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the thickness of the double points**\nThe question asks for the \"thickness of the double point\". Since the two components intersect at two nodes, and the setup is symmetric with respect to the hyperelliptic involution, it is expected that these two nodes are of the same type and have the same thickness. The question uses the singular \"the double point\" to refer to this single thickness value.\n\nThe thickness of a node (or the length of the corresponding edge in the dual graph of the stable reduction) created by the splitting of roots into two clusters $I$ and $J$ can be calculated using the formula involving the sizes of the clusters and the valuations of their \"centers\" (the valuation of the roots in the cluster). Let $\\mu_I$ and $\\mu_J$ be the valuations of the roots in clusters $I$ and $J$. The thickness $n$ is given by:\n$n = \\text{lcm}(|I|, |J|) \\cdot |\\mu_I - \\mu_J|$\n\nIn our case, $I=R_1$ and $J=R_2$.\n*   $|R_1| = 3$\n*   $|R_2| = 2$\n*   $\\mu_{R_1} = -1/3$\n*   $\\mu_{R_2} = 0$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$n = \\text{lcm}(3, 2) \\cdot |(-1/3) - 0| = 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 2$.\n\nThe thickness of the double points is 2. This integer value represents the valuation of the parameter defining the node in the local analytic equation of the stable model (i.e., the singularity is locally described by an equation of the form $uv = \\pi^n$, where $\\pi$ is a uniformizer of the base ring and $n$ is the thickness)."
