    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Scenario:**\n    *   **Hand Type:** Suited Jack (Jxs). This means we are comparing hands like AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most profitable position in poker. We are guaranteed to act last post-flop if called, which gives us a significant informational advantage. Consequently, we can and should play the widest range of hands from this position.\n    *   **Action:** Open to 2.5x. This is a standard opening size. The specific size affects the pot odds offered to the blinds and their subsequent calling and 3-betting ranges, which in turn defines the profitability of our opening range.\n    *   **Game Conditions:** 100BB deep, rake-free cash game.\n        *   **100BB deep:** This is a standard stack depth where post-flop play, implied odds, and hand playability are very important.\n        *   **Rake-free:** This is a critical and non-standard condition. Rake is the fee taken by the house from each pot. Its absence means that the reward for winning any pot, no matter how small, is higher than in a typical game. This incentivizes playing more hands, especially marginal ones, thus widening our opening range compared to a standard raked game.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Suited Jack Hands:**\n    *   Suited hands derive their value from their potential to make flushes (strong hands) and their high-card value or straight potential.\n    *   **Top Tier (AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs):** These are premium hands with high card value and the best straight/flush possibilities. They are always opened from any position.\n    *   **Mid Tier (J9s, J8s, J7s):** These are strong semi-connectors. They make strong straights and flushes and are standard opens from the button. J9s is a suited connector, J8s is a one-gapper, and J7s is a two-gapper. Their value decreases slightly as the gap increases, making straights harder to complete.\n    *   **Bottom Tier (J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s):** These are the weakest suited jacks. Their value comes almost entirely from their flush potential and pairing the jack.\n        *   **High Card Weakness:** The kickers (6 down to 2) are very low. If you make a pair of jacks, you are very vulnerable to being out-kicked by any better jack.\n        *   **Straight Potential:** The straight potential is poor due to the large gaps between the cards (e.g., J-6 is a five-gapper). While the low card can connect with other low cards (e.g., J5s can use the 5 for an A-2-3-4-5 straight), this is less common and often results in the lower end of a straight.\n        *   **Flush Domination:** While any suited hand can make a flush, a Jack-high flush is vulnerable to any Queen, King, or Ace-high flush. This risk is the same for all Jxs hands.\n\n3.  **Determine the Opening Range Threshold:**\n    *   In a standard, *raked* 100BB cash game, a GTO (Game Theory Optimal) button opening range is approximately 40-45% of hands. In such a range, hands like J4s, J3s, and J2s are often on the borderline, with J3s and J2s typically being folded.\n    *   However, the **rake-free** condition is the deciding factor. The absence of rake increases the expected value (EV) of opening all hands. A hand that might be slightly unprofitable (a marginal fold) in a raked game becomes profitable (a marginal open) in a rake-free game.\n    *   Because of this, a GTO-approved button opening range in a rake-free environment expands to nearly 50%. This expanded range includes *all* suited Ax, Kx, Qx, and Jx hands.\n    *   Therefore, every single suited jack, from AJs all the way down to J2s, is considered a profitable hand to open-raise from the button in this specific scenario. The EV of opening J2s is very low, but it is still positive, making it a better play than folding (which has an EV of 0).\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Hand in the Range:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"worst suited jack you *should* open\". Since the analysis shows that you should open all of them, the \"worst\" one is simply the hand with the lowest intrinsic value and lowest EV among them.\n    *   Ranking the bottom-tier hands, J5s is better than J4s, which is better than J3s, which is better than J2s. The primary reason is the decreasing value of the kicker and worsening connectivity.\n    *   Therefore, J2s is the weakest of all the suited jacks. As it is still a profitable open in this specific game environment, it is the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Rake-Free is the Key:** Do not use a standard chart for a raked game, as it would lead to an incorrect answer (likely J5s or J4s). The rake-free nature of the game is the most important variable.\n*   **Position Matters:** This range is specific to the button. From any other position, the answer would be a much stronger hand.\n*   **\"Should Open\" vs. \"Best Fold\":** The question implies the hand is part of the opening range. We are looking for the bottom of that range, not the first hand that gets excluded. In this case, no suited jacks are excluded.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on GTO principles for a 100BB, rake-free cash game, the button's opening range is wide enough to include every suited jack. The worst of these, having the lowest kicker and poorest connectivity, is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
