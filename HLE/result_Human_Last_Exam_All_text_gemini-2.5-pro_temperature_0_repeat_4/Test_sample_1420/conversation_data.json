    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Specific Heat Exponent (α):** This exponent describes the singular behavior of the specific heat (C) near the critical temperature (Tc), following the relation C ∝ |T - Tc|^(-α).\n    *   **Renormalization Group (RG) and Epsilon (ϵ) Expansion:** The ϵ-expansion is a powerful technique within RG theory to calculate critical exponents as a power series in the parameter ϵ = d_c - d.\n    *   **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** This is the spatial dimension above which the critical behavior is correctly described by mean-field theory. For the universality classes of models like Ising, XY, and Heisenberg (generally known as n-vector models), the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4.\n    *   **Spatial Dimension (d):** The problem specifies that we are interested in a system with d = 3.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Expansion Parameter (ϵ):**\n    The epsilon parameter is defined as the deviation from the upper critical dimension.\n    *   d_c = 4\n    *   d = 3\n    *   Therefore, ϵ = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\n3.  **Recall the General Formula for α:**\n    The ϵ-expansion provides a formula for critical exponents that depends on the number of components of the order parameter, 'n'. For the specific heat exponent α, the result to the first order in ϵ is:\n    α = (4 - n) / (2(n + 8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ²)\n\n4.  **Address the Universality Class (Value of 'n'):**\n    The problem does not specify the model (e.g., Ising, XY, Heisenberg), which means 'n' is not given.\n    *   n = 1 for the Ising model (scalar order parameter).\n    *   n = 2 for the XY model (2D vector order parameter).\n    *   n = 3 for the Heisenberg model (3D vector order parameter).\n    In the context of such questions, if the model is not specified, it is standard practice to assume the simplest and most fundamental case: the **Ising model (n=1)**.\n\n5.  **Calculate α for the Assumed Universality Class (n=1):**\n    We substitute n=1 into the general first-order formula:\n    α = (4 - 1) / (2(1 + 8)) * ϵ\n    α = 3 / (2 * 9) * ϵ\n    α = 3 / 18 * ϵ\n    α = 1/6 * ϵ\n\n6.  **Substitute the Value of ϵ to Find the Final Answer:**\n    Now, we use the value ϵ = 1 that we calculated for d=3:\n    α ≈ 1/6 * (1)\n    α ≈ 0.1667\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Approximation:** The ϵ-expansion is a perturbative series. The calculation is performed only to the first order (O(ϵ)). Higher-order terms would provide a more accurate result.\n*   **Validity of ϵ=1:** The expansion is rigorously derived for ϵ → 0. Using it for ϵ = 1 is a significant extrapolation, but it is a standard method that provides a reasonable first estimate. For comparison, the accepted numerical value for the 3D Ising model is α ≈ 0.110, so the first-order result of α ≈ 0.167 is in the right ballpark but not exact.\n*   **Assumption of n=1:** The final numerical answer depends on the choice of the universality class (the value of 'n'). The assumption of the Ising model (n=1) is a necessary step to arrive at a single value, based on convention for such problems.\n\n<<<0.1667>>>"
