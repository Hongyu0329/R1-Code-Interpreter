    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X.\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **C:** A Riemann surface of genus `g=3`. This is a smooth complex projective curve.\n*   **X = C^(15):** The 15th symmetric power of C. Its points represent effective divisors of degree 15 on C.\n*   **Néron-Severi Group NS(X):** The group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence.\n*   **Rank of NS(X):** This is the Picard number of X, denoted `ρ(X)`. It is the dimension of the vector space `NS(X) ⊗ Q`.\n\n**2. Key Formula relating ρ(C^(n)) and ρ(J(C))**\n\nThe crucial result that connects the Picard number of the symmetric power of a curve to the Picard number of its Jacobian is the following formula:\n`ρ(C^(n)) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`\nwhere `J(C)` is the Jacobian variety of the curve `C`.\n\n*   **Justification:** This formula arises from the study of the cohomology of `C^(n)`. The second cohomology group `H^2(C^(n), Q)` decomposes as:\n    `H^2(C^(n), Q) ≅ H^2(C, Q) ⊕ Λ^2 H^1(C, Q)`\n    The algebraic cycles on `C^(n)` correspond to the algebraic cycles in each component.\n    *   The `H^2(C, Q)` part is 1-dimensional, spanned by the class of a point on `C`. This gives rise to a divisor class on `C^(n)` (often denoted `W_{n-1}` or `L`), which is always algebraic. This accounts for the `1` in the formula.\n    *   The `Λ^2 H^1(C, Q)` part is isomorphic to `H^2(J(C), Q)`. The algebraic cycles within this space correspond precisely to the algebraic cycles on the Jacobian `J(C)`. The dimension of this space of cycles is `ρ(J(C))`.\n*   **Condition:** This formula is known to be valid when `n ≥ g - 1`. In our case, `n=15` and `g=3`, so `15 ≥ 3 - 1 = 2`. The condition is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of `ρ(J(C))` for a genus 3 curve `C`.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Picard Number of the Jacobian, ρ(J(C))**\n\n`J(C)` is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. We need to find the range of its Picard number.\n\n**3.1. Smallest Possible Rank**\n\n*   For any abelian variety `A` of dimension `g ≥ 1`, the Picard number `ρ(A)` is at least 1. The rank is 1 if the only algebraic divisor classes are integer multiples of the principal polarization class.\n*   This minimum value is achieved for the Jacobian `J(C)` when `C` is a *very general* curve. For such a curve, the endomorphism ring of its Jacobian is as small as possible: `End(J(C)) = Z`.\n*   Thus, the minimum possible value for `ρ(J(C))` is 1.\n\n**3.2. Largest Possible Rank**\n\n*   The Picard number of a `g`-dimensional abelian variety `A` is maximized when `A` has a large number of endomorphisms. The theoretical maximum for `ρ(A)` is `g^2`.\n*   For `g=3`, the maximum possible value of `ρ(J(C))` is `3^2 = 9`.\n*   This maximum is achieved if the abelian variety is isogenous to a product of `g` elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM), all isogenous to each other: `A ~ E^g`.\n*   We must verify that there exists a genus 3 curve `C` whose Jacobian `J(C)` achieves this maximum.\n*   Such a curve exists. The **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation `x^4 + y^4 = z^4`, is a smooth plane curve of genus `g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3`.\n*   It is a classical result that the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic, `J(F_4)`, is isogenous to the cube of a specific elliptic curve `E` with complex multiplication: `J(F_4) ~ E^3`, where `E` is the curve `y^2 = x^3 - x` with CM by the Gaussian integers `Z[i]`.\n*   The Picard number of `E^3` can be calculated as follows:\n    `ρ(E^3) = ρ(E × E × E) = 3ρ(E) + 3 rank(Hom(E, E))`\n    *   `ρ(E) = 1` (the polarization class).\n    *   `rank(Hom(E, E)) = rank(End(E)) = 2` (since `E` has CM).\n    *   `ρ(E^3) = 3(1) + 3(2) = 3 + 6 = 9`.\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible value for `ρ(J(C))` for a genus 3 curve `C` is 9.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we can substitute the minimum and maximum values of `ρ(J(C))` back into our formula for `ρ(X)`.\n\n*   **Smallest Rank of NS(X):**\n    `ρ_min(X) = 1 + ρ_min(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Largest Rank of NS(X):**\n    `ρ_max(X) = 1 + ρ_max(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10`\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
