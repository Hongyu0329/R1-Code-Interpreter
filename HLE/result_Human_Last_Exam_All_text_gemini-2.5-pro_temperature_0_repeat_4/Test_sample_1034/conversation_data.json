    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**1. Understanding the Geometric Condition**\n\nThe question asks for the number of integer values of side `AC` for which there are two possible values for side length `AB`. This scenario describes the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines (the SSA case).\n\nLet's denote the sides and angles of triangle `ABC` as follows:\n*   `a = BC = S`\n*   `b = AC`\n*   `c = AB`\n*   `∠A`, `∠B = 30°`, `∠C`\n\nFor two distinct triangles to exist given side `a`, side `b`, and angle `B`, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The given angle `B` must be acute. Here, `m∠B = 30°`, which is acute, so this condition is satisfied.\n2.  The length of the side opposite the given angle (`b = AC`) must be greater than the altitude from vertex `C` to side `AB` but less than the length of the other given side (`a = BC`).\n\n**2. Setting up the Inequality**\n\nLet `h` be the altitude from vertex `C` to the line containing side `AB`. In the right-angled triangle formed by this altitude, we have:\n`sin(B) = h / a`\n`h = a * sin(B)`\n\nWe are given `a = S` and `∠B = 30°`. We know that `sin(30°) = 1/2`.\nSo, `h = S * (1/2) = S/2`.\n\nThe condition for two possible triangles is `h < b < a`. Substituting the values we have:\n`S/2 < AC < S`\n\nThis inequality gives the range of possible values for the length of side `AC`.\n\n**3. Determining the Value of S**\n\nThe problem states `S = SNYWR`. This is a placeholder common in math competitions. A standard interpretation for such a placeholder, when no other information is given, is to sum the alphabetical positions of the letters (A=1, B=2, C=3, ...).\n\n*   S is the 19th letter.\n*   N is the 14th letter.\n*   Y is the 25th letter.\n*   W is the 23rd letter.\n*   R is the 18th letter.\n\nSumming these values to find `S`:\n`S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99`.\n\n**4. Computing the Number of Integer Values**\n\nNow we substitute `S = 99` into the inequality for `AC`:\n`99/2 < AC < 99`\n`49.5 < AC < 99`\n\nThe question asks for the number of *integer values* of `AC` in this range. The integers `k` must satisfy `49.5 < k < 99`.\n\n*   The smallest integer greater than 49.5 is 50.\n*   The largest integer less than 99 is 98.\n\nSo, the possible integer values for `AC` are `50, 51, 52, ..., 98`.\nTo count the number of integers in this inclusive range, we use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of values = `98 - 50 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49`.\n\nThus, there are 49 possible integer values for the side length `AC`.\n\n<<<49>>>"
