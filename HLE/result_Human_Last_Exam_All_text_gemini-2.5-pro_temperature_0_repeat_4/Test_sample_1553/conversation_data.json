    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the novel and the main character:** The novel is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Jacek Dukaj. The main character is Adam Zamoyski, an astronaut from the 21st century who is resurrected in the far future.\n\n2.  **Identify the key female character in the main character's life:** Adam Zamoyski's primary guide, protector, and eventual partner in this new reality is a post-human entity (a \"phoebe\") named Angelina.\n\n3.  **Analyze the nature of their relationship:** Their relationship is central to the plot. It evolves from a functional one, where Angelina helps Adam navigate the complex post-human world, into a deep, personal, and romantic bond.\n\n4.  **Determine if a \"marriage\" or an equivalent union occurs:** In the context of the novel's advanced, transhumanist society, the concept of a traditional marriage is not directly applicable. However, Adam and Angelina's bond becomes so profound that they form what is known in the book's terminology as a \"dyad\" – a single, integrated functional unit. This is the closest and most powerful equivalent to a marriage in their world, representing a complete merging of their lives and purposes.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the evolution of their relationship and their formation of a dyad, the character that Adam Zamoyski effectively marries is Angelina.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   The term \"marries\" must be interpreted within the science-fiction context of the novel. A traditional wedding ceremony does not occur.\n*   The relationship's culmination is the formation of a \"dyad,\" which is a concept specific to the book's universe and represents a union far deeper than a conventional marriage.\n*   Angelina is the only character with whom Adam Zamoyski forms such a profound and lasting bond.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries (or forms a marital-equivalent union with) a character named Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
