    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Triple Crown\nThe batting Triple Crown in Major League Baseball is a prestigious and rare achievement for a hitter. To win it, a player must lead their respective league (American League or National League) in all three of the following statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Careful Points\n*   **Winners vs. Wins:** The question asks for the number of \"winners\" (unique players), not the total number of times the Triple Crown has been won. Some players have won it more than once.\n*   **Batting vs. Pitching:** The term \"Triple Crown\" in baseball most commonly refers to the batting achievement. There is also a Pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA), but the question, by convention, refers to the batting version.\n*   **Historical Leagues:** MLB history includes major leagues that are now defunct, such as the American Association (1882â€“1891). Winners from these recognized major leagues are included in the official count.\n*   **League-Specific:** The achievement is league-specific. A player must lead the AL or the NL, not the entire MLB.\n\n### Step 3: List All Triple Crown Winners\nWe will list every player who has won the Triple Crown, noting their league and year.\n\n**American League (AL) Winners:**\n*   Nap Lajoie (1901)\n*   Ty Cobb (1909)\n*   Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n*   Lou Gehrig (1934)\n*   **Ted Williams (1942, 1947)** - *Won twice*\n*   Mickey Mantle (1956)\n*   Frank Robinson (1966)\n*   Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n*   Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n\n**National League (NL) Winners:**\n*   Paul Hines (1878)\n*   Hugh Duffy (1894)\n*   Heinie Zimmerman (1912)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925)** - *Won twice*\n*   Chuck Klein (1933)\n*   Joe Medwick (1937)\n\n**American Association (AA) Winner:**\n*   Tip O'Neill (1887)\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Unique Winners\nNow, we count the number of individual players from the lists above, being careful not to double-count players who won multiple times.\n\n*   **American League:** There are 9 unique players (Ted Williams is counted once).\n*   **National League:** There are 6 unique players (Rogers Hornsby is counted once).\n*   **American Association:** There is 1 unique player.\n\nTotal number of unique winners = 9 (AL) + 6 (NL) + 1 (AA) = **16**.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there have been 16 different players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<16>>>"
