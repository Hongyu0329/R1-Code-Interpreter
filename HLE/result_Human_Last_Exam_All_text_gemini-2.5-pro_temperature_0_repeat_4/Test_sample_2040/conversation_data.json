    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Phenomenon - Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)**\n\n*   **Definition:** SPDC is a nonlinear optical process where one high-energy photon (the \"pump\" photon) spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons) within a nonlinear medium.\n*   **Governing Physics:** This process is a second-order nonlinear effect. The interaction is described by the second-order term in the expansion of the material's polarization (P) in response to an electric field (E):  \n    $P_i = \\epsilon_0 \\sum_j \\chi^{(1)}_{ij} E_j + \\epsilon_0 \\sum_{jk} \\chi^{(2)}_{ijk} E_j E_k + ...$\n*   **Fundamental Requirement:** For SPDC to occur, the material must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as **χ⁽²⁾**.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Physical Requirement (χ⁽²⁾ ≠ 0) to Material Properties**\n\n*   **Symmetry Constraint:** A fundamental principle of physics dictates that the properties of a material must respect its underlying crystal symmetry.\n*   **Inversion Symmetry:** For a material with inversion symmetry (a centrosymmetric material), applying an inversion operation (r → -r) leaves the crystal structure unchanged.\n*   **Effect on χ⁽²⁾:** In a centrosymmetric material, an inversion of the coordinate system causes the electric field vector to flip sign (E → -E) and the polarization vector to flip sign (P → -P). However, the product of two electric field components (EⱼEₖ) does not change sign: ((-Eⱼ)(-Eₖ)) = EⱼEₖ.\n    For the second-order polarization equation ($P_i^{(2)} = \\epsilon_0 \\sum_{jk} \\chi^{(2)}_{ijk} E_j E_k$) to hold true under inversion, we must have:\n    $-P_i^{(2)} = \\epsilon_0 \\sum_{jk} \\chi^{(2)}_{ijk} E_j E_k$\n    This can only be satisfied if the second-order susceptibility tensor **χ⁽²⁾ is identically zero**.\n*   **Conclusion for this step:** A material can only exhibit second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC if it **lacks inversion symmetry** (i.e., it is non-centrosymmetric).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure and Symmetry of Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets**\n\n*   **Nature of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene):** Unlike graphene, which has a single, highly stable honeycomb structure, borophene is polymorphic. This means it can exist in many different atomic arrangements (phases), which have been predicted theoretically and several have been synthesized on substrates.\n*   **\"Free-standing\" Condition:** The question specifies \"free-standing,\" which means we must consider the intrinsic symmetry of the 2D sheet itself, without the influence of a substrate that could break symmetry.\n*   **Symmetry of Common Borophene Phases:** We need to examine the crystal structures of the most stable and commonly studied phases of free-standing borophene.\n    *   **β₁₂-borophene:** This phase has a 2D space group of *pmmn* (No. 59). This space group contains an inversion center. Therefore, β₁₂-borophene is **centrosymmetric**.\n    *   **χ₃-borophene:** This phase has a 2D space group of *cmm* (No. 65). This space group also contains an inversion center. Therefore, χ₃-borophene is **centrosymmetric**.\n    *   **Striped-borophene:** This is another common phase, which also belongs to the *pmmn* space group and is thus **centrosymmetric**.\n*   **Conclusion for this step:** The most stable and commonly referenced phases of free-standing boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Findings to Answer the Question**\n\n1.  SPDC requires a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  A non-zero χ⁽²⁾ is only possible in non-centrosymmetric materials.\n3.  The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Therefore, their intrinsic χ⁽²⁾ is zero.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** Based on the centrosymmetric nature of their most stable crystal structures, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real Material:** The analysis assumes an ideal, infinite, defect-free crystal. In a real, finite-sized nanosheet, the edges, as well as any defects or strain, can locally break the inversion symmetry. This could lead to a very weak, localized SPDC signal, but the bulk, intrinsic property of the material would not support it. The question asks what is \"expected,\" which points to the intrinsic bulk property.\n2.  **Polymorphism:** While the most common phases are centrosymmetric, it is theoretically possible that other, less stable, non-centrosymmetric phases of borophene could exist. However, without specific synthesis of such a phase, the general expectation for \"boron nanosheets\" is based on the common forms.\n3.  **SPDC vs. Other Processes:** The absence of SPDC (a χ⁽²⁾ process) does not mean the material is optically inactive. All materials have a non-zero third-order susceptibility (χ⁽³⁾). Therefore, boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit third-order nonlinear effects, such as spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), which can also be used to generate photon pairs. The question is specifically about SPDC.\n\n<<<No>>>"
