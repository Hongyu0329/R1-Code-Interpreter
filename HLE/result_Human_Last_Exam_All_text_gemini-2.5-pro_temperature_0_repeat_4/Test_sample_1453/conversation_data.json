    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Principles of Coiled-Coil Structure**\n\nCoiled-coils are protein structural motifs where two or more alpha-helices are coiled together like a rope. Their stability and oligomeric state (the number of helices) are primarily determined by the packing of amino acid side chains in the core of the structure.\n\n*   **Heptad Repeat:** Coiled-coils have a characteristic repeating sequence of seven amino acids, denoted by the positions `(a b c d e f g)n`.\n*   **Hydrophobic Core:** Positions `a` and `d` are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues (like Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Alanine, Methionine). These residues face inward and form the hydrophobic core that holds the helices together.\n*   **Solvent-Exposed Positions:** Positions `b`, `c`, and `f` are typically polar or charged and are exposed to the solvent.\n*   **Inter-helical Interactions:** Positions `e` and `g` are often charged residues that can form stabilizing salt bridges between adjacent helices.\n*   **Knobs-into-Holes Packing:** The side chains from the `a` and `d` positions (the \"knobs\") of one helix pack into spaces (the \"holes\") created by the side chains on the neighboring helix/helices. The efficiency of this packing is a major determinant of the oligomeric state.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Given Sequence**\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to find the correct `a-g` phasing by aligning the hydrophobic residues into the `a` and `d` positions. Let's look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues spaced 3-4 residues apart (`a-x-x-d`). The most prominent hydrophobic residues in the sequence are I, A, L, and W.\n\nLet's test a phasing where Alanine (A) is at the `a` position and Leucine (L) is at the `d` position. This is a common motif.\n\n*   Sequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n*   Let's assign position `a` to the first `A` at residue 4.\n*   This creates the following assignment for the entire sequence (ignoring the flanking G's which may not be part of the helical structure):\n\n| Position | 1 | 2 | 3 | **4** | 5 | 6 | **7** | 8 | 9 | 10 | **11** | 12 | 13 | **14** | 15 | 16 | 17 | **18** | 19 | 20 | **21** | 22 | 23 | 24 | **25** | 26 | 27 | **28** | 29 | 30 |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| Residue | G | E | I | **A** | Q | S | **L** | K | E | I | **A** | K | S | **L** | K | E | I | **A** | W | S | **L** | K | E | I | **A** | Q | S | **L** | K | G |\n| Heptad Pos | f | g | a | **b** | c | d | **e** | f | g | a | **b** | c | d | **e** | f | g | a | **b** | c | d | **e** | f | g | a | **b** | c | d | **e** | f | g |\n\nThis phasing does not work, as it places `A` at `b` and `L` at `e`. Let's try another phasing.\n\nLet's try the phasing `...A(a) Q(b) S(c) L(d)...`.\n\n*   Sequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n*   Let's assign position `a` to `A(4)` and `d` to `L(7)`.\n\n| Position | 1 | 2 | 3 | **4** | 5 | 6 | **7** | 8 | 9 | 10 | **11** | 12 | 13 | **14** | 15 | 16 | 17 | **18** | 19 | 20 | **21** | 22 | 23 | 24 | **25** | 26 | 27 | **28** | 29 | 30 |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| Residue | G | E | I | **A** | Q | S | **L** | K | E | I | **A** | K | S | **L** | K | E | I | **A** | W | S | **L** | K | E | I | **A** | Q | S | **L** | K | G |\n| Heptad Pos | c | d | e | **a** | b | c | **d** | e | f | g | **a** | b | c | **d** | e | f | g | **a** | b | c | **d** | e | f | g | **a** | b | c | **d** | e | f |\n\nThis phasing is much more consistent. Let's analyze the core positions:\n*   **`a` positions (4, 11, 18, 25):** All are Alanine (A).\n*   **`d` positions (7, 14, 21, 28):** All are Leucine (L).\n\nThis gives a very regular `a=Ala`, `d=Leu` core, which is a classic coiled-coil motif. (Note: The `W` at position 19 falls into a `b` position, which is unusual but doesn't negate the overwhelming `A-x-x-L` pattern).\n\n**Step 3: Relate Core Residue Composition to Oligomeric State**\n\nThe size and shape of the residues at the `a` and `d` positions dictate the most stable packing arrangement.\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Dimeric coiled-coils have what is called \"perpendicular\" packing. This geometry is most efficient when the `a` position is occupied by a small residue (like Alanine) and the `d` position is occupied by a larger hydrophobic residue (like Leucine). The small `a` knobs pack neatly against each other, and the larger `d` knobs also pack efficiently. The `a=Ala`, `d=Leu` pattern is the canonical signature of a dimeric coiled-coil.\n\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Trimeric coiled-coils have \"acute\" packing. This arrangement is favored when both `a` and `d` positions are occupied by large hydrophobic residues (e.g., Leucine, Isoleucine). If the `a` position were filled with a small residue like Alanine, it would create a void or hole in the center of the three-helix bundle, leading to poor packing and instability.\n\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Tetrameric coiled-coils often have a different packing logic, sometimes forming a \"dimer of dimers\". A common tetrameric motif involves having hydrophobic residues at `a` and polar residues at `d`. The sequence here (`a=Ala`, `d=Leu`) does not fit the typical tetrameric pattern and is optimized for a dimer.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence analysis reveals a consistent heptad repeat with Alanine (a small hydrophobic residue) at all `a` positions and Leucine (a large hydrophobic residue) at all `d` positions. This specific combination of core residues provides the most efficient and stable \"knobs-into-holes\" packing for a **dimeric** (2-helix) coiled-coil.\n\n<<<A>>>"
