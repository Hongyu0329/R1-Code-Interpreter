    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Curve of Genus 2:** A smooth algebraic curve whose topological structure is a torus with two holes.\n*   **Stable Reduction:** The Stable Reduction Theorem by Deligne and Mumford states that any degenerating family of curves can be transformed, after a technical step called a base change, into a new family whose special (degenerate) fiber is a \"stable curve\".\n*   **Stable Curve:** A connected projective curve of arithmetic genus $g \\ge 2$ is called stable if its only singularities are nodes (ordinary double points) and its automorphism group is finite.\n*   **\"Types of Stable Reduction\":** This phrase asks for the number of distinct combinatorial (or topological) types of singular stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. These types correspond to the different strata in the boundary of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space of genus 2 curves, $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_2$.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Mathematical Conditions for a Stable Curve of Genus 2\n\nA stable curve $C$ of arithmetic genus 2 can be described by its **dual graph**.\n*   **Vertices:** Represent the irreducible components of the curve. Each vertex is weighted by the geometric genus of its component.\n*   **Edges:** Represent the nodes connecting different components.\n*   **Loops:** Represent self-nodes on a single component.\n\nThe conditions for a graph to represent a stable curve of genus 2 are:\n1.  **Genus Formula:** The arithmetic genus $p_a(C)$ must be 2. The formula is:\n    $p_a(C) = \\sum g_i + \\delta - k + 1 = 2$\n    where $g_i$ are the genera of the components, $\\delta$ is the total number of nodes (edges + loops), and $k$ is the number of components (vertices).\n2.  **Connectivity:** The curve must be connected, meaning its dual graph is connected.\n3.  **Stability Condition:** The automorphism group of the curve must be finite. This translates to conditions on the components:\n    *   Any smooth rational component ($g=0$) must have at least 3 special points (nodes).\n    *   Any smooth elliptic component ($g=1$) must have at least 1 special point.\n    *   Any singular rational component (e.g., with a self-node) must have enough special points on its normalization to ensure a finite automorphism group. For a normalization to $\\mathbb{P}^1$, this means at least 3 special points (where a self-node counts as 2 points).\n\n### Step 3: Classify the Types Based on the Number of Components ($k$)\n\nA key insight is that a stable curve of genus 2 can have at most 2 components. A proof of this shows that for $k \\ge 3$, the stability condition and the genus formula cannot be simultaneously satisfied. We therefore only need to analyze the cases $k=1$ and $k=2$.\n\n#### Case 1: Irreducible Curves ($k=1$)\nThe curve has one component of geometric genus $g_1$ and $\\delta$ self-nodes.\nThe genus formula becomes: $g_1 + \\delta - 1 + 1 = 2 \\implies g_1 + \\delta = 2$.\n*   **Type 1:** If $g_1 = 1$, then $\\delta = 1$. This is an irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node. This is stable.\n*   **Type 2:** If $g_1 = 0$, then $\\delta = 2$. This is an irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 (a rational curve) with two nodes. This is stable, as its normalization has 4 special points.\n\n#### Case 2: Reducible Curves with Two Components ($k=2$)\nThe curve has two components, $C_1$ and $C_2$, with genera $g_1$ and $g_2$.\nThe genus formula becomes: $g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 2 + 1 = 2 \\implies g_1 + g_2 + \\delta = 3$.\nWe analyze the possibilities based on whether the components are smooth or singular.\n\n*   **Subcase 2a: Both components are smooth.**\n    All nodes connect the two components.\n    *   **Type 3:** Let $(g_1, g_2) = (1, 1)$. The formula gives $\\delta=1$. This describes two elliptic curves connected at a single node. Each component has one special point, so the configuration is stable.\n    *   **Type 4:** Let $(g_1, g_2) = (0, 0)$. The formula gives $\\delta=3$. This describes two rational curves connected by three nodes. Each component has three special points, so the configuration is stable.\n    *   Other combinations, like $(g_1, g_2) = (0, 1)$, lead to unstable components. For $(0,1)$, $\\delta=2$, so the rational component would only have 2 special points.\n\n*   **Subcase 2b: At least one component is singular (has a self-node).**\n    *   **Type 5:** Consider one singular component. Let $C_1$ have one self-node, and let it be connected to a smooth $C_2$ by one node. The total number of nodes is $\\delta=2$ (one self-node, one connecting node). The genus formula is $g_1 + g_2 + 2 = 3 \\implies g_1 + g_2 = 1$. The only stable possibility is $(g_1, g_2) = (0, 1)$.\n        *   *Configuration:* A rational curve with one self-node ($C_1$) is connected to a smooth elliptic curve ($C_2$) by one node.\n        *   *Stability Check:* The rational component $C_1$ has 3 special points on its normalization (2 from the self-node, 1 from the connection), so it's stable. The elliptic component $C_2$ has 1 special point, so it's stable. This is a valid type.\n\n    *   **Type 6:** Consider both components being singular. Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ each have one self-node, and let them be connected by one node. The total number of nodes is $\\delta=3$ (two self-nodes, one connecting node). The genus formula is $g_1 + g_2 + 3 = 3 \\implies g_1 + g_2 = 0$. This forces $(g_1, g_2) = (0, 0)$.\n        *   *Configuration:* Two rational curves, each with one self-node, are connected to each other by one node.\n        *   *Stability Check:* Each rational component has 3 special points on its normalization (2 from its self-node, 1 from the connection), so both are stable. This is a valid type.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nThe systematic analysis reveals 6 distinct combinatorial types of stable curves of genus 2.\n\n1.  An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node.\n2.  An irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 with two nodes.\n3.  Two smooth elliptic curves connected by one node.\n4.  Two smooth rational curves connected by three nodes.\n5.  A rational curve with one node connected to a smooth elliptic curve by one node.\n6.  Two rational curves, each with one node, connected to each other by one node.\n\nThese 6 types represent all possible stable degenerations of a genus 2 curve.\n\n<<<6>>>"
