    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor**, often denoted as *S(q, ω)*.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, also known as the Van Hove correlation function *G(r, t)*, describes the probability of finding a particle at a position *r* at time *t*, given that another particle was at the origin at time *t=0*. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space (*r*) and time (*t*) yields the dynamic structure factor, where *q* represents the momentum transfer and *ω* represents the energy transfer.\n\nThe dynamic structure factor is a crucial quantity in nuclear reactor physics and criticality safety. It is directly related to the double differential scattering cross-section, which quantifies the probability of a neutron scattering with a change in energy and direction. This information is essential for accurately modeling neutron transport and thermalization in materials used in nuclear reactors, such as moderators and fuels. The data derived from the dynamic structure factor, sometimes referred to as the \"scattering law,\" is used to generate nuclear data libraries for reactor analysis codes.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
