    "There are 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\nThe semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as $SD_{512}$, is defined by the presentation $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$. A power subgroup is a subgroup $H$ for which there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ consists of all the $k$-th powers of elements in $G$, denoted $G^k$. The number of distinct subgroups of this form must be determined.\n\nThe power subgroups can be analyzed based on the parity of the exponent $k$:\n\n1.  **When k is odd:** For any odd integer $k$, the mapping $g \\mapsto g^k$ is a bijection from the group $G$ to itself. This means that every element in $G$ is a $k$-th power of some other element in $G$. Consequently, the set of all $k$-th powers, $G^k$, is equal to the entire group $G$. Therefore, all odd values of $k$ yield only one distinct power subgroup, which is $G$ itself.\n\n2.  **When k is even:** For any even integer $k$, the set of $k$-th powers, $G^k$, forms a proper subgroup of $G$. The analysis of the element powers shows that for any even $k$, the resulting power subgroup is a cyclic subgroup generated by a power of $r$. Specifically, $G^k = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n    The distinct subgroups are determined by the possible values of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $k$ and 256. Since $k$ must be even, the possible values for $\\gcd(k, 256)$ are the even divisors of 256.\n    The divisors of 256 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$. The even divisors are:\n    *   2\n    *   4\n    *   8\n    *   16\n    *   32\n    *   64\n    *   128\n    *   256\n\n    Each of these 8 even divisors corresponds to a unique power subgroup: $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$, $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$, $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$, $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$, $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$, $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$, $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$, and $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup). These 8 subgroups are all distinct from each other, as they have different orders.\n\nCombining the two cases, we have one power subgroup from the odd exponents ($G$) and eight distinct power subgroups from the even exponents. The group $G$ is non-abelian, while the eight subgroups from the even case are all cyclic and thus abelian, so there is no overlap between the two sets.\n\nIn total, there are $1 + 8 = 9$ distinct power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
