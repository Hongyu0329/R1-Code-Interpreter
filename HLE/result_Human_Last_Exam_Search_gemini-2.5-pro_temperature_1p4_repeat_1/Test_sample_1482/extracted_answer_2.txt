The mathematical formulation that characterizes the vertical cross-sections of an Interval Type-3 Membership Function for a fixed primary input variable *x* and a secondary input variable *u*, using Gaussian-based membership paradigms for the lower and upper bounds, is given by the Upper Membership Function (UMF) and the Lower Membership Function (LMF) of the resulting Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Set.

The UMF is formulated as:
**μ̄<sub>A(x)</sub>(u) = exp [ - (1/2) * ( (u - m(x)) / σ<sub>u</sub> )<sup>2</sup> ]**

The LMF is formulated as:
**μ̲<sub>A(x)</sub>(u) = λ * exp [ - (1/2) * ( (x - m(x)) / σ<sub>u</sub>* )<sup>2</sup> ]**

where:
*   *u* is the secondary input variable.
*   *m(x)* is the mean of the Gaussian function, dependent on the primary input *x*.
*   σ<sub>u</sub> is the standard deviation of the UMF.
*   λ is a scaling parameter for the LMF, known as LowerScale (0 ≤ λ ≤ 1).
*   σ<sub>u</sub>* is the modified standard deviation for the LMF, calculated based on σ<sub>u</sub> and a LowerLag parameter, ℓ.
