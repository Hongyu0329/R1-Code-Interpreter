The exact residues from the human beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit are located within the conserved alpha-binding pocket of the guanylate kinase (GK) domain. While a comprehensive list of every critical residue from human-specific studies is not detailed in the provided results, the region is well-defined. For fine-tuning the gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit, the key identified hotspot residues on the human beta-1 subunit are a cluster of acidic amino acids on the surface of the GK domain: Aspartic Acid at position 349 (D349), Aspartic Acid at position 350 (D350), and Glutamic Acid at position 353 (E353).
