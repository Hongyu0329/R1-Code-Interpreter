    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology applicable to changes in the laws of nature for both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations at the Fall was Augustine of Hippo.\n\nThe key term Augustine developed is ***rationes seminales***, which translates to \"seminal reasons\" or \"seed principles.\" This concept, which he adapted from Stoic philosophy and integrated into a Christian framework, provides a sophisticated way to understand how God can work in extraordinary ways within the natural order He created.\n\nHere is how this terminology applies to both theological concepts:\n\n*   **Creation and Natural Law:** Augustine proposed that in the beginning, God did not create everything in its final form. Instead, He embedded \"seminal reasons\" into creation, which are the latent potentialities for all things that would later come into being. The regular, predictable unfolding of these potentials constitutes the ordinary course of nature, or what we would call natural laws.\n\n*   **The Fall:** According to Augustine, the Fall of Man corrupted not only human nature but also had consequences for the entire created order. This can be understood as a disordering or corruption of how the seminal reasons unfold, leading to disharmony, decay, disease, and hostility in nature. Humanity's relationship with nature changed from one of perfect harmony to one of toil and conflict.\n\n*   **Miracles and the Virgin Birth:** Augustine argued that a miracle is not something that goes against nature as God created it, but rather against nature *as we know it* (*contra quam est nota natura*). A miracle, like the virgin birth, is an event where God directly activates a seminal reason in a way that is outside the usual, post-Fall sequence of cause and effect. The virgin birth, therefore, was not a violation of the ultimate order of God's creation, but the enactment of a potentiality that God had embedded within creation from the beginning, brought forth at a specific time by His divine will.\n\nIn this framework, the *rationes seminales* provide a unified concept to explain the shift in nature's operation after the Fall and the occurrence of miracles like the virgin birth, which appear to us as alterations of natural law. While other theologians like Thomas Aquinas also developed important concepts like \"obediential potency,\" Augustine was the first to create this specific terminology of seminal reasons that directly describes a change within the fabric of natural laws themselves.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
