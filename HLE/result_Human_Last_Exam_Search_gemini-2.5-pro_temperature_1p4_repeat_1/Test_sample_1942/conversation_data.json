    "In the philosophy of Peter Sloterdijk, the State is not seen as a metaphor for a single, static anthroposphere but is rather conceptualized through several overlapping and historically evolving metaphors. These metaphors describe the State as a type of \"macrosphere\"—a large, collectively inhabited, and immunologically sealed environment. The primary metaphors Sloterdijk employs for the State as an anthroposphere are the **macro-uterus**, the **hothouse**, and the **ship of state**.\n\nSloterdijk's overarching project in his *Spheres* trilogy is to analyze the \"spaces of coexistence\" that humans create and inhabit. These \"spheres\" or \"anthropospheres\" are immunological bubbles that provide protection and a medium for life to unfold, ranging from the microsphere of the womb to the macrospheres of nations and states.\n\nOne of the foundational metaphors for these macrospheres, including the state, is the **macro-uterus**. Sloterdijk posits that humans are fundamentally beings who seek to recreate the primary comfort and security of the womb. Political structures like nations or states are thus analyzed as \"macro-uteri\"—large-scale attempts to build a protective and containing environment for their populations.\n\nAnother significant metaphor is that of the **hothouse** or **greenhouse**. Sloterdijk refers to the anthroposphere as a \"human hothouse,\" an artificial and climatically controlled space that enables human development by separating an \"inside\" from a hostile \"outside.\" This concept is extended to critique modern society, which he sees as striving to create an \"integral greenhouse of comfort\" for its privileged inhabitants, a space of controlled, artificial well-being. Politics, in this view, becomes a struggle for access to the most favorable \"immune technology.\"\n\nFurthermore, Sloterdijk famously revitalizes the classical metaphor of the **ship of state**, particularly in his book *Im selben Boot* (*In the Same Boat*). This ancient allegory, dating back to Plato, is used by Sloterdijk to discuss the challenges of hyper-politics in a globalized world and to model politics as \"the art of what is atmospherically possible.\" The ship represents a collective vessel navigating the \"monstrosity\" of the outside world, requiring a form of \"cybernetical\" steering.\n\nIn his later work, particularly in the third volume of *Spheres* titled *Foam*, Sloterdijk describes contemporary society as an agglomeration of individual bubbles or microspheres that together form a \"foam.\" From this perspective, the State is the larger container or framework within which these individual \"bubbles\" of existence coexist in a state of \"connected isolation.\"\n\nTherefore, for Sloterdijk, the State is a multifaceted anthroposphere, metaphorically understood as a large-scale immunological and atmospheric structure designed to protect and cultivate a population, akin to a macro-uterus, a hothouse, or a ship navigating dangerous waters.\n\n<<<The State is a metaphor for a macrosphere, which Sloterdijk illustrates through several interconnected concepts, most notably the **macro-uterus**, the **hothouse**, and the **ship of state**.>>>"
