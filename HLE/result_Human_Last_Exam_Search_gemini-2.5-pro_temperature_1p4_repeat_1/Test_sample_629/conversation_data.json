    "The trefoil knot is the simplest non-trivial knot and, like many knots, it is chiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image. The two forms are known as the left-hand trefoil and the right-hand trefoil. A grid diagram is a way to represent a knot on an n x n grid. The smallest integer 'n' for which a knot can be represented is called its grid number.\n\nFor the trefoil knot, the minimal grid number is 3. The question asks for the number of distinct 3x3 grid diagrams for the *left-hand* trefoil knot, considering translations and rotations as equivalent.\n\nBased on literature in knot theory, it is a known result that there are four minimal (3x3) grid diagrams for the trefoil knot in total. Two of these represent the right-hand trefoil, and two represent the left-hand trefoil. One source provides an image showing diagrams for both the left-handed and right-handed trefoils. Another source confirms there are only a certain number of distinct minimal diagrams for the trefoil.\n\nTherefore, the left-hand trefoil knot has 2 distinct grid diagrams with the minimal grid number of 3, up to translation and rotation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
