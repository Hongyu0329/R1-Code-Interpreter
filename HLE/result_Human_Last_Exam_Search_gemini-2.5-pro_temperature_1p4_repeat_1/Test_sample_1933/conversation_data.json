    "The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a set of classifiers measures the complexity of the class. It is defined as the size of the largest set of points that the classifiers can \"shatter\". A set of points is shattered by a class of classifiers if for every possible labeling of the points, there is a classifier in the class that produces that labeling.\n\nThe schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. The first-order logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ allows for formulas built from atomic formulas (like $P_i(x)$) using existential quantification ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ in this language with one free variable acts as a classifier. An element is classified as \"positive\" if it satisfies the formula. Any such formula is logically equivalent to a formula of the form $\\psi(x) \\land \\sigma$, where:\n*   $\\psi(x)$ is a quantifier-free formula, which in this logic must be a conjunction of atomic formulas: $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n*   $\\sigma$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables).\n\nFor any given model (a universe with interpretations for the predicates), the sentence $\\sigma$ is either true or false.\n*   If $\\sigma$ is false, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is false for all $x$, defining the empty set. The constant $\\bot$ also defines the empty set.\n*   If $\\sigma$ is true, the set defined by $\\phi(x)$ is the same as the set defined by $\\psi(x)$. The formula $\\top$ defines the entire universe of elements.\n\nTherefore, the concepts (subsets) we can define are intersections of the sets defined by the predicates $P_i$. Let $\\text{ext}(P_i)$ be the set of elements for which $P_i$ is true. The definable concepts are of the form $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} \\text{ext}(P_i)$ for any $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The case $I = \\emptyset$ corresponds to the entire universe.\n\nThe VC dimension is the largest integer $d$ for which there exists a set of $d$ points that can be shattered. We can choose the interpretations of the predicates to facilitate shattering.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nThe number of distinct concepts generated by intersections of 4 sets is at most $2^4 = 16$. To shatter a set of $d$ points, we need to be able to generate all $2^d$ possible subsets. If we try to shatter a set of 5 points, we would need to form $2^5 = 32$ subsets. Since our logic can only define at most 16 distinct concepts, it's impossible to shatter a set of 5 points. Thus, the VC dimension must be less than 5.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that a set of 4 points can be shattered. Let $X = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4\\}$ be a set of four points. We define the extensions of the four predicates on these points as follows:\n$P_i(u_j)$ is true if and only if $i \\neq j$.\n\nNow, for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we need to find a formula that is true for all points in $Y$ and false for all points in $X \\setminus Y$. Let's define the index set $I_Y = \\{i \\mid u_i \\notin Y\\}$. The corresponding concept is formed by the formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_Y} P_i(x)$.\n\nAn element $u_k \\in X$ satisfies $\\phi_Y(x)$ if and only if $P_i(u_k)$ is true for all $i \\in I_Y$. By our definition of the predicates, this means $i \\neq k$ for all $i$ such that $u_i \\notin Y$. This condition holds if and only if $k$ is not in the set $\\{i \\mid u_i \\notin Y\\}$, which is equivalent to saying $u_k \\in Y$.\n\nThus, for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, the formula $\\phi_Y(x)$ defines precisely that subset. This shows that the set $X$ can be shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\nSince the VC dimension is at least 4 and at most 4, it is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
