    "To determine the central pixel of a line between (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, a step-by-step calculation is performed. Bresenham's algorithm is a method used in computer graphics to approximate a straight line on a grid of pixels. It operates using integer arithmetic, making it efficient.\n\nThe algorithm begins by calculating the change in x (Δx) and the change in y (Δy) between the two endpoints.\n*   Δx = 11 - 1 = 10\n*   Δy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\nA decision parameter is then initialized to guide the path of the line. Following the standard formula for the algorithm, the pixels along the line are determined incrementally. For the line from (1,1) to (11,5), the calculated pixels are:\n(1,1), (2,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,4), (9,4), (10,5), and (11,5).\n\nThis sequence consists of 11 pixels. The central pixel is the sixth one in this list.\n\n<<<The coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).>>>"
