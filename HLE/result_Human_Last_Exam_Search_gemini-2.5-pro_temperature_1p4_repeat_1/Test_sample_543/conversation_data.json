    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing THF, followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the substitution of all three halogen atoms with phenyl groups.\n\nThe reactivity of aryl halides with Grignard reagents generally follows the order I > Br > Cl. Therefore, the iodine atom is the most reactive and will be replaced first. Given the excess of the Grignard reagent and the reflux conditions (heating), the two less reactive bromine atoms will also be substituted. This type of reaction is a cross-coupling reaction, often referred to as a Kumada coupling, which typically uses a nickel or palladium catalyst. However, uncatalyzed couplings with aryl iodides and bromides can occur, especially under forcing conditions like reflux. One example showed no reaction between a bromothiophene and a Grignard reagent at room temperature without a catalyst, indicating the need for heat or a catalyst for less reactive halides.\n\nThe step-by-step substitution is as follows:\n1.  **First substitution:** 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene reacts with phenyl magnesium bromide to replace the iodine, forming 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n2.  **Second and third substitutions:** Due to the excess phenyl magnesium bromide and refluxing THF, the two bromine atoms on 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene are subsequently replaced by phenyl groups.\n\nThe final product is a benzene ring with three phenyl substituents located at positions 1, 2, and 3. The aqueous work-up serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent.\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature rules for polysubstituted benzene rings, the substituents are identified and numbered to give the lowest possible locants, and then listed alphabetically before the parent name \"benzene\". In this case, all three substituents are phenyl groups.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name of the final product is **1,2,3-triphenylbenzene**.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
