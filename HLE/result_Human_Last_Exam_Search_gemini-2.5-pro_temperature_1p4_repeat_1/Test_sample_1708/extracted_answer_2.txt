The order type of the set of finite strings over the alphabet $\{a, b, c, d\}$ ordered lexicographically is a countable, total order with a minimum element (the empty string) and no maximum element. It is not a well-ordering (and thus not an ordinal number) and it is not a dense ordering. While it does not have a simple name like $\omega$ or $\eta$, it is uniquely defined by these properties and its recursive nature.
