The laboratory's critical mistake was believing the quality control (QC) results for Batch 3 were valid, despite a fatal flaw in its preparation. The error originated when Person B added the antibiotic chloramphenicol to the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) *before* autoclaving the batch.

Here is a breakdown of the errors:

*   **Improper Preparation of Batch 3:** Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that can be degraded by the high heat and pressure of an autoclave. While some sources indicate it is heat-stable, studies show that autoclaving can result in a loss of potency, with degradation rates reported from 8% to 15%. The standard and correct procedure is to autoclave the agar medium first, cool it to a safe temperature (around 45-50Â°C), and then aseptically add the heat-sensitive antibiotic. By adding the chloramphenicol before autoclaving, Person B unknowingly inactivated or significantly reduced the antibiotic's effectiveness in Batch 3.

*   **Flawed Interpretation of the QC Results:** The laboratory performed a quality check using *Bacillus subtilis*, a bacterium. The purpose of adding chloramphenicol to PDA is to inhibit the growth of bacteria, allowing only yeast and mold to grow. When the QC plates showed no growth of *Bacillus subtilis*, the lab interpreted this "expected result" as proof that the antibiotic was active and the media was of good quality. However, they failed to recognize that this test could not reveal the compromised state of Batch 3.

*   **Contamination Event:** The error in preparation was exposed when the PDA bottles were left open to room air for six hours. This allowed airborne, spore-forming bacteria, likely a hardy *Bacillus* species, to contaminate the media.

*   **The Final Outcome:** In the experiment, the bacterial spores from the air were able to germinate and grow in the PDA from Batch 3 because the chloramphenicol had been rendered ineffective by autoclaving. In contrast, Batches 1 and 2, which were presumably prepared correctly, still contained active chloramphenicol that successfully inhibited the growth of the same airborne bacteria. The appearance of gram-positive rods with spores, a characteristic of *Bacillus* species, further points to an airborne contaminant that should have been controlled.

In essence, the laboratory trusted a QC test that was not fit for its purpose. The test confirmed their expectation (no bacterial growth) but failed to detect the underlying reason Batch 3 was compromised, leading them to mistakenly believe it was safe to use.
