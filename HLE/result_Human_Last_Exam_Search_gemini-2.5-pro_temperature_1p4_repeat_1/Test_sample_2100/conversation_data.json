    "The man described is Nikolai Rezanov. Andrei Voznesensky immortalized Rezanov's story in his poetry, which formed the basis for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n\nThe opera and poems are based on the real-life journey of Rezanov, a Russian nobleman and one of the leaders of the first Russian circumnavigation expedition. He commanded the ships \"Juno\" and \"Avos\". The description \"a joy-discovering sailor\" alludes to his role as an explorer.\n\nThe question \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" refers to the fact that Rezanov's original grave in Krasnoyarsk was destroyed by the Bolsheviks. For many years, its exact location was lost. In the late 20th century, following renewed interest in his story, his remains were located. A memorial was dedicated at his gravesite in the Trinity churchyard of Krasnoyarsk in October 2000. This event included a symbolic reunion, where earth from the grave of his beloved, Concepción Argüello, was placed on his tomb.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
