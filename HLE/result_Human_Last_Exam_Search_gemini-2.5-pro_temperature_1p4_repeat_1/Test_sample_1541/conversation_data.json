    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem, along with the calculation for the total memory used by its variables.\n\n### Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\nThe optimal approach is to read the input string one character at a time, count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4), and then construct the output string from these counts. This avoids allocating a large buffer to store the input string.\n\nTo further minimize memory, we use the smallest possible standard C data types for each variable that can safely hold the required range of values.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program rearranges the summands in a given sum string to be in \n * non-decreasing order. The summands are only numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n *\n * The solution uses a counting sort algorithm. It reads the input character\n * by character to avoid storing the entire string in memory. It counts the \n * frequency of each number and then prints them in sorted order.\n *\n * To achieve maximum memory efficiency, the smallest standard data types\n * sufficient for the variables' ranges are used.\n */\nint main() {\n    /*\n     * == Variable Declaration and Memory Analysis ==\n     *\n     * The goal is to calculate the total memory 'm' used by variables. We assume\n     * a standard environment where:\n     * sizeof(char) = 1 byte\n     * sizeof(short int) = 2 bytes\n     * sizeof(int) = 4 bytes\n     */\n\n    // counts: Stores the frequency of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    // The input string length is at most 1000. The maximum number of summands\n    // (e.g., in \"1+1+...+1\") is 500. So, a count can be up to 500.\n    // `unsigned char` (max 255) is not enough.\n    // `unsigned short int` (max 65535) is sufficient and memory-efficient.\n    // Memory: 4 * sizeof(unsigned short int) = 4 * 2 = 8 bytes.\n    unsigned short int counts[4] = {0, 0, 0, 0};\n\n    // ch: Stores the character read by getchar().\n    // It must be an `int` to hold the special `EOF` (End Of File) value.\n    // Memory: sizeof(int) = 4 bytes.\n    int ch;\n\n    // i: Loop counter for iterating through the `counts` array (indices 0-3).\n    // The range 0-3 fits within a `char`.\n    // Memory: sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char i;\n\n    // j: Loop counter for printing each number `counts[i]` times.\n    // The loop can run up to 500 times. `char` is not sufficient.\n    // `unsigned short int` is the most memory-efficient choice.\n    // Memory: sizeof(unsigned short int) = 2 bytes.\n    unsigned short int j;\n\n    /* Total Memory (m) = 8 (counts) + 4 (ch) + 1 (i) + 2 (j) = 15 bytes. */\n\n\n    // Read input character by character and update counts\n    while ((ch = getchar()) != '\\n' && ch != EOF) {\n        if (ch >= '1' && ch <= '4') {\n            counts[ch - '1']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // -- Print the sorted sum --\n    // This logic avoids using an extra flag variable for the first element.\n\n    // Find the first type of number that exists in the input\n    i = 0;\n    while (i < 4 && counts[i] == 0) {\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // Check if any number was found\n    if (i < 4) {\n        // Print the very first number\n        putchar(i + '1');\n        counts[i]--; // Decrement its count\n\n        // Loop through all number types (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s) starting from the current one\n        for (; i < 4; i++) {\n            // Print the remaining numbers of the current type, each preceded by a '+'\n            for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n                putchar('+');\n                putchar(i + '1');\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Print a final newline character\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory **m** is the sum of the memory allocated for all variables in the `main` function. Based on the analysis in the code comments:\n\n*   **`unsigned short int counts[4]`**: 4 elements * 2 bytes/element = 8 bytes\n*   **`int ch`**: 4 bytes\n*   **`char i`**: 1 byte\n*   **`unsigned short int j`**: 2 bytes\n\nTotal memory m = 8 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 15 bytes.\n\n<<<15>>>"
