    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step reduction of the given SKI combinator expression. The expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nFirst, let's identify the basic combinators and some common composed combinators that represent Church numerals and arithmetic operations.\n\n*   `S = λx.λy.λz. xz(yz)`\n*   `K = λx.λy. x`\n*   `I = λx. x`\n\nFrom these, we can derive arithmetic for Church numerals. A Church numeral `n` is a function that takes a function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x` `n` times (`f^n(x)`).\n\n1.  **Church Numerals:**\n    *   The Church numeral for **one (1)** is `λf.λx. f(x)`, which is equivalent to the **`I`** combinator.\n    *   The Church numeral for **two (2)** can be written as `S(I)(I)`. Let's verify this: `S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x = f(f(x)) = f²(x)`. This is correct.\n\n2.  **Multiplication Combinator (`MULT`):**\n    *   The expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` acts as a multiplication operator for Church numerals. Let's call it `MULT`. When applied to two Church numerals, `m` and `n`, `MULT m n` results in the Church numeral for `m * n`.\n\n3.  **Successor Combinator (`SUCC`):**\n    *   The expression `S(I)` acts as the successor function when applied to a Church numeral. If `n_c` is a Church numeral for the integer `n`, then `S(I) n_c` results in the Church numeral for `n+1`. Let's verify this: `S(I) n f x = I f (n f) x = f(n f x) = f(f^n(x)) = f^(n+1)(x)`. This is correct.\n\nNow we can substitute these into the original expression for clarity. Let's call the full expression `E`.\n\n`E = S(I) ( S(I) ( S(I) ( K(MULT I) ) (MULT (S(I)(I))) ) )`\n\nUsing our defined aliases:\n`E = SUCC ( SUCC ( SUCC ( (K(MULT ONE)) (MULT TWO) ) ) )`\n\nNow we must evaluate the innermost expression, keeping in mind that combinator application is left-associative (i.e., `f g x` means `(f g) x`).\n\nThe innermost term is `Z = (S(I) (K(MULT ONE))) (MULT TWO)`.\n\n1.  Let's simplify `MULT ONE`. This is the function that multiplies a number by one, which is the identity function. So, `MULT ONE` is equivalent to `I`.\n2.  Our term `Z` becomes: `(S(I) (K I)) (MULT TWO)`.\n3.  Let's evaluate the part in the first parenthesis: `G = S(I) (K I)`. To understand what `G` does, we apply it to an arbitrary argument `h`:\n    `G h = (S I (K I)) h = I h (K I h)` (by the definition of S)\n    `= h (I)` (since `I h = h` and `K I h = I`)\n    So, `G h = h I`. The combinator `G` takes a function `h` and applies it to `I`.\n4.  Now we can evaluate `Z = G (MULT TWO)`. This is `(MULT TWO) I`.\n5.  `(MULT TWO) I` means \"apply the 'multiply by two' function to the number 'one'\". The result is `2 * 1 = 2`.\n    So, the entire innermost expression `Z` reduces to the Church numeral **two (2)**.\n\nNow we can substitute this result back into the main expression `E`:\n`E = SUCC ( SUCC ( SUCC (TWO) ) )`\n\nThis is a series of successor operations:\n*   `SUCC(TWO)` results in the Church numeral **three (3)**.\n*   `SUCC(THREE)` results in the Church numeral **four (4)**.\n*   `SUCC(FOUR)` is not in the expression. The expression is `SUCC(SUCC(2))`.\n    *   `SUCC(2) = 3`\n    *   `SUCC(3) = 4`\n\nWait, `E = SUCC(SUCC(Z))`, where `Z = SUCC(TWO)` is wrong. Let's re-read the parentheses:\n`E = SUCC(SUCC(Z))` where `Z` is the result of the innermost part.\nLet `Z_1 = (S(I) (K(MULT I))) (MULT TWO)`. We found `Z_1=2`.\nThe expression is `E = S(I) (S(I) (Z_1))`.\n*   `S(I) (Z_1)` is `SUCC(TWO)`, which gives **THREE (3)**.\n*   Now we have `E = S(I) (THREE)`.\n*   `S(I) (THREE)` is `SUCC(THREE)`, which gives **FOUR (4)**.\n\nSo, the Church integer `n` represented by the expression is 4.\n\nThe final question is to calculate `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(4) = 2`.\n\n<<<2>>>"
