    "An integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings can represent an infinite number of elements of the homology cobordism group. The knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot, the trefoil knot, and the figure-eight knot.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the number of homology cobordism elements each of these knots can represent:\n\n*   **The Unknot (0₁):** An integral surgery on the unknot with a coefficient of *n* results in a lens space, L(n,1). For this to be an integral homology 3-sphere, which is a necessary condition for its cobordism class to be an element of the homology cobordism group, the absolute value of the surgery coefficient *n* must be 1. Both +1 and -1 surgery on the unknot yield the 3-sphere (S³), which represents the trivial element in the homology cobordism group. Thus, the unknot represents exactly one element.\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot (3₁):** The trefoil knot is a type of torus knot and exists in two forms that are not equivalent: a right-handed version and a left-handed version. It has been demonstrated that for both the right-handed and left-handed trefoil knots, performing integral surgeries with different integer coefficients results in an infinite number of distinct homology cobordism classes. For example, the Poincaré homology sphere, created by +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot, is known to have an infinite order in the homology cobordism group. The homology cobordism classes generated by the right-handed and left-handed trefoils are also distinct from each other.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its own mirror image. Surgeries on the figure-eight knot are known to produce an infinite number of distinct homology cobordism classes. For instance, while +1 and -1 surgeries on this knot yield the same manifold, other integral surgeries generally produce distinct manifolds that belong to different homology cobordism classes. The 0-surgery on the figure-eight knot, for example, is homology cobordant to the 0-surgery on a different knot, indicating it represents a non-trivial element.\n\nIn summary, since both the left-handed and right-handed trefoil knots, as well as the figure-eight knot, each generate an infinite number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group, the total number of elements that can be represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings is infinite.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
