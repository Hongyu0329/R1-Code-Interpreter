    "**Information regarding the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 is not readily available in accessible online records.**\n\nWhile historical records confirm that the free royal town of Bártfa had the privilege of electing its own judge and town council during the 15th century, the specific individual who held the position of judge in the year 1461 is not mentioned in the available digital archives and historical summaries.\n\nSince 1376, Bártfa enjoyed the right to freely elect its magistrate, and a town statute from 1467 further detailed the election procedures for the judge and council members. This indicates a structured civic administration was in place at the time. Historical accounts from 1461 do mention the town and its citizens. For instance, in July of that year, the people of Bártfa were recorded as having participated in the siege of Sáros Castle. This activity underscores the town's engagement in the political and military affairs of the period, which would have been overseen by its elected officials.\n\nDetailed information, including the names of town officials for specific years, is most likely contained within the physical town archives of Bardejov or in specialized academic publications such as Mária Fedorčáková's book, \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. The Administration of the Town of Bardejov in the Middle Ages (1320–1526),\" which are not fully accessible online. Therefore, without direct access to these primary sources, the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 remains elusive.\n\n<<<I was unable to find the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461.>>>"
