    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat, symbolizing his shifting and fearful mentality, are mentioned on five separate occasions.\n\nThe overcoat is first introduced in the opening line of the story, establishing it as a key part of his official uniform as he walks across the market square. The subsequent descriptions of him taking it off and putting it back on coincide with his vacillating opinions regarding a dog bite incident, depending on the perceived social status of the dog's owner.\n\nThe instances of the coat being described are as follows:\n*   He is first seen wearing his new overcoat.\n*   When it is suggested the dog belongs to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov feels hot and asks for his coat to be taken off.\n*   Upon hearing the dog is not the General's, he feels a sudden chill and asks for his coat to be put back on.\n*   When the General's cook confirms the dog isn't the General's, he again complains of the heat and says he will take it off.\n*   Finally, after learning the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov wraps his greatcoat around himself and walks away.\n\nThese repeated actions serve to visually represent his \"chameleon-like\" nature, as he changes his stance to suit the powerful. His physical discomfort and the resulting adjustments to his clothing mirror his internal anxiety and obsequiousness.\n\n<<<5>>>"
