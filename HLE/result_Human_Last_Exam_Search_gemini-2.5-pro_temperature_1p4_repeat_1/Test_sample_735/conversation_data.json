    "A paper by Chimere S. Anabanti and Sarah B. Hart titled \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3\" proves that any finite group containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 must have an order of at most 24. This result confirms the completeness of a previously compiled list of such groups.\n\nA subsequent paper by the same authors, \"Groups Containing Small Locally Maximal Product-Free Sets,\" provides a comprehensive table of all such groups and their corresponding product-free sets of size 3. By counting the distinct groups listed in this table, we can determine the total number.\n\nThe groups listed are:\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** C6, C8, C9, C10, C12, C15, C16, C18, C20, C24\n*   **Dihedral Groups:** D6 (isomorphic to S3), D8, D10, D12, D14, D16, D20, D22, D24\n*   **Quaternion and Dicyclic Groups:** Q8, Dic3 (Q12), Q16, Q24 (Dic6)\n*   **Abelian Groups (Direct Products):** C2 × C4, C3 × C3, C2 × C6, C4 × C4, C2 × C8, C2 × C2 × C4, C2 × C12, C3 × C8, C4 × C6, C2 × C2 × C6\n*   **Other Groups:** A4 (Alternating group), S4 (Symmetric group), QD16 (Quasidihedral group), C3 × D6, F20 (Frobenius group), C2 × D12, C3 × Q8, C4 × D6, SL(2,3), C3 × A4\n\nAfter careful enumeration and removal of duplicates (A4 and S4 are listed more than once in the original table), there are 42 distinct finite groups.\n\n<<<42>>>"
