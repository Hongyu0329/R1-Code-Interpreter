(a) True. Every coadjoint orbit \( \mathcal{O}_{\lambda} \) of a compact semisimple Lie group \( G \) is a homogeneous space of the form \( G/G_\lambda \), where the stabilizer \( G_\lambda \) is the centralizer of a torus. Such spaces are known as generalized flag manifolds. It is a classical result that generalized flag manifolds admit a \( G \)-invariant complex structure which, together with the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau symplectic form, endows \( \mathcal{O}_{\lambda} \) with the structure of a KÃ¤hler manifold.

(b) No. The second Betti number, \( b_2(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}) \), depends on the stabilizer subgroup \( G_{\lambda} \), which is determined by \( \lambda \). For \( G = \operatorname{SU}(n) \), a coadjoint orbit is a partial flag manifold \( \operatorname{SU}(n)/S(U(n_1) \times \dots \times U(n_k)) \), where \( n_1 + \dots + n_k = n \). The second Betti number of this space is \( k-1 \). If \( \lambda \) is regular (in the interior of the Weyl alcove), then the orbit is the full flag manifold with \(k=n\), and \(b_2(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}) = n-1\). However, if \( \lambda \) is singular (on the boundary of the Weyl alcove), \( k < n \), and therefore \( b_2(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}) < n-1 \). For example, for \( G = \operatorname{SU}(3) \), the coadjoint orbit corresponding to a singular weight is the complex projective plane \( \mathbb{CP}^2 \). In this case, \(n=3\) and \(b_2(\mathbb{CP}^2)=1\), which is not equal to \(n-1=2\).

(c) No. The cohomology ring of a GKM graph describes the \( T \)-equivariant cohomology of the manifold, \( H_T^*(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}; \mathbb{R}) \), where \( T \) is the maximal torus. The question asks about the \( G \)-equivariant cohomology ring \( H_G^*(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}; \mathbb{R}) \). There is a natural restriction homomorphism, the Kirwan map \( \kappa: H_G^*(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}) \to H_T^*(\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}) \). For flag manifolds, this map is surjective, but it is not injective. Its kernel is the ideal generated by the \( W \)-invariant polynomials of positive degree, where \( W \) is the Weyl group. Because the Kirwan map is not an isomorphism, the \( G \)-equivariant cohomology ring is not isomorphic to the \( T \)-equivariant cohomology ring (the GKM ring).
