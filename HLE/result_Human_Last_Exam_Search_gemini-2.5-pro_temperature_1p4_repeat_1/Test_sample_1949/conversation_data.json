    "The three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid, are the Tanais (the modern Don River), the Araxes, and the Po (anciently known as the Eridanus). These rivers are all actual waterways, unlike the mythological rivers of the underworld which are also featured in the poem but lack a measurable physical length.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Tanais**, known today as the Don River. Flowing through Russia, it has an approximate length of 1,870 kilometers (1,162 miles). Virgil mentions the Tanais in Book XII of the Aeneid.\n\nThe second longest is the **Araxes River**, which flows through Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran. It has a total length of about 1,072 kilometers (666 miles). The Araxes is mentioned in Book VIII on the shield of Aeneas, which depicts future Roman history.\n\nThe third longest is the **Po River** in Italy, which was referred to in antiquity as the Eridanus. The Po has a length of 652 kilometers (405 miles). The Eridanus is mentioned in Book VI of the Aeneid during Aeneas's journey through the underworld.\n\nOther significant rivers in the Aeneid include the Hebrus (modern Maritsa), with a length of 480 kilometers, and the Tiber in Italy, which is central to the poem's narrative and has a length of 406 kilometers. The mythological rivers of the underworld, such as the Acheron, Styx, Lethe, and Phlegethon, are also prominently featured but are excluded from this geographical ranking as they do not have a physical, measurable length.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Tanais (Don River), the Araxes River, and the Po River (Eridanus).>>>"
