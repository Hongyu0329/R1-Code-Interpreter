    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, which went into effect on June 25, 1940, was the steam merchant **SS Louisiane**.\n\nThe *Louisiane*, with a gross tonnage of 6,903 tons, was sunk on October 13, 1939, by the German submarine U-48. At the time of its sinking, the *Louisiane* was a straggler from the convoy OA-17 and was en route from Antwerp to Havana. The U-boat stopped the vessel with gunfire before sinking it with shells. One crew member was lost in the attack.\n\nSeveral other French vessels were sunk by U-boats during this period. For instance, the French submarine *Doris* (displacing 615 tons on the surface) was sunk by the German U-boat U-9 on May 8, 1940. The steam merchant *Quiberon*, with a tonnage of 1,296 tons, was sunk by U-59 on January 19, 1940. Another merchant ship, the *Arijon* of 4,374 gross register tons, was sunk by U-43 on November 22, 1939.\n\nIt is important to note that many other significant French naval losses during the early stages of the war were not caused by U-boats. For example, the destroyer *Bison* was sunk by dive bombers, and other destroyers such as *L'Adroit*, *Foudroyant*, and *Bourrasque* were lost to mines or aerial attacks during the Dunkirk evacuation. The battleship *Bretagne* was famously sunk by the British Royal Navy at Mers-el-KÃ©bir on July 3, 1940, after the armistice.\n\n<<<SS Louisiane>>>"
