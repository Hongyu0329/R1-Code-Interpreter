    "When the compound represented by the SMILES string `CC12COC(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1` is added to a solution of 0.01 M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water, an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the ketal functional group occurs. Ketals hydrolyze in the presence of acid to form a ketone and an alcohol or diol.\n\nThe provided SMILES string is complex and does not conform to standard representations, making a direct structural interpretation difficult. However, the fragments present in the string, specifically `C` (representing a methyl group) and `C1=CC=CC=C1` (representing a phenyl group), strongly suggest that the parent ketone is acetophenone. The reaction is the deprotection of a ketone.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction can be represented as:\nKetal + H₂O → Ketone + Diol\n\nTo determine which product has a higher molar mass, we must identify the two resulting molecules.\n\n1.  **Ketone Product**: Based on the methyl and phenyl fragments, the ketone product is acetophenone.\n    *   Chemical Formula: C₈H₈O\n    *   SMILES String: `CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1`\n    *   Molar Mass: The molar mass of acetophenone is calculated as (8 × 12.011) + (8 × 1.008) + (1 × 15.999) = 120.151 g/mol.\n\n2.  **Diol Product**: By performing a speculative atom count on the starting SMILES string `CC12COC(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1`, we can deduce a molecular formula of C₁₃H₁₄O₃.\n    *   Molar Mass of Ketal (C₁₃H₁₄O₃): (13 × 12.011) + (14 × 1.008) + (3 × 15.999) = 218.252 g/mol.\n    *   According to the law of conservation of mass, the sum of the masses of the products equals the sum of the masses of the reactants.\n    *   Mass(Diol) = Mass(Ketal) + Mass(H₂O) - Mass(Ketone)\n    *   Mass(Diol) = 218.252 g/mol + 18.015 g/mol - 120.151 g/mol = 116.116 g/mol.\n\nComparing the molar masses of the two products, acetophenone (120.151 g/mol) has a higher molar mass than the diol byproduct (116.116 g/mol).\n\nTherefore, the product with the higher molar mass is acetophenone.\n\n<<<CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1>>>"
