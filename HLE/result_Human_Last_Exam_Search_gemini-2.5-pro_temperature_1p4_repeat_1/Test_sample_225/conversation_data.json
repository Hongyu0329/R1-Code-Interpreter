    "The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, can be determined by a standard formula. The specific curve in question is given by the points (cos(9t), sin(5t)), which is a Lissajous curve with frequencies a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nSince both a=9 and b=5 are odd integers and they are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), the formula for the number of self-intersection points is (a-1)(b-1)/2. This formula applies regardless of whether the functions are sine or cosine, as a phase shift does not change the number of self-intersections for a generic curve.\n\nApplying this formula with a = 9 and b = 5:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (8)(4) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 32 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 16\n\nThus, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
