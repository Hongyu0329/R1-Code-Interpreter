    "The problem asks for the minimum size of a set $A \\subset G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$ that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the group $G$. The group $G$ is an abelian group of order $49^{2024} = (7^2)^{2024} = 7^{4048}$. The elements of $G$ are 2024-tuples $g = (g_1, g_2, \\dots, g_{2024})$, where each $g_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe order of an element $g \\in G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components $g_i$. The possible orders for an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ are 1, 7, and 49. Consequently, the orders of elements in $G$ can only be 1, 7, or 49. This means that the cyclic subgroups of $G$ can have orders 1, 7, or 49.\n\nLet $A$ be a set such that it intersects every cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n\n1.  **The Trivial Subgroup:** The trivial subgroup is $\\{0\\}$, which is generated by the zero element $0 \\in G$. For $A$ to intersect this subgroup, it must be that $A \\cap \\{0\\} \\neq \\emptyset$, which implies that $0 \\in A$. Therefore, any such set $A$ must contain the zero element.\n\n2.  **Cyclic Subgroups of Order 7:** Let's consider the elements of order 7. An element $g \\in G$ has order 7 if and only if at least one component $g_i$ has order 7, and no component has order 49. The set of all elements in $G$ whose order divides 7 forms a subgroup $G_7 = \\{ g \\in G \\mid 7g = 0 \\}$. This subgroup is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$, which can be viewed as a 2024-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\n    The cyclic subgroups of order 7 are precisely the 1-dimensional subspaces of this vector space. A key property of these subspaces is that any two distinct 1-dimensional subspaces intersect only at the zero vector. In our group theory context, any two distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7 intersect only at the identity element $\\{0\\}$.\n\n    The number of non-zero vectors in $G_7$ is $7^{2024}-1$. Each 1-dimensional subspace contains $7-1=6$ non-zero vectors (the generators of that subgroup). Thus, the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n    $$ N_7 = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} $$\n    Since these $N_7$ subgroups are disjoint except for the zero element, to have a non-empty intersection with each of them, the set $A$ must contain at least one distinct non-zero element from each. This means that, in addition to the zero element, $A$ must contain at least $N_7$ non-zero elements. Therefore, the minimum size of $A$ is at least $1 + N_7$.\n\n3.  **Cyclic Subgroups of Order 49:** Now, let's consider a cyclic subgroup $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ of order 49, where the order of $g$ is 49. Within this subgroup, the element $h = 7g$ has order 7. The element $h$ generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle h \\rangle = \\langle 7g \\rangle$ of order 7. This subgroup of order 7 is one of the $N_7$ such subgroups identified above.\n\nNow, let's construct a set $A$ and show it is the smallest possible. Let's define $A$ to be the set containing the zero element and exactly one non-zero element from each of the $N_7$ distinct cyclic subgroups of order 7. The size of this set is:\n$$ |A| = 1 + N_7 = 1 + \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} $$\nWe must verify that this set $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of $G$:\n*   **Order 1:** The trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$ is intersected because $0 \\in A$.\n*   **Order 7:** By construction, $A$ contains a non-zero element from every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n*   **Order 49:** For any cyclic subgroup $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ of order 49, the subgroup $\\langle 7g \\rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 7. By our construction of $A$, there exists an element $a \\in A$ such that $a \\in \\langle 7g \\rangle$ and $a \\neq 0$. Since $\\langle 7g \\rangle \\subset \\langle g \\rangle$, it follows that $a \\in H$.\n\nThus, this set $A$ has a non-empty intersection with all cyclic subgroups of $G$. Since we have already established that any such set must have a size of at least $1 + N_7$, this constructed set is of the smallest possible size.\n\nThe smallest size of the set $A$ is $1 + \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\n<<<1 + (7^2024 - 1)/6>>>"
