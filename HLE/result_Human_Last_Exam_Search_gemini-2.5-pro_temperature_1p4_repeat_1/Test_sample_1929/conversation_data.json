    "The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a cycloaddition reaction. Specifically, it is a Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n\nIn this reaction, butadiene acts as the conjugated diene, and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene serves as the dienophile. The four π-electrons from butadiene and the two π-electrons from the dienophile rearrange to form a more stable cyclohexene derivative. The reaction is typically concerted, meaning the new bonds are formed in a single step.\n\nThe resulting product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\nThe structure of the reactants and the product is as follows:\n*   **Butadiene:** CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂\n*   **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene:** CCl₂=CF₂\n*   **Product (4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene):** A six-membered ring containing one double bond. Two adjacent carbons in the ring, which were originally part of the dienophile, are bonded to two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms, respectively.\n\nThis type of reaction is a fundamental and widely used method in organic chemistry for the synthesis of cyclic compounds. While alternative reaction pathways like a [2+2] cycloaddition can occur in some cases, the Diels-Alder reaction is the characteristic reaction for this combination of reactants.\n\n<<<The product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.>>>"
