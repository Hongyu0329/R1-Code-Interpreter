For a benchmark problem like factoring a 2048-bit RSA integer, which demonstrates universal quantum computation, an approximate number of non-Clifford gates required is on the order of a few billion (e.g., ~6.5 billion Toffoli gates). The use of a distance-3 versus a distance-5 surface code at a 1% physical error rate determines the resource overhead and the resulting logical error rate for implementing each of these gates, with distance-5 offering better protection at a higher physical qubit cost.
