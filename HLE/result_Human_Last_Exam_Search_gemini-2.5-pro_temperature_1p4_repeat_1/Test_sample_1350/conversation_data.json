    "In William Morris's epic romance, *The House of the Wolfings*, it is the supernatural character, the Wood-Sun, who visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a manner that alludes to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\nIn Chapter III, titled \"Thiodolf talketh with the Wood-Sun,\" the Wood-Sun recounts her journey into a Roman settlement to her mortal lover, Thiodolf. While not explicitly naming Romulus and Remus, her description of Roman beliefs and symbols contains distinct allusions recognizable to a reader familiar with the founding myth of Rome. The Wood-Sun tells Thiodolf, \"And I tell thee their banner of battle is a wise and a mighty God.\" This suggests a reverence for a divine founder and protector of the city, akin to the deification of Romulus.\n\nFurthermore, she speaks of the \"Houses of the Fathers, and the hidden mysteries,\" pointing to the deep-seated Roman tradition of ancestor worship and the patrician lineage that traced its origins to the city's foundation. This, combined with an earlier reference in the book to the Romans as the \"children of the Wolf of Rome,\" solidifies the allusion. The \"Wolf of Rome\" is a clear reference to the she-wolf, or Lupa, who, according to legend, suckled the twin founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus.\n\nTherefore, it is the Wood-Sun who acts as the messenger, bringing back to the Goths a description of the Romans' faith in their divine ancestry and their wolf-symbol, which is a clear, albeit poetic, reference to the foundational myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\n<<<The Wood-Sun>>>"
