    "The largest possible weight of a compact, first-countable topological group \\(G\\) with cardinality \\(|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}\\) is \\(2^{2^\\frak{c}}\\).\n\nHere is the justification based on established theorems in the theory of topological groups:\n\n1.  **Arhangel'skii's Inequality for Topological Groups**: A fundamental result by A. V. Arhangel'skii states that for any topological group (which is not necessarily Hausdorff), its cardinality \\(|G|\\) is bounded by its density \\(d(G)\\) and character \\(\\chi(G)\\) as follows:\n    \\[|G| \\leq d(G)^{\\chi(G)}\\]\n\n2.  **Applying the Given Properties**: We are given that \\(G\\) is first-countable, which means its character \\(\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0 = \\omega\\). The cardinality is given as \\(|G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}\\). Substituting these into Arhangel'skii's inequality gives:\n    \\[2^{2^\\frak{c}} \\leq d(G)^\\omega\\]\n    For this inequality to hold, the density \\(d(G)\\) must be at least \\(2^{2^\\frak{c}}\\).\n\n3.  **Upper Bound for Density**: The density of any topological space cannot exceed its cardinality. Therefore, \\(d(G) \\leq |G| = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}\\).\n\n4.  **Determining the Density**: Combining the results from steps 2 and 3, we have \\(2^{2^\\frak{c}} \\leq d(G) \\leq 2^{2^\\frak{c}}\\). This forces the density of the group to be exactly its cardinality:\n    \\[d(G) = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}\\]\n\n5.  **Itzkowitz's Theorem**: For compact (and more generally, for \\(\\sigma\\)-compact) topological groups, a theorem by Itzkowitz establishes a direct relationship between the weight, density, and character:\n    \\[w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)\\]\n\n6.  **Calculating the Weight**: Substituting the known values for the density and character into this formula, we find the weight of the group:\n    \\[w(G) = 2^{2^\\frak{c}} \\cdot \\omega = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}\\]\n\nTherefore, the largest possible weight of the group is equal to its cardinality.\n\nIt is important to note that the condition that the group might fail to be Hausdorff is essential. A compact, first-countable *Hausdorff* group must have a cardinality no greater than \\(\\frak{c} = 2^\\omega\\), which contradicts the given cardinality of \\(2^{2^\\frak{c}}\\).\n\n<<<2^(2^c)>>>"
