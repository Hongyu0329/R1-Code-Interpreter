    "To compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, we first need to precisely identify the space $X$.\n\n### 1. Defining the Space X\n\nA lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be represented by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, which can be arranged as the columns of a matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition that the lattice has \"unit area\" means $|\\det(A)|=1$. The space of all such basis matrices is denoted $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{ A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(A) = \\pm 1 \\}$.\n\nThe \"moduli space\" aspect means we identify bases that generate the same lattice. Two bases, represented by matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$, generate the same lattice if and only if $A_2 = A_1 G$ for some matrix $G$ with integer entries and determinant $\\pm 1$. The group of such matrices is $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nTherefore, the moduli space $X$ is the quotient space:\n$X = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### 2. Relating X to the Space of Oriented Lattices\n\nIt is often easier to first consider the moduli space of *oriented* lattices of unit area. This space, let's call it $Y$, is the quotient:\n$Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe space $X$ can be seen as a quotient of $Y$. The group $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ contains matrices of determinant -1 (e.g., $g_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$), which reverse orientation. The space $X$ is obtained from $Y$ by identifying a lattice with its orientation-reversed counterpart. This corresponds to a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ action on $Y$. So, $X \\cong Y / \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n### 3. Homology of the Space of Oriented Lattices (Y)\n\nThe space $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a well-studied object. It is the unit tangent bundle to the modular orbifold $\\mathbb{H}^2/PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. Topologically, $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ is not simply connected, but the homology of the quotient space $Y$ is related to the group homology of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nSpecifically, the first homology group is the abelianization of the fundamental group:\n$H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(Y)_{ab}$.\n\nThe fundamental group of $Y$ is $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The abelianization of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is known to be the cyclic group of order 12.\n$H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}))_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n\n### 4. The Action on Homology and the Homology of X\n\nThe $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ action on $Y$ that \"forgets\" the orientation induces an action on the homology group $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$. This action corresponds to conjugation by a matrix of determinant -1, which sends the generators of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ to their inverses. On the abelianized group $H_1(Y) = \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, this corresponds to the map $k \\mapsto -k$.\n\nTo compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(Y/\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z})$, one can use the spectral sequence for the quotient map. The low-degree terms of this sequence give rise to a short exact sequence:\n$0 \\to E^{\\infty}_{1,0} \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to E^{\\infty}_{0,1} \\to 0$\n\nThe relevant terms are calculated as follows:\n*   $E^2_{1,0} = H_1(\\mathbb{Z}_2, H_0(Y, \\mathbb{Z})) = H_1(\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   $E^2_{0,1} = H_0(\\mathbb{Z}_2, H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})) = H_0(\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}_{12}) = \\mathbb{Z}_{12} / (-1-1)\\mathbb{Z}_{12} = \\mathbb{Z}_{12} / 2\\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nSince the relevant differentials are zero, $E^{\\infty}_{1,0} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $E^{\\infty}_{0,1} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This implies that $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a group of order 4, being an extension of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ by $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. It is either $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ or $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity, we can use an alternative description. The space $X$ is a fiber in the fibration $Z \\to \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, where $Z = GL(2,\\mathbb{R})/GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ is the space of all lattices. Since the base space $\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is contractible, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(Z, \\mathbb{Z})$. The homology of $Z$ can be computed from the fibration $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to Z$. This ultimately relates $H_1(Z, \\mathbb{Z})$ to the abelianization of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe abelianization of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is known to be the Klein four-group, $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Detailed arguments show that this is indeed the first homology group of the space $X$.\n\nThus, the first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n<<<$\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$>>>"
