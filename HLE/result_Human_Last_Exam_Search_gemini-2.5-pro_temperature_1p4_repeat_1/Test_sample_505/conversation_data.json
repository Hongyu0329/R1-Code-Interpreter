    "In a surface code architecture, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is directly related to the topology of the surface, specifically the number of holes or defects introduced into the code. For each patch of surface code, the introduction of holes allows for the encoding of additional logical qubits beyond the baseline of a simple planar code.\n\nA single patch of surface code with *h* closed holes can encode *h* logical qubits. For instance, a surface code with two closed holes can encode two logical qubits. This principle arises from the fact that each hole introduces new non-trivial loops for logical operators, which increases the dimensionality of the code space.\n\nGiven two independent patches of surface code, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each individual patch. Since each patch has two holes, each patch can encode a maximum of two logical qubits.\n\nTherefore, for two patches of surface code, each with two holes, the total number of logical qubits that can be encoded is:\n\n2 (logical qubits per patch 1) + 2 (logical qubits per patch 2) = 4 logical qubits.\n\nIt's important to note that while creating a logical qubit is often described as requiring a *pair* of holes, the more general topological understanding is that each hole provides a degree of freedom for a logical qubit. The use of pairs is a common practical method for creating and manipulating these qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
