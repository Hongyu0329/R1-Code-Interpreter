In the CCSD method, given that the electronic Hamiltonian contains up to two-body terms, the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are also zero for all quintuply, sextuply, and higher excited Slater determinants. This is because the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\bar{H}$, when expanded via the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, contains only connected terms. The two-body nature of the electronic Hamiltonian restricts any single connected term to generate, at most, a quadruply excited determinant from the reference determinant. Consequently, the vector $\bar{H}|\Phi\rangle$ has no components in the space of quintuply or more highly excited determinants, causing those matrix elements to be zero.
