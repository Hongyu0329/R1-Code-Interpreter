The solutions for $z$ are:
1. $z=1$
2. $z=-1$
3. An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_m = -ia_m$ for $m=1, 2, 3, \ldots$, where $a_m$ is the unique positive solution to the equation $x = e^{-(2m-1/2)\pi x}$.
4. For each non-zero integer $k$, there is an infinite set of complex solutions $z = x+iy$ that satisfy the system of equations:
   $x = e^{-y(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi)}\sin(x(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi))$
   $y = -e^{-y(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi)}\cos(x(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi))$
