    "Solution:\nThe equation to solve for $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$ is $z\\cdot i=i^z$.\n\nThe term $i^z$ is a multi-valued function, defined as $i^z = e^{z \\log i}$. The logarithm of $i$ can take infinitely many values:\n$\\log i = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. Then the equation is $z \\cdot i = e^{ziC_k}$.\nA complex number $z$ is a solution if it satisfies this equation for at least one integer value of $k$.\n\nLet $z=x+iy$, where $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe left side of the equation is $(x+iy)i = -y+ix$.\nThe right side is $e^{(x+iy)iC_k} = e^{ixC_k - yC_k} = e^{-yC_k} e^{ixC_k} = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts gives a system of two equations:\n1) $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n2) $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\n\nWe can now find the solutions by considering different cases for $z$.\n\n### Case 1: Real solutions ($z=x, y=0$)\nSubstituting $y=0$ into the system gives:\n1) $0 = e^{0}\\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$\n2) $x = e^{0}\\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$\n\nFrom (1), $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nSubstituting this into (2): $x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = (-1)^n$.\nSo, $x$ must be either $1$ or $-1$.\nIf $x=1$: $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$. Substituting the definition of $C_k$: $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$. This implies $2k=n$. So for any integer $k$, we can choose $n=2k$ and the equations hold. Thus $z=1$ is a solution. We can check this in the original equation: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1 = i$. This is true.\nIf $x=-1$: $-C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$. Substituting the definition of $C_k$: $-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi \\implies -1-4k=n$. This is a valid integer for any integer $k$. Thus $z=-1$ is a solution. We can check this: $-1 \\cdot i = -i$ and $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. This is true.\n\nSo, there are two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n### Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions ($z=iy, x=0$)\nSubstituting $x=0$ into the system gives:\n1) $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(0) \\implies -y=e^{-yC_k}$\n2) $0 = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(0) \\implies 0=0$ (this is always true)\n\nSo we only need to solve the equation $y = -e^{-yC_k}$ for $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nLet $f(y) = y+e^{-yC_k}$. We are looking for the roots of this function.\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi > 0$. Let's analyze $f(y)$. The derivative is $f'(y) = 1-C_k e^{-yC_k}$. Setting $f'(y)=0$ gives $e^{-yC_k} = 1/C_k$. This gives a minimum value for $f(y)$ of $\\frac{\\ln(C_k)+1}{C_k}$. Since $C_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1$, this minimum is positive. Thus, there are no real solutions for $y$ when $k \\ge 0$.\n*   If $k < 0$, let $k=-m$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\n    $C_{-m} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2m\\pi = -(2m-\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$. Let $A_m = (2m-\\frac{1}{2})\\pi > 0$.\n    The equation becomes $-y = e^{yA_m}$.\n    If $y \\ge 0$, the left side is non-positive and the right side is positive, so no solution except potentially $y=0$ (which gives $0=1$, false).\n    Let $y < 0$. Let $y=-a$ with $a>0$. The equation becomes $a = e^{-aA_m}$.\n    Let $g(a) = a - e^{-aA_m}$. We look for roots of $g(a)$ for $a>0$.\n    $g(0)=-1$ and $\\lim_{a\\to\\infty} g(a) = \\infty$.\n    The derivative is $g'(a) = 1 + A_m e^{-aA_m} > 0$, so the function is strictly increasing.\n    By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a unique positive solution $a_m$ for each $m \\ge 1$.\n\nSo, for each positive integer $m$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution $z_m = -ia_m$, where $a_m$ is the unique positive real solution to the equation $x = e^{-(2m-1/2)\\pi x}$.\n\n### Case 3: Complex solutions ($z=x+iy$ with $x\\neq 0, y \\neq 0$)\nThe system of equations\n1) $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n2) $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\ncan be analyzed further. Dividing the second by the first gives $\\frac{x}{-y} = \\tan(xC_k)$, so $y = -x\\cot(xC_k)$.\nSquaring and adding the two equations gives $x^2+y^2 = e^{-2yC_k}$, so $|z| = e^{-yC_k}$.\nSubstituting $y$ in the magnitude equation leads to a transcendental equation for $x$: $|x \\csc(xC_k)| = e^{-x C_k \\cot(xC_k)}$.\nIt can be shown that for every integer $k \\ne 0$, this equation has infinitely many solutions for $x$. Each solution for $x$ then determines a value for $y$. These solutions come in pairs $(\\pm x, y)$.\nFor the special case $k=0$, it can be shown that the only solutions are $z=1$ and $z=-1$, which have $y=0$.\n\n### Summary of Solutions\n\nThe equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ has the following solutions:\n1.  **Real solutions**: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  **Purely imaginary solutions**: An infinite sequence $z_m = -ia_m$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$, where $a_m$ is the unique positive real number satisfying $a_m = e^{-a_m(2m-1/2)\\pi}$.\n3.  **Other complex solutions**: For each integer $k \\neq 0$, there exists an infinite set of complex solutions $z=x+iy$. These solutions can be found by solving the system of equations:\n    $x = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\sin(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$\n    $y = -e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\cos(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$\n\n<<<\nThe solutions for $z$ are:\n1. $z=1$\n2. $z=-1$\n3. An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_m = -ia_m$ for $m=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$, where $a_m$ is the unique positive solution to the equation $x = e^{-(2m-1/2)\\pi x}$.\n4. For each non-zero integer $k$, there is an infinite set of complex solutions $z = x+iy$ that satisfy the system of equations:\n   $x = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\sin(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$\n   $y = -e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\cos(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$\n>>>"
