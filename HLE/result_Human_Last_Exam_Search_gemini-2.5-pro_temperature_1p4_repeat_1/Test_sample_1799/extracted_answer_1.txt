The prevailing view in physics is that the second postulate of special relativity is not superfluous and cannot be deduced from the first postulate in isolation. The first postulate, when combined with principles of homogeneity and isotropy, allows for a family of transformations, including Galilean relativity (with an infinite invariant speed) and Lorentz-like transformations (with a finite invariant speed). To single out the Lorentz transformations, a further axiom is needed to establish this finite invariant speed. The second postulate provides this by identifying the invariant speed with the speed of light, 'c'. While it's true that applying the first postulate to Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism leads to the constancy of the speed of light, this relies on accepting Maxwell's equations as fundamental laws that must be invariant in all inertial frames, which was a key part of Einstein's revolutionary insight and not a universally accepted fact at the time. Therefore, the second postulate is considered a crucial and independent component of the theory's foundation.
