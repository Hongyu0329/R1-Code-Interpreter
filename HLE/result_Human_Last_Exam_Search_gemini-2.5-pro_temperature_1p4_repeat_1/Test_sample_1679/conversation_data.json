    "An American in Paris*, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, was the first film to hold that honor to feature a depiction of a Luxor Obelisk. The film includes an extended ballet sequence set in a stylized version of Paris, which prominently features the Place de la Concorde and its famous landmarks.\n\nThe spectacular 17-minute ballet finale, choreographed by and starring Gene Kelly, uses elaborate sets and backdrops inspired by the works of French painters to recreate various Parisian settings. One of the key locations in this dream sequence is the Place de la Concorde.\n\nThe sequence includes a passionate dance between Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron around a fountain that is explicitly based on the fountains of the Place de la Concorde. The opening of this ballet sequence is set to a backdrop in the style of Raoul Dufy's depiction of the Place de la Concorde. Furthermore, a prop oil painting used in the film depicted the Luxor Obelisk itself, confirming its intended presence in the film's artistic vision of Paris.\n\nWhile the first-ever Best Picture winner, *Wings* (1927), did feature scenes in Paris, these were primarily interior shots of the Folies Berg√®re and military encampments, with no evidence of the Place de la Concorde being shown. Subsequent Best Picture winners prior to 1951 were not set in locations that would have featured a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
