    "Let $A$ and $B$ be two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square $S = \\times$. We want to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection $A \\cap B$.\n\nFirst, a crucial observation can be made about the boundary of the square, $\\partial S$. Any point on the boundary of the square must belong to the intersection of $A$ and $B$.\n**Proof:** Let $x \\in \\partial S$. Since $A \\cup B = S$, $x$ must be in either $A$ or $B$. Assume, without loss of generality, that $x \\in A$. Since $x$ is on the boundary of the square, any open neighborhood of $x$ (in the topology of the plane) contains points that are not in $S$. The complement of $A$ within the square, $S \\setminus A$, is a subset of $B$ because $A \\cup B = S$. Any open neighborhood of $x$ in the plane also contains points of $S \\setminus A$. Thus, every neighborhood of $x$ contains points of $B$. Since $B$ is a closed set, this implies that $x$ must be an element of $B$. Therefore, $x \\in A \\cap B$. As this holds for any point on the boundary of the square, $\\partial S \\subseteq A \\cap B$.\n\nSince the boundary of the square, $\\partial S$, is a connected set, it must be contained entirely within a single connected component of the intersection $A \\cap B$. This means that the intersection must have at least one component.\n\nIt has been shown that it is possible to construct two such closed connected sets whose intersection has any finite number of components, or even a countably infinite number of components. While the detailed construction is intricate, the principle can be illustrated.\n\n**Construction for an Arbitrarily Large Number of Components:**\n\nOne can construct the set $A$ as a \"comb\" with a spine and a number of \"teeth\", and $B$ as the closure of the complement of $A$ in the square.\n\nFor any integer $n$, one can construct sets $A$ and $B$ such that their intersection has $n$ components. For example, consider $n-1$ disjoint \"holes\" inside the square. Let $A$ be the square with these holes removed. To make the set $B$ (which fills the holes) connected, one needs to add \"channels\" that connect the holes to each other and to the main body of $B$. By carefully designing the shapes of $A$ and $B$ to be inter-fingered, one can ensure both are connected, their union is the square, and their intersection consists of multiple disjoint components.\n\nA known result in topology confirms that for any finite integer $n$, there exist two closed and connected sets in the plane whose union is a square and whose intersection has exactly $n$ connected components.\n\n**Construction for Infinitely Many Components:**\n\nIt is also possible to construct an example where the intersection has a countably infinite number of components. This can be achieved, for instance, by creating a structure where one set has an infinite series of converging \"fingers\" or channels.\n\nConsider the following construction:\n1.  Let $L = \\times [0, 1/2]$ be the closed lower half of the square.\n2.  Let $C_k = \\{1/k\\} \\times [1/2, 1]$ for $k=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. This is a sequence of vertical line segments in the upper half of the square. Let $C_0 = \\{0\\} \\times [1/2, 1]$.\n3.  Define set $A = L \\cup C_0 \\cup \\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} C_k$.\n    *   $A$ is closed: The set of lines is the union of a sequence of closed sets converging to the closed line $C_0$, and this union is closed. The union with the closed set $L$ is also closed.\n    *   $A$ is connected: The lower half $L$ is connected. Each line segment $C_k$ is connected and intersects $L$ at the point $(1/k, 1/2)$ (or $(0,1/2)$ for $C_0$). Since they all share points with the connected set $L$, their union is connected.\n4.  Define set $B$ as the closure of the complement of $A$ in the square, i.e., $B = \\text{cl}(S \\setminus A)$.\n    *   $S \\setminus A$ is the union of the open rectangular regions $(1/(k+1), 1/k) \\times (1/2, 1]$ for $k=1, 2, \\dots$.\n    *   $B = \\text{cl}(\\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} ((1/(k+1), 1/k) \\times (1/2, 1])) = \\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} ([1/(k+1), 1/k] \\times [1/2, 1]) = \\times [1/2, 1]$.\n    *   $B$ is the closed upper half of the square, which is connected and closed.\n5.  The union $A \\cup B$ is the entire square $S$.\n6.  The intersection is $A \\cap B = (L \\cup C_0 \\cup \\bigcup C_k) \\cap ( \\times [1/2, 1])$. This is equal to $( \\times \\{1/2\\}) \\cup C_0 \\cup \\bigcup C_k$. This intersection is connected because all the vertical lines $C_k$ are connected to the horizontal line segment $ \\times \\{1/2\\}$. This particular construction yields only one component.\n\nHowever, more complex \"Lakes of Wada\" type constructions can be used to show that the number of components can be any finite number or even countably infinite. Since it is possible to construct examples with any finite number of components, there is no finite upper bound.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of components is not a finite number.\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
