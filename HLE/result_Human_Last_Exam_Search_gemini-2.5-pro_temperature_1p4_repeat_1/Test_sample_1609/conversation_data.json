    "For a Boolean function of n variables, the maximal number of prime implicants, denoted as a(n), is given by the formula 2^(n-1).\n\nTo find a(4), we substitute n=4 into the formula:\n\na(4) = 2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8.\n\nThis is supported by examples using a 4-variable Karnaugh map, which show that the maximum number of prime implicants possible is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
