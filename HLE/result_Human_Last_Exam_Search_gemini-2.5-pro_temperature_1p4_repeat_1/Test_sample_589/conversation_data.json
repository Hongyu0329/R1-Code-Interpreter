    "The Hollywood feature film that features a scene where a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car is the 2018 science fiction action film, *A.X.L.*.\n\nIn the movie, the character Sam Fontaine, portrayed by Alex MacNicoll, who is a motocross rival to the protagonist, performs this stunt. During a party in the hills, Sam, in an act of reckless bravado, rides a child's small pink bicycle down a dirt road directly into the path of an approaching car. The car is forced to swerve at the last second to avoid a collision. This scene is intended to display Sam's antagonistic and daring personality.\n\nThe film was distributed by Global Road Entertainment, which was a successor to Open Road Films, a joint venture of major theater chains AMC Theatres and Regal Entertainment Group, fitting the criteria of being produced or distributed by a company with ties to major Hollywood entities.\n\n<<<A.X.L. (2018)>>>"
