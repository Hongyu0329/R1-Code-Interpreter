    "An optimal move for White in this position is **Qe1**.\n\nThis move is strategically sound for several reasons. Firstly, it repositions the queen to a more active and flexible square. From e1, the queen can support the advance of the d6-pawn, which is White's primary winning advantage. Secondly, it prepares to challenge Black's active queen on c5. By controlling the e-file, White can restrict the black queen's movements and reduce its counter-attacking potential.\n\nFor example, a possible continuation could be:\n1. Qe1 Kxc6\n2. Qe8+ Kb7\n3. Qb5+ Ka7\n4. d7\n\nIn this line, White's d-pawn is unstoppable and will promote, leading to a winning endgame for White. Another possible response from Black could be to play 1...Kc7, to which White can respond with 2. Qe5+, forcing the black king to a less favorable square and allowing the d-pawn to advance.\n\n<<<Qe1>>>"
