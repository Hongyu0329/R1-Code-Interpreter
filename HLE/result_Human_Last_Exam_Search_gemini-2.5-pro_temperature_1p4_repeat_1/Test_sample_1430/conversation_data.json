    "The analysis of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C reveals a range of possible ranks, contingent on the geometric properties of the curve C itself. The rank is determined by the complexity of the endomorphism ring of the Jacobian of the curve.\n\nLet C be a Riemann surface of genus g=3 and X be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as X = Sym^15(C).\n\nThe structure of X can be described as a projective bundle. For a curve of genus g, when the degree of the symmetric power d is greater than or equal to 2g-1, Sym^d(C) is a P^(d-g) bundle over the Jacobian of the curve, J(C). In this case, d=15 and g=3, so d=15 ≥ 2g-1=5. This means X = Sym^15(C) is a P^12-bundle over J(C).\n\nFor such a projective bundle, the rank of the Néron-Severi group, denoted by ρ(X), is related to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the base, ρ(J(C)), by the formula:\nρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1.\n\nThis reduces the problem to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest rank corresponds to a \"general\" or \"generic\" curve C. For a generic curve of genus g, its Jacobian J(C) has only the trivial endomorphisms (multiplication by integers), meaning End(J(C)) = ℤ. In this situation, the Néron-Severi group of J(C) is generated by the class of the theta divisor, and its rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the minimum rank for the Néron-Severi group of X is:\nρ_min(X) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe largest rank is achieved when the curve C has special geometric properties that lead to its Jacobian having a large ring of endomorphisms. Such Jacobians are said to have complex multiplication (CM). The rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension g is bounded by the Hodge number h^(1,1), which for a Jacobian of a genus g curve is g^2. For a genus 3 curve, this maximum is 3^2 = 9.\n\nThis maximum rank is achieved for curves whose Jacobians are of CM type. An example of a genus 3 curve with a CM Jacobian is the Klein quartic, defined by the equation x³y + y³z + z³x = 0. Its Jacobian has complex multiplication by the field ℚ(ζ₇), which is a field of degree 6 over ℚ (where 2g = 2*3=6). For such a curve, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian is indeed 9.\n\nConsequently, the maximum possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X is:\nρ_max(X) = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.>>>"
