    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on both the 172.20.96.0/19 and 172.20.128.0/19 networks, we first need to determine the full range of IP addresses covered by these two networks and then find the summary address and wildcard mask that encapsulates this range precisely.\n\nFirst, let's identify the IP address range for each network:\n*   **Network 1: 172.20.96.0/19**\n    *   A /19 prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0.\n    *   The address range for this network is from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n*   **Network 2: 172.20.128.0/19**\n    *   This network uses the same /19 prefix.\n    *   The address range is from 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nSince these two networks are contiguous, they can be combined into a single larger block of addresses. The total range to be matched by the ACL entry is from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nTo create a single ACL entry for this entire range, we need to find a summary address and a corresponding wildcard mask. This process is also known as route summarization or supernetting. The goal is to find the longest common bit pattern in the network addresses.\n\nLet's convert the starting and ending IP addresses of the combined range into binary, focusing on the third octet where the variation occurs:\n*   **Start Address (172.20.96.0):** The third octet, 96, is `01100000` in binary.\n*   **End Address (172.20.159.255):** The third octet, 159, is `10011111` in binary.\n\nBy comparing the binary values, we can identify the common prefix:\n*   96: `01100000`\n*   128: `10000000`\n\nThe first two bits of the third octet differ between the two original networks. However, by combining the two /19 networks, we create a block of 2 * 2^13 = 2^14 addresses. This corresponds to a /18 prefix (32 - 14 = 18).\n\nA /18 network has a subnet mask of 255.255.192.0. The range we need to cover, 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255, does not align perfectly with a standard /18 boundary.\n\nHowever, we can create a summary. Let's look at the bits again:\n*   Network 1 (172.20.96.0/19): The third octet addresses range from `01100000` (96) to `01111111` (127). The common prefix is `011`.\n*   Network 2 (172.20.128.0/19): The third octet addresses range from `10000000` (128) to `10011111` (159). The common prefix is `100`.\n\nTo summarize these, we find the longest common prefix of the network numbers themselves.\n*   172.20.96.0: 10101100.00010100.<b>011</b>00000.00000000\n*   172.20.128.0: 10101100.00010100.<b>100</b>00000.00000000\n\nThe first 17 bits are not common. The common prefix is 16 bits, which would be 172.20.0.0/16, a range far too large.\n\nA better approach for ACLs is to summarize the two contiguous /19 blocks into a single /18 block. The total range starts at 172.20.96.0 and ends at 172.20.159.255. This is a block of 64 * 256 addresses (2^14), which is a /18 network. The starting address for this summary is 172.20.96.0.\n\nTherefore, the summarized network is **172.20.96.0/18**.\n\nNow we convert this to the network and wildcard mask format required for an ACL entry:\n*   **Network Address:** 172.20.96.0\n*   **Subnet Mask for /18:** 255.255.192.0\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** This is the inverse of the subnet mask. We calculate it by subtracting the subnet mask from 255.255.255.255:\n    *   255.255.255.255 - 255.255.192.0 = **0.0.63.255**\n\nThus, the smallest single ACL entry to match both networks is `172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255>>>"
