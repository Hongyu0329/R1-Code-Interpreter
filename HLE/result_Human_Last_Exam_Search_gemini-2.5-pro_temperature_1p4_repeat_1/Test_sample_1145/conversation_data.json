    "To determine the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the n=2 state, one must calculate the integral of the probability density over this interval.\n\nThe probability density function for a particle in a 1D box is given by the square of the normalized wavefunction, P(x) = |ψₙ(x)|². The wavefunction for the n-th quantum state is ψₙ(x) = √(2/a) sin(nπx/a), where 'a' is the length of the box.\n\nFor the n=2 state, the probability density is P(x) = (2/a) sin²(2πx/a). The probability of finding the particle in the specified interval [x₁, x₂] is calculated by the definite integral:\n\nP = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2 is used. The integral becomes:\n\nP = (1/a) ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\n\nEvaluating this integral yields:\n\nP = (1/a) [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nSubstituting the limits of integration gives:\n\nP = (1/a) [ (0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π) sin(0.02π)\n\nUsing the value of π ≈ 3.14159, the calculation leads to a probability of approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶. This very small probability is expected, as the interval is centered around the midpoint of the box (x = 0.5a), where the n=2 wavefunction has a node (i.e., the probability density is zero).\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
