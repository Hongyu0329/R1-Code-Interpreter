    "An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine is a type of vaccine that confers complete protection to a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals, while the remaining individuals receive no protection at all. In contrast, a \"leaky\" vaccine provides partial protection to everyone who receives it. The question asks how the standard measure of vaccine efficacy, calculated as 1 minus the incidence rate ratio (IRR), relates to the per-exposure efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relationship:\n*   **Per-exposure vaccine efficacy:** This refers to the reduction in the risk of infection from a single exposure to the pathogen. For an all-or-nothing vaccine, this efficacy is 100% for the protected group and 0% for the unprotected group.\n*   **Incidence Rate:** This is the rate of new cases in a population over time.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the incidence rate in the vaccinated group divided by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n*   **Overall Vaccine Efficacy (VE):** This is the population-level measure, calculated as VE = 1 - IRR.\n\nLet's consider a hypothetical scenario:\n*   Assume a proportion, `p`, of vaccinated individuals are fully protected (100% per-exposure efficacy).\n*   The remaining proportion, `1-p`, are completely unprotected (0% per-exposure efficacy), just like the unvaccinated group.\n*   Let the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group be `λ_u`.\n*   The incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`λ_v`) will be a weighted average: the rate is 0 for the protected proportion `p` and `λ_u` for the unprotected proportion `1-p`. Therefore, `λ_v = (p * 0) + ((1-p) * λ_u) = (1-p) * λ_u`.\n*   The IRR is `λ_v / λ_u`, which simplifies to `((1-p) * λ_u) / λ_u = 1-p`.\n*   The calculated overall vaccine efficacy is `VE = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1-p) = p`.\n\nThis shows that the measured vaccine efficacy (`1 - IRR`) is equal to `p`, the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected.\n\nThe \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy,\" for those in whom the vaccine works, is 100%. However, the measured value from the population data (`1 - IRR`) is `p`, which represents the fraction of people protected. Unless the vaccine is 100% effective for every single recipient (`p=1`), this value `p` will be less than 100%.\n\nTherefore, the population-level measure `1-IRR` underestimates the actual per-exposure efficacy for the individuals who are successfully protected by the vaccine.\n\nFor example, if a vaccine is 80% effective, in an all-or-nothing model this means it provides perfect protection to 80% of recipients and no protection to 20%. The per-exposure efficacy for the protected group is 100%. The measured efficacy (`1 - IRR`) would be 80%. Since 80% is less than 100%, the overall efficacy measure underestimates the biological efficacy in the protected subgroup.\n\n<<<B>>>"
