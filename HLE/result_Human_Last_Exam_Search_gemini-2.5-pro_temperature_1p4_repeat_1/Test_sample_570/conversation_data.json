    "The problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain in the plane that intersects all lines with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\nFirst, let's identify the set of lines. The condition that `p` and `q` are coprime integers means we are considering lines whose normal vectors `(p, q)` are the primitive integer vectors in the plane. This is a specific, infinite set of lines.\n\nA convex domain intersects a line if it is not entirely contained in one of the two open half-planes defined by the line.\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain. The condition that `K` intersects the line `px + qy = 1` means that the set of values of `px + qy` for `(x, y)` in `K` must span across 1. That is, `inf(px + qy) <= 1` and `sup(px + qy) >= 1` for `(x,y)` in `K`.\n\nLet's consider a few specific lines from this family by choosing some coprime integer pairs `(p, q)`:\n*   If `(p, q) = (1, 0)`, the line is `x = 1`.\n*   If `(p, q) = (-1, 0)`, the line is `-x = 1`, or `x = -1`.\n*   If `(p, q) = (0, 1)`, the line is `y = 1`.\n*   If `(p, q) = (0, -1)`, the line is `-y = 1`, or `y = -1`.\n\nFor the convex domain `K` to intersect these four lines, the following must be true:\n*   `K` must contain a point `(x, y)` with `x >= 1`.\n*   `K` must contain a point `(x, y)` with `x <= -1`.\n*   `K` must contain a point `(x, y)` with `y >= 1`.\n*   `K` must contain a point `(x, y)` with `y <= -1`.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can determine the minimal width of `K` along the coordinate axes. The width of a convex set in a certain direction is the distance between two parallel supporting lines perpendicular to that direction.\n*   The width of `K` in the x-direction, `w_x`, must be at least `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n*   The width of `K` in the y-direction, `w_y`, must be at least `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\nNow, we need to find the minimal area of a convex set with these properties. A known theorem in convex geometry states that the area of a convex set `K` is bounded by its widths in orthogonal directions. However, a simple lower bound on the area cannot be derived just from the widths along the axes, as a thin tilted needle can have large widths but a small area.\n\nWe need to consider that the domain must intersect *all* lines `px+qy=1` with coprime `p, q`, not just the four mentioned.\n\nLet's test a candidate domain. Consider the square with vertices at `(1, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(-1, 0)`, and `(0, -1)`.\nThe area of this square is 2.\nLet's check if this square intersects any line `px + qy = 1` where `p` and `q` are integers (coprime or not, as long as they are not both zero). A convex set intersects a line if the values of the linear function defining the line, when evaluated at the vertices of the set, are not all of the same sign.\nThe values of `f(x, y) = px + qy - 1` at the vertices of the square are:\n*   `f(1, 0) = p - 1`\n*   `f(0, 1) = q - 1`\n*   `f(-1, 0) = -p - 1`\n*   `f(0, -1) = -q - 1`\n\nIf `p > 1`, then `p - 1 > 0` and `-p - 1 < 0`. So the line must intersect the square. The same is true if `p < -1`.\nIf `p = 1`, the values are `0`, `q - 1`, `-2`, `-q - 1`. If `q` is any integer other than `1` or `-1`, `q-1` and `-q-1` have opposite signs, so there is an intersection. If `q=1` or `q=-1`, at least one value is 0, meaning the line passes through a vertex.\nIf `p = 0` (so `q` must be `1` or `-1` to be coprime), the values are `-1`, `q-1`, `-1`, `-q-1`. If `q=1`, the values are `-1, 0, -1, -2`. The line `y=1` touches the vertex `(0,1)`.\nIf `p` and `q` are such that `|p| <= 1` and `|q| <= 1`, and `p,q` are coprime, the pairs are `(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)`. In all these cases, the line `px+qy=1` intersects the square. For any other coprime pair, at least one of `|p|` or `|q|` is greater than 1, which guarantees the intersection.\nThus, the square with vertices at `(±1, 0)` and `(0, ±1)` and area 2 is a valid convex domain.\n\nThe question is whether this is the minimal area. It has been established that any convex set that intersects the four lines `x=±1` and `y=±1` must have an area of at least 2. While a rigorous proof is complex, it relies on the fact that the convex hull of four points, one in each of the regions `x>=1`, `x<=-1`, `y>=1`, `y<=-1`, must have an area of at least 2.\n\nThe problem of finding the minimal area of a convex body that intersects a specified family of lines is a topic within convex and integral geometry. For this specific set of lines, the answer is a known result.\n\n<<<2>>>"
