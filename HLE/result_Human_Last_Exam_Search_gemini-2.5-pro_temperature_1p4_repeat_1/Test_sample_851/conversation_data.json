    "To determine the correct answer, we must identify the crystal classes that satisfy all three of the following conditions:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means its point group must contain an improper rotation axis (such as a mirror plane or a center of inversion).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique polar axis and therefore does not exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment. Of the 32 crystal classes, 10 are polar, so we must exclude these. The polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n3.  **Correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is possible in all crystal classes that lack a center of inversion (non-centrosymmetric classes). This includes 21 of the 32 crystal classes.\n\nCombining these criteria, we are looking for crystal classes that are non-centrosymmetric, achiral, and non-polar.\n\nFollowing this logic:\n*   We start with the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, as centrosymmetric classes are never optically active.\n*   From these 21, we exclude the 11 chiral (or enantiomorphic) classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432) because the question specifies the classes must be **achiral**.\n*   This leaves 10 non-centrosymmetric, achiral classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -6m2 (equivalent to -62m), and -43m.\n*   Finally, we apply the **non-polar** condition. From this list of 10, we must exclude the polar classes, which are m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nThe remaining crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity are **-4, -42m, -6, -6m2 (or -62m), and -43m**.\n\nNow we can evaluate the given answer choices:\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are incorrect because they are polar classes.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** All three of these classes are on our derived list of correct classes.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These are incorrect because they are polar classes (note: 4m is likely a typo for the polar class 4mm).\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both of these classes are on our derived list, and recent studies have specifically investigated optical activity in these achiral, non-polar classes. However, this answer is less complete than choice B.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are incorrect because they are chiral classes.\n\nBoth B and D list valid crystal classes. However, B provides a list of three valid classes while D lists two. Without further constraints, choice B represents a more comprehensive set of examples that fit the criteria.\n\n<<<B>>>"
