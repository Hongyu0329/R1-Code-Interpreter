    "The search results confirm the approach I devised. Comparing strings character-by-character after converting them to lowercase is a standard and efficient method. The use of standard library functions like `strcasecmp` (or `stricmp`) is also mentioned, but as my analysis showed, a manual implementation avoids an extra variable to store the function's result and gives fine-grained control, allowing the use of a `char` for the loop index to minimize memory. The articles do not suggest any C language feature that would allow solving this with less variable memory than storing the two input strings. Therefore, my calculation for the most memory-efficient approach remains valid.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem and the calculation of the total memory used for its variables.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/*\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is designed to be as memory-efficient as possible by minimizing\n * the number and size of variables.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Two character arrays are required to store the input strings.\n    // The problem guarantees a maximum length of 100, so a size of 101\n    // is needed to accommodate the null terminator ('\\0').\n    // Memory for s1: 101 bytes (sizeof(char) is 1)\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Memory for s2: 101 bytes\n    char s2[101];\n\n    // Read the two strings from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n    scanf(\"%s\", s2);\n\n    // A loop counter is needed. A 'char' is used instead of an 'int'\n    // because the string length (0-100) fits within the range of a char,\n    // and a char uses only 1 byte of memory, whereas an int typically uses 4.\n    // Memory for i: 1 byte\n    char i = 0;\n\n    // The loop continues until the null terminator of the first string is found.\n    // Since both strings are guaranteed to have the same length, we only\n    // need to check one.\n    while (s1[i]) {\n        // The characters are converted to lowercase for comparison on the fly\n        // using the tolower() function from <ctype.h>. This avoids creating\n        // temporary variables to hold the lowercase characters.\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(s2[i])) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit as soon as the result is known.\n        }\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(s2[i])) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit as soon as the result is known.\n        }\n        // If characters are equal, move to the next.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, it means all characters were equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (`m`)\n\nThe total memory `m` used by the variables in this program is calculated by summing the memory allocated for each declared variable:\n\n*   **`char s1[101];`**: An array of 101 characters. Since `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte, this variable uses **101 bytes**.\n*   **`char s2[101];`**: An array of 101 characters. This also uses **101 bytes**.\n*   **`char i;`**: A single character variable used as a loop index. This uses **1 byte**.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables:\n\n`m = sizeof(s1) + sizeof(s2) + sizeof(i)`\n`m = 101 + 101 + 1`\n`m = 203` bytes\n\n<<<203>>>"
