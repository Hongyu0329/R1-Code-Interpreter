    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3 can be calculated using the epsilon (ε) expansion. The starting point for this expansion is the upper critical dimension, which for a system described by the Ising model (or more generally, φ⁴ theory) is d_c = 4. The epsilon expansion involves calculating critical exponents as a power series in ε = d_c - d.\n\nFor the specific heat exponent α of the O(n)-symmetric φ⁴ model, the epsilon expansion to the first order is given by:\n\nα = (4 - n)ε / (2(n + 8)) + O(ε²)\n\nFor the Ising model, the order parameter is a scalar, which corresponds to n=1. The spatial dimension is given as d=3, therefore ε = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nSubstituting n=1 and ε=1 into the formula, we get:\n\nα = (4 - 1) * 1 / (2 * (1 + 8)) = 3 / (2 * 9) = 3 / 18 = 1/6\n\nThus, to the first order in the epsilon expansion, the specific heat exponent α is 1/6.\n\nA simpler first-order formula is also found in some contexts, α = ε/6, which for n=1 gives the same result.\n\nTo the second order in ε, the expression for α is:\n\nα = (4 - n)ε / (2(n + 8)) - (n+2)²(n²+22n+52)ε² / (4(n+8)³)\n\nFor n=1 and ε=1, the second-order term would provide a correction to the initial 1/6 value. However, the question implies using the epsilon expansion near the upper critical dimension, and typically, the first-order result is the primary estimate.\n\nThe value of the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3, to the first order in the epsilon expansion, is approximately 0.167.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
