    "A \"self-avoiding walk\" is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The \"Manhattan lattice\" is another term for the square lattice. My search results provide a list of the number of self-avoiding walks for various step lengths on a square lattice. I can directly use this information to find a(10).\n\nThe number of n-step self-avoiding walks, a(n), on a square lattice for n=10 is 44100.\n\nThe sequence of the number of self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A001411. The provided search result gives the number of self-avoiding walks of length N on a square lattice, and for N=10, the value is 44,100.\n\nTherefore, a(10) is 44100.\nThe final answer is 44100.\n<<<44100>>>A self-avoiding walk is a sequence of moves on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. For a Manhattan lattice, which is equivalent to a square lattice, the number of possible self-avoiding walks of a specific length, denoted as a(n) for n steps, has been a subject of significant study.\n\nWhile there is no simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n, computer simulations have been used to enumerate the number of self-avoiding walks for various lengths. Based on these enumerations, the value for a 10-step self-avoiding walk on a square lattice has been determined.\n\nThe number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100. This value is part of a sequence of numbers corresponding to the count of self-avoiding walks for different step lengths. The sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences under the identifier A001411.\n\n"
