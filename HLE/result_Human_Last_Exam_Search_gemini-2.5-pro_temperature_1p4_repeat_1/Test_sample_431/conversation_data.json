    "The human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor contains a single cysteine residue in its TM3-TM4 linker domain.\n\nThe structure of GABAA receptor subunits, including the ρ1 subunit, consists of a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4), and a substantial intracellular loop connecting TM3 and TM4. This intracellular loop is the TM3-TM4 linker.\n\nAnalysis of the amino acid sequence of the human GABAAρ1 receptor (encoded by the GABRR1 gene) reveals the precise locations of these domains. While the exact start and end positions of the transmembrane domains can vary slightly depending on the prediction method, the TM3-TM4 linker region consistently contains only one cysteine residue. This specific intracellular cysteine is located at position 364 of the protein sequence.\n\n<<<1>>>"
