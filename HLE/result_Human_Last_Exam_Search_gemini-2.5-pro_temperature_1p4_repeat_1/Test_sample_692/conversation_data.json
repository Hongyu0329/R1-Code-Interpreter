    "**The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is \"3 Ajaw,\" corresponding to a day in the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar. This inscription was found on a ceramic cylinder seal at San Andrés, Tabasco, Mexico, and is attributed to the Olmec civilization. The artifact has been dated to approximately 650 BCE.**\n\nThis significant discovery pushes back the timeline for writing in the Americas and suggests that the Olmecs were among the first to develop a system of written communication and a sacred calendar. The \"3 Ajaw\" glyph represents both a specific day and can be interpreted as the name of a ruler, highlighting the connection between writing, the calendar, and kingship in early Mesoamerican societies.\n\nWhile other ancient inscriptions with dates exist, the San Andrés artifact remains the oldest confirmed example. For instance, Monument 3 at the Zapotec site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca features a calendrical glyph, \"1 Earthquake,\" which is dated by some to around 600 BCE. However, the dating of this monument is subject to more scholarly debate than the San Andrés find.\n\nLater, more complex dating systems emerged, such as the Long Count calendar. The earliest known inscription using the Long Count is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, and corresponds to December 36 BCE. In the Maya region, a glyph for \"7 Deer\" found at San Bartolo, Guatemala, has been securely dated to between 300 and 200 BCE. Both of these examples, however, are considerably more recent than the Olmec \"3 Ajaw\" inscription.\n\n<<<c. 650 BCE>>>"
