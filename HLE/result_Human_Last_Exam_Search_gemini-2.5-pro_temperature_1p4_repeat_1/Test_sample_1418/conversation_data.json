    "To determine the Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we will proceed by analyzing the structure of the field extension.\n\n**1. The Base Field**\n\nLet's first consider the field $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\nThis extension is Galois, as it is the splitting field of the polynomial $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$, is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$. The four automorphisms are determined by their actions on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n*   $id$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $s_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $s_3$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n*   $s_4$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\n**2. The Full Extension**\n\nNow let's consider the full field $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\nLet $\\delta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Notice that $\\delta \\in F$.\nThus, $L = F(\\sqrt{\\delta})$. The degree of the extension $L/F$ is either 1 or 2.\n\n**3. Degree of the Extension L/F**\n\nThe degree $[L:F]$ is 2 if and only if $\\delta$ is not a square in $F$. To check this, we can compute the norm of $\\delta$ from $F$ down to the subfield $K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe automorphism of $F/K_2$ is $s_3$. The norm is:\n$N_{F/K_2}(\\delta) = \\delta \\cdot s_3(\\delta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$N_{F/K_2}(\\delta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nIf $\\delta$ were a square in $F$, say $\\delta = \\theta^2$ for some $\\theta \\in F$, then its norm $N_{F/K_2}(\\delta)$ must be a square in $K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis would imply that $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which in turn means that $6$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's assume $6 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$6 = a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $a,b$ are rational, the term with $\\sqrt{2}$ must vanish, so $2ab=0$. This implies either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\n*   If $a=0$, then $6 = 2b^2$, which means $b^2=3$. This is not possible for $b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   If $b=0$, then $6 = a^2$. This is not possible for $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nTherefore, $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and so $\\delta$ is not a square in $F$.\nThis proves that $[L:F] = 2$.\nThe total degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:F] \\cdot [F:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**4. The Galois Group G = Gal(L/Q)**\n\nThe extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois. Let $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nWe have a tower of Galois extensions $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset F \\subset L$.\nLet $H = \\text{Gal}(L/F) \\cong C_2$. $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\nThe quotient group is $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\nFurthermore, because $H$ has order 2, its automorphism group is trivial. This implies that $H$ is a central subgroup of $G$. Thus, $G$ is an abelian group of order 8.\nThe possible abelian groups of order 8 are:\n1.  $C_8$ (the cyclic group of order 8)\n2.  $C_4 \\times C_2$ (the direct product of cyclic groups of order 4 and 2)\n3.  $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$\n\nThe quotient group $G/H \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$ means that $G$ cannot be cyclic ($C_8$), as the quotient of a cyclic group is cyclic, and $C_2 \\times C_2$ is not.\nSo, $G$ is either $C_4 \\times C_2$ or $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n**5. Distinguishing between the remaining groups**\n\nTo determine which group it is, we can check for the existence of an element of order 4 in $G$.\nLet $\\tau$ be the non-trivial element of $H = \\text{Gal}(L/F)$. It is defined by $\\tau(\\sqrt{\\delta}) = -\\sqrt{\\delta}$ and it fixes $F$.\nLet $s_2 \\in \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$ be the automorphism given by $s_2(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$ and $s_2(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$.\nLet $\\tilde{s_2}$ be an extension of $s_2$ to an automorphism of $L$. Since the restriction of $\\tilde{s_2}^2$ to $F$ is $s_2^2=id$, $\\tilde{s_2}^2$ must be an element of $H = \\text{Gal}(L/F)$. So, $\\tilde{s_2}^2$ is either the identity or $\\tau$.\n\nLet's compute $\\tilde{s_2}^2(\\sqrt{\\delta})$.\nFirst, we must define the action of the lift $\\tilde{s_2}$ on $\\sqrt{\\delta}$. We know that $\\tilde{s_2}(\\sqrt{\\delta})^2 = s_2(\\delta) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\nLet's choose $\\tilde{s_2}(\\sqrt{\\delta}) = \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\nWe have the relation $\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} \\cdot \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\sqrt{(4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3}) = 3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{\\delta} \\cdot \\tilde{s_2}(\\sqrt{\\delta}) = 3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}$.\nThis gives $\\tilde{s_2}(\\sqrt{\\delta}) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\delta}}$.\n\nNow we compute $\\tilde{s_2}^2(\\sqrt{\\delta})$:\n$\\tilde{s_2}^2(\\sqrt{\\delta}) = \\tilde{s_2}(\\tilde{s_2}(\\sqrt{\\delta})) = \\tilde{s_2}\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\delta}}\\right) = \\frac{s_2(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})}{\\tilde{s_2}(\\sqrt{\\delta})}$.\nThe action on the numerator is $s_2(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3}) = -3\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3} = -(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})$.\nSo, $\\tilde{s_2}^2(\\sqrt{\\delta}) = \\frac{-(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})}{\\tilde{s_2}(\\sqrt{\\delta})} = \\frac{-(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})}{(3\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6})/\\sqrt{\\delta}} = -\\sqrt{\\delta}$.\nThis shows that $\\tilde{s_2}^2(\\sqrt{\\delta}) = \\tau(\\sqrt{\\delta})$. Thus, $\\tilde{s_2}^2 = \\tau$.\nSince $\\tau$ is not the identity, $\\tilde{s_2}$ is not an element of order 2.\nThe order of $\\tilde{s_2}$ is 4, because $\\tilde{s_2}^4 = (\\tilde{s_2}^2)^2 = \\tau^2 = id$.\n\nSince the Galois group $G$ has an element of order 4, it cannot be $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$. Therefore, the Galois group must be isomorphic to $C_4 \\times C_2$.\n\n<<<The Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the abelian group of order 8 with an element of order 4 which is not cyclic, i.e., $C_4 \\times C_2$.>>>"
