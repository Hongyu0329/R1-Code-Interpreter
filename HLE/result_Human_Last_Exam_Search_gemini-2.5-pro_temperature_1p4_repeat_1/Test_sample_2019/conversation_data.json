    "Unfortunately, after extensive research, the exact number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is not readily available in publicly accessible documents. This specific problem, which involves placing *k* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board where *k* is less than *n*, is a less common variation of the famous n-queens problem.\n\nMuch of the available information on the toroidal n-queens problem focuses on the case where the number of queens is equal to the board size (*n*). A significant result in this area is PÃ³lya's theorem, which states that a solution for placing *n* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board exists if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. This means that for a 5x5 board, solutions exist for placing 5 non-attacking queens. A 2025 preprint on the topic also mentions that the number of solutions for 5 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is 10.\n\nHowever, the problem of placing only 4 queens on the same board is not directly addressed by this theorem or in the related literature found. Solving this problem would require a dedicated computational search, likely using a backtracking algorithm, to enumerate all possible valid configurations. Such a computation has either not been performed or its results have not been published in a way that is easily discoverable through web searches. One MathOverflow post anecdotally mentions that \"4 queens could be placed into two non-attacking groups but not four individual ones,\" but this is in the context of a different, multi-colored queen problem and does not provide a definitive answer to the number of ways.\n\nThe problem can be framed in terms of graph theory by considering the \"queen's graph,\" where each square is a vertex and edges connect squares that a queen can move between. The number of ways to place *k* non-attacking queens is then the *k*-th coefficient of the independence polynomial of this graph. However, the independence polynomial for the 5x5 toroidal queens graph does not appear to be published.\n\nWithout a pre-computed result or the ability to perform the necessary computations, a definitive numerical answer cannot be provided at this time.\n\n<<<The answer is not available in the public domain and would require a dedicated computational search to determine.>>>"
