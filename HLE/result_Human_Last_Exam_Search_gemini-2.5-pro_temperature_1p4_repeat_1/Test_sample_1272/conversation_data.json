    "The current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat is **Ninh Bình Province**.\n\nIn 1408, the Trần dynasty loyalist leader Trần Ngỗi initiated a rebellion against the Ming forces. Ming General Mu Sheng was dispatched to suppress this uprising but was defeated. A significant engagement in this campaign was the Battle of Bô Cô, which took place in late 1408 and early 1409. Historical accounts indicate that Trần Ngỗi's initial base of operations was in what is now Ninh Bình Province, and the Battle of Bô Cô, where Mu Sheng's forces suffered a major setback forcing him to retreat, occurred in this region.\n\nWhile Mu Sheng was also involved in the later Battle of Chi Lăng in 1427 in Lạng Sơn Province, where the Ming army suffered another defeat, his first major personal defeat occurred in 1408 in the area of present-day Ninh Bình Province.\n\n<<<Ninh Bình Province>>>"
