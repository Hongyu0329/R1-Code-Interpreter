    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers has 2 double points.\n\nTo arrive at this answer, the curve's equation can be rewritten to highlight its structure as a perturbation of a simpler, singular curve. The equation is equivalent to:\n$y^2 = (x + 2x^2)^2 + 8x + 8x^5$\n$y^2 = (x(1+2x))^2 + 8x(1+x^5)$\n\nThe term $8x(1+x^5)$ has a 2-adic valuation of at least 3. This means that modulo a high power of 2, the curve resembles the singular curve $y^2 = (x(1+2x))^2$.\n\nThis simpler curve is reducible into two components:\n$y = x(1+2x)$ and $y = -x(1+2x)$.\n\nThese two components intersect where their y-values are equal, which implies $x(1+2x) = -x(1+2x)$, leading to $2x(1+2x) = 0$. The solutions are $x=0$ and $x=-1/2$. These intersection points are the singular points (nodes) of the unperturbed curve.\n\nThe addition of the perturbation term $8x(1+x^5)$ \"smooths out\" these singularities. In the theory of stable reduction, such a scenario, where the perturbation has a sufficiently high and uniform valuation, typically results in the stable model having a number of double points equal to the number of nodes of the unperturbed curve. Since there are two intersection points, the stable reduction of the original curve has two double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
