In a jointly exchangeable random graph, the probability to draw a link \(y_{ij}\) between two vertices *i* and *j* is given by \(W(U_i, U_j)\), where *W* is a symmetric measurable function from \(^2\) to determined by the random measure *F*, and \(U_i\) and \(U_j\) are independent random variables drawn from the uniform measure *U* on and associated with vertices *i* and *j*, respectively.
