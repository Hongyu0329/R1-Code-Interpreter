    "The currently used common name for the genus *Perdita* in their native range of North America is \"fairy bee.\" They are also sometimes referred to as \"miner bees.\"\n\nThe exact year this common name was coined is not officially documented. Common names, unlike formal scientific names, typically arise from widespread use over time rather than being formally designated in a specific year. While the genus *Perdita* was first described by Frederick Smith in 1853, and many of its species were named by entomologists like P.H. Timberlake and T.D.A. Cockerell, the origin of the colloquial name \"fairy bee\" remains untraceable to a specific date in available records. The name likely arose due to the bees' minute size and often vibrant, metallic coloration.\n\n<<<Fairy bee, Undocumented>>>"
