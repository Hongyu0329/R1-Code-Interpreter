    "The compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\nThe reaction proceeds via a directed ortho-lithiation mechanism. The starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, has two directing groups on the aromatic ring: a tertiary amide group (-CONEt2) at position 1 and a dimethylamino group (-NMe2) at position 3. In directed ortho-lithiation reactions, the organolithium reagent, in this case, sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) complexed with N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), selectively removes a proton from a position ortho to the directing group.\n\nBoth the tertiary amide and the tertiary amine are directing groups. However, the tertiary amide group is a significantly more powerful directing group than the tertiary amine group. The possible positions for lithiation are at C2 and C6 (ortho to the amide) and at C2 and C4 (ortho to the amine). Since the amide is the stronger directing group, lithiation will preferentially occur at one of its ortho positions.\n\nPosition 2 is ortho to both the strongly directing amide group and the weaker directing amine group. This leads to a cooperative activating effect, making the proton at C2 the most acidic on the ring. Consequently, the sec-BuLi/TMEDA complex will selectively deprotonate the C2 position to form an aryllithium intermediate.\n\nThis aryllithium intermediate then reacts with methyl iodide in the second step. The nucleophilic carbanion at position 2 attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide and forming a new carbon-carbon bond. This results in the final product, N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
