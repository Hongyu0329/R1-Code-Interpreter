    "Despite extensive research, there is no information available in the search results about a Belgian refugee named Andre Vernault who was suspected of being a German spy by British counterintelligence during World War II because he concealed his true profession.\n\nSearches for \"Andre Vernault\" in the context of WWII espionage and British counterintelligence have yielded no relevant results. Broader inquiries into the interrogation of Belgian refugees in the UK during the war, particularly at the Royal Victoria Patriotic School where such vetting took place, also do not contain any mention of a case matching this description. While many refugees were interrogated with suspicion due to the prevalent \"spy fever,\" and some actual spies were discovered, the specific story of a Belgian refugee concealing his profession and being mistaken for a spy does not appear in the available records under the name provided. It is possible the name is incorrect or the story is from a work of fiction, such as a novel or a dramatized series like \"Spycatcher.\"\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question as there is no information available about an individual named Andre Vernault in the context of World War II counterintelligence in the UK."
