    "The Whitehead formula provides a method for calculating the Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant), a topological invariant that characterizes the linking of preimages of a map from a 3-sphere (S³) to a 2-sphere (S²). For a normalized vector field **n**(x,y,z) in 3D space that approaches a constant direction at infinity, the space can be considered a 3-sphere. The vector field itself defines a map to the 2-sphere of possible directions.\n\nThe Hopf charge H can be calculated using the Whitehead integral formula:\nH = - (1/4π²) ∫ **B** ⋅ **A** dV\nwhere **B** is the \"emergent magnetic field\" and **A** is its vector potential (**B** = ∇ × **A**). The emergent field **B** is defined by the spatial derivatives of the vector field **n**:\nBᵢ = ½ εᵢⱼₖ **n** ⋅ (∂ⱼ**n** × ∂ₖ**n**)\n\nFor a vector field parameterized in spherical coordinates as the one provided:\n**n** = (sin(G)cos(f), sin(G)sin(f), cos(G))\n\nthe emergent field simplifies to **B** = sin(G) (∇G × ∇f).\n\nWhile the direct computation of the integral is complex, the Hopf charge can be determined by analyzing the topological structure of the field. The Hopf charge is an integer that represents the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on the target sphere.\n\nLet's analyze the provided vector field:\n*   **f = atan2(y,x)**: This is the azimuthal angle, which winds by 2π (a factor of 1) as one circles the z-axis.\n*   **G = π * exp(-10*r2)**: The function `G` acts as the polar angle on the sphere of directions.\n    *   At infinity (as `x, y,` or `z` → ∞), `r2` → ∞, which makes `G` → 0. In this case, `cos(G)` → 1, and the vector field **n** → (0, 0, 1). This confirms the field is uniform at infinity, allowing the 3D space to be treated as S³.\n    *   The maximum value of `G` occurs when `r2` is at its minimum, which is `r2 = 0`. This happens on the circle defined by `x² + y² = 0.5` and `z = 0`. On this circle, `G = π`. Here, `cos(G) = -1`, and the vector field **n** is (0, 0, -1).\n\nThe preimage of the \"north pole\" of the target sphere (**n** = (0,0,1)) is the point at infinity. The preimage of the \"south pole\" (**n** = (0,0,-1)) is the circle `x² + y² = 0.5` in the `z=0` plane. In the topology of the 3-sphere, the point at infinity and this circle are linked exactly once.\n\nThis linking number of 1 is precisely what the Hopf charge quantifies. The given field is a standard representation of a single hopfion, which by definition has a Hopf charge of 1. The winding of `f` is 1, and the profile of `G` ensures a full mapping onto the sphere of directions, resulting in a single \"twist\" of the field lines in 3D space.\n\nTherefore, the application of the Whitehead formula to this vector field yields a Hopf charge of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
