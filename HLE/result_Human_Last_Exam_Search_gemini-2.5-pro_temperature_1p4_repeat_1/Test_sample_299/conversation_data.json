    "The initial analysis of the properties of a continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is largely correct. Here's a summary of the key properties of any such function $f$:\n\n*   **Injectivity:** As $\\exp(x)$ is injective, $f$ must be injective.\n*   **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic.\n*   **Increasing:** The composition of two decreasing functions is increasing, and the composition of two increasing functions is increasing. Since $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, $f$ must be strictly increasing. If $f$ were decreasing, $f \\circ f$ would be increasing. However, as shown below, a decreasing $f$ leads to a contradiction.\n*   **No Fixed Points:** If $f(x_0) = x_0$ for some $x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = x_0$, which would mean $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. The equation $\\exp(x)=x$ has no real solutions. Thus, $f$ has no fixed points.\n*   **f(x) > x:** Since $f$ is continuous and has no fixed points, we must have either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$. If $f(x) < x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. But $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, and it is a known fact that $\\exp(x) > x$ for all real $x$. This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, any continuous solution must satisfy $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.\n\nThe construction of such functions, often called \"functional square roots\" or \"half-exponentials,\" is non-trivial. It has been established that there are infinitely many such solutions. The general idea for constructing these solutions involves defining the function on an interval and then using the functional equation to extend it to the entire real line.\n\nOne method of construction proceeds as follows:\n1.  A solution $f$ must have a unique point $a < 0$ such that $f(a) = 0$.\n2.  The function $f$ maps the interval $(-\\infty, a]$ to $(a, 0]$.\n3.  One can \"choose\" a continuous, increasing, and surjective function $h: (-\\infty, a] \\to (a, 0]$. This choice then uniquely determines the continuous extension of $f$ to the entire real line that satisfies $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nThe freedom to choose the function $h$ on the interval $(-\\infty, a]$ determines the cardinality of the set of solutions. The set of continuous and strictly increasing functions from one interval to another has the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$, which is the cardinality of the real numbers. A continuous function is determined by its values on the rational numbers, and the cardinality of the set of all functions from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$. Since there is at least a continuum of choices for the initial function segment (the function $h$ mentioned above), and each choice leads to a unique solution, the set of all such functions $f$ has at least the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nConversely, the total number of continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the number of solutions cannot exceed $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nBy the Cantor-SchrÃ¶der-Bernstein theorem, since the cardinality is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, it must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nFinal check:\n*   There exist continuous solutions to $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n*   The construction of these solutions involves choosing an arbitrary continuous increasing function on a certain interval.\n*   The number of such choices is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   The total number of continuous functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThus, the cardinality of the set of these functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the set of real numbers).>>>"
