The ideal Ni/Ce ratio depends on the specific application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range is between 7% and 12.5% nickel. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies between the two half-reactions: for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), a higher nickel content (Ni/Ce atomic ratio of 3:1) is beneficial, while for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), a lower nickel content (Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2) is preferred.
