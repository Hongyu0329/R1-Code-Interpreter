    "### Ideal Nickel-to-Ceria Ratio Varies for Catalytic Reactions\n\n**The optimal ratio of nickel (Ni) to ceria (CeO₂) in nanoparticles is not a one-size-fits-all answer, differing significantly for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS), according to recent studies.**\n\nFor the **Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, a key process in producing high-purity hydrogen, the most effective Ni content on a ceria support generally falls between **7% and 12.5%**. A study focused on the reverse WGS reaction pinpointed an optimal nickel proportion of approximately 7% molar. Another investigation into WGS catalysts found that while nickel content from 5 to 12.5 wt% showed high activity, the performance peaked with 10 to 12.5 wt% Ni, achieving nearly 95% carbon monoxide conversion. Beyond the ratio, the dispersion of nickel is also a critical factor; one study showed that a low concentration of 2.5 atomic % Ni, when atomically dispersed, was highly effective and suppressed the formation of methane, an unwanted byproduct.\n\nIn the case of **water splitting**, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is dependent on the specific electrochemical half-reaction. For the **oxygen evolution reaction (OER)**, a higher nickel content is advantageous. Research has shown that Ni/Ce atomic ratios of **3:1 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ)** and **1:1 (Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ)** lead to superior OER activity, which is attributed to an increased concentration of oxygen vacancies. The Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ formulation, in particular, has demonstrated excellent long-term stability.\n\nConversely, for the **hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)**, a lower nickel content appears to be more favorable. A study utilizing Ni₃N-CeO₂/NF catalysts determined that a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2** was optimal for HER performance.\n\nFor **overall water splitting**, which involves both HER and OER, research has explored co-doping ceria with nickel and other elements. One promising approach involved a high doping level of 20 mol% of nickel and iron combined, in a 1:1 ratio, which showed excellent activity for both reactions.\n\nIn summary, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio must be tailored to the specific catalytic application. The synthesis method and the resulting nanoparticle morphology also play a significant role in the catalyst's ultimate performance.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio depends on the specific application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range is between 7% and 12.5% nickel. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies between the two half-reactions: for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), a higher nickel content (Ni/Ce atomic ratio of 3:1) is beneficial, while for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), a lower nickel content (Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2) is preferred.>>>"
