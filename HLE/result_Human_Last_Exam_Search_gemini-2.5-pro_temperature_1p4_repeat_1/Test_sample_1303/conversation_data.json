    "The small molecule CHEMBL4803817 interacts with the protein target N-acetylmuramic acid (CHEMBL2364037). N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) is a crucial component of the peptidoglycan layer in bacterial cell walls. Consequently, other small molecules that interfere with MurNAc or its role in peptidoglycan synthesis can be considered to have protein-ligand interactions with the same biological macromolecule or pathway.\n\nSeveral classes of small molecules are known to interact with or inhibit the synthesis and function of N-acetylmuramic acid and the resulting peptidoglycan layer:\n\n*   **Fosfomycin**: This antibiotic directly inhibits the synthesis of N-acetylmuramic acid by targeting the enzyme MurA (enolpyruvyl-UDP-GlcNAc synthase). This enzyme catalyzes an early and essential step in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan.\n\n*   **β-lactam Antibiotics**: This broad class of antibiotics, which includes penicillins and cephalosporins, does not directly bind to MurNAc itself but inhibits the enzymes responsible for cross-linking the peptidoglycan chains, of which MurNAc is a fundamental part.\n\n*   **Vancomycin**: This glycopeptide antibiotic functions by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine portion of the peptide side chains of the peptidoglycan precursors, effectively preventing their incorporation into the growing peptidoglycan wall.\n\n*   **Cycloserine**: As a structural analog of D-alanine, cycloserine inhibits the enzymes that add alanine to the peptide side chain of MurNAc, thus disrupting peptidoglycan synthesis.\n\n*   **Bacitracin**: This antibiotic hinders the recycling of the lipid carrier molecule that transports the N-acetylmuramic acid-peptide precursors across the cell membrane for assembly into the cell wall.\n\n*   **UDP-N-acetylmuramic Acid (UDP-MurNAc)**: This molecule is the product of the MurB enzyme and serves as a feedback inhibitor of the MurA enzyme, thereby regulating peptidoglycan precursor synthesis.\n\n*   **Tetrahydrocarbazoles (THCz)**: These are small molecules that have been identified to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to lipid II, a key precursor molecule that contains N-acetylmuramic acid.\n\n*   **N-acetylmuramic acid analogs**: Various synthetic analogs of N-acetylmuramic acid have been created by scientists to study and potentially inhibit the processes of peptidoglycan synthesis and recycling.\n\n*   **Bioorthogonal N-acetylmuramic acid probes**: These are chemically modified versions of MurNAc that can be incorporated into bacterial peptidoglycan for research purposes, allowing scientists to study the dynamics of the cell wall.\n\n<<<The small molecules that will form some kind of protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 are other molecules that target N-acetylmuramic acid and the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway. These include antibiotics such as Fosfomycin, β-lactams (e.g., penicillin), Vancomycin, Cycloserine, and Bacitracin, as well as naturally occurring inhibitors like UDP-MurNAc, and synthetic molecules like tetrahydrocarbazoles and various N-acetylmuramic acid analogs.>>>"
