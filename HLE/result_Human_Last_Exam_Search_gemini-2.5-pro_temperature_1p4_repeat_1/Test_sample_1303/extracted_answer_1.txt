The small molecules that will form some kind of protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 are other molecules that target N-acetylmuramic acid and the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway. These include antibiotics such as Fosfomycin, Î²-lactams (e.g., penicillin), Vancomycin, Cycloserine, and Bacitracin, as well as naturally occurring inhibitors like UDP-MurNAc, and synthetic molecules like tetrahydrocarbazoles and various N-acetylmuramic acid analogs.
