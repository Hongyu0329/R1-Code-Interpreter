    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Parnassus**.\n\nSeveral mountains are referenced in Homer's epic poem. Besides Mount Olympus, the dwelling place of the gods, the most notable are Mount Ida, Mount Pelion, and Mount Parnassus.\n\n*   **Mount Parnassus**, located in central Greece, has a highest peak of 2,457 meters (8,061 feet). Many of its ancient communities are cited in the *Iliad*.\n\n*   **Mount Ida** is the name of two significant mountains in Greek mythology. The Mount Ida more central to the *Iliad*'s narrative is in modern-day Turkey, near the site of ancient Troy. This is the mountain from which the gods are said to have observed the Trojan War. Its highest peak, known today as Kaz Dağı, is 1,774 meters (5,820 feet) high. There is another, taller Mount Ida on the island of Crete, which stands at 2,456 meters (8,058 feet). While rich in mythology, its role in the *Iliad* is less direct than its Anatolian counterpart.\n\n*   **Mount Pelion** in Thessaly is also mentioned in the *Iliad*, most famously as the origin of the ash spear of Achilles. Its highest summit is 1,624 meters (5,328 feet).\n\n*   **Mount Othrys**, another mountain in central Greece with a height of 1,726 meters (5,663 feet), is associated with the Titans. While linked to Achilles' homeland in some contexts, its direct mention within the text of the *Iliad* is less explicit than the others.\n\nWhen comparing their elevations, Mount Parnassus is the tallest among those historically mentioned in the *Iliad*, apart from Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
