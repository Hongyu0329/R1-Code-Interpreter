    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n*   **Toluene's Atomic Composition**: The molecule consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n*   **Basis Functions for Carbon (C)**: For a \"heavy\" atom (any atom other than H or He), the 6-31G basis set is defined as follows:\n    *   **Core Orbitals (1s)**: The \"6-\" signifies that the core 1s orbital is described by a single contracted function, which is a combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p)**: The \"-31\" indicates a split-valence basis set.\n        *   The inner valence shell (one 2s and three 2p orbitals) is represented by 4 contracted functions, each made from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   The outer valence shell is also represented by 4 contracted functions (one 2s and three 2p), but each consists of a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   This results in a total of 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 basis functions per Carbon atom**.\n\n*   **Basis Functions for Hydrogen (H)**: Hydrogen atoms have no core electrons. The 6-31G basis set describes the 1s valence orbital with two basis functions:\n    *   An inner part represented by a contracted function of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   An outer part represented by a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   This results in a total of **2 basis functions per Hydrogen atom**.\n\n*   **Total Calculation**:\n    *   For the 7 Carbon atoms: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n    *   For the 8 Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n    *   The total number of contracted Gaussian functions is 63 + 16 = **79**.\n\n<<<79>>>"
