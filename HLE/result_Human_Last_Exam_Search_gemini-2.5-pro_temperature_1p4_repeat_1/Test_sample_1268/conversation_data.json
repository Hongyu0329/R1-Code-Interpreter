    "An upper bound for the maximum norm in the context of modular forms for squarefree natural numbers $N$ has been a significant area of research. The notation $(k_{k,\\infty})$ is interpreted as the sup-norm (or $L^\\infty$-norm), denoted $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, of a Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $f$ for the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$. The subscript 'k' is understood as a parameter on which the bound may depend, typically the Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The covolume $(V)$ refers to the volume of the modular curve $Y_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$.\n\nThe level $N$ of the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ and the covolume $V$ are closely related. The volume of the fundamental domain for $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is given by the product of the index of $\\Gamma_0(N)$ in $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ and the volume of the fundamental domain for $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, which is $\\pi/3$. The index is given by the formula:\n$[\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)] = N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$\n\nThus, the covolume is $V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$. For large squarefree $N$, the product term grows very slowly, so the covolume $V$ is asymptotically proportional to the level $N$. This means that an upper bound in terms of $N$ can be directly translated into an upper bound in terms of $V$.\n\nThe problem of bounding the sup-norm of such forms as the level $N$ grows is known as the sup-norm problem in the level aspect. For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $f$ of square-free level $N$ and with Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$, a key result was established by Gergely Harcos and Nicolas Templier. They proved the following upper bound:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/6 + \\epsilon}$\n\nfor any $\\epsilon > 0$, where the implied constant depends on the Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and $\\epsilon$.\n\nGiven the relationship $V \\asymp N$, this bound can be expressed in terms of the covolume $V$:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6 + \\epsilon}$\n\nThis inequality provides an upper bound for the maximum norm of a Hecke-Maass cusp form in relation to the covolume for squarefree levels.\n\n<<<An upper bound for the maximum norm $\\|f\\|_\\infty$ of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $f$ with Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$ for the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ with squarefree level $N$, in relation to the covolume $V$ of the modular curve $Y_0(N)$, is given by $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.>>>"
