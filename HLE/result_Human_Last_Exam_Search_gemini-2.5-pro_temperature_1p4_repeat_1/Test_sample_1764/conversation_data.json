    "It is possible for there to be zero isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of a given cardinality $K$.\n\nHere is a constructive proof for this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Selection of the Banach Space**: Let's consider a finite-dimensional Banach space. A Banach space $B$ of finite dimension $N$ over the real numbers is isometrically isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^N$ with some norm. The cardinality of such a space for $N \\ge 1$ is the cardinality of the continuum, so we can choose $K$ to be this value. Let's choose our Banach space to be $B = \\mathbb{R}^N$ equipped with the standard Euclidean norm for a fixed integer $N \\ge 1$.\n\n2.  **Selection of the Finite Ultrametric Space**: A key result concerning the isometric embedding of ultrametric spaces into finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces is that a finite ultrametric space with $n$ points can be isometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^N$ only if $n \\le N+1$. This result is a consequence of the properties of ultrametric spaces and their geometric realization.\n\n3.  **Constructing a case with zero embeddings**: We can now choose a finite ultrametric space $X$ for which an isometric embedding into our chosen Banach space $B$ does not exist.\n    *   Let the Banach space be $B = \\mathbb{R}^2$, which has the cardinality of the continuum. Here, $N=2$.\n    *   Let the finite ultrametric space $X$ be a set of 4 points, for instance, $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$, with the discrete metric, where the distance between any two distinct points is 1. This is a valid ultrametric space. For this space, the number of points is $n=4$.\n    *   According to the condition mentioned above, since $n = 4 > N+1 = 3$, this ultrametric space $X$ cannot be isometrically embedded into $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nSince we have found a valid pair of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ (of cardinality of the continuum) for which there are no isometric embeddings, the number of such embeddings is 0.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ in a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$ is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
