    "This problem asks for the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}. The precedence of operators is ! > & > |, and symbols can be repeated.\n\nLet's break down the problem by categorizing the possible structures of a 5-symbol expression.\n\n### Category 1: Expressions without Parentheses\n\nThese expressions are evaluated based on the standard operator precedence: `!` (NOT), then `&` (AND), then `|` (OR).\n\n1.  **Unary Operator Only:**\n    *   An expression can be formed by repeatedly applying the `!` operator to a single literal (`T` or `F`).\n    *   `!!!!T` uses 5 symbols (`!`, `!`, `!`, `!`, `T`). It evaluates as `!(!(!(!T)))` which is `!(!(!(F)))` -> `!(!(T))` -> `!(F)` -> `T`. This is a true expression.\n    *   `!!!!F` evaluates to `F`.\n    *   Total: **1** expression.\n\n2.  **Two Binary Operators:**\n    *   This covers expressions of the form `A op1 B op2 C`, where `A`, `B`, `C` are literals (`T` or `F`) and `op1`, `op2` are binary operators (`&` or `|`). This structure uses 5 symbols.\n    *   We analyze the 4 possible combinations of operators:\n        *   `A & B & C`: Due to associativity, this is `(A & B) & C`. This is true only if all three literals are `T`. So, `T & T & T` is the only true expression. (1)\n        *   `A | B | C`: This is `(A | B) | C`. This is true if at least one literal is `T`. It is false only if all are `F`. Out of 2Â³ = 8 combinations of literals, 7 are true. (7)\n        *   `A & B | C`: Precedence makes this `(A & B) | C`. This is true if `C` is `T`, or if `A` and `B` are both `T`. This is true for `TTT`, `TTF`, `TFT`, `FTT`, `FFT`. (5)\n        *   `A | B & C`: Precedence makes this `A | (B & C)`. This is true if `A` is `T`, or if `B` and `C` are both `T`. This is true for `TTT`, `TTF`, `TFT`, `TFF`, `FTT`. (5)\n    *   Total: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18** expressions.\n\n3.  **One Binary Operator and Negations:**\n    *   These expressions must also have a total of 5 symbols.\n    *   `!!A op B`: e.g., `!!T & T`. `A` and `B` are literals. `!!` takes 2 symbols, `op` takes 1, A and B take 1 each. Total is 5.\n        *   True expressions: `!!T & T`, `!!T | T`, `!!T | F`, `!!F | T`. (4)\n    *   `A op !!B`: Symmetrical to the above.\n        *   True expressions: `T & !!T`, `T | !!T`, `T | !!F`, `F | !!T`. (4)\n    *   `!A op !B`: e.g., `!F & !F`. Each `!A` or `!B` takes 2 symbols, plus 1 for the operator. Total is 5.\n        *   True expressions: `!F & !F`, `!T | !F`, `!F | !T`, `!F | !F`. (4)\n    *   Total: 4 + 4 + 4 = **12** expressions.\n\nTotal without parentheses: 1 + 18 + 12 = 31.\n\n### Category 2: Expressions with Parentheses\n\nParentheses are used to group sub-expressions and override the default precedence. A pair of `()` adds 2 symbols.\n\n1.  **Outermost Parentheses:**\n    *   The structure is `( E )`, where `E` is a valid expression of 3 symbols. The parentheses add 2 symbols for a total of 5. The expression is true if `E` evaluates to true.\n    *   Valid 3-symbol expressions `E` that are true:\n        *   `T & T`\n        *   `T | T`\n        *   `T | F`\n        *   `F | T`\n        *   `!!T`\n    *   This gives 5 corresponding true expressions: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `(!!T)`.\n    *   Total: **5** expressions.\n\n2.  **Negation of a Parenthesized Expression:**\n    *   The structure is `! ( E )`. The symbols are `!`, `(`, `)`, plus the symbols in `E`. To have a total of 5 symbols, `E` must have 2 symbols.\n    *   Valid 2-symbol expressions `E`: `!T` (evaluates to F) and `!F` (evaluates to T).\n    *   If `E` is `!T`, the full expression is `!(!T)`. `!T` is F, so `!(F)` is T. This is a true expression.\n    *   If `E` is `!F`, the full expression is `!(!F)`. `!F` is T, so `!(T)` is F.\n    *   Total: **1** expression.\n\n3.  **One Parenthesized Literal:**\n    *   The structure is `(A) op B` or `A op (B)`, where `A` and `B` are single literals. The symbols are `(`, `A`, `)`, `op`, `B`. Total length is 5. Since `(A)` is equivalent to `A`, the logic is the same as for `A op B`.\n    *   `(A) op B`: True expressions are `(T)&T`, `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`. (4)\n    *   `A op (B)`: True expressions are `T&(T)`, `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`. (4)\n    *   Total: 4 + 4 = **8** expressions.\n\nTotal with parentheses: 5 + 1 + 8 = 14.\n\n### Final Count\n\nSumming up the counts from all categories:\n*   Without Parentheses: 31\n*   With Parentheses: 14\n\nTotal True Expressions = 31 + 14 = 45.\n\n<<<45>>>"
