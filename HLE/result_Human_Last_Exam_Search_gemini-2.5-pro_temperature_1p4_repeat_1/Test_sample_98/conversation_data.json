    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is positioned to stand on one of its flat faces, the surface of the water when the tank is half-filled will be a **hexagon**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why this is the case:\n\n*   **Orientation of the Icosahedron:** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces. Due to its high degree of symmetry, for any given face, there is a corresponding parallel face on the opposite side. When the tank stands on one face, this face serves as the base, and its parallel counterpart is at the top.\n\n*   **Water Level at Half-Full:** The water surface in a stationary container under the influence of gravity will always be a horizontal plane. When the tank is half-full by volume, this horizontal plane of the water's surface will be exactly halfway up the height of the tank. Because of the icosahedron's symmetry, this mid-level plane passes through the geometric center of the shape.\n\n*   **The Cross-Sectional Shape:** The shape of the water surface is determined by the cross-section of the icosahedron at this mid-level. The horizontal plane at half the tank's height intersects a \"belt\" of the icosahedron's other triangular faces that are situated between the top and bottom faces.\n\nThe intersection of this plane with the icosahedron forms a hexagon. However, it is important to note that this hexagon is not regular; it will have sides of alternating lengths. This is because the edges of the icosahedron that are cut by this mid-plane form a zig-zag pattern around the \"equator\" of the solid in this orientation. The resulting hexagonal cross-section possesses three-fold rotational symmetry, consistent with the triangular nature of the base and top faces.\n\n<<<hexagon>>>"
