    "Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\nLet the 8-point sequence be denoted by y(n), where\ny(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}.\n\nWe need to find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of this 8-point sequence. Let's call it Y(k).\nBy definition, the N-point DFT of an M-point sequence z(n) is given by:\nZ(k) =  ∑_(n=0)^(M-1)▒z(n) e^(-j 2πkn/N)\n\nIn our case, N=4 and M=8. So, the 4-point DFT is:\nY(k) =  ∑_(n=0)^(7)▒y(n) e^(-j 2πkn/4)  for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\nY(k) =  ∑_(n=0)^(7)▒y(n) e^(-j πkn/2)\n\nLet's relate this to the 8-point DFT of y(n), which we'll call Y_8(m):\nY_8(m) =  ∑_(n=0)^(7)▒y(n) e^(-j 2πmn/8) = ∑_(n=0)^(7)▒y(n) e^(-j πmn/4) for m = 0, ..., 7.\n\nBy comparing the two expressions, we can see that:\nY(k) = Y_8(2k) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\nThis means the desired 4-point DFT consists of the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of the sequence y(n).\n\nNext, we need to find the 8-point DFT, Y_8(m). The sequence y(n) is an interleaving of the sequences x(n) and h(n).\nThe even-indexed elements of y(n) are y(2n) = x(n) for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.\nThe odd-indexed elements of y(n) are y(2n+1) = h(n) for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nUsing the decimation-in-time property of the DFT, the 8-point DFT Y_8(m) can be expressed in terms of the 4-point DFTs of its even and odd parts, which are X(k) and H(k) respectively.\nLet W_N = e^(-j 2π/N). The property states:\nY_8(m) = X(m mod 4) + W_8^m * H(m mod 4) for m = 0, ..., 7.\n\nWe need to calculate Y_8(0), Y_8(2), Y_8(4), and Y_8(6).\n\n**For k=0:**\nY(0) = Y_8(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0)\nGiven X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j] and H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j].\nX(0) = 1, H(0) = 0.\nW_8^0 = 1.\nY(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1.\n\n**For k=1:**\nY(1) = Y_8(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)\nX(2) = -1, H(2) = 1.\nW_8^2 = e^(-j 2π*2/8) = e^(-j π/2) = -j.\nY(1) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j.\n\n**For k=2:**\nY(2) = Y_8(4) = X(4 mod 4) + W_8^4 * H(4 mod 4) = X(0) + W_8^4 * H(0)\nX(0) = 1, H(0) = 0.\nW_8^4 = e^(-j 2π*4/8) = e^(-j π) = -1.\nY(2) = 1 + (-1) * 0 = 1.\n\n**For k=3:**\nY(3) = Y_8(6) = X(6 mod 4) + W_8^6 * H(6 mod 4) = X(2) + W_8^6 * H(2)\nX(2) = -1, H(2) = 1.\nW_8^6 = e^(-j 2π*6/8) = e^(-j 3π/2) = j.\nY(3) = -1 + j * 1 = -1 + j.\n\nThus, the 4-point DFT of the given sequence is [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j].\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
