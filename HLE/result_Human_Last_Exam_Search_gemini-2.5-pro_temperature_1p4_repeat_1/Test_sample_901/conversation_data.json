    "The treatment of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol results in an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the chemical reasoning:\n*   **Reactants and Conditions:** The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which is a *trans* isomer of 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base, which strongly favors elimination reactions over substitution.\n*   **E2 Mechanism Requirement:** The E2 elimination mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (bromide) and the abstracted proton must be in an anti-periplanar configuration. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means both groups must be in axial positions, one pointing up and the other down.\n*   **Conformational Analysis:** The *trans*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations: one with both the bromine and the methyl group in equatorial positions, and another, less stable conformation where both groups are in axial positions.\n*   **Reaction Pathway:** For the E2 reaction to occur, the molecule must adopt the less stable diaxial conformation, where the bromine atom is axial. In this conformation, the proton on the same carbon as the methyl group (C2) is equatorial and thus cannot be abstracted. However, one of the protons on C6 is axial and anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n*   **Product Formation:** The bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, abstracts the available axial proton from C6. This leads to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6, resulting in the non-Zaitsev (or Hofmann-like) product, 3-methylcyclohexene. Although the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene) is the more thermodynamically stable alkene, it cannot be formed because the geometric requirement for the E2 elimination is not met.\n\nTherefore, the stereochemical constraints of the E2 mechanism dictate the outcome of the reaction, leading to the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
