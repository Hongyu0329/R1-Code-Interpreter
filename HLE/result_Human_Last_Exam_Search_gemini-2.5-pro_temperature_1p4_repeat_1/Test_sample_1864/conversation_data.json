    "To ensure a robust and accurate flow cytometry sorting experiment with five channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750) and involving streptavidin beads, you should prepare a minimum of 15 essential controls. These controls are vital for proper instrument setup, compensation, gating, and validation of your results.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n### **I. Instrument Setup and Baseline Controls (2 tubes)**\n*   **Unstained Control (1 tube):** This consists of your cells without any fluorescent labels. It's used to set the initial parameters on the flow cytometer and to measure the baseline autofluorescence of your cells.\n*   **Beads Alone Control (1 tube):** A sample containing only the streptavidin beads to assess their intrinsic fluorescence and ensure they do not interfere with the detection channels.\n\n### **II. Compensation Controls (5 tubes)**\nFor any multicolor flow cytometry experiment, you must correct for the spectral overlap where the fluorescence of one dye leaks into the detector for another. You will need one control for each fluorophore in your panel.\n*   **AF350 single-stain**\n*   **GFP single-stain**\n*   **PE single-stain**\n*   **AF647 single-stain**\n*   **AF750 single-stain**\n\n### **III. Gating and Specificity Controls (7 tubes)**\nThese controls are critical for accurately identifying and gating your population of interest for sorting.\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes):** An FMO control includes all the fluorescent labels in your panel *except one*. This is the most accurate way to set positive gates, as it accounts for the spillover and spread from all other fluorophores. You will need one FMO control for each of your five channels.\n*   **Viability Control (1 tube):** A sample stained only with a viability dye. This is to create a gate to exclude dead cells, which can non-specifically bind antibodies and give false-positive signals.\n*   **Streptavidin Non-Specific Binding Control (1 tube):** This sample should include your cells and the fluorescently labeled streptavidin, but not the biotinylated component it is supposed to detect. This is crucial to ensure the streptavidin itself is not binding non-specifically to the cells.\n\n### **IV. Biological Controls (at least 1 tube)**\n*   **Biological Negative Control (1 tube):** A sample of cells that are known *not* to express the marker of interest. This control helps to confirm the specificity of your staining. A positive biological control (cells known to express the marker) is also highly recommended to ensure the staining protocol worked.\n\nIn summary, the total number of essential control tubes to prepare is:\n\n*   **2** (Instrument/Baseline) + **5** (Compensation) + **7** (Gating/Specificity) + **1** (Biological) = **15**\n\n<<<15>>>"
