    "The outer hull of the great icosahedron is its convex hull. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron composed of 20 triangular faces.\n\nThe triangulation of a surface involves dividing it into a set of non-overlapping triangles. Since the faces of a regular icosahedron are already triangles, the surface is inherently triangulated by its own faces. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer hull (the regular icosahedron) is equal to its number of faces.\n\nAll 20 triangular faces of the regular icosahedron are on its exterior and are therefore visible from the outside.\n\nThus, the minimal number of triangles needed for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
