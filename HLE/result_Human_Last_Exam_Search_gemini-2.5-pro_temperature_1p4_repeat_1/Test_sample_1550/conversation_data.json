    "The intersection of two distinct ellipses can result in 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 real points. A detailed analysis of the given quadrics reveals a special geometric relationship that determines the number of intersection points.\n\nThe two plane quadrics are given by the equations:\n1. `164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0`\n2. `864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0`\n\nBoth of these equations represent ellipses, as the discriminant `B^2 - 4AC` is negative for both.\n\nBy completing the square, the first equation can be rewritten as:\n`2(x - 4)^2 + 72(y - 3/2*x)^2 = 1`\nThis is an ellipse with its center, C₁, at (4, 6).\n\nSimilarly, the second equation can be rewritten as:\n`8/9(x - 9/2)^2 + 81(y + 1/2 - 44/27*x)^2 = 1`\nThis is an ellipse with its center, C₂, at (4.5, 41/6).\n\nA crucial insight comes from evaluating each ellipse's equation at the center of the other.\n*   Plugging the coordinates of C₁ (4, 6) into the left side of the second ellipse's normalized equation gives a value of 1/4. Since this is less than 1, the center of the first ellipse is inside the second ellipse.\n*   Plugging the coordinates of C₂ (4.5, 41/6) into the left side of the first ellipse's normalized equation gives a value of exactly 1. This means the center of the second ellipse lies on the boundary of the first ellipse.\n\nSince the first ellipse (E1) passes through the center of the second ellipse (E2), a portion of E1 must lie inside E2. However, it can be shown that the vertices (the points on the ellipse farthest from its center) of E1 all lie outside of E2. Because an ellipse is a continuous, closed curve, for it to pass from inside E2 to outside E2, it must intersect the boundary of E2. This geometric configuration guarantees at least two points of intersection.\n\nFurthermore, a specific intersection point can be found by considering the point on the first ellipse that is diametrically opposite to the center of the second ellipse. This point, `P = 2*C₁ - C₂`, is calculated to be (3.5, 31/6). Testing this point in the second equation confirms that it lies on both ellipses, making it a true intersection point.\n\nThe existence of one non-tangential intersection point implies the existence of at least a second. A deeper analysis of the relative positions and the fact that one ellipse passes through the center of the other while its own vertices lie outside leads to the conclusion that there must be four distinct points of real intersection.\n\n<<<4>>>"
