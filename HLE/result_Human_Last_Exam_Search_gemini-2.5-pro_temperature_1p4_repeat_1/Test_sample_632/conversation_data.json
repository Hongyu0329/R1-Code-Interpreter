    "I have been unable to find any record of a unique architectural feature being removed from the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in 1950 by the city administration.\n\nExtensive research into the history of the Piazza della Rotonda has revealed several significant architectural changes over the centuries, but none that match the description of a feature being removed in 1950.\n\nHere is a summary of the notable alterations to the piazza:\n\n*   **15th Century:** Pope Eugenius IV ordered the clearing of a maze of medieval sheds and small shops that had grown up around the columns of the Pantheon, and the piazza was then laid out and paved.\n*   **1575:** Pope Gregory XIII commissioned the fountain in the center of the piazza, designed by Giacomo della Porta.\n*   **1711:** Pope Clement XI had the Egyptian obelisk, originally brought to Rome in ancient times, erected in the center of the fountain.\n*   **19th Century:** The piazza was known for its bustling market, which included bird-sellers, and stalls for flowers, fruits, and vegetables. There were also demolitions of some structures adjoining the north end of the square under Popes Pius VII and Pius IX to enlarge the piazza. Notably, in the late 19th century, twin bell towers, often called the \"ass's ears,\" were removed from the Pantheon itself, not the piazza.\n\nWhile there were proposals for significant changes to the piazza, such as a Napoleonic-era plan to demolish surrounding buildings, these were never implemented. There is no mention in the historical records found of any specific architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in the year 1950.\n\n<<<I was unable to find information about a unique architectural feature that was removed from the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in 1950. Historical sources detail other changes to the square over the centuries, but none match this specific event.>>>"
