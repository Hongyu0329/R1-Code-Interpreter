    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus at this equilibrium point.\n\n### 1. Market Equilibrium\n\nThe equilibrium point (Q_E, P_E) is found by setting the supply and demand equations equal to each other:\n\n*   **Supply:** P = ln(Q³ - 2)\n*   **Demand:** P = 18e^(-arctan(Q))\n\nTherefore, at equilibrium:\nln(Q_E³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))\n\nThis is a transcendental equation that cannot be solved algebraically. Using a numerical solver, we find the equilibrium quantity and price to be approximately:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Quantity (Q_E) ≈ 4.755**\n*   **Equilibrium Price (P_E) ≈ 4.608**\n\n### 2. Total Welfare\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS).\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from Q=0 to Q=Q_E. It is calculated by the integral:\n    CS = ∫[0 to Q_E] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - (P_E * Q_E)\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price, from the quantity at which supply begins to Q_E. The supply function is defined for Q > ∛2 (approximately 1.26). It is calculated by the integral:\n    PS = (P_E * Q_E) - ∫[∛2 to Q_E] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\nThe total welfare is the sum of these two surpluses:\nTotal Welfare = CS + PS = ∫[0 to Q_E] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - ∫[∛2 to Q_E] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\nThese integrals do not have simple elementary antiderivatives and must be evaluated numerically.\n\nBy performing numerical integration with the equilibrium values:\n\n1.  **Integral of the demand curve from 0 to 4.755:**\n    ∫[0 to 4.755] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ ≈ 38.608\n\n2.  **Integral of the supply curve from ∛2 to 4.755:**\n    ∫[1.26 to 4.755] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ ≈ 9.141\n\n3.  **Total Welfare Calculation:**\n    Total Welfare ≈ 38.608 - 9.141 ≈ 29.467\n\nThus, the total welfare is approximately 29.47.\n\n<<<29.47>>>"
