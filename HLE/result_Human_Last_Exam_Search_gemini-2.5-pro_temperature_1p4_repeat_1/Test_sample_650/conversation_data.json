    "To determine the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`, we must analyze the number of elementary operations it performs as a function of the input size.\n\n### Analysis of the Algorithm\n\n1.  **Input**:\n    *   `n`: The number to be converted.\n    *   `c`: The base to convert to.\n\n2.  **Initialization (Step 1)**:\n    *   `i := 0; x := n;`\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_0 := x — qc;`\n    This step involves a few assignments, one division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. These operations are executed once.\n\n3.  **Loop (Step 2)**:\n    *   The core of the algorithm is the `while q > 0` loop. We need to determine how many times this loop iterates.\n    *   In each iteration, the value of `x` is replaced by `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`.\n    *   Effectively, the value of the variable `q` is divided by `c` in each step.\n    *   The loop starts with `q` being roughly `n/c`. It continues until `q` becomes 0.\n    *   Let `k` be the number of iterations. The value of `q` will be successively `n/c`, `n/c²`, `n/c³`, ..., `n/c^(k+1)`.\n    *   The loop terminates when `n/c^(k+1)` becomes less than 1. This is equivalent to `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    *   Taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides gives `log_c(n) < k + 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of iterations `k` is approximately `log_c(n)`. The number of digits in the base-c representation of n is `floor(log_c(n)) + 1`, which is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n4.  **Operations within the loop (Step 2.1)**:\n    *   `i := i + 1; x := q;`\n    *   `q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`\n    *   Inside each loop iteration, a constant number of basic arithmetic operations are performed: an increment, an assignment, a division, a multiplication, and a subtraction.\n\n### Computational Model Assumptions\n\nThe overall complexity depends on the cost of the arithmetic operations (division and multiplication) on numbers as large as `n`.\n\n*   **RAM Model with O(1) Arithmetic**: If we assume a Random Access Machine (RAM) model where arithmetic operations on integers (that fit within a machine word) take constant time, O(1), the analysis is straightforward. This is a common assumption when `n` is not arbitrarily large. In this case, each iteration of the loop takes constant time. The total complexity would be the number of iterations multiplied by the constant time per iteration.\n    *   Complexity = `O(log_c(n)) * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`\n    *   A similar analysis confirms a time complexity of `O(log_base(n))`.\n\n*   **Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic**: If `n` is an arbitrarily large number that does not fit into a single machine word, its representation requires `O(log n)` bits. In this scenario, arithmetic operations are not O(1).\n    *   The division of an `m`-bit number by a small constant `c` (which has `O(log c)` bits) using the standard long division algorithm takes `O(m)` time.\n    *   In our algorithm, the number `x` (and `q`) gets smaller in each iteration. Its size in bits is initially `m = O(log n)`, then `O(log(n/c))`, `O(log(n/c²))`, and so on.\n    *   The cost of the `k`-th iteration would be `O(log(n/c^k)) = O(log(n) - k*log(c))`.\n    *   Summing the cost over all `k` iterations from 0 to `log_c(n)`:\n        Σ [from k=0 to log_c(n)] of `O(log(n) - k*log(c))`\n    *   This sum is an arithmetic series which evaluates to `O((log n)²)`. So, using a naive division algorithm, the complexity is `O((log n)²)`.\n    *   However, more advanced algorithms for large number division exist, which can reduce the complexity of division to `O(M(m))`, where `M(m)` is the time for `m`-bit multiplication. This can bring the total complexity for base conversion down.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the purpose of standard algorithm analysis, where machine-sized integers are assumed, the cost of arithmetic operations is considered constant. The dominant factor is the number of times the division loop runs.\n\nThe number of iterations is determined by how many times you can divide `n` by `c` until it becomes zero, which is the definition of `log_c(n)`.\n\nThus, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is proportional to the number of digits in the resulting base-`c` representation.\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
