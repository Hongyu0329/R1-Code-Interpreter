    "The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the curve $\\{(\\cos t, \\sin t, t): 0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is 4.\n\nThis curve is a helix, which is a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as it possesses non-vanishing curvature and torsion. The theory of $l^2$ decoupling, significantly advanced by the work of Bourgain and Demeter, provides sharp exponents for various manifolds.\n\nFor a broad class of surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, specifically those with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature, the sharp $l^2(L^p)$ decoupling inequality holds for the range of exponents $2 \\le p \\le 4$. While a curve is not a surface, its decoupling properties are closely related. The work by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth extended the decoupling theory to non-degenerate curves (curves with non-zero torsion), such as the helix.\n\nA key publication on decoupling for surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ establishes a sharp $(l^2,L^p)$ decoupling estimate for the range of exponents $2\\leq p\\leq 4$. A talk by Shaoming Guo at the \"International Workshop on Bourgain-Demeter Decoupling Method\" was titled \"A proof of decoupling inequalities for the helix inspired by efficient,\" which indicates that the decoupling properties of the helix are a subject of specific study within this field.\n\nWhile some contexts, particularly those related to Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem, discuss a critical exponent of $p_c = n(n+1)$, which would be 12 for $n=3$, the sharp exponent for the standard $l^2$ decoupling inequality in this setting is widely understood to be 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
