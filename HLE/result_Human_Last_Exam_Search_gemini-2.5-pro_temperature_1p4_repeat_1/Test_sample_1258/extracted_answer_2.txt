The analytical expression for the fluxmetric demagnetizing factor, denoted as N_f, for a magnetic cylinder with uniform susceptibility χ=0 and a length-to-diameter ratio g is given by:

N_f = 1 - (2g / (π * sqrt(g^2 + 4))) * (F(k) - E(k)) * (1 / (1 - k^2))

Where:
*   g is the length-to-diameter ratio (L/D).
*   F(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind with modulus k.
*   E(k) is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind with modulus k.
*   k^2 = g^2 / (g^2 + 4)
