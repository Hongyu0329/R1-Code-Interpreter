    "The next number in the sequence is 2358.\n\nThe provided sequence is: 1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352.\n\nAll numbers in this sequence are divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 (i.e., it is an even number) and 3 (i.e., the sum of its digits is divisible by 3). All numbers in the sequence are even, and the sum of the digits for each number is a multiple of 3.\n\nWhile the differences between consecutive numbers do not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression, the most straightforward continuation of the sequence would be the next number that maintains this primary characteristic.\n\nThe last number in the sequence is 2352. The next integer after 2352 that is divisible by 6 is 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
