**Achieved Doubling Rate (W):**
The achieved doubling rate based on your incorrect probability estimates is:
`W = (1/4)ln(3/2) + (1/4)ln(7/8)`
This can be simplified to:
`W = (1/4)ln( (3/2) * (7/8) ) = (1/4)ln(21/16)`

**Decrease in Doubling Rate (ΔW):**
The amount by which your doubling rate has decreased due to the poor estimate of probabilities is:
`ΔW = W* - W = (1/4)ln(2)`
