The smallest value of k for which a square can be cut into k connected pieces that can be reassembled in exactly five distinct (non-isomorphic) ways to form the original square is not a well-documented result in recreational mathematics or geometry. The problem of determining the number of ways a set of pieces can tile a shape is known to be computationally very difficult, often falling into the category of NP-hard problems.

My research into dissection puzzles and polyomino tilings has revealed the following:

*   Many dissection puzzles focus on finding the minimum number of pieces to transform one shape into another, or on creating puzzles with a single unique solution.
*   Problems involving tiling a region with a set of polyominoes can have a very large number of solutions, and counting them is a significant combinatorial challenge. For example, the 12 pentominoes can tile a 6x10 rectangle in 2,339 ways.
*   The study of how many ways a set of shapes can be assembled to form a larger shape is a complex area of mathematics. For some problems, like the 5-Polyomino tiling problem for the entire plane, it has been proven to be undecidable.

While it is theoretically possible that such a set of *k* pieces exists, finding the smallest such *k* and the corresponding shapes of the pieces would likely require a dedicated and complex mathematical or computational search that has not been published in easily accessible literature. There are no well-known puzzles or theorems that provide a direct answer to this specific question. Therefore, based on the available information, the smallest value of k remains an open question.
