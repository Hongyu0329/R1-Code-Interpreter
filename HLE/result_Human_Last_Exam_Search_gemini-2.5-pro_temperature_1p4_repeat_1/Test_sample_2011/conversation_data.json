    "The search results discuss \"maximal cliques,\" which is a more specific term. A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by adding another vertex. An induced clique, as per the question's wording (\"appear as induced subgraphs\"), is simply a subset of vertices that forms a complete subgraph. The relationship is that any induced clique is contained within some maximal clique. However, the question asks for the number of *different sizes* of induced cliques, not maximal ones.\n\nMy initial reasoning remains sound. A graph `G` has an induced subgraph isomorphic to a clique `K_k` if there exists a subset of `k` vertices in `G` where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nConsider the complete graph `K_n` on `n = 128` vertices. In this graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\nLet's check for induced cliques of various sizes:\n*   **Size k=1:** Any single vertex forms an induced clique of size 1.\n*   **Size k=2:** Any pair of vertices is connected by an edge, so any two vertices form an induced clique of size 2.\n*   **Size k:** For any integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= 128`, we can choose any subset of `k` vertices from the `K_128`. Since all vertices in the `K_128` are connected to each other, all vertices in this subset are also connected to each other. Therefore, the subgraph induced by this subset is a complete graph of size `k`, i.e., a `K_k`.\n\nThis demonstrates that in a `K_128` graph, we can find an induced clique for every possible size from 1 to 128. This gives us 128 different clique sizes.\n\nThe size of any clique in a graph with `n` vertices cannot be greater than `n`. Therefore, the maximum possible clique size in a graph with 128 vertices is 128. Consequently, it is impossible to have more than 128 different clique sizes.\n\nSince we have found a graph (`K_128`) that achieves this upper bound, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128. The search results, while interesting and related to more complex clique problems (like maximal cliques or the TurÃ¡n problem), do not contradict this fundamental conclusion.\n\nFinal check of the question's wording: \"Determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single such graph.\" My interpretation holds: we are counting the number of unique integers `k` for which an induced `K_k` exists in a single graph on 128 vertices. The complete graph `K_128` allows for all `k` from 1 to 128.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
