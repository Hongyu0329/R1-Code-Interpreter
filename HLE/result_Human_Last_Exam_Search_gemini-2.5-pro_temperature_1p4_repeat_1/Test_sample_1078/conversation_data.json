    "A finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections in a Euclidean space that preserves a crystallographic lattice. The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the Euclidean space on which it acts, which also corresponds to the number of nodes in its associated Dynkin diagram. The classification of finite Weyl groups is intrinsically linked to the classification of root systems.\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified into irreducible and reducible groups. The irreducible finite Weyl groups are associated with the simple Lie algebras and are denoted by the types A_n, B_n (or C_n), D_n, E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, and G_2. The rank of the group is given by the subscript 'n', except for the exceptional cases where the rank is the subscript number itself.\n\nFor a rank of 4, we can identify the following non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups:\n*   **A₄**: The Weyl group associated with the A₄ root system.\n*   **B₄**: The Weyl group associated with the B₄ root system. The Weyl groups for B_n and C_n are isomorphic.\n*   **D₄**: The Weyl group associated with the D₄ root system.\n*   **F₄**: The Weyl group associated with the F₄ root system, which is of rank 4.\n\nReducible Weyl groups are formed by the direct product of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the resulting group is the sum of the ranks of its components. To find the reducible Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to find all partitions of the number 4 into sums of ranks of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nThe possible partitions of 4 are:\n*   3 + 1\n*   2 + 2\n*   2 + 1 + 1\n*   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nThis leads to the following non-isomorphic reducible Weyl groups of rank 4:\n*   **A₃ × A₁**\n*   **A₂ × A₂**\n*   **A₂ × A₁ × A₁**\n*   **A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁**\n*   **B₂ × B₂**: The Weyl group of type B₂ is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8.\n*   **A₁ × B₂**\n*   **A₁ × A₁ × B₂**\n\nThere is also the possibility of combining different types, ensuring they are non-isomorphic. For example, B₂ is of rank 2, and A₁ is of rank 1.\n\nThe irreducible Weyl groups of lower ranks are:\n*   Rank 1: A₁ (isomorphic to B₁ and C₁)\n*   Rank 2: A₂, B₂ (isomorphic to C₂), G₂\n*   Rank 3: A₃, B₃ (isomorphic to C₃)\n\nThe possible combinations of non-isomorphic reducible Weyl groups of rank 4 are:\n*   **A₃ × A₁**\n*   **B₃ × A₁**\n*   **A₂ × A₂**\n*   **A₂ × B₂**\n*   **B₂ × B₂**\n*   **G₂ × A₂**\n*   **G₂ × B₂**\n*   **G₂ × G₂**\n*   **A₂ × A₁ × A₁**\n*   **B₂ × A₁ × A₁**\n*   **G₂ × A₁ × A₁**\n*   **A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁**\n\nSo, the complete list of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is:\n*   **Irreducible:** A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄\n*   **Reducible:**\n    *   A₃ × A₁\n    *   B₃ × A₁\n    *   A₂ × A₂\n    *   A₂ × B₂\n    *   B₂ × B₂\n    *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n\nNow, to check for isomorphisms between these, we note that the irreducible components determine the group's structure. Since A_n, B_n, and D_n types are generally non-isomorphic (with a few low-rank exceptions that are not relevant here), and F₄ and G₂ are exceptional, the listed groups are distinct.\n\nTherefore, we have 4 irreducible and 8 reducible non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, making a total of 12.\n\nFinal list:\n1.  A₄\n2.  B₄\n3.  D₄\n4.  F₄\n5.  A₃ × A₁\n6.  B₃ × A₁\n7.  A₂ × A₂\n8.  A₂ × B₂\n9.  B₂ × B₂\n10. A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n11. B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n12. A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n\n<<<12>>>"
