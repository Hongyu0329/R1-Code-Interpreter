In scalar field theoretical frameworks, for spatial dimensionalities, d, below the upper critical dimension of four, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, is related to the dimensionality through the hyperscaling relation 2 - α = dν. Utilizing the epsilon expansion, where ε = 4 - d, the correlation length exponent ν for an O(n)-symmetric model can be expressed as a power series in ε. To the first order in ε, the specific heat exponent α is given by:
α ≈ ( (4-n) / (2(n+8)) ) ε = ( (4-n) / (2(n+8)) ) (4-d).
To the second order in ε, the expression is:
α ≈ ( (4-n) / (2(n+8)) )ε + ( (n+2)(n(n+28)-236) / (8(n+8)³) )ε²
This shows that α is not a simple power law of *d* but is expressed as a series expansion in (4-*d*). For the Ising model (n=1), α is positive for d<4, indicating a divergent specific heat. For other models, such as the XY model (n=2) and the Heisenberg model (n=3), α is also typically positive below four dimensions. As d approaches 4 from below, α approaches 0.
