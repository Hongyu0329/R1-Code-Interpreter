    "The question asks whether there is always a strict equivalence between the constrained (budget `t`) and penalized (penalty `Œª`) formulations of LASSO regression.\n\n**1. Formulations:**\n*   **Constrained Form:** `argmin RSS(Œ≤)` subject to `‚àë|Œ≤‚±º| ‚â§ t`\n*   **Penalized Form:** `argmin RSS(Œ≤) + Œª ‚àë|Œ≤‚±º|`\n\nHere, `RSS(Œ≤)` is the Residual Sum of Squares, `‚àë·µ¢(y·µ¢ ‚Äî Œ± ‚Äî ‚àë‚±ºŒ≤‚±ºx·µ¢‚±º)¬≤`.\n\n**2. General Equivalence:**\nFrom the principles of convex optimization and Lagrangian duality, these two forms are generally equivalent. This means that for a solution found using one formulation with a specific tuning parameter (`t` or `Œª`), there exists a corresponding value of the other tuning parameter (`Œª` or `t`) that yields the exact same coefficient estimates. This equivalence relies on the fact that the LASSO objective function and the constraint are both convex.\n\n**3. \"Strict\" Equivalence and Continuity:**\nThe term \"strictly true\" implies a unique one-to-one correspondence between `t` and `Œª`. The solution path of the LASSO coefficients, `Œ≤ÃÇ(Œª)`, is a continuous and piecewise-linear function of `Œª`. This continuity is crucial because it ensures that as `Œª` varies, the solution `Œ≤ÃÇ` does not jump, and therefore the corresponding norm `t = ‚àë|Œ≤ÃÇ‚±º|` also changes continuously. This rules out options suggesting the path is discontinuous.\n\n**4. Conditions Where Strict Equivalence Fails:**\nThe strict one-to-one mapping between `t` and `Œª` can break down under certain conditions:\n\n*   **Non-uniqueness of Solutions:** When the number of predictors `p` is greater than the number of observations `n` (`p > n`), or when predictors are perfectly collinear, the LASSO objective function is not strictly convex. This can lead to multiple, different coefficient vectors `Œ≤ÃÇ` being optimal for the same value of `Œª`. If these different solutions have different L1 norms (`t = ‚àë|Œ≤ÃÇ‚±º|`), then one `Œª` value corresponds to multiple `t` values.\n*   **The Null Model:** For the constrained problem, when `t = 0`, the unique solution is `Œ≤ÃÇ = 0`. In the penalized formulation, the solution `Œ≤ÃÇ = 0` is obtained for all values of `Œª` greater than or equal to a certain threshold (`Œª_max`). Therefore, a single `t` value (`t=0`) corresponds to a range of `Œª` values (`Œª ‚â• Œª_max`), breaking the one-to-one mapping.\n*   **The OLS Solution:** Similarly, when `Œª = 0`, the solution is the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate, `Œ≤ÃÇ_OLS`. In the constrained formulation, this same solution is obtained for all `t ‚â• ‚àë|Œ≤ÃÇ_OLS‚±º|`, because increasing the budget beyond what the unconstrained solution requires has no further effect.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Answer Choices:**\nSince there are conditions under which the strict one-to-one correspondence fails, the statement \"it is **always strictly true**\" is **false**. We need to find the option that correctly states this and provides the best reasoning.\n\n*   Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they claim the LASSO solution path is not continuous, which is false.\n*   Choices B and I have flawed reasoning. Continuity of the path does not imply what they claim.\n*   Choices F, G, and J are incorrect. The statement is not strictly true.\n*   Choice E, \"False in general, but often true in practice,\" is poorly worded. The equivalence is true in general; it is the *strictness* that is not.\n*   Choice K, \"True in general, but not always strictly true,\" accurately describes the relationship, but is not a direct answer to the yes/no question posed.\n\nThis leaves Choice H: **\"False under certain conditions, because the continuity of the solution path means that as Œª is incremented from 0, the sum of the absolute values of coefficients may not always change continuously, at some points in the path\"**.\n\nLet's analyze this option:\n*   The claim **\"False under certain conditions\"** is the correct logical negation of \"always strictly true.\"\n*   The reasoning provided is poorly phrased. The sum of the absolute values (`t(Œª)`) *is* a continuous function of `Œª`. However, it may not be *strictly monotonic*. There can be intervals of `Œª` where `t(Œª)` is constant (i.e., it doesn't \"change\"), such as when the solution is `Œ≤=0`. It's possible that \"not always change continuously\" is a confusing way to express that the function can have flat regions, which is a key reason for the failure of strict equivalence. Despite the confusing wording of the rationale, the main claim of the option is the most accurate among the choices.\n\nGiven the available options, H is the most plausible answer because its primary assertion (\"False under certain conditions\") is correct, even if its explanation is flawed.\n\n<<<H>>>"
