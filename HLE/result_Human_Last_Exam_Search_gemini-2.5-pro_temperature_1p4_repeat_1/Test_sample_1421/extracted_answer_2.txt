The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] e⁻ˢᵉ[ψ̄,ψ], where the integral is over Grassmann-valued fermionic fields ψ and ψ̄ subject to anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction (ψ(τ) = -ψ(τ + β)), and S_E is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system.
