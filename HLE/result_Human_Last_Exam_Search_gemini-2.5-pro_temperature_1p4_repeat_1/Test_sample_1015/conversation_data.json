    "A key distinction between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods in the execution of a cambré derrière (a backbend, often incorporated into an arabesque) lies in the placement of the hips.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a squared torso and hips. The goal is to keep the shoulders and hips aligned with each other, even as the dancer bends backward, which requires significant back flexibility and core strength. This method prioritizes precise body alignment and control.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method allows and encourages the hip of the working leg to lift and open towards the audience. This departure from a strictly squared position is intended to create a longer, more extended visual line and allows for greater height in the leg's extension. In the Balanchine style, the hip is often considered an extension of the leg, altering the body's square to achieve a particular aesthetic. This technique is characteristic of the Balanchine style's focus on speed, length, and dynamic shapes.\n\nWhile other general differences exist between the two methods, such as arm styling (port de bras), musicality, and speed of movement, the deliberate opening of the hip in Balanchine versus the strict maintenance of a square torso in Vaganova is a primary technical distinction in a cambré derrière or arabesque.\n\n<<<B>>>"
