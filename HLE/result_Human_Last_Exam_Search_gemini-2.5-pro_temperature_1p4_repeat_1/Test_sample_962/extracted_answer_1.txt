A detailed guide on how to design a t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme that is both tightly secure and features a two-round signing protocol. Key steps include choosing a foundational cryptographic assumption (like DLP or LWE) and a secret sharing method, using a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol to create key shares without a trusted dealer, and structuring the signing process into two efficient rounds: a message-independent commitment round and a partial signature generation round. Achieving tight security requires a rigorous proof in a strong security model (like EUF-CMA) that closely ties the scheme's security to the hardness of the underlying mathematical problem, often by leveraging specific algebraic properties and avoiding proof techniques that introduce security loss.
