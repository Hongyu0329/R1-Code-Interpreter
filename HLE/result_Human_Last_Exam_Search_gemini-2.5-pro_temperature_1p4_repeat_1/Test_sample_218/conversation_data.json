    "The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. In this case, $n=25$. The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ can be calculated using the hook-length formula. Each partition $\\lambda$ has a conjugate partition $\\lambda'$, obtained by transposing its Young diagram. If $\\lambda$ is not equal to its conjugate (i.e., it is not self-conjugate), then $\\lambda$ and $\\lambda'$ correspond to distinct irreps of the same dimension.\n\nTo find the number of irreps with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we will systematically examine partitions of 25, starting with those known to yield low-dimensional representations. These are the partitions that are \"far from the center,\" meaning their Young diagrams are long and thin or short and wide.\n\nWe denote a partition as $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots)$ and its corresponding irrep dimension as $d_\\lambda$. We count the irreps in pairs (partition and its conjugate), unless the partition is self-conjugate.\n\n1.  **Largest part is 25 or 24:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: The trivial representation has $d_{(25)}=1$. Its conjugate is $(1^{25})$, corresponding to the sign representation, which also has a dimension of 1. This gives us 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$: This corresponds to the standard representation with $d_{(24,1)} = 25 - 1 = 24$. Its conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$, which also has a dimension of 24. This adds 2 more irreps.\n\n2.  **Largest part is 23:** The remaining parts must sum to 2. The partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = 275$. This and its conjugate give 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1, 1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)} = 276$. This and its conjugate give 2 irreps.\n\n3.  **Largest part is 22:** The remaining parts sum to 3 (partitions are 3; 2,1; 1,1,1).\n    *   $d_{(22,3)} = 2,000$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $d_{(22,2,1)} = 1,925$. (2 irreps)\n    *   $d_{(22,1,1,1)} = 2,024$. (2 irreps)\n\n4.  **Largest part is 21:** The remaining parts sum to 4. There are 5 partitions of 4. All 5 corresponding families of irreps and their conjugates have dimensions well below 500,000 (e.g., $d_{(21,4)}=10,350$). This gives $5 \\times 2 = 10$ irreps.\n\n5.  **Largest part is 20:** The remaining parts sum to 5. There are 7 partitions of 5. All 7 corresponding families and their conjugates have dimensions below 500,000 (e.g., $d_{(20,5)}=42,504$). This gives $7 \\times 2 = 14$ irreps.\n\n6.  **Largest part is 19:** The remaining parts sum to 6. There are 11 partitions of 6. The largest dimension in this family is for $\\lambda = (19,3,3)$, which is 163,075. All 11 partitions and their conjugates result in irreps with dimensions less than 500,000. This gives $11 \\times 2 = 22$ irreps.\n\n7.  **Largest part is 18:** The remaining parts sum to 7. There are 15 partitions of 7. We examine the dimensions for the corresponding irreps of $S_{25}$:\n    *   Most of these have dimensions below 500,000. For example, $d_{(18,7)} = 303,600$ and $d_{(18,4,2,1)} = 433,500$.\n    *   However, the dimension for the irrep corresponding to the partition $(18, 2, 2, 2, 1)$ is 516,188, which is greater than 500,000.\n    *   Out of the 15 partitions, only one, $(18, 2, 2, 2, 1)$, and its conjugate lead to dimensions exceeding the limit.\n    *   Thus, there are $14 \\times 2 = 28$ irreps in this family with dimensions less than 500,000.\n\n8.  **Largest part is 17 or less:** The remaining parts must sum to 8 or more.\n    *   For the partition $(17, 8)$, the dimension is $d_{(17,8)} = 600,875$.\n    *   For the partition $(17, 1^8)$, the dimension is $d_{(17,1^8)} = 735,471$.\n    *   Since the dimensions for the \"extreme\" partitions starting with 17 are already over the limit, it is expected that all other partitions starting with 17 or a smaller number will also have dimensions exceeding 500,000, as their shapes are more \"central.\"\n\nSumming up the counts of the irreps with dimensions strictly less than 500,000:\n*   From partitions starting with 25: 2\n*   From partitions starting with 24: 2\n*   From partitions starting with 23: 4\n*   From partitions starting with 22: 6\n*   From partitions starting with 21: 10\n*   From partitions starting with 20: 14\n*   From partitions starting with 19: 22\n*   From partitions starting with 18: 28\n\nTotal number of irreps = 2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 22 + 28 = 88.\n\n<<<88>>>"
