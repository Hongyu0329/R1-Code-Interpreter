    "For the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, the concepts of a $\\tau$-tilting module and a tilting module coincide because the algebra is hereditary. A tilting module $T$ is called a slice module if the global dimension of its endomorphism algebra, $\\text{End}_A(T)$, is at most 2. For hereditary algebras, this is equivalent to the endomorphism algebra also being hereditary (having global dimension at most 1).\n\nThe indecomposable modules for this algebra are:\n*   $P_1 = (1,1,1)$ (projective-injective)\n*   $P_2 = (0,1,1)$ (projective)\n*   $P_3 = S_3 = (0,0,1)$ (simple projective)\n*   $I_1 = S_1 = (1,0,0)$ (simple injective)\n*   $I_2 = (1,1,0)$ (injective)\n*   $S_2 = (0,1,0)$ (simple)\n\nA module is a tilting module if it is a direct sum of 3 indecomposable modules, say $T = M_1 \\oplus M_2 \\oplus M_3$, such that $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T) = 0$.\n\nLet's examine the module $T = P_1 \\oplus P_3 \\oplus S_2$.\n*   $P_1$ is the indecomposable projective module at vertex 1.\n*   $P_3$ is the simple projective module at vertex 3.\n*   $S_2$ is the simple module at vertex 2.\n\nWe can check if this module is a tilting module by calculating the extension groups between its summands. A key calculation is $\\text{Ext}^1_A(S_2, P_3)$. Using the short exact sequence that defines $S_2$:\n$0 \\to P_3 \\to P_2 \\to S_2 \\to 0$\nApplying the functor $\\text{Hom}_A(-, P_3)$ gives a long exact sequence:\n$\\text{Hom}_A(P_2, P_3) \\to \\text{Hom}_A(P_3, P_3) \\to \\text{Ext}^1_A(S_2, P_3) \\to \\text{Ext}^1_A(P_2, P_3) \\to \\dots$\nSince there is no non-zero map from $P_2$ to $P_3$, $\\text{Hom}_A(P_2, P_3) = 0$. We have $\\text{Hom}_A(P_3, P_3) \\cong \\mathbb{C}$, and since $P_2$ is projective, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(P_2, P_3) = 0$. The sequence thus shows that $\\text{Ext}^1_A(S_2, P_3) \\cong \\mathbb{C}$.\n\nSince $\\text{Ext}^1_A(S_2, P_3) \\neq 0$, the module $T = P_1 \\oplus P_3 \\oplus S_2$ is **not** a tilting module. The equivalence between tilting and $\\tau$-tilting for hereditary algebras means it is also **not** a $\\tau$-tilting module.\n\nThere appears to be a misunderstanding in the premise of common interpretations of this problem. For the path algebra of type $A_3$, all $\\tau$-tilting modules are tilting modules, and it turns out all of its tilting modules are also slice modules. There isn't a $\\tau$-tilting module that fails to be a slice module.\n\nHowever, if we consider a slightly different question—identifying a tilting module whose endomorphism algebra has a global dimension greater than 1 (but still finite), making it a non-hereditary tilted algebra—a unique candidate emerges. This module is often contrasted with \"slice modules\" whose endomorphism algebras are hereditary. The module in question is $T = S_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_1$. While its endomorphism algebra is not hereditary, it does have a finite global dimension (equal to 2), thus qualifying it as a slice module under the broader definition.\n\nGiven the common sources of confusion around this specific problem, it is most likely that a misunderstanding of the definitions of tilting or slice modules is expected. Under the strict definitions applicable to hereditary algebras, no such module as described in the question exists.\n\n<<<There is no such module. All $\\tau$-tilting modules for this algebra are tilting modules, and all tilting modules are slice modules.>>>"
