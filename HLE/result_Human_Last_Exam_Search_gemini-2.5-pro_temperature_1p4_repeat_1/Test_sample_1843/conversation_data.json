    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factor the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### 2. Decompose the Character\nA primitive Dirichlet character $\\chi$ of conductor $N$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive characters whose conductors are the prime power components of $N$. In this case:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere each $\\chi_q$ is a primitive Dirichlet character with conductor $q$.\n\n### 3. Use the Order Property\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its component characters. Let $k_q$ be the order of $\\chi_q$. We require the order of $\\chi$ to be 6:\n$\\text{lcm}(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13}) = 6$.\n\nFor the LCM to be 6, the following conditions must be met:\n*   Each individual order $k_q$ must be a divisor of 6.\n*   The set of orders $\\{k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13}\\}$ must contain an order that is divisible by 2.\n*   The set of orders must contain an order that is divisible by 3.\n\n### 4. Count the Primitive Characters for Each Conductor\nWe need to determine the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor, restricting to those whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=4$ ($=2^2$):** The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this character is a valid choice.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (with order $k_4=2$).\n\n*   **Conductor $q=9$ ($=3^2$):** The primitive characters modulo 9 are those that are not induced from characters modulo 3. The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The orders of primitive characters are 3 and 6, both of which divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_9$: $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=7$:** The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The primitive characters are all non-principal characters, with orders 2, 3, and 6. All these orders divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_7$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=11$:** The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The primitive characters have orders 2, 5, and 10. The only order that divides 6 is 2.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1 (with order $k_{11}=2$).\n\n*   **Conductor $q=13$:** The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The primitive characters have orders 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The orders that divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### 5. Combine the Results\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component. Let's verify that the LCM of the orders is exactly 6 for all combinations.\n\nThe order of the resulting character $\\chi$ is $k = \\text{lcm}(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13})$.\n*   The choice for $\\chi_4$ ensures $k_4=2$, so the LCM will always be divisible by 2.\n*   The choices for $\\chi_9$ ensure $k_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$, so the order is always divisible by 3.\n\nSince the LCM is always divisible by both 2 and 3, it is always divisible by 6. As all individual orders $k_q$ are divisors of 6, their LCM cannot exceed 6. Therefore, the order of any combination will be exactly 6.\n\nThe total number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component character:\nNumber of characters = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
