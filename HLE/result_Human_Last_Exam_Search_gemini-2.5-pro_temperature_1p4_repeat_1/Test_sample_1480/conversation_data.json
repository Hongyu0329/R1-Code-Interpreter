    "In a fuzzy logic system, the rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedent and the membership degree of the consequent. The firing strength of the antecedent, given as Φ_k(x′), represents the degree to which the \"IF\" part of a rule is satisfied. The membership degree of the consequent, μG_k_j(y_j), represents the membership value of the \"THEN\" part of the rule.\n\nGiven:\n*   Firing strength of the antecedent, Φ_k(x′) = 0.7\n*   Membership degree of the consequent, μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9\n\nThe final activation of the rule is calculated by combining these two values using a t-norm operation. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. The two most commonly used t-norms are the minimum (min) and the product (prod).\n\n1.  **Using the Minimum t-norm:** The rule activation level is the minimum of the two values.\n    Activation Level = min(Φ_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j)) = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n2.  **Using the Product t-norm:** The rule activation level is the product of the two values.\n    Activation Level = Φ_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nWithout a specific t-norm being mentioned in the query, the activation level could be either of these values, as both are standard practices in fuzzy logic. However, the minimum t-norm is a very common choice for implication in Mamdani fuzzy systems.\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level of the interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm operation is **0.63** if the product t-norm is used, or **0.7** if the minimum t-norm is used.\n\n<<<0.63 (using product t-norm) or 0.7 (using minimum t-norm)>>>"
