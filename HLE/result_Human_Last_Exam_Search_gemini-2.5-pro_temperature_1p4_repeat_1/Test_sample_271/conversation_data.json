    "Let $K$ be the splitting field of the polynomial $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The possible degrees of normal field extensions $L / \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ are the indices of the proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nFirst, we determine the Galois group $G$. The polynomial $p(x)$ can be factored as:\n$p(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$.\n\nLet $f(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $g(x) = x^2 - 2$. Let $K_f$ and $K_g$ be their respective splitting fields over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The splitting field of $p(x)$ is the compositum of these two fields, $K = K_f K_g$.\n\nThe polynomial $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ has roots $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$, and its splitting field is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group of $K_g/\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe polynomial $f(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The derivative is $f'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$, which has two real roots, $x = \\pm\\sqrt{9/5}$. Since $f(x)$ has exactly two critical points, it has at most three real roots. Evaluating the polynomial at various points confirms it has three real roots. An irreducible quintic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly three real roots has the symmetric group $S_5$ as its Galois group. Thus, $\\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\nThe intersection of the two splitting fields, $K_f \\cap K_g$, must be a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ contained in $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The only possibilities are $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $K_g \\subset K_f$, then $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ would be a subfield of $K_f$. The only quadratic subfield of $K_f$ is determined by the square root of the discriminant of $f(x)$. The discriminant is $D = 2^8(-9)^5 + 5^5(3)^4 = -14,863,419$. Thus, the quadratic subfield of $K_f$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14,863,419})$, which is not $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Therefore, $K_f \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince the intersection of the two Galois extensions is trivial, the Galois group of their compositum is the direct product of their individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe degrees of the normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ are the indices of the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G \\cong S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $H_1 = S_5$ and $H_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The normal subgroups of $H_1$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$. The normal subgroups of $H_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of the direct product $G = H_1 \\times H_2$ can be determined. We list the proper, non-trivial ones and their indices:\n1.  **Product Normal Subgroups**:\n    *   $A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: This is a normal subgroup of order 60. The index is $|G| / |A_5 \\times \\{e\\}| = (120 \\times 2) / 60 = 4$.\n    *   $S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: This is a normal subgroup of order 120. The index is $|G| / |S_5 \\times \\{e\\}| = (120 \\times 2) / 120 = 2$.\n    *   $\\{e\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: This is a normal subgroup of order 2. The index is $|G| / |\\{e\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}| = (120 \\times 2) / 2 = 120$.\n    *   $A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: This is a normal subgroup of order $60 \\times 2 = 120$. The index is $|G| / |A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}| = (120 \\times 2) / 120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **Diagonal Normal Subgroup**:\n    Since $H_1/A_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_2/\\{e\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, there exists a \"diagonal\" normal subgroup. This subgroup is $N = \\{(h, g) \\in S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\mid \\text{sgn}(h) = g\\}$, where we identify $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ with the group $\\{1, -1\\}$. This subgroup consists of pairs of even permutations with the identity in $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, and odd permutations with the non-identity element. The order of this subgroup is $|A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$. The index of this normal subgroup is $|G|/|N| = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe possible indices for proper, non-trivial normal subgroups are 2, 4, and 120. These are the possible degrees for the normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThus, the list of possible degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
