    "To compute the determinant of the given matrix A, we can use the standard formula for a 3x3 matrix.\n\nThe matrix is:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na & b & c \\\\\nd & e & f \\\\\ng & h & i\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis given by the formula:  `a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n\nSubstituting the values from matrix A:\n`det(A) = 2(2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1)((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1)((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))`\n`det(A) = 2(4 - 1) + 1(-2 - 1) - 1(1 + 2)`\n`det(A) = 2(3) - 3 - 3`\n`det(A) = 6 - 6`\n`det(A) = 0`\n\nAlternatively, we can observe that the sum of the entries in each row is zero:\n*   Row 1: 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\n*   Row 2: -1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\n*   Row 3: -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\n\nA property of determinants is that if the sum of the rows (or columns) of a matrix is the zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent, and thus the determinant of the matrix is 0.\n\nThe term \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" refers to a specific context in the theory of cluster algebras and quiver representations, where the given matrix A is indeed the adjacency matrix. However, this information does not alter the matrix itself for the purpose of this calculation.\n\nThe determinant of the adjacency matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
