    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed where the ligand bridges two ruthenium centers. This reaction results in the formation of two diastereoisomers.\n\nThe ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, possesses two bidentate chelating sites, each composed of a pyridine ring and a thiazole ring. The starting ruthenium complex, *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), is a well-known precursor in ruthenium chemistry where the two chloride ligands are labile and can be substituted by other ligands.\n\nThe reaction of two equivalents of *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) with one equivalent of 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole leads to the substitution of the chloride ligands and the formation of a dinuclear ruthenium complex. In this complex, the thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-based ligand bridges two {Ru(bpy)₂} units.\n\nDue to the chirality at the two octahedral ruthenium centers, two diastereomers of the dinuclear complex are formed:\n*   A *meso* form, which has opposite chiralities at the two metal centers (Δ/Λ) and possesses a center of inversion.\n*   A *rac* form, which consists of a pair of enantiomers with the same chirality at both metal centers (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ) and contains a two-fold rotation axis.\n\nTherefore, two isomers are formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<2>>>"
