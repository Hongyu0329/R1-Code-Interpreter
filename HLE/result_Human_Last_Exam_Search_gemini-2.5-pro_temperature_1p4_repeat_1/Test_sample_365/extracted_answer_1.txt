The product is a bicyclo[5.3.1]undecenone derivative, formed via a tandem deprotonation and anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement, followed by tautomerization. The alcohol group is converted into a ketone, and the original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ring system is rearranged into a larger bicyclo[5.3.1]undecene skeleton.
