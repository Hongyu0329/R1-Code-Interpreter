    "### Assemblé: A Ballet Step of Unity\n\nAmong the given classical ballet steps, **assemblé** is the one where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\nAn assemblé, which translates to \"assembled\" or \"joined together,\" begins with the dancer standing in fifth position. In the execution of a basic assemblé, one leg brushes out to the side, after which the dancer jumps off the supporting leg. While in the air, the legs are brought together—or \"assembled\"—before the dancer lands simultaneously on both feet, returning to the original fifth position.\n\nWhile there are variations of the assemblé that involve traveling or changing which foot is in front, the fundamental version of the step, particularly when performed \"sur place\" (on the spot), begins and ends in the identical fifth position.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the other steps and their starting and ending positions:\n\n*   **Entrechat six:** This is a jump from fifth position where the legs cross six times in the air (three crossings for each leg). The dancer lands back in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front of where it started.\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** The term \"échappé\" implies an escaping movement, typically from a closed position like fifth to an open one like second. \"Battu\" indicates a beat, and \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed.\" Therefore, the feet will have changed their starting position upon completion of the step.\n*   **Glissade derrière:** A \"glissade\" is a gliding step. In a glissade derrière, the dancer starts with one foot in the back in fifth or third position and ends with the same foot in the back. While the configuration of the feet is the same, the glissade is a traveling step, meaning the dancer's location on the floor changes.\n*   **Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished jump similar to a pas de chat. It starts in fifth position and also ends in fifth position, but typically after the intricate legwork of a rond de jambe with each leg, the dancer lands with the opposite foot in front.\n\nTherefore, the assemblé is the most accurate answer as it can be performed without traveling, allowing the dancer to begin and end in the exact same position.\n\n<<<C>>>"
