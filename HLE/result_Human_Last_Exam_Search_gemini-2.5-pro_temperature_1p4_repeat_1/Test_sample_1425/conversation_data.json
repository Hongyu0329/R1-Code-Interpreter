    "The grand canonical partition function, Z, for a system is generally given by:\n\nZ = Tr(e^(-β(H^ - μN^)))\n\nwhere:\n*   Tr is the trace over all states of the system.\n*   β = 1/(k_B T), where T is the temperature and k_B is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   H^ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   μ is the chemical potential.\n*   N^ is the particle number operator.\n\nIn this specific case, the Hamiltonian is given as H^ = -μN^. Substituting this into the general formula for the grand canonical operator gives:\n\nH^ - μN^ = (-μN^) - μN^ = -2μN^\n\nTherefore, the partition function is:\n\nZ = Tr(e^(2βμN^))\n\nTo express this using path integrals, we typically work with fields (e.g., a complex scalar field φ for bosons). The trace is replaced by a functional integral over all possible field configurations that are periodic in imaginary time τ from 0 to β.\n\nThe partition function Z can be written as:\n\nZ = ∫D[φ*, φ] e^(-S_E)\n\nwhere D[φ*, φ] is the functional measure over all periodic field configurations (φ(x, β) = φ(x, 0)), and S_E is the Euclidean action.\n\nThe general form of the Euclidean action in the grand canonical ensemble is:\n\nS_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫d³x  L_E\n\nwhere L_E is the Euclidean Lagrangian density corresponding to the operator H^ - μN^. For a field theory, this is typically of the form:\n\nL_E = φ*(∂τ + H^ - μ)φ\n\nIn this problem, the operator H^ - μ is substituted by -2μ. The particle number operator N^ in the context of a field theory is given by ∫d³x φ*(x)φ(x). Therefore, the term -2μN^ in the action corresponds to -2μ ∫d³x φ*(x)φ(x).\n\nThe Euclidean action for this specific system, which lacks a kinetic term in the Hamiltonian, is:\n\nS_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫d³x [φ*(x, τ)∂τφ(x, τ) - 2μφ*(x, τ)φ(x, τ)]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nS_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫d³x φ*(x, τ)(∂τ - 2μ)φ(x, τ)\n\nThus, the partition function Z for the system with the Hamiltonian H^ = -μN^ in the grand canonical ensemble, expressed as a path integral, is:\n\n<<<Z = ∫D[φ*, φ] exp{ -∫₀^β dτ ∫d³x φ*(x, τ) [∂_τ - 2μ] φ(x, τ) }>>>"
