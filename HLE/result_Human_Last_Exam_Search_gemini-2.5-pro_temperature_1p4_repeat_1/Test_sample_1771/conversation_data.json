    "The Proto-Indo-European verb **\\*seh₂gieti**, meaning \"'(s)he's giving a sign',\" develops into the Proto-Germanic verb ***sōkijaną**, which means \"to seek\". The semantic shift from \"giving a sign\" is linked to the related Latin verb *sāgīre*, which means \"to perceive keenly\" or \"to track\".\n\nFrom Proto-Germanic ***sōkijaną**, the verb evolved into the following forms in the specified daughter languages:\n\n*   In **Proto-Germanic**, the reconstructed infinitive form of the verb is ***sōkijaną**. This form is the ancestor of the verb \"to seek\" in Germanic languages.\n\n*   In **Old Norse**, the verb became ***sǿkja***. This change reflects the i-umlaut, a process where the vowel *ō* in the root was fronted to *ǿ* under the influence of the following *j*.\n\n*   In **Old English**, the form was ***sēċan***. The Proto-Germanic *ō* vowel became *ē*, and the velar consonant *k* was palatalized to *ċ* (pronounced /tʃ/) before the front vowel element represented by *j*.\n\n*   In **Old High German**, the verb is attested as ***suohhen***. This form shows two characteristic Old High German sound changes: the Proto-Germanic vowel *ō* became the diphthong *uo*, and the consonant *k* underwent the High German Consonant Shift to become the fricative *hh*.\n\n<<<The Proto-Indo-European verb *seh₂gieti develops as follows:\n*   **Proto-Germanic**: *sōkijaną*\n*   **Old Norse**: *sǿkja*\n*   **Old English**: *sēċan*\n*   **Old High German**: *suohhen*>>>"
