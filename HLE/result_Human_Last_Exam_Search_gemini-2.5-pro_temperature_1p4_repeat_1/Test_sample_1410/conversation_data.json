    "Analysis of the chess position given by the FEN `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20` reveals a forced checkmate sequence for White. Assuming optimal play from both sides, White can win in 3 moves.\n\nThe winning sequence begins with White's most powerful attacking move:\n\n1.  **Qxf7+**\n\nBlack's only legal move is to move the king:\n\n1.  ... **Kh7**\n\nWhite continues the attack by eliminating the immediate threat from the black rook on e1 and preparing for the final blow:\n\n2.  **Rxe1**\n\nAt this point, regardless of Black's response, White can deliver checkmate on the next move. The most common continuation would be:\n\n2.  ... **Rxe1+**\n3.  **Bg6#** (Checkmate)\n\nAlternatively, if Black tries a different second move, the outcome is the same:\n\n2.  ... **Qe3+**\n3.  **Kh2** and Black cannot prevent the impending mate.\n\nTherefore, with optimal play, White can force a win in 3 moves.\n\n<<<3>>>"
