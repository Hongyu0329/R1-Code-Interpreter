An optimal single-site catalyst for both polyolefin hydrogenolysis and olefin polymerization consists of a zirconium or hafnium metal center, derived from a simple organometallic precursor such as tetrakis(neopentyl)zirconium or Cp*ZrMe3, supported on highly acidic sulfated alumina (AlS). Zirconium is particularly effective for hydrogenolysis, while hafnium offers excellent thermal stability and polymerization activity. The sulfated alumina support is critical as it generates the highly electrophilic cationic active sites required for both breaking and forming the C-C bonds in the polymer chains. This dual function is achievable because the underlying chemical steps for polymerization (olefin insertion) and degradation (Î²-alkyl elimination followed by hydrogenolysis) are mechanistically related and can be selectively promoted by adjusting the reaction conditions, specifically the presence or absence of olefin monomer and high-pressure hydrogen.
