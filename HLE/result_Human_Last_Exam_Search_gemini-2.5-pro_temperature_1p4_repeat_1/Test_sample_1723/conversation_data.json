    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While several species of mushrooms are blue in color, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nSome well-known blue-colored mushrooms and their actual spore print colors include:\n\n*   **Indigo Milk Cap (*Lactarius indigo*)**: This mushroom is a striking indigo blue but produces a yellowish-cream spore print. When cut, it exudes a blue \"milk\" that turns green on exposure to air.\n*   **Sky-Blue Mushroom (*Entoloma hochstetteri*)**: Native to New Zealand, this vibrant blue mushroom has a reddish-pink or purplish to deep red-brown spore print. Its gills have a slight reddish tint due to the spore color.\n*   **Blue Roundhead (*Stropharia caerulea*)**: This blue-green mushroom has a purple-black or purple-brown spore print.\n*   **Blue Oyster (*Pleurotus columbinus*)**: While the mushroom itself can be blue, oyster mushrooms typically have a whitish to lilac-gray spore print, not a distinct blue.\n*   **Blue-staining species**: Other mushrooms, such as those in the genera *Panaeolus* and *Psilocybe*, can bruise blue but do not have blue spores. For instance, *Panaeolus cyanescens* has a black spore print, and *Psilocybe cyanescens* has a purple-brown to purple-black spore print.\n\nThe coloration of a mushroom's cap or flesh does not determine the color of its spores. Therefore, despite the existence of several blue-hued mushroom species, none are known to have a blue spore print.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
