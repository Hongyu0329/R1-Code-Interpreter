    "To date, 10 members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans.\n\nThe let-7 family of microRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that play crucial roles in regulating gene expression. In humans, this family consists of 10 distinct mature microRNAs. These are:\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   miR-98\n*   miR-202\n\nThese 10 mature miRNAs are produced from 12 or 13 different precursor genes located at various sites in the human genome. For instance, the mature let-7a sequence is generated from three separate genomic loci (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3). The let-7 family is highly conserved across many species and was one of the first families of microRNAs to be discovered. Its members are known to function as tumor suppressors by regulating genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation.\n\n<<<10>>>"
