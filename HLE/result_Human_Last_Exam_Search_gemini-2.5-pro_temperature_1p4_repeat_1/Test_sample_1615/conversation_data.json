    "The problem asks for the maximum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, with the condition that $G$ is not a complete graph. This number is the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for such a graph.\n\nFirst, let's establish an upper bound for the chromatic number. The chromatic number of a graph with $n$ vertices is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. A graph's chromatic number can be at most the number of its vertices, $n$. The only graph that requires $n$ colors is the complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Since every pair of vertices is adjacent, each vertex must be assigned a unique color.\n\nThe problem specifies that the graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices and is not the complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$). Because $\\chi(G)=n$ if and only if $G=K_n$, any graph that is not complete must have a chromatic number strictly less than $n$. As the chromatic number must be an integer, the maximum possible value is $n-1$. For this problem, this means $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nNext, we must determine if this upper bound of $12344$ colors is achievable. To do this, we need to show that there exists a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\nConsider a graph, $G$, constructed as the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices ($K_{12344}$) and a single isolated vertex ($K_1$).\n*   **Number of vertices:** The total number of vertices in $G$ is $12344 + 1 = 12345$.\n*   **Completeness:** $G$ is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex in the graph.\n*   **Chromatic Number:** The chromatic number of a disjoint union of graphs is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components. The chromatic number of $K_{12344}$ is 12344, and the chromatic number of an isolated vertex $K_1$ is 1. Therefore, $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nSince we have demonstrated that no such graph can have a chromatic number greater than 12344, and we have constructed a graph that achieves this chromatic number, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\nThe mention of the maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$, does not alter this conclusion. Brooks' Theorem states that for a connected graph, the chromatic number is at most the maximum degree, unless the graph is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In the example graph $G = K_{12344} + K_1$, the maximum degree is 12343 (the degree of any vertex in the $K_{12344}$ component). For this graph, the chromatic number is $12344$, which is $\\Delta(G)+1$. This is consistent with Brooks' Theorem as the theorem applies to connected graphs, and our constructed graph is not connected. If we were to consider connected non-complete graphs, one such example is taking $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge, which results in a graph with a chromatic number of 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
