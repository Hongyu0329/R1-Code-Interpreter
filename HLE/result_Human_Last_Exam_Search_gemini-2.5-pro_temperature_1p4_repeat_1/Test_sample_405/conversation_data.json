    "Pure phosphorus can be observed in four main colors corresponding to its different allotropes.\n\nThe primary, distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are:\n\n*   **White:** White phosphorus is a waxy, translucent solid. It can appear yellowish due to impurities or upon exposure to light, and is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus in this state.\n*   **Red:** This allotrope is a powder that is typically deep red or reddish-violet in color.\n*   **Violet:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this crystalline form is violet or purple.\n*   **Black:** Black phosphorus is the most stable form of the element and has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite.\n\nWhile other forms like blue phosphorus have been the subject of research, they are not as commonly produced and observed as the four main allotropes. Scarlet phosphorus is also mentioned as an allotropic form, but it is less common. Therefore, based on the well-established and observable pure allotropes, there are four distinct colors.\n\n<<<4>>>"
