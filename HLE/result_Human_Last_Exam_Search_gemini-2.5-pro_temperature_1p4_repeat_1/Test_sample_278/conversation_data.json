    "The problem asks for the area of the smallest square that can outcircle a figure defined by a piecewise parametric curve.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the curve in two parts:\n\n**Part 1: t ∈ [0, π]**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$. This represents the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(0) = 1$.\n*   The y-values range from $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ (maximum) down to $\\sin(0) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\n\n**Part 2: t ∈ (π, 2π)**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$. This represents the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(t)$ for $t$ in $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, which covers the interval from -1 to 1.\n*   The y-values range from $5\\sin(t)$ for $t$ in $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$. The sine function goes from 0 to -1 and back to 0. Therefore, $5\\sin(t)$ ranges from 0 down to $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ and back up to 0.\n\n**Combining the parts to determine the figure's dimensions:**\n\n*   **Width (x-range):** The total range for x-coordinates is determined by $\\cos t$ over the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$, which is from -1 to 1. The total width of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values: $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Height (y-range):** The maximum y-value comes from the semi-circle part, which is 1. The minimum y-value comes from the semi-ellipse part, which is -5. The total height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values: $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Finding the smallest circumscribing square:**\n\nTo outcircle this shape, which has a width of 2 and a height of 6, a square must have a side length equal to or greater than the larger of these two dimensions. The side length of the smallest possible square will be the maximum of the width and the height.\n\nSide length = max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6.\n\n**Calculating the area:**\n\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\n\nArea = (side length)² = 6² = 36.\n\n<<<36>>>The problem asks for the area of the smallest square that can outcircle a figure defined by a piecewise parametric curve.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the curve in two parts:\n\n**Part 1: t ∈ [0, π]**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.
