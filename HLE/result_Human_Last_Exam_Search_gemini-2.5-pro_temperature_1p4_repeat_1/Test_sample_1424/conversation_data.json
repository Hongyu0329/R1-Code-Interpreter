    "## Unveiling the Relationship: Bare Green's Function and Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, exhibits a direct and fundamental inverse dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This relationship forms a cornerstone of many-body quantum theory, providing the starting point for understanding the behavior of non-interacting particles and the foundation upon which the effects of interactions are incorporated.\n\nIn the frequency-momentum domain, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function for a non-interacting system is explicitly given by:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)**\n\nHere, 'k' represents the momentum (or other quantum numbers) of the particle, and 'ω' is the frequency. The crucial components of this expression are:\n\n*   **ϵ_k**: These are the energy eigenvalues of the single-particle Hamiltonian, H₀, which describes the system in the absence of interactions. The Green's function, therefore, has poles at these single-particle energies.\n*   **δ (or sometimes ε)**: This is an infinitesimal positive quantity. Its presence is a mathematical necessity that dictates the boundary conditions and ensures causality. The sign of this term is crucial:\n    *   **+iδ**: This is used for particle states (unoccupied states), shifting the pole slightly into the lower half of the complex frequency plane.\n    *   **-iδ**: This is used for hole states (occupied states), shifting the pole into the upper half of the complex frequency plane.\n\nThis structure reveals that the probability amplitude for a particle of a given momentum k to propagate is significant only when its frequency ω is close to its characteristic energy eigenvalue ϵ_k.\n\nThe path integral formalism provides a powerful method for deriving this relationship. The Green's function is calculated as a functional integral over all possible field configurations. For a non-interacting system, the action in the path integral is quadratic in the fields. This allows for the exact evaluation of the Gaussian integral, which yields the inverse of the operator corresponding to the non-interacting equations of motion. This operator in frequency-momentum space is precisely (ω - ϵ_k), leading directly to the aforementioned form of the bare Green's function.\n\nIn the time domain, the bare Green's function is the Fourier transform of G₀(k, ω). This results in an expression that describes the time evolution of a particle created at a certain point. The dependence on ϵ_k manifests as an oscillatory term with a frequency determined by the energy eigenvalue.\n\nIn essence, the bare Green's function G₀ provides a complete description of the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle, and its functional form is fundamentally dictated by the spectrum of single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, has an inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. In the frequency-momentum representation, this is expressed as G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where ω is the frequency, k is the momentum, and δ is a small imaginary part that enforces causality. This means that G_0 has poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. This relationship is derived from the fact that for a non-interacting system, the action in the path integral is quadratic, and the resulting functional integral yields the inverse of the operator (ω - H_0), where H_0 is the non-interacting Hamiltonian with eigenvalues ϵ_k.>>>"
