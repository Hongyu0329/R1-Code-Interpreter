In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, has an inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. In the frequency-momentum representation, this is expressed as G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where ω is the frequency, k is the momentum, and δ is a small imaginary part that enforces causality. This means that G_0 has poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. This relationship is derived from the fact that for a non-interacting system, the action in the path integral is quadratic, and the resulting functional integral yields the inverse of the operator (ω - H_0), where H_0 is the non-interacting Hamiltonian with eigenvalues ϵ_k.
