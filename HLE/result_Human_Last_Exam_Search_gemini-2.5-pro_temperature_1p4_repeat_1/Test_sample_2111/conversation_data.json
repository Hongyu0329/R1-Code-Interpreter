    "The conceptual entity to which Fernand Braudel refers, quoting Paul Morand's assertion that it should be inscribed within a sphere, is a **civilization**.\n\nFernand Braudel, in his historical analyses, particularly in works like \"A History of Civilizations,\" posits that a civilization is a large, enduring cultural and social entity that encompasses vast geographical areas and long periods. He viewed nations as components existing within these broader civilizational spheres. The idea of a nation being a \"star\" inscribed within a larger \"sphere\" is a metaphor for a nation belonging to a particular civilization. Braudel argues for the unity and coherence of these large civilizational regions. He often discussed civilizations as \"spaces\" or \"cultural spheres,\" reinforcing the idea of an encompassing entity.\n\nWhile the direct quote from Paul Morand is not readily found in Braudel's most prominent digitized works, the concept aligns with Braudel's overarching framework. Braudel emphasized the role of large-scale socioeconomic factors and long-term structures in history, with civilizations being the largest and most enduring of these structures. His work, including \"Civilization and Capitalism,\" frequently discusses the interplay between nations, cities, and the larger \"world-economies\" that function as systems, akin to spheres of influence. Paul Morand's own writings often touched upon the clash and interaction of civilizations on a global scale.\n\nTherefore, the entity exemplified by the symbol of a nation but understood within a grander, spherical context in Braudel's global historical perspective is a civilization.\n\n<<<civilization>>>"
