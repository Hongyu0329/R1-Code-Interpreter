The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in a representation R of the gauge group is given by the local expression:
$a_2(x) = \frac{d(R)}{360} \left( 5R(x)^2 - 8R_{\mu\nu}(x)R^{\mu\nu}(x) + 23R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}(x)R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}(x) \right) - \frac{2}{3} \text{tr}_R(F_{\mu\nu}(x)F^{\mu\nu}(x))$
where $d(R)$ is the dimension of the representation R, $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the Ricci tensor, $R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$ is the Riemann curvature tensor, and $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor of the gauge field. The trace $\text{tr}_R$ is taken over the generators of the gauge group in the representation R.
