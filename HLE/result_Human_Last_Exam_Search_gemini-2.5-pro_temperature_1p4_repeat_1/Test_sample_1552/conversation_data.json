    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action, commonly denoted as $a_2$, is a local geometric invariant constructed from the curvature of the spacetime and the gauge field strength. For a massless Dirac spinor field in four dimensions, which is minimally coupled to gravity and a background non-abelian gauge field, this coefficient can be calculated using the general formulas for the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients.\n\nThe relevant operator for the heat kernel expansion is the square of the gauged Dirac operator, $D^2$, where $D = \\gamma^\\mu (\\partial_\\mu + \\omega_\\mu + A_\\mu)$. Here, $\\gamma^\\mu$ are the Dirac matrices, $\\omega_\\mu$ is the spin connection derived from the spacetime metric, and $A_\\mu$ is the gauge potential. The operator $D^2$ can be written in the form of a generalized Laplacian.\n\nThe second heat kernel coefficient, $a_2(x)$, for a general second-order elliptic operator of the form $-g^{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla_\\mu \\nabla_\\nu - E'$ acting on sections of a vector bundle over a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold is given by the formula established by Gilkey and others. The calculation involves specializing this general formula to the specific case of the squared Dirac operator. This requires identifying the endomorphism term $E'$ and the total curvature $\\mathcal{F}_{\\mu\\nu}$ of the connection on the combined spinor and gauge bundle.\n\nFor a Dirac fermion field transforming in a representation $R$ of the gauge group, the final expression for the trace of the local coefficient $a_2(x)$ is a sum of gravitational and gauge terms. The trace is taken over both the spinor and the gauge group's representation indices. The formula is:\n\n$\n\\text{tr}(a_2(x)) = \\frac{d(R)}{360} \\left( 5R^2 - 8R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + 7R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} \\right) - \\frac{5}{6} \\text{tr}_R(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})\n$\n\nThere appears to be some discrepancy in the coefficients of the curvature terms in the literature. A widely cited result, particularly in the context of anomalies, gives a different set of coefficients for the gravitational part. By combining results from various sources, a common form for the coefficient is:\n\n$\n\\text{tr}(a_2(x)) = \\frac{d(R)}{360} \\left( 5R^2 - 2R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + 2R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} \\right) - \\frac{1}{3} \\text{tr}_R(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})\n$\n\nA calculation based on the general formula for the $a_2$ coefficient for a Laplace-type operator yields:\n\n$\na_2(x) = \\frac{d(R)}{360} ( 5R(x)^2 - 8R_{\\mu\\nu}(x)R^{\\mu\\nu}(x) + 23R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}(x)R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}(x) ) - \\frac{2}{3} \\text{tr}_R(F_{\\mu\\nu}(x)F^{\\mu\\nu}(x))\n$\n\nGiven the sensitivity of the coefficients to the specific formulation and conventions, and the slight variations found across different references, the most cautious approach is to present the terms that consistently appear. All derivations agree that the coefficient is a linear combination of the scalars $R^2$, $R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu}$, $R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}$, and $\\text{tr}_R(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})$. The precise numerical factors can vary depending on the calculational scheme and the basis of invariants used. The expression derived from a standard formula is provided below.\n\n<<<The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in a representation R of the gauge group is given by the local expression:\n$a_2(x) = \\frac{d(R)}{360} \\left( 5R(x)^2 - 8R_{\\mu\\nu}(x)R^{\\mu\\nu}(x) + 23R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}(x)R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}(x) \\right) - \\frac{2}{3} \\text{tr}_R(F_{\\mu\\nu}(x)F^{\\mu\\nu}(x))$\nwhere $d(R)$ is the dimension of the representation R, $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $R_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the Ricci tensor, $R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}$ is the Riemann curvature tensor, and $F_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the field strength tensor of the gauge field. The trace $\\text{tr}_R$ is taken over the generators of the gauge group in the representation R.>>>"
