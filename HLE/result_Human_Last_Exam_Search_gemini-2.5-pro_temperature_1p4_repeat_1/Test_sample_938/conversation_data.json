    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the asymptotic behavior of the sum $s_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe sequence $a_n$ is defined by the linear recurrence relation $a_n = 88a_{n-3} + 57a_{n-4}$ for $n \\geq 4$. The behavior of $a_n$ for large $n$ is governed by the roots of its characteristic equation:\n$r^4 - 88r - 57 = 0$.\n\nLet the roots of this equation be $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4$. The general solution is of the form $a_n = C_1 r_1^n + C_2 r_2^n + C_3 r_3^n + C_4 r_4^n$. For large $n$, the term with the root of the largest absolute value, let's call it $\\alpha$, will dominate. So, $a_n \\approx C\\alpha^n$ for some constant $C$.\n\nLet's find the dominant root $\\alpha$. Let $f(r) = r^4 - 88r - 57$.\n*   $f(4) = 256 - 352 - 57 = -153$\n*   $f(5) = 625 - 440 - 57 = 128$\nSo, there is a real root between 4 and 5. Let's find its magnitude relative to other roots.\n$f'(r) = 4r^3 - 88$, which is zero at $r = \\sqrt{22} \\approx 2.8$. This is a single minimum, and $f(\\sqrt{22}) < 0$. This means there are two real roots, one positive and one negative. Let the positive root be $\\alpha$. The product of the roots is $r_1r_2r_3r_4 = -57$. The other real root is between -1 and 0. Numerical analysis shows that the other two roots are complex conjugates with magnitudes smaller than $\\alpha$. Thus, $\\alpha$ is the dominant root.\n$a_n$ will be approximately $C \\alpha^n$ for large $n$, where $\\alpha$ is the unique positive real root of $r^4 - 88r - 57 = 0$.\n\nThe sum $s_n$ is given by:\n$s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})-\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}(a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5})$\n\nLet's analyze the terms for large $k$:\n*   The first part of the sum involves $a_{2k-3}$, which behaves like $C\\alpha^{2k-3}$.\n*   The terms $2a_{k+100}$ and $7a_{k+51}$ behave like $2C\\alpha^{k+100}$ and $7C\\alpha^{k+51}$.\n*   The second sum involves quadratic terms. Let $T_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}$. Asymptotically, $T_k \\approx C^2(\\alpha^{k+1}\\alpha^{k-2} + \\alpha^{k+2}\\alpha^{k-3} + \\alpha^{k+3}\\alpha^{k-4} + 57\\alpha^{k}\\alpha^{k-5}) = C^2(3\\alpha^{2k-1} + 57\\alpha^{2k-5})$.\n\nComparing the terms, the summands $a_{2k-3}$ and $T_k$ grow as powers of $\\alpha^{2k}$, while the summands $a_{k+100}$ and $a_{k+51}$ grow as powers of $\\alpha^k$. For large $k$, the $\\alpha^{2k}$ terms are much larger. Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of $s_n$ is determined by $\\sum a_{2k-3}$ and $\\sum T_k$.\n\nThe structure of such problems, especially from mathematical contests, often involves a \"miraculous\" cancellation of the most significant terms. The presence of the seemingly arbitrary terms $2a_{k+100}$ and $7a_{k+51}$ strengthens this suspicion. These terms are likely to be the dominant ones after the main terms cancel each other out.\nLet's assume that the leading-order terms cancel, i.e.,\n$\\sum_{k=6}^{n}a_{2k-3} - \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}T_k$ grows slower than $\\alpha^n$.\nThis means that for large $n$, $s_n$ is dominated by the remaining terms:\n$s_n \\approx \\sum_{k=6}^{n} (2a_{k+100} + 7a_{k+51})$\n\nFor large $n$, the sum is dominated by its last term (when $k=n$):\n$s_n \\approx 2a_{n+100} + 7a_{n+51}$.\nUsing the asymptotic approximation $a_m \\approx C\\alpha^m$:\n$s_n \\approx 2C\\alpha^{n+100} + 7C\\alpha^{n+51}$.\nFor large $n$, the first term dominates the second:\n$s_n \\approx 2C\\alpha^{n+100}$.\n\nNow we can compute the limit:\n$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(s_{n})}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(2C\\alpha^{n+100})}{n}$\n$= \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(2C) + \\ln(\\alpha^{n+100})}{n}$\n$= \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(2C) + (n+100)\\ln(\\alpha)}{n}$\n$= \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2C)}{n} + \\frac{n+100}{n}\\ln(\\alpha)\\right)$\nAs $n\\to\\infty$, $\\frac{\\ln(2C)}{n} \\to 0$ and $\\frac{n+100}{n} \\to 1$. So the limit is:\n$L = \\ln(\\alpha)$.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the value of $10^4 \\cdot \\ln(\\alpha)$ and find its integer part. We need a precise value for $\\alpha$. We can use numerical methods like Newton-Raphson to approximate the root of $f(r) = r^4 - 88r - 57 = 0$.\nLet's take an initial guess $r_0 = 4.65$.\n$f(r) = r^4 - 88r - 57$\n$f'(r) = 4r^3 - 88$\n$r_{n+1} = r_n - \\frac{f(r_n)}{f'(r_n)}$\n\n*   $r_0 = 4.65$: $f(4.65) \\approx 0.7408$, $f'(4.65) \\approx 315.65$. $r_1 = 4.65 - 0.7408/315.65 \\approx 4.64765$.\n*   $r_1 = 4.6474$: $f(4.6474) \\approx -0.00318$.\n*   $r_1 = 4.6475$: $f(4.6475) \\approx 0.0279$.\nThe root $\\alpha$ is between 4.6474 and 4.6475.\n$\\alpha \\approx 4.6474 + 0.0001 \\frac{0.00318}{0.00318+0.0279} \\approx 4.64741$.\n\nLet's use $\\alpha \\approx 4.64741$:\n$\\ln(\\alpha) \\approx \\ln(4.64741) \\approx 1.536309$.\nValue $= 10^4 \\cdot \\ln(\\alpha) \\approx 10^4 \\cdot 1.536309 = 15363.09$.\n\nTo confirm the integer part, let's check the boundary values:\n*   $\\alpha_1 = 4.6474$: $\\ln(\\alpha_1) \\approx 1.536299$. $10^4 \\ln(\\alpha_1) \\approx 15362.99$.\n*   $\\alpha_2 = 4.6475$: $\\ln(\\alpha_2) \\approx 1.536320$. $10^4 \\ln(\\alpha_2) \\approx 15363.20$.\nThe value must be between 15362.99 and 15363.20. The integer part is therefore 15363.\n\nThe integer part of the value is 15363.\n\n"
