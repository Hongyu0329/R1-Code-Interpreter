    "### Radon: Earth's Rarest Noble Gas in 2002\n\nIn 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was radon. This conclusion is based on the combined abundances of noble gases in the Earth's crust and atmosphere, the two primary components of terrestrial matter where these elements are found.\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere has a mass of approximately 5.15 quadrillion metric tons (5.15 x 10¹⁸ kg), while the crust weighs in at a significantly more substantial 27.7 sextillion metric tons (2.77 x 10²² kg). Due to its extremely short half-life of about 3.8 days, radon exists in minuscule and transient amounts in the atmosphere. Its concentration in the crust is also exceptionally low, estimated at about 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram.\n\nIn contrast, xenon, the second-rarest noble gas, is more abundant. The atmospheric concentration of xenon is about 87 parts per billion by volume, and its crustal abundance is approximately 0.020 parts per billion by weight.\n\nWhen calculating the total mass of each gas in the terrestrial environment, radon's presence is markedly scarcer than xenon's. The total mass of radon in the atmosphere and crust is estimated to be in the range of thousands of kilograms, whereas the total mass of xenon is in the trillions of kilograms.\n\nTherefore, when expressed as a percentage of the total terrestrial matter, radon's share is infinitesimal, making it the rarest of the noble gases. The abundances of these elements are not believed to have changed significantly by the year 2002 or in the years since.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
