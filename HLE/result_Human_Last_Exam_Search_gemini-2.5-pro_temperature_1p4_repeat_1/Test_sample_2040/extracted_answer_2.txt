Yes, particularly for odd-layered hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets. They possess the required non-centrosymmetric crystal structure for a second-order nonlinear optical process like SPDC. The reduced dimensionality of nanosheets also relaxes the stringent phase-matching conditions necessary in bulk crystals, making them promising candidates for this quantum phenomenon.
