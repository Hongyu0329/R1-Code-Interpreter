    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we first need the prime factorization of $d$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $d=53599$ is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. The conductor $d$ is a product of distinct odd primes.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ (where $p_i$ are distinct primes) is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i$. Since the moduli are prime, any non-principal character $\\chi_i \\pmod{p_i}$ is primitive. The order of the trivial character is 1.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the characters $\\chi_i$. We require the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, so we must have:\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\n\nLet's determine the possible orders for the primitive characters modulo each prime factor:\n*   **Modulo 7:** The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. The orders of the elements (and thus the orders of the characters) can be any divisor of 6, which are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The number of non-principal (and thus primitive) characters of a specific order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n    *   Order 1: 1 (the principal character)\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n*   **Modulo 13:** The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(13) = 12$. The possible orders are the divisors of 12. Since we need the lcm to be 6, we are interested in orders that are divisors of 6.\n    *   Order 1: 1\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n*   **Modulo 19:** The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/19\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(19) = 18$. The possible orders are the divisors of 18. We are interested in orders that are divisors of 6.\n    *   Order 1: 1\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n*   **Modulo 31:** The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/31\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(31) = 30$. The possible orders are the divisors of 30. We are interested in orders that are divisors of 6.\n    *   Order 1: 1\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\nLet $N(k)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p_i$ of order $k$. For each of the primes $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, the number of primitive characters with orders dividing 6 are:\n*   $N(1) = 1$\n*   $N(2) = 1$\n*   $N(3) = 2$\n*   $N(6) = 2$\n\nLet the orders of the four characters be $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$, where $o_i$ is the order of the character $\\chi_i$. We need $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$. The orders $o_i$ must be divisors of 6.\n\nWe can calculate the number of combinations of characters where the lcm of their orders divides a certain number:\n*   Number of combinations where orders divide 6: Each character can have an order from {1, 2, 3, 6}. For each prime factor, there are $N(1)+N(2)+N(3)+N(6) = 1+1+2+2 = 6$ such characters. Thus, there are $6^4 = 1296$ combinations where the order divides 6.\n*   Number of combinations where orders divide 3: Each character can have an order from {1, 3}. For each prime, there are $N(1)+N(3) = 1+2 = 3$ such characters. So there are $3^4 = 81$ combinations where the order divides 3.\n*   Number of combinations where orders divide 2: Each character can have an order from {1, 2}. For each prime, there are $N(1)+N(2) = 1+1 = 2$ such characters. So there are $2^4 = 16$ combinations where the order divides 2.\n*   Number of combinations where orders divide 1: There is only one character of order 1 for each prime, so there is $1^4 = 1$ combination where the order is 1.\n\nThe number of characters of order exactly 6 is the number of characters whose order divides 6, minus those whose order is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., divides 3 or 2). Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:\nNumber = (divides 6) - (divides 3) - (divides 2) + (divides 1)\nNumber = $1296 - 81 - 16 + 1 = 1200$.\n\n"
