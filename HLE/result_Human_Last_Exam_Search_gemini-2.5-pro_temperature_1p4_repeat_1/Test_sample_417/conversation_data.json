    "To determine the number of expected peaks (signals) in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we must analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry. The question uses the term \"peaks,\" which in this context refers to chemically non-equivalent sets of protons, not the individual lines resulting from spin-spin splitting.\n\n### Molecular Structure Analysis:\n1.  **Central Core**: The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core. The substituents are located at positions 1, 3, and 5. This means the benzene ring is fully substituted, and there are **no aromatic protons** directly attached to the ring.\n2.  **Symmetry**: The molecule has a C3 axis of rotational symmetry passing through the center of the benzene ring. This symmetry makes the three large substituents attached at positions 1, 3, and 5 chemically equivalent. It also makes the three methyl groups on the central ring (at positions 2, 4, and 6) chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to determine the number of unique proton signals from one of the substituent \"arms\" and the methyl groups on the central ring.\n\n### Signal Enumeration:\n\n*   **Central Ring Methyl Groups (Ar-CH3)**: Due to the C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent. This will produce **1 signal**.\n\n*   **Linker Methylene Groups (Ar-CH2-N)**: The three methylene (-CH2-) groups that link the central ring to the indazole units are equivalent by the C3 symmetry. However, each linker is attached to a chiral indazole unit. This chirality makes the two protons on each CH2 group diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts. Therefore, these methylene protons will give rise to **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Indazole Moiety Protons**: We need to analyze the protons on one of the `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole` units. This rigid, chiral bicyclic system, also known as campho[2,3-c]pyrazole, has no internal symmetry. Consequently, all of its protons are in unique chemical environments. Analysis of similar structures in the literature confirms the number of signals.\n    *   **Protons on the bicyclic frame and pyrazole ring**: This camphor-derived skeleton has one proton on the pyrazole ring, one bridgehead proton, and two CH2 groups. As all these protons are in a rigid and asymmetric environment, they are all non-equivalent, giving a total of **6 signals** (1 + 1 + 2 + 2).\n    *   **Methyl Groups**: The substituent has three methyl groups. One is at a bridgehead (C7), and two are geminal (at C8). The geminal methyl groups are diastereotopic due to the chiral nature of the rest of the molecule and are therefore chemically non-equivalent. This results in **3 distinct signals** for the three methyl groups.\n    *   In total, the indazole moiety gives 6 + 3 = **9 signals**.\n\n### Total Signal Count:\n\nBy summing the signals from each unique part of the molecule, we get:\n*   From the three equivalent Ar-CH3 groups: 1 signal\n*   From the three equivalent but internally diastereotopic Ar-CH2-N groups: 2 signals\n*   From the nine non-equivalent protons within one indazole arm: 9 signals\n\nTotal expected peaks = 1 + 2 + 9 = **12**\n\n<<<H>>>"
