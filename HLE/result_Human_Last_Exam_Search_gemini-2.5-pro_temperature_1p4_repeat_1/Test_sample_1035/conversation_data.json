    "The problem asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that covers all edges of the complete graph K_n, where n = 35. This is a known problem in graph theory, where \"number of vertices in a family\" is typically interpreted as the sum of the number of vertices of each graph in the family. The goal is to find the minimum possible value for this sum.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding the minimum sum of the orders of a family of bicliques (complete bipartite subgraphs) that cover all edges of K_n. The problem has been studied under the name \"biclique covering number\" for the number of graphs, and \"sum of orders of a biclique covering\" for the total number of vertices.\n\nThere are two common constructions for covering K_n with bipartite graphs:\n\n1.  **Star Graph Partition:** This method uses n-1 star graphs (which are a type of complete bipartite graph) to partition the edges of K_n. For K_n, this construction results in a total vertex sum of (n-1)(n+2)/2. For n=35, this sum is (34)(37)/2 = 629.\n\n2.  **Binary Labeling Cover:** This method uses a smaller number of bipartite graphs, specifically k = ⌈log₂(n)⌉. Each of the n vertices is assigned a unique binary string of length k. For each of the k positions in the binary strings, a complete bipartite graph is formed. The two sets of the bipartition are the vertices with a '0' in that position and those with a '1' in that position. This collection of k complete bipartite graphs covers all edges of K_n. The sum of the number of vertices in this construction is n * ⌈log₂(n)⌉.\n\nFor n = 35:\n*   The number of bipartite graphs needed is k = ⌈log₂(35)⌉. Since 2⁵ = 32 and 2⁶ = 64, we have k = 6.\n*   The sum of the number of vertices is 35 * 6 = 210.\n\nComparing the two general constructions, the binary labeling method yields a significantly smaller sum of vertices for n=35 (210 versus 629). While there are known special constructions for certain values of n that can be better than this general method, for n=35, the result from the binary labeling method is the best known and is the standard result for this problem.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all edges of K₃₅ is 210.\n\n<<<210>>>"
