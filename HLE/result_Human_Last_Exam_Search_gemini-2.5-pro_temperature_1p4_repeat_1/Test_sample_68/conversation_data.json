    "An elegant tapestry of mathematics, knot theory provides a fascinating way to distinguish different types of knots. One such method is through the concept of knot coloring, which relies on an underlying algebraic structure. The figure-eight knot, a fundamental example in this field, can indeed be colored, and the smallest algebraic structure that permits this coloring has five elements.\n\nThe process of \"coloring\" a knot involves assigning a number from a set of integers to each arc of the knot's diagram. At each crossing, a specific rule must be followed: the sum of the colors of the two under-crossing arcs must be congruent to twice the color of the over-crossing arc, all calculated modulo a chosen integer 'n'. This is known as an n-coloring. For a coloring to be considered non-trivial, at least two different colors must be used.\n\nThe algebraic structure underpinning this concept is known as a quandle. For an n-coloring, the set of integers {0, 1, ..., n-1} with the operation a * b = 2b - a (mod n) forms a quandle. The number of elements in this algebraic structure is therefore 'n'.\n\nInvestigations into the colorability of the figure-eight knot reveal that it is not 3-colorable. Attempts to color it with three colors inevitably lead to a violation of the coloring rules or result in a trivial coloring where all arcs have the same color. Similarly, it has been shown that a non-trivial 4-coloring is not possible.\n\nHowever, the figure-eight knot is 5-colorable. This is directly related to the determinant of the knot, a specific knot invariant. The determinant of the figure-eight knot is 5. A key theorem in knot theory states that a knot is p-colorable, for a prime number p, if and only if p divides the determinant of the knot. Since the determinant of the figure-eight knot is 5, it is 5-colorable. As 3 does not divide 5, it is not 3-colorable.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer 'n' that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot is 5. This corresponds to the dihedral quandle Râ‚…, an algebraic structure with 5 elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
