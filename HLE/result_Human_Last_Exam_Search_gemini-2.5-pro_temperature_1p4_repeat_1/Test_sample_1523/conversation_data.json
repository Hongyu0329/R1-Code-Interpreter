    "In the context of finite-temperature field theory, the partition function Z for a neutral scalar field ϕ is expressed through the functional integral formalism. The inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action in this formulation.\n\nThe partition function is given by:\n\nZ = ∫ D[ϕ] exp(-S_E[ϕ])\n\nHere, D[ϕ] is the functional measure over all field configurations, and S_E[ϕ] is the Euclidean action for the scalar field. For a free, neutral scalar field, the Euclidean action is:\n\nS_E[ϕ] = ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d³x [ ½ (∂<sub>τ</sub>ϕ)² + ½ (∇ϕ)² + ½ m²ϕ² ]\n\nwhere β is the inverse temperature (β = 1/T), τ is the imaginary time, and m is the mass of the scalar field.\n\nThis action is quadratic in the field ϕ. The \"inner product\" in the functional integral representation is a generalization of the standard inner product for functions, and in this context, it takes the form of an integral over spacetime. The expression (ϕ, D_ϕ) represents the action S_E[ϕ] written in a more compact form:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = S_E[ϕ] = ½ ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) D_ϕ ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nBy comparing the two expressions for the Euclidean action, we can identify the operator D_ϕ. Integrating the first term by parts, we get:\n\n∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d³x ½ (∂<sub>τ</sub>ϕ)² = -½ ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d³x ϕ (∂<sub>τ</sub>²ϕ)\n∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d³x ½ (∇ϕ)² = -½ ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d³x ϕ (∇²ϕ)\n\nTherefore, the operator D_ϕ is identified as:\n\nD_ϕ = -∂<sub>τ</sub>² - ∇² + m²\n\nThis is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. Thus, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field is the Euclidean action of the free field:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ½ ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂<sub>τ</sub>² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field, the inner product of (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is the Euclidean action for the free scalar field. It is given by the expression:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ½ ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂<sub>τ</sub>² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nwhere:\n*   `ϕ(τ, x)` is the neutral scalar field.\n*   `D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.\n*   `β` is the inverse temperature (1/T).\n*   `τ` is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β.\n*   `x` represents the spatial coordinates.\n*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field."
