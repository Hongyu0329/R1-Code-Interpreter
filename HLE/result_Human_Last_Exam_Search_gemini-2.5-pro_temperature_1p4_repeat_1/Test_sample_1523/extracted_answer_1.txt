In finite-temperature field theory, for a neutral scalar field, the inner product of (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is the Euclidean action for the free scalar field. It is given by the expression:

(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ½ ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂<sub>τ</sub>² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)

where:
*   `ϕ(τ, x)` is the neutral scalar field.
*   `D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.
*   `β` is the inverse temperature (1/T).
*   `τ` is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β.
*   `x` represents the spatial coordinates.
*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.
