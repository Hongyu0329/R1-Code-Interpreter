    "Hypothetically, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar would be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the parent nanocar molecule. The prefix \"perfluoro-\" signifies that all hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nThe exact number depends on the specific structure of the nanocar in question, as several different versions have been synthesized. Based on published chemical formulas for different nanocar variants:\n\n*   One version of a flexible nanocar has the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. A perfluorinated version of this molecule would therefore contain **34 fluorine atoms**.\n*   Another documented nanocar structure has the chemical formula C₄₃₀H₂₇₄O₁₂. If this molecule were to be perfluorinated, it would contain **274 fluorine atoms**.\n\nThus, the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar depends entirely on which nanocar structure is being modified.\n\n<<<274>>>"
