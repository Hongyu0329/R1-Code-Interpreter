    "## Rule 110: Unveiling the Pattern After 20 Steps\n\nWhen the cellular automaton Rule 110 is applied 20 times starting from a single cell in state 1, it generates a complex, asymmetric binary pattern. The resulting pattern is **11101111110110100111**.\n\nRule 110 is a fundamental one-dimensional cellular automaton that determines the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) based on its own state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors. Its name is derived from the binary representation of the rules that govern its evolution: 01101110, which is equivalent to the decimal number 110.\n\nThe evolution of the pattern is determined by the following set of rules for the state of the central cell in the next generation:\n\n| Current 3-Cell Pattern | New State of Center Cell |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nBeginning with a single \"1\" surrounded by \"0\"s, each subsequent line of the pattern is generated by applying these rules to the preceding line. This process, repeated 20 times, results in the intricate sequence mentioned above. The behavior of Rule 110 is notable for its complexity and its position on the border between stable and chaotic systems, even being proven to be capable of universal computation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step evolution of the pattern for the first few iterations:\n\n*   **Generation 0:** ...0001000...\n*   **Generation 1:** ...0011100...\n*   **Generation 2:** ...0110110...\n*   **Generation 3:** ...1110011...\n\nContinuing this process for 20 generations leads to the final binary string.\n\n<<<11101111110110100111>>>"
