    "To determine the values of `λ` for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we first analyze the structure of the equation:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.`\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, can be simplified. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we have:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + xⁿ⁻³y² + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = Σ_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`.\n\nThis shows that the kernel is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, as it is a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and functions of `y`.\n\nLet's substitute this form of the kernel back into the integral equation:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (Σ_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k) u(y) dy`\n`u(x) = 1 + λ Σ_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\n\nWe can define a set of constants `c_k` as the moments of the unknown function `u(y)`:\n`c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`, for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nWith these constants, the solution `u(x)` must have the form of a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ Σ_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)`\n\nNow, we can create a system of linear equations for the unknown constants `c_j`. We substitute the polynomial form of `u(y)` back into the definition of `c_j`:\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ Σ_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)) dy`\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ Σ_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy`\n`c_j = [y^(j+1)/(j+1)]₀¹ + λ Σ_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k [y^(j+n-k)/(j+n-k)]₀¹`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ Σ_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j+n-k)`\n\nThis can be rearranged into a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` constants `c_0, ..., c_(n-1)`:\n`c_j - λ Σ_(k=0)^(n-1) (1 / (j+n-k)) c_k = 1/(j+1)` for `j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nThis system can be written in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where:\n*   `c` is the column vector of the unknowns `[c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1)]^T`.\n*   `b` is the column vector `[1/1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]^T`.\n*   `A` is the `n x n` matrix with elements `A_jk = 1 / (j+n-k)`, where `j` is the row index and `k` is the column index (both starting from 0).\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system (and therefore the integral equation) has no solution if the matrix `(I - λA)` is singular, and the vector `b` is not in the column space of `(I - λA)`.\n\nThe matrix `(I - λA)` is singular if its determinant is zero. This occurs when `1` is an eigenvalue of `λA`, which is equivalent to `1/λ` being an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. The values of `λ` for which this happens are called the characteristic values of the integral equation.\n\nFor such a characteristic value `λ`, the corresponding homogeneous integral equation `v(x) = λ ∫ K(x,y) v(y) dy` has non-trivial solutions `v(x)`. The inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the function `f(x)` (which is `f(x)=1` in our case) is orthogonal to all solutions of the adjoint homogeneous equation.\n\nThe kernel `K(x,y)` is symmetric (`K(x,y) = K(y,x)`), which means the integral operator is self-adjoint. Thus, the solutions to the adjoint equation are the same as the solutions `v(x)` to the homogeneous equation. The condition for the existence of a solution is:\n`∫₀¹ f(x)v(x) dx = 0`\n`∫₀¹ 1 * v(x) dx = 0`\n\nThe eigenfunctions `v(x)` are non-trivial polynomials of degree at most `n-1`. The integral `∫₀¹ v(x) dx` is the zeroth moment of `v(x)`, which is the first component (`C_0`) of the eigenvector of matrix `A` corresponding to the eigenvalue `1/λ`.\n\nIt can be shown that for the matrix `A` in question, none of its eigenvectors has a zero first component (`C_0=0`). This means that for any eigenfunction `v(x)`, `∫₀¹ v(x) dx ≠ 0`. Therefore, the orthogonality condition is never met.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that the equation has no solution for all characteristic values of `λ`. These are the values of `λ` for which `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n\n**Example for n=2:**\nThe kernel is `K(x,y) = x+y`. The matrix `A` is:\n`A = [[1/(0+2-0), 1/(0+2-1)], [1/(1+2-0), 1/(1+2-1)]] = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`\nThe eigenvalues `μ` of `A` are found by solving `det(A - μI) = 0`:\n`(1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0` => `μ = 1/2 ± 1/√3`.\nThe values of `λ` for which there are no solutions are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues:\n`λ = 1 / (1/2 ± 1/√3) = 1 / ((√3 ± 2)/(2√3)) = 2√3 / (√3 ± 2)`\n`λ₁ = 2√3(√3-2) / (3-4) = -6 + 4√3`\n`λ₂ = 2√3(√3+2) / (3-4) = -6 - 4√3`\n\n<<<The equation has no solutions for values of `λ` that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A` whose elements are given by `A_{jk} = 1/(j + n - k)` for `j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`."
