    "Based on Veronika Campan's interpretation, the individual who, at the end of his work, addressed the issue of another's material possessions by ignoring the prohibition against representation is Jacques Lacan. Campan, an academic researcher, has edited works that discuss Jacques Lacan's theories on representation. Lacan, a French psychoanalyst, explored these themes in his seminar, \"The Ethics of Psychoanalysis,\" where he analyzed the Ten Commandments. He linked the prohibition against representation (the Second Commandment against graven images) to the prohibitions against coveting another's material possessions (the Ninth and Tenth Commandments), interpreting them through the lens of psychoanalytic concepts of desire.\n\n<<<Jacques Lacan>>>"
