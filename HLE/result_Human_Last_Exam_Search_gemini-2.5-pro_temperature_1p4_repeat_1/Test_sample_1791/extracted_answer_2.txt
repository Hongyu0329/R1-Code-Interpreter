To obtain the effective electron-electron interaction, we perform a Gaussian path integral over the phonon fields. The phonon action is quadratic, and the electron-phonon interaction acts as a source term for the phonon fields. Integrating out the phonon fields yields an effective interaction between the electron densities that were coupled to the phonons.

The initial electron-phonon coupling is given by:
$H_{e-ph} = g \sum_{\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{q}, j} \frac{i q_j}{\left(2 m w_q\right)^{1 / 2}} \hat{n}_{\mathbf{q}}\left(a_{\mathbf{q}, j}+a_{-\mathbf{q}, j}^{\dagger}\right)$

This interaction describes the electron density $\hat{n}_{\mathbf{q}}$ coupling to the phonon modes. By performing the path integral over the phonon degrees of freedom, we obtain a second-order effect which corresponds to an effective interaction between electron densities, $\hat{n}_{\mathbf{q}}$ and $\hat{n}_{-\mathbf{q}}$.

The resulting effective electron-electron interaction potential for a specific wavevector **q** is given by:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}) = -\frac{g^2 |\mathbf{q}|^2}{m w_q^2}$

This potential represents an attractive interaction, where the strength depends on the coupling constant $g$, the mass $m$, the phonon frequency $w_q$, and the momentum transfer squared $|\mathbf{q}|^2$. This effective attraction is the basis for conventional BCS superconductivity.
