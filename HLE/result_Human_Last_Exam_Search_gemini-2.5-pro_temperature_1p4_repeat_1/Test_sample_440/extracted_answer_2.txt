The density profile `ρ(z)` is implicitly defined by the solution to a system of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations derived from the principle of constant chemical potential for each gas species in a gravitational field, incorporating the van der Waals equation of state for a mixture. An analytical solution is not feasible. Qualitatively, `ρ(z)` decreases with height due to gravity, with the heavier gas (B) being more concentrated at lower altitudes. The van der Waals `a` parameter (attraction) tends to steepen this density decrease, while the `b` parameter (repulsion) tends to make it more gradual compared to an ideal gas.
