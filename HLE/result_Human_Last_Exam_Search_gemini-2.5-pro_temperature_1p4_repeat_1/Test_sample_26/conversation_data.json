    "Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ can be determined by studying the homotopy of the complement space $U = \\mathbb{CP}^3 \\setminus X$.\n\nThe following steps lead to the result:\n\n1.  **Relation between the homotopy of X and its complement**: For a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ with $n \\ge 2$, a result by Looijenga shows that the homotopy groups of the hypersurface and its complement are isomorphic for degrees 3 and higher. For our case, $n=3$, this means $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(U)$.\n\n2.  **Universal cover of the complement**: The fundamental group of the complement $U = \\mathbb{CP}^3 \\setminus X$ is $\\pi_1(U) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_5$. The higher homotopy groups of $U$ are isomorphic to those of its universal cover, $\\tilde{U}$. Thus, $\\pi_3(U) \\cong \\pi_3(\\tilde{U})$.\n\n3.  **Homotopy type of the universal cover**: The universal cover $\\tilde{U}$ has the homotopy type of the Milnor fiber, $F$, of the singularity of the affine cone over $X$. This is a standard result in the theory of hypersurface complements.\n\n4.  **The Milnor fiber**: For a generic homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ in $n+1$ variables that defines an affine cone with an isolated singularity at the origin, the Milnor fiber has the homotopy type of a wedge of $\\mu$ spheres of dimension $n$.\n\n5.  **Calculation of the Milnor number**: For the quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the defining polynomial is of degree $d=5$ in $n+1=4$ variables. The Milnor number $\\mu$ is given by the formula $\\mu = (d-1)^{n+1} = (5-1)^{3+1} = 4^4 = 256$. The spheres are of dimension $n=3$.\n\n6.  **Homotopy of the Milnor fiber**: The Milnor fiber $F$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of 256 3-spheres: $F \\simeq \\bigvee_{i=1}^{256} S^3$.\n\n7.  **The third homotopy group**: The third homotopy group of a wedge of spheres is the direct sum of their individual homotopy groups. We know that $\\pi_3(S^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore,\n    $$ \\pi_3(F) \\cong \\bigoplus_{i=1}^{256} \\pi_3(S^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{256} $$\n\nCombining these results, we find that $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{256}$. The rank of this group is the exponent of the direct sum, which is 256.\n\n<<<256>>>"
