    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we must first analyze the qualitative behavior of the system in the phase plane. A separatrix is a curve that divides the phase plane into regions with different long-term trajectory behaviors. These are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system is defined by:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe will analyze the system in the upper half-plane, where $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Find Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find the u-coordinates of the equilibrium points are $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case u = 0:**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case u = 1:**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n**2. Classify the Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe use the Jacobian matrix to classify these points.\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = 2$. Both are positive, so **(1, 0) is an unstable node (source)**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = -2$. Since they have opposite signs, **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Linearization is inconclusive, so this is a non-hyperbolic point.\n\n**3. Identify the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrix marks a boundary between qualitatively different behaviors. Let's analyze the direction of flow based on the sign of $u'(t) = u^2(u-1)$.\n\n*   If $u > 1$, then $u'(t) > 0$, so $u(t)$ increases and trajectories move away from the line $u=1$ to the right, towards $u \\to \\infty$.\n*   If $0 \\le u < 1$, then $u'(t) \\le 0$, so $u(t)$ decreases and trajectories move towards the line $u=0$. The entire region between $u=0$ and $u=1$ is a basin of attraction for the equilibrium point at the origin, $(0,0)$.\n\nThe line $u=1$ forms a clear boundary between two regions:\n1.  A basin of attraction where trajectories converge to the origin ($0 \\le u < 1$).\n2.  A region where trajectories are unbounded in the u-direction ($u > 1$).\n\nThis line $u=1$ is also the stable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$. A stable manifold of a saddle point, which separates the phase plane into regions with different long-term dynamics, is by definition a separatrix.\n\nAnother key trajectory is the unstable manifold of the saddle point. It can be shown that the curve $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution to the system and represents this unstable manifold. One branch of this curve connects the saddle point $(1, -1)$ to the origin $(0, 0)$. However, within the strip $0 < u < 1$, this curve acts as an attractor for all other trajectories rather than a separator. Since all trajectories in this strip are attracted to the origin, the fundamental division of behavior in the phase plane is the line separating this entire basin of attraction from the region of unbounded motion.\n\nTherefore, the separatrix of the system is the line that divides the phase plane into these distinct regions.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the line given by the equation $u=1$.>>>"
