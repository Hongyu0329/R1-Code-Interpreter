    "The volume of the intersection of two cubes, each with a side length of 1, shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to each other is approximately 0.36.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how to arrive at this solution:\n\n**1. Define the Cubes and the Translation**\n\n*   Let the first cube (C1) be the standard unit cube in a Cartesian coordinate system. Its corners are at points (x, y, z) where x, y, and z can be either 0 or 1. This can be expressed as the region: 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1.\n*   The main diagonal of this cube connects opposite vertices, for instance, the origin (0, 0, 0) and the point (1, 1, 1).\n*   The problem states a shift of 1/2 *along* this main diagonal. This means the translation has a distance of 1/2 in the direction of the vector (1, 1, 1).\n*   To find the translation vector, we first need a unit vector in the direction of the main diagonal. The length of the diagonal vector (1, 1, 1) is √(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3. The unit vector is therefore (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3).\n*   The translation vector is the distance (1/2) multiplied by this unit vector, which gives us (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)).\n*   The second cube (C2) is the first cube shifted by this vector.\n\n**2. Determine the Region of Intersection**\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the set of points (x, y, z) that satisfy the conditions for being in both cubes.\n\n*   **For C1:**\n    *   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n*   **For C2:** The coordinates are shifted by t = 1/(2√3).\n    *   t ≤ x ≤ 1+t\n    *   t ≤ y ≤ 1+t\n    *   t ≤ z ≤ 1+t\n\nTo find the intersection, we must find the overlapping range for each coordinate:\n\n*   For x: The range is [max(0, t), min(1, 1+t)]. Since t is positive and less than 1, this simplifies to [t, 1].\n*   For y: Similarly, the range is [t, 1].\n*   For z: The range is also [t, 1].\n\nThe intersection is itself a cube with a side length of (1 - t).\n\n**3. Calculate the Volume**\n\nThe volume of this smaller intersection cube is (side length)³, which is (1 - t)³.\n\n*   Volume = (1 - 1/(2√3))³\n\nTo find the numerical value, we can approximate:\n\n*   √3 ≈ 1.732\n*   t = 1 / (2 * 1.732) ≈ 1 / 3.464 ≈ 0.2887\n*   Side length = 1 - 0.2887 = 0.7113\n*   Volume ≈ (0.7113)³ ≈ 0.3599\n\nFor a more precise answer, the exact expression is:\nVolume = 5/4 - 37√3/72\n\nThis gives a value of approximately 0.35992.\n\n<<<0.35992>>>"
