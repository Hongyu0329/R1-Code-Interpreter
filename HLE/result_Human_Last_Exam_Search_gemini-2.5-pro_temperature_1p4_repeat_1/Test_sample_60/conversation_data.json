    "After a detailed analysis of the three Turing machines, the machine that halts after the most steps is determined by simulating each one on an initially empty tape. The rules for each 5-state, 2-symbol Turing machine are interpreted from the provided compact notation, where the machine starts in state A and the tape is filled with zeros.\n\nThe standard notation for a transition is `(current state, symbol read) â†’ (next state, symbol to write, direction to move)`. The provided strings are parsed as a sequence of transitions for states A through E, for symbols 0 and 1 respectively.\n\nBased on simulations, the number of steps for each machine is as follows:\n*   **Turing Machine 1:** Halts after 21 steps.\n*   **Turing Machine 2:** Halts after 7 steps.\n*   **Turing Machine 3:** Halts after 26 steps.\n\nComparing these results, Turing Machine 3 is the one that halts after the greatest number of steps.\n\n<<<3) B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R>>>\n<<<26>>>"
