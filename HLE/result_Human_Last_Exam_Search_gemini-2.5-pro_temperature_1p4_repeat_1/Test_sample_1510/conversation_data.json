    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe crystallographic point groups are either cyclic (Cₙ) or dihedral (Dₙ). A point group of order 2 can be of type C₂ or D₁. The wallpaper groups corresponding to these point groups are:\n*   **p2**: This group has a point group of C₂, which consists of the identity and a 180° rotation. The order of C₂ is 2.\n*   **pm**: This group has a point group of D₁, which consists of the identity and a reflection. The order of D₁ is 2.\n*   **pg**: This group also has a point group of D₁. It involves glide reflections, but its point group is of order 2.\n*   **cm**: This group also corresponds to the point group D₁, with an order of 2.\n\nA comprehensive table in one of the search results confirms that the point groups for p2, pm, and pg are isomorphic to Z₂, the cyclic group of order 2. Other wallpaper groups have point groups of different orders (1, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12).\n\nTherefore, there are a total of four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
