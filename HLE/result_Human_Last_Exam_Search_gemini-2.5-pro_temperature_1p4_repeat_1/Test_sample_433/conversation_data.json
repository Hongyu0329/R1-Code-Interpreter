    "### Opened Single-Dose Ampules Must Be Used Immediately and Cannot Be Stored\n\nOnce a single-dose ampule is punctured or opened in a sterile environment, it must be used immediately, and any remaining contents should be discarded. Unlike vials, ampules are not designed to be resealable, and therefore cannot maintain sterility once opened.\n\nThe beyond-use date (BUD) is the time after which a compounded sterile preparation should not be used. For a single-dose ampule, that time is immediate.\n\nFor other single-dose containers, such as vials, the BUD after puncture depends on the environment:\n\n*   **In an ISO Class 5 Environment or Cleaner:** A single-dose vial that is punctured in at least an ISO Class 5 environment can be used for up to 12 hours after the initial entry, as long as it remains in that sterile environment. Some guidelines may still refer to a 6-hour limit.\n*   **In an Environment Worse than ISO Class 5:** If a single-dose container is opened in an environment with air quality less than ISO Class 5, it must be used within one hour of being punctured.\n\nIt is crucial to differentiate between ampules and vials, as the guidelines for their use after opening are distinct. While single-dose vials may be used for a limited time after puncture in a sterile setting, opened ampules have no storage time.\n\n<<<A single-dose ampule must be used immediately after being punctured in a sterile environment, and any unused portion must be discarded.>>>"
