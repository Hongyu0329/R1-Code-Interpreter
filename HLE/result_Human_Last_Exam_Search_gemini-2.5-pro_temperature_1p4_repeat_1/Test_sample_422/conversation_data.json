    "<<<Assuming the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge, and a world with only two epistemic states (Knowledge and Belief), two significant problems arise that are independent of Gettier cases.\n\n**1. The Infinite Regress of Justification**\n\nThe \"Justification\" condition of JTB theory states that for a belief to become knowledge, it must be justified. The problem of infinite regress questions what qualifies as a valid justification. If every justification must itself be a belief that is justified, this creates an endless chain of \"becauses.\"\n\nIn a system limited to only Knowledge and Belief, this problem becomes particularly acute. Consider a proposition 'P' that a person believes.\n*   For 'P' to become Knowledge, it needs a justification, let's call it 'J1'.\n*   The question then arises: Is 'J1' in the state of Knowledge or Belief?\n*   If 'J1' is merely a Belief, it seems too weak to serve as the foundation that elevates another Belief ('P') to the certain status of Knowledge.\n*   If 'J1' must be Knowledge, then it too must have a justification, 'J2', which must also be Knowledge. This leads to an infinite regress where no belief can ever be fundamentally justified and therefore transformed into knowledge, because the chain of justification is either endless or rests on an unjustified belief.\n\nThis forces an impossible situation: either knowledge is built on a foundation of mere belief (which seems inadequate), or it requires an infinite and unattainable chain of known justifications.\n\n**2. The Problem of Sufficient Justification**\n\nThe JTB definition is notably vague about the *quality* or *quantity* of justification required to turn a true belief into knowledge. It does not specify a clear criterion for what counts as \"sufficient\" or \"adequate\" justification. This ambiguity creates a demarcation problem between what should be categorized as a very strongly held Belief versus what can be elevated to the state of Knowledge.\n\nThis issue is amplified in a binary system of only Belief and Knowledge:\n*   **If the standard for justification is too low:** A Belief that is true and has even minimal, flimsy justification would have to be counted as Knowledge. This would seem to grant the status of Knowledge too easily, possibly including beliefs that are true only by a form of luck not covered by Gettier cases.\n*   **If the standard for justification is too high (e.g., requiring absolute certainty):** It would become nearly impossible for any Belief to achieve the status of Knowledge. Most of what we commonly consider knowledge—from scientific theories to historical facts—would be relegated to the state of Belief, as they are based on evidence that is strong but not logically certain.\n\nWithout a clear, non-arbitrary line defining \"sufficient\" justification, the JTB model fails to provide a functional way to distinguish between the only two available epistemic states, rendering the distinction between a well-justified belief and knowledge unclear. This is also known as the \"problem of the criterion\".>>>"
