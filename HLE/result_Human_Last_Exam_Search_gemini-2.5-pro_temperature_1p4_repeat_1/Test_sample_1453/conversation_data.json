    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern (`abcdefg`) and then analyze the residues at the core `a` and `d` positions, which dictate the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nA coiled-coil structure is characterized by a repeating 7-amino acid pattern. The `a` and `d` positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues that form the core of the structure. The provided sequence is 32 amino acids long, suggesting approximately 4.5 heptad repeats. The sequence appears to have four repeating blocks with minor variations, preceded by a `GE` and followed by a `G`.\n\nThe most likely repeating pattern is one that places the most hydrophobic residues (I, L, A, W) into the `a` and `d` positions. After analyzing the possible phasing of the `abcdefg` repeat, the most chemically consistent register is one where Alanine (A) is at the `a` position and Leucine (L) is at the `d` position.\n\nLet's apply this register (`fgabcde`) to the main sequence blocks:\n\n*   **Sequence Block 1:** E-I-**A**-Q-S-**L**-K\n*   **Register:** .........f-g-**a**-b-c-**d**-e\n\nThis assignment holds for all four repeating units of the sequence:\n*   **Heptad 1:** Core is **a=A**, **d=L**.\n*   **Heptad 2:** Core is **a=A**, **d=L** (residue at `b` is K).\n*   **Heptad 3:** Core is **a=A**, **d=L** (residue at `b` is W).\n*   **Heptad 4:** Core is **a=A**, **d=L**.\n\nThis gives a consistent hydrophobic core of Alanine at the `a` positions and Leucine at the `d` positions.\n\n### Step 2: Applying Knobs-into-Holes Packing Principles\n\nThe oligomeric state of a coiled-coil is largely determined by the identity and packing of the side chains at the `a` and `d` positions. Landmark studies on the GCN4 leucine zipper established key rules:\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored by Isoleucine (a beta-branched amino acid) at the `a` position and Leucine at the `d` position (`a=I, d=L`).\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored when both `a` and `d` positions are occupied by Isoleucine (`a=I, d=I`). The packing geometry in a trimer is different (\"acute\") and accommodates these residues well.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Favored by the reverse of the dimer-forming pattern, with Leucine at `a` and Isoleucine at `d` (`a=L, d=I`).\n\nIn our sequence, we have **`a=A, d=L`**.\n*   Alanine (A) has a small methyl side chain, unlike the larger, beta-branched Isoleucine (I) or Valine (V).\n*   Leucine (L) has a larger, isobutyl side chain.\n\nThe packing of a small residue like Alanine at the `a` position and a larger Leucine at the `d` position fits best into a trimeric arrangement. In a three-stranded coiled-coil, the smaller `a` position residue packs into a \"hole\" created by the larger `d` position residues from the other two helices. This combination allows for efficient and stable knobs-into-holes packing, which would be less optimal in a dimeric or tetrameric state based on these specific core residues. The combination `a=Ile, d=Ala` is known to specify a trimer, and the `a=Ala, d=Leu` arrangement is expected to behave similarly from a packing efficiency standpoint.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of knobs-into-holes interactions, a coiled-coil with Alanine at the 'a' positions and Leucine at the 'd' positions is most likely to be a trimer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
