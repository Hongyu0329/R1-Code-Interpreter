    "This puzzle requires determining a transformation rule from an input grid of numbers to an output grid. Let's analyze the provided examples to uncover this rule.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\nFirst, let's represent the inputs and outputs as grids. The comma in the string separates the rows.\n\n**Example A:**\n*   Input_A:\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 2 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   Output_A:\n    ```\n    2 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\nChanges: The '2' at position (1, 1) becomes a '0', and the '0' at position (0, 0) becomes a '2'.\n\n**Example B:**\n*   Input_B:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   Output_B:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\nChanges: The '2' at position (3, 6) becomes a '0' (the output string for that row is `1111001111111`, not `1111000111111`), and the '0' at position (2, 7) becomes a '2'.\n\n### Deducing the Rule\n\nIn both examples, the transformation involves a '2' swapping its value with a '0' at a different location. The core of the puzzle is to figure out which '0' is chosen as the target. Let's analyze the movement of the '2'. We will use 0-based indexing for rows and columns `(row, column)`.\n\n1.  In **Example A**, the '2' moves from `(1, 1)` to `(0, 0)`. The change in coordinates is `(-1, -1)`.\n2.  In **Example B**, the '2' moves from `(3, 6)` to `(2, 7)`. The change in coordinates is `(-1, +1)`.\n\nThe direction of movement seems to depend on the starting coordinates of the '2'. Let's examine the parity (odd or even) of the coordinates:\n\n*   In A, the '2' is at `(1, 1)` (odd row, odd column). The move is `(-1, -1)`.\n*   In B, the '2' is at `(3, 6)` (odd row, even column). The move is `(-1, +1)`.\n\nThis suggests a pattern based on parity:\n*   The row's parity determines the vertical movement: odd row means move up (`-1`).\n*   The column's parity determines the horizontal movement: odd column means move left (`-1`), even column means move right (`+1`).\n\nLet's formulate a complete rule:\n*   If '2' is at `(r, c)` where `r` is odd, `c` is odd: move is `(-1, -1)`.\n*   If '2' is at `(r, c)` where `r` is odd, `c` is even: move is `(-1, +1)`.\n*   If '2' is at `(r, c)` where `r` is even, `c` is odd: we can extrapolate the move might be `(+1, -1)`.\n*   If '2' is at `(r, c)` where `r` is even, `c` is even: we can extrapolate the move might be `(+1, +1)`.\n\nThe transformation only occurs if the destination cell contains a '0'. In both A and B, the destinations `(0, 0)` and `(2, 7)` contained '0's.\n\n### Solving for MISSING\n\nNow we apply this rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   Input_C: `'000000,011120,111111'`\n*   Grid representation:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 1 1 1 2 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n\n1.  The '2' is located at `(1, 4)`.\n2.  The row index is 1 (odd) and the column index is 4 (even).\n3.  This matches the condition from Example B (odd row, even column), so the move vector is `(-1, +1)`.\n4.  The destination coordinates are `(1 - 1, 4 + 1) = (0, 5)`.\n5.  We check the value at `(0, 5)` in the input grid. It is '0'.\n6.  The condition is met, so we perform the swap:\n    *   The '2' at `(1, 4)` becomes a '0'.\n    *   The '0' at `(0, 5)` becomes a '2'.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nConverting this grid back to the string format gives us the value for MISSING.\n\n*   Row 0: `000002`\n*   Row 1: `011100`\n*   Row 2: `111111`\n\nOutput_C = `'000002,011100,111111'`\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
