    "The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline \"Ask Why\" were physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** and economist **Amartya Sen**.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major advertising effort by Enron before its collapse. The commercials featured various personalities, with Reddit threads and other online discussions specifically identifying Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann, a physicist, as one of the prominent figures. In these discussions, another featured individual is referred to as an \"Indian commentator,\" who has been identified as Amartya Sen, an Indian economist and fellow Nobel laureate.\n\nThe campaign's slogan, \"Ask Why,\" ironically became a symbol of the company's downfall, as it encouraged the very questioning that would eventually uncover one of the largest corporate fraud cases in history.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
