    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), there have been a total of 27 players who have won a batting Triple Crown and 39 pitchers who have won a pitching Triple Crown.\n\nThe batting Triple Crown is achieved when a player leads their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season. This difficult feat has been accomplished by 17 different players in MLB history. Some notable players have won it multiple times, including Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams, who each won it twice. The most recent batting Triple Crown winner was Miguel Cabrera in 2012, breaking a 45-year drought. If players from the Negro Leagues are included, the total number of batting Triple Crown winners rises, with Oscar Charleston, for example, having won it three times.\n\nThe pitching Triple Crown is awarded to a pitcher who leads their league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA). This has been achieved by 39 different pitchers in MLB history. Several pitchers have won the pitching Triple Crown on multiple occasions. Notable multiple winners include Christy Mathewson, Lefty Grove, Lefty Gomez, Roger Clemens, and Clayton Kershaw. The legendary Sandy Koufax accomplished the feat three times in his career.\n\n<<<46>>>"
