    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, corresponds to a Galois connection between the posets. We are looking for the number of adjunctions from $$ to $$.\n\nAn adjunction consists of a pair of morphisms, a left adjoint $L: \\to$ and a right adjoint $R: \\to$. In this context, these are order-preserving maps. The condition for $L$ and $R$ to form an adjunction is equivalent to the following inequalities for all $i \\in$ and $j \\in$:\n1.  $i \\le R(L(i))$\n2.  $L(R(j)) \\le j$\n\nThis pair of conditions defines a (monotone) Galois connection between the posets $$ and $$. In such a connection, the left adjoint $L$ is uniquely determined by the right adjoint $R$, and vice-versa. Therefore, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left-adjoint maps or, equivalently, the number of possible right-adjoint maps.\n\nA map between complete lattices is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). The objects of the simplex category, $[n]$, are finite totally ordered sets, which are complete lattices. The supremum of a subset is its maximum element. The supremum of the empty set is the bottom element of the lattice, which is $0$. Thus, for $L: \\to$ to be a left adjoint, it must be an order-preserving map that also preserves the bottom element, meaning $L(0) = 0$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ satisfying $L(0)=0$. An order-preserving map is defined by the sequence of its values, which must be non-decreasing:\n$L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$.\nThe values are taken from $ = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nWith the condition $L(0)=0$, we have the sequence:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $L(0)$ is fixed, we need to choose the 23 values for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $38$ elements. This is a \"stars and bars\" problem, equivalent to choosing 23 items from 38 with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter as they will be arranged into a non-decreasing sequence. The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$, where $k=23$ is the number of items to choose and $n=38$ is the number of available options.\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{23 + 38 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nDually, a map is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). This implies that an order-preserving map $R: \\to$ is a right adjoint if it preserves the top element, i.e., $R(37) = 23$. We would then need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$. This is equivalent to choosing 37 values from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has 24 elements. The number of ways is $\\binom{37+24-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nSince $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{37}$, both approaches yield the same result.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<\"C(60, 23)\" or \"60!/(23! * 37!)\">>>"
