    "Adult Raphidopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are predators that primarily feed on soft-bodied arthropods. Aphids are a frequently mentioned food source for adult snakeflies.\n\nIn addition to being predaceous, some adult snakeflies are also known to eat pollen. While one source mentions that it is unclear whether they drink nectar, others state they may feed on \"sugary substances,\" which would include nectar.\n\nBased on the available information:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Plausible, as they are recorded feeding on sugary substances.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Plausible, as aphids are a staple of their diet.\n\nThere is no record of them feeding on fungus or leaf tissue. Therefore, the most accurate answer combines the recorded food sources of nectar and aphids.\n\n<<<F>>>"
