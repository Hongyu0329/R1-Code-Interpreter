    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is 2.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of a topological insulator and is directly related to the number of protected chiral edge states at its boundary. For a single Chern insulator with a Chern number of C, there will be |C| conducting edge states.\n\nWhen two such insulators are brought together, the total topological charge, and thus the total Chern number, of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers. This principle of additivity has been shown in studies of stacked van der Waals heterostructures, where layers of Chern insulators are placed on top of each other with weak interlayer coupling. For instance, stacking *n* layers of a C=1 Chern insulator results in a system with a total Chern number of *n*.\n\nIn the case of a lateral junction with a negligible tunneling barrier, the two systems are weakly coupled. While they are joined side-by-side rather than stacked, the topological properties of the overall system are determined by the sum of the individual topological invariants. Therefore, the total Chern number of the junction of two C=1 Chern insulators is C_total = C1 + C2 = 1 + 1 = 2. This implies that the combined system will have two co-propagating chiral edge states at its outer boundary.\n\n<<<2>>>"
