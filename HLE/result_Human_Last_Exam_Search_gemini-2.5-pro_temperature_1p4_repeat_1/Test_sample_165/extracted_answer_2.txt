The number of initial values of $S$ for which it is impossible to make the sequence of operations end in all zeroes is given by the formula:
$$ \frac{1}{2} \left( \binom{2k+1}{n} - (-1)^{k + \frac{n-1}{2}} \binom{k}{\frac{n-1}{2}} \right) $$
This single formula accounts for the parity of both $n$ (which is odd) and $k$.
