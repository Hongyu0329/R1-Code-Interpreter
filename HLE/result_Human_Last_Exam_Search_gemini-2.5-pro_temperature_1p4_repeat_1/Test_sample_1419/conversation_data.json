    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* is given in terms of ϵ = 4 - d, where d is the spatial dimension.\n\nThe beta function for the coupling constant *u* to the lowest order is:\n\nβ(u) = ϵu - bu²\n\nwhere *b* is a constant. The fixed point u* is found by setting the beta function to zero, β(u*) = 0. This gives a non-trivial fixed point when:\n\nϵu* - bu*² = 0\n\nSolving for u* yields:\n\nu* = ϵ / b\n\nDifferent sources may use slightly different conventions for the constant *b*. A common result, for a single component scalar field (N=1), gives b = 3. In this case, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling is:\n\nu* = ϵ / 3.\n\nThis result is a cornerstone of the ϵ-expansion, introduced by Wilson and Fisher, which allows for the calculation of critical exponents in dimensions slightly below the upper critical dimension of four. At this fixed point, the system exhibits universal critical behavior.\n\n<<<u* = ϵ / 3>>>"
