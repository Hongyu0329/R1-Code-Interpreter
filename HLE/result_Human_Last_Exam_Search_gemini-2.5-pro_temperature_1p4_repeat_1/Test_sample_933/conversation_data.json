    "The most widely recognized and efficient method for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) involves the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gas. This process is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio within a nickel container. The nickel vessel is used because it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface, which prevents further corrosion by the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nThe synthesis is highly sensitive to temperature. The seminal work on XeF4 synthesis, as well as numerous subsequent studies and patents, identifies a specific temperature range for this reaction. The most frequently cited and optimal temperature for the efficient production of XeF4 is 400°C. A US patent for the process details a temperature range between 350°C and 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature for a quantitative reaction. Some flow methods have also utilized a broader range of 300-500°C.\n\nWhile reactions at lower temperatures can occur, they tend to favor the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF2), making the production of XeF4 inefficient and contaminated with byproducts. Conversely, higher temperatures and an excess of fluorine favor the formation of xenon hexafluoride (XeF6). Although one source mentions a temperature of 873 K (approximately 600°C), 400°C is the most consistently reported temperature for achieving a good yield of XeF4.\n\nTherefore, considering the options provided, 400°C is the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
