The tightest lower bound on the minimax risk \( R_n^* \) that can be proved under the given setup is:
\[
R_n^* \ge \frac{\Phi(\delta/2)}{2} \left( 1 - d_{TV}\left(P_0^n, \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N P_j^n\right) \right)
\]
where \( d_{TV}(P, Q) \) denotes the total variation distance between the probability measures \( P \) and \( Q \).
