    "To find the number of stable equilibria, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the differential equation\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t).\n$$\nEquilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. So, we set the right-hand side of the equation to zero:\n$$\n-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0\n$$\nWe can factor out a $-x$ from the expression:\n$$\n-x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$\n-x(x - 1)^{2} = 0\n$$\nThe solutions to this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the two equilibrium points.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of each equilibrium point. Let $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$, and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$. If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use another method.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$$\nf'(x) = -3x^{2} + 4x - 1\n$$\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at the equilibrium points:\n\n1.  For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:\n    $$\n    f'(0) = -3(0)^{2} + 4(0) - 1 = -1\n    $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\n2.  For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:\n    $$\n    f'(1) = -3(1)^{2} + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0\n    $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We can analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n    *   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $f(x) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009 < 0$. This means that to the left of $x=1$, solutions will decrease, moving away from 1.\n    *   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $f(x) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.01) = -0.011 < 0$. This means that to the right of $x=1$, solutions will decrease, moving towards 1.\n\nFor an equilibrium to be stable, solutions on both sides must converge to the equilibrium point. Since solutions starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium point (it is a semi-stable equilibrium).\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x = 0$. So, the number of stable equilibria is $m=1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$. Substituting the value of $m$:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
