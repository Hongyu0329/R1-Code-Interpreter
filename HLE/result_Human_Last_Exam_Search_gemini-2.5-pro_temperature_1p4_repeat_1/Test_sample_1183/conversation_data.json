    "The symmetry group of the molecule with the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is most likely the **C₃ point group**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Core Structure:** The SMILES string describes a derivative of truxenone. The parent truxenone molecule is a planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a high degree of symmetry, belonging to the **C₃ₕ point group**. This group includes a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ).\n\n*   **Substitution:** The molecule is substituted with three ethynyl (C≡C) groups. The SMILES notation suggests these groups are attached to the peripheral phenyl rings in a manner that preserves the three-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Loss of Planarity:** While the truxenone core is planar, the addition of substituents, especially groups like ethynyl, can lead to steric hindrance. To alleviate this strain, the molecule is likely to adopt a non-planar, propeller-like shape. This distortion removes the horizontal mirror plane (σₕ).\n\n*   **Resulting Symmetry:** When the horizontal mirror plane is lost but the three-fold rotational axis is maintained, the symmetry of the molecule is reduced from C₃ₕ to **C₃**. Molecules belonging to the C₃ point group are chiral. The synthesis of truxenone derivatives with C₃ symmetry is a known strategy to create chiral molecules with specific optical properties.\n\nWhile a perfectly planar conformation would result in C₃ₕ symmetry, the literature on substituted truxenones strongly suggests that a non-planar C₃ structure is more probable for this molecule.\n\n<<<C₃>>>"
