    "The peptide RGDSPSS (B) is highly likely to bind an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay. This is based on substantial evidence for the very similar peptide, GRGDSP, which has been extensively studied and documented as an integrin-binding peptide.\n\nThe core sequence for many integrin-binding proteins is the tripeptide RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid). The amino acids flanking this RGD motif are known to influence the specificity and affinity for different integrin subtypes.\n\nNumerous in vitro studies have demonstrated the binding of the closely related peptide GRGDSP to various integrins:\n\n*   In a purified integrin-ligand binding assay, the linear GRGDSP peptide competitively inhibited the binding of denatured collagen and fibrinogen to the immobilized integrin αIIbβ3.\n*   A standard binding assay with platelets showed that preincubation with the GRGDSP peptide increased the binding of a monovalent ligand to integrin αIIbβ3.\n*   The peptide GRGDSP is often used as a standard for comparison in competitive binding assays to identify other integrin-binding peptides.\n*   In a competitive inhibition assay, GRGDSP was shown to reverse the inhibition of decidual cell attachment to fibronectin, confirming its interaction with the RGD-binding site on integrins.\n*   The binding affinity of the linear GRGDSP peptide to a fragment of the α5β1 integrin has been measured.\n\nGiven that the RGDSPSS peptide shares the critical RGD motif and the subsequent serine and proline residues with the well-established integrin-binding peptide GRGDSP, it is highly probable that it also binds to integrin receptors in an in vitro assay. The additional serine residues at the C-terminus would likely modulate the binding affinity or specificity but are unlikely to eliminate binding altogether.\n\nWhile another peptide from the options, RGDLTTP (C), was identified in a screening for AAV capsid variants that bind to integrin heterodimers, the volume and variety of direct in vitro evidence for the closely related GRGDSP make RGDSPSS a very strongly supported answer. Evidence for the other peptides (A, D, and E) binding to integrins in vitro is less direct in the provided research.\n\n<<<B>>>"
