    "The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a hypothesis class is the cardinality of the largest set of points that the class can shatter. A set of points is said to be \"shattered\" if for every possible binary labeling of these points, there exists a hypothesis in the class that can produce that labeling.\n\nThe hypothesis class in question is $H_{z-ones} = \\{h: X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$, where $X$ is a domain of size $T$, and $z$ is a positive integer.\n\nTo determine the VC dimension, we need to find the size of the largest subset of $X$ that can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$. Let $S$ be a subset of $X$ with size $k$. For $S$ to be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$, for every possible labeling of the points in $S$, there must be a function $h$ in $H_{z-ones}$ that correctly assigns those labels.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary labeling for the points in $S$. This labeling will assign '1' to a certain subset $S' \\subseteq S$ and '0' to the points in $S \\setminus S'$. Let the size of $S'$ be $j$, where $0 \\le j \\le k$. For this labeling to be achievable by a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, the total count of points $x$ in the entire domain $X$ for which $h(x)=1$ must be exactly $z$.\n\nSince the hypothesis $h$ must assign '1' to all $j$ points in $S'$, it must assign '1' to an additional $z-j$ points from the remainder of the domain, $X \\setminus S$. The size of this remaining part of the domain is $T-k$. For it to be possible to choose $z-j$ points from $X \\setminus S$, two conditions must be met:\n1. The number of points to be chosen, $z-j$, must be non-negative: $z-j \\ge 0$.\n2. The number of points to be chosen, $z-j$, must not exceed the total number of available points in $X \\setminus S$: $z-j \\le T-k$.\n\nThese two conditions must hold for *every* possible labeling of the set $S$, which means they must be true for all possible values of $j$, from $j=0$ to $j=k$.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints on $k$:\n1. The condition $z-j \\ge 0$ is equivalent to $j \\le z$. For this to be true for all $j$ in $\\{0, 1, ..., k\\}$, it must hold for the largest value of $j$, which is $k$. Thus, we must have $k \\le z$.\n2. The condition $z-j \\le T-k$ is equivalent to $k+z-j \\le T$. For this to hold for all $j$ in $\\{0, 1, ..., k\\}$, it must be true for the value of $j$ that maximizes the left-hand side, which is $j=0$. This gives us $k+z \\le T$, which can be rewritten as $k \\le T-z$.\n\nFor a set of size $k$ to be shattered, both conditions must be satisfied. Therefore, $k$ must be less than or equal to both $z$ and $T-z$. This implies that the size of any shatterable set is at most $\\min(z, T-z)$. This establishes an upper bound for the VC dimension.\n\nNow, we need to show that this bound is achievable. Let's demonstrate that a set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered. Let $S$ be any subset of $X$ with $|S|=d$. We need to show that for any labeling of $S$, there is a corresponding hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$.\n\nConsider a labeling with $j$ ones on a subset $S' \\subseteq S$. We need to find a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that produces this labeling. This requires assigning $z-j$ ones to the $T-d$ points in $X \\setminus S$. This is feasible if and only if $0 \\le z-j \\le T-d$.\n\nLet's verify these inequalities for all $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d\\}$:\n1.  $z-j \\ge 0$: Since $j \\le d = \\min(z, T-z)$, it follows that $j \\le z$, and therefore $z-j \\ge 0$.\n2.  $z-j \\le T-d$: Since $j \\ge 0$, we have $z-j \\le z$. We also know that $d \\le T-z$, which implies $z \\le T-d$. Combining these, we get $z-j \\le z \\le T-d$.\n\nBoth conditions hold for any $j$. Thus, any set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered.\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ is $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n<<<$\\min(z, T-z)$>>>"
