    "The computation of the higher algebraic K-groups of rings like $\\mathbb{Z}/m$ is a complex topic at the forefront of modern mathematical research. These groups hold deep arithmetic information and are notoriously difficult to calculate. For the specific case of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, we are looking for the largest integer $n$ for which the $(2n)$-th K-group, denoted $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$, is not the zero group.\n\nFor the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$, where $p$ is a prime and $k$ is an integer, the even-indexed K-groups $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ for $n>0$ are finite $p$-primary groups. Their vanishing depends on the parameters $n, p,$ and $k$.\n\nRecent advances in the field, particularly through the use of trace methods and topological cyclic homology, have made the computation of these groups feasible in many cases. While the full structure of these groups can be very complicated, there are established results regarding when they are non-zero.\n\nA key result by Rognes established that for an odd prime $p$, the highest non-vanishing even K-group for the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^2$ is $K_{2(p-1)}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^2)$. For $p=3$, this means that for the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/9$, the largest value of $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/9)$ is non-zero is $n=p-1 = 3-1 = 2$.\n\nBuilding on this, computations for $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ suggest a pattern. A recent work provides an algorithm and theoretical results on the vanishing of these groups in high degrees. The emerging pattern for the largest value of $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is non-zero is given by the formula $(k-1)(p-1)$.\n\nFor the specific case of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, we have $p=3$ and $k=3$. Applying the formula yields:\n$n = (3-1)(3-1) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\nThis implies that $K_8(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is the highest non-zero even K-group, and for all $n > 4$, the group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is the zero group.\n\n<<<4>>>"
