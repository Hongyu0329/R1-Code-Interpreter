    "Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of $h(x)$, which are the solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n\n1.  **Degree of the composed polynomial:**\n    Since $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both degree 3 polynomials, their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n2.  **Equation for fixed points:**\n    The fixed points are the roots of the equation $f(g(x)) = x$, which can be rewritten as $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\n3.  **Maximum number of roots:**\n    A polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ can have at most 9 solutions. This means the maximum possible number of fixed points is 9.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the constraints:**\n    We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   This means that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n    *   The derivative of the composition is given by the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n    *   Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any value $y$, and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, their product $h'(x)$ is also strictly positive for all $x$.\n    *   This implies that $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a strictly increasing function. A strictly increasing function can indeed intersect the line $y=x$ multiple times.\n\n5.  **Feasibility of 9 fixed points:**\n    To check if 9 fixed points are achievable, we can use Rolle's Theorem. If a differentiable function $P(x)$ has $k$ distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n    Let $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. If $P(x) = 0$ has 9 distinct roots, then its derivative $P'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$ must have at least $9-1=8$ distinct real roots.\n\n6.  **Degree of the derivative:**\n    Let's determine the degree of $P'(x)$.\n    *   $f(x) = ax^3 + \\dots$ with $a \\neq 0$. Then $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + \\dots$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   $g(x) = mx^3 + \\dots$ with $m \\neq 0$. Then $g'(x) = 3mx^2 + \\dots$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   The term $f'(g(x))$ is a composition of a degree 2 polynomial and a degree 3 polynomial, so its degree is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of $P'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$ is the sum of the degrees of $f'(g(x))$ and $g'(x)$, which is $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion on feasibility:**\n    The derivative equation $P'(x) = 0$ is a polynomial equation of degree 8. A degree 8 polynomial can have at most 8 real roots. This is consistent with the requirement from Rolle's theorem for 9 fixed points.\n    Since there is no algebraic or analytic constraint preventing the existence of 9 fixed points, and the fundamental theorem of algebra allows for a degree 9 polynomial to have 9 roots, the maximum number is 9. While constructing such polynomials $f$ and $g$ is complex, it is known to be possible. The special case where $f=g$ leads to a lower maximum of 7, but this does not apply here as $f$ and $g$ can be different.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
