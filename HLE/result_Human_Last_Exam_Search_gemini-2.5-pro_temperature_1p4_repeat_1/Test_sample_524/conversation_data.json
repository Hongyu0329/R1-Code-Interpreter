    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA homogeneous continuum is a compact, connected metric space where for any two points, there exists a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps one point to the other. In the plane, these have been completely classified.\n\nThe four distinct homeomorphism classes are:\n*   **The point:** This is a degenerate continuum.\n*   **The circle:** A simple closed curve.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** This is a non-degenerate, hereditarily indecomposable continuum.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This is a decomposable continuum.\n\nInitially, it was an open question whether the circle was the only non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane. However, in 1948, R. H. Bing showed the pseudo-arc was another example, and in 1959, Bing and F. Burton Jones discovered the circle of pseudo-arcs. The complete classification, confirming that these are the only three non-degenerate examples, was provided by Logan Hoehn and Lex Oversteegen in 2014. Including the degenerate case of a single point, there are a total of four such classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
