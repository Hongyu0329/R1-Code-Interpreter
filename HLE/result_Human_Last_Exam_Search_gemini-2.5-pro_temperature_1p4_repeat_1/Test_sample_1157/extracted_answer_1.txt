The appropriate management for the patient involves immediate systemic control of her diabetes and local wound care, followed by long-term prosthetic rehabilitation. A removable partial denture is the most suitable initial option. The specific procedures include medical consultation for diabetes management, wound irrigation and suturing, and antibiotic coverage. The cells of interest in healing are fibroblasts, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, endothelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and immune cells. For a denture replacement, a cast metal framework removable partial denture with acrylic teeth is recommended. The abutment teeth would be the left central incisor and the left second premolar, with additional support from teeth on the contralateral side. This choice is based on the need for a conservative, hygienic, and biomechanically stable solution given her systemic and dental condition.
