    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nwe can use a method based on row reduction, which is analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for integers. This involves creating a compound matrix and simplifying it using elementary row operations.\n\nThe method is as follows:\n1.  Construct a new matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`:\n    M = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n         [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n         [s, 0],\n         [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n2.  Perform elementary row operations to reduce this matrix to its row-echelon form. The allowed operations are:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\nThe goal is to simplify the matrix until the GCRD can be identified from the remaining non-zero rows.\n\nHere is a step-by-step reduction of the matrix `M`:\n\nInitial matrix M:\n[[s^2 + s, -s],\n [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n [s, 0],\n [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nTo simplify, we want to use rows with lower-degree polynomials to simplify those with higher degrees. Let's use the third and fourth rows to simplify the first and second. Let's first get a constant in the first column. This can be achieved by combining the third and fourth rows. The polynomial division of `s` by `-s-1` gives `s = (-1) * (-s-1) - 1`.\nSo, we can replace the third row (R3) with R3 + 1*R4:\nR3' = [s, 0] + [-s-1, 1] = [-1, 1]\n\nOur matrix becomes:\n[[s^2 + s, -s],\n [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n [-1, 1],\n [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nNow we have a row `R3' = [-1, 1]` which contains a constant. This is very useful for eliminating entries in other rows. Let's move this row to the top for clarity:\n[[-1, 1],\n [s^2 + s, -s],\n [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe can now use the new first row (let's call it R_pivot = `[-1, 1]`) to create zeros in the first column of all other rows:\n*   Replace R2 with R2 + (s^2+s) * R_pivot: `[s^2+s, -s] + (s^2+s)[-1, 1] = [0, -s + s^2+s] = [0, s^2]`\n*   Replace R3 with R3 - (s^2+1) * R_pivot: `[-s^2-1, s^2] - (s^2+1)[-1, 1] = [0, s^2 - (s^2+1)] = [0, -1]`\n*   Replace R4 with R4 - (s+1) * R_pivot: `[-s-1, 1] - (s+1)[-1, 1] = [0, 1 - (s+1)] = [0, -s]`\n\nThe matrix is now:\n[[-1, 1],\n [0, s^2],\n [0, -1],\n [0, -s]]\n\nWe can see that the second column can also be simplified. We have a row `[0, -1]`. Let's use it to eliminate the other entries in the second column:\n*   Swap `[0, -1]` to the second row position.\n*   Replace R1 with R1 + 1 * `[0, -1]`: `[-1, 1] + [0, -1] = [-1, 0]`\n*   Replace R2 (now `[0, s^2]`) with R2 + s^2 * `[0, -1]`: `[0, s^2] + [0, -s^2] = [0, 0]`\n*   Replace R4 (now `[0, -s]`) with R4 - s * `[0, -1]`: `[0, -s] + [0, s] = [0, 0]`\n\nThe matrix has been reduced to:\n[[-1, 0],\n [0, -1],\n,\n]\n\nThe non-zero rows give the GCRD in a row-echelon form. The resulting GCRD is `[[-1, 0], [0, -1]]`. Since the GCRD is defined up to a unimodular left factor (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant), we can multiply this matrix by `-I` (which is unimodular) to obtain the canonical identity matrix form.\n\nThe resulting GCRD is the identity matrix, `I`. This means that the matrices P1 and P2 are right-coprime.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
