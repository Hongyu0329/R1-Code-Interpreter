    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the crease pattern left on the paper divides it into a specific number of regions. By examining the complete set of folds required to create the classic crane, including the preliminary base, the subsequent petal folds, and the final reverse folds for the head and tail, a total of 36 distinct polygonal regions are formed.\n\nThe process of creating a standard origami crane involves a series of intricate folds. These begin with initial diagonal and perpendicular creases that form the basis of the design. The construction of the \"bird base,\" a common starting point in many origami figures, establishes the primary structure of the crane's wings, neck, and tail. Further folds are then made to narrow and shape these appendages, with a final inside reverse fold creating the characteristic head of the crane.\n\nWhen the paper is completely unfolded, this series of mountain and valley folds reveals a complex geometric pattern. A detailed count of the individual, enclosed polygons on this complete crease pattern shows that the paper is divided into 36 separate regions.\n\n<<<36>>>"
