    "It is not possible to provide an exact number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo from William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\" The term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized or defined step in ballet terminology. It is more likely a colloquialism used to describe a movement or sequence that evokes the characteristic style of choreographer George Balanchine.\n\nSvetlana Gileva did perform the Jete Woman solo with the Semperoper Ballett in a 2015 production of the piece. The Balanchine style, often referred to as neo-classical, is known for its musicality, speed, and off-balance movements, which are qualities also seen in Forsythe's work. Forsythe's choreography in \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" is characterized by its deconstruction of classical ballet, pushing the dancers' bodies off their traditional vertical axis and using extreme lines.\n\nGileva's performance in the solo, as documented in a 2015 video, showcases the athletic and dynamic style of the choreography. However, without a precise definition of what the user considers a \"pas de Balanchine,\" a quantitative count remains impossible. The solo is a fluid sequence of interconnected movements, and multiple steps within it could be interpreted as having a \"Balanchine-esque\" quality.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number as \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a standard, countable ballet step.>>>"
