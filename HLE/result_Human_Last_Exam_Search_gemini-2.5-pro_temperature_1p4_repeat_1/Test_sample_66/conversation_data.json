    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix, we analyze its structure based on the design of the flag of Tonga. The flag has a red field with a white canton in the upper-hoist corner, and within this canton, there is a red cross.\n\nLet's represent the red pixels with the value *a* and the white pixels with the value *b*. The resulting matrix will have its elements determined by the color of the corresponding pixel in the flag.\n\nWe can analyze the rows of this matrix. The pixels of the flag, and thus the entries of the matrix, can be divided into three regions:\n1.  The main red field of the flag.\n2.  The red cross within the canton.\n3.  The white background of the canton.\n\nThis means the matrix entries are composed solely of the values *a* and *b*. Let's consider the different types of rows that can be formed:\n\n*   **Type 1: Entirely Red Rows.** These rows correspond to the parts of the flag that are entirely red. This includes all the rows below the canton, as well as the rows that form the horizontal bar of the red cross inside the canton. All of these rows will be identical, consisting only of the value *a*. Let's denote this row vector as `R_a = [a, a, ..., a]`.\n\n*   **Type 2: Canton Rows.** These rows correspond to the parts of the canton that are not part of the horizontal bar of the cross. These rows contain the white background and the vertical bar of the red cross. Therefore, they will be composed of a pattern of *b*s (for the white background) and *a*s (for the vertical bar), followed by all *a*s for the portion of the row in the red field. Critically, all of these rows will be identical to each other. Let's denote this row vector as `R_b = [b, ..., a, ..., b | a, ..., a]`.\n\nSince the entire matrix is constructed from only these two distinct types of row vectors, the rank of the matrix is equal to the number of linearly independent vectors between `R_a` and `R_b`. The rank can be at most 2.\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we need to find values of *a* and *b* that make these two row vectors linearly independent. Two vectors are linearly independent unless one is a scalar multiple of the other. Let's check when `R_b` is a multiple of `R_a`:\n\n`R_b = k * R_a`\n\nThe latter part of the `R_b` vector (corresponding to the red field) consists of all *a*s. Comparing this to the same part of `k * R_a`, we get `a = k * a`.\n*   If we choose *a* to be non-zero, this equation implies that `k = 1`.\n*   If `k = 1`, then for the vectors to be dependent, `R_b` must be equal to `R_a`.\n*   However, `R_b` contains `b` values from the white canton background. For `R_b` to be equal to `R_a`, it must be that `b = a`.\n\nTherefore, if `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`, the two row vectors are linearly independent. In this situation, the space spanned by the rows has a dimension of 2, and thus the rank of the matrix is 2.\n\nLet's consider other cases for completeness:\n*   If `a = b` (and not zero), all pixels have the same value, making all rows identical and non-zero. The rank is 1.\n*   If `a = 0` and `b ≠ 0`, then `R_a` is the zero vector, while `R_b` is not. The set of rows is spanned by a single non-zero vector, giving a rank of 1.\n*   If `a = b = 0`, the matrix is the zero matrix, and the rank is 0.\n\nThe possible ranks are 0, 1, and 2. The maximal value among these is 2. This is achieved whenever the values for red (*a*) and white (*b*) are different, and the value for red is not zero.\n\n<<<2>>>"
