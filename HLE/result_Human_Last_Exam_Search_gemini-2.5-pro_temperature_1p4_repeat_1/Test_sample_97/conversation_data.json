    "To determine the solubility of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of the solid to form its ions and the formation of the soluble complex ion, tetrahydroxoaluminate(III), Al(OH)₄⁻. The relevant reactions and equilibrium constants are:\n\n1.  **Dissolution:** Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    *   K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Complex Formation:** Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    *   K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nThe system must also satisfy the charge balance in the solution. The positive charges from Al³⁺ and H⁺ must equal the negative charges from OH⁻ and Al(OH)₄⁻:\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nBy expressing each concentration in terms of [OH⁻] using the Ksp, Kf, and the ion-product constant for water (Kw = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴), we can solve for the equilibrium hydroxide concentration and subsequently the solubility.\n\nThrough a rigorous calculation involving the charge balance and equilibrium constants, the following concentrations at equilibrium are found:\n*   [Al³⁺] ≈ 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThe total molar solubility is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = (4.44 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³) = 1.774 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures based on the given constants, the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹.\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
