    "A game of chess is played on an 8x8 board, which has a total of 28 edge squares. The goal of the described game is to place the maximum number of bishops on these edge squares in such a way that no two bishops can attack each other.\n\nThe maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on a standard 8x8 chessboard is 14. For an n x n board, the general formula is 2n - 2. A key strategy to achieve this maximum is to place the bishops only on squares of the same color. However, when restricted to only the edge squares, this changes the problem.\n\nThe 28 edge squares of a chessboard are divided equally into 14 light squares and 14 dark squares. Since bishops on light squares cannot attack bishops on dark squares, we can consider the placement on each color independently.\n\nFor the 14 squares of one color, it's found that they form pairs that lie on the same diagonals. Specifically, there are 7 such pairs for each color. For instance, on the light squares, the square a2 is on the same diagonal as g8, a4 with e8, and so on. To avoid attacks, only one bishop can be placed in each of these pairs. This means a maximum of 7 bishops can be placed on the light edge squares.\n\nSimilarly, the 14 dark edge squares also form 7 pairs that attack each other. For example, the corner square a1 attacks the corner square h8. Therefore, a maximum of 7 bishops can be placed on the dark edge squares.\n\nBy combining the placements on both colors, a total of 7 (on light squares) + 7 (on dark squares) = 14 bishops can be placed on the edge squares without any attacking each other.\n\nWith the maximum number of bishops placed being 14 and the total number of edge squares being 28, the number of edge squares that would not have a bishop is the difference between these two numbers.\n\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (maximum bishops) = 14 empty edge squares.\n\nThus, if the players succeeded, 14 edge squares would lack bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
