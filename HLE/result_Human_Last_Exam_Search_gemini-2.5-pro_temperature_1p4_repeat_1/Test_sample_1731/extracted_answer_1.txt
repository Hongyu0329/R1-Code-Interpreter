**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**
The equilibrium mean energy \(\langle E \rangle\) of a photon gas in a cavity of volume \(V\) at temperature \(T\) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
\$$
\langle E \rangle = \frac{8\pi^5 k_B^4}{15h^3c^3} V T^4
\$$

**Equilibrium Entropy:**
The equilibrium entropy \(S\) of the photon gas under the same conditions is:
\$$
S = \frac{32\pi^5 k_B^4}{45h^3c^3} V T^3
\$$
Where:
*   \(V\) is the volume of the cavity.
*   \(T\) is the absolute temperature.
*   \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant.
*   \(h\) is the Planck constant.
*   \(c\) is the speed of light.
