    "Large deviation theorems provide a powerful framework for understanding the emergence of equilibrium statistical mechanics from the microscopic laws of probability. By applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems to a gas of light quanta (photons), we can determine its fundamental equilibrium properties, such as mean energy and entropy. This approach rigorously reproduces the celebrated results of Bose and Planck.\n\n### Theoretical Framework: Large Deviations and Statistical Mechanics\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state of an isolated system is the macroscopic configuration corresponding to the largest number of microscopic arrangements. Large Deviation Theory (LDT) formalizes this concept by quantifying the probability of observing a system in a state that deviates from the most probable one. The core idea is that the probability of such a \"large deviation\" decays exponentially with the size of the system (e.g., the number of particles or the volume).\n\n*   **The Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem** deals with the probability of the empirical distribution of a sequence of random variables. It states that the probability of observing a particular distribution of particles over various states is governed by a \"rate function,\" which is the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence). At equilibrium, the system will be found in the state that maximizes this probability, which corresponds to maximizing the Boltzmann-Sanov entropy.\n\n*   **The Cramer-Chernoff Theorem** is a specific application of LDT that describes the probability of the empirical average of a set of random variables deviating from its expected value. In the context of a photon gas, this theorem is applied to the distribution of total energy. The equilibrium state is achieved when the corresponding rate function is minimized, which is equivalent to maximizing the Boltzmann-Gibbs canonical entropy.\n\n### Application to the Photon Gas (Bose Case)\n\nTo find the equilibrium values for a photon gas, we consider photons as indistinguishable bosons distributed among a set of discrete energy levels. A crucial characteristic of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium is that the number of photons is not conserved; photons can be created and absorbed by the walls of the container. This translates to the chemical potential being zero.\n\n#### Equilibrium Energy Distribution\n\nThe equilibrium distribution of photons over the energy states is found by maximizing the entropy of the system under the constraint of a fixed total average energy. The large deviation theorems establish that this procedure identifies the most probable macroscopic state.\n\nFor bosons, the number of ways to distribute \\(N_s\\) photons in \\(A_s\\) states with energy \\(\\epsilon_s\\) is given by Bose-Einstein combinatorics. By applying the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem and maximizing the resulting entropy using Lagrange multipliers (with one constraint for the total energy and no constraint for the number of particles), one arrives at the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons. The average number of photons \\(\\langle N_s \\rangle\\) in a state with energy \\(\\epsilon_s = h\\nu_s\\) (where \\(h\\) is Planck's constant and \\(\\nu_s\\) is the frequency) at a temperature \\(T\\) is given by the Planck distribution:\n\n\\$$\n\\langle N_s \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\epsilon_s / (k_B T)} - 1}\n\\$$\n\nHere, \\(k_B\\) is the Boltzmann constant. This distribution is the one that minimizes the large deviation rate function, making it the overwhelmingly most probable state at equilibrium.\n\n#### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy, \\(\\langle E \\rangle\\), of the photon gas is obtained by summing the energies of all possible states, weighted by the average number of photons in each state at equilibrium. For a continuous spectrum of frequencies in a cavity of volume \\(V\\), this sum becomes an integral over the density of states.\n\nThe calculation yields the famous Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy:\n\n\\$$\n\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15h^3c^3} V T^4\n\\$$\n\nwhere \\(c\\) is the speed of light. This shows that the mean energy is proportional to the volume and the fourth power of the temperature.\n\n#### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe equilibrium entropy, \\(S\\), is found by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the formula for the Boltzmann-Sanov entropy. The result of this calculation gives the entropy of the photon gas at equilibrium:\n\n\\$$\nS = \\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4}{45h^3c^3} V T^3\n\\$$\n\nThus, by applying the principles of large deviation theory, we can rigorously derive the fundamental equilibrium properties of a photon gas, confirming the foundational results of quantum statistical mechanics.\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\nThe equilibrium mean energy \\(\\langle E \\rangle\\) of a photon gas in a cavity of volume \\(V\\) at temperature \\(T\\) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\\$$\n\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15h^3c^3} V T^4\n\\$$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\nThe equilibrium entropy \\(S\\) of the photon gas under the same conditions is:\n\\$$\nS = \\frac{32\\pi^5 k_B^4}{45h^3c^3} V T^3\n\\$$\nWhere:\n*   \\(V\\) is the volume of the cavity.\n*   \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature.\n*   \\(k_B\\) is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   \\(h\\) is the Planck constant.\n*   \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n>>>"
