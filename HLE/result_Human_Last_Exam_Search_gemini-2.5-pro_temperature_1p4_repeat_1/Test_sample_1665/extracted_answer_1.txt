The magnetic field will be more strong in the cases of the cylinder made of a ferromagnetic material with a high linear permeability (scenario 1) and the cylinder consisting of a ferromagnetic core surrounded by an ideal superconducting shell (scenario 3). The strongest field will be achieved in scenario 3.
