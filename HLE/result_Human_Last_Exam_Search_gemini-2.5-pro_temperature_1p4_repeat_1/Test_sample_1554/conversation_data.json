    "While the term \"hallmark\" itself is not a formally defined concept within the philosophical works of the Lviv-Warsaw School, it is a philosopher from this very school, **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**, who decomposed the broader notion of a sign into categories that include **symptoms** and **signals**.\n\nAjdukiewicz was a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School and made significant contributions to logic, epistemology, and the philosophy of language. A core area of his work was what he termed \"logical semiotics\" or the \"logic of language.\" Within this framework, he analyzed the different ways in which signs can convey meaning.\n\nHis analysis distinguished between different types of signs based on their relationship with the reality they signify. While he may have used slightly different terminology, the conceptual distinction aligns with the user's query:\n\n*   **Symptoms (or Indications):** These are natural signs where a direct causal or existential link exists between the sign and what it signifies. For example, a fever is a symptom of an illness, and smoke is an indication of fire.\n\n*   **Signals:** These are conventional signs, where the relationship between the sign and its meaning is established by rules or an agreement. Traffic lights are a classic example of signals, where the color red arbitrarily signifies the command to stop.\n\nOne scholarly analysis of Ajdukiewicz's work notes, \"The fact that the signals and indications have been characterised in an analogous way prompts the assumption that in both cases Ajdukiewicz used a more general concept of the sign.\" This highlights his effort to create a systematic classification of signs. Another source discussing semiotics in the tradition of the Lviv-Warsaw School refers to \"unconventional denotative signs\" as \"material elements of certain symptoms (let's call them indications),\" further solidifying the connection to this terminology.\n\nTherefore, although he may not have used the precise phrasing of decomposing a \"hallmark,\" Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who analyzed the concept of signs in a way that distinguishes between natural signs (symptoms/indications) and conventional signs (signals).\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
