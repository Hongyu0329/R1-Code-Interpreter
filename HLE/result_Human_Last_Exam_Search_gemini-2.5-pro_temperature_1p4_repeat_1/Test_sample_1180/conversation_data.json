    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above the prime 2, with the valuation $v$ normalized to $v(2)=1$, we must analyze the geometry of the curve over a 2-adic field.\n\nFirst, we establish the valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The standard method for this is the Newton polygon. To analyze the valuations of the roots of $f(x)$, we can equivalently analyze the roots of the reciprocal polynomial, which often simplifies the analysis. Let $x=1/t$. Substituting this into $f(x)=0$ yields $2/t^5 + 2/t^3 + 1 = 0$. Multiplying by $t^5$, we get the polynomial $g(t) = t^5 + 2t^2 + 2 = 0$. The roots of $g(t)$ are the reciprocals of the roots of $f(x)$, so their valuations are the negative of the valuations of the roots of $f(x)$.\n\nWe construct the Newton polygon for $g(t) = t^5 + 2t^2 + 2$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v$. The coefficients are $c_5=1, c_2=2, c_0=2$. The points for the polygon are $(i, v(c_i))$:\n*   (5, v(1)) = (5, 0)\n*   (2, v(2)) = (2, 1)\n*   (0, v(2)) = (0, 1)\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of a single segment connecting (0, 1) and (5, 0). To verify this, we check that the point (2, 1) lies on or above this segment. The line passing through (0, 1) and (5, 0) has the equation $y = -x/5 + 1$. At $x=2$, the corresponding y-value on the line is $-2/5 + 1 = 3/5$. Since $1 > 3/5$, the point (2, 1) is above the segment. Therefore, the lower convex hull is indeed the single segment from (0, 1) to (5, 0).\n\nThe slope of this segment is $(0-1)/(5-0) = -1/5$. The theory of Newton polygons states that if a segment of the polygon has slope $m$ and horizontal length $l$, then there are $l$ roots with valuation $-m$. In our case, the segment has length $5-0=5$, so all 5 roots of $g(t)$, let's call them $\\beta_i$, have valuation $v(\\beta_i) = -(-1/5) = 1/5$.\n\nSince the roots of $f(x)$, denoted $\\alpha_i$, are the reciprocals of the roots of $g(t)$, their valuations are $v(\\alpha_i) = -v(\\beta_i) = -1/5$.\n\nLet's verify this result for consistency. If $\\alpha$ is a root of $f(x)=0$ with $v(\\alpha)=-1/5$, we have:\n*   $v(2\\alpha^5) = v(2) + 5v(\\alpha) = 1 + 5(-1/5) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n*   $v(2\\alpha^3) = v(2) + 3v(\\alpha) = 1 + 3(-1/5) = 1 - 3/5 = 2/5$.\n*   $v(1) = 0$.\n\nFor the sum $2\\alpha^5 + 2\\alpha^3 + 1$ to be zero, the sum of the terms with the minimum valuation must have a valuation greater than that minimum. The minimum valuation is 0, attained by the terms $2\\alpha^5$ and $1$. We need to check if $v(2\\alpha^5 + 1) > 0$.\nLet $\\pi$ be an element in an extension field such that $v(\\pi)=1/5$. We can write $\\alpha = u\\pi^{-1}$ where $u$ is a unit.\n$2\\alpha^5 + 1 = 2(u\\pi^{-1})^5 + 1 = 2u^5\\pi^{-5} + 1$. If we choose the extension such that $2=\\pi^5$, this becomes $u^5+1$.\n$v(u^5+1) > 0$ means that in the residue field, $\\bar{u}^5+1=0$, which is $\\bar{u}^5=1$. Since the residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$, this implies $\\bar{u}=1$. This is a consistent condition.\n\nThe next step is to compute the pairwise valuations $v(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j)$. These distances determine the structure of the stable reduction. We can find the sum of these valuations using the discriminant of the polynomial. The discriminant of $f(x)=2x^5+2x^3+1$ is $D = 19412 = 4 \\cdot 4853 = 2^2 \\cdot 4853$. Thus, $v(D)=v(2^2)=2$.\nThe formula for the discriminant is $D = a_n^{2n-2} \\prod_{i<j}(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j)^2$. Taking valuations:\n$v(D) = (2n-2)v(a_n) + 2\\sum_{i<j}v(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j)$.\nHere $n=5$ and $a_n=2$, so $v(a_n)=1$.\n$2 = (2\\cdot 5 - 2) \\cdot 1 + 2\\sum_{i<j}v(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j) = 8 + 2\\sum_{i<j}v(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j)$.\nThis gives $2\\sum_{i<j}v(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j) = 2 - 8 = -6$, so $\\sum_{i<j}v(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j) = -3$.\nThis result shows a contradiction, as the valuations $v(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j)$ should be positive, since $v(\\alpha_i)=-1/5$, $v(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j) \\geq \\min(v(\\alpha_i), v(\\alpha_j))=-1/5$. The sum of 10 such terms should be $\\geq -2$. This contradiction points to a subtle issue in the standard application of these formulas, possibly related to the chosen model of the curve.\n\nHowever, in the context of such problems, there's often a direct connection between the stable reduction components and specific transformations of the equation. In the theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves, the thickness of a node is related to the valuations of the roots. Without a full, consistent calculation of the root separation, a definitive answer is difficult.\n\nBased on similar problems and the structure of the valuations, the thickness is often a simple rational number derived from the primary valuation data. Given the unresolved contradictions in the standard approach, a clear path to the solution is obstructed.\n\nLet's try a different calculation for the valuation of the discriminant. Using the formula $v(\\text{Disc}(f)) = v(a_n) + \\sum_{i=1}^n v(f'(\\alpha_i))$, where one has to be careful. The correct formula is $v(\\text{Disc}(f)) = (n-1) v(a_n) + \\sum_{i=1}^n v(f'(\\alpha_i))$.\n$v(f'(\\alpha_i)) = v(10\\alpha_i^4 + 6\\alpha_i^2) = v(2\\alpha_i^2(5\\alpha_i^2+3))$.\n$v(\\alpha_i)=-1/5$, so $v(\\alpha_i^2)=-2/5$.\n$v(5\\alpha_i^2) = -2/5$ and $v(3)=0$. Thus, $v(5\\alpha_i^2+3) = -2/5$.\n$v(f'(\\alpha_i)) = v(2) + 2v(\\alpha_i) + v(5\\alpha_i^2+3) = 1 + 2(-1/5) - 2/5 = 1/5$.\nSo, $\\sum v(f'(\\alpha_i)) = 5 \\cdot (1/5) = 1$.\n$v(D) = (5-1)v(2) + \\sum v(f'(\\alpha_i)) = 4 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 5$.\nThis result $v(D)=5$ contradicts both $v(D)=2$ from the numerical value and the result from the previous formula. These persistent contradictions suggest that either the premises are incorrect or a non-standard theoretical framework is required.\n\nGiven these difficulties, a precise, rigorously derived value is not attainable with standard methods. A likely source of error is the formula for the discriminant's valuation in this specific context. If we trust the valuation from the resultant calculation, $v(D)=5$.\nThen $5 = 8 + 2\\sum v(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j)$, which yields $\\sum v(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j) = -3/2$. Still a contradiction.\n\nIf we trust the direct calculation $v(D)=2$, we have $\\sum v(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j) = -3$. Again a contradiction. There are no direct means to resolve this.\n\nWithout a clear path, one might speculate the thickness is a fundamental quantity like $v(p)=1$. However, this is usually not the case. Given the complexity and the contradictions, it's possible the value is related to the ramification needed to \"see\" the geometry, which involves fifth roots. A value of $1/4$ was derived under an assumption that turned out to be inconsistent with the discriminant, but it is a plausible form for an answer.\n\nGiven the irreconcilable contradictions from multiple standard methods, I cannot produce a confident answer.\n\n"
