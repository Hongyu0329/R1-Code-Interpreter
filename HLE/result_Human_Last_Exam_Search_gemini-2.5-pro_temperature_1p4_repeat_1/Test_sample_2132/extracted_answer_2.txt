The Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, which is typically cyclopentanecarboxylic acid or an ester thereof, is not a pre-calculated value found in readily available sources. This value can be determined using the Böttcher Score online calculator by providing the SMILES string of the specific product. For cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, the SMILES string is OC(=O)C1CCCC1.
