    "Based on Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue (green), and blue itself, is **G**.\n\nIn his work *Opticks* (1704), Newton proposed an analogy between the seven colors of the visible spectrum and the seven notes of a musical scale. He arranged these colors—Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet—on a wheel. The color found spectrally between yellow and blue is green.\n\nNewton associated these colors with the notes of a Dorian musical mode, which is a scale that can be played on the white keys of a piano starting on D. The specific correlation he established is as follows:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   **Green - G**\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nThe question asks for the note corresponding to the range that begins with the color between yellow and blue (Green) and ends at Blue. This range is represented by the segment for Green, which is assigned the musical note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
