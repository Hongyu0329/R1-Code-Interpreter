    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes and ketones into alkenes using a phosphonium ylide (a Wittig reagent). This reaction is a versatile method for carbon-carbon bond formation.\n\nThe specific reaction in question involves two reactants:\n*   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. The ylide is formed from the corresponding phosphonium salt, and its structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(2-ClC₆H₄).\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde is exchanged with the carbanionic carbon of the ylide, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon double bond and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O) as a byproduct.\n\nApplying this to the given reactants:\n*   The `(CH₃)₃C-CH` fragment from pivalaldehyde combines with the `CH-CH₂(2-ClC₆H₄)` fragment from the ylide.\n\nThis results in the formation of an alkene with the structure **(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂(2-ClC₆H₄)**. The IUPAC name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nAn important aspect of the Wittig reaction is its stereochemistry. The geometry (E/Z isomerism) of the resulting alkene is dependent on the nature of the ylide.\n*   **Stabilized ylides**, which have an electron-withdrawing group attached to the negatively charged carbon, typically yield (E)-alkenes.\n*   **Non-stabilized ylides**, which have alkyl or hydrogen groups, predominantly form (Z)-alkenes under standard lithium-salt-free conditions.\n\nThe ylide in this reaction, Ph₃P=CH-CH₂(2-ClC₆H₄), has a substituted alkyl group (`-CH₂(2-ClC₆H₄)`) attached to the nucleophilic carbon. This group is not an electron-withdrawing group that can stabilize the carbanion through resonance. Therefore, it is classified as a non-stabilized ylide. Consequently, the reaction is expected to be Z-selective, meaning the major product will be the (Z)-isomer.\n\nThe final product is a mixture of E and Z isomers, with **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene** being the major component.\n\n<<<The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is primarily **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**, along with its (E)-isomer as a minor product, and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct."
