    "To determine the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10¹⁰⁰), we can use the periodic property of the tangent function, which has a period of π. This means that for any integer *k*, tan(x) = tan(x - kπ). The problem is thus reduced to finding the value of 10¹⁰⁰ modulo π.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\ntan(10¹⁰⁰) = tan(10¹⁰⁰ mod π)\n\nTo find this, we need to determine the fractional part of the division of 10¹⁰⁰ by π. Let {x} denote the fractional part of a number x.\n\n10¹⁰⁰ mod π = π * {10¹⁰⁰ / π}\n\nCalculating {10¹⁰⁰ / π} is equivalent to finding the digits of 1/π that come after the 100th decimal place. Shifting the decimal point 100 places to the right in the decimal expansion of 1/π gives us 10¹⁰⁰/π. The fractional part of this new number is determined by the sequence of digits starting from the 101st digit of 1/π.\n\nThe decimal expansion of 1/π begins as:\n0.3183098861837906715377675267450287240689192914809126959062508990138339732824363287931652157863233154...\n\nThe first 100 digits after the decimal point are shown above. The subsequent digits are:\n...8424424883...\n\nTherefore, the fractional part of 10¹⁰⁰ / π is approximately 0.8424424883. Let's call this value *f*.\n\nThe next step is to compute the tangent of π multiplied by *f*:\nArgument = π * *f* ≈ 3.1415926535 * 0.8424424883 ≈ 2.64673305 radians.\n\nUsing a calculator, we find the tangent of this value:\ntan(2.64673305) ≈ -0.5463024\n\nThe first three digits after the comma are therefore 546.\n\n<<<546>>>"
