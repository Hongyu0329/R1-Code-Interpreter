    "There are exactly **four** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA product-free set in a group G is a subset S such that there are no elements a, b, c in S (not necessarily distinct) for which ab = c. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 has been established. According to research by S. Hart (formerly Street) and others, the finite groups that have a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2, denoted as S = {a, b}, are the following:\n\n*   **The cyclic group of order 4 (C₄):** For example, the set {x, x³} where x is a generator of C₄.\n*   **The cyclic group of order 6 (C₆):** An example is the set {x², x⁵}, where x is a generator of C₆.\n*   **The dihedral group of order 6 (D₆):** This group is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃. An example of such a set is {r, s}, where r is an element of order 3 and s is an element of order 2.\n*   **The Klein four-group (C₂ × C₂):** Any pair of distinct non-identity elements forms a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nThese four groups are the only ones, up to isomorphism, that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2. The classification for dihedral groups confirms that only D₆ (and D₄, which is isomorphic to C₂ × C₂) can have such a set.\n\n<<<4>>>"
