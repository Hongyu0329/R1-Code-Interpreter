    "The surname in question belongs to the British-American poet W. H. Auden. This literary puzzle originates from an essay by the Russian writer and journalist Pyotr Vail, likely from his book \"Гений места\" (Genius Loci).\n\nIn his description of Vienna, Vail uses a phrase in Russian where the word for \"dressed\" is a pun on the poet's surname. W. H. Auden spent the last 15 years of his life summering in Kirchstetten, a town near Vienna. He died in Vienna in September 1973 and is buried in the cemetery at Kirchstetten, making the city an important place in his biography.\n\n<<<Auden>>>"
