    "The chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is commonly known as Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is a fluorescent dye with a vibrant red to pink color.\n\nCrayola's official stance is that the specific pigments used in their crayons are proprietary information. Their crayons are primarily made of paraffin wax and colored pigments. While an e-commerce platform lists \"Acid Red 52 (Acid Rhodamine B)\" as a dye suitable for crayons, there is no direct confirmation from Crayola that they use this specific dye in their products.\n\nSome online discussions and novelty products show crayons labeled with chemical names, including a red crayon labeled \"Rhodamine-B\", but these are not official Crayola products.\n\nAlthough Rhodamine B is used to create bright pink and red colors, and Crayola offers many such shades like \"Razzle Dazzle Rose,\" \"Tickle Me Pink,\" and \"Radical Red,\" the exact chemical composition of these crayons is not publicly disclosed. Searches for material safety data sheets (MSDS) for specific Crayola crayon colors did not yield detailed pigment information. Therefore, based on publicly available information, it is not possible to definitively identify a specific Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.\n\n<<<Not available in public information.>>>"
