Both are considered saints in some Christian denominations, with feast days in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.\n*   **Michael:** The archangel who leads God's army against Satan is a prominent figure, especially in the later books of the poem. He is venerated as Saint Michael in the Catholic, Orthodox, and other Christian traditions.\n*   **Gabriel:** This archangel, known for his role as a messenger, is also a character in *Paradise Lost*. He is revered as Saint Gabriel in many Christian churches.\n*   **Raphael:** Milton portrays the archangel Raphael as a divine messenger sent to warn Adam. He is also a venerated saint in Catholic and Orthodox traditions.\n*   **Enoch:** In Book XI of *Paradise Lost*, Milton alludes to \"translated Saints,\" a reference to figures who were taken into Heaven without dying. Enoch is one of these figures, recognized as a saint in Catholic and Orthodox traditions.\n*   **Elijah:** Along with Enoch, Elijah is the other primary example of a \"translated Saint\" mentioned in the poem. He is also considered a saint in both Catholic and Orthodox Christianity.\n\nWhile the poem features a host of other named characters, including fallen angels and personifications of concepts like Sin and Death, these seven are the identifiable historical figures who are also venerated as saints.\n\n<<<7>>>"
