The conditions for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y and H:Z*Y*X→Z to have a FGH-tripled fixed point are typically established within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces. The main conditions are:
1.  **(X, d_X, ⪯_X)**, **(Y, d_Y, ⪯_Y)**, and **(Z, d_Z, ⪯_Z)** are partially ordered complete metric spaces.
2.  The mappings **F, G, and H satisfy a mixed monotone property**.
3.  The mappings **F, G, and H satisfy a contraction-type condition**. For example, there exist k, l, m ∈ [0, 1) with k+l+m < 1 such that d_X(F(x,y,z), F(u,v,w)) ≤ k d_X(x,u) + l d_Y(y,v) + m d_Z(z,w) and analogous inequalities for G and H for all comparable elements.
4.  Either **F, G, and H are continuous**, or the spaces (X, ⪯_X), (Y, ⪯_Y), (Z, ⪯_Z) have a regularity property concerning convergent sequences.
5.  There exist **initial points x₀ ∈ X, y₀ ∈ Y, z₀ ∈ Z** such that x₀ ⪯_X F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ⪰_Y G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ⪯_Z H(z₀, y₀, x₀).
