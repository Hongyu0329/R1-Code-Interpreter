    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a concept in mathematics, specifically in fixed-point theory, that generalizes the notion of a tripled fixed point. For three functions, F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z, a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under specific conditions, which are primarily established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces. These conditions are detailed in theorems that generalize earlier results for tripled fixed points.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\n### **1. Properties of the Spaces**\n\nThe spaces X, Y, and Z must have a certain structure. Typically, it is assumed that:\n*   **(X, d_X, ⪯_X)**, **(Y, d_Y, ⪯_Y)**, and **(Z, d_Z, ⪯_Z)** are partially ordered complete metric spaces. This means that X, Y, and Z are each equipped with a partial order relation (⪯) and a complete metric (d), which measures distance. The completeness ensures that Cauchy sequences (sequences where elements get progressively closer to each other) converge to a point within the space.\n\n### **2. Mixed Monotone Property**\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must exhibit a property known as the mixed monotone property with respect to the partial order on the spaces. This property dictates how the function's output changes as its inputs increase or decrease. Specifically:\n*   **F** has the mixed monotone property if for any x, x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n    *   x₁ ⪯_X x₂ implies F(x₁, y, z) ⪯_X F(x₂, y, z) (non-decreasing in the first argument).\n    *   y₁ ⪯_Y y₂ implies F(x, y₁, z) ⪰_X F(x, y₂, z) (non-increasing in the second argument).\n    *   z₁ ⪯_Z z₂ implies F(x, y, z₁) ⪯_X F(x, y, z₂) (non-decreasing in the third argument).\n*   **G** has the mixed monotone property if for any y, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and x, x₁, x₂ ∈ X:\n    *   y₁ ⪯_Y y₂ implies G(y₁, x, y) ⪯_Y G(y₂, x, y).\n    *   x₁ ⪯_X x₂ implies G(y, x₁, y) ⪰_Y G(y, x₂, y).\n    *   y₁ ⪯_Y y₂ implies G(y, x, y₁) ⪯_Y G(y, x, y₂).\n*   **H** has the mixed monotone property if for any z, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z, y, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and x, x₁, x₂ ∈ X:\n    *   z₁ ⪯_Z z₂ implies H(z₁, y, x) ⪯_Z H(z₂, y, x).\n    *   y₁ ⪯_Y y₂ implies H(z, y₁, x) ⪰_Z H(z, y₂, x).\n    *   x₁ ⪯_X x₂ implies H(z, y, x₁) ⪯_Z H(z, y, x₂).\n\n### **3. Contractive Conditions**\n\nThe core of the conditions lies in the contractive nature of the mappings F, G, and H. These conditions ensure that when the functions are applied repeatedly, the resulting points get closer to each other, eventually converging to a fixed point. A common form of such a condition is:\n\nThere exist constants k, l, m ∈ [0, 1) with k + l + m < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which x ⪰_X u, y ⪯_Y v, and z ⪰_Z w, the following inequalities hold:\n\n*   d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ k * d_X(x, u) + l * d_Y(y, v) + m * d_Z(z, w)\n*   d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ k * d_Y(y, v) + l * d_X(x, u) + m * d_Y(y, v)\n*   d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d_Z(z, w) + l * d_Y(y, v) + m * d_X(x, u)\n\nThese inequalities essentially state that the distance between the images of two points under F, G, and H is smaller than a weighted sum of the distances between the original points, with the sum of the weights being less than 1.\n\n### **4. Initial Point and Continuity**\n\nFinally, there needs to be a starting point and a condition that ensures the fixed point is indeed the limit of the iterative process. This is typically addressed in one of two ways:\n\n*   **Continuity:** The functions F, G, and H are continuous. This is a stronger condition and ensures that if sequences (x_n, y_n, z_n) converge to (x, y, z), then F(x_n, y_n, z_n) converges to F(x, y, z), and similarly for G and H.\n\n*   **Regularity of the Space:** If the functions are not necessarily continuous, a weaker condition on the partially ordered metric space is often used. This condition requires that for any non-decreasing sequence {x_n} that converges to x, we have x_n ⪯ x for all n, and for any non-increasing sequence {y_n} that converges to y, we have y ⪯ y_n for all n.\n\n*   **Existence of an Initial Point:** There exist initial points x₀ ∈ X, y₀ ∈ Y, and z₀ ∈ Z such that:\n    *   x₀ ⪯_X F(x₀, y₀, z₀) and y₀ ⪰_Y G(y₀, x₀, y₀) and z₀ ⪯_Z H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nUnder these sets of conditions, it can be proven that there exist x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, and z ∈ Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. Furthermore, if the partial order on X × Y × Z is such that for any (x, y, z) and (u, v, w), there exists a common point (a, b, c) that is comparable to both, then the FGH-tripled fixed point is unique.\n\n<<<The conditions for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y and H:Z*Y*X→Z to have a FGH-tripled fixed point are typically established within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces. The main conditions are:\n1.  **(X, d_X, ⪯_X)**, **(Y, d_Y, ⪯_Y)**, and **(Z, d_Z, ⪯_Z)** are partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n2.  The mappings **F, G, and H satisfy a mixed monotone property**.\n3.  The mappings **F, G, and H satisfy a contraction-type condition**. For example, there exist k, l, m ∈ [0, 1) with k+l+m < 1 such that d_X(F(x,y,z), F(u,v,w)) ≤ k d_X(x,u) + l d_Y(y,v) + m d_Z(z,w) and analogous inequalities for G and H for all comparable elements.\n4.  Either **F, G, and H are continuous**, or the spaces (X, ⪯_X), (Y, ⪯_Y), (Z, ⪯_Z) have a regularity property concerning convergent sequences.\n5.  There exist **initial points x₀ ∈ X, y₀ ∈ Y, z₀ ∈ Z** such that x₀ ⪯_X F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ⪰_Y G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ⪯_Z H(z₀, y₀, x₀).>>>An FGH-tripled fixed point is a concept in mathematics, specifically in fixed-point theory, that generalizes the notion of a tripled fixed point.
