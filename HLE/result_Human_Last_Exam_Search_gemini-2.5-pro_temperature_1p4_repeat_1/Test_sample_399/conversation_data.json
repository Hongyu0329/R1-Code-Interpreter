    "To solve the initial value problem, we first identify the differential equation and the initial condition.\n\nThe differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = -8$.\n\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can separate the variables by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side.\n$$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt $$\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation.\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nThe integration yields:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to find the value of C. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\nSo, the particular solution to the initial value problem is:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nWe are asked to find the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo simplify the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, we solve for $x(1)$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
