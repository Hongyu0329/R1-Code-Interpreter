    "The predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), measured by the proportion of variance it explains (R²), is capped by the SNP heritability (h²<sub>SNP</sub>). SNP heritability represents the total proportion of phenotypic variance that is attributable to all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) used in the analysis. Therefore, it is the theoretical maximum predictive power a PGS can achieve.\n\nA PGS is constructed using effect sizes estimated from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). These estimates are derived from a finite sample and are therefore subject to statistical error; they are not the \"true\" effect sizes. This inherent imprecision means that when the PGS is applied to a new, independent sample to predict a phenotype, it will invariably explain less variance than the total variance that is theoretically explainable by all SNPs. The predictive power of a PGS will increase as the sample size of the underlying GWAS grows, allowing for more accurate effect size estimations, but its ceiling remains the SNP heritability.\n\nFor example, for ADHD, the SNP heritability is estimated to be 21.6%, whereas the best-performing polygenic scores explain about 5.5% of the variance in the disorder. This gap is common across many traits.\n\nWhile some studies have reported rare instances where the measured R² of a PGS has exceeded the *estimated* SNP heritability, this phenomenon is considered an artifact. It typically arises when the SNP heritability is estimated from a meta-analysis of genetically diverse cohorts, which can lead to a deflated heritability estimate. This does not violate the principle that the true SNP heritability of a population is the upper limit for the predictive power of a PGS within that same population.\n\n<<<True>>>"
