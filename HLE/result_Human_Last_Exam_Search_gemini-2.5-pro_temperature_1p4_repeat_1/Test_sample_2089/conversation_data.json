    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is **\"The Sweet Hereafter\"**.\n\nIn the 1997 film, directed by Atom Egoyan, the character Mitchell Stephens, a lawyer, is attempting to persuade the parents of children who died in a school bus accident to join a class-action lawsuit. In a flashback, we see Stephens' own daughter, who is a drug addict, at a bus station. He gives her money, and as she boards the bus, she turns and says, \"Thank you.\" This is the last time he sees her before she contracts HIV. The memory of this moment, and the single \"thank you,\" haunts him and informs his actions throughout the film, representing his personal loss and the emotional distance between him and his daughter, thus sealing his emotional fate in the narrative.\n\n\"The Sweet Hereafter\" was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Director for Atom Egoyan and Best Adapted Screenplay for Egoyan, based on the novel by Russell Banks.\n\n<<<The Sweet Hereafter>>>"
