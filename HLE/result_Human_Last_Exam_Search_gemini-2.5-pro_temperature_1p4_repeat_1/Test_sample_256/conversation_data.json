    "The symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1.\n\nBased on the comprehensive database of best-known packings of equal circles in a circle, for the case of N=1135, the entry for the symmetry group is not explicitly filled. The key on the same website states that if the symmetry group field is empty, the packing has a symmetry element of C_1. In Schoenflies notation, C_1 represents a group with only the identity element, signifying no rotational or reflectional symmetry.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
