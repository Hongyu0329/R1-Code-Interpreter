    "In ballroom dancing, the technique of each dance is intricately linked to its characteristic music and movement. A reverse turn, a left-turning figure, is a staple in many of the standard ballroom dances. However, in one particular dance, the continuous and rapid rotation makes it practically impossible to overturn a reverse turn without fundamentally violating its technique.\n\nThe dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is the **Viennese Waltz**.\n\nThe reasoning lies in the unique characteristics of the Viennese Waltz. This dance is defined by its fast tempo and continuous, flowing rotational movement around the dance floor. Reverse turns in Viennese Waltz are typically danced along the long sides of the ballroom, traveling in a straight line of dance.\n\nWhen approaching a corner, which requires a 90-degree turn to the left, a couple would need to significantly overturn the reverse turn to navigate it. However, the speed of the Viennese Waltz and the mechanics of the reverse turn make adding this extra rotation extremely difficult without disrupting the rhythm, balance, and fundamental technique of the dance. It is widely taught and practiced that dancers should use natural (right-turning) turns to navigate the corners, as these can be easily under-turned. One source explicitly states that it is \"very difficult to turn the corner while doing a reverse turn, because you have to overturn it quite a bit\" and that, in practice, \"nobody turns the corner in a reverse turn.\" Instead, dancers will execute a change step before the corner to switch from reverse to natural turns.\n\nIn the other dances listed:\n\n*   **English Waltz:** While the Waltz has prescribed amounts of turn, figures can be under- or overturned to alter alignment and for choreographic purposes. There isn't a fundamental technical barrier that makes overturning a reverse turn impossible.\n*   **European Tango:** The Tango's technique is staccato and progressive, and while figures have standard alignments, variations in turn are possible. Overturning a reverse turn can even lead into other figures like a fallaway.\n*   **Slow Foxtrot:** This dance is characterized by its smooth, continuous, and linear movement. However, figures are often modified with under or over-turning to navigate the floor and create different choreographic effects.\n*   **Quickstep:** This dance is dynamic and includes various types of turns and chass√©s. Overturning figures, including reverse-turning actions, is a common practice to link different amalgamations and change direction.\n\nTherefore, due to the high speed and continuous rotation that defines its character, the Viennese Waltz is the dance where attempting to overturn a reverse turn would fundamentally break the established technique.\n\n<<<A>>>"
