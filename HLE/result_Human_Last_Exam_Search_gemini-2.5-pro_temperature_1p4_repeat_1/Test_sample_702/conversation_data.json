    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we need to analyze the homotopy groups of the domain and codomain and the map induced between them.\n\nFirst, let's identify the spaces involved:\n*   $S^n$ is the n-dimensional sphere.\n*   $\\Omega X$ is the loop space of a pointed space $X$. There is a homotopy equivalence $\\pi_i(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(X)$.\n*   $\\Sigma X$ is the reduced suspension of $X$. There is a homotopy equivalence $\\pi_i(\\Sigma X) \\cong \\pi_{i-1}(X)$ within a certain range given by the Freudenthal suspension theorem.\n*   $X \\wedge Y$ is the smash product of two pointed spaces. For spheres, $S^m \\wedge S^n \\simeq S^{m+n}$.\n\nThe map in question is $f: A \\to B$, where:\n*   The domain is $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n*   The codomain is $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$, the codomain is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n\n**Connectivity of the Spaces**\n\nA space is $k$-connected if its homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for all $i \\le k$.\n1.  **Connectivity of $\\Omega S^n$**: Since $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected, its loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2) = 2$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2) = 4$-connected.\n\n2.  **Connectivity of the smash product**: For two connected CW-complexes $X$ and $Y$, the connectivity of their smash product satisfies $\\text{conn}(X \\wedge Y) \\ge \\text{conn}(X) + \\text{conn}(Y) + 1$.\n    *   Let $Z = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$.\n    *   $\\text{conn}(Z) \\ge \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4) + \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^6) + 1 = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7$.\n    *   So, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected.\n\n3.  **Connectivity of the domain A**: The suspension of a $k$-connected space is $(k+1)$-connected.\n    *   $A = \\Sigma Z = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   Since $Z$ is 7-connected, $A$ is 8-connected.\n\n4.  **Connectivity of the codomain B**:\n    *   $B \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   Since $S^{10}$ is 9-connected, its loop space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is 8-connected.\n\n**Connectivity of the Map**\n\nA map $f: A \\to B$ between simply connected spaces is $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$.\n\nSince both the domain $A$ and codomain $B$ are 8-connected, their homotopy groups up to dimension 8 are trivial. Therefore, the map $f_*$ is trivially an isomorphism for $i \\le 8$. This means the map $f$ is at least 8-connected.\n\nTo determine the exact connectivity, we must examine the map on $\\pi_9$ and $\\pi_{10}$.\n\n*   **Analysis of $\\pi_9$**:\n    *   By the Freudenthal suspension theorem, $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, the Hurewicz theorem applies, giving $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   By the Künneth formula for homology, $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   Using the property that $H_k(\\Omega S^n) \\cong H_{k+1}(S^n)$ for $k < 2n-2$, we have $H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\cong H_4(S^4) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong H_6(S^6) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Thus, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   For the codomain, $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe problem states the map is \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers,\" suggesting a natural construction. The most canonical map arises from the adjoint of the smash product of the evaluation maps $ev_4: \\Sigma \\Omega S^4 \\to S^4$ and $ev_6: \\Sigma \\Omega S^6 \\to S^6$. This constructed map has degree 1 on the lowest-dimensional cell approximations. This implies that the induced map $f_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is a homomorphism $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ of degree $\\pm 1$, which is an isomorphism.\n\n*   **Analysis of $\\pi_{10}$**:\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(A) = \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   By the Hurewicz theorem and the Künneth formula (as the relevant homology groups are torsion-free), $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = \\bigoplus_{i+j=9} H_i(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_j(\\Omega S^6)$. All terms in this sum are zero. For instance, the term $H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_6(\\Omega S^6) = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes 0 = 0$, and $H_4(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) = 0 \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\pi_{10}(A) = 0$.\n    *   For the codomain, $\\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$. From the stable homotopy groups of spheres, this is known to be $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe map $f_*$ induces an isomorphism on $\\pi_i$ for $i \\le 9$. However, for $i=10$, the map is $f_*: 0 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This map is not surjective. According to the definition, since the map fails to be surjective on $\\pi_{10}$, the connectivity of the map is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
