    "After a gene duplication event, the resulting two gene copies are initially redundant. This redundancy means that one copy is often lost to mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene, a process known as **pseudogenization**. In fact, this is the most common fate for duplicated genes. However, for both copies to be kept in the genome over evolutionary time, they must diverge in a way that makes each one essential. Two primary models explain this retention and divergence: neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** occurs when one of the gene copies acquires a completely new, beneficial function through mutation, while the other copy continues to perform the original ancestral function. This process is driven by positive selection, but it is considered a relatively rare event because it depends on the chance occurrence of advantageous mutations.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization** proposes that the two gene copies each lose partial function through the accumulation of complementary degenerative mutations. As a result, both genes are then required to perform the full set of functions that the single ancestral gene originally carried out. This \"division of labor\" makes both copies indispensable, ensuring their preservation in the genome. This model, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, is often considered a more common and immediate pathway for retaining duplicate genes because it can occur through neutral or nearly neutral mutations, which are more frequent than beneficial ones. Subfunctionalization can also serve as an intermediate step, preserving duplicate genes for longer periods and increasing the opportunity for one copy to eventually evolve a new function (neofunctionalization).\n\nOf the other options:\n\n*   **Gene conversion** is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between similar sequences. It can either homogenize the two gene copies, counteracting divergence, or spread new mutations between them. It is a mechanism that influences the evolution of duplicates but is not the primary reason for their retention and functional divergence.\n\n*   **Adaptive radiation** is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a lineage rapidly diversifies to fill different ecological niches. Gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, but it is the evolutionary outcome, not the molecular mechanism responsible for retaining a specific pair of duplicated genes.\n\nConsidering that subfunctionalization provides a more common, neutral pathway for preserving both gene copies by making them both essential through partitioning of the original function, it is considered the most likely mechanism among the choices for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
