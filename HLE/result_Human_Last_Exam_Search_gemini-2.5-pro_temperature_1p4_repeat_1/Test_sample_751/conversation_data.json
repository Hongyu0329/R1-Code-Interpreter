    "To reduce the discrete-time system to its observer canonical form using duality, we first consider the dual system and transform it into controller canonical form. The observer canonical form matrices of the original system are then found by transposing the resulting controller canonical form matrices.\n\nThe original system is given by:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\nwith `A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]` and `C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`.\n\n**1. Define the Dual System**\nThe dual system is defined by the pair `(A^T, C^T)`. In the context of a controllable system, these correspond to the state and input matrices, respectively.\n*   `A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n*   `B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n**2. Determine Controllability and Controllability Indices**\nThe principle of duality states that the observability of the pair `(A, C)` is equivalent to the controllability of the pair `(A^T, C^T)`. We determine the controllability by constructing the controllability matrix `W_c = [B_d, A_d B_d, A_d^2 B_d, ...]`. For a multi-input system, the canonical form is not unique and depends on the controllability indices.\n\nThe columns of `B_d` are `b_1 = [0, 1, 0]^T` and `b_2 = [1, 1, 0]^T`.\nWe check for linear independence by selecting vectors from the sequence `b_1, b_2, A_d b_1, A_d b_2, ...`:\n*   `b_1` is linearly independent.\n*   `b_2` is linearly independent from `b_1`.\n*   `A_d b_1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T`. This vector is linearly independent from the plane spanned by `b_1` and `b_2`.\n\nSince we have found 3 linearly independent vectors, the system is controllable. The selection process gives us the controllability indices:\n*   We took two vectors from the chain starting with `b_1` (namely `b_1` and `A_d b_1`). This gives `μ_1 = 2`.\n*   We took one vector from the chain starting with `b_2` (namely `b_2`). This gives `μ_2 = 1`.\n\nThe observability indices of the original system `(A, C)` are dual to these, so `ν_1 = 2` and `ν_2 = 1`.\n\n**3. Find the Transformation Matrix for Controller Canonical Form**\nThe transformation matrix `T_c` is constructed from the linearly independent vectors we found, ordered by their chains:\n`T_c = [b_1, A_d b_1, b_2] = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe inverse of this matrix is:\n`T_c^{-1} = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`\n\n**4. Calculate the Controller Canonical Form Matrices**\nThe new input matrix for the dual system in controller canonical form, `B_cc`, is given by `B_cc = T_c^{-1} B_d`.\n`B_{cc} = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]] = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\n**5. Determine the New C Matrix using Duality**\nThe duality principle states that the matrices of the observer canonical form (`A_o`, `C_o`) are the transposes of the matrices of the controller canonical form (`A_{cc}`, `B_{cc}`).\n`C_o = B_{cc}^T`\n`A_o = A_{cc}^T`\n\nThe question asks for the new matrix `C`.\n`C_o = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]^T = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThis resulting `C_o` is a valid observer canonical form matrix corresponding to observability indices `ν_1=2` and `ν_2=1`.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
