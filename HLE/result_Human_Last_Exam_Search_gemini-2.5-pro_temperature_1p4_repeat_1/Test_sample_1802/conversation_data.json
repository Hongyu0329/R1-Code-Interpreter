    "A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that maps a $d$-dimensional quantum state (qudit) $\\rho$ to another state by applying generalized Pauli operators. Its action can be described as:\n\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=1}^{d^2} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\n\nwhere $\\{U_k\\}_{k=1}^{d^2}$ are the generalized Pauli operators, which form an orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, and $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_k p_k = 1$.\n\nThe complementary channel, denoted as $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the information flow from the quantum system to its environment. If the Kraus operators of the original channel $\\Lambda$ are $\\{A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k\\}$, the complementary channel maps an input state $\\rho$ to a state in the environment space, given by:\n\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho A_j^\\dagger A_i) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(\\rho U_j^\\dagger U_i) $$\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as the dimension of the image of the channel map. To find the maximal rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, we consider the case where all probabilities $p_k$ are non-zero, as this allows for the largest possible set of distinct Kraus operators.\n\nThe input to the channel is the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, which has dimension $d^2$. A basis for this input space is the set of generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_m\\}_{m=1}^{d^2}$ itself. The image of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the vector space spanned by the outputs for each of these basis elements: $\\text{span}\\{\\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_m)\\}_{m=1}^{d^2}$. The rank of the channel is the dimension of this space.\n\nTo find this dimension, we check for the linear independence of the output matrices $\\{\\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_m)\\}$. We set a linear combination of these matrices to zero:\n\n$$ \\sum_{m=1}^{d^2} c_m \\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_m) = 0 $$\n\nwhere $c_m$ are complex coefficients. This implies that for each matrix element $(i,j)$:\n\n$$ \\sum_{m=1}^{d^2} c_m \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(U_m U_j^\\dagger U_i) = 0 $$\n\nAssuming all $p_k > 0$, this simplifies to:\n\n$$ \\text{Tr}\\left(\\left(\\sum_{m=1}^{d^2} c_m U_m\\right) U_j^\\dagger U_i\\right) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } i,j \\in \\{1, \\dots, d^2\\} $$\n\nLet $M = \\sum_m c_m U_m$. The condition becomes $\\text{Tr}(M B) = 0$ for all operators $B$ in the set $\\{U_j^\\dagger U_i\\}_{i,j}$. This set of operators spans the entire space of $d \\times d$ matrices. Because the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product $\\langle M, B \\rangle = \\text{Tr}(M^\\dagger B)$ is non-degenerate, if $M$ is orthogonal to every element of a spanning set, $M$ must be the zero operator.\n\nTherefore, $M = \\sum_m c_m U_m = 0$. Since the Pauli operators $\\{U_m\\}$ form a basis, they are linearly independent, which implies that all coefficients $c_m$ must be zero. This proves that the output matrices $\\{\\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_m)\\}$ are linearly independent.\n\nThe number of these linearly independent output matrices is $d^2$, which means the dimension of the image space of the complementary channel is $d^2$. Consequently, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
