    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the system and find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\nWe are considering the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\nEquilibrium points are the points $(d, u)$ where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFirst, we solve $u'(t)=0$:\n$u^2(u-1) = 0$\nThis gives us $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow we substitute these values into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0$\n    $d = 0$\n    So, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0$\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nIn total, we have three equilibrium points in the region $u \\ge 0$: (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**Step 2: Classify the equilibrium points by linearization**\n\nTo understand the behavior of trajectories near these points, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u)$ of the system.\nLet $F(d, u) = 2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3+u^4$ and $G(d, u) = u^3 - u^2$.\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3+10)0 - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the point **(0, 1) is an unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3+10)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since one eigenvalue is positive and one is negative, the point **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    Linearization fails here. However, for $u>0$ and close to 0, $u' = u^2(u-1) < 0$, which means trajectories approach the line $u=0$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the separatrix**\n\nThe separatrix is a curve (or set of curves) that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. It is formed by the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point(s). In our system, the only saddle point is (-1, 1).\n\n*   **Find the stable manifold of (-1, 1):**\n    The stable manifold corresponds to the negative eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = -2$. We find its eigenvector:\n    $(J(-1,1) - \\lambda_1 I) \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} -2 - (-2) & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 - (-2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_d \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_d \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This implies $v_u=0$. We can choose $v_d=1$. The eigenvector is $\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    This vector is horizontal, indicating the stable manifold is tangent to the line $u=1$ at the point (-1, 1). Let's examine the flow on the line $u=1$. Since $u=1$ means $u'=0$, the line is invariant. The equation for $d$ on this line becomes $d' = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1)$. Trajectories on this line with $d<0$ will approach $d=-1$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n    Therefore, the stable manifold is the ray **u = 1, d < 0**.\n\n*   **Find the unstable manifold of (-1, 1):**\n    The unstable manifold corresponds to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = 1$. We find its eigenvector:\n    $(J(-1,1) - \\lambda_2 I) \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} -2 - 1 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_d \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_d \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This implies $-3v_d - 6v_u = 0$, or $v_d = -2v_u$. We can choose the eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The unstable manifold leaves the saddle point (-1, 1) tangent to this vector. To find the equation of this manifold, we search for an invariant curve of the system, which is a special trajectory. Let's test if a curve of the form $d=f(u)$ is a solution.\n    Let's test the specific curve $d = -u^2$.\n    If $d = -u^2$, then its time derivative is $d' = -2u \\cdot u'$. Substituting the expression for $u'$, we get:\n    $d' = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n    Now let's substitute $d=-u^2$ into the right-hand side of the original equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n    $d' = 2u^4 + (3u^3 - 5u^4) - (u^3 - u^4)$\n    $d' = (2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n    The expressions match. This confirms that the parabola **d = -u^2** is an invariant curve (a trajectory).\n    Let's check if it corresponds to the unstable manifold. The curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$, since for $u=1$, $d=-(1)^2=-1$. The slope of the curve at this point is $dd/du = -2u$, which is $-2$ at $u=1$. The direction of the unstable eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ in the $(u, d)$ plane corresponds to a slope of $\\Delta d / \\Delta u = 2/(-1) = -2$. Since the curve passes through the saddle point and is tangent to the unstable eigenvector, it is the unstable manifold.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results**\n\nThe separatrix of the system is the union of the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (-1, 1).\nThe separatrix is composed of two parts in the $u \\ge 0$ plane:\n1.  The stable manifold: The ray $u=1, d<0$.\n2.  The unstable manifold: The parabola $d=-u^2$ (for $u \\ge 0$).\n\n<<<The separatrix is the union of the curve $d = -u^2$ for $u \\ge 0$ and the ray $u=1$ for $d<0$.>>>"
