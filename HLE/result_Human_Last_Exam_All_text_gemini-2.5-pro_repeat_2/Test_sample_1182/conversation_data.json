    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points on the stable reduction of the curve.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Curve and the Problem**\n\nThe curve is given by the equation:\n$C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve. The question asks for the number of double points (also known as nodes or ordinary double points) on its stable reduction above 2. This means we are working over the field of 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The ring of integers is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nThe genus of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ is given by $g = \\lfloor (\\deg(f)-1)/2 \\rfloor$. Here, the degree of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$ is 5. So, the genus of the curve $C$ is $g = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\n\nThe stable reduction of $C$ is a stable curve over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ (or an extension of it) which is obtained from a regular model of $C$. The arithmetic genus is preserved under reduction, so the arithmetic genus of the stable reduction is also $g=2$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Valuations of the Roots of f(x)**\n\nThe singularities of the stable reduction are determined by how the roots of $f(x)$ cluster together in the 2-adic metric. First, we need to find the 2-adic valuations of these roots. We can do this using the Newton polygon of $f(x)$.\n\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nOne root is clearly $x=0$. Let's call it $\\alpha_1=0$.\nThe other roots are the roots of the polynomial $g(x) = f(x)/x = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\nThe 2-adic valuations of the coefficients of $g(x)$ are:\n$v_2(a_4) = v_2(8) = 3$\n$v_2(a_3) = v_2(4) = 2$\n$v_2(a_2) = v_2(4) = 2$\n$v_2(a_1) = v_2(1) = 0$\n$v_2(a_0) = v_2(8) = 3$\n\nWe plot the points $(i, v_2(a_i))$ for $i=0, \\dots, 4$: $(0,3), (1,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,3)$.\nThe lower convex hull of these points (the Newton polygon) consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(1,0)$ to $(0,3)$. The slope is $(3-0)/(0-1) = -3$. The length of its horizontal projection is $1-0=1$. This indicates that there is **one root** with valuation $v_2(x) = -(\\text{slope}) = 3$. Let's call this root $\\alpha_2$.\n2.  A segment from $(1,0)$ to $(4,3)$. The slope is $(3-0)/(4-1) = 1$. The length of its horizontal projection is $4-1=3$. This indicates there are **three roots** with valuation $v_2(x) = -(\\text{slope}) = -1$. Let's call them $\\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\alpha_5$.\n\nSo, the roots of $f(x)$ have valuations: $v_2(\\alpha_1)=\\infty$ (since $\\alpha_1=0$), $v_2(\\alpha_2)=3$, and $v_2(\\alpha_3)=v_2(\\alpha_4)=v_2(\\alpha_5)=-1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Root Clusters**\n\nThe components of the special fiber of the minimal regular model of the curve correspond to clusters of roots. Two roots $r_i, r_j$ belong to the same cluster if their 2-adic distance is small, specifically if $v_2(r_i - r_j) > 0$.\n\n1.  **Cluster containing $\\alpha_1=0$ and $\\alpha_2$**:\n    $v_2(\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_2) = v_2(0 - \\alpha_2) = v_2(\\alpha_2) = 3$. Since $3 > 0$, $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are in the same cluster. Let's call it $S_1 = \\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\}$.\n\n2.  **Relationship of $S_1$ to other roots**:\n    For $k \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$, $v_2(\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_k) = v_2(-\\alpha_k) = -1 \\le 0$.\n    For $k \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$, $v_2(\\alpha_2 - \\alpha_k) = \\min(v_2(\\alpha_2), v_2(\\alpha_k)) = \\min(3, -1) = -1 \\le 0$.\n    So, the cluster $S_1$ is separate from the roots $\\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\alpha_5$.\n\n3.  **Clustering among $\\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\alpha_5$**:\n    We need to check the valuations of their pairwise differences, $v_2(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j)$ for $i,j \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$.\n    Let's make the substitution $x=z/2$. The roots $\\alpha_i$ with valuation -1 correspond to roots $z_i=2\\alpha_i$ with valuation $v_2(z_i)=v_2(2)+v_2(\\alpha_i) = 1-1=0$. These $z_i$ are 2-adic units.\n    The polynomial for $z$ is obtained by substituting $x=z/2$ into $g(x)=0$ and clearing denominators:\n    $8(z/2)^4 + 4(z/2)^3 + 4(z/2)^2 + z/2 + 8 = 0$\n    $z^4/2 + z^3/2 + z^2 + z/2 + 8 = 0$\n    $P(z) := z^4 + z^3 + 2z^2 + z + 16 = 0$.\n    The three roots of this polynomial with valuation 0 are $z_3, z_4, z_5$. To see if they are distinct modulo 2, we reduce $P(z)$ modulo 2:\n    $\\bar{P}(z) = z^4 + z^3 + z = z(z^3+z^2+1) \\pmod 2$.\n    The roots with valuation 0 must correspond to the non-zero roots of $\\bar{P}(z)$, which are the roots of $z^3+z^2+1=0$. This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ and has three distinct roots in the extension field $\\mathbb{F}_8$.\n    By Hensel's Lemma, since the roots are simple modulo 2 (after factoring out z), the corresponding 2-adic roots $z_3, z_4, z_5$ are distinct, and their pairwise differences are 2-adic units. That is, $v_2(z_i - z_j) = 0$ for $i,j \\in \\{3,4,5\\}, i \\neq j$.\n    Now we find the valuation of the differences of the original roots:\n    $v_2(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j) = v_2(\\frac{z_i}{2} - \\frac{z_j}{2}) = v_2(\\frac{z_i - z_j}{2}) = v_2(z_i - z_j) - v_2(2) = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $v_2(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j) = -1 \\le 0$, the roots $\\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\alpha_5$ are not in the same cluster. Each forms a cluster of its own: $S_2=\\{\\alpha_3\\}, S_3=\\{\\alpha_4\\}, S_4=\\{\\alpha_5\\}$.\n\nSo, we have a total of **N=4** root clusters. This means the special fiber of the minimal regular model of $C$ has 4 irreducible components.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Genus of Each Component**\n\nThe genus $g_S$ of the component corresponding to a cluster $S$ is given by the genus of the curve $y^2=\\prod_{r \\in S}(x-r)$.\n-   For $S_1 = \\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\}$, $|S_1|=2$. The curve is $y^2=(x-\\alpha_1)(x-\\alpha_2)$, which has genus 0.\n-   For $S_2, S_3, S_4$, each has size 1. The curve is $y^2=x-r$, which has genus 0.\nSo, all 4 components are rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Number of Double Points**\n\nThe stable reduction is a connected curve of arithmetic genus $p_a=g=2$. It is composed of $N=4$ rational components ($g_i=0$). The number of double points (nodes), $\\delta$, is related to these quantities by the formula for the arithmetic genus of a nodal curve:\n$p_a = \\sum_{i=1}^N g_i + \\delta - N + 1$\nPlugging in the values we found:\n$2 = \\sum_{i=1}^4 (0) + \\delta - 4 + 1$\n$2 = 0 + \\delta - 3$\n$\\delta = 5$\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has 5 double points."
