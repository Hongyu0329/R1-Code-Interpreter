    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\)\". In the context of the Markov spectrum and Diophantine approximation, this refers to a specific quadratic irrational number whose continued fraction is constructed from the partial quotients of the rational number \\( p/q \\). This construction is a fundamental part of the theory.\n\n**2. The General Procedure**\n\nThe procedure to find the continued fraction associated with \\( m_{p/q} \\) is as follows:\na.  First, find the simple continued fraction of the rational number \\( p/q \\). Since \\( 0 < p/q < 1 \\), it will be of the form \\( [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n] \\).\nb.  Identify the sequence of partial quotients \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\).\nc.  Construct a new sequence by concatenating the sequence from step (b) with its reverse, \\( (a_n, \\dots, a_2, a_1) \\). This gives the palindromic sequence \\( (a_1, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_1) \\).\nd.  The continued fraction associated with \\( m_{p/q} \\) is the purely periodic continued fraction whose repeating block is the sequence constructed in step (c).\n\n**3. Applying the Procedure to \\( m_{4/7} \\)**\n\n**Step 3a: Compute the continued fraction of 4/7.**\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the partial quotients:\n*   Start with the fraction \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\). Its reciprocal is \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\).\n*   \\( \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} \\). The first partial quotient is \\( a_1 = 1 \\).\n*   Take the remainder \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\). Its reciprocal is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\).\n*   \\( \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\). The second partial quotient is \\( a_2 = 1 \\).\n*   Take the remainder \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\). Its reciprocal is \\( 3 \\).\n*   \\( 3 = 3 + 0 \\). The third partial quotient is \\( a_3 = 3 \\).\nThe algorithm terminates. So, the continued fraction for \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to perform the Euclidean algorithm correctly to get the right sequence of partial quotients. Let's double-check:\n\\( [0; 1, 1, 3] = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{4/3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{7/4} = \\frac{4}{7} \\). The calculation is correct.\n\n**Step 3b: Identify the sequence of partial quotients.**\nFrom the previous step, the sequence of partial quotients for \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n\n**Step 3c: Construct the new periodic block.**\n*   The original sequence is \\( (1, 1, 3) \\).\n*   The reverse of this sequence is \\( (3, 1, 1) \\).\n*   We concatenate them to form the new periodic block: \\( (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\).\n\n**Careful Point:** The construction requires concatenating the sequence with its reverse. It is not simply repeating the original sequence. The resulting sequence must be a palindrome. For \\((1, 1, 3)\\), the result is \\((1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)\\), which is indeed a palindrome.\n\n**Step 3d: Write the final continued fraction.**\nThe continued fraction associated with \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the purely periodic continued fraction with the repeating block we just found. In standard notation, this is written as:\n\\( [\\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}] \\)\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the representation of this purely periodic continued fraction.\n\n<<<[\\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]>>>"
