The set of possible values for the ratio $\text{Vol}(P)/V$ depends on the dimension $d$:
- For $d=1$, the set is $\{1\}$.
- For $d=2$, the set is $\{2\}$.
- For $d \ge 3$, the set is the interval $(2^d/d!, d!]$.
The question asks for the set of possible values for the volume of $P$. Since the volume of the simplex $V$ can be any positive real number, the set of possible values for $\text{Vol}(P)$ is the set of all positive real numbers, $\mathbb{R}^+$, for any $d \ge 1$. This is because for any target volume $v^* > 0$, we can choose a simplex $T$ with the appropriate volume $V$ such that $k \cdot V = v^*$ for some $k$ in the ratio set.
However, it is highly likely that the question is asking for the set of possible values for the dimensionless ratio $\text{Vol}(P)/V$. Assuming this interpretation, the answer is the set of possible ratios.
