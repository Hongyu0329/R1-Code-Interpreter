    "This is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem asks us to calculate the final value of a variable `x`, initially 0, after executing a series of `n` statements. There are four possible statements:\n1.  `++X`: Increment `x` by 1.\n2.  `X++`: Increment `x` by 1.\n3.  `--X`: Decrement `x` by 1.\n4.  `X--`: Decrement `x` by 1.\n\nThe program needs to read `n`, then loop `n` times, processing one statement in each iteration, and finally print the final value of `x`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Submitted Java Program\nThe Java program's core logic is:\n```java\nString test = inpt.next();\n\nif (test.contains(\"++X\"))\n{\n    tresult++;\n}\nif (test.contains(\"--X\"))\n{\n    tresult--;\n}\n```\nLet's test this logic against all possible inputs:\n*   If `test` is `\"++X\"`, `test.contains(\"++X\")` is true. `tresult` is incremented. Correct.\n*   If `test` is `\"--X\"`, `test.contains(\"--X\")` is true. `tresult` is decremented. Correct.\n*   If `test` is `\"X++\"`, `test.contains(\"++X\")` is false. `test.contains(\"--X\")` is also false. `tresult` is unchanged. **Incorrect**.\n*   If `test` is `\"X--\"`, `test.contains(\"++X\")` is false. `test.contains(\"--X\")` is also false. `tresult` is unchanged. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided program is incorrect because it fails to handle the post-increment (`X++`) and post-decrement (`X--`) statements. Therefore, the answer must start with 'N'.\n\n### Step 3: Designing an Efficient C Solution\nThe problem asks for a rewrite in C that is \"fastest and least memory\".\n\n**Careful Points for Efficiency:**\n1.  **Operation Identification (Speed):** Instead of comparing the whole string, we can find a unique feature. Notice that for all four statement types (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`), the character at the middle position (index 1) is always `+` for an increment and `-` for a decrement. Checking just this single character is the fastest way to determine the operation. This requires only one character comparison per statement.\n2.  **Data Types (Memory):** The problem states `n` is at most 150. The final value of `x` will therefore be in the range [-150, 150]. The C data type `short` (typically 2 bytes) is sufficient to store both `n` and `x`, using less memory than a standard `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n3.  **Input Reading (Memory):** To read the input statement, we could use `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` which requires a character array (e.g., `char s[4];`, 4 bytes). A more memory-frugal approach is to read characters one by one using `getchar()` and discard the ones we don't need. This avoids allocating a character array entirely.\n\n**Most Efficient C Implementation (Conceptual):**\nA C program that embodies these principles would:\n1.  Declare `n` and `x` as `short`.\n2.  Read `n`.\n3.  Loop `n` times.\n4.  In each loop, use a method like `getchar()` to read the input characters. We only need to check the second character of each line. If it's `+`, we increment `x`; otherwise, we decrement `x`.\n5.  Print the final value of `x`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating 'x' and 'y'\nThe final answer requires `x` (smallest number of character comparisons for `n=100`) and `y` (smallest memory size in Bytes).\n\n*   **Calculating `x` (Comparisons):**\n    The most efficient logic checks only the middle character of the statement. This is a single comparison per statement (e.g., `if (middle_char == '+')`). For 100 statements, this results in:\n    `1 comparison/statement * 100 statements = 100 comparisons`.\n    This is the minimum possible, as at least one character must be inspected.\n    **`x = 100`**\n\n*   **Calculating `y` (Memory):**\n    The most memory-efficient C implementation only needs to store the counter for `n` and the value of `x`. Using the smallest appropriate data type (`short`) for both:\n    - Memory for `n`: `sizeof(short)` = 2 Bytes\n    - Memory for `x`: `sizeof(short)` = 2 Bytes\n    This implementation avoids any explicit character buffers on the stack.\n    Total minimum memory size = `2 + 2 = 4` Bytes.\n    **`y = 4`**\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Formulation\nThe required format is `Nx+y`.\n- The program is incorrect: **N**\n- Smallest comparisons `x`: **100**\n- Smallest memory `y`: **4**\n\nCombining these parts gives the final answer.\n\n<<<N100+4>>>"
