    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific person whose *lectures* were cited by Albert Einstein in a specific scientific paper: his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n*   **Who:** Albert Einstein\n*   **What:** Cited lectures\n*   **Where:** In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n**Step 2: Pinpoint the specific scientific paper.**\nIn 1905, his \"miracle year,\" Einstein published several groundbreaking papers. The one on Brownian motion is titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the nature of citations in Einstein's 1905 papers.**\nA key point to be careful about is that Einstein's 1905 papers are famous for their near-total lack of citations to other scientists' work. He tended to build his arguments from first principles. This makes any citation that *does* exist particularly significant and specific.\n\n**Step 4: Search for citations within the Brownian motion paper.**\nDespite the general lack of references, a close reading of the paper reveals a footnote. The question's use of the word \"lectures\" is a crucial clue. It suggests we are not looking for a citation to a regular journal article, but to a published work that is a collection of lectures.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the cited work and its author.**\nIn Section 2 of the paper, titled \"On the Osmotic Pressure from the Standpoint of the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Einstein makes a point about the kinetic theory of gases. To support this, he includes a footnote. This footnote cites:\n*   **The Work:** *Vorlesungen über Gastheorie* (which translates to *Lectures on Gas Theory*).\n*   **The Author:** Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n**Step 6: Formulate the final answer.**\nThe work cited by Einstein is a book titled *Lectures on Gas Theory*. The author of these lectures was the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, a foundational figure in statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of heat, upon which Einstein built his own analysis. Therefore, Einstein cited the lectures of Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
