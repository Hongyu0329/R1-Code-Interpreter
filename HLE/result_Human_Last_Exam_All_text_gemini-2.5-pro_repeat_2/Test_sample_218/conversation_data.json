    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition of $n$. A partition of a positive integer $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ such that their sum is $n$. For this problem, $n=25$.\n\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{ij}}$\nwhere the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the box $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of boxes to the right of the box in the same row, plus the number of boxes below it in the same column, plus the box itself.\n\nWe need to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 such that $d_\\lambda < 500,000$.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is small when the hook lengths are large. Large hook lengths occur in partitions with very long first rows or very long first columns (these partitions are often called \"hook partitions\" or \"partitions with a large hook\"). These are partitions of the form $(n-k, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of a small integer $k$.\n\nWe can systematically search for such partitions. Note that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate $\\lambda'$ (obtained by transposing its Young diagram) have the same dimension, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. We will list the qualifying partitions and then account for their conjugates.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Partitions with $k=0$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: This corresponds to the trivial representation. The hooks are $25, 24, \\dots, 1$.\n        $d_{(25)} = \\frac{25!}{25!} = 1$. This is < 500,000.\n    *   The conjugate is $\\lambda' = (1^{25})$, the sign representation, with $d_{(1^{25})} = 1$.\n    *   This gives us 2 irreps.\n\n2.  **Partitions with $k=1$:** Here, we remove one box from the first row and add it as a new row.\n    *   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$: This corresponds to the standard representation. A known formula is $d_{(n-1,1)} = n-1$.\n        $d_{(24,1)} = 25 - 1 = 24$. This is < 500,000.\n    *   The conjugate is $\\lambda' = (2, 1^{23})$, with $d_{(2, 1^{23})} = 24$.\n    *   This gives us 2 irreps.\n\n3.  **Partitions with $k=2$:** The partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 22}{2} = 275$. (< 500,000)\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1, 1)$: A known formula is $d_{(n-2, 1^2)} = \\binom{n-1}{2}$.\n        $d_{(23, 1, 1)} = \\binom{24}{2} = \\frac{24 \\cdot 23}{2} = 276$. (< 500,000)\n    *   These two partitions and their conjugates give us 4 irreps.\n\n4.  **Partitions with $k=3$:** The partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = 2,000$. (< 500,000)\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4,025$. (< 500,000)\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 1, 1, 1)$: $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2,024$. (< 500,000)\n    *   These three partitions and their conjugates give us 6 irreps.\n\n5.  **Partitions with $k=4$:** The partitions of 4 are (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 4)$: $d=10,350$. (< 500,000)\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 3, 1)$: $d=31,350$. (< 500,000)\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 2)$: $d=10,500$. (< 500,000)\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 1, 1)$: $d=31,625$. (< 500,000)\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 1^4)$: $d=\\binom{24}{4} = 10,626$. (< 500,000)\n    *   These five partitions and their conjugates give us 10 irreps.\n\n6.  **Partitions with $k=5$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 5)$: $d=40,480$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 4, 1)$: $d=122,775$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 2)$: $d=138,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 1, 1)$: $d=166,320$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 2, 1)$: $d=176,475$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 1^5)$: $d=\\binom{24}{5} = 42,504$.\n    *   All are < 500,000. Checking other partitions of 5 like $(20, 2, 1^3)$ reveals their dimensions are over 500,000.\n    *   These six partitions and their conjugates give us 12 irreps.\n\n7.  **Partitions with $k=6$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 1^6)$: $d=\\binom{24}{6} = 134,596$. (< 500,000)\n    *   Calculations show that for any other partition $\\mu$ of 6, $d_{(19, \\mu)}$ is greater than 500,000. For example, $d_{(19,6)} \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^6$.\n    *   This gives 1 partition and its conjugate, for a total of 2 irreps.\n\n8.  **Partitions with $k=7$:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 1^7)$: $d=\\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. (< 500,000)\n    *   As with $k=6$, any other partition $\\mu$ of 7 results in $d_{(18, \\mu)} > 500,000$.\n    *   This gives 1 partition and its conjugate, for a total of 2 irreps.\n\n9.  **Partitions with $k \\ge 8$:**\n    *   For $\\lambda = (17, 1^8)$, the dimension is $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471$, which is greater than 500,000.\n    *   Dimensions will continue to grow for larger $k$. Partitions that are more \"central\" (less like a single long hook) have much smaller products of hook lengths and thus vastly larger dimensions. For example, $d_{(13,12)} = 742,900$. Therefore, we do not expect to find any other qualifying irreps.\n\n**Final Count:**\nWe sum the number of irreps found:\n*   $k=0$: 2\n*   $k=1$: 2\n*   $k=2$: 4\n*   $k=3$: 6\n*   $k=4$: 10\n*   $k=5$: 12\n*   $k=6$: 2\n*   $k=7$: 2\n\nTotal number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 12 + 2 + 2 = 40$.\n\nNone of the listed partitions are self-conjugate (where $\\lambda = \\lambda'$), so we correctly counted each distinct irrep and its conjugate's irrep (which has the same dimension)."
