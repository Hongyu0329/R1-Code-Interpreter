    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Group**\n\nThe group in question is the semidihedral group of size 512. The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n$SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$ for $n \\ge 3$.\n\nIn this case, the order is $512 = 2^9$. So, we have $n=9$. The group is $G = SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$.\nThe presentation is:\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{9-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{9-2}-1} \\rangle$\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$\n\nThe group $G$ consists of $2^9 = 512$ elements, which can be divided into two sets:\n1.  The cyclic subgroup of index 2: $C = \\langle r \\rangle = \\{r^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$, which is isomorphic to $C_{256}$.\n2.  The coset $sC = s\\langle r \\rangle = \\{sr^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Define Power Subgroup**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a **power subgroup** if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. That is, $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\nWe need to find the number of distinct sets $G^k$ as $k$ ranges over all integers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Powers of Elements in G**\n\nWe need to compute $g^k$ for every $g \\in G$.\n-   For elements in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$, the power is straightforward: $(r^i)^k = r^{ik}$.\n-   For elements in the coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$, we first compute the square of an element $sr^i$:\n    A key relation is $sr^is = r^{i(2^{n-2}-1)}$. For our group with $n=9$, this is $sr^is = r^{127i}$.\n    $(sr^i)^2 = (sr^i)(sr^i) = s(r^i s)r^i = (sr^is)r^i = r^{127i}r^i = r^{128i} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}}$.\n    This result is crucial. The square of any element from the coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$ lands in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Structure of $G^k$ based on the parity of k**\n\nWe consider two cases for the integer $k$.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is odd**\nLet $k = 2m+1$ for some integer $m$.\n-   The set of $k$-th powers of elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$ is $\\{ (r^i)^k \\mid i \\} = \\langle r^k \\rangle$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 256) = 1$. In a cyclic group $C_{256}$, raising elements to a power coprime to the order is a permutation. Thus, $\\langle r^k \\rangle = \\langle r \\rangle$.\n-   The set of $k$-th powers of elements in $s\\langle r \\rangle$ is $\\{ (sr^i)^k \\mid i \\}$.\n    $(sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^{2m+1} = ((sr^i)^2)^m (sr^i) = (r^{128i})^m (sr^i) = r^{128im}sr^i$.\n    The set $\\{r^{128im}sr^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$ can be shown to be equal to the entire coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$. The mapping from $sr^j$ to $(sr^j)^k$ is a permutation of the coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$.\nTherefore, when $k$ is odd, $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\langle r \\rangle \\cup s\\langle r \\rangle = G$.\nThis gives us one power subgroup: the group $G$ itself.\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is even**\nLet $k = 2m$ for some integer $m$.\n-   For an element $g = r^i \\in \\langle r \\rangle$, its $k$-th power is $g^k = (r^i)^k = r^{ik} \\in \\langle r \\rangle$.\n-   For an element $g = sr^i \\in s\\langle r \\rangle$, its $k$-th power is $g^k = (sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^{2m} = ((sr^i)^2)^m = (r^{128i})^m = r^{128im} \\in \\langle r \\rangle$.\nIn this case, the $k$-th power of any element in $G$ is an element of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$. Thus, $G^k$ is a subgroup of $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\nLet's find exactly which subgroup it is.\n$G^k = \\{ (r^i)^k \\mid i \\} \\cup \\{ (sr^i)^k \\mid i \\} = \\langle r^k \\rangle \\cup \\langle r^{128m} \\rangle$.\nSince $k=2m$, we have $128m = 64(2m) = 64k$.\nSo, $G^k = \\langle r^k \\rangle \\cup \\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$.\nThe union of two subgroups is a subgroup if and only if one is contained in the other. Here, $\\langle r^{64k} \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $\\langle r^k \\rangle$ because $k$ divides $64k$.\nThus, $G^k = \\langle r^k \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Number of Distinct Power Subgroups for Even $k$**\n\nFor any even integer $k$, the power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle r^k \\rangle$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of this form.\nThe subgroup $\\langle r^k \\rangle$ of the cyclic group $\\langle r \\rangle \\cong C_{256}$ is the same as the subgroup $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\nSince $k$ is even, $k=2m$, so $\\gcd(k, 256)$ must be an even number. The divisors of $256 = 2^8$ are $2^0, 2^1, \\dots, 2^8$. The even divisors are $2^1, 2^2, \\dots, 2^8$.\nSo, the possible subgroups we can form are $\\langle r^d \\rangle$ where $d \\in \\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\\}$.\nCan we generate each of these? Yes, for any such divisor $d=2^j$ (where $j \\in \\{1, ..., 8\\}$), we can simply choose $k=d$. Since $j \\ge 1$, $k$ is even, and $G^k = G^d = \\langle r^d \\rangle$.\nThis gives the following distinct subgroups:\n1.  $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$\n2.  $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$\n3.  $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$\n4.  $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$\n5.  $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$\n6.  $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$\n7.  $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$\n8.  $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n\nThere are 8 distinct power subgroups that arise from even values of $k$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Count**\n\nThe set of all power subgroups of $G = SD_{512}$ is the union of the subgroups found in both cases:\n-   From odd $k$: $G$ (1 subgroup)\n-   From even $k$: $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle$ (8 subgroups)\n\nThese two sets of subgroups are disjoint, as $G$ is not a subgroup of $\\langle r \\rangle$.\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is $1 + 8 = 9$.\n\nIn general, for the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$, the number of power subgroups is $n$. For $SD_{512}$, we have $n=9$, so there are 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
