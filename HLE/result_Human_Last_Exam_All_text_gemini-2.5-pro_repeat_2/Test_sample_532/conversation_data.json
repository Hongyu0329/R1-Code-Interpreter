    "Answering this question requires a careful step-by-step analysis of the definitions provided.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n1.  **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n2.  **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written concisely as `S^2 ∩ S = ∅`, where `S^2 = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`.\n3.  **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal (or maximum by inclusion) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. In other words, for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n4.  **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is called a filled group if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to `G`.\n5.  **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if it satisfies any of several equivalent conditions. The most useful one for characterization is that `G` is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. All finite abelian groups and all finite p-groups are nilpotent.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the \"Filled Group\" Condition**\n\nThe definition of a filled group states that `G = ⋃ S_i`, where the `S_i` are all the maximal product-free sets in `G`.\n\nLet's consider the identity element `e` of `G`. Can `e` be in a product-free set `S`?\nIf `S` is a non-empty product-free set, let `s` be any element in `S`. If `e` were also in `S`, then the product `se = s` would be an element of `S^2`. Since `s` is also in `S`, this would mean `S^2 ∩ S` is not empty, which contradicts the definition of a product-free set. Therefore, the identity element `e` cannot belong to any non-empty product-free set.\n\nIf `|G| > 1`, its maximal product-free sets must be non-empty. (If the empty set were a maximal product-free set, then for any `g ∈ G`, `{g}` would not be product-free, implying `g^2=g` and thus `g=e`, so `G` would be the trivial group).\n\nThis means that for any group `G` with `|G| > 1`, the identity element `e` is never in any maximal product-free set. Consequently, the union of all maximal product-free sets is a subset of `G \\ {e}`. So, strictly speaking, no group of order greater than 1 can be a filled group under this literal definition.\n\nThis is a known issue in the literature on this topic. To make the definition meaningful, it is standard to adopt a slightly modified definition:\n**A finite group `G` is called a filled group if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is `G \\ {e}`.**\nThis means that every non-identity element of `G` must belong to at least one maximal product-free set. Let's analyze the problem with this standard convention.\n\n**Step 3: A Critical Argument**\n\nLet's determine which elements of `G` can belong to a product-free set.\nLet `g` be an arbitrary element in `G \\ {e}`.\nConsider the singleton set `S_0 = {g}`.\nTo be product-free, we must have `S_0^2 ∩ S_0 = ∅`.\nHere, `S_0^2 = {g * g} = {g^2}`.\nThe condition becomes `{g^2} ∩ {g} = ∅`, which means `g^2 ≠ g`.\nIn any group, `g^2 = g` implies `g = e`. Since we chose `g ∈ G \\ {e}`, it is guaranteed that `g^2 ≠ g`.\nTherefore, for any non-identity element `g`, the set `{g}` is a product-free set.\n\nNow, consider any product-free set `S` in a finite group `G`. If `S` is not maximal, then by definition there exists a larger product-free set `S'` that properly contains `S`. Since `G` is finite, we can repeat this extension process only a finite number of times. This guarantees that any product-free set `S` is contained within some maximal product-free set `S_max`.\n\nCombining these two points:\n1.  For any `g ∈ G \\ {e}`, the set `{g}` is product-free.\n2.  The set `{g}` can be extended to a maximal product-free set `S_max`.\nThis means `g ∈ S_max`.\n\nSince `g` was an arbitrary non-identity element, this argument implies that **every** non-identity element of **any** finite group `G` belongs to at least one maximal product-free set.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion of the Analysis**\n\nBased on the argument in Step 3, the union of all maximal product-free sets in any finite group `G` is always `G \\ {e}`. This means that, according to the standard convention, **every finite group is a filled group.**\n\nThis result contradicts claims in some research literature, but the fundamental proof outlined above is straightforward and appears solid. Assuming this proof is correct, the property of being \"filled\" is a trivial one that applies to all finite groups.\n\nTherefore, the question \"What are the finite filled nilpotent groups?\" is logically equivalent to the question \"What are the finite nilpotent groups?\".\n\n**Step 5: Characterization of Finite Nilpotent Groups**\n\nThe structure of finite nilpotent groups is well-understood in group theory. The fundamental theorem for finite nilpotent groups states:\n\nA finite group `G` is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n\nThat is, if `|G| = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} ... p_k^{a_k}` is the prime factorization of the order of `G`, and `P_i` is the (unique) Sylow `p_i`-subgroup of `G`, then `G` is nilpotent if and only if `G ≅ P_1 × P_2 × ... × P_k`.\n\nThis provides the complete characterization of the groups requested.\n\n<<<All finite nilpotent groups. A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.>>>"
