    "This problem requires us to calculate the probability of a specific edge being chosen in a single step of a gossiping algorithm on a particular graph. We will break down the problem into understanding the graph's structure, the gossiping process, and then combining these to calculate the desired probability.\n\n### Analysis of the Question Step-by-Step\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph: Barbell Graph with 10 Nodes**\n    *   A standard barbell graph is constructed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge.\n    *   Since there are 10 nodes in total, the graph must consist of two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (two $K_5$ cliques).\n    *   The \"bottleneck edge\" is the single edge that connects one node from the first $K_5$ to one node from the second $K_5$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Process: Randomized Uniform Gossiping**\n    *   This is a process for spreading information in a network. A single step, which involves \"sampling\" an edge, is typically modeled as follows:\n        a. A starting node `u` is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all nodes in the graph.\n        b. The chosen node `u` then selects one of its neighbors `v` uniformly at random.\n    *   The edge `(u, v)` is the one that is \"sampled\" in this step.\n    *   The term \"uniform weights\" confirms that when a node chooses a neighbor, each neighbor has an equal probability of being chosen.\n\n3.  **Identify the Goal: Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**\n    *   We need to find the probability that the edge sampled by the process described above is the specific bottleneck edge connecting the two cliques.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Graph Configuration:** The interpretation of the \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" as two $K_5$ cliques connected by a single edge is standard, but critical. Any other configuration would change the result.\n2.  **Node Degrees are Not Uniform:** The nodes in this graph are not all the same. We must distinguish between the two nodes that are endpoints of the bottleneck edge (let's call them \"bridge nodes\") and the remaining eight nodes (\"internal nodes\"). Their degrees (number of connections) will differ, which is crucial for the probability calculation.\n3.  **Sampling Model:** The specified process is node-centric (pick a node, then a neighbor). This is different from picking an edge uniformly from all edges in the graph. The probability of sampling an edge $(u,v)$ depends on the degrees of both $u$ and $v$.\n4.  **Identifying Favorable Events:** The bottleneck edge can only be sampled if the gossiping process starts at one of its two endpoints. If the process starts at any other node, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in that step is zero.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Characterize the Nodes and Their Degrees**\n*   The graph has $N=10$ nodes.\n*   Let's label the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge as $u_b$ and $v_b$. These are the \"bridge nodes\".\n*   The other 8 nodes are \"internal nodes\".\n*   **Degree of an internal node:** An internal node lies within a $K_5$ and is not a bridge node. It is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique. Thus, its degree is **4**.\n*   **Degree of a bridge node:** A bridge node (e.g., $u_b$) is connected to the other 4 nodes in its own $K_5$ clique, plus it has one additional connection via the bottleneck edge to the other bridge node ($v_b$). Thus, its degree is $4 + 1 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Sampling Process and Event**\n*   The process is to pick a starting node `u` with probability $1/N = 1/10$, and then `u` picks a neighbor `v` with probability $1/\\text{deg}(u)$.\n*   The event we are interested in is \"the sampled edge is the bottleneck edge $(u_b, v_b)$\".\n*   This event occurs if:\n    *   (Case A) The starting node is $u_b$, and it chooses to gossip to $v_b$.\n    *   OR\n    *   (Case B) The starting node is $v_b$, and it chooses to gossip to $u_b$.\n*   These two cases are mutually exclusive.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Probability**\n*   **Probability of Case A:**\n    *   The probability of choosing $u_b$ as the starting node is $1/10$.\n    *   Given that $u_b$ is chosen, the probability of it choosing $v_b$ is $1/\\text{deg}(u_b) = 1/5$.\n    *   $P(\\text{Case A}) = P(\\text{start at } u_b) \\times P(u_b \\text{ chooses } v_b) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n*   **Probability of Case B:**\n    *   The probability of choosing $v_b$ as the starting node is $1/10$.\n    *   Given that $v_b$ is chosen, the probability of it choosing $u_b$ is $1/\\text{deg}(v_b) = 1/5$.\n    *   $P(\\text{Case B}) = P(\\text{start at } v_b) \\times P(v_b \\text{ chooses } u_b) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    *   The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of the two cases.\n    *   $P(\\text{sampling bottleneck edge}) = P(\\text{Case A}) + P(\\text{Case B}) = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}$.\n\nThe final probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is $1/25$.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
