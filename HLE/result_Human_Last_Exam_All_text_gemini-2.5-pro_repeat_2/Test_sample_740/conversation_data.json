    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the integral equation and its kernel.**\nThe given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy`\nwhere the kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\n**Step 2: Expand the kernel.**\nThe kernel `K(x, y)` can be expanded as a sum of a finite geometric series:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`\nThis is a separable (or degenerate) kernel, as it is a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and functions of `y`.\n\n**Step 3: Reduce the integral equation to a system of linear equations.**\nSubstitute the expanded kernel back into the equation:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k) u(y) dy`\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\nLet's define the constants `c_k` as the moments of `u(y)`:\n`c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\nThe solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)`\nNow, we create a system of equations for the unknown constants `c_j` by substituting this form of `u(y)` back into their definition:\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)) dy`\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j + n - 1 - k) dy`\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j + n - k)`\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknowns `c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1)`. We can write it in matrix form as:\n`C = B + λ A C  =>  (I - λA)C = B`\nwhere:\n*   `C` is the column vector `[c_0, ..., c_(n-1)]ᵀ`.\n*   `B` is the column vector `[1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`.\n*   `A` is the `n x n` matrix with elements `A_jk = 1 / (n + j - k)` (where `j` is the row index and `k` is the column index, both from `0` to `n-1`).\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Fredholm Alternative Theorem.**\nThe linear system `(I - λA)C = B` has a unique solution if the matrix `(I - λA)` is invertible, i.e., `det(I - λA) ≠ 0`.\nIf `det(I - λA) = 0`, the equation may have no solution or infinitely many solutions. This condition is equivalent to `det(A - (1/λ)I) = 0`, which means `μ = 1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. The corresponding values of `λ` are called the characteristic values of the integral equation.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, for a characteristic value `λ`, the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the right-hand side `f(x) = 1` is orthogonal to all solutions of the corresponding homogeneous adjoint equation.\nThe homogeneous adjoint equation is `v(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(y, x) v(y) dy`.\nThe condition for having a solution is `∫₀¹ 1 * v(x) dx = 0` for all such eigenfunctions `v(x)`.\nIf `∫₀¹ v(x) dx ≠ 0` for at least one eigenfunction `v(x)`, then the equation has no solution for that value of `λ`.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the eigenfunctions of the adjoint equation.**\nThe kernel of the adjoint equation is `K(y, x) = (yⁿ - xⁿ) / (y - x) = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) y^(n-1-k) x^k`.\nThe eigenfunctions `v(x)` are polynomials of degree at most `n-1`. The problem of finding the characteristic values `λ` is equivalent to finding the eigenvalues `μ = 1/λ` of the matrix `G` associated with the adjoint operator, where `G = Aᵀ`.\nThe matrix `G` has elements `G_jk = 1/(n-j+k)`. (Here `j` is row, `k` is col).\nThe analysis shows that the solvability condition `∫v(x)dx=0` is equivalent to checking if an eigenvector of `G` is orthogonal to a specific vector.\n\n**Step 6: Determine if the solvability condition can be met.**\nLet `v(x)` be an eigenfunction of the adjoint operator for a characteristic value `λ`.\n`v(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(y,x)v(y)dy = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^k ∫₀¹ y^(n-1-k)v(y)dy`.\nIf we assume `∫₀¹ v(x)dx = 0`, then the highest moment `∫y⁰v(y)dy` is zero.\n`v(x)` is a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. Let's check the highest degree term of the right side of the eigen-equation. The term `x^{n-1}` comes from `k=n-1`, its coefficient is `λ ∫₀¹ y⁰ v(y) dy = λ ∫₀¹ v(y) dy`.\nIf `∫₀¹ v(y) dy = 0`, the `x^{n-1}` term vanishes. This means that the eigenfunction `v(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-2`.\nSo, if an eigenfunction `v(x)` satisfies `∫₀¹ v(x)dx = 0`, it must be a polynomial of degree `≤ n-2`.\n\nThis implies that the operator `L*v(x) = ∫K(y,x)v(y)dy` must have an eigenfunction in the space of polynomials of degree at most `n-2`. This, in turn, implies that the matrix `G` and its principal `(n-1)x(n-1)` submatrix `G'` must share an eigenvalue.\nThe matrix `G` is a Cauchy matrix of the form `C_{jk} = 1/(a_j+b_k)` with `a_j = n-j` and `b_k=k`. For such matrices, it is a known (though non-trivial) result from linear algebra that the eigenvalues of the matrix and its principal submatrices strictly interlace. This means they cannot share any eigenvalues.\nTherefore, there can be no eigenfunction `v(x)` satisfying `∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0`.\n\n**Step 7: Conclude the condition for no solution.**\nSince the condition `∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0` is never met for any eigenfunction `v(x)`, the original equation will have **no solution** for every characteristic value `λ`.\nThe problem is now reduced to finding all characteristic values `λ`. These are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `G` where `G_jk = 1/(n-j+k)` for `j,k = 0, ..., n-1`.\nThese eigenvalues are generally not simple numbers and depend on `n`.\n\n*   For `n=1`, `G = [1]`. The eigenvalue is `μ=1`. So `λ=1`.\n*   For `n=2`, `G = [[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]]`. The eigenvalues are `μ = 1/2 ± 1/√3`. So `λ = 1/(1/2 ± 1/√3) = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\nThe question asks for \"what values\", which implies expressing them. Without a general closed-form for the eigenvalues for any `n`, the most precise answer is to define them as the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of this specific matrix.\n\nThe values of `λ` for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `G` whose elements are given by `G_jk = 1/(n-j+k)` for `j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\n<<<The values of λ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix G with entries G_jk = 1/(n-j+k), where j and k are the row and column indices ranging from 0 to n-1.>>>"
