    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the radius of the large circle.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nThe problem is a classic mathematical puzzle known as \"circle packing in a circle\". We need to find the radius of the smallest possible circle (the \"containing circle\") that can enclose fourteen smaller circles, each with a radius of one. The term \"tightly packed\" implies we are looking for this minimum possible radius. The radius of the small circles is `r = 1`. We need to find the radius of the large circle, `R`.\n\n**2. Identify the Optimal Configuration**\nThis is a well-studied problem, and the optimal arrangement (the one that results in the smallest containing circle) for 14 circles is known. It's not a simple symmetrical layout like a hexagon. The proven optimal configuration for n=14 consists of three layers:\n*   One circle at the very center (C0).\n*   An inner ring of five circles (C1-C5).\n*   An outer ring of eight circles (C6-C13).\n\nThe total number of circles is 1 + 5 + 8 = 14.\n\n**3. Analyze the Geometry of the Configuration**\nLet the center of the large circle be the origin (0, 0) in a Cartesian coordinate system.\n\n*   **Central Circle (C0):** Its center is at (0, 0).\n*   **Inner Ring (C1-C5):** The five circles in this ring are all tangent to the central circle (C0). For a circle of radius `r=1` to be tangent to another circle of radius `r=1` at the origin, the center of the outer circle must be at a distance of `r + r = 2` from the origin. Therefore, the centers of these five circles lie on a circle of radius 2.\n    *   *Careful Point:* A key detail is that these five circles do *not* touch each other. If they did, they would form a pentagon, and the distance from the origin to their centers would be `r / sin(36°) = 1 / sin(36°) ≈ 1.701`. Since this is less than 2, they cannot be tangent to the central circle *and* to each other simultaneously. So, they are spaced out, touching only the central circle.\n*   **Outer Ring (C6-C13):** The eight circles in this ring are positioned in the \"pockets\" or \"crevices\" formed by the inner ring of five circles. For the packing to be \"tight\", each of these outer circles must be tangent to two adjacent circles from the inner ring. It will also be tangent to the large containing circle. The radius of the large circle `R` will be determined by the position of these outer circles.\n\n**4. Set up and Solve the Geometric Equations**\nLet's find the position of the center of one of the outer circles, `P_out`. By symmetry, `P_out` must lie on the angle bisector of the line connecting the origin to the centers of the two inner circles it touches.\n\n*   Let the center of an inner circle `C1` be at `P1 = (2, 0)`.\n*   The angle between the centers of adjacent inner circles is `360° / 5 = 72°`.\n*   Let the center of the next inner circle `C2` be at `P2 = (2 * cos(72°), 2 * sin(72°))`.\n*   Let the center of an outer circle `C_out` be `P_out = (x, y)`. This circle is tangent to both `C1` and `C2`.\n*   The distance between the centers of two tangent circles of radius 1 is `1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Distance from `P_out` to `P1` is 2: `(x - 2)² + y² = 2² = 4`  (Equation 1)\n    *   Distance from `P_out` to `P2` is 2: `(x - 2cos(72°))² + (y - 2sin(72°))² = 2² = 4` (Equation 2)\n\n*   **Solving the system:**\n    1.  Expand Equation 1: `x² - 4x + 4 + y² = 4`  => `x² + y² = 4x`.\n    2.  Expand Equation 2: `x² - 4xcos(72°) + 4cos²(72°) + y² - 4ysin(72°) + 4sin²(72°) = 4`.\n        Using the identity `sin²θ + cos²θ = 1`, this simplifies to: `x² + y² - 4xcos(72°) - 4ysin(72°) = 0`.\n    3.  Substitute `x² + y² = 4x` into the simplified Equation 2: `4x - 4xcos(72°) - 4ysin(72°) = 0`.\n    4.  Divide by 4: `x - xcos(72°) - ysin(72°) = 0` => `x(1 - cos(72°)) = ysin(72°)`.\n    5.  This simplifies to `y = x * tan(36°)`, which confirms `P_out` lies on the angle bisector of `∠P1OP2`.\n    6.  Substitute `y` back into `x² + y² = 4x`:\n        `x² + (x * tan(36°))² = 4x`\n        `x²(1 + tan²(36°)) = 4x`\n        Using the identity `1 + tan²θ = sec²θ`: `x²sec²(36°) = 4x`.\n        One solution is `x=0` (the origin), which we discard. The other is `x * sec²(36°) = 4`, so `x = 4cos²(36°)`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Radius of the Large Circle**\nNow we find the distance of `P_out` from the origin. Let this distance be `d`.\n*   `d² = x² + y²`. We already know `x² + y² = 4x`.\n*   `d² = 4 * (4cos²(36°)) = 16cos²(36°)`.\n*   `d = 4cos(36°)`.\n*   The value of `cos(36°)` is `(1 + √5) / 4`.\n*   So, `d = 4 * (1 + √5) / 4 = 1 + √5`.\n\nThis distance `d` is the radius of the circle on which the centers of the eight outer circles lie. The radius of the large containing circle, `R`, is this distance `d` plus the radius `r` of one outer circle.\n\n*   `R = d + r`\n*   `R = (1 + √5) + 1`\n*   `R = 2 + √5`\n\n**6. Final Calculation and Rounding**\nNow, we calculate the numerical value and round it to 4 significant digits.\n*   `√5 ≈ 2.2360679...`\n*   `R = 2 + 2.2360679... = 4.2360679...`\n*   Rounding to 4 significant digits, we look at the first four digits (4, 2, 3, 6) and the fifth digit (0). Since the fifth digit is less than 5, we do not round up.\n\nThe radius of the large circle is **4.236**.\n\n<<<4.236>>>"
