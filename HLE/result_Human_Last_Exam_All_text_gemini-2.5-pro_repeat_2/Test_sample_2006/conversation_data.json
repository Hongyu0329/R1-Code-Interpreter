    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Premise**\nThe core of the problem is to solve a riddle presented as a haiku.\n*   **The Question:** The title, \"The Bays\", is the question. The plural form \"Bays\" suggests that the answer is a list of more than one bay.\n*   **The Clues:** The haiku itself contains the clues. A haiku has three lines, which strongly implies there are three bays to identify, with one clue per line.\n*   **The Constraint:** The final answer must be presented in alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Line of the Haiku**\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This clue combines a time (\"August\") with an event (\"tempest\", a violent storm).\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to find a bay famously associated with a major storm that occurred in August. A well-known example is Hurricane Andrew, a powerful Category 5 storm that hit South Florida in August 1992. The center of this \"August tempest\" passed directly over Biscayne Bay.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first bay is **Biscayne Bay**.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The phrasing \"Twice fifteen\" is very specific, rather than simply saying \"thirty\". This suggests the number's context is as important as its value. \"Winds of change\" points to a pivotal, transformative event.\n    *   **Analysis:** \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30. The most famous \"30\" associated with a transformative event is the \"30 pieces of silver\" for which Judas betrayed Jesus. This act of betrayal was a profound \"wind of change\" in the biblical narrative. This clue, therefore, points to a bay whose name is associated with betrayal.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The second bay is **Traitor's Bay** (found in the Marquesas Islands).\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The clue specifies \"a divine one,\" pointing to a single, specific deity, rather than a group. The word \"yields\" implies that this divine being gives or provides something, most likely its name, to the bay.\n    *   **Analysis:** We need to find a bay named after a single god or goddess. Apollo is a prominent \"divine one\" from Greek mythology. A bay in Victoria, Australia, \"yields\" to this name.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The third bay is **Apollo Bay**.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble and Finalize the Answer**\n*   **List the Identified Bays:** We have identified three bays:\n    1.  Biscayne Bay\n    2.  Traitor's Bay\n    3.  Apollo Bay\n*   **Apply the Alphabetical Order Constraint:** The question requires the final answer to be in alphabetical order.\n    1.  Apollo Bay\n    2.  Biscayne Bay\n    3.  Traitor's Bay\n\n<<<Apollo Bay, Biscayne Bay, Traitor's Bay>>>"
