    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\n\nThe objective is to design a full-order Luenberger observer for the given discrete-time system.\nSystem equations:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nObserver equation:\nx_hat(k+1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - y_hat(k))\nx_hat(k+1) = (A - LC)x_hat(k) + Bu(k) + Ly(k)\n\nThe observation error is e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k). Its dynamics are given by:\ne(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nThe requirement is that the observation error `e(k)` becomes identically zero in the *shortest possible number of steps*. This is the definition of a deadbeat observer. The shortest number of steps is equal to the observability index, `v`, of the system `(A, C)`. For the error to become zero in `v` steps and stay zero, the error dynamics matrix `A_e = A - LC` must be nilpotent with an index of nilpotency of at most `v`. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of `A - LC` at the origin (z=0).\n\n### Step 2: Check System Observability and Find the Observability Index\n\nThe system is observable if the observability matrix `O` has full rank, i.e., `rank(O) = n`, where `n` is the dimension of the state vector. Here, `n=4`. The observability matrix is `O = [C; CA; CA^2; ...; CA^(n-1)]`.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]] (n=4)\nC = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] (p=2)\n\nLet's compute the necessary sub-matrices:\n`C` (2x4 matrix)\n`CA = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] * [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]] = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`\n\nLet's check the rank of `O_2 = [C; CA]`:\n`O_2 = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`\nThe determinant of this 4x4 matrix is 0, so its rank is less than 4. The observability index `v` is greater than 2.\n\nNow, let's compute `CA^2`:\n`CA^2 = (CA)A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]] * [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]] = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [2, 1, 0, -3]]`\n\nLet's check the rank of `O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2]`, which is a 6x4 matrix. We need to find if there are 4 linearly independent rows. Let's form a 4x4 matrix from selected rows of `O_3`, for example, row 1, row 2, row 4, and row 6:\n`M = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0, -3]]`\nThe determinant of M is `det(M) = 1`. Since the determinant is non-zero, the matrix `M` has rank 4. Therefore, `rank(O_3) = 4`.\n\nSince `rank(O_2) < 4` and `rank(O_3) = 4`, the observability index is `v = 3`. This means the error can be made zero in 3 steps.\n\n### Step 3: Design the Observer Gain Matrix L\n\nWe need to find the gain matrix `L` (a 4x2 matrix) such that all eigenvalues of `A - LC` are at z=0. The characteristic polynomial of `A - LC` must be `z^4`.\n\nThis is a pole placement problem. We can solve it using the dual state-feedback problem. The eigenvalues of `A - LC` are the same as the eigenvalues of `(A - LC)^T = A^T - C^T L^T`.\nLet `A' = A^T`, `B' = C^T`, and `K = L^T`. We need to find the state-feedback gain `K` (a 2x4 matrix) such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system `A' - B'K` are all zero.\n\n`A' = A^T = [[-1, 1, 0, -1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 2, -1, -1]]`\n`B' = C^T = [[1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\nLet `K = [[k11, k12, k13, k14], [k21, k22, k23, k24]]`.\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A' - B'K` must be `z^4`.\nThe matrix `A'_cl = A' - B'K` has a specific structure. After calculating `B'K`, we get:\n`A'_cl = [[-1-(k11+k21), 1-(k12+k22), -(k13+k23), -1-(k14+k24)], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [1-k21, 2-k22, -1-k23, -1-k24]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial `det(zI - A'_cl)` is found to be:\n`p(z) = z^4 + z^3(-a44 - a11) + z^2(-a43 + a11 a44 - a14 a41) + z(-a42 + a11 a43 - a13 a41) + (a11 a42 - a12 a41)`\nwhere `a_ij` are the elements of `A'_cl`.\n\nWe need to set the coefficients of `z^3, z^2, z^1, z^0` to zero. This gives 4 equations for the 8 unknown `k_ij`. We can simplify the problem by setting one row of `K` to zero. Let's set the second row of `K` to zero, so `k21 = k22 = k23 = k24 = 0`.\n\nNow, the `a_ij` terms simplify:\n`a11 = -1-k11`, `a12 = 1-k12`, `a13 = -k13`, `a14 = -1-k14`\n`a41 = 1`, `a42 = 2`, `a43 = -1`, `a44 = -1`\n\nThe four equations become:\n1.  `Coeff(z^3): -a44 - a11 = 0` => `-(-1) - (-1-k11) = 0` => `2 + k11 = 0` => `k11 = -2`.\n2.  `Coeff(z^2): -a43 + a11*a44 - a14*a41 = 0` => `-(-1) + (-1-k11)(-1) - (-1-k14)(1) = 0` => `1 + (1+k11) + (1+k14) = 0`. Substituting `k11=-2`: `1 + (1-2) + 1+k14 = 0` => `1 - 1 + 1 + k14 = 0` => `k14 = -1`.\n3.  `Coeff(z^1): -a42 + a11*a43 - a13*a41 = 0` => `-(2) + (-1-k11)(-1) - (-k13)(1) = 0` => `-2 + (1+k11) + k13 = 0`. Substituting `k11=-2`: `-2 + (1-2) + k13 = 0` => `-2 - 1 + k13 = 0` => `k13 = 3`.\n4.  `Coeff(z^0): a11*a42 - a12*a41 = 0` => `(-1-k11)(2) - (1-k12)(1) = 0`. Substituting `k11=-2`: `(-1-(-2))(2) - (1-k12) = 0` => `(1)(2) - 1 + k12 = 0` => `1 + k12 = 0` => `k12 = -1`.\n\nSo, we have found a solution for `K`:\n`K = [[-2, -1, 3, -1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Observer Gain L\n\nThe observer gain `L` is the transpose of `K`:\n`L = K^T = [[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]`\n\nThis is the required gain matrix for the deadbeat observer.\n\n<<<[[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]>>>"
