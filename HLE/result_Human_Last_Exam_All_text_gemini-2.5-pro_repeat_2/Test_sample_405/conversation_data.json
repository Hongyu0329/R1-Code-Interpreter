    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question**\nThe question asks for the total number of distinct colors that can be observed from the different *pure allotropes* of the element phosphorus. An allotrope is a distinct structural form of an element. We need to identify these forms and their corresponding colors.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the primary and most common allotropes of phosphorus**\nThere are three allotropes that are widely known and commonly discussed in chemistry:\n*   **White Phosphorus (P₄):** This is a molecular solid composed of P₄ tetrahedra. When pure, it is a colorless or white waxy solid. However, upon exposure to light or due to the presence of trace impurities, it often takes on a yellowish hue. Therefore, its observable color is **White/Yellow**.\n*   **Red Phosphorus (Pₙ):** This is a polymeric form where the P₄ tetrahedra are linked together in a chain-like structure. As its name clearly indicates, its color is **Red**. There is also a variant called scarlet phosphorus, which is considered a shade of red.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable and least reactive allotrope. It has a layered, puckered honeycomb structure similar to graphite. It is a **Black** solid with a metallic sheen.\n\nThis gives us three distinct colors: White/Yellow, Red, and Black.\n\n**Step 3: Consider other well-established, but less common, allotropes**\nBeyond the main three, chemistry recognizes other distinct allotropic forms.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus (also known as Hittorf's Metallic Phosphorus):** This is a specific, well-defined crystalline polymeric form (monoclinic structure) of phosphorus. It is distinct from amorphous red phosphorus in both structure and chemical reactivity. Its color is **Violet**. This is a fourth distinct color.\n\n**Step 4: Account for modern, recently synthesized allotropes**\nMaterials science has led to the discovery and synthesis of new allotropes, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) forms.\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** This is a 2D allotrope (a type of phosphorene) that was first created in 2016. It has a layered structure different from black phosphorus. As its name suggests, it is observed to be **Blue**. Since it is a confirmed pure allotrope, its color must be included in the count.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate other mentioned forms and edge cases**\n*   **Brown Phosphorus:** This is sometimes mentioned as an amorphous form. However, its status as a distinct pure allotrope is debated, and it is often considered an ill-defined or impure variant of red phosphorus. To be careful, we should stick to clearly defined and accepted pure allotropes.\n*   **Diphosphorus (P₂):** This is a gaseous allotrope stable only at very high temperatures (over 1200 °C). As a gas, it doesn't have an observable color in the same sense as the solid allotropes.\n\n**Step 6: Consolidate the list and count the distinct colors**\nBased on the analysis of confirmed pure allotropes with distinct observable colors, we have the following list:\n1.  **White/Yellow** (from White Phosphorus)\n2.  **Red** (from Red Phosphorus)\n3.  **Black** (from Black Phosphorus)\n4.  **Violet** (from Violet/Hittorf's Phosphorus)\n5.  **Blue** (from Blue Phosphorus)\n\nCounting these unique colors gives us a total of 5.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Pure Allotropes:** The question specifies \"pure allotropes,\" so we must exclude colors due to impurities or forms that are not well-defined as distinct allotropes (like brown phosphorus).\n*   **Color vs. Shade:** White and yellow are treated as one color category for white phosphorus as it transitions between them. Scarlet phosphorus is considered a shade of red.\n*   **Distinct Allotropes:** Red and Violet phosphorus are counted separately because they have distinct crystal structures (amorphous vs. monoclinic) and properties, even though both are polymeric.\n*   **Inclusion of Modern Discoveries:** Blue phosphorus is a scientifically confirmed allotrope and should be included, even though it is a recent discovery.\n\n### Final Answer\nBy systematically identifying each distinct and confirmed pure allotrope of phosphorus and its characteristic color, we arrive at a final count.\n\n<<<5>>>"
