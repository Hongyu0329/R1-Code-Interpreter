    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question's Premise:** The question asks for the specific year when \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". This question operates on the premise that such an event occurred.\n\n2.  **Verify the Name:** The first step is to verify the full and correct name of the individual in question. The former President of Nigeria is universally known by his official name: **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his recognized birth name or any officially adopted name.\n\n3.  **Identify the Name \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria and a pivotal figure in the country's independence movement. He is a completely different historical figure from Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n4.  **Conduct a Factual Search:** A thorough search of public records, reputable news archives (such as the BBC, Reuters, Associated Press, and major Nigerian newspapers), official government statements, and biographical data is required to check if Goodluck Jonathan ever made a public declaration to add \"Azikiwe\" to his name or identify with it.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Search Results:** The search reveals no credible evidence of this event ever taking place. There are no news reports, official documents, videos, or transcripts of speeches where Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". An action as significant as a sitting president adopting the name of a revered national founder would have been a major news story, but no such story exists.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Conclusion:** Based on the lack of any evidence, the conclusion is that the premise of the question is incorrect. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as Azikiwe. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a year for an event that did not happen.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of Names:** It is crucial to use the correct and official names of public figures. The question contains an incorrect name (\"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\").\n*   **Verification of Facts:** The core claim of the question must be verified before an answer is attempted. Assuming the premise is true can lead to spreading misinformation.\n*   **Distinguishing Individuals:** It is important to distinguish between Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe, as they are separate individuals with distinct legacies.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** The answer relies on the absence of evidence from credible sources. In historical and factual inquiries, a lack of evidence after a thorough search is a strong indicator that the event did not occur.\n\n<<<There is no public record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself as Azikiwe. The premise of the question is incorrect as this event never occurred."
