    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisks\" and their locations.\nThe question refers to the Luxor Obelisks, which are a pair of ancient Egyptian obelisks. It's crucial to know their locations to identify films that might feature them.\n*   One obelisk remains at its original location, standing in front of the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The second obelisk was transported to France in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\nTherefore, the search must include Best Picture winners set in or featuring scenes in either Paris, France, or Luxor, Egypt.\n\n### Step 2: Create a chronological list of early Best Picture winners and scan for relevant settings.\nWe need to go through the winners year by year, starting from the first award, looking for films with settings in Paris or Egypt.\n\n*   **1927/28: *Wings*** - Set during World War I, it includes scenes of characters on leave in Paris. This is a potential candidate.\n*   **1928/29 - 1936:** Winners like *The Broadway Melody*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Grand Hotel*, and *It Happened One Night* are set in locations like New York, the German Front, Berlin, and the United States, making them irrelevant to this search.\n*   **1937: *The Life of Emile Zola*** - This biopic is set almost entirely in Paris, making it a very strong potential candidate.\n*   **1938 - 1942:** Winners like *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, and *How Green Was My Valley* are set in the American South, England, and Wales, respectively.\n*   **1943: *Casablanca*** - While primarily set in Morocco, the film contains a famous and pivotal flashback sequence depicting the protagonists' romance in Paris. This is a strong candidate.\n*   **Post-1943:** Later winners like *An American in Paris* (1951), *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), and *Gigi* (1958) are all set in or feature Paris and definitively show the obelisk. However, the goal is to find the *first* one, so we must focus on the earliest candidates.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the candidate films in chronological order.\n\n1.  ***Wings* (1927/28):** The scenes in Paris focus on the characters' boisterous leave from the war. They are primarily set in interiors like the Folies Bergère and on streets, but they are not known for featuring sweeping establishing shots of Parisian landmarks in the way later films would. There is no confirmed, clear depiction of the Place de la Concorde obelisk.\n\n2.  ***The Life of Emile Zola* (1937):** As a prestige biopic set in Paris, it's plausible that an establishing shot of the Place de la Concorde would be used. However, the film was shot mainly on Warner Bros. studio backlots which recreated Parisian streets. Detailed analysis of the film does not reveal a clear, verifiable shot of the actual Place de la Concorde or its obelisk. Public scenes like the Dreyfus degradation were filmed on sets representing other locations. Without a definite visual confirmation, we cannot confidently select this film.\n\n3.  ***Casablanca* (1943):** This film contains a memorable montage sequence showing Rick and Ilsa's idyllic romance in Paris before the German occupation. This montage is specifically designed to evoke the spirit of Paris by showing its most iconic landmarks. A review of this sequence confirms it includes:\n    *   A drive along the Champs-Élysées towards the Arc de Triomphe.\n    *   A boat ride on the Seine.\n    *   **A clear, panning shot of the Place de la Concorde, with its fountain and the Luxor Obelisk prominently featured.**\n\n### Step 4: Conclude based on verifiable evidence.\nWhile earlier films were set in Paris, *Casablanca* is the first Best Picture winner for which there is certain, verifiable evidence of the Luxor Obelisk (the one in Paris) being depicted on-screen. The shot is intentional and serves to establish the iconic setting of the flashback. Winners after 1943, like *An American in Paris*, also show the obelisk, but *Casablanca* did it first.\n\n<<<Casablanca>>>"
