    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Theoretical Framework\n\nThe problem asks us to find the equilibrium properties of a photon gas using principles related to the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems. In statistical mechanics, these theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principle of maximum entropy.\n\n*   **Principle of Maximum Entropy:** The equilibrium state of an isolated system is the macrostate that corresponds to the largest number of possible microstates (Ω). This is equivalent to maximizing the Boltzmann entropy, $S = k_B \\ln Ω$.\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem Connection:** This theorem states that the probability of a system of many independent particles having an empirical distribution different from its true underlying distribution decays exponentially with the number of particles. The rate of decay is given by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Maximizing entropy is equivalent to finding the most probable empirical distribution, which is the one that minimizes this divergence subject to system constraints.\n*   **System Characteristics (Photon Gas):**\n    1.  **Particles:** Photons are bosons, so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics.\n    2.  **Indistinguishability:** Photons are indistinguishable.\n    3.  **Non-conservation of Particle Number:** Photons can be created and absorbed by the walls of their container. This means the total number of photons, N, is not a conserved quantity. In the language of statistical mechanics, this implies that the chemical potential, μ, is zero.\n*   **Constraint:** The only constraint on the system in thermal equilibrium is that its total energy, U, is constant (in the microcanonical ensemble) or has a fixed average value (in the canonical ensemble).\n\n### Step 2: Deriving the Equilibrium Distribution\n\nTo find the equilibrium state, we maximize the entropy S subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy U.\n\n1.  **Entropy for Bose-Einstein Statistics:** The number of ways to distribute $n_i$ bosons among $g_i$ states at energy level $ε_i$ is $Ω_i = \\frac{(n_i+g_i-1)!}{n_i!(g_i-1)!}$. The total number of microstates is $Ω_{BE} = \\prod_i Ω_i$. The entropy is $S = k_B \\ln Ω_{BE}$. Using Stirling's approximation ($\\ln N! \\approx N \\ln N - N$) for large $n_i$ and $g_i$, the entropy becomes:\n    $S \\approx k_B \\sum_i [ (n_i+g_i)\\ln(n_i+g_i) - n_i\\ln n_i - g_i\\ln g_i ]$\n\n2.  **Maximization using Lagrange Multipliers:** We need to maximize S under the constraint $\\sum_i n_i ε_i = U$. We introduce a Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ and maximize the function:\n    $L = \\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta \\left(\\sum_i n_i ε_i - U\\right)$\n    We set the partial derivative with respect to each $n_i$ to zero: $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial n_i} = 0$.\n    $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_i}\\left(\\frac{S}{k_B}\\right) = \\ln(n_i+g_i) + 1 - (\\ln n_i + 1) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_i+g_i}{n_i}\\right)$\n    So, the condition for the maximum is:\n    $\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_i+g_i}{n_i}\\right) - \\beta ε_i = 0$\n\n3.  **Bose-Einstein Distribution:** Solving for the occupation number $n_i$:\n    $\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{g_i}{n_i}\\right) = \\beta ε_i$\n    $1 + \\frac{g_i}{n_i} = e^{\\beta ε_i}$\n    $\\frac{g_i}{n_i} = e^{\\beta ε_i} - 1$\n    The average number of photons per state at energy $ε_i$ is:\n    $\\frac{n_i}{g_i} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta ε_i} - 1}$\n    From thermodynamics, the Lagrange multiplier is identified with the inverse temperature: $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$.\n    Therefore, the equilibrium distribution is:\n    $\\frac{n_i}{g_i} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\varepsilon_i/k_B T} - 1}$\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)\n\nThe total energy U is the sum of the energies of all photons. For a continuous energy spectrum, we replace the sum with an integral.\n\n1.  **Density of States:** For photons in a three-dimensional box of volume V, the number of available states (modes) in the energy interval $[ε, ε+dε]$ is given by the density of states $g(ε)dε$. Including the two polarization states for photons:\n    $g(ε)dε = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} ε^2 dε$\n    where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.\n\n2.  **Integral for U:**\n    $U = \\int_0^\\infty ε \\cdot n(ε) dε = \\int_0^\\infty ε \\cdot \\frac{g(ε)}{e^{\\varepsilon/k_B T} - 1} dε$\n    $U = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{ε}{e^{\\varepsilon/k_B T} - 1} \\left(\\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} ε^2\\right) dε = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{ε^3}{e^{\\varepsilon/k_B T} - 1} dε$\n\n3.  **Solving the Integral:** Let $x = \\frac{ε}{k_B T}$. Then $ε = xk_B T$ and $dε = k_B T dx$.\n    $U = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} (k_B T)^4 \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\n    The definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 3! \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n\n4.  **Final Expression for U:**\n    $U = \\frac{8 \\pi V (k_B T)^4}{h^3 c^3} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}\\right) = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\n    This result is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of blackbody radiation.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)\n\nWe can find the entropy by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy formula or, more simply, by using a thermodynamic relation.\n\n1.  **Thermodynamic Relation:** For any system, the fundamental thermodynamic relation is $U = TS - PV + \\mu N$. For a photon gas, $\\mu=0$. For an ultra-relativistic gas like photons, the pressure P is related to the energy density $u=U/V$ by $P = u/3 = U/(3V)$.\n    Substituting these into the relation:\n    $U = TS - PV = TS - \\frac{U}{3}V \\frac{1}{V} = TS - \\frac{U}{3}$\n    $TS = U + \\frac{U}{3} = \\frac{4U}{3}$\n    $S = \\frac{4U}{3T}$\n\n2.  **Final Expression for S:** Substituting the expression for U we just found:\n    $S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right)$\n    $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas (light quanta) are:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n    $U = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n    $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n\nwhere V is the volume, T is the temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, h is the Planck constant, and c is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $U = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n>>>"
