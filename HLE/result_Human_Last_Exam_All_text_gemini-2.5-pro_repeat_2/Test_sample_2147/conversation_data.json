    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure and Context:** The question centers on Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian liberal politician, historian, and public intellectual of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The context is his criticism of Western culture.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Accusation:** Milyukov used the strong pejorative phrase \"stagnant swamp\" (in Russian, \"Гнилое болото\" or \"Gniloe boloto\"). This indicates a deep-seated contempt for the subject, viewing it as decadent, decaying, and without merit or progress.\n\n3.  **Research Milyukov's Cultural Views:** While Milyukov was a \"Westernizer\" in his political and social outlook, advocating for a constitutional monarchy in Russia modeled on Western European states, he was conservative in his cultural and artistic tastes. He was a staunch defender of 19th-century realism and classicism in art.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Target of the \"Stagnant Swamp\" Remark:** Historical sources confirm that Milyukov's famous \"Stagnant Swamp\" polemic was aimed squarely at **modern art**. He was a leading voice in the backlash against the avant-garde art movements that were emerging in Europe and being adopted by Russian artists. He saw these movements as a symptom of cultural decay and irrationality.\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific Art Movement:** The Russian avant-garde art groups of the 1910s, such as the \"Jack of Diamonds\" (Бубновый валет), were heavily influenced by the latest trends from Paris. The foundational movement that broke from Impressionism and led to later developments like Cubism and Fauvism was **Post-Impressionism**, pioneered by artists like Paul Cézanne, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin.\n\n6.  **Connect the Movement to the \"X-Y\" Format:** The question asks for \"X-Ys\", implying a plural noun for a group of people or a style. The artists who followed the principles of Post-Impressionism are known as **Post-Impressionists**. This term fits the \"X-Y\" format and accurately identifies the group whose artistic philosophy Milyukov was denouncing as a \"stagnant swamp.\" He was attacking both the original French Post-Impressionists and their Russian followers.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Distinction from Politics:** It's crucial to note that Milyukov's cultural conservatism stood in contrast to his progressive political liberalism. He was not against the West in general, but against what he perceived as a specific, decadent trend within its modern culture.\n*   **The Specificity of the Term:** While he also disliked Cubism and Futurism, \"Post-Impressionists\" represents the broader, foundational movement from which these other styles emerged and which was the primary influence on the Russian avant-garde groups he was directly attacking at the time of his famous remark.\n*   **The Format \"X-Y\":** The hyphenated nature of the unknown term \"X-Y\" points toward a compound name like \"Post-Impressionists.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPavel Milyukov accused the practitioners of modern art, who were heavily influenced by French trends, of being a \"stagnant swamp.\" The primary movement he and other critics targeted was Post-Impressionism. Therefore, \"X-Y\" refers to the artists of this movement.\n\n<<<Post-Impressionists>>>"
