    "This problem requires us to find all second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory, calculate their respective symmetry factors, and then sum these factors.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant diagrams\n\n*   **Theory:** The theory is $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory, with the interaction Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$.\n*   **Order:** We are interested in \"second-order\" diagrams, which means they are of order $\\lambda^2$. This implies that each diagram must contain exactly two interaction vertices.\n*   **Diagrams:** We need to find all connected Feynman diagrams with two 4-point vertices and no external lines (vacuum bubbles).\n\nLet the two vertices be $V_1$ and $V_2$. Each vertex has 4 \"legs\" corresponding to the four $\\phi$ fields in the interaction term. Since these are vacuum diagrams, all 8 legs must be connected internally, forming propagators. A propagator connects two legs. We can classify the connected diagrams by how the vertices are connected.\n\nLet $n_{12}$ be the number of propagators connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$.\nLet $n_{11}$ be the number of propagators connecting $V_1$ to itself (loops on $V_1$).\nLet $n_{22}$ be the number of propagators connecting $V_2$ to itself (loops on $V_2$).\n\nEach propagator uses two legs. The total number of legs at each vertex is 4. This gives us a system of equations for the degrees of the vertices:\n1.  For $V_1$: $n_{12} + 2 \\cdot n_{11} = 4$\n2.  For $V_2$: $n_{12} + 2 \\cdot n_{22} = 4$\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that $n_{11} = n_{22}$. Also, $n_{12}$ must be an even integer. Let's consider the possible values for $n_{12}$:\n\n*   **Case 1: $n_{12} = 4$**\n    This implies $2n_{11} = 4 - 4 = 0$, so $n_{11} = 0$. Consequently, $n_{22}=0$.\n    This diagram consists of two vertices connected by four propagators. This is often called the **\"Figure-8\" diagram**.\n\n*   **Case 2: $n_{12} = 2$**\n    This implies $2n_{11} = 4 - 2 = 2$, so $n_{11} = 1$. Consequently, $n_{22}=1$.\n    This diagram has two propagators connecting the vertices, one loop on $V_1$, and one loop on $V_2$. This is often called the **\"Double-Scoop\" diagram**.\n\n*   **Case 3: $n_{12} = 0$**\n    This implies $2n_{11} = 4 - 0 = 4$, so $n_{11} = 2$. Consequently, $n_{22}=2$.\n    This diagram has no propagators connecting the vertices. It consists of two disconnected parts, where each part is a vertex with two loops on it. According to the linked-cluster theorem, we only sum over connected diagrams for the vacuum energy. Therefore, this case is excluded.\n\nSo, there are exactly two connected, second-order vacuum bubble diagrams.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the symmetry factor for each diagram\n\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which is the number of permutations of its internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram unchanged.\n\n**Diagram 1: The \"Figure-8\" Diagram**\n\n*   **Description:** Two vertices are connected by four propagators.\n*   **Symmetries:**\n    1.  **Permutation of propagators:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical. They can be permuted in any way, leaving the diagram invariant. This gives a factor of $4! = 24$.\n    2.  **Permutation of vertices:** The two vertices are also identical and can be swapped. This gives a factor of 2.\n*   The group of these symmetries is the direct product $\\mathbb{S}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n*   **Symmetry Factor ($S_1$):** The total symmetry factor is the product of the orders of these symmetry operations:\n    $S_1 = 4! \\times 2 = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\n**Diagram 2: The \"Double-Scoop\" Diagram**\n\n*   **Description:** Two vertices are connected by two propagators. Each vertex also has one propagator attached to itself, forming a loop.\n*   **Symmetries:**\n    1.  **Permutation of connecting propagators:** The two propagators connecting the vertices are identical and can be swapped. This gives a factor of 2.\n    2.  **Permutation of vertices:** The two vertices are structurally identical (each has one loop and two lines connecting to the other vertex). Swapping them leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of 2.\n    3.  **Symmetry of loops:** A loop propagator is attached to two legs of the same vertex. These two legs can be swapped without changing the diagram's topology. This is sometimes called \"flipping the loop\". Since there is one loop on each of the two vertices, this contributes a factor of 2 for each vertex. So, $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   **Symmetry Factor ($S_2$):** The total symmetry factor is the product of these independent symmetry operations.\n    $S_2 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n### Step 3: Sum the symmetry factors\n\nThe problem asks for the sum of all the symmetry factors for the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams.\n\n*   Symmetry factor of the Figure-8 diagram: $S_1 = 48$\n*   Symmetry factor of the Double-Scoop diagram: $S_2 = 16$\n\nTotal Sum = $S_1 + S_2 = 48 + 16 = 64$.\n\nFinal verification:\n- Number of second-order connected diagrams: 2.\n- Symmetry factor for Figure-8 diagram ($S_1$): 48. This is due to permutations of 4 lines ($4!$) and swapping 2 vertices ($2$).\n- Symmetry factor for Double-Scoop diagram ($S_2$): 16. This is due to swapping 2 connecting lines ($2$), swapping 2 vertices ($2$), and flipping two loops ($2 \\times 2$).\n- Total sum: $48 + 16 = 64$.\n\nThe analysis is consistent with standard results in quantum field theory textbooks that correctly distinguish between diagram order (in coupling constant) and loop number.\n\n<<<64>>>"
