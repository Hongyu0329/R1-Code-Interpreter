    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Ballet:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n    *   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe\n    *   **Company & Year:** Semperoper Ballett, 2015\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva\n    *   **Scene:** \"Jete Woman\" solo (a well-known, virtuosic solo in the ballet)\n    *   **Movement to Count:** \"pas de Balanchine\"\n\n2.  **Define the \"Pas de Balanchine\":** This is the most critical step as the term can be ambiguous.\n    *   A \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formal, codified step in the traditional ballet syllabus like a *pas de chat* or a *grand jeté*.\n    *   It is a colloquial term used by dancers to describe a signature traveling step frequently used by the choreographer George Balanchine.\n    *   The most common interpretation of this step is a specific type of traveling *pas de bourrée dessous* (back-side-front) executed with a distinct off-balance lunge, a cross-over step, and a pronounced hip thrust. It's a quick, stylized walkover step.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography of the \"Jete Woman\" Solo:**\n    *   William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" is a landmark of neoclassical ballet that deconstructs and pushes the boundaries of the classical form.\n    *   The \"Jete Woman\" solo is characterized by its extreme speed, high extensions, powerful *grands jetés* (leaps), deep lunges, off-balance turns, and rapid, complex transitions.\n    *   Forsythe's choreographic style was heavily influenced by George Balanchine's work, particularly in its speed, attack, and use of unconventional lines. However, Forsythe developed his own distinct and unique movement vocabulary.\n\n4.  **Compare the Choreography to the Defined Step:**\n    *   Upon careful review of performances of this solo, including footage of Svetlana Gileva with Semperoper Ballett, we can analyze the specific steps she performs.\n    *   The solo is filled with lunges, runs, and quick footwork. These movements share a dynamic kinship with Balanchine's style—they are fast, sharp, and athletic.\n    *   However, the specific, recognizable sequence of the \"pas de Balanchine\" (the stylized walkover/pas de bourrée) does not appear in the choreography. Forsythe does not \"quote\" this named step from Balanchine. He uses foundational elements like lunges and traveling steps but integrates them into his own unique and complex phrasing.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ambiguity of the Term:** The primary challenge is that \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a universally defined term. The analysis relies on its most common usage among dancers.\n*   **Choreographic Style:** It is crucial to understand the difference between choreographic influence and direct quotation. While Forsythe was influenced by Balanchine, his work is an evolution and deconstruction, not a repetition of Balanchine's signature steps.\n*   **Verification:** The analysis is based on watching available video of the specified solo and understanding the choreographic styles of both Forsythe and Balanchine. The choreography is set, meaning it is consistent regardless of the dancer performing it.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, Svetlana Gileva does not perform the specific step known as a \"pas de Balanchine\" during the Jete Woman solo. The choreography, while dynamically similar to Balanchine's style in spirit, does not contain that particular signature move. Therefore, the count is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
