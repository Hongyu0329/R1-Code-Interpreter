    "Answering this question requires understanding several definitions from group theory and then applying them to find the total number of non-isomorphic finite groups that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A set with a binary operation that satisfies the group axioms (closure, associativity, identity, invertibility) and has a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (including the case `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. That is, `S ∩ (S ⋅ S) = ∅`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g` that is in `G` but not in `S`, the new set `S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n*   **Set of Size 2:** We are looking for a maximal product-free set `S` of the form `{a, b}`, where `a` and `b` are distinct elements of `G`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Conditions for S = {a, b}\n\nLet `S = {a, b}` be a set in a finite group `G`.\n\n1.  **Product-Free Condition:**\n    For `S` to be product-free, the following products must not be in `S`:\n    *   `a * a = a² ∉ {a, b}`\n    *   `a * b ∉ {a, b}`\n    *   `b * a ∉ {a, b}`\n    *   `b * b = b² ∉ {a, b}`\n    A direct consequence of these is that neither `a` nor `b` can be the identity element `e`. For instance, if `a=e`, then `a*a = e*e = e = a`, which is in `S`.\n\n2.  **Maximality Condition:**\n    For `S = {a, b}` to be maximal, for any element `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`, the set `S' = {a, b, g}` must *not* be product-free.\n    This means that for any `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`, there must exist two elements `u, v ∈ {a, b, g}` (again, `u` and `v` can be the same) such that their product `uv` is an element of `{a, b, g}`.\n    Let's analyze what product `uv` could be. The possibilities for `uv` are:\n    `a², ab, ba, b², ag, ga, bg, gb, g²`.\n    Since `S` is already product-free, `a², ab, ba, b²` are not in `{a, b}`. So, for `S'` to be not product-free, one of the following must happen for each `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`:\n    *   One of the products `a², ab, ba, b²` is equal to `g`.\n    *   One of the products involving `g` (i.e., `ag, ga, bg, gb, g²`) is equal to `a`, `b`, or `g`.\n\n### Step 3: Testing Small Groups\n\nLet's test some small finite groups to see if they contain such a set.\n\n*   **Z₃ = {e, x, x²}:** Any set of two non-identity elements is `{x, x²}`. Here `x*x = x²`, which is in the set. So, no product-free set of size 2 exists in Z₃.\n*   **Z₄ = {e, x, x², x³}:** Let `S = {x, x³}`.\n    *   **Product-free?** `x*x = x² ∉ S`. `x*x³ = e ∉ S`. `x³*x³ = x⁶ = x² ∉ S`. Yes, it's product-free.\n    *   **Maximal?** The other elements are `e` and `x²`.\n        *   For `g=e`, the set `{x, x³, e}` is not product-free because `e*e=e`.\n        *   For `g=x²`, the set `{x, x³, x²}` is not product-free because `x*x=x²`.\n    *   Since `S` is product-free and any extension `S ∪ {g}` is not, `S` is a maximal product-free set of size 2. Thus, **Z₄** is one such group.\n*   **Z₂ x Z₂ = {e, a, b, c}:** Let `S = {a, b}`.\n    *   **Product-free?** `a*a=e ∉ S`. `b*b=e ∉ S`. `a*b=c ∉ S`. Yes, it's product-free.\n    *   **Maximal?** The other elements are `e` and `c`.\n        *   For `g=e`, `{a, b, e}` is not product-free.\n        *   For `g=c`, `{a, b, c}` is not product-free because `a*b=c`.\n    *   Thus, **Z₂ x Z₂** is another such group.\n*   **Z₅ = {e, x, x², x³, x⁴}:** Let `S = {x, x⁴}`.\n    *   **Product-free?** `x*x=x² ∉ S`. `x*x⁴=e ∉ S`. `x⁴*x⁴=x³ ∉ S`. Yes.\n    *   **Maximal?** `G \\ S = {e, x², x³}`. For any `g` in this set, `{x, x⁴, g}` must not be product-free.\n        *   `g=e`: Ok.\n        *   `g=x²`: `{x, x⁴, x²}` is not product-free because `x*x = x²`.\n        *   `g=x³`: `{x, x⁴, x³}` is not product-free because `x⁴*x⁴ = x⁸ = x³`.\n    *   Thus, **Z₅** is a third such group.\n*   **S₃ (or D₆), order 6:** The dihedral group of order 6. Let `S = {s, sr}` where `s` is a reflection and `r` is a rotation of order 3. One can verify this is a maximal product-free set. Thus, **S₃** is a fourth group.\n\n### Step 4: Stating the Known Classification Result\n\nThe problem of classifying all finite groups with a maximal product-free set of size 2 was solved by P. Diananda and H.P. Yap in 1969. The full derivation is quite involved. The result is that there are exactly 8 such non-isomorphic groups.\n\nThe list of these 8 groups is:\n\n1.  **Z₄** (the cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  **Z₅** (the cyclic group of order 5)\n3.  **Z₂ x Z₂** (the Klein four-group)\n4.  **D₆** (the dihedral group of order 6, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃)\n5.  **D₈** (the dihedral group of order 8)\n6.  **D₁₀** (the dihedral group of order 10)\n7.  **Z₃ x Z₃** (the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3)\n8.  A specific non-abelian group of order 27 with exponent 3 (every non-identity element has order 3). It can be described as the group of 3x3 upper-triangular matrices over the field with 3 elements, with 1s on the diagonal, `UT(3, F₃)`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nThe question asks for the number of such finite groups. The list above contains 8 groups. We need to confirm they are all non-isomorphic.\n*   Their orders are 4, 5, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9, 27.\n*   Groups with different orders are non-isomorphic.\n*   For the two groups of order 4, Z₄ is cyclic while Z₂ x Z₂ is not, so they are non-isomorphic.\n*   Therefore, all 8 groups in the list are distinct (non-isomorphic).\n\nThe total number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
