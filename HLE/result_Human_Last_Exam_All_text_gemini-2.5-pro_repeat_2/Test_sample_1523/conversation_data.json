    "This problem requires us to analyze the quadratic part of the action for a neutral scalar field in the context of finite-temperature field theory. The notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ represents a bilinear form, which in this context corresponds to the quadratic part of the Euclidean action.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Framework of Finite-Temperature Field Theory**\n\nThe partition function $Z$ for a quantum field theory at a finite temperature $T$ is given by $Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H})$, where $H$ is the Hamiltonian and $\\beta = 1/T$ (in natural units where $k_B = 1$). The functional integral representation of this partition function is formulated in Euclidean spacetime using the imaginary-time formalism.\n\n*   **Imaginary Time:** The time coordinate $t$ is analytically continued to imaginary time, $\\tau = it$.\n*   **Euclidean Spacetime:** The path integral is performed over field configurations $\\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$ in a Euclidean spacetime with coordinates $x_E = (\\tau, \\vec{x})$. The integration domain for $\\tau$ is finite, from $0$ to $\\beta$.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** For a neutral scalar field (a boson), the field configurations must satisfy periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction: $\\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) = \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau + \\beta)$.\n*   **Partition Function:** The partition function is given by the functional integral:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n    where $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action of the field.\n\n**Step 2: The Euclidean Action for a Neutral Scalar Field**\n\nWe start with the standard Lagrangian density for a free, neutral scalar field $\\phi$ with mass $m$ in Minkowski spacetime:\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial^\\mu \\phi) - \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_t \\phi)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2$\n\nTo get the Euclidean Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_E$, we perform the Wick rotation $t \\to -i\\tau$, which implies $\\partial_t \\to i\\partial_\\tau$.\n$\\mathcal{L} \\to -\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(i\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2$\nSo, the Euclidean Lagrangian density is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2$\n\nThe Euclidean action $S_E$ is the integral of $\\mathcal{L}_E$ over the 4-dimensional Euclidean spacetime volume:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n**Step 3: Defining the Inner Product and the Operator D_ϕ**\n\nThe notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ suggests that the action can be written in a quadratic form. The standard inner product in this context is the L2 inner product over Euclidean spacetime:\n$(\\psi, \\chi) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\psi(x_E) \\chi(x_E) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\psi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) \\chi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$\n\nThe quadratic action for a free theory is typically written as $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, which means:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x_E) (D_\\phi \\phi)(x_E)$\nwhere $D_\\phi$ is a differential operator. Our goal is to manipulate the expression for $S_E[\\phi]$ to identify this operator.\n\n**Step 4: Deriving the Operator D_ϕ via Integration by Parts**\n\nWe take the kinetic part of the action and apply integration by parts.\n$S_{E, \\text{kin}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E (\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi) \\cdot (\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)$\nwhere $\\partial_\\mu^E = (\\partial_\\tau, \\nabla)$.\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n$\\int d^4x_E (\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)^2 = \\int d^4x_E \\left[ \\partial_\\mu^E(\\phi \\partial_\\mu^E \\phi) - \\phi (\\partial_\\mu^E \\partial_\\mu^E \\phi) \\right]$\n\nThe first term, $\\int d^4x_E \\, \\partial_\\mu^E(\\phi \\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)$, is a total derivative and becomes a surface integral.\n*   **Spatial boundary:** We assume the fields vanish at spatial infinity, so the contribution from the spatial boundary is zero.\n*   **Temporal boundary:** The integral over the temporal boundary is $\\int d^3x \\, [\\phi \\partial_\\tau \\phi]_{\\tau=0}^{\\tau=\\beta}$. Due to the periodic boundary condition $\\phi(\\vec{x}, 0) = \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\beta)$ (and thus $\\partial_\\tau\\phi(\\vec{x}, 0) = \\partial_\\tau\\phi(\\vec{x}, \\beta)$), this surface term vanishes.\n\nThus, we are left with:\n$\\int d^4x_E (\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)^2 = - \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\mu^E \\partial_\\mu^E \\phi) = - \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) \\phi$\n\n**Step 5: Final Expression for the Inner Product**\n\nSubstituting this result back into the full Euclidean action:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ - \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) \\phi + \\int d^4x_E \\, m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x_E) \\left[ -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2 \\right] \\phi(x_E)$\n\nComparing this with $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, we can identify the operator $D_\\phi$ as the **Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator**:\n$D_\\phi = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2 = -\\partial_E^2 + m^2$\n\nTherefore, the full expression for the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) \\left[ -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2 \\right] \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$\n\nAlternatively, using the expression for the action before integration by parts, we can also write:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = 2 S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2 + m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Formalism:** The problem is set in finite-temperature field theory, which requires the imaginary-time (Matsubara) formalism.\n2.  **Euclidean Space:** The transition from Minkowski to Euclidean space is essential. It changes the path integral weight from $e^{iS}$ to $e^{-S_E}$ and modifies the form of the Lagrangian.\n3.  **Boundary Conditions:** The periodicity of the bosonic field $\\phi$ in imaginary time is crucial for the theory's consistency and for the step involving integration by parts (vanishing of the boundary term).\n4.  **Inner Product Definition:** The specific form of $D_\\phi$ depends on the definition of the inner product. The standard choice is the L2 inner product over the Euclidean spacetime domain.\n5.  **The Operator:** The operator $D_\\phi$ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. Its inverse, $(D_\\phi)^{-1}$, is the propagator (or two-point correlation function) of the theory.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is twice the Euclidean action for the free scalar field. It can be expressed in two equivalent ways. The form that explicitly shows the differential operator $D_\\phi$ is:\n\n<<<($\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) \\left[ -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2 \\right] \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$>>>"
