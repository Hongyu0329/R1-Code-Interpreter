    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Setting:** Vienna, specifically its \"wide boulevards.\" The most famous of these is the Ringstrasse.\n    *   **Source:** A \"Russian translation of a certain essay.\" This is a crucial clue, suggesting the answer lies within the Russian language, likely through a pun or wordplay specific to the translation.\n    *   **Object to Find:** The surname of an English poet.\n    *   **Task:** Name this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Clue:** The key is the combination of \"wide boulevards\" and \"Russian translation.\" This points towards a linguistic pun that a translator might make. We need to think about how \"wide boulevards\" would be described in Russian.\n\n3.  **Translate the Key Phrase into Russian:**\n    *   The Russian word for \"boulevard\" is \"бульвар\" (bul'var).\n    *   The Russian word for \"wide\" is \"широкий\" (shirokiy).\n    *   When describing something as being \"wider,\" the comparative form of the adjective is used. The Russian word for \"wider\" is \"шире\" (pronounced roughly as \"shire\").\n    *   So, a phrase like \"the boulevards are wider\" would be \"бульвары шире\" (bul'vary shire).\n\n4.  **Connect the Russian Phrase to an English Poet:**\n    *   Now, we must find an English poet whose surname sounds like a word in that key Russian phrase.\n    *   The word \"шире\" (shire) sounds remarkably similar to the surname of the famous English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe **Shelley**.\n    *   In Russian, Shelley is written as \"Шелли\" and pronounced very similarly to \"шире\".\n\n5.  **Reconstruct the Scenario:**\n    *   A translator is working on an essay that describes the grand boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   The original text might contain a sentence like, \"And here, the boulevards are wider...\"\n    *   The translator renders this into Russian as \"...бульвары шире...\" (...bul'vary shire...).\n    *   Noticing the phonetic similarity between \"шире\" (wider) and \"Шелли\" (Shelley), the witty translator decides to insert a mention of the poet as a clever literary pun or allusion.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** The surname of the English poet is Shelley, based on a well-known linguistic pun in Russian literary translation circles.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Importance of Translation:** The problem is unsolvable without considering the specific mechanics of the Russian language. The answer does not come from a direct historical connection between the poet and Vienna's boulevards.\n*   **The Pun:** The core of the riddle is a phonetic pun. Recognizing this is key to avoiding dead ends (like searching for poets who actually lived in or wrote about Vienna).\n*   **The Comparative Adjective:** The pun works specifically with the comparative form \"wider\" (\"шире\"), not just the base adjective \"wide\" (\"широкий\").\n*   **The Final Answer Format:** The question asks for the surname in English, not its Russian transliteration.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
