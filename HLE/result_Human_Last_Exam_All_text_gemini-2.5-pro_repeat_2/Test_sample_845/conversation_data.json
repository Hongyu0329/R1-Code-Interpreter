    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Core Subject:** The question is about Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n2.  **Measurement Method:** The data is captured using Photoplethysmography (PPG), which measures blood volume changes.\n3.  **Fundamental Data:** The system works by \"capturing beat-to-beat intervals.\" This means it measures the precise time elapsed between one heartbeat and the next.\n4.  **The Question:** The user wants to know the specific name for this measured time interval between heartbeats.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **PPG vs. ECG:** While the question specifies PPG, the terminology for HRV analysis is heavily influenced by the \"gold standard\" method, which is the Electrocardiogram (ECG). It's important to understand the terms from both technologies as they are often used interchangeably.\n2.  **Raw Interval vs. Filtered Interval:** The raw time measured between any two consecutive beats is the most fundamental value. However, for accurate HRV analysis, abnormal beats (arrhythmias, artifacts) are often removed. The interval between two consecutive *normal* beats has a slightly different name.\n3.  **Synonymous Terms:** There are several terms for this interval, and their usage can depend on the context (e.g., academic paper, consumer app, medical device). The key is to identify the most common and technically correct terms.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  A heartbeat creates a detectable event. In an ECG signal, the most prominent and easily identifiable point of a heartbeat is the \"R\" wave, which is part of the QRS complex representing ventricular depolarization.\n2.  Therefore, the time interval measured from one R-wave to the next consecutive R-wave is called the **R-R interval**. This is the most common and foundational term used in the field of HRV.\n3.  When using PPG, there is no R-wave. Instead, the signal shows a peak corresponding to the pressure pulse wave from a heartbeat. The time between these peaks is technically a \"Peak-to-Peak (P-P) interval\".\n4.  However, because the entire field of HRV was built on ECG, the term **R-R interval** is very often used as a direct synonym for the beat-to-beat interval, even when the data is sourced from a PPG device.\n5.  A more general, technology-agnostic term is **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**. This term simply refers to the time between consecutive beats and is equally correct for both ECG and PPG data.\n6.  For clinical-grade HRV analysis, it's crucial to analyze only the intervals between normal, sinus-rhythm heartbeats. After filtering out artifacts and ectopic beats, the remaining intervals are called **Normal-to-Normal intervals (N-N intervals)**. Most standard HRV metrics (like SDNN, RMSSD) are calculated from a series of N-N intervals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe value measured between heartbeats has several names. The most common and widely recognized term, originating from ECG and used ubiquitously in HRV literature, is the **R-R interval**. The term **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** is also correct and more general.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
