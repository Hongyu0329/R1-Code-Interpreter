    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The key identifying detail is a specific emotion and memory: the character feels \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This implies a character who has been away from Earth for a significant time and is grappling with profound homesickness, while also feeling that this emotion is a form of weakness or something to be embarrassed about, perhaps from a scientific or professional standpoint.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters Provided in the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist, a psychologist sent from Earth to the Solaris station. The film begins with him on Earth, surrounded by nature, including the sound of rustling leaves. While he is deeply connected to Earth and his past, he has only just arrived at the station. The specific sentiment of being *ashamed* of missing Earth after a long absence doesn't fit his immediate situation. His primary emotional struggle is with the reappearance of his dead wife, Hari.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** Hari is not a human from Earth in the context of the story on the station. She is a \"visitor\" or \"guest,\" a physical manifestation created by the sentient ocean of Solaris from Kris's memories. She has no memory of Earth beyond what Kris's mind provides. Therefore, she could not miss something she has never truly experienced.\n\n*   **C. Snaut:** Dr. Snaut is one of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He is a cyberneticist who has become weary, cynical, and philosophical after his long tenure on the station. He has had years to contemplate his isolation. He often acts as a guide to Kris, explaining the bizarre phenomena and the psychological toll of their situation. A feeling of profound, long-term homesickness coupled with a scientist's shame for such a \"soft\" emotion fits his character perfectly.\n\n*   **D. Sartorius:** Dr. Sartorius is the other surviving scientist. He is depicted as cold, rational, and almost obsessively dedicated to the scientific mission. He represses his emotions and views the \"visitors\" as mere objects of study. It is highly uncharacteristic for Sartorius to admit to a sentimental feeling like homesickness, let alone express shame over it. He would likely view such an emotion as an obstacle to be overcome, not something to confess.\n\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Dr. Gibarian is the scientist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. We only see him through a video message he left for Kris. While he was clearly in deep psychological distress, this specific quote is not attributed to him in his message.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nIn a conversation with Kris Kelvin, it is Dr. Snaut who confesses his feelings of isolation and nostalgia. He reveals his vulnerability, admitting that despite being a man of science, he longs for the simple, terrestrial experience of nature. He specifically states that he misses the sound of rustling leaves and is ashamed of this feeling. This confession highlights the central theme of the film: the conflict between cold, detached science and the inescapable, often painful, human need for connection, memory, and home.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\nThe character who expresses shame over missing the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. This line of dialogue is a key moment that defines his weary, introspective character and contrasts him with the emotionally tormented Kris and the coldly rational Sartorius.\n\n<<<C>>>"
