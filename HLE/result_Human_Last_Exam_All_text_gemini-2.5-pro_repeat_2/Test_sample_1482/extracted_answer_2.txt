Let `Ã` be a Gaussian-based Interval Type-3 Membership Function (IT3 MF) with a fixed mean `c` and an uncertain standard deviation. Let `x` be the primary variable and `u ∈ [0, 1]` be the secondary variable. A vertical cross-section is obtained by fixing the primary input to `x = x_p`. This cross-section is an Interval Type-2 (IT2) MF whose uncertainty is characterized by its Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU). The FOU is bounded by an upper membership function `J̄_{Ã}(x_p, u)` and a lower membership function `J̲_{Ã}(x_p, u)`.

The uncertainty in the standard deviation `σ` is modeled as an interval `[σ̲(u), σ̄(u)]`, where the bounds are linear functions of `u`:
*   `σ̄(u) = σ_U - α_U * u`
*   `σ̲(u) = σ_L - α_L * u`

The parameters `σ_U, σ_L, α_U, α_L` define the shape and scale of the uncertainty.

The mathematical formulation for the upper and lower bounds of the vertical cross-section is given by:

1.  **Upper Bound Formulation:**
    `J̄_{Ã}(x_p, u) = exp[-1/2 * ((x_p - c) / σ̄(u))^2] = exp[-1/2 * ((x_p - c) / (σ_U - α_U * u))^2]`

2.  **Lower Bound Formulation:**
    `J̲_{Ã}(x_p, u) = exp[-1/2 * ((x_p - c) / σ̲(u))^2] = exp[-1/2 * ((x_p - c) / (σ_L - α_L * u))^2]`
