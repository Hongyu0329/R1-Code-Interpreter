    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony no. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the correct musical score.**\nThe piece in question is Antonín Dvořák's Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4. We need to consult the full orchestral score for this work.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the specific musical part.**\nThe question asks for the notes played by the \"first violin\" (Italian: *Violino I*). In a standard orchestral score, this part is typically the highest line within the string section.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the final measures of the symphony.**\nWe must look at the very end of the fourth and final movement (*Finale: Allegro con fuoco*). The symphony ends with the full orchestra playing a powerful chord.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the last three notes for the first violin.**\nBy analyzing the score for the Violino I part, we find the following in the last two measures:\n*   **Penultimate Measure (second to last):** The first violins play two notes, each as a half note. The first note is F5 (the F in the top space of the treble clef). The second note is D5 (the D on the fourth line of the treble clef).\n*   **Final Measure:** The first violins play a single whole note to end the piece. This note is B♭4 (the B-flat on the middle line of the treble clef).\n\n**Step 5: Compare the pitches of the three notes.**\nThe last three notes played in sequence by the first violin are F5, D5, and B♭4. To find the lowest one, we compare their positions on the musical staff or a keyboard:\n*   F5 is the highest of the three.\n*   D5 is lower than F5.\n*   B♭4 is lower than D5.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is essential to look at the correct symphony (No. 2, Op. 4) and not confuse it with his more famous symphonies.\n*   The interpretation of \"ends... on three notes\" refers to the last three note events played in sequence, not a three-note chord (a single instrument playing a single line cannot play a chord in this context).\n*   Correctly reading the notes in the treble clef and accounting for the key signature (B-flat major) is crucial. The final note is B♭, not B natural.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe last three notes are F5, D5, and B♭4. Comparing these, B♭4 is the lowest in pitch.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
