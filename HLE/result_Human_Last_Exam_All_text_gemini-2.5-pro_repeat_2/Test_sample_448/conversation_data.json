    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nFirst, we need to list the elements known as noble gases, which are in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n(Oganesson is also a noble gas but it is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally on Earth, so it is excluded from this analysis).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\". This means we need to consider the total amount of each gas on the entire planet (in the atmosphere, crust, mantle, etc.) relative to the Earth's total mass. However, since noble gases are \"atmophile\" elements, they are most concentrated in the atmosphere. Their relative abundances in the atmosphere are an excellent proxy for their overall rarity on Earth. The year \"2002\" is specified, but the relative abundances of these gases are governed by geological processes and do not change significantly over human timescales. Therefore, data from around that period or even current data is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Abundances of Stable Noble Gases**\nLet's look at the typical concentrations of the stable (non-radioactive or very long-lived) noble gases in Earth's atmosphere, which holds the vast majority of the planet's inventory of these elements. Abundances are listed from most common to least common:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** By far the most common noble gas, making up about 0.934% (9,340 parts per million, ppm) of the atmosphere.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most common, with a concentration of about 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** Third, with a concentration of about 5.2 ppm.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Fourth, with a concentration of about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** The rarest of the *stable* noble gases, with a very low concentration of about 0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion, ppb).\n\nBased on this, Xenon is extremely rare. However, we must still consider Radon.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Special Case of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is different from the other noble gases because it is radioactive and has a very short half-life.\n*   **Source:** Radon is not a primordial element from the Earth's formation. Instead, it is continuously generated by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, which are found in trace amounts throughout the Earth's crust.\n*   **Decay:** The most stable isotope of radon, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. This means that it decays into other elements very quickly after it is formed.\n*   **Accumulation:** Because it decays so rapidly, radon cannot accumulate in the atmosphere or anywhere else to any significant degree. Its concentration is extremely low and highly variable depending on proximity to the ground and local geology.\n*   **Comparison:** The total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is estimated to be in the trillions of kilograms. In stark contrast, the total amount of Radon in the entire atmosphere at any given moment is estimated to be only a few tens of kilograms.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nComparing the total amounts, Radon is present in vastly smaller quantities than any other noble gas, including Xenon. Its fleeting existence, being constantly produced and just as constantly decaying, makes it the rarest noble gas on Earth by a very large margin. This was true in 2002 and remains true today.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Distinguish between naturally occurring and synthetic noble gases.\n*   Recognize that atmospheric abundance is the primary measure for these gases.\n*   Understand the critical difference between the stable noble gases and the radioactive, short-lived nature of Radon.\n*   Note that the year 2002 does not change the fundamental ranking of abundances.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
