    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve definition**\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b\\sin t$\n\nThe value of the parameter `b` is piecewise:\n*   Case 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $b=1$.\n*   Case 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $b=5$.\n\nWe need to understand the shape of the curve for each case.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Case 1 ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$)**\n\nFor this interval, the equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\sin t$\n\nThese are the standard parametric equations for a circle. We can verify this by squaring and adding the equations:\n$x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$\n\nThis is the equation of a unit circle centered at the origin. Since the parameter `t` ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$, we can trace the path:\n*   At $t=0$: $(x, y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$\n*   At $t=\\pi/2$: $(x, y) = (\\cos \\pi/2, \\sin \\pi/2) = (0, 1)$\n*   At $t=\\pi$: $(x, y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$\n\nAs `t` goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, the y-coordinate ($\\sin t$) is always non-negative. This means this part of the curve is the **upper semi-circle** of radius 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Case 2 ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$)**\n\nFor this interval, the equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5\\sin t$\n\nThese are the parametric equations for an ellipse. We can rewrite them to find the Cartesian equation:\n$x = \\cos t \\implies x^2 = \\cos^2 t$\n$y/5 = \\sin t \\implies (y/5)^2 = \\sin^2 t$\nAdding them gives:\n$x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$\n\nThis is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 (along the x-axis) and a semi-major axis of 5 (along the y-axis). Since the parameter `t` ranges from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, we can trace the path:\n*   As $t \\to \\pi^+$: $(x, y) \\to (\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$\n*   At $t=3\\pi/2$: $(x, y) = (\\cos 3\\pi/2, 5\\sin 3\\pi/2) = (0, -5)$\n*   As $t \\to 2\\pi^-$: $(x, y) \\to (\\cos 2\\pi, 5\\sin 2\\pi) = (1, 0)$\n\nAs `t` goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, the y-coordinate ($5\\sin t$) is always non-positive. This means this part of the curve is the **lower semi-ellipse**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the bounding box of the entire figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we first need to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the entire figure. This defines the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **X-coordinates:**\n    *   For the upper semi-circle, $x = \\cos t$ ranges from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(0) = 1$. So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n    *   For the lower semi-ellipse, $x = \\cos t$ ranges over $(-1, 1)$.\n    *   Combining both parts, the overall range for x is $[-1, 1]$.\n    *   The width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-coordinates:**\n    *   For the upper semi-circle, $y = \\sin t$ ranges from $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ down to $\\sin(0)=\\sin(\\pi)=0$. So, $y \\in [0, 1]$. The maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   For the lower semi-ellipse, $y = 5\\sin t$ ranges from $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ up to $5\\sin(\\pi)=5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$. So, $y \\in [-5, 0]$. The minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n    *   Combining both parts, the overall range for y is $[-5, 1]$.\n    *   The height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe bounding box for the entire figure is a rectangle with width 2 and height 6.\n\n**Step 5: Find the smallest circumscribing square and its area**\n\nA square that circumscribes (or \"outcircles\") the figure must be large enough to contain this bounding box. The side length, `s`, of the square must be at least as large as both the width and the height of the bounding box.\n\n*   $s \\ge \\text{width} = 2$\n*   $s \\ge \\text{height} = 6$\n\nTo satisfy both conditions, the smallest possible side length for the square is the maximum of the two dimensions:\n$s = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nThe area of this smallest square is:\nArea = $s^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
