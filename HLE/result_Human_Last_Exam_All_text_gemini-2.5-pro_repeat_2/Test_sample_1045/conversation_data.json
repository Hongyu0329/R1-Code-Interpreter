    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the molecular formula.**\nThe molecule is toluene, which has the chemical formula C7H8.\nThis means the molecule consists of:\n*   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions. A \"contracted Gaussian function\" is a fixed linear combination of primitive Gaussian functions and is also referred to as a \"basis function\". We need to find the total number of these basis functions for the molecule.\n\n*   **For heavy atoms (non-hydrogen atoms), like Carbon:**\n    *   **`6-`**: This part describes the core electrons. The core orbitals (for Carbon, the 1s orbital) are represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF). This single CGF is formed from a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   **`-31G`**: This part describes the valence electrons. The valence orbitals are \"split\" into two parts: an inner and an outer part.\n        *   **`3`**: The inner part of the valence orbitals is described by one CGF per orbital, where each CGF is a combination of **3** PGFs.\n        *   **`1`**: The outer part of the valence orbitals is described by one CGF per orbital, where each CGF consists of a single **1** PGF.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the `6-` part is not applicable.\n    *   We only consider the valence description, `-31G`. The 1s orbital of hydrogen is split into two parts (inner and outer) just like the valence orbitals of the heavy atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs) per atom.**\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n    *   Carbon is in the second period, so it has 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals.\n    *   **Core (1s orbital):** Represented by **1** CGF.\n    *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** These are split into an inner and an outer set of functions.\n        *   **Inner set (from the `-3-`):** One CGF for the 2s orbital and one CGF for each of the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz). This gives 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4** CGFs.\n        *   **Outer set (from the `-1G`):** One CGF for the 2s orbital and one CGF for each of the three 2p orbitals. This gives another 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4** CGFs.\n    *   **Total CGFs per Carbon atom** = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9**.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen only has a 1s valence orbital.\n    *   **Valence (1s orbital):** This is split into an inner and an outer function.\n        *   **Inner function (from the `-3-`):** **1** CGF.\n        *   **Outer function (from the `-1G`):** **1** CGF.\n    *   **Total CGFs per Hydrogen atom** = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the toluene molecule (C7H8).**\nWe sum the CGFs from all atoms in the molecule.\n\n*   Total from 7 Carbon atoms = 7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs\n*   Total from 8 Hydrogen atoms = 8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs\n*   **Total number of CGFs** = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
