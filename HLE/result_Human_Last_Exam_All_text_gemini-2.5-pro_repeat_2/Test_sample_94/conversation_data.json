    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key identifying elements.**\nThe question is asking for a specific person who meets several criteria:\n*   Is a physicist.\n*   Is primarily known for their work in the field of microscopy.\n*   Discovered an important optical effect or principle related to \"real imagery\".\n*   The discovery was prompted by an accidental observation made by a custodial worker.\n*   The observation specifically involved the cleaning of concave mirrors.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"microscopy\" and \"physicist\" criteria.**\nThis narrows down the possibilities to figures who made significant contributions to the physics of microscopy. Candidates might include Ernst Abbe, Frits Zernike, or August Köhler. We must look for one whose discovery story matches the other criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"accidental observation by a custodial worker\" element.**\nThis is a very specific anecdote. Such stories are often well-known in the history of science. We are looking for a story that links a major discovery in microscopy to a janitor or cleaner.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the \"concave mirror\" and \"real imagery\" elements.**\nConcave mirrors are used to gather light and can form real, inverted images. Early microscope illuminators often used a concave mirror as a reflector behind the light source (like a gas lamp or carbon arc) to direct more light towards the condenser. The discovery must be related to the formation of images by the optical system, not just a general observation of light scattering (like the Tyndall effect, which is the principle behind dark-field microscopy, but its discovery story doesn't typically involve a concave mirror).\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the elements to find the correct individual.**\nLet's examine the potential candidates in light of the specific anecdote.\n*   The story of dark-field illumination's inspiration is sometimes told with a janitor sweeping dust into a sunbeam, but this doesn't involve a concave mirror and is often associated with the surgeon Joseph Lister, not a physicist.\n*   The story that perfectly matches all the details is associated with the German physicist **August Köhler**.\n\n**The Story of Köhler's Discovery:**\nIn the late 19th century, August Köhler was working on photomicrography (taking photos through a microscope). A major problem was achieving even illumination. The image of the light source's filament (e.g., from a carbon arc lamp) would be superimposed on the image of the specimen, creating a bright, uneven spot.\n\nThe anecdote states that a cleaning lady smudged the concave reflector mirror of the microscope's lamp while cleaning it. When Köhler next used the microscope, he noticed that while the smudge itself was out of focus, the illumination on his specimen had become remarkably uniform. This accidental diffusion of the light source gave him the crucial insight. He realized that by manipulating the optics to create a real image of the light source at the condenser's front focal plane (instead of at the specimen plane), he could produce perfectly even illumination across the field of view without the filament's image being in focus. This revolutionary principle, developed in 1893, is now known as **Köhler illumination** and is a fundamental technique for high-quality light microscopy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAugust Köhler was a physicist, is famous for his work in microscopy, discovered a principle involving the manipulation of real images in the light path, and the discovery is anecdotally attributed to an observation following a cleaning lady's accidental smudging of a concave mirror. He fits all the criteria perfectly.\n\n<<<August Köhler>>>"
