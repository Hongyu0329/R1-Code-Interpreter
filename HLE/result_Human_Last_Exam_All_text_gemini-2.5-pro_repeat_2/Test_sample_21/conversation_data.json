    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible $\\bmod p$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Connection between Irreducibility mod p and Galois Groups\n\nThe question asks for a natural density of primes, which points towards the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This theorem connects the factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime $p$ to the structure of its Galois group over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nLet $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$ be the Galois group of the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the density of primes $p$ for which the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_p$ belongs to a certain conjugacy class $C$ of $G$ is given by $|C|/|G|$.\n\nThe polynomial $f(x) \\pmod p$ is irreducible if and only if the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_p$ acts on the roots of $f(x)$ as a single cycle of length 7 (a 7-cycle). Therefore, the problem reduces to the following tasks:\n1.  Determine the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  Calculate the proportion of 7-cycles within this group $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Galois Group G of f(x)\n\nTo determine the Galois group, we will use a theorem by I. Schur, which provides a powerful criterion for polynomials of prime degree.\n\n**Schur's Theorem:** If an integer polynomial $f(x)$ of prime degree $p$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and has $p$ distinct real roots, then its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the full symmetric group $S_p$.\n\nWe need to verify that $f(x)$ satisfies the conditions of this theorem for $p=7$.\n\n**Condition 1: Degree is prime.**\nThe degree of $f(x)$ is 7, which is a prime number. This condition is satisfied.\n\n**Condition 2: Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nWe can use Eisenstein's criterion to check for irreducibility. Let's consider the prime $p=2$. The polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. The coefficients are:\n$a_7 = 1$\n$a_6 = 0$\n$a_5 = -14$\n$a_4 = 0$\n$a_3 = 56$\n$a_2 = 0$\n$a_1 = -56$\n$a_0 = 22$\n\nWe check the conditions for Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$:\n-   The leading coefficient $a_7=1$ is not divisible by 2.\n-   All other coefficients $a_6, a_5, \\dots, a_1, a_0$ are divisible by 2: $0, -14, 0, 56, 0, -56, 22$ are all even.\n-   The constant term $a_0 = 22$ is not divisible by $p^2 = 2^2 = 4$.\n\nSince all conditions are met, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Condition 3: All roots are real.**\nTo determine the number of real roots, we analyze the derivative of $f(x)$. The number of distinct real roots of $f'(x)$ gives the number of local extrema of $f(x)$.\n$f'(x) = 7x^6 - 70x^4 + 168x^2 - 56 = 7(x^6 - 10x^4 + 24x^2 - 8)$.\nLet $z = x^2$. The roots of $f'(x)=0$ are related to the roots of the cubic polynomial $h(z) = z^3 - 10z^2 + 24z - 8$.\n-   $h(0) = -8$\n-   $h(1) = 1 - 10 + 24 - 8 = 7$ (A root $z_1$ is in $(0, 1)$)\n-   $h(4) = 64 - 160 + 96 - 8 = -8$ (A root $z_2$ is in $(1, 4)$)\n-   $h(8) = 512 - 640 + 192 - 8 = 56$ (A root $z_3$ is in $(4, 8)$)\n\nSince $h(z)$ has three real roots $z_1, z_2, z_3$ and they are all positive, $f'(x)$ has six distinct real roots: $\\pm\\sqrt{z_1}, \\pm\\sqrt{z_2}, \\pm\\sqrt{z_3}$. This means $f(x)$ has six local extrema.\n\nFor $f(x)$ to have 7 distinct real roots, the values at its local maxima must be positive, and the values at its local minima must be negative. Let the critical points be $\\pm c_1, \\pm c_2, \\pm c_3$ where $c_i = \\sqrt{z_i}$. The values of $f(x)$ at these extrema can be shown to be $22 \\pm 16\\sqrt{2}$.\n-   The local maxima values are $22+16\\sqrt{2} \\approx 44.6$, which are positive.\n-   The local minima values are $22-16\\sqrt{2} \\approx -0.627$, which are negative.\n\nSince the three local maxima are positive and the three local minima are negative, the graph of $f(x)$ must cross the x-axis 7 times. Thus, $f(x)$ has 7 distinct real roots.\n\n**Conclusion on the Galois Group**\nSince $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of prime degree 7 with 7 real roots, by Schur's theorem, its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the symmetric group $S_7$.\n$G = S_7$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Density\n\nWe need to find the proportion of 7-cycles in the group $S_7$.\nThe total number of elements in $S_7$ is $|S_7| = 7! = 5040$.\n\nThe number of $k$-cycles in $S_n$ is given by the formula $\\frac{n P k}{k} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k}$. For a cycle of full length ($k=n$), the number of $n$-cycles in $S_n$ is $\\frac{n!}{n} = (n-1)!$.\nThe number of 7-cycles in $S_7$ is $(7-1)! = 6! = 720$.\n\nThe natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible mod $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total size of the group:\nDensity = $\\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles in } S_7}{|S_7|} = \\frac{6!}{7!} = \\frac{720}{5040} = \\frac{1}{7}$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the conclusion that the Galois group of the polynomial is $S_7$. The density of primes for which the polynomial remains irreducible is the proportion of 7-cycles in $S_7$, which is $1/7$.\n\n<<<1/7>>>"
