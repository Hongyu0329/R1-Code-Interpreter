    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Waskaganish gathering place.**\nThe Waskaganish gathering place refers to the community of Waskaganish, a Cree First Nation community in Quebec, Canada. It is located on the southern shore of the Rupert River, near where it flows into Rupert Bay, which is an arm of James Bay. Its approximate geographical coordinates are 51.19° N latitude and 78.76° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the surrounding provinces and territories.**\nWaskaganish is in Quebec. The provinces and territories that border or are near Quebec are:\n*   **Ontario:** To the west of Quebec. The border runs south from the southern tip of James Bay.\n*   **Nunavut:** To the north of Quebec. Crucially, Nunavut's territory includes almost all the islands in James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** To the east of Quebec.\n*   **New Brunswick:** To the southeast of Quebec.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminate distant options.**\nBy looking at a map of Canada, it's clear that the borders of Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick are very far from Waskaganish, which is situated on the west side of Quebec. Therefore, the closest candidates are Ontario and Nunavut.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the proximity of Ontario.**\nWaskaganish is located on the eastern side of James Bay. The province of Ontario is on the western side of James Bay. The land border between Quebec and Ontario begins at the southernmost point of James Bay and extends south. The closest point of Ontario to Waskaganish is this land border, located to the southwest of the community. Measuring the straight-line distance from Waskaganish to the nearest point on the Ontario border yields a distance of approximately 75-80 kilometers (about 45-50 miles).\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the proximity of Nunavut.**\nThe territory of Nunavut includes the islands within James Bay. The closest of these islands to the Quebec coast near Waskaganish is Charlton Island. Measuring the straight-line distance from Waskaganish to the nearest shoreline of Charlton Island, Nunavut, gives a distance of approximately 95-100 kilometers (about 60 miles). Other islands in James Bay that belong to Nunavut, such as Akimiski Island or the Twin Islands, are even further away from Waskaganish.\n\n**Step 6: Compare the distances and conclude.**\n*   Distance to the closest point in Ontario: ~75-80 km.\n*   Distance to the closest point in Nunavut (Charlton Island): ~95-100 km.\n\nThe comparison shows that the land border with Ontario is closer to Waskaganish than the nearest island belonging to Nunavut.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is essential to know that the islands in James Bay are part of Nunavut, not Quebec or Ontario. This makes Nunavut a potential candidate.\n*   The \"closest point\" is the shortest straight-line distance (as the crow flies) to the border of the province or territory.\n*   Waskaganish is located near the southern end of James Bay, which is geographically close to where the Ontario-Quebec land border begins.\n\nBased on the analysis, the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
