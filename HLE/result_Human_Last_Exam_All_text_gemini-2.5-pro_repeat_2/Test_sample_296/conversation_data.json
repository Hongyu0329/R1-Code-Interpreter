    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (G).\n\n### Step 1: Framework for Counting Subgroups\nThe number of subgroups of a given index `n` in a group `G` can be determined by analyzing the possible transitive actions of `G` on a set of `n` elements. Each such action corresponds to a homomorphism `φ: G -> S_n` with a transitive image. The subgroup itself is the stabilizer of a point in this action. For our problem, `n=4`, so we are interested in homomorphisms `φ: G -> S_4` with a transitive image.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Possible Quotient Groups\nThe Grigorchuk group `G` is a finitely generated infinite torsion 2-group. This means that any finite quotient of `G` must also be a 2-group. We need to find the transitive subgroups of `S_4` that are 2-groups. The transitive subgroups of `S_4` are `C_4` (cyclic group of order 4), `V_4` (Klein four-group, `(Z/2)^2`), `D_4` (dihedral group of order 8), `A_4` (alternating group of order 12), and `S_4` (symmetric group of order 24).\nOf these, the 2-groups are `C_4`, `V_4`, and `D_4`. These are the only possible images for a homomorphism `φ: G -> S_4` with a transitive image.\n\nLet `H` be a subgroup of index 4 in `G`. The action of `G` on the set of left cosets `G/H` gives a homomorphism `φ: G -> S_4`. The kernel of this homomorphism is `K = Core_G(H) = ∩_{g∈G} gHg^{-1}`, which is the largest normal subgroup of `G` contained in `H`. The image `Im(φ)` is isomorphic to `G/K`. So, `G/K` must be isomorphic to `C_4`, `V_4`, or `D_4`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Case `G/K ≅ C_4`\nIf `G/K` were isomorphic to `C_4`, `G` would have `C_4` as a quotient. Any homomorphism from `G` to an abelian group (like `C_4`) must factor through the abelianization of `G`, which is `G_{ab} = G/[G,G]`.\nIt is a well-known property of the Grigorchuk group that its abelianization is `G/[G,G] ≅ (Z/2)^3`.\nThe group `(Z/2)^3` is an elementary abelian 2-group, meaning every non-identity element has order 2. It cannot have a cyclic group of order 4 (`C_4`) as a quotient, because `C_4` contains an element of order 4.\nTherefore, `G` cannot have `C_4` as a quotient, and no subgroup of index 4 can arise from this case.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Case `G/K ≅ V_4`\nIn this case, `G/K` is abelian (`V_4 ≅ (Z/2)^2`). This implies that the kernel `K` must contain the commutator subgroup `[G,G]`.\nLet `H` be a subgroup of index 4 such that `Core_G(H) = K` and `G/K ≅ V_4`. Since `H/K` is a subgroup of the abelian group `G/K`, `H/K` must be normal in `G/K`. This implies that `H` must be a normal subgroup of `G`. If `H` is normal, then `H = Core_G(H) = K`.\nSo, we are looking for normal subgroups `H` of index 4 in `G` such that `G/H ≅ V_4`.\nAs argued before, since `G/H` is abelian, `H` must contain `[G,G]`. This means that such subgroups `H` are in one-to-one correspondence with normal subgroups of index 4 in `G/[G,G]`.\nWe need to find the number of subgroups of index 4 in `(Z/2)^3`. A subgroup of index 4 in this group of order 8 must have order `8/4 = 2`.\nThe number of subgroups of order 2 in `(Z/2)^3` is equal to the number of non-identity elements, which is `2^3 - 1 = 7`.\nEach of these corresponds to a normal subgroup of `G` of index 4. So, there are **7** such subgroups.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Case `G/K ≅ D_4`\nThis case corresponds to subgroups `H` of index 4 where `G/Core_G(H) ≅ D_4`. This requires that `G` has the dihedral group of order 8, `D_4`, as a quotient.\nIt is a known, non-trivial result from the theory of the Grigorchuk group that it has a **unique** normal subgroup `K` such that `G/K ≅ D_4`. This normal subgroup is the stabilizer of the second level of the binary tree, `St_G(2)`.\n\nGiven this unique normal subgroup `K`, we now count the number of subgroups `H` of index 4 for which `Core_G(H) = K`.\nBy the correspondence theorem, such subgroups `H` correspond to subgroups `H' = H/K` of `G/K ≅ D_4`.\nThe condition `[G:H] = 4` implies `[G/K : H/K] = 4`. Since `|G/K| = |D_4| = 8`, this means `|H/K| = 8/4 = 2`.\nThe condition `Core_G(H) = K` implies that `H/K` must be a core-free subgroup of `G/K`. A subgroup `H'` is core-free if the intersection of all its conjugates is the trivial subgroup. This is equivalent to `H'` not containing any non-trivial normal subgroup of the parent group.\nSo, we need to count the number of core-free subgroups of order 2 in `D_4`.\nA subgroup of order 2 in `D_4` is generated by an involution. `D_4` has 5 involutions:\n1.  The rotation by 180 degrees, `r^2`. This element is in the center of `D_4`, so the subgroup `<r^2>` is normal. It is not core-free.\n2.  The four reflections `s, sr, sr^2, sr^3`. None of these are normal. The conjugacy classes of the corresponding subgroups of order 2 are `{<s>, <sr^2>}` and `{<sr>, <sr^3>}`. The intersection of the subgroups in each class is the trivial subgroup, so they are all core-free.\nThus, there are **4** core-free subgroups of order 2 in `D_4`. Each of these corresponds to a unique subgroup `H` of `G` of index 4.\n\n### Step 6: Final Count\nThe subgroups from Step 4 and Step 5 are distinct. The subgroups from Step 4 are normal (`H=K`) with an abelian quotient `G/H ≅ V_4`. The subgroups from Step 5 are not normal (`H ≠ K`) and have a non-abelian quotient `G/Core_G(H) ≅ D_4`.\n\nTotal number of subgroups of index 4 = (Number from `V_4` case) + (Number from `D_4` case)\nTotal = 7 + 4 = 11.\n\nThere are 7 normal subgroups of index 4 and 4 non-normal subgroups of index 4, making a total of 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
