    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Terms**\n\nTo understand the question, we must first define each key term:\n\n*   **Continuum:** In this context, a continuum is a compact and connected metric space. Examples include a line segment, a disk, or a circle.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means there is a homeomorphism from the space to a subset of the plane. The circle is planar; the surface of a donut (a torus) is not.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $x$ and $y$ in $X$, there exists a homeomorphism $h: X \\to X$ (a continuous map with a continuous inverse from the space onto itself) such that $h(x) = y$. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" from every point. For example, a circle is homogeneous because any point can be rotated to any other point. A line segment is not homogeneous because you cannot map an endpoint to an interior point via a homeomorphism of the segment onto itself.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** This is a collection of all topological spaces that are homeomorphic to each other. The question asks for the number of these collections, which is equivalent to asking for the number of topologically distinct spaces that meet all the given criteria.\n\nSo, the question is: How many topologically distinct, compact, connected, planar spaces are there that look the same from every point?\n\n### **Step 2: The Main Division of the Problem**\n\nThe classification of homogeneous planar continua is a deep and classical problem in topology. The crucial property that allows for a systematic classification is whether or not the continuum separates the plane. A subset $X \\subset R^2$ separates the plane if its complement, $R^2 \\setminus X$, is disconnected.\n\nWe can therefore divide all homogeneous planar continua into two disjoint sets:\n1.  Those that **separate** the plane.\n2.  Those that **do not separate** the plane.\n\nWe will analyze the number of homeomorphism classes in each case.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of Continua that Separate the Plane**\n\nThis case was completely resolved by J. T. Rogers, Jr. in 1983.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It was known since the 1920s (by Mazurkiewicz) that if a homogeneous planar continuum is also *locally connected*, it must be a **simple closed curve (the circle)**.\n*   **The Main Result:** Rogers proved that there are exactly **two** homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua that separate the plane. They are:\n    1.  **The Circle:** This is the familiar unit circle, $S^1$. It is the only one that is locally connected.\n    2.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** This is a much more exotic object. It can be constructed as a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged in the shape of a circle. Unlike the circle, it is not locally connected. Every point in this space has a neighborhood that looks like a pseudo-arc, not a simple arc.\n\nSo, for the case of continua that separate the plane, we have exactly **2** distinct homeomorphism classes.\n\n### **Step 4: Analysis of Continua that Do Not Separate the Plane**\n\nThese continua are necessarily \"tree-like,\" meaning they do not contain any simple closed curves.\n\n*   **The First Example:** The first such object discovered was the **pseudo-arc**, shown to be homogeneous by R. H. Bing in 1948. It is a one-dimensional, chainable, tree-like, and indecomposable continuum. For a long time, it was conjectured that the pseudo-arc was the only homogeneous planar continuum that does not separate the plane.\n*   **The Resolution of the Conjecture:** This conjecture turned out to be false. Building on work by Rogers and others, L. G. Oversteegen and E. D. Tymchatyn proved in 1991 that there are, in fact, an **uncountably infinite** number of non-homeomorphic, tree-like, homogeneous planar continua. The cardinality of this set of classes is that of the continuum ($c = |\\mathbb{R}|$).\n\nSo, for the case of continua that do not separate the plane, we have a **continuum** of distinct homeomorphism classes (which includes the pseudo-arc as one specific member).\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nTo find the total number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua, we sum the number of classes from each case:\n\n*   Number of classes that separate the plane = 2\n*   Number of classes that do not separate the plane = continuum (uncountably infinite)\n\nTotal Number = 2 + (continuum) = continuum.\n\nThe addition of two finite classes to an uncountably infinite set does not change its cardinality. Therefore, the total number of such classes is uncountably infinite.\n\n<<<A continuum (uncountably infinite)>>>"
