    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source Text:** William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*.\n    *   **Character Action:** A character must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Character's Narration:** This character describes the religious practices they observed there.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The description must be recognizable to the reader as a reference to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Review the Characters and Plot of *The House of the Wolfings***:\n    *   The novel is about a Gothic tribe, the Wolfings, defending their home in Mirkwood against the advancing Roman army.\n    *   The main characters include Thiodolf (the war-leader), Wood-Sun (his semi-divine foster daughter), and Hall-Sun (his mortal daughter). Most of the Wolfing characters have spent their lives within the lands of Mirkwood.\n    *   To have visited a Roman city, a character would likely need a unique backstory, such as having been a traveler, a merchant, or a captive.\n\n3.  **Identify the Character with the Correct Backstory:**\n    *   There is a specific character in the novel who fits this description: **Otter**.\n    *   Otter is a thrall (a bondsman or slave) of the Wolfings.\n    *   His backstory, as revealed in the novel, is that he was captured by the Romans in his youth. He spent several years as a slave in the Roman Empire before managing to escape and make his way back to his people.\n    *   This experience makes him the Wolfings' primary source of information about Roman culture, military tactics, and society.\n\n4.  **Locate the Specific Scene and Description:**\n    *   In Chapter VI, titled \"Otter tells of the Romans,\" the Wolfings gather to hear from Otter about the enemy they are about to face.\n    *   During his speech, Otter describes the city he was taken to. He talks about its great buildings and the strange ways of its people.\n    *   He then describes their gods and their worship. He mentions seeing an image or statue that is central to their identity.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Description for the Romulus and Remus Reference:**\n    *   Otter describes an image of a **\"she-wolf of brass\"** who is shown nursing **\"two man-children\"**.\n    *   From his perspective as an outsider, he is simply describing what he saw literally.\n    *   For the reader familiar with Roman mythology, this is an unmistakable reference to the *Lupa Capitolina* (the Capitoline Wolf), the famous bronze statue depicting the she-wolf suckling the twin infants Romulus and Remus, the mythical founders of Rome.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Perspective is Key:** The description is effective because it's told from the point of view of someone who doesn't understand the myth. Otter sees a strange statue, while the reader understands its profound significance to the Romans.\n*   **Thematic Irony:** Morris creates a powerful irony. The Wolfings, who derive their name and identity from the wolf, are fighting an enemy that also has a wolf at the very heart of its founding story.\n*   **Character Role:** Otter's role as a former captive is crucial to the plot, as his knowledge gives the Wolfings a chance to understand and counter their powerful enemy. This scene firmly establishes his expertise.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the character who has been to a Roman city and describes the iconography of Romulus and Remus.\n\nThe character is **Otter**.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
