    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question and Define Key Terms\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. From a symmetry perspective, this means the point group must contain at least one roto-inversion axis ($\\bar{n}$) or a mirror plane (m). Note that a center of inversion ($\\bar{1}$) and a mirror plane (m, which is equivalent to $\\bar{2}$) are types of roto-inversion symmetry operations.\n2.  **Non-polar:** For any direction in the crystal, the opposite direction is symmetrically equivalent. This means the point group is not one of the 10 polar (pyroelectric) classes, which are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light. In the conventional sense, the absolute requirement for optical activity is **chirality**. Chiral crystal classes are those that lack *any* roto-inversion or mirror symmetry.\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Resolve the Contradiction\n\nThere is a fundamental contradiction between condition #1 (achiral) and condition #3 (have the correct symmetry for optical activity).\n*   Condition #1 requires the presence of a mirror or roto-inversion symmetry.\n*   Condition #3, in its standard definition, requires the *absence* of all mirror and roto-inversion symmetries.\n\nA literal interpretation would mean that no such crystal classes exist. However, in advanced crystal physics, the term \"optical activity\" can also refer to a more subtle effect. This effect, caused by first-order spatial dispersion, allows for optical rotation in specific directions within certain **achiral, non-centrosymmetric** crystals. For this analysis to yield a non-empty set, we must assume the question is referring to this nuanced phenomenon.\n\nThe symmetry requirement for this subtle optical activity is that the crystal class must be **non-centrosymmetric** (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion, $\\bar{1}$).\n\n### Step 3: Systematically Filter the 32 Crystal Classes\n\nWe will now filter all 32 point groups based on the three conditions, using the nuanced interpretation of \"optical activity\".\n\n**A. Start with the condition of being Non-centrosymmetric.**\nThis is a prerequisite for any form of optical activity. This leaves us with the 21 non-centrosymmetric point groups.\n\n**B. Apply the \"Achiral\" condition.**\nFrom the 21 non-centrosymmetric groups, we must select those that are achiral. This means we eliminate the 11 truly chiral (enantiomorphic) classes.\nThis leaves the 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes:\n`m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm,  4,  6,  42m,  6m2,  43m`\n\n**C. Apply the \"Non-polar\" condition.**\nFrom the list of 10 classes above, we must remove any that are polar. The polar classes are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}. The classes to remove from our list are: `m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm`.\nAfter removing these, we are left with the following classes that are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric:\n`$\\bar{4}$`, `$\\bar{6}$`, `$\\bar{4}2m$`, `$\\bar{6}m2$`, `$\\bar{4}3m$`\n\n### Step 4: Final Check for Optical Activity\n\nNow we must perform the final check: which of these five remaining classes actually permit optical rotation due to spatial dispersion? This depends on the specific symmetry of the third-rank tensor ($\\gamma_{ijk}$) that governs this effect.\n\n*   **Class $\\bar{4}$:** Can exhibit optical activity for light propagating perpendicular to the main axis. **Qualifies.**\n*   **Class $\\bar{6}$:** The symmetry of this class (which includes a horizontal mirror plane) causes all components of the relevant tensor to be zero. No optical activity is possible. **Does not qualify.**\n*   **Class $\\bar{4}2m$:** Can exhibit optical activity for light propagating along its optic axes. **Qualifies.**\n*   **Class $\\bar{6}m2$:** The symmetry of this class (which includes a horizontal mirror plane) also causes all components of the relevant tensor to be zero. **Does not qualify.**\n*   **Class $\\bar{4}3m$:** Can exhibit optical activity. **Qualifies.**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and still possess the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity (in specific directions due to spatial dispersion) are those that survived our filtering process.\n\n<<<The crystal classes are $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, and $\\bar{4}3m$.>>>"
