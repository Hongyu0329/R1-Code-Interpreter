The first and most critical adjustment Charles needs to make is to his diet, specifically its extreme level of restriction. A diet that severely limits protein, fat, and carbohydrates all at the same time is unsustainable. This approach leads to low energy, constant hunger, and is nearly impossible to maintain, especially with his travel-heavy lifestyle. He should adjust his diet to be more balanced, ensuring he gets adequate protein for satiety and muscle preservation, healthy fats for hormone function, and complex carbohydrates for energy, particularly as he plans to start exercising. Creating a moderate and sustainable nutritional plan is the necessary first step before he can successfully incorporate other changes like exercise.
