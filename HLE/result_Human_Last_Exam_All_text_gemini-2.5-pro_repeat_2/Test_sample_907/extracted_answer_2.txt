The equation for the absorption cross-section is derived using first-order time-dependent perturbation theory for a system interacting with a Gaussian laser pulse of carrier frequency $\omega$ and duration $\tau$.

**a) No interaction between molecules:**
The absorption cross-section is the sum of the cross-sections of N independent molecules. The spectrum is a set of Gaussian peaks located at the transition frequencies ($\omega_{ak}$) of a single molecule.
$$ \sigma_a(\omega) = N \left( \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}\tau}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} \right) \sum_{k<E_F, a>E_F} \omega_{ak} |\vec{\mu}_{ak} \cdot \vec{\epsilon}|^2 e^{-(\omega_{ak}-\omega)^2 \tau^2 / 2} $$

**b) Near-neighbor interaction:**
The interaction results in the formation of exciton bands. The selection rule concentrates the total oscillator strength of each band into the $K=0$ state. The spectrum consists of a series of Gaussian peaks, each corresponding to a $K=0$ exciton state. The peak positions are shifted relative to the non-interacting case by the Coulombic interaction.
$$ \sigma_b(\omega) = N \left( \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}\tau}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} \right) \sum_{k<E_F, a>E_F} \omega_{K=0, ak} |\vec{\mu}_{ak} \cdot \vec{\epsilon}|^2 e^{-(\omega_{K=0, ak}-\omega)^2 \tau^2 / 2} $$
