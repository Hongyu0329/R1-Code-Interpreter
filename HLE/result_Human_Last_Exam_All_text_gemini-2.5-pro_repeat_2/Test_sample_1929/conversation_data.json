    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene)**\n    *   Structure: CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂\n    *   Classification: It is a conjugated diene, a molecule with two double bonds separated by a single bond. It will act as the \"diene\" component in a Diels-Alder reaction, providing 4 π-electrons.\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**\n    *   Structure: CCl₂=CF₂\n    *   Classification: It is a substituted alkene. The presence of electron-withdrawing halogen atoms (Cl and F) makes it an \"electron-poor\" alkene, which is a very good \"dienophile\" for the Diels-Alder reaction. It provides 2 π-electrons.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a type of [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the General Structure of the Product**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted process where three π bonds are broken and two new σ bonds and one new π bond are formed, resulting in a cyclohexene derivative.\n*   The four carbons of the diene (C1 to C4) and the two carbons of the dienophile (C5 and C6) form the six-membered ring.\n*   New single bonds (σ bonds) form between C1(diene)-C5(dienophile) and C4(diene)-C6(dienophile) (or C1-C6 and C4-C5).\n*   A new double bond (π bond) forms between C2 and C3 of the original diene.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Regiochemistry**\nSince the dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂) is unsymmetrical (the two ends of the double bond are different), two different constitutional isomers (regioisomers) can be formed. We need to determine which one is the major product.\n*   **Isomer A:** C1 of butadiene bonds to the CF₂ carbon, and C4 bonds to the CCl₂ carbon.\n*   **Isomer B:** C1 of butadiene bonds to the CCl₂ carbon, and C4 bonds to the CF₂ carbon.\n\nThe regioselectivity of the Diels-Alder reaction is explained by Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory. The reaction is controlled by the interaction between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile. The major product arises from the orientation that allows for the best overlap of these orbitals, which corresponds to matching the atoms with the largest orbital coefficients.\n\n*   **HOMO of 1,3-butadiene:** The terminal carbons (C1 and C4) have the largest orbital coefficients.\n*   **LUMO of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene:** We need to determine which carbon (the one bonded to F atoms or the one bonded to Cl atoms) has the larger LUMO coefficient. Fluorine is much more electronegative than chlorine, and its electron-withdrawing inductive effect is stronger. This makes the CF₂ carbon more electron-deficient (more electrophilic). In the LUMO of an electron-poor alkene, the more electrophilic carbon has the larger orbital coefficient. Therefore, the CF₂ carbon has the larger coefficient in the LUMO.\n\nTo form the major product, the atoms with the largest coefficients align. Thus, C1 of butadiene (large HOMO coefficient) will bond to the CF₂ carbon of the dienophile (large LUMO coefficient). Consequently, C4 of butadiene will bond to the CCl₂ carbon. This corresponds to **Isomer A**.\n\n**Step 4: Draw and Name the Final Product**\nLet's draw the major product (Isomer A) and determine its correct IUPAC name.\n1.  The reaction connects C1 of butadiene to the CF₂ carbon and C4 of butadiene to the CCl₂ carbon.\n2.  This forms a cyclohexene ring where the double bond is between the original C2 and C3 of butadiene.\n3.  The structure formed is a cyclohexene ring with a -CCl₂- group and a -CF₂- group on adjacent carbons.\n\n    Let's draw the ring skeleton and number it according to IUPAC rules:\n    *   The double bond is the principal functional group and its carbons are numbered 1 and 2.\n    *   The ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. Both numbering directions (clockwise or counter-clockwise) result in the locant set {4,4,5,5}.\n    *   When there is a tie in locant sets, we assign the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n    *   The substituents are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\". Alphabetically, \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\".\n    *   Therefore, the CCl₂ group must be assigned the lower locant, which is 4. The CF₂ group is at position 5.\n\n    The structure corresponding to the major product is:\n    ```\n          CH₂(6) -- CF₂(5)\n         /          \\\n       CH(1)          CCl₂(4)\n       ||             /\n       CH(2) --------- CH₂(3)\n    ```\nThe resulting IUPAC name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   **Reactants:** 1,3-butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n*   **Reaction:** Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The reaction is regioselective. FMO theory predicts that the terminal carbon of the diene will preferentially attack the more electrophilic CF₂ carbon of the dienophile.\n*   **Product:** The major product is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
