    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The central figure is Andre Vernault.\n2.  **Identify the Context:**\n    *   **Time:** World War II.\n    *   **Location:** United Kingdom.\n    *   **Circumstance:** Vernault was a Belgian refugee who had fled the Nazi occupation.\n    *   **Interaction:** He was interrogated by British counterintelligence (MI5).\n3.  **Identify the Problem:** MI5 falsely believed Vernault was a German spy.\n4.  **Identify the Reason for Suspicion:** The key reason for this false belief was that Vernault \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\"\n5.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks to identify this \"true profession\" that he concealed.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Motivation for Concealment:** The profession must be something a person in the 1940s might be embarrassed or ashamed to admit, especially to stern military interrogators. It needed to be a plausible reason for deception, other than being a spy.\n*   **MI5's Perspective:** British counterintelligence was on high alert for \"sleeper\" agents arriving among genuine refugees. Any deviation from a straightforward story, any lie or omission, was immediately viewed as a sign of espionage training. They mistook Vernault's personal shame for professional guile.\n*   **The Nature of the Profession:** The profession is the lynchpin of the entire story. It is not illegal or directly related to the war, but it is unusual and was considered, at the time, to be an effeminate or peculiar occupation for a man.\n\n### Step-by-Step Path to the Answer\n\n1.  Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee, arrived in the UK in 1941 and was taken to Camp 020 (Latchmere House), a top-secret MI5 interrogation center for suspected enemy agents.\n2.  During interrogation, he was evasive and untruthful about his background, particularly his profession. He claimed to be a commercial artist.\n3.  His interrogators, trained to spot deception, did not believe him. They concluded that his evasiveness was the hallmark of a trained German agent trying to hide his true mission. They codenamed him GANDER and spent months trying to \"break\" him or turn him into a double agent.\n4.  Eventually, the truth was discovered. Vernault was not a spy. His deception stemmed entirely from profound embarrassment about his actual line of work.\n5.  His true profession was a **corset designer**. He designed women's foundation garments. In the context of a wartime interrogation by military officers, he was too ashamed to admit to what he felt was a non-masculine profession. This personal shame was misinterpreted by MI5 as the deceit of a spy.\n\n<<<corset designer>>>"
