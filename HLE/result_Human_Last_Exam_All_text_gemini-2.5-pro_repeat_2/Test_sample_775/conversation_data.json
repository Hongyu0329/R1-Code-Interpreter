    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   Let S be the unit square in the plane: S = [0, 1] x [0, 1].\n    *   We are given two sets, A and B, which are subsets of S.\n    *   The properties of A and B are:\n        *   A is closed.\n        *   B is closed.\n        *   A is connected.\n        *   B is connected.\n        *   Their union is the square: A ∪ B = S.\n    *   We need to analyze their intersection, I = A ∩ B.\n    *   The goal is to find the maximum possible number of connected components of I. A connected component is a maximal connected subset.\n\n2.  **Initial Thoughts and Simple Cases:**\n    *   **Case 1: One Component.** Let A be the left half of the square, A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1]. Let B be the right half, B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1]. Both A and B are closed and connected, and their union is S. Their intersection I = A ∩ B is the vertical line segment {1/2} x [0, 1]. This is a connected set, so it has 1 component. This shows that 1 is a possible number of components.\n    *   **Properties of the Intersection:** Since A and B are closed sets, their intersection I = A ∩ B is also a closed set.\n\n3.  **Exploring More Complex Cases (The \"Interlocking Combs\" Construction):**\n    *   The key to getting multiple components in the intersection is to construct A and B in a way that they touch each other in multiple, disconnected places.\n    *   Let's try to construct an example that yields `k` components for an arbitrary integer `k ≥ 2`.\n    *   **Step 3.1: Define the components of the intersection.** We want the intersection I to have `k` components. Let's design these components as `k` disjoint horizontal line segments in the middle of the square.\n        *   Let the `k` components be `I_j = [1/3, 2/3] x {y_j}` for `j=1, ..., k`. These are `k` horizontal line segments. To make them disjoint, we can choose `y_j = j/(k+1)`. The set `I = U_{j=1 to k} I_j` has `k` connected components.\n\n    *   **Step 3.2: Construct Set A.** We need to build a closed, connected set A such that `I ⊂ A`. To make A connected, we can think of it as a \"comb\" shape.\n        *   Let the \"spine\" of the comb be the left third of the square: `A_spine = [0, 1/3] x [0, 1]`.\n        *   Let the \"teeth\" of the comb be horizontal strips that connect the spine to the components of `I`. To ensure A and B will cover the whole square, A's teeth will cover the regions *between* the desired intersection lines.\n        *   Let's redefine the `y` coordinates for clarity. Let `y_i = i / (2k)` for `i = 0, 1, ..., 2k`. Our intersection lines will be at `y_1, y_3, y_5, ...`.\n        *   Let A's teeth be the strips `[1/3, 2/3] x [y_{2j}, y_{2j+1}]` for `j=0, ..., k-1`.\n        *   Define `A = ([0, 1/3] x [0, 1]) ∪ (U_{j=0 to k-1} [1/3, 2/3] x [y_{2j}, y_{2j+1}])`.\n        *   This set A is closed. It is also connected because each \"tooth\" is a closed rectangle connected to the connected \"spine\".\n\n    *   **Step 3.3: Construct Set B.** We construct B similarly, like another comb whose teeth interlock with A's teeth.\n        *   Let the \"spine\" of B be the right third of the square: `B_spine = [2/3, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n        *   Let the \"teeth\" of B cover the remaining area in the middle third.\n        *   Define `B = ([2/3, 1] x [0, 1]) ∪ (U_{j=1 to k} [1/3, 2/3] x [y_{2j-1}, y_{2j}])`.\n        *   This set B is closed and connected for the same reasons as A.\n\n    *   **Step 3.4: Verify the Conditions.**\n        *   **A, B are closed and connected:** Verified above.\n        *   **A ∪ B = S?**\n            *   The left third `[0, 1/3]x[0,1]` is in A.\n            *   The right third `[2/3, 1]x[0,1]` is in B.\n            *   The middle third `[1/3, 2/3]x[0,1]` is covered by the union of all teeth from A and B. The union of the `y`-intervals of the teeth is `(U_{j=0 to k-1} [y_{2j}, y_{2j+1}]) ∪ (U_{j=1 to k} [y_{2j-1}, y_{2j}]) = [y_0, y_1] U [y_1, y_2] U ... U [y_{2k-1}, y_{2k}] = [y_0, y_{2k}] = [0, 1]`. So the middle third is covered.\n            *   Therefore, A ∪ B = S.\n\n        *   **What is the intersection I = A ∩ B?**\n            *   The spines of A and B are disjoint.\n            *   The teeth of A and the spine of B are disjoint.\n            *   The teeth of B and the spine of A are disjoint.\n            *   The only remaining intersection is between the teeth of A and the teeth of B.\n            *   `I = (U_{j=0..k-1} [1/3, 2/3]x[y_{2j}, y_{2j+1}]) ∩ (U_{m=1..k} [1/3, 2/3]x[y_{2m-1}, y_{2m}])`.\n            *   The intersection of two teeth occurs only at their shared boundary. This happens when `y_{2j+1} = y_{2m-1}`. This implies `2j+1 = 2m-1`, so `j=m-1`.\n            *   The intersection is the set of horizontal lines `U_{j=1 to k} [1/3, 2/3] x {y_{2j-1}}`.\n            *   This is a set of `k` disjoint horizontal line segments.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The \"interlocking combs\" construction allows us to create an example where the intersection `A ∩ B` has exactly `k` connected components.\n    *   Since we can do this for any arbitrary positive integer `k`, there is no finite upper bound on the number of components.\n    *   Therefore, there is no largest number of components. The number can be arbitrarily large.\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
