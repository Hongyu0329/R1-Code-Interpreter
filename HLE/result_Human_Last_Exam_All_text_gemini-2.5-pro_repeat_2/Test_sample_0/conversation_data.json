    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nA critical-level view is a theory in population ethics that evaluates the goodness of a population. It is a modification of Total Utilitarianism.\n\n*   **Total Utilitarianism:** The value of a population is the sum of the welfare (or utility) of all individuals in it. Value = Σ(uᵢ).\n*   **Critical-Level View:** This view introduces a \"critical level\" of welfare, let's call it `c`, which is greater than zero. A life is only considered a positive contribution to the world's value if its welfare level is *above* this critical level. The value of a population is calculated as the sum of each individual's welfare minus the critical level.\n    *   Value = Σ(uᵢ - c)\n*   **Implication:**\n    *   If a person's welfare `u` is greater than `c`, adding them to the population increases its total value.\n    *   If a person's welfare `u` is less than `c` (but still positive, i.e., their life is worth living for them), adding them to the population *decreases* its total value.\n    *   If a person's welfare `u` is equal to `c`, adding them has a neutral effect on the population's value.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Theorem\n\nArrhenius's impossibility theorems show that several intuitively desirable conditions for a population axiology cannot all be satisfied at the same time. Let's analyze the conditions provided in the answer choices.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This principle states that a perfectly equal population is better than a population of the same size with a lower average welfare and where at least one person is worse off. Critical-level views satisfy this. If two populations have the same number of people, the one with the higher average welfare will also have a higher sum of (uᵢ - c).\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This principle states that adding a person with positive welfare is never worse than adding a person with negative welfare (a life full of suffering). Let's say we add a person with positive welfare `u > 0` or a person with negative welfare `v < 0`. The change in value would be `(u - c)` vs. `(v - c)`. Since `u` is always greater than `v`, `(u - c)` will always be greater than `(v - c)`. Thus, critical-level views satisfy Weak Non-Sadism.\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This principle states that there is at least *some* situation where adding a number of people with high-quality lives makes the world better. For a critical-level view, if we add people with a welfare level `u` that is higher than the critical level `c`, the total value of the population increases. So, this condition is satisfied.\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This principle is designed to avoid the \"Repugnant Conclusion\" of Total Utilitarianism. It states that for any chosen welfare level `w > 0`, there exists a number of people `n` living at a very high welfare level `h` that is at least as good as *any* number of people `m` living at welfare level `w`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze which condition Critical-Level Views Violate\n\nLet's focus on **Non-Elitism**. This condition must hold for *any* positive welfare level `w`. Let's test it against a critical-level view with a critical level `c > 0`.\n\n1.  **Choose a scenario:**\n    *   Let the critical level be `c`.\n    *   Choose a very high welfare level `h` (e.g., h = 100).\n    *   The Non-Elitism condition says we must be able to find a population of `n` people at level `h` that is better than *any* population of `m` people at level `w`, for *any* `w > 0`.\n2.  **Test the condition:**\n    *   Let's pick a specific welfare level `w` that is positive but also *above the critical level c*. For example, let `c = 10` and let's choose `w = 11`.\n    *   According to the critical-level view, the value of a population of `n` people at the high level `h=100` is: `V_h = n * (100 - c) = n * (90)`.\n    *   The value of a population of `m` people at level `w=11` is: `V_w = m * (11 - c) = m * (1)`.\n3.  **Check for violation:**\n    *   Non-Elitism requires that there is *some* fixed number `n` such that `V_h ≥ V_w` for *all possible values of m*.\n    *   This means we need to find an `n` such that `n * 90 ≥ m * 1` for all `m`.\n    *   However, the value `m * 1` can be made arbitrarily large simply by increasing `m` (the number of people). For any fixed `n` we choose, we can always find an `m` that is large enough to make `m * 1` greater than `n * 90`. (For example, if we pick `n=1`, `V_h = 90`. If we then pick `m=91`, `V_w = 91`, which is greater than 90).\n    *   Therefore, there is no such `n` that satisfies the condition for *all* `m`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCritical-level views violate the **Non-Elitism** condition. Because they behave like Total Utilitarianism for lives above the critical level, they are susceptible to a version of the Repugnant Conclusion, which Non-Elitism is designed to prevent. The other listed conditions are generally satisfied by critical-level views.\n\n<<<C>>>"
