    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Grand Canonical Ensemble and the Partition Function**\n\nThe grand canonical ensemble describes a quantum system that can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir at a fixed temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$. The partition function, denoted by $Z$, is the central quantity in this ensemble. It is defined as the trace of the statistical operator $e^{-\\beta \\hat{K}}$:\n\n$Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta \\hat{K}}]$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature ($k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant).\n*   $\\hat{K}$ is the grand canonical Hamiltonian operator, defined as $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N}$.\n*   $\\hat{H}$ is the system's Hamiltonian operator.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   $\\text{Tr}[...]$ denotes the trace over a complete set of states in the Fock space.\n\n**2. Interpret the Given Hamiltonian**\n\nThe question specifies that the system's Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. This is an unusual system where the energy is directly and negatively proportional to the number of particles. We must substitute this specific $\\hat{H}$ into the general formula for the grand canonical operator $\\hat{K}$.\n\n$\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N} = (-\\mu \\hat{N}) - \\mu \\hat{N} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$\n\nSo, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n\n$Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta (-2\\mu \\hat{N})}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}}]$\n\n**3. Formulate the Path Integral**\n\nThe problem requires using the path integral formalism. This is a method to calculate the trace using functional integration over fields. For a system of bosons, we use coherent state path integrals.\n\n*   **Assumption:** The notation $\\hat{H}$ and $\\hat{N}$ without any mode index (like a subscript $k$) suggests we are dealing with a simple system having only a single bosonic mode. The creation and annihilation operators for this mode are $\\hat{a}^\\dagger$ and $\\hat{a}$, and the number operator is $\\hat{N} = \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{a}$.\n*   The partition function $Z$ can be written as a path integral over complex-valued fields $\\phi(\\tau)$ that are periodic in imaginary time $\\tau$ with period $\\beta$, i.e., $\\phi(0) = \\phi(\\beta)$.\n\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*(\\tau), \\phi(\\tau)] e^{-S[\\phi^*, \\phi]}$\n\n*   The action $S$ is given by:\n\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left( \\phi^*(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\phi(\\tau) + K(\\phi^*(\\tau), \\phi(\\tau)) \\right)$\n\nwhere $K(\\phi^*, \\phi)$ is the coherent state expectation value (or normal-ordered symbol) of the operator $\\hat{K}$. For our operator $\\hat{K} = -2\\mu \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{a}$, this is:\n\n$K(\\phi^*, \\phi) = \\frac{\\langle \\phi | -2\\mu \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{a} | \\phi \\rangle}{\\langle \\phi | \\phi \\rangle} = -2\\mu \\phi^* \\phi$\n\n*   Substituting this into the action gives:\n\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left( \\phi^* \\partial_\\tau \\phi - 2\\mu \\phi^* \\phi \\right) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\phi(\\tau)$\n\n**4. Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nThe path integral is now a Gaussian integral over the fields:\n\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] \\exp\\left( -\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\phi(\\tau) \\right)$\n\nThe value of such a functional integral is given by the inverse of the determinant of the operator in the action:\n\n$Z = [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)]^{-1}$\n\nThere is a standard result for the determinant of this type of operator for a single bosonic mode with periodic boundary conditions. For an action of the form $\\int d\\tau \\, \\phi^* (\\partial_\\tau + E) \\phi$, the resulting partition function is $Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta E}}$.\n\nIn our case, the operator is $(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)$, which matches the form $(\\partial_\\tau + E)$ if we identify $E = -2\\mu$.\n\nSubstituting $E = -2\\mu$ into the standard formula, we get:\n\n$Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)}} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of $\\hat{H}$:** The most crucial step is correctly interpreting the problem statement. We have assumed \"Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}=-\\mu\\hat{N}$\" means this is the system's Hamiltonian to be inserted into the standard grand canonical partition function definition, leading to $\\hat{K} = -2\\mu\\hat{N}$. An alternative, less literal interpretation might be that the entire grand canonical operator is given as $\\hat{K} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$ (implying $\\hat{H}=0$), which would lead to the result $Z = (1-e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$. Our chosen interpretation is more faithful to the wording.\n\n2.  **Number of Modes:** The calculation was performed for a single mode, as suggested by the notation. If the system had $M$ identical, non-interacting modes, the total partition function would be the product of the single-mode partition functions: $Z_{total} = (Z_{single})^M = (1-e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$. If $M$ were infinite (as in a field theory), the result would diverge. The problem is thus well-posed for a single mode or a finite number of modes.\n\n3.  **Convergence:** The result $Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$ is derived from the sum of a geometric series: $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (e^{2\\beta\\mu})^n$. For this sum to converge and for the partition function to be well-defined and positive, the common ratio must satisfy $|e^{2\\beta\\mu}| < 1$. Since $\\beta > 0$, this requires $2\\beta\\mu < 0$, which means the chemical potential **must be negative ($\\mu < 0$)**. This condition ensures the physical stability of the system, preventing an infinite number of particles from flooding the system from the reservoir.\n\n4.  **Path Integral Formalism:** The evaluation of the path integral relies on the standard result for the determinant of the operator $(\\partial_\\tau+E)$. A full derivation of this determinant requires advanced techniques like zeta function regularization, but the result is standard in quantum field theory textbooks.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis leads to a final expression for the partition function Z under the most direct interpretation of the question and the standard application of the path integral formalism for a single bosonic mode.\n\n1.  Grand Canonical Operator: $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu\\hat{N} = (-\\mu\\hat{N}) - \\mu\\hat{N} = -2\\mu\\hat{N}$.\n2.  Action for Path Integral: $S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi^* (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\phi$.\n3.  Evaluation via standard formula $Z = (1 - e^{-\\beta E})^{-1}$ with $E = -2\\mu$.\n4.  Result: $Z = (1 - e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)})^{-1} = (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$.\n\nThis result is valid for $\\mu < 0$.\n\n<<<\n$Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n>>>"
