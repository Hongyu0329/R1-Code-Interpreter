    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify any PLL case.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe goal is to find the smallest number of side-stickers on the last layer that we need to look at to be able to distinguish any of the 21 PLL cases from each other. At the start of the PLL step, the top face is already a single solid color (e.g., all yellow), so we only need to look at the stickers on the four side faces of the top layer.\n\nThe last layer consists of 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces. Each corner has two side-stickers, and each edge has one side-sticker.\n\n### Step 2: Categorize PLL Cases\nPLL cases can be broadly categorized based on which pieces they move:\n1.  **Corners-Only Permutations:** The 4 edges are already in their correct positions. This category includes the **A-perms (Aa, Ab)** and the **E-perm**. The solved state also fits here.\n2.  **Edges-Only Permutations:** The 4 corners are already in their correct positions. This category includes the **U-perms (Ua, Ub)**, the **H-perm**, and the **Z-perm**.\n3.  **Both Corners and Edges Permuted:** This includes all other cases (**F, G, J, N, R, T, V, Y** perms).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the \"Hardest\" Cases to Distinguish\nThe most difficult cases to distinguish are often those that share common features or lack obvious ones. A critical step in identifying any PLL is determining which of the above categories it falls into. Let's focus on the most challenging distinction: identifying the corners-only permutations.\n\n### Step 4: The Logic for Identifying Corners-Only Permutations\nTo be certain that a case is a corners-only permutation, you must first confirm that all four edges are correctly positioned.\n\n*   **How many edge stickers must be seen to confirm the edge state?** The last layer edges can be permuted in cycles. You cannot have just one edge out of place. The smallest permutation is a 2-edge swap. If you check 3 of the 4 edges and find them all to be in the correct position, the 4th edge must also be correct. Therefore, you need to see the side-sticker of **3 different edges** to confirm that all edges are solved.\n\nLet's assume you have now seen **3 edge stickers**, and they are all correct. You now know the case is either an A-perm, an E-perm, or the cube is already solved.\n\n### Step 5: Distinguishing Within the Corners-Only Category\nNow you must distinguish between A-perms, the E-perm, and the solved state.\n\n*   **A-perms** are defined by a 3-cycle of corners. This results in one pair of \"headlights\" (two adjacent corners having the same color sticker on a side face). Since the edge between these corners is also solved, this creates a \"bar\" (a fully solved 1x3 block on a side face).\n*   **E-perm** swaps corners diagonally. It has no headlights and therefore no bar.\n*   **The Solved State** has all four sides as bars.\n\nTo distinguish these, the most efficient method is to look for headlights.\n\n*   **How many corner stickers must be seen to check for headlights?** To check for headlights on one side face, you must look at the **2 corner stickers** on that face.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Total Number of Stickers\nFollowing this logical path for the most difficult cases:\n1.  You first establish that the edges are all solved. This requires looking at **3 edge stickers**.\n2.  Then, to distinguish the remaining possibilities (A-perm vs. E-perm), you need to check for features like headlights. The minimal check is to look at the **2 corner stickers** on one face.\n3.  The stickers from step 1 (edges) and step 2 (corners) are distinct sets of stickers.\n4.  Therefore, the total number of stickers you must see in this worst-case scenario is 3 + 2 = **5**.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Why not 4?** One might think that a specific combination of 4 stickers could be a unique signature for each case. However, there will always be ambiguity between some cases. For example, with only 4 stickers, it can be impossible to distinguish an H-perm from the solved state, or an A-perm from an E-perm, without being able to choose a 5th sticker to check. The set of the 4 edge stickers, for example, is identical for A-perms and E-perms (all correct). This set of 4 stickers is not enough to tell them apart.\n*   **Worst-Case Scenario:** The question asks for the number of stickers needed to identify *any* case. This means we must find a number that works for the most ambiguous, hard-to-recognize cases. While you can identify a T-perm with 3 stickers or a Z-perm with 2, that number is not sufficient for all 21 possibilities. The process must be able to differentiate the E-perm from an A-perm, which requires 5 stickers.\n\nFinal conclusion: A minimum of 5 non-top-facing stickers must be seen to guarantee the identification of any PLL case.\n\n<<<5>>>"
