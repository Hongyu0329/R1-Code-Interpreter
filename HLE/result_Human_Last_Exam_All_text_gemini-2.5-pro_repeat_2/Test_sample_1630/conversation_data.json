    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nWe are asked for the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a value of $x$ for which $h(x) = x$. This means we want to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Given Functions**\n*   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   The derivative $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$ is positive for all $x$. For a quadratic to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive ($3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$) and its discriminant must be negative ($(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 < 12a_1a_3 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$).\n*   Similarly, for $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1 > 0$, we must have $b_3 > 0$ and $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n*   A key consequence of the derivatives being always positive is that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all real numbers $x$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Degree of the Composite Function**\nThe composite function is $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The degree of a composition of polynomials is the product of their degrees.\nDegree of $h(x) = (\\text{degree of } f) \\times (\\text{degree of } g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Equation for Fixed Points**\nThe fixed points are the solutions to $h(x) = x$. We can rewrite this as $h(x) - x = 0$.\nLet $P(x) = h(x) - x$. Since $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $P(x)$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Upper Bound on the Number of Roots**\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots.\nSince $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the equation $P(x) = 0$ can have at most 9 real roots.\nThis means that the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n**Step 6: Investigate if the Upper Bound is Achievable**\nNow we must determine if it's possible to construct functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in 9 fixed points. We can use calculus and Rolle's Theorem to analyze this possibility.\n\n*   If the equation $P(x)=0$ has 9 distinct real roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $9-1=8$ distinct real roots.\n*   Let's find the derivative $P'(x)$: $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(h(x) - x) = h'(x) - 1$.\n*   So, for $P(x)=0$ to have 9 roots, the equation $h'(x) - 1 = 0$ (or $h'(x)=1$) must have 8 roots.\n*   Let's analyze $h'(x)$. Using the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n*   We know $f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2 and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Therefore, $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   We also know $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   The degree of $h'(x)$ is the sum of the degrees of $f'(g(x))$ and $g'(x)$, which is $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   So, $h'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. The equation $h'(x)=1$ is an 8th-degree polynomial equation. An 8th-degree polynomial can have up to 8 real roots.\n\n**Step 7: Re-apply Rolle's Theorem for a Deeper Check**\n*   For the equation $h'(x)=1$ to have 8 distinct real roots, its derivative, $(h'(x))' = h''(x)$, must have at least $8-1=7$ distinct real roots.\n*   Let's find the degree of $h''(x)$:\n    $h''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x)) = f''(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$.\n    *   $f''(x)$ has degree 1. So $f''(g(x))$ has degree $1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n    *   $g'(x)$ has degree 2. So $(g'(x))^2$ has degree 4.\n    *   The first term, $f''(g(x))g'(x)^2$, has degree $3+4=7$.\n    *   $f'(g(x))$ has degree 6.\n    *   $g''(x)$ has degree 1.\n    *   The second term, $f'(g(x))g''(x)$, has degree $6+1=7$.\n*   The leading coefficients of both terms are positive (since $a_3 > 0$ and $b_3 > 0$), so they do not cancel. Therefore, $h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7.\n*   A 7th-degree polynomial can have up to 7 real roots.\n\n**Step 8: Synthesize the Results**\n1.  The equation for fixed points, $f(g(x))-x=0$, is a 9th-degree polynomial equation, so there can be at most 9 fixed points.\n2.  Our analysis using Rolle's theorem shows that this theoretical maximum is not ruled out by the structure of the derivatives.\n    *   $h''(x)$ can have up to 7 roots.\n    *   This allows $h'(x)$ to have up to 7 local extrema, which in turn allows the equation $h'(x)=1$ to have up to 8 roots.\n    *   This allows $h(x)-x$ to have up to 8 local extrema, which in turn allows the equation $h(x)-x=0$ to have up to 9 roots.\n3.  While constructing a specific example is very complicated, the analysis shows that it is mathematically plausible. There are enough free parameters in the coefficients of the cubic polynomials $f$ and $g$ to create a situation with 9 distinct fixed points while still satisfying the conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$. Therefore, the maximum number of 9 can be achieved.\n\nFinal conclusion: The maximum number of fixed points is the degree of the polynomial equation $f(g(x))-x=0$."
