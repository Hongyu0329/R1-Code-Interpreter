    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks for a specific piece of information based on several criteria:\n*   **Source Text:** The mountain must be mentioned in Homer's *Iliad*.\n*   **Type of Object:** It must be a \"historical mountain,\" meaning a real, physical mountain that exists.\n*   **Ranking:** It must be the tallest one on the list, *after* excluding Mount Olympus.\n\n**2. Identify All Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\n\nFirst, we must compile a list of all geographical mountains explicitly named or clearly referenced in the text of the *Iliad*.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, mentioned frequently throughout the poem. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain, located near Troy in modern-day Turkey (now called Kaz Dağı), is also a key location. Zeus sits on its highest peak, Gargarus, to watch the Trojan War, and it's the setting for Hera's seduction of Zeus in Book 14.\n*   **Samothrace:** In Book 13, the god Poseidon watches the battle from \"the topmost peak of wooded Samothrace.\" The island of Samothrace is real, and its highest peak is Mount Fengari.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, as the goddess Hera travels from Olympus to Ida, her path is described: \"...from Athos she passed over the billowy sea...\". This is a direct mention of the real Mount Athos in northern Greece.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly is mentioned multiple times, most famously as the source of the ash wood used for Achilles' spear, which was given to his father, Peleus, by the centaur Chiron.\n\n**3. List Potential Candidates and Their Heights**\n\nNow, we list the identified mountains (excluding Mount Olympus as per the question) and their actual elevations to determine their height ranking.\n\n*   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n\n**4. Address Careful Points and Potential Confusions**\n\n*   **Is Mount Ossa mentioned?** The myth of the giants piling Mount Pelion on top of Mount Ossa to reach the heavens is famous, but this event is described in the *Odyssey* (Book 11), not the *Iliad*. While the geography described in the *Iliad*'s Catalogue of Ships includes the regions around Mount Ossa, the mountain itself is not explicitly named in the text. Therefore, it cannot be included in our list.\n*   **Which Mount Ida?** Greek mythology features two famous mountains named Ida: one in Crete (birthplace of Zeus) and one near Troy. The *Iliad* is set during the Trojan War, and the mountain mentioned is unequivocally the one in the Troad (Turkey), from which the events on the battlefield could be observed.\n*   **What counts as \"mentioned\"?** The question requires only a mention. Mount Athos is mentioned only in passing as part of Hera's journey, but this counts. The mountains do not need to be central to the plot, just present in the text.\n\n**5. Final Ranking and Conclusion**\n\nComparing the elevations of the historical mountains explicitly mentioned in the *Iliad* (other than Olympus):\n\n1.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n2.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n3.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n4.  **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 m\n\nThe tallest among these is Mount Athos.\n\n***\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
