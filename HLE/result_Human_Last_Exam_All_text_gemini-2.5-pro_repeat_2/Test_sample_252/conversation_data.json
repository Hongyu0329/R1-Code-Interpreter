    "Answering this question requires understanding the principles of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal: \"Construct a full spectral volume\"**\n    A \"spectral volume,\" often called a hyperspectral cube or data cube, is a three-dimensional dataset. It has two spatial dimensions (X and Y, like a normal picture) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). Essentially, for every pixel (X, Y) in the scene, we want to know its full spectrum of light intensity across a range of wavelengths.\n\n2.  **Understand the Input: \"From a single image\"**\n    This is a critical constraint. We are not allowed to take multiple pictures by changing filters, moving parts, or scanning over time. All the information required to reconstruct the 3D spectral volume must be captured in a single snapshot on a 2D sensor (like a CCD or CMOS chip).\n\n3.  **Understand the Method: \"Using computed tomography\"**\n    Computed Tomography (CT) is a mathematical technique used to reconstruct a multi-dimensional object from its projections. A familiar example is a medical CT scan, which reconstructs a 3D model of the body from many 2D X-ray images (projections) taken from different angles.\n    In our case, the \"object\" to be reconstructed is the 3D spectral volume (X, Y, λ). The \"projections\" are the images formed on the 2D sensor. The \"different angles\" correspond to different ways the 3D spectral data is mapped onto the 2D sensor.\n\n4.  **Understand the Tool: \"Diffraction gratings\"**\n    A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits light into its constituent wavelengths, creating a spectrum. A simple (one-dimensional) grating disperses light along a single line.\n\n### Careful Points and Reasoning\n\n*   **Why is one grating not enough?**\n    Imagine a single 1D diffraction grating placed in front of the sensor. For any point source in the scene, the grating will create a line of light on the sensor, representing that point's spectrum. Now, consider a whole scene with many points. The spectra from all these different points will be projected onto the sensor and will overlap significantly. For example, the red light from a point on the left might land on the same pixel as the blue light from a point on the right. This creates a highly ambiguous 2D image. It is a single projection of a 3D data cube onto a 2D plane. From a single projection, it is mathematically impossible to uniquely reconstruct the original 3D object. This is analogous to the \"missing cone problem\" in tomography. Therefore, one grating is insufficient.\n\n*   **Why are two gratings sufficient?**\n    To perform tomographic reconstruction, we need multiple projections from different \"angles.\" How can we get multiple projections in a single snapshot? The solution is to use a **2D diffraction grating**. A 2D grating (also called a crossed grating) is functionally equivalent to having two 1D gratings superimposed, typically at a 90-degree angle to each other.\n    *   This single optical element diffracts light in a 2D pattern. It creates a central, undiffracted image (the \"0th order\").\n    *   Crucially, it also creates multiple dispersed images around the center. For example, it creates one dispersed image along the horizontal axis (from the \"first grating\") and another dispersed image along the vertical axis (from the \"second grating\"). It also creates diagonally dispersed images (from the combination of both gratings).\n    *   Each of these dispersed images is a different projection of the 3D spectral volume onto the 2D sensor. For instance, the horizontally dispersed image is one projection, and the vertically dispersed image is another projection from a different \"angle.\"\n    *   With these multiple, distinct projections captured simultaneously on the sensor, the computed tomography algorithm has enough information to \"unscramble\" the overlapping data and reconstruct the original 3D (X, Y, λ) spectral volume.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the Minimum Number**\n    Since one grating is insufficient and two gratings (in the form of a single 2D crossed grating) provide the necessary multiple projections for tomographic reconstruction, the minimum number of gratings required is 2. Using more than two might improve the quality of the reconstruction but is not the fundamental minimum required for the technique to work.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe minimum number of diffraction gratings (or grating axes) needed to create the multiple, distinct projections required for computed tomographic reconstruction of a spectral volume from a single image is two. These are typically combined into a single 2D crossed-grating element.\n\n<<<B>>>"
