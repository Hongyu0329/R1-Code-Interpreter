    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the function F₃(x)**\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined by composition:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Integrand**\nThe integral we need to evaluate is:\n∫ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx\n\nThis form of the integrand is a standard result from calculus. Let's consider a general function `G(x) = ln(f(x))`. Using the chain rule, its derivative is:\nG'(x) = (1 / f(x)) * f'(x) = f'(x) / f(x)\n\nIn our case, `f(x)` is `F₃(x)`. Therefore, the integrand `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)` is the derivative of `ln(F₃(x))`.\nSo, ∫ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx = ln(F₃(x)) + C.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Definite Integral**\nWe need to evaluate the integral from 0 to 1. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\nV = ∫₀¹ (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx = [ln(F₃(x))] from 0 to 1\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n\n**Step 4: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\nWe need to find the value of the function `F₃(x)` at the limits of integration.\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))\n    Since sin(0) = 0 and e⁰ = 1:\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n    (Note: The argument of sin is in radians)\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the values to find V**\nNow we substitute the expressions for F₃(0) and F₃(1) back into our equation for V:\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\n**Step 6: Numerical Calculation**\nWe now compute the numerical value of V. Using a calculator (in radian mode):\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.841471\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.841471 ≈ 2.31977\n*   1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 1 + 2.31977 = 3.31977\n*   F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.31977) ≈ 1.19999\n*   F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69315\n\nNow we can calculate V:\n*   V ≈ ln(1.19999) - ln(0.69315)\n*   V ≈ 0.18231 - (-0.36651)\n*   V ≈ 0.18231 + 0.36651\n*   V ≈ 0.54882\n\nAlternatively, using the logarithm property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b):\n*   V = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) )\n*   V ≈ ln( 1.19999 / 0.69315 )\n*   V ≈ ln( 1.7312 )\n*   V ≈ 0.54882\n\n**Step 7: Find the final answer**\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n*   10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54882 = 5488.2\n*   The closest integer to 5488.2 is 5488.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognizing that ∫(f'/f) dx = ln(f) is the crucial first step that simplifies the problem immensely.\n*   Applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus correctly.\n*   Ensuring the calculator is in radian mode for `sin(1)`.\n*   Carefully calculating the nested functions at the limits of integration `x=0` and `x=1`.\n*   Performing the final multiplication and rounding to the nearest integer as requested.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2)) ≈ 0.5488339\n10000 * V ≈ 5488.339\nThe closest integer is 5488.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
