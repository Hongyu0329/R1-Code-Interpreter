    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are asked to find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence. The 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\nWe are given the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n*   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\n**2. Key Concept: DFT of a Longer Sequence**\n\nFinding an N-point DFT for a sequence of length M, where M > N, requires reducing the M-point sequence to an N-point sequence. This is achieved through a process called **time-domain aliasing**.\n\nFor our case, we need to find the 4-point DFT (`N=4`) of an 8-point sequence `y(n)` (`M=8`). We create a new 4-point sequence, `z(n)`, by wrapping `y(n)` with a period of 4 and summing the overlapping parts:\n`z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n**3. Constructing the Aliased Sequence `z(n)`**\n\nLet's express `z(n)` in terms of the original sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = x(0) + x(2)`\n*   `z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = h(0) + h(2)`\n*   `z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = x(1) + x(3)`\n*   `z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = h(1) + h(3)`\n\nNow, the problem is to find the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`, which we will denote as `Z(k)`.\n\n**4. Relating `Z(k)` to `X(k)` and `H(k)` (The Smart Way)**\n\nInstead of calculating `x(n)` and `h(n)` first, we can use DFT properties.\n\n*   **Property 1 (Time-Aliasing):** The DFT of the time-aliased sequence `z(n)` is equivalent to sampling the DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`. If `Y(k)` is the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, then the 4-point DFT `Z(k)` is given by:\n    `Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n*   **Property 2 (Time-Interleaving):** The 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence `y(n)` can be expressed in terms of the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`. This is the fundamental principle behind the Decimation-In-Time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The formula is:\n    `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n    where `W_N^k = e^(-j*2*pi*k/N)`.\n\n**5. Combining the Properties to Find `Z(k)`**\n\nWe can substitute the expression for `Y(k)` into the equation for `Z(k)`:\n`Z(k) = Y(2k) = X(2k mod 4) + W_8^(2k) * H(2k mod 4)`\n\nA crucial simplification is `W_8^(2k) = (e^(-j*2*pi/8))^(2k) = e^(-j*4*pi*k/8) = e^(-j*2*pi*k/4) = W_4^k`.\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n`Z(k) = X(2k mod 4) + W_4^k * H(2k mod 4)`\n\n**6. Calculation**\n\nLet's calculate `Z(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n*   **For k = 0:**\n    `Z(0) = X(0) + W_4^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1) * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k = 1:**\n    The indices become `2k=2`.\n    `Z(1) = X(2) + W_4^1 * H(2)`\n    We know `W_4^1 = e^(-j*pi/2) = -j`.\n    `Z(1) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n*   **For k = 2:**\n    The indices become `2k=4`. So `2k mod 4 = 0`.\n    `Z(2) = X(0) + W_4^2 * H(0)`\n    We know `W_4^2 = e^(-j*pi) = -1`.\n    `Z(2) = 1 + (-1) * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k = 3:**\n    The indices become `2k=6`. So `2k mod 4 = 2`.\n    `Z(3) = X(2) + W_4^3 * H(2)`\n    We know `W_4^3 = e^(-j*3*pi/2) = j`.\n    `Z(3) = -1 + (j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n**7. Final Answer**\n\nCombining the results, the 4-point DFT is:\n`Z(k) = [Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)] = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **DFT Size Mismatch:** The core of the problem is realizing that finding a 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence implies time-domain aliasing.\n2.  **Time-Interleaving Formula:** Correctly applying the formula `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)` is essential. This relates the DFT of the interleaved sequence to the DFTs of the original sequences.\n3.  **Time-Aliasing Property:** Knowing that `Z(k) = Y(2k)` provides a direct path from the 8-point DFT to the desired 4-point DFT, avoiding inverse DFT calculations.\n4.  **Twiddle Factor Simplification:** The relation `W_8^(2k) = W_4^k` simplifies the final calculation significantly.\n5.  **Modulus Arithmetic:** Remember that `X(k)` and `H(k)` are periodic with period 4, so `X(k) = X(k mod 4)`. For example, `X(6) = X(2)`.\n\nBy carefully combining these properties, we can solve the problem efficiently in the frequency domain without ever computing the time-domain signals `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
