    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object X and its basic topological properties.**\n*   $X$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   The complex dimension of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 3. As a hypersurface, the complex dimension of $X$ is $3-1=2$.\n*   The real dimension of $X$ is $2 \\times 2 = 4$. So, $X$ is a smooth, compact, orientable 4-manifold.\n*   By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, for a smooth complex hypersurface $X$ of dimension $k$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_j$ for $j < k$ and a surjection for $j=k$.\n*   In our case, $n=3$ and the complex dimension of $X$ is $k=2$. The theorem implies that $i_*: \\pi_j(X) \\to \\pi_j(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism for $j < 2$.\n*   Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$), we have $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. So, $X$ is a simply connected space.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Betti numbers of X.**\nThe Betti numbers $b_k(X) = \\dim H_k(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ are fundamental topological invariants.\n*   Since $X$ is connected, $b_0(X) = 1$.\n*   Since $X$ is a compact orientable 4-manifold, Poincaré duality holds: $b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X)$.\n    *   $b_4(X) = b_0(X) = 1$.\n*   Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, the Hurewicz theorem implies $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(X)/[\\pi_1, \\pi_1] = 0$. So $b_1(X) = 0$.\n*   By Poincaré duality again, $b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\n*   To find $b_2(X)$, we can compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n*   The Euler characteristic can also be computed by integrating the top Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$, i.e., $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(TX)$.\n*   The tangent bundle $TX$ fits into the normal bundle sequence: $0 \\to TX \\to T\\mathbb{CP}^3|_X \\to N_X \\to 0$.\n*   The normal bundle $N_X$ of a degree $d$ hypersurface is the restriction of the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(d)$. Here $d=5$, so $N_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(5)$.\n*   Using the Whitney sum formula for Chern classes, $c(T\\mathbb{CP}^3|_X) = c(TX)c(N_X)$. Let $L$ be the hyperplane class generator of $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z})$ and $l = i^*(L)$ be its restriction to $X$. The first Chern class of $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ is $kL$.\n    *   $c(T\\mathbb{CP}^3) = (1+L)^4 = 1 + 4L + 6L^2 + 4L^3$.\n    *   $c(N_X) = 1 + c_1(N_X) = 1 + 5l$.\n    *   $c(TX) = c(T\\mathbb{CP}^3|_X)c(N_X)^{-1} = i^*((1+L)^4)(1+5l)^{-1} = (1+4l+6l^2)(1-5l+25l^2-\\dots)$.\n    *   $c(TX) = 1 + (4-5)l + (6-20+25)l^2 + \\dots = 1 - l + 11l^2$.\n    *   So, $c_1(TX) = -l$ and $c_2(TX) = 11l^2$.\n*   The integral $\\int_X l^2$ is the self-intersection number of a hyperplane section inside $X$, which equals the degree of $X$. So $\\int_X l^2 = 5$.\n*   $\\chi(X) = \\int_X 11l^2 = 11 \\int_X l^2 = 11 \\times 5 = 55$.\n*   Finally, $b_2 = \\chi(X) - 2 = 55 - 2 = 53$.\n\nSummary of Betti numbers: $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_2=53, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the third homotopy group to rational homology.**\nWe are looking for the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$, which is the dimension of the rational vector space $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   For a simply connected space, the rational homotopy groups can be computed from the rational cohomology algebra. Smooth projective varieties are formal spaces, which simplifies this relationship.\n*   For a 1-connected formal space $Y$, there is a short exact sequence from rational homotopy theory:\n    $$0 \\to H_3(Y; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\pi_3(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\text{Ker}(\\cup: \\Lambda^2 H_2(Y; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H_4(Y; \\mathbb{Q})) \\to 0$$\n    This sequence relates the third rational homotopy group to rational homology groups and the cup product structure.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the formula to X.**\n*   From Step 2, we have the dimensions of the rational homology groups:\n    *   $\\dim H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q}) = b_3(X) = 0$.\n    *   $\\dim H_2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) = b_2(X) = 53$.\n    *   $\\dim H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) = b_4(X) = 1$.\n*   The exact sequence simplifies to:\n    $$0 \\to 0 \\to \\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\text{Ker}(\\cup: \\Lambda^2 H_2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q})) \\to 0$$\n*   This implies that $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the kernel of the cup product map $\\cup: \\Lambda^2 H_2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n*   The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is therefore the dimension of this kernel.\n*   The domain of the map is $\\Lambda^2 H_2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) = \\Lambda^2(\\mathbb{Q}^{53})$. Its dimension is $\\binom{53}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 53 \\times 26 = 1378$.\n*   The codomain is $H_4(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$, which has dimension 1.\n*   The cup product map on homology, $a, b \\in H_2(X) \\mapsto a \\cdot b \\in H_0(X)$, corresponds dually to the cup product on cohomology. The intersection form $H_2(X) \\otimes H_2(X) \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is non-degenerate for a smooth manifold. This means the corresponding map $\\cup: H^2(X) \\otimes H^2(X) \\to H^4(X)$ is non-degenerate.\n*   Specifically, the cup product is not the zero map. For example, the class $l \\in H^2(X)$ (dual to a hyperplane section) has $l \\cup l \\neq 0$ because $\\int_X l^2 = 5 \\neq 0$.\n*   Since the map $\\cup: \\Lambda^2 \\mathbb{Q}^{53} \\to \\mathbb{Q}$ is a non-zero linear map to a 1-dimensional space, it must be surjective.\n*   The dimension of the image of the cup product map is $\\dim(\\mathbb{Q}) = 1$.\n*   By the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of the kernel is:\n    $\\dim(\\text{Ker}(\\cup)) = \\dim(\\Lambda^2 H_2(X; \\mathbb{Q})) - \\dim(\\text{Im}(\\cup))$\n    $\\dim(\\text{Ker}(\\cup)) = 1378 - 1 = 1377$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is equal to the dimension of $\\text{Ker}(\\cup)$, which is 1377."
