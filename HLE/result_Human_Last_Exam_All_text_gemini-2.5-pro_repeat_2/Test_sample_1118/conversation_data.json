    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Context:** Painted after escaping from the Gestapo.\n*   **Question:** What does he hold in his hand, and what does it symbolize? The question specifies the symbol is one of \"resistance.\"\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork.**\n*   The painting in question is Curt Querner's \"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\" (Self-Portrait with Pipe), created in 1933.\n*   Historical records confirm that Querner, a member of the Communist Party and an artist associated with the \"New Objectivity\" movement (which the Nazis deemed \"degenerate\"), was arrested by the Gestapo in March 1933. He painted this self-portrait shortly after his release.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the object in his hand.**\n*   As the German title suggests and visual inspection of the painting confirms, Curt Querner is holding a tobacco **pipe** in his right hand.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the symbolism of the object within the given context.**\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Context is Crucial.** The painting is not just a portrait; it's a statement made immediately following a direct confrontation with the nascent Nazi regime's secret police. This context transforms every element of the painting into a potential symbol.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Pipe as a Symbol of Normalcy and Calm.** Holding a pipe is a simple, everyday, personal ritual. By depicting himself with his pipe, Querner asserts his return to his personal life and his refusal to be broken or terrorized by his experience. It is a quiet insistence on normalcy in the face of totalitarian violence.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The Pipe as a Symbol of Defiance.** Combined with his stern, confrontational gaze directed at the viewer, the pipe is not a sign of relaxation but of steadfastness and inner strength. It's an act of defiance to calmly hold onto one's personal habits and identity when that very identity is under attack. He presents himself not as a defeated victim, but as a resolute and unbroken individual. This quiet act of holding the pipe is his symbol of resistance against the dehumanizing force of the Gestapo.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAfter being detained by the Gestapo, Curt Querner painted himself holding a pipe. This object symbolizes his unbroken spirit and defiance. It represents his reclamation of personal normalcy and his quiet but firm resistance to the intimidation and terror of the Nazi regime.\n\n<<<He holds a pipe.>>>"
