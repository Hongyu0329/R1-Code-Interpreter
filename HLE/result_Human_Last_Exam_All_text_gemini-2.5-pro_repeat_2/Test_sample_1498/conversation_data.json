    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the specific range of verses (bayts) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi that explicitly list the names of the prophets. This requires precise knowledge of the poem's text and its standard numbering.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Poem and its Context**\nThe poem is 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam (The Creed of the Laymen), a famous and concise metrical text on the fundamentals of Islamic creed according to the Ash'ari school. It is approximately 57 couplets long. One of its sections is dedicated to the topic of prophethood, which includes mentioning the 25 prophets whose names are obligatory for a Muslim to know.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Section on Prophets**\nBy examining the poem, we can find the section dedicated to the prophets (Anbiya'). This section follows the discussion of God's attributes. The discussion on prophets begins by outlining their four obligatory attributes (truthfulness, trustworthiness, conveyance, and intelligence) in verses 24-26.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Introduction to the List of Names**\nImmediately after discussing the attributes, the author introduces the list of names. Bayt (verse) 27 serves as this introduction. It states:\n*   **Bayt 27:** `تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ ۞ كُلُّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ`\n    *   *Translation:* The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding upon every legally responsible person, so verify and seize [this knowledge].\nThis verse tells us that a list of 25 names is about to be presented, but it does not contain any of the names itself.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Starting Bayt of the List**\nThe very next verse begins the enumeration of the prophets' names.\n*   **Bayt 28:** `هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعْ ۞ صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ`\n    *   *Translation:* They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim—each is to be followed.\nSince this is the first verse that mentions the actual names, **bayt 28 is the starting point.**\n\n**Step 6: Follow the List to Identify the Ending Bayt**\nThe list of names continues over the next several verses:\n*   **Bayt 29:** Lists Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub.\n*   **Bayt 30:** Lists Yusuf and Ayyub.\n*   **Bayt 31:** Lists Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa.\n*   **Bayt 32:** Lists Al-Yasa', Dhu 'l-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n*   **Bayt 33:** `إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ۞ عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا`\n    *   *Translation:* Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad), the seal [of the prophets]—leave misguidance.\nThis verse contains the last names in the list of 25, concluding with Prophet Muhammad (referred to as Taha). Therefore, **bayt 33 is the ending point.**\n\n**Step 7: Confirm the End of the Section**\nTo be certain that the list ends at bayt 33, we examine the next verse.\n*   **Bayt 34:** `عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ ۞ وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ`\n    *   *Translation:* Upon them be prayers and peace, and upon their families, as long as the days endure.\nThis verse offers a concluding prayer for all the prophets mentioned. It does not list any new names, confirming that the enumeration of names concluded in the previous verse.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Verse Numbering:** The numbering of verses (bayts) can sometimes vary slightly between different publications or manuscripts. However, the numbering used here (starting with `Abda'u bi-ismi-llahi` as verse 1) is the most common and widely accepted standard for this poem.\n2.  **Distinction between Introduction and List:** It is crucial to distinguish between the verse that introduces the list (Bayt 27, which mentions the *number* 25) and the verses that contain the actual *names* (starting from Bayt 28). The question specifically asks for the mention of the **names**.\n3.  **The Name \"Taha\":** The author, Sayyid al-Marzuqi, uses \"Taha\" (طه) to refer to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, which is a common epithet for him drawn from the opening letters of the 20th chapter of the Qur'an.\n4.  **Scope of the Question:** The question is not about the general topic of prophethood (which starts earlier with their attributes) but specifically about the verses that contain the list of the 25 prophets' names.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis:\n*   The verse introducing the list of names is Bayt 27.\n*   The first verse to explicitly mention the names of the prophets is Bayt 28.\n*   The list of names continues through verses 29, 30, 31, and 32.\n*   The final verse containing the last names of the prophets is Bayt 33.\n*   The subsequent verse, Bayt 34, is a concluding prayer and does not contain names.\n\nTherefore, the names of the prophets are mentioned from Bayt 28 to Bayt 33, inclusive.\n\n<<<From bayt 28 to bayt 33>>>"
