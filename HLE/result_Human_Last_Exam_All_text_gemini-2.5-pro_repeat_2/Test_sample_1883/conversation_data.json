    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. The name indicates a 10-carbon chain with four conjugated double bonds. The formation of two isomers, A and B, under thermal conditions from a conjugated polyene suggests an electrocyclic ring-closing reaction. The conjugated system is an octatetraene, so it will close to form a substituted cyclooctatriene. The reaction involves the formation of a sigma bond between C2 and C9. The substituents on these carbons are a methyl group and a hydrogen atom. The products, cis-isomer A and trans-isomer B, refer to the relative stereochemistry of these two methyl groups in the product, 7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene.\n\n2.  **Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory / Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:**\n    *   **π-electron count:** The conjugated system is an octatetraene, which has 8 π-electrons. This is a 4n system, where n=2.\n    *   **Reaction condition:** The reaction is carried out under thermal conditions.\n    *   **FMO analysis:** For a thermal reaction, the stereochemistry is determined by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the polyene. For an 8 π-electron system, the HOMO is ψ₄.\n    *   **Symmetry of HOMO:** The HOMO of a 4n π-electron system (ψ₄ in this case) has terminal p-orbitals with opposite phases (it is antisymmetric with respect to a C₂ axis of rotation).\n    *   **Mode of cyclization:** To bring two lobes of the same phase together to form a bonding interaction, the termini of the polyene must rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise). This is a **conrotatory** motion.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Reactant:** The stereochemical outcome of the reaction depends on the orientation of the substituents at the termini of the reacting polyene (C2 and C9). We can classify substituents as pointing \"in\" (towards the inside of the U-shape the polyene adopts for cyclization) or \"out\" (away from the inside).\n    *   **Terminus at C2:** This carbon is part of the (2Z) double bond. For a Z-alkene terminus, one substituent is \"in\" and one is \"out\". The substituents are a methyl group (Me) and a hydrogen atom (H). This leads to two possible ground-state conformers in equilibrium:\n        *   **Conformer 1:** Me is \"in\", H is \"out\" (let's call this Me_in).\n        *   **Conformer 2:** H is \"in\", Me is \"out\" (let's call this H_in).\n    *   **Terminus at C9:** This carbon is part of the (8E) double bond. For an E-alkene terminus, both substituents point \"out\". Therefore, at C9, both Me and H are \"out\".\n\n4.  **Predict the Products from Each Pathway:** The stereochemical relationship of the substituents in the product is determined by their \"in\" or \"out\" status in the reactant and the mode of ring closure (conrotatory). The rules for conrotatory closure are:\n    *   in / in → trans\n    *   out / out → trans\n    *   in / out → cis\n\n    We apply these rules to the two pathways, tracking the methyl groups:\n    *   **Pathway via Conformer 1 (Me_in):**\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is \"in\".\n        *   The methyl group at C9 is \"out\".\n        *   The relationship is **in/out**. Conrotatory closure leads to the **cis-isomer (A)**.\n        *   `Conformer 1 (Me_in) → cis-Product A`\n\n    *   **Pathway via Conformer 2 (H_in):**\n        *   The methyl group at C2 is \"out\".\n        *   The methyl group at C9 is \"out\".\n        *   The relationship is **out/out**. Conrotatory closure leads to the **trans-isomer (B)**.\n        *   `Conformer 2 (H_in) → trans-Product B`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Relative Rates and Predict the Ratio:** The question asks to use FMO theory to predict the ratio.\n    *   **FMO Theory Perspective:** FMO theory determines that both pathways (from Conformer 1 and Conformer 2) are symmetrically allowed via a conrotatory mechanism. Simple FMO theory does not account for steric effects. From a purely symmetry-based perspective, both A and B are \"allowed\" products. In the absence of any other information or tool, one cannot distinguish between the two allowed pathways. This interpretation suggests that FMO theory alone cannot predict a preference, leading to a predicted ratio of 1:1.\n\n    *   **Steric Analysis (Beyond simple FMO):** In a more detailed analysis, we consider the relative energies of the two competing transition states. According to the Hammond postulate, the transition state energies will reflect the energies of the starting conformers.\n        *   **Conformer 1 (Me_in):** Placing the bulky methyl group in the sterically crowded \"in\" position leads to significant steric repulsion with the backbone of the polyene helix. This conformer is high in energy. The transition state leading from it (TS_A) will also be high in energy.\n        *   **Conformer 2 (H_in):** Placing the small hydrogen atom in the \"in\" position results in much less steric strain. This conformer is low in energy. The transition state leading from it (TS_B) will be lower in energy.\n        *   **Kinetic Control:** Under kinetic control, the product ratio is determined by the difference in activation energies (ΔG‡). The lower-energy transition state (TS_B) will lead to the major product. Therefore, **Product B (trans) is the major kinetic product**.\n        *   **Thermodynamic Control:** The trans-isomer (B), where the bulky methyl groups are further apart, is thermodynamically more stable than the cis-isomer (A). If the reaction is reversible and allowed to reach equilibrium, **Product B (trans) would also be the major thermodynamic product**.\n        *   In this specific case, both kinetic and thermodynamic control favor the same product, B. This would predict a ratio of A:B < 1.\n\n    *   **Reconciling with the Question:** The question specifically asks to \"Use Frontier Molecular Orbital theory\". This can be interpreted as using *only* the principles of FMO, which are primarily about orbital symmetry. Since FMO theory identifies two allowed pathways but does not provide a tool to quantify their relative rates (which depend on sterics), the most neutral prediction based *only* on this theory is that both allowed products are formed without preference. This leads to a ratio of 1:1. This is a common interpretation for such questions in an academic context where a simple numerical answer is expected.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nFMO theory predicts that the 8π thermal electrocyclization proceeds via a conrotatory mechanism. The reactant's stereochemistry allows for two FMO-allowed pathways: one leading to the cis-product (A) and another leading to the trans-product (B). As FMO theory itself does not account for the energy differences arising from steric effects, it cannot distinguish between these two allowed pathways. Therefore, based on FMO theory alone, we predict the two products are formed in equal amounts.\n\n<<<1:1>>>"
