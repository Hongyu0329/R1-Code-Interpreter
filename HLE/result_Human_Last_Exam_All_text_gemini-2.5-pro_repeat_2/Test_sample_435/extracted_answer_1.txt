Based on the evidence that interleukin-15 promotes a less exhausted and more functionally robust T cell phenotype, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured in the presence of interleukin-15 would exhibit an increased or enhanced release of effector cytokines (such as interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) upon antigen stimulation when compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15.
