    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Second Great War and its Chronological Markers\n\nThe Second Great War is the primary conflict depicted in the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*) and its epilogue (*Into the Void*). To determine its length, we must establish its start and end dates based on the official game lore.\n\n*   **Start of the War:** The war begins in the year **2504** with the renewed Zerg invasion of Dominion space, specifically the attack on Mar Sara, which marks the beginning of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign.\n*   **End of the War:** The war concludes with the final defeat of the dark god Amon by the unified Protoss, Terran, and Zerg forces. This occurs in the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*, which takes place in the year **2506**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Events within the Timeframe\n\nThe war spans across three distinct calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506. To calculate the total duration, we must consider the events that occurred within this period.\n\n*   **Year 2504:** This was an intensely active year. It contained the entire storyline of *Wings of Liberty* (Raynor gathering the Xel'Naga artifact), the entire storyline of *Heart of the Swarm* (Kerrigan's transformation and campaign against Mengsk), and the beginning of *Legacy of the Void* (Amon's return and the fall of Aiur). The sheer number of galaxy-spanning events suggests this period lasted for many months, likely occupying a significant portion of the year.\n\n*   **Year 2505:** This year is primarily covered during the *Legacy of the Void* campaign. It represents the period where Artanis and the Daelaam are in exile, gathering their strength, seeking out the Purifiers, and forging an alliance with the Tal'darim. This phase of regrouping and rebuilding logically accounts for the full calendar year, serving as a bridge between the initial onslaught and the final counter-attack. This adds a baseline of one full year to the war's duration.\n\n*   **Year 2506:** This year contains the climax and conclusion of the war. Events include the Protoss reclamation of Aiur, the united campaign against Amon's forces across the Koprulu Sector (the End War), and the final expedition into the Void to destroy Amon's consciousness. These final, large-scale battles would have taken several months to complete.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Duration and Apply the Rounding Rule\n\nThe total duration of the war is the sum of the time it was active in each of these three years.\n\n*   **Duration = (Portion of 2504) + (All of 2505) + (Portion of 2506)**\n*   **Duration = (Portion of 2504) + 1 Year + (Portion of 2506)**\n\nThe question asks for the answer in years, **rounded up**. This means we use a ceiling function; any duration that is not a perfect integer year gets rounded up to the next whole year.\n*   If the duration is > 1 year and ≤ 2 years, the answer is 2.\n*   If the duration is > 2 years and ≤ 3 years, the answer is 3.\n\nSince the war was active for the entirety of 2505 (1 year), plus some portion of 2504 and some portion of 2506, the total duration is guaranteed to be longer than one year. The critical question is whether the combined portions from 2504 and 2506 add up to more than one full year.\n\n*   Given the extensive campaigns in 2504, it is reasonable to assume they lasted for more than six months.\n*   Given the final battles to reclaim a homeworld and defeat a god in 2506, it is also reasonable to assume this took more than six months.\n\nIf we conservatively estimate the events of 2504 took ~8 months and the events of 2506 took ~5 months, the total time for the partial years is 13 months, which is more than a year.\n\n*   **Estimated Total Duration:** ~8 months (in 2504) + 12 months (all of 2505) + ~5 months (in 2056) = ~25 months.\n*   25 months is equal to 2 years and 1 month.\n\nThis duration is greater than 2 years. Therefore, when we round up to the nearest whole year, the answer is 3. The specific instruction to \"round up\" strongly suggests the duration is not a clean integer, and the evidence from the lore points to a total length of just over two years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
