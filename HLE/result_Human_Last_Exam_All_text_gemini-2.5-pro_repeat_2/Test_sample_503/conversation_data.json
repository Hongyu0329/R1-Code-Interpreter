    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Context\n1.  **The Simplex Category $\\Delta$:** The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite, non-empty ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. The morphisms are order-preserving maps, i.e., for $f: [m] \\to [n]$, if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n2.  **Locally Posetal 2-Subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$:** This means that $\\Delta$ is treated as a 2-category where:\n    *   Objects are the ordinals $[n]$.\n    *   1-morphisms are the order-preserving maps between them.\n    *   For any two parallel 1-morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$, denoted $f \\Rightarrow g$, if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. This defines a partial order on the set of morphisms $\\text{Hom}_{\\Delta}([m], [n])$, making it a poset.\n\n### Step 2: Defining an Internal Adjunction in this Context\nAn internal adjunction from an object $A$ to an object $B$ in a 2-category consists of a pair of 1-morphisms, a left adjoint $L: A \\to B$ and a right adjoint $R: B \\to A$, along with two 2-morphisms, the unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_A \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\text{id}_B$, satisfying certain coherence conditions (the triangle identities).\n\nIn our specific context, where $A = [m] = [23]$ and $B = [n] = [37]$:\n*   $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$ are order-preserving maps.\n*   The unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_{[23]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ translates to the condition that $\\text{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$ for all $i \\in [23]$. This means $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in [23]$.\n*   The counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\text{id}_{[37]}$ translates to the condition that $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\text{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$. This means $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [37]$.\n\nThese two conditions, $i \\le R(L(i))$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$, are precisely the definition of a **Galois connection** between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$. In a poset-enriched category, the triangle identities for the adjunction are automatically satisfied. Therefore, an internal adjunction from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is exactly a Galois connection between them.\n\n### Step 3: Characterizing Adjoint Maps\nA key property of Galois connections is that the left adjoint $L$ uniquely determines the right adjoint $R$, and vice-versa. This means the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left adjoints (or, equivalently, right adjoints).\n\nWe can characterize which order-preserving maps can be left or right adjoints using the Adjoint Functor Theorem for Posets:\n1.  An order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if for every $j \\in [n]$, the set $S_j = \\{ i \\in [m] \\mid L(i) \\le j \\}$ has a maximum element. Since $[m]$ is a finite totally ordered set, any non-empty subset has a maximum. Thus, the condition simplifies to: $S_j$ must be non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$.\n    *   For $S_j$ to be non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$, it must hold for $j=0$. This means there must be an $i \\in [m]$ such that $L(i) \\le 0$. Since the codomain is non-negative integers, this requires $L(i) = 0$. As $L$ is order-preserving, $L(0) \\le L(i)$, so we must have $L(0) = 0$.\n    *   Conversely, if $L(0)=0$, then for any $j \\in [n]$, we have $j \\ge 0 = L(0)$, so $0 \\in S_j$. Thus, $S_j$ is always non-empty.\n    *   Conclusion: An order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $L(0)=0$.\n\n2.  Dually, an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if for every $i \\in [m]$, the set $T_i = \\{ j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le R(j) \\}$ has a minimum element. This simplifies to $T_i$ being non-empty for all $i \\in [m]$.\n    *   For $T_i$ to be non-empty for all $i \\in [m]$, it must hold for $i=m$. This means there must be a $j \\in [n]$ such that $m \\le R(j)$. As the codomain of $R$ is $[m]$, $R(j) \\le m$. Thus we must have $R(j) = m$. Since $R$ is order-preserving, $R(j) \\le R(n)$, which forces $R(n)=m$.\n    *   Conversely, if $R(n)=m$, then for any $i \\in [m]$, we have $i \\le m = R(n)$, so $n \\in T_i$. Thus, $T_i$ is always non-empty.\n    *   Conclusion: An order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if $R(n)=m$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Adjunctions\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ with $L(0)=0$.\n*   Such a map is defined by a sequence of values $(L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23))$.\n*   We have the condition $L(0)=0$.\n*   The order-preserving property requires $L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$.\n*   The codomain requires $L(i) \\in [37] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n*   So we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $(L(1), L(2), \\dots, L(23))$ of length 23, where each element is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n*   This is a classic stars-and-bars problem. We are choosing $k=23$ items (the values of $L(i)$ for $i=1, \\dots, 23$) from a set of $n=38$ possible values (the numbers $0, \\dots, 37$) with replacement.\n*   The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n    $$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n### Step 5: Verification (by counting right adjoints)\nAs a check, we can count the number of right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n*   We need to count order-preserving maps with $R(37)=23$.\n*   This is equivalent to counting non-decreasing sequences $(R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(36))$ of length 37, where each element is chosen from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n*   Here, we are choosing $k=37$ items from a set of $n=24$ possible values.\n*   The number of ways is:\n    $$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\n*   Using the identity $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\nThe two methods yield the same result, which confirms our analysis.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial[60, 23]>>>"
