The two languages are **Malayalam** (from the Dravidian culture of Kerala, India) and **Vietnamese** (from the Vietic culture of Vietnam).

*   **Broom:** The Malayalam word is **ചൂല്** (*choolu*), which is highly similar to the Vietnamese word **chổi**.
*   **Mom:** The Malayalam word is **അമ്മ** (*amma*), which is highly similar to the Vietnamese word **má**.
*   **Dad:** The Malayalam word is **അപ്പ** (*appa*), which is highly similar to the Vietnamese word **ba**.

These two languages belong to completely different language families (Dravidian and Austroasiatic) and their cultures have had no direct historical contact, making the similarities a notable coincidence.
