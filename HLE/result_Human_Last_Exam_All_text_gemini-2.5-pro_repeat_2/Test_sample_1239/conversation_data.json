    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Write Down the Equations\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$) describe the evolution of a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and a pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$. Assuming constant density $\\rho=1$ and constant kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, the equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:**\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:**\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0 $$\n\nThese are a system of four coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) for the four dependent variables $(u_1, u_2, u_3, p)$ in terms of the four independent variables $(t, x_1, x_2, x_3)$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of this system. This dimension is equivalent to the dimension of the associated Lie algebra, which consists of the infinitesimal generators of these symmetry transformations. A symmetry transformation maps any solution of the equations to another solution. We are looking for the number of independent infinitesimal generators that form a basis for this Lie algebra.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Symmetries from Physical Principles\n\nWe can identify several symmetries based on the fundamental principles of physics reflected in the equations. The infinitesimal generator for each symmetry is a vector field in the space of independent and dependent variables.\n\n1.  **Time Translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$, so they are invariant under a time shift $t \\to t + s$. This gives one generator:\n    *   $X_t = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ (1 generator)\n\n2.  **Space Translations:** The equations do not explicitly depend on the spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$, meaning they are invariant under spatial shifts $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$. This gives three generators, one for each spatial direction:\n    *   $X_{x_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$ (3 generators)\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are isotropic, meaning their form is preserved under rotations of the coordinate system. The group of rotations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is SO(3), which is 3-dimensional. The generators act on both space and velocity vectors:\n    *   $R_{ij} = x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} - x_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + u_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_j} - u_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$ (3 generators for pairs $(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)$)\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change to a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity (Galilean relativity). A transformation to a frame moving with velocity $\\mathbf{c}$ is given by $t' = t$, $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{c}t$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{c}$, and $p' = p$. This symmetry gives three generators:\n    *   $G_i = t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$ (3 generators)\n\n### Step 4: Search for Scaling Symmetries\n\nWe can look for symmetries that rescale the variables. We seek a transformation of the form $t \\to \\lambda^a t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}$, $p \\to \\lambda^d p$ that leaves the equations invariant. By substituting these into the Navier-Stokes equations and balancing the powers of $\\lambda$, we find a valid scaling symmetry with exponents $a=2, b=1, c=-1, d=-2$. This corresponds to one additional generator:\n*   $S = 2t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} - 2p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$ (1 generator)\n\n### Step 5: Sum the Finite-Dimensional Symmetries\n\nSumming the number of generators found so far gives the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra of symmetries:\nDimension = (Time translation) + (Space translations) + (Rotations) + (Galilean boosts) + (Scaling)\nDimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11\n\n### Step 6: Consider Infinite-Dimensional Symmetries\n\nA careful analysis of the determining equations for the symmetry generators reveals that there is also an infinite-dimensional part to the symmetry algebra. This arises from the fact that the pressure $p$ only appears in the momentum equation through its gradient, $\\nabla p$.\n*   This means we can add any arbitrary function of time, $h(t)$, to the pressure, $p \\to p + h(t)$, and the term $\\nabla p$ remains unchanged. The incompressibility condition is also unaffected.\n*   This gives rise to an infinite set of generators of the form $h(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$, where $h(t)$ is any smooth function. This forms an infinite-dimensional abelian ideal within the full Lie algebra of symmetries.\n\n### Step 7: Final Conclusion on the Dimension\n\nThe full Lie algebra of symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional. However, it has the structure of a semi-direct sum of an 11-dimensional algebra (found in Step 5) and the infinite-dimensional ideal related to the pressure freedom.\n\nIn the context of physics and mathematics, when a question asks for \"the dimension\" of such a symmetry group, it is standard practice to refer to the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional (and often physically more significant) part. The infinite-dimensional part is often treated as a \"trivial\" or \"gauge\" symmetry, as the pressure itself is not directly measurable, only its differences or gradient.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries is conventionally taken to be 11.\n\nFinal calculation:\n*   Time Translation: 1\n*   Space Translations: 3\n*   Spatial Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean Boosts: 3\n*   Scaling Dilation: 1\n*   **Total Dimension:** 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11\n\n<<<11>>>"
