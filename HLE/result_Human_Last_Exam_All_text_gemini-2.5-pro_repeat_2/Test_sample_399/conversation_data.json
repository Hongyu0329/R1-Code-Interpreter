    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the initial value problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\nThe problem asks us to solve a first-order ordinary differential equation with a given initial condition and then find the value of the solution at a specific point.\n-   **Differential Equation:** $x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$\n-   **Initial Condition:** $x(0) = -8$\n-   **Goal:** Find the value of $x(1)$.\n\n**2. Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the type of differential equation.**\n    The equation can be written as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. We can see that the variables $x$ and $t$ can be separated. Thus, it is a separable differential equation.\n\n*   **Step 2: Separate the variables.**\n    We want to move all terms involving $x$ to one side with $dx$ and all terms involving $t$ to the other side with $dt$.\n    $$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt $$\n    **Careful Point:** This step involves dividing by $x^2$. This is valid only if $x(t) \\neq 0$. We can check if $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. The equation becomes $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is $0=0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is an equilibrium solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0) = -8$, which means our particular solution is not the zero solution. Therefore, the division is justified.\n\n*   **Step 3: Integrate both sides of the equation.**\n    $$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\n    Now, we compute each integral.\n    -   The left side integral: $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n    -   The right side integral: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n    Combining these results and adding a constant of integration $C$ gives the general solution in implicit form:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n*   **Step 4: Use the initial condition to find the constant C.**\n    We are given $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation from Step 3.\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\n*   **Step 5: Write the particular solution.**\n    Now that we have the value of $C$, we can write the equation for our specific solution:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n    To find $x(t)$ explicitly, we first multiply by -1:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} $$\n    Then, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n    $$ x(t) = \\frac{1}{t - \\frac{t^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n\n*   **Step 6: Calculate the final answer, x(1).**\n    We need to find the value of $x$ when $t=1$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution.\n    $$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1^2}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n    $$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n    To simplify the denominator, we find a common denominator, which is 8.\n    $$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{8}{8} - \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n    $$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{8-4-1}{8}} $$\n    $$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{8}} $$\n    $$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is obtained by evaluating the particular solution at $t=1$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
