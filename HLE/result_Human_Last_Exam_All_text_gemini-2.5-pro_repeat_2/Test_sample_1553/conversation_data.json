    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of the person whom the main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" by Jacek Dukaj marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) is Adam Zamoyski, a human from the 21st century who has been resurrected in the distant future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the main character's significant relationships.**\nThroughout the novel, Adam Zamoyski's most significant and intimate relationship is with another resurrected human. This character is his companion in the strange, post-human world they find themselves in. They share the unique experience of being \"stahs\" (Standard Humans) among vastly superior beings.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the character Adam Zamoyski marries.**\nAdam Zamoyski forms a deep bond with a resurrected 17th-century Polish noblewoman. Their shared humanity and cultural background, despite being from different centuries, bring them together. The novel describes their decision to marry as a conscious act of preserving their human traditions in a world that has moved far beyond them.\n\n**Step 5: State the name of this character.**\nThe name of the 17th-century noblewoman that Adam Zamoyski marries is Angelika. She is also sometimes referred to by the Polish diminutive \"Anielka\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to correctly identify the protagonist as Adam Zamoyski.\n*   The marriage itself is a key plot point, representing a deliberate act of defiance against the post-human culture and a clinging to older human values.\n*   The character's name is Angelika, and recognizing the diminutive \"Anielka\" is also helpful context.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer can be determined.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
