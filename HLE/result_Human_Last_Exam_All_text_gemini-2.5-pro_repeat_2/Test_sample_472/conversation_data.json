    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line:\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThis line is an iambic senarius (six iambic feet), a meter common in Roman comedy (like the plays of Plautus, from which this line comes). This meter allows for frequent substitutions and resolutions, and the rules of vowel quantity are more flexible than in classical epic poetry.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Elision**\nAn elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel (or vowel + m) is followed by a word beginning with a vowel.\n*   In \"bene esse\", the final `-e` of `bene` is elided before the initial `e-` of `esse`.\n*   The line is therefore read as: \"et tibi benesse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n**Step 2: Syllabification**\nNow, we break the modified line into its component syllables.\n*   `et | ti | bi | be | nes | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\nThis gives a total of 14 syllables. Since an iambic senarius line typically has 12 syllables, this indicates that two feet have been \"resolved\" (i.e., contain an extra short syllable).\n\n**Step 3: Determine Syllable Quantity and Group into Feet**\nWe determine whether each syllable is long (L) or short (S) and group them into six metrical feet. We must consider the special rules of comic meter, such as *brevis brevians*.\n\n*   **Foot 1: `et ti`**\n    *   `et`: The vowel `e` is followed by two consonants (`t` from `et` and `t` from `tibi`), making it long by position. **L**\n    *   `ti`: The vowel `i` is naturally short and followed by a single consonant. **S**\n    *   **Foot:** `L S` (a Trochee). This is a common substitution in the first foot.\n\n*   **Foot 2: `bi be nes`**\n    *   `bi`: The vowel `i` in `tibi` is short. **S**\n    *   `be`: The first syllable of the elided `benesse` is short. **S**\n    *   `nes`: The `e` is followed by two consonants (`ss`), which would normally make it long by position. However, Plautine meter follows the law of *brevis brevians* (iambic shortening), where a long syllable can be shortened if it is preceded by a short, unaccented syllable. In the sequence `be-nes` (S L), the long `nes` is shortened. **S**\n    *   **Foot:** `S S S` (a Tribrach), which is a resolution of an iambic foot (S L).\n\n*   **Foot 3: `se so`**\n    *   `se`: The final syllable of `benesse`. The `e` is followed by the consonant `s` of `soli`, which would normally make it long by position. However, in comic meter, an unaccented syllable that is long by position can be scanned as short. **S**\n    *   `so`: The `o` in `soli` is long by nature. **L**\n    *   **Foot:** `S L` (an Iamb).\n\n*   **Foot 4: `li quom`**\n    *   `li`: The `i` in `soli` is long by nature. **L**\n    *   `quom`: The vowel `o` is followed by two consonants (`m` from `quom` and `s` from `sibi`), making it long by position. **L**\n    *   **Foot:** `L L` (a Spondee).\n\n*   **Foot 5: `si bi sit`**\n    *   `si`: The `i` in `sibi` is naturally short. **S**\n    *   `bi`: The `i` is followed by the consonant `s` of `sit`, which would make it long by position. However, like `se` in the third foot, this unaccented syllable (`s√≠bi`) is treated as short. **S**\n    *   `sit`: The `i` is followed by two consonants (`t` from `sit` and `m` from `male`), making it long by position. **L**\n    *   **Foot:** `S S L` (an Anapest), which is a resolution of a spondee (L L).\n\n*   **Foot 6: `ma le`**\n    *   `ma`: The `a` in `male` is naturally short. **S**\n    *   `le`: The final `e` is naturally short. However, the final syllable of a line is *syllaba anceps*, meaning it can be treated as long or short to fit the meter. To complete the final iamb, it is scanned as long. **L**\n    *   **Foot:** `S L` (an Iamb).\n\n**Final Scansion:**\nCombining the feet gives the complete scansion of the line.\n\n<<<L S S S S S L L L S S L S L>>>"
