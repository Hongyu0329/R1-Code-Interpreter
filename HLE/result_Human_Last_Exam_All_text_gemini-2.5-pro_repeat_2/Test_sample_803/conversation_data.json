    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `a, b ∈ S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `ab` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S.S ∩ S = ∅`, where `S.S = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPF):** A product-free set `S` is a MIPF set if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. In other words, if you add any element `g ∈ G \\ S` to `S`, the new set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **A Set S Fills G:** A subset `S` of `G` is said to fill `G` if `G = S ∪ S.S ∪ {e}`, where `e` is the identity element of `G`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called a filled group if **every** MIPF set in `G` fills `G`. This is a very strong condition.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Structure of Groups of Order `2q^m`\n\nLet `G` be a nonabelian group with order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number. We use Sylow's Theorems to analyze the structure of `G`.\n\n1.  Let `n_q` be the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups. By Sylow's Third Theorem, `n_q` must divide the order of the group divided by the order of the Sylow `q`-subgroup, so `n_q | 2`. Also, `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)`.\n2.  Since `q` is an odd prime (`q ≥ 3`), the condition `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)` means `n_q` cannot be 2. Therefore, `n_q` must be 1.\n3.  This implies that the Sylow `q`-subgroup, let's call it `P`, is unique and therefore normal in `G`. `P` has order `q^m`.\n4.  Let `H` be a Sylow 2-subgroup. `H` has order 2, so `H ≅ Z_2`.\n5.  Since `P` is a normal subgroup and `P ∩ H = {e}`, the group `G` is a semidirect product of `P` and `H`. We can write `G = P ⋊ H ≅ P ⋊ Z_2`.\n6.  The group `G` is specified as nonabelian. This means the homomorphism `φ: Z_2 → Aut(P)` defining the semidirect product must be non-trivial. The non-identity element of `Z_2` must map to an automorphism of `P` of order 2.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Classification of Filled Groups\n\nThis problem requires a known, non-trivial result from group theory: the classification of all finite filled groups. According to the work of P. Csörgő and others, the finite filled groups are completely classified.\n\nA finite group `G` is filled if and only if it is one of the following:\n1.  An elementary abelian 2-group.\n2.  The cyclic group `Z_3`.\n3.  The symmetric group `S_3` (which is isomorphic to the dihedral group `D_6`).\n4.  The cyclic group `Z_p` where `p` is a prime satisfying `p ≡ 1 (mod 4)` and the multiplicative order of 2 modulo `p` is `(p-1)/2`.\n5.  The dihedral group `D_{2p}` where `p` is a prime satisfying `p ≡ 1 (mod 4)` and the multiplicative order of 2 modulo `p` is `(p-1)/2`.\n\n### Step 4: Filtering the List to Find the Solution\n\nWe now check which of these classified groups match the criteria of our question: being nonabelian and having an order of `2q^m`.\n\n*   **Case 1: Elementary abelian 2-groups.** These are abelian, so we discard them.\n*   **Case 2: `Z_3`.** This group is abelian. Its order is 3. If `2q^m = 3`, then `q=3, m=1` but `2*3^1=6≠3`. So this is not a solution.\n*   **Case 3: `S_3`.**\n    *   `S_3` is nonabelian.\n    *   Its order is `|S_3| = 6`. We check if this matches the form `2q^m`. `6 = 2 * 3^1`. Here, `q=3` (an odd prime) and `m=1` (a natural number).\n    *   Therefore, `S_3` is a valid solution.\n*   **Case 4: `Z_p` with special conditions.** These are cyclic groups and thus abelian. We discard them.\n*   **Case 5: `D_{2p}` with special conditions.**\n    *   The dihedral group `D_{2p}` is nonabelian for `p ≥ 3`.\n    *   Its order is `2p`. We check if this matches the form `2q^m`. This is true if `p=q` and `m=1`.\n    *   So, a solution family is `D_{2q}` for `m=1`, provided the prime `q` satisfies the conditions:\n        a) `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`\n        b) The multiplicative order of 2 modulo `q`, denoted `o_q(2)`, is equal to `(q-1)/2`.\n    *   Note that the group `S_3 ≅ D_6 = D_{2*3}` from Case 3 does *not* fit this case, because for `q=3`, we have `3 ≢ 1 (mod 4)`. This shows that `S_3` is a special case among the dihedral groups.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Restriction on `m`:** The classification theorem for filled groups does not contain any nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` where `m > 1`. This implies that for a group to be filled and match the given order structure, `m` must be equal to 1. The groups are therefore of order `2q`.\n2.  **Generalised Dihedral Groups:** For `m>1`, the groups `G = P ⋊ Z_2` are often called generalised dihedral groups. The fact that they are not on the list of filled groups means that for `m>1`, there must exist at least one MIPF set that does not fill the group.\n3.  **The Solutions:** Combining the results from our filtering process, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are:\n    *   The symmetric group `S_3` (for `q=3, m=1`).\n    *   The dihedral groups `D_{2q}` (for `m=1`) where `q` is a prime such that `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)` and `o_q(2) = (q-1)/2`.\n\nThese are the only groups that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\nThe groups must have `m=1`. They are the dihedral groups `D_{2q}` (which includes `S_3 ≅ D_6`). The possible groups fall into two categories based on the prime `q`:\n1.  The special case where `q=3`, which gives the group `S_3 ≅ D_6`.\n2.  The family of groups `D_{2q}` where `q` is a prime satisfying both `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)` and the order of 2 modulo `q` is `(q-1)/2`.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the symmetric group S_3 (where q=3, m=1), and the dihedral groups D_{2q} (where m=1) for primes q such that q ≡ 1 (mod 4) and the multiplicative order of 2 modulo q is (q-1)/2.>>>"
