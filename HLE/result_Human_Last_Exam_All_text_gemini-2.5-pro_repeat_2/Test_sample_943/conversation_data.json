    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understanding the Tensor and Slice Rank**\n\n*   **The Tensor:** The tensor $T$ is a function from $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. Its value at a point $(x, y, z)$ is given by:\n    $T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$.\n    Here, $x, y, z$ are vectors in $\\{0, 1\\}^n$, and $x_i, y_i, z_i$ are their components. The sum is a standard integer sum. The tensor $T$ can be viewed as a $3$-dimensional array of size $2^n \\times 2^n \\times 2^n$.\n\n*   **Slice Rank:** The slice rank of a 3-tensor $T \\in V_1 \\otimes V_2 \\otimes V_3$ is the smallest integer $r$ such that $T$ can be written as a sum of $r$ \"slices\". A slice is a simple tensor where one of the components has rank 1. For example, a slice along the first dimension is of the form $u \\otimes M$ where $u \\in V_1$ and $M \\in V_2 \\otimes V_3$. The slice rank is the minimum of the slice ranks along the three dimensions (1, 2, and 3).\n\n*   **1-Slice Rank:** The 1-slice rank is the smallest $r_1$ such that $T(x,y,z) = \\sum_{j=1}^{r_1} u_j(x) M_j(y,z)$. This is equivalent to the dimension of the vector space spanned by the functions (\"slices\") $T_x(y,z) = T(x,y,z)$ for all $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$.\n    $r_1(T) = \\dim \\text{span} \\{ T_x : (y,z) \\mapsto T(x,y,z) \\mid x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n \\}$.\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The tensor $T(x,y,z)$ is symmetric with respect to permutations of $x, y, z$. This means the 1-slice rank, 2-slice rank, and 3-slice rank are all equal. Therefore, the slice rank is equal to the 1-slice rank.\n\n**2. Calculating the 1-Slice Rank**\n\nLet's compute the dimension of the space spanned by the slices $T_x$.\nLet $F(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$. Then $T(x, y, z) = F(x, y, z) - 1$.\nThe slices of $T$ are $T_x(y,z) = F_x(y,z) - 1$, where $F_x(y,z) = F(x,y,z)$ for a fixed $x$.\nThe space spanned by the slices of $T$ is $W = \\text{span}\\{F_x - 1 \\mid x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n\\}$.\n\nLet's first analyze the space $V = \\text{span}\\{F_x \\mid x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n\\}$.\nFor a fixed $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$, let $I_1 = \\{i \\mid x_i=1\\}$ and $I_0 = \\{i \\mid x_i=0\\}$.\n$F_x(y,z) = \\left( \\prod_{i \\in I_0} (y_i+z_i) \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i \\in I_1} (1+y_i+z_i) \\right)$.\nLet $u_i = y_i+z_i$. Then $F_x$ can be seen as a polynomial in the functions $u_1, \\dots, u_n$. Let's call this polynomial $P_{I_1}(u_1, \\dots, u_n)$.\n$P_{I_1} = \\left( \\prod_{i \\in I_0} u_i \\right) \\left( \\prod_{i \\in I_1} (1+u_i) \\right) = \\left( \\prod_{i \\in I_1^c} u_i \\right) \\sum_{S \\subseteq I_1} \\prod_{j \\in S} u_j = \\sum_{S \\subseteq I_1} \\prod_{j \\in S \\cup I_1^c} u_j$.\nLet $M_J = \\prod_{j \\in J} u_j$ be the monomial corresponding to the subset $J \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThen $P_{I_1} = \\sum_{J \\supseteq I_1^c} M_J$.\n\nThe space $V$ is spanned by the $2^n$ polynomials $\\{P_I \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}\\}$.\nThese polynomials are linear combinations of the $2^n$ monomials $\\{M_J \\mid J \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}\\}$.\nThe change of basis matrix $A$ between the basis $\\{P_I\\}$ and $\\{M_J\\}$ is given by $P_I = \\sum_J A_{I,J} M_J$. So $A_{I,J} = 1$ if $J \\supseteq I^c$ and $0$ otherwise.\nIf we order the subsets $I$ and $J$ by size, this matrix is triangular with 1s on the diagonal (after a suitable permutation of rows/columns). Specifically, if we re-index with $I' = I^c$, we have $P_{I'^c} = \\sum_{J \\supseteq I'} M_J$. This is the matrix of the \"sum over supersets\" transform, which is invertible.\nTherefore, the $2^n$ polynomials $\\{P_I\\}$ are linearly independent and form a basis for the space of all polynomials in $u_1, \\dots, u_n$ where each variable has degree at most 1. The dimension of this space is $\\dim V = 2^n$.\n\nNow we consider the space $W = \\text{span}\\{P_I - 1 \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\}\\}$.\nThe constant function $1$ corresponds to the monomial $M_\\emptyset$. Since $\\{P_I\\}$ form a basis for the space containing all monomials, $1$ must be in the span of $\\{P_I\\}$. So $1 \\in V$.\nLet $1 = \\sum_I d_I P_I$. A linear combination of the generators of $W$ is zero if\n$\\sum_I c_I (P_I - 1) = 0 \\implies \\sum_I c_I P_I = (\\sum_I c_I) \\cdot 1$.\nSubstituting $1 = \\sum_J d_J P_J$, we get $\\sum_I c_I P_I = (\\sum_I c_I) \\sum_J d_J P_J$.\nSince $\\{P_I\\}$ is a basis, we can compare coefficients: $c_J = (\\sum_I c_I) d_J$ for all $J$.\nLet $C = \\sum_I c_I$. Then $c_J = C d_J$. Summing over $J$ gives $C = C (\\sum_J d_J)$.\nThis implies $C(1 - \\sum_J d_J) = 0$.\nSo, either $C=0$ (which implies all $c_J=0$, the trivial case) or $\\sum_J d_J = 1$.\nIf $\\sum_J d_J \\neq 1$, the only solution is $C=0$, so the set $\\{P_I - 1\\}$ is linearly independent and $\\dim W = 2^n$.\nIf $\\sum_J d_J = 1$, there is a linear dependency (e.g., take $C=1$, then $c_J=d_J$), so $\\dim W = 2^n - 1$.\n\nLet's compute $\\sum_I d_I$. The equation $1 = \\sum_I d_I P_I$ implies\n$M_\\emptyset = \\sum_I d_I \\sum_{J \\supseteq I^c} M_J = \\sum_J \\left( \\sum_{I: J \\supseteq I^c} d_I \\right) M_J$.\nComparing coefficients for $M_J$: $\\sum_{I: I^c \\subseteq J} d_I = \\delta_{J,\\emptyset}$.\nLet $K=I^c$. Then $\\sum_{K \\subseteq J} d_{K^c} = \\delta_{J,\\emptyset}$.\nBy Mobius inversion on the subset lattice, $d_{K^c} = \\sum_{J \\subseteq K} (-1)^{|K|-|J|} \\delta_{J,\\emptyset}$.\nThe only non-zero term is when $J=\\emptyset$, so $d_{K^c} = (-1)^{|K|}$.\nLet $I=K^c$, so $|I|=n-|K|$. Then $d_I = (-1)^{n-|I|}$.\nWe compute the sum:\n$\\sum_I d_I = \\sum_I (-1)^{n-|I|} = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^{n-k} = (-1)^n \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k = (-1)^n (1-1)^n$.\nFor $n \\ge 1$, this sum is 0.\nSince $\\sum_I d_I = 0 \\neq 1$, the set $\\{P_I - 1\\}$ is linearly independent.\nThus, the 1-slice rank of $T$ is $\\dim W = 2^n$.\n\n**3. Solving for K**\n\nThe slice rank of the tensor is $r(T) = 2^n$.\nThe problem states that the slice rank is given by the formula $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$.\nThe term $e^{o(n)}$ represents sub-exponential factors, which means $(e^{o(n)})^{1/n} \\to 1$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\nWe set the asymptotic expressions equal:\n$2^n \\approx (3/2^K)^n$.\nTaking the $n$-th root of both sides gives:\n$2 \\approx 3/2^K$.\nNow, we solve for $K$:\n$2 \\cdot 2^K = 3$\n$2^{K+1} = 3$\n$K+1 = \\log_2(3)$\n$K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\nUsing logarithm properties, this can be written as:\n$K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3/2)$."
