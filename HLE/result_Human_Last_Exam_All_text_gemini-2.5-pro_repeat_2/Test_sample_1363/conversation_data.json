    "This question requires an understanding of the fundamental techniques of the five International Standard ballroom dances. Let's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n**The Core Concept: \"Overturning a Reverse Turn\"**\n\n*   A **Reverse Turn** is a standard figure in ballroom dancing that rotates to the left (counter-clockwise).\n*   **Overturning** means rotating more than the standard prescribed amount for that figure. For example, if a step is supposed to turn 3/8 of a full circle, overturning it might mean turning 1/2 of a circle.\n*   The key part of the question is \"without disregarding the technique.\" This means we are looking for a dance where the fundamental principles make it technically incorrect or impossible to add extra rotation to a reverse turn.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Each Dance:**\n\n1.  **English Waltz & Slow Foxtrot (Swing Dances):**\n    *   **Technique:** Both Waltz and Foxtrot are \"swing\" dances. Their technique is built on concepts like momentum, body swing, sway, and rise & fall.\n    *   **Turning:** This momentum and swing are what allow dancers to travel across the floor and rotate. A key part of advanced dancing in these styles is \"floorcraft\" – navigating the dance floor. To do this, dancers frequently and intentionally under-turn or overturn figures to change their alignment for the next step or to avoid other couples.\n    *   **Conclusion:** In Waltz and Foxtrot, overturning a reverse turn is not only possible but is a common and accepted part of the technique for choreographic and practical purposes.\n\n2.  **Viennese Waltz (Rotational Swing Dance):**\n    *   **Technique:** This is also a swing dance, but its primary characteristic is continuous rotation.\n    *   **Turning:** The entire dance is a series of natural (right) and reverse (left) turns. While there's a standard amount of turn per bar of music, the continuous momentum allows for slight adjustments. Dancers might slightly overturn a step to help navigate a corner or move around another couple.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It is possible to overturn turns in Viennese Waltz without fundamentally breaking the technique of swing and rotation.\n\n3.  **Quickstep (Fast Swing Dance):**\n    *   **Technique:** Quickstep combines the swing and sway of Foxtrot with faster, lighter steps like chassés and hops. It has immense momentum and \"flight.\"\n    *   **Turning:** Like the other swing dances, the speed and momentum make it possible to adjust the amount of turn. In fact, controlling this high-speed rotation is a key skill. Overturning is possible and sometimes necessary for floorcraft.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Overturning is technically feasible within the principles of Quickstep.\n\n4.  **European Tango (Non-Swing Dance):**\n    *   **Technique:** Tango is the outlier among the Standard dances. Its technique is fundamentally different.\n        *   **No Swing:** There is no body swing or momentum in the way the other dances have.\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is kept flat and grounded. Dancers should not rise up onto the balls of their feet unless specified for a particular action (which is not a turn).\n        *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, deliberate, and have a \"cat-like\" quality, with feet kept close to the floor.\n    *   **Turning:** A Reverse Turn in Tango is executed with this staccato, grounded technique. The turn is created by swiveling on the feet and rotating the body as a single, connected unit, but without generating swing. To *overturn* it, a dancer would be forced to introduce elements that are fundamentally against Tango technique. They would have to:\n        *   Generate swing momentum.\n        *   Rise up to pivot more easily.\n        *   Break the sharp, staccato timing.\n        *   Allow the frame to become soft and rotational instead of sharp and directional.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Doing any of these things means you are no longer dancing Tango correctly. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn in Tango *without disregarding the technique*. The technique itself prevents this action.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the European Tango is the only dance listed where the core technique (no swing, no rise and fall, staccato action) makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without violating these fundamental principles. In all the other (swing) dances, overturning is a possible and often utilized tool.\n\n<<<C>>>"
