The bare Green's function $G_0$, when expressed in the basis of energy eigenstates and Matsubara frequencies, is inversely proportional to the difference between the complex frequency $i\omega_n$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The explicit functional form is $G_0(k, i\omega_n) = \frac{1}{i\omega_n - \epsilon_k}$. Therefore, the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\epsilon_k$ appear as the poles of the bare Green's function.
