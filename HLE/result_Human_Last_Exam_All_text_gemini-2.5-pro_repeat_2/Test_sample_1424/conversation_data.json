    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe Feynman path integral formalism is a powerful tool in quantum field theory and many-body physics. In this framework, physical quantities are calculated by integrating over all possible configurations of a field.\n\nThe \"bare\" or \"free\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single particle in a non-interacting system. It is defined as the time-ordered two-point correlation function of the field operators in the non-interacting ground state. For a system of fermions described by Grassmann fields $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ in imaginary time $\\tau$, the definition is:\n\n$G_0(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau; \\mathbf{x}', \\tau') = -\\langle T_\\tau[\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}', \\tau')] \\rangle_0$\n\nHere, $T_\\tau$ is the time-ordering operator, and the expectation value $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0$ is calculated using the path integral for the non-interacting action, $S_0$:\n\n$\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0 = \\frac{1}{Z_0} \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, (\\dots) \\, e^{-S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\n\nwhere $Z_0$ is the non-interacting partition function.\n\n**Step 2: Express the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe action for a general non-interacting system can be written in a compact form:\n\n$S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\hat{H}_0) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n\nHere, $\\beta = 1/k_B T$ is the inverse temperature, and $\\hat{H}_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator (e.g., $\\hat{H}_0 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2\\nabla^2}{2m} - \\mu$ for free particles). The key to finding the dependence on energy eigenvalues is to work in a basis where $\\hat{H}_0$ is diagonal.\n\n**Step 3: Change of Basis to Energy Eigenstates**\n\nThe single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ and their corresponding eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(\\mathbf{x})$ are defined by the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n\n$\\hat{H}_0 \\phi_k(\\mathbf{x}) = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k(\\mathbf{x})$\n\nThe set of eigenfunctions $\\{\\phi_k(\\mathbf{x})\\}$ forms a complete orthonormal basis. We can expand the field $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ in this basis:\n\n$\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) = \\sum_k c_k(\\tau) \\phi_k(\\mathbf{x})$\n$\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) = \\sum_k \\bar{c}_k(\\tau) \\phi_k^*(\\mathbf{x})$\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action $S_0$ and using the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions, the action simplifies and becomes diagonal in the index $k$:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\bar{c}_k(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\tau)$\n\n**Step 4: Fourier Transform to Frequency Space**\n\nThe next step is to perform a Fourier transform from imaginary time $\\tau$ to Matsubara frequencies $i\\omega_n$. For fermions, $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$.\n\n$c_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_n c_{k,n} e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau}$\n$\\bar{c}_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_n \\bar{c}_{k,n} e^{i\\omega_n \\tau}$\n\nApplying this transform to the action, the derivative $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$. The action becomes fully diagonal in both the eigenstate index $k$ and the frequency index $n$:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{c}_{k,n} (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k) c_{k,n}$\n\n**Step 5: Derive the Green's Function in the new basis**\n\nThe term multiplying $\\bar{c}_{k,n} c_{k,n}$ in the action is the *inverse* of the bare Green's function in the $(k, i\\omega_n)$ representation. Let's call it $G_0^{-1}(k, i\\omega_n)$.\n\n$G_0^{-1}(k, i\\omega_n) = -i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k$\n\nWe can also calculate the Green's function directly from its definition. In the $(k, i\\omega_n)$ basis, the Green's function is $G_0(k, i\\omega_n; k', i\\omega_{n'}) = -\\langle c_{k,n} \\bar{c}_{k',n'} \\rangle_0$. Because the action is diagonal, this expectation value is only non-zero for $k=k'$ and $n=n'$. The path integral for this component is a standard Gaussian integral for Grassmann variables, which yields:\n\n$-\\langle c_{k,n} \\bar{c}_{k,n} \\rangle_0 = \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k}$\n\nFollowing the standard physics convention (which comes from the definition of the path integral measure and action), the result is:\n\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 6: Final Analysis of the Functional Dependence**\n\nFrom the final expression $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$, the functional dependence is clear:\n\n1.  The bare Green's function $G_0$, when represented in the basis of single-particle energy eigenstates (labeled by index $k$) and Matsubara frequencies ($i\\omega_n$), is **inversely proportional** to the quantity $(i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k)$.\n2.  The single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ appears as a **pole** in the Green's function. If we analytically continue from imaginary frequency to real frequency ($i\\omega_n \\to \\omega + i\\delta$), the poles of $G_0(\\omega, k)$ are located precisely at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. This is a fundamental result: the poles of the single-particle Green's function correspond to the energies of the system's elementary excitations. For a non-interacting system, these are simply the single-particle energies.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Bare vs. Full Green's Function:** This analysis applies to the *bare* Green's function ($G_0$) for a *non-interacting* system. For an interacting system, the full Green's function $G$ has a more complex structure, where $\\epsilon_k$ is replaced by a self-energy term $\\Sigma(k, i\\omega_n)$: $G(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k - \\Sigma(k, i\\omega_n)}$.\n*   **Basis Choice is Key:** The simple relationship is only manifest when the Green's function is expressed in the basis of energy eigenstates and Matsubara frequencies. In real space and time, the relationship is more complex, involving a sum over all eigenstates: $G_0(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau; \\mathbf{x}', \\tau') = \\sum_k \\phi_k(\\mathbf{x}) \\phi_k^*(\\mathbf{x}') G_0(k, \\tau-\\tau')$.\n*   **Conventions:** The exact form (e.g., sign conventions) can vary slightly depending on the definition of the action and the Fourier transform, but the core inverse relationship and the location of the poles remain the same.\n\nIn summary, the energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ define the locations of the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$, when expressed in the basis of energy eigenstates and Matsubara frequencies, is inversely proportional to the difference between the complex frequency $i\\omega_n$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The explicit functional form is $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$. Therefore, the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ appear as the poles of the bare Green's function.>>>"
