    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology in the Question**\n\n*   **\"The Beatles\":** The artist is clearly defined. The search is limited to their official discography.\n*   **\"starts with\":** This indicates the chord progression must occur at the very beginning of the song, likely in the introduction or the first line of the verse.\n*   **\"Tonic chord\":** This is the \"home\" chord of the song's key. It is the chord built on the first note of the scale. It's represented by the Roman numeral 'I' in a major key (e.g., C major in the key of C) or 'i' in a minor key (e.g., A minor in the key of A minor).\n*   **\"Minor fifth chord\":** This is the chord built on the fifth degree of the scale, but it is a minor chord.\n    *   In a **minor key**, the chord on the fifth degree is naturally minor (e.g., in A minor, the fifth chord is E minor). This is designated as 'v'.\n    *   In a **major key**, the chord on the fifth degree is naturally major (the dominant chord, e.g., in C major, the fifth chord is G major). A *minor* fifth chord would be a \"borrowed\" chord, often from the parallel minor key (e.g., G minor in the key of C major). This is also designated as 'v'.\n*   **\"Chord jump\":** This implies a direct and noticeable transition from the first chord to the second.\n\nSo, the question is asking for a Beatles song that starts with a progression of **I -> v** (in a major key) or **i -> v** (in a minor key).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze and Rule Out Common Incorrect Guesses**\n\n*   **\"Michelle\":** This song from the album *Rubber Soul* is famous for its sophisticated harmony and is often mistakenly cited as the answer.\n    *   The song is in the key of F major, but the iconic introductory guitar riff begins on an **F minor** chord (the tonic minor, 'i'), not the F major tonic.\n    *   The next chord in the intro is **B-flat minor** ('iv'). So the intro progression is **i -> iv**. This is not a jump to the minor fifth.\n    *   The vocal verse begins on an **F major** chord (\"Michelle, ma belle...\"), which is the tonic ('I'). However, the next main chord is a **G minor** chord (\"...words that go together well...\"), which is the supertonic ('ii'). The progression is **I -> ii**. This is also not a jump to the minor fifth.\n    *   Therefore, \"Michelle\" does not fit the description.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Starts with a famously loud, dissonant, and complex chord that is not a simple tonic.\n\n*   **\"Yesterday\":** Starts on the tonic chord (F major) but moves to an E minor 7th chord. While Em is related to the key, this functions as part of a more complex descending pattern (I -> vii -> V/vi -> vi), not a direct tonic-to-fifth jump.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Correct Song by Analysis**\n\nLet's examine the song **\"Things We Said Today\"** from the album *A Hard Day's Night*.\n\n*   **Key:** The song is in the key of A minor.\n*   **Tonic Chord (i):** The tonic chord is **A minor (Am)**.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** In the key of A minor, the fifth note of the scale is E. The naturally occurring chord built on this note is **E minor (Em)**.\n*   **Song Structure:** The song begins with a very brief intro of a single A major chord played staccato on an acoustic guitar. This A major chord functions as a dramatic pickup, shifting mood immediately as the song's main body begins.\n*   **Opening Progression:** The first line of the verse starts immediately after the intro:\n    *   On the words \"You say you will love me...\", the chord is **A minor (i)**.\n    *   On the words \"...if I have to go...\", the chord changes directly to **E minor (v)**.\n\nThis creates the exact **i -> v** (tonic to minor fifth) progression the question describes, right at the start of the song's primary musical theme. The \"jump\" is emphasized by the switch from the bright A major intro chord to the melancholic A minor verse.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile other Beatles songs have interesting openings, \"Things We Said Today\" is the one that precisely matches the specified chord progression of a jump from the tonic chord to the minor fifth chord at its start.\n\n<<<Things We Said Today>>>"
