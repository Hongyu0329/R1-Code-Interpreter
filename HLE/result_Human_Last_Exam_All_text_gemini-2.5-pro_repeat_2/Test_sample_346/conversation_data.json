    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to evaluate the given SKI combinator expression, which represents a Church numeral `n`, and then find the value of `log_2(n)`.\n\n### Step 2: Define the SKI Combinator Rules\nThe fundamental reduction rules for the S, K, and I combinators are:\n*   **S x y z = x z (y z)**\n*   **K x y = x**\n*   **I x = x**\n\n### Step 3: Understand Church Numerals in SKI Logic\nA Church numeral `n` is a higher-order function that takes a function `f` and a value `x` and applies `f` to `x` a total of `n` times.\n*   `n f x = f(f(...f(x)...))` (`n` applications of `f`)\n*   `0 f x = x`\n*   `1 f x = f x`\n*   `2 f x = f(f x)`\n\nSome standard representations in SKI are:\n*   `1` is represented by `I`.\n*   The successor function, `SUCC`, which transforms `n` to `n+1`, is `SUCC = S(S(K S) K)`.\n*   Therefore, `2 = SUCC(1) = S(S(K S) K) I`.\n*   And `3 = SUCC(2) = S(S(K S) K) (S(S(K S) K) I)`.\n\n### Step 4: Deconstruct the Given Expression\nLet's break down the complex expression into smaller, manageable parts.\n\nThe expression is: `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's define some aliases for recurring patterns:\n1.  `SUCC = S(S(K(S))(K))`\n2.  `TWO_A = SUCC(I) = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`. This is the standard Church numeral for **2**.\n3.  Let's analyze `S(I)(I)`:\n    *   `S(I)(I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`. This is `2 f x`.\n    *   So, `TWO_B = S(I)(I)` is another representation of the Church numeral **2**.\n4.  `THREE = SUCC(TWO_B) = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`. Since `TWO_B` is `2`, `SUCC(2)` is the Church numeral for **3**.\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression `E` using these aliases:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(TWO_A))))(THREE)`\nSubstituting the numeral values:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2))))(3)`\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the `S(I)` Combinator\nThe structure `S(I)` appears repeatedly. Let's analyze its behavior. Let's call it `Φ` (Phi).\n*   `Φ x y = S(I) x y`\n*   Applying the `S` rule: `S I x y = I y (x y)`\n*   Applying the `I` rule: `I y (x y) = y (x y)`\n*   So, the reduction rule for `S(I)` is: **`S(I) x y = y (x y)`**\n\n### Step 6: Reduce the Expression using the `S(I)` Rule\nOur expression is of the form `S(I) A B`, where `A = S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))` and `B = 3`.\n\nLet's apply the rule `S(I) x y = y (x y)` from the outside in.\n1.  `E = S(I) (S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))) (3)`\n    *   Here, `x = S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))` and `y = 3`.\n    *   `E = 3 ( (S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))) 3 )`\n\n2.  Now evaluate the inner part: `(S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))) 3`\n    *   This is `S(I) x' y'` where `x' = S(I)(K(2))` and `y' = 3`.\n    *   Result: `3 ( (S(I)(K(2))) 3 )`\n    *   Substituting back into `E`: `E = 3 ( 3 ( (S(I)(K(2))) 3 ) )`\n\n3.  Evaluate the next inner part: `(S(I)(K(2))) 3`\n    *   This is `S(I) x'' y''` where `x'' = K(2)` and `y'' = 3`.\n    *   Result: `3 ( (K(2)) 3 )`\n    *   Substituting back into `E`: `E = 3 ( 3 ( 3 ( (K(2)) 3 ) ) )`\n\n4.  Finally, evaluate the innermost part: `(K(2)) 3`\n    *   Using the `K` rule `K x y = x`: `K(2) 3 = 2`.\n\n5.  Substitute the final result back into the expression for `E`:\n    *   **`E = 3(3(3(2)))`**\n\n### Step 7: Interpret the Application of Church Numerals\nThe expression `E` simplifies to one Church numeral applied to another, nested three times. We need to understand what the operation `m n` (applying numeral `m` to numeral `n`) means.\n*   A Church numeral `m` is `λf.λx. f^m x`. It takes a function `f` and applies it `m` times.\n*   When we compute `m n`, we are passing the numeral `n` as the function argument to `m`.\n*   `m n = (λf.λx. f^m x) n = λx. n^m x`.\n*   This new function `λx. n^m x` is not yet a Church numeral. To make it one, we need to see how it acts on a generic function `f` and argument `x`.\n*   Let the resulting Church numeral be `p`. Then `p f x = (m n) f x`.\n*   `(m n) f x = (λy. n^m y) f x = (n^m f) x`.\n*   `n^m f` means applying the numeral `n` to the function `f`, `m` times.\n    *   `n f = λx. f^n x`\n    *   `n(n f) = λx. (n f)^n x = λx. (λy. f^n y)^n x = λx. f^(n*n) x = λx. f^(n^2) x`\n    *   By induction, `n^m f = λx. f^(n^m) x`.\n*   Therefore, `(n^m f) x = (λy. f^(n^m) y) x = f^(n^m) x`.\n*   This means that `m n` represents the Church numeral for **`n^m`**.\n\n### Step 8: Calculate the Final Value\nNow we can evaluate `E = 3(3(3(2)))` using the exponentiation rule `m(n) = n^m`.\n1.  Innermost application: `3(2)`\n    *   `m=3`, `n=2`. The result is `2^3 = 8`.\n2.  Middle application: `3(8)`\n    *   `m=3`, `n=8`. The result is `8^3 = (2^3)^3 = 2^(3*3) = 2^9`.\n3.  Outermost application: `3(2^9)`\n    *   `m=3`, `n=2^9`. The result is `(2^9)^3 = 2^(9*3) = 2^{27}`.\n\nSo, the given expression `E` is the Church numeral `n = 2^{27}`.\n\n### Step 9: Answer the Question\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n*   `n = 2^{27}`\n*   `log_2(n) = log_2(2^{27}) = 27`\n\nThe final answer is 27.\n\n<<<27>>>"
