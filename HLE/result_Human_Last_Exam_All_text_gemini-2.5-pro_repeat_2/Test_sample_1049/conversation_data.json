    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the sum**\n\nThe sum is a convolution of two sequences. Let $C_m = \\binom{2m}{m}$ be the $m$-th central binomial coefficient. The sum can be written as:\n$S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} f(k) C_k C_{n-k}$, where $f(k) = (2k+1)^5$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the generating function approach**\n\nThe convolution of two sequences corresponds to the product of their ordinary generating functions. Let $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} f(k) C_k x^k$ and $C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} C_k x^k$. Then $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product $A(x)C(x)$, denoted as $S_n = [x^n] (A(x)C(x))$.\n\nThe generating function for the central binomial coefficients is well-known:\n$C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n\nThe convolution of $C_k$ with itself is:\n$\\sum_{k=0}^{n} C_k C_{n-k} = [x^n] C(x)^2 = [x^n] \\frac{1}{1-4x} = 4^n$.\n\n**Step 3: Exploit the structure of $f(k) = (2k+1)^5$**\n\nThe term $(2k+1)$ suggests a transformation. Let's express $(2k+1)$ in terms of the summation index $k$ and the parameter $n$. A key insight is to write $2k+1$ as $(2k-n) + (n+1)$. This is useful because the term $(2k-n)$ has symmetry properties.\n\nLet's expand $(2k+1)^5$ using the binomial theorem:\n$(2k+1)^5 = ((2k-n) + (n+1))^5 = \\sum_{j=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{j} (n+1)^{5-j} (2k-n)^j$.\n\nSubstituting this into the sum for $S_n$:\n$S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{j} (n+1)^{5-j} (2k-n)^j\\right) C_k C_{n-k}$\n$S_n = \\sum_{j=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{j} (n+1)^{5-j} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} (2k-n)^j C_k C_{n-k}\\right)$.\n\nLet's define $T_j(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (2k-n)^j C_k C_{n-k}$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the sums $T_j(n)$**\n\nFor odd values of $j$, the sum $T_j(n)$ is zero. This can be seen by substituting $l=n-k$:\n$T_j(n) = \\sum_{l=0}^{n} (2(n-l)-n)^j C_{n-l} C_l = \\sum_{l=0}^{n} (n-2l)^j C_{n-l} C_l = (-1)^j \\sum_{l=0}^{n} (2l-n)^j C_l C_{n-l} = (-1)^j T_j(n)$.\nIf $j$ is odd, $T_j(n) = -T_j(n)$, which implies $T_j(n)=0$.\n\nSo, we only need to consider the terms for $j=0, 2, 4$:\n$S_n = \\binom{5}{0}(n+1)^5 T_0(n) + \\binom{5}{2}(n+1)^3 T_2(n) + \\binom{5}{4}(n+1)^1 T_4(n)$\n$S_n = 1 \\cdot (n+1)^5 T_0(n) + 10(n+1)^3 T_2(n) + 5(n+1) T_4(n)$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate $T_j(n)$ for $j=0, 2, 4$**\n\n*   **$T_0(n)$**: $T_0(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^n C_k C_{n-k} = 4^n$.\n\n*   **$T_2(n)$**: This is a known identity related to the variance of a specific probability distribution.\n    $T_2(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^n (2k-n)^2 C_k C_{n-k} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} 4^n$.\n\n*   **$T_4(n)$**: This is the fourth moment. The calculation is more involved but can be done using generating functions. The result is:\n    $T_4(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^n (2k-n)^4 C_k C_{n-k} = 4^n \\left( 8\\binom{n+3}{4} + 60\\binom{n+2}{4} + 36\\binom{n+1}{4} + \\binom{n}{4} - 4n^4 - 3n^3 \\right)$.\n    While correct, this expression is complicated. However, we can substitute it into the formula for $S_n$ and observe that the result must be a polynomial in $n$ of degree 5 multiplied by $4^n$.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results and find the polynomial for $S_n/4^n$**\n\nLet $R_5(n) = S_n/4^n$. From the previous steps, we have:\n$R_5(n) = (n+1)^5 + 10(n+1)^3 \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 5(n+1) \\frac{T_4(n)}{4^n}$\n$R_5(n) = (n+1)^5 + 5n(n+1)^4 + 5(n+1) \\frac{T_4(n)}{4^n}$\n$R_5(n) = (n+1)^4 (n+1+5n) + 5(n+1) \\frac{T_4(n)}{4^n} = (n+1)^4 (6n+1) + 5(n+1) \\frac{T_4(n)}{4^n}$.\n\nFrom this expression, it is clear that $R_5(n)$ is divisible by $(n+1)$ (since $T_4(n)$ is divisible by $n(n+1)$ for $n \\ge 1$, which can be verified, and $T_4(0)=0$). Let $R_5(n) = (n+1)R'_5(n)$.\n$R'_5(n)$ must be a polynomial in $n$ of degree 4.\n\nWe can determine the polynomial $R'_5(n)$ by finding its values for $n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$ and using the Newton series representation.\nLet's find the first few values of $S_n$ by direct summation:\n$S_0 = (1)^5 C_0 C_0 = 1$.\n$S_1 = (1)^5 C_0 C_1 + (3)^5 C_1 C_0 = 1(1)(2) + 243(2)(1) = 2+486 = 488$.\n$S_2 = (1)^5 C_0 C_2 + (3)^5 C_1 C_1 + (5)^5 C_2 C_0 = 1(1)(6) + 243(2)(2) + 3125(6)(1) = 6 + 972 + 18750 = 19728$.\n$S_3 = 1(20) + 243(12) + 3125(12) + 16807(20) = 20 + 2916 + 37500 + 336140 = 376576$.\n$S_4 = 1(70)+243(40)+3125(36)+16807(40)+59049(70) = 70+9720+112500+672280+4133430 = 4928000$.\n\nNow we find the values for $R'_5(n) = S_n / (4^n(n+1))$:\n$R'_5(0) = S_0 / (4^0(1)) = 1/1 = 1$.\n$R'_5(1) = S_1 / (4^1(2)) = 488/8 = 61$.\n$R'_5(2) = S_2 / (4^2(3)) = 19728/48 = 411$.\n$R'_5(3) = S_3 / (4^3(4)) = 376576/256 = 1471$.\n$R'_5(4) = S_4 / (4^4(5)) = 4928000/1280 = 3850$.\n\nLet $R'_5(n) = A\\binom{n}{4} + B\\binom{n}{3} + C\\binom{n}{2} + D\\binom{n}{1} + E\\binom{n}{0}$.\nThe coefficients can be found using the forward difference formula, $\\Delta^k P(0) = c_k k!$.\n$E = R'_5(0) = 1$.\n$D = R'_5(1) - R'_5(0) = 61-1 = 60$.\n$C = (\\text{R'}_5(2)-\\text{R'}_5(1)) - D = (411-61)-60 = 350-60=290$. No, $\\Delta^2 P(0) = P(2)-2P(1)+P(0) = 411-2(61)+1 = 411-122+1=290$. $C=290$.\n$B = \\Delta^3 R'_5(0) = (R'_5(3)-3R'_5(2)+3R'_5(1)-R'_5(0)) = 1471-3(411)+3(61)-1 = 1471-1233+183-1 = 420$.\n$A = \\Delta^4 R'_5(0) = (R'_5(4)-4R'_5(3)+6R'_5(2)-4R'_5(1)+R'_5(0)) = 3850-4(1471)+6(411)-4(61)+1 = 3850-5884+2466-244+1 = 189$.\n\nSo, the polynomial is:\n$R'_5(n) = 189\\binom{n}{4} + 420\\binom{n}{3} + 290\\binom{n}{2} + 60\\binom{n}{1} + 1$.\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer Formulation**\n\nCombining the parts, we get the closed form for the sum:\n$S_n = 4^n R_5(n) = 4^n (n+1) R'_5(n)$.\n$S_n = 4^n (n+1) \\left(189\\binom{n}{4} + 420\\binom{n}{3} + 290\\binom{n}{2} + 60\\binom{n}{1} + 1\\right)$.\n\nThis expression is a closed form, as it involves a finite number of terms and well-known functions (powers, polynomials, and binomial coefficients)."
