    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form of the given discrete-time system using duality.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Duality**\n\nThe problem asks to reduce the system `x(k+1) = Ax(k), y(k) = Cx(k)` to its observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)`. We must use the principle of duality.\n\nDuality connects the observability of a system `(A, C)` to the controllability of its dual system `(A^T, C^T)`. The observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)` of the original system is defined by the transposes of the controller canonical form matrices `(A_c, B_c)` of the dual system.\nSpecifically:\n`A_o = A_c^T`\n`C_o = B_c^T`\n\nOur task is to:\n1.  Define the dual system `(A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T)`.\n2.  Find a controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)` for this dual system.\n3.  Take the transpose of `B_c` to find the new matrix `C_o`.\n\n**2. Define the Dual System**\n\nThe given system matrices are:\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe dual system matrices `(A_d, B_d)` are:\n`A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n**3. Find the Controller Canonical Form of the Dual System**\n\nFirst, we need to check the controllability of the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` and determine its controllability indices. The controllability matrix `W_c` is constructed from the columns of `B_d` and their products with `A_d`. Let the columns of `B_d` be `b1` and `b2`.\n\n`b1 = [0, 1, 0]^T`\n`b2 = [1, 1, 0]^T`\n\n`A_d * b1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T`\n`A_d * b2 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [1, 1, 0]^T = [3, 2, 1]^T`\n\nWe select `n=3` linearly independent vectors from the sequence `b1, b2, A_d*b1, A_d*b2, ...`.\n- `b1` is non-zero.\n- `b2` is linearly independent of `b1`.\n- `A_d*b1` is linearly independent of `{b1, b2}` since `det([b1, b2, A_d*b1]) = det([[0,1,2],[1,1,1],[0,0,1]]) = -1 \\neq 0`.\n\nWe have found 3 linearly independent vectors: `{b1, b2, A_d*b1}`. We took two vectors from the chain starting with `b1` (`b1`, `A_d*b1`) and one vector from the chain starting with `b2` (`b2`). Thus, the controllability indices are `μ₁ = 2` and `μ₂ = 1`.\n\nNow, we construct the transformation matrix `T` that transforms `(A_d, B_d)` to controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`. There are several controller canonical forms; we will derive one standard form.\n\nThe transformation matrix `T` is constructed based on the selection matrix `S` of linearly independent vectors, ordered by chains:\n`S = [b1, A_d*b1, b2] = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\nThe inverse is `S⁻¹ = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, -2, -2]]`.\n\nWe select the rows from `S⁻¹` that correspond to the last vector in each chain in `S`.\n-   The last vector of the first chain (`b1` chain) is `A_d*b1`, which is the 2nd column of `S`. We take the 2nd row of `S⁻¹`: `w₁ = [0, 0, 1]`.\n-   The last vector of the second chain (`b2` chain) is `b2`, which is the 3rd column of `S`. We take the 3rd row of `S⁻¹`: `w₂ = [1, -2, -2]`.\n\nThe transformation matrix `T` is built from these rows and their products with `A_d`:\n`T = [w₁; w₁*A_d; w₂]`\n`w₁*A_d = [0, 0, 1] * A_d = [0, 1, 0]`\n`T = [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, -2, -2]]`\n\nThe controller canonical matrices are `A_c = T * A_d * T⁻¹` and `B_c = T * B_d`. We only need to compute `B_c`.\n\n`B_c = T * B_d = [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, -2, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n`B_c = [[0*0+0*1+1*0, 0*1+0*1+1*0], [0*0+1*1+0*0, 0*1+1*1+0*0], [1*0-2*1-2*0, 1*1-2*1-2*0]]`\n`B_c = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [-2, -1]]`\n\n**4. Determine the New C Matrix**\n\nThe new `C` matrix for the observer canonical form, `C_o`, is the transpose of `B_c`.\n\n`C_o = B_c^T = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [-2, -1]]^T`\n`C_o = [[0, 1, -2], [0, 1, -1]]`\n\nThis is the final value for the new matrix C.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation Summary:\n1.  **Dual System:** `A_d = A^T`, `B_d = C^T`.\n2.  **Controllability Indices:** Found to be `μ₁=2, μ₂=1`.\n3.  **Transformation Matrix T:** Constructed based on the dual system's controllability properties. `T = [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, -2, -2]]`.\n4.  **Controller Canonical B_c:** `B_c = T * B_d = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [-2, -1]]`.\n5.  **Observer Canonical C_o:** `C_o = B_c^T`.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe value of the new matrix C is `C_o`.\n\n<<<[[0, 1, -2], [0, 1, -1]]>>>"
