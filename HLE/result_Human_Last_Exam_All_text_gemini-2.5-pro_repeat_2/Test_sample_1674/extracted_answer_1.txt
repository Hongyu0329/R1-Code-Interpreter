Yes, the theory can fail. The failure occurs if the procedure used to calculate the inverse propagation path does not account for the presence of the birefringent medium. If the inverse calculation is based only on the random medium (T) and free space (P), but the actual forward path includes the birefringent medium (B), the calculated input will be incorrect. Specifically, the calculated input will be the original input transformed by the birefringent medium's Jones matrix (`B * E_in`) rather than the original input itself (`E_in`). Since `B` is not an identity matrix, the calculated input will not match the actual input, and the theory fails.
