    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the answer choices to determine the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Movement: Cambré Derrière**\n    *   \"Cambré\" means \"arched.\" \"Derrière\" means \"to the back.\"\n    *   A cambré derrière is a backward bend of the torso from the waist.\n    *   The movement should primarily originate from the upper and middle back, with the chest lifting towards the ceiling.\n    *   The head follows the line of the spine, and the arms (port de bras) coordinate with the bend to create a harmonious line.\n\n2.  **Understand the Methods: Vaganova vs. Balanchine**\n    *   **Vaganova Method:** Developed in Russia by Agrippina Vaganova, this method is the foundation of Russian ballet. It is known for its precision, strength, clean lines, and a very logical, step-by-step training system. It emphasizes core strength and stability.\n    *   **Balanchine Method:** Developed in America by George Balanchine, this method is characterized by extreme speed, musicality, dynamic movement, and pushing classical lines to their limits. It often features a more \"off-balance\" aesthetic to create energy and visual excitement.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Answer Choices in the Context of the Two Methods:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there can be stylistic differences in the port de bras (carriage of the arms) and the use of an *allongé* (extended line) between the two methods, this is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the cambré itself. Both methods have specific rules for arm placement designed to complement the movement.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is a key point of divergence.\n        *   **Vaganova:** The Vaganova method places a very strong emphasis on maintaining a stable and square pelvis. In a cambré derrière, the hips must remain directly over the feet. The dancer is taught to lift up and out of the waist and bend from the upper back, actively resisting the urge to push the hips forward. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault as it breaks the pure classical line and indicates a lack of back strength and control.\n        *   **Balanchine:** The Balanchine aesthetic often embraces a more dynamic and extended line. In a cambré derrière, dancers are frequently encouraged to press the hips forward. This creates a visually deeper, more dramatic curve and an \"off-balance\" look that is characteristic of Balanchine's style. This forward hip placement is a deliberate stylistic choice.\n    *   **C. Speed:** A cambré is typically a slow, controlled movement (adagio) in both training methods. While Balanchine's choreography is famous for its speed, the execution of the cambré itself is not defined by being faster than in Vaganova. The principle of control applies to both.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The apparent degree of the backbend is often a *result* of the technique used, not the cause of the difference. By pushing the hips forward, the Balanchine cambré can *appear* deeper or more extreme. However, the foundational technical instruction that creates this difference is the hip placement. A Vaganova dancer with exceptional flexibility can also achieve a very deep backbend, but they will do so while keeping the hips stable. Therefore, hip placement is the more fundamental difference.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head placement follows a similar principle: it continues the line of the spine as it bends backward. The head should not be dropped or thrown back disconnectedly. While there might be subtle stylistic nuances, it is not the primary distinguishing feature.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most significant and widely recognized technical difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière lies in the **placement of the hip**. The Vaganova method insists on stable hips held vertically over the feet, while the Balanchine method encourages a forward push of the hips to create a more dynamic and extreme line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
