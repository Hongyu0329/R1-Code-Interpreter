The solutions for $z \in \mathbb{C}$ are given by the formula $z_{k,n} = i \frac{W_n(-(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi))}{\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi}$ for all integers $k$ and $n$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function. These solutions can be categorized as:
1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.
2.  An infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions: $z_m = -i \frac{W_0(2m\pi - \pi/2)}{2m\pi - \pi/2}$ for every positive integer $m$.
3.  All other solutions are complex numbers with non-zero real and imaginary parts.
