    "Answering the question requires solving the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for all complex numbers $z$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the equation using the definition of complex exponentiation.**\nThe term $i^z$ is a multi-valued expression in complex analysis. The general definition of $a^b$ for complex numbers $a, b$ is $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. The complex logarithm $\\log a$ is also multi-valued: $\\log a = \\ln|a| + i(\\arg(a) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\n\nFor $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nSo, $\\log i = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's denote $\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. So, $\\log i = i\\theta_k$.\n\nSubstituting this into the original equation, we get a family of equations, one for each integer $k$:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\log i} = e^{z (i\\theta_k)} = e^{iz\\theta_k}$\n\n**Step 2: Solve the equation for z.**\nTo solve $zi = e^{iz\\theta_k}$, we can use a substitution to simplify the equation.\nLet $W = zi$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$W = e^{W\\theta_k}$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to fit the standard form for the Lambert W function.\n$W e^{-W\\theta_k} = 1$\nLet $U = -W\\theta_k$. Then $W = -U/\\theta_k$. Substituting this gives:\n$(-\\frac{U}{\\theta_k}) e^U = 1$\n$Ue^U = -\\theta_k$\n\nThe Lambert W function, denoted $W(x)$, is defined as the function satisfying $W(x)e^{W(x)} = x$. Since the exponential function is not injective on $\\mathbb{C}$, the Lambert W function is multi-valued for complex arguments, with branches denoted by $W_n(x)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe solutions for $U$ are given by the branches of the Lambert W function:\n$U = W_n(-\\theta_k)$ for any integer $n$.\n\n**Step 3: Express z in terms of the Lambert W function.**\nNow we substitute back to find $z$.\n$U = -W\\theta_k \\implies W = -\\frac{U}{\\theta_k} = -\\frac{W_n(-\\theta_k)}{\\theta_k}$\nAnd $W = zi \\implies z = \\frac{W}{i} = -iW$.\nSo, the general solution for $z$ is:\n$z_{k,n} = -i \\left( -\\frac{W_n(-\\theta_k)}{\\theta_k} \\right) = i \\frac{W_n(-\\theta_k)}{\\theta_k}$\nSubstituting back $\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, we get the full set of solutions:\n$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for all integers $k$ and $n$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the solutions to find specific types.**\nWe can categorize the solutions based on whether they are real, purely imaginary, or complex.\n\n**A. Real Solutions ($z \\in \\mathbb{R}$)**\nFor $z$ to be real, $z_{k,n}$ must be real. Since $\\theta_k$ is real, $i \\frac{W_n(-\\theta_k)}{\\theta_k}$ is real if and only if $W_n(-\\theta_k)$ is purely imaginary.\nLet $W_n(-\\theta_k) = ib$ for some real number $b$.\nFrom the defining equation $Ue^U = -\\theta_k$, we have:\n$ib e^{ib} = -\\theta_k \\implies ib(\\cos b + i \\sin b) = -\\theta_k \\implies -b\\sin b + ib\\cos b = -\\theta_k$\nEquating the real and imaginary parts:\n1.  $-b\\sin b = -\\theta_k \\implies b\\sin b = \\theta_k = (\\frac{1}{2}+2k)\\pi$\n2.  $b\\cos b = 0$\n\nFrom (2), either $b=0$ or $\\cos b = 0$.\nIf $b=0$, then from (1), $\\theta_k=0$, which is impossible.\nSo, $\\cos b = 0$, which means $b = (j+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$ for some integer $j$.\nThen $\\sin b = \\sin((j+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi) = (-1)^j$.\nSubstituting into (1):\n$(j+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi \\cdot (-1)^j = (\\frac{1}{2}+2k)\\pi \\implies (j+\\frac{1}{2})(-1)^j = \\frac{1}{2}+2k$\n-   If $j$ is even ($j=2p$): $(2p+\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}+2k \\implies p=k$.\n    So for any $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we can choose $j=2k$.\n    $b = (2k+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$. Then $U = ib = i(2k+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$.\n    $z = i \\frac{U}{\\theta_k} = i \\frac{i(2k+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi}{(\\frac{1}{2}+2k)\\pi} = -1$.\n    Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution for any choice of logarithm branch $k$.\n-   If $j$ is odd ($j=2p-1$): $-(2p-1+\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}+2k \\implies -2p+\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}+2k \\implies p=-k$.\n    So for any $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we can choose $j=2(-k)-1 = -2k-1$.\n    $b = (-2k-1+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi = (-2k-\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$. Then $U = ib = i(-2k-\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$.\n    $z = i \\frac{U}{\\theta_k} = i \\frac{i(-2k-\\frac{1}{2})\\pi}{(\\frac{1}{2}+2k)\\pi} = \\frac{-(-(2k+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi)}{(\\frac{1}{2}+2k)\\pi} = 1$.\n    Thus, $z=1$ is a solution for any choice of logarithm branch $k$.\n\n**B. Purely Imaginary Solutions ($z \\in i\\mathbb{R}$)**\nFor $z$ to be purely imaginary, $i \\frac{W_n(-\\theta_k)}{\\theta_k}$ is purely imaginary if and only if $W_n(-\\theta_k)$ is real.\nThe Lambert W function $W_n(x)$ has real values only if its argument $x$ is real and $x \\ge -1/e$. The branches that can take real values are $n=0$ (the principal branch) and $n=-1$.\nThe argument is $-\\theta_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)$.\nWe need $-\\theta_k \\ge -1/e \\implies \\theta_k \\le 1/e \\approx 0.367$.\n-   If $k \\ge 0$, $\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 1/e$. So there are no real values for $W_n(-\\theta_k)$, and thus no purely imaginary solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n-   If $k < 0$, let $k = -m$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n    $\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2m\\pi < 0$, so $-\\theta_k = 2m\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} > 0$.\n    Since $-\\theta_k > 0$, there is exactly one real value for $W_n(-\\theta_k)$, given by the principal branch $n=0$. Let this be $U_0 = W_0(-\\theta_k)$.\n    This gives an infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions, one for each positive integer $m$:\n    $z_m = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-2m\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}-2m\\pi} = -i \\frac{W_0(2m\\pi-\\frac{\\pi}{2})}{2m\\pi-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$.\n\n**C. Other Complex Solutions**\nFor all other pairs of integers $(k, n)$ not covered above, the value of $W_n(-\\theta_k)$ is a complex number that is neither real nor purely imaginary. This leads to a doubly infinite set of complex solutions $z_{k,n}$ where both the real and imaginary parts are non-zero.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\nThe solutions to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ can be classified into three types:\n\n1.  **Real solutions:** $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  **Purely imaginary solutions:** An infinite sequence of solutions $z_m = iy_m$ for $m=1, 2, 3, \\dots$, where $y_m = -\\frac{W_0(2m\\pi - \\pi/2)}{2m\\pi - \\pi/2}$ and $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n3.  **Other complex solutions:** A doubly infinite set of solutions $z_{k,n} = x+iy$ (with $x,y \\neq 0$) given by the general formula $z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for all integers $k, n$ not falling into the two categories above.\n\n<<<The solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ are given by the formula $z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for all integers $k$ and $n$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function. These solutions can be categorized as:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions: $z_m = -i \\frac{W_0(2m\\pi - \\pi/2)}{2m\\pi - \\pi/2}$ for every positive integer $m$.\n3.  All other solutions are complex numbers with non-zero real and imaginary parts.>>>"
