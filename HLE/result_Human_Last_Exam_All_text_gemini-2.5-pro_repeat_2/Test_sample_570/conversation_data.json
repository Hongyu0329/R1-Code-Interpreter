    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Formalize the problem and the set of lines\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum area of a convex domain `K` in the plane that intersects every line `L_{p,q}` with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nLet `S` be the set of all pairs of coprime integers: `S = {(p, q) ∈ Z² | gcd(p, q) = 1}`.\nThe set of lines is `L = {L_{p,q} | px + qy = 1, (p, q) ∈ S}`.\nThe condition is that `K ∩ L_{p,q} ≠ ∅` for all `(p, q) ∈ S`.\n\n### Step 2: Translate the intersection condition using support functions\n\nFor a convex set `K`, its support function `h_K(u)` for a vector `u = (p, q)` is defined as `h_K(u) = sup {p*x + q*y | (x, y) ∈ K}`.\nThe minimum value of the linear function `p*x + q*y` over `K` is `inf {p*x + q*y | (x, y) ∈ K}`, which we can denote `inf_K(u)`.\n\nA line `px + qy = c` intersects a convex set `K` if and only if the value `c` is between the minimum and maximum values of the linear function on `K`. That is, `inf_K(p, q) ≤ c ≤ h_K(p, q)`.\n\nIn our case, `c = 1`. So for every `(p, q) ∈ S`, we must have:\n`inf_K(p, q) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(p, q)`.\n\nThis condition must hold for all `(p, q) ∈ S`. Note that if `(p, q) ∈ S`, then `(-p, -q) ∈ S` as well. Applying the condition to `(-p, -q)` gives:\n`inf_K(-p, -q) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(-p, -q)`.\n\nWe know that `h_K(-u) = -inf_K(u)` and `inf_K(-u) = -h_K(u)`. So the second condition becomes:\n`-h_K(p, q) ≤ 1 ≤ -inf_K(p, q)`.\nThis is equivalent to `h_K(p, q) ≥ -1` and `inf_K(p, q) ≤ -1`.\n\nCombining the conditions for `(p, q)` and `(-p, -q)`, we find that for any `(p, q) ∈ S`, `K` must satisfy:\n1. `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1`\n2. `inf_K(p, q) ≤ -1`\n\n### Step 3: Reduce the problem to centrally symmetric convex sets\n\nLet `K` be any convex domain satisfying the conditions. Consider its central symmetrization, `K_s = (K - K) / 2 = { (x - y) / 2 | x, y ∈ K }`.\n- `K_s` is a centrally symmetric convex set (symmetric with respect to the origin).\n- By the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, `Area(K_s) ≤ Area(K)`.\n- The support function of `K_s` is `h_{K_s}(u) = (h_K(u) - inf_K(u)) / 2`.\n\nUsing the inequalities from Step 2 (`h_K(u) ≥ 1` and `inf_K(u) ≤ -1`), we get:\n`h_{K_s}(u) ≥ (1 - (-1)) / 2 = 1`.\nSo, if `K` is a solution, then `K_s` is a centrally symmetric solution, and its area is no larger than the area of `K`. Therefore, the minimal area must be achieved by a centrally symmetric convex set.\n\nFor a centrally symmetric set `K`, `inf_K(u) = -h_K(u)`. The conditions `h_K(u) ≥ 1` and `inf_K(u) ≤ -1` both simplify to `h_K(u) ≥ 1`.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the minimum area of a centrally symmetric convex set `K` such that `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1` for all `(p, q) ∈ S`.\n\n### Step 4: Use duality to transform the problem\n\nLet `K` be a centrally symmetric convex body containing the origin. Its polar body, `K^\\circ`, is defined as `K^\\circ = {u | u · x ≤ 1 for all x ∈ K}`. `K^\\circ` is also a centrally symmetric convex body.\n\nThe support function `h_K(u)` is related to the gauge function of the polar body, `g_{K^\\circ}(u) = inf{λ > 0 | u ∈ λK^\\circ}`. The relation is `h_K(u) = g_{K^\\circ}(u)`.\n\nThe condition `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1` for all `(p, q) ∈ S` becomes `g_{K^\\circ}(p, q) ≥ 1` for all `(p, q) ∈ S`.\nBy the definition of the gauge function, `g_{K^\\circ}(u) ≥ 1` means that the point `u` is not in the interior of `K^\\circ`.\nTherefore, the condition on `K` is equivalent to the condition that its polar body `K^\\circ` contains no primitive integer points in its interior.\n`S ∩ int(K^\\circ) = ∅`.\n\n### Step 5: Bound the area of the polar body using Minkowski's Theorem\n\nMinkowski's first theorem on convex bodies states that if `C` is a centrally symmetric convex body in `R²` with `Area(C) > 4`, then `C` must contain at least one non-zero integer lattice point `v ∈ Z²`.\n\nIf `K^\\circ` contained a non-zero integer point `v` in its interior, `v` could be written as `v = d · u` where `u` is a primitive integer point (`u ∈ S`) and `d` is a positive integer. Since `K^\\circ` is convex and contains the origin, if `v` is in its interior, the point `u = (1/d)v` must also be in its interior.\nThis would contradict our condition `S ∩ int(K^\\circ) = ∅`.\nTherefore, the interior of `K^\\circ` cannot contain any non-zero integer points. By Minkowski's theorem, this implies that `Area(K^\\circ) ≤ 4`.\n\n### Step 6: Find the minimum area of K using Mahler's inequality\n\nWe want to find the minimum possible `Area(K)`. The area of a convex body `K` and its polar `K^\\circ` are related by the Blaschke-Santaló inequality (`Area(K)Area(K^\\circ) ≤ π²`) and Mahler's inequality. For centrally symmetric convex bodies in `R²`, Mahler proved:\n`Area(K) · Area(K^\\circ) ≥ 8`.\n\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we should maximize `Area(K^\\circ)`. From the previous step, the maximum possible area for `K^\\circ` is 4.\nPlugging this into the inequality:\n`Area(K) ≥ 8 / Area(K^\\circ) ≥ 8 / 4 = 2`.\nThis establishes a lower bound for the area: the minimal area is at least 2.\n\n### Step 7: Construct a domain that achieves the minimal area\n\nTo show that 2 is indeed the minimum area, we need to find a convex domain `K` that satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2.\nThe equality in Mahler's inequality, `Area(K)Area(K^\\circ) = 8`, holds if and only if `K` (and thus `K^\\circ`) is a parallelogram.\n\nWe need to find a parallelogram `K^\\circ` such that:\n1. It is centrally symmetric.\n2. `Area(K^\\circ) = 4`.\n3. It contains no primitive integer points in its interior.\n\nA simple choice is the square `K^\\circ = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`.\n1. It is a parallelogram, centered at the origin.\n2. `Area(K^\\circ) = 2 × 2 = 4`.\n3. Its interior is the open square `(-1, 1) × (-1, 1)`, which contains no integer points other than the origin `(0, 0)`. The origin is not a primitive integer point. So this condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, we find the body `K` which is the polar of this square `K^\\circ`.\n`K = (K^\\circ)^\\circ = { (x, y) | p*x + q*y ≤ 1 for all (p, q) ∈ [-1, 1] × [-1, 1] }`.\nThe maximum of `px + qy` over the square `[-1, 1] × [-1, 1]` is `|x| + |y|`.\nSo the condition `px + qy ≤ 1` for all `(p,q)` in the square is equivalent to `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\nThe resulting domain `K` is the diamond (a square rotated by 45°) defined by `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`. Its vertices are at `(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)`.\n\nLet's check this domain `K`:\n- It is a convex domain.\n- Its area is `(1/2) × 2 × 2 = 2`.\n- It satisfies the condition of intersecting all lines `px+qy=1`. Its support function is `h_K(p,q) = max(|p|,|q|)`. For any coprime integers `p, q`, they are not both zero, so `max(|p|,|q|) ≥ 1`. This ensures `h_K(p,q) ≥ 1`, which guarantees the intersection property for a centrally symmetric body.\n\nSince we found a lower bound of 2 for the area and constructed a valid domain with area 2, the minimal area is 2."
