    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Algebra and its Representations\n\nThe question asks about the representations of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let's set $q = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$. The order of $q^2$ is $l=3$. The algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is generated by $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ with the relations:\n$KEK^{-1} = q^2 E$, $KFK^{-1} = q^{-2} F$, $[E, F] = \\frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}$, and additionally $E^3 = 0, F^3 = 0, K^3 = 1$.\nThis is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra of dimension $l^3 = 3^3 = 27$.\n\nThe category $C$ consists of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of this algebra. We are asked to find the percentage of these objects that are irreducible.\n\n### Step 2: Classifying Indecomposable and Irreducible Representations\n\nThe representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at a root of unity is well-known. For $l=3$, the algebra is of tame representation type, meaning its indecomposable representations can be classified.\n\nThe isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules are:\n1.  **Simple (Irreducible) Modules:** There are $l=3$ simple modules, denoted $L_1, L_2, L_3$.\n    *   $L_1$ is the 1-dimensional trivial module.\n    *   $L_2$ is a 2-dimensional simple module.\n    *   $L_3$ is the 3-dimensional Steinberg module.\n    These are the only irreducible representations. So, there are exactly 3 irreducible objects in the category $C$.\n\n2.  **Projective Indecomposable Modules (PIMs):** These are the projective covers of the simple modules, denoted $P_1, P_2, P_3$.\n    *   A simple module $L_c$ is projective if and only if $c=l$. For us, this means only $L_3$ is projective.\n    *   Since $L_3$ is projective, its projective cover is itself: $P_3 = L_3$. This module is irreducible.\n    *   $L_1$ and $L_2$ are not projective. Their projective covers, $P_1$ and $P_2$, are therefore not simple (and thus reducible). Their dimension is $2l=6$.\n    So, besides $L_3$, we have two more PIMs, $P_1$ and $P_2$, which are indecomposable but reducible.\n\n3.  **Periodic (Tube) Modules:** All other indecomposable modules lie in families called tubes. For $l=3$, there is one tube of rank $l-1=2$. This tube contains two infinite families of indecomposable modules, $\\{M(k,1)\\}_{k\\ge1}$ and $\\{M(k,2)\\}_{k\\ge1}$.\n    *   $M(1,1)$ is the simple module $L_1$.\n    *   $M(1,2)$ is the simple module $L_2$.\n    *   For any $k \\ge 2$, the modules $M(k,1)$ and $M(k,2)$ are indecomposable but reducible. Their dimensions grow with $k$. For instance, $\\dim M(2,1)=3$, $\\dim M(2,2)=3$, $\\dim M(3,1)=4$, etc.\n\nIn summary, the set of objects in $C$ (isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules) consists of:\n*   **Irreducible:** $L_1, L_2, L_3$ (3 modules).\n*   **Reducible:** $P_1, P_2$, and the infinite set of modules $\\{M(k,1), M(k,2)\\}_{k \\ge 2}$.\n\n### Step 3: Interpreting the \"Percentage\"\n\nThe total number of objects in $C$ is infinite, while the number of irreducible objects is finite (3). A naive calculation of the percentage would be $\\frac{3}{\\infty} = 0$. This is a valid answer under a specific interpretation (e.g., taking a limit over dimension), but it is often not the intended answer for such questions in algebra.\n\nA more structural interpretation of the question is to consider the structure of the algebra itself. A finite-dimensional algebra $A$ can be considered as a module over itself (the so-called regular representation). By the Krull-Schmidt theorem, $A$ decomposes into a direct sum of indecomposable modules. This decomposition is unique up to isomorphism and permutation of summands. The summands are precisely the projective indecomposable modules (PIMs). We can then find the percentage of these specific indecomposable summands that are irreducible. This provides a meaningful, finite, and intrinsic ratio for the algebra.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Regular Representation\n\nFor a finite-dimensional algebra $A$, the left regular representation decomposes as:\n$A \\cong \\bigoplus_{i=1}^{k} (\\dim L_i) P_i$\nwhere $L_i$ are the non-isomorphic simple modules and $P_i$ are their corresponding projective covers.\n\nFor our algebra $A = u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ with $l=3$:\n*   Simple modules: $L_1, L_2, L_3$.\n*   Dimensions: $\\dim(L_1)=1$, $\\dim(L_2)=2$, $\\dim(L_3)=3$.\n*   Projective covers: $P_1, P_2, P_3$.\n\nThe decomposition of $A$ is:\n$A \\cong (\\dim L_1) P_1 \\oplus (\\dim L_2) P_2 \\oplus (\\dim L_3) P_3$\n$A \\cong 1 \\cdot P_1 \\oplus 2 \\cdot P_2 \\oplus 3 \\cdot P_3$\n$A \\cong P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3 \\oplus P_3 \\oplus P_3$\n\nThis decomposition has a total of $1+2+3=6$ indecomposable summands.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Percentage\n\nNow we need to identify which of these 6 summands are irreducible. An indecomposable module is irreducible if and only if it is simple.\n*   $P_1$ is the projective cover of $L_1$. Since $L_1$ is not projective, $P_1 \\neq L_1$, so $P_1$ is reducible.\n*   $P_2$ is the projective cover of $L_2$. Since $L_2$ is not projective, $P_2 \\neq L_2$, so $P_2$ is reducible.\n*   $P_3$ is the projective cover of $L_3$. Since $L_3$ (the Steinberg module) is projective, its projective cover is itself, so $P_3 = L_3$. As $L_3$ is simple, $P_3$ is irreducible.\n\nSo, in the decomposition of the regular representation:\n*   The one summand of type $P_1$ is reducible.\n*   The two summands of type $P_2$ are reducible.\n*   The three summands of type $P_3$ are irreducible.\n\nTotal number of indecomposable summands = 6.\nNumber of irreducible summands = 3.\n\nThe percentage of irreducible objects among these canonical indecomposables is:\nPercentage = $\\frac{\\text{Number of irreducible summands}}{\\text{Total number of indecomposable summands}} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} = 50\\%$.\n\nThis interpretation provides a non-trivial answer that reflects the internal structure of the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$."
