    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Reaction and Synthesis Methods**\n\nThe primary goal is to produce Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄). The most common and practical method for this is the direct combination of its constituent elements, xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂), via a thermal reaction.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\nXe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\nWhile other methods like photochemical synthesis (using UV light) or electric discharge exist, they often produce a mixture of xenon fluorides (XeF₂, XeF₄, XeF₆) and are generally considered less \"efficient\" for preparing a pure sample of XeF₄ in high yield compared to the direct thermal method. The temperature options provided in the question strongly suggest we should focus on the thermal synthesis route.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Role of Temperature in the Synthesis**\n\nTemperature is a critical factor in the synthesis of xenon fluorides. It influences both the rate of reaction (kinetics) and which product is favored (thermodynamics).\n\n*   **Kinetics:** For a reaction to occur, molecules must collide with sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. Lowering the temperature reduces the kinetic energy of the molecules, leading to fewer effective collisions and a drastically slower reaction rate.\n*   **Thermodynamics/Product Selectivity:** In the xenon-fluorine system, different products are favored at different temperatures and reactant ratios.\n    *   To produce XeF₂, an excess of Xenon is typically used.\n    *   To produce XeF₆, a large excess of Fluorine and higher temperatures (or pressures) are required.\n    *   The synthesis of XeF₄ requires a careful balance of conditions to maximize its yield.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Temperature Option**\n\nLet's analyze the given temperatures in the context of producing XeF₄ efficiently.\n\n*   **F. -78 °C, E. 0 °C, and D. 78 °C:** At these low temperatures, the thermal energy of the Xe and F₂ molecules is far too low to overcome the reaction's activation energy. The reaction rate is practically zero. Therefore, efficient production is not possible at these temperatures via the thermal method.\n\n*   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is too high. At 600 °C, the reaction conditions favor the formation of the higher fluoride, Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆), over Xenon tetrafluoride. Thus, this temperature is not efficient for producing XeF₄ specifically.\n\n*   **C. 200 °C:** While the reaction is thermodynamically possible at 200 °C, it is kinetically very slow. The rate of reaction is highly sensitive to temperature. A drop from the optimal temperature to 200 °C would mean the reaction would take an impractically long time (many days or even weeks) to achieve a good yield. This cannot be considered an \"efficient\" process.\n\n*   **B. 400 °C:** This is the widely established, standard temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride. By heating a mixture of Xenon and Fluorine (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio) in a nickel vessel at 400 °C, XeF₄ can be produced in high yield (often nearly 100%) in a matter of hours. This is the textbook definition of an efficient synthesis for this compound.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the \"Coldest Efficient\" Temperature**\n\nThe question asks for the *coldest* temperature at which production is *still efficient*.\n- Temperatures below 400 °C (like 200 °C) are kinetically too slow to be considered efficient.\n- The temperature of 400 °C is known to be highly efficient.\n- The temperature of 600 °C is inefficient because it produces the wrong product (XeF₆).\n\nTherefore, among the choices provided, 400 °C is the only temperature that allows for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄. It is the coldest option on the list that meets the \"efficient\" criterion.\n\n<<<B>>>"
