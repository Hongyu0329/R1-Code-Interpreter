    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n**Step 2: Decomposition of a Primitive Character**\n\nA fundamental property of Dirichlet characters is that a character $\\chi$ with a composite conductor $N = q_1 q_2 \\dots q_r$ (where the $q_i$ are pairwise coprime prime powers) is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ with conductor $q_i$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_r$.\n\nIn our case, a primitive character $\\chi$ of conductor $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$ must be a product:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$,\nwhere each $\\chi_{q}$ is a primitive character of conductor $q$.\n\n**Step 3: Condition on the Order of the Character**\n\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be $6$. This imposes two conditions on the orders of the component characters, let's call them $d_q = \\text{ord}(\\chi_q)$:\n1.  Each order $d_q$ must be a divisor of 6. Thus, $d_q \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n2.  The set of orders $\\{d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13}\\}$ must contain at least one order divisible by 2 and at least one order divisible by 3.\n\n**Step 4: Counting Primitive Characters for Each Component Conductor**\n\nWe need to determine the number of available primitive characters for each conductor $q$ from the factorization of $N$, whose order $d_q$ divides 6. Let $n(q, d)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $q$ and order $d$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=4=2^2$**:\n    The group of characters mod 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one character of order 1 (principal, conductor 1) and one of order 2. A character mod 4 is primitive if its conductor is 4. Thus, the character of order 2 is primitive.\n    - $n(4, 2) = 1$. No primitive characters of order 1, 3, or 6 exist.\n    - So, we must have $\\text{ord}(\\chi_4) = 2$. There is **1** choice for $\\chi_4$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=9=3^2$**:\n    The character group mod 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The possible orders are 1, 2, 3, 6. The non-primitive characters are induced from mod 3. Since $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$, there is one non-primitive character of order 1 and one of order 2. The remaining characters are primitive.\n    - Orders dividing 6:\n        - $n(9, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n        - $n(9, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    - The total number of choices for $\\chi_9$ is $2+2 = \\mathbf{4}$. The order $\\text{ord}(\\chi_9)$ must be in $\\{3, 6\\}$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=7$**:\n    The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. We count the primitive characters with orders dividing 6.\n    - $n(7, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - $n(7, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - $n(7, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    - The total number of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $1+2+2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=11$**:\n    The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The possible orders must divide 10. We need orders that also divide 6. The common divisors are 1 and 2. The order 1 character is not primitive.\n    - $n(11, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - The only choice for $\\chi_{11}$ is the character of order 2. There is **1** choice.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=13$**:\n    The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. Possible orders divide 12. We need orders dividing 6.\n    - $n(13, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - $n(13, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - $n(13, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    - The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1+2+2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Calculate the Final Number**\n\nNow we combine the results. We need to choose a tuple of characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6. Let the orders be $(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13})$.\nFrom Step 4, the possible orders are:\n*   $d_4 = 2$\n*   $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_{11} = 2$\n*   $d_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nLet's check the lcm condition. For any possible combination of orders:\n1.  All possible orders are divisors of 6, so their lcm will also divide 6.\n2.  Since $d_4=2$ (and $d_{11}=2$), the lcm is always divisible by 2.\n3.  Since $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$, the order of $\\chi_9$ is always divisible by 3. Thus, the lcm is always divisible by 3.\n\nA number that is divisible by both 2 and 3 must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\nSince the lcm must divide 6 and must be divisible by 6, the lcm is always exactly 6 for any valid combination of component characters.\n\nTherefore, the total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of available choices for each component character.\n\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_9$: 4\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_7$: 5\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1\nNumber of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: 5\n\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Primitivity:** A character is primitive if its conductor cannot be reduced. For a composite conductor $N = \\prod p_i^{k_i}$, this means the character must be a product of primitive characters for each $p_i^{k_i}$.\n*   **Order of Product:** The order is the lcm of component orders, not the product.\n*   **Counting Primitive Characters:** The number of primitive characters of conductor $p^k$ is $\\phi(p^k) - \\phi(p^{k-1})$ for $k \\ge 2$, and $\\phi(p)-1$ for $k=1$. One must then filter this set by the desired order.\n*   **LCM Condition:** It's crucial to verify that the lcm of the orders of the components is exactly 6. In this specific problem, the constraints on the possible orders for the components $\\chi_4$ and $\\chi_9$ automatically satisfy this condition.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the product of the number of choices for each primitive component character.\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
