    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Key Landmark:** Pantheon.\n    *   **Subject:** A unique architectural feature of the *square*.\n    *   **Action:** Removed by the city administration.\n    *   **Date:** Until 1950.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:**\n    *   The most prominent features of the square today are the Pantheon itself and the Fontana del Pantheon (the fountain with the obelisk) in the center. The fountain was not removed; it is still there.\n    *   A famous feature *associated* with the Pantheon building were the two bell towers added by Bernini in the 17th century, often nicknamed \"the donkey's ears.\" However, these were on the Pantheon's facade, not a feature of the square itself, and more importantly, they were removed in 1883, not 1950. This is a common point of confusion but does not match the date in the question.\n\n3.  **Focused Research on the Piazza in 1950:**\n    *   The question's specific date of 1950 is the most important clue. This year was a \"Giubileo\" (Holy Jubilee Year) in Rome, a time when the city often undertook major public works and \"clean-up\" projects to improve its appearance for pilgrims.\n    *   Historical photographs and records of the Piazza della Rotonda from before 1950 show a very different scene around the central fountain.\n    *   The fountain was encircled by a ring of permanent or semi-permanent structures.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Feature:**\n    *   These structures were a collection of kiosks or stalls, primarily occupied by booksellers (\"chioschi dei librai\").\n    *   This ring of stalls was a long-standing and characteristic feature of the piazza, creating a lively, market-like atmosphere that was both loved by some for its charm and criticized by others for cluttering the view of the Pantheon.\n    *   While perhaps not \"architecture\" in the sense of a grand building, this organized ring of purpose-built stalls was a distinct and defining structural/architectural feature of the square's layout and public space.\n\n5.  **Confirmation:**\n    *   In the lead-up to the 1950 Jubilee, the city administration of Rome ordered the removal of these kiosks.\n    *   The official reason was to restore \"decorum\" to the monumental square and provide an unobstructed view of the Pantheon, a common urban planning goal of that era.\n    *   This action perfectly matches all the details of the question: a unique feature of the square (not the Pantheon building), removed by the city administration, in the year 1950.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **The distinction between the Piazza and the Pantheon:** The question is about the square, not the church.\n*   **The importance of the date:** 1950 is the key to differentiating this feature from other historical changes, like the removal of Bernini's bell towers.\n*   **The definition of \"architectural feature\":** In the context of urban design, a planned and permanent set of structures like the ring of kiosks qualifies as an architectural feature that defines a space.\n\n<<<The ring of booksellers' kiosks (stalls) that encircled the central fountain.>>>"
