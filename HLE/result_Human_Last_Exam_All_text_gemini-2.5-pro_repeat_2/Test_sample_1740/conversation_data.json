    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of members of the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs (miRNAs) that have been identified in humans. The key is to understand what constitutes a \"member\" of this family.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"let-7 Family\" and \"Member\"**\nThe let-7 family is a group of miRNAs that share a highly conserved \"seed sequence\" (a specific short sequence of nucleotides near the 5' end). This shared seed sequence means they regulate a similar set of target genes.\n\nThe term \"member\" can be interpreted in two primary ways, which leads to different numbers:\n1.  **Unique Mature miRNA Sequences:** This refers to the distinct final, functional miRNA molecules. For example, `let-7a`, `let-7b`, etc. are considered different members.\n2.  **Gene Loci:** This refers to the distinct locations in the human genome from which these miRNAs are transcribed. Some mature miRNAs (like `let-7a`) are encoded by more than one gene.\n\nIn scientific literature and databases, the count of \"members\" most often refers to the number of distinct gene loci, as this represents the full genetic basis of the family.\n\n**Step 3: List the Canonical let-7 Members**\nThe let-7 family in humans is composed of a set of miRNAs with the \"let-7\" designation, plus one other miRNA, `miR-98`, which shares the same seed sequence and is functionally considered part of the family. The main types are:\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   miR-98\n\nThis gives us 9 distinct types of mature let-7 family miRNAs. Note that there is no `let-7h` in humans.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Corresponding Gene Loci**\nNow, we must count how many distinct genes in the human genome encode these 9 types of miRNAs. We refer to the authoritative miRNA database, miRBase, for this information.\n\n*   **let-7a:** is encoded by three separate genes (`let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, `let-7a-3`).\n*   **let-7f:** is encoded by two separate genes (`let-7f-1`, `let-7f-2`).\n*   **let-7b:** is encoded by one gene.\n*   **let-7c:** is encoded by one gene.\n*   **let-7d:** is encoded by one gene.\n*   **let-7e:** is encoded by one gene.\n*   **let-7g:** is encoded by one gene.\n*   **let-7i:** is encoded by one gene.\n*   **miR-98:** is encoded by one gene.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Members (Genes)**\nBy summing the number of genes for each type, we get the total number of members.\n\nTotal members = (Genes for let-7a) + (Genes for let-7f) + (Genes for the other 7 types)\nTotal members = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\nTotal members = **12**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ambiguity of \"Member\":** The primary point of confusion is whether \"member\" means the unique miRNA type (9) or the unique gene that codes for it (12). The convention in the field generally leans towards counting the genes.\n2.  **Inclusion of miR-98:** It is crucial to remember that `miR-98` is functionally and structurally part of the let-7 family, even though it doesn't have \"let-7\" in its name.\n3.  **Exclusion of let-7h:** While other species may have `let-7h`, it has not been identified in humans.\n4.  **Database Updates:** The number is based on current annotations in primary databases like miRBase. While stable for a well-studied family like let-7, these numbers can theoretically change with new genomic discoveries. As of today, 12 is the widely accepted number of gene loci.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the analysis of counting the distinct gene loci that encode the canonical let-7 family miRNAs (including miR-98) in the human genome, the final number is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
