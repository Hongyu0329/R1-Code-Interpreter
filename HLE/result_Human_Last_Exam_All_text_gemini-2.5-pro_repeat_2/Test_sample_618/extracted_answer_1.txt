There are two forms for the general representation transformation on x, depending on the parameter $c_2$ associated with time translation. Let $\epsilon$ be the group parameter.

Case 1: For transformations involving a non-zero time translation component ($c_2 \neq 0$):
$\bar{x}(\epsilon) = x + c_3 \epsilon + \frac{c_4 e^{k_1 t}}{k_1 c_2} (e^{k_1 c_2 \epsilon} - 1)$

Case 2: For transformations with no time translation component ($c_2 = 0$):
$\bar{x}(\epsilon) = x + (c_3 + c_4 e^{k_1 t})\epsilon$

Here, $c_3$ and $c_4$ are arbitrary constants corresponding to space translation and a generalized Galilean-type transformation, respectively.
