    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a *single genus* of mushroom that is known for producing a *distinctly blue spore print*.\n\n2.  **Understand Spore Prints:** A spore print is a crucial identification characteristic in mycology. It's the colored powder left behind when a mushroom cap is placed on a surface, allowing its microscopic spores to fall. The color of this deposit is determined by the color of the spores in mass.\n\n3.  **Consider Common Spore Print Colors:** Most mushroom spore prints are in a limited range of colors: white, cream, yellow, pink, salmon, various shades of brown (ochre, cinnamon, rusty, dark brown), purple-brown, and black.\n\n4.  **Identify Rare Spore Print Colors:** Green and blue are exceptionally rare. The rarity makes the genus in question unique and notable.\n\n5.  **Eliminate Common Misconceptions (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Bluing Reaction vs. Blue Spores:** Many mushrooms have flesh that bruises or stains blue when cut or handled (e.g., many species in the genus *Boletus*, and *Gyroporus cyanescens*). This is a chemical reaction and has no relation to the spore color. These mushrooms have yellow or brown spore prints.\n    *   **Blue Mushroom Color vs. Blue Spores:** Some mushrooms have a distinctly blue color on their cap or stem. The most famous examples are *Lactarius indigo* and *Entoloma hochstetteri*. However, the color of the mushroom's body (fruiting body) is not the same as its spore color.\n        *   ***Lactarius indigo*** is a striking blue mushroom with blue latex (\"milk\"), but its spore print is **creamy white to yellowish**.\n        *   ***Entoloma hochstetteri***, the New Zealand blue mushroom, is brilliantly blue, but its spore print is **pinkish-brown**, typical of the *Entoloma* genus.\n    *   **Blue-Green Tints vs. Distinctly Blue:** Some mushrooms in genera like *Stropharia* or *Leratiomyces* can have blue or green caps (*Stropharia aeruginosa*), but their spore prints are purple-brown to blackish, sometimes with faint olive or lilac tints, but not distinctly blue.\n\n6.  **Identify the Correct Genus:** After eliminating the common incorrect candidates, research points to one specific genus that is cited in mycological literature for this rare trait. The genus is **Porpoloma**. Certain species within this genus, such as *Porpoloma subclavipes*, are described as producing a spore print that is a pale sky-blue or bluish-green. While not all species in the genus have this feature, *Porpoloma* is the only genus known to contain species that produce a genuinely blue spore print, making it the correct answer.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   The question asks for the one genus known to have blue spores.\n*   Common blue-colored or blue-staining mushrooms (*Lactarius*, *Entoloma*, *Boletus*) do not have blue spores. This is a critical point of distinction.\n*   Specialized mycological sources confirm that the genus *Porpoloma* is unique for containing species that can produce a pale blue spore print.\n\nTherefore, the name of the genus is *Porpoloma*.\n\n<<<Porpoloma>>>"
