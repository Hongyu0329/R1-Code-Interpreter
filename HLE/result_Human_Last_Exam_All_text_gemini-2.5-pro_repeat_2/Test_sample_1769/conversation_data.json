    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the current word and its origin:** The Modern English word is \"sister\". Its direct ancestor is the Old English word *sweostor*. However, its current form shows significant influence from the Old Norse word *systir*.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Norse influence:** The Vikings (Norse) began raiding and later settling in parts of England (the Danelaw) from the late 8th century onwards. This led to a period of intense contact between Old English and Old Norse speakers.\n    *   The Old English word was *sweostor*.\n    *   The Old Norse word was *systir*.\n    *   These two words are cognates, meaning they come from the same Proto-Germanic root (*swestēr*). Because they were so similar in sound and meaning, they began to influence each other.\n    *   The Modern English \"sister\" has lost the \"w\" from the Old English *sweostor* and has adopted the \"i\" vowel sound (spelled with 'i') from the Old Norse *systir*. The original *eo* in *sw**eo**stor* would not have naturally evolved into the \"i\" sound of \"sister\".\n\n3.  **Remove the Norse influence and project the word's natural evolution:** To find out what the word would be without this interaction, we must trace the likely linguistic development of the purely Old English form, *sweostor*.\n\n4.  **Trace the evolution from Old English to Middle English:**\n    *   **Initial `sw-`:** The initial `sw-` consonant cluster was stable in English. Words like Old English *swīn*, *swēte*, and *swimman* became Modern English \"swine\", \"sweet\", and \"swim\". Therefore, the `sw-` at the beginning of *sweostor* would have been retained.\n    *   **Vowel `eo`:** The Old English short diphthong `eo` typically smoothed into a short `e` sound in Middle English, especially before an `s` cluster. For example, Old English *heorte* became Middle English *herte* (Modern \"heart,\" with a later vowel shift).\n    *   **Ending `-stor`:** The ending would likely have remained, with the unstressed 'o' also likely reducing to an 'e' in spelling.\n    *   Combining these changes, the Old English *sweostor* would have naturally evolved into the Middle English form ***swester***.\n\n5.  **Trace the evolution from Middle English to Modern English:**\n    *   The Middle English form *swester* would have been very stable. The stress is on the first syllable (`SWES-ter`). The sounds are all common and don't undergo unusual shifts into the Modern English period.\n    *   There are no major sound changes, like the Great Vowel Shift, that would drastically alter the pronunciation or spelling of *swester* in the way it affected other words.\n    *   Therefore, the Middle English *swester* would have carried into Modern English as \"swester\".\n\n6.  **Provide supporting evidence from related languages:** We can look at other West Germanic languages that were not subject to the same Old Norse influence.\n    *   **German:** *Schwester*\n    *   **Dutch:** *zuster* (lost the 'w')\n    *   **West Frisian:** *suster* (lost the 'w')\n    The German *Schwester* is remarkably similar to our projected form \"swester\", which strengthens the conclusion that this is the most likely outcome.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Core Vocabulary:** \"Sister\" is a core vocabulary word for a close family member. Such words are highly resistant to being completely replaced by a foreign word. The influence here was a modification of the native word by a very similar-sounding cognate, not a replacement.\n*   **Sound Laws:** The projection relies on applying known, regular sound changes that occurred between Old, Middle, and Modern English. While exceptions always exist, this provides the most probable and scientifically grounded path of evolution.\n*   **The Counterfactual:** The entire question is a \"what if\" scenario. While we can make a highly educated guess based on linguistic principles, it remains a projection, not an absolute certainty. However, \"swester\" is the most academically accepted hypothesis.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Original Old English word: *sweostor*.\n2.  Norse influence from *systir* changed it to \"sister\".\n3.  Without Norse influence, *sweostor* would have followed regular sound changes.\n4.  OE *sweostor* -> ME *swester* (smoothing of 'eo' to 'e').\n5.  ME *swester* -> ModE \"swester\" (stable form).\nTherefore, the Modern English word would most likely be \"swester\".\n\n<<<swester>>>"
