    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the sentence and the target word.**\nThe sentence provided is: \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\nThe question asks for the part of speech of the first word, which is \"Fat\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the grammatical structure around the target word.**\nThe word \"Fat\" is immediately followed by the word \"people\". \"People\" is a noun (referring to human beings). In English grammar, a word that describes or modifies a noun is typically an adjective.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the function of \"Fat\" in the phrase \"Fat people\".**\nIn the phrase \"Fat people\", the word \"Fat\" is describing a quality or characteristic of the \"people\". It answers the question \"What kind of people?\". This descriptive role is the primary function of an adjective.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Context is key:** The word \"fat\" can be a noun in other sentences (e.g., \"He trimmed the fat from the meat.\"). However, in this specific sentence, its position before the noun \"people\" and its descriptive function make it an adjective.\n*   **Ignore the rest of the sentence:** The second half of the sentence, \"eat accumulates,\" is grammatically incorrect. This might be intended to be confusing. However, the grammatical relationship in the noun phrase \"Fat people\" is clear and independent of the rest of the sentence's errors. We only need to analyze the part of speech of \"Fat\" as it is used here.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n*   A. Verb: A verb expresses an action or state of being. \"Fat\" is not an action here.\n*   B. Noun: A noun is a person, place, thing, or idea. While \"fat\" can be a noun, here it is describing another noun (\"people\"), not acting as one itself.\n*   C. Adjective: An adjective modifies a noun. \"Fat\" is modifying \"people\". This is the correct choice.\n*   D. Adverb: An adverb modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb. \"Fat\" is not modifying a verb.\n*   E. Conjunction: A conjunction connects words, phrases, or clauses. \"Fat\" is not a conjunction.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nBased on the analysis, the word \"Fat\" functions as an adjective in this sentence because it describes the noun \"people\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
