**1) Hotspots for interaction with alpha-1 subunit:**

The primary interaction site on the beta-1 subunit is the Beta Interaction Domain (BID), a conserved hydrophobic groove. Based on the human beta-1b isoform (UniProt: P54289), the key hotspot residues forming this groove are:

*   **Tyrosine 215 (Y215)**
*   **Leucine 217 (L217)**
*   **Isoleucine 220 (I220)**
*   **Leucine 221 (L221)**
*   **Methionine 246 (M246)**
*   **Valine 250 (V250)**
*   **Tryptophan 253 (W253)** (A critical anchor residue at the base of the groove)
*   **Isoleucine 257 (I257)**
*   **Tyrosine 299 (Y299)**
*   **Valine 302 (V302)**
*   **Isoleucine 303 (I303)**

These residues collectively create the binding pocket for the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit.

**2) Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of alpha-1 subunit:**

The modulation of gating is complex and involves distinct regions of the beta-1 subunit for different effects.

*   **For core modulatory functions (increased membrane expression/trafficking and hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependence of activation):** The hotspot residues are the same as those listed in part 1. The integrity and binding affinity of the **BID groove** is the primary determinant of these effects.

*   **For fine-tuning of inactivation kinetics:** The hotspot is located in the variable **N-terminus** of the beta-1b isoform.
    *   **The entire N-terminal domain (approximately residues 1-30)** functions as a key modulator.
    *   A specific critical motif within this region is the sequence from **Lysine 21 to Serine 26 (K21-I-K-S-S-S26)**. These residues are crucial for imparting the characteristic effects of the beta-1b isoform on the speed of channel inactivation.
