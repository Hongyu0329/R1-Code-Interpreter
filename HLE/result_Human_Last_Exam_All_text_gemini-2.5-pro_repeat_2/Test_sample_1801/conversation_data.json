    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** The question asks for the names of two specific individuals.\n    *   **What:** These individuals must be Nobel laureates.\n    *   **Where:** They were featured in a commercial.\n    *   **Which Company:** The commercial was for Enron.\n    *   **When:** The commercial aired in or around the year 2000.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major branding effort by Enron in 2000 and 2001, just before its collapse. The goal was to portray Enron not as a simple energy company, but as a revolutionary, forward-thinking firm that challenged the status quo. The campaign became \"infamous\" due to the extreme irony of a company built on deceit and fraud promoting a message of questioning and transparency.\n\n3.  **Identify the Participants:** Enron hired several prominent thinkers and business leaders to lend credibility to this campaign. The task is to identify which of these participants are also Nobel laureates.\n\n4.  **Careful Point 1: The First Laureate.**\n    *   One of the most well-known participants was economist **Myron Scholes**.\n    *   Was he a Nobel laureate at the time? Yes. Scholes, along with Robert C. Merton, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1997** for developing a new method to determine the value of derivatives (the Black-Scholes model).\n    *   Therefore, he was a Nobel laureate when he appeared in the 2000 commercial.\n\n5.  **Careful Point 2: The Second Laureate.**\n    *   Another prominent economist featured in the campaign was **Paul Krugman**.\n    *   Was he a Nobel laureate at the time? No. When the commercial aired in 2000, Krugman was a well-respected professor at MIT, but he had not yet won the Nobel Prize.\n    *   He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008** for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity.\n    *   The question asks \"Which two Nobel laureates were featured,\" which refers to their current status. Even though he wasn't a laureate in 2000, he is one now, making him the correct second person. Both individuals have since expressed regret over their participation.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the two individuals who are Nobel laureates and were featured in Enron's \"Ask Why\" commercials are Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman.\n\n***\n\nThe two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline \"Ask Why\" were **Myron Scholes** and **Paul Krugman**.\n\n<<<Myron Scholes and Paul Krugman>>>"
