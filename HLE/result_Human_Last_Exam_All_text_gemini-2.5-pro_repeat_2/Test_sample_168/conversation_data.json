    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the sound source.**\nThe question is about hearing human muscle twitches. The sound produced by contracting muscles is a real phenomenon, known as mechanomyography (MMG). These sounds are characterized by being very low in frequency. The typical frequency of these muscle sounds is around 25 Hz or lower, placing them at the very bottom edge of or below the range of human hearing (which starts at about 20 Hz). This low-frequency sound is often referred to as infrasound.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the hearing range of each animal listed.**\nWe need to determine which of the given animals has a hearing range that includes these very low frequencies (below 25 Hz).\n\n*   **A. Dog:** A dog's hearing range is roughly 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. While they are famous for hearing high-pitched sounds that are inaudible to humans (ultrasound), their low-frequency hearing is not better than ours and does not extend into the infrasound range. Therefore, a dog is unlikely to hear muscle twitches.\n\n*   **B. Bat:** Bats are specialists in echolocation, which involves producing and hearing very high-frequency sounds (ultrasound), often above 20,000 Hz and extending to 100,000 Hz or more. They are not adapted for hearing low-frequency infrasound.\n\n*   **C. Herring:** Some fish, including herring, possess a unique and highly sensitive hearing ability. They have a gas-filled swim bladder that is physically connected to their inner ear. This structure acts like a drum, amplifying sound pressure and allowing them to detect a very broad range of frequencies, including extremely low ones (infrasound). This adaptation is believed to help them detect the low-frequency vibrations produced by the muscle movements of approaching predators. This makes them a strong candidate.\n\n*   **D. Whale:** Whales can be broadly divided into two groups. Toothed whales (like dolphins and orcas) use high-frequency echolocation. Baleen whales (like blue and fin whales), however, are famous for communicating using very low-frequency infrasound, with calls as low as 10-20 Hz that can travel for hundreds of miles through the ocean. Thus, a baleen whale could also potentially hear sounds in this range.\n\n*   **E. Human:** The typical human hearing range is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. The sounds from muscle twitches are generally too low in frequency and too faint (low amplitude) for a human to consciously hear.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the candidates and select the best answer.**\nBoth baleen whales and herring are capable of hearing the low-frequency sounds produced by muscle contractions. However, the herring is a classic biological example of an animal that has specifically adapted to hear the muscle sounds of other animals for survival (detecting predators). Given the choices, herring is a very well-documented and fitting answer to the question.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of hearing ranges, the herring is known to have a specialized auditory system that allows it to detect the very low-frequency sounds, like those produced by muscle contractions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
