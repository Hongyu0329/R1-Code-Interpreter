    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the initial setup and coordinate system.**\nLet's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. For simplicity, we can define its vertices by the region where its coordinates (x, y, z) satisfy:\n*   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThis is a cube with side length 1, positioned in the first octant with one corner at the origin (0,0,0). The volume of Cube A is 1³ = 1.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the translation (the \"shift\").**\nThe problem states that the second cube, Cube B, is shifted relative to the first one \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n*   **Main Diagonal:** A main diagonal of a cube connects two opposite vertices. For Cube A in our chosen coordinate system, the main diagonal starting from the origin (0,0,0) connects to the vertex (1,1,1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **The Shift:** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most commonly interpreted in geometry problems like this to mean that the displacement vector is 1/2 of the diagonal vector.\n    *   Displacement vector, **v** = (1/2) * **d** = (1/2) * (1, 1, 1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n**Careful Point:** An alternative interpretation could be a shift by a *distance* of 1/2 in the direction of the main diagonal. This would result in a much more complex calculation and an irrational answer. The phrasing and the typical nature of such problems strongly suggest the first interpretation, where the shift components are 1/2.\n\n**Step 3: Define the position of the second cube.**\nCube B is simply Cube A translated by the displacement vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This means that for any point (x, y, z) in Cube A, the corresponding point (x + 1/2, y + 1/2, z + 1/2) is in Cube B.\nTherefore, the region for Cube B is defined by the inequalities:\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n**Step 4: Determine the shape and dimensions of the intersection.**\nThe intersection is the volume of space that belongs to both Cube A and Cube B. A point (x, y, z) is in the intersection if it satisfies the inequalities for both cubes simultaneously.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The point must satisfy (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) AND (1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2). The common range is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] which is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The point must satisfy (0 ≤ y ≤ 1) AND (1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2). The common range is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] which is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The point must satisfy (0 ≤ z ≤ 1) AND (1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2). The common range is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] which is [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe resulting intersection is a smaller cube with a side length of 1/2.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\nThe volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s³, where 's' is the side length.\nFor the intersection cube, the side length is 1/2.\nVolume of intersection = (1/2)³ = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Coordinate System:** Choosing an axis-aligned cube starting at the origin (0,0,0) simplifies the problem greatly.\n*   **Interpreting the Shift:** The crucial step is interpreting \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" as a displacement vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This is the standard interpretation that leads to a clean, rational answer.\n*   **Intersection Logic:** The intersection of two axis-aligned boxes is found by taking the intersection of their coordinate ranges independently.\n*   **Final Calculation:** The volume calculation is straightforward once the dimensions of the intersection shape are known.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is itself a cube with a side length of 1/2. The volume is calculated as (1/2)³.\n\nVolume = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
