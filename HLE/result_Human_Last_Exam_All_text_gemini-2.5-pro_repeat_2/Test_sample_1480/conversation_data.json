    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to calculate the \"rule activation level\" for a fuzzy rule. The rule activation level, also known as the firing strength, determines the degree to which a rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part) is satisfied by the current inputs.\n\n2.  **Understand the Core Operation:** The problem specifies using a \"t-norm operation\". In fuzzy logic, a t-norm is a function used to model the logical AND operator. It combines the membership values of multiple antecedents to find the overall firing strength of the rule.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Values:**\n    *   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`: This represents the membership value (or degree of satisfaction) of the input `x'` in the first antecedent fuzzy set of the rule. Let's call this value `m1`. So, `m1 = 0.7`.\n    *   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: This represents the membership value for a second antecedent in the same rule. Let's call this value `m2`. So, `m2 = 0.9`.\n\n4.  **Choose the Specific T-norm:** The problem states to use \"a t-norm operation\" but does not specify which one. The most common and standard t-norm used for the fuzzy AND operation is the **minimum (min)** operator.\n    *   The formula for the minimum t-norm is: `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`.\n    *   Other t-norms exist (e.g., product, where T(a,b) = a*b), but the minimum operator is the most standard choice unless specified otherwise.\n\n5.  **Apply the T-norm to the Values:** We combine the two membership values using the minimum t-norm to find the rule activation level.\n    *   Activation Level = `T(m1, m2)`\n    *   Activation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   Activation Level = `0.7`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Interpreting the Notation:** The notation `μG_k_j(y_j)` is unconventional for an antecedent (the \"IF\" part of a rule), as `y` usually represents an output variable. For the problem to be solvable, we must assume that this term represents the membership value of a second antecedent, which is to be combined with the first one (`Phi_k(x′)`).\n*   **The Role of \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\":** This is a very advanced type of fuzzy set that handles high levels of uncertainty. However, the problem provides crisp numerical values (0.7 and 0.9) as inputs for the t-norm. This implies that the complexity of the Type-3 structure has been resolved in a prior step, and we are performing the final combination step. The fundamental principle of using a t-norm to calculate the activation level remains the same across different types of fuzzy systems.\n*   **Assumption of the T-norm:** The choice of the `min` operator is an assumption based on it being the most common practice for fuzzy AND operations. The result is dependent on this choice.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **Antecedent 1 membership value:** 0.7\n*   **Antecedent 2 membership value:** 0.9\n*   **T-norm operation (minimum):** `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   **Result:** 0.7\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
