    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and the properties of the tangent function**\n\nWe need to calculate `tan(x)` where `x = 10^100`. The argument of the tangent function is in radians. The number `x` is extremely large.\nThe key property of the tangent function is its periodicity. The period of `tan(x)` is `π`. This means that for any integer `k`:\n`tan(x) = tan(x - kπ)`\n\nTo calculate `tan(10^100)`, we can first reduce its argument `10^100` by an integer multiple of `π` to bring it into a small, manageable range. The value of the tangent will not change.\n\n**Step 2: Reduce the argument using modulo operation**\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding `tan(10^100 mod π)`.\nLet `x = 10^100`. The value we are interested in is `y = x - kπ`, where `k` is an integer chosen to make `y` small.\nA convenient representation for `x mod π` is `π` times the fractional part of `x/π`.\nLet `x/π = I + f`, where `I = floor(x/π)` is the integer part and `f = {x/π}` is the fractional part (`0 ≤ f < 1`).\nThen `x = Iπ + fπ`.\nSo, `tan(x) = tan(Iπ + fπ)`. Since `I` is an integer and `tan` has a period of `π`, `tan(Iπ + fπ) = tan(fπ)`.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to calculating `tan(fπ)`, where `f = {10^100 / π}`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the fractional part `{10^100 / π}`**\n\nTo find the fractional part of `10^100 / π`, we need to look at the decimal expansion of `1/π`.\nMultiplying `1/π` by `10^100` shifts the decimal point 100 places to the right. The fractional part of the resulting number is determined by the digits of `1/π` that come after the 100th decimal place.\n\nLet the decimal expansion of `1/π` be `0.d_1 d_2 d_3 ...`.\nThen `10^100 / π = d_1 d_2 ... d_100 . d_101 d_102 ...`\nThe integer part `I` is `d_1 d_2 ... d_100`.\nThe fractional part `f` is `0.d_101 d_102 ...`.\n\nWe need a high-precision value of `1/π`. Using a computational source, the digits of `1/π` are:\n`1/π = 0.3183098861 8379067153 7767526745 0287240689 1929148091 2897495035 8221833070 4114227922 8453586259 5245831668 9112290327...`\nThe first 100 digits after the decimal point end with `...5245831668`.\nThe digits starting from the 101st place are `9112290327...`.\n\nTherefore, the fractional part `f` is:\n`f = {10^100 / π} = 0.9112290327...`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final value**\n\nNow we need to compute `tan(fπ)`.\n`y = fπ ≈ 0.9112290327 * π`\n`y ≈ 0.9112290327 * 3.1415926535...`\n`y ≈ 2.86260191...` radians.\n\nWe need to calculate `tan(2.86260191...)`.\nLet's analyze the angle `y`.\n`π/2 ≈ 1.5708`\n`π ≈ 3.1416`\nSince `π/2 < 2.86260191 < π`, the angle is in the second quadrant. The tangent in the second quadrant is negative.\n\nTo calculate the value, we can use the relation `tan(π - x) = -tan(x)`.\nLet `y = π - δ`. Then `tan(y) = -tan(δ)`.\n`δ = π - y = π - fπ = π(1 - f)`\n`1 - f = 1 - 0.9112290327... = 0.0887709673...`\n`δ = π * (0.0887709673...) ≈ 3.14159265 * 0.0887709673 ≈ 0.27889074...` radians.\n\nSo, `tan(10^100) = tan(y) = -tan(δ) = -tan(0.27889074...)`.\nUsing a calculator for `tan(0.27889074...)`:\n`tan(0.27889074...) ≈ 0.28645821...`\nTherefore, `tan(10^100) ≈ -0.28645821...`\n\n**Step 5: Extract the required digits**\n\nThe question asks for the first 3 digits after the comma (decimal point) of `tan(10^100)`.\nThe calculated value is `-0.28645821...`.\nThe first digit after the comma is 2.\nThe second digit after the comma is 8.\nThe third digit after the comma is 6.\n\nThe first 3 digits are `286`."
