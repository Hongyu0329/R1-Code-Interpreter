    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Surface Code and Logical Qubits:**\n    *   The surface code is a type of topological quantum error-correcting code. Physical qubits are arranged on a 2D lattice.\n    *   Logical qubits are the robust, encoded units of quantum information that are protected from errors. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topology (shape) of the surface.\n\n2.  **Encoding Logical Qubits in a Single Patch:**\n    *   A simple, planar surface code patch without any holes (topologically a disk) has boundaries. It can encode a single logical qubit (`k=1`).\n    *   To encode more logical qubits on a single patch, we can alter its topology by creating \"holes\". A hole is a region within the code lattice where stabilizers are not measured, effectively creating an inner boundary.\n    *   **Key Principle:** For a single, connected patch of surface code on a plane, the number of logical qubits it can encode is equal to the number of holes it contains.\n    *   So, for a single patch with `H` holes, it can encode `k = H` logical qubits.\n\n3.  **Analyzing a Single Patch from the Question:**\n    *   The question specifies a \"patch of surface code with two holes\".\n    *   Applying the principle from Step 2, a single such patch has `H = 2` holes.\n    *   Therefore, one patch can encode a maximum of `k_patch = 2` logical qubits.\n\n4.  **Combining Multiple Patches:**\n    *   The problem states there are **two** such patches. These patches are physically distinct and separate systems.\n    *   When dealing with separate quantum systems, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits in each individual system.\n    *   Let `k_1` be the number of logical qubits in the first patch and `k_2` be the number of logical qubits in the second patch.\n    *   The total number of logical qubits is `k_total = k_1 + k_2`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Final Answer:**\n    *   From Step 3, we know that each patch has two holes and can encode 2 logical qubits.\n    *   Patch 1: `k_1 = 2` logical qubits.\n    *   Patch 2: `k_2 = 2` logical qubits.\n    *   Total logical qubits: `k_total = k_1 + k_2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrasing \"two patches of surface code with two holes\" is interpreted to mean two identical patches, each having two holes. This is the most standard interpretation. An alternative (and less likely) interpretation would be a total of two holes distributed among the two patches, which would result in a different answer (2 logical qubits). We proceed with the standard interpretation.\n*   **Maximality:** The question asks for the maximum number (\"at most\"). The formula `k=H` gives the maximum number of logical qubits for a given topology.\n*   **Independence of Patches:** The calculation assumes the two patches are not connected in any way that would change their combined topology. As separate patches, their logical qubit counts simply add up.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   Number of logical qubits per patch = Number of holes in that patch = 2.\n*   Number of patches = 2.\n*   Total number of logical qubits = (Number of logical qubits per patch) × (Number of patches).\n*   Total number of logical qubits = 2 × 2 = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
