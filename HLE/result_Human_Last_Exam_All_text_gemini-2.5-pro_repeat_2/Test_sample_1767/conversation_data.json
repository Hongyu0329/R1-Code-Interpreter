    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Chern Number**\nThe Chern number ($C$) is a topological invariant, an integer that characterizes the global properties of the electronic band structure in a two-dimensional gapped material. Its most direct physical consequence is the quantization of the Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_{xy}$) in the quantum Hall effect:\n$\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components of the System**\nThe system consists of two distinct parts:\n1.  **Chern Insulator 1:** Has a Chern number $C_1 = 1$.\n2.  **Chern Insulator 2:** Has a Chern number $C_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Connection**\nThe two insulators are connected \"laterally\" with a \"negligible tunneling barrier\".\n*   **Laterally:** This means they are placed side-by-side, effectively forming a parallel circuit for Hall currents.\n*   **Negligible tunneling barrier:** This is a crucial point. It means that electrons can move freely between the two regions. The two insulators are not isolated from each other; instead, they merge to form a single, larger system. The boundary between them is not an insulating barrier and does not host its own distinct edge states that would separate the two systems.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Additivity Property of the Chern Number**\nThe Chern number is an additive quantity. When two topological systems are combined into a single, larger system (as is the case here due to the negligible barrier), the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers of its constituent parts.\n\nThis can be understood by considering the total Hall conductivity. When the two materials are placed side-by-side, the total Hall current is the sum of the currents from each part, and the total Hall conductivity is the sum of the individual conductivities.\n*   Conductivity of system 1: $\\sigma_{xy, 1} = C_1 \\frac{e^2}{h} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n*   Conductivity of system 2: $\\sigma_{xy, 2} = C_2 \\frac{e^2}{h} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n\nThe total Hall conductivity of the junction is:\n$\\sigma_{xy, total} = \\sigma_{xy, 1} + \\sigma_{xy, 2} = (1+1) \\frac{e^2}{h} = 2 \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n\nSince the Chern number of the total system ($C_{total}$) is defined by $\\sigma_{xy, total} = C_{total} \\frac{e^2}{h}$, we can directly find its value.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Chern Number**\nFrom the analysis above:\n$C_{total} \\frac{e^2}{h} = 2 \\frac{e^2}{h}$\nTherefore,\n$C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Topological Invariance:** The Chern number is a robust property. Small perturbations or the specific details of the interface do not change its integer value as long as the bulk energy gap does not close.\n2.  **Nature of the Barrier:** The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is key. If there were a perfect insulating barrier, one could not speak of a single Chern number for the junction; it would remain two separate systems. If the region between them was a different topological phase (e.g., a trivial insulator with $C=0$), one would have to analyze the edge states at both interfaces.\n3.  **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** An alternative viewpoint is the bulk-boundary correspondence. The number of chiral edge states at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers $C_A$ and $C_B$ is given by $|C_A - C_B|$.\n    *   At the outer edge of the junction (interface with vacuum, $C=0$), the total number of edge states would be $|C_{total} - 0| = C_{total}$.\n    *   At the internal interface between the two $C=1$ insulators, the number of edge states is $|C_1 - C_2| = |1-1| = 0$. This confirms that the two insulators merge seamlessly into a single bulk material from a topological perspective. The combined system acts as a single entity with a new, total Chern number.\n4.  **Additivity:** The additivity of the Chern number is a fundamental principle for non-interacting or weakly coupled layers/regions. The lateral connection with negligible tunneling ensures this condition is met.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Initial systems: Two Chern insulators, each with $C=1$.\n2.  Connection: They are combined into a single system with no significant barrier between them.\n3.  Governing Principle: The Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n4.  Calculation: $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe Chern number of the junction is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
