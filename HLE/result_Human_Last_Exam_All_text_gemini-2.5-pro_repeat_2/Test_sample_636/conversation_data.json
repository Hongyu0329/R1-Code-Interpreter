    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain `F`.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are given a linear time-invariant (LTI) system defined by matrices `A` and `B`.\n`A = [-1, 1; 1, 0]`\n`B = [1, 2; 1, 0]`\nThe goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix, `A_cl = A + BF`, has its eigenvalues at desired locations, specifically at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`. This is a classic pole placement problem.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **System Type:** Since the input matrix `B` is a 2x2 matrix, this is a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) system. The feedback gain `F` will also be a 2x2 matrix. Let `F = [f11, f12; f21, f22]`.\n*   **Controllability:** Pole placement is only possible if the system is controllable. A system is controllable if its controllability matrix `C = [B, AB]` has full rank (rank = n, where n is the state dimension, which is 2 here).\n    *   Let's check the rank of `B`: `det(B) = (1)(0) - (2)(1) = -2`. Since `det(B)` is not zero, `B` is full rank (rank 2). This is sufficient to prove the system is controllable.\n*   **Non-uniqueness of the Solution:** For MIMO systems, the feedback gain `F` that achieves the desired pole placement is generally not unique. We will find one possible solution.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues (poles) of the closed-loop system are `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`. The desired characteristic polynomial `p(s)` is formed from these roots:\n`p(s) = (s - p1)(s - p2)`\n`p(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p(s) = (s + 1 - j)(s + 1 + j)`\nUsing the formula `(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2` with `a = s + 1` and `b = j`:\n`p(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`p(s) = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n`p(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\nSo, the desired characteristic equation for the closed-loop system is `s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\n\n**3. Select a Target Closed-Loop Matrix `A_cl`**\nWe need to find a matrix `A_cl` that has the characteristic polynomial we just derived. A matrix's characteristic polynomial is `s^2 - trace(A_cl)s + det(A_cl) = 0`. By comparing this with `s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`, we need:\n*   `trace(A_cl) = -2`\n*   `det(A_cl) = 2`\n\nA simple choice for such a matrix is the controller companion form: `A_cl = [0, 1; -c0, -c1]`, whose characteristic polynomial is `s^2 + c1s + c0`. Comparing with `s^2 + 2s + 2`, we have `c1 = 2` and `c0 = 2`.\nTherefore, we can choose our target closed-loop matrix as:\n`A_cl = [0, 1; -2, -2]`\n\n**4. Solve for the Feedback Gain Matrix F**\nThe relationship between the matrices is `A_cl = A + BF`. We can solve for `F`.\n`BF = A_cl - A`\nSince `B` is a square and invertible matrix, we can pre-multiply by `B_inv`:\n`F = B_inv * (A_cl - A)`\n\n**Step 4a: Calculate the inverse of B**\n`B = [1, 2; 1, 0]`\n`det(B) = (1)(0) - (2)(1) = -2`\n`B_inv = (1/det(B)) * adj(B) = (1/-2) * [0, -2; -1, 1]`\n`B_inv = [0, 1; 1/2, -1/2]`\n\n**Step 4b: Calculate `(A_cl - A)`**\n`A_cl - A = [0, 1; -2, -2] - [-1, 1; 1, 0]`\n`A_cl - A = [(0 - (-1)), (1 - 1); (-2 - 1), (-2 - 0)]`\n`A_cl - A = [1, 0; -3, -2]`\n\n**Step 4c: Calculate F**\n`F = B_inv * (A_cl - A)`\n`F = [0, 1; 1/2, -1/2] * [1, 0; -3, -2]`\n`F = [(0*1 + 1*(-3)), (0*0 + 1*(-2)); (1/2*1 + (-1/2)*(-3)), (1/2*0 + (-1/2)*(-2))]`\n`F = [-3, -2; (1/2 + 3/2), (0 + 1)]`\n`F = [-3, -2; 2, 1]`\n\n**5. Final Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\nLet's check if our calculated `F` places the poles correctly.\n`A_cl = A + BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [1, 2; 1, 0] * [-3, -2; 2, 1]`\n`A_cl = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [(-3 + 4), (-2 + 2); (-3 + 0), (-2 + 0)]`\n`A_cl = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [1, 0; -3, -2]`\n`A_cl = [0, 1; -2, -2]`\nThe characteristic equation for this `A_cl` is `det(sI - A_cl) = det([s, -1; 2, s+2]) = s(s+2) - (-1)(2) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\nThe roots of this equation are `s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = -1 ± j`.\nThe result is correct.\n\n<<<[-3, -2; 2, 1]>>>"
