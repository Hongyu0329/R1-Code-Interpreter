    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Matrix and the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the determinant of the matrix A, which is given as:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe information about the \"Markov quiver\" and \"$m_{1/2} = 13$\" is context for where this matrix arises but does not change the matrix itself or the mathematical operation required. The core task is to calculate det(A).\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method for Calculating the Determinant**\nFor a 3x3 matrix, we can use several methods. We will use the standard cofactor expansion method (also known as the Rule of Sarrus as a mnemonic).\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n\\[\nB = \\begin{bmatrix}\na & b & c \\\\\nd & e & f \\\\\ng & h & i\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis given by:\n`det(B) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Formula to Matrix A**\nLet's identify the elements of matrix A according to the formula:\n*   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n*   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n*   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\nNow, substitute these values into the determinant formula:\n`det(A) = 2 * ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - (-1) * ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))`\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Arithmetic Calculation Step-by-Step**\n1.  Calculate the terms inside the parentheses:\n    *   `((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) = (4 - 1) = 3`\n    *   `((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) = (-2 - 1) = -3`\n    *   `((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1)) = (1 - (-2)) = 1 + 2 = 3`\n\n2.  Substitute these results back into the main expression:\n    `det(A) = 2 * (3) - (-1) * (-3) + (-1) * (3)`\n\n3.  Perform the multiplications:\n    *   `2 * (3) = 6`\n    *   `(-1) * (-3) = 3`\n    *   `(-1) * (3) = -3`\n\n4.  Combine the terms:\n    `det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3`\n\n5.  Calculate the final result:\n    `det(A) = 0`\n\n**Careful Points and Verification**\n*   **Sign Errors:** Be very careful with the negative signs throughout the calculation, especially in the `b` and `c` terms of the cofactor expansion and when multiplying negative numbers.\n*   **Alternative Method (Row/Column Operations):** A property of determinants is that their value is unchanged if you add a multiple of one row/column to another. Notice that for matrix A, the sum of the elements in each row is 0 (e.g., Row 1: 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0). This also holds for the columns.\n*   Let's perform the column operation `C1 -> C1 + C2 + C3` (add the second and third columns to the first column):\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2+(-1)+(-1) & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1+2+(-1) & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1+(-1)+2 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n0 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n*   A fundamental property of determinants is that if a matrix has a column (or row) of all zeros, its determinant is 0. Since the first column of the resulting matrix is all zeros, the determinant is 0. This confirms our calculation.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe determinant of the given adjacency matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
