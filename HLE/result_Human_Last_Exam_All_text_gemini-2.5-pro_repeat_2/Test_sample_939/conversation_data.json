    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Problem\n\nThe question asks which color values defined in the ROMM RGB color space cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code. This is a color gamut problem. A color can be represented if it falls within the destination color space's gamut. If it falls outside, it cannot be represented accurately.\n\n*   **ROMM RGB:** A wide-gamut color space, meaning it can represent a larger range of colors than sRGB. It uses a D50 white point and a gamma of approximately 1.8.\n*   **sRGB:** The standard color space for web and most displays. It has a smaller gamut than ROMM RGB, uses a D65 white point, and a more complex gamma function (approximately 2.2).\n*   **sRGB Hex Code:** This represents an sRGB color where each channel (Red, Green, Blue) has an integer value from 0 to 255. In the standard [0, 1] floating-point representation, this means all three component values must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.\n\nA ROMM RGB color cannot be represented in sRGB if, after the conversion process, any of its resulting linear sRGB components are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion Process\n\nTo check if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it and check the resulting values. The process is:\n1.  **Linearize ROMM RGB:** The input values are gamma-encoded. We must convert them to linear light values. The ROMM RGB transfer function is approximately `V_linear = V_encoded ^ 1.8`.\n2.  **Convert to Linear sRGB:** We apply a 3x3 matrix transformation to the linear ROMM RGB values to convert them to linear sRGB values. This matrix accounts for the differences in primary colors and white points between the two spaces. The standard matrix for converting linear ROMM RGB (with a D50 white point) to linear sRGB (with a D65 white point) is approximately:\n    ```\n    [R_sRGB_lin]   [ 1.3459 -0.2556 -0.0511] [R_ROMM_lin]\n    [G_sRGB_lin] = [-0.5446  1.5082  0.0205] [G_ROMM_lin]\n    [B_sRGB_lin]   [ 0.0000  0.0000  1.2118] [B_ROMM_lin]\n    ```\n3.  **Check Gamut:** We check if the resulting linear sRGB values (`R_sRGB_lin`, `G_sRGB_lin`, `B_sRGB_lin`) are all within the valid range of [0, 1]. If any value is outside this range, the color is out of gamut.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Color Option\n\nLet's apply this process to each of the given colors.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   **Linearize:** `[0, 0, 1^1.8]` = `[0, 0, 1]`\n*   **Convert:**\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin` = (1.3459 * 0) + (-0.2556 * 0) + (-0.0511 * 1) = **-0.0511**\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin` = (-0.5446 * 0) + (1.5082 * 0) + (0.0205 * 1) = 0.0205\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin` = (0 * 0) + (0 * 0) + (1.2118 * 1) = **1.2118**\n*   **Conclusion:** The R value is less than 0 and the B value is greater than 1. This color is out of the sRGB gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   **Linearize:** `[0, 1^1.8, 0]` = `[0, 1, 0]`\n*   **Convert:**\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin` = (1.3459 * 0) + (-0.2556 * 1) + (-0.0511 * 0) = **-0.2556**\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin` = (-0.5446 * 0) + (1.5082 * 1) + (0.0205 * 0) = **1.5082**\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin` = (0 * 0) + (0 * 1) + (1.2118 * 0) = 0\n*   **Conclusion:** The R value is less than 0 and the G value is greater than 1. This highly saturated green is far outside the sRGB gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearize:** `[0, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8]` ≈ `[0, 0.287, 0.393]`\n*   **Convert:**\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin` = (1.3459 * 0) + (-0.2556 * 0.287) + (-0.0511 * 0.393) ≈ **-0.093**\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin` = (-0.5446 * 0) + (1.5082 * 0.287) + (0.0205 * 0.393) ≈ 0.441\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin` = (0 * 0) + (0 * 0.287) + (1.2118 * 0.393) ≈ 0.476\n*   **Conclusion:** The R value is less than 0. This saturated cyan color is outside the sRGB gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   **Linearize:** `[0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8]` ≈ `[0.181, 0.287, 0.393]`\n*   **Convert:**\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin` = (1.3459 * 0.181) + (-0.2556 * 0.287) + (-0.0511 * 0.393) ≈ 0.150\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin` = (-0.5446 * 0.181) + (1.5082 * 0.287) + (0.0205 * 0.393) ≈ 0.342\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin` = (0 * 0.181) + (0 * 0.287) + (1.2118 * 0.393) ≈ 0.476\n*   **Conclusion:** All resulting linear sRGB values are between 0 and 1. This less saturated color is inside the sRGB gamut and **can** be represented.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   **Linearize:** `[1^1.8, 1^1.8, 1^1.8]` = `[1, 1, 1]`\n*   **Convert:**\n    *   `R_sRGB_lin` = (1.3459 * 1) + (-0.2556 * 1) + (-0.0511 * 1) = **1.0392**\n    *   `G_sRGB_lin` = (-0.5446 * 1) + (1.5082 * 1) + (0.0205 * 1) = 0.9841\n    *   `B_sRGB_lin` = (0 * 1) + (0 * 1) + (1.2118 * 1) = **1.2118**\n*   **Conclusion:** This color represents the white point of ROMM RGB (D50). The R and B values are greater than 1, which means the D50 white point itself lies outside the sRGB gamut (whose white point is D65). Therefore, it **cannot** be represented.\n\n### Final Summary\n\nThe colors that result in out-of-gamut sRGB values are 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3, 5>>>"
