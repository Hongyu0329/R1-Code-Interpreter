    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify and convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers.**\nThe equation provided is `XXIV / XXX - XXXVII = ?`.\n*   **XXIV**: In Roman numerals, X = 10 and V = 5 and I = 1. When a smaller numeral (I) comes before a larger one (V), it is subtracted. So, IV = 5 - 1 = 4. Therefore, XXIV = 10 + 10 + 4 = 24.\n*   **XXX**: X = 10. So, XXX = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30.\n*   **XXXVII**: X = 10, V = 5, I = 1. So, XXXVII = 10 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 37.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly interpret the Roman numeral rules, especially the subtractive principle (like IV for 4) versus the additive principle (like VI for 6).\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the equation using modern numbers.**\nSubstituting the converted numbers back into the equation, we get:\n`24 / 30 - 37 = ?`\n\n**Step 3: Solve the equation following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).**\nAccording to the order of operations, division must be performed before subtraction.\n*   **First, perform the division:** `24 / 30`\n    *   This can be simplified as a fraction to 4/5.\n    *   As a decimal, 4 ÷ 5 = 0.8.\n*   **Second, perform the subtraction:** `0.8 - 37`\n    *   Subtracting a larger number from a smaller number results in a negative value.\n    *   0.8 - 37 = -36.2\n\n**Careful Point:** Remember to follow the order of operations. Performing subtraction first (`30 - 37 = -7`) and then division (`24 / -7`) would lead to an incorrect answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe solution to the equation `24 / 30 - 37` is -36.2.\n\n<<<-36.2>>>"
