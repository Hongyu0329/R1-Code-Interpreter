    "This problem asks for the computation of the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Manifolds and the Quantity to Compute:**\n    We are given two manifolds:\n    *   $\\Sigma_{31}$: An oriented closed surface of genus $g_1 = 31$.\n    *   $\\Sigma_{17}$: An oriented closed surface of genus $g_2 = 17$.\n    We need to compute the simplicial volume of their product, $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\|$.\n\n2.  **Recall Key Properties of Simplicial Volume:**\n    The simplicial volume, denoted by $\\|M\\|$, is a topological invariant of a manifold $M$. We need two key results established by Gromov:\n    *   **Simplicial Volume of a Surface:** The simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$ is given by:\n        $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 0$ if $g=0$ or $g=1$.\n        $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g-4$ if $g \\ge 2$.\n        This formula is derived from the fact that for hyperbolic surfaces ($g \\ge 2$), the simplicial volume is twice the absolute value of the Euler characteristic: $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2|2-2g| = 4g-4$.\n    *   **Product Formula:** For products of negatively curved manifolds, the simplicial volume is multiplicative. Specifically, for two closed oriented hyperbolic surfaces $\\Sigma_{g_1}$ and $\\Sigma_{g_2}$ (which means $g_1 \\ge 2$ and $g_2 \\ge 2$), the following product formula holds:\n        $\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = \\|\\Sigma_{g_1}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{g_2}\\|$.\n\n3.  **Check the Conditions:**\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1 = 31$. Since $31 \\ge 2$, it is a hyperbolic surface.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g_2 = 17$. Since $17 \\ge 2$, it is also a hyperbolic surface.\n    *   Since both surfaces are hyperbolic, the product formula for simplicial volume is applicable.\n\n4.  **Compute the Simplicial Volume of Each Surface:**\n    *   Using the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g - 4$ for $g \\ge 2$:\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$:\n        $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times 31 - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$:\n        $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times 17 - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n5.  **Compute the Simplicial Volume of the Product:**\n    *   Using the product formula $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$:\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 120 \\times 64$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   $120 \\times 64 = 7680$.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   It is crucial to know the correct formula for the simplicial volume of a surface, which depends on its genus. For genus 0 (sphere) and 1 (torus), the volume is 0. For genus $g \\ge 2$, it is $4g-4$.\n*   One must verify that the conditions for the product formula are met. The formula $\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = \\|\\Sigma_{g_1}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{g_2}\\|$ is not universally true for all products of manifolds but holds for products of hyperbolic surfaces. Since $31 \\ge 2$ and $17 \\ge 2$, the condition is satisfied.\n*   The calculation is a simple multiplication, but care must be taken to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation:\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31}$ is $4(31)-4 = 120$.\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{17}$ is $4(17)-4 = 64$.\nThe simplicial volume of the product is the product of the individual simplicial volumes: $120 \\times 64 = 7680$.\n\n<<<7680>>>"
