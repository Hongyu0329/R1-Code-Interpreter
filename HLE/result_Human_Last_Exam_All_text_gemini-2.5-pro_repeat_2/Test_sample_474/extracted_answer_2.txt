No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry in bumblebees is to deter predators, primarily birds. The validity of any mimicry grouping depends on how these predators perceive the bees' warning signals. The proposed method uses untrained humans as observers, which is fundamentally flawed for two main reasons:
1.  **Different Visual Systems:** Human vision is trichromatic and cannot perceive ultraviolet (UV) light. Avian vision is tetrachromatic and includes UV perception. Many patterns on insects are only visible in the UV spectrum. Therefore, two bee species that appear similar to a human may be easily distinguishable to a bird, and vice versa. The study is measuring similarity for the wrong audience.
2.  **Lack of Ecological Context:** The human subjects are "untrained" and have not learned through negative reinforcement (being stung) which patterns to avoid. Their criteria for similarity are arbitrary and not shaped by the selective pressures that drive the evolution of mimicry. A predator learns to focus on specific, salient cues that signal danger, a context completely missing for the undergraduate observers.
Therefore, the resulting clusters would be based on human aesthetic similarity, not on the functional similarity that defines ecological mimicry syndromes.
