    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the memory usage of the most memory-efficient C program for the given problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe goal is to compare two strings of the same length lexicographically, ignoring the case of the letters. The program should output -1, 1, or 0 based on whether the first string is less than, greater than, or equal to the second string, respectively. The primary constraint for this task is to find a solution that is as memory-efficient as possible and to calculate the total memory (m) in bytes used by its variables.\n\n### Step 2: Core Logic and Algorithm\n1.  **Input:** Read the two strings from standard input.\n2.  **Comparison:** The comparison must be done character by character, from left to right.\n3.  **Case-Insensitivity:** Before comparing a character from the first string with the corresponding character from the second string, both characters must be converted to a common case (either both to lowercase or both to uppercase). Using the `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is a standard way to achieve this.\n4.  **Iteration:** A loop will iterate through the strings. Let's say the loop index is `i`. In each iteration, we compare `tolower(string1[i])` with `tolower(string2[i])`.\n5.  **Determining the Result:**\n    *   If at any position `i`, `tolower(string1[i])` is less than `tolower(string2[i])`, the first string is lexicographically smaller. The program should print \"-1\" and terminate immediately.\n    *   If `tolower(string1[i])` is greater than `tolower(string2[i])`, the first string is lexicographically larger. The program should print \"1\" and terminate immediately.\n    *   If the characters are equal, the loop continues to the next position.\n6.  **Equality:** If the loop completes without finding any difference, it means the strings are equal when case is ignored. The program should print \"0\".\n\n### Step 3: Designing for Memory Efficiency\nTo write the most memory-efficient program, we need to minimize the number and size of variables.\n\n*   **Storing Strings:** The input consists of two separate lines. Standard input reads sequentially. This means we cannot read a character from the first line and then immediately a character from the second line in a single loop. We must read and store the first string before we can read the second one. Therefore, we need to allocate memory to store both strings.\n*   **Buffer Size:** The problem states the maximum string length is 100. In C, strings are null-terminated. So, to store a string of up to 100 characters, we need a character array of size `100 + 1 = 101`. We will need two such arrays.\n    *   `char s1[101];`\n    *   `char s2[101];`\n*   **Looping Variable:** We need a variable to iterate through the strings. An integer index is a natural choice.\n    *   `int i;`\n*   **Minimizing Other Variables:** To be maximally memory-efficient, we should avoid declaring any other variables.\n    *   We don't need a separate variable to store the result (e.g., `int result`). We can print the result and exit the program as soon as the comparison outcome is known.\n    *   We don't need temporary variables to store the lowercase versions of the characters. We can call `tolower()` directly inside the `if` condition: `if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(s2[i])) ...`.\n*   **Pointers vs. Index:** An alternative to an integer index `i` is to use pointers (`char *p1 = s1; char *p2 = s2;`). However, on common 64-bit systems used in competitive programming, a pointer (`char *`) is 8 bytes, while an `int` is typically 4 bytes. Therefore, using an integer index is more memory-efficient.\n\n### Step 4: The Final Program Structure and Memory Calculation\nBased on the analysis, the most memory-efficient C program would have the following structure and variables:\n\n```c\n// #include <stdio.h>\n// #include <ctype.h>\n\n// int main() {\n//     // Variable 1: Buffer for the first string\n//     char s1[101];\n\n//     // Variable 2: Buffer for the second string\n//     char s2[101];\n\n//     scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n//     scanf(\"%s\", s2);\n\n//     // Variable 3: Loop counter\n//     for (int i = 0; s1[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n//         if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(s2[i])) {\n//             printf(\"-1\\n\");\n//             return 0;\n//         }\n//         if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(s2[i])) {\n//             printf(\"1\\n\");\n//             return 0;\n//         }\n//     }\n\n//     printf(\"0\\n\");\n//     return 0;\n// }\n```\n\nNow, let's calculate the total memory `m` used by the variables in this program. We sum the sizes of all declared variables.\n\n1.  **Variable `s1`**: A character array of size 101.\n    *   `sizeof(char)` is defined as 1 byte in C.\n    *   Memory for `s1` = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Variable `s2`**: A character array of size 101.\n    *   Memory for `s2` = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Variable `i`**: An integer used as a loop counter.\n    *   `sizeof(int)` is platform-dependent, but on virtually all modern competitive programming platforms (both 32-bit and 64-bit), it is 4 bytes.\n    *   Memory for `i` = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nm = (Memory for `s1`) + (Memory for `s2`) + (Memory for `i`)\nm = 101 + 101 + 4\nm = **206 bytes**\n\nThis represents the minimum memory required for variables to solve the problem following standard C practices.\n\n<<<206>>>"
