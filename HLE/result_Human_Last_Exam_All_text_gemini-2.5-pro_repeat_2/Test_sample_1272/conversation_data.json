    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Historical Figures and Context**\n*   **Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟):** A high-ranking military commander of the Chinese Ming Dynasty.\n*   **Conflict:** The Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427) in Vietnam, part of the larger Ming–Việt War (1407–1427). This uprising was led by the Vietnamese leader Lê Lợi against the Ming occupation of Vietnam (which the Ming called Jiaozhi Province).\n\n**Step 2: Research Mu Sheng's Campaigns in Vietnam**\n*   Mu Sheng was involved in the initial invasion of Vietnam in 1406-1407, which was successful.\n*   His most critical involvement came during the final stages of the Lam Sơn Uprising. In 1427, the Ming Emperor sent two massive relief armies to crush the Vietnamese rebellion and save the besieged Ming forces in the capital, Đông Quan (modern-day Hanoi).\n*   One army, commanded by Liu Sheng (柳升), advanced from Guangxi in the northeast.\n*   The second army, commanded by Mu Sheng, advanced from Yunnan in the northwest.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Specific Defeat**\n*   The army led by Liu Sheng was famously ambushed and completely destroyed at the Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang (in modern-day Lạng Sơn and Bắc Giang provinces). This was a catastrophic defeat for the Ming, but it was Liu Sheng's defeat, not Mu Sheng's.\n*   Mu Sheng's army was advancing cautiously from Yunnan along the Red River valley. Upon hearing the news of Liu Sheng's total annihilation, Mu Sheng's troops were terrified and their morale collapsed.\n*   Sensing this weakness, Vietnamese commanders under Lê Lợi, specifically Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, were ordered to intercept and attack Mu Sheng's force.\n*   They laid ambushes and attacked the Ming army at **Lãnh Câu (冷溝)** and **Đan Xá (丹舍)**.\n*   In these engagements, Mu Sheng's army was defeated, suffering thousands of casualties. This defeat shattered any remaining will to fight, and Mu Sheng was forced to abandon his campaign and lead his panicked army in a retreat back to Yunnan.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the Battle Sites on a Modern Map**\n*   The historical battle sites of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá are located by historians in the region of the Sông Lô (Lô River) and Sông Chảy (Chảy River).\n*   This area corresponds to the territory of the modern-day **Tuyên Quang Province** in Northern Vietnam.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\n*   While Mu Sheng had a long military career, his defeat at Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá in 1427 was his most significant and personal failure during the war in Vietnam. It was the first major defeat of a large army under his direct command in this specific conflict, leading to the complete failure of the Ming relief effort and their eventual withdrawal from Vietnam.\n*   Therefore, the current Vietnamese province where this major defeat occurred is Tuyên Quang.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
