    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and the Pieces**\n\n*   **The Board:** A standard 8x8 chess board has 64 squares.\n*   **Edge Squares:** These are the squares along the perimeter of the board. This includes all squares in the 1st and 8th ranks, and all squares in the 'a' and 'h' files.\n*   **Counting Edge Squares:** There are 8 squares on the top row (rank 8), 8 on the bottom row (rank 1), 6 more on the left column (file 'a', excluding the corners already counted), and 6 more on the right column (file 'h', excluding corners). Total edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n*   **The Piece:** A bishop. The key rule for a bishop is that it attacks any number of squares along a diagonal. This means to place the maximum number of bishops, no two bishops can be on the same diagonal line.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Core Constraint and a Key Insight**\n\n*   **Constraint:** No two bishops can attack each other.\n*   **Key Insight:** A bishop always stays on the color of square it starts on. A bishop on a white square can only attack other squares of the same color. A bishop on a black square can only attack other black squares. This means we can solve the problem for white squares and black squares independently and then combine the results.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Placement on White Edge Squares**\n\n1.  **Count White Edge Squares:** Let's count the number of white squares on the edge of the board.\n    *   Rank 1: a1, c1, e1, g1 (4 squares)\n    *   Rank 8: b8, d8, f8, h8 (4 squares)\n    *   File 'a' (not including corners): a2, a4, a6 (3 squares)\n    *   File 'h' (not including corners): h3, h5, h7 (3 squares)\n    *   Total white edge squares = 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 14 squares.\n\n2.  **Find Diagonal Conflicts:** We need to see if any of these 14 squares lie on the same diagonal.\n    *   The most prominent diagonal on a chessboard is the long one from corner to corner. The main white diagonal runs from a1 to h8.\n    *   The squares a1 and h8 are both white edge squares. Since they are on the same diagonal, we can only place one bishop on this diagonal. We cannot place a bishop on both a1 and h8.\n    *   A careful check of all other white edge squares reveals that no other two squares share a diagonal. For example, c1 and d8 are on different diagonals. a2 and b8 are on different diagonals.\n    *   Therefore, the only conflict among the 14 white edge squares is the pair (a1, h8).\n\n3.  **Maximize and Calculate Empty Squares:** To place the maximum number of bishops, we will place one bishop on one of the conflicting squares (e.g., a1) and bishops on all the other 12 non-conflicting squares.\n    *   Maximum bishops on white edge squares = 1 (from the a1-h8 pair) + 12 (from the other squares) = 13.\n    *   Number of white edge squares that will lack a bishop = (Total white edge squares) - (Max bishops placed) = 14 - 13 = 1.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Placement on Black Edge Squares**\n\n1.  **Count Black Edge Squares:** The board is symmetric, so there should be 14 black edge squares as well.\n    *   Rank 1: b1, d1, f1, h1 (4 squares)\n    *   Rank 8: a8, c8, e8, g8 (4 squares)\n    *   File 'a' (not including corners): a3, a5, a7 (3 squares)\n    *   File 'h' (not including corners): h2, h4, h6 (3 squares)\n    *   Total black edge squares = 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 14 squares.\n\n2.  **Find Diagonal Conflicts:** Similar to the white squares, we look for squares on the same diagonal.\n    *   The main black diagonal runs from h1 to a8.\n    *   The squares h1 and a8 are both black edge squares. Since they are on the same diagonal, we can only place one bishop on this line.\n    *   Again, a check of all other black edge squares shows no other diagonal conflicts.\n\n3.  **Maximize and Calculate Empty Squares:**\n    *   Maximum bishops on black edge squares = 1 (from the h1-a8 pair) + 12 (from the other squares) = 13.\n    *   Number of black edge squares that will lack a bishop = 14 - 13 = 1.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Results for the Final Answer**\n\n*   We are asked for the total number of edge squares that would lack bishops.\n*   Number of empty white edge squares = 1.\n*   Number of empty black edge squares = 1.\n*   Total edge squares lacking bishops = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nIn summary, to maximize the number of bishops on the 28 edge squares, we can place 26 of them. This leaves 2 squares empty: one white square (either a1 or h8) and one black square (either a8 or h1).\n\n<<<2>>>"
