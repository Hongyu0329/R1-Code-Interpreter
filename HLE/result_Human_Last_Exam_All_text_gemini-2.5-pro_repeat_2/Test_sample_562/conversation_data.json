    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the character 謄.**\nThe character 謄 is a composite kanji (会意形声文字 - kaii keisei moji) that can be divided into a left part and a right part.\n*   Left part: 言\n*   Right part: 朕\n\n**Step 2: Identify the radical (部首 - bushu).**\nIn most left-right structured kanji, the left component serves as the radical, indicating the character's general semantic category. The right component often serves as the phonetic element.\n*   The left part, 言, means \"word,\" \"speech,\" or \"to say.\"\n*   The character 謄 itself means \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which is an action closely related to words and writing.\nTherefore, the radical of 謄 is 言.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the name of the radical.**\nRadicals are given specific names in Japanese, which often depend on their position within a character.\n*   The radical is 言.\n*   When a radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n*   The Sino-Japanese reading (*on'yomi*) of 言 is \"gon\" or \"gen.\"\n*   Combining the reading \"gon\" with the position name \"hen,\" and applying a sound change called rendaku (where \"h\" becomes \"b\"), we get the name \"Gonben\" (ごんべん).\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the name into Hepburn.**\nThe Japanese name for the radical is ごんべん. Following the standard Hepburn romanization system, this is transcribed as \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correct Decomposition:** It is essential to correctly break down the character. An incorrect decomposition, such as seeing it as a top-bottom structure, would lead to the wrong radical.\n2.  **Radical vs. Phonetic Component:** One must distinguish between the radical (which gives the meaning category) and the phonetic component (which suggests the pronunciation). Here, 言 is the radical, and 朕 is the phonetic component.\n3.  **Positional Naming:** Be aware that the name of the radical changes with its position. Simply giving the name of the character \"gen\" or its Japanese reading \"kotoba\" is not specific enough. The positional name \"Gonben\" is required.\n4.  **Hepburn Transcription:** Ensure the final answer is in the correct Hepburn transcription format as requested by the example (\"Onnahen\").\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the radical and its correct name.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
