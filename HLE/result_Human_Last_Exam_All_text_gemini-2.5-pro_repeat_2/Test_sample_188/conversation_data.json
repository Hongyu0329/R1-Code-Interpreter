  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to find the maximum possible length (in characters) of the secret message hidden in the Ching book.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Message (Plaintext):**\n    *   The secret message is written using letters (characters) found in the Shu book.\n    *   The Shu book uses a specific set of 120 common Chinese characters.\n    *   Therefore, the \"alphabet\" for the secret message consists of **120 unique characters**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Encrypted Source (Ciphertext):**\n    *   The Ching book contains the encrypted form of the message.\n    *   It consists of exactly **9999 symbols**.\n    *   These symbols are described as \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Unique Symbol Types:**\n    *   \"Yinyang\" represents 2 states (Yin and Yang).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (The Five Elements) represents 5 states (e.g., Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water).\n    *   A \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol is a combination of one state from each category.\n    *   Total number of unique symbol types = (Number of yinyang states) × (Number of wuxing states) = 2 × 5 = **10 unique symbols**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Encoding Scheme:**\n    *   We need to encode a message with an alphabet of 120 characters using a system that has only 10 unique symbols.\n    *   This means a single symbol from the Ching is not enough to represent a single character of the message (since 10 < 120).\n    *   Therefore, a sequence of multiple symbols must be used to represent each single character. This is a common principle in information theory, similar to how bits (0s and 1s) are grouped to represent letters in ASCII.\n    *   Let `N` be the number of symbols from the Ching needed to represent one character of the message. The number of combinations possible with `N` symbols is `10^N`.\n    *   To represent all 120 characters, the number of combinations must be at least 120. We need to find the smallest integer `N` that satisfies the condition: `10^N ≥ 120`.\n        *   If `N = 1`, `10^1 = 10`. This is less than 120 (not enough combinations).\n        *   If `N = 2`, `10^2 = 100`. This is less than 120 (still not enough combinations).\n        *   If `N = 3`, `10^3 = 1000`. This is greater than 120 (enough combinations).\n    *   So, a fixed-length code would require a sequence of **3 symbols** from the Ching to encode each character of the secret message.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Message Length:**\n    *   The Ching provides a total of 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each character of the message requires 3 of these symbols.\n    *   Maximum message length = (Total available symbols) / (Symbols required per character)\n    *   Maximum message length = 9999 / 3 = **3333 characters**.\n\n7.  **Identify and Discard Irrelevant Information:**\n    *   **\"Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\"**: The total number of characters in the Shu is irrelevant. The crucial piece of information is the size of the alphabet it uses (120 characters).\n    *   **\"Computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms\"**: This is about the speed of decoding, not the information capacity or length of the message.\n    *   **\"Computation time for each operation... is 10 ns and 30 ns\"**: This is also irrelevant processing speed information.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the analysis, the maximum length of the message is calculated by dividing the total number of symbols available for encryption by the number of symbols required to represent a single character from the message's alphabet.\n\n*   Total symbols in Ching: 9999\n*   Symbols needed per message character: 3\n*   Maximum message length: 9999 / 3 = 3333\n\n<<<3333>>>"
