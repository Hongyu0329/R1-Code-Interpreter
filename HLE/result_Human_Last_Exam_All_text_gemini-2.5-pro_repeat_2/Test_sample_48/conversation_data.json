    "An elegant way to solve this problem is to construct the minimal Deterministic Finite-state Automaton (DFA) by analyzing the structure of the language $L$. The states of the minimal DFA correspond to the equivalence classes of strings under the Myhill-Nerode equivalence relation.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the regular expression\n\nThe regular expression for the language $L$ is:\n$L = ( (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^* (b a | b b a | c a) )^* (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*$\n\nLet's define some simpler languages based on the components of this expression:\n- $U = (b|c)^*$ : any string consisting only of 'b's and 'c's (including the empty string).\n- $Z = \\{bc, cb, bbb\\}$ : a set of specific strings over $\\{b, c\\}$.\n- $V = (a | Z)^* = (a | bc | cb | bbb)^*$ : strings formed by concatenating 'a's and elements of $Z$.\n- $W = (ba | bba | ca) = (b | bb | c)a$ : a set of strings that end with 'a'.\n\nUsing these, the expression for $L$ can be written as:\n$L = (U a V W)^* U a V$\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the strings in L\n\nA string $w$ is in $L$ if it can be parsed according to the expression. Let's analyze the structure of such strings, particularly focusing on the segments between consecutive 'a's and the segment after the last 'a'.\n\nAny string in $L$ must contain at least one 'a'. Let's consider a string $w \\in L$ and write it as $w = u a s_1 a s_2 \\dots a s_k$, where $u \\in (b|c)^*$ and each $s_i$ is a string over $\\{b, c\\}$.\n\n1.  **The prefix before the first 'a'**: This is a string from $U = (b|c)^*$.\n2.  **The suffix after the last 'a'**: This segment must come from the final $V$ term in the expression, and it cannot contain an 'a'. Thus, it must be a string from $Z^* = (bc|cb|bbb)^*$.\n3.  **The segments between consecutive 'a's**: A segment $s_i$ between two 'a's can be formed in two ways:\n    a.  Both 'a's come from within a single expansion of $V$. In $V=(a|Z)^*$, the segment between two 'a's is a string from $Z^*$.\n    b.  The first 'a' is the one specified in $UaV...$ and the second 'a' comes from the following $W = (b|bb|c)a$. The segment is of the form $v \\cdot x$ where $v$ is from $V$ (with no 'a's, so $v \\in Z^*$) and $x \\in \\{b, bb, c\\}$. This gives strings from $Z^*(b|bb|c)$.\n    Combining these, the set of allowed segments between consecutive 'a's is $M = Z^* \\cup Z^*(b|bb|c) = Z^*(\\epsilon | b | bb | c)$.\n\nSo, the language $L$ can be described as the set of strings $w$ of the form $u a s_1 a s_2 \\dots a s_{k-1} a s_k$ ($k \\ge 1$) where $u \\in (b|c)^*$, $s_i \\in M$ for $1 \\le i < k$, and $s_k \\in Z^*$.\n\n### Step 3: Design a DFA for the sub-language Z*\n\nTo build a DFA for $L$, we first need to be able to recognize $Z^*$ and $M$. This recognition capability will define the states of our main DFA after it has seen the first 'a'. Let's build a DFA for $Z^* = (bc|cb|bbb)^*$. The states will represent the prefixes of the words in $Z$ that we have seen so far.\n\nLet the states of the $Z^*$-DFA be:\n-   $S_0$: Initial state. Represents having seen a string in $Z^*$ (e.g., $\\epsilon$, $bc$, $bcbbb$). This is the only accepting state.\n-   $S_b$: Represents a suffix that is a string in $Z^*b$ (e.g., $b$, $bcb$).\n-   $S_c$: Represents a suffix that is a string in $Z^*c$ (e.g., $c$, $bccc$ is not possible, so just $c$ after a string in $Z^*$).\n-   $S_{bb}$: Represents a suffix that is a string in $Z^*bb$.\n-   $S_{dead}$: A non-accepting trap state for invalid sequences.\n\nThe transitions for the $Z^*$-DFA over $\\{b,c\\}$ are:\n-   $T(S_0, b) = S_b$\n-   $T(S_0, c) = S_c$\n-   $T(S_b, b) = S_{bb}$\n-   $T(S_b, c) = S_0$ (completes a `bc`)\n-   $T(S_c, b) = S_0$ (completes a `cb`)\n-   $T(S_c, c) = S_{dead}$ (invalid sequence `cc`)\n-   $T(S_{bb}, b) = S_0$ (completes a `bbb`)\n-   $T(S_{bb}, c) = S_{dead}$ (invalid sequence `bbc`)\n-   $T(S_{dead}, b) = S_{dead}$\n-   $T(S_{dead}, c) = S_{dead}$\n\nThis DFA has 5 states. The states $\\{S_0, S_b, S_c, S_{bb}\\}$ are the \"live\" states.\n\n### Step 4: Construct the DFA for L\n\nThe states of the minimal DFA for $L$ can be defined based on the structure we found.\n-   **State $Q_{init}$**: Represents strings with no 'a's, i.e., strings in $(b|c)^*$. This is the initial state. It is non-final.\n    -   On 'b' or 'c', it loops back to itself.\n    -   On 'a', it transitions to a state representing that an 'a' has been seen, and the subsequent empty suffix is in $Z^*$.\n\n-   **States after the first 'a'**: These states will correspond to the states of the $Z^*$-DFA. Let's call them $Q_0, Q_b, Q_c, Q_{bb}, Q_{dead}$, corresponding to $S_0, S_b, S_c, S_{bb}, S_{dead}$.\n    -   A string is in $L$ if it ends in one of these states and the corresponding suffix (after the last 'a') is in $Z^*$. This is only true for state $Q_0$. Thus, $Q_0$ is the only final state among this group.\n    -   Transitions on 'b' and 'c' mimic the $Z^*$-DFA: if $T(S_i, x) = S_j$, then $T(Q_i, x) = Q_j$.\n    -   Transitions on 'a': Reading an 'a' means the segment just read must be in $M = Z^*(\\epsilon | b | bb | c)$. A string is in $M$ if, when processed by the $Z^*$-DFA, it ends in any of the live states $\\{S_0, S_b, S_c, S_{bb}\\}$. Therefore, from any state in $\\{Q_0, Q_b, Q_c, Q_{bb}\\}$, an 'a' transition is valid and leads back to $Q_0$ (since the new suffix after 'a' is empty, which is in $Z^*$).\n\nLet's list the states and transitions for the full DFA for $L$:\n-   States: $\\{Q_{init}, Q_0, Q_b, Q_c, Q_{bb}, Q_{dead}\\}$ (6 states).\n-   Initial State: $Q_{init}$.\n-   Final State: $\\{Q_0\\}$.\n-   Transitions:\n    -   $T(Q_{init}, a) = Q_0$; $T(Q_{init}, b) = Q_{init}$; $T(Q_{init}, c) = Q_{init}$.\n    -   $T(Q_0, a) = Q_0$; $T(Q_0, b) = Q_b$; $T(Q_0, c) = Q_c$.\n    -   $T(Q_b, a) = Q_0$; $T(Q_b, b) = Q_{bb}$; $T(Q_b, c) = Q_0$.\n    -   $T(Q_c, a) = Q_0$; $T(Q_c, b) = Q_0$; $T(Q_c, c) = Q_{dead}$.\n    -   $T(Q_{bb}, a) = Q_0$; $T(Q_{bb}, b) = Q_0$; $T(Q_{bb}, c) = Q_{dead}$.\n    -   $T(Q_{dead}, a|b|c) = Q_{dead}$.\n\n### Step 5: Minimize the DFA\n\nNow we apply a state minimization algorithm (e.g., by finding equivalent states).\nThe initial partition is into final and non-final states:\n$P_0 = \\{\\{Q_0\\}, \\{Q_{init}, Q_b, Q_c, Q_{bb}, Q_{dead}\\}\\}$\n\nLet's check for distinguishability within the non-final set.\n-   $Q_{dead}$ is a trap state and is distinguishable from others.\n-   Compare $Q_c$ and $Q_{bb}$:\n    -   $T(Q_c, a) = Q_0$; $T(Q_{bb}, a) = Q_0$.\n    -   $T(Q_c, b) = Q_0$; $T(Q_{bb}, b) = Q_0$.\n    -   $T(Q_c, c) = Q_{dead}$; $T(Q_{bb}, c) = Q_{dead}$.\n    The transitions from $Q_c$ and $Q_{bb}$ are identical for all input symbols. They both go to the same states ($Q_0$ is in the final partition, $Q_{dead}$ is in the non-final partition). Therefore, $Q_c$ and $Q_{bb}$ are equivalent and can be merged. Let's call the merged state $Q_{c/bb}$.\n\n-   The remaining non-final states $\\{Q_{init}, Q_b, Q_{c/bb}\\}$ are distinguishable from each other:\n    -   $T(Q_{init}, c) = Q_{init}$ (non-final partition) vs $T(Q_b, c) = Q_0$ (final partition). So $Q_{init} \\not\\equiv Q_b$.\n    -   $T(Q_{init}, c) = Q_{init}$ vs $T(Q_{c/bb}, c) = Q_{dead}$. As $Q_{init}$ and $Q_{dead}$ are distinguishable (e.g., on input 'a'), $Q_{init} \\not\\equiv Q_{c/bb}$.\n    -   $T(Q_b, c) = Q_0$ (final partition) vs $T(Q_{c/bb}, c) = Q_{dead}$ (non-final partition). So $Q_b \\not\\equiv Q_{c/bb}$.\n\nNo other states can be merged. The states of the minimal DFA are:\n1.  $Q_{init}$\n2.  $Q_0$ (Final)\n3.  $Q_b$\n4.  $Q_{c/bb}$ (the merged state of $Q_c$ and $Q_{bb}$)\n5.  $Q_{dead}$\n\nThe minimal DFA has 5 states."
