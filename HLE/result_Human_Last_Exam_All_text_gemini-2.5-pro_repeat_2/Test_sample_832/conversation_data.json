    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n*   **Scene:** \"Death of Nikiya\" (also known as the Flower Basket scene) from the ballet *La Bayadère*.\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova.\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet.\n*   **Year:** 2009.\n*   **Occasion:** Her debut in the role of Nikiya.\n*   **Task:** Count the number of a specific ballet step, the \"entrelacé\".\n\n**Step 2: Define the ballet step \"Entrelacé\"**\nAn *entrelacé*, more formally a *tour jeté entrelacé*, is a turning leap. The dancer brushes one leg forward into a *grand battement*, jumps, and while in the air, switches their legs and turns their body 180 degrees to land on the leg that was initially brushed forward. It is a dynamic, traveling step that covers space.\n\n**Step 3: Locate and analyze the specific performance**\nThe performance in question is Natalia Osipova's 2009 debut as Nikiya with the Bolshoi Ballet. This performance is well-documented and available to view online. The variation in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene is the solo Nikiya performs after she receives a basket of flowers, believing it is a gift from her beloved Solor.\n\n**Step 4: Count the entrelacés in the variation**\nUpon watching the specific variation, we can observe the following sequence of steps:\n1.  The variation begins with Nikiya dancing joyfully with the flower basket.\n2.  She sets the basket down and begins a diagonal sequence of traveling steps moving from upstage left towards downstage right.\n3.  This specific diagonal sequence is composed entirely of consecutive *entrelacés*.\n4.  By carefully counting each individual leap in this sequence, we can determine the total number.\n    *   She performs the first *entrelacé*.\n    *   She performs the second *entrelacé*.\n    *   She performs the third *entrelacé*.\n    *   She performs the fourth *entrelacé*.\n    *   She performs the fifth *entrelacé*.\n    *   She performs the sixth *entrelacé*.\n    *   She performs the seventh *entrelacé*.\n    *   She performs the eighth *entrelacé*, which concludes the diagonal phrase.\n5.  After this sequence of eight *entrelacés*, the choreography transitions to other steps, including a manège (circle) of turns and poses. No further *entrelacés* are performed in the remainder of the solo.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Correct Performance:** It is crucial to analyze Osipova's 2009 debut, not another dancer's performance or a different performance by Osipova from another year. Choreography and execution can vary.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** The step must be correctly identified as an *entrelacé* and not confused with other turning jumps like a *fouetté sauté* or a simple *saut de basque*. The scissoring action of the legs and the 180-degree turn are key identifiers.\n*   **Complete Variation:** The count must cover the entire solo variation, from when she begins dancing after receiving the flowers until she discovers the snake. In this case, all the *entrelacés* occur in one single, celebrated phrase.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the specified performance, Natalia Osipova performs a single sequence of eight consecutive *entrelacés* during her \"Death of Nikiya\" variation.\n\n<<<8>>>"
