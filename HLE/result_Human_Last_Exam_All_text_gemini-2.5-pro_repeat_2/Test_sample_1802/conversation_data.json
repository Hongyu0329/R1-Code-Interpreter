    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n1.  **Qudit**: A quantum system of dimension $d$. Its state is described by a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$.\n2.  **Generalized Pauli Operators**: For a $d$-dimensional system, the generalized Pauli operators (or discrete Weyl-Heisenberg operators) are a set of $d^2$ unitary operators $\\{U_{ab} | a,b \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d-1\\}\\}$. They form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. $U_{00}$ is the identity matrix $I$.\n3.  **Pauli Channel $\\Lambda$**: A Pauli channel is a quantum channel whose Kraus operators are proportional to the Pauli operators. Its action on a density matrix $\\rho$ is given by:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} \\rho U_{ab}^\\dagger $$\n    For this to be a valid channel, the coefficients $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ must form a probability distribution, i.e., $p_{ab} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} = 1$. The Kraus operators of the channel can be written as $E_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$.\n4.  **Complementary Channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$**: A quantum channel can be viewed as the result of a system interacting with an environment, after which the environment is discarded. The complementary channel describes the final state of the environment as a function of the initial state of the system. If the channel $\\Lambda$ has Kraus operators $\\{E_k\\}$, its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ maps the system's state $\\rho$ to the environment's state given by:\n    $$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\sum_{k, l} \\text{Tr}(E_k \\rho E_l^\\dagger) |k\\rangle\\langle l|_E $$\n    Here, $\\{|k\\rangle_E\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment, with each basis state corresponding to a Kraus operator $E_k$. For our Pauli channel, the Kraus operators are $\\{E_{ab}\\}$, so the environment will have a basis $\\{|ab\\rangle_E\\}$. The action is:\n    $$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b,a',b'} \\sqrt{p_{ab} p_{a'b'}} \\text{Tr}(U_{ab} \\rho U_{a'b'}^\\dagger) |ab\\rangle\\langle a'b'|_E $$\n5.  **Rank of a Channel**: The term \"rank of a channel\" can be ambiguous. Two common interpretations are:\n    a)  The **Choi rank**, which is the rank of the channel's Choi matrix. This is equivalent to the minimum number of Kraus operators required to represent the channel.\n    b)  The **image dimension rank**, which is the dimension of the image of the channel, i.e., $\\text{dim}(\\text{Im}(\\Lambda))$. This represents the dimension of the space of all possible output operators.\n\n    The phrasing \"maximal rank\" suggests that the rank may vary depending on the specific Pauli channel (i.e., the choice of $\\{p_{ab}\\}$), and we need to find the maximum possible value. We will analyze the problem using the image dimension definition, as it yields a variable quantity that can be maximized.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Rank as Image Dimension\n\nThe complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is a linear map from the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, to the space of environment matrices, $M_{d^2}(\\mathbb{C})$. The rank of this map is the dimension of its image space.\n\nTo find the dimension of the image, we can find the dimension of the span of the outputs for a basis of the input space. We use the Pauli operators $\\{U_{kl}\\}$ as a basis for $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nLet's compute the image of a basis element $U_{kl}$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_{kl}) = \\sum_{a,b,a',b'} \\sqrt{p_{ab} p_{a'b'}} \\text{Tr}(U_{ab} U_{kl} U_{a'b'}^\\dagger) |ab\\rangle\\langle a'b'|_E $$\n\nUsing the orthogonality property of Pauli operators, $\\text{Tr}(A B^\\dagger) = d \\cdot \\delta_{A,B}$, and the multiplication rule $U_{ab}U_{kl} = \\omega^{-bk} U_{a+k, b+l}$ (where $\\omega=e^{2\\pi i/d}$ and arithmetic is modulo $d$), we find the trace term:\n$$ \\text{Tr}(U_{ab} U_{kl} U_{a'b'}^\\dagger) = \\omega^{-bk} \\text{Tr}(U_{a+k, b+l} U_{a'b'}^\\dagger) = d \\cdot \\omega^{-bk} \\delta_{a+k, a'} \\delta_{b+l, b'} $$\nThe trace is non-zero only when $a' = a+k$ and $b' = b+l$. Substituting this back:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_{kl}) = \\sum_{a,b} d \\cdot \\omega^{-bk} \\sqrt{p_{ab} p_{a+k, b+l}} |ab\\rangle\\langle a+k, b+l|_E $$\nThe rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the dimension of the vector space spanned by these $d^2$ matrices $\\{\\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_{kl})\\}$ for $k,l \\in \\{0, ..., d-1\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Maximize the Rank\n\nWe want to choose the probability distribution $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ to maximize this dimension. The dimension is maximized when the matrices $\\{\\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_{kl})\\}$ are linearly independent.\n\nLet's consider a specific Pauli channel: the **completely depolarizing channel**. For this channel, the probability of every Pauli error is uniform:\n$$ p_{ab} = \\frac{1}{d^2} \\quad \\text{for all } a,b $$\nFor this choice, all probabilities are non-zero. The expression for $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_{kl})$ becomes:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_{kl}) = \\sum_{a,b} d \\cdot \\omega^{-bk} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{d^2}} |ab\\rangle\\langle a+k, b+l|_E = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{a,b} \\omega^{-bk} |ab\\rangle\\langle a+k, b+l|_E $$\nNow we check if these $d^2$ matrices are linearly independent. Assume a linear combination is zero:\n$$ \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} c_{kl} \\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_{kl}) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum_{k,l} c_{kl} \\left( \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{a,b} \\omega^{-bk} |ab\\rangle\\langle a+k, b+l|_E \\right) = 0 $$\nThis is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix equation. For it to be the zero matrix, the coefficient of each matrix basis element $|ab\\rangle\\langle a'b'|_E$ must be zero. Let $k = a'-a$ and $l = b'-b$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{a,b,a',b'} \\frac{1}{d} c_{a'-a, b'-b} \\, \\omega^{-b(a'-a)} \\, |ab\\rangle\\langle a'b'|_E = 0 $$\nThis implies that for each set of indices $(a,b,a',b')$, the coefficient must be zero:\n$$ c_{a'-a, b'-b} \\, \\omega^{-b(a'-a)} = 0 $$\nSince $\\omega^{-b(a'-a)}$ is never zero, this requires $c_{a'-a, b'-b} = 0$. As $a, a'$ and $b, b'$ range over all values from $0$ to $d-1$, their differences $k=a'-a$ and $l=b'-b$ also range over all values from $0$ to $d-1$. Therefore, $c_{kl}=0$ for all $k,l$.\n\nThis proves that for the completely depolarizing channel, the $d^2$ matrices $\\{\\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_{kl})\\}$ are linearly independent. The dimension of the image space is therefore $d^2$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe dimension of the image of a linear map cannot exceed the dimension of its domain. The domain of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, which has dimension $d^2$. Since we have found a specific Pauli channel (the depolarizing channel) for which the rank (image dimension) of its complementary channel is $d^2$, this must be the maximal possible rank.\n\nFor other channels, the rank can be smaller. For example, for the identity channel ($\\Lambda(\\rho)=\\rho$), where $p_{00}=1$ and all other $p_{ab}=0$, the rank of the complementary channel is 1.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$."
