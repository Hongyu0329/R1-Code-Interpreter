    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source:** Fernand Braudel.\n    *   **Origin of the Assertion:** Braudel is quoting Paul Morand.\n    *   **Context:** A \"global historical perspective.\" This points towards Braudel's work on large-scale history, such as the *longue durée* and world-systems.\n    *   **The Entity's Description:**\n        *   It is a \"conceptual entity.\"\n        *   It is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation,\" meaning a nation is a type or example of this entity.\n        *   It \"should be inscribed within a sphere,\" a metaphor for being a self-contained, complete world.\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:**\n    *   The quote is famously used by Fernand Braudel in the preface, titled \"To the Reader,\" of his monumental work, *The Structures of Everyday Life* (the first volume of *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*).\n    *   In this preface, Braudel sets out his ambition to write a \"history of the world\" but immediately qualifies it.\n\n3.  **Examine the Exact Quote and its Context:**\n    *   Braudel discusses the difficulty of a single world history and proposes looking at multiple \"worlds.\" He then introduces the quote from the writer and diplomat Paul Morand to support this idea.\n    *   The quote from Morand, as cited by Braudel, is approximately (depending on the translation): \"It would be better to say the history of worlds, in the plural... Each has its own time, its own space, its own divisions of time, its own climate, its own economy, its own law... In a word, a **civilization** should be contained within the circumference of a sphere.\"\n\n4.  **Identify the Conceptual Entity:**\n    *   Based on the direct text from the source, the specific word Paul Morand used for the entity that \"should be contained within the circumference of a sphere\" is **civilization**.\n    *   Braudel uses this idea to introduce his own, related concept of the \"world-economy\" (*économie-monde*), which he also sees as a large, self-sufficient zone with its own distinct characteristics, fitting the \"sphere\" metaphor.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   The entity described is a large, self-contained unit of historical analysis.\n    *   The question's clue that it is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation\" fits, as a civilization is a larger-scale socio-cultural and economic unit, of which a nation can be seen as a more modern, politically-defined example.\n    *   However, the precise term used by Morand and quoted by Braudel to fit the description \"should be inscribed within a sphere\" is **civilization**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The precise wording is key:** The question is about what Morand asserted. The direct object of his assertion is \"a civilization.\"\n*   **Braudel's own concept:** While Braudel runs with this idea to develop his concept of a \"world-economy,\" the original quote he uses refers specifically to \"civilization.\"\n*   **The \"Nation\" clue:** This part of the prompt (\"exemplified by the symbol of a nation\") could be slightly misleading if interpreted too strictly. Morand and Braudel are arguing for a unit of analysis that is often *larger* than a single nation-state (e.g., the Islamic world, the Chinese world-economy). The nation serves as a familiar, smaller-scale analogue of a self-contained entity. The core entity in the quote, however, remains civilization.\n\nBy following the chain of citation from the question back to Braudel's text and the original Morand quote he uses, the entity is unequivocally identified.\n\n<<<civilization>>>"
