    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (or square) lattice. Let's denote this number by a(n) for an n-step walk.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D grid of points with integer coordinates (x, y). From any point, one can move to its four nearest neighbors: (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), or (x, y-1).\n*   **n-step Walk:** A sequence of `n` moves on the lattice. It is defined by a sequence of `n+1` vertices.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk where no vertex is visited more than once.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from a fixed point, usually the origin (0,0). The number is independent of the starting point due to the symmetry of the lattice.\n\n**2. Enumeration for Small `n`**\n\nLet's calculate the first few values of a(n) to understand the combinatorial complexity. We assume all walks start at (0,0).\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    From (0,0), we can move to 4 distinct adjacent points: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1). All are valid 1-step SAWs.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    We can extend each of the 4 1-step walks. From the endpoint of a 1-step walk, we cannot move back to the origin. This leaves 3 possible directions for the second step.\n    *   `a(2) = a(1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12`\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    Let's consider extending the 12 2-step walks. A 2-step walk is of the form v₀ → v₁ → v₂. We need to choose v₃. The new vertex v₃ must not be v₀, v₁, or v₂. The move v₃ = v₁ is impossible (it's the reverse of the last step). Can v₃ be v₀? If v₃ is a neighbor of v₂ and also v₃=v₀, then v₀, v₁, v₂ would form a 3-vertex cycle. The square lattice is a bipartite graph, which means it contains no odd-length cycles. Thus, a 3-cycle is impossible. So, from v₂, the only forbidden move is back to v₁. This leaves 3 choices.\n    *   `a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36`\n\n*   **a(4):**\n    This is where it gets tricky. Let's consider extending the 36 3-step walks (v₀ → v₁ → v₂ → v₃). We need to choose v₄. v₄ cannot be v₂, the previous vertex. However, v₄ could be v₀ or v₁.\n    *   Can v₄ be v₁? This would mean v₁, v₂, v₃, v₁ form a 3-cycle, which is impossible.\n    *   Can v₄ be v₀? This would mean v₀, v₁, v₂, v₃, v₀ form a 4-cycle. This is possible on a square lattice. For example, the walk (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (0,1). The endpoint v₃=(0,1) has neighbors (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), and (0,0). The move back to v₂=(1,1) is forbidden. The move to v₀=(0,0) is also forbidden for a self-avoiding walk. So, for this specific path, there are only 2 available moves, not 3.\n    *   We must count how many 3-step walks end in such a \"trapped\" configuration.\n        *   The walks that can form a 4-cycle are those of the shape L, like (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→(0,1).\n        *   Number of such 3-step walks: 4 choices for the first step, 2 for the second (a turn), and 1 for the third (an inward turn). Total: 4 * 2 * 1 = 8 walks. These 8 walks have only 2 valid extensions.\n        *   The remaining 36 - 8 = 28 walks are not in a position to close a 4-cycle, so they each have 3 valid extensions.\n    *   `a(4) = (8 walks * 2 choices) + (28 walks * 3 choices) = 16 + 84 = 100`\n\n**3. The Challenge for a(10)**\n\nThe process of direct enumeration, classifying walk configurations and counting their possible extensions, becomes exceedingly complex as `n` increases. The number of walk classes grows exponentially. A manual calculation for `a(10)` is not feasible.\n\nThere is no known simple closed-form formula for a(n). The values for larger `n` are determined using sophisticated computational algorithms and have been a subject of extensive research in physics and mathematics.\n\n**4. Finding the Value of a(10)**\n\nSince direct calculation is impractical, we refer to the established, computationally verified sequence for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice. This sequence is famously cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411.\n\nThe known values of a(n) are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   **a(10) = 44100**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Lattice Type:** The result is specific to the 2D square (Manhattan) lattice. Other lattices (e.g., triangular, hexagonal, 3D cubic) have different values for a(n).\n2.  **Definition of Walk:** The question is about the number of distinct walk paths (sequences of vertices), not the number of unique shapes they form. Symmetries are already accounted for in the enumeration.\n3.  **Computational Complexity:** Be aware that this is a computationally hard problem (#P-complete), and for anything beyond a small `n`, one must rely on pre-computed results from scientific literature or databases.\n4.  **Verification:** The manual calculation for small `n` is crucial to ensure a correct understanding of the problem's rules and complexity before seeking the final answer from an external source.\n\nBased on the established results for this well-known mathematical problem, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
