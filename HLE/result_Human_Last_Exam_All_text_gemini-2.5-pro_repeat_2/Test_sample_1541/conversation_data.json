    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory usage.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe problem requires us to read a string representing a sum of numbers (only 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s), rearrange the numbers in non-decreasing order, and print the new sum. The key constraint is to write the \"most memory-efficient C program\".\n\n*   **Input**: A string like \"3+2+1+4\", up to 1000 characters long.\n*   **Output**: A sorted string like \"1+2+3+4\".\n*   **Constraint**: Minimize memory usage.\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\n1.  **Memory Usage**: The primary goal is minimizing memory. This means we should avoid storing the entire input string or creating large intermediate arrays if possible.\n2.  **Input Parsing**: The numbers are single digits separated by '+'. We only need to extract the numbers.\n3.  **Sorting**: The numbers are from a very small, fixed set {1, 2, 3, 4}. This strongly suggests that a counting-based approach is much more efficient than a general-purpose sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort.\n4.  **Output Formatting**: The output must be a valid sum string, with numbers separated by '+'. There should be no '+' before the first number or after the last one.\n5.  **Data Types**: To minimize memory, we must choose the smallest possible standard C data type for each variable that can still hold the required range of values.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\n**A. Devise a Memory-Efficient Algorithm**\n\n1.  **Avoid Storing Input**: Instead of reading the whole string into a buffer (e.g., `char s[1001]`), we can process the input character by character directly from the standard input stream using `getchar()`. This saves approximately 1KB of memory.\n\n2.  **Use Counting Sort**: Since the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, and 4, we don't need to store the numbers themselves. We can use a small array of four counters to store the frequency of each number.\n    *   `counts[0]` will store the count of '1's.\n    *   `counts[1]` will store the count of '2's.\n    *   `counts[2]` will store the count of '3's.\n    *   `counts[3]` will store the count of '4's.\n\n3.  **Input Processing Loop**: We will loop with `getchar()` until we encounter a newline or `EOF`. Inside the loop, if the character is a digit, we increment the corresponding counter. We simply ignore the '+' characters.\n\n4.  **Output Generation**: After counting, we construct the output string by printing the numbers in order.\n    *   First, print the '1's, then '2's, and so on.\n    *   To handle the '+' separators correctly without using extra flag variables, we can find the very first number to print, print it without a preceding '+', and then loop through all remaining numbers, always printing a '+' before them. This is slightly more complex logically but saves the memory of a flag variable.\n\n**B. Determine Minimal Data Types and Calculate Memory**\n\nLet's identify the necessary variables and choose the smallest appropriate data types for them. We assume standard data type sizes (`char`=1 byte, `short`=2 bytes, `int`=4 bytes).\n\n1.  **Character Input Variable**: `getchar()` returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` value. So, this variable must be an `int`.\n    *   `int c;` -> `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Frequency Counters**: The maximum length of the input string is 1000. The maximum number of terms (e.g., in \"1+1+...+1\") is (1000+1)/2 ≈ 500. A `char` (max value 127 or 255) is too small to hold this count. A `short` (max value 32,767) is sufficient.\n    *   `short counts[4];` -> `4 * sizeof(short)` = 4 * 2 = **8 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Loop Variable**: We need a loop variable to iterate through our `counts` array (from index 0 to 3). The range 0-4 fits comfortably in a `char`.\n    *   `char i;` -> `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n**C. Final Memory Calculation**\nThe total memory `m` used for variables is the sum of the memory for each variable declared in the program.\n\n*   Memory for `c`: 4 bytes\n*   Memory for `counts` array: 8 bytes\n*   Memory for loop variable `i`: 1 byte\n\nTotal Memory (`m`) = 4 + 8 + 1 = 13 bytes.\n\nThis approach is maximally memory-efficient because it avoids storing the input string and uses the smallest possible data types for its variables.\n\n<<<13>>>"
