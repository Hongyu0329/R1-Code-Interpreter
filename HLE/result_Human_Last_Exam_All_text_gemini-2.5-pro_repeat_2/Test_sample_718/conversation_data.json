    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question and Defining Terms\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the question and define them precisely.\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice ($J$):** An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which every non-empty finite subset has a least upper bound (also called a join or supremum). For any two elements $i, j \\in J$, their join, denoted $i \\vee j$, exists. We can view any poset $J$ as a category where the objects are the elements of $J$, and there is a unique morphism from $i$ to $j$ if and only if $i \\le j$. The condition of being an upper semilattice means this category has pushouts for any pair of morphisms with a common source.\n\n*   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$:** This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(i)$ to each element $i \\in J$ and a linear map $f(i \\le j): f(i) \\to f(j)$ for each relation $i \\le j$ in $J$. These maps must respect composition: if $i \\le j \\le k$, then $f(i \\le k) = f(j \\le k) \\circ f(i \\le j)$. The collection of all such functors forms a category, denoted $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n\n*   **Tame Functor:** In the context of representation theory of posets and algebras, a category of representations is said to be of **tame representation type** if, for any given dimension, the indecomposable representations fall into a finite number of discrete isomorphism classes and a finite number of one-parameter families. A \"tame functor\" is a functor belonging to such a category. This implies that the poset $J$ is of tame representation type. This is in contrast to finite type (only a finite number of indecomposables in total) and wild type (classification is as hard as classifying pairs of matrices).\n\n*   **$n$-resolvable:** A functor $f$ is said to be $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence of functors:\n    $$P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$$\n    where each $P_k$ is a projective functor. This is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of $f$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$, is less than or equal to $n$.\n\nThe question asks for a universal integer $n$ such that any tame functor on an upper semilattice is $n$-resolvable.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Scope of the Property:** The question asks about \"a tame functor\". This could mean an indecomposable tame functor, or any functor in a tame category. We should aim for a result that holds for all functors in the category `Fun(J, Vect_K)`, as this would be the strongest and most general conclusion.\n\n2.  **The Role of \"Tame\":** The condition that the functor is \"tame\" might be crucial, or it might be redundant information if a stronger property (coming from $J$ being an upper semilattice) already determines the answer. We must investigate if the \"upper semilattice\" property alone is sufficient to bound the projective dimension.\n\n3.  **Global vs. Local Properties:** The property of $J$ being an upper semilattice is a global structural property. The property of having tame representation type is determined by the absence of certain \"critical\" finite subposets (a local property). The interplay between these two is subtle.\n\n4.  **Homological Dimension:** The question is about the projective dimension of a single object $f$. However, it is often easier to determine the **global dimension** of the entire category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, which is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all objects in the category. If we can bound the global dimension, we have found a bound for every object.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\n1.  **Connecting Projective Dimension to Category Structure:** The core of the problem lies in homological algebra. The question can be rephrased as: What is the maximum possible projective dimension for a functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, given that $J$ is an upper semilattice and $f$ is tame? Let's focus on the global dimension of the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n\n2.  **The Key Homological Result:** There is a fundamental result in the homological algebra of posets that relates the structure of the poset to the global dimension of its category of representations. The theorem states:\n\n    *   **Theorem:** Let $I$ be a poset. If for every pair of elements $x, y \\in I$, the sub-poset of common upper bounds $\\{z \\in I \\mid z \\ge x \\text{ and } z \\ge y\\}$ is either empty or has a least element, then the global dimension of the category $\\text{Fun}(I, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is at most 2.\n\n3.  **Applying the Theorem to Upper Semilattices:** Let's check if an upper semilattice $J$ satisfies the condition of this theorem.\n    *   By definition, for any two elements $x, y \\in J$, their join (least upper bound) $x \\vee y$ exists.\n    *   The set of common upper bounds of $x$ and $y$ is $\\{z \\in J \\mid z \\ge x \\text{ and } z \\ge y\\}$.\n    *   By the definition of the join, $x \\vee y$ is an element of this set, and for any other element $z$ in the set, we have $z \\ge x \\vee y$.\n    *   This means that $x \\vee y$ is the least element of the set of common upper bounds.\n    *   Therefore, any upper semilattice $J$ satisfies the condition of the theorem.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Global Dimension:** Since $J$ is an upper semilattice, it satisfies the condition of the theorem. Consequently, the global dimension of the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is at most 2.\n    $$ \\text{gl.dim}(\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)) \\le 2 $$\n\n5.  **Implication for Individual Functors:** The global dimension of a category is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all its objects. Since the global dimension of $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is at most 2, this means that for *any* functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, its projective dimension must satisfy:\n    $$ \\text{pd}(f) \\le 2 $$\n\n6.  **Finalizing the Answer:** Since $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 2$ for any functor on an upper semilattice $J$, any such functor has a projective resolution of length at most 2. This means any such functor is **2-resolvable**. The condition that the functor is \"tame\" is consistent with this result but is not required to establish the bound of 2. The structural property of $J$ being an upper semilattice is the dominant constraint.\n\nTherefore, a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable for $n=2$."
