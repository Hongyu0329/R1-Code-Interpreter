    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define \"Triple Crown\"\n\nThe question \"How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\" asks for the number of unique players who have accomplished this feat. It's a crucial point of analysis because the term \"Triple Crown\" in baseball can refer to two different achievements: one for batters (hitters) and one for pitchers.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead their respective league (American League or National League) in three key offensive categories in the same season:\n    1.  Batting Average (AVG)\n    2.  Home Runs (HR)\n    3.  Runs Batted In (RBI)\n\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher must lead their respective league in three key pitching categories in the same season:\n    1.  Wins (W)\n    2.  Strikeouts (K)\n    3.  Earned Run Average (ERA)\n\nTo answer the question thoroughly, we must count the winners for both categories.\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Count the Batting Triple Crown Winners\n\nThe Batting Triple Crown is an exceptionally rare feat and is often the one people refer to when using the term. We will list the unique players who have won it.\n\n*   **Players who won the Batting Triple Crown once:**\n    1.  Paul Hines (1878)\n    2.  Tip O'Neill (1887)\n    3.  Hugh Duffy (1894)\n    4.  Nap Lajoie (1901)\n    5.  Ty Cobb (1909)\n    6.  Heinie Zimmerman (1912)\n    7.  Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n    8.  Chuck Klein (1933)\n    9.  Lou Gehrig (1934)\n    10. Joe Medwick (1937)\n    11. Mickey Mantle (1956)\n    12. Frank Robinson (1966)\n    13. Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n    14. Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n\n*   **Players who won the Batting Triple Crown multiple times:**\n    15. Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925)\n    16. Ted Williams (1942, 1947)\n\n**Careful Point:** The total number of times the Batting Triple Crown has been won is 18, but the question asks for the number of **winners** (unique players).\n\nCounting the unique players from the lists above gives us a total of **16 unique Batting Triple Crown winners**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify and Count the Pitching Triple Crown Winners\n\nThe Pitching Triple Crown, while also a remarkable achievement, has occurred more frequently than the batting version.\n\n*   **Players who won the Pitching Triple Crown once:**\n    1.  Tommy Bond (1877)\n    2.  Cy Young (1901)\n    3.  Rube Waddell (1905)\n    4.  Dazzy Vance (1924)\n    5.  Lefty Gomez (1940)\n    6.  Bucky Walters (1939)\n    7.  Hal Newhouser (1945)\n    8.  Steve Carlton (1972)\n    9.  Dwight Gooden (1985)\n    10. Jake Peavy (2007)\n    11. Clayton Kershaw (2011)\n    12. Justin Verlander (2011)\n    13. Shane Bieber (2020)\n\n*   **Players who won the Pitching Triple Crown multiple times:**\n    14. Walter Johnson (1913, 1918, 1924)\n    15. Grover Cleveland Alexander (1915, 1916, 1920)\n    16. Lefty Grove (1930, 1931)\n    17. Sandy Koufax (1963, 1965, 1966)\n\n**Careful Point:** Shane Bieber's 2020 win occurred during a pandemic-shortened 60-game season. In 2011, both the AL (Verlander) and NL (Kershaw) had a pitching Triple Crown winner.\n\nCounting the unique players from these lists gives us a total of **17 unique Pitching Triple Crown winners**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nTo provide a complete answer, we summarize the findings:\n*   There are **16** unique players who have won the **Batting Triple Crown**.\n*   There are **17** unique players who have won the **Pitching Triple Crown**.\n\nSince no player in MLB history has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown, the total number of unique individuals to win a Triple Crown is 16 + 17 = **33**.\n\nHowever, in common baseball parlance, the question \"How many Triple Crown winners are there?\" almost always refers to the more celebrated and rarer **Batting Triple Crown**. Therefore, the most direct and expected answer is the number of batting winners.\n\nFinal Answer: There have been 16 unique players who have won the MLB Batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<16>>>"
