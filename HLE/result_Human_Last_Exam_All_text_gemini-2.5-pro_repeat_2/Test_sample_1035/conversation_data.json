    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that collectively cover all the edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Understand the input:** We are given a complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$. A complete graph has an edge between every pair of its vertices.\n2.  **Understand the covering requirement:** We need to find a collection, or \"family,\" of bipartite graphs, let's call them $B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k$. The condition is that the union of all the edges from these bipartite graphs must be equal to the set of all edges in $K_{35}$. This means for any pair of vertices in $K_{35}$, the edge connecting them must be present in at least one of the bipartite graphs $B_i$.\n3.  **Understand the quantity to be minimized:** The question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family\". This is interpreted as the sum of the number of vertices in each graph of the family. If $|V(B_i)|$ is the number of vertices in graph $B_i$, we want to minimize the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(B_i)|$. The vertices of each $B_i$ are a subset of the vertices of $K_{35}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Covering vs. Partitioning:** The problem specifies \"covering,\" which means the edge sets of the bipartite graphs $B_i$ can overlap. This is different from \"partitioning,\" which would require the edge sets to be disjoint. Covering problems often have more efficient solutions than partitioning problems. The well-known Graham-Pollak theorem states that partitioning $K_n$ requires at least $n-1$ complete bipartite graphs, leading to a sum of vertices of $\\frac{(n+2)(n-1)}{2}$. The covering problem, however, yields a much smaller number.\n2.  **Interpretation of \"Number of Vertices in a Family\":** The phrase could be ambiguous. However, in the context of graph theory problems of this nature, it standardly refers to the sum of the sizes of the vertex sets of the graphs in the family, i.e., $\\sum |V(B_i)|$. The alternative interpretation, the number of unique vertices used in total ($|\\cup V(B_i)|$), would simply be 35, as any cover must involve all vertices of $K_{35}$ to cover all its edges. This would be too trivial.\n3.  **Connection to a Known Theorem:** This problem is a classic in extremal combinatorics. The solution is given by a theorem proven by Fan Chung (and also by Graham and Winkler). The theorem states that the minimum value of $\\sum |V(B_i)|$ for a bipartite cover of $K_n$ is precisely $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer\n\n1.  **Identify the governing formula:** Based on the established theorem, the minimum total number of vertices is given by the formula:\n    Minimum sum = $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$\n\n2.  **Substitute the given value of n:** In this problem, $n = 35$.\n    Minimum sum = $35 \\times \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$\n\n3.  **Calculate the logarithm term:** We need to find $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$. This is the smallest integer $k$ such that $2^k \\ge 35$.\n    -   $2^5 = 32$ (This is too small).\n    -   $2^6 = 64$ (This is large enough).\n    -   Since $32 < 35 \\le 64$, we have $5 < \\log_2 35 \\le 6$.\n    -   The ceiling of $\\log_2 35$ is therefore 6.\n    -   So, $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer:** Now substitute the value of the logarithm back into the formula:\n    Minimum sum = $35 \\times 6$\n    Minimum sum = $210$\n\nThis result can be achieved by a constructive method. One assigns a unique 6-bit binary string to each of the 35 vertices. Then, for each of the 6 bit positions, a bipartite graph is formed where the partitions are determined by whether a vertex's binary string has a '0' or a '1' in that position. This creates 6 bipartite graphs that cover all edges of $K_{35}$, and the total number of vertices in this family is $6 \\times 35 = 210$. The theorem guarantees that no construction can achieve a smaller total.\n\n<<<210>>>"
