No, free-standing boron nanosheets would generally not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The most stable and common phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, meaning they possess a center of inversion. This symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC, as the material's second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero.
