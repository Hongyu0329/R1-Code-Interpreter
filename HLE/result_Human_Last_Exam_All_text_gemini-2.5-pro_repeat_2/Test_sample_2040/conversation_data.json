    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core physical process: Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)\n\nSPDC is a nonlinear optical process where one photon of higher energy (the pump photon, frequency ω_p) spontaneously splits into two photons of lower energy (the signal photon, ω_s, and the idler photon, ω_i) inside a nonlinear medium. This process must conserve both energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** ω_p = ω_s + ω_i\n*   **Momentum Conservation (Phase Matching):** **k**_p = **k**_s + **k**_i\n\nThe crucial point is that SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical process**. The efficiency of this process is governed by the material's second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as **χ⁽²⁾**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the material requirement for a second-order nonlinear process\n\nA fundamental principle in nonlinear optics is that the second-order susceptibility, χ⁽²⁾, is a third-rank tensor that describes the material's response. A key selection rule based on crystal symmetry dictates the following:\n\n*   For a material to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, its crystal structure **must lack a center of inversion** (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n*   If a material possesses a center of inversion (it is centrosymmetric), its χ⁽²⁾ is identically zero due to symmetry constraints.\n\nTherefore, the question \"would free-standing boron nanosheets be expected to exhibit SPDC?\" boils down to the question: **\"Are free-standing boron nanosheets centrosymmetric?\"**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the crystal structure and symmetry of boron nanosheets (borophene)\n\nUnlike graphene, which has a single stable honeycomb lattice, elemental boron is electron-deficient, leading to a phenomenon called polymorphism. This means boron nanosheets, or borophene, can exist in many different atomic structures. We must examine the symmetry of the most stable and experimentally relevant phases.\n\n*   **Common Phases:** The most widely studied borophene phases, both theoretically predicted to be stable and experimentally synthesized (typically on a silver substrate), include the **β₁₂** sheet and the **χ₃** sheet. Other observed structures include various \"striped\" phases.\n*   **Symmetry of β₁₂ and χ₃ Phases:** Both the flat β₁₂ phase and the buckled χ₃ phase belong to the orthorhombic crystal system with the space group *Pmmn* (No. 59).\n*   **Checking for Inversion Symmetry:** A space group's properties determine if it has a center of inversion. The point group associated with the *Pmmn* space group is *mmm* (or D₂h in Schoenflies notation). This point group contains a center of inversion as one of its symmetry elements.\n*   **Conclusion on Symmetry:** The most common and stable phases of borophene are **centrosymmetric**.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the analysis to answer the question\n\n1.  SPDC requires a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, χ⁽²⁾.\n2.  A non-zero χ⁽²⁾ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n3.  The most stable and common phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Therefore, their intrinsic χ⁽²⁾ is zero.\n\nBased on this, ideal, defect-free, free-standing boron nanosheets in their common structural phases are **not expected** to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion through the dominant χ⁽²⁾ mechanism.\n\n### Careful Points and Nuances\n\n*   **Comparison to other 2D materials:** This is in contrast to materials like monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) or monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g., MoS₂), which are non-centrosymmetric and thus have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, making them candidates for SPDC. Graphene, like borophene, is centrosymmetric and does not exhibit SPDC.\n*   **Symmetry Breaking:** While the intrinsic material is centrosymmetric, inversion symmetry could be broken by external factors like a strong applied electric field, interaction with a substrate, or the introduction of specific defects or strain gradients. These effects could induce a weak SPDC response, but this is not an intrinsic property of the \"free-standing\" sheet itself.\n*   **Higher-Order Effects:** Extremely weak SPDC could theoretically occur via electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole interactions, which are not forbidden in centrosymmetric materials. However, these effects are several orders of magnitude weaker than the standard electric dipole (χ⁽²⁾) process and are not what is generally meant when discussing SPDC.\n\nGiven that the question asks what would be \"expected\" for a \"free-standing\" sheet, the answer should be based on the intrinsic properties of its most stable forms.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would generally not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The most stable and common phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, meaning they possess a center of inversion. This symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC, as the material's second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero.>>>"
