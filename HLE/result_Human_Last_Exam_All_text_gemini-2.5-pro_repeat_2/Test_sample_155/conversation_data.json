    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the encoded word.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the input**\n\nThe question presents a block of characters within a `\\begin{verbatim}` environment in a LaTeX document. This environment preserves all characters, spaces, and line breaks exactly as they are typed. This tells us that the specific layout of the 't' and 'b' characters, including the spaces, is crucial to solving the puzzle.\n\nThe characters are arranged in a way that suggests they form larger shapes, likely letters. We can see three distinct horizontal groups, separated by spaces on lines 1, 7, and 13.\n\n- Line 1: `(t b b)` `(t t t t)` `(b b b)`\n- Line 7: `(t b t t)` `(b b b b b b)`\n- Line 13: `(b b)` `(t t t t)` `(b t b b)`\n\nAdditionally, there are lines with single characters. Their horizontal position indicates which of the three letters they belong to.\n\n- Lines 2-6 contain characters at the beginning of the line, corresponding to the first letter.\n- Lines 8-12 contain characters at the end of the line, corresponding to the third letter.\n- There are no single-character lines for the middle letter.\n\nThis analysis allows us to break down the puzzle into three separate letters, which are formed from these component parts.\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruct and identify the first letter**\n\nThe components for the first letter are:\n- From line 1 (top bar): `t b b`\n- From lines 2-6 (left vertical stem): `b`, `b`, `b`, `t`, `b`\n- From line 7 (middle bar): `t b t t`\n- From line 13 (bottom bar): `b b`\n\nLet's assume both 't' and 'b' represent \"ink\" and visualize the shape by arranging these parts. The single characters form a vertical line, and the character groups form horizontal bars, all aligned on the left.\n\n```\nt b b      ->  ###\nb          ->  #\nb          ->  #\nb          ->  #\nt          ->  #\nb          ->  #\nt b t t    ->  ####\nb b        ->  ##\n```\nAssembling these parts creates a clear representation of the capital letter **E**.\n\n**Step 3: Reconstruct and identify the second letter**\n\nThe components for the second letter are found in the middle of lines 1, 7, and 13:\n- From line 1 (top bar): `t t t t`\n- From line 7 (middle part): `b b b b b b`\n- From line 13 (bottom bar): `t t t t`\n\nThis letter has no separate vertical stem parts. The `b b b b b b` part in the middle must represent the main body or stem. The `t t t t` parts at the top and bottom represent serifs.\n- Top serif: `####`\n- Vertical Stem: A solid line formed by the `b`'s.\n- Bottom serif: `####`\nThis structure clearly forms a serifed capital letter **I**.\n\n**Step 4: Reconstruct and identify the third letter**\n\nThe components for the third letter are at the end of the lines:\n- From line 1 (top bar): `b b b`\n- From lines 8-12 (right vertical stem): `b`, `b`, `t`, `t`, `b`\n- From line 13 (bottom bar): `b t b b`\n\nLet's visualize this letter. It has a vertical stem on the right, with top and bottom bars connected to it, and it's open on the left.\n```\n  b b b    ->    ###\n      b    ->      #\n      b    ->      #\n      t    ->      #\n      t    ->      #\n      b    ->      #\nb t b b    ->  ####\n```\nThis shape is a capital letter **C**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the letters to form the word**\n\nBy decoding each shape from left to right, we get the sequence of letters: E, I, C.\nThe resulting string is \"EIC\". This is not a common English word. However, the question asks for a \"word\". In many puzzles of this nature, when the decoded letters do not form a word, the final step is to find an anagram.\n\nThe letters E, I, and C can be rearranged to form the common English word **ICE**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n1.  The encoded image consists of three letters.\n2.  The first letter is **E**.\n3.  The second letter is **I**.\n4.  The third letter is **C**.\n5.  The letters in order are E, I, C. Anagramming these letters gives the word ICE.\n\n<<<ICE>>>"
