    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nAn equilibrium point of the differential equation $x'(t) = f(x(t))$ is a value of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. In this problem, the differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to find the roots of $f(x) = 0$.\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nFirst, we can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term in the parenthesis is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor equal to zero:\n1.  $-x = 0 \\implies x = 0$\n2.  $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x-1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n\nThus, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x_c$, we can analyze the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at that point.\nThe function is $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. Its derivative is:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$**:\n    We evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=0$:\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$**:\n    We evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=1$:\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method to analyze the stability at $x=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Alternative stability analysis for $x=1$**\n\nWe can analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the vicinity of $x=1$.\n*   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 + \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$):\n    $f(1+\\epsilon) = -(1+\\epsilon)((1+\\epsilon)-1)^2 = -(1+\\epsilon)\\epsilon^2$. Since $1+\\epsilon > 0$ and $\\epsilon^2 > 0$, $f(1+\\epsilon)$ is negative. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ decreases towards 1.\n*   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$ and assuming $x>0$):\n    $f(1-\\epsilon) = -(1-\\epsilon)((1-\\epsilon)-1)^2 = -(1-\\epsilon)(-\\epsilon)^2 = -(1-\\epsilon)\\epsilon^2$. Since $1-\\epsilon > 0$ and $\\epsilon^2 > 0$, $f(1-\\epsilon)$ is negative. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from 1.\n\nSince solutions starting slightly below $x=1$ move away from it, the point $x=1$ is not stable. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium point.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   An equilibrium point is considered **stable** (or more specifically, asymptotically stable) only if solutions starting from any nearby point on *both sides* converge to it.\n*   Since $x=1$ does not satisfy this condition (solutions from the left move away), it is not a stable equilibrium point.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of stable equilibrium points ($m$)**\n\nBased on our analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point: $x=0$.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression**\n\nThe question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ we found:\n$$ m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
