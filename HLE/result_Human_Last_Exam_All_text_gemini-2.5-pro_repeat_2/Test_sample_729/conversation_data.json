    "An analysis of the question to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group and the question**\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{4n}$):** The generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **The specific group ($Q_{128}$):** We are given the group of size 128. So, we set $4n=128$, which implies $n=32$. The group is:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **Elements of $Q_{128}$:** The elements can be uniquely written in the form $x^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$ or $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i < 64$. This gives a total of $64 + 64 = 128$ elements.\n*   **\"Power Subgroup\":** A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup. A subgroup $H$ is a power subgroup if there exists an element $g$ in the group such that $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ (the subgroup generated by $g$).\n*   **The Goal:** The question asks for the total number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n**Step 2: Partition the problem**\n\nTo find all cyclic subgroups, we can consider the subgroups generated by each element of $Q_{128}$. We can classify the elements into two disjoint types:\n1.  Elements of the form $x^i$.\n2.  Elements of the form $x^i y$.\n\nWe will count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by each type of element and then sum the results, after ensuring there is no overlap.\n\n**Step 3: Count cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $x^i$**\n\n*   The elements of the form $x^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$ form a cyclic subgroup of $Q_{128}$, namely $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   The order of this subgroup is the order of the element $x$, which is 64.\n*   Any cyclic subgroup generated by an element of the form $x^i$ will be a subgroup of $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   A fundamental theorem in group theory states that the number of distinct subgroups of a cyclic group of order $N$ is equal to the number of divisors of $N$, denoted by $\\tau(N)$.\n*   In our case, $N=64$. We need to find the number of divisors of 64.\n*   The prime factorization of 64 is $2^6$.\n*   The divisors are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6$. These are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\n*   The number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1=7$.\n*   So, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $x^i$. These are $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ for each divisor $d$ of 64.\n\n**Step 4: Count cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $x^i y$**\n\n*   Let's consider an element $g = x^i y$. We first need to determine its order.\n    *   $g^2 = (x^i y)(x^i y) = x^i (y x^i y^{-1}) y^2$.\n    *   Using the relation $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}$, we get $yx=x^{-1}y$. By induction, $yx^i = x^{-i}y$.\n    *   So, $g^2 = x^i (x^{-i}y)y = x^i x^{-i} y^2 = y^2$.\n    *   From the group presentation, $y^2 = x^{32}$. So, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\n    *   Since $x^{32} \\neq 1$ (its order is 2), the order of $g$ is not 2.\n    *   $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   Thus, every element of the form $x^i y$ has order 4.\n*   There are 64 such elements, and each generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4. We need to find how many of these subgroups are distinct.\n*   Let $H = \\langle g \\rangle = \\langle x^i y \\rangle$. A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4)=2$ generators. The generators of $H$ are $g$ and $g^3$.\n    *   $g^3 = g \\cdot g^2 = (x^i y) x^{32}$.\n    *   The element $x^{32}$ is the unique element of order 2 in $Q_{128}$ and lies in the center of the group, so it commutes with all elements.\n    *   $g^3 = x^i x^{32} y = x^{i+32} y$.\n*   So, the two generators of $\\langle x^i y \\rangle$ are $x^i y$ and $x^{i+32} y$. This means that $\\langle x^i y \\rangle = \\langle x^{i+32} y \\rangle$.\n*   The 64 elements of the form $x^i y$ come in pairs, $\\{x^i y, x^{i+32} y\\}$, where both elements in a pair generate the same subgroup.\n*   The number of distinct subgroups is the total number of such elements divided by the number of generators per subgroup: $64 / 2 = 32$.\n*   So, there are **32** distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $x^i y$.\n\n**Step 5: Check for overlaps and find the total count**\n\n*   The first set of 7 subgroups are all contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$. Every element in these subgroups is a power of $x$.\n*   The second set of 32 subgroups are of the form $\\{1, x^{32}, x^i y, x^{i+32} y\\}$. Each of these subgroups contains elements ($x^i y$ and $x^{i+32} y$) that are not powers of $x$.\n*   Therefore, the two sets of subgroups are disjoint.\n*   The total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is the sum of the counts from both cases.\n*   Total number = (Subgroups from powers of $x$) + (Subgroups from elements of the form $x^i y$)\n*   Total number = 7 + 32 = 39."
