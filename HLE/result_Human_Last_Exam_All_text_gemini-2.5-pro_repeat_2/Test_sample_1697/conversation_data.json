    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Starting Material and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   This is a benzene ring with three substituents.\n    *   At position C1, there is an N,N-diethylamide group: -CON(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   At position C3, there is a dimethylamino group: -N(CH₃)₂.\n    *   The remaining positions on the ring (C2, C4, C5, C6) are occupied by hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Reagents for Step 1:** sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium), TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine), and THF (tetrahydrofuran).\n    *   `sec-BuLi` is a very strong organolithium base. It is used to deprotonate weakly acidic C-H bonds.\n    *   `TMEDA` is a chelating agent for the lithium cation (Li⁺). It breaks up the aggregates of sec-BuLi, making it a more powerful base. It also helps to coordinate the lithium ion during the deprotonation step, directing the reaction.\n    *   `THF` is the polar aprotic solvent.\n\n*   **Reagent for Step 2:** Methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n    *   This is an electrophile. The carbon atom is susceptible to nucleophilic attack, and iodide (I⁻) is a good leaving group. It is a source of an electrophilic methyl group (\"CH₃⁺\").\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction (Lithiation)**\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)**, also known as the Snieckus reaction. In a DoM reaction, a functional group on the aromatic ring directs the strong base to deprotonate a proton at one of its ortho positions.\n\n1.  **Identify the Directing Groups (DMGs):** The starting material has two directing groups.\n    *   **-CON(Et)₂ (N,N-diethylamide):** This is a very powerful DMG. It directs lithiation to its ortho positions, C2 and C6.\n    *   **-N(CH₃)₂ (dimethylamino):** This is also a DMG, although weaker than the amide group. It directs lithiation to its ortho positions, C2 and C4.\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Deprotonation:** We need to find the most acidic proton on the ring. The directing groups activate their ortho protons by coordinating with the lithium ion, which brings the base into proximity.\n    *   The proton at **C2** is ortho to *both* the strong -CON(Et)₂ group and the -N(CH₃)₂ group. This is a synergistic or cooperative effect, making the C2 proton exceptionally acidic and the overwhelmingly preferred site for deprotonation. The lithium ion can form a stable six-membered chelate ring with the amide oxygen and the amine nitrogen, further stabilizing the transition state for C2 deprotonation.\n    *   The proton at C4 is ortho only to the weaker -N(CH₃)₂ group.\n    *   The proton at C6 is ortho only to the stronger -CON(Et)₂ group.\n\n    Due to the cooperative effect, sec-BuLi will selectively remove the proton from the C2 position. This forms a new organolithium compound, an aryllithium, which is a potent carbanionic nucleophile.\n\n    *Intermediate:* 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction (Alkylation)**\n\n1.  The aryllithium intermediate formed in Step 1 is a strong nucleophile.\n2.  This nucleophile reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n3.  The carbanion at C2 attacks the methyl carbon of CH₃I in an Sₙ2-type reaction, displacing the iodide ion.\n4.  A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C2 of the benzene ring and the methyl group.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe net result of the two-step sequence is the replacement of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group.\n\n*   Starting material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n*   Final product: A methyl group is added at C2. The name is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** This is a Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM) followed by an electrophilic quench. Recognizing this pattern is key.\n2.  **Synergistic Directing Effect:** The presence of two directing groups meta to each other strongly activates the position between them (C2) for deprotonation. This is a common and powerful strategy in organic synthesis.\n3.  **Role of Reagents:**\n    *   `sec-BuLi` is chosen over `n-BuLi` because it is more basic and less nucleophilic, minimizing the risk of addition to the amide carbonyl group.\n    *   `TMEDA` is crucial for enhancing the reactivity of the base and for stabilizing the lithiated intermediate via chelation.\n4.  **Regioselectivity:** The reaction is highly regioselective. Deprotonation occurs almost exclusively at the C2 position due to the cooperative directing effect. Other positions are much less reactive.\n5.  **Product Naming:** The substituents on the benzene ring are named alphabetically. \"dimethylamino\" comes before \"methyl\". Therefore, the correct name is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  **Start:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n2.  **React with sec-BuLi/TMEDA:** Deprotonation at C2, the position ortho to both the amide and amine groups. An aryllithium is formed at C2.\n3.  **React with CH₃I:** The aryllithium nucleophile attacks the methyl iodide electrophile.\n4.  **Result:** A methyl group is attached to C2.\n5.  **Final Compound:** N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
