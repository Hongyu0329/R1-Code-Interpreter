    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Classical Prisoner's Dilemma:**\n    *   The provided payoff matrix is:\n        *   (Cooperate, Cooperate): (5, 5) -> Reward (R)\n        *   (Cooperate, Defect): (0, 7) -> Sucker (S), Temptation (T)\n        *   (Defect, Cooperate): (7, 0) -> Temptation (T), Sucker (S)\n        *   (Defect, Defect): (1, 1) -> Punishment (P)\n    *   The condition for a Prisoner's Dilemma is T > R > P > S, which holds here (7 > 5 > 1 > 0).\n    *   In the classical version of the game, the dominant strategy for each player is to Defect, regardless of what the other player does.\n    *   This leads to the unique Nash Equilibrium of (Defect, Defect), with a payoff of (1, 1). This is the \"dilemma,\" as both players would be better off if they could trust each other to cooperate, which would yield a (5, 5) payoff.\n\n2.  **Introduce the Quantum Framework (Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein Protocol):**\n    *   **States:** The classical choices \"Cooperate\" (C) and \"Defect\" (D) are represented by quantum basis states, typically |C⟩ = |0⟩ and |D⟩ = |1⟩.\n    *   **Initial State & Entanglement:** The game starts with an initial state |CC⟩ = |00⟩. A quantum entangling operator `J` is applied, creating an entangled state for the two players: `|ψ_i⟩ = J|00⟩`. The question states, \"You design the initial states for an optimal,\" which implies we can choose the degree of entanglement. The optimal choice to resolve the dilemma is maximal entanglement.\n    *   **Strategies:** Players no longer just choose C or D. They choose a quantum strategy, which is a unitary operator (a quantum gate) `U` that they apply to their respective qubit. The classical strategies are a subset of these quantum strategies (e.g., Cooperate is the Identity operator `I`, and Defect is the bit-flip operator `σ_x` or `iσ_y` depending on the convention).\n    *   **Measurement & Payoff:** After players apply their strategies (`U_A` and `U_B`), a disentangling operator `J†` is applied. The final state `|ψ_f⟩ = J†(U_A ⊗ U_B)J|00⟩` is a superposition of the four classical outcomes. The expected payoff for each player is calculated based on the probabilities of measuring each of these outcomes.\n\n3.  **Finding the Equilibrium in the Quantum Game:**\n    *   The goal is to find a Nash Equilibrium in the space of quantum strategies. A Nash Equilibrium is a pair of strategies `(U_A*, U_B*)` where neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n    *   **Optimal Design (Maximal Entanglement):** As established by Eisert et al., the dilemma can be resolved when the initial state is maximally entangled. This corresponds to setting the entanglement parameter `γ = π/2` in the operator `J = exp(iγ/2 * σ_x ⊗ σ_x)`. We will proceed with this optimal setup.\n    *   **Existence of a New Equilibrium:** With maximal entanglement, a new Nash Equilibrium appears that is not available in the classical game. This equilibrium involves both players choosing a specific quantum strategy, often denoted as `Q`. A common representation for this strategy is `Q = iσ_z = [[i, 0], [0, -i]]`.\n    *   **Payoff at the Quantum Equilibrium (Q, Q):** Let's calculate the payoff if both players choose strategy `Q`. The joint strategy is `Q ⊗ Q = (iσ_z) ⊗ (iσ_z) = - (σ_z ⊗ σ_z)`. It can be shown that applying this strategy within the EWL framework with maximal entanglement results in a final state `|ψ_f⟩ = |CC⟩`.\n        *   This means the outcome (Cooperate, Cooperate) occurs with 100% probability.\n        *   The resulting payoff is therefore the reward for cooperation: **(5, 5)**.\n\n4.  **Stability of the Equilibria:**\n    *   We need to confirm that `(Q, Q)` is indeed a stable equilibrium (a Nash Equilibrium). If one player plays `Q`, the other player's best response is also to play `Q`, as any other strategy will result in a payoff less than or equal to 5. The classical strategies `C` and `D`, for instance, would yield a lower payoff against `Q`.\n    *   What about the classical (Defect, Defect) equilibrium? Does it survive? It turns out that for maximal entanglement, the `(D, D)` equilibrium is no longer stable. If player Bob chooses to Defect, player Alice can get a higher payoff by choosing to Cooperate (or another strategy) instead of Defecting. Therefore, `(D, D)` is not a Nash Equilibrium in this optimally designed quantum game.\n    *   This leaves `(Q, Q)` as the **unique Nash Equilibrium**.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   By designing an optimally entangled initial state, we change the game's structure.\n    *   The classical dilemma, where both players are driven to the suboptimal (1, 1) outcome, is eliminated.\n    *   A new, unique, and stable equilibrium point emerges at `(Q, Q)`.\n    *   The payoff at this equilibrium point is **(5, 5)**. Since the question asks for the equilibrium point in a format expecting a single number, this refers to the symmetric payoff received by each player.\n\nThe equilibrium point for the optimally designed quantum prisoner's dilemma is (5, 5). The value for a single player is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
