The edges of the image become smoother over time. The operator causes the edges to move with a velocity proportional to their local curvature. This means that parts of an edge that are convex (bulging out) will recede, and parts that are concave (dented in) will be filled in. As a result, jagged edges are smoothed, and closed convex shapes (like blobs of one color) will continuously shrink until they disappear entirely. The overall process acts to minimize the total length of the boundaries in the image.
