    "This problem asks for the number of syntactically correct boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols that evaluate to True. The available symbols are {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}. The precedence is ! > & > |.\n\nWe can solve this by systematically listing all possible valid expression structures of length 5, and for each structure, counting the number of ways to fill in the operands (T/F) and operators (&/|) such that the expression evaluates to True.\n\nThe analysis can be broken down into two main groups: expressions that do not contain parentheses and expressions that do.\n\n### Group 1: Expressions without Parentheses\n\nThese are strings of 5 symbols that are syntactically valid due to the operator precedence rules.\n\n1.  **`v b v b v`** (where `v` is an operand T/F, `b` is a binary operator &/|)\n    *   `v & v & v`: Evaluates to True only for `T&T&T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `v | v | v`: Evaluates to True for all 7 combinations of T/F except `F|F|F`. (7 expressions)\n    *   `v & v | v` (parsed as `(v&v)|v`): True if the third operand is T (4 combinations), or if the first two are T and the third is F (`T&T|F`) (1 combination). Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n    *   `v | v & v` (parsed as `v|(v&v)`): True if the first operand is T (4 combinations), or if the second and third are T and the first is F (`F|T&T`) (1 combination). Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18**\n\n2.  **`!v b !v`** (parsed as `(!v) b (!v)`)\n    *   `!v & !v`: True only for `!F & !F`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!v | !v`: True for `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, and `!F|!F`. (3 expressions)\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n3.  **`!!v b v`** (parsed as `(!!v) b v`, which is equivalent to `v b v`)\n    *   `!!v & v`: Equivalent to `v&v`, which is true for `T&T` and `F&T` (considering the first `v` is the result of `!!v`). This corresponds to `!!T&T` and `!!F&T`. (2 expressions)\n    *   `!!v | v`: Equivalent to `v|v`, which is true for all 4 combinations. (4 expressions)\n    *   Subtotal: 2 + 4 = **6**\n\n4.  **`v b !!v`** (parsed as `v b (!!v)`)\n    *   Symmetrical to the previous case. (6 expressions)\n\n5.  **`!!!!v`** (parsed as `!(!(!(!v)))`)\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to True. `!!!!F` evaluates to False. (1 expression)\n\nTotal for Group 1: 18 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 1 = **35**\n\n### Group 2: Expressions with Parentheses\n\nThese are strings of 5 symbols that require parentheses for their structure.\n\n1.  **`(A)` where A is a 3-symbol expression**\n    *   `A = v b v`: `(T&T)` is T. `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` are T. (4 expressions)\n    *   `A = (v)`: `((T))` is T. (1 expression)\n    *   `A = !!v`: `(!!T)` is T. (1 expression)\n    *   Subtotal: 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**\n\n2.  **`!(A)` where A is a 3-symbol expression** (needs A to be False)\n    *   `A = v b v`: False for `T&F, F&T, F&F` (3) and `F|F` (1). `!(A)` is T for these 4. (4 expressions)\n    *   `A = (v)`: False for `(F)`. `!((F))` is T. (1 expression)\n    *   `A = !!v`: False for `!!F`. `!(!!F)` is T. (1 expression)\n    *   Subtotal: 4 + 1 + 1 = **6**\n\n3.  **`(!v) b v`**\n    *   `(&)`: `(!F)&T` is T. (1 expression)\n    *   `(|)`: `(!T)|T`, `(!F)|T`, `(!F)|F` are T. (3 expressions)\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n4.  **`v b (!v)`**\n    *   Symmetrical to the previous case. (4 expressions)\n\n5.  **`v b (v)`**\n    *   `(&)`: `T&(T)` is T. (1 expression)\n    *   `(|)`: `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)` are T. (3 expressions)\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n6.  **`(v) b v`**\n    *   Symmetrical to the previous case. (4 expressions)\n\n7.  **`!!(A)` where A is a 2-symbol expression** (A must be `!v` or `(v)`)\n    *   `A = !v`: `!!(!v)`. Needs `!v` to be T, so `v=F`. `!!(!F)` is T. (1 expression)\n    *   `A = (v)`: `!!(v)`. Needs `v` to be T. `!!(T)` is T. (1 expression)\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 1 = **2**\n\n8.  **`!(!v)`** (This is `!(A)` where A is `!v`, length 2. The string is `!(!v)`)\n    *   Needs `!v` to be False, so `v=T`. `!(!T)` is T. (1 expression)\n\nTotal for Group 2: 6 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 = **31**\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nTotal expressions = (Group 1) + (Group 2) = 35 + 31 = 66."
