    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron**\n*   An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces.\n*   It has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n*   A key property of the icosahedron is its high degree of symmetry. Crucially, it has a **center of symmetry** (or point of inversion). This means that for any point on the surface of the icosahedron, the point directly opposite it through the center is also on the surface.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Setup of the Tank**\n*   The tank is in the shape of an icosahedron.\n*   It is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of its 20 triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, for any given face, there is another face on the opposite side that is perfectly parallel to it. Therefore, the tank has a horizontal base and a parallel horizontal top face.\n*   The tank is \"half-filled with water\". This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Water Level**\n*   In a uniform gravitational field, the surface of a static liquid forms a horizontal plane.\n*   The question is to determine the height and shape of this horizontal plane.\n*   Because the icosahedron has a center of symmetry, the horizontal plane that passes exactly through its geometric center will divide the icosahedron into two parts of equal volume.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled, the water level must coincide with this central horizontal plane.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Water Surface**\n*   The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by slicing the icosahedron with this central horizontal plane.\n*   We need to determine the shape of this cross-sectional polygon.\n\n**Step 5: Use Symmetry to Deduce the Shape**\n*   When an icosahedron stands on one of its faces, the vertical line passing through the center of the base and the center of the top face is an axis of **3-fold rotational symmetry**. This means if you rotate the icosahedron by 120° or 240° around this axis, it looks identical.\n*   The water surface is a horizontal plane, which is perpendicular to this 3-fold axis. Therefore, the shape of the water surface must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   As established in Step 3, the water surface passes through the center of the icosahedron. This means the shape also has **central symmetry** (point symmetry).\n*   A 2D shape that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry must be a **regular hexagon**. A shape with 3-fold symmetry could be a triangle, but a triangle does not have central symmetry. A hexagon has both if its vertices are arranged appropriately, and a regular hexagon certainly does.\n\n**Step 6: Confirm with a Geometric Argument**\n*   Let's consider the edges of the icosahedron. The cutting plane of the water surface will create a vertex on the boundary of the water for each edge of the icosahedron it intersects.\n*   The plane is at the \"equator\" of the icosahedron (in this face-down orientation). It separates the 12 vertices of the icosahedron into two groups of 6: 6 vertices in the top half and 6 vertices in the bottom half.\n*   The water surface boundary is formed by cutting the edges that connect a vertex in the top half to a vertex in the bottom half.\n*   In this specific orientation, there is a \"belt\" of 6 such edges that zig-zag around the equator of the icosahedron, connecting 3 vertices just above the central plane to 3 vertices just below it.\n*   The central plane intersects these 6 edges. Since all these edges are symmetrically identical, the plane cuts them all at their midpoints.\n*   These 6 intersection points form the vertices of the water surface. Because of the symmetry of their arrangement, these 6 vertices form a regular hexagon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron. The intersection of this plane with the faces of the icosahedron forms a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
