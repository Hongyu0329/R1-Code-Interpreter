    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Interpret the Notation**\n\nThe question asks for the upper bound of a quantity denoted as $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in terms of the covolume $(V)$ for a specific mathematical setting defined by \"squarefree natural numbers $(N)$\".\n\n*   **Mathematical Setting:** The context of \"covolume\", \"squarefree N\", and a \"norm\" strongly suggests the field of automorphic forms, specifically the study of functions on the quotient space $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$, where $\\mathbb{H}$ is the Poincaré upper half-plane and $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is a congruence subgroup of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   **Maximum Norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$:** This notation is non-standard. In this context, it is almost certainly referring to the maximum norm (or sup-norm) of an automorphic form $\\phi$, defined as $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} = \\sup_{z \\in \\mathbb{H}} |\\phi(z)|$. The form $\\phi$ is assumed to be an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform, which is a fundamental object of study. The subscript 'k' might be an index for the eigenform or related to its spectral parameter, but the question's focus on the covolume implies we are in the \"level aspect\", where the level $N$ grows and the form's eigenvalue is considered fixed.\n*   **Covolume $(V)$:** This is the volume of the space on which the form is defined, $V = \\text{vol}(\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H})$. The volume is computed with respect to the standard hyperbolic measure $d\\mu = y^{-2}dx dy$.\n*   **Squarefree Natural Numbers $(N)$:** This is a crucial arithmetic constraint on the level $N$. This constraint often allows for stronger results than for general $N$ due to a simpler associated arithmetic structure.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Covolume (V) to the Level (N)**\n\nFor the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$, the covolume is given by the formula:\n$V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$.\n\nWhen $N$ is a squarefree integer, this formula applies directly. We need to understand the relationship between $V$ and $N$ as $N \\to \\infty$.\nThe product term $\\prod_{p|N} (1 + 1/p)$ grows very slowly with $N$. By Mertens' theorems, for a typical large $N$, this product behaves like $\\log\\log N$. Therefore, we have the asymptotic relationship:\n$V \\asymp N \\log\\log N$.\n\nThis means that $N$ is roughly proportional to $V / \\log\\log V$. For the purpose of finding an upper bound of the form $O(V^c)$, this relationship implies that a bound of $O(N^c)$ is equivalent to $O(V^c)$, as the slowly growing logarithmic factors can be absorbed into the arbitrary $\\epsilon$ in the exponent of a bound like $O(V^{c+\\epsilon})$.\n\n**Step 3: Survey the State-of-the-Art Results**\n\nThe problem of bounding the sup-norm of Maass forms is a central topic in modern analytic number theory. We are looking for a bound of the form $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^c$ for the smallest possible exponent $c$. Here, the subscript indicates that the implied constant may depend on the form's eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and an arbitrary small positive number $\\epsilon$.\n\n*   **Trivial Bound:** Simple methods give a bound like $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll N^{1/4+\\epsilon}$, which corresponds to an exponent of $c=1/4$.\n*   **Iwaniec-Sarnak (1995):** For prime level $N=p$, they established the first subconvex bound $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{1/6+\\epsilon}$. This corresponds to $c=1/6$.\n*   **Harcos-Templier (2013):** They generalized the $c=1/6$ result to any level $N$.\n*   **Blomer-Milićević (2015):** This is the key result for this specific question. In their paper \"The sup-norm problem for GL(2)\", they proved a significantly stronger bound specifically for **squarefree** levels $N$. Their result (Theorem 1 in their paper) is:\n    $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\epsilon} (1+|t_\\phi|)^{1/2+\\epsilon} N^{-1/12+\\epsilon}$,\n    where $\\lambda = 1/4 + t_\\phi^2$ is the Laplace eigenvalue.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Final Answer**\n\nAssuming the question is in the level aspect (fixed eigenvalue $\\lambda$, so $t_\\phi$ is constant), the Blomer-Milićević bound simplifies to:\n$\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/12+\\epsilon}$.\n\nNow, we translate this bound from being in terms of $N$ to being in terms of the covolume $V$. As established in Step 2, $N^c \\asymp V^c$ for the purposes of such bounds. Therefore, the bound becomes:\n$\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/12+\\epsilon}$.\n\nThis bound states that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a constant $C_{\\lambda, \\epsilon}$ (depending on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and $\\epsilon$) such that $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} \\le C_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/12+\\epsilon}$. This is the current record and represents the best-known upper bound.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The result is specific to **Maass forms**. If the question were about **holomorphic modular forms**, the situation would be different and better understood. For a holomorphic newform $f$ of fixed weight $k$ and squarefree level $N$, the corresponding bound is $\\|y^{k/2} f(z)\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{k, \\epsilon} N^{-1/4+\\epsilon}$, which translates to $V^{-1/4+\\epsilon}$. Given the ambiguity, the Maass form case is the more general and challenging problem, making it the likely subject of the question.\n*   The condition that **$N$ is squarefree** is essential for this improved exponent of $-1/12$. For general $N$, the best-known exponent is $1/6$.\n*   The notation $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/12+\\epsilon}$ is standard asymptotic notation in number theory. It expresses the upper bound on the growth rate of the maximum norm in relation to the covolume.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe upper bound for the maximum norm $\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty}$ of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $\\phi$ with a fixed eigenvalue, in relation to the covolume $V$ of the manifold $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$ for a squarefree natural number $N$, is given by:\n\n$\\|\\phi\\|_{\\infty} = O_{\\lambda, \\epsilon}(V^{-1/12 + \\epsilon})$\n\nThis means that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, the maximum norm is bounded by a constant times $V^{-1/12 + \\epsilon}$, where the constant can depend on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of the form and on $\\epsilon$.\n\n<<<O(V^(-1/12 + epsilon))>>>"
