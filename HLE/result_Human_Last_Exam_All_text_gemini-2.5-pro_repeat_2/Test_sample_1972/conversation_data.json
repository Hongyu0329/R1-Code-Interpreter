    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question provides two key pieces of information, both attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   **Quote 1 (about the novel):** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" This suggests a work that is both fierce and complex, with an intricate structure.\n    *   **Quote 2 (about the author):** He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\" This points to an author whose style shows the influence of William Faulkner (known for complex, non-linear narratives and stream-of-consciousness) but in a more concise or distilled form.\n\n2.  **Identify the Author:**\n    The description of an author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is a specific piece of literary criticism. Borges used this exact phrasing to describe the Mexican writer **Juan Rulfo**. Borges admired how Rulfo managed to achieve a similar depth and narrative complexity as Faulkner but with extreme brevity and starkness.\n\n3.  **Identify the Novel:**\n    Knowing the author is Juan Rulfo, we can now find the specific novel Borges was praising. Rulfo's most acclaimed work is his only novel, *Pedro Páramo*. Borges wrote a famous prologue for a 1970 edition of this book. It is in this very prologue that he uses the first quote. He praises the novel's dense and perfectly crafted structure, stating that it is \"one of the best novels in Hispanic literature, and even in all literature,\" and that its architecture possesses \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    Both clues provided in the question point to the same work. The author described as a simplified continuator of Faulkner is Juan Rulfo, and the novel praised for its tiger-like intensity and chess-like variety is *Pedro Páramo*. The source for both statements is the prologue Borges wrote for the novel.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Source of the Quote:** The quotes are not from a casual remark but from a formal piece of literary criticism—a prologue written by Borges, which lends them significant weight.\n*   **The Faulkner Comparison:** This is a crucial clue. Faulkner's influence on Latin American literature was immense, but Borges's specific framing of Rulfo as a \"simplifier\" is key to distinguishing him from other writers of the Boom period who were also influenced by Faulkner.\n*   **The Metaphor:** The \"tiger\" and \"chess\" metaphor is highly characteristic of Borges. He often used imagery related to labyrinths, mirrors, tigers, and chess to describe complex intellectual or artistic structures. This metaphor perfectly captures the dual nature of *Pedro Páramo*: it is visceral and primal (\"tiger\") yet intellectually rigorous and precisely constructed (\"chess duel\").\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe novel Jorge Luis Borges is referring to is **Pedro Páramo** by the Mexican author **Juan Rulfo**.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
