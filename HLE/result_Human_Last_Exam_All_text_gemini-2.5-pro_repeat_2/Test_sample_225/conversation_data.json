    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the given curve.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of curve**\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nThis is a specific type of curve known as a Lissajous curve. The general form is x(t) = A cos(at) and y(t) = B sin(bt). In this case, A=1, B=1, a=9, and b=5.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the properties of the curve**\nFor a Lissajous curve to be closed (i.e., it retraces its path), the ratio of the frequencies a/b must be a rational number.\nHere, a/b = 9/5, which is rational. The curve is closed.\n\nThe period of the x-component, cos(9t), is T_x = 2π/9.\nThe period of the y-component, sin(5t), is T_y = 2π/5.\nThe overall period of the curve is the least common multiple of T_x and T_y.\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1 / GCD(9, 5)) = 2π / 1 = 2π.\nThe entire curve is traced as t ranges from 0 to 2π. We are looking for self-intersections within this interval.\n\n**Step 3: Check the conditions for the self-intersection formula**\nThere is a well-known formula for the number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve, but certain conditions must be met for it to apply.\n\n*   **Condition 1: Frequencies `a` and `b` must be coprime.**\n    The frequencies are a=9 and b=5. The greatest common divisor, GCD(9, 5) = 1. So, they are coprime. This condition is met.\n\n*   **Condition 2: The curve must not pass through the origin (0,0) multiple times.**\n    The simplest way to satisfy this is if the curve never passes through the origin at all. Let's check this.\n    A point on the curve is at the origin if both x(t)=0 and y(t)=0 for the same value of t.\n    - x(t) = cos(9t) = 0  => 9t = kπ + π/2 = (2k+1)π/2, for some integer k.\n      So, t = (2k+1)π/18.\n    - y(t) = sin(5t) = 0  => 5t = mπ, for some integer m.\n      So, t = mπ/5.\n    For the curve to pass through the origin, there must be a common time t:\n    (2k+1)π/18 = mπ/5\n    5(2k+1) = 18m\n    The left side of the equation, 5(2k+1), is always an odd integer multiplied by 5, so it must be an odd number ending in 5. The right side, 18m, is always an even integer. An odd number cannot equal an even number. Therefore, there are no integer solutions for k and m.\n    This means the curve never passes through the origin (0,0). This condition is met.\n\n*   **Condition 3: The phase shift is appropriate.**\n    The curve is x = cos(9t) = sin(9t + π/2) and y = sin(5t). The phase shift δ is π/2. The formula applies for cases where δ is not a multiple of π that would degenerate the curve into a simple path (like a Chebyshev polynomial). Since δ = π/2, the case is non-degenerate.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the formula for self-intersections**\nFor a Lissajous curve with coprime frequencies `a` and `b` that satisfies the above conditions, the number of self-intersection points (N) is given by the formula:\nN = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer**\nSubstitute the values a=9 and b=5 into the formula:\nN = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nN = (8)(4) / 2\nN = 32 / 2\nN = 16\n\nThe curve has 16 self-intersection points."
