The specific procedures involve a three-phase approach: 1. Emergency management focusing on medical referral for diabetes control, wound debridement, and antibiotic/analgesic prescription. 2. A healing phase of 3-6 months to allow for tissue maturation and glycemic stabilization. 3. Definitive prosthetic rehabilitation. The cells of interest are primarily neutrophils, macrophages, and fibroblasts, whose functions in fighting infection and healing are impaired by diabetes. For a denture replacement, the ideal choice is a **Cobalt-Chromium cast metal removable partial denture** with an acrylic base and teeth. The primary abutment teeth would be the **left central incisor** and the **left second premolar** because they are adjacent to the gap and can provide support. To ensure stability, secondary abutments on the other side, such as the **right canine and right first molar**, must be used for cross-arch stabilization, which prevents rotational forces and makes the denture significantly more secure.
