    "An involution in a group G is an element `g` such that `g^2 = 1` and `g ≠ 1`. We want to find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group `PSU(4, 997)`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the group PSU(4, 997)\nLet `q = 997`. The group `PSU(n, q)` is defined as the quotient group `SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where:\n*   `SU(n, q)` is the special unitary group, which consists of `n x n` matrices `A` with entries in the finite field `F_{q^2}` satisfying `A * A^{T*} = I` (where `A^{T*}` is the conjugate transpose) and `det(A) = 1`.\n*   `Z(SU(n, q))` is the center of `SU(n, q)`. It consists of scalar matrices `cI` that are in `SU(n, q)`. The order of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n\nFor our case, `n = 4` and `q = 997`.\nThe order of the center is `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\nSince `4 = 2^2` and `998 = 2 * 499` (where 499 is a prime number), we have `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nSo, the center `Z(SU(4, 997))` has order 2. It consists of the matrices `{I, -I}`.\nTherefore, `PSU(4, 997) = SU(4, 997) / {I, -I}`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate involutions in PSU to elements in SU\nLet `π: SU(4, q) → PSU(4, q)` be the natural projection map. An element `x ∈ PSU(4, q)` is an involution if `x^2 = 1` and `x ≠ 1`.\nLet `x = π(g)` for some `g ∈ SU(4, q)`.\n*   The condition `x ≠ 1` means `g` is not in the center, so `g ≠ I` and `g ≠ -I`.\n*   The condition `x^2 = 1` means `π(g)^2 = π(g^2) = 1`. This implies `g^2` is in the kernel of `π`, which is the center `{I, -I}`.\nSo, we need to count the elements `g ∈ SU(4, q)` such that `g ∉ {I, -I}` and `g^2 ∈ {I, -I}`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the condition `g^2 ∈ {I, -I}`\n\n**Case 1: `g^2 = -I`**\nLet `g` be a matrix in `U(n, q)`. `g` is diagonalizable over `F_{q^2}`, and its eigenvalues `λ` must satisfy `λ^{q+1} = 1`.\nIf `g^2 = -I`, then the eigenvalues `λ` of `g` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`.\nThis implies `λ^{q+1} = (λ^2)^{(q+1)/2} = (-1)^{(q+1)/2}`.\nFor `g` to be a unitary matrix, we must have `λ^{q+1} = 1`. This requires `(-1)^{(q+1)/2} = 1`, which means `(q+1)/2` must be an even integer.\nLet's check this for `q = 997`:\n`q+1 = 998`\n`(q+1)/2 = 499`\nSince 499 is an odd integer, `(-1)^499 = -1`. This leads to the contradiction `-1 = 1` (as the characteristic is not 2).\nTherefore, there are no matrices `g` in `U(4, 997)` (and thus no matrices in `SU(4, 997)`) such that `g^2 = -I`.\n\n**Case 2: `g^2 = I`**\nWe are looking for elements `g ∈ SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = I` and `g ∉ {I, -I}`.\nAn element `g` with `g^2=I` is diagonalizable with eigenvalues `±1`. Since `det(g) = 1`, the number of `-1` eigenvalues must be even.\n*   If all eigenvalues are `1`, then `g=I`, which is excluded.\n*   If there are two `-1` eigenvalues and two `1` eigenvalues, `g` is a non-central involution. This is the case we need to count.\n*   If all eigenvalues are `-1`, then `g=-I`. Since `n=4` is even, `det(-I) = (-1)^4 = 1`, so `-I` is in `SU(4, q)`. However, `-I` is in the center, so it is excluded by the condition `g ∉ {I, -I}`.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of matrices `g` in `SU(4, q)` whose eigenvalues are `(1, 1, -1, -1)`. These matrices form a single conjugacy class. Let's denote the set of these matrices by `I_1`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the number of such elements (`|I_1|`)\nThe number of such elements is the size of the conjugacy class. The size is given by `|SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU(4, q)}(g)|`, where `g` is a representative of the class.\nAlternatively, the number of involutions in `SU(n, q)` with a `k`-dimensional `(-1)`-eigenspace is the same as the number of such involutions in `U(n, q)` when `k` is even. This number is given by the number of non-degenerate `k`-dimensional subspaces, which is `|U(n,q)| / (|U(k,q)| * |U(n-k,q)|)`.\n\nFor our case, `n=4` and `k=2`:\n`|I_1| = |U(4, q)| / (|U(2, q)| * |U(2, q)|)`.\nThe order of the general unitary group `U(m, q)` is given by the formula:\n`|U(m, q)| = q^{m(m-1)/2} * Π_{i=1 to m} (q^i - (-1)^i)`.\n*   `|U(2, q)| = q^{2(1)/2} * (q - (-1))(q^2 - (-1)^2) = q(q+1)(q^2-1)`.\n*   `|U(4, q)| = q^{4(3)/2} * (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1) = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`.\n\nNow, we compute the quotient:\n`|I_1| = [q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q(q+1)(q^2-1)]^2`\n`|I_1| = [q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q^2(q+1)^2(q^2-1)^2]`\n`|I_1| = q^4 * (q^3+1)(q^4-1) / ((q+1)(q^2-1))`\n`|I_1| = q^4 * (q+1)(q^2-q+1) * (q^2-1)(q^2+1) / ((q+1)(q^2-1))`\n`|I_1| = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997)\nThe involutions in `PSU(4, q)` are the images of the elements in `I_1`.\nEach involution `x = π(g)` corresponds to a coset `{g, -g}`.\nIf `g ∈ I_1`, then `g^2=I` and `g ≠ ±I`. Then `(-g)^2 = g^2 = I` and `-g ≠ ±I`. So `-g` is also in `I_1`. Since the characteristic is not 2, `g ≠ -g`.\nThus, the elements of `I_1` are paired up into `|I_1|/2` distinct cosets. Each coset is a unique involution in `PSU(4, q)`.\nNumber of involutions = `|I_1| / 2 = (q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)) / 2`.\n\n### Step 6: Substitute q = 997\nNow, we substitute `q = 997` into the formula:\nNumber of involutions = `(997^4 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) * (997^2 + 1)) / 2`\nLet's evaluate the terms in the parentheses:\n*   `997^2 + 1 = 994009 + 1 = 994010`\n*   `997^2 - 997 + 1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013`\n\nThe number of involutions is:\n` (997^4 * 993013 * 994010) / 2 `\n` = 997^4 * 993013 * 497005 `\n\nThis is the final numerical expression for the number of involutions.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of involutions is `(q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)) / 2` where `q=997`.\nPlugging in the value of q gives: `(997^4 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) * (997^2 + 1)) / 2 = 997^4 * 993013 * 497005`."
