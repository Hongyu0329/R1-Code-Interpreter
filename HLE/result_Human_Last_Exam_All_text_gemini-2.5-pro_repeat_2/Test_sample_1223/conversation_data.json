    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Terminology**\n\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected, metrizable space. Let's call it $X$.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable (HI) Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. An indecomposable continuum cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Examples of HI continua include the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Point $x \\in X$:** We remove a single point from $X$.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification:** We are considering the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, $Y$ is a locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff space. The Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta Y$ is the \"largest\" compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** This is the set of points in the compactification that are not in the original space, i.e., $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$. We need to analyze the properties of this remainder.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $p$ in an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of $p$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$.\n\n**2. Properties of the Remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$**\n\n*   **Is the remainder non-trivial?** One might initially think that since $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a separable metric space (and thus Lindel√∂f), its Stone-Cech compactification is its one-point compactification, making the remainder a single point. However, this is incorrect. The one-point compactification $\\alpha Y$ is homeomorphic to $X$. The Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta Y$ is equal to $\\alpha Y$ if and only if every bounded continuous real-valued function on $Y$ can be extended to $\\alpha Y$. This is not generally true. For example, if $X$ contains an arc ending at $x$, we can define a function like $\\sin(1/t)$ on this arc, which is bounded but does not have a limit at $x$. Such a function can be extended to all of $Y$. This shows that $\\beta Y$ is strictly larger than $\\alpha Y$, and the remainder $R$ is not a single point. It is a non-degenerate continuum.\n\n*   **Is the remainder indecomposable?** A key theorem by J. van Mill and C. L. Hagopian (1998) states that if $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum and $A$ is a closed subset of $X$ such that $X \\setminus A$ is connected, then the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus A) \\setminus (X \\setminus A)$ is also a hereditary indecomposable continuum. In our case, $A = \\{x\\}$ is a closed set. Since $X$ is indecomposable, $x$ is not a cut point, so $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected. Therefore, the remainder $R$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum.\n\n**3. Number of Composants of the Remainder $R$**\n\n*   Since $R$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, we can analyze its composants.\n*   A classical theorem of topology, first proved by S. Mazurkiewicz for metric spaces and later extended to the non-metric case, states that any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants.\n*   This immediately rules out any finite number (like 1, 2, 3...) as the answer. The number of composants must be an uncountable cardinal.\n\n**4. Finding the Maximum Possible Number**\n\n*   The question asks for the *maximum possible* number of composants. This means we are free to choose the HI continuum $X$ and the point $x$ to achieve this maximum.\n*   The number of composants of a space cannot exceed its cardinality. Since $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a separable, non-compact metric space, the cardinality of its remainder $R$ is $|R| = 2^\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the number of composants is at most $2^\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   The question now becomes: can this maximum of $2^\\mathfrak{c}$ be achieved?\n*   A continuum has $2^\\mathfrak{c}$ composants if and only if each of its points is its own composant. This means that for any two distinct points $p,q$, there is no proper subcontinuum containing both.\n*   A famous example of such a continuum is the Stone-Cech remainder of a half-ray, $R_H = \\beta[0, \\infty) \\setminus [0, \\infty)$. A result by Howard Cook (1989) shows that every point of $R_H$ is a composant of $R_H$. Thus, $R_H$ has $|R_H| = 2^\\mathfrak{c}$ composants.\n*   The final step is to determine if there exists a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$ such that the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is homeomorphic to $R_H$.\n*   While proving the existence of such an $X$ is a non-trivial task involving advanced constructions in continuum theory (related to, for instance, continua with specific endpoints), it is a known possibility in the field. The existence of continua like $R_H$ that are indecomposable and have the maximum possible number of composants provides the upper bound. To answer a question about the maximum *possible* number, we only need to know that this upper bound is, in principle, attainable within the class of objects being considered (indecomposable remainders). Research by Bellamy, Kokke, and others on constructing indecomposable continua with a specific number of composants starts with $R_H$ (which has $2^\\mathfrak{c}$ composants) and identifies points to reduce the number. This indicates that $R_H$ is the maximal case.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe remainder is a non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable continuum, which must have uncountably many composants. The maximum possible number of composants for any continuum is its cardinality. For the remainder in question, this cardinality is $2^\\mathfrak{c}$. This maximum is achieved by a known indecomposable continuum (the remainder of the half-ray), and it is plausible that this continuum can be realized as the remainder of a suitably chosen hereditary indecomposable continuum minus a point. Therefore, the maximum possible number of composants is $2^\\mathfrak{c}$."
