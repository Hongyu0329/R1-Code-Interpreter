    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian who meets several criteria:\n1.  **Is a Christian theologian:** The figure must be known primarily for their work in Christian theology.\n2.  **Developed specialized terminology:** They didn't just discuss the concepts, but created a specific set of terms or a systematic vocabulary to describe them.\n3.  **The terminology describes changes in the laws of nature:** The concepts must address how the regular, predictable functioning of the natural world can be altered or superseded.\n4.  **This terminology is applicable to two specific cases:**\n    *   The virgin birth of Jesus (a specific, one-time miracle).\n    *   Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall (a systemic, ongoing change to the natural order).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Theological Problems**\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** This is a miracle that appears to violate a fundamental biological law. A theologian would need to explain how God can act in such a way without being arbitrary or making nature's laws meaningless.\n*   **The Fall:** The idea that the Fall of Adam and Eve had cosmological consequences (introducing death, disease, predation, natural disasters, etc.) requires a framework for how the very \"laws of nature\" could have been different in a pre-Fallen state and were subsequently changed by a moral event.\n\nThe key challenge is finding a single conceptual framework with its own *terminology* that can coherently explain both a singular, unique event and a systemic, universal change.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Potential Candidates**\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (13th century):** Aquinas distinguished between God's \"ordinary power\" (*potentia ordinata*), by which He upholds the laws of nature He established, and His \"absolute power\" (*potentia absoluta*), by which He can do anything that is not a logical contradiction. A miracle like the virgin birth would be an act of God's absolute power. A change at the Fall could be seen as God using His absolute power to institute a new \"ordinary\" power/set of laws. While this is a powerful system, Aquinas built upon earlier thought and may not be the *first* to develop such a concept.\n*   **C.S. Lewis (20th century):** In his book *Miracles*, Lewis argues that a miracle is not a violation of nature but an *addition* to it by God, the \"author of the book.\" Nature then accommodates this new fact and continues according to its laws. This explains the virgin birth (God provides the miraculous conception, and natural pregnancy follows) but is less suited to explaining a systemic change in all of natural law at the Fall. He did not develop a specific, novel terminology in the same way an early Church Father or Scholastic would have.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (4th-5th century):** Augustine is the strongest candidate. He developed a highly influential and specific theological framework to address exactly these kinds of problems.\n\n**Step 4: Focus on Augustine's Terminology and its Application**\n1.  **The Specialized Terminology:** Augustine's key concept is ***rationes seminales***, which translates to **\"seminal reasons\"** or **\"causal principles.\"** Influenced by Stoic philosophy, he proposed that at the initial moment of creation, God did not create everything in its final form. Instead, He embedded these latent, invisible \"seeds\" or \"potentials\" for everything that would ever come into being within the fabric of the created world. The normal operation of nature is the gradual, orderly unfolding of these pre-ordained potentials.\n\n2.  **Application to the Virgin Birth:** According to this framework, a miracle is not God violating the laws of nature. Instead, it is God directly activating a *ratio seminalis* that would not have otherwise unfolded in the normal course of events. The virgin birth, therefore, was not contrary to the nature God created, but only contrary to the *usual experience* of that nature. God had embedded the potential for this unique event from the beginning and brought it to fruition at the chosen time.\n\n3.  **Application to the Fall:** The *rationes seminales* framework can also explain a systemic change in nature. The pre-Fall world operated according to the unfolding of potentials for a harmonious and incorruptible existence. Human sin did not force God to haphazardly curse the world, but rather it triggered or \"activated\" other latent seminal reasons for decay, death, hardship, and toil (e.g., \"thorns and thistles\") that were already present as possibilities within creation. Thus, the laws of nature changed because the set of active potentials within nature changed as a direct consequence of the Fall.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAugustine of Hippo was the first major Christian theologian to develop a specific, technical vocabulary—the doctrine of *rationes seminales*—that provides a single, coherent mechanism to explain both unique miracles like the virgin birth and systemic alterations to the laws of nature, such as those believed to have occurred at the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
