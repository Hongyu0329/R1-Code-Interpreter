    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.**\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population parameter that quantifies the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (a trait like height or disease risk) that can be explained by the additive effects of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered in a study (typically common SNPs across the genome). It represents the *theoretical upper limit* or the ceiling of how much variance can be predicted using a linear model of these SNPs, assuming we knew the true effect size of every single SNP.\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS) or Polygenic Risk Score (PRS):** This is a practical tool used to predict an individual's phenotype. It is a single number calculated by summing up an individual's genotypes at many SNPs, with each SNP's contribution weighted by its *estimated* effect size.\n\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This is measured by how well the PGS predicts the actual phenotype in a new set of individuals (a target or testing sample). It is typically quantified as the R-squared (R²), which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the crucial difference between SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability.**\n\nThe most critical distinction is between **true effect sizes** and **estimated effect sizes**.\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP)** is based on the concept of *true*, unknown effect sizes for all SNPs. It's the maximum possible R² you could get from the perfect predictor.\n*   **A Polygenic Score (PGS)** is constructed using *estimated* effect sizes. These estimates are derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) which is conducted on a finite sample of people.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the implications of using estimated effect sizes.**\n\nBecause a GWAS is performed on a finite sample, the effect size estimates will inevitably have some degree of statistical error or \"noise.\" They are not the true, precise values. This imperfection has several consequences that limit the predictive power of the resulting PGS:\n\n1.  **Estimation Error:** The estimated weights are not perfectly accurate, which degrades the performance of the PGS compared to a hypothetical score using the true weights.\n2.  **Winner's Curse:** SNPs that are selected for inclusion in a PGS (e.g., because their p-value passes a certain threshold) are likely to have their effect sizes overestimated in the discovery GWAS. When applied to a new sample, their predictive contribution will be less than anticipated.\n3.  **Incomplete Information:** Not all causal SNPs may be included, and those that are included may not be the causal variants themselves but rather SNPs in close physical proximity (in linkage disequilibrium) that act as imperfect proxies.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the analysis to reach a conclusion.**\n\nSNP heritability (h²_SNP) defines the theoretical maximum predictive power of a linear SNP-based model. A polygenic score (PGS) is a practical attempt to build such a model. Because the PGS is built with imperfect information (i.e., estimated, noisy effect sizes from a finite GWAS sample), its predictive ability (R²_PGS) in a new sample will necessarily be lower than the theoretical maximum (h²_SNP).\n\nThe predictive power of a PGS can get closer to the SNP heritability as the size and quality of the training GWAS increase (leading to more accurate effect size estimates), but it can only reach this ceiling in the hypothetical limit of an infinitely large training sample. In any real-world application, there will be a gap.\n\nTherefore, the statement is correct.\n\n<<<True>>>"
