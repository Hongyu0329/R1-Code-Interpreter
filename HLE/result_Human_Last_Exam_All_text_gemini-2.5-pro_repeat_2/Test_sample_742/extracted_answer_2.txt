No. It is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and the logical system of Gödel's ontological proof are two distinct, incommensurable formal systems. The mathematics of quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces, operators, Schrödinger equation) is designed to model the behavior of physical systems and lacks the axiomatic foundations and conceptual tools (such as "positive properties" or "necessary existence" as defined in modal logic) required to formulate, let alone prove, the claims of Gödel's metaphysical argument.
