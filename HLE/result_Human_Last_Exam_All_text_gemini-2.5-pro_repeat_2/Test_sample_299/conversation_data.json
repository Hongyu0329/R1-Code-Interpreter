    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Initial Properties of the function `f`**\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = e^x$. We need to find the cardinality of $S$, denoted as $|S|$.\n\n*   **Injectivity:** First, we show that any function $f \\in S$ must be injective (one-to-one).\n    Suppose $f(a) = f(b)$ for some $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(a)) = f(f(b))$.\n    Using the given equation, this means $e^a = e^b$.\n    Since the exponential function $g(x) = e^x$ is strictly increasing, it is injective. Thus, $a = b$.\n    Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n*   **Monotonicity:** A well-known theorem in real analysis states that any continuous and injective function defined on an interval (in this case, $\\mathbb{R}$) must be strictly monotonic.\n    Therefore, any $f \\in S$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**2. Case 1: `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing function.\n*   The composition of two strictly decreasing functions is a strictly increasing function. So, $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. The function $e^x$ is strictly increasing, so this is consistent.\n*   Since $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function, its range is all of $\\mathbb{R}$. This is because $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$ (or vice versa, but since the domain is all of $\\mathbb{R}$, the range must be all of $\\mathbb{R}$).\n*   Consider the function $g(x) = f(x) - x$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $g(x) \\to -\\infty - \\infty = -\\infty$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $g(x) \\to \\infty - (-\\infty) = \\infty$.\n*   Since $g(x)$ is continuous and its limits at $\\pm\\infty$ have opposite signs, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(p)=0$. This means $f(p) = p$. Such a point is called a fixed point of $f$.\n*   Let's see the consequence of this fixed point. If $f(p)=p$, then we can apply $f$ again: $f(f(p)) = f(p) = p$.\n*   From the original equation, we have $f(f(p)) = e^p$.\n*   This leads to the equation $p = e^p$. However, the function $h(x) = e^x - x$ has a global minimum at $x=0$, where $h(0)=1$. Thus, $e^x - x \\ge 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which means $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n*   The equation $p = e^p$ has no real solutions. This is a contradiction.\n*   Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions satisfying the given equation.\n\n**3. Case 2: `f` is strictly increasing**\n\nNow we only need to consider strictly increasing functions.\n*   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent with $e^x$.\n*   Let's analyze the behavior of $f$ at infinity. As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(f(x)) = e^x \\to \\infty$. Since $f$ is increasing, this implies that we must have $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n*   Now consider the limit as $x \\to -\\infty$. We have $f(f(x)) = e^x \\to 0$.\n    Let $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = M$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $M$ is the infimum of the range of $f$. $M$ can be finite or $-\\infty$.\n    If $M = -\\infty$, then $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = -\\infty$. This contradicts the fact that the limit is 0.\n    So, $M$ must be a finite real number.\n*   We have $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to M^+} f(y) = 0$. Since $f$ is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, this implies $f(M) = 0$.\n*   We can also show that $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If we assume $f(x_0) \\le x_0$ for some $x_0$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x_0)) \\le f(x_0) \\le x_0$. But $f(f(x_0)) = e^{x_0}$, and we know $e^{x_0} > x_0$. This is a contradiction. Thus, $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.\n*   Applying this to $x=M$, we have $f(M) > M$, which means $0 > M$. This is consistent.\n\n**4. Construction of Solutions and Cardinality**\n\nThe analysis above shows that any solution $f$ must be strictly increasing, and there must exist a unique $M < 0$ such that $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = M$ and $f(M) = 0$.\nThis suggests a method for constructing solutions:\n1.  Choose any real number $M < 0$.\n2.  Define a function $h$ on the interval $[M, 0]$. From $f(M)=0$ and $f(0) = f(f(M)) = e^M$, this function $h$ must be a strictly increasing continuous function mapping $[M, 0]$ to $[0, e^M]$, i.e., $h(M)=0$ and $h(0)=e^M$.\n3.  For any such choice of $(M, h)$, we can extend the definition of $f$ to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the relation $f(f(x))=e^x$. For example, for $x \\in [0, e^M]$, $f(x)$ can be defined as $f(x) = e^{h^{-1}(x)}$. This process can be continued to define $f$ on $[M, \\infty)$ and then on $(-\\infty, M)$. Each choice of $(M, h)$ generates a unique solution.\n\nNow, we count how many such solutions exist.\n*   **Counting the choices for M:** The value of $M$ can be any number in the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$. The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum, $c = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n*   **Counting the choices for h:** For a fixed $M<0$, we need to count the number of strictly increasing continuous functions $h: [M, 0] \\to [0, e^M]$.\n    We can show there are uncountably many such functions. Let's normalize the domain and range to $[0,1]$. Any strictly increasing continuous function $H: [0,1] \\to [0,1]$ with $H(0)=0$ and $H(1)=1$ can be used to define a unique $h$.\n    For example, let $H_0(t) = t$. We can create other functions by adding a \"bump\", e.g., $H(t) = t + \\epsilon t(1-t)$ for small enough $\\epsilon$. For any $\\epsilon \\in (-1, 1)$, $H(t)$ is strictly increasing. Since there are $c$ choices for $\\epsilon$, there are at least $c$ such functions $H$. The set of all such homeomorphisms of $[0,1]$ has cardinality $c$.\n*   **Total Cardinality:** The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for $M$ and the number of choices for $h$ for each $M$. This gives a cardinality of $c \\times c = c$.\n\nFinally, the set $S$ of all solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. The set of all continuous functions $C(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{R})$ has cardinality $c$ because a continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on a dense subset like the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, so $|C(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{R})| = |\\mathbb{R}^{Q}| = c^{\\aleph_0} = c$.\nSince we have shown $|S| \\ge c$ and we know $|S| \\le c$, we can conclude that $|S| = c$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe cardinality of the set of such functions is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $c$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<c>>>"
