    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the components of the question**\n\n*   **C**: A compact Riemann surface of genus `g = 3`. Topologically, it's a surface with 3 \"holes\". Algebraically, it's a smooth projective curve of genus 3.\n*   **X = C^(15)**: The 15th symmetric power of C. An element of `X` is an unordered set of 15 points on `C`, which can be identified with an effective divisor of degree 15 on `C`. `X` is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Néron-Severi Group NS(X)**: The group of algebraic equivalence classes of divisors on `X`. It is a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   **Rank of NS(X)**: This is the rank of the Néron-Severi group, also known as the Picard number of `X`, denoted `ρ(X)`. It is the dimension of the rational vector space `NS(X) ⊗_Z Q`.\n\n**2. Relate the Picard Number of `C^(n)` to the Picard Number of `Jac(C)`**\n\nA fundamental result, due to Beauville and others, connects the Néron-Severi group of the symmetric power of a curve to the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian.\n\n*   Let `C` be a smooth projective curve of genus `g`.\n*   Let `Jac(C)` be its Jacobian variety, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension `g`.\n*   For any integer `n ≥ g - 1`, the Picard number of the n-th symmetric power `C^(n)` is given by the formula:\n    `ρ(C^(n)) = 1 + ρ(Jac(C))`\n\nIn our problem, `g = 3` and `n = 15`. The condition `n ≥ g - 1` becomes `15 ≥ 3 - 1 = 2`, which is satisfied. Therefore, we can use this formula:\n\n`ρ(X) = ρ(C^(15)) = 1 + ρ(Jac(C))`\n\n**3. Rephrase the problem**\n\nThe question now simplifies to finding the smallest and largest possible values for `ρ(Jac(C))`, the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve `C`.\n\n**4. Determine the bounds for `ρ(Jac(C))`**\n\nFor an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g`, its Picard number `ρ(A)` is bounded by its Hodge number `h^(1,1)(A)`.\n*   `1 ≤ ρ(A)` (since `A` is projective, it has at least one ample line bundle).\n*   `ρ(A) ≤ h^(1,1)(A) = g^2`.\n\nFor `Jac(C)`, we have `g = 3`, so the bounds are:\n`1 ≤ ρ(Jac(C)) ≤ 3^2 = 9`.\n\nWe now need to determine if these bounds are sharp, i.e., if there exist genus 3 curves `C` for which `ρ(Jac(C))` is 1 and 9.\n\n**5. Find the Smallest Possible Rank**\n\n*   The smallest possible rank, `ρ(Jac(C)) = 1`, is achieved for a *very general* curve `C`.\n*   A \"very general\" curve is one whose Jacobian has the minimal possible endomorphism ring, `End(Jac(C)) = Z`. In this case, the Néron-Severi group `NS(Jac(C))` is generated solely by the class of the principal polarization, and thus its rank is 1.\n*   The locus of curves in the moduli space `M_3` for which `End(Jac(C))` is larger than `Z` is a proper, countable union of subvarieties. This means that \"most\" curves have `ρ(Jac(C)) = 1`.\n*   Therefore, the minimum possible value is `ρ_min(Jac(C)) = 1`.\n*   Using the formula from Step 2, the smallest possible rank of `NS(X)` is:\n    `ρ_min(X) = 1 + ρ_min(Jac(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n**6. Find the Largest Possible Rank**\n\n*   The largest possible rank, `ρ(Jac(C)) = 9`, is achieved if `Jac(C)` is an abelian variety of CM-type (Complex Multiplication). For such varieties, it is known that every Hodge class of type (1,1) is algebraic, meaning `ρ(Jac(C)) = h^(1,1)(Jac(C)) = g^2`.\n*   We need to ensure that a genus 3 curve `C` exists such that its Jacobian `Jac(C)` has `ρ = 9`. This occurs if `Jac(C)` is isogenous to a product of three elliptic curves with complex multiplication.\n*   Such curves exist. A famous example is the **Klein quartic curve**, defined by the equation `x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0`. This is a smooth plane quartic, so its genus is `g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3`. The Jacobian of the Klein quartic is known to be isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve `E` with `j`-invariant 0 (which has CM by the ring of Eisenstein integers `Z[e^(2πi/3)]`).\n*   For this curve `C`, `ρ(Jac(C)) = 9`.\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible value is `ρ_max(Jac(C)) = 9`.\n*   Using the formula from Step 2, the largest possible rank of `NS(X)` is:\n    `ρ_max(X) = 1 + ρ_max(Jac(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the structure of the Néron-Severi group of the symmetric power of a curve, we have determined that its rank depends directly on the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the curve's Jacobian. By finding the minimum and maximum possible ranks for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, we can determine the corresponding minimum and maximum ranks for `X`.\n\n*   The smallest possible rank of `NS(X)` is **2**.\n*   The largest possible rank of `NS(X)` is **10**.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
