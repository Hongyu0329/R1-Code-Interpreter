    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gyeti.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **Form:** *seh₂gyeti\n*   **Root:** *seh₂g- ('to track, seek out'). The *h₂* is a laryngeal consonant.\n*   **Suffix:** *-ye-, a present tense suffix.\n*   **Ending:** *-ti, the 3rd person singular active indicative ending.\n*   **Meaning:** '(s)he’s giving a sign', 'perceives keenly', 'tracks'.\n\n**2. Development into Proto-Germanic (PGmc.)**\n\nThis stage involves several key sound changes that differentiate Germanic from other Indo-European languages. We will trace the development of the infinitive form, which is the standard citation form for a verb. The PIE present stem *seh₂g-ye- would form a Class I weak verb in Proto-Germanic.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Laryngeal Effect.** The laryngeal *h₂* \"colors\" an adjacent *e* vowel to *a* and then lengthens it before a consonant.\n    *   *seh₂g- > *sah₂g- > *sāg- (This is the pre-Germanic root form).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Grimm's Law.** This is the First Germanic Sound Shift. The voiced velar stop *g is affected.\n    *   PIE *g > PGmc. *k.\n    *   Applying this to our root: *sāg- > *sāk-.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Proto-Germanic Vowel Shift.** The long vowel *ā* from PIE (via the laryngeal) becomes *ō* in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   *sāk- > *sōk-. This is the Proto-Germanic root.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Verb Formation.** The PIE suffix *-ye-* becomes the PGmc. suffix *-ja-* for Class I weak verbs. The infinitive ending is *-aną*.\n    *   Combining the root and endings: *sōk- + -ja- + -aną* = ***sōkijaną**.\n\n**Result for Proto-Germanic: **sōkijaną**\n\n**3. Development into Old Norse (ON)**\n\nWe start with the PGmc. form *sōkijaną*.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: i-Umlaut (i-Mutation).** The *j* in the suffix causes the back vowel *ō* in the root to be fronted.\n    *   *ō* + i/j > *œ̄* (often written *æ* or *ø*).\n    *   *sōkijaną > *sœ̄kijaną\n*   **Careful Point 2: Suffix and Ending Changes.** The medial *-j-* is retained in Old Norse in this position. The infinitive ending *-aną* becomes *-a*.\n    *   *sœ̄kijaną > **sœkja** (modern Icelandic *sækja*).\n\n**Result for Old Norse: sœkja**\n\n**4. Development into Old English (OE)**\n\nWe again start with the PGmc. form *sōkijaną*.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: i-Umlaut.** Similar to Old Norse, the *j* causes the root vowel *ō* to be fronted.\n    *   *ō* + i/j > *œ̄*. This vowel then raises to become *ē*.\n    *   *sōkijaną > *sœ̄kian > *sēkian\n*   **Careful Point 2: Palatalization.** The velar consonant *k* becomes palatalized to an affricate /tʃ/ (written *ċ*) when it comes before a front vowel like the *e* that resulted from umlaut.\n    *   *sēkian > *sēċian\n*   **Careful Point 3: Suffix and Ending Changes.** The medial *-j-* is lost after a long/heavy root syllable in Old English. The infinitive ending *-aną* becomes *-an*.\n    *   *sēċian > **sēċan** (pronounced roughly \"say-chan\"; modern English 'seek').\n\n**Result for Old English: sēċan**\n\n**5. Development into Old High German (OHG)**\n\nWe start with the PGmc. form *sōkijaną*.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: OHG Vowel Shift.** PGmc. long *ō* becomes the diphthong *uo* in Old High German.\n    *   *sōkijaną > *suokijan\n*   **Careful Point 2: Second Germanic (High German) Sound Shift.** The voiceless stop *k* is affected. After a vowel, it becomes a voiceless fricative /x/ (written *ch* or *hh*).\n    *   *suokijan > *suochian\n*   **Careful Point 3: Ending Changes.** The medial *-j-* is often written as *-i-*, and the infinitive ending *-aną* becomes *-an*. The combination of *-ian* often becomes a geminated (doubled) consonant with an *-en* ending.\n    *   *suochian > **suohhen** (or **suochen**). (Modern German *suchen*).\n*   **Careful Point 4: i-Umlaut.** i-Umlaut also occurs in OHG (*uo* > *üe*), but it is often not represented in the spelling of Class I weak verbs in the earliest texts. The form *suohhen* is the standard citation form.\n\n**Result for Old High German: suohhen**\n\n### Final Answer\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sōkijaną\n*   **Old Norse:** sœkja\n*   **Old English:** sēċan\n*   **Old High German:** suohhen\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sœkja; Old English: sēċan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
