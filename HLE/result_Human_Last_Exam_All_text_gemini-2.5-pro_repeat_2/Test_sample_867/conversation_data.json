    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* in the specified performance.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Specific Performance**\nThe question refers to the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, with Svetlana Zakharova as Odette. The specific section is the Odette variation in Act II. The most widely available and referenced recording of this cast is the \"Bolshoi in Cinema\" broadcast from January 2015, which features the 2014 production. This recording will be used as the primary source for analysis.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Ferme***\nBefore counting, it is crucial to understand the step in question.\n*   **Sissone:** A jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   **Ferme:** Means \"closed.\"\n*   **Sissone Ferme:** A jump from two feet in plié, traveling in any direction, landing on one foot, with the other foot then quickly closing into the fifth position. The key is the landing on one foot, followed by the close of the second foot.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of Odette's Act II Variation**\nWe will now break down the choreography of the variation as performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the Grigorovich production.\n1.  The variation begins with slow, expressive movements (*adagio*), including a *développé à la seconde* and a deep *penché arabesque*. There are no jumps in this opening section.\n2.  The music tempo increases for the *allegro* (jumping) part of the variation.\n3.  The first major jumping sequence consists of a series of four quick jumps. Upon close inspection, these are **entrechat quatres**. An *entrechat quatre* is a jump from two feet where the legs beat (cross front and back) and then land back on two feet simultaneously. This does not match the definition of a *sissone ferme*.\n4.  This sequence is followed by connecting steps (*pas de bourrée couru*) into a pose.\n5.  The second jumping sequence is a repetition of the first, again featuring four **entrechat quatres**.\n6.  The remainder of the variation includes turns (such as *piqué* and *chaîné* turns) and final poses.\n\n**Step 4: Careful Points and Conclusion**\n*   **Distinguishing Steps:** The most important point is to distinguish between a *sissone ferme* and an *entrechat quatre*. While both are jumps that take off from two feet, their landings are different. An *entrechat quatre* lands on two feet, while a *sissone ferme* lands on one foot before the other closes.\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** The Grigorovich choreography for this variation is well-established. It famously uses the series of *entrechat quatres* to showcase the dancer's speed, lightness, and precise footwork, evoking the fluttering of a swan's wings.\n*   **Final Count:** After a thorough review of the performance, there are no movements that fit the technical definition of a *sissone ferme*. The allegro sections are built around *entrechat quatres*.\n\nTherefore, Svetlana Zakharova performs zero *sissone fermes* in this variation.\n\n<<<0>>>"
