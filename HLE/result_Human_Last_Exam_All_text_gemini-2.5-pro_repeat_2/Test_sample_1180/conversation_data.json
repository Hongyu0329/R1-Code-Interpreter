    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C$ defined by $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$ above 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Curve and the Problem\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve.\nThe genus of a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = P(x)$ where $P$ has degree $d$ is $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor$. Here, $d=5$, so the genus is $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"thickness of the double point\" of the stable reduction over the 2-adic field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, with the valuation $v$ normalized such that $v(2)=1$.\n\nThe \"stable reduction\" of a curve is a specific type of model over the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ whose special fiber (the reduction modulo 2) is a stable curve. A stable curve is a connected curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points. The arithmetic genus of the stable fiber must equal the genus of the generic fiber.\n\nThe \"thickness\" of a double point in this context typically refers to the intersection multiplicity of the components of the special fiber of a regular model that are contracted to form the double point in the stable model. A more direct interpretation in many cases is the number of nodes that satisfy the arithmetic genus formula for the stable fiber.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Reduction Type using the Newton Polygon\nTo understand the structure of the stable reduction, we analyze the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is done using the Newton polygon.\n\nIt is more convenient to work with a monic polynomial. Let $g(x) = f(x)/2 = x^5 + x^3 + 1/2$. The roots of $g(x)$ are the same as the roots of $f(x)$. The coefficients of $g(x)$ are $a_5=1, a_4=0, a_3=1, a_2=0, a_1=0, a_0=1/2$. Their 2-adic valuations are:\n*   $v(a_5) = v(1) = 0$\n*   $v(a_3) = v(1) = 0$\n*   $v(a_0) = v(1/2) = -1$\n\nThe Newton polygon is constructed from the lower convex hull of the points $(i, v(a_i))$. We plot the points corresponding to non-zero coefficients:\n*   $(5, v(a_5)) = (5, 0)$\n*   $(3, v(a_3)) = (3, 0)$\n*   $(0, v(a_0)) = (0, -1)$\n\nThe lower convex hull consists of two line segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0, -1)$ to $(3, 0)$. The horizontal length is $3-0=3$. The slope is $m_1 = \\frac{0 - (-1)}{3 - 0} = 1/3$.\n2.  A segment from $(3, 0)$ to $(5, 0)$. The horizontal length is $5-3=2$. The slope is $m_2 = \\frac{0 - 0}{5 - 3} = 0$.\n\nThe valuations of the roots are given by the negatives of the slopes. This implies:\n*   There are 3 roots of $f(x)$ with 2-adic valuation $-m_1 = -1/3$.\n*   There are 2 roots of $f(x)$ with 2-adic valuation $-m_2 = 0$.\n\nThis means the five ramification points of the curve $C$ over the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1_x$ are split into two distinct clusters according to the magnitude of their 2-adic valuation.\n\n### Step 3: Deduce the Structure of the Stable Fiber\nThe splitting of the roots into two clusters strongly suggests that the stable reduction of the curve $C$ will decompose into two main components. The factorization of the Newton polygon corresponds to a factorization of the polynomial $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ into $f(x) = F_1(x)F_2(x)$, where $F_1(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3 whose roots have valuation $-1/3$, and $F_2(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2 whose roots have valuation $0$.\n\nThe stable model of the curve $C: z^2 = F_1(x)F_2(x)$ is composed of the stable models of two simpler curves:\n*   $C_1: y_1^2 = F_1(x)$, which has degree 3 and thus genus $g_1 = \\lfloor(3-1)/2\\rfloor = 1$.\n*   $C_2: y_2^2 = F_2(x)$, which has degree 2 and thus genus $g_2 = \\lfloor(2-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$.\n\nThe stable fiber of the model for $C$, let's call it $\\mathcal{C}_s$, will be a connected curve whose components are related to the stable reductions of $C_1$ and $C_2$. Let us assume the stable fiber consists of two components, $\\mathcal{C}_{1,s}$ (an elliptic curve, since $g_1=1$) and $\\mathcal{C}_{2,s}$ (a rational curve, i.e., $\\mathbb{P}^1$, since $g_2=0$).\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Formula for Arithmetic Genus\nThe arithmetic genus of the stable fiber must equal the genus of the original curve $C$. The formula for the arithmetic genus $p_a$ of a curve composed of two components intersecting at $\\delta$ ordinary double points is:\n$p_a(\\mathcal{C}_s) = p_a(\\mathcal{C}_{1,s}) + p_a(\\mathcal{C}_{2,s}) + \\delta - 1$\n\nWe have:\n*   The genus of the original curve: $g = 2$, so $p_a(\\mathcal{C}_s) = 2$.\n*   The genus of the first component: $p_a(\\mathcal{C}_{1,s}) = g_1 = 1$.\n*   The genus of the second component: $p_a(\\mathcal{C}_{2,s}) = g_2 = 0$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$2 = 1 + 0 + \\delta - 1$\n$2 = \\delta$\n\nThis implies that the two components must intersect in a total of $\\delta=2$ ordinary double points.\n\n### Step 5: Interpret the \"Thickness\"\nThe problem asks for the \"thickness of the double point\". The calculation shows that the total number of intersection points (counted with multiplicity) is 2. The use of the singular \"double point\" often implies that the geometric intersection points form a single orbit under the action of the Galois group of the residue field, in this case, $\\text{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_2/\\mathbb{F}_2)$. So, while there might be two intersection points defined over $\\mathbb{F}_4$, they form a single point over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\nThe \"thickness\" of this point is the sum of the intersection multiplicities of the geometric points that constitute it. In this case, the stable model has two ordinary double points, so the total thickness is $1+1=2$.\n\nFinal conclusion: The thickness of the double point(s) in the stable reduction is 2."
