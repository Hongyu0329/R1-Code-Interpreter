    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the most likely mechanism that explains two outcomes for duplicated genes:\n1.  **Retention:** After a gene duplication event, the genome now has two identical copies of a gene. The \"default\" fate for the extra copy is to be lost or become non-functional because it's redundant. Retention means that both copies are kept in the genome over long evolutionary periods.\n2.  **Divergence:** The two retained copies accumulate different mutations over time, causing their sequences and, potentially, their functions to become different from one another.\n\nSo, we are looking for a process that provides a selective advantage to keeping both copies, thus ensuring their retention, and also involves them becoming different from each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In a family of duplicated genes, gene conversion tends to make the copies more similar to each other. This works *against* divergence. Therefore, it cannot be the primary mechanism for both retention and divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicated gene. One of the two copies accumulates deleterious mutations and becomes non-functional (a pseudogene). The other copy maintains the original function. While this leads to divergence (one functional gene, one non-functional sequence), it does not explain the *retention* of two *functional* genes. The question implies the retention of both copies as useful genetic elements.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy retains the original ancestral function, while the second copy is free from selective pressure and accumulates mutations. By chance, one of these mutations may result in a completely new, beneficial function. Natural selection will then act to preserve this new gene. This model successfully explains both **retention** (one gene for the old function, one for the new) and **divergence** (the second gene mutated to gain a new function). This is a plausible mechanism.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) proposes that the original, ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in different tissues/times (i.e., it had a complex regulatory pattern). After duplication, each copy can accumulate mutations that degrade or silence different subfunctions. For instance, copy 1 might lose function A but keep function B, while copy 2 loses function B but keeps function A. Now, both copies are required to carry out the full set of the original gene's functions. This \"complementation\" ensures the **retention** of both copies. The process inherently involves **divergence**, as the two copies accumulate different degenerative mutations.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern, not a mechanism at the level of individual genes. It describes the rapid diversification of a single lineage into multiple species that occupy different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not the mechanism itself that governs the fate of those duplicate genes.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Most Plausible Mechanisms (Neofunctionalization vs. Subfunctionalization)**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the \"most likely\" one.\n\n*   **Likelihood of initiating events:** Neofunctionalization requires a relatively rare event: a mutation that creates a new, beneficial function. Before such a mutation occurs, the duplicate gene is redundant and at high risk of being lost through pseudogenization. In contrast, subfunctionalization relies on relatively common events: loss-of-function mutations in different parts of the gene or its regulatory elements.\n*   **Path to preservation:** Subfunctionalization provides a more immediate and passive route to preserving both gene copies. As soon as each copy has lost a different, complementary subfunction, both become essential and are protected from being lost. This makes it a very robust mechanism for rescuing duplicates from pseudogenization.\n\nBecause the mutational events required for subfunctionalization (degeneration) are far more common than those for neofunctionalization (creation of novel function), many evolutionary biologists argue that subfunctionalization is a more frequent and therefore \"more likely\" mechanism for the initial retention of duplicated genes. It provides a stable state that allows the gene pair to persist, potentially allowing for later neofunctionalization to occur on one of the subfunctionalized copies.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the higher probability of the underlying mutational events, subfunctionalization is considered the most likely general mechanism responsible for the widespread retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
