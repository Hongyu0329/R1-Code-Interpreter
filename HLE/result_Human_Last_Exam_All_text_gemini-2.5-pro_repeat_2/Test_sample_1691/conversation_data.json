    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find an analytical approximation for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe integral to be analyzed is:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nWe are interested in the behavior of this integral for small positive values of $\\epsilon$.\n\n**1. Identify the nature of the problem.**\nThe integral is a function of a small parameter $\\epsilon$. Let the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + g(x)$, where $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{D(x, \\epsilon)}$ becomes very large at points where $g(x)$ is minimal. This type of problem is known as a singular perturbation, and the integral's value for small $\\epsilon$ is typically dominated by the contribution from the region around the minimum of $g(x)$.\n\n**2. Locate the minimum of g(x).**\nWe need to find the minimum of $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$ on the integration interval $[0, 15]$.\nWe can see that $g(0) = 0$. For any $x > 0$ in the interval, all terms are positive, so $g(x) > 0$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $g(x)$ on the interval $[0, 15]$ is 0, and it occurs at $x=0$.\n\n**3. Approximate the integrand near the minimum.**\nSince the main contribution to the integral comes from the neighborhood of $x=0$, we can approximate the function $g(x)$ by its behavior for small $x$. For $x \\approx 0$, the lowest power of $x$ dominates the expression for $g(x)$.\n$g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5$ for small $x$.\nSo, we can approximate the integral as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**4. Adjust the integration limits.**\nThe integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$ is largest when $9x^5$ is comparable to $\\epsilon$, which means $x \\sim (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}$. For small $\\epsilon$, this region is very close to $x=0$. The value of the integrand decreases rapidly as $x$ increases. For example, at the upper limit $x=15$, the denominator is very large, and the contribution to the integral is negligible compared to the contribution from the region near $x=0$.\nThe error introduced by extending the upper limit from 15 to $\\infty$ is of a lower order in the asymptotic expansion for $\\epsilon$. Specifically, the error is approximately $\\int_{15}^\\infty \\frac{dx}{9x^5} = \\frac{1}{9}[-\\frac{1}{4x^4}]_{15}^\\infty = \\frac{1}{36 \\cdot 15^4}$, which is a small constant. The leading term, as we will see, scales with a negative power of $\\epsilon$ and is much larger. Thus, we can write:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**5. Evaluate the approximate integral.**\nWe can solve this integral by a change of variables. Let's make a substitution that simplifies the denominator.\nLet $9x^5 = \\epsilon u$.\nThis implies $x^5 = \\frac{\\epsilon u}{9}$, so $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon u}{9}\\right)^{1/5} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} u^{1/5}$.\nThe differential $dx$ is then:\n$dx = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} u^{1/5 - 1} du = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} u^{-4/5} du$.\nThe limits of integration remain from $0$ to $\\infty$. Substituting these into the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} u^{-4/5} \\right) du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1+u)} \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} u^{-4/5} du$\n\nNow, we can factor out the terms involving $\\epsilon$ and other constants from the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{\\epsilon \\cdot 5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n\n**6. Use the Beta function to evaluate the definite integral.**\nThe remaining integral is a standard integral representation of the Beta function:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{z-1}}{(1+t)^{z+w}} dt = B(z, w) = \\frac{\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(w)}{\\Gamma(z+w)}$\nIn our case, the integral is $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$.\nComparing the exponents, we have $z-1 = -4/5$, which gives $z=1/5$.\nThe denominator is $(1+u)^1$, so $z+w = 1$, which gives $w = 1-z = 1-1/5 = 4/5$.\nThus, the integral is equal to $B(1/5, 4/5)$.\n$B(1/5, 4/5) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/5)\\Gamma(4/5)}{\\Gamma(1/5+4/5)} = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/5)\\Gamma(4/5)}{\\Gamma(1)}$.\nUsing the properties $\\Gamma(1)=1$ and the Euler reflection formula $\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$, we get:\n$B(1/5, 4/5) = \\Gamma(1/5)\\Gamma(1-1/5) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n**7. Formulate the final analytical approximation.**\nSubstituting the value of the integral back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\nThis can be written as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nThis is the leading-order asymptotic approximation for $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Careful Points**\n*   The validity of the approximation rests on $\\epsilon$ being small.\n*   The approximation of $g(x)$ by its leading term $9x^5$ is only valid near $x=0$. However, since the contribution from other regions is negligible for small $\\epsilon$, this is a valid step for finding the leading-order behavior.\n*   Extending the integration limit from 15 to $\\infty$ is justified because the integrand decays quickly, and the error introduced is of a lower order than the dominant term we have calculated.\n*   The use of the Beta and Gamma functions is crucial for the analytical evaluation of the resulting definite integral. The Euler reflection formula provides a neat simplification.\n*   The final formula shows that the integral diverges as $\\epsilon \\to 0$ with a power law of $\\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\nThe final analytical formula is obtained by combining the constant factors and the epsilon-dependent term derived above.\nThe parameters from the problem are the exponent $p=5.0$ and the coefficient $A=9.0$ from the dominant term $Ax^p$. The general formula for this type of integral is $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{p A^{1/p} \\sin(\\pi/p)} \\epsilon^{(1-p)/p}$.\nSubstituting $p=5$ and $A=9$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{(1-5)/5} = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}>>>"
