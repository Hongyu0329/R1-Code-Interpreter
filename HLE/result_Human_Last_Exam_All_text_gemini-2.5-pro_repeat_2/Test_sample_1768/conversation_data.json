    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Problem and Key Information**\nThe question provides a nucleotide sequence and states that it is taken from the *middle* of an Open Reading Frame (ORF). This is the most critical piece of information.\n*   **Open Reading Frame (ORF):** A continuous stretch of codons that does not contain a stop codon. It starts with a start codon and ends with a stop codon.\n*   **\"Middle\" of an ORF:** This implies that the correct reading frame for this sequence will not contain any internal stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).\n*   **Goal:** Find the correct reading frame and translate it into a protein sequence using one-letter amino acid codes.\n\n**2. Identify the Three Possible Reading Frames**\nAny given DNA sequence has three possible forward reading frames, determined by the starting nucleotide.\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide.\n*   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide.\n*   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Frame for Stop Codons**\nWe will now parse the given sequence into codons for each of the three frames and check for the presence of stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). The frame that lacks any stop codons is the correct one.\n\n**Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n*   **Analysis of Frame 1 (starts at base 1):**\n    *   **Codons:** `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc cta ccc caa taa tct taa cag tgt cct ggc tga gcg act gga gaa gtg gc`\n    *   **Check for Stop Codons:** We can immediately see the codon `tag` (a stop codon) at the 5th position. Further on, there are `taa` and `tga` codons as well.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 is not an open reading frame. It is incorrect.\n\n*   **Analysis of Frame 2 (starts at base 2):**\n    *   **Codons:** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (the last base `c` is incomplete).\n    *   **Check for Stop Codons:** Scanning through the list of codons reveals no instances of TAA, TAG, or TGA.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Frame 2 is an open reading frame. This is the correct frame.\n\n*   **Analysis of Frame 3 (starts at base 3):**\n    *   **Codons:** `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga agt ttt caa gct ctt tac cct acc cca ata atc tta aca gtg tcc tgg ctg agc gac tgg aga agt ggc`\n    *   **Check for Stop Codons:** We can see the codon `tga` (a stop codon) at the 8th position.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 is not an open reading frame. It is incorrect.\n\n**4. Translate the Correct Frame (Frame 2) into Protein Sequence**\nNow that we have identified Frame 2 as the correct reading frame, we will translate its codons into the corresponding amino acids using the one-letter code.\n\n*   **Frame 2 Codons:** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n\n### Final Answer\n\n**Frame:** 2\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLALERLEKW>>>"
