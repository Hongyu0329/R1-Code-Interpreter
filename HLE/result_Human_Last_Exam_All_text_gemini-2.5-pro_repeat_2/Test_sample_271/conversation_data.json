    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the polynomial:**\n    Let $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We try to factor this polynomial. By grouping terms, we find:\n    $P(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n    $P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n    $P(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n    So the roots of $P(x)$ are the roots of $Q(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $R(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Galois groups of the factors:**\n    *   For $Q(x) = x^2 - 2$, the roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_Q = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_Q/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n    *   For $R(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we first check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n        *   3 divides the coefficients -9, and 3.\n        *   3 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n        *   $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3.\n        Therefore, $R(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   To find the Galois group of $R(x)$, let's analyze its roots. The degree is 5, which is a prime number. Let's find the number of real roots.\n        $R'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are given by $x^4 = 9/5$, so $x = \\pm (9/5)^{1/4}$.\n        Let $x_0 = (9/5)^{1/4}$.\n        $R(x_0) = x_0^5 - 9x_0 + 3 = x_0(x_0^4 - 9) + 3 = x_0(9/5 - 9) + 3 = -x_0(36/5) + 3$. Since $1 < x_0 < 2$, $R(x_0) < 1(-7.2) + 3 = -4.2 < 0$.\n        $R(-x_0) = (-x_0)^5 - 9(-x_0) + 3 = -x_0^5 + 9x_0 + 3 = -R(x_0) + 6 > 0$.\n        Since the local minimum is negative and the local maximum is positive, $R(x)$ has 3 real roots and therefore 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    *   A theorem in Galois theory states that an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly two non-real roots has the symmetric group $S_p$ as its Galois group. Here $p=5$, so the Galois group of $R(x)$ is $G_R = \\text{Gal}(K_R/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, where $K_R$ is the splitting field of $R(x)$. The order of this group is $|S_5| = 5! = 120$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Galois group of the full polynomial:**\n    The splitting field of $P(x)$ is $K$, which is the compositum of the fields $K_Q$ and $K_R$, i.e., $K = K_Q K_R$.\n    The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_Q:\\mathbb{Q}][K_R:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_Q \\cap K_R : \\mathbb{Q}]}$.\n    We need to determine the intersection $K_Q \\cap K_R = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_R$. The intersection is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so it's either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    If $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subset K_R$, then it must be the unique quadratic subfield of $K_R$. This subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $R(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n    The discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1} a^n)$.\n    For $n=5, a=-9, b=3$:\n    $D = (-1)^{10} (5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 5^5 \\cdot 3^4 - 4^4 \\cdot 9^5 = 3125 \\cdot 81 - 256 \\cdot 59049 = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\n    The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$ is an imaginary quadratic field. $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field. Thus, they cannot be equal.\n    So, $K_Q \\cap K_R = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    This implies that the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n    $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_Q/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_R/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\n    The order of $G$ is $|C_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n4.  **Find the degrees of intermediate normal extensions:**\n    According to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by the index of the subgroup, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G/H|$.\n    We need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$.\n    The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e_2\\}$ and $C_2$.\n    The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e_5\\}$, $A_5$ (the alternating group), and $S_5$.\n\n    The normal subgroups of $G=C_2 \\times S_5$ are:\n    a) **Product subgroups:** Subgroups of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\unlhd C_2$ and $N_2 \\unlhd S_5$.\n    The proper non-trivial ones are:\n    *   $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e_5\\}$. Index: $|G/H_1| = |S_5| = 120$.\n    *   $H_2 = C_2 \\times A_5$. Index: $|G/H_2| = |S_5/A_5| = 2$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e_2\\} \\times A_5$. Index: $|G/H_3| = |C_2 \\times (S_5/A_5)| = |C_2 \\times C_2| = 4$.\n    *   $H_4 = \\{e_2\\} \\times S_5$. Index: $|G/H_4| = |C_2| = 2$.\n\n    b) **\"Diagonal\" subgroups:** A normal subgroup of a direct product is not necessarily a product of normal subgroups. We look for other possibilities. Such a subgroup arises from an isomorphism between quotient groups of the factors. Let $\\phi: C_2/K_1 \\to S_5/K_2$ be an isomorphism, where $K_1 \\unlhd C_2, K_2 \\unlhd S_5$. The orders of the quotients must match.\n    $|C_2/K_1|$ can be 1 or 2.\n    $|S_5/K_2|$ can be 1, 2, or 120.\n    The only non-trivial match is order 2. This requires $K_1 = \\{e_2\\}$ and $K_2 = A_5$.\n    So we have an isomorphism $\\phi: C_2 \\to S_5/A_5$. Let sgn: $S_5 \\to C_2$ be the sign homomorphism (thinking of $C_2$ as $\\{1,-1\\}$). The kernel of sgn is $A_5$.\n    This gives rise to a normal subgroup:\n    *   $H_5 = \\{(c,s) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\text{sgn}(s) = c\\}$. This subgroup is the kernel of the surjective homomorphism $\\psi: C_2 \\times S_5 \\to C_2$ defined by $\\psi(c,s) = c \\cdot (\\text{sgn}(s))^{-1}$. Being a kernel, it is normal.\n    The index of $H_5$ is $|G/H_5| = |\\text{Im}(\\psi)| = |C_2| = 2$.\n\n5.  **List all possible degrees:**\n    The degrees of the normal intermediate fields are the indices we calculated:\n    *   From $H_1$: degree 120.\n    *   From $H_2$: degree 2.\n    *   From $H_3$: degree 4.\n    *   From $H_4$: degree 2.\n    *   From $H_5$: degree 2.\n\n    The set of all possible distinct degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\nFinal list of degrees of normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$:\n*   **Degree 2:** There are three such fields: $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2D})$.\n*   **Degree 4:** One such field: $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{D})$.\n*   **Degree 120:** One such field: $K_R$, the splitting field of $x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\nThe possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
