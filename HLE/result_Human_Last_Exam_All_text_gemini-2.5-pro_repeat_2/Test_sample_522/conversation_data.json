    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Input and Output Format**\nThe inputs and outputs are strings containing comma-separated values. Each comma-separated value can be interpreted as a row in a 2D grid of characters. For example, `Input_A='001111,121111,111111'` can be seen as this grid:\n\n```\nRow 0: 0 0 1 1 1 1\nRow 1: 1 2 1 1 1 1\nRow 2: 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Transformation in Example A**\n\n*   **Input_A Grid:**\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 2 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Output_A Grid:**\n    ```\n    2 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** The character '2' at position (row=1, col=1) has moved. Its original location is now '0'. The character '0' at position (row=0, col=0) has been replaced by the '2'.\n*   **Move Analysis:** The '2' moved from `(1,1)` to `(0,0)`. This is a diagonal move, specifically \"up and left\" by one step. The destination cell `(0,0)` contained a '0' in the input.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Transformation in Example B**\n\n*   **Input_B Grid:** (showing relevant parts)\n    ```\n    ...\n    Row 2: 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0\n    Row 3: 1 1 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ...\n    ```\n*   **Output_B Grid:** (showing relevant parts)\n    ```\n    ...\n    Row 2: 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 0\n    Row 3: 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ...\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** The '2' at position (row=3, col=6) has moved. Its original location is now '0'. The '0' at (row=2, col=7) has been replaced by the '2'.\n*   **Move Analysis:** The '2' moved from `(3,6)` to `(2,7)`. This is also a diagonal move, specifically \"up and right\" by one step. The destination cell `(2,7)` contained a '0' in the input.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Transformation Rule**\nBased on the analysis, we can deduce the following rules:\n1.  Locate the character '2' in the grid.\n2.  The '2' attempts to move to a new cell containing a '0'.\n3.  There is a priority order for the move direction.\n    *   In Example B, the '2' moved \"up-right\".\n    *   In Example A, the '2' moved \"up-left\". Let's check if an \"up-right\" move was possible. From `(1,1)`, an up-right move would go to `(0,2)`. In `Input_A`, the character at `(0,2)` is '1', not '0'. So, the up-right move was not possible, and it tried the next priority move.\n4.  This establishes a priority: **1st: Up-Right, 2nd: Up-Left**. The '2' will take the first available move from this priority list.\n5.  Once a valid move to a '0' cell is found, the '2' moves to the new cell, and its original cell becomes '0'.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Rule to Input_C**\n\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n*   **Input_C Grid:**\n    ```\n    Row 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    Row 1: 0 1 1 1 2 0\n    Row 2: 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Locate '2':** The '2' is at position (row=1, col=4).\n*   **Check Move Priorities:**\n    1.  **Try Up-Right:** The destination would be (row=1-1, col=4+1) = `(0,5)`.\n    2.  **Check Destination:** Is the character at `(0,5)` a '0'? Yes, the character at row 0, col 5 is '0'.\n    3.  **Perform Move:** Since the first priority move is valid, we execute it. The '2' moves from `(1,4)` to `(0,5)`. The character at `(1,4)` becomes '0'.\n*   **Construct the Output Grid:**\n    *   Row 0: The '0' at index 5 becomes '2'. New row: `000002`.\n    *   Row 1: The '2' at index 4 becomes '0'. New row: `011100`.\n    *   Row 2: Remains unchanged: `111111`.\n*   **Final Result:** Combine the new rows with commas.\n\nThe value for MISSING is `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
