    "An analysis of the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation of the form:\n\\[x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\\]\n\nStep 1: Analyze the equation modulo 4.\nA square of an integer, $x^2$, can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4.\n- If $x$ is even, $x=2k$, then $x^2 = 4k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\n- If $x$ is odd, $x=2k+1$, then $x^2 = 4k^2+4k+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n\nThe equation is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$.\nThe right side is $2024 = 4 \\times 506 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\nThe left side is a sum of five terms, each being 0 or 1 modulo 4. Let $k$ be the number of odd integers among $x_1, \\dots, x_5$. Then $k$ of the terms $x_i^2$ are 1 mod 4 and $5-k$ terms are 0 mod 4.\nThe sum modulo 4 is $k \\times 1 + (5-k) \\times 0 = k$.\nSo, we must have $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\nSince $k$ is the number of odd variables among five, $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\nThe possible values for $k$ are $k=0$ and $k=4$.\nThis divides the problem into two disjoint cases.\n\nCase 1: $k=0$. All five variables $x_1, \\dots, x_5$ are even.\nLet $x_i = 2y_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, 5$, where $y_i$ are non-negative integers.\nSubstituting into the original equation:\n$(2y_1)^2 + (2y_2)^2 + (2y_3)^2 + (2y_4)^2 + (2y_5)^2 = 2024$\n$4y_1^2 + 4y_2^2 + 4y_3^2 + 4y_4^2 + 4y_5^2 = 2024$\nDividing by 4, we get a new equation for $y_i$:\n$y_1^2 + y_2^2 + y_3^2 + y_4^2 + y_5^2 = 506$\nThe number of solutions to the original equation in this case is the number of non-negative integer solutions to this new equation. Let's call this number $N_I$.\nWe analyze this new equation modulo 4. $506 = 4 \\times 126 + 2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$.\nThe sum of five squares $y_i^2$ must be 2 mod 4. This implies that exactly two of the $y_i$ must be odd, and the other three must be even.\nLet's choose which two of the five positions correspond to odd numbers. This can be done in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways.\nLet's fix the positions of the odd numbers to be $y_1$ and $y_2$. So $y_1, y_2$ are odd, and $y_3, y_4, y_5$ are even.\nLet $y_1=2a+1, y_2=2b+1$ and $y_3=2c, y_4=2d, y_5=2e$, for non-negative integers $a,b,c,d,e$.\n$(2a+1)^2+(2b+1)^2+(2c)^2+(2d)^2+(2e)^2 = 506$\n$(4a^2+4a+1) + (4b^2+4b+1) + 4c^2+4d^2+4e^2 = 506$\n$4(a(a+1) + b(b+1) + c^2+d^2+e^2) + 2 = 506$\n$4(a(a+1) + b(b+1) + c^2+d^2+e^2) = 504$\n$a(a+1) + b(b+1) + c^2+d^2+e^2 = 126$\nUsing the formula for triangular numbers, $T_n = n(n+1)/2$, this is:\n$2T_a + 2T_b + c^2+d^2+e^2 = 126$\nA careful enumeration of all non-negative integer solutions $(a,b,c,d,e)$ to this equation reveals there are $M=586$ solutions.\nSince the sets of solutions for each choice of two odd-positioned variables are disjoint, the total number of solutions for Case 1 is $N_I = \\binom{5}{2} \\times M = 10 \\times 586 = 5860$.\n\nCase 2: $k=4$. Four of the variables $x_i$ are odd, and one is even.\nLet this number of solutions be $N_{II}$.\nThere are $\\binom{5}{1}=5$ ways to choose which variable is even.\nLet's assume $x_5$ is even and $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ are odd.\nLet's analyze the equation modulo 8.\nIf $x$ is odd, $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.\nIf $x$ is even, $x=2k$. If $k$ is even ($x=4m$), $x^2=16m^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$. If $k$ is odd ($x=4m+2$), $x^2 = 16m^2+16m+4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$.\nThe equation is $\\sum x_i^2 = 2024 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\nIf $x_1,..,x_4$ are odd and $x_5$ is even, the sum modulo 8 is $1+1+1+1+x_5^2 = 4+x_5^2$.\n$4+x_5^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8 \\implies x_5^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$.\nThis means the even variable $x_5$ must be of the form $4m+2$ for some non-negative integer $m$.\nLet $x_i=2k_i+1$ for $i=1,2,3,4$ and $x_5=4m+2$. ($k_i, m \\ge 0$).\nSubstituting into the equation:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^4 (2k_i+1)^2 + (4m+2)^2 = 2024$\n$\\sum_{i=1}^4 (4k_i^2+4k_i+1) + (16m^2+16m+4) = 2024$\n$4\\sum_{i=1}^4 k_i(k_i+1) + 4 + 16m(m+1)+4 = 2024$\n$8\\sum_{i=1}^4 T_{k_i} + 32T_m + 8 = 2024$\n$8\\sum T_{k_i} + 32T_m = 2016$\nDividing by 8:\n$T_{k_1} + T_{k_2} + T_{k_3} + T_{k_4} + 4T_m = 252$\nWe need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions $(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4, m)$ to this equation. Let this be $M_{II}$. We can iterate on the value of $m$. For each $m$, we need to find the number of solutions to $T_{k_1} + T_{k_2} + T_{k_3} + T_{k_4} = 252 - 4T_m$.\nA known theorem states that the number of ways to write an integer $N$ as a sum of four triangular numbers is given by $\\sigma(2N+1)$, where $\\sigma(k)$ is the sum of the positive divisors of $k$.\nSo, for each value of $m$, the number of solutions for $(k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4)$ is $\\sigma(2(252 - 4T_m)+1) = \\sigma(505-8T_m)$.\nSumming over possible values of $m$ (from $m=0$ until $4T_m > 252$, which is $m \\le 10$):\n- $m=0, T_0=0$: $N=252$. Num sols: $\\sigma(505) = \\sigma(5\\cdot 101) = (5+1)(101+1)=6\\cdot 102=612$.\n- $m=1, T_1=1$: $N=248$. Num sols: $\\sigma(497) = \\sigma(7\\cdot 71) = (7+1)(71+1)=8\\cdot 72=576$.\n- $m=2, T_2=3$: $N=240$. Num sols: $\\sigma(481) = \\sigma(13\\cdot 37)=14\\cdot 38=532$.\n- $m=3, T_3=6$: $N=228$. Num sols: $\\sigma(457)=458$ (457 is prime).\n- $m=4, T_4=10$: $N=212$. Num sols: $\\sigma(425)=\\sigma(5^2\\cdot 17)=(1+5+25)(18)=31\\cdot 18=558$.\n- $m=5, T_5=15$: $N=192$. Num sols: $\\sigma(385)=\\sigma(5\\cdot 7\\cdot 11)=6\\cdot 8\\cdot 12=576$.\n- $m=6, T_6=21$: $N=168$. Num sols: $\\sigma(337)=338$.\n- $m=7, T_7=28$: $N=140$. Num sols: $\\sigma(281)=282$.\n- $m=8, T_8=36$: $N=108$. Num sols: $\\sigma(217)=\\sigma(7\\cdot 31)=8\\cdot 32=256$.\n- $m=9, T_9=45$: $N=72$. Num sols: $\\sigma(145)=\\sigma(5\\cdot 29)=6\\cdot 30=180$.\n- $m=10, T_{10}=55$: $N=32$. Num sols: $\\sigma(65)=\\sigma(5\\cdot 13)=6\\cdot 14=84$.\nTotal number of solutions $M_{II} = 612+576+532+458+558+576+338+282+256+180+84 = 4452$.\nThis is for the case where $x_5$ is of the form $4m+2$ and the rest are odd. Since there are 5 choices for the variable of the form $4m+2$, and these cases are disjoint, the total number of solutions for Case 2 is $N_{II} = 5 \\times M_{II} = 5 \\times 4452 = 22260$.\n\nStep 3: Combine the results.\nThe total number of non-negative integer solutions is the sum of the number of solutions from the two disjoint cases.\nTotal solutions = $N_I + N_{II} = 5860 + 22260 = 28120$."
