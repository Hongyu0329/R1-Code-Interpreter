    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Substrate**\nThe substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n*   **Structure:** It's a cyclohexane ring with a bromine atom on carbon 1 (C1) and a methyl group on carbon 2 (C2).\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The (1S,2R) designation tells us the specific 3D arrangement. For adjacent substituents on a cyclohexane ring, this specific combination means the bromine and methyl groups are **cis** to each other (they both point in the same general direction, either up or down, relative to the ring plane).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Most Stable Conformation**\nCyclohexane exists in chair conformations. For a 1,2-cis disubstituted cyclohexane, one substituent must be in an axial position and the other in an equatorial position.\n*   We have two possible chair conformations in equilibrium:\n    1.  **Conformer A:** Bromine is axial, and the methyl group is equatorial.\n    2.  **Conformer B:** Bromine is equatorial, and the methyl group is axial.\n*   Substituents are more stable in the equatorial position to minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions). The methyl group is significantly bulkier than the bromine atom.\n*   Therefore, **Conformer A**, with the larger methyl group in the more stable equatorial position, is the major and most populated conformer at equilibrium. The reaction will primarily proceed from this conformation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reagent and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Requirements of the E2 Mechanism**\n*   The key stereochemical requirement for an E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring is that the leaving group (Br) and the proton being removed (a β-hydrogen) must be **anti-periplanar**. This means they must both be in axial positions and oriented in opposite directions (one up, one down), also known as a **trans-diaxial** arrangement.\n*   In our stable conformer (Conformer A), the bromine atom is in an **axial** position. This is the necessary arrangement for the E2 reaction to occur.\n\n**Step 5: Identify Possible Products (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann)**\nThe base can remove a β-hydrogen from either carbon adjacent to C1, which are C2 and C6.\n*   **Pathway 1 (Elimination towards C2):** This would involve removing the hydrogen from C2. In our stable conformer, the hydrogen on C2 is axial and thus trans-diaxial to the axial bromine. This elimination is possible and would form a double bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   Product: **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is a trisubstituted alkene, which is the more stable product (the **Zaitsev product**).\n*   **Pathway 2 (Elimination towards C6):** This would involve removing a hydrogen from C6. The axial hydrogen on C6 is also trans-diaxial to the axial bromine. This elimination is also possible and would form a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   Product: **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a disubstituted alkene, which is the less stable product (the **Hofmann product**).\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Major Product**\nThe choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann product is determined by the steric bulk of the base.\n*   **Small bases** (like ethoxide, OH⁻) favor the thermodynamically more stable Zaitsev product.\n*   **Bulky bases**, like the potassium tert-butoxide used here, have difficulty accessing the more sterically hindered β-hydrogen (the one on C2, which is near the methyl group). They preferentially attack the more sterically accessible β-hydrogen (the one on C6).\n*   Therefore, the reaction will predominantly follow Pathway 2, leading to the formation of the less substituted alkene.\n\n**Conclusion**\nDue to the use of a bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide), the reaction favors the Hofmann elimination pathway, leading to the formation of the less substituted and less sterically hindered product.\n\nThe major product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
