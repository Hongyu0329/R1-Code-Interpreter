    "An analysis of the question step by step is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of GCRD**\n\nWe are asked to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices:\nP1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nA polynomial matrix G(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if there exists a polynomial matrix Q(s) such that P(s) = Q(s)G(s).\nA polynomial matrix G(s) is a **common right divisor** of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a right divisor of both.\nA common right divisor G(s) is a **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)** if any other common right divisor C(s) is a right divisor of G(s). That is, G(s) = L(s)C(s) for some polynomial matrix L(s).\n\nA key property is that the GCRD is not unique. If G(s) is a GCRD, then U(s)G(s) is also a GCRD, where U(s) is any unimodular matrix (a square polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant). We typically seek a GCRD in a canonical form, such as the row-reduced echelon form.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method**\n\nA standard and effective method for finding the GCRD is to use the Euclidean algorithm, which is implemented through elementary row operations on a composite matrix.\n\n1.  Stack the matrices P1 and P2 to form a single matrix M(s):\n    M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]\n2.  Perform elementary row operations on M(s) to reduce it to a simpler form. The allowed operations are:\n    i.   Swapping two rows.\n    ii.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    iii. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n3.  The set of non-zero rows in the final reduced matrix forms the rows of the GCRD, G(s).\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Execution of the Row Reduction**\n\nLet's form the 4x2 composite matrix M(s):\nM(s) =\n[[s^2 + s, -s],      (Row 1)\n [-s^2 - 1, s^2],     (Row 2)\n [s,       0],       (Row 3)\n [-s - 1,  1]]       (Row 4)\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Before starting a mechanical reduction, it is wise to look for any simple linear dependencies between the rows.\nLet's compare Row 1 and Row 4.\nRow 1 = [s(s+1), -s]\nRow 4 = [-(s+1), 1]\nWe can see that Row 1 = -s * Row 4. This is a polynomial relationship.\n\nThis observation allows for a significant simplification. We perform the operation R1 -> R1 + s*R4:\nR1_new = [s^2+s, -s] + s*[-s-1, 1] = [s^2+s - s^2-s, -s+s] = [0, 0]\n\nThe matrix M(s) is now equivalent (in terms of its row space) to:\nM'(s) =\n[[0,       0],\n [-s^2 - 1, s^2],     (Row 2)\n [s,       0],       (Row 3)\n [-s - 1,  1]]       (Row 4)\n\nNow, we only need to find the GCRD of the remaining three non-zero rows. Let's work with this 3x2 matrix. Let's call its rows R_a, R_b, R_c for clarity.\nR_a = [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\nR_b = [s, 0]\nR_c = [-s - 1, 1]\n\n**Careful Point 2:** To simplify, we can use a row with a constant pivot if possible. Let's try to create one.\nLet's use R_b to simplify R_c. Perform R_c -> R_c + R_b:\nR_c_new = [-s-1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-1, 1]\n\nOur set of rows is now:\n[-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n[s, 0]\n[-1, 1] (let's call this R_d)\n\nNow we have a row R_d with a constant pivot (-1) in the first column. This is very useful for elimination. Let's use R_d to eliminate the first column entry in the other two rows.\n\n1.  Eliminate the first entry of [-s^2 - 1, s^2] using R_d = [-1, 1]. Perform the operation R_a -> R_a - (s^2+1)*R_d:\n    R_a_new = [-s^2-1, s^2] - (s^2+1)*[-1, 1]\n            = [-s^2-1 - (-s^2-1), s^2 - (s^2+1)]\n            = [0, -1]\n\n2.  Eliminate the first entry of [s, 0] using R_d = [-1, 1]. Perform the operation R_b -> R_b + s*R_d:\n    R_b_new = [s, 0] + s*[-1, 1]\n            = [s - s, s]\n            = [0, s]\n\nThe set of rows has been reduced to:\n[0, -1]  (let's call this R_e)\n[0, s]   (let's call this R_f)\n[-1, 1]  (R_d)\n\nNow, we can use R_e = [0, -1] to simplify the other rows.\n1.  Simplify R_f. Perform R_f -> R_f + s*R_e:\n    R_f_new = [0, s] + s*[0, -1] = [0, s-s] = [0, 0]\n2.  Simplify R_d. Perform R_d -> R_d + R_e:\n    R_d_new = [-1, 1] + [0, -1] = [-1, 0]\n\nAfter these operations, the set of non-zero rows is:\n[0, -1]\n[-1, 0]\n\nThese two rows form a basis for the row space of the original matrix M(s). They can be arranged into the GCRD matrix G(s).\nG(s) = [[-1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix. To provide a standard, canonical answer, we can convert G(s) to its row-reduced echelon form.\n1.  Multiply the first row by -1: [-1, 0] -> [1, 0]\n2.  Multiply the second row by -1: [0, -1] -> [0, 1]\n\nThe resulting canonical GCRD is:\nG_canonical(s) = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\nThis is the identity matrix, I. When the GCRD is the identity matrix, the original matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are said to be **right coprime**.\n\nFinal check:\nIs I a common right divisor?\nP1(s) = P1(s) * I\nP2(s) = P2(s) * I\nYes, since P1 and P2 are polynomial matrices, this is true.\nThe Euclidean algorithm we performed guarantees that this is the \"greatest\" common divisor.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the identity matrix.\n\n>>> [[1, 0], [0, 1]]"
