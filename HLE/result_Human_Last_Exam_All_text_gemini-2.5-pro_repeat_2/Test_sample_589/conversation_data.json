    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\n\nThe query asks for a specific scene in a film with four key elements:\n1.  **Actor:** A teenager.\n2.  **Object:** A pink bike.\n3.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike *directly toward* an oncoming car.\n4.  **Production:** A Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Keyword Analysis**\n\nThe most distinctive elements are the \"pink bike\" and the specific action of \"pedaling directly toward an oncoming car.\" This suggests a scene of defiance, horror, or surrealism, rather than a simple accident. Let's consider potential candidates.\n\n*   ***Donnie Darko* (2001):** This is often the first film that comes to mind.\n    *   **Teenager:** Yes, the character Gretchen Ross is a teenager.\n    *   **Pink Bike:** Yes, she has a distinctive pink bike.\n    *   **Major Studio:** No. It was released by Newmarket Films, an independent distributor. This fails a key criterion.\n    *   **Action:** This is the most critical point of failure. Gretchen is hit by a car, but she is not pedaling *directly toward* it as an act of confrontation. The car swerves to avoid Donnie and hits her. The action described in the question does not match the scene.\n\n*   ***It* (2017):** Features a group of teenagers on bikes.\n    *   **Teenager:** Yes, the members of the Losers' Club are teenagers.\n    *   **Pink Bike:** No. The most prominent female cyclist, Beverly Marsh, rides a blue bicycle.\n    *   **Action:** While there are confrontations with a car (driven by Henry Bowers), the scenes involve the kids trying to escape, not pedaling toward the car.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the Specific Action and Visuals**\n\nThe action of a young person on a pedal-powered vehicle riding head-on into the path of an oncoming car is a very strong and specific visual. It is most likely from a horror or fantasy film where reality is distorted. This leads to another strong candidate.\n\n*   ***A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge* (1985):**\n    *   **Production:** The film was produced by New Line Cinema, which was a major and highly successful studio, particularly in the horror genre, and is now a label of Warner Bros. This fits the \"major film studio\" criterion.\n    *   **The Scene:** The film contains a surreal dream sequence where the main character, Jesse, is on a school bus. The scene cuts to his younger sister, Angela.\n    *   **Actor:** Angela is a pre-teen, not technically a \"teenager.\" This is a minor discrepancy, but it's very possible for this detail to be misremembered.\n    *   **Object:** Angela is riding a pink Big Wheel-style tricycle. While not a two-wheeled \"bike,\" it is a pink, pedal-powered vehicle, which strongly matches the visual description.\n    *   **Action:** In the dream, Angela is pedaling her pink tricycle down the middle of a deserted street. An old, menacing car appears and speeds *directly toward her*. She continues to pedal straight into its path. This perfectly matches the specific action described in the question.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nWhile *Donnie Darko* features a teenager and a pink bike, it fails on two critical points: it was not produced by a major studio, and the action described does not occur in the film.\n\n*A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge* matches the key elements almost perfectly. It is a major studio's Hollywood film, and it contains the highly specific and memorable scene of a youth on a pink, pedal-powered vehicle riding directly toward an oncoming car. The minor discrepancies (pre-teen vs. teenager, tricycle vs. bicycle) are likely small misremembered details of a scene that otherwise fits the description exactly.\n\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"
