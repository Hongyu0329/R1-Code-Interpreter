    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**1. Analyzing the Question and Identifying Key Clues (Careful Points):**\n\n*   **Clue 1: The Author:** The quote is attributed to Andrei Voznesensky, a famous Russian poet. This points to a subject of interest in Russian culture and history.\n*   **Clue 2: The Description:** The man is called \"a joy-discovering sailor.\" This suggests he was an explorer, mariner, or someone involved in maritime voyages who was seen in a romantic, adventurous light.\n*   **Clue 3: The Mystery:** The line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" indicates that the man's burial place was lost or unknown for a significant period. This was a historical puzzle.\n*   **Clue 4: The Timeline:** \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" This is the most crucial clue. It means the man's grave was located or identified around that specific time, solving the long-standing mystery.\n*   **The Final Question:** We need to find the last name of this man.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer:**\n\n*   **Step 1:** We start by connecting the author, Andrei Voznesensky, to the quotes. The lines come from his famous poem which served as the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This rock opera is one of the most famous in Russian history.\n*   **Step 2:** The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the historical figure Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. He was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer. He commanded the first Russian circumnavigation of the Earth and was a key figure in the Russian-American Company, attempting to colonize parts of North America. This fits the description of a \"sailor\" or explorer.\n*   **Step 3:** We check if the mystery of his grave applies to Rezanov. On his return journey from Russian America, Rezanov fell ill and died in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk in 1807. He was buried there, but over the decades, the cathedral where he was buried was demolished and the cemetery was lost. For over a century, the exact location of his grave was unknown, fulfilling the line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n*   **Step 4:** We verify the timeline. The immense popularity of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" in the early 1980s created a surge of public interest in Rezanov's life and fate. This led to historical investigations in Krasnoyarsk. In the late 1980s, his presumed burial site was located. A formal, symbolic reburial ceremony and the installation of a new monument took place, effectively \"answering\" the question of where his grave was. This matches the final clue perfectly.\n*   **Step 5:** All clues point to one person: Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe man described by Andrei Voznesensky in the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" is Nikolai Rezanov. His grave was lost in Krasnoyarsk for over 150 years and was rediscovered/re-consecrated in the late 1980s due to renewed interest sparked by the opera.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
