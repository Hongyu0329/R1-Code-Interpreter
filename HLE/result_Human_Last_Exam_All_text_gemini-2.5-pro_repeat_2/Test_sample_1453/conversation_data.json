    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the principles of coiled-coil structure**\n\nA coiled-coil is a protein structural motif where two or more alpha-helices are coiled around each other. The stability and oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, etc.) of a coiled-coil are primarily determined by the amino acid sequence, which follows a repeating pattern of seven residues called a **heptad repeat**, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n*   **Core Positions ('a' and 'd'):** These positions are critical for inter-helical packing. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids (like Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Alanine). The side chains from these positions pack into each other in a \"knobs-into-holes\" fashion, forming the hydrophobic core of the structure.\n*   **Flanking Positions ('e' and 'g'):** These are often occupied by charged or polar residues (like Glutamate, Lysine, Arginine, Glutamine). They flank the hydrophobic core and can form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between the helices.\n*   **Solvent-Exposed Positions ('b', 'c', 'f'):** These positions are on the outside of the coiled-coil, exposed to the solvent, and are usually occupied by hydrophilic residues.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the heptad repeat in the given sequence**\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nTo determine the heptad repeat, we must find the correct \"frame,\" which means assigning the `a, b, c, d, e, f, g` positions to the residues. The most reliable way to do this is to locate the repeating hydrophobic residues that will form the core at positions 'a' and 'd'.\n\nLet's map the positions of the large hydrophobic residues (L, I, W):\n*   L: 7, 14, 21, 28\n*   I: 3, 10, 17, 24\n*   W: 19\n\nNotice that the Leucine (L) residues appear with a perfect periodicity of 7 (7, 14, 21, 28). This strongly suggests that Leucine occupies the same position in every heptad repeat. The Isoleucine (I) residues also appear with a periodicity of 7 (3, 10, 17, 24). This pattern of `I-x-x-x-L` or `L-x-x-I` is the hallmark of a coiled-coil core. The spacing between the `I` at position 3 and the `L` at position 7 is 4 residues, and the spacing between the `L` at position 7 and the `I` at position 10 is 3 residues. This `4, 3` spacing is the signature of residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions (or 'd' and 'a').\n\nLet's test the frame where **Isoleucine (I) is at position 'a'** and **Leucine (L) is at position 'd'**. This requires the heptad repeat to start at the residue in the 'g' position, which would be the residue just before the first 'a' position (I at position 3). So, the repeat starts at E (position 2).\n\nLet's assign the frame `(gabcdef)n`:\nSequence: `G` `E I A Q S L K` | `E I A K S L K` | `E I A W S L K` | `E I A Q S L K` | `G`\nPosition: `cap` `g a b c d e f` | `g a b c d e f` | `g a b c d e f` | `g a b c d e f` | `cap`\n\nLet's extract the residues at the key positions:\n*   **'a' positions:** I, I, I, I\n*   **'d' positions:** L, L, L, L\n*   **'g' positions:** E, E, E, E\n*   **'e' positions:** S, S, S, S (This is incorrect, let's re-align carefully)\n\nLet's try a simpler alignment, starting the sequence at 'g'.\nSequence:  `G E I A Q S L` | `K E I A K S L` | `K E I A W S L` | `K E I A Q S L` | `K G`\nPosition:  `g a b c d e f` | `g a b c d e f` | `g a b c d e f` | `g a b c d e f` | `g a`\n\nLet's check the core positions for this frame:\n*   **'a' positions:** E, E, E, E\n*   **'d' positions:** A, A, A, A\nThis is not chemically plausible, as the highly charged Glutamate (E) would be buried in the hydrophobic core.\n\nLet's try the most likely frame based on the `I...L` pattern.\nThe pattern `I-x-x-L` suggests I is at `a` and L is at `d`.\nLet's assign `I` at position 3 to `a`.\nSequence: `G E` `I A Q S L K E` | `I A K S L K E` | `I A W S L K E` | `I A Q S L K G`\nPosition: `cap` `a b c d e f g`  | `a b c d e f g`  | `a b c d e f g`  | `a b c d e f g`\n\nLet's check the core positions for this frame:\n*   **'a' positions:** I, I, I, I\n*   **'d' positions:** S, S, W, S\nThis is also highly unlikely, as the polar Serine (S) would occupy three of the four 'd' positions in the core.\n\nLet's return to the alignment with the perfect periodicity. `L` is at 7, 14, 21, 28. `I` is at 3, 10, 17, 24.\nThe distance from an `a` position to the next `d` is 3 residues. The distance from a `d` position to the next `a` is 4 residues.\n*   From I(3) to L(7) is 4 residues apart. This means if I(3) is at `d`, L(7) would be at `a`.\n*   From L(7) to I(10) is 3 residues apart. This means if L(7) is at `a`, I(10) would be at `d`.\n\nThis second option seems more consistent. Let's test the frame where **L is at position 'a'** and **I is at position 'd'**.\nThis means L(7) is 'a', K(8) is 'b', E(9) is 'c', I(10) is 'd'.\nSequence: `G E I A Q S` `L K E I A K S` | `L K E I A W S` | `L K E I A Q S` | `L K G`\nPosition:    `cap`     `a b c d e f g`  | `a b c d e f g`  | `a b c d e f g`  | `a b c`\nHere, the third repeat breaks the pattern (`I` is replaced by `W` at the `d` position). This frame is also flawed.\n\nThere must be a simple, consistent frame. Let's reconsider the frame where `a=I, d=L`. This required starting the heptad at E(2). Let's re-verify the `e` and `g` positions for that frame.\nSequence: `G E I A Q S L | K E I A K S L | K E I A W S L | K E I A Q S L | K G`\nLet's assign the frame `g a b c d e f` starting at `G(1)`.\n*   **'a' positions:** E, E, E, E. Incorrect.\n\nLet's try `f g a b c d e` starting at `G(1)`.\nSequence: `G E I A Q S L | K E I A K S L | K E I A W S L | K E I A Q S L | K G`\n*   **'a' positions:** I, I, I, I\n*   **'d' positions:** L, L, L, L\nThis is the frame that fits the `I...L` spacing and has `I` at `a` and `L` at `d`.\nLet's check the other positions for this frame:\n*   'e' positions: K, K, K, K\n*   'g' positions: E, E, E, E\n*   'b' positions: A, A, W, A (Note the Tryptophan)\n*   'c' positions: Q, K, S, Q\n*   'f' positions: S, S, L, S (Note the Leucine)\n\nThis frame is the most chemically sound. It places the large hydrophobes (I, L) in the core (`a`, `d`) and the charged residues (E, K) in the flanking (`g`, `e`) positions, where they can form stabilizing salt bridges. The unusual W and L residues are at solvent-exposed `b` and `f` positions, which is possible.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the core packing (`a=I, d=L`) for oligomeric state**\n\nNow we analyze the oligomeric state based on the identified core pattern: **Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and Leucine (L) at the 'd' positions.**\n\n*   **Knobs-into-Holes Packing:** The bulky side chains at the 'a' and 'd' positions must pack together efficiently. The geometry of this packing determines how many helices can fit together.\n*   **Effect of Isoleucine (I) at 'a':** Isoleucine is a β-branched amino acid (the branching occurs at the second carbon of the side chain). When placed at the 'a' position of a standard parallel **dimer**, the β-branched side chain creates significant steric hindrance (a steric clash), which destabilizes the dimer.\n*   **Effect of Isoleucine (I) at 'a' in Trimers and Tetramers:** The packing geometry in a three-helix or four-helix bundle is different from a dimer. The steric clash caused by the β-branched 'I' at the 'a' position is relieved. In fact, the packing of `a=I` and `d=L` is known to be highly favorable and efficient for a **trimeric** coiled-coil. This specific motif is a well-known signature for proteins that form 3-helix bundles (e.g., matrilin, cartilage matrix protein).\n*   **Comparison with other oligomers:**\n    *   **Dimer:** Disfavored due to steric clash.\n    *   **Tetramer:** While possible (some engineered tetramers use an `I-L` core), it often leads to a very crowded hydrophobic core. The trimeric arrangement is generally considered to have the most optimal packing efficiency for this specific `a=I, d=L` combination in natural proteins.\n    *   **Pentamer and higher:** Unlikely. These structures typically require more complex patterns, often involving alternating polar and hydrophobic residues in the core to manage the larger central cavity.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence analysis strongly indicates a heptad repeat with Isoleucine at the 'a' position and Leucine at the 'd' position. Based on the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing and steric considerations, this `a=I, d=L` motif strongly disfavors dimerization and is a classic hallmark of a **trimeric** coiled-coil, which allows for optimal packing efficiency.\n\nThe predicted oligomeric state is 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
