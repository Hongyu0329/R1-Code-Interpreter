    "Answering this question requires a careful, step-by-step analysis of the definitions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Group G**\nThe group is given as $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is an abelian group under component-wise addition. The identity element of this group is the zero vector, $0 = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding Cyclic Subgroups**\nA cyclic subgroup of $G$ is a subgroup generated by a single element $g \\in G$. We denote it as $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{k \\cdot g \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The set of all cyclic subgroups includes subgroups of various orders. A crucial point is to consider all possible generators.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Condition on the Set A**\nThe question asks for the smallest size of a subset $A \\subset G$ such that for *every* cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, the intersection $A \\cap H$ is non-empty.\nMathematically, we want to find $\\min |A|$ subject to the condition:\nFor all $g \\in G$, $A \\cap \\langle g \\rangle \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n**Step 4: Considering the Trivial Cyclic Subgroup**\nA key point of careful analysis is to remember that the set of \"all cyclic subgroups\" includes the subgroup generated by the identity element.\nLet's consider the identity element $0 \\in G$. The cyclic subgroup generated by $0$ is $\\langle 0 \\rangle = \\{k \\cdot 0 \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\} = \\{0\\}$.\nThis is the trivial subgroup, consisting of only the identity element.\n\nAccording to the condition, the set $A$ must have a non-empty intersection with this subgroup $\\langle 0 \\rangle$.\nSo, we must have $A \\cap \\{0\\} \\neq \\emptyset$.\nThis implies that the identity element $0$ must be an element of $A$.\n\n**Step 5: Determining the Minimum Size of A**\nFrom the previous step, we have concluded that any set $A$ satisfying the given condition must contain the identity element $0$.\nThis means that the size of $A$, denoted by $|A|$, must be at least 1.\nSo, the smallest possible size is at least 1.\n\n**Step 6: Verifying if a Set of Size 1 is Sufficient**\nNow we check if a set of size 1 can satisfy the condition for all cyclic subgroups. Based on our finding, the only candidate for a set of size 1 is $A = \\{0\\}$.\nLet's test this set.\nLet $H$ be an arbitrary cyclic subgroup of $G$. Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, it must, by definition, contain the identity element of $G$. So, $0 \\in H$.\nNow we check the intersection of our test set $A=\\{0\\}$ with this arbitrary cyclic subgroup $H$:\n$A \\cap H = \\{0\\} \\cap H = \\{0\\}$.\nSince the intersection is $\\{0\\}$, it is not empty.\nThis holds true for *every* cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, because every subgroup without exception contains the identity.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\nWe have shown two things:\n1.  The minimum size of $A$ must be at least 1.\n2.  A set of size 1, namely $A=\\{0\\}$, satisfies the condition.\nCombining these two facts, we can conclude that the smallest possible size of the set $A$ is exactly 1.\n\n**A Careful Point on Interpretation:**\nThe specific structure of the group $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$ with its large and composite numbers might suggest a more complex solution is expected. This might lead one to believe that the question implicitly meant to exclude the trivial subgroup (i.e., ask about \"non-trivial cyclic subgroups\"). If that were the case, the answer would be $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$, which is derived by counting the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7. However, based on a literal and rigorous reading of the question as stated, \"every cyclic subgroup\" includes the trivial one. In mathematics, we must follow the precise wording, and the complex group structure serves as a \"red herring\" to distract from the simple, elegant solution based on fundamental group properties.\n\nThe final answer is derived from the literal interpretation.\n\n<<<1>>>"
