    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe problem asks for the sum of probabilities of being in state 0 and state 1 as time goes to infinity, i.e., $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$. These are the limiting or stationary probabilities of a system described by the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations (misspelled as \"Kolmogorov-Chepmen\" in the problem). The system is a continuous-time Markov chain with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}.\n\nLet $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ be the stationary probability of being in state $i$. In the steady state, the probabilities do not change over time, so all derivatives $P_i'(t)$ are equal to zero.\n\n**2. Setting up the Equations for the Stationary Distribution**\nBy setting $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$, we transform the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations for the stationary probabilities $\\pi_i$:\n\n(i) $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n(ii) $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n(iii) $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n(iv) $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n(v) $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$ (This is the normalization condition)\n\n**3. Correcting a Likely Typo in the Equations**\nIn a standard Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the term representing a flow from state $j$ to state $i$ in the equation for $P_i'(t)$ is positive, of the form $+\\lambda_{ji}P_j(t)$. In equation (ii), the term $-\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0}$ corresponds to the flow from state 0 to state 1. This sign should be positive. If we proceed with the negative sign, we find a contradiction (as shown in the \"Careful Points\" section). Therefore, we assume it's a typo and correct the second equation to:\n\n(ii-corrected) $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n\nNote that the sum of the first four corrected equations is zero, indicating that one of them is linearly dependent on the others. This is expected. We will use equations (i), (iii), (iv), and (v) to solve for the probabilities.\n\n**4. Solving the System of Equations**\nWe will express $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_2$, and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n\n*   From equation (i):\n    $\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} = \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1} \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}}\\pi_1$\n\n*   From equation (iii):\n    $(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2} = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} \\implies \\pi_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}}\\pi_1$\n\n*   From equation (iv):\n    $\\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3} = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} \\implies \\pi_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}}\\pi_2$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\pi_2$:\n    $\\pi_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}}\\pi_1 \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})}\\pi_1$\n\n**5. Substituting the Numerical Values**\nThe given values are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nLet's compute the coefficients:\n*   For $\\pi_0$: $\\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}$\n*   For $\\pi_2$: $\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23} = 0.392 + 0.008 = 0.4$. So, $\\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} = \\frac{0.4}{0.4} = 1$. This means $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$.\n*   For $\\pi_3$: $\\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} = \\frac{0.008}{0.008} = 1$. This means $\\pi_3 = \\pi_2$. Since $\\pi_2=\\pi_1$, we also have $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$.\n\nSo we have:\n$\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1$\n$\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$\n$\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$\n\n**6. Using the Normalization Condition**\nSubstitute these relationships into the normalization equation (v):\n$\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**7. Calculating the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\nWe know $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1$.\nSo, $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1\\right)\\pi_1$.\nSubstitute the value of $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.019}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.019}{0.707}\\right)$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Typo Identification**: The name \"Kolmogorov-Chepmen\" is a typo for \"Kolmogorov-Chapman\". More importantly, the sign of the $\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ term in the second equation for $P_1'(t)$ is almost certainly a typo. Standard theory dictates it should be positive. Assuming the given negative sign leads to the equation $2\\lambda_{10}=0$, which contradicts $\\lambda_{10}=0.65$. Thus, the sign must be corrected for a physically and mathematically consistent solution.\n2.  **Stationary State**: The condition $t \\to +\\infty$ implies we are looking for the stationary (or equilibrium/steady-state) distribution of the Markov chain. This simplifies the problem from a system of differential equations to a system of linear algebraic equations.\n3.  **Redundancy and Normalization**: In any such system, one of the rate equations is redundant. It's crucial to use the normalization condition $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$ (which holds for all $t$, including $t \\to +\\infty$) to obtain a unique solution.\n4.  **Calculation Accuracy**: The numerical values given have up to three decimal places. It is important to carry sufficient precision through the calculations to avoid rounding errors. The convenient cancellation of terms (e.g., $\\lambda_{12}/(\\lambda_{21}+\\lambda_{23})=1$) suggests the numbers were chosen deliberately and reinforces the correctness of the approach.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the final answer is the numerical value of the expression $\\frac{0.669}{0.707}$.\n$$ P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = \\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.94625 $$\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
