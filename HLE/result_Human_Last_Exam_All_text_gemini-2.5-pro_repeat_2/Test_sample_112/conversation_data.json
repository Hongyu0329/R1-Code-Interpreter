    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific type of book—a \"book of manners\"—that was physically preserved in the same historical document as the poem \"Sir Launfal\". This means we need to identify the manuscript that contains \"Sir Launfal\" and then examine its other contents.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Manuscript of \"Sir Launfal\"**\nThe version of \"Sir Launfal\" written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century survives in only one original manuscript. Research shows this manuscript is cataloged as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**, which is now held in the British Library.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Contents of the Manuscript**\nThe Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is a miscellany, meaning it is a collection of various different literary works bound together. It contains a number of Middle English romances, including *Sir Launfal*, *Libeaus Desconus*, *Emaré*, and *The Erl of Tolous*, among others.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the \"Book of Manners\" within the Manuscript**\nThe key is to search the list of contents for a work that fits the description of a \"book of manners\" or a courtesy book. These were popular medieval texts that provided instruction on etiquette, courtly behavior, and morals. Among the romances and other poems in Cotton Caligula A.ii, there is a didactic poem on this very subject.\n\n**Step 5: Name the Specific Book**\nThis work is titled **The Boke of Curtasye** (often modernized as \"The Book of Courtesy\"). This text explicitly details the rules of proper conduct for a young man, particularly one serving in a lord's household, covering everything from table manners to moral behavior. It is the \"book of manners\" preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal\" in this important manuscript.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The question is about the physical context of the text, not its literary content.\n*   It's crucial to identify the specific manuscript, as the contents are unique to that collection.\n*   \"Book of manners\" is a specific genre of medieval literature, also known as a \"courtesy book.\"\n*   The Middle English spelling of the title is \"The Boke of Curtasye\".\n\n***\n\nThe final answer is **The Boke of Curtasye** (The Book of Courtesy).\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
