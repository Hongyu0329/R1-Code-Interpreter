    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into its core clues.**\nThe question provides several specific pieces of information to identify a person (\"HE\"):\n*   **Clue 1:** The information is based on \"Veronika Campan's interpretation\". This means we are looking for a figure analyzed by this specific scholar.\n*   **Clue 2:** The context is \"at the end of HIS work\". This points to a final chapter, a last law, or a concluding part of a significant text.\n*   **Clue 3:** The subject at the end of the work is \"the issue of another's material possessions\". This strongly suggests a law or rule related to theft or, more specifically, coveting.\n*   **Clue 4:** A key action is \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\". This implies that the work contains an earlier ban on making images or representations, but this ban is seemingly sidestepped or reinterpreted by the end of the work.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the most concrete clues to identify the \"work\".**\nClues 3 and 4, when combined, are highly indicative of the Ten Commandments (the Decalogue).\n*   The \"prohibition against representation\" directly corresponds to the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath...\"\n*   The rule \"at the end\" of the work addressing \"another's material possessions\" perfectly matches the Tenth Commandment: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.\"\n\n**Step 3: Identify \"HE\" based on the identified \"work\".**\nThe historical and religious figure credited with receiving and delivering the Ten Commandments to the Israelites is Moses. Therefore, \"HE\" is Moses, and \"HIS work\" is the Ten Commandments.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the interpretation with the scholar mentioned.**\nWe must check if Veronika Campan, a psychoanalyst known for her work on law and psychoanalysis, has indeed made this interpretation about Moses and the Ten Commandments.\n*   In her analysis, Campan argues that the Ten Commandments shift from regulating external actions (murder, theft) to regulating internal thought with the final commandment.\n*   To obey the command \"You shall not covet,\" one must first form a *mental representation* of the neighbor's wife, house, and possessions. You have to imagine them to know what you are not supposed to desire.\n*   This act of creating a mental image is necessary to follow the law. In this way, the law itself uses representation to function. This \"naturally ignores\" the absolute, literal interpretation of the Second Commandment's ban on making representations (which was focused on physical idols for worship), by moving the act of representation into the mind as a necessary psychological function.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize all the points to arrive at the final answer.**\nThe figure is a \"HE\" (Moses). His work is the Ten Commandments. The end of the work is the Tenth Commandment, which deals with coveting another's possessions. This final commandment, according to Veronika Campan's psychoanalytic interpretation, requires mental representation, thus \"naturally ignoring\" the earlier prohibition on physical representation found in the Second Commandment. The figure who delivered this work is Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
