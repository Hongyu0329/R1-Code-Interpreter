    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Board and Constraints\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid, where coordinates `(r, c)` have `r` and `c` from `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   **Toroidal:** The board wraps around. This means calculations involving row or column indices are performed modulo 5.\n*   **Non-Attacking Queens:** Four queens are placed on the board such that no two queens can attack each other. On a toroidal board, two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other if any of the following conditions are met:\n    1.  `r1 = r2` (same row)\n    2.  `c1 = c2` (same column)\n    3.  `r1 - c1 ≡ r2 - c2 (mod 5)` (same main diagonal)\n    4.  `r1 + c1 ≡ r2 + c2 (mod 5)` (same anti-diagonal)\n\nThis means that for any set of 4 non-attacking queens at positions `(r_i, c_i)` for `i=1,2,3,4`, the following four sets of values must each contain 4 distinct elements:\n*   The set of rows: `{r1, r2, r3, r4}`\n*   The set of columns: `{c1, c2, c3, c4}`\n*   The set of main diagonal indices: `{r1-c1, r2-c2, r3-c3, r4-c4}` (mod 5)\n*   The set of anti-diagonal indices: `{r1+c1, r2+c2, r3+c3, r4+c4}` (mod 5)\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method for Counting\n\nA direct brute-force check of all `C(25, 4)` placements is too large. A constructive method, building up the solution queen by queen, is feasible but can be complex. A more elegant combinatorial approach is to count incident pairs of `(Solution, Pair of Queens)`.\n\nLet `N` be the total number of ways to place the 4 queens (i.e., the number of valid sets of 4 positions).\n\n### Step 3: Count Tuples of (Solution, Unordered Pair of Queens)\n\nWe will count the number of tuples `(S, P)`, where `S` is a valid solution (a set of 4 queen positions) and `P` is a set of 2 distinct queen positions from `S`.\n\n1.  **Count from the perspective of solutions:**\n    Each solution `S` contains 4 queens. The number of ways to choose a pair of queens from a single solution is `C(4, 2) = 6`.\n    So, the total number of `(S, P)` tuples is `N * 6`.\n\n2.  **Count from the perspective of pairs:**\n    First, we pick a valid, non-attacking, unordered pair of queens `P = {q1, q2}`. Then, we count how many solutions `S` this pair can be extended to. Let this number be `k(P)`.\n    The total number of tuples is the sum of `k(P)` over all possible non-attacking pairs `P`.\n\n    *   **How many non-attacking pairs `P` are there?**\n        *   Choose the first queen `q1`: 25 positions.\n        *   Choose the second queen `q2`. `q1` at `(r,c)` attacks `(5-1)=4` squares in its row, 4 in its column, 4 on its main diagonal, and 4 on its anti-diagonal. Total = 16 attacked squares.\n        *   The number of available squares for `q2` is `25 - 1 (for q1) - 16 = 8`.\n        *   The number of ordered non-attacking pairs `(q1, q2)` is `25 * 8 = 200`.\n        *   Since the pair `P = {q1, q2}` is unordered, we divide by 2: `200 / 2 = 100`. There are 100 non-attacking pairs of queens.\n\n    *   **What is `k(P)`, the number of ways to complete a pair to a solution?**\n        The toroidal board has a high degree of symmetry. The group of symmetries is transitive on squares and also on non-attacking pairs. This means `k(P)` is a constant value `k` for any non-attacking pair `P`.\n        We can calculate `k` by picking a specific pair, for example, `q1 = (0,0)` and `q2 = (1,2)`.\n        `q1=(0,0)` attacks: `r=0, c=0, r-c=0 (mod 5), r+c=0 (mod 5)`\n        `q2=(1,2)` attacks: `r=1, c=2, r-c=1-2=-1=4 (mod 5), r+c=1+2=3 (mod 5)`\n\n        We need to find pairs of positions `{q3, q4}` that are not attacked by `q1` or `q2`, and do not attack each other.\n        A spot `(r,c)` is available if `r∉{0,1}`, `c∉{0,2}`, `r-c∉{0,4}`, and `r+c∉{0,3}`.\n        Let's find the available spots for `q3`:\n        - For `r=2`: `c` must be `4`. -> `(2,4)` is a valid spot.\n        - For `r=3`: `c` must be `1`. -> `(3,1)` is a valid spot.\n        - For `r=4`: `c` must be `3`. -> `(4,3)` is a valid spot.\n        So there are 3 possible positions for `q3`: `(2,4)`, `(3,1)`, and `(4,3)`.\n\n        Now we check which pairs from these 3 spots are non-attacking:\n        - **Pair `{ (2,4), (3,1) }`:**\n          `q_a=(2,4)`: `r-c = -2=3`, `r+c = 6=1`\n          `q_b=(3,1)`: `r-c = 2`, `r+c = 4`\n          This pair is non-attacking. The set `{(0,0), (1,2), (2,4), (3,1)}` is a valid solution.\n        - **Pair `{ (2,4), (4,3) }`:**\n          `q_a=(2,4)`: `r-c=3`, `r+c=1`\n          `q_b=(4,3)`: `r-c=1`, `r+c=2`\n          This pair is non-attacking. The set `{(0,0), (1,2), (2,4), (4,3)}` is a valid solution.\n        - **Pair `{ (3,1), (4,3) }`:**\n          `q_a=(3,1)`: `r-c=2`, `r+c=4`\n          `q_b=(4,3)`: `r-c=1`, `r+c=2`\n          This pair is non-attacking. The set `{(0,0), (1,2), (3,1), (4,3)}` is a valid solution.\n\n        So, for the pair `{(0,0), (1,2)}`, there are `k=3` ways to complete it to a full solution.\n\n    *   **Calculate the total count:**\n        The total number of `(S, P)` tuples is `(Number of pairs) * k = 100 * 3 = 300`.\n\n### Step 4: Solve for N\n\nNow we equate the two ways of counting the tuples:\n`6 * N = 300`\n`N = 300 / 6`\n`N = 50`\n\nThere are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
