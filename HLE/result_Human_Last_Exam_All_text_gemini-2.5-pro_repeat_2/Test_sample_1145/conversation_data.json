    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and the Question**\nThe problem asks for the probability of finding a particle in a specific small interval within a one-dimensional infinite potential well (a \"1D box\").\n*   **System:** Particle in a 1D box of length 'a'. The box extends from x = 0 to x = a.\n*   **State:** The particle is in the second energy level, so the principal quantum number is n = 2.\n*   **Interval:** We need to find the probability of the particle being between x₁ = 0.495a and x₂ = 0.505a.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Relevant Quantum Mechanics Formulas**\nThe probability of finding a particle in a given region is determined by its wavefunction, ψ(x).\n*   **Normalized Wavefunction for a Particle in a 1D Box:**\n    The wavefunction for the n-th state is given by:\n    $ψ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\n*   **Probability Density:**\n    The probability of finding the particle per unit length at position x is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    $P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\n*   **Probability over an Interval:**\n    The probability of finding the particle in the interval from x₁ to x₂ is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    $Prob(x₁ < x < x₂) = \\int_{x₁}^{x₂} P(x) dx = \\int_{x₁}^{x₂} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the Specific Values into the Formulas**\nWe are given n = 2, x₁ = 0.495a, and x₂ = 0.505a.\n*   **Probability Density for n = 2:**\n    $P(x) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\n*   **Probability Integral:**\n    $Prob = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n**Step 4: Choose an Appropriate Method to Evaluate the Integral**\nThe interval of integration, Δx = x₂ - x₁ = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a, is very small. This suggests an approximation might be possible.\n\n*   The center of the interval is x_c = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a.\n*   Let's evaluate the probability density at the center:\n    $P(0.5a) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\pi) = 0$.\n*   Since the probability density is zero at the center of the interval, the simple approximation $Prob ≈ P(x_c) \\times Δx$ would give a result of 0. This is inaccurate because the probability must be a small positive number, not exactly zero.\n*   A better approximation is needed, one that accounts for the curvature of the probability density function around its minimum. We can use a Taylor series expansion of the integrand or a small-angle approximation.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Small-Angle Approximation Method**\nTo simplify the integral, we can make a change of variables to center the integral around zero. Let $u = x - 0.5a$, which means $x = u + 0.5a$ and $dx = du$.\n*   **New limits of integration:**\n    *   When x = 0.495a, u = 0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a\n    *   When x = 0.505a, u = 0.505a - 0.5a = +0.005a\n*   **Substitute into the integral:**\n    $Prob = \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (u + 0.5a)}{a}\\right) du$\n    $Prob = \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a} + \\pi\\right) du$\n*   **Simplify using the trigonometric identity** $\\sin(θ + π) = -\\sin(θ)$:\n    $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a} + \\pi\\right) = \\left(-\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)$\n    The integral becomes:\n    $Prob = \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right) du$\n*   **Apply the small-angle approximation.** The argument of the sine function, $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi u}{a}$, is small over the integration range. For small angles, $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$.\n    $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right) \\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 u^2}{a^2}$\n*   **Substitute the approximation into the integral:**\n    $Prob \\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2 u^2}{a^2}\\right) du = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} u^2 du$\n\n**Step 6: Solve the Approximated Integral**\n*   **Perform the integration:**\n    $\\int u^2 du = \\frac{u^3}{3}$\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a}$\n*   **Evaluate at the limits:**\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 + (0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ 2 \\times (0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n*   **Simplify the expression:**\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\times (0.005)^3 a^3$\n    The $a^3$ terms cancel out.\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\times (0.005)^3$\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n*   **Calculate the final numerical value:**\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{16 \\times (9.8696)}{3} \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n    $Prob \\approx 52.638 \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n    $Prob \\approx 6.5797 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correct State (n):** Ensure you use n=2, not n=1. The wavefunctions and probability distributions are very different. For n=1, the probability is maximum at the center, while for n=2, it is zero (a node).\n2.  **Probability vs. Probability Density:** The question asks for the probability over an interval (a finite number), not the probability density at a point. This requires integration.\n3.  **Approximation Validity:** A simple approximation $P(x_c)Δx$ fails when $P(x_c)=0$. A more sophisticated approximation like a Taylor expansion or a small-angle approximation around the node is necessary.\n4.  **Trigonometric Identities:** Correctly use identities like $\\sin^2(\\theta) = (1-\\cos(2\\theta))/2$ for exact integration, or $\\sin(\\theta+\\pi)=-\\sin(\\theta)$ and $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$ for the approximation method.\n5.  **Units and Cancellation:** The length of the box 'a' should cancel out of the final probability, as probability is a dimensionless quantity. This serves as a good check on the calculation.\n6.  **Radians vs. Degrees:** All trigonometric calculations in physics formulas like this use radians. Ensure your calculator is in radian mode if you compute values directly.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe probability is given by the approximation:\n$Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\times (0.005)^3$\nA cleaner way to write this is:\n$Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{200}\\right)^3 = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3 \\times 8,000,000} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{3 \\times 1,000,000} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{3} \\times 10^{-6}$\n$Prob \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 9.8696044}{3} \\times 10^{-6} \\approx \\frac{19.7392088}{3} \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 6.579736 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the probability is $6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
