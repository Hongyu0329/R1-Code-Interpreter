    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option to determine which ballet step has the same ending leg position as its starting position.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Definition of \"Leg Position\":** In classical ballet, when a step starts and ends in a closed position like the fifth position, the \"position\" includes which foot is in front. \"Same position\" means that if you start with the right foot in front, you must also end with the right foot in front.\n2.  **Precise Terminology:** Each term in the name of a step (like *changé*, *derrière*, *dessus*) is crucial as it describes how the step is executed and how it finishes.\n3.  **Standard Execution:** We will analyze the standard, most common execution of each step as taught in major classical ballet syllabi.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position, typically in a plié. Let's assume the right foot is in front.\n*   **Execution:** An *entrechat* is a vertical jump where the legs beat against each other in the air. The number indicates the number of movements (crossings/openings). An *entrechat six* involves three changes of the legs in the air. Even-numbered entrechats (like *quatre*, *six*, *huit*) are defined by the fact that they land on two feet in the same position they started from.\n*   **Ending Position:** After the three beats in the air, the dancer lands back in fifth position plié with the same foot in front (in this case, the right foot).\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending leg positions are the same.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position plié (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** *Échappé* means to \"escape\"; it's a jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second) and back to closed. *Battu* means a beat is added as the legs close. The word *changé* literally means \"changed.\"\n*   **Ending Position:** Because the step is *changé*, the dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (in this case, the left foot).\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending leg position is different from the starting position.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Can be initiated from various positions, but let's consider a standard *assemblé dessus* (over) from fifth position, with the right foot in the back.\n*   **Execution:** The back foot (right) brushes to the side, the dancer jumps off the supporting (left) leg, and both legs are \"assembled\" in the air and land together in fifth position. In an *assemblé dessus*, the leg that started in the back lands in the front.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the right foot now in front. The configuration of the feet has changed. The same is true for *assemblé dessous* (under).\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending leg position is different from the starting position.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position plié (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** *Glissade* is a gliding step. *Derrière* means \"behind\" and typically describes the closing action. From fifth with the right foot front, the back foot (left) glides to the side, and the starting front foot (right) then closes *behind* the left foot.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the left foot now in front.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending leg position is different from the starting position.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position plié (e.g., right foot front).\n*   **Execution:** This is a decorative jump, like a *pas de chat* but with a *rond de jambe* (circular movement) from each leg. The starting front foot (right) performs a *rond de jambe en l'air en dehors* as the dancer jumps. The other leg (left) then performs a *rond de jambe en l'air en dedans*. The dancer lands on the first leg (right), and the second leg (left) closes behind it.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in fifth position with the same foot in front (right foot).\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending leg positions are the same.\n\n### Final Comparison and Answer\n\nBoth **Entrechat six** and **Gargouillade** end in the same leg position they begin in. In a multiple-choice question, we must select the best possible answer. The property of starting and ending in the same position is a core, defining characteristic of an even-numbered *entrechat*, distinguishing it from odd-numbered ones. For *Gargouillade*, while the standard version does not change feet, a common variant (*gargouillade changée*) does. Therefore, *Entrechat six* is the most definitive and unambiguous example among the choices where the ending and starting positions are identical by definition.\n\n<<<A>>>"
