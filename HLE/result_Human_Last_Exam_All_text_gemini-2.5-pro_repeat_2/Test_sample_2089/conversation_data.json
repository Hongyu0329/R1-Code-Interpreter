    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe core elements of the question are:\n1.  **Film Category:** It must be an Oscar-nominated film.\n2.  **Character Action:** A character says the specific words \"Thank you.\"\n3.  **Setting:** The action occurs while the character is boarding a bus.\n4.  **Consequence:** This act of saying \"Thank you\" seals the character's fate, implying it's a critical mistake that leads to a negative outcome.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"Mistake\"**\nWhy would saying \"Thank you\" be a fatal mistake? In thrillers or spy films, such a polite, reflexive phrase can be a giveaway.\n*   It could reveal the character's true nationality through accent or language.\n*   It could be out of character for the persona they are trying to project (e.g., a \"rude American\" persona wouldn't be so polite).\n*   It could be a response to someone they are supposed to be ignoring or treating with contempt.\n\n**Step 3: Search for Matching Films and Scenes**\nThinking of tense scenes in Oscar-nominated films involving escapes or undercover operations, a few candidates come to mind. The most prominent one matches most of the criteria, with a slight, common variation in the details.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Correct Film and Scene**\nThe film in question is **Argo** (2012), which was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won three, including Best Picture.\n\n*   **The Scene:** The climax of the film takes place at the Mehrabad Airport in Tehran. Six American diplomats are posing as a Canadian film crew to escape the country. They have been coached by CIA agent Tony Mendez to be loud, arrogant Hollywood types to make their cover believable.\n*   **The Character and Action:** As they are about to have their tickets approved to board their flight, one of the diplomats, Bob Anders (played by Tate Donovan), is spoken to by a compassionate Iranian guard. Against his training to remain silent, Anders reflexively and politely says \"Thank you\" in Farsi (\"متشکرم\" - motashakkeram).\n*   **The Consequence:** This polite gesture is completely out of character for the obnoxious persona they are supposed to have. It immediately arouses the suspicion of another, more hostile guard. This single act of courtesy causes the guards to pull the group aside for further verification, leading to the incredibly tense finale where their escape nearly fails. The \"Thank you\" directly triggers the final confrontation and chase, thus \"sealing their fate\" for that moment.\n\n**Step 5: Address the \"Bus\" Discrepancy**\nThe question mentions a \"bus,\" while the scene in *Argo* involves boarding a **plane**. This is a very common and understandable point of misremembering, as both are forms of public transport used for a getaway in the film's narrative. The core elements—the Oscar nomination, the \"Thank you,\" and the fatal consequence—all point directly to *Argo*. No other Oscar-nominated film fits these crucial details so precisely.\n\n<<<Argo>>>"
