    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Question**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as **induced subgraphs** within a single graph `G` that has exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n\nLet's break down the key terms:\n*   **Graph `G` on `n=128` vertices:** Our graph has a fixed number of vertices, `|V(G)| = 128`.\n*   **Clique:** A clique of size `k` is a set of `k` vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is equivalent to the complete graph `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** An induced subgraph `G[S]` on a subset of vertices `S` consists of the vertices `S` and *all* the edges from the original graph `G` that have both endpoints in `S`. The question states that the cliques must be induced subgraphs. This means if we find a set of `k` vertices that form a clique, the subgraph induced by these `k` vertices must be exactly `K_k`.\n*   **Maximum number of different clique sizes:** We are looking for a single graph `G` that maximizes the count of unique integers `k` for which an induced `K_k` exists.\n\n**2. The Key Insight: The Relationship Between a Clique and its Sub-cliques**\n\nLet's consider a graph `G` that contains an induced clique of a certain size, say `m`. This means there exists a subset of vertices `V_m` with `|V_m| = m`, such that the subgraph induced by `V_m`, denoted `G[V_m]`, is the complete graph `K_m`.\n\nNow, consider any subset of `V_m`, let's call it `V_k`, where `|V_k| = k` and `1 <= k <= m`. Since every vertex in `V_m` is connected to every other vertex in `V_m`, it follows that every vertex in the subset `V_k` is also connected to every other vertex in `V_k`.\n\nTherefore, the subgraph induced by `V_k`, which is `G[V_k]`, is a complete graph `K_k`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This is a critical realization. If a graph contains an induced clique of size `m`, it is guaranteed to also contain induced cliques of all smaller integer sizes, from `1` to `m-1`.\n\n**3. Reformulating the Problem**\n\nBased on the insight from Step 2, the set of all possible induced clique sizes in any given graph `G` is not just an arbitrary set of numbers. If `m` is the size of the largest induced clique in `G`, then the set of all induced clique sizes must be `{1, 2, 3, ..., m}`.\n\nThe size of this set is `m`. So, the number of different clique sizes is equal to the size of the largest induced clique in the graph. The size of the largest clique in a graph `G` is known as its **clique number**, denoted `ω(G)`.\n\nThe problem is now simplified to the following:\n**What is the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` with 128 vertices?**\n\n**4. Solving the Simplified Problem**\n\nFor any graph `G` with `n` vertices, a clique is a subset of its vertices. Therefore, the size of any clique `k` cannot be larger than the total number of vertices `n`. This gives us the fundamental constraint:\n`ω(G) <= n`\n\nFor our case, `n = 128`, so the clique number of any graph on 128 vertices cannot exceed 128.\n`ω(G) <= 128`\n\nThe question is whether this maximum value of 128 is achievable.\n\n**5. Constructing the Graph that Achieves the Maximum**\n\nTo achieve a clique number of 128 in a graph with 128 vertices, the graph itself must be a clique of size 128. This is the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_{128}`.\n\nIn `K_{128}`:\n*   The number of vertices is 128.\n*   Every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nLet's verify the induced clique sizes for `G = K_{128}`:\n*   Can we find an induced `K_{128}`? Yes, the entire graph itself.\n*   Can we find an induced `K_{127}`? Yes, pick any subset of 127 vertices. The subgraph they induce is `K_{127}`.\n*   ...\n*   Can we find an induced `K_k}` for any `k` such that `1 <= k <= 128`? Yes, simply select any subset of `k` vertices from the graph. Since all vertices are connected to all other vertices, this subset will induce a `K_k`.\n\nTherefore, for the graph `G = K_{128}`, the set of all possible induced clique sizes is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe number of different clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs in `K_{128}` is the size of the set `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, which is 128.\nSince we established that the maximum possible clique number for any graph on 128 vertices is 128, no other graph can have more than 128 different induced clique sizes.\n\nThus, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
