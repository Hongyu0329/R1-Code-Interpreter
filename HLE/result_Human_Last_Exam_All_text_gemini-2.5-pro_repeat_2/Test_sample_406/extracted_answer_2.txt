The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are: (1) The functions operate on complete, partially ordered metric spaces. (2) The functions F, G, and H collectively satisfy a mixed monotone property. (3) The functions obey a contractive condition, where a weighted sum of output distances is strictly less than the corresponding sum of input distances (the sum of weights must be less than 1). (4) There exists an initial point `(x₀, y₀, z₀)` that satisfies a specific set of inequalities with respect to the functions. (5) The functions are continuous or the spaces satisfy a regularity property.
