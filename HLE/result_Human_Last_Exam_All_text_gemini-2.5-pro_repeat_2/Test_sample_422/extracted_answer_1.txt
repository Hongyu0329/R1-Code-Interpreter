The two problems are the Infinite Regress of Justification and the Circularity of the Definition.

1.  **Infinite Regress of Justification:** The "Justification" condition requires that any belief be supported by a reason. This reason, being an epistemic state, must be either a belief or knowledge. If it's a belief, it too needs justification. If it's knowledge, then by the JTB definition, it is a justified belief, which also needs justification. This creates an endless chain where no belief can ever be foundationally justified, making knowledge impossible.

2.  **Circularity of the Definition:** The JTB theory defines Knowledge in terms of Justification. However, for a reason to serve as a proper justification, it cannot be a mere (and possibly false or unjustified) belief; it must be something the agent already knows. This means that Justification is best understood as being based on pre-existing Knowledge. Therefore, the definition becomes circular: Knowledge is defined by Justification, which in turn is grounded in Knowledge.
