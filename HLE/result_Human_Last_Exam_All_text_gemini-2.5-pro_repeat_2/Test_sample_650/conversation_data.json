    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Algorithm's Purpose:** The provided algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and a base `c` (where `c ≥ 2`) and computes the base-`c` representation of `n`. This is the standard \"repeated division\" algorithm for base conversion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Basic Operations:** We need to count the number of elementary operations the algorithm performs. The basic operations here are arithmetic (division, multiplication, subtraction) and assignments. In standard computational models, these operations on machine-sized integers are considered to take constant time, denoted as O(1).\n\n3.  **Analyze the cost of each step:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Initialization):**\n        *   `i := 0`: 1 assignment.\n        *   `x := n`: 1 assignment.\n        *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: 1 division.\n        *   `a_0 := x — qc`: 1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment.\n        *   The total work in Step 1 is a fixed number of basic operations. Therefore, its time complexity is constant, O(1).\n\n    *   **Step 2 (The `while` loop):** The complexity of the algorithm is dominated by this loop. We need to determine two things:\n        *   The cost of a single iteration of the loop.\n        *   The total number of times the loop executes.\n\n    *   **Step 2.1 (Inside the loop):**\n        *   `i := i + 1`: 1 addition, 1 assignment.\n        *   `x := q`: 1 assignment.\n        *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: 1 division.\n        *   `a_i := x — qc`: 1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment.\n        *   Similar to Step 1, the work inside each loop iteration is a fixed number of basic operations. Thus, the cost of one iteration is constant, O(1).\n\n    *   **Step 3 (Return):** This step simply returns the computed array of digits. This is an O(1) operation.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Loop Iterations:**\n    *   The loop continues as long as the condition `q > 0` is true.\n    *   Let's trace the value of `q`. Initially, `q` is set to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   In each iteration of the loop, the variable `x` takes the current value of `q`, and then `q` is updated to `⌊x/c⌋`. Essentially, the value of `q` is divided by `c` in each step (ignoring the floor for a moment).\n    *   Let `q_k` be the value of `q` after the `k`-th iteration of the `while` loop.\n    *   Initial `q` (before the loop): `q_0 = ⌊n/c⌋`\n    *   After 1st iteration: `q_1 = ⌊q_0/c⌋`\n    *   After 2nd iteration: `q_2 = ⌊q_1/c⌋`\n    *   ...\n    *   After `k` iterations: `q_k` will be approximately `n / c^(k+1)`.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q_k` becomes 0. This happens when `n / c^(k+1)` becomes less than 1.\n    *   So, we are looking for the smallest integer `k` for which `n / c^(k+1) < 1`.\n    *   This inequality can be rewritten as `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    *   Taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides gives: `log_c(n) < k+1`.\n    *   This means the number of iterations, `k`, is on the order of `log_c(n)`. More precisely, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Time Complexity:**\n    *   Total Time = (Time for initialization) + (Number of iterations) × (Time per iteration) + (Time for return)\n    *   Total Time = O(1) + `O(log_c(n))` × O(1) + O(1)\n    *   Total Time = O(1) + `O(log_c(n))` + O(1)\n    *   Total Time = `O(log_c(n))`\n    *   In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm is usually omitted because logarithms of different bases are related by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`), and constant factors are ignored. Therefore, the complexity is commonly written as `O(log n)`.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** The complexity is measured as a function of the input's magnitude, in this case, `n`.\n*   **Basic Operation Assumption:** We assume that arithmetic operations on integers of the size of `n` take constant time. For very large numbers requiring arbitrary-precision arithmetic, the complexity of these operations would depend on the number of bits in `n` (which is `log n`), and the total complexity would be higher (e.g., `O((log n)^2)`). However, for a standard analysis, the O(1) assumption for basic operations is standard.\n*   **Loop Termination:** The key is to correctly identify that the controlling variable `q` decreases by a multiplicative factor (`1/c`) in each iteration, which leads to a logarithmic number of iterations.\n*   **Logarithm Base:** While the exact number of iterations depends on the base `c`, in the language of Big-O notation, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log_2(n))` or `O(ln n)`, so we simplify it to `O(log n)`.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe algorithm's core is a loop that repeatedly divides the input number `n` by the base `c` until the result is zero. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` before it becomes less than 1 is given by `log_c(n)`. Since each division and the associated operations inside the loop take constant time, the total time complexity is proportional to the number of iterations. Thus, the time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`, which is written as `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
