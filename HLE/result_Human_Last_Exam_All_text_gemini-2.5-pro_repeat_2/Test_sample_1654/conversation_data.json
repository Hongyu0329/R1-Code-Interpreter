    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the specific number of times Anton Chekov described Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat or its state (being put on, taken off, etc.) in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question correctly identifies that these descriptions are symbolic of the character's changing attitude and subservience.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the role of the coat in the story**\nThe coat is the primary symbol in the story. When Otchumyelov feels authoritative and is dealing with someone he perceives as being of a lower social class, he wears his coat. When he fears he might be offending someone powerful, like General Zhigalov, he becomes flustered and hot, and takes his coat off. The act of putting on and taking off the coat physically represents his \"chameleon-like\" changes in opinion and demeanor.\n\n**Step 3: Chronologically track the descriptions of the coat through the story**\n\n1.  **First Description:** At the very beginning of the story, as Otchumyelov walks across the market square. He is described as being \"in a new overcoat.\" This establishes his initial state of authority.\n2.  **Second Description (First Change):** When he learns the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov feels hot from the pressure. He says to his subordinate, \"Take off my coat, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\" He takes the coat off, symbolizing his shift from authority to panic.\n3.  **Third Description (Second Change):** A moment later, someone in the crowd says the dog is a stray. Otchumyelov's authority returns, and he feels a \"chill.\" He says, \"Put my coat on, brother Yeldyrin. There's a wind getting up...\" He puts the coat back on.\n4.  **Fourth Description (Third Change):** The policeman Yeldyrin speculates that the dog still might be the General's. Otchumyelov immediately becomes flustered again. He repeats his earlier action: \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...\"\n5.  **Fifth Description (Fourth Change):** The General's cook appears and states definitively that the dog does not belong to the General. Otchumyelov, now ready to condemn the dog and its owner, feels the need for his symbol of authority again. The story notes, \"Put on my coat...\"\n6.  **Sixth Description (Fifth Change/Final State):** The cook then adds that the dog belongs to the General's *brother*. This is the ultimate revelation for Otchumyelov. Instead of removing his coat in panic, his entire demeanor changes to one of fawning respect. As he walks away, he \"wraps his greatcoat round him,\" a final act that signifies his settling into the role of a subservient official, shielding himself with his authority as he leaves the scene.\n\n**Step 4: Tally the count**\nBy carefully tracking each distinct action or description involving the coat that symbolizes a shift in Otchumyelov's mentality, we arrive at a total of six instances.\n\n1.  Wearing the new overcoat.\n2.  Taking the coat off.\n3.  Putting the coat on.\n4.  Taking the coat off again.\n5.  Putting the coat on again.\n6.  Wrapping the coat around himself.\n\nEach of these six moments is a deliberate description by Chekov to highlight the central theme of the story.\n\n<<<6>>>"
