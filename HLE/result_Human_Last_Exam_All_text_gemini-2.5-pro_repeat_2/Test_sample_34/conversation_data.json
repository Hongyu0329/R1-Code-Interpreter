    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Scenario's Key Elements**\n\n*   **Position: The Button (BTN)**\n    *   This is the most profitable position in poker. You are last to act post-flop, giving you a significant informational advantage.\n    *   Because of this advantage, you should play the widest range of hands from the button compared to any other position.\n\n*   **Action: Open-raise to 2.5x**\n    *   This is a standard opening size. An open-raise aims to steal the blinds (the Small Blind and Big Blind's forced bets) and build a pot with a hand that has potential, while being in position.\n\n*   **Game Conditions: 100BB Rake-Free Cash Game**\n    *   **100BB:** This is a standard stack depth for which opening ranges are well-studied.\n    *   **Rake-Free:** This is a crucial detail. Rake is the fee the poker room takes from a pot. In a normal game, the need to overcome the rake makes very marginal hands unprofitable. In a rake-free environment, the bar for profitability is much lower. Any hand that would be breakeven or slightly losing due to rake becomes a profitable open. This encourages playing an even wider range of hands than usual.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Worst Suited Jack\"**\n\n*   \"Suited Jack\" refers to any hand containing a Jack and another card of the same suit (Jxs). The possible hands are AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n*   \"Worst\" in this context means the hand that has the lowest expected value (EV) while still being a profitable hand to open-raise. We are looking for the hand on the absolute borderline of the opening range within this category.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Suited Jack Hands**\n\nWe can rank the suited jack hands based on their overall strength, which comes from a combination of high-card value and connectivity (the ability to make straights).\n\n1.  **Premium/Strong (AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs):** These hands are extremely strong. They can make the strongest flushes and straights (like Broadway). They are opened from every position, let alone the button.\n2.  **Strong Connectors/Gappers (J9s, J8s, J7s):** These hands have good playability. They can make strong flushes and have decent straight potential. They are clear, profitable opens from the button.\n3.  **Weak/Low Suited Jacks (J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s):** The value of these hands comes mostly from their suitedness (flush potential) and the high-card value of the Jack. Their straight potential is much lower because the gap between the cards is larger.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Cutoff Point for Opening**\n\n*   Given the advantages of being on the button and the rake-free nature of the game, the optimal strategy is to open an extremely wide range of hands.\n*   In modern Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solutions, even for games *with* rake, the button's opening range includes all suited hands down to the very bottom, such as 72s and 82s. Therefore, every single suited Jack, from AJs down to J2s, is considered a standard, profitable open-raise from the button.\n*   Since all suited jacks *should* be opened, the \"worst\" one to open is simply the one with the lowest intrinsic value.\n*   Comparing the low suited jacks, J3s is better than J2s, and J4s is better than J3s, and so on. The hand with the lowest kicker (the '2') and the worst connectivity (it's a 9-gapper) is **J2s**. It has the lowest EV of all the suited jacks, but it is still a profitable open in this scenario.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe worst suited jack you should open from the button in a 100BB rake-free game is the one with the lowest kicker, as all suited jacks are profitable opens in this situation. The hand with the lowest rank and worst connectivity is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
