To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape with the rising and setting of the sun. At sunrise, when exposed to UV light, the table should bend or fold from an elongated shape into a more compact, V-shape (mimicking the trans-to-cis isomerization). At sunset, with the UV light gone, the table should slowly straighten back out to its original elongated shape (mimicking the thermal relaxation from cis-to-trans).
