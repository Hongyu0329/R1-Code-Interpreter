    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** The question asks for a specific person's name.\n    *   **What did they do:** They \"decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals.\" This points to a specific philosophical or logical analysis of signs (semiotics).\n    *   **From where:** The person must be a philosopher from the \"Lviv-Warsaw School.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This was a highly influential Polish school of logic and analytic philosophy active between the World Wars (c. 1918-1939). Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The school was known for its emphasis on clarity, logical rigor, and the analysis of language.\n    *   **Hallmark:** In this philosophical context, \"hallmark\" is best understood as a \"sign\" or \"mark\" (*znak* in Polish). It's an entity, event, or property that indicates the existence or presence of something else.\n    *   **Symptom:** This refers to a *natural sign*. A symptom is causally connected to what it signifies. The classic example is smoke being a symptom of fire. The sign (smoke) is not intentionally created to communicate the presence of the cause (fire).\n    *   **Signal:** This refers to a *conventional* or *intentional sign*. A signal is created by a sender with the purpose of communicating information to a receiver or causing a specific reaction. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop, and a referee's whistle is a signal to stop play.\n\n3.  **Identify the Philosopher:**\n    *   The task is to find which philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School made this specific distinction within the theory of signs.\n    *   While many members of the school worked on language and logic, this particular analysis is a cornerstone of the work of **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n    *   Ajdukiewicz was a leading figure in the school, known for his work in epistemology, semantics, and the philosophy of language.\n    *   In his influential works, particularly his book *Logika pragmatyczna* (*Pragmatic Logic*), he presents a detailed analysis of signs (*znaki*).\n    *   He famously distinguished signs into several categories, with the primary distinction being between natural signs, which he called **symptoms** (*oznaki*), and signs created for communication, which he called **signals** (*sygnały*).\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the philosopher who fits all the criteria is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. He was a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School, and his semiotic theory includes the explicit decomposition of the general notion of a sign (hallmark) into symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional/intentional signs).\n\n***\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Kazimierz\\ Ajdukiewicz}$."
