    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Number of Electrons ($N_{elec}$)\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of electrons in the molecule. The chemical formula $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ implies the presence of one Carbon (C) atom, three Hydrogen (H) atoms, one Silicon (Si) atom, and one Fluorine (F) atom. We sum the electrons from each atom based on its atomic number:\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron per atom. There are 3 H atoms, so $3 \\times 1 = 3$ electrons.\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons ($N_{elec}$) = $6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$.\n\nFor a singlet ground state calculation (total spin $S=0$), the number of alpha-spin electrons ($N_\\alpha$) is equal to the number of beta-spin electrons ($N_\\beta$).\n$N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N_{elec} / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Basis Functions (Spatial Orbitals, $K$)\n\nNext, we determine the total number of atomic basis functions provided by the 6-31G** basis set. This number corresponds to the number of spatial orbitals, $K$, in the calculation.\n\nThe 6-31G** basis set is a split-valence basis set with polarization functions on both heavy atoms (`*` for d-functions) and hydrogen atoms (second `*` for p-functions).\n\nLet's count the basis functions for each atom type:\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: The 6-31G part describes the 1s orbital with two functions (a split s-shell). The `**` adds a set of p-type polarization functions (px, py, pz).\n    *   s-functions: 2\n    *   p-functions: 3\n    *   Total for H = $2 + 3 = 5$ basis functions.\n*   **Carbon (C)** (a second-row atom): The 6-31G part describes the core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) orbitals. This results in a [3s2p] contraction, giving 9 functions. The `**` adds a set of d-type polarization functions (5 spherical harmonics).\n    *   6-31G functions: 9\n    *   d-functions: 5\n    *   Total for C = $9 + 5 = 14$ basis functions.\n*   **Fluorine (F)** (a second-row atom): The counting is identical to Carbon.\n    *   Total for F = $9 + 5 = 14$ basis functions.\n*   **Silicon (Si)** (a third-row atom): The 6-31G part describes the core (1s, 2s, 2p) and valence (3s, 3p) orbitals. This results in a [4s3p] contraction, giving 13 functions. The `**` adds a set of d-type polarization functions.\n    *   6-31G functions: 13\n    *   d-functions: 5\n    *   Total for Si = $13 + 5 = 18$ basis functions.\n\nNow, we sum the basis functions for all atoms in the molecule (1 C, 3 H, 1 Si, 1 F):\n$K = (1 \\times N_C) + (3 \\times N_H) + (1 \\times N_{Si}) + (1 \\times N_F)$\n$K = (1 \\times 14) + (3 \\times 5) + (1 \\times 18) + (1 \\times 14)$\n$K = 14 + 15 + 18 + 14 = 61$.\nSo, we have $K=61$ spatial orbitals.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Formula for the Number of CSFs\n\nFor a full CI calculation, the number of singlet ($S=0$) CSFs for $N_{elec}$ electrons in $K$ spatial orbitals is given by the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{K}{N_\\alpha} \\binom{K}{N_\\beta} - \\binom{K}{N_\\alpha-1} \\binom{K}{N_\\beta+1}$\n\nSince we have a singlet state, $N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N_{elec}/2$. Let $k = N_{elec}/2$.\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{K}{k}^2 - \\binom{K}{k-1}\\binom{K}{k+1}$\n\nPlugging in our values, $K=61$ and $k=16$:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{61}{16}^2 - \\binom{61}{15}\\binom{61}{17}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Number\n\nWe need to calculate the values of the binomial coefficients. These are very large numbers, requiring a high-precision calculator.\n*   $\\binom{61}{15} = 417,609,835,392$\n*   $\\binom{61}{16} = 1,200,678,277,248$\n*   $\\binom{61}{17} = 3,178,283,371,200$\n\nNow substitute these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = (1,200,678,277,248)^2 - (417,609,835,392) \\times (3,178,283,371,200)$\n$N_{CSF} = 1,441,628,323,611,340,111,872 - 1,327,170,889,274,240,111,872$\n$N_{CSF} = 114,457,434,337,100,000,000$\n\nThis can be written in scientific notation as approximately $1.1446 \\times 10^{20}$.\n\n<<<114457434337100000000>>>"
