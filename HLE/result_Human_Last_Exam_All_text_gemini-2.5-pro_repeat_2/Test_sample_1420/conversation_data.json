    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Scaling Exponents:** Near a critical point, thermodynamic quantities exhibit power-law behavior. For instance, the specific heat `C` scales with the reduced temperature `t = (T - T_c)/T_c` as `C ~ |t|⁻ᵃ`. The exponent `α` is a universal critical exponent.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** For a given system, this is the spatial dimension at or above which the critical exponents take their simpler, mean-field theory values. For the class of models we are considering (Ising, n-vector models described by a φ⁴ theory), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`.\n*   **Epsilon (ϵ) Expansion:** This is a powerful technique in the renormalization group (RG) framework, developed by Wilson and Fisher. It involves performing calculations in `d = d_c - ϵ` dimensions, treating `ϵ` as a small, continuous parameter. The results for critical exponents are obtained as a power series in `ϵ`. We then set `ϵ` to its value for the physical dimension of interest.\n\n**2. Identify the System Parameters**\n\n*   **Spatial Dimension (d):** The question specifies `d = 3`.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** For the relevant universality class (φ⁴ theory), `d_c = 4`.\n*   **Expansion Parameter (ϵ):** `ϵ = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n*   **Order Parameter Components (n):** The problem does not specify the number of components of the order parameter. In such cases, it is standard to assume the simplest and most common case, the **Ising universality class**, where the order parameter is a scalar. Thus, we take `n = 1`.\n\n**3. Use the Hyperscaling Relation**\n\nThe critical exponents are not all independent; they are connected by scaling relations. The relevant relation for finding `α` is the hyperscaling (or Josephson) relation, which connects the specific heat exponent `α` to the correlation length exponent `ν` and the spatial dimension `d`:\n`2 - α = dν`\n\n**4. Find the Expression for ν using the ϵ-Expansion**\n\nThe correlation length exponent `ν` has a well-known expression to first order in the `ϵ`-expansion for the `n`-vector model:\n`ν ≈ ν_MF + Δν`\nwhere `ν_MF = 1/2` is the mean-field value. The first-order correction is:\n`ν ≈ 1/2 + (n + 2) / (4 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n\n**5. Substitute and Solve for α**\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for `ν` and `d = 4 - ϵ` into the hyperscaling relation:\n`2 - α = (4 - ϵ) * ν`\n`2 - α ≈ (4 - ϵ) * [1/2 + (n + 2) / (4 * (n + 8)) * ϵ]`\n\nLet's expand this product and keep only the terms up to the first order in `ϵ` (since our expression for `ν` is only accurate to this order):\n`2 - α ≈ 4 * (1/2) + 4 * [(n + 2) / (4 * (n + 8))] * ϵ - ϵ * (1/2) + O(ϵ²)`\n`2 - α ≈ 2 + [(n + 2) / (n + 8)] * ϵ - (1/2) * ϵ`\n\nNow, combine the terms with `ϵ`:\n`2 - α ≈ 2 + [(n + 2) / (n + 8) - 1/2] * ϵ`\n`2 - α ≈ 2 + [(2(n + 2) - 1(n + 8)) / (2(n + 8))] * ϵ`\n`2 - α ≈ 2 + [(2n + 4 - n - 8) / (2(n + 8))] * ϵ`\n`2 - α ≈ 2 + [(n - 4) / (2(n + 8))] * ϵ`\n\nFinally, solve for `α`:\n`-α ≈ [(n - 4) / (2(n + 8))] * ϵ`\n`α ≈ -[(n - 4) / (2(n + 8))] * ϵ`\n`α ≈ (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value**\n\nNow we substitute the specific values for our system: `n = 1` and `ϵ = 1`.\n`α ≈ (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) * 1`\n`α ≈ 3 / (2 * 9)`\n`α ≈ 3 / 18`\n`α = 1/6`\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Validity of ϵ=1:** The `ϵ`-expansion is formally a perturbative series that is valid for `ϵ << 1`. Using it for `d=3` means setting `ϵ=1`, which is not small. Therefore, the result is an approximation, not an exact value. However, the procedure is standard for obtaining estimates of critical exponents.\n2.  **Universality Class (n):** The result depends on `n`, the number of components of the order parameter. We assumed `n=1` (Ising model), which is the standard interpretation when the model is not specified. For other models like the XY (`n=2`) or Heisenberg (`n=3`), the result would be different.\n3.  **Order of Expansion:** This calculation is performed to the *first order* (one-loop) in `ϵ`. Higher-order calculations (`O(ϵ²)`, `O(ϵ³)`, etc.) exist and provide more accurate (though more complex) results.\n4.  **Hyperscaling Assumption:** The relation `2 - α = dν` is itself a key result of RG theory, assumed to be valid below the upper critical dimension (`d < d_c`).\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
