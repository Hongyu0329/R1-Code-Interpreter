    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of regions created by the fold lines of a standard origami crane.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe goal is to count the number of distinct, non-overlapping regions a square piece of paper is divided into by the complete set of creases (the crease pattern or CP) required to fold a \"standard\" origami crane.\n\n**2. Define a \"Standard Origami Crane\" and its Folds**\nA standard crane involves a specific sequence of folds starting from a square base, which is then shaped into a bird base, and finally formed into the crane shape. We must consider all the creases this process creates. For a complete, display-ready crane, this includes:\n*   **Initial Folds:** Creases that form the preliminary grid (diagonals, horizontal, and vertical axes).\n*   **Bird Base Folds:** Creases used to transform the preliminary base into a bird base.\n*   **Shaping Folds:** Folds that create the neck, tail, and head (typically inside-reverse folds).\n*   **Finishing Folds:** A final squash fold at the bottom to create a flat base, allowing the crane to stand. This is a very common step and considered standard for a finished model.\n\n**3. Choose a Systematic Counting Method**\nThe most reliable way to count the regions is to analyze the final crease pattern on the unfolded square. The pattern is highly symmetrical, so we can simplify the counting by dividing the square into four primary triangles radiating from the center, created by the initial horizontal and vertical center-line folds. We'll call these the **Top, Bottom, Left, and Right** triangles. We will count the regions within each of these four zones and then add the regions from the final base fold.\n\n**4. Count the Regions in Each Section**\n\n*   **Top and Bottom Triangles (The Wings):**\n    *   The Top and Bottom triangles of the CP become the crane's wings.\n    *   The first fold for the bird base creates a major horizontal crease in each of these sections, dividing the original large triangle into a smaller triangle and a large trapezoid (2 regions).\n    *   The subsequent inside-reverse folds for the tail, neck, and head each create additional horizontal creases that run across the trapezoid portion of the wings.\n    *   This results in the large trapezoid being divided by 3 parallel lines. A region divided by 3 parallel lines creates 4 smaller regions.\n    *   Therefore, each wing section contains: 1 region (the small top triangle) + 4 regions (the strips of the trapezoid) = **5 regions**.\n    *   Since there are two wings (Top and Bottom sections), the total from the wings is 5 + 5 = **10 regions**.\n\n*   **Left Triangle (The Tail):**\n    *   Let's assume the Left triangle becomes the tail.\n    *   The initial bird base folds create two \"kite\" creases that divide this triangle into 3 regions.\n    *   The inside-reverse fold to form the tail creates a V-shaped crease. This \"V\" is formed within the central one of the 3 regions, splitting it into 3 smaller regions (a net gain of 2 regions).\n    *   So, the total number of regions in the tail section is: 2 (the outer regions from the kite fold) + 3 (the new regions from the V-fold) = **5 regions**.\n\n*   **Right Triangle (The Neck and Head):**\n    *   The Right triangle becomes the neck and head, which is slightly more complex than the tail.\n    *   Like the tail section, it is first divided into 3 regions by two \"kite\" folds.\n    *   The first inside-reverse fold for the neck creates a V-crease, splitting the central region into 3 (total regions in this section so far: 2 + 3 = 5).\n    *   A second, smaller inside-reverse fold creates the head. This adds another V-crease that splits the tip of the newly formed neck region into 3 more regions (a net gain of 2).\n    *   So, the total regions in the neck/head section is: 2 (outer) + 2 (neck base) + 3 (head tip) = **7 regions**.\n\n*   **Central Base Fold (Squash Fold):**\n    *   The final standard step is to squash the base so the crane can stand. This creates a small square of new creases right at the center of the paper.\n    *   This new square is itself divided into 4 small regions by the main horizontal and vertical axes that run through the center.\n    *   These 4 regions are created at the center point where the other four sections meet. This fold doesn't remove or merge any existing regions; it simply truncates the tips of the four central-most regions.\n    *   Therefore, this step adds **4 new regions** to the total count.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Total**\nTo find the total number of regions, we sum the counts from each part of the analysis:\n\nTotal Regions = (Regions from Wings) + (Regions from Tail) + (Regions from Neck/Head) + (Regions from Base)\nTotal Regions = 10 + 5 + 7 + 4 = 26\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   **Defining \"Standard\":** The result depends on which folds are considered standard. The analysis above assumes the most common, complete crane, including the head fold and the base squash fold. Omitting the base squash would result in 22 regions.\n*   **Symmetry:** The counting relies on the symmetry of the folds. The only asymmetry is the final head fold, which is why the Neck/Head section (7 regions) is different from the Tail section (5 regions).\n*   **Complexity of Folds:** An inside-reverse fold (V-crease) applied to a region splits it into 3 new regions, not 2. This is a crucial detail for an accurate count.\n*   **Propagation of Creases:** Folds applied to one part of the layered model (like the neck) can and do create creases in other parts of the model when unfolded (like the wings). This was accounted for in the wing analysis.\n\n### Final Answer\nBy systematically counting the regions created by all the folds in a standard, finished origami crane, we arrive at the total number.\n\n<<<26>>>"
