    "This question asks for the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2. This is equivalent to classifying the possible combinatorial types of singular stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. The combinatorial type of a stable curve is captured by its dual graph, where vertices represent irreducible components and edges represent nodes.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Stable Curves and the Genus Formula\n\nA stable curve of genus $g \\ge 2$ is a connected projective curve $C$ satisfying:\n1.  Its only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\n2.  Any smooth rational component (an irreducible component isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$) must intersect the other components in at least 3 points.\n\nThe arithmetic genus $p_a(C)$ of such a curve is given by the formula:\n$p_a(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_a(C_i) + \\delta - k + 1$\nwhere:\n*   $k$ is the number of irreducible components $C_i$.\n*   $p_a(C_i)$ is the arithmetic genus of the component $C_i$. For a smooth component, this is its geometric genus, $g(C_i)$.\n*   $\\delta$ is the total number of nodes on $C$.\n\nFor a stable reduction of a genus 2 curve, we must have $p_a(C) = 2$.\n\nAn alternative formulation uses the dual graph $\\Gamma$ of the curve. The vertices $v_i$ of $\\Gamma$ correspond to the components $C_i$, and the edges correspond to the nodes connecting these components. Self-loops correspond to nodes on a single component. The genus is then:\n$p_a(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} g(C_i) + b_1(\\Gamma)$\nwhere $b_1(\\Gamma)$ is the first Betti number (the number of independent cycles) of the dual graph. $b_1(\\Gamma) = (\\text{number of edges}) - (\\text{number of vertices}) + 1$.\n\nThe stability condition translates to a condition on the dual graph: for any vertex $v_i$ corresponding to a rational component ($g(C_i)=0$), its degree (or valence) $d(v_i)$ must be at least 3, where a loop at a vertex contributes 2 to its degree.\n\n### Step 2: Systematic Classification by Number of Components ($k$)\n\nWe analyze the possible structures based on the number of irreducible components, $k$. A key constraint, which can be derived from the stability condition and genus formula, is that a stable curve of genus 2 can have at most two rational components. This significantly limits the number of cases to check.\n\n**Case 1: $k=1$ (Irreducible Curves)**\nThe curve $C$ is irreducible. The genus formula is $2 = g(C_{norm}) + \\delta$, where $C_{norm}$ is the normalization of $C$. Since the curve is singular, $\\delta \\ge 1$.\n*   **Subcase 1a: $g(C_{norm}) = 1$.**\n    Then $2 = 1 + \\delta \\implies \\delta=1$. This is an irreducible curve whose normalization is an elliptic curve, with one node. This is a valid stable type.\n    **(Type 1)**\n\n*   **Subcase 1b: $g(C_{norm}) = 0$.**\n    Then $2 = 0 + \\delta \\implies \\delta=2$. This is an irreducible curve whose normalization is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$), with two nodes. This is a valid stable type.\n    **(Type 2)**\n\n**Case 2: $k=2$ (Two Components)**\nLet the components be $C_1$ and $C_2$ with genera $g_1$ and $g_2$. The genus formula is $2 = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 2 + 1 = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 1$. The curve must be connected, so there is at least one node connecting $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n*   **Subcase 2a: $(g_1, g_2) = (1, 1)$.**\n    $2 = 1+1+\\delta-1 \\implies \\delta=1$. This means there is exactly one node, and it must connect the two components. The components are smooth elliptic curves. No rational components means the stability condition is automatically satisfied.\n    **(Type 3)**\n\n*   **Subcase 2b: $(g_1, g_2) = (1, 0)$.**\n    $2 = 1+0+\\delta-1 \\implies \\delta=2$. We have an elliptic component $C_1$ and a rational component $C_2$. Total nodes $\\delta=2$. The stability condition requires the rational component $C_2$ to have at least 3 special points (nodes on it or points of attachment). Let $\\delta_{12}$ be the number of nodes connecting $C_1$ and $C_2$, and $\\delta_2$ be the number of self-nodes on $C_2$. The number of special points on $C_2$ is $\\delta_{12} + 2\\delta_2$. We need $\\delta_{12} + 2\\delta_2 \\ge 3$. The total number of nodes is $\\delta = \\delta_1 + \\delta_2 + \\delta_{12} = 2$. A solution is $\\delta_1=0, \\delta_2=1, \\delta_{12}=1$.\n    *   Total nodes: $0+1+1=2$. OK.\n    *   Stability of $C_2$: $1 + 2(1) = 3$. OK.\n    This corresponds to a smooth elliptic curve meeting a rational curve with one node at a single point.\n    **(Type 4)**\n\n*   **Subcase 2c: $(g_1, g_2) = (0, 0)$.**\n    $2 = 0+0+\\delta-1 \\implies \\delta=3$. Both components are rational and must satisfy the stability condition. Let $\\delta_{12}$ be the nodes between them, $\\delta_1$ self-nodes on $C_1$, $\\delta_2$ self-nodes on $C_2$. Total nodes $\\delta_1+\\delta_2+\\delta_{12}=3$.\n    *   Stability for $C_1$: $\\delta_{12} + 2\\delta_1 \\ge 3$.\n    *   Stability for $C_2$: $\\delta_{12} + 2\\delta_2 \\ge 3$.\n    We check integer solutions for $(\\delta_1, \\delta_2, \\delta_{12})$:\n    1.  $(\\delta_1, \\delta_2, \\delta_{12}) = (0, 0, 3)$: $C_1$ stability: $3+0\\ge 3$. $C_2$ stability: $3+0\\ge 3$. This works. It corresponds to two smooth rational curves meeting at 3 distinct points.\n        **(Type 5)**\n    2.  $(\\delta_1, \\delta_2, \\delta_{12}) = (1, 1, 1)$: $C_1$ stability: $1+2(1)\\ge 3$. $C_2$ stability: $1+2(1)\\ge 3$. This works. It corresponds to two rational curves, each with one node, meeting each other at one point.\n        **(Type 6)**\n    Other partitions like $(1,0,2)$ fail the stability condition for one of the components.\n\n**Case 3: $k \\ge 3$**\nAs mentioned, a stable curve of genus 2 can have at most two rational components.\n*   If $k=3$, we could have $(g_1, g_2, g_3) = (1,1,1)$ (genus is at least 3), $(1,1,0)$ (genus is at least 3), $(1,0,0)$ (2 rational components), or $(0,0,0)$ (3 rational components).\n*   The case with 3 rational components is impossible.\n*   A detailed analysis of the case with one elliptic and two rational components shows that the stability conditions cannot be satisfied simultaneously with the genus formula.\n*   Any case with $k \\ge 3$ and $k_0 \\le 2$ can also be shown to be impossible.\n\n### Summary of the Types\n\nWe have found exactly 6 distinct combinatorial types of singular stable curves of genus 2.\n\n1.  **Irreducible:** An elliptic curve with one node.\n2.  **Irreducible:** A rational curve with two nodes.\n3.  **Two components:** Two smooth elliptic curves meeting at one point.\n4.  **Two components:** A smooth elliptic curve and a rational curve with one node, meeting at one point.\n5.  **Two components:** Two smooth rational curves meeting at three points.\n6.  **Two components:** Two rational curves, each with one node, meeting at one point.\n\nThese 6 types correspond to the 6 boundary strata of the moduli space of stable genus 2 curves, $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_2$.\n\n<<<6>>>"
