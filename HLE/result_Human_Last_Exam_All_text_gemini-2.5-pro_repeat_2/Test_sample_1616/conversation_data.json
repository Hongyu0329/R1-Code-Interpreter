    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concept: Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)**\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing is a historical sound change in English phonology. It has three key components:\n1.  **The Change:** A tense vowel (a long vowel like the \"a\" in `sane` or the \"i\" in `divine`) becomes a lax vowel (a short vowel like the \"a\" in `sanity` or the \"i\" in `divinity`).\n2.  **The Environment:** This change occurs when the vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable, which means the third syllable from the end of the word.\n3.  **The Trigger:** This usually happens when a suffix is added to a base word, making the word longer and shifting the position of the original vowel to the antepenultimate syllable.\n\nFor example:\n*   `sane` (/seɪn/) is one syllable. The vowel /eɪ/ is tense.\n*   When we add `-ity`, we get `san-i-ty` (/ˈsænɪti/). The word is now three syllables.\n*   The original vowel is now in the first syllable (`san-`), which is the third from the end (the antepenultimate).\n*   Because of its position, the tense /eɪ/ \"laxes\" to /æ/. This is Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each word in the list.**\n\nWe will examine each word to see if it fits the pattern of Trisyllabic Laxing by comparing it to its related base word.\n\n*   **southern**:\n    *   Related word: `south` (vowel sound /aʊ/, a tense diphthong).\n    *   `southern` (vowel sound /ʌ/, a lax vowel).\n    *   Syllable count: `south-ern` (2 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word shows laxing (/aʊ/ -> /ʌ/), but it is only two syllables long. The vowel is not in the third-to-last syllable. Therefore, it has undergone a form of vowel shortening, but **not** Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**:\n    *   Related word: `derive` (vowel sound /aɪ/, a tense diphthong).\n    *   `derivative` (vowel sound /ɪ/, a lax vowel).\n    *   Syllable count: `de-riv-a-tive` (4 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel in question is in the syllable `-riv-`, which is the third syllable from the end. The tense vowel /aɪ/ from `derive` has become the lax vowel /ɪ/. This is a textbook example of Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**:\n    *   Related word: `serene` (vowel sound /iː/, a tense vowel).\n    *   `serenity` (vowel sound /ɛ/, a lax vowel).\n    *   Syllable count: `se-ren-i-ty` (4 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel in the syllable `-ren-` is the third from the end. The tense vowel /iː/ from `serene` has become the lax vowel /ɛ/. This is another classic example of Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**:\n    *   Related word: `please` (vowel sound /iː/, a tense vowel).\n    *   `pleasant` (vowel sound /ɛ/, a lax vowel).\n    *   Syllable count: `pleas-ant` (2 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word shows laxing (/iː/ -> /ɛ/), but it is only two syllables long. The vowel is not in the third-to-last syllable. This is an instance of a different rule called \"pre-cluster shortening\" (laxing before a consonant cluster like `-nt`). It has **not** undergone Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**:\n    *   Related word: `grate` (as in `grateful`, with vowel sound /eɪ/, a tense diphthong).\n    *   `gratitude` (vowel sound /æ/, a lax vowel).\n    *   Syllable count: `grat-i-tude` (3 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel in the first syllable `grat-` is the third from the end. The tense vowel /eɪ/ from the root has become the lax vowel /æ/. This is another example of Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**:\n    *   Related word: `shade` (vowel sound /eɪ/, a tense diphthong).\n    *   `shadow` (vowel sound /æ/, a lax vowel).\n    *   Syllable count: `shad-ow` (2 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** The word is only two syllables long, so by definition, it cannot have undergone Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n**Step 3: Distinguish between the candidates.**\n\nWe have identified three words that have *not* undergone Trisyllabic Laxing because they are not trisyllabic: `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow`. The question asks for a single answer, so we must make a finer distinction.\n\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` both show a historical change where a tense vowel in a base word was shortened or \"laxed\" in the derived form, even though the rule responsible wasn't TSL. They did undergo a laxing process.\n*   `shadow` has a different history. The Old English ancestor of `shadow` (`sceadu`) always had a short/lax vowel. The related word `shade` (from OE `scead`) had its vowel *lengthened* later in history. Therefore, the word `shadow` did not \"undergo\" a laxing process at all; it simply retained its original short vowel.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile `southern` and `pleasant` are not examples of TSL, they are examples of other laxing rules. `shadow` is the strongest answer because its vowel was never tensed and then laxed; it was lax from its origin. Therefore, it has most definitively \"not undergone\" a laxing process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
