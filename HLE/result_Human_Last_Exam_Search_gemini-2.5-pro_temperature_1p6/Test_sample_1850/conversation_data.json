    "John Milton's epic poem, *Paradise Lost*, directly names three figures who are recognized as historical saints in various Christian traditions. These are the archangels Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel.\n\nWhile the term \"saints\" appears in the text, it is most often used in a broader sense to refer to the loyal angels in Heaven. For instance, in Book VI, the Messiah addresses the angelic army as \"ye Saints.\" Similarly, in Book III, God's narration mentions that at the Last Judgment, \"all thy Saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge.\"\n\nThe narrative of *Paradise Lost* primarily centers on the biblical story of the fall of humanity, with its main characters being Adam, Eve, God, and Satan. Milton's work is rich with allusions to classical mythology and history, mentioning figures like Galileo. However, a comprehensive review of the poem and its scholarly annotations does not reveal the naming of any historical, post-biblical saints as recognized by the Catholic Church.\n\nMilton's own strong Protestant convictions and his notable anti-Catholic stance make it improbable that he would have included specific historical saints revered in Catholicism. The poem does not contain references to figures such as Saint Peter, Saint Augustine, or other canonized individuals from post-biblical history.\n\nTherefore, the only figures mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost* who are also considered historical saints are the three archangels.\n\n<<<3>>>"
