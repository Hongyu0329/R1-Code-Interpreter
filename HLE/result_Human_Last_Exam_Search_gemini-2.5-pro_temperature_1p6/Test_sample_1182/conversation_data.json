    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic integers has **4** double points.\n\nThis result is obtained by analyzing the structure of the curve's stable model, which is the \"best possible\" version of the curve after reduction modulo 2. The process involves a sequence of transformations and blow-ups to resolve singularities that are more complex than ordinary double points.\n\nA detailed analysis leads to the following structure for the special fiber of the stable model:\n*   An irreducible component of geometric genus 1 (an elliptic curve) which has one self-intersection, contributing one double point.\n*   A \"tail\" consisting of a chain of three rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$), which arises from resolving a complicated singularity at infinity. This chain contributes three additional double points: two from the intersections between the three rational curves, and one from the point where the chain attaches to the main elliptic curve component.\n\nIn total, this configuration has 1 + 3 = 4 ordinary double points.\n\n<<<4>>>"
