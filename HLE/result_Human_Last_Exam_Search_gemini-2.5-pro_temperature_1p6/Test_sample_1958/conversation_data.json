    "While William Shakespeare's plays are rich with biblical allusions, he rarely, if ever, mentions a book of the Bible by its explicit title. However, the first book in the canonical order of the Bible to be clearly referenced through one of its unique stories is **Genesis**.\n\nThis explicit reference appears in one of Shakespeare's earliest comedies, ***The Comedy of Errors***. In Act III, Scene 2, Dromio of Syracuse, when describing a kitchen maid, says, \"...she is so rough... that 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.\" This is a direct reference to the story of Noah's Ark and the great flood, a narrative unique to the Book of Genesis.\n\nAdditionally, Shakespeare alludes to other stories from Genesis in several of his plays. For example, the story of Cain and Abel is referenced some 26 times in 14 different plays, with one instance being in *Richard II*. *The Comedy of Errors* itself contains another reference to Genesis 3:16 in the opening scene. Given that *The Comedy of Errors* is one of Shakespeare's earliest plays, written around 1594, it solidifies Genesis as the first book of the Bible to be referenced in his works.\n\n<<<Genesis, in *The Comedy of Errors*.>>>"
