    "The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the motor passenger ship **SS *Brazza***.\n\nThe *Brazza*, with a tonnage of 10,387 tons, was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine U-37 on May 28, 1940. The attack occurred approximately 80 miles west of Cape Finisterre, while the *Brazza* was en route from Bordeaux to Casablanca. The ship sank in less than five minutes, resulting in a significant loss of life.\n\nSeveral other French naval vessels were lost in the period leading up to the armistice, which was signed on June 22, 1940, and took effect on June 25, 1940. However, these were either smaller vessels or were sunk by means other than a U-boat.\n\nFor instance, the French submarine *Doris*, with a displacement of 552 tons, was sunk by the German U-boat U-9 on May 9, 1940. The destroyer *Jaguar*, with a standard displacement of 2,126 metric tons, was torpedoed on May 23, 1940, but this was carried out by German E-boats, not a U-boat. On the same day, the torpedo boat *Orage*, with a standard displacement of 1,320 metric tons, was sunk by German aircraft.\n\nTherefore, based on available records, the passenger ship *Brazza* was the largest French vessel to be sunk by a German U-boat prior to the armistice.\n\n<<<SS Brazza>>>"
