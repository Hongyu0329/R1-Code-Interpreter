    "The search results confirm that Joseph Brodsky, a Russian and American poet and essayist, had a significant connection to Vienna and the English poet W. H. Auden. Brodsky was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1972 and his first stop was Vienna, where he was met by Auden. Brodsky deeply admired Auden, considering him \"the greatest mind of the twentieth century\". This establishes a strong link between a Russian-writing poet (Brodsky), an English poet (Auden), and the city of Vienna.\n\nThe question is about a specific phrase in a *Russian translation* of an essay. Brodsky wrote his essays primarily in English, and they were subsequently translated into Russian, sometimes by himself. This detail is crucial.\n\nThe key seems to be a pun on the surname \"Auden\" in Russian. The Russian transliteration of Auden is \"Оден\" (Oden). This is phonetically very similar to the Russian word \"одет\" (odet), which means \"is dressed\". The phrase \"wide boulevards of Vienna\" (\"широкие бульвары Вены\") coupled with \"одеты\" (\"are dressed\") would be a natural-sounding phrase in Russian, for example \"Бульвары одеты в зелень\" (\"The boulevards are dressed in green\").\n\nWhile I haven't found the exact quote containing the pun within the search results, the combination of Brodsky, his admiration for Auden, his stay in Vienna, and the linguistic possibility of the pun in Russian points strongly towards this answer. The essay is likely one of Brodsky's works where he reflects on his arrival in the West and his meeting with Auden, such as \"To Please a Shadow.\" The pun would be a translator's nod to the great English poet who resided near Vienna.\n\nGiven the nature of the question, which resembles a literary trivia or a \"What? Where? When?\"-style question, the pun on the name is the most probable answer.\n\n<<<Auden>>>"
