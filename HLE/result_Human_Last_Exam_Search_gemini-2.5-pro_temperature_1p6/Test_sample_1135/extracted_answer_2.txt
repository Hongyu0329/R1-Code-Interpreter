Therefore, in addition to the singly and doubly excited Slater determinants (for which the matrix elements are zeroed by construction), the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_J | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are also zero for all quintuply, hextuply, and higher excited Slater determinants. The only non-zero matrix elements of this form are for the reference determinant itself (which gives the correlation energy), and for triply and quadruply excited Slater determinants.
