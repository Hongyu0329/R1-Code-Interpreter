    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes complete oxidation, a total of two ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide (CO₂) molecules will be released.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the metabolic process:\n\n1.  **Glycolysis**: First, the six-carbon glucose molecule is broken down into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. The ¹³C labels at positions 1 and 4 of the glucose molecule are transferred to the pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The ¹³C label on carbon 1 (C1) of glucose ends up on the carboxyl carbon (C1) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C label on carbon 4 (C4) of glucose ends up on the methyl carbon (C3) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n2.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction)**: Next, each pyruvate molecule is converted into a two-carbon acetyl-CoA molecule. This reaction is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and releases one molecule of CO₂ per pyruvate.\n    *   The pyruvate with the ¹³C label on its carboxyl (C1) group will release that carbon as the **first molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂**.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule, which has its ¹³C label on the methyl (C3) group, releases its unlabeled carboxyl group as CO₂. Its labeled methyl group becomes part of acetyl-CoA.\n\n3.  **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**: The labeled two-carbon acetyl-CoA molecule enters the Krebs cycle. The two carbons of acetyl-CoA are incorporated into the cycle, but they are not released as CO₂ in the first turn. Instead, the two CO₂ molecules released in the first cycle come from carbons of the oxaloacetate molecule that the acetyl-CoA initially combined with. The ¹³C label is retained within the cycle's intermediates. In subsequent turns of the cycle, that labeled carbon will eventually be released as the **second molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂**.\n\nTherefore, the complete metabolism of one molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose ultimately results in the release of two labeled CO₂ molecules.\n\n<<<2>>>"
