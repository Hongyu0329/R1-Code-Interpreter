    "The value representing the time between consecutive heartbeats, from which Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is computed, is most commonly called the **beat-to-beat interval** or **inter-beat interval (IBI)**.\n\nWhen this interval is specifically measured from an electrocardiogram (ECG) by taking the time between two successive R-waves (the peaks of the QRS complex), it is referred to as the **R-R interval**. For data captured via photoplethysmography (PPG), the term **pulse-to-pulse interval (PPI)** is sometimes used, though \"beat-to-beat interval\" and \"inter-beat interval\" remain accurate and widely used terms.\n\nHRV is the measure of the variation in these beat-to-beat intervals over time. Various metrics are used to quantify this variability, including the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) and the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats (RMSSD). While PPG is considered a reliable method for assessing HRV parameters, ECG is seen as the gold standard because it directly measures the heart's electrical activity.\n\n<<<beat-to-beat interval"
