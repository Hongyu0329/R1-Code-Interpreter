    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the crease lines divide the paper into a total of 194 distinct regions.\n\nThe process of folding an origami crane involves a series of intricate steps, each creating new creases on the paper. The initial folds establish a base of diagonal and perpendicular lines. Subsequent steps, such as the \"petal fold\" and the formation of the head and tail, add more complex lines.\n\nA visual analysis of the complete crease pattern of a standard origami crane reveals the numerous regions created by these intersecting fold lines. Careful counting of each individual, enclosed area on the unfolded square of paper leads to the final number.\n\n<<<194>>>"
