    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we first determine its Betti numbers, $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g}; \\mathbb{R})$, for $k = 0, \\ldots, 6$. The Poincaré polynomial is then given by $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k x^k$.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent. We can analyze its structure by recognizing it as a semi-direct product. Let $\\mathfrak{a}$ be the 5-dimensional abelian ideal spanned by $\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$, and let $\\mathfrak{k}$ be the 1-dimensional abelian subalgebra spanned by $\\{e_1\\}$. Then $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{k} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{a}$.\n\nThe homology of $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be computed using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence, which for this semi-direct product collapses at the $E^2$ page. This gives the Betti numbers of $\\mathfrak{g}$ as:\n$b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(\\text{ker } d_k) + \\dim(\\text{ker } d_{k-1})$\nwhere $d_k$ is the linear map on the exterior power $\\Lambda^k \\mathfrak{a}$ induced by the action of $\\text{ad}_{e_1}$.\n\nThe action of $\\text{ad}_{e_1}$ on the basis of $\\mathfrak{a}$ is given by:\n*   $\\text{ad}_{e_1}(e_2) = e_3$\n*   $\\text{ad}_{e_1}(e_3) = e_4$\n*   $\\text{ad}_{e_1}(e_4) = 0$\n*   $\\text{ad}_{e_1}(e_5) = e_6$\n*   $\\text{ad}_{e_1}(e_6) = 0$\n\nThis action decomposes into two nilpotent Jordan blocks: one of size 3 on $V = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ and one of size 2 on $W = \\text{span}\\{e_5, e_6\\}$.\n\nLet $k_q = \\dim(\\text{ker } d_q)$. The calculation of these dimensions yields the following sequence for $q=0, \\dots, 5$: $(1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1)$.\n\nUsing the formula for the Betti numbers, we find:\n*   $b_0 = k_0 = 1$\n*   $b_1 = k_1 + k_0 = 2 + 1 = 3$\n*   $b_2 = k_2 + k_1 = 3 + 2 = 5$\n*   $b_3 = k_3 + k_2 = 3 + 3 = 6$\n*   $b_4 = k_4 + k_3 = 2 + 3 = 5$\n*   $b_5 = k_5 + k_4 = 1 + 2 = 3$\n*   $b_6 = k_6 + k_5 = 0 + 1 = 1$\n\nThese Betti numbers satisfy Poincaré duality ($b_k = b_{6-k}$), as expected for a unimodular Lie algebra (all nilpotent Lie algebras are unimodular).\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is therefore:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThis polynomial can be factored as:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)^2(1+x^2)(1+x+x^2)$.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 5*x**2 + 6*x**3 + 5*x**4 + 3*x**5 + x**6>>>"
