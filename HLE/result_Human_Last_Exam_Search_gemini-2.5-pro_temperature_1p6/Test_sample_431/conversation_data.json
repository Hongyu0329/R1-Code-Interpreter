    "There are 10 Cysteine residues located in the TM3-TM4 linker domains of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThe human Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) A receptor rho-1 (GABAAρ1), with the UniProt accession number P24046, is comprised of 479 amino acids. The structure of this receptor includes four transmembrane (TM) domains.\n\nBased on the annotation in the UniProt database, the specific regions for the third and fourth transmembrane domains are as follows:\n*   **TM3:** residues 297-318\n*   **TM4:** residues 433-454\n\nThe TM3-TM4 linker, therefore, consists of the amino acid sequence from position 319 to 432. The sequence for this linker is:\n\n`SRASLPKVGPLDGRAVSLKKSRHFRKRNIGYFILQTYMPSILIVILSWVSFWINYDASAARVALGITTVLTMTTINTHLRETLPKIPYVKAIDMYLMGCFVFVASLIEFATVNYFT`\n\nWithin this sequence of the TM3-TM4 linker, there are a total of **10** Cysteine (C) residues.\n\n<<<10>>>"
