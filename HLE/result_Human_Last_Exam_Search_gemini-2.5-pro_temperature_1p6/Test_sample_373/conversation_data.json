    "## Barbell Graph and Randomized Gossiping: Calculating the Bottleneck Edge Probability\n\nIn a 10-node barbell graph with uniform weights, the probability of sampling the single \"bottleneck\" edge during a round of randomized uniform gossiping is **1/25 or 4%**. This calculation hinges on the specific structure of the graph and the mechanics of the gossiping algorithm.\n\nA barbell graph, in its most common form, is constructed by connecting two identical, complete graphs with a single edge, known as a bridge. For a 10-node barbell graph, this typically means two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K5), linked by one connecting edge. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck\" as it's the sole path for information to travel between the two halves of the graph.\n\nThe total number of edges in this graph is 21. Each 5-node complete graph contains 10 edges (calculated as n*(n-1)/2, where n=5), and there is one additional bottleneck edge connecting the two.\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping involves a two-step process for edge selection:\n1.  A node is chosen uniformly at random from all the nodes in the graph.\n2.  The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to communicate with.\n\nIn our 10-node barbell graph, there are 10 nodes, so the probability of selecting any single node is 1/10. The probability of then selecting a specific neighbor depends on the degree of the chosen node (the number of connections it has).\n\nLet's consider the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge, which we'll call node A and node B.\n*   The nodes within each complete graph that are not part of the bottleneck connection are each connected to 4 other nodes within their respective K5. Their degree is 4.\n*   Node A is connected to the other 4 nodes in its own K5 and also to node B. Therefore, its degree is 5.\n*   Similarly, node B is connected to the 4 other nodes in its K5 and to node A, giving it a degree of 5.\n\nThe bottleneck edge can be sampled in two ways: either node A is selected and it communicates with node B, or node B is selected and communicates with node A.\n\nThe probability of the first event is the product of the probability of selecting node A (1/10) and the probability of node A choosing node B from its 5 neighbors (1/5). This gives a probability of (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nThe probability of the second event is identical: the probability of selecting node B (1/10) multiplied by the probability of B choosing A (1/5), resulting in (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nTo find the total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge, we sum the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events: 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50, which simplifies to **1/25**.\n\nThis relatively low probability highlights why the bottleneck edge can significantly slow down information diffusion in gossip-based algorithms on such graphs.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
