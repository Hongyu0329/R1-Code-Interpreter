    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad* is Mount Ossa. Located in Thessaly, Greece, Mount Ossa stands at an elevation of 1,978 meters (6,490 feet).\n\nWhile Mount Ida in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) features prominently in the epic as the vantage point from which the gods observed the Trojan War, its height is 1,774 meters (5,820 feet), making it shorter than Mount Ossa.\n\nAnother mountain from Greek mythology, Mount Pelion, also located in Thessaly, is mentioned in the context of the Gigantomachy, where the giants were said to have stacked it upon Mount Ossa to challenge the gods on Mount Olympus. However, Mount Pelion is the shortest of the three, with its highest peak at 1,624 meters (5,328 feet).\n\nTherefore, based on their respective elevations, Mount Ossa is the tallest of these historically significant mountains mentioned in relation to the world of the *Iliad*.\n\n<<<Mount Ossa>>>"
