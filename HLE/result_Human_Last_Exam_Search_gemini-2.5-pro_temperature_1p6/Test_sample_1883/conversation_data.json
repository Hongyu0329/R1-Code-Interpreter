    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, which predicts the stereochemical outcome of the reaction. This reaction results in the exclusive formation of the *cis*-isomer (A), with no formation of the *trans*-isomer (B). Therefore, the predicted ratio of A to B is 100:0.\n\n### Theoretical Basis\n\nAccording to FMO theory, the stereochemistry of a thermal electrocyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the polyene. Deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene possesses eight π-electrons, making it a 4n system where n=2. For a 4n π-electron system under thermal conditions, the reaction proceeds through a conrotatory ring closure.\n\nThe ground-state HOMO for an 8π-electron system is ψ₄. This molecular orbital has a C₂ axis of symmetry, meaning the lobes of the p-orbitals at the termini of the conjugated system have opposite signs. To achieve constructive overlap and form a new sigma (σ) bond, the termini must rotate in the same direction—a process known as conrotation.\n\n### Stereochemical Outcome\n\nThe specific stereochemistry of the starting material, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, dictates the stereochemistry of the product.\n\n*   At the C2-C3 double bond (which has *Z* configuration), the methyl group is on the \"inside\" of the carbon chain, and the hydrogen atom is on the \"outside.\"\n*   At the C8-C9 double bond (which has *E* configuration), the methyl group is on the \"outside,\" and the hydrogen atom is on the \"inside.\"\n\nDuring conrotatory closure, both \"outside\" groups (a hydrogen from C2 and a methyl group from C8) rotate to the same face of the newly forming ring. Likewise, the two \"inside\" groups (a methyl group from C2 and a hydrogen from C8) rotate to the opposite face. This results in the two methyl groups being on the same side of the ring in the product, which is the *cis*-isomer, identified as *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene.\n\nThe alternative, a disrotatory closure that would lead to the *trans*-isomer (B), is symmetry-forbidden under thermal conditions for an 8π-electron system.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on Frontier Molecular Orbital theory, the thermal electrocyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene proceeds through a conrotatory ring closure to exclusively form the *cis*-isomer (A). The *trans*-isomer (B) is not formed.\n\n<<<The ratio of A:B is 100:0.>>>"
