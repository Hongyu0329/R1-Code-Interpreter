    "To solve this problem with maximum memory efficiency, we will avoid storing the entire input string. Instead, we will read the input character by character, count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4), and then construct and print the new sum. This approach uses a counting sort algorithm, which is ideal since the set of numbers is small and fixed.\n\nThe most memory-efficient C program uses the smallest possible standard data types for its variables. The logic is as follows:\n1.  Use `getchar()` to read one character at a time from the input stream. This avoids allocating a large buffer for the whole string.\n2.  Use a small array, `counts`, to store the frequency of each number.\n3.  Loop through the counts to print the numbers in non-decreasing order, separated by `+`. A flag is used to ensure no `+` is printed before the very first number.\n\nHere is the C program implementing this logic:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program reads a string representing a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4),\n * and prints the sum with the numbers sorted in non-decreasing order.\n * It is optimized for memory usage by processing the input as a stream\n * and using minimal-size data types for variables.\n */\nint main() {\n    // To store counts for numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. 'unsigned short' is used as\n    // counts can exceed 255 but will be less than 65535.\n    unsigned short counts[4] = {0}; // index 0 for '1', 1 for '2', etc.\n\n    // 'c' must be an int to hold the special EOF (End-of-File) value.\n    int c;\n\n    // A char is sufficient for a boolean flag (0 or 1).\n    char first = 1;\n\n    // Read characters until newline or end-of-file.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++; // Increment count for the corresponding number.\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the sorted sum.\n    char i; // The outer loop for numbers 1-4 fits in a char.\n    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        // The inner loop for the count of each number might exceed 255.\n        unsigned short j;\n        for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++) {\n            if (!first) {\n                putchar('+');\n            }\n            putchar(i + '1');\n            first = 0; // After the first number, set the flag to 0.\n        }\n    }\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory used for variables is calculated by summing the sizes of all local variables declared in the `main` function. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte, `sizeof(unsigned short)` is 2 bytes, and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n\n*   `unsigned short counts[4]`: This array holds four counts. The size is `4 * sizeof(unsigned short)` = `4 * 2` = **8 bytes**.\n*   `int c`: This variable stores the character read by `getchar()`. `getchar()` returns an `int` to accommodate the `EOF` value. The size is `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n*   `char first`: A flag variable that only needs to store 0 or 1. `char` is the smallest data type suitable. The size is `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n*   `char i`: The outer loop counter (from 0 to 3). `char` is sufficient. The size is `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n*   `unsigned short j`: The inner loop counter can go up to approximately 500 (half the maximum input string length). `unsigned short` is appropriate. The size is `sizeof(unsigned short)` = **2 bytes**.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 8 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 16 bytes.\n\n<<<16>>>"
