    "Despite extensive research into the architectural history of the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome, there is no evidence to suggest that a unique architectural feature was removed from the square by the city administration in 1950.\n\nThe Piazza della Rotonda has undergone numerous transformations over the centuries. Significant changes include the commissioning of the central fountain, the Fontana del Pantheon, by Pope Gregory XIII, which was designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1575. In 1711, at the request of Pope Clement XI, an ancient Egyptian obelisk, the Obelisco Macuteo, was added to the fountain's center.\n\nThe area in front of the Pantheon was cleared of medieval shops and sheds by order of Pope Eugenius IV (1431â€“1439) to create the piazza. Later, plans were made to enlarge the square, and some adjacent buildings were demolished under Popes Pius VII and Pius IX in the 19th century.\n\nOne of the most notable architectural alterations involved the Pantheon itself. In the early 17th century, two bell towers, often attributed to the famous architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini, were added to the front of the Pantheon. These towers were widely criticized by the Roman populace, who nicknamed them \"the ass's ears.\" The controversial towers were eventually removed in the late 19th century. Additionally, in 1882, a part of the Palazzo Crescenzi was demolished to widen the street next to the Pantheon.\n\nWhile there were discussions and design competitions for urban development in Rome around the 1950s, such as for the Flaminio district, no sources indicate any specific architectural removal or demolition in the Piazza della Rotonda during that year. Historical records and photographs from the period do not show any significant architectural feature present in the 1940s that was absent in the 1950s.\n\nTherefore, the premise that a unique architectural feature was removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950 appears to be inaccurate based on available historical information.\n\n<<<There is no evidence of a unique architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950.>>>"
