    "The Grigorchuk group, denoted by G, has a rich subgroup structure. To determine the number of subgroups of index 4, we can analyze the possible transitive actions of G on a set of 4 elements. Such an action is defined by a homomorphism from G to the symmetric group S_4. Since the Grigorchuk group is a 2-group (meaning the order of every element is a power of 2), any finite quotient of G must be a 2-group. The transitive subgroups of S_4 that are 2-groups are the Klein four-group V_4 (isomorphic to C_2 x C_2) and the dihedral group D_4 of order 8.\n\n### Normal Subgroups of Index 4\n\nA subgroup of index 4 is normal if and only if the corresponding action's image is abelian (and contains the subgroup as its kernel). In this case, the image must be the Klein four-group V_4. Therefore, the number of normal subgroups of index 4 is the number of epimorphisms (surjective homomorphisms) from G onto V_4, divided by the number of automorphisms of V_4.\n\n1.  The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group G is well-known to be G/[G,G] ≅ (Z/2Z)³. Any homomorphism from G to an abelian group like V_4 must factor through this abelianization.\n2.  We need to count the number of surjective linear maps from a 3-dimensional vector space over the field of 2 elements, F_2³, to a 2-dimensional vector space, F_2². The total number of linear maps is (2²)³ = 64. The maps that are not surjective have an image of dimension 0 (the zero map, 1 of these) or dimension 1 (a line). There are three 1-dimensional subspaces in F_2², and for each, there are 2³-1 = 7 non-zero maps from F_2³ to it. This gives 3 * 7 = 21 non-surjective maps to a line.\n3.  The number of surjective maps is 64 - 1 - 21 = 42.\n4.  The automorphism group of V_4 is the general linear group GL(2, F_2), which has order (2²-1)(2²-2) = 6.\n5.  The number of distinct normal subgroups of index 4 is the number of surjective homomorphisms divided by the order of the automorphism group of the target, which is 42 / 6 = 7.\n\nThus, there are **7** normal subgroups of index 4. Each of these corresponds to the intersection of two distinct maximal subgroups of G.\n\n### Non-normal Subgroups of Index 4\n\nNon-normal subgroups of index 4 arise from transitive actions on 4 elements where the image is the non-abelian group D_4.\n\n1.  It is a known property of the Grigorchuk group that the quotient by the stabilizer of the second level of the binary tree, G/St_G(2), is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_4 of order 8. This provides a surjective homomorphism φ: G → D_4.\n2.  This homomorphism defines a transitive action of G on 4 elements (e.g., the vertices of a square on which D_4 acts). A subgroup of index 4 in G is the stabilizer of a point in this action.\n3.  The stabilizer of a point in G corresponds to the preimage φ⁻¹(K) of a point stabilizer K in D_4. The point stabilizers in the standard action of D_4 are the four non-normal subgroups of order 2, generated by reflections.\n4.  The preimages of these four distinct non-normal subgroups of D_4 are four distinct non-normal subgroups of index 4 in G.\n\nThis gives an additional **4** non-normal subgroups of index 4. The preimage of the center of D_4 is a normal subgroup of G whose quotient is D_4/Z(D_4) ≅ V_4, and is therefore one of the 7 normal subgroups already counted.\n\nAssuming that all transitive representations of G in S_4 with image D_4 are equivalent to the one defined by the quotient G/St_G(2), we have found all subgroups of index 4.\n\nCombining the two cases, the total number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is 7 (normal) + 4 (non-normal) = 11. While some older sources might state there are only 7, this conflicts with the well-established fact that G has a D_4 quotient.\n\n<<<11>>>"
