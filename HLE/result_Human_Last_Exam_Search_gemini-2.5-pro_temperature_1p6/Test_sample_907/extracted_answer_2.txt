**a) The equation for the absorption cross-section with negligible interaction is:**

**σₐ(ω) = N ⋅ [ (4π²ω / (3cε₀ħ)) |μ_eg|² g(ħω - ħω_eg) ]**

Where N is the number of molecules, ω is the light frequency, μ_eg is the monomer transition dipole moment, ħω_eg is the monomer transition energy, and g is the lineshape function. The absorption is centered at the monomer energy.

**b) The equation for the absorption cross-section with near-neighbor interaction is:**

**σ_b(ω) = N ⋅ [ (4π²ω / (3cε₀ħ)) |μ_eg|² g(ħω - (ħω_eg + 2J)) ]**

Where J is the near-neighbor coupling energy. The absorption is centered at a new energy, ħω_eg + 2J, which is shifted from the monomer energy due to the excitonic coupling.
