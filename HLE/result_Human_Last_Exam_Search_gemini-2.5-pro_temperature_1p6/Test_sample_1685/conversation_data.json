    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given ordinary differential equation (ODE) for large values of $x$, we analyze the behavior of each term as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe ODE is given by:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nFor large $x$, we look for the dominant terms that dictate the solution's behavior. The method of dominant balance is a suitable technique for this purpose. This involves identifying the terms in the equation that are the largest and must balance each other out.\n\nLet's analyze each term in the large $x$ regime:\n*   The term $- \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2}$ tends to zero as $x$ becomes large, provided that $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$.\n*   The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$ is an oscillatory term that does not decay as $x \\to \\infty$. For an approximate solution representing the smooth, non-oscillatory behavior, it's a common practice in asymptotic analysis to neglect such forcing terms or replace them by their average value. Let's start by neglecting this term to find the leading-order smooth solution.\n\nThe simplified equation becomes:\n$y''' \\approx y^{4} + y'^{4}$\n\nWe seek an approximate solution of the form $y(x) = A x^{\\alpha}$. Let's find its derivatives:\n$y' = A \\alpha x^{\\alpha - 1}$\n$y'' = A \\alpha (\\alpha - 1) x^{\\alpha - 2}$\n$y''' = A \\alpha (\\alpha - 1) (\\alpha - 2) x^{\\alpha - 3}$\n\nSubstituting these into the simplified ODE yields:\n$A \\alpha (\\alpha - 1) (\\alpha - 2) x^{\\alpha - 3} \\approx (A x^{\\alpha})^{4} + (A \\alpha x^{\\alpha - 1})^{4}$\n$A \\alpha (\\alpha - 1) (\\alpha - 2) x^{\\alpha - 3} \\approx A^{4} x^{4\\alpha} + A^{4} \\alpha^{4} x^{4\\alpha - 4}$\n\nTo satisfy this approximation for large $x$, the dominant term on the left side must balance the dominant term on the right side.\n*   If we assume the solution decays ($\\alpha < 0$), then the term $A^{4} x^{4\\alpha}$ (with a less negative exponent) dominates the right-hand side. We must balance the powers of $x$:\n    $\\alpha - 3 = 4\\alpha \\implies 3\\alpha = -3 \\implies \\alpha = -1$.\nThis is consistent with our assumption that $\\alpha < 0$. With $\\alpha = -1$, the powers of the terms are:\n*   $y'''$: $x^{-4}$\n*   $y^4$: $x^{-4}$\n*   $y'^4$: $x^{-8}$\n\nThe terms $y'''$ and $y^4$ are dominant. Now, we balance their coefficients:\n$A \\alpha (\\alpha - 1) (\\alpha - 2) = A^{4}$\nSubstituting $\\alpha = -1$:\n$A (-1) (-1 - 1) (-1 - 2) = A^{4}$\n$A (-1) (-2) (-3) = A^{4}$\n$-6A = A^4$\n\nThis gives $A^4 + 6A = 0$, which simplifies to $A(A^3 + 6) = 0$. This equation has a non-trivial real solution $A^3 = -6$, so $A = -\\sqrt{6}$.\n\nCalculating the numerical value for A:\n$A \\approx -1.81712$\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $A \\approx -1.82$.\n\nThus, the approximate analytical expression for the solution in the large $x$ regime is:\n$y(x) \\approx -\\frac{1.82}{x}$\n\nThis represents the leading-order non-oscillatory part of the solution. The neglected oscillatory term would introduce bounded fluctuations around this decaying solution. The initial conditions affect the transient behavior but typically not the final asymptotic form for this type of equation.\n\n<<<$-1.82/x$>>>"
