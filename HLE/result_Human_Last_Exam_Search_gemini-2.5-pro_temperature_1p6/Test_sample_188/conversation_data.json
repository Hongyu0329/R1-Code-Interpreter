  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is a problem of information theory and does not require external search. Here is the step-by-step logical deduction:\n\n1.  **Determine the number of unique symbols in the Ching.**\n    *   The Ching's symbols are based on \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has two states: yin and yang.\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (the Five Elements) has five states: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of unique symbols is the product of the number of states: 2 (yinyang) × 5 (wuxing) = 10 unique symbols.\n    *   The Ching can be seen as a text of 9999 symbols, where each symbol is chosen from an alphabet of 10.\n\n2.  **Determine the size of the message's alphabet.**\n    *   The secret message is written using the letters (characters) found in the Shu.\n    *   The Shu is written with \"only 120 most common Chinese characters\".\n    *   This means the alphabet for the secret message consists of 120 unique characters.\n\n3.  **Calculate how many Ching symbols are needed to encode one message character.**\n    *   We need to find the smallest integer number of Ching symbols, let's call it `k`, that can represent at least 120 different possibilities.\n    *   The number of possibilities that can be represented by `k` Ching symbols is 10 raised to the power of `k` (10^k).\n    *   We need to solve for the smallest integer `k` where `10^k ≥ 120`.\n    *   If k = 1, we can represent 10¹ = 10 characters. This is not enough.\n    *   If k = 2, we can represent 10² = 100 characters. This is still not enough.\n    *   If k = 3, we can represent 10³ = 1000 characters. This is sufficient to assign a unique 3-symbol code to each of the 120 characters.\n    *   Therefore, it takes 3 symbols from the Ching to encode one character of the secret message.\n\n4.  **Calculate the maximum length of the message.**\n    *   The Ching provides a total of 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each character of the secret message consumes 3 of these symbols.\n    *   The maximum length of the message is the total number of available symbols divided by the number of symbols required per character.\n    *   Maximum length = 9999 symbols / 3 symbols per character = 3333 characters.\n\nThe information about the Shu containing \"around 3000 characters\" and all the details about computation times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns) are extraneous and not needed for the calculation.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
