    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's fate is sealed by a seemingly innocuous gesture is Quentin Tarantino's 2009 film, *Inglourious Basterds*. However, the detail of the character saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is a misremembering of the actual scene.\n\nThe character who seals his fate is Lieutenant Archie Hicox, a British commando and film critic portrayed by Michael Fassbender. Hicox is part of a covert mission in German-occupied France and is posing as a German officer. His true identity is revealed not on a bus, but in a tense scene that takes place in a basement tavern.\n\nHicox's cover is blown due to a combination of factors, including his unusual German accent and his overly formal manner of speaking. While it is suggested that had he kept his interactions brief, perhaps only with a \"Hello\" and \"Thank you,\" he might have gone unnoticed, his extended and eloquent speech draws suspicion. The definitive and fatal mistake, however, is a simple hand gesture. When ordering three drinks, Hicox uses the British method of raising his index, middle, and ring fingers. A German officer, Major Hellström of the Gestapo, notices this, as the German custom for counting to three is to use the thumb, index, and middle fingers. This subtle cultural difference confirms Hellström's suspicions, leading to a deadly shootout in which Hicox and his fellow spies are killed.\n\nTherefore, while the user's query about a character's fate being sealed by a small mistake in an Oscar-nominated film is accurate in spirit, the specifics of the dialogue and location point directly to this pivotal scene in *Inglourious Basterds*.\n\n<<<Inglourious Basterds>>>"
