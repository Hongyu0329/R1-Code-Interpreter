    "The man Andrei Voznesensky wrote about was Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\nThe poem in question is the libretto for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" which Voznesensky wrote. The opera tells the tragic love story of Rezanov, a Russian chamberlain and explorer, and Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of the San Francisco Presidio.\n\nIn 1806, Rezanov, while on a mission to secure provisions for Russian colonies in Alaska, fell in love with and became engaged to Argüello. He set off for Russia to gain official permission to marry a Catholic but died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807. He was buried there under a stone marker that initially bore no inscription.\n\nThe lines \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" are from the opera, reflecting the decades of uncertainty about his final resting place. Fueled by the immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos\" after its 1981 premiere, renewed interest in Rezanov's story led to the rediscovery and confirmation of his grave's location in the late 1980s.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
