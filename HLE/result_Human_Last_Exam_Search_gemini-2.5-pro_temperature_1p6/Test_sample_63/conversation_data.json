    "In Kurt Vonnegut's novel, *Breakfast of Champions*, the character Mary Alice is described as smiling at a picture of Saint Sebastian, who was \"so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine.\"\n\nSaint Sebastian was a Roman soldier and a Christian martyr. He is often depicted in art tied to a post or tree and pierced with multiple arrows. This imagery led to the description of him resembling a porcupine.\n\nA two-word name that begins with the same letter and aptly describes this figure is \"Suffering Soldier.\"\n\n<<<Suffering Soldier>>>"
