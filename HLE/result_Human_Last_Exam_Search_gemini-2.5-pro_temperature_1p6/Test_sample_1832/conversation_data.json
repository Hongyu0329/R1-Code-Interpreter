    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body with mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which represent the gravitational field in general relativity, are derived from the derivatives of this metric tensor.\n\nIn spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric are:\n\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{tt} = \\frac{M(r-2M)}{r^3}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{rr} = -\\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = -(r-2M)$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi} = -(r-2M)\\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^t_{rt} = \\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\phi\\phi} = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{r\\phi} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\theta\\phi} = \\cot\\theta$\n\nBy counting these distinct non-zero components, we find there are 9 of them.\n\n<<<9>>>"
