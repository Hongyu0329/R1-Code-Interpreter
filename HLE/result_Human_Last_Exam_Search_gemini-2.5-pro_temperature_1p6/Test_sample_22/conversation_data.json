    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score, measured by the proportion of variance it explains (R²), is theoretically limited by the SNP heritability of the phenotype. SNP heritability represents the total proportion of phenotypic variance that can be accounted for by all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\n\nIn practice, the variance explained by a polygenic score is almost always lower than the SNP heritability. This discrepancy arises from several factors, including:\n*   Errors in the estimation of SNP effect sizes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS).\n*   Differences in genetic and environmental factors between the sample used to create the score and the sample it's applied to.\n*   The fact that current polygenic scores do not yet capture all relevant genetic variants.\n\nFor instance, one study noted that for ADHD, the SNP heritability is 21.6%, whereas the polygenic score explains a maximum of 5.5% of the variance in the condition. While there are some rare instances and specific analytical conditions where the calculated R² of a polygenic score might exceed the estimated SNP heritability, the latter is consistently referred to as the theoretical upper boundary for the predictive power of a polygenic score.\n\n<<<True>>>"
