    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium) and TMEDA (tetramethylethylenediamine) in THF (tetrahydrofuran), followed by the addition of methyl iodide, yields **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThis transformation is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n\n1.  **Directed ortho-Metalation:** The first step involves the deprotonation of the aromatic ring. Both the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) and the N,N-dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) are effective directing metalation groups (DMGs). These groups coordinate to the lithium ion of the sec-BuLi, which is made more reactive by the chelating ligand TMEDA. This coordination directs the strong base to selectively remove a proton from an adjacent (*ortho*) position on the benzene ring.\n    *   The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group at position 1 directs the deprotonation to position 2 or 6.\n    *   The N,N-dimethylamino group at position 3 directs the deprotonation to position 2 or 4.\n\n    Since both groups direct the metalation to the C2 position, this site is synergistically activated, making it the most acidic and reactive proton on the ring. The result is the formation of a lithiated intermediate specifically at the C2 position.\n\n2.  **Alkylation:** The newly formed aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile. In the second step, it reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH₃I). The carbanionic carbon at the C2 position attacks the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\nThe final result is the methylation of the benzene ring at the position ortho to the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group and also ortho to the N,N-dimethylamino group.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
