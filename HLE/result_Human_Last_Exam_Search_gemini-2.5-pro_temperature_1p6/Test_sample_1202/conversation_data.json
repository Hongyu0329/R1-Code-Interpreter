    "After a gene duplication event, the two gene copies are initially redundant. This redundancy means that one copy is often free from the selective pressure that maintained the original gene. Without this pressure, a duplicate gene faces several possible fates. The most common outcome is **pseudogenization**, where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene. This, however, leads to the loss of the duplicate, not its retention.\n\nTwo primary mechanisms explain how both copies can be retained and diverge in the genome: neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** is a process where one gene copy mutates to acquire a novel function, while the other copy retains the original ancestral function. This is an adaptive process that requires a beneficial mutation, which is a relatively rare event. The new, advantageous function ensures the preservation of the mutated copy.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization** occurs when an ancestral gene has multiple functions or expression patterns (a condition known as pleiotropy). After duplication, each gene copy accumulates mutations that degrade different sub-functions. As a result, both genes are required to carry out the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene performed. This \"division of labor\" makes both copies essential for the organism's fitness, leading to their retention. This process, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, can proceed through neutral or near-neutral mutations, which are more common than the selectively advantageous mutations required for neofunctionalization.\n\n*   **Gene conversion** is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange that tends to homogenize the sequences of duplicated genes. This action counteracts divergence and is therefore not the primary mechanism responsible for both the retention and *divergence* of duplicate genes.\n\n*   **Adaptive radiation** is a macroevolutionary process describing the rapid diversification of a single ancestral species into many new forms, often occurring when new environments or niches become available. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material for the evolutionary adaptations seen in adaptive radiation, it is a species-level phenomenon, not a direct molecular mechanism governing the fate of individual genes within a genome.\n\nComparing neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization, the latter is often considered the more likely initial mechanism for preserving duplicate genes. Because it can be driven by the accumulation of common, complementary loss-of-function mutations, subfunctionalization provides a more immediate pathway to protect both gene copies from the more probable fate of pseudogenization. Neofunctionalization, while a crucial source of evolutionary novelty, relies on rarer beneficial mutations. Some evolutionary models even suggest that subfunctionalization can act as a transitional state, preserving duplicates for longer evolutionary periods, which in turn increases the chance for neofunctionalization to eventually occur.\n\nTherefore, subfunctionalization is the mechanism most likely responsible for the widespread retention and initial divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
