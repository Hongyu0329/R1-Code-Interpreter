    "The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **pterodactyladiene**.\n\nThis uniquely named molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with the chemical formula C₂₂H₁₂. Its name is derived from the pterodactyl, a genus of pterosaurs that lived during the Late Jurassic period and went extinct around 66 million years ago. The structure of pterodactyladiene, when drawn in a specific orientation, is said to resemble the silhouette of a pterodactyl in flight.\n\nThe synthesis and characterization of pterodactyladiene were first reported by chemists as a novel PAH with interesting electronic and photophysical properties. Its unusual name places it among a variety of chemical compounds that have been given whimsical or descriptive monikers based on their shape or origin. While the name is playful, the molecule itself is a subject of serious study in the fields of organic chemistry and materials science for its potential applications in electronic devices and as a molecular building block.\n\n<<<pterodactyladiene>>>"
