The highest concentration of an individual chemical reaching the spring is Atrazine, with a peak concentration of 0.00147 μg/L. The effect of the chemical mixture at this concentration is assumed to be additive, and based on a Toxic Unit analysis (ΣTU = 0.000015), the effect is negligible and poses no risk to the protected algal community.
