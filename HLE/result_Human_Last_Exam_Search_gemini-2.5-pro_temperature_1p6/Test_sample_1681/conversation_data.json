    "In the quantum formulation of the prisoner's dilemma, the classical game is extended by allowing players to use quantum strategies, which can lead to different and often better outcomes. The equilibrium point of the game is critically dependent on the initial state of the qubits shared by the players.\n\n### Game Setup and Optimal Initial State\n\nTo resolve the classic dilemma, the game is set up using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. The two players, Alice and Bob, share an initial two-qubit quantum state. To achieve an optimal outcome, this initial state is designed to be **maximally entangled**. This entanglement is what links the players' choices in a way not possible in the classical game, enabling new strategic possibilities.\n\n### Player Strategies\n\nIn the classical game with the given payoff matrix, the strategies are Cooperate (C) and Defect (D). A rational player will always choose to defect, leading to the Nash equilibrium of (Defect, Defect) with a suboptimal payoff of (1, 1).\n\nIn the quantum version, these classical strategies are represented by specific quantum operations (unitary matrices). However, players have access to a broader set of quantum strategies. A crucial quantum strategy, often denoted as **Q**, emerges. This strategy is defined by the unitary matrix:\n\nQ = [[i, 0], [0, -i]]\n\n### The Quantum Equilibrium\n\nWhen the game starts with a maximally entangled state, a new, stable Nash Equilibrium becomes available. This equilibrium occurs when both players choose the quantum strategy **(Q, Q)**.\n\nAt this (Q, Q) equilibrium:\n*   Neither player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy. If Alice chooses Q, Bob's best response is also Q, and vice-versa.\n*   The outcome of this joint strategy is that both players cooperate with full probability.\n*   This circumvents the classical dilemma where individual self-interest leads to mutual defection.\n\nFor the payoff matrix you provided, `[[(5,5), (0,7)], [(7,0), (1,1)]]`, the (Q, Q) equilibrium point yields the payoff associated with mutual cooperation (C, C).\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium point in this quantum game is the strategy pair **(Q, Q)**, which results in the Pareto optimal payoff of **(5, 5)**.\n\n<<<**(5, 5)**>>>"
