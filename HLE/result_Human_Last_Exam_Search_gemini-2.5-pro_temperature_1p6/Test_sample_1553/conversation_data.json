    "The main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" Adam Zamoyski, marries a woman named Angelika.\n\nThroughout the novel, Angelika is often referred to as Adam's companion. They are frequently depicted together, including being trapped in a \"Sak\" and landing on the planet Narwa. One analysis of the book explicitly mentions \"Adam's future wife\" and the connection between Adam and Angelika, suggesting their eventual marriage. Another review also notes Zamoyski's success with the opposite sex and mentions Angelika as a significant female character.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
