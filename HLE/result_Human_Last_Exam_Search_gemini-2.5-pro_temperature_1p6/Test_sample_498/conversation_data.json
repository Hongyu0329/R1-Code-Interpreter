    "The sequence of letters \"ZXXCVYBN_\" is based on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard. A typical QWERTY keyboard's bottom row of letters is Z, X, C, V, B, N, M. The provided sequence largely follows this order.\n\nThe inclusion of an extra \"X\" and a \"Y\" in the submitted sequence, \"ZXXCVYBN_\", appears to be a typographical error. When disregarding these anomalies, the pattern points to a simple progression along the bottom row of the keyboard from left to right.\n\nTherefore, the letter that should appear next in the sequence is \"M\".\n\n<<<M>>>"
