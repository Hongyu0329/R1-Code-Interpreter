    "The partition function, Z, in the grand canonical ensemble is a fundamental quantity in statistical mechanics that describes the statistical properties of a system in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a reservoir. It is given by the trace (Tr) of the operator e<sup>-β(H^ - μN^)</sup>, where H^ is the Hamiltonian of the system, μ is the chemical potential, N^ is the particle number operator, and β is the inverse temperature (1/k<sub>B</sub>T).\n\n<<<For a system with the specific Hamiltonian H^ = -μN^, the partition function Z is given by:\n\nZ = Tr[e<sup>-β(H^ - μN^)</sup>]\n\nSubstituting the given Hamiltonian into this equation:\n\nZ = Tr[e<sup>-β(-μN^ - μN^)</sup>] = Tr[e<sup>-β(-2μN^)</sup>] = Tr[e<sup>2βμN^</sup>]\n\nTo express this in the language of path integrals, we consider the action of the system. The path integral formulation for the grand canonical partition function is written as a functional integral over fields ψ(*x*, τ), where τ is the imaginary time from 0 to β. The general form of the action S in the exponent is:\n\nS = ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ψ*(**x**,τ) (∂<sub>τ</sub> + H' - μ) ψ(**x**,τ)\n\nHere, H' represents the single-particle Hamiltonian operator. In the specific case provided, the total Hamiltonian is given as H^ = -μN^. In the second quantization formalism, the particle number operator N^ is ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ψ*(**x**,τ)ψ(**x**,τ). Therefore, the Hamiltonian density corresponding to the given H^ is -μψ*ψ.\n\nSubstituting this into the action for the grand canonical ensemble, we replace H' with -μψ*ψ:\n\nS = ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x [ψ*(**x**,τ)∂<sub>τ</sub>ψ(**x**,τ) + (-μψ*(**x**,τ)ψ(**x**,τ)) - μψ*(**x**,τ)ψ(**x**,τ)]\n\nSimplifying the expression within the integral gives:\n\nS = ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x [ψ*(**x**,τ)∂<sub>τ</sub>ψ(**x**,τ) - 2μψ*(**x**,τ)ψ(**x**,τ)]\n\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n\nS = ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ψ*(**x**,τ) (∂<sub>τ</sub> - 2μ) ψ(**x**,τ)\n\nThe partition function Z is the functional integral over all possible field configurations, weighted by e<sup>-S</sup>:\n\nZ = ∫ D[ψ*,ψ] e<sup>-S</sup>\n\nThus, the partition function for the given system in the path integral formulation is:\n\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ*,ψ] exp[- ∫₀<sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ψ*(x,τ)(∂<sub>τ</sub> - 2μ)ψ(x,τ)]**\n\nThe fields ψ and ψ* are complex functions for bosons and Grassmann variables for fermions. The integral is performed with the boundary condition that the fields are periodic (for bosons) or anti-periodic (for fermions) in the imaginary time variable τ, with period β.>>>"
