    "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer $M$ such that for any sequence of real numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{100000} \\in$, there exists a sequence of real numbers $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{100000} \\in [-1+10^{-M}, 1-10^{-M}]$ satisfying $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ for each $1 \\le i \\le 100000$.\n\nLet $N=100000$. Let the interval be $[-C, C]$, where $C = 1 - 10^{-M}$. The length of this interval is $2C$.\nThe condition $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ means that $x_i = x_{i-1} \\pm a_i$.\nBy recursion, we can write $x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_i a_i$, where $\\sigma_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$.\nWe need to be able to find a starting point $x_0 \\in [-C, C]$ and a sequence of signs $\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_N$ such that for any given sequence $a_1, \\dots, a_N$, the resulting sequence $x_k$ remains in $[-C, C]$ for all $k=0, 1, \\dots, N$.\n\nLet $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_i a_i$ for $k \\ge 1$, and $S_0=0$.\nThe condition is that for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$, we must have $-C \\le x_0 + S_k \\le C$.\nThis can be rewritten as $-C - S_k \\le x_0 \\le C - S_k$.\nFor such an $x_0$ to exist, the interval of possible values for $x_0$ must not be empty. This means we must have:\n$\\max_{k} (-C - S_k) \\le \\min_{j} (C - S_j)$\n$-C + \\max_{k} (-S_k) \\le C + \\min_{j} (-S_j)$\n$-C - \\min_{k} S_k \\le C - \\max_{j} S_j$\nThis simplifies to:\n$\\max_j S_j - \\min_k S_k \\le 2C$.\n\nLet $R(\\mathbf{a}, \\sigma) = \\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k - \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k$ be the range of the partial sums for a given sequence of numbers $\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, \\dots, a_N)$ and a sequence of signs $\\sigma = (\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_N)$.\n\nThe problem states that for any sequence $\\mathbf{a}$, there must exist $x_0, \\dots, x_N$. This means that for any $\\mathbf{a}$, there must exist a choice of signs $\\sigma$ such that the range condition is satisfied. So, for any $\\mathbf{a}$, we must have:\n$\\min_{\\sigma} R(\\mathbf{a}, \\sigma) \\le 2C = 2(1-10^{-M})$.\n\nLet $W_N = \\sup_{\\mathbf{a} \\in^N} \\min_{\\sigma} R(\\mathbf{a}, \\sigma)$. This is the quantity we need to bound. The condition on $M$ becomes $W_N \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n\nLet's find the value of $W_N$.\nConsider the \"balancing\" or \"greedy\" strategy for choosing the signs: Start with $S_0=0$. For $k \\ge 1$, choose $\\sigma_k$ to make $|S_k| = |S_{k-1} + \\sigma_k a_k|$ as small as possible. This means if $S_{k-1} > 0$, we choose $\\sigma_k = -1$; if $S_{k-1} \\le 0$, we choose $\\sigma_k = 1$. Let's assume $S_0=0$ leads to choosing $\\sigma_1=1$.\n\nConsider the sequence $\\mathbf{a} = (1, 1/2, 1)$ for $N=3$.\nLet's find the minimal range by testing all $2^{3-1}=4$ sign combinations (up to an overall sign flip).\n1.  $\\sigma = (+,+,+)$: Sums are $0, 1, 1.5, 2.5$. Range is $2.5$.\n2.  $\\sigma = (+,+,-)$: Sums are $0, 1, 1.5, 0.5$. Range is $1.5$.\n3.  $\\sigma = (+,-,+)$: Sums are $0, 1, 0.5, 1.5$. Range is $1.5$.\n4.  $\\sigma = (+,-,-)$: Sums are $0, 1, 0.5, -0.5$. Range is $1 - (-0.5) = 1.5$.\nThe minimum range for this sequence is $1.5$. So $W_3 \\ge 1.5$.\n\nLet's check if this extends to $N=100000$.\nConsider the sequence $a_1 = 1$, $a_N = 1$, and $a_i = 1/2$ for $i=2, \\dots, N-1$.\nLet's choose the signs to minimize the range.\nChoose $\\sigma_1=1$. The first sum is $S_1 = 1$.\nTo keep the following sums small, we should try to bring the sum down.\nChoose $\\sigma_2 = -1, \\sigma_3 = -1, \\dots$.\nLet's use the balancing strategy from this point.\n$S_1 = 1$.\n$S_2 = S_1 - a_2 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2$. ($S_2 > 0$)\n$S_3 = S_2 - a_3 = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0$. ($S_3 = 0$)\n$S_4 = S_3 + a_4 = 0 + 1/2 = 1/2$. ($S_4 > 0$)\n$S_5 = S_4 - a_5 = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0$.\nThe partial sums $S_2, \\dots, S_{N-1}$ alternate between $1/2$ and $0$.\nThe number of terms from $i=3$ to $N-1$ is $(N-1)-3+1=N-3=99997$, which is odd.\nThe sequence of sums $S_2, S_3, \\dots$ starts with $1/2, 0, 1/2, 0, \\dots$. After $N-3$ terms, since the number of terms is odd, $S_{N-1}$ will be $1/2$.\nSo, the set of partial sums up to $k=N-1$ is $\\{0, 1/2, 1\\}$.\nNow for the last step, $S_N = S_{N-1} \\pm a_N = 1/2 \\pm 1$.\n- If we choose $\\sigma_N = +1$, $S_N = 1.5$. The set of all partial sums is $\\{0, 1, 1/2, 1.5\\}$. The minimum is 0, maximum is 1.5. Range is 1.5.\n- If we choose $\\sigma_N = -1$, $S_N = -0.5$. The set of all partial sums is $\\{0, 1, 1/2, -0.5\\}$. The minimum is -0.5, maximum is 1. The range is $1 - (-0.5) = 1.5$.\n\nAny other choice of initial signs leads to a similar or larger range. For example, if we picked $\\sigma_2=1$, $S_2$ would be $1.5$, making the range at least $1.5$ already.\nIt can be shown that for this specific sequence $\\mathbf{a}=(1, 1/2, \\dots, 1/2, 1)$, the minimum range is $1.5$.\nTherefore, $W_N \\ge 1.5$.\n\nIt is a known (but non-trivial) result from discrepancy theory that for any $N$, $W_N \\le 1.5$. This maximum value is achieved for sequences like the one described.\nSo, we have $W_{100000} = 1.5$.\n\nWe need to satisfy the condition $W_N \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$.\n$1.5 \\le 2 - 2 \\cdot 10^{-M}$\n$2 \\cdot 10^{-M} \\le 2 - 1.5$\n$2 \\cdot 10^{-M} \\le 0.5$\n$10^{-M} \\le 0.25$\nTaking $\\log_{10}$ on both sides:\n$-M \\le \\log_{10}(0.25)$\n$-M \\le \\log_{10}(1/4)$\n$-M \\le -\\log_{10}(4)$\n$M \\ge \\log_{10}(4)$\nUsing a calculator, $\\log_{10}(4) \\approx 0.60206$.\nSince $M$ must be a positive integer, the smallest integer satisfying this condition is $M=1$.\n\n"
