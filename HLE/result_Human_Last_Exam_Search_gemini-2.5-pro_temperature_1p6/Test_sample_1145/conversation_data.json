    "The probability of finding the particle in the 1D box in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the n=2 state is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the result:\n\n1.  **Wave Function and Probability Density:**\n    For a particle in a one-dimensional box of length *a*, the normalized wave function for the n-th energy state is given by:\n    *ψₙ(x) = √(2/a) sin(nπx/a)*.\n\n    For the n=2 state, the wave function is:\n    *ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) sin(2πx/a)*.\n\n    The probability density, *|ψ₂(x)|²*, which represents the probability of finding the particle per unit length, is:\n    *|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) sin²(2πx/a)*.\n\n2.  **Probability Calculation:**\n    The probability *P* of finding the particle in a specific interval [*x₁*, *x₂*] is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    *P = ∫ [from x₁ to x₂] |ψ₂(x)|² dx*\n\n    For the interval [0.495a, 0.505a], the integral is:\n    *P = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx*\n\n3.  **Approximation Method:**\n    The specified interval is very small (width Δx = 0.01a) and is centered around *x = 0.5a*. For the n=2 state, *x = 0.5a* is a node, a point where the wave function is zero. This means the probability density at the exact center of the interval is zero. Therefore, a simple approximation using the center value would incorrectly yield a probability of zero.\n\n    A more accurate approach is to approximate the `sin²` function near the node. Let *x = 0.5a + δx*, where *δx* is a small displacement. The argument of the sine function becomes:\n    *2πx/a = 2π(0.5a + δx)/a = π + 2πδx/a*\n\n    Using the identity *sin(π + θ) = -sin(θ)*, and the small-angle approximation *sin(θ) ≈ θ*, we get:\n    *sin(2πx/a) = -sin(2πδx/a) ≈ -2πδx/a*\n\n    The probability density can then be approximated as:\n    *|ψ₂(x)|² ≈ (2/a) * (-2πδx/a)² = (8π²/a³) (δx)²*\n\n4.  **Integration:**\n    Now, we integrate this approximated function over the interval where *δx* ranges from -0.005a to +0.005a:\n    *P ≈ ∫ [from -0.005a to +0.005a] (8π²/a³) (δx)² d(δx)*\n\n    Evaluating the integral gives:\n    *P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [ (δx)³/3 ]* (from -0.005a to 0.005a)\n    *P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [ (0.005a)³/3 - (-0.005a)³/3 ]*\n    *P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [ 2 * (0.005)³ * a³ / 3 ]*\n    *P ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³*\n\n5.  **Final Result:**\n    Plugging in the value for π ≈ 3.14159:\n    *P ≈ (16 * (3.14159)² / 3) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)*\n    *P ≈ (52.638) * (1.25 x 10⁻⁷)*\n    *P ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶*\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
