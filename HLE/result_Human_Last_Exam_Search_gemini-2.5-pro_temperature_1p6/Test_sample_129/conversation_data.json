    "This problem requires a systematic enumeration of all possible valid boolean expressions of exactly five symbols that evaluate to true. The symbols are T, F, !, &, |, (, ).\n\nHere is a systematic breakdown of the expressions, categorized by their structure:\n\n### Category 1: Expressions without Parentheses (29 total)\n\nThese expressions are formed by combining literals (T, F) and operators. Due to operator precedence (! > & > |), the structure is unambiguous.\n\n*   **Expressions with `|` and `&` (18 expressions):** These are of the form `A op B op C`.\n    *   `A|B|C`: True unless all three are `F`. (2Â³ - 1 = 7 expressions)\n    *   `A&B&C`: True only if all three are `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `A|B&C` (parsed as `A|(B&C)`): True if `A` is `T` (4 cases), or if `A` is `F` and `B&C` is `T` (1 case). (5 expressions)\n    *   `A&B|C` (parsed as `(A&B)|C)`: True if `C` is `T` (4 cases), or if `C` is `F` and `A&B` is `T` (1 case). (5 expressions)\n*   **Expressions with `!` (11 expressions):**\n    *   `!!!!A`: `!!!!T` is the only true expression. (1 expression)\n    *   `!!A|B`: `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T` are true. (3 expressions)\n    *   `!!A&B`: `!!T&T` is true. (1 expression)\n    *   `A|!!B`: `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T` are true. (3 expressions)\n    *   `A&!!B`: `T&!!T`, `T&!!F` are true. (2 expressions)\n*   **Expressions with `!` on both operands (4 expressions):**\n    *   `!A|!B`: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` are true. (3 expressions)\n    *   `!A&!B`: `!F&!F` is true. (1 expression)\n\n### Category 2: Expressions with Parentheses (16 total)\n\nThese expressions use parentheses to group sub-expressions.\n\n*   **Innermost unit is a literal (2 expressions):**\n    *   `((T))`: True. (1 expression)\n    *   `((!F))`: True. (1 expression)\n*   **Innermost unit is a simple operation (8 expressions):**\n    *   `(A op B)`: `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `(T&T)`. (4 expressions)\n    *   `!(A op B)`: `!(F|F)`, `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)`. (4 expressions)\n*   **Expressions with `!` and parentheses (6 expressions):**\n    *   `(!!T)`: True. (1 expression)\n    *   `(!(!T))`: True. (1 expression)\n    *   `!(!!F)`: True. (1 expression)\n    *   `!(T&F)` (This form was listed under `!(A op B)`).\n    *   `(!F&T)`: True. (1 expression)\n    *   `(!F|T)`: True. (1 expression)\n    *   `(!F|F)`: True. (1 expression)\n\nLet's consolidate and re-tally the parenthesized expressions to avoid double counting.\n\nA clearer categorization for parenthesized expressions:\n1.  `(A)` where `A` is a true expression of length 3: `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `(T&T)`, `(!!T)`, `((T))`. Total: **6**\n2.  `!(A)` where `A` is a false expression of length 3: `!(F|F)`, `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)`, `!(!!F)`, `!((F))`. The last one, `!((F))`, has a length of 6, so it's excluded. Total: **5**\n3.  `(!A)` where `!A` evaluates to True and has length 3. This means `A` has length 2 and is False. The only length 2 false expression is `!T`. So `(!T)` is a length 3 false expression. There is no true expression of the form `(!A)` with length 3.\n4. `(A op B)` where the total length is 5.\n    - `(T&!F)` (length 6) - incorrect.\n    - `(!A op B)` forms like `(!F|T)` - These are valid expressions without extra parentheses because `!` has high precedence. `(!F|T)` is length 4. `(!F)|T` would also be length 4.\n\nAfter a careful recount of distinct valid strings:\n*   **No parentheses**: 32 expressions (re-summing the initial breakdown gives: 7+1+5+5=18. Then 1+3+1+3+2=10. Then 3+1=4. Total = 18+10+4 = 32)\n*   **With parentheses**:\n    *   `(A|B)`, `(A&B)` forms: `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `(T&T)`. (4)\n    *   `((T))`, `((!F))`, `(!!T)`, `(!(!T))`. (4)\n    *   `!(F|F)`, `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)`. (4)\n    *   `(!F&T)`,`(!F|T)`,`(!F|F)`. This calculation seems faulty as `(!F&T)` is length 5. Let's write it: `(`, `!`, `F`, `&`, `T`, `)`. Length 6. So these forms are invalid.\n\nFinal Tally:\n*   Unparenthesized: 32\n*   Parenthesized `(A op B)`: 4 (`(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `(T&T)`)\n*   Parenthesized `!(A op B)`: 4 (`!(F|F)`, `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)`)\n*   Parenthesized `((A))`: 1 `((T))`\n*   Parenthesized with `!`: `(!!T)` (1), `((!F))` (1), `!(!T)` (invalid length 4), `(!(!T))` (1), `!(!!F)` (1). Total of 4.\n\nThe total is 32 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 45.\n\nLet me list the 14 distinct parenthesized expressions to be certain.\n1. `(T|T)`\n2. `(T|F)`\n3. `(F|T)`\n4. `(T&T)`\n5. `!(F|F)`\n6. `!(T&F)`\n7. `!(F&T)`\n8. `!(F&F)`\n9. `((T))`\n10. `(!!T)`\n11. `((!F))` - Same as `(T)` effectively, but `((!F))` is 5 symbols.\n12. `(!(!T))`\n13. `!(!!F)`\n14. There seems to be overlap in my thinking. `(!!T)` and `((!F))` are strings of 5 symbols. Let's count again.\n\nMy analysis of L5 = `(L3_True)` -> 6 expressions `(T|T), (T|F), (F|T), (T&T), (!!T), ((T))` seems sound.\nMy analysis of L5 = `!(L3_False)` -> 5 expressions `!(F|F), !(T&F), !(F&T), !(F&F), !(!!F)` is also sound.\nTotal parenthesized: 6 + 5 = 11.\n\nTotal non-parenthesized = 32.\nTotal = 32 + 11 = 43.\n\nLet's double-check the \"no parentheses\" `!A op !B` again. `!T|!F`. String is `!`, `T`, `|`, `!`, `F`. Length 5. Precedence `(!T)|(!F)` -> `F|T` -> T. These are valid. So the count of 32 seems correct.\n\nTotal is 32 + 11 = 43.\n\nFinal list of patterns and counts:\n*   Unparenthesized:\n    *   `A op B op C`: 18\n    *   `!!A op B` / `A op !!B`: 3+1+3+2 = 9\n    *   `!A op !B`: 3+1 = 4\n    *   `!!!!A`: 1\n    *   Total: 18+9+4+1 = 32\n*   Parenthesized:\n    *   `(L3_True)`: 6\n    *   `!(L3_False)`: 5\n    *   Total: 11\n\nTotal expressions = 32 + 11 = 43.\n\n<<<43>>>"
