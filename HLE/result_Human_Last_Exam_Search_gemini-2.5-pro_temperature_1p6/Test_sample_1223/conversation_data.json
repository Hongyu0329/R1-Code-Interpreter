    "I have gathered definitions for the key terms: \"hereditary indecomposable metric continuum,\" \"composant,\" and \"Stone-Cech compactification.\"\n\nA **hereditary indecomposable metric continuum** is a compact, connected metric space where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. An indecomposable continuum cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n\nA **composant** of a point p in a continuum A is the union of all proper subcontinua of A that contain p. In an indecomposable continuum, the-composants are pairwise disjoint and dense.\n\nThe **Stone-Cech compactification** of a topological space X, denoted βX, is the largest compact Hausdorff space containing X as a dense subspace. The **Stone-Cech remainder** is the set βX \\ X.\n\nI need to find the maximum possible number of a specific type of subset (composants) within this remainder space, which itself is constructed from a space with particular topological properties. My initial searches have not directly answered this question. I need to find resources that specifically discuss the structure of the Stone-Cech remainder of a hereditarily indecomposable continuum, and more specifically, the number of its-composants.\n\nI will update my plan to focus on finding this specific information.I have gathered more specific information. The Stone-Cech remainder of a locally compact, non-compact space like $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a compact continuum. For certain spaces, such as the half-line $[0, \\infty)$, the Stone-Cech remainder is an indecomposable continuum. I found a result stating that under the Continuum Hypothesis, the Stone-Cech remainder of the half-line has $2^c$ composants, where $c$ is the cardinality of the continuum. Another result mentions that for a metrizable indecomposable continuum, the number of-composants is $c$.\n\nThe space $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact, non-compact metric space. Its Stone-Cech remainder, let's call it $X^*$, is a compact continuum. The key is to determine if $X^*$ is indecomposable and, if so, how many-composants it has. I found a paper stating that the Stone-Cech remainder of a certain type of space (a \"wave\") is an indecomposable continuum, and the number of its-composants is axiom-dependent, being one under the axiom of Near Coherence of Filters (NCF) and having coastal points (related to the structure of-composants) under other set-theoretic assumptions.\n\nHowever, I have not yet found a direct theorem that states the maximum possible number of-composants for the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ for *any* hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$. The results for the half-line are suggestive but might not be general enough. I need to synthesize the information and see if I can draw a conclusion or if more specific research is needed. I believe I am close to having enough information to formulate a well-reasoned answer, but I will perform one more targeted search to confirm.After a thorough review of the search results, I can synthesize the following points to construct the final answer.\n\nFirst, let's establish the nature of the space in question. The space $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact, non-compact, separable metric space. Its Stone-Cech remainder, which we'll denote as $X^*$, is a compact Hausdorff space. It is known that for certain spaces, like the half-line $[0, \\infty)$, the Stone-Cech remainder is an indecomposable continuum. Given that a hereditary indecomposable continuum is a highly \"indecomposable\" space, it is plausible that the remainder $X^*$ is also indecomposable.\n\nThe number of composants in a metric indecomposable continuum is the cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. If the Stone-Cech remainder $X^*$ were a metric indecomposable continuum, this would be the answer. However, Stone-Cech remainders of non-compact, locally compact metric spaces are generally not metrizable.\n\nFor non-metrizable indecomposable continua, the number of-composants can vary. There exist non-metrizable indecomposable continua with only one or two-composants. However, it is also possible to construct indecomposable continua with a very large number of-composants. Specifically, for any infinite cardinal number $\\alpha$, there exists an indecomposable continuum with $2^\\alpha$-composants.\n\nThe key is to connect this with the Stone-Cech remainder. A result by Bellamy, later extended by Gordh, shows that every metric continuum is a retract of some metric indecomposable continuum. More generally, any Hausdorff continuum is a retract of an indecomposable continuum with $2^c$-composants, where c is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nLet's consider the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. The Stone-Cech remainder $Y^*$ is a continuum. We need to determine the maximum possible number of-composants of $Y^*$.\n\nA relevant result states that the Stone-Cech remainder of the real line has a family of $2^c$ mutually non-homeomorphic subcontinua. This suggests that the remainder can be quite complex.\n\nA paper by Michel Smith shows that for any infinite cardinal $\\alpha$, there is an indecomposable continuum with $2^\\alpha$ composants. The same paper indicates that a certain constructed indecomposable continuum, $M_{\\omega_1}$, has $2^{\\aleph_1}$ composants, and its cardinality is at most $c^{\\aleph_1} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_1} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_1} = 2^{\\aleph_1}$. The number of-composants is stated to be at least $2^{\\aleph_1}$. The paper mentions that the continuum $M_{\\omega_1}$ could have $c$ or $2^c$ or other numbers of-composants depending on the axioms of set theory, but the construction allows for a very large number of-composants.\n\nAnother result shows that for any non-metric continuum $Y$, there is an indecomposable continuum $M$ with $2^{w(Y)}$ composants, where $w(Y)$ is the weight of $Y$.\n\nLet's consider the weight of the Stone-Cech remainder. For a separable metric space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, the weight of $\\beta Y$ is $2^c$. The weight of the remainder $Y^*$ is also $2^c$. Therefore, it is possible to have an indecomposable continuum with $2^{2^c}$ composants.\n\nWhile the exact number of-composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of a general hereditary indecomposable continuum minus a point is not explicitly stated in a single theorem, the body of research strongly points to the possibility of a very large number of-composants, dependent on set-theoretic axioms and the specific structure of the continuum.\n\nThe work of Shelah has shown that the number of autohomeomorphisms of $\\beta \\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\mathbb{N}$ is axiom-dependent. Similarly, the number of-composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of the half-line is axiom-dependent, being 1 under NCF and larger otherwise.\n\nConsidering that for any infinite cardinal $\\alpha$, an indecomposable continuum with $2^\\alpha$-composants can be constructed, and the remainder itself is a continuum, the maximum possible number of-composants is likely tied to the cardinality of the space of all subsets of the remainder. The cardinality of the Stone-Cech remainder of a separable non-compact locally compact space is $2^c$. Let this remainder be $Y^*$. The number of subsets of $Y^*$ is $2^{|Y^*|} = 2^{2^c}$.\n\nGiven that Michel Smith's result allows for the construction of an indecomposable continuum with $2^\\alpha$ composants for any infinite cardinal $\\alpha$, we can consider the cardinal to be the cardinality of the continuum itself. The Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a continuum of cardinality $2^c$. It has been shown that there exist indecomposable continua with $2^c$ composants. Therefore, it is plausible that the Stone-Cech remainder can have this many-composants. The question asks for the *maximum possible* number. Given the constructions available in the literature that produce a vast number of-composants, limited by set-theoretic considerations, and the fact that for any cardinal $\\alpha$ an indecomposable continuum with $2^\\alpha$ -composants can be constructed, it is reasonable to conclude that the maximum number of-composants could be as high as the cardinality of the continuum allows, which is $2^c$. Some sources even suggest the possibility of $2^{2^c}$ composants for a related structure. However, the most consistently cited upper bound for the number of-composants in a metric indecomposable continuum is $c$, and for non-metric ones, it's often related to $2^\\alpha$ where $\\alpha$ is a cardinal associated with the space. For a general non-metric indecomposable continuum, the number of-composants can be $2^c$. This seems to be the most reliable upper bound found.\n\nFinal consideration: A result states that for any non-metric continuum $Y$, there is an indecomposable continuum with $2^{w(Y)}$ composants, where $w(Y)$ is the weight of $Y$. For $Y = (X\\setminus\\{x\\})^*$, the weight is $c$. Thus, it is possible to have an indecomposable continuum with $2^c$ composants. The question then is whether the Stone-Cech remainder can be such a continuum. The literature on the Stone-Cech remainder of the half-line, which is also an indecomposable continuum, showing that it can have a large number of-composants (e.g., $2^c$ under CH) supports this. Therefore, $2^c$ is a strong candidate for the maximum possible number of-composants.\n\nFinal check on the provided context: \"hereditary indecomposable metric continuum\". The space $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact metric space. Its Stone-Cech remainder is a continuum. The fact that X is hereditary indecomposable is a strong condition. A result by Smith shows that there is an indecomposable continuum with $2^\\alpha$ composants for any infinite cardinal $\\alpha$. Therefore, the maximum number should be at least $2^c$. The question is if it can be larger. The cardinality of the remainder is $2^c$. The number of subsets of the remainder is $2^{2^c}$. A composant is a subset. So the number of-composants cannot exceed $2^{2^c}$. It has been shown that there exist indecomposable continua with $2^c$-composants where $c=2^{\\aleph_0}$. Therefore, $2^c$ is a possible number of-composants. Given the information, it is the highest confirmed possible value.Let $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a metric continuum, it is a compact, connected, and separable metric space. The space $Y$ is a locally compact, non-compact, separable metric space. The Stone-Čech compactification of $Y$, denoted $\\beta Y$, is a compact Hausdorff space, and the Stone-Čech remainder is given by $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$. It is known that the remainder $Y^*$ is a continuum.\n\nThe question is about the number of composants of this remainder, $Y^*$. A key property of indecomposable continua is the structure of their-composants. For a metrizable indecomposable continuum, the number of-composants is equal to the cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. However, the Stone-Čech remainder of a non-compact, locally compact metric space is generally not metrizable.\n\nFor non-metrizable indecomposable continua, the number of-composants can vary. There are constructions of indecomposable continua with only one or two-composants. On the other hand, there are also constructions of indecomposable continua with a very large number of-composants.\n\nA significant result by Michel Smith shows that for any infinite cardinal number $\\alpha$, it is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum that has $2^\\alpha$-composants. Let's consider the cardinality of the remainder $Y^*$. For any separable, locally compact, non-compact metric space $Y$, the cardinality of its Stone-Čech remainder $Y^*$ is $2^c$, where $c$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThis suggests that it might be possible for the remainder $Y^*$ to have a very large number of-composants. In fact, for a non-metric continuum $Z$, there exists an indecomposable continuum with $2^{w(Z)}$-composants, where $w(Z)$ is the weight of $Z$. The weight of the Stone-Čech remainder of a separable metric space is $c$. Thus, it is possible to have an indecomposable continuum with $2^c$-composants that could potentially be a Stone-Čech remainder.\n\nWhile it is not definitively stated that the Stone-Čech remainder of *any* such $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ can have this many-composants, the question asks for the *maximum possible* number. The existence of indecomposable continua with $2^c$ -composants demonstrates that this number is achievable in general for continua of that weight. Research on the Stone-Čech remainder of the half-line ($[0, \\infty)$) shows that under the Continuum Hypothesis, it has $2^c$-composants, further supporting the idea that the remainder can have this many-composants.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of-composants of the Stone-Cech remainder is $2^c$.\n\n<<<2^c>>>Let $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a metric continuum, it is a compact, connected, and separable metric space. The space $Y$ is a locally compact, non-compact, separable metric space. The Stone-Čech compactification of $Y$, denoted $\\beta Y$, is a compact Hausdorff space, and the Stone-Čech remainder is given by $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$. It is known that the remainder $Y^*$ is a continuum.\n\nThe question is about the number of composants of this remainder, $Y^*$. A key property of indecomposable continua is the structure of their-composants. For a metrizable indecomposable continuum, the number of-composants is equal to the cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ [3].
