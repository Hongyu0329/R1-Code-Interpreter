    "In the context of disordered electronic systems, the supersymmetric sigma-model is a powerful theoretical tool used to study localization phenomena. The properties of the system are encoded in the geometry of the model's target space, which is a graded manifold determined by the system's symmetry class.\n\nFor symmetry class D, which describes systems with particle-hole symmetry but broken time-reversal symmetry, the appropriate supersymmetric sigma-model requires the use of the replica trick to calculate quantities beyond the average conductance, such as the conductance variance. Using two replicas (n=2) is necessary for these higher moments.\n\nThe target manifold for a supersymmetric sigma model of class D with *n* replicas is the superspace SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). For the case of two replicas (n=2), this becomes SpO(4, R|4)/U(2|2).\n\nThe non-Grassman (bosonic) variables parametrize the bosonic part of this target manifold. The bosonic sector of this superspace is a product of two symmetric spaces:\n1.  A non-compact \"Bose-Bose\" sector: Sp(4, R)/U(2)\n2.  A compact \"Fermi-Fermi\" sector: O(4)/U(2)\n\nThe number of variables needed to parametrize this space is its total dimension, which is the sum of the dimensions of these two component spaces.\n\nThe dimensions of the involved Lie groups are:\n*   dim(Sp(4, R)) = 10\n*   dim(O(4)) = 6\n*   dim(U(2)) = 4\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the Bose-Bose sector is dim(Sp(4, R)) - dim(U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6.\nThe dimension of the Fermi-Fermi sector is dim(O(4)) - dim(U(2)) = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nThe total number of non-Grassman variables required is the sum of these dimensions: 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
