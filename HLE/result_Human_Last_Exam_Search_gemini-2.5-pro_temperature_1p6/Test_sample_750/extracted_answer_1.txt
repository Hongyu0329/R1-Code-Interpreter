The solutions for $z \in \mathbb{C}$ in the equation $z \cdot i = i^z$ are:
1.  $z = 1$
2.  $z = -1$
3.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = -ia_k$ for each integer $k \leq -1$, where $a_k$ is the unique positive real solution to the equation $a = e^{a(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi)}$. These solutions can also be expressed using the Lambert W function as $z_k = \frac{i W_0(-(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi))}{\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi}$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.
