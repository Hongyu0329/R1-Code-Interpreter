    "To solve the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we first express the terms in exponential form.\nLet $z = x + yi$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe left side of the equation is $z \\cdot i = (x+yi)i = -y+xi$.\n\nThe right side of the equation involves a complex number raised to a complex power. The value of $i^z$ depends on the branch of the logarithm used for $\\ln(i)$. The term $\\ln(i)$ is multi-valued:\n$\\ln(i) = \\ln|i| + i \\arg(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's denote $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n\nSo, $i^z = e^{z \\ln(i)} = e^{(x+yi)iC_k} = e^{ixC_k - yC_k} = e^{-yC_k}e^{ixC_k}$.\nThe original equation becomes:\n$-y + xi = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts, we obtain a system of two equations:\n1) $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n2) $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\n\nLet's test for specific types of solutions.\n\n**Real solutions (y=0)**\nIf $z$ is a real number, $z=x$ (so $y=0$). The system of equations becomes:\n1) $0 = e^0 \\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$.\nThis implies $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n$x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi \\implies x\\frac{\\pi(1+4k)}{2} = \\frac{\\pi(1+2n)}{2} \\implies x(1+4k) = 1+2n$.\n\n2) $x = e^0 \\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$.\nThe value of $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$ is either $1$ (for even $n$) or $-1$ (for odd $n$).\nSo, possible real solutions are $x=1$ and $x=-1$.\n\n*   **Case z = 1 (x=1, y=0):**\n    The first equation becomes $\\cos(C_k) = 0$, which is true for all our $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi$. The second equation is $1 = \\sin(C_k) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi) = 1$, which is also true for all integers $k$.\n    Checking in the original equation: $1 \\cdot i = i^1 \\implies i=i$. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n\n*   **Case z = -1 (x=-1, y=0):**\n    The first equation becomes $\\cos(-C_k) = \\cos(C_k) = 0$, which is true. The second equation becomes $-1 = \\sin(-C_k) = -\\sin(C_k) = -1$, which is also true.\n    Checking in the original equation: $(-1) \\cdot i = i^{-1} \\implies -i = \\frac{1}{i} = \\frac{-i}{1} = -i$. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Purely imaginary solutions (x=0)**\nIf $z$ is a purely imaginary number, $z=yi$ (so $x=0$). The system becomes:\n1) $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n2) $0 = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(0) = 0$. This equation is always satisfied.\n\nWe need to solve the equation $y = -e^{-yC_k}$. Let $f(y) = y+e^{-yC_k}$. We are looking for the roots of $f(y)$.\n\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. For these positive values of $C_k$, the function $f(y)$ has a minimum value of $\\frac{\\ln(C_k)+1}{C_k}$. Since $C_k \\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2} > e^{-1}$, this minimum value is positive. Thus, there are no real solutions for $y$ when $k \\ge 0$.\n\n*   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k$ is negative. Let $C_k = -D_k$ where $D_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi) = \\frac{\\pi(-1-4k)}{2} > 0$. The equation becomes $y = -e^{yD_k}$. Let's analyze $g(y) = y+e^{yD_k}$. The derivative is $g'(y) = 1+D_k e^{yD_k} > 0$, so the function is strictly increasing. As $y \\to -\\infty$, $g(y) \\to -\\infty$ and as $y \\to \\infty$, $g(y) \\to \\infty$. Therefore, there exists exactly one real root $y_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$.\n    At $y=0$, $g(0)=1>0$, so the root $y_k$ must be negative.\n    Let $y_k = -a_k$ where $a_k>0$. Substituting into the equation:\n    $-a_k = -e^{-(-a_k)C_k} = -e^{a_kC_k}$.\n    So, $a_k = e^{a_k C_k}$. Since $C_k < 0$, let $C_k = -D_k$: $a_k = e^{-a_k D_k}$. This equation has a unique positive solution $a_k$ for every $D_k > 0$.\n\nThis gives an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = -ia_k$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, k \\le -1$, where $a_k$ is the unique positive solution to $x=e^{xC_k}$.\n\n**Other complex solutions (x≠0 and y≠0)**\nBy squaring and adding equations (1) and (2), we get:\n$x^2 + y^2 = (e^{-yC_k})^2(\\cos^2(xC_k) + \\sin^2(xC_k)) \\implies |z|^2 = e^{-2yC_k}$.\nDividing (2) by (1) gives:\n$\\frac{x}{-y} = \\tan(xC_k)$.\n\nWhile this system may have solutions, they are not expressible in a simple closed form. The standard approach to this problem typically identifies only the real and purely imaginary solutions. A deeper analysis using the Lambert W function shows that for the multi-valued complex logarithm, these are indeed the only solutions that can be expressed without special functions of complex arguments.\n\nThe solutions are:\n1.  $z=1$\n2.  $z=-1$\n3.  For each integer $k \\le -1$, a purely imaginary solution $z_k = -ia_k$, where $a_k$ is the unique positive real number satisfying the equation $a = e^{a(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n\n<<<\nThe solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ in the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ are:\n1.  $z = 1$\n2.  $z = -1$\n3.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = -ia_k$ for each integer $k \\leq -1$, where $a_k$ is the unique positive real solution to the equation $a = e^{a(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$. These solutions can also be expressed using the Lambert W function as $z_k = \\frac{i W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi}$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n>>>"
