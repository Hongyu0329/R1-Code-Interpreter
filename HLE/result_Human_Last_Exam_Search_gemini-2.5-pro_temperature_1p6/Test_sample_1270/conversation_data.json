    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a chemical pun that visually merges the Mercedes-Benz three-pointed star logo with the structure of a benzene molecule. In its most common humorous and chemical representation, the molecule is depicted as 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene.\n\nThis structure consists of a central benzene ring, which is made up of 6 carbon atoms. Attached to this central ring are three phenyl groups, each also containing 6 carbon atoms, positioned to mimic the logo's star shape.\n\nThe total number of carbon atoms is calculated as follows: 6 carbons in the central ring plus 6 carbons in each of the three attached phenyl groups (6 + 3*6), which equals 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
