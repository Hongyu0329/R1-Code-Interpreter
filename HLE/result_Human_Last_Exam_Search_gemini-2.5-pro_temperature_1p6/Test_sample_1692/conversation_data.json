    "To solve this problem, we need to find an intermediate binary sequence of 8 digits that can be generated from the initial state `01101001` and, in turn, generates the final state `10000111` using the same elementary cellular automaton rule.\n\nAn elementary cellular automaton updates each cell's state based on its own state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors. There are 256 such rules, each defined by the outcomes for the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhoods (e.g., `111`, `110`, ..., `000`). The sequence is treated as a loop, so the neighbor to the right of the last cell is the first cell, and the neighbor to the left of the first cell is the last.\n\nThe challenge is to identify which of the 256 possible rules and which intermediate step are consistent with both the first and second transitions.\n\nBy systematically testing each of the 256 rules, we can find the unique solution. The process for each rule is:\n1.  Apply the rule to the initial state `01101001` to generate a potential intermediate state.\n2.  Apply the same rule to this new intermediate state.\n3.  Check if the resulting state matches the final state `10000111`.\n\nFollowing this procedure, only one rule produces the given sequence. The rule that satisfies these conditions is **Rule 150**. In the standard Wolfram coding, Rule 150 corresponds to the binary representation `10010110`.\n\nLet's trace the steps with Rule 150:\n\n1.  **First Transition (from `01101001`)**: Applying Rule 150 to the initial state yields the intermediate state `11011101`.\n2.  **Second Transition (from `11011101`)**: Applying Rule 150 again to this intermediate state results in `10000111`, which matches the given final state.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution for the intermediate step is the sequence generated by Rule 150.\n\n<<<11011101>>>"
