Yes, changing the amide group to a more extensive PEG group is a viable strategy to solve the precipitation problem. The hydrophobic thioxanthene core of the probe likely contributes to its low aqueous solubility, and PEGylation is a well-established method for increasing the solubility and preventing the aggregation of such small molecules in solution.
