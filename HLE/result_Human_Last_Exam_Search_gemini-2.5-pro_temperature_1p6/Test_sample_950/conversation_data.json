    "The question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$. This space is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. The integral cohomology ring, denoted $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is the direct sum of the integral cohomology groups $H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ for various degrees $i$.\n\nIt is a known result in algebraic topology that the torsion part of the integral cohomology of any real Grassmannian manifold consists entirely of 2-torsion, meaning elements of order 2.\n\nThe additive structure of the integral cohomology groups for $G(3, 5)$ has been explicitly computed. The manifold $G(3, 5)$ has a dimension of $3 \\times (5-3) = 6$. The structure of its integral cohomology groups is as follows:\n*   $H^0(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^3(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^4(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^6(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each cohomology group. From the list above, we can collect all the torsion summands:\n*   The torsion part of $H^2$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The torsion part of $H^3$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The torsion part of $H^4$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The torsion part of $H^5$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe other groups ($H^0, H^1, H^6$) are torsion-free. Therefore, the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is the direct sum of these groups:\n$T = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, which can also be written as $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$.\n\nThe question asks for the **rank** of this torsion subgroup. In the context of finitely generated abelian groups, the rank is defined as the number of free summands isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$ in the group's decomposition. The group $T = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$ is a torsion group, which means all its elements have finite order. Such a group has no free $\\mathbb{Z}$ summands.\n\nConsequently, the rank of the torsion subgroup is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
