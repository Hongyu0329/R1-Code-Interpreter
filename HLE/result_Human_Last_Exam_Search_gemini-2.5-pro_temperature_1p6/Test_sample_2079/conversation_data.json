    "I have been unable to identify the specific individual who held the position of judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461.\n\nWhile historical records confirm that the free royal town of Bártfa had a town judge (in Hungarian: *városbíró*) and a town council during the 15th century, and numerous documents from this period are preserved in the city's archives, a definitive list of judges for this specific year has not been located in the available search results.\n\nMentions of town officials from periods close to 1461 exist. For instance, a George Mager is recorded as the town mayor in 1479. Correspondence from the 1460s also refers to \"the judge and lay judges of Bártfa\" without providing specific names for 1461. The search for a complete \"archontology\" or list of office-holders for 15th-century Bártfa has so far been unsuccessful.\n\nDetailed scholarly works, such as \"Bardejov v XV. storočí – Štúdie z dejín mesta\" by Stanisław A. Sroka, likely contain this information, but the content of such publications is not fully accessible through the available search tools. Therefore, without access to these detailed secondary sources or direct archival records, the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 remains elusive.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question about who the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) was in 1461 based on the available information.>>>"
