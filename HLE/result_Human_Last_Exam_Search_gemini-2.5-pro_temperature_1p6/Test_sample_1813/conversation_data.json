    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to determine the continued fraction of the rational number 4/7.\n\nThe continued fraction of 4/7 is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{7} = 0 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} = 0 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3}{4}} = 0 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}}} = 0 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} \\]\nThus, the continued fraction representation of 4/7 is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\n\nThe concept of a generalized Markov number associated with a rational number \\( p/q \\) is connected to the theory of Diophantine approximation and the Lagrange spectrum. In this context, a quadratic irrational number is associated with the rational number \\( p/q \\). A standard construction for a rational number \\( r = [0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n] \\) is to define the associated quadratic irrationality as the number whose continued fraction is purely periodic with the sequence of partial quotients \\( (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\).\n\nFor \\( r = 4/7 \\), the sequence of partial quotients after the integer part is \\( (1, 1, 3) \\). The associated continued fraction is therefore the purely periodic continued fraction with this repeating block.\n\nThe continued fraction is given by:\n\\[ [\\overline{1; 1, 3}] = [1; 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, \\ldots] \\]\n\nTo verify this, we can compute the value of this continued fraction. Let \\( x = [\\overline{1; 1, 3}] \\). Then \\( x \\) satisfies the equation:\n\\[ x = 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\frac{1}{x}}} \\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{x}{3x+1}} = 1 + \\frac{3x+1}{3x+1+x} = 1 + \\frac{3x+1}{4x+1} = \\frac{4x+1+3x+1}{4x+1} = \\frac{7x+2}{4x+1} \\]\nThis leads to the quadratic equation:\n\\[ x(4x+1) = 7x+2 \\]\n\\[ 4x^2 + x = 7x + 2 \\]\n\\[ 4x^2 - 6x - 2 = 0 \\]\n\\[ 2x^2 - 3x - 1 = 0 \\]\nThe positive solution to this equation is:\n\\[ x = \\frac{-(-3) + \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(2)(-1)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{9 + 8}}{4} = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{17}}{4} \\]\nBy expanding this value back into a continued fraction, we can confirm the periodicity:\n*   \\(x_0 = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{17}}{4}\\). Since \\(4 < \\sqrt{17} < 5\\), we have \\(7 < 3+\\sqrt{17} < 8\\), so \\(1 < x_0 < 2\\). The integer part is \\(a_0 = 1\\).\n*   \\(x_1 = \\frac{1}{x_0 - 1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3+\\sqrt{17}}{4} - 1} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}-1} = \\frac{4(\\sqrt{17}+1)}{16} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}+1}{4}\\). Integer part is \\(a_1 = 1\\).\n*   \\(x_2 = \\frac{1}{x_1 - 1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{17}+1}{4} - 1} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{17}-3} = \\frac{4(\\sqrt{17}+3)}{8} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}+3}{2}\\). Integer part is \\(a_2 = 3\\).\n*   \\(x_3 = \\frac{1}{x_2 - 3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{17}+3}{2} - 3} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{17}-3} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{17}+3)}{8} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}+3}{4}\\). This is equal to \\(x_0\\).\n\nThe process repeats from here, confirming the continued fraction is indeed \\( [\\overline{1; 1, 3}] \\).\n\n<<<The continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is \\( [\\overline{1; 1, 3}] \\).>>>"
