    "The computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is analyzed as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Step 1 of the algorithm involves a few basic assignments and arithmetic operations (`i := 0`, `x := n`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, `a₀ := x — qc`). Assuming that the numbers `n` and `c` fit within a computer's word size, these operations take a constant amount of time, which can be denoted as O(1).\n\n2.  **Loop Execution**: The core of the algorithm is the `while` loop (Step 2), which continues as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0. In each iteration, the value of `x` is effectively divided by the base `c`. The loop terminates when `x` becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` before the result is less than 1 is given by the logarithm `log base c of n` (log<sub>c</sub>n). Therefore, the loop executes approximately `log_c(n)` times.\n\n3.  **Operations within the loop**: Inside each iteration of the loop, a constant number of simple arithmetic operations are performed (`i := i + 1`, `x := q`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, `aᵢ := x - qc`). These operations, like those in the initialization step, are considered to take constant time, O(1), under the standard Random Access Machine (RAM) model where operations on integers of a certain size are O(1).\n\n4.  **Return Value**: Step 3 returns the resulting digits. The number of digits `i` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. Creating and returning this representation takes time proportional to the number of digits, which is O(log<sub>c</sub>n).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCombining these parts, the total time complexity is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the cost of each iteration, plus the initial and final steps. This gives a complexity of O(1) + O(log<sub>c</sub>n) * O(1) + O(log<sub>c</sub>n), which simplifies to O(log<sub>c</sub>n).\n\nIn complexity analysis, the base of the logarithm is often omitted because logarithms with different constant bases are related by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`). Thus, the complexity is commonly expressed as O(log n). This assumes that arithmetic operations on numbers of the size of `n` take constant time. If `n` is a very large number that requires multiple machine words, the complexity of the division and modulo operations would also depend on the number of bits in `n`, making the overall complexity higher. However, for the standard analysis where `n` fits in a machine word, the complexity is logarithmic.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
