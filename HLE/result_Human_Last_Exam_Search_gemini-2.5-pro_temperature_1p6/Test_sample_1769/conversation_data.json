    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **swester**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is a product of the linguistic blending that occurred due to the Viking invasions. The original Old English word for a female sibling was **sweostor** (pronounced roughly as \"SWEH-os-tor\"). This word, along with terms like *mōdor* (mother), *fæder* (father), and *brōþor* (brother), belonged to a specific class of kinship nouns.\n\nThe current form, \"sister,\" with its \"i\" vowel sound, is a direct result of influence from the Old Norse word **systir**. Without this Norse interaction, the native Old English *sweostor* would have followed a different evolutionary path.\n\nDuring the development from Old to Middle English, the \"eo\" vowel sound in *sweostor* would have likely simplified to \"e\". In fact, a Northumbrian dialectal form, **swester**, already existed in the Old English period. This form, free from Norse influence, would probably have become standard.\n\nFollowing typical English sound changes, a Middle English word like *swester* would have transitioned into Modern English while retaining its basic form, similar to how other kinship terms evolved. The resulting word would be **swester**, likely pronounced /ˈswɛstər/.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
