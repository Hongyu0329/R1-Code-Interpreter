    "An island town located more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island, that sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera which shares the town's name is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n\nEaster Island is a remote volcanic island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. Its nearest inhabited neighbor is Pitcairn Island, located over 1,900 kilometers away, thus satisfying the isolation criterion.\n\nThe main town and capital of Easter Island is Hanga Roa. In the local Rapa Nui language, \"Hanga Roa\" translates to \"Long Bay\" or \"Wide Bay,\" and the town is situated on this very bay. This fulfills the condition of the town and bay sharing the same name.\n\nThe island itself was formed by three extinct volcanoes. The town of Hanga Roa is located in the lowlands between two of these volcanoes, Terevaka and Rano Kau. The nearby Rano Kau is noted for its large, circular, water-filled crater, which is a volcanic caldera. Hanga Roa Bay is located on the coast adjacent to the lowlands of the Rano Kau volcano.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
