    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar is a molecule where every hydrogen atom of a nanocar has been replaced by a fluorine atom. The exact number of fluorine atoms would depend on the specific chemical structure of the nanocar in question, as several different designs exist.\n\nHowever, a representative example of a flexible nanocar with fullerene wheels has the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. In this specific structure, there are 34 hydrogen atoms.\n\nTo create a \"perfluoronanocar\" from this molecule, all 34 hydrogen atoms would be substituted with fluorine atoms. Therefore, a perfluoronanocar based on this design would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<34>>>"
