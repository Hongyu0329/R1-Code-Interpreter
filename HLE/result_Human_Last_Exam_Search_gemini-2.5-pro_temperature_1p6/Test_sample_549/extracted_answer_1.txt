In a bulk semiconductor, the quantum correction to the conductivity due to weak localization is negative and is given by the formula δσ = - (e^2 / (2π^2 * ħ)) * (1/l - 1/Lφ), where 'e' is the elementary charge, 'ħ' is the reduced Planck constant, 'l' is the electron's mean free path, and 'Lφ' is its phase coherence length.
