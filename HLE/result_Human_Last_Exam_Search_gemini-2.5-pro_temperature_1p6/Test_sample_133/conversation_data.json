    "Based on the analysis of the provided Connect 4 board, the single optimal move for player 'O' to win as fast as possible is in column f.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the winning move:\n*   **f4**: Placing a token at f4 creates a horizontal line of three 'O's at positions d4, e4, and f4. This immediately creates two winning threats for 'O' on its next turn: one at c4 and another at g4. Since player 'X' can only block one of these two positions in their turn, 'O' is guaranteed to win on the subsequent move by placing a token in the unblocked spot. This is the fastest path to victory.\n\nOther potential moves were analyzed and found to be slower or not to lead to a guaranteed win. For instance, playing at c4 creates a threat that can be defended, and playing at d3 leads to a win that takes one turn longer than playing at f4.\n\n<<<f4>>>"
