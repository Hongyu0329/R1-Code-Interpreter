    "Based on the research, adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) have a diet that includes both other insects and plant-based substances.\n\n*   **Predatory Diet:** Adult snakeflies are carnivorous and are significant predators of small, soft-bodied insects like aphids and mites.\n*   **Other Food Sources:** Pollen has been found in the guts of adult snakeflies, and some have been recorded feeding on it. Some sources also indicate they may feed on nectar or other sugary substances.\n\nTherefore, they have been recorded feeding on both nectar (A) and aphids (E). Options B, C, and D are not supported by the search results. Māhoe, Karamū, and Totara are specific to New Zealand, a region where snakeflies are not naturally found. While they eat pollen and aphids generally, there is no specific record of them consuming Māhoe pollen or Totara aphids. However, of the choices provided, the combination of nectar and aphids is the most accurate description of their recorded diet.\n\n<<<F>>>"
