    "This is a highly technical question in the field of algebraic and topological combinatorics. Based on specialized research papers, the answer can be determined.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n*   **Higher Dimensional Rooted Forest:** In a simplicial complex (like a triangulation), a higher-dimensional rooted forest is a pair `(F, R)`. Here, `F` is a subcomplex called the \"forest,\" which is a collection of highest-dimensional simplices (the \"trees\") that is acyclic in a specific sense. `R` is a subcomplex of `F` called the \"root.\"\n*   **Standard Triangulation of the Möbius Band:** While there are multiple triangulations of a Möbius band, a common and minimal one uses 5 vertices, 10 edges, and 5 triangles. This is often the \"standard\" choice in contexts like this.\n*   **Simplicial Collapse:** This is a process of simplifying a simplicial complex by removing pairs of simplices (a simplex and one of its faces that is not part of any other larger simplex) without changing its fundamental shape (homotopy type). A forest `F` simplicially collapses onto its root `R` if `F` can be reduced to `R` through a series of these collapses.\n\n### The Connection to Discrete Morse Theory\n\nThe question of whether a forest `F` collapses onto its root `R` is answered by discrete Morse theory. A rooted forest `(F,R)` naturally defines a \"discrete gradient vector field.\" The forest `F` collapses to `R` if and only if this vector field is acyclic.\n\nFor most simplicial complexes, particularly those of orientable manifolds, all rooted forests lead to acyclic vector fields. However, for non-orientable manifolds like the Möbius strip, this is not always the case. There can exist rooted forests whose corresponding vector fields have \"closed cycles.\" These are precisely the forests that fail to collapse onto their roots.\n\n### Determining the Number\n\nA key research paper by Contreras and Tawfeek investigates this exact phenomenon. They study generating functions related to rooted forests and discrete gradient vector fields. For the standard 5-vertex triangulation of the Möbius strip, they compute two polynomials:\n\n1.  A polynomial derived from the simplicial Laplacian matrix, which acts as a generating function for a weighted count of all rooted forests.\n2.  A polynomial that is the generating function for acyclic discrete gradient vector fields (which correspond to collapsible forests).\n\nThey find that these two polynomials are not identical for the Möbius strip. The difference between them precisely accounts for the rooted forests that have cyclic orientations and thus fail to collapse. This difference is found to be `4λ^5`.\n\nIn this context:\n*   The exponent, `5`, corresponds to the number of edges in the root `R` of the forest `(F, R)`.\n*   The coefficient, `4`, is the number of such rooted forests that have these cyclic (and thus non-collapsible) properties.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 4 higher dimensional rooted forests of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to simplicially collapse onto their root. These are the forests that correspond to the non-trivial topology of the Möbius strip. An illustration of such a forest with a cyclic orientation is provided in the aforementioned paper.\n\n<<<4>>>"
