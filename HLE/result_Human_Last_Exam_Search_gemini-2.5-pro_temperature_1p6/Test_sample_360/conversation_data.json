    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a total of **two** isomers are formed.\n\nThe reaction involves the substitution of the two chloride ligands on the ruthenium complex by the bidentate ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole. The resulting product is a tris-chelate octahedral ruthenium complex, `[Ru(bpy)2(2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)]^2+`.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the resulting isomers:\n*   **Chirality:** Octahedral complexes with three bidentate ligands, such as the one formed in this reaction, are inherently chiral. This means they exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images.\n*   **Enantiomers:** These two mirror-image isomers are called enantiomers and are designated as Delta (Δ) and Lambda (Λ). These tris-chelate complexes are substitutionally inert, meaning the Δ and Λ forms are stable and do not easily convert into one another.\n\nThe starting complex, *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), is also a chiral species. The reaction between this complex and 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole can also result in the formation of more complex structures. For instance, if two equivalents of the ruthenium complex react with one molecule of the ligand, a dinuclear complex can be formed which exists as two diastereoisomers: a *meso* form and a racemic (*rac*) form. However, with the reactants as stated, the most direct product is the monomeric tris-chelate complex, which exists as a pair of enantiomers.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces two distinct isomers, the Δ and Λ enantiomers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
