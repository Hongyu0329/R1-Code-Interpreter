    "Based on information from the game's source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is determined by the game's player limit and the health scaling formula for bosses.\n\nIn Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640 for a single player. The health scales with the number of players in the world. For multiplayer in Expert and Master Mode, boss health is increased for each additional player.\n\nThe health scaling formula becomes less drastic for higher player counts. While a precise, simple formula is not officially published, analysis of the source code reveals a complex calculation. A detailed breakdown of this calculation indicates that while the health multiplier increases with each player, there is a hardcoded player limit of 255 in standard Terraria.\n\nFor 255 players, the health multiplier reaches approximately 171.3666 times the base health.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health can be calculated as:\n\n3640 (base expert health) * 171.3666 (255-player multiplier) = 623,893.584\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives a theoretical maximum health of 623,894.\n\n<<<623894>>>"
