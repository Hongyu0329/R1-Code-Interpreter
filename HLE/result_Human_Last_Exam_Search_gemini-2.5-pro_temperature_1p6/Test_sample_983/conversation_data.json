    "After a thorough analysis of the provided number sequence, a definitive mathematical rule that generates every term has not been found in standard, well-known mathematical sequence databases. The sequence is:\n1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352.\n\nSeveral properties were investigated:\n1.  **Simple arithmetic progression:** The differences between consecutive numbers do not follow a simple pattern.\n2.  **Divisibility by the sum of digits (Harshad/Niven numbers):** This rule does not hold for all numbers in the sequence (e.g., 1290 is not divisible by 1+2+9+0=12).\n3.  **Divisibility by a common number:** All numbers in the sequence are divisible by 6. This is the only consistent mathematical property found.\n\nGiven the lack of a clear, overarching rule, predicting the next number with certainty is not possible. The sequence may be from a specific puzzle context that is not provided, may contain typos, or may be constructed with a very obscure rule.\n\nHowever, a plausible next number can be extrapolated based on the consistent property of divisibility by 6. If we divide the entire sequence by 6, we get a new sequence:\n169, 170, 172, 175, 184, 204, 205, 215, 235, 240, 242, 247, 250, 252, 260, 264, 267, 289, 302, 315, 317, 322, 329, 334, 340, 344, 345, 355, 357, 379, 390, 392.\n\nThe differences of this new sequence are:\n1, 2, 3, 9, 20, 1, 10, 20, 5, 2, 5, 3, 2, 8, 4, 3, 22, 13, 13, 2, 5, 7, 5, 6, 4, 1, 10, 2, 22, 11, 2.\n\nWhile this sequence of differences does not have an obvious pattern, the last three terms are 22, 11, and 2. One might observe a pattern of rough division. If this highly speculative pattern were to continue, the next difference might be 1. Adding 1 to the last term of the divided sequence (392) gives 393.\n\nMultiplying this by 6 gives the next term in the original sequence:\n393 * 6 = 2358.\n\nThis number is a multiple of 6, conforming to the only solid rule observed in the entire sequence.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
