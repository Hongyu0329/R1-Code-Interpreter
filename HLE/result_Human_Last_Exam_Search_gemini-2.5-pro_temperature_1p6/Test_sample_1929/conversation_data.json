    "The reaction between butadiene (a conjugated diene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (a fluorinated alkene) results in a cycloaddition product. Specifically, this reaction favors a [2+2] cycloaddition over the more common Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\n\nThe major product formed is **4-(2,2-dichlor-1,1-difluorocyclobutyl)but-1-ene**.\n\nThis outcome is characteristic of reactions involving fluorinated ethylenes and acyclic dienes. The presence of the fluorine atoms on the ethene molecule influences the reaction to proceed through a biradical intermediate, leading to the formation of a four-membered cyclobutane ring (a 1,2-cycloaddition) rather than the six-membered ring that would result from a Diels-Alder reaction (a 1,4-cycloaddition). The reaction yields a vinylcyclobutane derivative. While both [4+2] and [2+2] cycloadditions are possible, the [2+2] adduct is the predominantly formed product.\n\n<<<4-(2,2-dichlor-1,1-difluorocyclobutyl)but-1-ene>>>"
