    "To identify which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag and then analyze the flags of African nations based on the same principles. The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns it contains. The prompt specifies that the values assigned to each color in the flag's matrix representation are chosen to maximize the rank, which means each distinct color is treated as a linearly independent vector.\n\n### Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nThe flag of Denmark features a white Nordic cross on a red field. When represented as a matrix, it is composed of two distinct colors, red and white. The rows of this matrix fall into two types:\n1.  Rows that form the horizontal part of the white cross.\n2.  Rows that are part of the red field, interrupted by the vertical part of the white cross.\n\nThese two types of row vectors are linearly independent of each other, provided the values for red and white are different. Since all rows in the flag matrix are of one of these two types, the entire set of rows spans a two-dimensional space. Therefore, the maximal linear algebraic rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### African Flags with a Rank of 2\n\nWe are looking for flags of African nations whose geometric design, when represented as a matrix, also results in a rank of 2. This generally includes flags with two distinct types of linearly independent rows or columns. Flags with complex emblems such as stars, shields, or crescents, as well as those with diagonal or multi-colored patterns (three or more colors in simple stripes), will have a rank greater than 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following African flags have a linear algebraic rank of 2:\n\n*   **Nigeria:** The Nigerian flag is a vertical tricolor with green, white, and then green stripes. This A-B-A pattern means there are only two distinct types of columns: green ones and white ones. These are linearly independent, making the column rank (and thus the matrix rank) equal to 2.\n*   **Benin:** The flag of Benin has a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands of yellow and red on the fly. This design creates two unique types of row vectors: one corresponding to the top half (`green-yellow`) and another for the bottom half (`green-red`). These two row types are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   **Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar has a similar structure to Benin's flag, with a vertical white band at the hoist and two horizontal bands of red and green. This configuration also produces two types of linearly independent rows (`white-red` and `white-green`), giving the flag a rank of 2.\n\nOther African flags were considered, but their designs lead to a rank higher than 2. For instance, flags with three simple horizontal or vertical stripes of different colors (e.g., Gabon, Ghana, CÃ´te d'Ivoire) have a rank of 3. Flags with emblems or intricate patterns have even higher ranks due to the increased number of unique row and column vectors required to represent their designs.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Nigeria>>>"
