    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is synthesized through the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas. The efficiency and the product of this reaction are highly dependent on the temperature and the ratio of the reactants.\n\nThe most commonly cited and effective temperature for the synthesis of XeF₄ is 400°C. This reaction is typically conducted in a nickel vessel with a xenon to fluorine molar ratio of 1:5. A patent for this process also specifies a temperature range of 350 to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature for a quantitative reaction.\n\nWhile reactions can occur at other temperatures, they are generally less efficient or produce different products. For instance, at lower temperatures, the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF₂) is favored, whereas at temperatures higher than 400°C, xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) is more likely to be produced. Although some reaction products can be observed at temperatures as low as 120°C, the reaction is not efficient. Another method involving an electric discharge at low temperatures can produce XeF₄, but it often results in significant contamination with XeF₂.\n\nConsidering the provided options, 400°C is the coldest temperature at which xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently through direct synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
