    "The Wittig reaction is a process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes using a phosphonium ylide (Wittig reagent). In this specific reaction, the reactants are:\n\n*   **Pivalaldehyde** (also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal).\n*   **The Wittig Reagent**: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide.\n\nThe reaction proceeds by forming a new carbon-carbon double bond between the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde and the ylide carbon (the carbon double-bonded to phosphorus). The oxygen atom from the pivalaldehyde and the triphenylphosphine group from the ylide are eliminated to form triphenylphosphine oxide as a stable byproduct, which drives the reaction forward.\n\nThe structure of the resulting alkene is formed by joining the carbon backbone of the pivalaldehyde, `(CH₃)₃C-CH=`, with the carbon backbone of the ylide, `=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)`.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
