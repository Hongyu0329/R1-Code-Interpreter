The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing catalytic performance depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range is around 7% molar Ni, though similar performance is seen at 10% molar Ni. For water splitting, specifically the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), an optimal Ce to Ni molar ratio of 2:1 has been identified. For overall water splitting with co-dopants like Fe, a higher loading of 20 mol% of combined Ni and Fe has proven effective.
