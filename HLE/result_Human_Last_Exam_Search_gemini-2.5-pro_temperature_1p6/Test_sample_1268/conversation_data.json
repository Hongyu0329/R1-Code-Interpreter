    "An upper bound for the maximum norm in the context of squarefree natural numbers is established within the theory of automorphic forms. In this specialized area, the \"maximum norm,\" which from the context of your query is interpreted as the supremum norm (or $L^\\infty$-norm) of an automorphic form, is related to the covolume of a specific lattice. The squarefree natural number, denoted by $N$, typically represents the level of a congruence subgroup.\n\nLet's consider a Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $\\phi$ for the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$, where $N$ is a squarefree integer. Such a form is an eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$. The form $\\phi$ is normalized so that its $L^2$-norm is one: $\\int_{\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}} |\\phi(z)|^2 \\frac{dx dy}{y^2} = 1$. The maximum norm in question is $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{z \\in \\mathbb{H}} |\\phi(z)|$.\n\nThe covolume $V$ of the modular curve $Y_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$ is given by the formula:\n$V = \\text{vol}(Y_0(N)) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} [\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)]$\nThe index of $\\Gamma_0(N)$ in the full modular group $\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is given by:\n$[\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)] = N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$\nwhere the product is over the prime divisors of $N$.\n\nFor a squarefree number $N$, this can be written as:\n$V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\sum_{d|N} \\frac{\\mu^2(d)}{d} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\sigma_1(N)$, where $\\sigma_1(N)$ is the sum of the divisors of $N$.\n\nThe relationship between the maximum norm $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty$ and the level $N$ has been a significant area of research. A key result in this direction provides a \"subconvexity\" bound. For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $\\phi$ of squarefree level $N$ and trivial nebentypus, a notable bound was established by Gergely Harcos and Nicolas Templier. They showed that:\n$\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\nThe implied constant depends on the Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of the form and on $\\epsilon$. There have been other incremental improvements to this exponent by various authors. A hybrid bound that also considers the eigenvalue dependence is given as $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} N^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$.\n\nTo express this bound in terms of the covolume $V$, we use the relationship between $N$ and $V$. For a squarefree integer $N$, we have $N < \\sigma_1(N)$. The growth of $\\sigma_1(N)$ is known to be $O(N \\log \\log N)$. Therefore, $V$ is of the order $N \\log \\log N$. Asymptotically, for large $N$, we have $N \\approx \\frac{3V}{\\pi \\prod_{p|N}(1+1/p)}$. Since the product term grows very slowly, we can consider $N$ to be roughly proportional to $V$.\n\nThus, the upper bound for the maximum norm can be expressed in terms of the covolume $V$. By substituting $N \\approx V$, we obtain:\n\n$\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$\n\nThis indicates that as the covolume of the underlying space grows, the maximum value that the automorphic form can attain decreases.\n\n<<<An upper bound for the maximum norm, denoted as $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty$ for an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $\\phi$ of squarefree level $N$, in relation to the covolume $V$ of the corresponding modular curve $Y_0(N)$, can be expressed as $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{-1/6+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$. The implied constant depends on the Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and $\\epsilon$.>>>"
