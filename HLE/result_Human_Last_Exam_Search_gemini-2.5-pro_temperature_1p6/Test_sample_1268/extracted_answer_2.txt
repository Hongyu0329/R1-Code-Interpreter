An upper bound for the maximum norm, denoted as $\|\phi\|_\infty$ for an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $\phi$ of squarefree level $N$, in relation to the covolume $V$ of the corresponding modular curve $Y_0(N)$, can be expressed as $\|\phi\|_\infty \ll_{\lambda, \epsilon} V^{-1/6+\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon > 0$. The implied constant depends on the Laplacian eigenvalue $\lambda$ and $\epsilon$.
