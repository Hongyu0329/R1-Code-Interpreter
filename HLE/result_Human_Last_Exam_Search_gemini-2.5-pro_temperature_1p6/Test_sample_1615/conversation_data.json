    "Let $G$ be a graph with $n=12345$ vertices. The chromatic number of a graph, denoted by $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of $G$ so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. A fundamental property is that for any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n\nThe only graph with $n$ vertices that requires $n$ colors is the complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In such a graph, every vertex must be assigned a unique color, so $\\chi(K_n)=n$.\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ has 12345 vertices and is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$. Since $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than 12345. Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number for $G$ is at most 12344.\n\nTo determine if 12344 is achievable, we need to see if there exists a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, which is not a complete graph, and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\nConsider a graph $G$ constructed as the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices, $K_{12344}$, and a single isolated vertex, $K_1$.\n*   **Number of vertices:** This graph has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n*   **Is it a complete graph?** The graph is not complete because the isolated vertex is not connected to any of the vertices in the $K_{12344}$ component.\n*   **Chromatic Number:** The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. The components of $G$ are $K_{12344}$ and $K_1$.\n    *   $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n    *   $\\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\chi(G) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nSince we have found a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph and has a chromatic number of 12344, and we have established that the chromatic number cannot exceed 12344, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\nThe mention of the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ relates to Brooks's Theorem, which states that for a connected graph that is not complete or an odd cycle, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. For the constructed graph $G = K_{12344} \\cup K_1$, the maximum degree is $\\Delta(G) = 12343$ (the degree of any vertex in the $K_{12344}$ component), and the chromatic number is $\\chi(G)=12344$, so $\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1$. This does not violate Brooks's theorem because one of the components is a complete graph, which is an exception to the theorem's main conclusion.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
