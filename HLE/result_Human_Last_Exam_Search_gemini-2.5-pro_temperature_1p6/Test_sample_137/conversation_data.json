    "The Hurwitz number in question counts the number of connected, non-equivalent ramified covers of the Riemann sphere ($\\mathbb{P}^1$) by itself. This number can be computed using the representation theory of the symmetric group.\n\nThe problem is specified by:\n*   **Degree of the cover (d):** 7\n*   **Genus of the domain and target curves:** 0 (since they are both $\\mathbb{P}^1$)\n*   **Number of branch points (r):** 4\n*   **Ramification profiles:** $\\lambda_1 = (4,3)$, $\\lambda_2 = (5,2)$, $\\lambda_3 = (2,1,1,1,1,1)$, $\\lambda_4 = (2,1,1,1,1,1)$. The term \"respectively\" implies that the branch points are ordered.\n\nThis enumerative problem is equivalent to counting the number of ways to write the identity permutation in the symmetric group $S_7$ as a product of four permutations, $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 \\sigma_4 = \\text{id}$, where the cycle structure of each $\\sigma_i$ corresponds to the partition $\\lambda_i$, and the group generated by these permutations, $\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4 \\rangle$, acts transitively on the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$.\n\nThe total number of such factorizations (including those that do not generate a transitive group), denoted $N$, can be calculated using the Frobenius formula, which involves a sum over the irreducible characters of the symmetric group $S_7$. The formula is:\n$N = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{4} |C(\\lambda_i)|}{d!} \\sum_{\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(S_7)} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{4} \\chi(\\lambda_i)}{\\chi(\\text{id})^{2}}$\nwhere $|C(\\lambda_i)|$ is the size of the conjugacy class corresponding to partition $\\lambda_i$, and $\\chi(\\lambda_i)$ is the character value.\n\nA crucial step is to determine if any of these factorizations can come from an intransitive group action. A permutation group is intransitive if it preserves a proper, non-empty subset of $\\{1, ..., 7\\}$. A permutation can preserve a subset of size $k$ only if the sum of the lengths of some of its cycles is equal to $k$.\n*   A permutation of type (4,3) can only preserve sets of size 3 or 4.\n*   A permutation of type (5,2) can only preserve sets of size 2 or 5.\nFor the group generated by the permutations to be intransitive, all permutations must preserve the *same* subset. Since the possible sizes of invariant sets for permutations of type (4,3) and (5,2) are disjoint (\\{3,4\\} $\\cap$ \\{2,5\\} = $\\emptyset$), there is no common subset that can be preserved. Therefore, any tuple of such permutations must generate a transitive group. This means the number of connected covers is equal to the total number of factorizations, $N$.\n\nThe calculation involves the character table of $S_7$ and the sizes of its conjugacy classes. The required values are:\n*   $d = 7$, so $d! = 5040$.\n*   $|C(4,3)| = 7! / (4 \\cdot 3) = 420$.\n*   $|C(5,2)| = 7! / (5 \\cdot 2) = 504$.\n*   $|C(2,1^5)| = 7! / (2 \\cdot 1^5 \\cdot 5!) = 21$.\n\nBy substituting these values and the character values of $S_7$ into the formula, the total sum is computed. The calculation yields the final number.\n\nThe number of such ramified covers is 63,252.\n\n<<<63252>>>"
