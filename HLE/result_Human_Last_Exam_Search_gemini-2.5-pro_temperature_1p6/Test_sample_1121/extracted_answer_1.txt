For a 2D surface code with a 1% faulty gate error rate, a distance-3 code is not considered viable for fault-tolerant universal computation. For a distance-5 code under the same conditions, the approximate number of physical non-Clifford (T) gates required to produce a single logical T-gate for a simulation or demonstration is in the range of 100 to 1,000. A full-scale useful algorithm would require billions of these logical gates, leading to an immense total number of physical non-Clifford gates.
