    "Quantum computers pose a significant threat to modern cryptography. For symmetric key encryption, the most effective quantum attack is using Grover's algorithm, which can search an unsorted database, including a key space, with a quadratic speedup compared to classical computers. This means that a quantum computer can effectively halve the bit-strength of a symmetric key.\n\nTo maintain a desired level of security against a quantum attack, the length of the symmetric key needs to be doubled. For instance, AES-128, which has a 128-bit key, would have its effective security reduced to 64 bits by Grover's algorithm, which is considered insecure.\n\nTo achieve a post-quantum security level of 128 bits, which is widely considered to be strong, a symmetric key of 256 bits is required. When AES with a 256-bit key (AES-256) is attacked by a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm, its effective key strength is reduced to 128 bits. This 128-bit security level is considered sufficient for the foreseeable future.\n\nTherefore, to be resistant to an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long. This ensures a post-quantum security strength of at least 128 bits. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and other security organizations recommend using 256-bit keys for symmetric encryption to be secure against future quantum adversaries.\n\n<<<A>>>"
