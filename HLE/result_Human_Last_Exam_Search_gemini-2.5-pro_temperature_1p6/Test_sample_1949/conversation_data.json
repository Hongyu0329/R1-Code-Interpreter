    "Of the rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid, the three longest are the Tigris, the Hebrus (modern-day Maritsa), and the Tiber. The lengths of these rivers distinguish them from the other terrestrial and mythological rivers referenced in the text.\n\nThe longest by a significant margin is the **Tigris River**, with a length of approximately 1,900 kilometers (about 1,180 miles). This major river of Western Asia flows from the Taurus mountains of Turkey through Iraq.\n\nThe second longest is the **Hebrus River**, now known as the Maritsa. It flows for 480 kilometers (about 300 miles) through the Balkans, originating in Bulgaria and forming a significant part of the border between Greece and Turkey. In the Aeneid, it is associated with the Thracian hero Orpheus.\n\nThe third longest is the **Tiber River**, the most prominent river in the epic's Italian setting. It runs for 406 kilometers (252 miles) through Italy and is famously the river on whose banks Rome was founded. The Tiber plays a crucial role in the latter half of the Aeneid, guiding Aeneas to his fated homeland.\n\nOther real-world rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are considerably shorter. The **Eurotas River**, located in Sparta, is about 82 kilometers (51 miles) long. The **Timavus River**, noted for its short above-ground course of about 2 kilometers after emerging from a subterranean journey of around 40 kilometers, is also referenced.\n\nThe Aeneid also features several mythological rivers of the Underworld, such as the Styx, Acheron, Lethe, Phlegethon, and Cocytus. As these are mythical, they do not have a measurable physical length. The Eridanus is another river mentioned, which is sometimes associated with the real-world Po River but is primarily a mythological entity in the context of the poem.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Tigris, Hebrus, and Tiber.>>>"
