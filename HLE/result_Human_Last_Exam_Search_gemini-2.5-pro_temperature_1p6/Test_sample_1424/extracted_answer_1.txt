In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ shows a simple inverse dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ when represented in the energy-momentum domain. The time-ordered Green's function, G₀(k, ω), is expressed as 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ sgn(ϵₖ - μ)), where ω is the frequency, k is the wavevector, μ is the chemical potential, and iδ is an infinitesimal term for causality. This means G₀ has simple poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. In the imaginary-time formalism, this relationship is given by G₀(k, iωₙ) = 1 / (iωₙ - (ϵₖ - μ)), where iωₙ are the Matsubara frequencies.
