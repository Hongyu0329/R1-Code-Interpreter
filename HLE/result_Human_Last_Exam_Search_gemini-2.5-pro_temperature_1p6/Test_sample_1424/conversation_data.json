    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the **bare Green's function (G₀)**, which describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle, has a distinct and fundamental dependence on the **single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵ_k)**. This relationship is most transparently expressed in the energy-momentum (or frequency-wavevector) domain.\n\nThe bare Green's function G₀(k, ω) for a single particle with momentum **k** and energy (or frequency) **ω** is given by the inverse of the free-particle Hamiltonian operator in that basis. For a non-interacting system, the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the basis of its energy eigenstates.\n\nThe time-ordered bare Green's function in the frequency-wavevector representation is:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ)** for ϵₖ > μ (unoccupied states)\n\nand\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ - iδ)** for ϵₖ < μ (occupied states)\n\nThese can be combined into a single expression:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ sgn(ϵₖ - μ))**\n\nHere:\n*   **ω** is the frequency (related to energy by E = ħω, though ħ is often set to 1).\n*   **k** is the wavevector, labeling the single-particle states.\n*   **ϵₖ** is the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state with wavevector k.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential, which determines the Fermi level (the energy separating occupied and unoccupied states at zero temperature).\n*   **iδ** is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality, ensuring that the propagation described by the Green's function evolves forward in time. The sign of δ depends on whether the state is occupied or empty.\n\nThis functional form reveals a crucial physical property: the bare Green's function has **simple poles** in the complex frequency plane located precisely at the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ. The physical interpretation is that the probability amplitude for a particle's propagation becomes very large when its energy ω matches the energy of an allowed single-particle state ϵₖ.\n\nIn the context of quantum field theory and many-body physics, an equivalent and common representation is the **imaginary-time (or Matsubara) Green's function**, which is particularly useful in statistical mechanics. The expression is:\n\n**G₀(k, iωₙ) = 1 / (iωₙ - (ϵₖ - μ))**\n\nWhere **iωₙ** are the discrete Matsubara frequencies. Again, the denominator directly contains the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ. This form is derived directly from the path integral representation of the partition function for non-interacting fermions.\n\nIn summary, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ is that of a simple inverse relationship in the energy/frequency domain, leading to poles at these energy eigenvalues.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ shows a simple inverse dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ when represented in the energy-momentum domain. The time-ordered Green's function, G₀(k, ω), is expressed as 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ sgn(ϵₖ - μ)), where ω is the frequency, k is the wavevector, μ is the chemical potential, and iδ is an infinitesimal term for causality. This means G₀ has simple poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues. In the imaginary-time formalism, this relationship is given by G₀(k, iωₙ) = 1 / (iωₙ - (ϵₖ - μ)), where iωₙ are the Matsubara frequencies.>>>"
