    "To reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Dual System**: The principle of duality states that a system defined by the pair of matrices (A, C) is observable if and only if the dual system, defined by (A<sup>T</sup>, C<sup>T</sup>), is controllable. The observer canonical form of the original system is the transpose of the controller canonical form of its dual system.\n\n    Given the original system:\n    *   A = [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0]\n    *   C = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0]\n\n    The dual system is described by matrices A' and B', where:\n    *   A' = A<sup>T</sup> = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0]\n    *   B' = C<sup>T</sup> = [0, 1; 1, 1; 0, 0]\n\n2.  **Transform the Dual System to Controller Canonical Form**: We need to find a state transformation z' = T * x' that transforms the dual system (A', B') into controller canonical form (A'<sub>c</sub>, B'<sub>c</sub>). For a multi-input system, a common controller canonical form has an input matrix B'<sub>c</sub> with the structure [I; 0], where I is an identity matrix.\n\n    *   A'<sub>c</sub> = T * A' * T<sup>-1</sup>\n    *   B'<sub>c</sub> = T * B'\n\n    We select a transformation matrix T such that B'<sub>c</sub> becomes [1, 0; 0, 1; 0, 0]. Let T be:\n    T = [-1, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0; 0, 0, 1]\n\n    This matrix is invertible. Its inverse is:\n    T<sup>-1</sup> = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1]\n\n    Now, we find the new input matrix B'<sub>c</sub> for the dual system:\n    B'<sub>c</sub> = T * B' = [-1, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0; 0, 0, 1] * [0, 1; 1, 1; 0, 0] = [1, 0; 0, 1; 0, 0]\n\n3.  **Find the New C Matrix for the Original System**: The observer canonical form (A<sub>o</sub>, C<sub>o</sub>) of the original system is the dual of the controller canonical form (A'<sub>c</sub>, B'<sub>c</sub>).\n\n    *   A<sub>o</sub> = (A'<sub>c</sub>)<sup>T</sup>\n    *   C<sub>o</sub> = (B'<sub>c</sub>)<sup>T</sup>\n\n    The new output matrix C<sub>o</sub> is the transpose of B'<sub>c</sub>:\n    C<sub>o</sub> = [1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0]<sup>T</sup> = [1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0]\n\n    So, the value of the new matrix C is [1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0].\n\n<<<\n[1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0]\n>>>"
