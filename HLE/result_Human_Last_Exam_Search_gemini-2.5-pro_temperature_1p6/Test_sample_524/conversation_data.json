    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA homogeneous continuum is a compact, connected metric space where for any two points, there exists a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps one point to the other. In the plane, a complete classification of these continua has been achieved.\n\nThe classes are:\n*   **The point:** This is the only degenerate homogeneous continuum.\n*   **The simple closed curve (or circle):** This was long thought to be the only non-degenerate example.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** Discovered by R. H. Bing in 1948, it is a non-degenerate, indecomposable continuum.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** Found by Bing and Jones in 1959, this is another non-degenerate example.\n\nIn 2014, L. Hoehn and L. Oversteegen proved that any non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane must be homeomorphic to one of these three examples. Therefore, including the degenerate case of a single point, there are a total of four such classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
