    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as samuraciclib (CT7001), to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined. Samuraciclib is a potent and selective inhibitor of CDK7.\n\nThe binding affinity is reported with an IC50 value, which measures the concentration of the inhibitor required to achieve 50% inhibition of the enzyme's activity. For samuraciclib, the IC50 value for CDK7 is 40 nM or 41 nM. This value indicates a high binding affinity between samuraciclib and CDK7.\n\nBased on the reported IC50 values, the binding affinity falls within the range of 0.1 to 100 nM.\n\n<<<B>>>"
