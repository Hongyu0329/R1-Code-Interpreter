    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$, we first need to understand the structure of such characters.\n\n### 1. Factorization of the Conductor\nThe conductor is $N=36036$. We find its prime factorization:\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### 2. Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N = \\prod_i p_i^{k_i}$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi_i$ with conductor $p_i^{k_i}$:\n$$ \\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13} $$\nwhere each $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a primitive character modulo $p^k$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$$ \\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) $$\nWe require this order to be 6. This implies that the order of each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be a divisor of 6.\n\n### 3. Analyzing Component Characters\nWe now determine the number of possible choices for each primitive component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ such that its order divides 6.\n\n*   **Conductor $2^2=4$**:\n    The group of Dirichlet characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one principal character of order 1 and one non-principal character of order 2. A character modulo 4 is primitive if it is not a character modulo 2. Since there is only one character modulo 2 (the principal one), there is $\\phi(4)-\\phi(2) = 2-1=1$ primitive character modulo 4. Its order is 2, which divides 6. So, there is **1** choice for $\\chi_{2^2}$.\n\n*   **Conductor $3^2=9$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $\\phi(9)=6$. The characters that are not primitive are those induced from modulo 3, of which there are $\\phi(3)=2$. These non-primitive characters have orders 1 and 2. The primitive characters modulo 9 are the remaining $6-2=4$ characters. Their orders must be divisors of 6 other than 1 and 2, so the possible orders are 3 and 6. The number of characters of order 3 is $\\phi(3)=2$, and the number of characters of order 6 is $\\phi(6)=2$. Both orders, 3 and 6, divide 6. Thus, there are $2+2=4$ choices for $\\chi_{3^2}$.\n\n*   **Conductor 7**:\n    The character group modulo 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. For a prime conductor $p$, all non-principal characters are primitive. We need to count the primitive characters whose orders divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Conductor 11**:\n    The character group modulo 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. We need primitive characters whose order divides both 10 and 6. The only common divisor greater than 1 is 2. The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. So there is **1** choice for $\\chi_{11}$.\n\n*   **Conductor 13**:\n    The character group modulo 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. We need primitive characters with an order that divides both 12 and 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n### 4. Combining the Components\nWe need to find the total number of combinations of these component characters such that the order of the final character $\\chi$ is exactly 6. Let the orders of the components be $d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13}$. We have:\n*   $d_4 = 2$\n*   $d_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $d_{11} = 2$\n*   $d_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is $\\text{lcm}(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13})$.\n*   Since $d_4=2$, the lcm is divisible by 2.\n*   Since $d_9$ must be 3 or 6, its order is divisible by 3. Thus, the lcm is divisible by 3.\nSince the lcm is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6. Furthermore, since all component orders are divisors of 6, their lcm must also be a divisor of 6. An integer that is a divisor of 6 and is divisible by 6 must be 6 itself.\nTherefore, any combination of the allowed component characters will result in a character of order exactly 6.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of characters = (choices for $\\chi_{4}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{9}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{7}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nThere are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\n\n<<<100>>>"
