    "I have performed the initial search and have gathered some information. Here's a summary of what I've found:\n\n*   **Lexicographical Order:** This is a generalization of dictionary order. For strings of the same length, the order is determined by the first differing character. There are variations in how to handle strings of different lengths. One common way, sometimes called \"shortlex\" or \"radix order\", is to first sort by length and then lexicographically. Another way is to compare character by character, and if one string is a prefix of another, the prefix is considered smaller. The user's query just says \"ordered lexically\", which could mean either of these. However, in the context of the set of *all* finite strings, the \"prefix\" rule is more common.\n*   **Order Type:** The search results discuss the countability of the set of finite strings over a finite alphabet. They confirm that this set is countably infinite. One way to see this is to list the strings first by length, and then lexicographically for each length (the \"shortlex\" ordering). This creates a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. This suggests that the order type is related to the natural numbers.\n*   **Order Type of Natural Numbers:** The order type of the set of natural numbers (0, 1, 2, ...) with the usual ≤ ordering is denoted by ω (omega).\n\nBased on this, if the lexicographical ordering is interpreted as sorting by length first (shortlex), the order type would be ω. Let's analyze the standard lexicographical order (where 'a' comes before 'aa').\n\nConsider the set of strings over {a, b, c, d}. The ordering would look like:\nε (empty string), a, aa, aaa, aaaa, ... , ab, ... , b, ba, ...\n\nLet's look at the sequence starting with 'a': a, aa, aaa, aaaa, ... This is an infinite increasing sequence, which itself has order type ω. After all of these 'a...' strings comes 'ab'. So we have a block of order type ω, followed by another element. This structure repeats.\n\nLet's refine our understanding. Let our alphabet be $A = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$ ordered as $a < b < c < d$. Let $S$ be the set of all finite strings over $A$. The lexicographical order on $S$ is defined as follows: for two strings $s_1$ and $s_2$, $s_1 < s_2$ if $s_1$ is a prefix of $s_2$, or if at the first position where they differ, the character in $s_1$ is smaller than the character in $s_2$.\n\nLet's write out the beginning of the ordered set:\nε\na\naa\naaa\n... (this is a sequence of type ω)\nab\naba\n...\nac\n...\nad\n...\nb\nba\n...\n\nThis structure is more complex than just ω. It seems to be a dense, countable linear ordering without a greatest or least element (if we don't consider the empty string, which is the least element). However, the set of *finite* strings is well-ordered under the shortlex order, but not under the standard lexicographical order. For example, the set {b, ab, aab, aaab, ...} has no least element in the standard lexicographical order if we were to consider infinite strings, but with finite strings 'b' is the greatest element and we have an infinite descending chain which has a limit point 'a' (if we were in a different space). However, the problem specifies the set of *finite* strings.\n\nLet's re-examine the shortlex order. If we order by length first, we get:\n1.  ε\n2.  a, b, c, d\n3.  aa, ab, ac, ad, ba, bb, bc, bd, ... , dd\n4.  aaa, ...\n\nThe set of all finite strings is the disjoint union of the sets of strings of length n, for n = 0, 1, 2, ...\nLet $S_n$ be the set of strings of length n. The size of $S_n$ is $4^n$.\nThe set of all finite strings is $S = \\bigcup_{n=0}^{\\infty} S_n$.\nIn the shortlex order, we have the order type of $S_0$ followed by the order type of $S_1$, then $S_2$, and so on.\nThe order type of $S_0$ (which contains only ε) is 1.\nThe order type of $S_1$ is 4.\nThe order type of $S_2$ is 16.\nThe order type of $S_n$ is $4^n$.\nSo the order type of $S$ under shortlex order is $1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + ... = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 4^n$. This is an infinite sum of finite numbers, which corresponds to the order type ω. Every string has a finite number of predecessors. For any string of length k, the number of preceding strings is $\\sum_{n=0}^{k-1} 4^n$ plus its position within the strings of length k. This confirms that it's a countable, well-ordered set with order type ω.\n\nNow, what if \"ordered lexically\" does not mean shortlex?\nThe standard lexicographical order is not a well-ordering. For example, the set {`b`, `ab`, `aab`, `aaab`, ...} has no least element. However, the question asks for the order type of the *set* of finite strings. This set *is* well-ordered by the standard lexicographical order if we assume shorter strings come before longer strings when one is a prefix of the other (e.g., 'a' < 'aa'). Let's verify this. Any non-empty subset of strings must have a string of minimal length. Among the strings of that minimal length, one must be lexicographically first. Therefore, the set is well-ordered.\n\nLet's re-examine the structure.\nε\na\naa\naaa\n... (an ω-sequence)\nab\n...\nb\n...\n\nThe search results didn't explicitly name the order type for this specific definition of lexicographical order on all finite strings. However, let's try to construct it.\n\nLet's map the strings to rational numbers in (0,1) in base 5. Let a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, and we use 0 as a terminator.\n'a' -> 0.1\n'b' -> 0.2\n...\n'd' -> 0.4\n'aa' -> 0.11\n'ab' -> 0.12\n...\n'ad' -> 0.14\n'ba' -> 0.21\n\nThis mapping preserves the order. For example, 'a' (0.1) < 'aa' (0.11). This is not the standard lexicographical order. Standard lexicographical order puts 'a' before 'aa'. A different mapping is needed.\n\nLet's consider the structure again. We have the empty string. Then we have 4 blocks of strings, one for each starting letter.\nThe set of all strings S = {ε} U {a}S U {b}S U {c}S U {d}S where {x}S is the set of strings starting with x.\nThis looks like a self-similar structure.\nLet η be the order type of the rational numbers. It's a countable dense linear order without endpoints.\nThe order on the set of finite strings is not dense. For example, there is nothing between 'a' and 'aa'. 'aa' is the immediate successor of 'a'. The successor of 'ad' is 'ada'. This is incorrect. The successor of 'd' is not 'da'.\n\nLet's list the order more carefully. Let's not forget the empty string ε.\nε\na\naa\naaa\n...\n(all strings of only 'a's, which is an ω sequence)\n...\naad\naada\n...\naae... wait, no 'e'.\naad\naadb...\naadc...\naadd...\nab\naba\n...\nb\n...\n\nLet's think about this from a number-theoretic point of view. Let's represent the strings as numbers in base 5. Let a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4. We can't just map strings to digits, as the length needs to be taken into account.\nThe mapping for shortlex to ω is clear: Given a string, you can count how many strings are before it.\nNumber of strings of length 0: 1\nNumber of strings of length 1: 4\nNumber of strings of length 2: 16\nA string like \"ba\" is preceded by all strings of length 0 and 1, so 1+4=5 strings. Within length 2 strings (aa, ab, ac, ad, ba, ...), \"ba\" is the 5th (index 4). So it corresponds to the natural number 5 + 4 = 9. This establishes a bijection with N, so the order type is ω. This ordering is commonly known as shortlex.\n\nThe other standard lexicographical ordering (where `a` < `aa`) does not order by length first. In this case, any string starting with `a` comes before any string starting with `b`.\nThe set of all strings is $S = \\{\\epsilon\\} \\cup S_a \\cup S_b \\cup S_c \\cup S_d$ where $S_x$ is the set of strings starting with character $x$.\nThe order is $\\epsilon < S_a < S_b < S_c < S_d$.\nWithin $S_a$, we have strings like `a`, `aa`, `ab`, etc. $S_a$ is composed of the string `a` followed by all strings that start with `a` and have length > 1.\nThe structure of $S_a$ is `a` followed by concatenating `a` with every string in $S$. So the order type of $S_a$ is $1 + \\tau$, where $\\tau$ is the order type of $S$ itself.\nSo, $\\tau = 1 + (1+\\tau) + (1+\\tau) + (1+\\tau) + (1+\\tau) = 1 + 4(1+\\tau) = 5 + 4\\tau$. This doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's reconsider the mapping. A string $s = c_1 c_2 ... c_k$ where $c_i \\in \\{a,b,c,d\\}$. Let's map these to the integers 1, 2, 3, 4. This is like a base-4 representation, but the length varies.\nThis is exactly what bijective numeration is, and it corresponds to the shortlex ordering. The resulting order type is ω.\n\nSo the main ambiguity is what \"ordered lexically\" means. In formal language theory, \"lexicographical order\" can refer to the ordering that is not length-first, while \"shortlex order\" is length-first. However, for the set of *all* finite strings, shortlex is a well-ordering of type ω, which is a very natural and common result. The other lexicographical ordering is more complex and less \"standard\" for the set of all finite strings, although it's standard for strings of a fixed length.\n\nGiven that the question is about the order type of the set of all finite strings, the most standard and simple interpretation is the one that gives a well-defined order type that can be easily described, which is ω. This corresponds to the shortlex ordering. The other ordering leads to a more complex recursive definition.\n\nLet's assume \"ordered lexically\" means the shortlex order.\n1. The set of characters is $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$, with size 4. We can order them, for example, a < b < c < d.\n2. We are considering the set of all *finite* strings over this alphabet.\n3. In shortlex order, strings are first sorted by length, and then lexicographically for strings of the same length.\n4. The empty string (length 0) comes first.\n5. Then come all strings of length 1: a, b, c, d.\n6. Then all strings of length 2: aa, ab, ac, ad, ba, ..., dd.\n7. Then all strings of length 3, and so on.\n8. We can create a one-to-one mapping from this ordered set of strings to the natural numbers. For any given string, we can count the finite number of strings that come before it.\n9. This defines a well-ordering. The order type of the natural numbers is ω.\n10. Therefore, the order type of the set of finite strings of characters {a, b, c, d} ordered lexically (in the sense of shortlex) is ω.\n\nIf the other lexicographical order is intended, the order type $\\tau$ would satisfy the equation $\\tau = 1 + 4\\tau$, where the 1 comes from the empty string, and the $4\\tau$ comes from the four blocks of strings starting with 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd', each of which has an order structure similar to the whole set. Let's re-evaluate this.\nThe set $S$ is ordered. The first element is $\\epsilon$. After that come all strings starting with 'a', then all starting with 'b', etc.\nLet the order type of $S$ be $\\tau$.\nThe set of strings starting with 'a' is $\\{a\\} \\cup \\{a\\}S$. The order type of this set is $1 + \\tau$. No, it's just `a` concatenated with all strings in `S`. So the set of strings starting with 'a' is order-isomorphic to S. Let's call this isomorphism $f(s) = \"a\" + s$.\nSo, $\\tau = 1 + \\tau_a + \\tau_b + \\tau_c + \\tau_d$.\nAnd $\\tau_a \\cong \\tau_b \\cong \\tau_c \\cong \\tau_d \\cong \\tau$.\nSo $\\tau = 1 + \\tau + \\tau + \\tau + \\tau = 1 + 4\\tau$.\nThis is a Cantor-style equation for ordinal numbers. Assuming we are working with ordinals, $\\tau = 1+4\\tau$ doesn't have a solution in the standard ordinals, as it would imply $3\\tau = -1$.\nHowever, we can think of it as a sum of ordered sets. The set of strings is ordered as:\n(empty string)\n(strings starting with a)\n(strings starting with b)\n(strings starting with c)\n(strings starting with d)\n\nThe set of strings starting with 'a' is itself ordered as:\n'a'\n'aa'\n'aaa'\n... (an ω sequence)\n'aab'\n...\n'ab'\n...\n\nThe structure is not simply a sum of copies of itself. The structure of the set of strings starting with `a` is not the same as the structure of the whole set of strings. The set `S` starts with `ε`, but the set of strings starting with `a` starts with `a`.\n\nLet's consider the mapping to ordinals.\nLet the alphabet be $\\{a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{k-1}\\}$. We are looking for the order type of the set of finite strings ordered lexicographically (not shortlex). Let this be $\\tau_k$.\nIf $k=1$, the alphabet is $\\{a_0\\}$. The strings are $\\epsilon, a_0, a_0a_0, a_0a_0a_0, \\dots$. This is an infinite sequence with a first element, where each element has an immediate successor. The order type is $\\omega$. So $\\tau_1 = \\omega$.\n\nNow for $k=4$. The strings are:\n$\\epsilon$ (1 element)\nThen all strings starting with 'a'. The set of strings $\\{'a'\\} \\cup \\{'a's | s \\in S\\}$ where S is the set of all strings. This set is order-isomorphic to $S$ with alphabet $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$. How? A string 's' in S is mapped to 'as'. This preserves the order. So the set of all strings starting with 'a' has order type $\\tau_4$.\nSimilarly for b, c, d.\nSo the total order is $1 + \\tau_4 + \\tau_4 + \\tau_4 + \\tau_4$. This is an ordinal sum.\n$\\tau_4 = 1 + 4\\tau_4$. Again this ordinal equation has no solution for $\\tau_4 > 0$.\n\nThere must be a misunderstanding in my analysis of the structure. Let's write it down again.\n$S = \\{\\epsilon\\} \\cup A \\cdot S^*$ where $S^*$ is the set of non-empty strings. No this is not helpful.\n\nLet's go back to basics.\nThe set of all finite strings over a finite alphabet is countable.\nThe shortlex order gives it the order type $\\omega$. This is because it's a well-ordering, and every element has a finite number of predecessors.\nWhat about the standard lexicographical order? Let's check if it's a well-ordering. Let $X$ be a non-empty subset of our set of strings $S$. Let $L$ be the set of lengths of strings in $X$. $L$ is a non-empty set of non-negative integers, so it has a minimum element, say $m$. Let $X_m$ be the subset of strings in $X$ with length $m$. $X_m$ is non-empty and finite. A finite totally ordered set has a least element. This is the least element of $X$. No, this logic is for shortlex.\n\nFor standard lexicographical order: Let $X$ be a non-empty subset of $S$. Let's find its least element.\nConsider the first character of all strings in $X$. There's a minimal first character, say 'b', because the alphabet is finite and ordered. Let $X_b$ be the subset of strings in $X$ that start with 'b'. If the empty string is in $X$, it's the least element. If not, all strings in $X$ have a first character. The strings in $X \\setminus X_b$ are all greater than the strings in $X_b$. So the least element of $X$ must be in $X_b$. Now consider all strings in $X_b$. We can strip the first character 'b' from them. This gives a new set of strings $X'$. $X'$ is a subset of $S$. Let its least element be $s'$. Then the least element of $X$ is 'b' followed by $s'$. This seems to define a recursive process for finding the least element. Does this process always terminate? Yes, because the strings are finite. So standard lexicographical order is also a well-ordering.\n\nSince it's a countable well-ordering, its order type must be a countable ordinal. What ordinal is it?\nLet's analyze the structure for alphabet $\\{a,b\\}$. Let the order type be $\\tau$.\nThe set is ordered as: $\\epsilon$, strings starting with 'a', strings starting with 'b'.\nThe set of strings starting with 'a' is just {'a's | s in S}. This is order-isomorphic to S.\nSo $\\tau = 1 + \\tau_a + \\tau_b$, and $\\tau_a \\cong \\tau_b \\cong \\tau$.\nSo $\\tau = 1 + \\tau + \\tau$. As an ordinal equation, this is $\\tau = 1 + 2\\tau$.\nLet's analyze the structure for $\\{a\\}$. Strings are $\\epsilon, a, aa, aaa, ...$. Order type is $\\omega$.\nSo $\\tau_1 = \\omega$.\nFor $\\{a,b\\}$, let's call the type $\\tau_2$.\nThe set starts with $\\epsilon$. (1)\nThen all strings starting with 'a'. This is an ordered set isomorphic to $\\tau_2$.\nThen all strings starting with 'b'. This is another ordered set isomorphic to $\\tau_2$.\nSo $\\tau_2 = 1 + \\tau_2 + \\tau_2 = 1 + 2 \\cdot \\tau_2$.\nThis equation can be solved if we think about Cantor Normal Form.\nLet $\\tau_2 = \\omega^\\alpha \\cdot c_n + \\dots + \\omega^{\\alpha_0} \\cdot c_0$.\nLet's try to construct the set.\n$\\epsilon$\na\na a\na a a... (type $\\omega$)\na b\na b a\na b a a ... (type $\\omega$)\na b b\na b b a ... (type $\\omega$)\n...\nLooks like every element is followed by an $\\omega$ sequence, or another element.\nConsider the ordinal $\\omega^\\omega$.\nAny ordinal $\\alpha < \\omega^\\omega$ can be written in Cantor normal form as $\\alpha = \\omega^{n}c_n + \\omega^{n-1}c_{n-1} + \\dots + c_0$ for some finite $n$ and natural numbers $c_i$.\nLet's map our strings to ordinals. Let the alphabet be $\\{c_0, ..., c_{n-1}\\}$.\nA string $s = d_k d_{k-1} ... d_0$ (reversed) can be mapped to the ordinal $\\omega^k c_{d_k} + \\dots + \\omega^0 c_{d_0}$ where $c_{d_i}$ is the index of the character $d_i$ in the alphabet (e.g., a=0, b=1, ...). Let's use indices 1 to n.\nLet the alphabet be {a,b,c,d}.\n'a' -> 1\n'b' -> 2\n'aa' -> $\\omega \\cdot 1 + 1$\n'ab' -> $\\omega \\cdot 1 + 2$\n'ba' -> $\\omega \\cdot 2 + 1$\nLet's check the ordering.\na=1, b=2, c=3, d=4.\naa = $\\omega+1$. Is a < aa? Is $1 < \\omega+1$? Yes.\nab = $\\omega+2$. Is aa < ab? Is $\\omega+1 < \\omega+2$? Yes.\nb = 2. Is ab < b? Is $\\omega+2 < 2$? No. So this mapping is not order-preserving.\n\nLet's try another mapping. Map the string $c_1 c_2 \\dots c_k$ (with indices $i_1, \\dots, i_k$ from $\\{1,..,4\\}$) to the ordinal $\\omega^{k-1}i_1 + \\omega^{k-2}i_2 + \\dots + \\omega^0 i_k$.\n'a' -> 1\n'b' -> 2\n'aa' -> $\\omega \\cdot 1 + 1$\n'ab' -> $\\omega \\cdot 1 + 2$\n'b' -> 2. We still have $\\omega+2$ vs 2. The length of the string must correspond to the highest power of $\\omega$.\nMap $c_1 c_2 ... c_k$ to $\\omega^k + \\omega^{k-1} i_1 + \\dots + \\omega^0 i_k$. This distinguishes by length first, so it's shortlex.\n\nLet's consider the structure as a tree. The nodes are the strings, the root is the empty string. The children of a node `s` are the strings `sa`, `sb`, `sc`, `sd`. This is an infinite 4-ary tree. The lexicographical order is a depth-first traversal of this tree.\nThe order is:\nε, a, aa, aaa, ..., ab, aba, ..., ac, ..., ad, ..., b, ba, ...\nAfter ε, we have the 'a' branch. The set of nodes in the 'a' subtree is order isomorphic to the whole tree (including root ε? No, excluding ε). Let T be the order type of the whole tree (S). T = 1 + T_a + T_b + T_c + T_d. Where T_x is the order type of the subtree starting at x. T_a consists of node 'a' and its descendants. The descendants of 'a' are {as | s in S}. This set of descendants is order isomorphic to T. So T_a = 1 + T.\nThis gives $T = 1 + (1+T) + (1+T) + (1+T) + (1+T) = 1 + 4(1+T) = 5+4T$. Still getting this equation which has no solution for ordinals. The isomorphism must be wrong.\n\nLet's look at it differently.\nConsider the mapping from strings to numbers in base 5 in the interval [0,1).\nLet a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4. And the end of a string is marked by 0.\n'a' -> 0.1\n'aa' -> 0.11\n'ab' -> 0.12\n'b' -> 0.2\nOrder: 0.1 < 0.11 < 0.12 < 0.2. This corresponds to a < aa < ab < b. This is the lexicographical order.\nThe set of all finite strings corresponds to the set of all terminating base-5 decimals using digits {1,2,3,4}. This is a subset of the rational numbers.\nWhat is the order type of this set?\nIt's a countable dense linear ordering. Between any two such numbers, you can find another (e.g., between 0.1 and 0.2, there is 0.11). It has a least element, 0 (corresponding to ε, maybe map ε to 0?). But then ε would come before 'a' (0.1). Let's say ε is not included for a moment.\nThe set {terminating base-k decimals} is order-isomorphic to the set of rational numbers. The standard proof for the rationals being dense and countable applies here.\nFor example, the dyadic rationals (terminating base-2 decimals) are order-isomorphic to the rationals.\nThe order type of the rational numbers is η.\nThis ordering is dense. Is the lexicographical order on finite strings dense? Yes. Between \"a\" and \"b\", there's \"aa\". Between \"a\" and \"aa\", there is no string. So it's not dense. \"aa\" is the immediate successor of \"a\".\nSo my numerical mapping above was wrong.\n'a' < 'aa'. So what's between them? Nothing. 'aa' is the successor of 'a'.\nLet's analyze the successors.\nsuccessor(ε) = a\nsuccessor(a) = aa\nsuccessor(b) = ba\nsuccessor(d) = da ... this is not correct. The alphabet is {a,b,c,d}.\nsuccessor(s): if s does not end with 'd', say s = t + c where c is not 'd', then succ(s) = t + succ(c). So succ('a')='b', succ('b')='c', succ('c')='d'.\nWhat is succ('d')? It is not 'da'. It is 'aa'. Let's verify. d < aa? Yes. Is there anything between d and aa? No. Any string shorter than 'aa' is just one character, and 'd' is the largest. Any two-char string starts with 'a', so 'aa' is the smallest. So, succ(d) = aa.\nWhat is succ('ad')? It's 'b'. 'ad' < 'b'? Yes. Is there anything in between? A string between 'ad' and 'b' must start with 'a' and be longer than 'ad', e.g. 'ada', 'adb', etc. or it could be a different 2-char string like 'ae', but 'e' is not in the alphabet. All strings starting with 'a' and having length > 1 come after 'a'. 'ad' is one of them. The next string is 'b'. OK, successor('ad') = 'b'.\nSuccessor('dd') = 'aaa'.\nSuccessor of $c_1...c_k$ where all $c_i=d$: $a^{k+1}$.\nSuccessor of $c_1...c_{k-1}c_k$ where $c_k \\neq d$: $c_1...c_{k-1}(c_k+1)$. This is wrong. It's 'b'. 'a'<'b'. successor of 'a' is 'b'. NO! successor of 'a' is 'aa'. My reasoning that 'aa' is successor of 'a' is because there is nothing between them. Let's check again. Any string 'x' s.t. 'a' < 'x' < 'aa'. 'x' cannot be a prefix of 'a', so length must be > 1. Let 'x' be 'ay...'. Then 'a' is a prefix of 'x', so 'a' < 'x'. Now compare 'x' and 'aa'. 'x' must be 'a' + something. The \"something\" must be non-empty. Let that something be 'y'. So x='ay'. 'ay' vs 'aa'. If y starts with 'a' or something bigger, then x >= 'aa'. So there is nothing between 'a' and 'aa'. Correct. Successor('a') = 'aa'.\n\nThe set is S = {ε, a, b, c, d, aa, ab, ac, ad, ba, ...}. This is the shortlex ordering. And its order type is ω.\nWhy did my previous analysis point to issues?\nLexicographical order can have multiple specific definitions.\n1. Length-first, then alphabetical (shortlex). Resulting order type: ω.\n2. Alphabetical, with prefix < word (e.g. a < aa).\n\nLet's assume the question implies shortlex, as it's the most \"well-behaved\" ordering for the set of *all* finite strings and directly corresponds to a fundamental ordinal, ω. If the other ordering is used, the order type is a more complex countable ordinal. It's the ordinal $\\alpha$ that is the solution to $\\alpha = \\sum_{i=0}^{4^n-1} \\omega = \\omega \\cdot 4^n$ ... No.\n\nLet's re-read the search results.\nResult says: \"It is not true that the set of all finite words is well-ordered; for example, the infinite set of words {b, ab, aab, aaab, ... } has no lexicographically earliest element.\" This is a crucial point I missed. The standard lexicographical order (not shortlex) on the set of all finite strings is NOT a well-ordering. Therefore, it does not have an ordinal number as its order type. Ordinal numbers are by definition the order types of well-ordered sets.\n\nSo, if the question is asking for an \"order type\", it implies an ordering that has one, which would have to be a well-ordering. Shortlex is a well-ordering. The other standard lexicographical ordering is not. This strongly suggests that \"ordered lexically\" should be interpreted as the shortlex ordering.\n\nLet's double-check the \"not well-ordered\" claim. Consider the set X = {b, ab, aab, aaab, ...}. Let's order it lexicographically.\nab < b\naab < ab\naaab < aab\n...\nThis is an infinite descending chain: b > ab > aab > aaab > ...\nA total order is a well-order if and only if it contains no infinite descending chains. Since the standard lexicographical order contains an infinite descending chain, it is not a well-order.\n\nSo, the set of finite strings of characters {a,b,c,d} ordered by the standard lexicographical order is not a well-ordered set, and thus its order type is not an ordinal.\n\nHowever, the question asks \"What is the order type\". This implies there is one. There might be a different definition of \"order type\" for non-well-ordered sets. The main one is η, the order type of the rationals. A set has order type η if it is countable, dense, and has no endpoints.\nIs the set of strings under lexicographical order dense? No. 'a' has an immediate successor 'aa'.\nSo it's not η either.\n\nWhat now? There are two possibilities.\n1.  The question implies an ordering that is a well-ordering, which would be the shortlex order. In that case the answer is ω.\n2.  The question uses \"lexically\" in the sense that is not a well-ordering, and there is some other description for its order type.\n\nWhat could this other description be?\nLet's consider the structure again: $S \\cong \\{\\epsilon\\} \\cup S_a \\cup S_b \\cup S_c \\cup S_d$. Where $S_x$ is the set of strings starting with $x$. Lexicographically, $S_a < S_b < S_c < S_d$.\nLet $f_x: S \\to S_x$ be the map $s \\mapsto xs$. This is an order-preserving bijection. So all $S_x$ are order-isomorphic to $S$.\nLet $\\tau$ be the order type. Then $\\tau$ is the type of the ordered sum $1 + \\tau + \\tau + \\tau + \\tau$.\nThis is not an ordinal sum. It is a sum of general linear orders.\nThis structure is a tree that is traversed depth-first. Let the order type of the natural numbers be $\\omega = \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$ and the integers be $\\zeta = \\{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\\}$.\nThe example of an infinite descending chain was b > ab > aab > ... . The limit of this sequence is the infinite string \"aaa...\". But we are restricted to finite strings.\n\nThe set of rational numbers in (0,1) can be represented as a tree as well (the Stern-Brocot tree or Calkin-Wilf tree). But the ordering there is different.\n\nLet's stick with the most likely interpretation: for the set of *all* finite strings from an alphabet, the most natural and mathematically significant ordering that has a well-known order type is the shortlex ordering. This ordering arranges the strings into a sequence that is isomorphic to the natural numbers. The order type of the natural numbers is ω. Any other interpretation leads to an order that is not well-ordered and does not have a standard simple name for its order type. Given the context of a straightforward question, the most straightforward interpretation is the intended one.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n1. Define the set: S is the set of all finite strings over the alphabet A = {a, b, c, d}.\n2. Define the order: The question says \"ordered lexically\". This term can be ambiguous. One interpretation is shortlex order, where strings are ordered by length first, then alphabetically. Another is pure lexicographical order, where 'a' < 'aa'.\n3. Analyze the pure lexicographical order. It is not a well-ordering because it allows for infinite descending sequences (e.g., b > ab > aab > ...). Sets that are not well-ordered do not have an ordinal number as their order type.\n4. Analyze the shortlex order. This order is a well-ordering. We can enumerate all strings in this order: ε, a, b, c, d, aa, ab, ... . This creates a bijection with the natural numbers.\n5. The order type of a countably infinite set that is well-ordered such that every element has a finite number of predecessors is ω.\n6. Conclude that the most reasonable interpretation of the question is that \"ordered lexically\" refers to the shortlex ordering, leading to the order type ω.\n\nTo be very sure, I'll do one final check on how these terms are used in set theory texts.The final check confirms the initial analysis. Here is a breakdown of the findings:\n\n*   There are two common ways to define a lexicographical order on the set of all finite strings.\n    *   **Standard lexicographical order (dictionary order):** This compares strings character by character. To handle different lengths, shorter strings are treated as if they were padded with a special character that is smaller than any character in the alphabet. A key property of this ordering is that a string is smaller than any of its proper extensions (e.g., \"cat\" < \"caterpillar\"). However, as multiple sources confirm, this ordering on the set of *all* finite strings is **not** a well-ordering. This is because it allows for infinite descending chains, such as `b > ab > aab > aaab > ...`. Since it is not a well-ordered set, its order type is not an ordinal number. It is also not a dense ordering (like the rational numbers, order type η), because for instance, \"aa\" is the immediate successor of \"a\".\n    *   **Shortlex order (or length-lexicographical order):** This ordering first sorts strings by their length (shortest first) and then uses lexicographical order to sort strings of the same length.\n\n*   The crucial point is that an \"order type\" in the context of ordinals requires the set to be well-ordered. Since the standard lexicographical order is not a well-ordering, the question must be referring to an ordering that is.\n\n*   The shortlex order on the set of all finite strings over a finite alphabet is a well-ordering. We can list every string in a definite sequence: first the single string of length 0 (the empty string), then the $4^1$ strings of length 1 in alphabetical order, then the $4^2$ strings of length 2 in alphabetical order, and so on.\n\n*   This enumeration creates a one-to-one correspondence between the set of strings and the set of natural numbers ($\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$). For any given string, there is a finite number of strings that precede it. This is the definition of a well-ordered set with an order type of **ω** (omega), which is the order type of the natural numbers.\n\nTherefore, the only sensible interpretation of the question that yields a standard order type is to assume the \"lexical ordering\" refers to the shortlex order.\n\nFinal conclusion: The set of finite strings over {a, b, c, d} ordered by length and then lexicographically (shortlex order) can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers. The order type of the natural numbers is ω.\n\nI am ready to provide the final answer.\nThe order type of the set of finite strings of characters {a, b, c, d} when ordered lexically is best interpreted as being ordered by the **shortlex order**. This is because the standard \"dictionary-style\" lexicographical order does not result in a well-ordered set, which is a prerequisite for having an order type represented by an ordinal number.\n\nHere's the reasoning for the shortlex order:\n1.  **Definition of Shortlex Order**: In the shortlex order, strings are first sorted by their length, with shorter strings coming before longer strings. Strings of the same length are then sorted alphabetically.\n\n2.  **Enumeration**: This ordering allows for a systematic enumeration of all possible strings, starting with the empty string:\n    *   Length 0: ε (1 string)\n    *   Length 1: a, b, c, d (4 strings)\n    *   Length 2: aa, ab, ac, ad, ba, bb, ..., dd (16 strings)\n    *   Length 3: aaa, aab, ..., ddd (64 strings)\n    *   ... and so on.\n\n3.  **Well-Ordering and Correspondence to Natural Numbers**: This ordering is a well-ordering because every non-empty subset of the strings will have a string of minimal length, and among those, there will be a lexicographically first one. We can establish a one-to-one correspondence between this ordered set of strings and the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). For any string, there are only a finite number of strings that come before it.\n\n4.  **Order Type ω (Omega)**: An infinite set that can be well-ordered in such a way that it has a starting element and every element has a finite number of predecessors has the order type of the natural numbers, which is denoted by **ω**.\n\nIn contrast, the standard lexicographical order (where \"a\" comes before \"aa\") is not a well-ordering for the set of all finite strings because it contains infinite descending chains (e.g., b > ab > aab > aaab > ...). A set that is not well-ordered does not have an ordinal number as its order type. Since the question asks for an order type, it implies an ordering for which such a type can be assigned, making shortlex the standard and intended interpretation.\n\n<<<ω>>>"
