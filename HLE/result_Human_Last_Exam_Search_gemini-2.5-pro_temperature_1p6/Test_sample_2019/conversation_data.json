    "The problem of placing non-attacking queens on a toroidal chessboard is a classic combinatorial problem. A toroidal board is one where the edges wrap around, meaning a queen on the edge of the board can attack pieces on the opposite edge.\n\nTo find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board, we can follow a structured mathematical approach:\n\n1.  **Defining the Conditions:** Let the position of a queen be given by coordinates (row, column), or (r, c), starting from 0 to 4. For four queens to be non-attacking, they must not share the same row, column, main diagonal, or anti-diagonal. On a toroidal board, these conditions are expressed using modular arithmetic:\n    *   All rows (r) must be distinct.\n    *   All columns (c) must be distinct.\n    *   All main diagonal indices (c - r) mod 5 must be distinct.\n    *   All anti-diagonal indices (c + r) mod 5 must be distinct.\n\n2.  **The \"Missing Point\" Method:** When placing 4 queens on a 5x5 board, there will be exactly one unused row, one unused column, one unused main diagonal, and one unused anti-diagonal. Let's denote these missing indices as `r_m`, `c_m`, `d_m`, and `s_m`. A key insight is that these \"missing\" indices are related in the same way as the coordinates of a point on the board:\n    *   `d_m = (c_m - r_m) mod 5`\n    *   `s_m = (c_m + r_m) mod 5`\n\n    This means that each of the 25 possible pairs of a missing row and a missing column, for example (`r_m`, `c_m`), uniquely determines the missing diagonal and anti-diagonal indices. These 25 unique combinations can be thought of as different \"species\" or \"types\" of solutions.\n\n3.  **Symmetry and Transitivity:** The structure of the toroidal board has a high degree of symmetry. Any valid arrangement of queens can be translated horizontally and vertically to produce another valid solution. For instance, if a set of queen positions is a solution, shifting every queen by `a` rows and `b` columns results in a new valid solution. This property of translation ensures that the number of solutions for each of the 25 \"species\" is the same. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 25 multiplied by the number of solutions for any single species.\n\n4.  **Calculating for One Species:** We can calculate the number of solutions for a single, convenient species and then multiply by 25. Let's choose the species where the unused row and column are both index 4 (i.e., `r_m=4`, `c_m=4`). This means the four queens must be placed in rows {0, 1, 2, 3} and columns {0, 1, 2, 3}.\n    For this case, a thorough check of all possible permutations reveals that there are exactly two valid configurations of the four queens.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Since there are 2 solutions for one specific species, and there are 25 equally sized species, the total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is:\n    Total Ways = (Number of Species) × (Solutions per Species) = 25 × 2 = 50.\n\nTherefore, there are 50 distinct ways to place four non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
