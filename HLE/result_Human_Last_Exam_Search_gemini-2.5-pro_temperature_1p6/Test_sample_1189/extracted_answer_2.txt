Let \( f_m \) be the number of sets \( T \) that satisfy the given conditions for positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). The value of \( f_m \) can be determined by the following recurrence relation for \( m \ge 2 \):
$$ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1)f_{m-2} \right) $$
The base cases for the recurrence are:
$$ f_0 = 1 $$
$$ f_1 = 0 $$
Note that although \( m \) is given as a positive integer, the base case \( f_0 \) is used in the calculation for \( m=2 \). The calculation of \( f_m \) for any \( m \ge 1 \) can be initiated with the values \( f_1 = 0 \) and \( f_2 = 0 \), if preferred. Using the hint, where \( a = \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} \), the recurrence can be written as:
$$ f_m = \frac{1}{m} (a - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1)f_{m-2}) $$
