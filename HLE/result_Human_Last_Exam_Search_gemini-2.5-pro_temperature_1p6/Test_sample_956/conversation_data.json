    "The problem asks for the number of proper subgroups, up to isomorphism, of the Schur multiplier of a group G. The group G is generated by three permutations, `a`, `b`, and `c`, acting on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z}.\n\nFirst, we must identify the group G. The generators act on a set of 12 elements. By their structure, they are consistent with generators for the Mathieu group M12. The group M12 is a sporadic simple group of order 95,040.\n\nNext, we need to determine the Schur multiplier of M12, which we denote as A. The Schur multiplier of M12 is a cyclic group of order 2, commonly denoted as Z₂. There was some initial confusion in the mathematical community about this, but it was clarified by Burgoyne and Fong in 1968.\n\nNow we must find the number of proper subgroups of A = Z₂, up to isomorphism. The subgroups of Z₂ are the trivial subgroup {e} (which is isomorphic to Z₁) and the group Z₂ itself. A proper subgroup of a group is a subgroup that is not equal to the group itself. Therefore, the only proper subgroup of Z₂ is the trivial subgroup.\n\nUp to isomorphism, there is only one trivial group, Z₁. Thus, there is only one proper subgroup of A = Z₂ up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<1>>>"
