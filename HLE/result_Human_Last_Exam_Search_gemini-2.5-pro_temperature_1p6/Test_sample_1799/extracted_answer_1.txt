The claim that the second postulate of special relativity can be deduced from the first is a subject of debate. While it's true that the first postulate, combined with assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy of space, leads to the Lorentz transformations which feature a universal invariant speed, these extra assumptions are not strictly part of the first postulate. Therefore, the standard and most direct formulation of special relativity considers both postulates as independent and necessary. The second postulate is what singles out the speed of light as this universal speed, a fact confirmed by experiment.
