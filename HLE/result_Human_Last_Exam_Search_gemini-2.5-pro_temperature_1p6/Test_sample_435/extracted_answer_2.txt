Based on the evidence, Interleukin-15 is predicted to enhance the secretion of effector cytokines like IFN-γ and TNF-α from CAR T cells upon antigen stimulation, particularly in a sustained manner, when compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. The effect on cytokines associated with Cytokine Release Syndrome is more complex, with some evidence suggesting a potentially more controlled release, which could lead to a better safety profile.
