    "To find the index of the boundary-value problem, we first need to determine the dimension of the system of differential equations and the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n### Analysis of the System of Differential Equations\n\nThe problem is given by `x'(t) = Ax(t) + I(t)`. The matrix `A` is specified as a 202000x202000 diagonal matrix, and the vector `I(t)` has 202000 components. This means we are dealing with a system of `n = 202000` first-order ordinary differential equations. Although the vector `x(t)` is notationally shown with only 2024 components, the dimensions of `A` and `I` define the overall size of the system.\n\n### Analysis of the Boundary Conditions\n\nThe problem provides the following six boundary conditions:\n1.  `x₁(T) - x₁(0) = 0`\n2.  `x₂(T) - x₂(0) = 0`\n3.  `5x₂(T) - 5x₂(0) = 0`\n4.  `100x₂(T) - 100x₂(0) = 0`\n5.  `1000x₂(0) - 1000x₂(T) = 0`\n6.  `100x₂₀₂₄(T) - 100x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`\n\nWe must determine how many of these conditions are linearly independent.\n*   The first condition, `x₁(T) - x₁(0) = 0`, is a single independent condition on the component `x₁`.\n*   The next four conditions all relate to the component `x₂`:\n    *   `x₂(T) - x₂(0) = 0`\n    *   `5(x₂(T) - x₂(0)) = 0`, which is a multiple of the previous one.\n    *   `100(x₂(T) - x₂(0)) = 0`, also a multiple.\n    *   `-1000(x₂(T) - x₂(0)) = 0`, again a multiple.\n    These four conditions are linearly dependent, and they all reduce to the single independent condition `x₂(T) - x₂(0) = 0`.\n*   The sixth condition, `100(x₂₀₂₄(T) - x₂₀₂₄(0)) = 0`, simplifies to `x₂₀₂₄(T) - x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`. Since this applies to a different component (`x₂₀₂₄`), it is independent of the others.\n\nCounting the unique, independent conditions, we have one for `x₁`, one for `x₂`, and one for `x₂₀₂₄`. Therefore, there are `m = 3` linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n### Calculating the Index\n\nFor a linear boundary-value problem for a system of `n` first-order ordinary differential equations subject to `m` linearly independent boundary conditions, the problem can be described by a Fredholm operator. The index of this operator is given by the formula:\n`Index = n - m`\n\nIn this case:\n*   The dimension of the system of ODEs is `n = 202000`.\n*   The number of linearly independent boundary conditions is `m = 3`.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n`Index = 202000 - 3 = 201997`\n\n<<<201997>>>"
