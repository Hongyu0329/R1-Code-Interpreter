    "The closest province to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\nWaskaganish is a Cree community situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay in the Nord-du-Qu√©bec region. The body of water to the west of Waskaganish is James Bay, which separates the province of Quebec from the province of Ontario.\n\nThe traditional territory of the Cree people in this area, known as Eeyou Istchee, includes land in what is now both northern Quebec and northern Ontario. Several maps and geographical descriptions confirm that the western coast of James Bay belongs to Ontario. The province of Ontario lies directly across James Bay from Waskaganish.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
