In the context of advanced fuzzy logic systems and Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs), the mathematical formulation that characterizes the vertical cross-sections for a fixed primary input variable `x` and a secondary input variable `u`, using Gaussian-based membership paradigms, is defined by an Upper Membership Function (UMF) and a Lower Membership Function (LMF).

The **Upper Membership Function (UMF)**, `μ̅_Ã(u|x)`, is given by a Gaussian function:
`μ̅_Ã(u|x) = exp( -1/2 * ( (u - c(x)) / σ(x) )^2 )`

The **Lower Membership Function (LMF)**, `μ_Ã(u|x)`, is a scaled and modified Gaussian function:
`μ_Ã(u|x) = λ * exp( -1/2 * ( (u - c(x)) / σ*(x) )^2 )`

The parameters are defined as:
*   `c(x)`: The mean of the Gaussian function, dependent on the primary input `x`.
*   `σ(x)`: The standard deviation of the Gaussian function for the UMF.
*   `λ`: The `LowerScale` parameter, where `0 ≤ λ ≤ 1`.
*   `σ*(x)`: The modified standard deviation for the LMF, which incorporates the `LowerLag` parameter `l` (where `0 < l ≤ 1`). A common formulation is `σ*(x) = σ(x) * (ln(l) / ln(ε))`, where `ε` is a small machine-dependent constant.
