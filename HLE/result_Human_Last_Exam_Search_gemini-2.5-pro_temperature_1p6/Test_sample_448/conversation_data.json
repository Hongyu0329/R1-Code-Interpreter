    "The rarest noble gas on Earth, as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002, was **Radon**.\n\nThe noble gases, a group of chemical elements with similar properties, are generally rare in the Earth's atmosphere and crust. While Argon is the most abundant, making up about 0.934% of the atmosphere, the abundances of the other noble gases are significantly lower. For the stable noble gases, the general order of abundance in the atmosphere is Argon, followed by Neon, Helium, Krypton, and Xenon, making Xenon the rarest of the stable noble gases.\n\nHowever, the question encompasses all noble gases, including radioactive ones. Radon is a noble gas that is naturally occurring, but it is radioactive with a very short half-life of only 3.8 days for its most stable isotope. Due to its rapid decay into other elements, the concentration of Radon in the atmosphere and throughout all terrestrial matter at any given time is exceptionally low, far lower than even Xenon. Its fleeting existence ensures it is the rarest of the naturally occurring noble gases. The year 2002 does not alter this fact, as the fundamental properties and resulting abundances of these elements are consistent over very long timescales. Another noble gas, Oganesson, has been synthesized but does not occur naturally on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
