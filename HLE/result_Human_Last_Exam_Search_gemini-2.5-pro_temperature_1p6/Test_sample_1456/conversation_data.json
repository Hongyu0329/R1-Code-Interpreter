    "By a continuum, we mean a compact connected metric space. The product of two such spaces, let's call them X and Y, results in a new continuum, X × Y. The question asks for the largest possible number of composants in this product space.\n\nA composant of a point *p* in a continuum is the set of all points that can be connected to *p* by a proper subcontinuum. A key concept here is that of an indecomposable continuum—one that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n\nThe number of composants in a continuum depends on whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n*   Decomposable continua have a small number of composants, either one or three.\n*   A metrizable indecomposable continuum, however, has **c** composants, where **c** is the cardinality of the continuum (the number of real numbers).\n\nTo achieve the largest possible number of composants in the product space X × Y, we should choose X and Y to be continua that are themselves rich in composants. This leads to selecting indecomposable continua for both X and Y. Nondegenerate indecomposable continua, such as the pseudo-arc or the buckethandle continuum, are well-known examples in topology.\n\nWhen X and Y are both indecomposable continua, their product, X × Y, is also an indecomposable continuum. Since X and Y are metric spaces, their product X × Y is also a metrizable continuum. As a metrizable indecomposable continuum, the product space X × Y must have **c** composants.\n\nThis represents the maximum possible value. If one or both of the continua were decomposable, the resulting product would also be decomposable, and the number of composants would be significantly smaller (either 1 or 3). Therefore, the largest possible number of composants is achieved when both factor spaces are indecomposable.\n\n<<<c>>>"
