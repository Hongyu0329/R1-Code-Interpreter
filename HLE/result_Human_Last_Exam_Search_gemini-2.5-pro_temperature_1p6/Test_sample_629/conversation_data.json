    "The minimal grid number for a trefoil knot, which is the simplest non-trivial knot, is 5. This is because the trefoil is a (2,3)-torus knot, and the minimal grid number (or arc index) for a (p,q)-torus knot is p+q.\n\nResearch has shown that there are a total of 10 distinct grid diagrams with a grid number of 5 that represent trefoil knots. The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image; these two forms are known as the left-handed and right-handed trefoil. The 10 minimal grid diagrams are split between these two chiralities.\n\nSpecifically, one study illustrates the 5 minimal grid diagrams for the right-handed trefoil knot. Due to the symmetry between a knot and its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil knot also has 5 corresponding minimal grid diagrams. These 5 diagrams for each chirality represent the unique configurations up to translation and rotation.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot up to translation and rotation.\n\n<<<E>>>"
