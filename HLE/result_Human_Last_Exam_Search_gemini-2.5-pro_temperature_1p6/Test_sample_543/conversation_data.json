    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in THF followed by an aqueous work-up results in the formation of 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\nIn this Grignard reaction, the phenyl groups from the excess phenyl magnesium bromide will substitute all three halogen atoms on the benzene ring. The reactivity of the halogens in this type of reaction is in the order of I > Br > Cl. This means the iodine at position 2 will react first, followed by the two bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3. Because phenyl magnesium bromide is used in excess, there is a sufficient amount to replace all halogen atoms. The resulting product is a central benzene ring with phenyl groups attached at the first, second, and third positions. The aqueous work-up serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent.\n\nThe IUPAC name for the resulting molecule (C₂₄H₁₈) is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
