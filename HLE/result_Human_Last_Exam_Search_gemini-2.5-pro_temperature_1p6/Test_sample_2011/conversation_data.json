    "To determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes in a graph with 128 vertices, we need to understand the relationship between cliques of different sizes within the same graph.\n\nA clique is a subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. This means the subgraph induced by these vertices is a complete graph.\n\nLet's consider a graph G that contains a clique of a certain size, say `k`. This means there is a set of `k` vertices in G where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in that set. If we take any subset of these `k` vertices, for example a subset of size `j` where `1 <= j < k`, this smaller subset of `j` vertices will also have all its vertices connected to each other. Consequently, this subset forms a clique of size `j`.\n\nThis leads to a crucial conclusion: if a graph has a clique of size `k_max`, it necessarily also contains cliques of all sizes from 1 to `k_max`. Therefore, the set of all possible clique sizes in a graph is always of the form {1, 2, ..., `k_max`}, where `k_max` is the size of the largest clique in the graph (also known as the clique number, Ï‰(G)). The number of different clique sizes is thus equal to the size of the maximum clique, `k_max`.\n\nThe problem is now simplified to finding the maximum possible clique size for a graph with n = 128 vertices. The size of any clique is, by definition, limited by the total number of vertices in the graph. For a graph with 128 vertices, no clique can have more than 128 vertices.\n\nTo achieve the maximum, we can consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted as K_128. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The set of all 128 vertices forms a clique of size 128. Based on our earlier reasoning, this graph also contains cliques of all integer sizes from 1 to 128.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph with 128 vertices is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
