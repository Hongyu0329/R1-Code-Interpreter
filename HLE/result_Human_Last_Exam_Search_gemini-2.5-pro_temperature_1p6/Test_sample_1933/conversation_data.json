    "Let $S$ be a schema with $k$ unary predicates. The VC dimension of the set of formulas in first-order logic (FO) with one free variable over this schema is known to be $k$. Let's analyze the specific fragment in question to see how it compares.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Classifiers\n\nThe classifiers in this context are the formulas of the logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ that have exactly one free variable, let's call it $x$. These formulas define subsets of a given domain of elements.\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ in this fragment is constructed using only the existential quantifier ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$). The basic atomic formulas are the unary predicates from the schema $S$ applied to variables, e.g., $P_i(x)$. Since there are no binary predicates, variables cannot be directly related to each other.\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in this language can be simplified. It will be a conjunction of atomic formulas involving $x$ and some other sentences (formulas with no free variables). A sentence within the formula, like `∃y. P_1(y) ∧ P_2(y)`, is either true or false for the entire structure (or database).\n\nSo, any classifier $\\phi(x)$ can be written in the form:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\left(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)\\right) \\land S_1 \\land S_2 \\land \\dots$\nwhere each $P_i(x)$ is a predicate applied to the free variable $x$, and each $S_j$ is a sentence.\n\nFor any given structure, each sentence $S_j$ is either true or false.\n*   If any sentence $S_j$ is false, the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ is false for all $x$, defining the empty set. This is equivalent to the classifier $\\bot$.\n*   If all sentences $S_j$ are true, the formula simplifies to $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$.\n\nTherefore, for any given structure, the set of concepts (subsets of the domain) we can define is limited to those definable by formulas of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some subset of indices $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, plus the empty set. These formulas are known as **monomials** over the predicates.\n\n### 2. Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension is the size of the largest set of elements that can be shattered by the concept class.\n\n**Upper Bound (VC-dim ≤ 4)**\n\nA monomial is defined by the subset of predicates it includes. Since there are 4 predicates, there are $2^4 = 16$ possible subsets of predicates, and thus at most 16 distinct monomial formulas. These are:\n*   $\\top$ (empty conjunction)\n*   $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$ (4 formulas)\n*   $P_1(x) \\land P_2(x), \\dots$ (6 formulas)\n*   $P_1(x) \\land P_2(x) \\land P_3(x), \\dots$ (4 formulas)\n*   $P_1(x) \\land P_2(x) \\land P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$ (1 formula)\n\nThese 16 formulas, plus the potential for the empty set concept (which may or may not be definable by one of the monomials depending on the structure), form our hypothesis space. The total number of distinct concepts on any structure is at most $16$.\n\nTo shatter a set of size $d$, we must be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets. If we try to shatter a set of size 5, we would need to realize $2^5 = 32$ different subsets. Since we can generate at most 16 (or 17) distinct subsets, we cannot shatter a set of size 5. Therefore, the VC dimension must be less than 5.\n\n**Lower Bound (VC-dim ≥ 4)**\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must find a set of 4 elements that can be shattered. This involves constructing a specific universe and interpretation of the predicates.\n\nLet the universe be the set $A = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$. We define the 4 unary predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ on this set as follows:\n$P_j(a_i)$ is true if and only if $i \\neq j$.\n\nThis can be visualized as a truth table, where the entry in row $i$ and column $j$ represents the truth value of $P_j(a_i)$:\n\n|       | $P_1$ | $P_2$ | $P_3$ | $P_4$ |\n| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $a_1$ | False | True  | True  | True  |\n| $a_2$ | True  | False | True  | True  |\n| $a_3$ | True  | True  | False | True  |\n| $a_4$ | True  | True  | True  | False |\n\nNow, we must show that for any subset $B \\subseteq A$, there exists a monomial formula $\\phi(x)$ that is true for all elements in $B$ and false for all elements not in $B$.\n\n*   **To select an individual element `{a_k}`**: Use the formula $\\phi(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\neq k} P_j(x)$. For example, to select `{a_1}`, the formula is $P_2(x) \\land P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$. This formula is true for $a_1$ and false for all other $a_i$ (since $a_i$ has a 'False' for $P_i$).\n*   **To select a subset `B`**: Let $I_B = \\{k \\mid a_k \\notin B\\}$. We construct the formula $\\phi_B(x) = \\bigwedge_{k \\in I_B} P_k(x)$.\n    *   For any element $a_i \\in B$, it holds that $i \\notin I_B$. Thus, for all $k \\in I_B$, $k \\neq i$. By our construction, $P_k(a_i)$ is true. So the conjunction $\\phi_B(a_i)$ is true.\n    *   For any element $a_i \\notin B$, it holds that $i \\in I_B$. Thus, the predicate $P_i(x)$ is part of the conjunction in $\\phi_B(x)$. By our construction, $P_i(a_i)$ is false, making the entire conjunction $\\phi_B(a_i)$ false.\n*   **To select the empty set `∅`**: We can use the formula $P_1(x) \\land P_2(x) \\land P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$. This formula is false for every element $a_i$, since $P_i(a_i)$ is false.\n*   **To select the entire set `A`**: We can use the formula $\\top$ (the empty conjunction).\n\nSince we have demonstrated a construction that shatters a set of size 4, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\nCombining the two bounds, the VC dimension is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
