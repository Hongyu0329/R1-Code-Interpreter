    "In the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature, the partition function Z is given by:\n\nZ = ∫Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])\n\nwhere the integration is over all field configurations ϕ, and S_E[ϕ] is the Euclidean action of the field.\n\nThe Euclidean action for a free, neutral scalar field ϕ in d+1 dimensions (d spatial dimensions and one imaginary time dimension) is given by:\nS_E[ϕ] = ∫dτ d^d**x** [ 1/2 (∂_τ ϕ)^2 + 1/2 (∇ϕ)^2 + 1/2 m^2 ϕ^2 ]\n\nHere, τ is the imaginary time coordinate, which is compactified to the interval [0, β], where β = 1/T is the inverse temperature. The field ϕ is periodic in the imaginary time direction, i.e., ϕ(τ, **x**) = ϕ(τ + β, **x**).\n\nThe action can be rewritten in a more compact form by integrating the kinetic term by parts:\nS_E[ϕ] = 1/2 ∫dτ d^d**x** ϕ(-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2)ϕ\n\nThis can be expressed as an inner product. In the space of fields, the inner product of two fields, say ϕ_1 and ϕ_2, is defined as:\n(ϕ_1, ϕ_2) = ∫dτ d^d**x** ϕ_1(τ, **x**) ϕ_2(τ, **x**)\n\nUsing this definition, the Euclidean action can be written as:\nS_E[ϕ] = 1/2 (ϕ, D_ϕ ϕ)\n\nwhere D_ϕ is a differential operator. By comparing this with the expression for the action, we can identify D_ϕ as:\nD_ϕ = -∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2\n\nTherefore, the inner product of (ϕ, D_ϕ) is given by:\n\n**(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫dτ d^d**x** ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2) ϕ(τ, **x**)**\n\nIt is important to note that the term \"inner product of (ϕ, D_ϕ)\" is slightly ambiguous. The standard notation for the inner product is (ϕ, D_ϕϕ). In the context of the functional integral, the exponent is typically -1/2 (ϕ, D_ϕϕ), which represents the argument of the exponential for a Gaussian integral. Thus, the inner product of the field ϕ with the result of the operator D_ϕ acting on ϕ is the integral expression shown above. This expression is fundamental for calculating propagators and correlation functions in finite-temperature quantum field theory.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product of (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the Euclidean action for the free field. This can be expressed as:\n\n**(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d**x** [ (∂_τϕ)^2 + (∇ϕ)^2 + m^2ϕ^2 ]**\n\nAfter an integration by parts, this is equivalent to:\n\n**(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d**x** ϕ(-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2)ϕ**\n\nHere, ϕ is the neutral scalar field, D_ϕ is the operator -∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2, τ is the imaginary time compactified on a circle of circumference β = 1/T (where T is the temperature), **x** represents the spatial coordinates, and m is the mass of the scalar field."
