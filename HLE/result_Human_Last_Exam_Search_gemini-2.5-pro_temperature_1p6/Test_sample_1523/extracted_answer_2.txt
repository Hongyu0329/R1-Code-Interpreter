In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product of (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the Euclidean action for the free field. This can be expressed as:

**(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d**x** [ (∂_τϕ)^2 + (∇ϕ)^2 + m^2ϕ^2 ]**

After an integration by parts, this is equivalent to:

**(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d**x** ϕ(-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2)ϕ**

Here, ϕ is the neutral scalar field, D_ϕ is the operator -∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2, τ is the imaginary time compactified on a circle of circumference β = 1/T (where T is the temperature), **x** represents the spatial coordinates, and m is the mass of the scalar field.
