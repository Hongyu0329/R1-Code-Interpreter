    "Philosopher Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the one who decomposed the notion of a sign into, among other categories, symptoms and signals.\n\nIn his work, Ajdukiewicz made distinctions between various types of signs. According to an analysis of his 1931 writings, a state of affairs that points to another state of affairs is considered an \"indication, i.e. symptom\". In contrast, a \"signal\" is defined as an artificially created phenomenon. The recognition of a signal, combined with an understanding of a specific convention, leads to a conclusion about another event or to a particular decision. While the term \"hallmark\" is not explicitly used in this context, the fundamental differentiation between symptoms as natural indicators and signals as conventional, artificial signs is a key element of Ajdukiewicz's semiotic analysis. His broader classification of signs also included categories such as command signs and expressions.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
