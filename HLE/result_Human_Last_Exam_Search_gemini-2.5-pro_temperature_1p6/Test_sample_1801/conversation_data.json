    "The two Nobel laureates associated with the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercials are physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Paul Krugman, though their involvement differed significantly.\n\nPhysicist Murray Gell-Mann, a 1969 Nobel Prize winner in Physics, was directly featured in one of the \"Ask Why\" commercials. His appearance lent an air of intellectual credibility to the energy trading company's advertising campaign.\n\nEconomist Paul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, had a financial relationship with Enron, serving on its advisory board in 1999. For his role, he was paid $37,500. While his association with Enron has been a subject of discussion, there is no evidence to suggest that he was featured in any of the \"Ask Why\" commercials.\n\nTherefore, while both Nobel laureates had connections to Enron, only Murray Gell-Mann was visibly featured in the \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
