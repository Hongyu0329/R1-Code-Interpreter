    "To prevent the rapid degradation of p-coumaric acid in engineered *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, the **`phd` gene cluster** should be knocked out.\n\n*Corynebacterium glutamicum* is capable of utilizing phenylpropanoids, such as p-coumaric acid, as a carbon and energy source. The degradation occurs through a CoA-dependent Î²-oxidative pathway known as the Phd pathway.\n\nResearch has identified a specific gene cluster, the `phd` cluster, as essential for this degradation process. This cluster contains several genes, including `phdA`, `phdB`, `phdC`, `phdD`, and `phdE`. Studies have demonstrated that deleting genes within this cluster, such as `phdA`, `phdB`, `phdC`, or `phdE`, effectively prevents the growth of *C. glutamicum* on phenylpropanoid substrates by halting their degradation.\n\nTherefore, to ensure the accumulation of the desired p-coumaric acid product, knocking out the `phd` gene cluster is a crucial metabolic engineering step. This prevents the bacterium from consuming the p-coumaric acid it produces.\n\n<<<`phd` gene cluster>>>"
