    "While it is confirmed that Natalia Osipova, then a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, was renowned for her role as Kitri in *Don Quixote* in 2008, a precise count of the single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position in her Act I variation is not documented in the available written records.\n\nHer performances, including a notable guest appearance in Novosibirsk, Siberia in 2008, were celebrated for their \"breathtaking technique\" and \"multiple pirouettes\". Reviews and discussions from the period highlight her exceptional turning ability in general but do not offer a specific numerical breakdown of the choreography for the Act I variation.\n\nSeveral sources point to the existence of a video from the 2008 Siberian performance, though many links are no longer active, preventing a direct visual count of the specified ballet step. Without a functional video or a detailed choreographic analysis, it is not possible to provide a definitive number.\n\n<<<Unable to provide a definitive answer.>>>"
