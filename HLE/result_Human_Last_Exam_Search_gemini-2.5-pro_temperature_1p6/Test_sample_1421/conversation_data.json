    "### The Formula for the Fermionic Partition Function in Imaginary Time\n\nThe partition function, Z, for a system of interacting fermions in thermal equilibrium can be expressed using Feynman's path integral formalism in imaginary time. This formulation is a cornerstone of finite-temperature quantum field theory, providing a powerful tool for calculating thermodynamic properties. The formula is given by a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields, which are mathematical objects that properly describe the anti-commuting nature of fermions.\n\nThe partition function Z is given by:\n\n**Z = ∫ Dψ̄Dψ * exp[-S_E(ψ̄, ψ)]**\n\nThis integral is performed under the constraint of **anti-periodic boundary conditions** for the fermionic fields in the imaginary time direction:\n\n*   ψ(τ, **x**) = -ψ(τ + β, **x**)\n*   ψ̄(τ, **x**) = -ψ̄(τ + β, **x**)\n\nHere is a breakdown of the components of this formula:\n\n*   **Z**: The fermionic partition function, from which thermodynamic quantities like free energy, entropy, and particle number can be derived.\n*   **∫ Dψ̄Dψ**: This represents the functional integral, or path integral, over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields ψ(τ, **x**) and its conjugate ψ̄(τ, **x**). These are not ordinary functions but are valued in a Grassmann algebra, which means they anti-commute with each other.\n*   **τ**: This is the imaginary time, related to the real time t by τ = it. In thermal field theory, the path integral is formulated in Euclidean spacetime where the time dimension is compactified into a circle of circumference β.\n*   **β**: This is the inverse temperature, defined as β = 1/T (with the Boltzmann constant k_B set to 1). The imaginary time τ is integrated over the interval [0, β].\n*   **S_E(ψ̄, ψ)**: This is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system. It is obtained from the Minkowskian action S by a Wick rotation (t → -iτ). For a typical fermionic field theory, the Euclidean action is of the form:\n\n    S_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  L_E(ψ̄, ψ)\n\n    where L_E is the Euclidean Lagrangian density. A common form for L_E for a Dirac fermion is:\n\n    L_E = ψ̄(τ, **x**)(γ⁰∂_τ + **γ** ⋅ **∇** + m)ψ(τ, **x**) + L_int\n\n    Here, γ^μ are the gamma matrices, m is the fermion mass, and L_int contains the interaction terms. For non-relativistic fermions, the action takes a different form, often expressed as:\n\n    L_E = ψ̄(∂_τ + H)ψ\n\n    where H is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator that includes kinetic energy and potential terms.\n*   **Anti-periodic boundary conditions**: The requirement that the fermionic fields are anti-periodic in the imaginary time direction is a direct consequence of the fermionic statistics and the trace operation used to define the partition function in quantum statistical mechanics. This is a crucial distinction from bosonic fields, which obey periodic boundary conditions. The anti-periodicity leads to a discrete set of allowed frequencies for the Fourier modes of the fermion fields, known as Matsubara frequencies, which are odd integer multiples of π/β for fermions.\n\nMathematically, the integration over the Grassmann fields for a non-interacting (quadratic) action results in the determinant of the operator that appears in the action. This property is extensively used in theoretical calculations.\n\n<<<**Z = ∫ Dψ̄Dψ * exp[-S_E(ψ̄, ψ)]** with anti-periodic boundary conditions **ψ(τ, x) = -ψ(τ + β, x)** and **ψ̄(τ, x) = -ψ̄(τ + β, x)**. Here, **Z** is the partition function, the integral is a functional integral over Grassmann-valued fermion fields **ψ** and **ψ̄**, **S_E** is the Euclidean action given by the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density over imaginary time **τ ∈ [0, β]** (where β is the inverse temperature) and space, and the anti-periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the imaginary time direction.>>>"
