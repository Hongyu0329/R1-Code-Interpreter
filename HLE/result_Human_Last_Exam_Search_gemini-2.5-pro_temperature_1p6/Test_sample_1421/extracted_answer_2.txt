**Z = ∫ Dψ̄Dψ * exp[-S_E(ψ̄, ψ)]** with anti-periodic boundary conditions **ψ(τ, x) = -ψ(τ + β, x)** and **ψ̄(τ, x) = -ψ̄(τ + β, x)**. Here, **Z** is the partition function, the integral is a functional integral over Grassmann-valued fermion fields **ψ** and **ψ̄**, **S_E** is the Euclidean action given by the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density over imaginary time **τ ∈ [0, β]** (where β is the inverse temperature) and space, and the anti-periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the imaginary time direction.
