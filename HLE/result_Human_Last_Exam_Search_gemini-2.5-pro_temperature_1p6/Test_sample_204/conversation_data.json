    "The Hopf charge, also known as the Hopf invariant, of a vector field is a topological invariant that describes how the field lines are knotted and linked in three-dimensional space. It can be calculated using the Whitehead integral formula, but a more intuitive and equivalent method is to determine the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points on the target unit sphere. The given vector field is a normalized field, meaning it maps every point in 3D space to a point on the surface of a unit sphere S².\n\nThe vector field is defined as:\n*   `f = atan2(y,x)`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)² + z*z)`\n*   `G = PI * exp(-10*r2)`\n*   `(nx, ny, nz) = (sin(G)*cos(f), sin(G)*sin(f), cos(G))`\n\nTo find the Hopf charge, we can identify the preimages of two different points on the unit sphere and calculate their linking number. Let's choose the \"south pole\" `(0, 0, -1)` and a point on the \"equator,\" `(1, 0, 0)`.\n\n1.  **Preimage of the South Pole:** The vector field points to the south pole when `(nx, ny, nz) = (0, 0, -1)`. This occurs when `cos(G) = -1`, which implies `G = π`. According to the definition of `G`, this means `exp(-10*r2) = 1`, and therefore `r2 = 0`. The condition `r2 = 0` corresponds to the set of points where `(x² + y² - 0.5)² + z² = 0`. This is only true if `z = 0` and `x² + y² = 0.5`. This preimage is a circle in the xy-plane with a radius of `sqrt(0.5)` centered at the origin.\n\n2.  **Preimage of the Equatorial Point:** The vector field points to `(1, 0, 0)` when `nz = cos(G) = 0`, `nx = sin(G)*cos(f) = 1`, and `ny = sin(G)*sin(f) = 0`.\n    *   `cos(G) = 0` implies `G = π/2`. This means `π * exp(-10*r2) = π/2`, which simplifies to `exp(-10*r2) = 0.5`. Taking the natural logarithm gives `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n    *   `sin(G) = sin(π/2) = 1`.\n    *   `cos(f) = 1` and `sin(f) = 0` implies `f = 0`. From the definition `f = atan2(y,x)`, this means `y=0` and `x > 0`.\n    *   Substituting these into the equation for `r2`, we get `(x² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²`. This describes a circle in the xz-plane (since `y=0`) centered at `(x=sqrt(0.5), z=0)` with a small radius of `ln(2)/10`.\n\nThe two preimages are two circles: one in the xy-plane centered at the origin, and the other in the xz-plane centered on the first circle. These two circles are linked together exactly once. For a single hopfion, the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points is 1. This linking number is, by definition, the Hopf charge. The described field is a classic example of a single hopfion, which has a Hopf charge of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
