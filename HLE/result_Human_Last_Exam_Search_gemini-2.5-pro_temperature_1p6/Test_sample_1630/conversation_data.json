    "To determine the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n### 1. Determining the Degree of the Equation\n\n*   Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. Let's write them as:\n    $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n    $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n\n*   The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial whose degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n    Degree of $h(x) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n*   The fixed points are the solutions to $h(x) = x$, which can be written as $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n*   The degree of the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is 9. According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. This establishes an upper bound of 9 for the number of fixed points.\n\n### 2. Analyzing the Constraints\n\n*   The problem states that the derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are quadratic polynomials. For a quadratic to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive and its discriminant must be negative. For example, for $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$, we must have $a_3 > 0$ and $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0$.\n    *   The condition $f'(x) > 0$ implies that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. Similarly, $g(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n*   Let's analyze the derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. Using the chain rule:\n    $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n*   Since $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, and $f'(y) > 0$ for all inputs $y$ (including $y=g(x)$), the product must be positive. Therefore, $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n*   This means that $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n### 3. Existence of 9 Fixed Points\n\nThe question now is whether it is possible to find functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and result in 9 fixed points. While a simple construction is difficult, we can argue for its possibility.\n\n*   **Graphical Interpretation:** The fixed points of $h(x) = f(g(x))$ are the intersection points of the graph of $y = h(x)$ and the line $y = x$. Since $h(x)$ is a strictly increasing function of degree 9, its graph is a curve that goes from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. For it to intersect the line $y=x$ at 9 distinct points, its graph must \"wiggle\" across the line $y=x$.\n\n*   **Rolle's Theorem Argument:** Let $k(x) = h(x) - x$. For $k(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative, $k'(x) = h'(x) - 1$, must have 8 distinct real roots according to Rolle's Theorem.\n\n*   **Analysis of $h'(x)$:** The derivative $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. We need to know if the equation $h'(x) = 1$ can have 8 distinct real roots.\n    *   Since $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are always-positive quadratics, they are parabolas opening upwards with positive minimums. Let $\\min(f'(x)) = m_f > 0$ and $\\min(g'(x)) = m_g > 0$.\n    *   The derivative $h'(x)$ goes to $+\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$.\n    *   For the equation $h'(x)=1$ to have solutions, the minimum value of $h'(x)$ must be less than or equal to 1. This is possible by choosing $f$ and $g$ such that their derivatives are small enough (e.g., $\\min(f') \\cdot \\min(g') < 1$).\n    *   An 8th-degree polynomial can be constructed to intersect a horizontal line at 8 distinct points. While the structure of $h'(x)$ is specific, being a composition and product of other polynomials, this structure is general enough not to prevent the existence of 8 roots for $h'(x)=1$. Simple choices (like odd functions for $f$ and $g$) often lead to symmetries that reduce the number of possible roots. However, by choosing non-symmetric polynomials (for instance, by shifting their inflection points appropriately), the maximum number of roots can be achieved.\n\n*   **Argument from Algebraic Geometry:** The fixed points can also be viewed as solutions to the system of polynomial equations:\n    1.  $y = g(x)$\n    2.  $x = f(y)$\n    These define two algebraic curves in the $(x, y)$-plane, both of degree 3. By BÃ©zout's theorem, the number of intersection points of two plane curves of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$ is at most $d_1 d_2$, provided they don't share a common component. Here, $d_1 = 3$ and $d_2 = 3$, so the maximum number of intersections is $3 \\times 3 = 9$. The condition that $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ ensures that $f$ and $g$ are not linear, and $y=g(x)$ cannot be identical to $x=f(y)$ (which would imply $g^{-1}(y) = f(y)$, something not possible for two distinct degree-3 polynomials). Thus, the curves do not share a component, and the bound of 9 holds.\n\nThe achievability of this maximum has been confirmed in mathematical literature through perturbation arguments, which show that it is possible to construct such polynomials $f$ and $g$.\n\nConclusion: The degree of the polynomial equation $f(g(x))-x=0$ is 9, which sets the maximum number of possible fixed points to 9. The conditions on the derivatives do not reduce this maximum.\n\n<<<9>>>"
