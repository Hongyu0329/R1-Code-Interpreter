    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n1.  **Reactants and Reaction Type:** The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide, and it is treated with potassium tert-butoxide, which is a strong, sterically bulky base. This combination strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry and Conformation:** The stereochemistry of the starting material is (1S,2R), which indicates a *trans* relationship between the bromine and methyl groups. In a cyclohexane ring, 1,2-trans substituents are most stable when they are both in equatorial positions.\n\n3.  **E2 Reaction Requirements:** The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (bromide) and the proton being abstracted must be in an anti-periplanar (or trans-diaxial) arrangement. For this to occur in a cyclohexane ring, both the leaving group and the hydrogen must be in axial positions.\n\n4.  **Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   For the reaction to proceed, the stable diequatorial conformation of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane must first undergo a ring-flip to the less stable diaxial conformation. In this conformation, the bromine atom on carbon 1 and the methyl group on carbon 2 are both in axial positions.\n    *   The base, potassium tert-butoxide, then abstracts a beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the one with the leaving group).\n    *   There are two beta-carbons to consider: C2 and C6.\n    *   On C2, the methyl group is in the axial position, meaning the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial position. It is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, elimination cannot occur towards C2 to form 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   On C6, there is an axial hydrogen which *is* anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n    *   The bulky base abstracts this sterically accessible axial hydrogen from C6, a double bond forms between C1 and C6, and the bromide ion leaves.\n\n5.  **Product Identification:** The formation of the double bond between C1 and C6 results in the product 3-methylcyclohexene. This is also known as the Hofmann product, which is the less substituted alkene. In this specific case, the formation of the Hofmann product is dictated by the stereochemistry of the starting material, which prevents the formation of the more substituted Zaitsev product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
