    "In two separate patches of surface code, each with two \"closed\" holes, a maximum of four logical qubits can be encoded.\n\nThe number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a single patch of surface code is determined by the number of holes, or defects, introduced into the lattice structure. For a surface with 'h' closed holes, it is possible to encode 'h' logical qubits. In this case, each patch contains two holes, which allows for the encoding of two logical qubits per patch. Since there are two independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each, resulting in a total of four.\n\nIt is important to note that a standard, hole-free planar surface code can only encode a single logical qubit. Introducing holes is a method to increase the number of encoded qubits on a single patch, although this can affect the code's distance and error rate. Operations between logical qubits can be performed through techniques like \"lattice surgery,\" which involves merging and splitting these patches."
