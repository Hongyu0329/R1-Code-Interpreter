    "The second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient, denoted as `a_2`, in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless Dirac spinor field coupled to a gauge field in four dimensions is given by:\n\n`a_2(x) = (1/(4\\pi)^2) * tr(-1/6 * R * I + 1/2 * \\Omega_{\\mu\\nu}\\Omega^{\\mu\\nu})`\n\nwhere:\n*   `R` is the scalar curvature.\n*   `I` is the identity matrix in the spinor space.\n*   `\\Omega_{\\mu\\nu}` is the curvature of the connection on the spinor bundle, which includes the gauge field strength. For a Dirac spinor coupled to a gauge field `A_\\mu` with field strength `F_{\\mu\\nu}`, the total curvature is `\\Omega_{\\mu\\nu} = 1/4 * [\\gamma^\\rho, \\gamma^\\sigma] R_{\\rho\\sigma\\mu\\nu} + F_{\\mu\\nu}`. However, for the purpose of the standard `a_2` coefficient trace, the relevant part of the curvature is the gauge field strength `F_{\\mu\\nu}`.\n\nMore explicitly, for a massless Dirac spinor field with `N` components coupled to a gauge field `F_{\\mu\\nu}`, the trace is taken over the spin and gauge indices. The resulting expression for the second coefficient integrated over the manifold is:\n\n`\\int d^4x \\sqrt{g} \\text{tr}\\left( - \\frac{N}{6} R + \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} \\right)`\n\nThe term we are looking for is the local coefficient before integration. For a single Dirac spinor (N=4 in 4 dimensions), the expression inside the trace becomes:\n\n`a_2(x) = C \\cdot \\text{tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})`\n\nWhere C is a numerical constant. Based on the literature, the expression for the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a_2` for a Dirac field coupled to a gauge field `A_\\mu` is proportional to the square of the field strength `F_{\\mu\\nu}`.\n\nThe coefficient is found to be proportional to `tr(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})`, where the trace is over the gauge group generators.\n\nThe specific form is:\n\n<<<`-(1/12) * tr(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})`>>>"
