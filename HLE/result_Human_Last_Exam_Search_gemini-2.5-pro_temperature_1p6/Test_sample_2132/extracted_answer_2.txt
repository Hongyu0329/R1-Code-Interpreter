The Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone depends on the base used. For cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, the SMILES is OC(=O)C1CCCC1. For methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, the SMILES is COC(=O)C1CCCC1. For ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, the SMILES is CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1. These SMILES strings can be used in a Böttcher score calculator to obtain the specific complexity values.
