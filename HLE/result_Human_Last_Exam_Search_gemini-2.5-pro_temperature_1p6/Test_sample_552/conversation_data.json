    "In his groundbreaking 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein did not cite the lectures of any other scientists.\n\nScholarly analyses of this pivotal work, along with Einstein's own accounts, indicate that the paper was conceived without direct reliance on the prior experimental observations of the phenomenon. In fact, Einstein later stated that he was unaware of the long-standing observations of Brownian motion at the time of his publication.\n\nWhile Einstein's earlier readings included the works of prominent physicists like Ludwig Boltzmann, and his thinking was undoubtedly shaped by the scientific discourse of his time, his 1905 paper on Brownian motion is notable for its lack of formal citations to the works of others. An English translation of the paper includes an introductory note where Einstein mentions his own previous papers on the foundations of thermodynamics. However, there are no references to external lectures or publications by other scientists within the body of the paper. This was not unusual for Einstein's papers of this period, which were often presented as logical deductions from fundamental principles.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein did not cite anyone else's lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
