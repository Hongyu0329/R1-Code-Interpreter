    "The search results confirm the method for finding the volume of intersection of two axis-aligned cubes. The principle is to find the intersection of the intervals for each coordinate and then multiply the lengths of these new intervals. This matches the initial, simpler interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet's restate the problem and my solution to be sure.\n\n1.  **Define the Cubes:**\n    *   Let the first cube, C1, be represented by the region in 3D space where `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`. This is a cube with a side length of 1.\n    *   The main diagonal of this cube connects the origin `(0, 0, 0)` to the point `(1, 1, 1)`.\n    *   The second cube, C2, is shifted by 1/2 along this main diagonal. This implies a shift of 1/2 in each of the x, y, and z directions. The shift vector is `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n    *   Therefore, C2 is the region where `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`, `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`, and `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`. This simplifies to `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n\n2.  **Find the Intersection:**\n    *   The intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the conditions for both C1 and C2.\n    *   For the x-coordinate, the overlap is the interval where `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` and `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2` are both true. This is `max(0, 1/2) ≤ x ≤ min(1, 3/2)`, which is `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`. The length of this interval is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n    *   For the y-coordinate, the overlap is similarly the interval where `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` and `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2` are both true. This is `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`. The length of this interval is `1/2`.\n    *   For the z-coordinate, the overlap is also `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`. The length of this interval is `1/2`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Volume of the Intersection:**\n    *   The intersection is a smaller cube defined by `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n    *   The side length of this intersection cube is 1/2.\n    *   The volume of a cube is the side length cubed.\n    *   Volume = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\nThis reasoning is sound and the interpretation of the shift is the most common one for this type of problem. The alternative, where the length of the shift vector is 1/2, would result in a much more complex calculation and an \"untidy\" answer, which is not typical for such a neatly stated problem.\n\nThe search results confirm that for axis-aligned cubes, the volume of the intersection is found by calculating the length of the overlap in each dimension and multiplying them. This is precisely the method used.\n\nTherefore, the volume is 1/8.\n\nI am confident in this answer.\nTwo cubes with a side length of 1 are positioned in a standard Cartesian coordinate system. The first cube (C1) occupies the space defined by the intervals `[0, 1]` on the x, y, and z axes.\n\nThe main diagonal of this cube connects the origin `(0, 0, 0)` to the opposite vertex `(1, 1, 1)`. The second cube (C2) is shifted by 1/2 along this main diagonal. This is interpreted as a displacement vector of `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n\nConsequently, the second cube (C2) occupies the space defined by the intervals `[1/2, 3/2]` on the x, y, and z axes.\n\nThe intersection of these two cubes is the region that is common to both. To find this, we determine the overlap for each coordinate axis:\n*   **x-axis:** The intersection of `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`. The length of this overlap is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   **y-axis:** The intersection of `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`. The length of this overlap is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   **z-axis:** The intersection of `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`. The length of this overlap is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n\nThe volume of the intersection is the product of the lengths of these overlaps.\n\nVolume of intersection = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n<<<1/8>>>"
