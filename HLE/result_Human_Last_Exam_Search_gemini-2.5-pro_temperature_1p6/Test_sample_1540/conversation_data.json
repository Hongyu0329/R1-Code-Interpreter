    "To solve this competitive programming problem with the utmost memory efficiency in C, the strategy is to avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously. Since the input strings are provided on separate lines, the first string must be fully read from the input stream before the second string can be accessed. Therefore, the most memory-efficient approach involves buffering the first string and then reading the second string one character at a time for comparison.\n\nThis method avoids allocating a buffer for the second string, significantly reducing memory usage. To further optimize, the smallest possible data types for variables like loop counters should be used.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program for this task:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/**\n * This program solves the \"Petya and Strings\" problem by comparing two strings\n * lexicographically while ignoring case. It is optimized for memory efficiency.\n *\n * The core idea is to read the first string into a buffer, and then read the\n * second string one character at a time. This avoids allocating memory for the\n * second string.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    // A buffer is required for the first string since the second string\n    // can only be read after the first.\n    // The maximum length is 100, plus one for the null terminator.\n    // sizeof(char) is 1 byte, so s1 uses 101 bytes.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // A single char to hold characters of the second string as they are read.\n    // This uses 1 byte.\n    char c2;\n\n    // An index for iterating over s1. The max length is 100, so a char\n    // (1 byte, capable of storing values from -128 to 127 or 0 to 255)\n    // is sufficient instead of a larger `int`. This uses 1 byte.\n    char i = 0;\n\n    // Read the first string. scanf reads up to the first whitespace (the newline)\n    // and leaves the newline in the input buffer.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Consume the newline character left in the input buffer by scanf.\n    // This call itself does not allocate variable memory.\n    getchar();\n\n    // Read the second string character by character until a newline or EOF.\n    // The fread function is used here as it can read a single byte directly\n    // into a char variable, avoiding the `int` type required by getchar().\n    while (fread(&c2, sizeof(char), 1, stdin) == 1) {\n        // Stop at the newline character, which marks the end of the second string.\n        if (c2 == '\\n') {\n            break;\n        }\n\n        // Compare characters case-insensitively.\n        char lower_s1 = tolower(s1[i]);\n        char lower_c2 = tolower(c2);\n\n        if (lower_s1 < lower_c2) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // First string is smaller.\n        }\n        if (lower_s1 > lower_c2) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // First string is larger.\n        }\n\n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop finishes, the strings are lexicographically equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory used by the variables in this program is calculated as follows:\n*   **`char s1[101]`**: A buffer to store the first input string. Its size must accommodate the maximum string length of 100 characters plus one byte for the null terminator, totaling **101 bytes**.\n*   **`char c2`**: A variable to hold each character of the second string as it is being read. This requires **1 byte**.\n*   **`char i`**: An index for iterating through the `s1` buffer. Since the maximum string length is 100, a single-byte `char` is sufficient to hold the index value, using **1 byte**.\n\nTherefore, the total memory `m` used for variables is the sum of the memory used by `s1`, `c2`, and `i`.\n\nm = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 1 byte\n\n<<<103>>>"
