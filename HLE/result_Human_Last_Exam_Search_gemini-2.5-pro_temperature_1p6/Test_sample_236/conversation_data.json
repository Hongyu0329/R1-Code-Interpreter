    "### Infinitely Many Elements of the Homology Cobordism Group Can Be Represented by Surgery on Knots with at Most Four Crossings\n\nAn infinite number of elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings. This is because integral surgeries on the unknot alone can produce infinitely many distinct elements in this group.\n\nThe knots with at most four crossings are the unknot (0 crossings), the trefoil knot (3 crossings), and the figure-eight knot (4 crossings).\n\nAn integral surgery on a knot is a procedure that creates a 3-dimensional manifold. The type of manifold created depends on both the knot and an integer chosen for the surgery. The set of all such 3-manifolds, when grouped by a specific equivalence relation called homology cobordism, forms the homology cobordism group.\n\nHere's a breakdown for each knot:\n\n*   **The Unknot (0₁):** An integral surgery on the unknot produces a lens space, denoted L(p,q). Specifically, an n-framed surgery on the unknot results in the lens space L(n, 1). Many of these lens spaces, which are distinguished by invariants such as the Rohlin invariant and d-invariants, represent an infinite number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot (3₁):** Integral surgeries on the trefoil knot also produce a variety of 3-manifolds. For example, a +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot results in the Poincaré homology sphere. This homology sphere and others derived from the trefoil knot contribute additional elements to the homology cobordism group, some of which are known to have infinite order.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** Similarly, integral surgeries on the figure-eight knot generate various 3-manifolds. The figure-eight knot is known to be \"rationally slice,\" and its surgeries lead to interesting examples in homology cobordism, including elements of order two in the concordance group.\n\nSince surgeries on the unknot alone generate an infinite set of distinct homology cobordism classes, and the trefoil and figure-eight knots contribute even more, the total number of representable elements is infinite.\n\n<<<infinitely many>>>"
