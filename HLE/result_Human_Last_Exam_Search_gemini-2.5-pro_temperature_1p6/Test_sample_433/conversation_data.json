    "For a single-dose container ampule, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) from the time of puncture in a sterile environment is immediate use. Once an ampule is opened, it is considered an open system and cannot be stored for any period. Any remaining contents must be discarded and not be stored for any time period.\n\nAccording to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797>, opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any length of time and must be used immediately regardless of the air quality where they are opened. This is because ampules are designed to be broken open and cannot be hermetically sealed again, which makes them susceptible to contamination.\n\nWhile single-dose *vials* that are punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial entry, this does not apply to ampules. If a single-dose vial is opened in an environment with air quality worse than ISO Class 5, it must be used within one hour. However, for ampules, the guidance is consistently for immediate use only.\n\n<<<immediate use>>>"
