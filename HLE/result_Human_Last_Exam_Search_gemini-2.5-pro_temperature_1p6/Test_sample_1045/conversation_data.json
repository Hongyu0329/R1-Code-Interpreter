    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n**1. Composition of Toluene:**\n*   Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it consists of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Contracted Functions for Each Atom in the 6-31G Basis Set:**\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence double-zeta basis set.\n    *   The core (1s) orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function (composed of 6 primitive Gaussians).\n    *   The valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals) is split into two sets of functions. Each set consists of one s-function and three p-functions (px, py, pz). This results in 2 * (1s + 3p) = 8 valence functions.\n    *   Therefore, each carbon atom uses 1 (core) + 8 (valence) = 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   The 1s orbital is split into two basis functions (a double-zeta representation). One is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians and the other is a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Thus, each hydrogen atom is described by 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n**3. Total Calculation:**\n\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total contracted Gaussian functions:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\n<<<79>>>"
