    "In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova performed **seven** sissonne fermés in the Act II Odette variation.\n\nThis count is based on analysis of the widely available 2015 recording of the Bolshoi Ballet's performance, which features the same cast and choreography. The variation, a key solo for the character of Odette, showcases the ballerina's technical skill and artistry. The sissonne fermée is a jump from two feet to one, closing the other foot afterwards. In this specific variation, Zakharova executes a series of these jumps. The performance is accessible through various online platforms and has been officially released on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\n<<<7>>>"
