    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is **December 8, 36 BC**. This date is inscribed on Stela 2, a stone monument discovered at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico.\n\nThe date on Stela 2 is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, a sophisticated system that could pinpoint a specific day over a vast period. The inscription on the stela reads 7.16.3.2.13, which correlates to December 8, 36 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This makes it the earliest of the three known \"cycle-seven\" monuments, pre-dating other early dated artifacts.\n\nFor a time, the earliest known Long Count date was thought to be from Tres Zapotes Stela C, which has an inscription corresponding to September 3, 32 BC. However, the discovery and decipherment of Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo pushed the date of the earliest recorded year back by four years.\n\nOther earlier examples of writing and calendrical notations exist, but they do not represent a full, fixed date. For instance, Monument 3 at San Jos√© Mogote in Oaxaca displays a glyph for \"1 Earthquake,\" which is a day within the 260-day sacred calendar. While this inscription is significantly older, with an estimated carving date of around 600 BC, it does not specify a year and is therefore not considered a complete date in the same way as the Long Count inscriptions.\n\n<<<December 8, 36 BC>>>"
