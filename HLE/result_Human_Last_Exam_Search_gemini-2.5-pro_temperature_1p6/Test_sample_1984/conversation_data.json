    "To find the number of stable equilibria, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the differential equation\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t).\n$$\nEquilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We set $f(x) = 0$:\n$$\n-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n$$\nFactoring out $-x$, we get:\n$$\n-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe expression in the parentheses is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$\n-x(x-1)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe equilibrium points are the solutions to this equation, which are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. We can use the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at the equilibrium points. The derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1\n$$\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n1.  For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\n2.  For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ around $x=1$.\n    The function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n    *   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. So, $f(x) = -(\\text{positive})(\\text{positive})$ which is negative. This means that for $x < 1$, $x(t)$ is decreasing and moving away from 1.\n    *   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. So, $f(x) = -(\\text{positive})(\\text{positive})$ which is negative. This means that for $x > 1$, $x(t)$ is decreasing and moving towards 1.\n    Since solutions starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point is not stable. It is a semi-stable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium, which is $x=0$. The number of stable equilibria is $m=1$.\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$. Substituting $m=1$, we get:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
