    "The user wants to find the next number in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n\nI have already tried to find a pattern by looking at the differences between terms, but that did not reveal a simple arithmetic progression.\n\nLet's re-examine multiplicative patterns based on the search results.\nThe search results show several types of patterns for number sequences.\n- A common pattern is `y = a*x + b`. Result suggests a pattern of `x*3 + 5` for a similar sequence, but that does not fit the current sequence (2*3 + 5 = 11, but 11*3 + 5 = 38, not 23).\n- Another common pattern involves powers.\n- Result analyzes the sequence 2, 5, 11, 23, 47. The pattern there is `y = 2*x + 1`, or the differences between terms double (3, 6, 12, 24).\n\nLet's try the `y = 2*x + k` pattern again for the given sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n\n*   From 2 to 11: 11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n*   From 11 to 23: 23 = 2 * 11 + 1\n*   From 23 to 51: 51 = 2 * 23 + 5\n*   From 51 to 119: 119 = 2 * 51 + 17\n\nThe sequence of the added number `k` is 7, 1, 5, 17. This doesn't seem to have a clear pattern.\n\nLet's try a different multiplicative approach, maybe `y = a*x - b`.\n\n*   From 2 to 11: 11 = 2 * 5 + 1. Or maybe 11 = 2 * 6 - 1. Or 11 = 2 * 4 + 3.\n*   From 11 to 23: 23 = 11 * 2 + 1\n*   From 23 to 51: 51 = 23 * 2 + 5\n*   From 51 to 119: 119 = 51 * 2 + 17\n\nLet's try another variation.\n*   2 * 2 + 7 = 11\n*   2 * 5 + 1 = 11? No.\n\nLet's look at the numbers again: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119\nLet's analyze the pattern `x_n = 2 * x_(n-1) + k` and `x_n = 3 * x_(n-1) - k`.\n\nPattern: `y = 2x + k`\nx1 = 2\nx2 = 11 = 2*2 + 7\nx3 = 23 = 2*11 + 1\nx4 = 51 = 2*23 + 5\nx5 = 119 = 2*51 + 17\n\nPattern: `y = 3x - k`\nx1 = 2\nx2 = 11 = 3*2 + 5\nx3 = 23 = 3*11 - 10\nx4 = 51 = 3*23 - 18\nx5 = 119 = 3*51 - 34\n\nThe second pattern looks more promising. Let's look at the subtracted numbers: 10, 18, 34.\nThe differences are:\n18 - 10 = 8\n34 - 18 = 16\nThe differences are doubling (8, 16). The next difference should be 32.\nSo, the next number to be subtracted would be 34 + 32 = 66.\nAnd the first number added was 5. How does that fit in? Let's work backward.\nThe differences are 8, 16, 32... The one before 8 would be 4. So the number before 10 would be 10 - 4 = 6. So `k` would be 6, not -5. So this pattern isn't quite right.\n\nLet's rethink. `y = 3x - k`\nx2 = 3 * 2 + 5 = 11. (This is plus 5)\nx3 = 3 * 11 - 10 = 23.\nThis isn't a consistent pattern.\n\nLet's go back to `y = 2x + k`.\n2, 11, 23, 51, 119\n*   11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n*   23 = 2 * 11 + 1\n*   51 = 2 * 23 + 5\n*   119 = 2 * 51 + 17\n*   Next number = 2 * 119 + k\nWhat is k? The sequence of k is 7, 1, 5, 17. No obvious pattern.\n\nLet's reconsider the differences.\n9, 12, 28, 68.\nLet's check the online sequence solver again for this specific sequence.\nI am searching again to see if a specific pattern explanation exists.\nThe user wants to find the next number in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n\nBased on my analysis and search results, let's re-examine the potential patterns.\n\n1.  **Arithmetic Progression:**\n    *   Differences: 11-2=9, 23-11=12, 51-23=28, 119-51=68.\n    *   Differences of differences: 12-9=3, 28-12=16, 68-28=40. This doesn't reveal a simple pattern.\n\n2.  **Geometric or Mixed Progression:** A common pattern is `y = ax +/- b`. Let's test a few possibilities.\n\n    *   **Hypothesis 1: `y = 2x + k`**\n        *   2 * 2 + 7 = 11\n        *   11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n        *   23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n        *   51 * 2 + 17 = 119\n        The added numbers are 7, 1, 5, 17. No obvious pattern here.\n\n    *   **Hypothesis 2: `y = 3x - k`**\n        *   3 * 2 + 5 = 11\n        *   3 * 11 - 10 = 23\n        The operation changes from addition to subtraction, so this is unlikely.\n\n    *   **Hypothesis 3: Relating to powers.** A result for a similar sequence (2, 9, 23, 51, ...) suggests a pattern of `a(n+1) = 2*a(n) + k`. Let's reconsider this. Another result for (2, 5, 11, 23, 47) shows the differences doubling (3, 6, 12, 24). This implies a pattern of `y = 2x + 1`. This isn't our exact sequence, but the structure is common.\n\nLet's try one more pattern, combining the previous term with the one before it.\nx_n = 2 * x_(n-1) + x_(n-2)?\nx3 = 2 * 11 + 2 = 24 (Close to 23)\nx4 = 2 * 23 + 11 = 57 (Not 51)\n\nLet's try to find a consistent multiplicative and additive/subtractive pattern again.\n2 * 5 + 1 = 11\n11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n\nThis does not work. Let's try multiplication by a number close to 2.\nx_n â‰ˆ 2 * x_(n-1)\n\n2 * 2 = 4 -> 11 (diff 7)\n2 * 11 = 22 -> 23 (diff 1)\n2 * 23 = 46 -> 51 (diff 5)\n2 * 51 = 102 -> 119 (diff 17)\n\nLet's reconsider the first pattern `x(n+1) = 3*x(n) - k`.\n*   2 * 3 + 5 = 11.\n*   11 * 3 - 10 = 23.\n*   23 * 3 - 18 = 51.\n*   51 * 3 - 34 = 119.\nLet's look at the numbers being added/subtracted: +5, -10, -18, -34. This is not consistent.\n\nThere might be an error in my transcription or a more obscure pattern. Let's try one more time with `y = ax + b`.\n\nWhat if the multiplier and the added number are related?\nLet's go back to the most common pattern for these types of problems: `y = 2x + k`.\n2, 11, 23, 51, 119\n*   11 = 2*2 + 7\n*   23 = 2*11 + 1\n*   51 = 2*23 + 5\n*   119 = 2*51 + 17\n*   ? = 2*119 + k = 238 + k\n\nWhat is the pattern of `k`: 7, 1, 5, 17? This is still not obvious.\n\nLet's try `y = x_n + x_(n-1) * k`\n11 = 2 + (previous term?) No.\n\nLet's try a completely different approach.\nPrime numbers are sometimes involved. 2, 11, 23, 51(not prime), 119(not prime). So not related to primes.\n\nLet's retry the differences, but maybe look at it differently.\nDifferences: 9, 12, 28, 68\nLet's express these in another way.\n9 = 3*3\n12 = 3*4\n28 = 4*7\n68 = 4*17\nNo clear pattern.\n\nLet's revisit the search results. Sometimes a similar-looking problem can provide the key.\nThe sequence 2, 9, 23, 51, 107 has a pattern where the differences are 7, 14, 28, 56 (doubling).\nOur differences are 9, 12, 28, 68.\n\nLet's try a different multiplication. What about `y = 2.5 * x`?\n2 * 2.5 + 6 = 11\n11 * 2.5 - 4.5 = 23\nThis seems too complex.\n\nLet's assume there is a typo in the question and it should be `2, 5, 11, 23, 47`, for which the pattern is `y = 2x + 1`, and the next number is 95.\nOr let's assume it should be `2, 9, 23, 51, 107`, for which the pattern is `y=2x+5` or the differences double. The next number would be 107 + (56*2) = 219.\n\nHowever, I must solve the sequence as given: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n\nLet's look at the difference again: 9, 12, 28, 68\nThere is a pattern here that I missed.\nLet's add 4 to each number.\n6, 15, 27, 55, 123. No.\nLet's subtract 3 from each number.\n-1, 8, 20, 48, 116. No.\nLet's add 3 to each number.\n5, 14, 26, 54, 122.\nDifferences: 9, 12, 28, 68\nCan we relate these differences to the original numbers?\n9 is close to 11. 12 is half of 23. No.\n\nLet's try a different operation: `(x_n * 2) + x_(n-1)`\n(11 * 2) + 2 = 24 (close to 23)\n(23 * 2) + 11 = 57 (not 51)\n\nLet's try `x_n + x_(n-1) * 2`\n23 + (11 * 2) = 45 (not 51)\n\nThere must be a consistent, but possibly complex, rule. Let's go back to my first attempt and check my math.\nLet's reconsider the pattern `y = 3x - k`\nx2 = 3*x1 - k1 => 11 = 3*2 - (-5) = 6+5. k1 = -5\nx3 = 3*x2 - k2 => 23 = 3*11 - 10. k2 = 10\nx4 = 3*x3 - k3 => 51 = 3*23 - 18 = 69 - 18. k3 = 18\nx5 = 3*x4 - k4 => 119 = 3*51 - 34 = 153 - 34. k4 = 34\n\nThe subtracted sequence is: -5, 10, 18, 34. This is not a simple pattern.\n\nLet's go back to `y = 2x + k`\nk sequence: 7, 1, 5, 17. Also not a simple pattern.\n\nThere must be an error in my analysis or the question. Let me reconsider the differences of the differences.\nTerms: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119\n1st differences: 9, 12, 28, 68\n2nd differences: 3, 16, 40\nLet's see the ratio: 16/3 = 5.33, 40/16 = 2.5. Not a geometric progression.\nLet's see the differences: 16-3 = 13, 40-16 = 24.\nLet's see the differences of these: 24-13 = 11.\n\nLet's try to extend this pattern.\n3rd differences: 13, 24\n4th differences: 11\nAssuming the 4th difference is constant (11).\nThe next 3rd difference would be 24 + 11 = 35.\nThe next 2nd difference would be 40 + 35 = 75.\nThe next 1st difference would be 68 + 75 = 143.\nThe next term in the sequence would be 119 + 143 = 262. This is not among the options.\n\nLet's re-examine `y=2x + k`, where `k` is 7, 1, 5, 17.\nThis sequence `k` could be `(previous k) * a + b`.\n1 = 7a + b\n5 = 1a + b => b = 5-a\n1 = 7a + 5 - a = 6a + 5 => 6a = -4 => a = -2/3. Does not seem likely.\n\nLet's try `y = ax + b` again, but `a` and `b` change.\n2 * 2 + 7 = 11\n11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n51 * 2 + 17 = 119\n\nLet's consider `x_(n) = 2*x_(n-1) + x_(n-2) - 10`\nx3 = 2*11 + 2 - 10 = 14 (not 23)\n\nLet's rethink from the ground up.\n2, 11, 23, 51, 119\n\nWhat if it is related to x^2 or x^3?\n1^3+1 = 2\n2^3+3 = 11\n3^3-4 = 23\n4^3-13 = 51\n5^3-6 = 119\nThe second term in the operation is 1, 3, -4, -13, -6. No obvious pattern.\n\nLet's analyze the given options.\nA. 291\nB. 285\nC. 171\nD. 167\n\nIf the answer is 291, then the last difference is 291-119 = 172.\nThe differences would be: 9, 12, 28, 68, 172. No obvious pattern.\n\nIf the answer is 285, then the last difference is 285-119 = 166.\nThe differences would be: 9, 12, 28, 68, 166. No obvious pattern.\n\nOkay, let me try the `3x-k` pattern again, I may have made a mistake.\nx_1 = 2\nx_2 = 11 = 3*2 + 5\nx_3 = 23 = 3*11 - 10\nx_4 = 51 = 3*23 - 18\nx_5 = 119 = 3*51 - 34\n\nThe subtracted terms (let's call it `d`) are -5, 10, 18, 34.\nLet's find the difference of `d`.\n10 - (-5) = 15. Wait, 3*2 + 5. The rule must be consistent. So this isn't it.\n\nWhat if the rule is `2 * (previous term) + something`?\n11 = 2*2 + 7\n23 = 2*11 + 1\nWhat if the rule is `2 * previous + previous-previous`\n23 != 2*11 + 2 = 24\n51 != 2*23 + 11 = 57\n\nThere is one pattern that seems plausible if there is a slight modification.\nLet's try: `y = 2x - 3`, then `y=2x+1`, then `y=2x+5`. No.\n\nLet's analyze `x_n = 2*x_(n-1) + 3^(n-2)`. (n starts at 2)\nn=2: x_2 = 2*x_1 + 3^0 = 2*2 + 1 = 5 (Incorrect)\n\nLet's try `x_n = 2*x_(n-1) + a_(n-1)`\na_1 = 7\na_2 = 1\na_3 = 5\na_4 = 17\n\nIs there a pattern in 7, 1, 5, 17? Not an obvious one.\n\nLet me try a completely different approach.\nDouble the number and add/subtract a prime number.\n2*2 + 7 = 11 (7 is prime)\n2*11 + 1 (1 is not prime). So not this.\n\nLet's search for \"sequence 2 11 23 51\". Maybe leaving the last term out helps.\nThe pattern could be `x_n = 3*x_{n-1} - k`. Let's assume it starts from the second term.\n23 = 3 * 11 - 10\n51 = 3 * 23 - 18 (69-18=51)\n119 = 3 * 51 - 34 (153-34=119)\nHere, the subtracted numbers are 10, 18, 34.\nThe differences are 8, 16. It's a geometric progression. The next difference should be 32.\nThe next number to subtract would be 34 + 32 = 66.\nThe next term in the sequence would be:\nx_6 = 3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291.\nThis works. The only inconsistency is the first term, which is a common feature in such problems where the pattern establishes from the second or third term.\nHow to get from 2 to 11? `3 * 2 + 5 = 11`. It is an outlier to the pattern `3x-k`. But the rest of the sequence is perfectly explained by this pattern where the subtracted term's difference doubles each time.\n\nLet's verify.\nPattern: `x_n = 3 * x_(n-1) - d_n` for n >= 3\nd_n = 10, 18, 34, ...\nThe difference between these d_n are: 8, 16, ...\nThe next difference is 32.\nSo the next d_n is 34 + 32 = 66.\nThe next term is 3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291.\n\nThis seems to be the most logical and consistent pattern found.\n\nFinal calculation:\n*   Term 1: 2\n*   Term 2: 11\n*   Term 3: 23 = (3 * 11) - 10\n*   Term 4: 51 = (3 * 23) - 18\n*   Term 5: 119 = (3 * 51) - 34\nThe sequence of subtractions is 10, 18, 34.\nThe difference between the subtractions is 8, 16.\nThe next difference will be 32.\nThe next subtraction will be 34 + 32 = 66.\nThe next term in the main sequence is (3 * 119) - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291.Here is the step-by-step solution to the number sequence puzzle:\n\nThe given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n\n1.  First, let's examine the relationship between each consecutive number. We will test a rule of the form: `next number = (previous number * 3) - k`.\n\n2.  Let's apply this rule starting from the second term:\n    *   To get from 11 to 23: (3 * 11) - 10 = 33 - 10 = 23.\n    *   To get from 23 to 51: (3 * 23) - 18 = 69 - 18 = 51.\n    *   To get from 51 to 119: (3 * 51) - 34 = 153 - 34 = 119.\n\n3.  This rule holds for the third, fourth, and fifth terms. Now let's look at the numbers we are subtracting (`k`): 10, 18, 34.\n\n4.  Let's find the pattern in this sequence of subtracted numbers (10, 18, 34):\n    *   The difference between 18 and 10 is 8.\n    *   The difference between 34 and 18 is 16.\n\n5.  The differences are 8 and 16. This shows a doubling pattern (8 * 2 = 16). The next difference in this pattern should be 16 * 2 = 32.\n\n6.  So, the next number to be subtracted (`k`) will be 34 + 32 = 66.\n\n7.  Finally, we can find the next number in the original sequence:\n    *   (3 * 119) - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291.\n\nTherefore, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
