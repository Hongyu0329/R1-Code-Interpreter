    "To date, ten members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans. These include let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202. The let-7 family of microRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles in regulating gene expression. They are highly conserved across many species.\n\nThe let-7 family is recognized for its function as a tumor suppressor by controlling the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Misregulation of let-7 has been linked to various cancers. In humans, the let-7 family members are derived from 13 precursor genes located on different chromosomes. While some sources may mention a slightly different number, the consensus from multiple detailed reports points to ten distinct mature let-7 miRNAs.\n\n<<<10>>>"
