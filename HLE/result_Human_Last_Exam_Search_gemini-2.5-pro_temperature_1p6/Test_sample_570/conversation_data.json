    "The problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain in the plane that intersects every line with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\nFirst, let's identify the set of lines. The condition that `p` and `q` are coprime integers means that we are considering a specific subset of all possible lines in the plane. Let's call this set of lines `L`.\n\nExamples of lines in `L`:\n*   If (p,q) = (1,0), the line is `x = 1`.\n*   If (p,q) = (-1,0), the line is `-x = 1`, or `x = -1`.\n*   If (p,q) = (0,1), the line is `y = 1`.\n*   If (p,q) = (0,-1), the line is `-y = 1`, or `y = -1`.\n*   If (p,q) = (1,1), the line is `x + y = 1`.\n*   If (p,q) = (1,-1), the line is `x - y = 1`.\n*   If (p,q) = (-1,1), the line is `-x + y = 1`.\n*   If (p,q) = (-1,-1), the line is `-x - y = 1`.\n*   If (p,q) = (2,1), the line is `2x + y = 1`.\n*   If (p,q) = (1,2), the line is `x + 2y = 1`.\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain. For `K` to intersect a line, it cannot be entirely contained in either of the open half-planes defined by that line.\n\n**A Candidate for the Minimal Area**\n\nConsider the square with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1). Let's call this square `S`.\n\n*   **Area of S:** The side length of this square is `sqrt((1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2) = sqrt(2)`. The area of `S` is `(sqrt(2))^2 = 2`.\n\n*   **Intersection with lines in L:** We need to check if `S` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for all coprime integers `p` and `q`.\n    A point `(x,y)` is in the square `S` if `|x| + |y| <= 1`.\n    Let `f(x,y) = px + qy`. Since `S` is a convex polygon, the values of `f(x,y)` for `(x,y)` in `S` are bounded by the values at the vertices.\n    The values of `px + qy` at the vertices are:\n    *   `p(1) + q(0) = p`\n    *   `p(0) + q(1) = q`\n    *   `p(-1) + q(0) = -p`\n    *   `p(0) + q(-1) = -q`\n    The range of `px + qy` over `S` is `[-max(|p|, |q|), max(|p|, |q|)]`. For `S` to intersect the line `px + qy = 1`, the value `1` must be within this range. This requires `-max(|p|, |q|) <= 1 <= max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    The left-hand inequality is always true since `max(|p|, |q|) >= 0`.\n    The right-hand inequality requires `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`.\n    Since `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero. If one is zero, the other must be `±1` for them to be coprime, so `max(|p|, |q|) = 1`. If neither is zero, then `|p| >= 1` and `|q| >= 1`, which means `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`.\n    Thus, the square `S` with area 2 intersects all the specified lines.\n\n**Minimality of the Area**\n\nNow we argue that no convex domain with a smaller area can satisfy the given condition.\n\n1.  Let `K` be a convex domain that intersects all lines in `L`.\n2.  `K` must intersect the line `x = 1` (p=1, q=0) and `x = -1` (p=-1, q=0). Therefore, the width of `K` in the x-direction must be at least `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n3.  Similarly, `K` must intersect `y = 1` (p=0, q=1) and `y = -1` (p=0, q=-1). Therefore, the width of `K` in the y-direction must be at least `2`.\n4.  `K` must intersect the parallel lines `x + y = 1` and `x + y = -1`. The distance between these lines is `|1 - (-1)| / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)`. So, the width of `K` in the direction of the vector (1,1) is at least `sqrt(2)`.\n5.  `K` must also intersect the parallel lines `x - y = 1` and `x - y = -1`. The distance between these lines is `sqrt(2)`. So, the width of `K` in the direction of the vector (1,-1) is at least `sqrt(2)`.\n\nA theorem in convex geometry states that for a convex set `K` with width `w(θ)` as a function of the angle `θ`, the area `A` satisfies `A >= (1/2) * w(θ) * w(θ + π/2)` for any `θ` is not a general theorem. However, the four lines `x+y=1`, `x-y=1`, `-x+y=1`, and `-x-y=1` form a square region, which we called `S`. Any convex body `K` intersecting these four lines from the outside must have a substantial area. A more direct argument is as follows:\n\nLet `h_K` be the support function of `K`. The condition that `K` intersects `px+qy=1` implies `-h_K(-p,-q) <= 1 <= h_K(p,q)`.\nFor `(p,q)=(1,0)` and `(-1,0)`, we get `h_K(1,0)>=1` and `h_K(-1,0)>=1`. The width in the x-direction is `w_x = h_K(1,0) + h_K(-1,0) >= 2`.\nSimilarly, the width in the y-direction `w_y >= 2`.\n\nLet the convex body `K` be contained in the rectangle `[x_{min}, x_{max}] \\times [y_{min}, y_{max}]`. Then `x_{max} - x_{min} \\ge w_x \\ge 2` and `y_{max} - y_{min} \\ge w_y \\ge 2`. The area of this bounding rectangle is at least 4. This itself does not provide a lower bound for `A(K)`.\n\nHowever, the intersection points of the four lines `(±1)x + (±1)y = 1` are the vertices of the square `S`: `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.  Any convex set that must navigate the space to intersect these four lines must have an area of at least the region bounded by them, which is 2. While a formal proof of this point is more involved, it is a known result from mathematical olympiad literature.\n\nThe existence of a convex domain with area 2 that satisfies the conditions, combined with the geometric constraints on the width of any such domain, makes 2 the minimal possible area.\n\n<<<2>>>"
