The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a single number but is defined by the rules of Berezin integration, where the integral of a single Grassmann variable is zero, and the integral of the variable itself is one. This, combined with the anticommuting nature of Grassmann variables (\(\psi_i \psi_j = -\psi_j \psi_i\)), ensures that any path violating the Pauli exclusion principle has a vanishing contribution to the path integral.
