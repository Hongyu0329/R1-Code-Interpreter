    "The determinant of the given adjacency matrix is calculated as follows:\nGiven the matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant can be computed using the cofactor expansion along the first row:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nAlternatively, one can observe that the sum of the entries in each row is zero. For example, for the first row, 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0. The same applies to the second and third rows. When the sum of the rows of a matrix is the zero vector, it means that the row vectors are linearly dependent. A matrix with linearly dependent rows (or columns) has a determinant of 0.\n\nThe reference to the \"Markov quiver for m_{1/2} = 13\" appears to be contextual information that does not alter the explicitly provided matrix. The computation is based directly on the given matrix A.\n\n<<<0>>>"
