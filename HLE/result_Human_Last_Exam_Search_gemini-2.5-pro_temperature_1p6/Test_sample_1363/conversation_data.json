    "In the world of ballroom dancing, the technique of each step is precisely defined, including the amount of turn, footwork, and body action. A reverse turn is a leftward-turning figure found in many ballroom dances. The concept of \"overturning\" a turn means to rotate more than the standard prescribed amount for that figure. After a detailed technical analysis of the reverse turn in the Vienreductio ad absurdum. Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, European Tango, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep, one dance stands out where overturning a reverse turn would fundamentally violate its core technique.\n\nThe dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is the **European Tango**.\n\nThe European Tango is characterized by its sharp, staccato movements and the absence of rise and fall. The reverse turn in Tango has a very specific and compact structure. The amount of turn is precisely defined to maintain the close connection and the characteristic 'no-sway' and flat movement across the floor. The technique involves a specific pattern of steps and alignments, such as \"LF fwd in CBMP\" (Left Foot forward in Contrary Body Movement Position) and precise amounts of turn between steps (e.g., 3/8 to the left).\n\nTo overturn a reverse turn in Tango would require introducing elements that are antithetical to its technique. For example, it would necessitate a form of swing and sway, which are characteristic of the waltz and foxtrot but are not part of Tango technique. The sharp, clipped nature of Tango movements does not allow for the continuous, flowing rotation needed to add extra turn without completely altering the character and technical foundation of the dance. In essence, adding more rotation than is prescribed would fundamentally change the figure into something that is no longer a Tango reverse turn.\n\nIn contrast, the other dances listed allow for or even require overturning in certain situations, even if it is difficult:\n\n*   **Viennese Waltz:** It is explicitly stated that to navigate the corners of the ballroom (which are to the left), dancers *must* slightly overturn the reverse turns. While described as \"very very difficult,\" it is a necessary part of the dance's floorcraft.\n*   **English Waltz (Slow Waltz):** The English Waltz is characterized by its soft, continuous swinging motion, with rise and fall. While a standard reverse turn has a set amount of rotation (3/4 of a turn over six steps), the technique allows for adjustments in the amount of turn to navigate the floor. Figures like an \"overturned\" spin turn exist, demonstrating that adding rotation is part of advanced technique.\n*   **Slow Foxtrot:** Similar to the waltz, the foxtrot is a smooth, swinging dance. The technique, with its emphasis on long, gliding steps and body sway, allows for modifications in the amount of turn. Overturning a reverse turn, while challenging, would not necessarily violate the fundamental principles of the dance's movement.\n*   **Quickstep:** This is a fast-moving dance that often incorporates overturned figures to create dynamic and spectacular choreography. The syllabus for Quickstep includes variations of the reverse turn, such as the Quick Open Reverse, which itself can be turned to varying degrees. The existence of figures like an \"overturned V6\" further confirms that overturning is an accepted and practiced part of the dance.\n\nTherefore, due to the unique staccato and linear nature of its technique, the European Tango is the dance where overturning a reverse turn cannot be accomplished without fundamentally disregarding the established technical principles of the dance.\n\n<<<C>>>"
