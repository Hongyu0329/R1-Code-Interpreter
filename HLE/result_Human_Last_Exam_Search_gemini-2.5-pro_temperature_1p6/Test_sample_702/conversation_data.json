    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will analyze the connectivity of the source and target spaces and then investigate the properties of the map itself, which we assume to be the canonical one induced by composition and adjunction.\n\n### 1. Identify the spaces and the map\n\n*   **Source Space:** $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$\n*   **Target Space:** $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$\n*   The smash product of spheres $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homeomorphic to $S^{4+6} = S^{10}$. So, the target space is $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   The map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$ is best understood through its adjoint, $\\tilde{f}: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\Omega^2 S^{10}$. The canonical map $\\tilde{f}$ arises from smashing the loops: for loops $\\omega_4: S^1 \\to S^4$ and $\\omega_6: S^1 \\to S^6$, their smash product is a map $\\omega_4 \\wedge \\omega_6: S^1 \\wedge S^1 \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$. Using the homeomorphisms $S^1 \\wedge S^1 \\cong S^2$ and $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\cong S^{10}$, this gives a map $S^2 \\to S^{10}$, which is an element of $\\pi_2(S^{10})$, and by adjunction, defines the map $\\tilde{f}$.\n\n### 2. Connectivity of the spaces\n\nThe connectivity of a space is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for $i \\leq k$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of Loop Spaces:** The loop space $\\Omega S^n$ has homotopy groups $\\pi_k(\\Omega S^n) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(S^n)$. Since $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected, $\\pi_{k+1}(S^n)=0$ for $k+1 < n$, which implies $k < n-1$. Thus, $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected.\n    *   The target space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2)=8$-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the Smash Product:** If $A$ and $B$ are simply connected CW-complexes with connectivity $c_A$ and $c_B$ respectively, their smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $(c_A + c_B + 1)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected and $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected; both are simply connected.\n    *   The connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $2 + 4 + 1 = 7$. So, $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) = 0$ for $i \\le 7$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the Source Space:** The suspension of a $k$-connected space is $(k+1)$-connected.\n    *   Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, the source space $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1)=8$-connected.\n\n### 3. Connectivity of the adjoint map $\\tilde{f}$\n\nThe connectivity of a map is determined by the connectivity of its homotopy fiber. A map is $k$-connected if its homotopy fiber is $(k-1)$-connected. We analyze the induced map on homotopy groups.\n\n*   The adjoint map is $\\tilde{f}: A \\to \\Omega^2 S^{10}$, where $A = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$.\n*   The space $A$ is 7-connected. The space $\\Omega^2 S^{10}$ is also 7-connected, since $\\pi_i(\\Omega^2 S^{10}) = \\pi_{i+2}(S^{10}) = 0$ for $i+2 < 10 \\Rightarrow i<8$.\n*   For $i \\le 7$, the map $\\tilde{f}_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(\\Omega^2 S^{10})$ is an isomorphism ($0 \\to 0$).\n*   At dimension $i=8$, we consider $\\tilde{f}_*: \\pi_8(A) \\to \\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10})$.\n    *   By the Hurewicz theorem, since $A$ is 7-connected, $\\pi_8(A) \\cong H_8(A)$. By the KÃ¼nneth formula, $H_8(A) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6)$. Since $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected and $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected, Hurewicz gives $H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\cong \\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, $\\pi_8(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The target group is $\\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The map $\\tilde{f}$ is constructed from smashing identity maps, and it can be shown that the induced map $\\tilde{f}_*: \\pi_8(A) \\to \\pi_8(\\Omega^2 S^{10})$ is an isomorphism $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   Since $\\tilde{f}_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_i$ for $i \\le 8$, the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration $F_{\\tilde{f}} \\to A \\to \\Omega^2 S^{10}$ implies that $\\pi_i(F_{\\tilde{f}}) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$.\n*   Thus, the fiber $F_{\\tilde{f}}$ is 8-connected, which means the map $\\tilde{f}$ is 9-connected.\n\n### 4. Connectivity of the original map $f$\n\nWe relate the connectivity of $f$ to that of its adjoint $\\tilde{f}$ by comparing their homotopy fibers, $F_f$ and $F_{\\tilde{f}}$. There is a well-known result in homotopy theory that relates the fibers of a map $f: \\Sigma A \\to B$ and its adjoint $\\tilde{f}: A \\to \\Omega B$. The map between the fibers, $F_{\\tilde{f}} \\to \\Omega F_f$, is as connected as the unit of adjunction map $\\eta_A: A \\to \\Omega \\Sigma A$.\n\n*   The connectivity of $\\eta_A: A \\to \\Omega \\Sigma A$ is given by the Freudenthal suspension theorem, which states it is $(2 \\cdot \\text{conn}(A) + 1)$-connected.\n*   Since $A = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, the map $\\eta_A$ is $(2 \\cdot 7 + 1) = 15$-connected.\n*   The induced map on fibers $F_{\\tilde{f}} \\to \\Omega F_f$ is therefore also 15-connected.\n*   We found that $F_{\\tilde{f}}$ is 8-connected, so $\\pi_i(F_{\\tilde{f}})=0$ for $i \\le 8$.\n*   Since the map $F_{\\tilde{f}} \\to \\Omega F_f$ is an isomorphism on homotopy groups up to degree 14, we must have $\\pi_i(\\Omega F_f)=0$ for $i \\le 8$.\n*   Using the isomorphism $\\pi_i(\\Omega F_f) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(F_f)$, we get $\\pi_{i+1}(F_f) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$. This means $\\pi_j(F_f)=0$ for $j \\le 9$.\n*   Therefore, the homotopy fiber $F_f$ is 9-connected.\n*   A map whose homotopy fiber is $k$-connected is said to have connectivity $k+1$.\n*   Since $F_f$ is 9-connected, the map $f$ is 10-connected.\n\nThe connectivity of the map is the highest integer $k$ such that it induces an isomorphism on $\\pi_i$ for $i<k$ and a surjection on $\\pi_k$. Our analysis shows that this holds for $k=10$.\n\n<<<10>>>"
