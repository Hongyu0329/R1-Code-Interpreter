    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors: white, red, black, violet, and blue.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. Pure white phosphorus is a translucent waxy solid that can appear colorless or white. However, it often has a yellowish appearance due to impurities or exposure to light, which is why it is also frequently referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\nRed phosphorus has a characteristic deep red color, sometimes described as reddish-violet. It is more stable than white phosphorus.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most thermodynamically stable form of the element and has a black, flaky appearance similar to graphite.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a distinct allotrope that is typically red-purple or violet in color.\n\nA more recently synthesized allotrope is blue phosphorus, which exists as a two-dimensional material and is blue.\n\nTherefore, the count of observable colors in pure phosphorus allotropes is five.\n\n<<<5>>>"
