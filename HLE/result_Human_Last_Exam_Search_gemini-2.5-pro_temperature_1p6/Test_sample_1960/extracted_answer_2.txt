**1. The unit formula `U`:**
Let `U` be a formula constructed without literals to serve as a fundamental unit of value. A suitable choice is:
$$
U = 1 \multimap \bot
$$

**2. The function `f(w)`:**
The function `f` maps a natural number `w` to a linear logic formula that represents a resource of size `w`. It is defined as a process that completes (yields `1`) when supplied with `w` units of `U`.
$$
f(w) = (U^{\otimes w}) \multimap 1 = ((1 \multimap \bot)^{\otimes w}) \multimap 1
$$

**3. The formula `C(W, m, b)`:**
The formula `C` represents the goal of the equipartitioning problem: to form `m` bins, each containing a sum of `b`. This is encoded as a multiplicative conjunction of `m` identical formulas, where each formula represents the successful creation of a single bin of size `b`.
$$
C(W, m, b) = (f(b))^{\otimes m} = (((1 \multimap \bot)^{\otimes b}) \multimap 1)^{\otimes m}
$$
