    "The problem describes a very specific scenario at the intersection of geometry and combinatorics. Based on a result by Moshe White, for any given integer partition `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r` of a number `n`, a set of `n` points `X` can be constructed in `d`-dimensional space such that all of its Tverberg partitions correspond to this specific structure. This transforms the geometric question into a purely combinatorial one: counting the number of ways to partition a set of `n` distinct items into a collection of unordered subsets of specified sizes.\n\nThe number of Tverberg partitions for such a set `X` is given by the formula for partitioning a labeled set into unlabeled subsets of specified sizes.\n\nLet the partition of `n` be given by the parts `a_1, a_2, ..., a_r`.\nFirst, we calculate the number of ways to partition the set of `n` points into a specific sequence of subsets of these sizes. This is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n`n! / (a_1! * a_2! * ... * a_r!)`\n\nHowever, a Tverberg partition is a *set* of subsets, meaning their order does not matter. If all the `a_i` values are distinct, the above formula is the final answer. If some sizes are repeated, we have overcounted the partitions. We must divide by the number of ways to permute the subsets of identical size.\n\nLet `k_j` be the number of parts of size `j` in the partition `(a_1, a_2, ..., a_r)`. For example, if the partition is (3, 2, 2), then `k_3 = 1` and `k_2 = 2`. The total number of permutations of identically sized subsets is the product of the factorials of these counts.\n\nTherefore, the final formula for the number of Tverberg partitions of `X` is:\n\n<<<`(1 / (k_1! * k_2! * ... * k_{d+1}!)) * (n! / (a_1! * a_2! * ... * a_r!))`>>>"
