    "When starting from a single cell in state 1 and applying the cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 iterations, the resulting binary pattern is `111110011010001011111`.\n\nThis result is derived from the evolution of the cellular automaton over 20 steps. The state of each cell in a new generation is determined by its state and the state of its two immediate neighbors in the previous generation. The rules are defined by the binary representation of 110, which is `01101110`. This means, for instance, a neighborhood of `111` becomes `0`, `110` becomes `1`, and so on.\n\nThe sequence of decimal values representing the binary pattern at each step (with trailing zeros accounted for) is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A117999. To find the pattern at the 20th iteration, the 21st term of this sequence is taken and divided by 2^20.\n\nThe 21st term of sequence A117999 is 2,137,705,676,800. Dividing this by 2^20 (which is 1,048,576) yields 2,038,671. The binary representation of this number is the final pattern.\n\n<<<111110011010001011111>>>"
