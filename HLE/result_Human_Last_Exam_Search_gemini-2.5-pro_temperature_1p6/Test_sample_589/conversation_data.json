    "Based on an extensive search, there is no widely recognized Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio that contains the specific scene of a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car.\n\nWhile numerous films feature memorable bicycle scenes, and several movies from the 1980s and 1990s depict teenagers in acts of rebellion or playing \"chicken,\" the combination of all three elements—a teenager, a pink bicycle, and a direct confrontation with an oncoming car—does not appear in detailed plot summaries or scene descriptions of any major motion picture found.\n\nSearches have included various combinations of keywords such as \"teenager pink bike oncoming car movie,\" \"movie with kid on pink bike playing chicken,\" and investigations into films known for their bicycle scenes like \"Now and Then\" and movies with \"chicken\" scenes like \"Footloose\" and \"Rebel Without a Cause.\" These searches did not yield a match for the described scene.\n\nIt is possible that the user may be misremembering the details of a film, combining elements from different movies, or referring to a lesser-known independent film, a foreign film, or a television show. However, within the scope of Hollywood feature films from major studios, the described scene cannot be identified.\n\n<<<I am unable to identify a Hollywood feature film that matches the description.>>>"
