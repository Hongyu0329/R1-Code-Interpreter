    "An American in Paris, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, is the first film to hold that honor and feature a depiction of a Luxor Obelisk. The film includes a ballet sequence set in a stylized representation of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, where one of the two Luxor Obelisks has stood since 1836.\n\nWhile many earlier Best Picture winners were set in various international locations, a review of their filming locations reveals that they were primarily filmed on Hollywood studio backlots or in locations other than Paris or Luxor, Egypt, where the obelisks are located. For instance, *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), though set in Paris, was filmed in the United States. Similarly, the 1942 Best Picture winner *Casablanca* was filmed almost entirely at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.\n\n*An American in Paris* is notable for its extensive and artistic depiction of the French capital. The film's climactic 17-minute ballet sequence, in particular, showcases various Parisian landmarks. Within this sequence, a scene takes place in a setting representing the Place de la Concorde. A model of the Place de la Concorde's fountain was created and used for the production of the film. A photograph from the era also shows star Gene Kelly on a set that suggests the famous square. Although much of the Paris seen in the movie was recreated on MGM's backlot, some exterior shots were filmed in the actual city.\n\nThe 1956 Best Picture winner, *Around the World in 80 Days*, also featured on-location filming in Paris. However, as *An American in Paris* was released five years prior, it holds the distinction of being the first Best Picture winner to depict the iconic landmark.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
