The set of distances is {1.00, 1.41, 1.73, 2.00, 2.24, 2.65, 2.83, 3.00}. These values are derived from considering the stable, rigid geometrical arrangements of touching hard spheres on a 2D plane.

*   **1.00:** This represents two spheres in direct contact, which corresponds to the first and most prominent peak in the radial distribution function, g(r).
*   **1.41 (√2):** This distance occurs in a square-like arrangement, representing the diagonal across a square of four mutually touching spheres. While less dense than a hexagonal packing, such local configurations can exist in a jammed amorphous system.
*   **1.73 (√3):** This distance is characteristic of the densest, hexagonal packing. It is the shorter diagonal of a rhombus formed by two edge-sharing equilateral triangles of spheres. This distance, along with r=2.00, forms the "split second peak" that is a hallmark of amorphous solids.
*   **2.00:** This is the distance between two spheres that are separated by a third sphere in a straight line. It forms the second part of the split second peak in the g(r) of amorphous materials.
*   **2.24 (√5):** This distance arises from a "knight's move" in a square lattice arrangement (a particle at (0,0) and another at (2d, d)).
*   **2.65 (√7):** This distance is the next prominent distance found in a perfect 2D hexagonal lattice.
*   **2.83 (2√2):** This corresponds to the diagonal of a 2x2 block of spheres in a square lattice arrangement.
*   **3.00:** This distance corresponds to two spheres separated by two other spheres in a straight line or the next major distance in a hexagonal lattice.
