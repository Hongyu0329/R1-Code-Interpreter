    "The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the curve $\\{(\\cos t, \\sin t, t): 0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is $p=6$.\n\nThis curve is a segment of a helix, which is a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ because it has both non-vanishing curvature and non-vanishing torsion. The work of Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth established sharp decoupling inequalities for non-degenerate manifolds. For a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which is a curve whose velocity and first $n-1$ derivatives are linearly independent, the critical exponent for the $l^2$ decoupling inequality is $p = n(n+1)$.\n\nIn the case of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (where $n=3$), this critical exponent is $p = 3(3+1)/2 = 6$. The theory of decoupling for curves often uses the moment curve $(t, t^2, \\dots, t^n)$ as a model case. However, the results extend to general non-degenerate curves. The helix is an example of such a curve, and its sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent is therefore 6. This result is a cornerstone in the field of harmonic analysis with wide-ranging applications.\n\n<<<6>>>"
