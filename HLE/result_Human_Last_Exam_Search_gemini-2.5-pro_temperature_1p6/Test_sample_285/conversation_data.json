    "To determine the largest $p$ such that the function $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, we need to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the integral $I(a)$ for large values of its arguments $a = (a_1, \\dots, a_9)$ and determine for which $p$ the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a)|^p da$ diverges.\n\nThe integral in question is:\n$I(a_1, \\dots, a_9) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i P(a,x,y)} dxdy$\nwhere $P(a,x,y)$ is a cubic polynomial:\n$P(a,x,y) = a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$\n\nWe can find the critical exponent $p$ using a scaling argument. Let's define a non-isotropic scaling in the space of coefficients $\\mathbb{R}^9$. The scaling for each coefficient $a_j$ depends on the degree of its corresponding monomial in $x$ and $y$. Let $d_j$ be the degree of the monomial associated with the coefficient $a_j$.\n\nThe degrees are:\n*   $d_1=1$ (for $x$), $d_2=1$ (for $y$)\n*   $d_3=2$ (for $x^2$), $d_4=2$ (for $xy$), $d_5=2$ (for $y^2$)\n*   $d_6=3$ (for $x^3$), $d_7=3$ (for $x^2y$), $d_8=3$ (for $xy^2$), $d_9=3$ (for $y^3$)\n\nLet's introduce a scaling parameter $t > 0$ and define the scaled coefficients $a'_j = t^{d_j} a_j$.\nLet $a' = \\delta_t(a) = (t^{d_1}a_1, \\dots, t^{d_9}a_9)$. We want to understand how $I(a')$ behaves as a function of $t$.\n\n$I(a') = \\int_{^2} \\exp\\left(2\\pi i \\sum_{j=1}^9 t^{d_j} a_j m_j(x,y)\\right) dxdy$\nwhere $m_j(x,y)$ are the monomials ($x, y, x^2, \\dots, y^3$).\n\nNow, perform a change of variables in the integral: $x = u/t$ and $y = v/t$. The Jacobian of this transformation is $dxdy = t^{-2} dudv$. The domain of integration for $(u,v)$ becomes $[0, t]^2$.\nThe exponent becomes:\n$2\\pi i \\sum_{j=1}^9 t^{d_j} a_j (u/t)^{k_j} (v/t)^{l_j}$ where $m_j(x,y) = x^{k_j}y^{l_j}$ and the degree is $d_j = k_j + l_j$.\nThe term for $a_j$ transforms as:\n$t^{d_j} a_j (u/t)^{k_j} (v/t)^{l_j} = t^{k_j+l_j} a_j u^{k_j} v^{l_j} t^{-(k_j+l_j)} = a_j u^{k_j} v^{l_j} = a_j m_j(u,v)$\nThis means the phase of the exponential is invariant under this combined scaling of coefficients and coordinates: $\\sum a_j m_j(u,v) = P(a,u,v)$.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n$I(a') = \\int_{[0, t]^2} e^{2\\pi i P(a,u,v)} t^{-2} dudv = t^{-2} \\int_{[0, t]^2} e^{2\\pi i P(a,u,v)} dudv$\n\nFor a generic choice of $a$ and large $t$, the integral $\\int_{[0, t]^2} e^{2\\pi i P(a,u,v)} dudv$ is expected to converge to a constant value $C(a)$ that depends on $a$ but not on $t$. This is because the oscillations of the integrand tend to cancel out, and the main contributions come from stationary points or boundaries. Therefore, for large $t$, we have the asymptotic behavior:\n$I(\\delta_t(a)) \\sim t^{-2} C(a)$\n\nNow we examine the $L^p$ norm, $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a)|^p da$. Let's see how this integral behaves under the scaling $a' = \\delta_t(a)$.\nThe volume element $da = da_1 \\dots da_9$ transforms as:\n$da' = (t^{d_1} da_1) \\dots (t^{d_9} da_9) = t^{\\sum d_j} da$.\n\nLet's calculate the sum of the degrees $Q = \\sum_{j=1}^9 d_j$:\nThere are two terms of degree 1, three terms of degree 2, and four terms of degree 3.\n$Q = (2 \\times 1) + (3 \\times 2) + (4 \\times 3) = 2 + 6 + 12 = 20$.\nSo, $da' = t^{20} da$.\n\nThe integral in the scaled coordinates is:\n$\\int |I(a')|^p da' = \\int |I(\\delta_t(a))|^p t^{20} da$\nUsing the asymptotic relation $I(\\delta_t(a)) \\sim t^{-2} C(a)$, we get:\n$\\int |t^{-2} C(a)|^p t^{20} da = t^{20-2p} \\int |C(a)|^p da$\n\nThe critical exponent $p$ is the value for which the scaling factor becomes 1 (i.e., the exponent is 0). This balances the decay of the function with the growth of the volume element.\n$20 - 2p = 0 \\implies 2p = 20 \\implies p = 10$.\n\nThis means that $p=10$ is the threshold.\n*   For $p > 10$, the exponent $20-2p$ is negative. As $t \\to \\infty$, this suggests that the contribution from large values of $a$ is suppressed, and the integral converges. Thus, $I \\in L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$.\n*   For $p \\le 10$, the exponent $20-2p$ is non-negative, suggesting the integral diverges. Thus, $I \\notin L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$.\n\nThe question asks for the largest value of $p$ for which the function $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$. This corresponds to the supremum of the set of $p$ for which $I \\notin L^p$. Based on our analysis, this is $p=10$.\n\n<<<10>>>"
