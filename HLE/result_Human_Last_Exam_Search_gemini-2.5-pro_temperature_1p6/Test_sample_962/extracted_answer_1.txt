A tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be designed by using a framework similar to FROST, which includes a distributed key generation phase and a two-round signing protocol with a pre-computation step. The key to achieving tight security lies in the careful selection of the underlying cryptographic assumption and the proof technique. To avoid the security loss typically introduced by methods like the Forking Lemma, designers may need to use stronger assumptions than the standard Discrete Logarithm Problem or employ novel proof strategies.
