    "The Gauss class number problem, in the context of imaginary quadratic fields, seeks to provide a complete list of all negative fundamental discriminants *d* for which the class number *h(d)* equals a given integer *n*. For a class number of 48, this problem has been solved as part of the larger effort to classify all imaginary quadratic fields with class numbers up to 100.\n\nThe definitive work on this was completed by Mark Watkins in his 2004 paper, \"Class Numbers of Imaginary Quadratic Fields\". This paper provides a comprehensive list of these fields. Based on this work, the number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48 is known.\n\nThe number of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48 is 245.\n\n<<<245>>>"
