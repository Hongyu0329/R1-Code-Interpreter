    "The battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler that was the latest historically is the **Charge at Huj**, which occurred on November 8, 1917. This engagement was part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War.\n\nLady Butler, a prominent British painter of military scenes, created a watercolour painting immortalizing this event, which is described as one of the last great British cavalry charges. The work is titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj, 8th November 1917*.\n\nWhile Lady Butler painted several other scenes from World War I, the Charge at Huj is the latest dated battle among her known works. Other First World War battles she depicted include:\n*   **The Retreat from Mons** in 1914.\n*   **The Battle of Loos** in 1915, in a watercolour showing the London Irish Rifles.\n*   **The Action of Agagia** on February 26, 1916.\n\nHer paintings covered a wide range of historical conflicts, including the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, and various colonial wars.\n\n<<<The Charge at Huj>>>"
