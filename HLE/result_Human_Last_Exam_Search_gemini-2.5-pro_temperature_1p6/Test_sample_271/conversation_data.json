    "To determine the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, we first need to identify the Galois group of the polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be this Galois group.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the intermediate fields $L$ (where $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq L \\subseteq K$) and the subgroups of $G$. Furthermore, an extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if the corresponding subgroup, $\\text{Gal}(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G$. The degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by the index of this subgroup, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G : \\text{Gal}(K/L)]$.\n\nThe problem asks for the degrees of all normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ that are proper superfields of $\\mathbb{Q}$ and proper subfields of $K$. This translates to finding the indices of all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$.\n\nThe computation of the Galois group of a degree 7 polynomial is a complex task that generally requires computational algebra software. Using such software (like Magma or PARI/GP), one can determine that the Galois group of the given polynomial is isomorphic to the projective special linear group $PSL(2,7)$, also known as $PSL(3,2)$ or $GL(3,2)$. This group acts as a transitive permutation group on the 7 roots of the polynomial, and its order is 168.\n\nThe crucial property of the group $G = PSL(2,7)$ is that it is a simple group. A simple group is a non-trivial group whose only normal subgroups are the trivial subgroup (containing only the identity element) and the group itself.\n\nThe subgroups of $G$ are:\n1.  The trivial subgroup, $\\{e\\}$, which corresponds to the field $L=K$. This is not a proper subfield of $K$.\n2.  The group $G$ itself, which corresponds to the field $L=\\mathbb{Q}$. This is not a proper superfield of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince $PSL(2,7)$ is simple, it has no proper, non-trivial normal subgroups. Consequently, there are no intermediate fields $L$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ for which the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal.\n\nTherefore, the set of possible degrees is empty.\n\n<<<There are no possible degrees for such normal field extensions.>>>"
