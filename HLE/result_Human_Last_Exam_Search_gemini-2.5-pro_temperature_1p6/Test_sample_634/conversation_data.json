    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This method involves stacking the matrices and using elementary row operations to reduce the stack to a form that reveals the GCRD.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s² + s, -s;\n      -s² - 1, s²]\n\nP2 = [s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 1: Form a compound matrix M.**\nWe stack the matrices P1 and P2 to form a single 4x2 matrix M:\nM =\n  [s² + s,  -s]     (R1)\n  [-s² - 1,  s²]     (R2)\n  [s,        0]      (R3)\n  [-s - 1,   1]      (R4)\n\n**Step 2: Apply elementary row operations.**\nThe goal is to use polynomial row operations to simplify this matrix into the form `[G; 0]`, where G is a GCRD. The allowed operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\nLet's perform the operations:\n*   Add Row 2 to Row 1 (`R1' = R1 + R2`):\n    [s² + s + (-s² - 1), -s + s²] = [s - 1, s² - s]\n    Our matrix becomes:\n    M' =\n      [s - 1,  s(s-1)]   (R1')\n      [-s² - 1,  s²]      (R2)\n      [s,        0]       (R3)\n      [-s - 1,   1]       (R4)\n\n*   Subtract Row 1' from Row 2 (`R2' = R2 - R1'`). This is not the best step. Let's find a more direct path. Let's restart the row reduction for clarity.\n\n**Step 2 (Revised): Systematic Row Reduction**\n\nLet's use the row with the lowest degree polynomial in the first column (R3) to simplify others.\n\n1.  Replace R1 with R1 - (s+1)*R3:\n    `[s² + s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s² + s - (s²+s), -s] = [0, -s]`\n2.  Replace R2 with R2 + s*R3:\n    `[-s² - 1, s²] + s[s, 0] = [-s² - 1 + s², s²] = [-1, s²]`\n3.  Replace R4 with R4 + R3:\n    `[-s - 1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-1, 1]`\n\nThe matrix is now:\nM'' =\n  [0,   -s]\n  [-1,  s²]\n  [s,   0]\n  [-1,  1]\n\n4.  Now, use the new fourth row `[-1, 1]` to simplify. Replace R2 with R2 - R4:\n    `[-1, s²] - [-1, 1] = [0, s²-1]`\n5.  Replace R3 with R3 + s*R4:\n    `[s, 0] + s[-1, 1] = [s-s, s] = [0, s]`\n\nThe matrix becomes:\nM''' =\n  [0,   -s]\n  [0,  s²-1]\n  [0,   s]\n  [-1,  1]\n\n6.  We can see that the first row is `-1` times the third row. Let's make the first row zero. Replace R1 with R1 + R3:\n    `[0, -s] + [0, s] = [0, 0]`\n7.  Now use row 3 `[0, s]` to simplify row 2 `[0, s²-1]`. Using polynomial division, `s²-1 = s * (s) - 1`. The corresponding row operation is `R2_new = R2 - s*R3`.\n    `[0, s²-1] - s[0, s] = [0, s²-1 - s²] = [0, -1]`\n\nThe matrix is now:\nM'''' =\n  [0,   0]\n  [0,  -1]\n  [0,   s]\n  [-1,  1]\n\n8.  Multiply the second row by -1 to get `[0, 1]`.\n9.  Use this `[0, 1]` to eliminate other non-zero elements in the second column.\n    *   Replace R3 with R3 - s*R2_new: `[0, s] - s[0, 1] = [0, 0]`\n    *   Replace R4 with R4 - 1*R2_new: `[-1, 1] - [0, 1] = [-1, 0]`\n\nThe matrix is now:\nM''''' =\n  [0,   0]\n  [0,   1]\n  [0,   0]\n  [-1,  0]\n\nThe non-zero rows are `[0, 1]` and `[-1, 0]`. After multiplying the last row by -1 and reordering, we get:\n \n \n\nThis corresponds to the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\nThe row reduction of the stacked matrix `[P1; P2]` results in the identity matrix `I`. This means that `P1` and `P2` are right coprime.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix, `I = [1, 0; 0, 1]`. Any unimodular matrix is also a valid GCRD, but the identity matrix is the canonical representation.\n\n"
