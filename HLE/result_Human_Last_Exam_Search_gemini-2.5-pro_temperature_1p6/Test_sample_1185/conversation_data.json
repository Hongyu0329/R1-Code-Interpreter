    "The number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2 is a complex question with an answer that depends on the specific classification scheme being used. The foundational work in this area is the comprehensive classification by Yukihiko Namikawa and Kenji Ueno.\n\nAccording to a 2023 paper by Sükeyna Sakallı and Jeremy Van Horn-Morris, the work of Namikawa and Ueno identified 120 distinct types of singular fibers in pencils of genus 2 curves. These types are described by the combinatorial arrangement of the irreducible components of the stable curve, which can be rational or elliptic curves, and the way they intersect.\n\nA different count is provided by the documentation for \"redlib\", a library for reduction types of curves, which states there are 104 Namikawa-Ueno types for genus 2. The discrepancy between these numbers may arise from different ways of grouping or counting the original classifications presented by Namikawa and Ueno.\n\nThe classification can be further refined when considering more specific contexts. For example, a 2025 paper by Tim Gehrunger provides a classification for the stable marked reduction of hyperelliptic genus 2 curves in residue characteristic 2, resulting in 54 distinct types. This demonstrates that the number of stable reduction types can vary depending on whether the curves have marked points and the arithmetic properties of the field over which the reduction is considered.\n\nIn summary, while there is no single, universally agreed-upon number, the most frequently cited complete classification by Namikawa and Ueno is stated to contain either 104 or 120 types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n<<<120, with the note that other classifications and contexts yield different numbers.>>>"
