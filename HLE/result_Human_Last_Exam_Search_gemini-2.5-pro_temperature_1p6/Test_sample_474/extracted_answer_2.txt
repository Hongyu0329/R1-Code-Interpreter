The approach of using untrained undergraduates to cluster *Bombus* species by visual similarity is **partially valid but has significant limitations** when considering the ecological function of mimicry. The validity hinges on the extent to which human perception is a reasonable proxy for the perception of the primary predators of bumblebees, which are mainly birds.

**Arguments for the method's validity include:**

*   **Generalization:** Predators often make quick judgments based on general appearance, and untrained humans might approximate this "generalist predator" perspective. Research has shown that humans, acting as "predators," can effectively group mimetic species, and these groupings can align with those identified by more complex methods. One study even found that human rankings of mimicry correlated with the responses of avian predators.
*   **Practicality:** It is a straightforward and accessible method for generating initial hypotheses about mimicry rings.

**However, the ecological validity of this approach is undermined by several key factors:**

*   **Fundamental Differences in Vision:** The most significant flaw is the difference between human and avian vision. Most birds are tetrachromats, meaning they can see ultraviolet (UV) light, which is invisible to trichromatic humans. This means that two bumblebee species that appear identical to a human may look distinctly different to a bird if their color patterns have different UV reflectance properties.
*   **Enhanced Color Discrimination:** Birds also have a higher density of cone cells and oil droplets in their eyes that filter light, allowing them to perceive more shad
