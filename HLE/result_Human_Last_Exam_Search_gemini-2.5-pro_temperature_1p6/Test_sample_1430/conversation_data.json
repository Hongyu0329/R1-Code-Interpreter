    "The smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\nLet C be a Riemann surface of genus g=3, and let X be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as Sym¹⁵(C). The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a variety is also known as its Picard number, denoted by ρ. We are looking for the minimum and maximum possible values of ρ(X).\n\nA crucial result by Arnaud Beauville governs the Picard number of the symmetric power of a curve. For a curve C of genus g and an integer n ≥ g-1, the Picard number of Symⁿ(C) is given by:\n*   ρ(Symⁿ(C)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1, if C is not hyperelliptic.\n*   ρ(Symⁿ(C)) = ρ(J(C)) + 2, if C is hyperelliptic.\nHere, J(C) is the Jacobian variety of the curve C.\n\nIn our case, g=3 and n=15, so the condition n ≥ g-1 (15 ≥ 2) is satisfied. Thus, we need to determine the smallest and largest possible values of ρ(J(C)) for both non-hyperelliptic and hyperelliptic curves of genus 3.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe Picard number of the Jacobian of a \"very general\" curve of genus g is 1. In this case, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the theta divisor.\n\n1.  **Non-hyperelliptic case:** A generic curve of genus 3 is non-hyperelliptic (it can be represented as a smooth quartic curve in the projective plane). For such a curve C, ρ(J(C)) = 1. Using Beauville's formula, the rank for X is:\n    ρ(X) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n2.  **Hyperelliptic case:** For a generic hyperelliptic curve C of genus 3, its Jacobian also has ρ(J(C)) = 1. In this case, the rank for X is:\n    ρ(X) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nComparing the two results, the smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe Picard number of an abelian variety of dimension g, such as J(C), is at most g². For g=3, ρ(J(C)) ≤ 9. This maximum is achieved when J(C) has complex multiplication (CM) by a large algebra of endomorphisms.\n\n1.  **Non-hyperelliptic case:** The maximum rank ρ(J(C))=9 is achieved for certain special curves. A prime example is the Fermat quartic curve defined by the equation X⁴ + Y⁴ + Z⁴ = 0. This is a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 3. Its Jacobian is known to be isogenous to the cube of a certain elliptic curve with complex multiplication, which gives it the maximal Picard number ρ(J(C)) = 9. Since the Fermat quartic is not hyperelliptic, the rank for X is:\n    ρ(X) = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n2.  **Hyperelliptic case:** For a hyperelliptic curve C, its Jacobian J(C) can also have complex multiplication. However, the structure of these Jacobians is more constrained. It is known that if the Jacobian of a curve is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve (the setup giving ρ=9), the curve must be the Fermat quartic, which is not hyperelliptic. The maximum known Picard number for the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve of genus 3 appears to be 6. This occurs when J(C) splits into a product of three non-isogenous elliptic curves, each with complex multiplication. For such a hyperelliptic curve, the rank for X would be:\n    ρ(X) = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nComparing the maximum values, the largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
