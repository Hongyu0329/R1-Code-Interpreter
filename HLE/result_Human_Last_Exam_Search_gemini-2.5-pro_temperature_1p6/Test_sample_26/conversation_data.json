    "Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is the dimension of the vector space $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. This can be calculated using the methods of rational homotopy theory.\n\nFirst, we determine the rational cohomology of $X$. Being a smooth complex surface (a real 4-manifold), $X$ is simply connected, so its first Betti number $b_1(X)$ is 0. By Poincar√© duality, $b_3(X)$ is also 0. The Betti numbers are known to be:\n*   $b_0(X) = 1$\n*   $b_1(X) = 0$\n*   $b_2(X) = 53$\n*   $b_3(X) = 0$\n*   $b_4(X) = 1$\n\nThe rank of a homotopy group is determined by its rationalization, which can be computed using a minimal Sullivan model $(\\Lambda V, d)$. The dimension of the generating space $V^k$ is the rank of the k-th homotopy group, $\\text{rank}(\\pi_k(X)) = \\dim(V^k)$.\n\nThe minimal model must reproduce the rational cohomology of $X$.\n1.  Since $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X)=0$), the space of generators of degree 1 is trivial ($V^1=0$).\n2.  The Hurewicz theorem implies that $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X)$, so the rank of $\\pi_2(X)$ is $b_2(X)=53$. Therefore, the space of generators of degree 2, $V^2$, has dimension 53.\n3.  The cohomology of the model in degree 3 is given by $H^3(\\Lambda V, d)$. Since $H^3(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, we must have $\\ker(d: V^3 \\to \\Lambda^2 V^2) = 0$. This implies the differential $d$ is injective on $V^3$.\n4.  To determine the dimension of $V^3$, we need to analyze the homotopy of the fiber of the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$. Let $F$ be this homotopy fiber. The long exact sequence of homotopy groups of the fibration implies that $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_k(F)$ for $k \\ge 3$, since $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$ for $k=3,4$.\n5.  A standard result in algebraic topology relates the homology of the fiber $F$ to the relative homology of the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$, namely $H_k(F) \\cong H_{k+1}(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$. The long exact sequence of homology for the pair gives the relative homology groups. In particular, we find that the rational cohomology of the fiber $F$ is:\n    *   $H^0(F; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$\n    *   $H^1(F; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$\n    *   $H^2(F; \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}^{52}$\n    *   $H^k(F; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ for $k \\geq 3$.\n6.  Now we apply rational homotopy theory to the space $F$. Let $(\\Lambda V_F, d_F)$ be its minimal model.\n    *   $\\dim(V_F^2) = b_2(F) = 52$.\n    *   $H^3(F; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ implies that $d_F: V_F^3 \\to \\Lambda^2 V_F^2$ is injective.\n    *   $H^4(F; \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ implies that $d_F$ maps $V_F^3$ isomorphically onto $\\Lambda^2 V_F^2$.\n7.  This means the dimension of $V_F^3$ must equal the dimension of $\\Lambda^2 V_F^2$.\n    $\\dim(V_F^3) = \\dim(\\Lambda^2 V_F^2) = \\binom{\\dim V_F^2}{2} = \\binom{52}{2}$.\n8.  $\\binom{52}{2} = \\frac{52 \\times 51}{2} = 26 \\times 51 = 1326$.\n\nSince the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is equal to the rank of $\\pi_3(F)$, which is the dimension of $V_F^3$, we find that the rank is 1326.\n\n<<<1326>>>"
