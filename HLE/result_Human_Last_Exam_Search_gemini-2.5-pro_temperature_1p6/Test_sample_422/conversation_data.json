    "With the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge, and constrained to only the epistemic states of \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" two significant problems emerge that are not Gettier-related. These problems highlight the inherent difficulties in the \"justification\" and \"truth\" components of the definition when faced with a rigid binary classification of what we can claim to know or merely believe.\n\n<<<Here are two problems the JTB definition of knowledge runs into, ignoring Gettier problems, when the only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief:\n\n**1. The Regress Problem of Justification:**\n\nThe \"justification\" component of the JTB definition faces a significant challenge known as the regress problem. This problem questions how any belief can be ultimately justified. If every belief must be justified by another belief, we are faced with three undesirable outcomes:\n\n*   **An infinite regress:** Each justification requires a further justification, creating an endless chain that never provides a solid foundation for knowledge.\n*   **Circular reasoning:** The chain of justification eventually circles back to the original belief it was meant to support, which is a logically fallacious way to provide justification.\n*   **Arbitrary foundations:** The chain of justifications terminates with a \"foundational\" belief that is not itself justified. If this is the case, it's unclear why such an arbitrary starting point should be considered a solid basis for knowledge.\n\nThis creates a dilemma: if our epistemic states are limited to \"Knowledge\" (which requires justification) and \"Belief\" (which may be unjustified), the regress problem suggests that we might not have any knowledge at all, as the justification condition can never be satisfactorily met. Various theories of justification like foundationalism, coherentism, and infinitism have been proposed to address this, but they each have their own set of challenges.\n\n**2. The Problem of Dogmatism and Skepticism from a Strict Binary:**\n\nThe limitation to only two epistemic states, \"Knowledge\" (as Justified True Belief) and \"Belief\" (as anything less), creates a rigid and problematic binary. This is especially apparent when considering that justification is not always a matter of all or nothing; it can come in degrees. This rigidity leads to two opposing issues:\n\n*   **Skepticism:** Many of our strongly held and well-supported true beliefs are based on evidence that is not absolutely conclusive or infallible. Because these justifications are fallible, they might not meet a strict standard for the \"justification\" condition of JTB. Consequently, these beliefs would be relegated to the category of mere \"Belief,\" leading to a form of skepticism where very little can be legitimately called \"Knowledge.\"\n\n*   **Dogmatism:** On the other hand, if we adopt a more lenient view of what constitutes sufficient justification to avoid widespread skepticism, we risk being dogmatic. We might label beliefs as \"Knowledge\" even when the justification is relatively weak, simply because it meets some minimal threshold. This devalues the concept of knowledge and blurs the line between well-founded certainty and confident opinion.\n\nThe core issue is that the JTB definition, when forced into a simple binary of \"Knowledge\" or \"Belief,\" lacks the nuance to account for the varying degrees of justification that our beliefs actually possess. It forces a choice between an overly stringent standard that leads to skepticism or an overly permissive one that leads to dogmatism.>>>"
