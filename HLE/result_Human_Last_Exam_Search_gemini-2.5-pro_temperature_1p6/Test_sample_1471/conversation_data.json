    "To solve the equation, we first need to translate the ancient Egyptian numerals into modern-day numbers.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the hieroglyphs:\n\n*   ** मिलियन** (a seated man, representing the god Heh): This symbol stands for 1,000,000 or infinity.\n*   **𒌋** (a heel bone): This symbol represents the number 10.\n*   **𒁹** (a single stroke): This symbol represents the number 1.\n\nThe ancient Egyptian numeral system was additive, meaning the values of the symbols are added together. It was also based on multiples of ten.\n\nNow, let's convert the numbers in the equation:\n\n*   **मिलियन** = 1,000,000\n*   **𒌋𒌋𒌋** = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30\n*   **𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹** = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23\n\nWith these modern numbers, the equation becomes:\n\n1,000,000 / 30 - 23\n\nNow, we can solve the equation:\n\n1.  First, perform the division: 1,000,000 / 30 ≈ 33,333.33\n2.  Next, perform the subtraction: 33,333.33 - 23 = 33,310.33\n\nThus, the solution to the equation is approximately 33,310.33.\n\n<<<33310.33>>>"
