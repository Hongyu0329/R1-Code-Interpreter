    "The number of 10-step self-avoiding walks, a(10), on a Manhattan lattice (a square lattice) is 44,100. A self-avoiding walk is a sequence of moves on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The enumeration of such walks is a complex combinatorial problem with no known simple formula. For a small number of steps, the count can be determined computationally, and for a 10-step walk on a square lattice, the value has been calculated to be 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
