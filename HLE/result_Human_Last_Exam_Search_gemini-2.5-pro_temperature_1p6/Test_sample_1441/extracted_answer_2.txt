In scalar field theories below the upper critical dimension of four, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, scales with spatial dimensionality, d, according to the epsilon expansion. To leading order in ε = 4 - d, the relationship is given by α = [(4 - n) / (2(n + 8))] * ε, where n is the number of components of the order parameter. This indicates that α is directly proportional to the deviation of the dimensionality from four.
