    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While several species of mushrooms are blue in color, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nFor instance, the beautiful *Entoloma hochstetteri*, found in New Zealand and India, is a vibrant blue mushroom, but it produces a pink to reddish-pink spore print. Another well-known blue mushroom, *Lactarius indigo*, which is found in North and Central America and East Asia, has a cream to yellowish spore print. The *Stropharia caerulea*, or blue roundhead, has a purple-brown to purple-black spore print.\n\nSpore prints are a crucial characteristic for identifying mushrooms and come in a range of colors, most commonly white, cream, black, brown, and shades of red or purple. A green spore print is a key identifier for the poisonous *Chlorophyllum molybdites*. However, a blue spore print has not been documented.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
