    "Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1_68, likely from the plague, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England. Some sources indicate she died at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England.\n\nAt the time of Blanche's death, Geoffrey Chaucer was in England. He had become a member of King Edward III's royal court as an esquire by June 1367. His wife, Philippa, was a lady-in-waiting to the queen. While Chaucer did travel abroad multiple times for diplomatic missions, records indicate he was on the continent for the king's service at some point in 1368, and in 1369 he served with John of Gaunt's army in France. However, his first major poem, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" was written in England as an elegy to commemorate Blanche's death in 1368. This close connection to the court and the creation of this commemorative work strongly suggest he was in England when she passed away.\n\n<<<C>>>"
