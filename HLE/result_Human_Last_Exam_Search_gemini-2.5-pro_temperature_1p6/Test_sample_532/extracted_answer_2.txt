A finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if it is a direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, where each Sylow p-subgroup is a filled p-group from the following list:
- For p an odd prime, the cyclic groups C₃ or C₅.
- For p = 2, an elementary abelian 2-group ((C₂)ⁿ), the dihedral group D₈, D₈ × C₂, the central product D₈ ∗ Q₈, or (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.
