    "A finite group G is termed a **filled group** if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G is complete. A set is complete if every non-identity element of the group is either in the set or can be expressed as a product of two elements from the set. This property has been studied to classify specific families of finite groups.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups can be determined by examining their Sylow p-subgroups. A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups. For a nilpotent group to be filled, each of its Sylow p-subgroups must also be a filled group.\n\nThe classification is as follows:\n\nA finite nilpotent group G is filled if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, where each Sylow p-subgroup is one of the following filled p-groups:\n\n*   **For odd primes p:** The only filled p-groups are the cyclic groups **C₃** and **C₅**.\n*   **For the prime p = 2:** The filled 2-groups are:\n    *   **Abelian:** Elementary abelian 2-groups, which are isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of order 2, (C₂)ⁿ for some n ≥ 1.\n    *   **Non-Abelian:** The following four groups:\n        *   The dihedral group of order 8, **D₈**.\n        *   The direct product **D₈ × C₂**.\n        *   The central product of a dihedral group of order 8 and a quaternion group of order 8, **D₈ ∗ Q₈**.\n        *   The direct product **(D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂**.\n\nTherefore, any finite filled nilpotent group must be a direct product of groups selected from the lists above, with at most one group for each distinct prime factor of the group's order. For instance, C₃ × (C₂)³, C₅ × D₈, and D₈ ∗ Q₈ are all examples of finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if it is a direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, where each Sylow p-subgroup is a filled p-group from the following list:\n- For p an odd prime, the cyclic groups C₃ or C₅.\n- For p = 2, an elementary abelian 2-group ((C₂)ⁿ), the dihedral group D₈, D₈ × C₂, the central product D₈ ∗ Q₈, or (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.>>>"
