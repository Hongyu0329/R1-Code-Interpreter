    "The user's request is a riddle wrapped in a haiku. Let's break it down to find the answer.\n\n**1. Analyzing the Haiku:**\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This points to a significant and turbulent event occurring in the month of August.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30. This likely refers to the year 30 BC, a year that ushered in a major political transformation.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This alludes to the death of a figure who was considered a deity. Cleopatra, who was proclaimed the daughter of the Egyptian sun god Ra, took her own life in August of 30 BC. Her death marked the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt.\n\nThe haiku encapsulates the events surrounding the death of Cleopatra. After being defeated by Octavian's forces at the Battle of Actium, Cleopatra and Mark Antony fled to Egypt. Following Antony's suicide and Octavian's capture of Alexandria, Cleopatra took her own life to avoid being paraded in a Roman triumph. Her death in 30 BC led to Egypt's annexation by Rome, a pivotal \"wind of change\" that consolidated Octavian's power and marked the beginning of the Roman Empire.\n\n**2. The Title as a Question: \"The Bays\"**\n\nThe title \"The Bays\" can be interpreted in a couple of ways that tie into the haiku's subject:\n\n*   **A Location**: The decisive naval battle that sealed Cleopatra and Antony's fate was the Battle of Actium, which took place in a bay on the western coast of Greece, at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf.\n*   **A Symbol of Victory**: \"Bays\" can also refer to bay leaves, which were woven into laurel wreaths in ancient Rome to symbolize victory. Triumphant generals and emperors wore these wreaths as a mark of honor.\n\nThe question \"The Bays\" can therefore be understood as, \"Who were the key figures involved in the conflict at the bay (Actium) and the struggle for the victor's laurels (the bays)?\"\n\n**3. The Alphabetical Answer**\n\nThe user requests the answer in alphabetical order. The three central figures in this historical drama are:\n\n*   **Antony** (Mark Antony)\n*   **Cleopatra**\n*   **Octavian** (later Augustus)\n\nArranging their names alphabetically provides the answer.\n\n<<<Antony, Cleopatra, Octavian>>>"
