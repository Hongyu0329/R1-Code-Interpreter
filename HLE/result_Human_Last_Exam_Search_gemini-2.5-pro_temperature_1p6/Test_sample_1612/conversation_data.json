    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), there have been 17 players who have won the batting Triple Crown. This prestigious accomplishment involves a player leading their league in three key offensive categories: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.\n\nHowever, in 2020, MLB officially recognized the statistics of seven Negro Leagues that operated between 1920 and 1948 as major league records. This inclusion added eight more players to the list of Triple Crown winners, bringing the total to 27 or 28, according to various sources.\n\nThe most recent player to win the Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera for the Detroit Tigers in 2012, ending a 45-year gap since the previous winner. His winning statistics were a .330 batting average, 44 home runs, and 139 RBIs.\n\nHere is a list of the MLB Triple Crown winners:\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942, 1947)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, 1925)\n*   **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n*   **Tip Oâ€™Neill** (1887)\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878)\n\nWith the inclusion of the Negro Leagues' statistics, the following players are also recognized as Triple Crown winners:\n*   **Ted Strong** (1942)\n*   **Lennie Pearson** (1942)\n*   **Josh Gibson** (1936, 1937)\n*   **Willie Wells** (1930)\n*   **Mule Suttles** (1926)\n*   **Oscar Charleston** (1921, 1924, 1925)\n*   **Heavy Johnson** (1923)\n\nIt is worth noting that some sources mention a discrepancy in the total number of winners due to historical record-keeping. Four players have won the Triple Crown multiple times: Oscar Charleston (3 times), Rogers Hornsby (2 times), Josh Gibson (2 times), and Ted Williams (2 times).\n\n<<<17>>>"
