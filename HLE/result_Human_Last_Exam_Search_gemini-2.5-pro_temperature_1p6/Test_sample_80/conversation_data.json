    "A standard chessboard has 64 squares. The edge squares are those on the perimeter of the board. The number of edge squares on an 8x8 board is 28. This can be calculated as the total number of squares (64) minus the number of interior squares (6x6 = 36), which is 28. Alternatively, each of the four sides has 8 squares, but the 4 corner squares are counted twice, so the total is (4 * 8) - 4 = 28.\n\nIn chess, a bishop moves diagonally on squares of the same color. This means that a bishop placed on a white square can only attack other pieces on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack pieces on black squares. Therefore, the problem of placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares can be split into two independent problems: one for the white edge squares and one for the black edge squares.\n\nOf the 28 edge squares, 14 are white and 14 are black.\n\n**Maximizing Bishops on White Edge Squares:**\nTo find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 white edge squares, we need to consider how many of these squares lie on the same diagonals.\nA known method for this is to count the number of diagonals in both directions.\nThe number of non-attacking bishops cannot exceed the number of diagonals in either direction. For the 14 white edge squares, there are 7 diagonals in one direction and 8 in the other. Thus, a maximum of 7 bishops can be placed on the white edge squares without attacking each other.\n\n**Maximizing Bishops on Black Edge Squares:**\nSimilarly, for the 14 black edge squares, there are 8 diagonals in one direction and 7 in the other. Therefore, a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops can be placed on the black edge squares.\n\n**Total Number of Bishops:**\nBy combining the results for both colors, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares of a chessboard without any attacking each other is the sum of the maximums for each color, which is 7 + 7 = 14. This is consistent with the general formula for the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on an n x n board, which is 2n - 2 (for n=8, this is 14).\n\n**Calculating the Empty Edge Squares:**\nIf the two people succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of bishops on the edge squares, they would have placed 14 bishops. The number of edge squares that would lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the number of bishops placed.\n\nTotal edge squares: 28\nNumber of bishops placed: 14\nEdge squares lacking bishops: 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
