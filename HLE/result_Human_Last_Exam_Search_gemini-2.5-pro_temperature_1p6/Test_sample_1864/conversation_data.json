    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with the detection channels AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, preparing a comprehensive set of controls is critical for obtaining accurate and reproducible results. Here are the essential controls you should prepare:\n\n### **Types of Essential Controls:**\n\n1.  **Unstained Control (Cells only):** This sample consists of your cells without any fluorescent labels. It is essential for determining the baseline autofluorescence of your cell population and for setting the initial forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) voltages to identify your cells of interest.\n\n2.  **Beads Only Control:** Since you are using Streptavidin beads for sorting, you need a sample containing only the beads. This control is crucial for assessing the intrinsic fluorescence or \"autofluorescence\" of the beads in each of your detection channels, ensuring that the beads themselves do not contribute to the signal.\n\n3.  **Viability Control:** Including a viability dye is critical in virtually all flow cytometry experiments, especially for sorting. Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies and have higher autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results. You should include a viability dye in all your stained samples. This dye will occupy one of your fluorescent channels, allowing you to gate on and sort only live cells.\n\n4.  **Single-Stain (Compensation) Controls:** For any multicolor experiment, you must correct for spectral overlap, which is when the fluorescence of one dye is detected in another's channel. To do this, you need to prepare a separate control for each fluorochrome in your panel.\n    *   **5 Controls Total:** One for each of the five fluorochromes (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750).\n    *   These controls can be prepared using either your cells or compensation beads, but they must provide a clear positive and negative population for each color. The signal from the positive population should be as bright or brighter than what you expect in your fully stained sample.\n    *   For the GFP channel, you can use cells that express GFP alongside a negative population, or you can use specialized GFP compensation beads.\n\n5.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** FMO controls are essential for accurate gating in multicolor experiments, particularly when a marker is dimly expressed or shows a continuous expression pattern rather than a distinct positive and negative population. An FMO control includes all the stains in your panel *except* for one. This allows you to see the spread of fluorescence from all other channels into the channel of the omitted fluorochrome, enabling you to set a precise gate that distinguishes true positive signal from background.\n    *   **5 Controls Total:** For a five-color panel, you should ideally prepare five different FMO controls, one for each channel (e.g., an \"FMO-PE\" control would be stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750, but not PE).\n\n### **Summary and Count:**\n\nTo properly set up your sorter and ensure the accuracy of your data, you should prepare the following set of control tubes:\n\n*   **1x Unstained Cells:** To assess cell autofluorescence.\n*   **1x Beads Only:** To assess bead autofluorescence.\n*   **5x Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** One for each fluorochrome (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750) to calculate compensation.\n*   **5x Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** One for each channel to accurately set your sorting gates.\n\nThis brings the total number of essential control preparations to **12**. In addition to these controls, you will have your fully stained experimental sample that you intend to sort. Including biological controls (positive and negative cell populations) and considering isotype controls for validating antibody specificity are also good practices, though FMOs are generally preferred over isotypes for setting gates.\n\n<<<12>>>"
