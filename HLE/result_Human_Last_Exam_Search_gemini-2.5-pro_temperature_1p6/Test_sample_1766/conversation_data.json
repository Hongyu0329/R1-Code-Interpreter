    "In the problem of spin-orbit coupling for a p-electron, the total angular momentum **J** is the sum of the orbital angular momentum **L** and the spin angular momentum **S**. For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is *l* = 1, and the spin quantum number is *s* = 1/2.\n\nThe operators for the square of the total angular momentum, $J^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum, $J_z$, commute with each other. This allows for a set of common eigenstates, which are simultaneously eigenstates of both operators. The eigenvalues of these operators are determined by the total angular momentum quantum number *j* and the total magnetic quantum number *m_j*.\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number *j* are obtained by the vector addition of the orbital and spin angular momenta, ranging from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps.\n\nFor a p-electron (*l* = 1, *s* = 1/2):\n*   *j* can take the values |1 - 1/2| = 1/2 and 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula ħ²*j*(*j* + 1), and the eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by ħ*$m_j$*, where *m_j* can take values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\nThe common eigenvalues are therefore found for each possible value of *j*:\n\n### For the state with j = 3/2:\nThe eigenvalue of $J^2$ is:\nħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = ħ² * (3/2) * (5/2) = **(15/4)ħ²**\n\nThe possible values for *m_j* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are:\n*   **- (3/2)ħ**\n*   **- (1/2)ħ**\n*   ** (1/2)ħ**\n*   ** (3/2)ħ**\n\nThis gives a set of four common eigenstates, often referred to as a quartet.\n\n### For the state with j = 1/2:\nThe eigenvalue of $J^2$ is:\nħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = ħ² * (1/2) * (3/2) = **(3/4)ħ²**\n\nThe possible values for *m_j* are -1/2 and 1/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are:\n*   **- (1/2)ħ**\n*   ** (1/2)ħ**\n\nThis gives a set of two common eigenstates, often referred to as a doublet.\n\nIn summary, the common eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron are:\n*   For the *j* = 3/2 states:\n    *   $J^2$ eigenvalue: (15/4)ħ²\n    *   $J_z$ eigenvalues: (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (-3/2)ħ\n*   For the *j* = 1/2 states:\n    *   $J^2$ eigenvalue: (3/4)ħ²\n    *   $J_z$ eigenvalues: (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ\n\n<<<\nThe common eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$ are determined by the possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, and the associated magnetic quantum number, *m_j*. For a p-electron, *l*=1 and *s*=1/2, leading to *j*=3/2 and *j*=1/2.\n\n**Case 1: j = 3/2**\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is *j*(*j*+1)ħ² = (3/2)(3/2+1)ħ² = (15/4)ħ².\n*   The possible values for *m_j* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are $m_j$ħ, which are (-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ.\n\n**Case 2: j = 1/2**\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is *j*(*j*+1)ħ² = (1/2)(1/2+1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².\n*   The possible values for *m_j* are -1/2, 1/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are $m_j$ħ, which are (-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ.\n>>>"
