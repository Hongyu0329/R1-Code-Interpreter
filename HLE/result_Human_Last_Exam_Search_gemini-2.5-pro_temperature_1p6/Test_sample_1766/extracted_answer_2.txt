The common eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$ are determined by the possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, and the associated magnetic quantum number, *m_j*. For a p-electron, *l*=1 and *s*=1/2, leading to *j*=3/2 and *j*=1/2.

**Case 1: j = 3/2**
*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is *j*(*j*+1)ħ² = (3/2)(3/2+1)ħ² = (15/4)ħ².
*   The possible values for *m_j* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are $m_j$ħ, which are (-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ.

**Case 2: j = 1/2**
*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is *j*(*j*+1)ħ² = (1/2)(1/2+1)ħ² = (3/4)ħ².
*   The possible values for *m_j* are -1/2, 1/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are $m_j$ħ, which are (-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ.
