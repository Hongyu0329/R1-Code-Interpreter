    "It is not possible to determine the exact number of \"pas de Balanchines\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo from the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\"\n\nThere are several reasons for this:\n\n*   **Lack of Available Footage:** Despite extensive searching, no video of Svetlana Gileva performing this specific solo from the 2015 production is publicly available for analysis. While the Semperoper Ballett has a YouTube channel with a video of the \"Jete Woman solo,\" the dancer is not identified, and it cannot be confirmed that it is from a 2015 performance featuring Ms. Gileva.\n*   **\"Pas de Balanchine\" is Not a Standard Ballet Term:** The term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a recognized step within the formal vocabulary of ballet. It is likely a colloquialism used to describe a sequence that is reminiscent of George Balanchine's signature neoclassical style, which heavily influenced William Forsythe. Without a precise definition of what this term refers to within the context of this specific choreography, any count would be purely subjective.\n*   **Choreographic Interpretation:** The performance of a dance can vary slightly between dancers and even between different performances by the same dancer. Therefore, even if a video of another dancer performing the solo were available, it would not guarantee an accurate count for Ms. Gileva's performance.\n\nSvetlana Gileva was a member of the Semperoper Ballett and did perform in \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" during the 2015 season. However, without a visual record of her specific performance and a clear definition of the step in question, it is impossible to provide a factual answer.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to your question.>>>"
