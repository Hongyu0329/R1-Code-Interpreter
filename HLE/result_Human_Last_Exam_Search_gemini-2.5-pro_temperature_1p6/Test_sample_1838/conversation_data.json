    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1, 1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate the sequence of pixels that form the line.\n\n### Bresenham's Line Algorithm Steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the differences in x and y:**\n    *   Δx = x₂ - x₁ = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   Δy = y₂ - y₁ = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n2.  **Determine the decision parameter:**\n    Since Δx > Δy, the line is \"x-major,\" meaning we will always increment x by 1 in each step and decide whether to increment y.\n    The initial decision parameter `p` is calculated as:\n    p = 2 * Δy - Δx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\n3.  **Iterate and find all pixels:**\n    We start at the first point (1, 1). For each subsequent step, we increment x and update y based on the value of the decision parameter `p`.\n\n    The update rules are:\n    *   If p < 0, the next point is (x+1, y) and the new p is p + 2 * Δy.\n    *   If p ≥ 0, the next point is (x+1, y+1) and the new p is p + 2 * Δy - 2 * Δx.\n\n    Let's trace the algorithm:\n    *   **Pixel 1:** (1, 1). Initial p = -2.\n    *   **Pixel 2:** p < 0. The next pixel is (2, 1). New p = -2 + (2 * 4) = 6.\n    *   **Pixel 3:** p ≥ 0. The next pixel is (3, 2). New p = 6 + (2 * 4) - (2 * 10) = -6.\n    *   **Pixel 4:** p < 0. The next pixel is (4, 2). New p = -6 + (2 * 4) = 2.\n    *   **Pixel 5:** p ≥ 0. The next pixel is (5, 3). New p = 2 + (2 * 4) - (2 * 10) = -10.\n    *   **Pixel 6:** p < 0. The next pixel is (6, 3). New p = -10 + (2 * 4) = -2.\n    *   **Pixel 7:** p < 0. The next pixel is (7, 3). New p = -2 + (2 * 4) = 6.\n    *   **Pixel 8:** p ≥ 0. The next pixel is (8, 4). New p = 6 + (2 * 4) - (2 * 10) = -6.\n    *   **Pixel 9:** p < 0. The next pixel is (9, 4). New p = -6 + (2 * 4) = 2.\n    *   **Pixel 10:** p ≥ 0. The next pixel is (10, 5). New p = 2 + (2 * 4) - (2 * 10) = -10.\n    *   **Pixel 11:** p < 0. The next pixel is (11, 5).\n\n### The Complete Sequence of Pixels:\n1.  (1, 1)\n2.  (2, 1)\n3.  (3, 2)\n4.  (4, 2)\n5.  (5, 3)\n6.  **(6, 3)**\n7.  (7, 3)\n8.  (8, 4)\n9.  (9, 4)\n10. (10, 5)\n11. (11, 5)\n\nThe total number of pixels in the line is 11. The central pixel is the 6th pixel in this sequence.\n\nThe coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
