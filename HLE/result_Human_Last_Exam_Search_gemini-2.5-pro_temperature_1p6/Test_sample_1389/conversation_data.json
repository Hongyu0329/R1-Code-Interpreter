    "To determine whether `1 - incidence rate ratio` accurately estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine, it's important to understand the underlying mechanics of this type of vaccine.\n\n### All-or-Nothing vs. Leaky Vaccines\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms:\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine confers complete protection to a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals, while the remaining individuals receive no protection at all. The protected group is fully immune, and the unprotected group is as susceptible to infection as unvaccinated individuals.\n*   **Leaky Vaccine:** This model assumes that the vaccine provides partial protection to all vaccinated individuals. It reduces the probability of infection for every exposure but doesn't provide complete immunity to anyone.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate (new cases over a period of time) in the vaccinated group to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n*   **Vaccine Efficacy (VE):** Commonly calculated as `1 - IRR`, this represents the percentage reduction in disease incidence in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated one.\n*   **Per-Exposure Efficacy:** This measures the reduction in the risk of infection from a single exposure to the pathogen.\n\n### Analyzing the All-or-Nothing Model\n\nIn an all-or-nothing vaccine model, the vaccine efficacy measured in a trial is equivalent to the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected. Let's denote this proportion as 'α'.\n\n*   The remaining portion of the vaccinated population, `1 - α`, is not protected and has the same susceptibility as the unvaccinated group.\n*   The incidence rate in the vaccinated group is therefore the rate of infection in this unprotected subgroup, which is `(1 - α)` multiplied by the incidence rate of the unvaccinated group (`IR_unvaccinated`).\n*   So, `IR_vaccinated = (1 - α) * IR_unvaccinated`.\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):\n\nIRR = `IR_vaccinated / IR_unvaccinated` = `[(1 - α) * IR_unvaccinated] / IR_unvaccinated` = `1 - α`\n\nThe standard calculation for vaccine efficacy (VE) is `1 - IRR`. Substituting our result for IRR:\n\nVE = `1 - (1 - α)` = `α`\n\nThis shows that the vaccine efficacy measured by `1 - IRR` is exactly `α`, the proportion of individuals who are fully protected.\n\n### Relating to Per-Exposure Efficacy\n\nNow, we consider the per-exposure efficacy in this \"all-or-nothing\" context.\n*   For the proportion `α` of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected, their risk of infection per exposure is zero. Their per-exposure efficacy is 100%.\n*   For the proportion `1 - α` of vaccinated individuals who are not protected, their risk of infection per exposure is the same as an unvaccinated person. Their per-exposure efficacy is 0%.\n\nThe average per-exposure efficacy across the entire vaccinated group is a weighted average of these two outcomes:\n\nAverage Per-Exposure Efficacy = `(α * 100%) + ((1 - α) * 0%)` = `α * 100%`, or simply `α`.\n\nSince both the vaccine efficacy calculated as `1 - IRR` and the per-exposure vaccine efficacy are equal to `α`, the `1 - incidence rate ratio` **correctly estimates** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n<<<C>>>"
