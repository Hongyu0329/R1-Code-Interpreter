    "The rank of the complementary channel of a quantum channel $\\Lambda$ is determined by the number of linearly independent Kraus operators required to describe $\\Lambda$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) is defined by its action on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k \\sigma_k \\rho \\sigma_k^\\dagger$\nwhere:\n*   $\\sigma_k$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) for a $d$-dimensional system. These operators form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n*   $p_k$ are probabilities, satisfying $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$.\n\nThe Kraus operators for this channel are given by $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} \\sigma_k$. The number of Kraus operators is the number of non-zero coefficients $p_k$.\n\nThe complementary channel, denoted $\\Lambda^c$, describes the information that leaks to the environment during the channel's operation. The rank of the complementary channel is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix $G$ constructed from the channel's Kraus operators. The elements of this matrix are given by $G_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(K_i^\\dagger K_j)$.\n\nFor a Pauli channel, the Gram matrix elements are:\n$G_{kl} = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_k} \\sigma_k)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_l} \\sigma_l)) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(\\sigma_k^\\dagger \\sigma_l)$\n\nA key property of the generalized Pauli operators is their orthogonality with respect to the trace inner product:\n$\\text{Tr}(\\sigma_k^\\dagger \\sigma_l) = d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}$\nwhere $\\delta_{kl}$ is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if $k=l$ and 0 otherwise.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the Gram matrix elements, we get:\n$G_{kl} = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}) = d \\cdot p_k \\cdot \\delta_{kl}$\n\nThis means the Gram matrix $G$ is a diagonal matrix with the values $d \\cdot p_k$ along its diagonal. The rank of a diagonal matrix is simply the number of its non-zero entries. The rank of $G$, and therefore the rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$, is the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$.\n\nTo find the maximal rank, we need to consider a Pauli channel where the number of non-zero probabilities is maximized. Since there are $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, we can define a channel where all $d^2$ probabilities $p_k$ are non-zero. For example, the qudit depolarizing channel is a type of Pauli channel where $p_0 = 1 - p$ and $p_k = p/(d^2-1)$ for $k=1, ..., d^2-1$. If $0 < p < 1$, all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$ is $d^2$. This leads to a maximal rank of $d^2$ for the complementary channel.\n\n<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$.>>>"
