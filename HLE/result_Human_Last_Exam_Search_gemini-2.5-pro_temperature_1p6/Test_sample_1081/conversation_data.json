    "The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group, $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ was determined by R. W. Carter in his 1972 paper \"Conjugacy classes in the Weyl group\". The number of these conjugacy classes is 112. This classification is a foundational result in the theory of exceptional groups.\n\nTherefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
