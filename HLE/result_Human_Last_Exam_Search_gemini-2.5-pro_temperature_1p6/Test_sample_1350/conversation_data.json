    "While no character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* is explicitly described as visiting a Roman city and detailing its religious practices with a clear and direct reference to the tale of Romulus and Remus, there is a character whose backstory involves being enslaved by the Romans. This character, a \"man of the Gael,\" recounts his experiences in a Roman settlement, which the Wolfings refer to as a \"garth.\"\n\nIn Chapter VI, \"They Talk on the Way to the Folk-thing,\" a Wolfing warrior mentions a conversation with this man of the Gael who was captured in battle by the Romans and lived as a thrall in one of their cities before escaping. The Wolfing recounts that the man of the Gael \"learned of their customs: and sore was the lesson!\" However, the narrative does not provide a detailed account from the man of the Gael himself about what he observed of Roman religious life, nor does it contain any specific allusions to the founding myth of Rome.\n\nThe novel focuses primarily on the culture, beliefs, and struggles of the Gothic Wolfing clan, who themselves have a strong connection to the wolf as their totem, bearing its image on their banners and as a mark on their warriors' bodies. The primary conflict of the story is the Wolfings' defense of their homeland against the invading Roman legions.\n\nLiterary analysis suggests that Morris, who was deeply influenced by both Norse sagas and classical literature, may have intended a subtle irony in the Romans, founders of a city famously associated with a she-wolf, coming into conflict with a tribe that reveres the wolf. One critical interpretation posits that the Roman's imperialistic actions represent an appropriation of the Wolfings' totemic emblem, which could be seen as a veiled reference to the Romulus and Remus myth. This, however, remains a matter of scholarly interpretation rather than an explicit event or description within the novel itself.\n\nTherefore, while the theme of Romans and their interaction with a wolf-affiliated people is central to the book, there is no character who directly recounts Roman religious practices in a way that would be recognizable to readers as the story of Romulus and Remus.\n\n<<<A thrall, a \"man of the Gael,\" is mentioned to have been enslaved in a Roman city and learned of their customs, but the novel does not detail his account of their religious practices or make a recognizable reference to Romulus and Remus.>>>"
