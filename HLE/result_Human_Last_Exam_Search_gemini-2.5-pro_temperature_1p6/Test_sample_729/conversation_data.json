    "A power subgroup is a subgroup that is generated by a single element; in other words, it is a cyclic subgroup. To determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, we first need to understand its structure and elements.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q_128 can be defined by the presentation:\nQ_128 = ⟨a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹⟩\n\nThe elements of Q_128 are of two forms:\n1.  Elements of the form `a^i`, where `i` ranges from 0 to 63. These elements form a cyclic subgroup ⟨a⟩ of order 64.\n2.  Elements of the form `a^i * x`, where `i` also ranges from 0 to 63.\n\nWe can now find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups by considering the subgroups generated by each type of element.\n\n### 1. Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form a^i\nThese are the subgroups of the cyclic group ⟨a⟩ of order 64. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order *n* is equal to the number of divisors of *n*, denoted as τ(*n*). For the subgroup ⟨a⟩ of order 64, we have:\nτ(64) = τ(2⁶) = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nThese 7 subgroups are generated by the elements `a^d` where `d` is a divisor of 64 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64). They correspond to the cyclic subgroups of orders 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1.\n\n### 2. Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form a^i*x\nFirst, we determine the order of these elements. For any element `g = a^i * x`:\ng² = (a^i * x) * (a^i * x) = a^i * (x * a^i * x⁻¹) * x² = a^i * (a⁻ⁱ) * x² = x² = a³²\ng⁴ = (a³²)² = a⁶⁴ = 1\n\nThus, every element of the form `a^i * x` has an order of 4. Each of these 64 elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4. Now, we must count how many of these subgroups are distinct.\n\nLet's examine the subgroup generated by `a^i * x`:\n⟨a^i * x⟩ = {1, a^i * x, (a^i * x)², (a^i * x)³} = {1, a^i * x, a³², a³² * a^i * x} = {1, a^i * x, a³², a^(i+32) * x}\n\nTwo such subgroups, ⟨a^i * x⟩ and ⟨a^j * x⟩, are identical if and only if their sets of generating elements are the same. This means that `a^j * x` must be either `a^i * x` or `a^(i+32) * x`. This implies that `j` is congruent to `i` or `i+32` modulo 64.\n\nSince each such cyclic subgroup contains exactly two elements of the form `a^k * x`, the 64 elements of this form generate 64 / 2 = 32 distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThese 32 subgroups are distinct from the cyclic subgroups of ⟨a⟩ (except for the trivial subgroup, which is of order 1, while these are of order 4). Specifically, the only cyclic subgroup of order 4 within ⟨a⟩ is ⟨a¹⁶⟩ = {1, a¹⁶, a³², a⁴⁸}. The subgroups generated by `a^i*x` contain elements not in ⟨a⟩, so they are a distinct set of subgroups.\n\n### Total Number of Power Subgroups\n\nThe total number of power (cyclic) subgroups is the sum of the number of cyclic subgroups from both cases:\n*   7 cyclic subgroups from within ⟨a⟩.\n*   32 distinct cyclic subgroups generated by the elements of the form `a^i * x`.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
