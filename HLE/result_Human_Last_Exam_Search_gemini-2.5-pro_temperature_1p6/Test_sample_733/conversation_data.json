    "There are exactly **11** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for any elements *x, y* in *S* (including the case *x* = *y*), their product *xy* is not in *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (also referred to as locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was completed by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their 2009 paper, \"Small maximal sum-free sets\". The term \"sum-free\" is typically used for abelian groups, while \"product-free\" is used for the general, non-abelian case. Their work provides a complete list of these groups.\n\nThe 11 finite groups are:\n1.  **C₅**: The cyclic group of order 5.\n2.  **C₆**: The cyclic group of order 6.\n3.  **C₇**: The cyclic group of order 7.\n4.  **C₈**: The cyclic group of order 8.\n5.  **C₉**: The cyclic group of order 9.\n6.  **C₁₀**: The cyclic group of order 10.\n7.  **C₁₂**: The cyclic group of order 12.\n8.  **C₂ × C₂**: The elementary abelian group of order 4 (the Klein four-group).\n9.  **D₆**: The dihedral group of order 6 (isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃).\n10. **Q₁₂**: The dicyclic group of order 12.\n11. A non-abelian group of order 18, specifically the semidirect product (C₃ × C₃) ⋊ C₂.\n\nThis complete classification arises from considering all possible structures for the subgroup generated by the maximal product-free set of size 2. While some of these groups can contain more than one distinct maximal product-free set of size 2, the total number of distinct isomorphism classes of the groups themselves is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
