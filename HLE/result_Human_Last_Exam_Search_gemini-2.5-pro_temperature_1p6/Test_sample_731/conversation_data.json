    "A \"power subgroup\" is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of order 512, `SD_512`, we need to count its distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe semidihedral group `SD_{2^n}` is defined by the presentation:\n`G = <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2)-1)>`\n\nFor `SD_512`, we have `2^n = 512`, so `n=9`. The group presentation is:\n`G = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^127>`\n\nThe cyclic subgroups of `SD_512` can be divided into two categories: those contained within the cyclic subgroup `<r>`, and those that are not.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups within `<r>`:**\n    The subgroup `<r>` is a cyclic group of order 256. The number of distinct subgroups of a cyclic group of order `m` is equal to the number of divisors of `m`. For the order `m = 256 = 2^8`, the number of divisors is `8 + 1 = 9`. These subgroups are generated by powers of `r` and have orders 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements outside of `<r>`:**\n    These subgroups are generated by elements of the form `sr^i`, where `0 <= i < 256`. We must determine the order of these elements.\n    *   **Case 1: `i` is an even number.**\n        There are 128 even numbers for `i` (0, 2, 4, ..., 254). For any of these values, the element `sr^i` has an order of 2. Each of these 128 elements generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2. These are different from the single subgroup of order 2 found in `<r>` (which is `<r^128>`). Thus, this case contributes 128 cyclic subgroups.\n\n    *   **Case 2: `i` is an odd number.**\n        There are 128 odd numbers for `i` (1, 3, 5, ..., 255). For any of these values, the element `sr^i` has an order of 4. The cyclic subgroups generated by these elements are of the form `{e, sr^i, r^128, sr^(i+128)}`.\n        A subgroup generated by `sr^i` is identical to the one generated by `sr^j` if `j` is congruent to `i` or `i+128` modulo 256. This means the 128 elements of order 4 form `128 / 2 = 64` distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4. These are different from the cyclic subgroup of order 4 within `<r>` (which is `<r^64>`). This case contributes 64 cyclic subgroups.\n\nA paper on the number of cyclic subgroups in 2-groups of maximal class provides a formula for the number of cyclic subgroups `c(G)` in a semidihedral group `SD_{2^n}` as `c(SD_{2^n}) = 3 * 2^(n-3) + n`. For `SD_512`, `n=9`. Applying this formula gives:\n`c(SD_512) = 3 * 2^(9-3) + 9 = 3 * 2^6 + 9 = 3 * 64 + 9 = 192 + 9 = 201`.\n\nThis result matches the detailed breakdown:\nTotal number of power subgroups = (Subgroups from `<r>`) + (Subgroups from `sr^i` with `i` even) + (Subgroups from `sr^i` with `i` odd)\nTotal = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201.\n\nTherefore, there are 201 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<201>>>"
