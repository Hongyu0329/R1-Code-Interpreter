    "Based on phonological rules and comparative reconstruction, the Proto-Indo-European verb **`*seh2gieti`**, meaning '(s)he’s giving a sign', evolves as follows into Proto-Germanic and its descendant languages. The reconstruction is supported by cognates like Hittite `sākizzi` (\"gives a sign, an omen\") and Latin `sāgīre` (\"to be keen-nosed, perceive keenly\").\n\nHere is the line of development:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic: `*sōkīþi`**\n    The transformation from PIE to Proto-Germanic involves several key sound changes. The PIE root `*seh2g-` becomes Proto-Germanic `*sōk-`. The laryngeal `*h2` \"colors\" the preceding `*e` vowel to an `*a` vowel, which then becomes a long `*ō` in Proto-Germanic in this position. Grimm's Law dictates that the voiced stop `*g` becomes the voiceless stop `*k`. The PIE third-person singular present indicative ending `*-eti` becomes `*-iþi` for this class of weak verbs. The resulting Proto-Germanic form is reconstructed as `*sōkīþi`, meaning '(s)he seeks'.\n\n*   **Old Norse: `sœkir`**\n    In the transition from Proto-Germanic to Old Norse, the long vowel `*ō` in the root `*sōk-` undergoes i-mutation (or i-umlaut) due to the following `*i` in the ending. This fronts and rounds the vowel, changing it to `œ`. The Proto-Germanic ending `*-iþi` evolves into `-ir` for the third-person singular present indicative in Old Norse. Thus, the word becomes `sœkir`.\n\n*   **Old English: `sēċþ`**\n    From Proto-Germanic `*sōkīþi`, the verb in Old English shows the effects of i-mutation. The high front vowel `*i` in the ending causes the root vowel `*ō` to front, resulting in `ē`. The `k` sound, now preceding a front vowel (`ē`), is palatalized to a `ċ` sound (pronounced like \"ch\" in \"church\"). The ending `*-iþi` reduces to `-þ`. This yields the Old English form `sēċþ` (also written `sēcth`). The infinitive form is `sēcan`.\n\n*   **Old High German: `suochit`** (or `suohit`)\n    In Old High German, the Proto-Germanic long vowel `*ō` characteristically breaks into the diphthong `uo`. Therefore, the stem becomes `suoh-`. The third-person singular present indicative ending `*-iþi` becomes `-it`. The `i` in this ending triggers i-umlaut on the preceding diphthong, changing `uo` to `üe` in many contexts, which gives the form `süechit`. However, `suochit` is the attested form. The High German consonant shift does not affect the `*k` in this word because it does not occur at the end of a word or before a vowel where the shift would apply.\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic**: `*sōkīþi`\n**Old Norse**: `sœkir`\n**Old English**: `sēċþ`\n**Old High German**: `suochit`>>>"
