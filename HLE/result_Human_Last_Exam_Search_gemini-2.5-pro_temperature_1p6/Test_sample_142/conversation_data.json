    "To determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set, we must first determine the number of electrons (N) and the number of basis functions (orbitals, K) for this system.\n\n### 1. Molecular Formula and Number of Electrons (N)\n\nThe molecular formula $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ implies a molecule containing one carbon atom, three hydrogen atoms (two attached to the carbon and one elsewhere, likely to silicon), one silicon atom, and one fluorine atom. A plausible stable, neutral molecule with this composition is methylsilanediylfluoride, but for the purpose of counting electrons and basis functions, only the atomic composition matters.\n\nThe number of electrons for each neutral atom is:\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons (N) in the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{SiF}$:\nN = (1 × 6) + (3 × 1) + (1 × 14) + (1 × 9) = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = **32 electrons**.\n\nFor a closed-shell singlet ground state (total spin S=0), the number of alpha-spin electrons ($N_\\alpha$) equals the number of beta-spin electrons ($N_\\beta$), so $N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N/2 = 16$.\n\n### 2. Basis Set and Number of Basis Functions (K)\n\nThe 6-31G** basis set (also known as 6-31G(d,p)) specifies the number of atomic orbitals used for each atom. The `**` notation indicates the addition of d-type polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe number of basis functions for each atom is as follows:\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: The 6-31G basis provides 2s functions. The `**` adds one set of p-functions (p_x, p_y, p_z). Total for one H: 2 (s) + 3 (p) = 5 basis functions.\n*   **Carbon (C)**: As a second-row atom, the 6-31G basis provides 9 functions (3s, 2p). The `**` adds one set of d-functions. Using the standard 6 Cartesian d-functions, the total for C is 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n*   **Fluorine (F)**: As another second-row atom, the count is the same as for Carbon. Total for F: 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n*   **Silicon (Si)**: As a third-row atom, the 6-31G basis provides 13 functions (4s, 3p). The `**` adds one set of d-functions. Total for Si: 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\nTotal number of basis functions (K) for $\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{SiF}$:\nK = (1 × K_C) + (3 × K_H) + (1 × K_Si) + (1 × K_F)\nK = 15 + (3 × 5) + 19 + 15\nK = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = **64 basis functions**.\n\n### 3. Formula for the Number of CSFs\n\nA full CI calculation involves considering all possible ways to distribute the N electrons among the K orbitals. For a system with K spatial orbitals and N electrons, the number of singlet (S=0) configuration state functions is given by the following formula:\n\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2 - 1} \\binom{K}{N/2 + 1}$\n\nwhere $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n\n### 4. Calculation\n\nWe have:\n*   K = 64\n*   N = 32\n*   N/2 = 16\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15} \\binom{64}{17}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the required binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{64}{15}$ = 15,470,155,455,323,200\n*   $\\binom{64}{16}$ = 47,377,363,456,816,000\n*   $\\binom{64}{17}$ = 1,339,836,170,614,144,000\n\nNow, we perform the final calculation:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16}^2 = (47,377,363,456,816,000)^2 \\approx 2.24461 \\times 10^{33}$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} \\times \\binom{64}{17} = 15,470,155,455,323,200 \\times 1,339,836,170,614,144,000 \\approx 2.07279 \\times 10^{33}$\n\n$N_{CSF} = (47,377,363,456,816,000)^2 - (15,470,155,455,323,200 \\times 1,339,836,170,614,144,000)$\n$N_{CSF} = 2,244,610,148,633,433,388,014,592,000,000 - 2,072,793,774,640,165,780,520,960,000,000$\n$N_{CSF} = 171,816,373,993,267,607,493,632,000,000$\n\nThis number is astronomically large, which is expected for a full CI calculation on a molecule with this many electrons and basis functions. Such a calculation is not computationally feasible with current technology, but the number of CSFs can be calculated theoretically.\n\nThe number of CSFs in a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set is 171,816,373,993,267,607,493,632,000,000.\n\n<<<17181637399326760749363200000>>>"
