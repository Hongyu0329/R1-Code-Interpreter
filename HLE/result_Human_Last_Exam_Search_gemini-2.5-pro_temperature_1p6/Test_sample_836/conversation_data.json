    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, often denoted as G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that a reference particle was at the origin at time t=0. This function provides information about the spatial arrangement and temporal evolution of particles in a system. Its development is significantly attributed to Léon Van Hove, and it is sometimes referred to as the Van Hove correlation function.\n\nWhen a double Fourier transform is applied to this function—one transform over space (**r**) and another over time (**t**)—the resulting function is the dynamic structure factor, S(q, ω). Here, **q** represents the momentum transfer (the Fourier variable conjugate to space) and **ω** represents the energy transfer (the Fourier variable conjugate to time).\n\nIn the context of nuclear criticality, the dynamic structure factor is a crucial quantity. It is directly related to the double-differential scattering cross-section, which is measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. This data is essential for accurately modeling the thermal scattering of neutrons in materials used in nuclear reactors, such as light and heavy water, which is critical for criticality safety analyses. In this field, the dynamic structure factor is also referred to as the scattering law, often denoted S(α, β), which are dimensionless variables for momentum and energy transfer, respectively.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
