    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C$ defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ over the prime 2, with the valuation $v$ normalized to $v(2)=1$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the equation modulo 2. The reduction of the equation is $z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, which is $(z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. This shows the special fiber of this model is a double line, which indicates bad reduction.\n\nTo find a better model, we can perform a change of variables. Let $z = 1 + 2w$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$(1+2w)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$1 + 4w + 4w^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n$4w^2 + 4w = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\nDividing by 2, we obtain a new model for the curve:\n$2w^2 + 2w = x^5 + x^3$\nThis can be written as $2w(w+1) = x^3(x^2+1)$. Let's call this model $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nThe special fiber of this model $\\mathcal{C}$ over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is obtained by reducing the equation modulo 2:\n$0 = x^5 + x^3 = x^3(x^2+1) = x^3(x+1)^2 \\pmod 2$.\nThe special fiber consists of two components: the line $V_0$ defined by $x=0$ (with multiplicity 3) and the line $V_1$ defined by $x=1$ (with multiplicity 2).\n\nIn the affine $(x,w)$-plane, these two lines are parallel and do not intersect. To find the intersection points, we need to look in the projective plane. Let's homogenize the equation of the model $\\mathcal{C}$ using variables $(X:W:Z)$, where $x=X/Z$ and $w=W/Z$.\n$2(W/Z)(W/Z+1) = (X/Z)^3((X/Z)^2+1)$\nMultiplying by $Z^5$ gives:\n$2W(W+Z)Z^3 = X^3(X^2+Z^2)$.\nThe affine plane corresponds to $Z \\neq 0$. The line at infinity is $Z=0$.\nTo find the intersection of the components at infinity, we set $Z=0$ in the equation:\n$0 = X^3(X^2) = X^5$.\nThis implies $X=0$. So the components intersect at the point $(X:W:Z) = (0:1:0)$.\n\nThis intersection point is a singular point of the special fiber, which corresponds to a double point (a node) in the stable reduction. We need to determine the thickness of this node.\nThe component $V_0$ is given by $X=0$.\nThe component $V_1$ is given by $X=Z$ (since $x=1 \\implies X/Z=1$).\nThe two components of the special fiber meet at $(0:1:0)$. Let's analyze the model in the affine chart around this point, which we can take to be the chart $W=1$.\nLet $x' = X/W = x/w$ and $z' = Z/W = 1/w$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$2(1+z') (z')^3 = (x')^3((x')^2+(z')^2)$.\nThe intersection point in this chart is $(x', z') = (0,0)$.\nThe equation for the special fiber is $0=(x')^3((x')^2+(z')^2) = (x')^5 + (x')^3(z')^2$. This is not quite right.\n\nLet's return to the model $2w(w+1) = x^3(x^2+1)$.\nThe stable reduction is formed by two rational curves (the normalization of the components $x=0$ and $x=1$) intersecting at one point (the node at infinity). The equation itself provides the parameter of the node.\nThe equation can be written as $w^2+w = \\frac{1}{2}x^3(x^2+1)$.\nThis is an equation of the form $f(w) = t \\cdot g(x)$, where $t=1/2$ and $v(t)=-1$. This is not how thickness is defined.\n\nLet's look at the structure $A \\cdot B = \\pi^d C$, where $A, B, C$ are polynomials in the coordinates with unit coefficients, and $\\pi$ is the uniformizer ($2$ in our case). The thickness of the node created is $d$.\nLet's consider the intersection point of the components $x=0$ and $x=1$ at infinity.\nLet the coordinate ring be $R = \\mathbb{Z}_2[[x_0, x_1]]$. The equation is $2(1+x_0)x_0^3=x_1^3(x_1^2+x_0^2)$.\nThis can be written as $x_1^3(x_1-x_0)(x_1+x_0) = 2(\\dots)$. The equation modulo 2 is $x_1^3(x_1^2+x_0^2)=0$. No, it's $x_1^5=0$ and $(x_1-x_0)^2=0$. This is getting confusing.\n\nA more direct method is using the valuations of the roots of the polynomial $h(y) = y(y^5+2y^2+2)$, which is obtained by setting $x=1/y$ and $w=z y^3$ in the original equation, giving $w^2=h(y)$.\nThe roots of $y^5+2y^2+2=0$ all have valuation $1/5$. The other root of $h(y)$ is $0$.\nLet the roots of $h(y)$ be $\\beta_0=0$ and $\\beta_{1,...,5}$ with $v(\\beta_i)=1/5$.\nLet's analyze the distances $v(\\beta_i-\\beta_j)$.\n$v(\\beta_i - 0) = v(\\beta_i) = 1/5$.\nTo compute $v(\\beta_i-\\beta_j)$ for $i,j \\neq 0$, let $\\beta_i = 2^{1/5} u_i$. The $u_i$ are roots of $u^5 + 2^{2/5} u^2 + 1 = 0$. The reduction of this equation modulo $2^{1/5}$ is $u^5+1=0$. In characteristic 2, this factors into $(u+1)(u^4+u^3+u^2+u+1)=0$. The roots $\\bar{u}_i$ are distinct in $\\mathbb{F}_{16}$ (the splitting field of $u^4+u^3+u^2+u+1$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$).\nSince the residues are distinct, $v(u_i-u_j)=0$ for $i \\ne j$.\nTherefore, $v(\\beta_i-\\beta_j) = v(2^{1/5}(u_i-u_j)) = 1/5$.\nAll pairwise distances between roots have valuation $1/5$.\nThis structure, where all the branch points of the hyperelliptic curve are in a single cluster, leads to a specific type of stable reduction. The stable model of the curve $w^2=h(y)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ consists of a single irreducible component of genus 1, with one node.\nThe genus of the original curve is $g=2$. The genus of the single component of the stable fiber is $g_1=1$.\nFor a stable reduction consisting of a single component of genus $g_1$ with $\\delta$ nodes, the arithmetic genus is $g = g_1 + \\delta$.\nHere, $2 = 1 + \\delta$, so there is $\\delta=1$ node.\nThe thickness of this node is given by the formula relating the valuation of the discriminant to the geometry of the stable fiber. In this case of potentially good reduction (it becomes good over $\\mathbb{Q}_2(2^{1/5}, \\sqrt{2})$), the thickness of the acquired node is given by the ramification index of the minimal extension over which the curve obtains good reduction.\nThe equation $W^2 = 2H(Y)$ showed that good reduction is achieved over the field extension that contains $\\sqrt{2}$. The base field contains $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The extension is $\\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a ramified extension of degree 2. The valuation of the uniformizer $\\sqrt{2}$ is $v(\\sqrt{2})=1/2$.\nThis leads to the expectation that the thickness might be related to this extension. For potentially good reduction, the thickness of the node is often the integer 1.\n\nA known result states that for a hyperelliptic curve whose branch points form a single cluster, the stable model consists of one or two components. If the number of branch points (6 in our case) is even, it consists of a single component of genus 1 with one node. The thickness of this node is 1.\n\n"
