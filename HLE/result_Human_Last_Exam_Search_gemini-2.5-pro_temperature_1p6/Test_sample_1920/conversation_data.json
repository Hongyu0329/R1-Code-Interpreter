    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factorize the conductor $d$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $d = 53599$.\nBased on search results, the prime factorization of 53599 is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nLet $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n### 2. Understand primitive characters for a composite conductor\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product of primitive characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo the prime factor $p_i$. The conductor of such a $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of the $\\chi_i$, which in this case is $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$. We require this order to be 6.\n\n### 3. Count primitive characters for prime moduli\nFor a prime modulus $p$, the group of Dirichlet characters is cyclic, with order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of primitive characters modulo $p$ of a given order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k$ divides $p-1$, and 0 otherwise. This is because all non-trivial characters modulo a prime are primitive.\n\nLet $N(p, k)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p$ of order $k$.\n-   For $p_1=7$, $p_1-1=6$. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    -   $N(7,1) = \\phi(1) = 1$\n    -   $N(7,2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    -   $N(7,3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    -   $N(7,6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n-   For $p_2=13$, $p_2-1=12$. The divisors of 12 that are also divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    -   $N(13,1) = \\phi(1) = 1$\n    -   $N(13,2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    -   $N(13,3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    -   $N(13,6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n-   For $p_3=19$, $p_3-1=18$. The divisors of 18 that are also divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    -   $N(19,1) = \\phi(1) = 1$\n    -   $N(19,2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    -   $N(19,3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    -   $N(19,6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n-   For $p_4=31$, $p_4-1=30$. The divisors of 30 that are also divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    -   $N(31,1) = \\phi(1) = 1$\n    -   $N(31,2) = \\phi(2) = 1$\n    -   $N(31,3) = \\phi(3) = 2$\n    -   $N(31,6) = \\phi(6) = 2$\n\n### 4. Combine the counts\nLet the orders of the four primitive characters be $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$, where $o_i$ is the order of $\\chi_i$. We need to find the number of such tuples where $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$. This means that:\n1.  All orders $o_i$ must be divisors of 6 (i.e., from the set {1, 2, 3, 6}).\n2.  At least one order must be divisible by 2.\n3.  At least one order must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all possible tuples of characters where each $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ divides 6. Let $A_2$ be the subset where no order is divisible by 2 (all orders are 1 or 3). Let $A_3$ be the subset where no order is divisible by 3 (all orders are 1 or 2).\n\nThe number of characters for each modulus whose order divides 6 is $N(p,1)+N(p,2)+N(p,3)+N(p,6) = 1+1+2+2=6$. Since we have four prime factors, the total number of tuples in $S$ is $6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 1296$.\n\nThe number of characters for each modulus whose order divides 3 (and not 2 or 6) is $N(p,1)+N(p,3) = 1+2=3$. So, the size of $A_2$ is $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 81$.\n\nThe number of characters for each modulus whose order divides 2 (and not 3 or 6) is $N(p,1)+N(p,2) = 1+1=2$. So, the size of $A_3$ is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\nThe set $A_2 \\cap A_3$ contains tuples where all orders divide both 2 and 3, which means all orders must be 1. There is only one character of order 1 for each modulus, so $|A_2 \\cap A_3| = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nUsing the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the number of characters of order 6 is:\n$|S| - |A_2| - |A_3| + |A_2 \\cap A_3| = 1296 - 81 - 16 + 1 = 1200$.\n\n"
