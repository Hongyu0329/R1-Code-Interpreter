The optimal feedback adjustment factor is given by \(b = -\alpha P_1\). This must satisfy the constraint \(b^2 \leq P_2\), which means the power of the message signal \(X_2\) must be non-negative. If \((-\alpha P_1)^2 > P_2\), the optimal \(b\) would be the closest value to \(-\alpha P_1\) that satisfies the constraint, which is \(b = -\text{sign}(\alpha P_1) \sqrt{P_2}\). Assuming the power allocation allows for it, the optimal factor is directly proportional to the negative of the noise correlation \(\alpha\) and the power of the first transmission \(P_1\).
