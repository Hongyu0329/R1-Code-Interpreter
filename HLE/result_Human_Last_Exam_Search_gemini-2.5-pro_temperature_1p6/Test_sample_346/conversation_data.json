    "The problem asks for the value of `log_2(n)` where `n` is a Church integer represented by a complex SKI combinator expression. To solve this, the expression must be reduced and interpreted according to the rules of SKI calculus and Church encoding.\n\n### 1. Decoding the Combinators\nThe given expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`.\n\nLet's identify the key components:\n*   **Successor function (`succ`)**: The expression for taking a Church numeral `n` and producing `n+1` is `S(S(KS)K)`. In the given expression, we see `S(S(K(S))(K))`, which is an equivalent representation of the successor function.\n*   **Church Numeral for 1 (`c₁`)**: In many conventions, the Identity combinator `I` is used to represent the Church numeral for one.\n*   **Church Numeral for 2 (`c₂`)**: This can be derived by applying the successor function to `c₁`. So, `c₂ = succ(c₁) = succ(I)`. This matches the term `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` found inside the expression.\n*   **The term `S(I)(I)`**: This combinator represents self-application. When applied to a function `f` and an argument `x` (as Church numerals are), `(S(I)(I) f) x` reduces to `(f f) x`, which simplifies to `f(f(x))`. This is the definition of the Church numeral for two, `c₂`.\n\n### 2. Simplifying the Expression\nLet's substitute the identified parts back into the main expression.\nLet `A = succ(I) = c₂`.\nLet `B = succ(S(I)(I)) = succ(c₂) = c₃`.\n\nThe original expression is of the form `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))))(B)`.\n\nA key reduction rule is `S(X)(Y)(Z) ⇒ X(Z)(Y(Z))`. When `X` is `I`, this becomes `S(I)(Y)(Z) ⇒ I(Z)(Y(Z)) ⇒ Z(Y(Z))`.\n\nApplying this rule from the outside in:\n1.  Let the expression be `E`. `E = S(I)(Y₁)(B)` where `Y₁ = S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))`. This reduces to `E = B(Y₁(B))`.\n2.  Now evaluate `Y₁(B) = S(I)(Y₂)(B)` where `Y₂ = S(I)(K(A))`. This reduces to `Y₁(B) = B(Y₂(B))`.\n3.  Now evaluate `Y₂(B) = S(I)(K(A))(B)`. This reduces to `Y₂(B) = B((K(A))(B))`.\n4.  The combinator `K` is defined as `Kxy = x`. So, `K(A)(B) = A`.\n5.  Substituting back: `Y₂(B) = B(A)`.\n6.  Substituting back again: `Y₁(B) = B(B(A))`.\n7.  Substituting back a final time: `E = B(B(B(A)))`.\n\nSo, the Church numeral `n` is `c₃(c₃(c₃(c₂)))`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Value of n\nIn Church encoding, the application of one numeral `cₘ` to another `cₙ`, written as `cₘ(cₙ)`, corresponds to exponentiation, yielding the Church numeral for `nᵐ`.\n\nWe evaluate the expression `n = c₃(c₃(c₃(c₂)))` from the inside out:\n*   First, `c₃(c₂)` results in `c₂³`, which is the Church numeral for `2³ = 8`.\n*   Next, `c₃(c₈)` results in `c₈³`, which is the Church numeral for `8³ = 512`.\n*   Finally, `c₃(c₅₁₂)` results in `c₅₁₂³`, which is the Church numeral for `512³`.\n\nTherefore, `n = 512³`.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n*   `n = 512³`\n*   Since `512 = 2⁹`, we can write `n = (2⁹)³ = 2²⁷`.\n*   `log_2(n) = log_2(2²⁷) = 27`.\n\n<<<27>>>"
