    "The value of the integral is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the result:\n\nFirst, we simplify the integrand, which is an infinite series. The summation is given by:\n$$ S(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\nUsing the property of logarithms that the sum of logarithms is the logarithm of the product, we can write:\n$$ S(x) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\nThe infinite product $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}$ has a well-known closed-form expression. This can be derived using the half-angle identity for sine, $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$. The partial product is:\n$$ P_N = \\prod_{n=1}^{N}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} = \\cos\\frac{x}{2} \\cdot \\cos\\frac{x}{4} \\cdots \\cos\\frac{x}{2^N} $$\nMultiplying this by $\\sin\\frac{x}{2^N}$ and repeatedly applying the half-angle identity, we get:\n$$ P_N \\sin\\frac{x}{2^N} = \\frac{1}{2^N}\\sin(x) $$\nTherefore,\n$$ P_N = \\frac{\\sin x}{2^N \\sin(x/2^N)} $$\nAs $N \\to \\infty$, we have $2^N \\sin(x/2^N) \\to x$. Thus, the infinite product is:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} $$\nSo the integrand simplifies to:\n$$ S(x) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) $$\nThe integral we need to evaluate is therefore:\n$$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x $$\nFor the logarithm to be defined for real numbers, its argument must be positive. The term $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$ is positive for $x \\in (0, \\pi)$, but becomes negative in intervals such as $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$. To handle this, we interpret the integral over the real line by taking the logarithm of the absolute value of the argument. The identity for the sum of logarithms also holds for the absolute values:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left|\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right| = \\log\\left|\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right| = \\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right| $$\nSo the integral becomes:\n$$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right|\\mathrm{d}x $$\nThis is a known definite integral, often referred to as a Frullani integral or evaluated using other advanced techniques such as contour integration or differentiation under the integral sign. The value of this integral is a standard result in mathematical analysis.\n\nThe value of the integral is:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right|\\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\n\nA related and more commonly known integral is the Dirichlet integral, $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sin x}{x} dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. While the evaluation of $\\int_0^\\infty \\log|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}| dx$ is more involved, the result is well-established in integral tables and mathematical literature.\n\n<<<$-(\\pi/2)$>>>"
