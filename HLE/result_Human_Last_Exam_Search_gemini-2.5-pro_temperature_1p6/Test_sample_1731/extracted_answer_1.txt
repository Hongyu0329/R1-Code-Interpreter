The equilibrium values for the entropy (S) and mean energy (U) of a photon gas (the Bose case of light quanta) are found by identifying the most probable macroscopic state, which, according to large deviation theorems, is the one that minimizes the corresponding rate function. This minimization, subject to physical constraints, is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the system.

For a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T:
*   The **equilibrium mean energy** is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
    **U = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴**
*   The **equilibrium entropy** is:
    **S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³**

Here, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, h is Planck's constant, and c is the speed of light. These results are derived from the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons (with zero chemical potential), which represents the distribution that maximizes the statistical entropy of the system.
