    "### Equilibrium Properties of Photon Gas Derived from Large Deviation Theory\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas) can be understood through the lens of large deviation theory, specifically by applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a framework for understanding the probability of rare events and, in the context of statistical mechanics, identify the most probable macroscopic state—the equilibrium state—as the one that minimizes a particular \"rate function\". For a system at a given temperature, this minimization corresponds to the minimization of free energy.\n\n#### The Framework of Large Deviation Theory in Statistical Mechanics\n\nIn statistical mechanics, a macroscopic state (e.g., a specific distribution of energy among particles) corresponds to a vast number of microscopic configurations. The system is most likely to be observed in the macroscopic state that has the largest number of associated microscopic configurations. Large deviation theory formalizes this by quantifying the probability of observing a state different from the most probable one.\n\n**Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem is concerned with the probability that the empirical distribution of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables deviates from the true underlying probability distribution. The probability of observing an empirical measure that is not the true measure is exponentially small, and the rate of this decay is given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence). In the context of a gas of N particles, where we consider the distribution of particles across different energy levels, the probability of observing a particular distribution is related to its entropy. According to the principle of large deviations, the equilibrium distribution is the one that minimizes the rate function, which is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the system under given constraints.\n\n**Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem deals with the probability of the empirical mean of a set of i.i.d. random variables deviating from the expected value. The probability of such a \"large deviation\" also decays exponentially, with a rate determined by the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the cumulant generating function. This can be applied to the mean energy of the photon gas. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the large deviation function related to the internal energy of the system attains its minimum value.\n\n#### Application to the Photon Gas (Bose Case)\n\nA photon gas in equilibrium (such as black-body radiation) is a system of bosons. A key characteristic is that the number of photons is not conserved, as they can be absorbed and emitted by the walls of the container. This non-conservation of particle number leads to a crucial property at thermodynamic equilibrium: the chemical potential is zero.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Distribution and Entropy (Boltzmann-Sanov Perspective):**\n\nWe consider the photons distributed among a set of energy levels. According to the principles of large deviation theory as applied to statistical mechanics, the system will overwhelmingly be found in the configuration that maximizes the entropy, subject to the constraint of a fixed total average energy. For a Bose gas, this maximization procedure, which is equivalent to minimizing the large deviation rate function, leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution for the average number of photons in an energy state `ε`:\n\n<center>⟨n<sub>ε</sub>⟩ = 1 / (e<sup>βε</sup> - 1)</center>\n\nHere, `β = 1/(k_B T)`, where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant and `T` is the temperature. This is the celebrated Planck distribution for photons, a result that can be reproduced within the framework of large deviation theory.\n\nThe **equilibrium entropy** (S) of the photon gas is then calculated from this distribution. By integrating the entropy contribution from each energy level over the density of states, we arrive at the well-known Stefan-Boltzmann law dependence. The total entropy is given by:\n\n<center>S = (4/3) * b * V * T<sup>3</sup></center>\n\nwhere `V` is the volume and `b` is a constant related to fundamental physical constants (`b = 8π^5k_B^4 / (15h^3c^3)`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light). This state of maximum entropy corresponds to the most probable macroscopic state, consistent with the insights from the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem.\n\n**2. Mean Energy (Cramer-Chernoff Perspective):**\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem can be used to analyze the fluctuations of the total energy of the system. The theorem implies that the probability of the system having an average energy per particle that is different from the equilibrium value is exponentially small. The equilibrium state is the one for which the Cramer-Chernoff rate function, which governs these probabilities, is at its minimum.\n\nThe calculation of the **equilibrium mean energy** (U) proceeds by taking the average energy using the Bose-Einstein distribution derived above. The mean energy of a single mode of frequency `ν` is `hν / (e^(hν/k_BT) - 1)`. To find the total internal energy, one must integrate this quantity over all possible modes, weighted by the density of states for photons in a three-dimensional cavity.\n\nThis integration leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann T<sup>4</sup> law for the total energy of a black-body photon gas:\n\n<center>U = b * V * T<sup>4</sup></center>\n\nThis value represents the mean energy of the system at equilibrium. From the perspective of the Cramer-Chernoff theorem, any significant deviation from this mean energy is an extremely rare event.\n\nIn summary, the large deviation theorems of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff provide a rigorous mathematical basis for understanding why a photon gas settles into the specific equilibrium state described by the Bose-Einstein statistics. The equilibrium state is the \"least unlikely\" or most probable one, characterized by the maximum entropy and a well-defined mean energy, with the probability of significant deviations being exponentially suppressed.\n\n<<<\nThe equilibrium values for the entropy (S) and mean energy (U) of a photon gas (the Bose case of light quanta) are found by identifying the most probable macroscopic state, which, according to large deviation theorems, is the one that minimizes the corresponding rate function. This minimization, subject to physical constraints, is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the system.\n\nFor a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T:\n*   The **equilibrium mean energy** is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n    **U = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / 15h³c³) * V * T⁴**\n*   The **equilibrium entropy** is:\n    **S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / 45h³c³) * V * T³**\n\nHere, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, h is Planck's constant, and c is the speed of light. These results are derived from the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons (with zero chemical potential), which represents the distribution that maximizes the statistical entropy of the system.\n>>>"
