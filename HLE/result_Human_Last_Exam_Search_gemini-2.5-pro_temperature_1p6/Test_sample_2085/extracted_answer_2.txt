The Gaulish name "Odobeccus" does not have a direct modern French equivalent. The name is composed of two elements: "-beccus," from the Gaulish `*bekkos` meaning "beak" or "snout," which became the French word "bec"; and "Odo-," which likely derives from a root meaning "wealth" or "prosperity." Therefore, the name can be interpreted as "Wealthy Beak" or a similar descriptive nickname. There is no single French name that evolved from "Odobeccus."
