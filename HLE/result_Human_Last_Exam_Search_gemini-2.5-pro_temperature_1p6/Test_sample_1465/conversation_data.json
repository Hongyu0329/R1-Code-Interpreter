    "The oligomeric state of coiled-coil proteins is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acid residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat `(abcdefg)n`. By analyzing the provided sequences, we can predict their oligomeric states based on established rules. A common register for designed coiled-coils places the first residue at position 'g', which we will use for this analysis.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each sequence:\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: Following the `g(abcdefg)` register, the residues at the 'a' positions are consistently Isoleucine (I), and the residues at the 'd' positions are Alanine (A). A combination of Isoleucine at 'a' and Alanine at 'd' is known to favor the formation of a **trimer**.\n\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**: In this sequence, the 'a' positions are mostly occupied by Isoleucine (I), with one Asparagine (N), and the 'd' positions are all Leucine (L). The Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd' `(IaLd)` pattern is a strong determinant for **dimer** formation. The single polar Asparagine residue typically does not override the strong dimeric signal from the surrounding `IaLd` pairs.\n\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: This sequence has Isoleucine (I) at all 'a' positions and predominantly Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' positions. The `IaId` combination is a well-established motif for forming **trimers**.\n\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: This peptide has Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions. The 'd' positions are mostly the polar residue Lysine (K), with one Tryptophan (W). While polar residues in the core can be destabilizing, the strong preference of Isoleucine for the 'a' position drives a trimeric state. In a trimeric coiled-coil, the positively charged Lysine (K) at a 'd' position can be stabilized by forming salt bridges with negatively charged residues at flanking 'e' or 'g' positions, which in this sequence are Glutamine (Q) and Glutamic acid (E), respectively. This makes a **trimer** plausible.\n\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: Here, the 'a' positions are Isoleucine (I), and the 'd' positions are all Threonine (T). Threonine, although polar, has a Î²-branched side chain. The combination of Isoleucine at 'a' and Threonine at 'd' `(IaTd)` has been shown to specifically promote the formation of **tetramers**, where the polar hydroxyl groups of the threonines can form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network within the tetrameric core.\n\nBased on this analysis, the predicted oligomeric states for the five sequences are 3, 2, 3, 3, and 4.\n\n<<<E>>>"
