    "Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat in 1408 in what is today Nghệ An Province, Vietnam.\n\nIn 1408, the Vietnamese prince Trần Ngỗi led a rebellion against Ming rule. The Ming Emperor dispatched Mu Sheng to quell the uprising. However, Mu Sheng's forces were defeated by the rebels. Historical accounts of the Lam Sơn uprising, a later rebellion, detail strategic fighting in the area of Nghệ An. During this subsequent conflict, the Vietnamese forces attacked Trà Lân citadel (in modern Con Cuông District, Nghệ An) and ambushed the enemy at the Khả Lưu pass, eventually liberating the districts of Nghệ An. This points to the strategic importance of Nghệ An as a center of resistance against the Ming army. While the precise battlefield of Mu Sheng's 1408 defeat is not definitively named in all sources, the context of the anti-Ming rebellions strongly indicates the defeat occurred within the present-day Nghệ An Province.\n\nLater, in 1427, Mu Sheng was part of a larger Ming force that suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of Vietnamese forces led by Lê Lợi. A significant part of this campaign was the Battle of Chi Lăng, which took place in modern Lạng Sơn Province. While this was a major military disaster for the Ming, Mu Sheng's personal first major defeat as a commander occurred in 1408.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
