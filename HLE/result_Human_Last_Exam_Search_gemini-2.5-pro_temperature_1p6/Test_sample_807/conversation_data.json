    "The chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. It is a fluorescent dye that produces a vibrant pink or violet color. Other names for this chemical include C.I. Pigment Violet 1 and Basic Violet 10.\n\nCrayola crayons are primarily made from paraffin wax and colored pigments. However, the specific pigments used to create each crayon color are considered proprietary information by Crayola and are not publicly disclosed. While it is known that Crayola has sourced Rhodamine B, there is no publicly available information that definitively states which, if any, specific Crayola crayon color contains this chemical.\n\nMaterial Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for Crayola crayons do not list the specific pigments used for each color, only that the crayons contain various pigments. Lists of Crayola crayon colors and their names are widely available, but these do not include details about the chemical composition of the dyes and pigments used.\n\nTherefore, while Rhodamine B is a known pigment that produces a color consistent with some of Crayola's pink or violet crayons, it is not possible to identify a specific Crayola crayon that contains this chemical based on publicly available information.\n\n<<<Unable to determine based on publicly available information.>>>"
