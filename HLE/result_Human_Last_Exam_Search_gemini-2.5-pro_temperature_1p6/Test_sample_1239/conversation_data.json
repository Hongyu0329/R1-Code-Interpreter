    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ contains several types of transformations that leave the equations invariant. The dimension of this group is determined by the number of independent parameters required to specify these transformations. While the full symmetry group is technically infinite-dimensional, the physically significant and most commonly considered finite-dimensional subgroup is the extended Galilean group.\n\nThe symmetries that constitute this group are:\n*   **Time translation:** This accounts for one dimension, as the laws of fluid dynamics do not change over time.\n*   **Spatial translations:** In three-dimensional space, translations can occur independently along the x, y, and z axes, contributing three dimensions.\n*   **Rotations:** Rotations in three-dimensional space can be performed around the x, y, and z axes, which adds another three dimensions.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** These are transformations to a uniformly moving reference frame. In three dimensions, this adds three parameters for the velocity components of the moving frame.\n*   **Scaling:** There is a single scaling transformation that leaves the equations invariant.\n\nSumming these up, the total dimension of the finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries is 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11. It is important to note that the maximal Lie invariance algebra of the Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional due to pressure shifts and generalized Galilean transformations that can depend on arbitrary functions of time. However, the standard and most physically relevant part is the 11-dimensional subalgebra.\n\n<<<11>>>"
