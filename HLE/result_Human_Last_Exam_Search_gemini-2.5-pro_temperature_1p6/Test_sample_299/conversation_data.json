    "To determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, we will first analyze the properties of such a function and then establish the size of the set of functions that satisfy these properties.\n\n### Properties of the function $f$\n\n1.  **Injectivity**: The function $\\exp(x)$ is injective (one-to-one) over the real numbers. If we have $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. The injectivity of the exponential function implies $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must also be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity**: A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Thus, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n    *   If $f$ were strictly decreasing, then $f \\circ f$ (meaning $f(f(x))$) would be strictly increasing. (If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$, and applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality, $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$).\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing. (If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$, and $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$).\n    Since $\\exp(x)$ is a strictly increasing function, this condition alone does not rule out either possibility.\n\n3.  **Fixed Points**: Let's consider the case where $f$ is strictly decreasing. A continuous, strictly decreasing function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must have exactly one fixed point $x_0$, where $f(x_0) = x_0$. Applying $f$ to this equation yields $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. According to the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. However, the equation $\\exp(x) = x$ has no real solutions, as $\\exp(x) > x$ for all real $x$. This is because the function $g(x) = \\exp(x) - x$ has a minimum value of 1 at $x=0$. Therefore, no such fixed point exists, and we can conclude that **$f$ must be strictly increasing**.\n\n4.  **Asymptotic Behavior**: Since $f$ is strictly increasing and continuous, its limits as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$ exist. Let $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = L$ and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = M$. The range of $f$ is the interval $(L, M)$.\n    The range of $f(f(x))$ is $(\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y))$.\n    The range of $\\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$.\n    Therefore, we must have $\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y) = \\infty$.\n    Since $f$ is continuous, $\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = f(L)$ if $L$ is a finite real number.\n    If $L = -\\infty$, then $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} f(y) = L = -\\infty$. But this limit must be 0. So, $L$ must be a finite real number.\n    Thus, we have $f(L)=0$. For the upper limit, if $M$ were finite, $\\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y) = f(M) = \\infty$, which is impossible. Thus, $M = \\infty$.\n    So, any solution $f$ must be a strictly increasing function with $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = L$ for some finite $L$, and $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$. Furthermore, $f(L) = 0$.\n\n5.  **Domain of $L$**: Since the range of $f$ is $(L, \\infty)$, it must be that $f(x) > L$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In particular, $f(L) = 0 > L$. If $L$ were non-negative ($L \\ge 0$), this would be a contradiction. Therefore, $L$ must be a negative number, $L < 0$.\n\n### Existence and Cardinality\n\nIt has been shown that such functions, often called \"half-exponential functions,\" do exist. Their construction demonstrates their abundance. A solution can be constructed by following these steps:\n1.  Choose any negative real number $L < 0$.\n2.  Define a continuous, strictly increasing bijection $h$ from the interval $[L, 0]$ to the interval $[0, \\exp(L)]$. The only constraints on $h$ are the continuity, the strict increase, and the boundary conditions $h(L) = 0$ and $h(0) = \\exp(L)$.\n3.  Extend this function to the entire real line. For $x \\in (0, \\exp(L)]$, define $f(x) = \\exp(h^{-1}(x))$. This defines $f$ on $[L, \\exp(L)]$. This process can be iterated to define $f$ on $(L, \\infty)$. For $x < L$, $f(x)$ is determined by the values already defined, since for every value in the range $(L, \\infty)$ there must be a preimage. This construction yields a valid continuous solution for every choice of $L$ and $h$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of solutions depends on the number of possible choices at each step:\n1.  The choice for $L$: There are as many choices for $L$ as there are negative real numbers, which has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n2.  The choice for the function $h$: For a fixed $L$, we need to count the number of continuous, strictly increasing functions from $[L, 0]$ to $[0, \\exp(L)]$.\n    *   We can show there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions. For any number $c \\in (0, 1)$, we can define a unique piecewise linear function $h_c$ that passes through the points $(L, 0)$, $(L/2, c \\cdot \\exp(L))$, and $(0, \\exp(L))$. Each distinct value of $c$ defines a distinct function $h_c$. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence with the interval $(0, 1)$, proving there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions.\n    *   The set of all continuous functions from a closed interval to $\\mathbb{R}$ has a cardinality of $\\mathfrak{c}$. Our set of functions $h$ is a subset of this, so its cardinality is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   By the Cantor-SchrÃ¶der-Bernstein theorem, the cardinality of the set of possible functions $h$ for a fixed $L$ is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nEach pair $(L, h)$ defines a unique continuous function $f(x)$ satisfying the original equation. Since the limit $L = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ is unique for a given function, the sets of solutions corresponding to different values of $L$ are disjoint.\n\nThe total cardinality of the set of solutions is the product of the cardinalities of the choices:\n$|\\text{Set of solutions}| = |\\{\\text{choices for } L\\}| \\times |\\{\\text{choices for } h \\text{ for a given } L\\}|$\nUsing cardinal arithmetic, this is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ has the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<$|\\mathbb{R}|, \\mathfrak{c}, \\text{ or } 2^{\\aleph_0}$>>>"
