    "Yes, it does follow that $f=0$. Here is a step-by-step argument.\n\n1.  **Moments and the Fourier Transform**: Let $f$ be a Schwartz class function. Its Fourier transform is defined as $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx$. The derivatives of the Fourier transform can be computed by differentiating under the integral sign:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\n    Evaluating at $\\xi=0$, we get a direct relationship between the derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at the origin and the moments of $f$:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx $$\n    This is a standard property in Fourier analysis.\n\n2.  **Applying the Condition**: The given condition is that all moments of $f$ are zero, i.e., $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. From the relationship above, this directly implies that all derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ at the origin are zero:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n\n3.  **Properties of the Fourier Transform of a Schwartz Function**: A crucial property of the Schwartz space $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ is that the Fourier transform is an automorphism on it, meaning it maps $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ to itself. Furthermore, the Fourier transform of any Schwartz function can be extended to an entire analytic function on the complex plane $\\mathbb{C}$. This means the function is infinitely differentiable in the complex sense and is equal to its Taylor series expansion everywhere.\n\n4.  **Uniqueness from Taylor Series**: We have established that $\\hat{f}$ can be viewed as an entire analytic function on $\\mathbb{C}$ and that all its Taylor coefficients at the origin are zero ($\\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} = 0$). An entire function whose derivatives are all zero at a single point must be identically zero throughout the complex plane.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is zero for all real numbers $\\xi$, the function $f$ must be the zero function. This follows from the injectivity of the Fourier transform (the inversion theorem), which states that if $\\hat{f} = 0$, then $f = 0$.\n\nTherefore, if a Schwartz function has all its moments equal to zero, the function itself must be the zero function.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
