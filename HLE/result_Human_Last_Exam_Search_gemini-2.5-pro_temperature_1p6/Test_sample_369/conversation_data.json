    "The scansion of the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago\" is a sequence of dactyls (D) and spondees (S) representing the six metrical feet of the line.\n\nThe scansion for this line is:\n**D S D S S S**\n\nThis breaks down as follows:\n*   **Foot 1:** Dactyl (verum ubi)\n*   **Foot 2:** Spondee (equi at-)\n*   **Foot 3:** Dactyl (-que hominis)\n*   **Foot 4:** Spondee (-nis casu)\n*   **Foot 5:** Spondee (convenit)\n*   **Foot 6:** Spondee (imago)\n\nLatin hexameter is composed of six feet, where each of the first four feet can be either a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short syllables) or a spondee (two long syllables). The fifth foot is typically a dactyl, and the sixth is a spondee or trochee (long, short). The scansion of this particular line from Lucretius' *De Rerum Natura* is known to be complex, involving elisions where a word ending in a vowel or '-m' is followed by a word beginning with a vowel.\n\n<<<D S D S S S>>>"
