    "This problem requires understanding the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines. There are two possible triangles for a given angle `B` and sides `AC` and `BC` under specific conditions. Let `a = BC`, `b = AC`, and `c = AB`.\n\nFirst, the value of S, represented by SNYWR, is 2022. This is based on the problem's origin from the 2022 Stanford Math Tournament. Therefore, `BC = 2022`.\n\nFor two possible triangles to exist given an angle and two sides (the SSA case), the following conditions must be met:\n1.  The given angle (in this case, ∠B) must be acute (less than 90°).\n2.  The side opposite the given angle (`AC`) must be shorter than the other given side (`BC`).\n3.  The side opposite the given angle (`AC`) must be longer than the altitude `h` from vertex C to side `AB`.\n\nHere is the given information:\n*   `BC = a = 2022`\n*   `m∠B = 30°`\n*   `AC = b` is the side whose integer values we need to count.\n\nLet's check the conditions:\n1.  `m∠B = 30°`, which is an acute angle.\n2.  `AC < BC`, so `b < 2022`.\n3.  The altitude `h` from vertex C can be calculated as `h = BC * sin(B)`.\n    `h = 2022 * sin(30°)`\n    Since `sin(30°) = 0.5`,\n    `h = 2022 * 0.5 = 1011`.\n    The condition is that `AC > h`, so `b > 1011`.\n\nCombining these conditions, the length of side `AC` must be between the length of the altitude `h` and the length of side `BC`.\nSo, `1011 < AC < 2022`.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values for `AC`. The integers in this range are `1012, 1013, 1014, ..., 2021`.\n\nTo find the number of integers in this range, we can use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of values = `2021 - 1012 + 1`\nNumber of values = `1009 + 1`\nNumber of values = `1010`\n\nThus, there are 1010 integer values for the length of side `AC` for which two possible triangles can be formed.\n\n<<<1010>>>"
