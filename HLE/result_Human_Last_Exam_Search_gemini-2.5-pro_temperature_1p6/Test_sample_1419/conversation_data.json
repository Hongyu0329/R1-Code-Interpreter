    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the renormalization group (RG) flow of the coupling constant `u` is analyzed using the epsilon expansion, where `ϵ = 4 - d` is a small parameter representing the deviation from four spatial dimensions.\n\nThe leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is found by calculating the one-loop beta function for the coupling `u` and finding its non-trivial zero.\n\nFor the O(N)-symmetric ϕ⁴ theory, which describes a system with an N-component scalar field, the beta function to one-loop order is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (N+8)/3 * u² + O(u³)\n\nThe fixed point u* is the value of u for which the beta function is zero (β(u*) = 0), representing a scale-invariant point in the theory. Solving for the non-trivial fixed point gives:\n\n-ϵu* + (N+8)/3 * (u*)² = 0\nu* = (3 / (N+8)) * ϵ\n\nFor the specific case of a single-component scalar field (the Ising universality class), N=1. The expression simplifies to:\n\nu* = (3 / 9) * ϵ = ϵ / 3\n\nThus, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of ϵ is proportional to ϵ.\n\n<<<The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in the O(N)-symmetric ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions is u* = (3 / (N+8))ϵ. For a single component (N=1) theory, this becomes u* = ϵ/3.>>>"
