    "In the context of the representation theory of posets, particularly within the field of topological data analysis, an \"n-resolvable\" functor is one that admits a projective resolution of length at most *n*. For a tame functor defined on an upper semilattice, there is a specific bound on the length of its minimal free resolution.\n\nA tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice, is **2-resolvable**.\n\nThis means that any such functor has a projective dimension of at most 2. This result is a consequence of the well-behaved homological properties of the category of tame functors indexed by upper semilattices. This category is abelian, and all its objects admit a minimal free resolution. Specifically, it has been shown that for a tame functor on an upper semilattice, this resolution has a length of at most 2.\n\nThe ability to construct these finite resolutions is crucial for computing homological invariants, like Betti numbers, often using tools such as Koszul complexes.\n\n<<<2>>>"
