    "A comprehensive study has determined the exact number of finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3. A subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for all elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including when *a* and *b* are the same), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (also referred to as \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the same group.\n\nGroundbreaking work by Chimere Stanley Anabanti and Sarah Hart, particularly in their paper \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3,\" established that any finite group possessing such a set must have an order of 24 or less. Their research culminated in a complete classification of these groups. This was achieved by proving the conjecture that no group of an order greater than 24 can contain a locally maximal product-free set of size 3.\n\nThe classification is detailed in a table within their publications, which lists all such groups and the corresponding product-free sets. By examining this comprehensive list, the total number of non-isomorphic finite groups that have a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 has been identified.\n\nThe groups identified are:\n*   The cyclic groups C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C12, C14, C15, C18, C20, C24\n*   The dihedral groups D8, D10, D12, D14, D18\n*   The direct products C2 x C2 x C2, C2 x C4, C2 x C6, C3 x C3\n*   The alternating group A4\n*   The quaternion group Q8\n*   The quasidihedral group QD16\n*   The special linear group SL(2,3)\n*   The group C3 x D6\n\nCounting these distinct non-isomorphic groups reveals the total number.\n\n<<<25>>>"
