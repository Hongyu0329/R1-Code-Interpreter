    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nWe first check if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\nThe coefficients of the polynomial are 1, 0, 0, 8, and 14.\n*   The prime 2 divides all coefficients (0, 8, 14) except for the leading coefficient (1).\n*   The square of the prime, $2^2=4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\nTherefore, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since the polynomial is irreducible and of degree 4, the order of its Galois group must be a multiple of 4, leaving the possibilities of 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nFor a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$. In this case, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = 256(14^3) - 27(8^4)$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nTo determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$, we need to check if the discriminant is a perfect square. The prime factorization of the discriminant is $591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. Since the exponent of the prime factor 2 is odd, the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. The possible Galois groups are therefore $S_4$ (order 24) or the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is $y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0$. For our polynomial, this becomes:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = 0$\n$y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$\n\nWe check for rational roots of this cubic polynomial. According to the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Testing the divisors, we find that $y=8$ is a root:\n$8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe determination of the Galois group for an irreducible quartic polynomial depends on the nature of its discriminant and its resolvent cubic. We have found that:\n1.  The polynomial is irreducible.\n2.  The discriminant is not a perfect square.\n3.  The resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis set of conditions uniquely identifies the Galois group as the dihedral group of order 8, denoted $D_4$.\n\nThe order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
