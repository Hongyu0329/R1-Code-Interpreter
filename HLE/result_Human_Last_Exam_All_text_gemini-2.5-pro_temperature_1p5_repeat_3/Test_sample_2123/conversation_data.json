    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the surname of an English poet. This surname appears in a specific context: within a Russian text (a translation of an essay) that is describing the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n\n2.  **Identify the Probable Source:** This is a classic \"erudition\" or trivia-style question. It doesn't refer to just any essay, but a specific, well-known one, famous for this particular wordplay. The text in question is often attributed to Joseph Brodsky, but the actual source is an essay by the Russian writers Pyotr Vail and Alexander Genis. The specific context and phrasing are key.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Wide Boulevards of Vienna\" Clue:** This points to the grand, circular boulevard in Vienna, the Ringstrasse, which is famous for its width and majestic architecture. The description aims to capture this sense of grandeur.\n\n4.  **Focus on the Russian Language Aspect:** The question specifies a \"Russian translation.\" This is a critical hint that the answer lies in a pun, a play on words, or a cultural reference that is particularly apparent in the Russian language.\n\n5.  **The Pun/Reference:** The authors describe the boulevards using a figurative comparison. The Russian phrase used is \"**широки, как Байрон**\" (\"shiroki, kak Bayron\").\n\n6.  **Break Down the Russian Phrase:**\n    *   **\"Широки\" (shiroki):** This is the short plural form of the adjective \"широкий,\" meaning \"wide.\" So, \"(they are) wide.\"\n    *   **\"Как\" (kak):** This is the Russian word for \"as\" or \"like.\"\n    *   **\"Байрон\" (Bayron):** This is the Russian transliteration of the surname of the famous English Romantic poet, Lord Byron.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The descriptive phrase \"as wide as Byron\" literally incorporates the poet's surname to express the grand, romantic, and sweeping nature of the Viennese boulevards, comparing them to the scale and spirit of the poet himself. Therefore, the surname is explicitly mentioned in the description.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Source Attribution:** It is crucial to know that while this puzzle is sometimes linked to Joseph Brodsky, the actual authors of the phrase are Pyotr Vail and Alexander Genis. This detail helps locate the exact reference.\n*   **The Nature of the Pun:** The solution isn't a simple sound-alike word. Instead, the poet's name is used directly as part of a simile (\"as wide as Byron\") to create a powerful and witty image.\n*   **Cultural Context:** The choice of Byron is not random. He is a symbol of Romanticism, freedom, and grand passions, which is a fitting metaphorical comparison for the magnificent boulevards of an old imperial capital.\n*   **The English Original:** The question mentions a \"Russian translation of a certain essay.\" Vail and Genis wrote in Russian, so it's more accurate to say it's from a \"Russian essay.\" The core of the puzzle, however, remains the same regardless of this nuance. The key is that the wordplay exists in the Russian text.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the English surname of the poet.\n\n<<<Byron>>>"
