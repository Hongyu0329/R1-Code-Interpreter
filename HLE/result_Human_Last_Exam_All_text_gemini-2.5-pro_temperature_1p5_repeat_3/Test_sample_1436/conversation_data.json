    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify the Diagram's Topology**\n    *   **Vertices:** The diagram has two vertices. Let's label their spacetime coordinates as `x₁` and `x₂`.\n    *   **Field Contractions (Propagators):** The diagram has four field contractions, which correspond to four internal propagator lines.\n    *   **Interaction Type:** The problem statement implies an interaction where a vertex connects at least four field lines. The most common example is a `φ⁴` theory, with an interaction Lagrangian `L_int = (λ/4!) φ⁴`. In this theory, each vertex has four \"legs\". With two such vertices, we have a total of `4 + 4 = 8` field operators available for contraction.\n    *   **Connecting the Vertices:** To form a single connected diagram with two vertices and four propagators, all four propagators must connect vertex `x₁` to vertex `x₂`. If any line connected a vertex to itself, or if the contractions formed two separate loops, it would not match the description.\n    *   **Visualizing the Diagram:** The diagram consists of two points (the vertices) with four distinct lines drawn between them. This is often called a \"setting-sun\" or \"sunrise\" diagram when it appears as a self-energy insertion into a propagator line.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Symmetry Factor (S)**\n    The symmetry factor `S` of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which in simpler terms means the number of ways you can permute its components (vertices and lines) without changing the diagram's overall structure (topology).\n\n    We calculate `S` by considering the different types of symmetries present in the diagram:\n\n    *   **Symmetry from Permuting Identical Vertices:**\n        The two vertices, `x₁` and `x₂`, are of the same type (both are `φ⁴` interaction vertices). We can swap their positions (`x₁` ↔ `x₂`), and the diagram remains topologically identical. The number of ways to permute these two identical vertices is `2! = 2`.\n        *   *Vertex Symmetry Factor = 2*\n\n    *   **Symmetry from Permuting Identical Propagators:**\n        The four propagator lines all start at one vertex and end at the other. They are functionally and topologically identical. We can permute these four lines among themselves in any way, and the diagram remains unchanged. The number of ways to permute these four identical lines is `4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24`.\n        *   *Line Symmetry Factor = 24*\n\n    *   **Total Symmetry Factor:**\n        The total symmetry factor `S` is the product of all individual symmetry factors.\n        `S = (Vertex Symmetry Factor) × (Line Symmetry Factor)`\n        `S = 2 × 24 = 48`\n\n### Verification using Perturbation Theory Expansion\n\nWe can verify this result by considering the origin of the diagram in the perturbative expansion of the Green's function.\n\n1.  A diagram with two vertices arises from the second-order term in the expansion of `exp(iS_int)`, which is `(1/2!) * (iS_int)²`. For `L_int = (λ/4!) φ⁴`, this term contributes a factor of `(1/2!) * (λ/4!)²`.\n2.  Next, we must count the number of distinct Wick contractions (`C`) that produce this specific topology from the fields `φ(x₁)φ(x₁)φ(x₁)φ(x₁)φ(x₂)φ(x₂)φ(x₂)φ(x₂)`.\n    *   Pick one of the four fields at `x₁`. It can be contracted with any of the four fields at `x₂`. (4 choices)\n    *   Pick a second field at `x₁`. It can be contracted with any of the remaining three fields at `x₂`. (3 choices)\n    *   Pick a third field at `x₁`. It can be contracted with any of the remaining two fields at `x₂`. (2 choices)\n    *   The last field at `x₁` must contract with the last remaining field at `x₂`. (1 choice)\n    *   The total number of ways to form these connections is `C = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 4! = 24`.\n3.  The overall numerical pre-factor for this diagram is the product of these factors: `(1/2!) * (1/4!)² * C = (1/2) * (1/24 * 1/24) * 24 = 1 / (2 * 24) = 1/48`.\n4.  The contribution of any Feynman diagram is proportional to `1/S`. By comparing our calculated pre-factor of `1/48`, we confirm that the symmetry factor `S` must be 48.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Assumed Interaction:** The calculation relies on the assumption of a `φ⁴`-type interaction where each vertex has four lines. If the interaction were different (e.g., in QED), the diagram and its symmetry would change.\n2.  **Identical Components:** The key is to correctly identify which components (lines and vertices) are interchangeable. In this case, the two vertices are interchangeable, and the four lines connecting them are also interchangeable.\n3.  **Connected Diagram:** We have assumed the question refers to a single connected graph, which is the standard interpretation in this context. Disconnected graphs have their own symmetry factors calculated separately.\n4.  **Undirected Lines:** The propagators for a real scalar field (`φ`) are undirected (`G(x-y) = G(y-x)`), so there is no symmetry factor associated with reversing the direction of a line. The vertex exchange symmetry already accounts for this.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the symmetry factor is calculated as the product of the vertex permutation factor (`2!`) and the line permutation factor (`4!`).\n\nS = 2! × 4! = 2 × 24 = 48.\n\nThis result is confirmed by analyzing the combinatorial factors arising from the perturbative expansion.\n\n<<<48>>>"
