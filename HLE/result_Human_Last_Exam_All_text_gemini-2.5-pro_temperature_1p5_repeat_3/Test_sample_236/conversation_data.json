    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group representable by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$)**: This is a group where the elements are oriented homology 3-spheres. Two such manifolds, $M_1$ and $M_2$, are considered equivalent (and thus represent the same element) if there exists an oriented 4-manifold $W$ whose boundary is the disjoint union of $M_1$ and $-M_2$ (i.e., $M_2$ with reversed orientation), and $W$ is a homology cobordism between them. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This process modifies the 3-sphere by removing a tubular neighborhood of a knot $K$ and gluing it back differently. The specific gluing is determined by an integer `n`, called the surgery coefficient. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_n(K)$.\n*   **Homology Sphere Condition**: For $S^3_n(K)$ to be a homology 3-sphere (i.e., to have the same integer homology groups as $S^3$), its first homology group $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z})$ must be trivial. The first homology group of a surgered manifold is known to be the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_n$. For this to be the trivial group, we must have $|n|=1$.\n\n**Careful Point 1**: We only need to consider surgeries with coefficients $n=+1$ and $n=-1$.\n\n**2. List the Knots with At Most Four Crossings**\n\nWe must consider all knots with a crossing number of 4 or less. It is crucial to distinguish between a knot and its mirror image if the knot is chiral.\n\n*   **0 crossings**: The unknot ($0_1$). This knot is achiral (its mirror image is the same knot).\n*   **1 or 2 crossings**: There are no such knots.\n*   **3 crossings**: The trefoil knot ($3_1$). This knot is chiral. We must consider both the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil (its mirror image, which we can denote as $-3_1$).\n*   **4 crossings**: The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphichiral (achiral), so it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n**Careful Point 2**: The set of knots to analyze is {$0_1$, $3_1$, $-3_1$, $4_1$}.\n\n**3. Analyze the Surgery Results for Each Knot**\n\nWe now perform $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on each of these knots and identify the resulting manifolds.\n\n*   **On the Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   $S^3_1(0_1)$: This surgery results in the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$: This also results in $S^3$.\n    *   Manifolds generated: {$S^3$}.\n\n*   **On the Right-Handed Trefoil ($3_1$)**:\n    *   $S^3_1(3_1)$: This results in the famous **Poincaré homology sphere**, which we will denote as $P$. It is the first example of a homology sphere that is not the standard 3-sphere.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$: This results in the mirror image of the Poincaré sphere, denoted $-P$.\n    *   Manifolds generated: {$P, -P$}.\n\n*   **On the Left-Handed Trefoil ($-3_1$)**:\n    *   Surgery on a mirror knot is related to surgery on the original knot by the formula $S^3_n(-K) \\cong -S^3_{-n}(K)$.\n    *   $S^3_1(-3_1) \\cong -S^3_{-1}(3_1) = -(-P) = P$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(-3_1) \\cong -S^3_{1}(3_1) = -P$.\n    *   Manifolds generated: {$P, -P$} (no new manifolds).\n\n*   **On the Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**:\n    *   It is a known result that $+1$ surgery on the figure-eight knot yields the same manifold as $-1$ surgery on the right-handed trefoil, and vice versa.\n    *   $S^3_1(4_1) \\cong S^3_{-1}(3_1) = -P$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(4_1) \\cong S^3_1(3_1) = P$.\n    *   Manifolds generated: {$P, -P$} (no new manifolds).\n\n**4. Consolidate and Count Distinct Elements**\n\nBy performing all possible relevant surgeries, we have generated the following set of oriented manifolds: {$S^3$, $P$, $-P$}.\nThe final step is to determine how many distinct elements these three manifolds represent in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n\n**Careful Point 3**: Two manifolds being different does not automatically mean they represent different elements in the group. We must check if they are homology cobordant. To do this, we use a homology cobordism invariant.\n\nThe **Casson invariant**, denoted $\\lambda(M)$, is an integer-valued invariant for homology 3-spheres. A key property is that if two homology spheres $M_1$ and $M_2$ are homology cobordant, then $\\lambda(M_1) = \\lambda(M_2)$.\n\nLet's compute the Casson invariant for our three manifolds:\n\n*   $\\lambda(S^3) = 0$.\n*   $\\lambda(P) = \\lambda(S^3_1(3_1)) = 1$.\n*   $\\lambda(-P) = \\lambda(S^3_{-1}(3_1)) = -1$.\n\nSince the Casson invariants for $S^3$, $P$, and $-P$ are $0, 1,$ and $-1$ respectively, and these values are all different, the three manifolds cannot be homology cobordant to each other. They represent three distinct elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe set of homology spheres that can be constructed is {$S^3, P, -P$}. These represent three distinct elements in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$, identified by their distinct Casson invariants (0, 1, and -1).\n\nTherefore, there are **3** such elements.\n\n<<<3>>>"
