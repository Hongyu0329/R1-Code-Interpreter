The appropriate management for the patient involves a multi-phased approach, prioritizing her systemic health.

**1. Immediate Management:**
*   **Systemic:** Urgent referral to a physician for initiation of treatment for her uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. No definitive dental work should proceed until her blood glucose is stable.
*   **Dental:** The 28-hour delay makes replantation of the avulsed teeth impossible. Treatment involves cleaning and debriding the wound, administering prophylactic antibiotics due to high infection risk, ensuring her tetanus prophylaxis is current, and managing pain. Radiographs are taken to rule out bone fractures.

**2. Provisional Management:**
*   An **interim removable partial denture (flipper)** is fabricated to provide aesthetics and space maintenance while the gums and bone heal (3-6 months) and her diabetes is brought under control.

**3. Definitive Management:**
*   Given her systemic condition (diabetes), the long span of missing teeth, and the complex forces from her Class III skeletal malocclusion (SNB 88Â°), the safest and most predictable long-term solution is a **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**. This avoids the high surgical risk of implants and the poor biomechanical prognosis of a long-s
