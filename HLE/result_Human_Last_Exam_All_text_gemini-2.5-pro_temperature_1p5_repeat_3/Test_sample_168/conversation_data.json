    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Sound Source**\nFirst, we need to understand the nature of the sound produced by a human muscle twitch. When a muscle contracts or twitches, it vibrates. These vibrations create sound waves, but at a very low frequency. The sound of muscle contraction, known as mechanomyography (MMG), typically falls in the range of 10 to 25 Hertz (Hz). This frequency range is considered \"infrasound,\" which is sound at frequencies below the lower limit of normal human hearing.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Hearing Capabilities of Each Animal**\n\n*   **E. Human:** The standard range for human hearing is from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (or 20 kHz). Since muscle twitches produce sound around 10-25 Hz, most of this range is below the 20 Hz threshold for humans. Therefore, humans cannot hear their own muscle twitches.\n\n*   **A. Dog:** The hearing range of a dog is approximately 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. While they can hear much higher frequencies than humans, their low-frequency hearing is actually worse. They cannot hear sounds as low as 10-25 Hz.\n\n*   **B. Bat:** Bats are famous for using echolocation, which involves producing and hearing very high-frequency sounds (ultrasound). Their hearing range is typically from around 2,000 Hz to over 110,000 Hz. They are not equipped to hear low-frequency infrasound.\n\n*   **D. Whale:** Whales are known for their exceptional hearing. There are two main groups. Toothed whales (like dolphins) use high-frequency ultrasound. Baleen whales (like blue whales and fin whales), on the other hand, are masters of infrasound. They communicate using extremely low-frequency sounds (as low as 10-15 Hz) that can travel for thousands of miles through the ocean. A baleen whale's hearing is highly sensitive in the 10-25 Hz range, so it has the physiological ability to detect a sound at this frequency.\n\n*   **C. Herring:** This might seem like a surprising option, but certain fish, particularly those in the Clupeidae family (which includes herring, shad, and sardines), have remarkable hearing. They possess a special connection between their swim bladder (which acts like a sound receptor) and their inner ear. This adaptation makes them extremely sensitive to a wide range of frequencies, including infrasound below 20 Hz. This sensitivity is believed to help them detect the subtle movements of approaching predators, which would include the muscle contractions of a striking fish. The sound of a human muscle twitch falls into the frequency range that a herring can detect.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Plausible Candidates**\nBoth baleen whales and herrings have hearing ranges that overlap with the frequency of a muscle twitch. However, the question asks which animal *might* be able to hear it. The sensitivity of herring to subtle, close-range, low-frequency sounds as a predator-detection mechanism is a well-documented and often-cited biological fact. It is plausible that a herring, in a quiet aquatic environment, could detect the faint infrasound from a nearby tensing human muscle. While a whale could also hear that frequency, the specific adaptation in herring makes it a classic example for this type of extreme hearing sensitivity.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of hearing ranges, the herring has a specialized auditory system that makes it highly sensitive to the low-frequency infrasound produced by muscle contractions.\n\n<<<C>>>"
