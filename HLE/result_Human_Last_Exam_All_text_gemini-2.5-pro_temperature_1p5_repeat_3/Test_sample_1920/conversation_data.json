    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d=53599$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $53599$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n    \\item Trying small primes: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n    \\item Next, we factor $7657$: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n    \\item Finally, we factor $589$. We test primes up to $\\sqrt{589} \\approx 24.2$. The primes are 17, 19, 23. We find $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThis shows that $d$ is a square-free integer, which is an important simplification. Let's denote the prime factors as $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet character**\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo $d$ is isomorphic to the product of the character groups for its prime power factors. Since $d$ is square-free, any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters:\n$$ \\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 $$\nwhere $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo the prime $p_i$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the condition for primitivity**\nA character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$ with $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ (a product of distinct primes) is primitive modulo $d$ if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is non-trivial. The trivial character is the one that maps all elements to 1, and it has conductor 1. Any other character modulo a prime $p_i$ is primitive of conductor $p_i$. For the conductor of $\\chi$ to be $d$, the conductor of each $\\chi_i$ must be $p_i$. This means none of the $\\chi_i$ can be the trivial character.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the condition on the order**\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$$ \\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) $$\nWe are given that $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = 6$.\nThis imposes two conditions on the orders of the component characters, let's call them $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$:\n1.  For each $i$, $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6. So $o_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n2.  The set of orders $\\{o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4\\}$ must contain at least one order that is a multiple of 2, and at least one order that is a multiple of 3.\n\nCombining this with the primitivity condition (Step 3), which requires each $\\chi_i$ to be non-trivial ($o_i \\neq 1$), the possible orders for each component character are $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of available component characters**\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. In a cyclic group of order $n$, if $k$ divides $n$, there are exactly $\\phi(k)$ elements of order $k$.\nLet's find the number of characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 for each prime factor $p_i$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $p_1=7$, $\\phi(7)=6$. Orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 6.\n    \\item For $p_2=13$, $\\phi(13)=12$. Orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 12.\n    \\item For $p_3=19$, $\\phi(19)=18$. Orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 18.\n    \\item For $p_4=31$, $\\phi(31)=30$. Orders 2, 3, 6 all divide 30.\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, for each of the four primes, characters of the required orders exist. The number of such characters is:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    \\item Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    \\item Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\\end{itemize}\nFor each of the four components $\\chi_i$, the total number of non-trivial characters whose order divides 6 is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n**Step 6: The combinatorial calculation**\nWe need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that their orders $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$ satisfy the condition $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\nWe will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ is non-trivial and its order $o_i$ divides 6 (i.e., $o_i \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$).\nThe number of choices for each component is 5. So, the total number of such tuples is:\n$$|S| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$$\n\nNow, we must subtract the tuples for which the lcm is not 6.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item **Case A: The lcm is not a multiple of 2.** This means that for all $i$, $o_i$ is not a multiple of 2. From the allowed set $\\{2,3,6\\}$, the only possibility is $o_i = 3$ for all $i$.\n    The number of characters of order 3 is $\\phi(3)=2$ for each component.\n    The number of such tuples is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n    \\item **Case B: The lcm is not a multiple of 3.** This means that for all $i$, $o_i$ is not a multiple of 3. From the allowed set $\\{2,3,6\\}$, the only possibility is $o_i = 2$ for all $i$.\n    The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$ for each component.\n    The number of such tuples is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe set of tuples in Case A (all orders are 3) and Case B (all orders are 2) are disjoint. Therefore, the number of invalid tuples is simply the sum of the counts for these two cases.\nNumber of invalid tuples = $16 + 1 = 17$.\n\nThe number of valid tuples, where the lcm is exactly 6, is the total number of possibilities minus the invalid ones.\nNumber of desired characters = $|S| - (\\text{Number in Case A} + \\text{Number in Case B}) = 625 - 17 = 608$."
