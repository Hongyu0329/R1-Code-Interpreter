    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Question**\n\nThe core of the puzzle lies in the title, \"The Bays\". This title is explicitly stated to be a question. Phonetically, \"The Bays\" sounds identical to \"The B's\". Therefore, the question being asked is, \"What are the B's?\". The answer must be a set of words that begin with the letter 'B', derived from the clues within the haiku. The final answer must be presented in alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Haiku for Clues**\n\nThe haiku provides three lines, each containing a clue to one of the 'B' words.\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** A \"tempest\" is a violent, windy storm. We need to find a 'B' word that is synonymous with or strongly related to a tempest.\n    *   **Analysis:** A sudden, strong gust of wind, as one would experience in a tempest, is often called a \"Blast\". This fits the description perfectly.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The first 'B' word is **Blast**.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must first interpret \"Twice fifteen\". This is simple arithmetic: 2 * 15 = 30. The phrase \"winds of change\" directs us to interpret this number in a meteorological context.\n    *   **Analysis:** A wind speed of 30 mph is a plausible interpretation. On the Beaufort wind scale, which classifies wind force, speeds from 25-31 mph are categorized as a \"Strong Breeze\".\n    *   **Conclusion:** The second 'B' word is **Breeze**.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This line is more poetic. \"A divine one\" refers to a god or deity. \"Yields\" can mean \"gives way to\" or \"produces\". The context of the storm passing suggests a decrease in intensity.\n    *   **Analysis:** After a tempest (Blast) and a strong wind (Breeze), the storm \"yields\" or subsides. A divine entity, like a wind god, might \"yield\" a very gentle wind. A very light and gentle puff of air is commonly called a \"Breath\" of air. This represents the final, calm stage after the storm.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The third 'B' word is **Breath**.\n\n**Step 3: Compiling and Ordering the Final Answer**\n\nWe have successfully identified three words starting with 'B' from the haiku: Blast, Breeze, and Breath. The final instruction is to list them in alphabetical order.\n\n1.  Blast\n2.  Breath\n3.  Breeze\n\nArranging them alphabetically, we get the final sequence.\n\n<<<Blast, Breath, Breeze>>>"
