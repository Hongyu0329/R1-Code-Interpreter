    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron**\nAn icosahedron is a regular polyhedron composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. A key property of all regular polyhedra, including the icosahedron, is that they possess a high degree of symmetry, including a single point at their geometric center known as the center of symmetry.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Orientation of the Tank**\nThe problem states the icosahedron tank is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of the 20 triangular faces is positioned horizontally at the bottom, serving as the base. Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, there is an identical, parallel triangular face at the very top.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Half-Filled\" Condition**\nWhen the tank is \"half-filled\", the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron. The surface of the water will be a horizontal plane. Because the icosahedron is a centrally symmetric solid, the plane that divides its volume into two equal halves must pass through its center of symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Properties of the Water Surface Shape**\nThe shape of the water surface is the shape of the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at its center. We can determine this shape by analyzing the symmetries of the icosahedron in its given orientation.\n\n*   **3-Fold Rotational Symmetry:** The vertical axis that passes through the center of the bottom triangular face and the center of the top triangular face is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. This means that rotating the icosahedron by 120° around this axis leaves it unchanged. Consequently, the horizontal cross-section at its center must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Central Symmetry (Point Symmetry):** The icosahedron has a center of symmetry. Since the water surface plane passes through this center, the resulting shape must also be centrally symmetric. A shape is centrally symmetric if it remains unchanged after a 180° rotation around its center. This is equivalent to 2-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Symmetries to Find the Final Shape**\nThe shape of the water surface must satisfy both 3-fold and 2-fold rotational symmetry about its center. A planar geometric figure that has both 3-fold and 2-fold rotational symmetry must necessarily have 6-fold rotational symmetry. (The combination of a 120° rotation and a 180° rotation can generate a 60° rotation).\n\nThe intersection of a plane with a polyhedron results in a polygon. A polygon with 6-fold rotational symmetry is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen a tank in the shape of an icosahedron standing on a face is filled to half its volume, the water level will be at the horizontal mid-plane passing through the center of the icosahedron. The shape of this cross-section, and thus the shape of the water surface, is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
