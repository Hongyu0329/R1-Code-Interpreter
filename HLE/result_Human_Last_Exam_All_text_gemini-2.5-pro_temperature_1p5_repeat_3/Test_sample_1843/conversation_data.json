    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, the prime power decomposition of $N$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$,\nwhere $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p^a$.\n\nFor the character $\\chi$ to be **primitive** with conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be a **primitive** character with conductor $p^a$.\n\nThe **order** of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\nWe are looking for characters where this order is 6.\n\nThis implies two conditions for the orders of the component characters, $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$:\n1.  Each order $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6 (i.e., $o_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$).\n2.  The set of orders must contain at least one order divisible by 2 and at least one order divisible by 3.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nWe now count the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor $p^a$, whose order divides 6. Let $\\psi_d(m)$ denote the number of primitive characters modulo $m$ of order $d$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A character modulo $p^a$ is primitive if it is not induced from a character modulo $p^{a-1}$. For a prime $p$, all non-principal characters are primitive.\n\n**For modulus 4 ($2^2$):**\nThe group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. There is one principal character (order 1, conductor 1) and one non-principal character (order 2). The non-principal character is primitive.\n*   $\\psi_2(4) = 1$. Its order is 2, which divides 6.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1 (and its order is 2).\n\n**For modulus 9 ($3^2$):**\nThe group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The orders of primitive characters modulo 9 must divide $\\phi(9)=6$. A character is primitive if it is not induced from a character modulo 3. The group of characters mod 3 has order $\\phi(3)=2$. The imprimitive characters mod 9 have orders 1 and 2.\nTherefore, primitive characters mod 9 can only have orders that do not divide 2 (except 1), or rather, orders that are not in the image of the character group mod 3.\nThe primitive characters mod 9 have orders 3 and 6.\n*   $\\psi_3(9) = \\phi(3) = 2$. (Order 3 divides 6).\n*   $\\psi_6(9) = \\phi(6) = 2$. (Order 6 divides 6).\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2=4$ (orders are 3 or 6).\n\n**For modulus 7 ($7^1$):**\nThe group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. We need to find those with orders dividing 6. These are orders 2, 3, and 6.\n*   $\\psi_2(7) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   $\\psi_3(7) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   $\\psi_6(7) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n**For modulus 11 ($11^1$):**\nThe group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. We need primitive characters whose order divides 6. The order $d$ must divide both 10 and 6, so $d$ must divide $\\text{gcd}(10, 6) = 2$. A primitive character cannot have order 1, so its order must be 2.\n*   $\\psi_2(11) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1 (and its order is 2).\n\n**For modulus 13 ($13^1$):**\nThe group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. We need primitive characters whose order divides 6. The order $d$ must divide both 12 and 6, so $d$ must divide $\\text{gcd}(12, 6) = 6$. A primitive character cannot have order 1, so its order can be 2, 3, or 6.\n*   $\\psi_2(13) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   $\\psi_3(13) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   $\\psi_6(13) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Counts and Verify the LCM\nWe have the following number of choices for each primitive component character (with order dividing 6):\n*   For $\\chi_4$: 1 choice (order 2)\n*   For $\\chi_9$: 4 choices (orders 3 or 6)\n*   For $\\chi_7$: 5 choices (orders 2, 3, or 6)\n*   For $\\chi_{11}$: 1 choice (order 2)\n*   For $\\chi_{13}$: 5 choices (orders 2, 3, or 6)\n\nNow we check if the lcm of the orders is always 6.\nLet the chosen characters have orders $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\n*   Since there is only one choice for $\\chi_4$, we must have $o_4 = 2$. This ensures the lcm is divisible by 2.\n*   For $\\chi_9$, the possible orders are 3 or 6. In either case, $o_9$ is divisible by 3. This ensures the lcm is divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6. As all individual orders divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6. Therefore, for any combination of the choices above, the lcm of the orders is exactly 6.\n\n*   **Careful point:** This verification is crucial. In this problem, every combination works. In other problems, one might need to use inclusion-exclusion to exclude combinations where the lcm is not the target value.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal Number = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
