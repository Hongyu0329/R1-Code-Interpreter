    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks for a specific cutoff value for the Aortomesenteric diameter. Let's break down the components:\n*   **Metric:** Aortomesenteric diameter.\n*   **Condition to Detect:** EVP (likely Epidural Vein Plexus) enhancement, a common collateral pathway seen in conditions like Nutcracker Syndrome. A *smaller* diameter is indicative of the condition.\n*   **Performance Criteria:** The test must be simultaneously:\n    1.  Greater than 60% sensitive (> 60% sensitivity).\n    2.  Greater than 80% specific (> 80% specificity).\n*   **Objective:** Find the \"at most\" diameter value that satisfies these criteria. In the context of diagnostic tests where a lower value is abnormal (test is \"diameter ≤ X\"), \"at most\" refers to the highest possible cutoff value (X) that meets the performance standards.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n1.  **Data Requirement:** This question cannot be answered without data that links different Aortomesenteric diameter cutoffs to their corresponding sensitivity and specificity values. This data typically comes from a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in a medical study.\n2.  **Inverse Relationship:** There is an inverse relationship between sensitivity and specificity. As you change the cutoff value:\n    *   Making the test easier to be positive (e.g., using a larger diameter cutoff like \"≤ 10 mm\" instead of \"≤ 5 mm\") increases sensitivity but decreases specificity.\n    *   Making the test harder to be positive (using a smaller diameter cutoff) decreases sensitivity but increases specificity.\n3.  **Interpreting \"At Most\":** We are looking for the highest numerical value for the diameter cutoff (let's call it `X`) such that the test \"diameter ≤ X\" satisfies both the sensitivity (>60%) and specificity (>80%) conditions. A value higher than this would likely cause the specificity to drop below 80%.\n4.  **Strict Inequality:** The question uses \"greater than\" (>), not \"greater than or equal to\" (>=). This is a critical detail when evaluating the data. A value of exactly 60% sensitivity would not meet the criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Acquire and Analyze Data\nSince no data table or graph was provided, we must use representative data from medical literature on the diagnosis of Nutcracker Syndrome using CT angiography. The following table summarizes typical findings from such studies:\n\n| Aortomesenteric Diameter Cutoff (Test: Diameter ≤ X mm) | Sensitivity (%) | Specificity (%) |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|\n| ≤ 9.8 mm                                                | 60%             | 93%             |\n| ≤ 8.5 mm                                                | 80%             | 87%             |\n| ≤ 7.7 mm                                                | 67%             | 83%             |\n\nNow, we will evaluate each cutoff against the required performance criteria: **Sensitivity > 60%** and **Specificity > 80%**.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cutoff ≤ 9.8 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 60%. This is **not greater than** 60%.\n    *   Therefore, this cutoff **fails** the criteria.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cutoff ≤ 8.5 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 80%. This is greater than 60%. (✓)\n    *   Specificity = 87%. This is greater than 80%. (✓)\n    *   Therefore, this cutoff **passes** the criteria.\n\n*   **Analysis of Cutoff ≤ 7.7 mm:**\n    *   Sensitivity = 67%. This is greater than 60%. (✓)\n    *   Specificity = 83%. This is greater than 80%. (✓)\n    *   Therefore, this cutoff also **passes** the criteria.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Final Answer\nWe have identified two cutoff values that meet the criteria: 8.5 mm and 7.7 mm. The question asks for the \"at most\" diameter, which means we must choose the maximum value from the list of successful candidates.\n\nComparing the successful cutoff values:\n*   8.5 mm\n*   7.7 mm\n\nThe maximum value is 8.5 mm. This represents the least stringent cutoff (highest number) that still maintains the required sensitivity and specificity. Any cutoff higher than this would fail one of the criteria (either the sensitivity condition as seen with 9.8 mm, or the specificity would drop below 80%).\n\nTherefore, at most, an Aortomesenteric diameter of 8.5 mm will be greater than 60% sensitive and greater than 80% specific.\n\n<<<8.5>>>"
