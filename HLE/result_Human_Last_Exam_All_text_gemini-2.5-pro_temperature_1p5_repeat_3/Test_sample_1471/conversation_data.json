    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user wants to find the solution to the equation `IV/XXX-MMMCMXCIX=?`. The equation is written using Roman numerals and standard mathematical operators. The task requires converting the Roman numerals to modern (Arabic) numbers, performing the calculations in the correct order, and providing the final answer as a modern number.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Roman Numeral Conversion:** It's crucial to correctly interpret the Roman numerals. The key values are I=1, V=5, X=10, L=50, C=100, D=500, M=1000. We must also apply the subtractive principle, where a smaller numeral placed before a larger one is subtracted (e.g., IV = 5 - 1 = 4; CM = 1000 - 100 = 900).\n2.  **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** The standard order of operations dictates that division must be performed before subtraction. Therefore, we must first calculate `IV / XXX` and then subtract `MMMCMXCIX` from the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers.**\n\n*   **IV:** The numeral `I` (1) comes before `V` (5), so we subtract: 5 - 1 = **4**.\n*   **XXX:** This is a simple addition: `X` (10) + `X` (10) + `X` (10) = **30**.\n*   **MMMCMXCIX:** This numeral is broken down as follows:\n    *   `MMM` = 1000 + 1000 + 1000 = 3000\n    *   `CM` = 1000 - 100 = 900\n    *   `XC` = 100 - 10 = 90\n    *   `IX` = 10 - 1 = 9\n    *   Adding these parts together: 3000 + 900 + 90 + 9 = **3999**.\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the equation with modern numbers.**\n\nSubstituting the converted numbers back into the equation, we get:\n`4 / 30 - 3999`\n\n**Step 3: Perform the calculation according to the order of operations.**\n\n*   **First, perform the division:**\n    `4 / 30 = 0.1333...` (The digit 3 repeats infinitely).\n    This can also be represented as the fraction `2/15`.\n\n*   **Next, perform the subtraction:**\n    `0.1333... - 3999`\n    The result is **-3998.8666...** (The digit 6 repeats infinitely).\n\nAs an exact fraction, the calculation would be:\n`2/15 - 3999 = 2/15 - 59985/15 = -59983/15`\n\nThe decimal representation, -3998.8666..., is the most common way to express such a number.\n\n<<< -3998.8666... >>>"
