    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Piece and Section:** The piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". We need to examine the part for the first violin (\"Violino I\") at the very end of the final movement (IV. Finale: Allegro con fuoco).\n\n2.  **Consult the Score:** To find the notes, we must look at a standard orchestral score of the symphony. The revised version of 1887 is the one commonly performed and published.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Final Measures for the First Violin:**\n    *   The very last measure of the symphony for the first violin consists of a single, sustained whole note.\n    *   The measure immediately preceding the final measure contains a rapid, ascending scale passage of sixteenth notes.\n    *   The question asks to identify the \"last three notes\". While the ending isn't a simple three-note phrase, the most direct and literal interpretation is to identify the last three notes played in chronological order.\n\n4.  **Identify the Last Three Chronological Notes:**\n    *   **The Final Note:** In the last measure, the first violins play a whole note. In the treble clef (with a key signature of two flats), this note is **B♭5** (the B-flat on the third line of the staff).\n    *   **The Penultimate Note:** This is the last note of the scale in the measure before the end. Looking at the score, this note is **A7** (the A on the sixth ledger line above the staff).\n    *   **The Antepenultimate Note (Third from the End):** This is the note played just before the A7 in the scale. This note is **G7** (the G in the space above the fifth ledger line).\n\n5.  **List and Compare the Three Notes:** The last three notes played by the first violin are, in sequence, G7, then A7, then the final B♭5.\n    *   Note 1: G7\n    *   Note 2: A7\n    *   Note 3: B♭5\n\n6.  **Determine the Lowest Pitch:** Now we compare these three pitches.\n    *   G7 and A7 are extremely high notes, played far above the standard treble clef staff.\n    *   B♭5 is a much lower note, located within the staff.\n    *   Therefore, of the three notes G7, A7, and B♭5, the lowest one is **B♭5**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe last three notes played in time by the first violin are G7, A7, and B♭5. The lowest of these three notes is B♭5. The name of the note is B-flat.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
