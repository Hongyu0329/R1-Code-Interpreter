The ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal ratio is generally found in the range of 0.25 to 0.5. For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS), a lower ratio, typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.15, is ideal to ensure stable doping and prevent phase segregation.
