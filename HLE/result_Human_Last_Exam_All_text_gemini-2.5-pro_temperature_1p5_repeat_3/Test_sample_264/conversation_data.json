    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Geometry and Set Up a Coordinate System**\nFirst, we need to define the two cubes in a coordinate system. For simplicity, let's place the first cube, Cube A, in the first octant with one corner at the origin.\n*   **Cube A:** Occupies the space defined by the inequalities:\n    *   `0 <= x <= 1`\n    *   `0 <= y <= 1`\n    *   `0 <= z <= 1`\nThis is a cube with a side length of 1, as specified in the question.\n\n**2. Interpret the Shift along the \"Main Diagonal\"**\nThis is the most critical part of the problem.\n*   A \"main diagonal\" of this cube connects opposite vertices, for example, the vertex at `(0,0,0)` and the vertex at `(1,1,1)`. The direction of this diagonal can be represented by the vector `d = (1, 1, 1)`.\n*   The problem states the cubes are \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". The most direct and common interpretation of this phrasing in geometric problems is that the displacement vector's components along each axis are 1/2.\n*   Therefore, the shift vector `s` is `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. This means the second cube, Cube B, is shifted from Cube A by `1/2` in the x-direction, `1/2` in the y-direction, and `1/2` in the z-direction.\n\n**3. Define the Position of the Second Cube**\nApplying the shift vector `s = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)` to Cube A, we find the coordinates for Cube B.\n*   **Cube B:** Occupies the space defined by:\n    *   `0 + 1/2 <= x <= 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 <= x <= 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 <= y <= 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 <= y <= 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 <= z <= 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 <= z <= 3/2`\n\n**4. Determine the Region of Intersection**\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where the two cubes overlap. A point `(x, y, z)` is in the intersection if and only if it satisfies the inequalities for both Cube A and Cube B. We find the overlapping range for each coordinate:\n*   **x-dimension:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]`, which simplifies to `[1/2, 1]`. The length of this interval is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   **y-dimension:** Similarly, the overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`. The length is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   **z-dimension:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`. The length is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\nThe region of intersection is a rectangular prism (specifically, a cube) defined by:\n*   `1/2 <= x <= 1`\n*   `1/2 <= y <= 1`\n*   `1/2 <= z <= 1`\nThe side lengths of this intersection cube are all `1/2`. The volume is the product of its side lengths.\n*   Volume = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Interpretation of the shift:** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is slightly ambiguous. The alternative interpretation is that the *distance* between the centers of the cubes is 1/2. This would lead to a shift vector with components of `1/(2√3)` and a much more complex answer: `(1 - 1/(2√3))^3`. However, the component-wise shift is the standard interpretation for such problems unless a specific distance is mentioned, and it leads to a much cleaner, fractional result.\n*   **Coordinate System Choice:** The choice of placing one cube at `[0,1]^3` simplifies the arithmetic significantly. Any other placement (e.g., centering one cube at the origin) would yield the same final result but might require more complex calculations for the boundaries.\n*   **Shape of the Intersection:** The intersection of two cubes aligned with the coordinate axes is always a rectangular prism (or degenerates to a plane, line, or point). In this specific case, the symmetry of the shift results in the intersection being a perfect cube.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe intersection forms a cube with a side length of 1/2.\nVolume = (Side Length)³ = (1/2)³ = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
