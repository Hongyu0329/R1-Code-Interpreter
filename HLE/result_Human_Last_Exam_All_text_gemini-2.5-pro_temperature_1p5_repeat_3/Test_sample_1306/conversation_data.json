    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage of irreducible representations among the indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ being a primitive third root of unity.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Algebra and the Category $C$\n\nThe question concerns the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let $\\ell=3$ be the order of $q^2$ (since $q^3=1$, $q^2 \\neq 1$, $(q^2)^3=1$, the order of $q^2$ is 3). The representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity is significantly different from the generic case (where $q$ is not a root of unity).\n\nThe phrasing \"the category $C$ of indecomposable finite-dimensional $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ representations\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1.  **The Full Quantum Group $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$:** This is the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group. Its representation theory is complex. The indecomposable representations fall into families parameterized by continuous variables (central characters). For instance, there is a 2-parameter family of irreducible \"cyclic\" representations, but also multi-parameter families of reducible indecomposable modules. In this context, \"percentage\" is ill-defined without specifying a measure on the parameter space. If one were to use the dimension of the parameter spaces, the generic indecomposable module is irreducible, which would lead to a percentage of 100%. This is likely not the intended interpretation due to its reliance on a sophisticated and ambiguous notion of \"percentage\".\n\n2.  **The Small Quantum Group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$:** This is the finite-dimensional Hopf subalgebra of $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ generated by $E, F, K$ with the additional relations $E^\\ell=0, F^\\ell=0, K^\\ell=1$. The representation theory of the small quantum group corresponds to the \"principal block\" of the full quantum group. This category is much better behaved: it has a finite number of indecomposable objects. This interpretation makes the calculation of a \"percentage\" straightforward and unambiguous. Given the phrasing, this is the most likely intended meaning of the question. The notation $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ itself often refers to this small quantum group.\n\nWe will proceed with the second interpretation.\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Indecomposable Representations\n\nLet $C$ be the category of finite-dimensional representations of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ with $\\ell=3$. A key result in the representation theory of small quantum groups is the classification and counting of their indecomposable modules.\n\n*   **Result:** For the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ where $q$ is a primitive $2\\ell$-th root of unity (which corresponds to $q^2$ being a primitive $\\ell$-th root), the number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules is known to be $\\ell(\\ell-1)$.\n\nIn our case, $q$ is a primitive 3rd root of unity, so $q^2$ is also a primitive 3rd root of unity. We have $\\ell=3$.\n\n*   **Total number of indecomposable objects:** Using the formula, the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable objects in $C$ is $\\ell(\\ell-1) = 3(3-1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Irreducible Representations\n\nNext, we need to find how many of these indecomposable representations are irreducible (or simple).\n\n*   **Result:** The simple objects in the category $C$ are denoted by $L_1, L_2, \\dots, L_{\\ell-1}$. The dimension of $L_d$ is $d$.\n\nFor $\\ell=3$, the simple objects are $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n\n*   **Total number of irreducible objects:** The number of non-isomorphic irreducible objects in $C$ is $\\ell-1 = 3-1 = 2$.\n\nIt's important to remember that every irreducible representation is, by definition, indecomposable.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Percentage\n\nNow we have the necessary counts to calculate the percentage.\n\n*   Total number of indecomposable objects in $C$: 6\n*   Number of irreducible objects in $C$: 2\n\nThe percentage of objects in $C$ that are irreducible is the ratio of the number of irreducible objects to the total number of indecomposable objects, multiplied by 100.\n\nPercentage = (Number of Irreducible Objects / Total Number of Indecomposable Objects) × 100%\nPercentage = (2 / 6) × 100%\nPercentage = (1 / 3) × 100%\nPercentage = 33.333... %\n\nThe question asks for the percentage value.\n\nFinal calculation: $100 / 3$."
