    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue: Andrei Voznesensky called this man \"a joy-discovering sailor\".**\n*   **Careful Point:** The quote is from a famous Russian poet, Andrei Voznesensky. This suggests the subject is likely a figure of importance in Russian history or culture.\n*   **Analysis:** The term \"sailor\" points to a navigator, explorer, or someone involved in maritime expeditions. \"Joy-discovering\" is a poetic phrase suggesting he was a pioneer who found new lands, people, or opportunities, bringing \"joy\" or hope.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue: Voznesensky wondered, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"**\n*   **Careful Point:** This is a very specific and crucial clue. It means that at the time Voznesensky wrote his work, the man's burial site was lost or unknown.\n*   **Analysis:** This narrows down the candidates to historical figures whose final resting places were a mystery for a long period. This line comes from the libretto Voznesensky wrote for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third clue: \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"**\n*   **Careful Point:** This provides a specific time frame for the discovery or identification of the grave. The late 1980s corresponds to the era of Glasnost and Perestroika in the Soviet Union, a time when many historical facts were being re-examined.\n*   **Analysis:** We need to find an explorer, lauded by Voznesensky in \"Juno and Avos,\" whose lost grave was located or had a memorial established in the late 1980s.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the clues to identify the man.**\n*   The subject of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian diplomat and explorer **Nikolai Rezanov** (1764-1807).\n*   Rezanov was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and led an expedition to California, which fits the description of a \"sailor.\"\n*   He died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on his journey back to St. Petersburg. He was buried at the cemetery of the Resurrection Cathedral. This cathedral was demolished by the Soviet government in the 1930s, and his grave was lost. This perfectly matches the clue about his unknown grave.\n*   The immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos\" sparked public interest in finding his grave. In the late 1980s, during Perestroika, a search campaign began. While his exact remains were not definitively identified, a memorial cross (a cenotaph) was erected in 1989 at the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk, where remains from the old cathedral cemetery were believed to have been reinterred. This event provided a public \"answer\" to the poetic question from the opera, fitting the timeline exactly.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer.**\nThe man described in the question is Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
