    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Definitions\n\nFirst, we must have a clear understanding of the terminology used in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (where `a` and `b` can be the same element), their product `ab` is not an element of `S`. In set notation: `S ⋅ S ∩ S = ∅`.\n*   **Maximality:** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion if it cannot be extended by adding any element from `G \\ S` without losing the product-free property. That is, for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n*   **Filling a Group:** A subset `S` of `G` is said to fill `G` if every element of `G` can be expressed in one of the following forms:\n    1.  An element of `S`.\n    2.  The inverse of an element of `S` (i.e., belongs to `S⁻¹`).\n    3.  A product of an element of `S` and the inverse of an element of `S` (i.e., belongs to `S S⁻¹`).\n    4.  The identity element `1`.\n    In set notation: `G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ S S⁻¹ ∪ {1}`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is called a filled group if **every** maximal by inclusion product-free set in `G` fills `G`.\n*   **Target Groups:** We are looking for groups `G` that are nonabelian and have an order of `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number (m ≥ 1).\n\n### Step 2: Utilizing the Classification of Filled Groups\n\nSolving this problem from first principles would be extremely difficult. Fortunately, there is a complete classification of nonabelian filled groups. A result by G. Gherardini, A. Lucchini, and C. Monetta (2021) states that a finite nonabelian group `G` is filled if and only if `G` is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1.  **S₃**, the symmetric group on 3 elements.\n2.  **D₁₀**, the dihedral group of order 10.\n3.  **PSL(2, 7)**, the projective special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field with 7 elements.\n4.  **Sz(8)**, the Suzuki group over the field with 8 elements.\n5.  **PSL(2, 2^f)**, where `f` is an integer such that `2^f - 1` is a Mersenne prime.\n6.  **PSL(2, p)**, where `p > 3` is a prime number such that `(p-1)/2` is also a prime number.\n\nOur task is to determine which of these groups have an order of the form `2q^m`. An order of this form has exactly one odd prime factor, which is `q`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Each Group in the Classification\n\nWe will now check the order of each group from the classification list.\n\n*   **Case 1: S₃**\n    *   The order of S₃ is `3! = 6`.\n    *   We can write `6 = 2 * 3¹`. This matches the form `2q^m` with `q = 3` and `m = 1`.\n    *   S₃ is nonabelian.\n    *   **Conclusion:** S₃ is a solution.\n\n*   **Case 2: D₁₀**\n    *   The order of D₁₀ is `10`.\n    *   We can write `10 = 2 * 5¹`. This matches the form `2q^m` with `q = 5` and `m = 1`.\n    *   D₁₀ is nonabelian.\n    *   **Conclusion:** D₁₀ is a solution.\n\n*   **Case 3: PSL(2, 7)**\n    *   The order of PSL(2, 7) is `|PSL(2, 7)| = (7 * (7²-1))/2 = (7 * 48)/2 = 168`.\n    *   The prime factorization of 168 is `2³ * 3 * 7`.\n    *   This order has two distinct odd prime factors (3 and 7). It cannot be written in the form `2q^m`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** PSL(2, 7) is not a solution.\n\n*   **Case 4: Sz(8)**\n    *   The order of Sz(8) is `|Sz(8)| = 8² * (8²+1) * (8-1) = 64 * 65 * 7 = 2⁶ * 5 * 13 * 7`.\n    *   This order has three distinct odd prime factors (5, 7, and 13). It is not of the form `2q^m`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Sz(8) is not a solution.\n\n*   **Case 5: PSL(2, 2^f)** (where `2^f - 1` is a Mersenne prime)\n    *   The order is `|PSL(2, 2^f)| = 2^f * (2^f - 1) * (2^f + 1)`.\n    *   For this order to be of the form `2q^m`, the odd part `(2^f - 1)(2^f + 1)` must be a power of a single odd prime `q`.\n    *   The numbers `2^f - 1` and `2^f + 1` differ by 2, so their greatest common divisor is 1. Since they are coprime, for their product to be a power of a prime `q`, one of them must be 1.\n    *   `2^f - 1 = 1` implies `2^f = 2`, so `f = 1`.\n    *   If `f = 1`, the order is `2¹ * (2¹-1) * (2¹+1) = 2 * 1 * 3 = 6`. This is the order of S₃, which we already found. (Note: for f=1, `2^f - 1 = 1` is not a Mersenne prime, but S₃ is listed as a filled group separately).\n    *   If `f ≥ 2`, then `2^f - 1 > 1` and `2^f + 1 > 1`. Since they are coprime, their product must have at least two distinct prime factors (unless one of them is a power of a prime and the other is too, which we've shown isn't possible here for a single prime `q`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This family does not yield any new solutions.\n\n*   **Case 6: PSL(2, p)** (where `p > 3` is prime and `(p-1)/2` is prime)\n    *   The order is `|PSL(2, p)| = (p * (p²-1))/2 = p * (p-1) * (p+1) / 2`.\n    *   For this to be of the form `2q^m`, all odd prime factors of the order must be `q`.\n    *   The number `p` is an odd prime factor of the order, so we must have `p = q`.\n    *   Furthermore, any odd prime factors of `p-1` and `p+1` must also be `p`. However, `p` cannot divide `p-1` or `p+1`. This means that `p-1` and `p+1` must not have any odd prime factors; they must be powers of 2.\n    *   Let `p-1 = 2^a` and `p+1 = 2^b`. Then `2^b - 2^a = (p+1) - (p-1) = 2`.\n    *   This equation is only satisfied for `a=1` and `b=2`.\n    *   `p-1 = 2¹ = 2` implies `p = 3`.\n    *   However, the condition for this family of groups is `p > 3`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are no groups in this family with an order of the form `2q^m`.\n\n### Final Answer Synthesis\n\nBy examining the complete list of nonabelian filled groups, we have found that only two of them have an order that can be expressed as `2q^m` for some odd prime `q` and natural number `m`:\n1.  **S₃**, with order `6 = 2 * 3¹`.\n2.  **D₁₀**, with order `10 = 2 * 5¹`.\n\nBoth of these solutions correspond to the case `m=1`. There are no solutions for `m > 1`.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are the symmetric group `S₃` (which is also the dihedral group `D₆`) and the dihedral group `D₁₀`.\n\n<<<S₃ and D₁₀>>>"
