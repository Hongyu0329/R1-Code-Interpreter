    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem Definition**\n    *   We are asked for the Crawley-Nordström invariant of a Calabi-Yau link.\n    *   The link is defined as the intersection of a hypersurface `V(F)` with the unit sphere in $\\mathbb{C}^5$.\n    *   The ambient space is defined by 5 variables `(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)` with weights `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n    *   The defining polynomial is given as: $F = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$.\n\n2.  **Verify the Quasi-Homogeneity and Calabi-Yau Condition**\n    *   For the variety to be well-defined in a weighted projective space, the polynomial `F` must be quasi-homogeneous, meaning all its monomials must have the same weighted degree, `d`.\n    *   Let's calculate the degree of each monomial using the weights `w_i`:\n        *   `deg(z_1^8z_3)` = 8 * `w_1` + 1 * `w_3` = 8 * 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = **225**\n        *   `deg(z_1^4z_2^3z_3)` = 4 * `w_1` + 3 * `w_2` + 1 * `w_3` = 4 * 22 + 3 * 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = **224**\n        *   `deg(z_1z_2^7)` = 1 * `w_1` + 7 * `w_2` = 22 + 7 * 29 = 22 + 203 = **225**\n        *   `deg(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5)` = `w_1` + `w_2` + `w_3` + `w_4` + `w_5` = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = **225**\n        *   `deg(z_2z_3^4)` = 1 * `w_2` + 4 * `w_3` = 29 + 4 * 49 = 29 + 196 = **225**\n        *   `deg(z_4^3z_5)` = 3 * `w_4` + 1 * `w_5` = 3 * 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = **225**\n        *   `deg(z_5^3)` = 3 * `w_5` = 3 * 75 = **225**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The monomial `z_1^4z_2^3z_3` has a degree of 224, which is different from the other monomials (degree 225). For the problem to be well-posed, we must assume this is a typographical error in the question. We will proceed by omitting this term, so the polynomial is quasi-homogeneous with degree `d = 225`.\n    *   The Calabi-Yau condition requires the degree `d` to equal the sum of the weights, `Σw_i`.\n    *   `Σw_i` = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225.\n    *   Since `d = 225 = Σw_i`, the singularity is indeed of the Calabi-Yau type.\n\n3.  **Identify the Formula for the Crawley-Nordström Invariant**\n    *   The link `K` associated with an isolated hypersurface singularity in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ is a `(2n-3)`-dimensional manifold. Here `n=5`, so `K` is a 7-manifold. Such links are `(n-2)`-connected, so `K` is 3-connected.\n    *   For a 3-connected 7-manifold link `K`, the Crawley-Nordström invariant `ν(K)` is given by the formula:\n        $ν(K) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mu(F) - \\sigma(F))$\n        where `μ(F)` is the Milnor number and `σ(F)` is the signature of the Milnor fiber of the singularity `F=0`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Milnor Number (μ)**\n    *   The Milnor number for an isolated quasi-homogeneous singularity is calculated using the formula:\n        $μ(F) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{d}{w_i} - 1 \\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{d - w_i}{w_i}$\n    *   For `n=5`, `d=225`, and `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`:\n        $μ = \\left( \\frac{225-22}{22} \\right) \\left( \\frac{225-29}{29} \\right) \\left( \\frac{225-49}{49} \\right) \\left( \\frac{225-50}{50} \\right) \\left( \\frac{225-75}{75} \\right)$\n        $μ = \\left( \\frac{203}{22} \\right) \\left( \\frac{196}{29} \\right) \\left( \\frac{176}{49} \\right) \\left( \\frac{175}{50} \\right) \\left( \\frac{150}{75} \\right)$\n    *   **Careful Point:** The individual terms are fractions. The final product should be an integer. Let's simplify the expression.\n        $μ = \\left( \\frac{203}{22} \\right) \\left( \\frac{196}{29} \\right) \\left( \\frac{176}{49} \\right) \\left( \\frac{7}{2} \\right) (2)$\n    *   We use prime factorizations to cancel terms:\n        *   `203 = 7 × 29`\n        *   `22 = 2 × 11`\n        *   `196 = 4 × 49 = 2^2 × 7^2`\n        *   `176 = 16 × 11 = 2^4 × 11`\n    *   Substituting these into the product:\n        $μ = \\frac{7 \\times 29}{2 \\times 11} \\times \\frac{2^2 \\times 7^2}{29} \\times \\frac{2^4 \\times 11}{7^2} \\times \\frac{7}{2} \\times 2$\n    *   Cancel out common factors in the numerator and denominator: `29`, `11`, `7^2`, `2`, `2`.\n        $μ = (7) \\times (2^2) \\times (2^4/2) \\times (7) = 7 \\times 4 \\times 8 \\times 7 = 49 \\times 32$\n    *   $μ = 1568$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Signature (σ)**\n    *   A significant theorem in singularity theory states that for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface singularity defined in $\\mathbb{C}^n$, the signature `σ(F)` of its Milnor fiber is zero if the number of variables `n` is odd.\n    *   In this problem, the singularity is in $\\mathbb{C}^5$, so `n=5`, which is odd.\n    *   Therefore, the signature is `σ(F) = 0`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Invariant**\n    *   Now substitute the values of `μ` and `σ` into the formula for `ν(K)`:\n        $ν(K) = \\frac{1}{2} (μ(F) - σ(F))$\n        $ν(K) = \\frac{1}{2} (1568 - 0)$\n        $ν(K) = \\frac{1568}{2}$\n        $ν(K) = 784$\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{784}$.\n<<<784>>>"
