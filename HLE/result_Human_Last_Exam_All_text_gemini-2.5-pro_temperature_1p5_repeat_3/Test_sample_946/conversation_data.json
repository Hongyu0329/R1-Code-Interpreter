    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\n*   **Main Subject:** An online cartoon series.\n*   **Series Name:** \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Event within the Episode:** The Junior prom.\n*   **Object of Interest:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Role of the Object:** It is \"performing\".\n*   **Information to Find:** The name of the fictional singer the cutout represents.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Context of \"Teen Girl Squad\"**\n*   \"Teen Girl Squad\" is a recurring segment within the \"Homestar Runner\" universe.\n*   It is crudely drawn by Strong Bad on loose-leaf paper.\n*   The humor is based on mocking stereotypes of teenage girls and their dramatic lives, often ending in comical \"deaths\".\n*   The low-budget, hand-drawn style is a key feature, making a cardboard cutout for a prom performer a fitting joke.\n\n**Step 3: Locate and Review \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"**\n*   The episode's plot centers on the four main characters (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attending their junior prom.\n*   During the prom scene, the entertainment is announced.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\n*   Upon arriving at the prom (or \"prum\" as it's called), Cheerleader excitedly points out the musical act.\n*   Her dialogue is: \"And look who's playing! It's popular musician, Kaisa!\"\n*   The visual then cuts to the stage, where there is a cardboard cutout of a female singer with a guitar. The name \"KAISA\" is written on the bass drum of the drum set behind the cutout.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Information to Form the Answer**\n*   The dialogue explicitly names the performer as \"Kaisa\".\n*   The visual confirms the name \"KAISA\" on the stage equipment.\n*   The question is answered directly by this scene in the cartoon.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Source Specificity:** The answer must be derived *only* from Teen Girl Squad #15, not from general Homestar Runner lore or other episodes.\n*   **Fictional Context:** Kaisa is a fictional musician *within* the fictional Homestar Runner universe.\n*   **Exact Name:** The name is \"Kaisa\", as spelled out in the cartoon.\n*   **The \"Performer\" is a Prop:** It is critical to remember the performer is a cardboard cutout, as the question states. This is central to the joke in the episode.\n\n<<<Kaisa>>>"
