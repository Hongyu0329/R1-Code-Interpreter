    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n**1. Identify the Meter**\nThe line is from Plautus and is a **Trochaic Septenarius**. This meter consists of seven full trochaic feet followed by a final, incomplete (catalectic) foot. The basic pattern is:\n`L S | L S | L S | L S || L S | L S | L S | L`\n(Where L = Long, S = Short, and || = the main break or *diaeresis*).\nPlautine meter allows for frequent substitutions and resolutions.\n\n**2. Key Metrical Principles to Apply**\n*   **Vowel Quantity**: Determine if each vowel is naturally long or short.\n*   **Position**: A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two consonants (e.g., \"**et** tibi\", \"**es**-se\", \"**sit** male\").\n*   **Iambic Shortening**: A common feature in Plautus where a word with an iambic pattern (`S L`) and a primary accent on the first syllable is scanned as a pyrrhic (`S S`). This applies to `bene` (originally `bĕnē`, `S L`), which is regularly scanned as `bĕnĕ` (`S S`).\n*   **Hiatus (No Elision)**: Although a final vowel before an initial vowel usually elides, in this line, the `e` of `bene` and the `e` of `esse` do not elide. The line has 15 syllables, fitting the trochaic septenarius pattern.\n*   **Substitutions**: A trochaic foot (`L S`) can be replaced by:\n    *   A spondee (`L L`)\n    *   A dactyl (`L S S`)\n    *   A tribrach (`S S S`) as a resolution of the long syllable (`L` -> `SS`).\n\n**3. Foot-by-Foot Scansion**\n\nLet's break the line down according to these rules:\n`et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n\n*   **Foot 1: `et ti-`**\n    *   `et`: Long by position (followed by `t`). **L**\n    *   `ti-`: The first syllable of `tibi` is short by nature. **S**\n    *   Result: `L S` (a perfect Trochee).\n\n*   **Foot 2: `-bi bene`**\n    *   We apply iambic shortening to `bene` -> `bĕnĕ` (`S S`).\n    *   The syllables are `-bi` (S), `be-` (S), `-ne` (S).\n    *   Result: `S S S` (a Tribrach), which is a valid resolution/substitution for a trochee.\n\n*   **Foot 3: `esse`**\n    *   `es-`: Long by position (followed by `ss`). **L**\n    *   `-se`: The final `e` of `esse` is short. **S**\n    *   Result: `L S` (a perfect Trochee).\n\n*   **Foot 4: `soli`**\n    *   `so-`: The 'o' is long by nature. **L**\n    *   `-li`: The final 'i' (dative ending) is long by nature. **L**\n    *   Result: `L L` (a Spondee), a valid substitution for a trochee. (The diaeresis occurs after this foot).\n\n*   **Foot 5: `quom sibi`**\n    *   `quom`: Long by nature and position. **L**\n    *   `si-`: Short by nature. **S**\n    *   `-bi`: Short by nature. **S**\n    *   Result: `L S S` (a Dactyl), a valid substitution for a trochee.\n\n*   **Foot 6: `sit ma-`**\n    *   `sit`: Long by position (followed by `m`). **L**\n    *   `ma-`: The first syllable of `male` is short by nature. **S**\n    *   Result: `L S` (a perfect Trochee).\n\n*   **Foot 7.5 (Catalexis): `-le`**\n    *   The final syllable of the line. The final `-e` of the adverb `male` is long by nature. **L**\n    *   Result: `L` (the final catalectic syllable).\n\n**Final Scansion**\nCombining the feet gives the following pattern:\nTrochee | Tribrach | Trochee | Spondee || Dactyl | Trochee | Catalectic Syllable\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
