    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory usage of its variables.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Core Task:** The objective is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two input strings of the same length. The program should output -1, 1, or 0 based on the comparison result.\n\n2.  **Input/Output Strategy:**\n    *   **Input:** The program receives two strings on two separate lines.\n    *   **Comparison:** To compare the strings character by character (e.g., the 5th character of string 1 with the 5th of string 2), the program needs access to both characters simultaneously.\n    *   **Memory Implication:** Since standard input is a single sequential stream, you read the first string, and then you read the second. You cannot \"go back\" in the input stream. Therefore, to compare the second string against the first, the first string must be stored in memory (in a buffer). The most straightforward approach is to read both strings into separate memory buffers.\n\n3.  **Determining Memory for String Buffers:**\n    *   **Constraint:** The strings' lengths range from 1 to 100 characters.\n    *   **C String Requirement:** In C, strings are stored as arrays of characters terminated by a special null character (`\\0`). To store a string of up to 100 characters, the array must have a size of at least `100 + 1 = 101`.\n    *   **Variable Declaration:** We need two buffers, one for each string.\n        *   `char string1[101];`\n        *   `char string2[101];`\n    *   **Memory Calculation:** The `sizeof(char)` is guaranteed to be 1 byte in C.\n        *   Memory for `string1`: 101 * 1 byte = 101 bytes.\n        *   Memory for `string2`: 101 * 1 byte = 101 bytes.\n        *   Total for buffers = 202 bytes.\n\n4.  **Implementing the Comparison Logic:**\n    *   A loop is needed to iterate through the strings from the first character to the last.\n    *   Inside the loop, for each position `i`, we compare the characters `string1[i]` and `string2[i]`.\n    *   The comparison must be case-insensitive. The standard C function `tolower()` from `<ctype.h>` is suitable for converting characters to lowercase for comparison.\n\n5.  **Optimizing Memory for Helper Variables:**\n    *   **Loop Counter:** The loop needs an index variable, say `i`. This index will go from 0 up to 99 (for a 100-character string). The smallest integer type in C is `char`. A `char` can store values from -128 to 127 (or 0 to 255 if unsigned), which is more than enough for our index. Using `char` instead of `int` (typically 4 bytes) is more memory-efficient.\n        *   `char i;`\n        *   Memory for `i`: `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n    *   **Temporary Comparison Variables:** When comparing `tolower(string1[i])` with `tolower(string2[i])`, one could store these intermediate values in temporary variables. However, to be maximally memory-efficient, we should avoid this. The comparison can be done directly within the `if` condition: `if (tolower(string1[i]) < tolower(string2[i])) ...`. This avoids allocating stack space for extra variables.\n\n### Listing Careful Points\n\n*   **Null Terminator:** Always remember to account for the `\\0` null terminator when calculating buffer size for C strings. A 100-character string needs a 101-byte buffer.\n*   **Input Reading:** The standard `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` function is appropriate here. It stops at whitespace, automatically handling the newline between the two input strings.\n*   **Data Types:** To minimize memory, choose the smallest possible data type for each variable that can safely hold the required range of values. The loop index only needs to go up to 99, so `char` is sufficient and better than `int`.\n*   **Variable Scope:** Avoid declaring unnecessary variables. Performing operations directly in expressions (like `if (tolower(...) < tolower(...))`) is more memory-frugal than creating temporary variables to hold intermediate results.\n*   **Function Libraries:** Using standard library functions like `tolower` is perfectly acceptable and does not add to the variable memory count of *your* program. The question asks for memory used by *variables*.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the analysis, the most memory-efficient C program would declare the following variables in its `main` function:\n\n1.  `char s1[101];` -> Memory: 101 bytes\n2.  `char s2[101];` -> Memory: 101 bytes\n3.  `char i;`      -> Memory: 1 byte (for the loop index)\n\nThe total memory `m` used for these variables is the sum:\nm = 101 + 101 + 1 = 203 bytes.\n\n<<<203>>>"
