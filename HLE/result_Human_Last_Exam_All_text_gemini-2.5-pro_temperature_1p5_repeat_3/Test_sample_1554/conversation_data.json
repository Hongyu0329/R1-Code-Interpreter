    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific philosopher who meets three criteria:\n1.  They belong to the **Lviv-Warsaw School** of philosophy.\n2.  They analyzed the concept of a **\"hallmark\"** (or more broadly, a \"sign\" or \"indicator\").\n3.  They decomposed this concept into two distinct categories: **\"symptoms\"** and **\"signals\"**.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Key Concepts**\n*   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This was a highly influential school of logic and analytical philosophy in Poland between the World Wars. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. Our answer must be one of these or a closely associated philosopher.\n*   **Hallmark/Sign (Polish: *Znak*):** This is the general term for something that stands for or indicates something else. The philosopher in question took this broad category and divided it.\n*   **Symptom (Polish: *Objaw*):** This is a type of sign that has a natural, causal connection to what it signifies. The relationship is not arbitrary. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire because fire causes smoke. A high temperature is a symptom of an infection.\n*   **Signal (Polish: *Sygnał* or *Znak umowny* - \"conventional sign\"):** This is a type of sign whose meaning is established by convention, agreement, or a rule. The relationship is arbitrary. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; there is no natural reason why red means \"stop\"—it's a human-made rule. Words in a language are also signals.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School**\nWe need to find the philosopher whose work in semantics or semiotics (the theory of signs) includes this specific distinction.\n*   **Kazimierz Twardowski:** The founder of the school, he was focused on epistemology and the distinction between the content and object of a presentation. While he established the school's commitment to clarity, this specific semiotic distinction is not his main contribution.\n*   **Tadeusz Kotarbiński:** Known for reism and praxiology. He did work on semiotics, but the explicit and systematic division of signs into symptoms and signals is more famously attributed to another member.\n*   **Alfred Tarski & Jan Łukasiewicz:** They were primarily logicians. While logic is the study of formal sign systems, their work did not focus on the philosophical distinction between natural and conventional signs in this manner.\n*   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz:** He was a leading figure in the school, focusing on philosophy of language, epistemology, and the methodology of science. His work extensively analyzed language, meaning, and inference. He is the philosopher most renowned for making a clear, systematic distinction between different types of signs.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the Attribution**\nIn his works, particularly those concerning logic and language (like *Pragmatic Logic*), Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz explicitly analyzes the concept of a sign (*znak*). He divides signs into two main categories:\n1.  **Natural Signs (Symptoms - *Objawy*):** Signs linked to what they signify by a natural, causal law.\n2.  **Conventional Signs (Signals - *Sygnały* or *Znaki umowne*):** Signs whose meaning is based on human convention or rule.\nThis distinction was fundamental to his pragmatic theory of meaning and his analysis of how we infer knowledge from evidence (signs). Therefore, he is the correct philosopher.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the notion of a hallmark (or sign) into symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
