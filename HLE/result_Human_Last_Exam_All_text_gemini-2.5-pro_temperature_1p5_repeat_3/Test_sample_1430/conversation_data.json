    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe question asks for the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group of `X = C^(15)`, where `C` is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n1.  **C**: A compact Riemann surface, which is equivalent to a smooth complex projective algebraic curve. Its genus is `g = 3`.\n2.  **X = C^(15)**: This is the 15th symmetric power of `C`. A point in `X` represents an effective divisor of degree 15 on `C`. `X` is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension `d=15`.\n3.  **Neron-Severi Group NS(X)**: This is the group of divisors on `X` modulo algebraic equivalence. For a smooth complex projective variety, `NS(X)` is a finitely generated abelian group.\n4.  **Rank of NS(X)**: This is the Picard number of `X`, denoted `ρ(X)`. It is the rank of the Neron-Severi group as a free abelian group. Over the complex numbers, `ρ(X) = h^(1,1)(X)`, the dimension of the space of Hodge classes of type (1,1).\n5.  **\"Smallest and largest possible\"**: This wording implies that `ρ(X)` is not a fixed number for all genus 3 curves but depends on the specific properties of the curve `C`. Our task is to find the minimum and maximum values that `ρ(X)` can take as `C` varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  The structure of the symmetric power `C^(d)` depends on the relation between the degree `d` and the genus `g`.\n2.  The Picard number `ρ(X)` is related to the geometry of `X`, which in turn is determined by the geometry of `C`.\n3.  The Picard number of the Jacobian variety `Jac(C)` of a curve `C` is not constant; it depends on whether `C` is \"generic\" or has special properties like Complex Multiplication (CM).\n4.  The relationship between `ρ(C^(d))` and `ρ(Jac(C))` is central to solving the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Relate the variety `X = C^(15)` to the Jacobian of `C`**\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of algebraic curves describes the structure of symmetric powers `C^(d)`. For a curve `C` of genus `g`, when the degree `d` is large enough, `C^(d)` has a very specific structure in relation to the Jacobian of `C`, `Jac(C)`.\n\nThe condition is `d ≥ 2g - 1`.\nIn our case, `g = 3` and `d = 15`. We check the condition:\n`2g - 1 = 2(3) - 1 = 5`.\nSince `15 ≥ 5`, the condition is satisfied.\n\nFor `d ≥ 2g - 1`, the symmetric power `C^(d)` is a projective bundle over the Jacobian `Jac(C)`. Specifically, it is a `P^(d-g)`-bundle over `Jac(C)`.\nHere, `X = C^(15)` is a `P^(15-3)`-bundle, i.e., a `P^12`-bundle over `Jac(C)`. Let's denote this bundle map by `π: X -> Jac(C)`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi group of `X` to that of `Jac(C)`**\n\nFor a `P^n`-bundle `π: E -> B`, the Picard group of the total space `E` is related to the Picard group of the base `B` by a short exact sequence that splits. This leads to an isomorphism:\n`Pic(E) ≅ π^*(Pic(B)) ⊕ Z`\nwhere the `Z` summand is generated by the relative hyperplane bundle `O_E(1)`.\n\nApplying this to our case (`E=X`, `B=Jac(C)`):\n`Pic(X) ≅ π^*(Pic(Jac(C))) ⊕ Z`\n\nThe Neron-Severi group is the quotient of the Picard group by its identity component, `NS(V) = Pic(V) / Pic^0(V)`.\n`Pic^0(X) ≅ π^*(Pic^0(Jac(C)))`.\nTaking the quotient, we get:\n`NS(X) ≅ π^*(NS(Jac(C))) ⊕ Z`.\n\nSince `π` is a surjective map with connected fibers, the pullback map `π^*: NS(Jac(C)) -> NS(X)` is injective. Therefore, we can compare their ranks:\n`rank(NS(X)) = rank(NS(Jac(C))) + 1`\nor, in terms of Picard numbers:\n`ρ(X) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1`\n\nThis crucial formula reduces the problem to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of `ρ(Jac(C))` for a curve `C` of genus 3.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the range of `ρ(Jac(C))`**\n\n`Jac(C)` is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension `g=3`. The rank of its Neron-Severi group, `ρ(Jac(C))`, depends on the structure of its endomorphism ring, `End(Jac(C))`. Specifically, `ρ(Jac(C))` is the rank of the group of symmetric endomorphisms.\n\n**Case A: The Smallest Possible Rank**\n\nThe smallest possible rank occurs for a **generic** curve `C`. A generic curve of genus `g=3` is non-hyperelliptic and its Jacobian has the smallest possible endomorphism ring, which is `End(Jac(C)) ≅ Z`. These endomorphisms correspond to multiplication by integers, `[n]: P -> nP`, which are symmetric.\nIn this case, `NS(Jac(C))` is generated by the class of the theta divisor, so `NS(Jac(C)) ≅ Z`.\nThus, the minimum possible rank is `ρ(Jac(C)) = rank(Z) = 1`.\n\nUsing the formula from Step 2, the smallest rank for `ρ(X)` is:\n`ρ(X)_min = ρ(Jac(C))_min + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n**Case B: The Largest Possible Rank**\n\nThe largest possible rank occurs for a very **special** curve `C`, one whose Jacobian `Jac(C)` has many endomorphisms (Complex Multiplication).\n\nThe Picard number of any abelian variety `A` of dimension `g` is bounded by the Hodge number `h^(1,1)(A)`. For an abelian variety, `h^(1,1)(A) = g^2`.\nFor `Jac(C)`, `g=3`, so `ρ(Jac(C)) ≤ h^(1,1)(Jac(C)) = 3^2 = 9`.\n\nThis upper bound `ρ(Jac(C)) = g^2` is achieved if `Jac(C)` is of CM-type and is isogenous to a product of `g` copies of a single elliptic curve with CM, i.e., `Jac(C) ~ E^3` where `E` has complex multiplication.\n\nThere exist genus 3 curves whose Jacobians attain this maximum Picard number. For example, the Klein quartic curve, defined by `x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0`, is a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve `E` with CM by `Z[ζ_7]`, the ring of integers in the 7th cyclotomic field. For such a curve, `ρ(Jac(C)) = 9`.\n\nThus, the maximum possible rank is `ρ(Jac(C)) = 9`.\n\nUsing the formula from Step 2, the largest rank for `ρ(X)` is:\n`ρ(X)_max = ρ(Jac(C))_max + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\n### Final Answer Conclusion\n\n*   The smallest rank `ρ(X)` corresponds to a generic genus 3 curve `C`, for which `ρ(Jac(C)) = 1`. This gives `ρ(X) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   The largest rank `ρ(X)` corresponds to a special genus 3 curve `C` whose Jacobian has maximal complex multiplication, for which `ρ(Jac(C)) = g^2 = 9`. This gives `ρ(X) = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
