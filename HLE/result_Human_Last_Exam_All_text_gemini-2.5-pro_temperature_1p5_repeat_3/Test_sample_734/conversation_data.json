    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nFirst, we need to break down the user's query into its core components:\n1.  **Subject:** A Christian theologian.\n2.  **Action:** Who was the *first* to develop *specialized terminology*.\n3.  **Concept:** The terminology must describe *changes in the laws of nature*.\n4.  **Application 1:** The terminology must be applicable to the *virgin birth of Jesus*.\n5.  **Application 2:** The terminology must be applicable to *possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall*.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points\n*   **\"First\"**: This is a crucial historical constraint. It means we are looking for the originator of a specific line of thought, not just any theologian who discussed the topic. This pushes us toward the Early Church or the early Middle Ages, likely predating the Scientific Revolution's formal concept of \"laws of nature.\"\n*   **\"Specialized Terminology\"**: This implies more than a simple assertion that \"God can do anything.\" We are looking for a conceptual framework with specific terms used to explain *how* such events relate to the normal functioning of the world.\n*   **\"Changes in the laws of nature\"**: This is the central problem. It involves both temporary suspensions or bypasses (as in a typical miracle) and potentially permanent or systemic alterations (as hypothesized for the Fall). The theologian's system must be flexible enough to account for both types of events.\n*   **Two Specific Cases**: The Virgin Birth is a classic miracleâ€”a singular event that bypasses a known biological law. The effects of the Fall are seen by some theologians as a systemic change to the entire created order (e.g., the introduction of death, decay, predation). The correct theologian's framework must logically apply to both situations.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\n1.  **Initial Candidates**: When considering systematic theology and the philosophy of nature, two major figures stand out: **Augustine of Hippo** (4th-5th century) and **Thomas Aquinas** (13th century). Both dealt extensively with creation, providence, and miracles.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Thomas Aquinas**: Aquinas developed the highly influential framework of **Primary and Secondary Causation**. God is the Primary Cause of all things, while the predictable workings of the universe (what we call natural laws) are Secondary Causes. A miracle occurs when God, the Primary Cause, acts directly, bypassing the usual chain of Secondary Causes.\n    *   **Application to Virgin Birth**: This fits perfectly. God directly caused the conception, bypassing the secondary cause of normal human reproduction.\n    *   **Application to the Fall**: This is more complex. Aquinas might argue that the pre-Fall state of harmony was a \"preternatural gift\" from God that held nature above its baseline state. The Fall was the removal of this gift, causing nature to revert to a state that now includes decay and death. This is an alteration, but perhaps more of a subtraction of a supernatural grace than a rewriting of natural law itself.\n    *   **Was he \"first\"?**: No. Aquinas lived in the 13th century.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Augustine of Hippo**: Augustine lived over 800 years before Aquinas and laid the foundation for much of Western theology. He dedicated significant thought to how God interacts with His creation.\n    *   **Developed Specialized Terminology**: Augustine introduced a key distinction. He argued that nothing can happen that is truly *contra naturam* (against nature), because God is the author of nature and His will constitutes the highest nature. Instead, events that we call miracles are merely *contra quam est nota natura* (against nature *as it is known to us*).\n    *   He also developed the concept of ***rationes seminales***, or **seminal reasons**. Augustine proposed that at creation, God embedded into matter the latent potentials or \"seeds\" for everything that would ever come into being, including future species and miraculous events. These seminal reasons unfold over time according to God's providential plan.\n    *   **Application to Virgin Birth**: Using his terminology, the virgin birth was not a violation of nature, but the activation of a \"seminal reason\" that God had placed in creation from the beginning. It was against the *usual course of nature* (*cursus naturae*) but not against the ultimate, higher nature defined by God's eternal plan.\n    *   **Application to the Fall**: This framework also elegantly applies here. The pre-Fall world operated according to one divinely ordained *cursus naturae* (course of nature). Following humanity's sin, God, in His judgment, allowed or caused a different *cursus naturae* to take effect, one that includes mortality, disease, and \"thorns and thistles.\" This constitutes a fundamental change in the operative laws of nature for humanity and the Earth, all within God's sovereign plan.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Augustine of Hippo was the *first* major Christian theologian to develop a sophisticated and specific terminology (*contra quam est nota natura*, *rationes seminales*, *cursus naturae*) that could systematically describe both singular miracles (the virgin birth) and systemic shifts in the natural order (the consequences of the Fall) as different manifestations of God's single, overarching providential plan for nature.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
