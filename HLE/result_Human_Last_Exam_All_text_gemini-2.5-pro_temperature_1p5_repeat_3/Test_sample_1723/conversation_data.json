    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the mushroom genus with a blue spore print.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Term - \"Spore Print\"**\nA spore print is a crucial diagnostic tool in mushroom identification. It is the powdery deposit of spores obtained by placing a mushroom cap, gills-down, on a surface (like paper) for several hours. The resulting color is a key characteristic for determining the mushroom's genus.\n\n**Step 2: Differentiate Spore Print Color from Other Mushroom Colors**\nIt is important not to confuse the color of the spore print with other colors present on the mushroom. Many fungi exhibit blue colors, but for different reasons:\n*   **Bruising/Staining:** Some mushrooms, like many in the genus *Psilocybe* or some boletes, turn blue when bruised or cut. This is a chemical reaction (oxidation) in the mushroom's flesh, not the color of the spores. The spore print of *Psilocybe* is typically purple-brown to black.\n*   **Cap/Stem Color:** Some mushrooms, like *Stropharia caerulea*, have a blue or blue-green cap, but their spore print is purple-brown.\n*   **Latex (Milk):** The Indigo Milk Cap (*Lactarius indigo*) exudes a deep blue latex when cut, but its spore print is yellowish to cream.\nThe question is specifically about the color of the spores themselves when viewed *en masse*.\n\n**Step 3: Recognize the Rarity of a Blue Spore Print**\nIn the world of mycology, a blue spore print is exceptionally rare. Common spore print colors include white, cream, pink, yellow, various shades of brown (ochre, rusty, chocolate), purple-brown, and black. The extreme rarity of blue spores means that only a very specific group of mushrooms will fit the description.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Correct Genus**\nThrough mycological research and examination of taxonomic keys, we can identify the genus responsible. While the vast majority of species in this genus produce pink spores (giving them the common name \"pinkgills\"), it is the only genus known to contain species that produce a distinctly blue spore print. Species such as *Entoloma virescens* and *Entoloma hochstetteri* (the New Zealand blue mushroom) are famous examples within this genus that possess this unique trait. Though many *Entoloma* species are pink-spored, it is the sole genus where blue-spored species have been documented.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of \"Spore Print\":** The most critical point is focusing only on the color of the spores, not any other part of the mushroom.\n*   **\"Single Genus\":** The question implies this is a unique feature. This helps rule out genera that are only colloquially associated with the color blue but do not have blue spores.\n*   **Intra-Genus Variation:** The entire genus is not blue-spored. Rather, it's a large genus known primarily for another spore color (pink) but contains the only known species that deviate to produce blue spores.\n\nBased on this analysis, the single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print is *Entoloma*.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
