    "Answering this question requires understanding the properties of finite reflection groups, specifically the group of type H3, and the concepts of Coxeter numbers, Coxeter elements, and regular eigenvectors.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group and the question's terminology.**\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3:** This is a finite Coxeter group of order 120. It represents the symmetries of a regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. It is isomorphic to the group `A_5 × C_2`, where `A_5` is the alternating group on 5 elements and `C_2` is the cyclic group of order 2.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For an irreducible finite Coxeter group, the Coxeter number is a fundamental invariant. For H3, the Coxeter number `h` is 10.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** A vector `v` in the representation space is called *regular* if its stabilizer in the group is trivial (i.e., only the identity element fixes `v`). An element `g` of the group is said to have a regular eigenvector if there exists a regular vector `v` such that `g(v) = λv` for some eigenvalue `λ`.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order 10:** The eigenvalue `λ` must be a primitive 10th root of unity (i.e., `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for `1 ≤ k < 10`).\n\n**Step 2: Relate regular eigenvectors to Coxeter elements.**\nA fundamental theorem in the theory of reflection groups (due to T. A. Springer) states that an element `g` in an irreducible finite Coxeter group `W` has a regular eigenvector if and only if `g` is conjugate to a *Coxeter element*.\nA Coxeter element is an element formed by the product of all simple reflections, each taken once in some order. For an irreducible group like H3, all Coxeter elements are conjugate to each other, forming a single conjugacy class.\n\nTherefore, the problem is transformed into two parts:\n1.  Identify the conjugacy class of Coxeter elements.\n2.  Verify that the elements in this class have eigenvalues of order 10.\n3.  Count the number of elements in this class.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the properties of a Coxeter element in H3.**\nThe eigenvalues of any Coxeter element `c` are given by the formula `exp(2πi * e_j / h)`, where `h` is the Coxeter number and `e_j` are the *exponents* of the group. The exponents are `m_j - 1`, where `m_j` are the degrees of the fundamental invariant polynomials.\n*   For H3, the degrees are `m_1 = 2`, `m_2 = 6`, `m_3 = 10`.\n*   The exponents are `e_1 = 1`, `e_2 = 5`, `e_3 = 9`.\n*   The Coxeter number is `h = 10`.\n\nThe eigenvalues of a Coxeter element `c` in H3 are:\n*   `λ_1 = exp(2πi * 1 / 10) = e^(πi/5)`\n*   `λ_2 = exp(2πi * 5 / 10) = e^(πi) = -1`\n*   `λ_3 = exp(2πi * 9 / 10) = e^(9πi/5)`\n\nLet's check the orders of these eigenvalues:\n*   The order of `λ_1` is 10.\n*   The order of `λ_2` is 2.\n*   The order of `λ_3` is 10.\n\nSo, any Coxeter element (and any element conjugate to it) has two eigenvalues of order 10. Furthermore, the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues `exp(2πi * e_j / h)` are regular if and only if `gcd(e_j, h) = 1`.\n*   For `e_1 = 1`: `gcd(1, 10) = 1`, so the eigenvector for `λ_1` is regular.\n*   For `e_3 = 9`: `gcd(9, 10) = 1`, so the eigenvector for `λ_3` is regular.\n\nThis confirms that all elements in the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element satisfy the condition of the question: they possess a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of such elements.**\nThe set of elements satisfying the question's condition is precisely the conjugacy class of the Coxeter elements. We need to find the size of this class. The size of the conjugacy class of an element `g` in a group `G` is `|G| / |C_G(g)|`, where `C_G(g)` is the centralizer of `g` in `G`.\n*   `|H3| = 120`.\n*   For a Coxeter element `c` in an irreducible finite Coxeter group, its centralizer `C_W(c)` is the cyclic group generated by `c` itself, i.e., `C_W(c) = <c>`.\n*   The order of the Coxeter element `c` is equal to the Coxeter number `h`. So, `order(c) = h = 10`.\n*   Therefore, the size of the centralizer is `|C_H3(c)| = 10`.\n\nThe size of the conjugacy class of Coxeter elements is:\nSize = `|H3| / |C_H3(c)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n\nThere are 12 such elements. These 12 elements form a single conjugacy class, and they are the only elements in H3 that have a regular eigenvector. Since their eigenvalues include two of order 10, all 12 of them satisfy the given condition."
