    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility of the polynomial.**\n\nThe first step is to determine if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Rational Root Test:** We check for rational roots $p/q$, where $p$ divides the constant term 14 and $q$ divides the leading coefficient 1. The possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1 + 8 + 14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1 - 8 + 14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = 16 - 16 + 14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    Since none of the integer divisors of 14 are roots, the polynomial has no rational roots. This means it cannot be factored into a linear factor and a cubic factor.\n*   **Reduction Modulo a Prime:** We can test for irreducibility by reducing the coefficients modulo a prime number. Let's use $p=3$.\n    $f(x) \\equiv x^4 + 2x + 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n    Let's check for roots in $\\mathbb{Z}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$:\n    *   $f(0) \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\n    *   $f(1) \\equiv 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\n    *   $f(2) \\equiv 16 + 4 + 2 = 22 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$\n    There are no roots in $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, so the polynomial has no linear factors modulo 3.\n    Next, we check for quadratic factors. The only irreducible quadratic polynomials over $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ are $x^2+1$, $x^2+x+2$, and $x^2+2x+2$. A possible factorization of $x^4 + 2x + 2$ would be a product of two of these (or the square of one). Trying to match coefficients shows that no such factorization exists. For example, $(x^2+1)^2 = x^4+2x^2+1 \\neq x^4+2x+2$. $(x^2+x+2)(x^2+2x+2) = x^4+3x^3+6x^2+6x+4 \\equiv x^4+1 \\pmod{3}$. Through exhaustive checking, one can find that $x^4 + 2x + 2$ does not factor into two quadratics over $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n    Since $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo 3, it must be irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*Careful Point:* An irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ has a Galois group that is a transitive subgroup of $S_n$. Here $n=4$, so the Galois group $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possibilities are $S_4, A_4, D_4, C_4, V_4$.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the resolvent cubic.**\n\nFor a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is given by the formula $g(t) = t^3 - 4qt - p^2$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$g(t) = t^3 - 4(14)t - (8)^2 = t^3 - 56t - 64$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the resolvent cubic.**\n\nWe need to find the nature of the roots of $g(t) = t^3 - 56t - 64$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Rational Root Test:** Any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. The possibilities are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\dots$.\n    *   $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n    So, $t=8$ is a rational root. This means the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   We can factor $g(t)$ using the root $t=8$:\n    $g(t) = (t-8)(t^2 + 8t + 8)$.\n    The other two roots are given by the quadratic factor $t^2 + 8t + 8 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula:\n    $t = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    These two roots are irrational.\n\n*Careful Point:* The irreducibility of the resolvent cubic tells us about the Galois group $G$.\n*   If $g(t)$ is irreducible, $G$ is $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n*   If $g(t)$ has three rational roots, $G$ is $V_4$.\n*   If $g(t)$ has exactly one rational root (as in our case), $G$ is either the dihedral group $D_4$ or the cyclic group $C_4$. Both have order 8 and 4, respectively.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the discriminant of the quartic.**\n\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ of a polynomial helps determine if its Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$.\nFor a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nWith $p=8$ and $q=14$:\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n\nNow, we check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$591872 = 2 \\times 295936 = 2^2 \\times 147968 = \\dots = 2^{11} \\times 17^2$.\nSince the exponent of the prime factor 2 is 11 (an odd number), $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square.\n\n*Careful Point:* The Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in the base field. Since our $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square, $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This confirms that $G$ cannot be $A_4$ or $V_4$, which we already knew from the resolvent cubic analysis.\n\n**Step 5: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$.**\n\nWe have narrowed down the possibilities for the Galois group to $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4). The standard method to distinguish between them is to check if the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   If $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, then $G \\cong D_4$.\n*   If $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, then $G \\cong C_4$.\n\nThe field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(2^5 \\cdot 17 \\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nSo we must check if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If it is, it must factor into two quadratic polynomials of the form:\n$f(x) = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$, where $a,b,c,d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe factors must be conjugates, so we can write:\n$f(x) = (x^2 + (a_1+a_2\\sqrt{2})x + (b_1+b_2\\sqrt{2}))(x^2 + (a_1-a_2\\sqrt{2})x + (b_1-b_2\\sqrt{2}))$\nwhere $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nExpanding this gives:\n$x^4 + 2a_1x^3 + (a_1^2 - 2a_2^2 + 2b_1)x^2 + (2a_1b_1 - 4a_2b_2)x + (b_1^2 - 2b_2^2)$.\nComparing coefficients with $x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$:\n1.  $2a_1 = 0 \\implies a_1=0$.\n2.  $a_1^2 - 2a_2^2 + 2b_1 = 0 \\implies -2a_2^2 + 2b_1 = 0 \\implies b_1=a_2^2$.\n3.  $2a_1b_1 - 4a_2b_2 = 8 \\implies -4a_2b_2 = 8 \\implies a_2b_2 = -2$.\n4.  $b_1^2 - 2b_2^2 = 14$.\n\nFrom (3), $b_2 = -2/a_2$. Substitute this and $b_1=a_2^2$ from (2) into (4):\n$(a_2^2)^2 - 2(-2/a_2)^2 = 14$\n$a_2^4 - 2(4/a_2^2) = 14$\n$a_2^4 - 8/a_2^2 = 14$.\nMultiply by $a_2^2$ (we know $a_2 \\neq 0$ from (3)):\n$a_2^6 - 8 = 14a_2^2$.\nLet $y=a_2^2$. Then $y^3 - 14y - 8 = 0$. Since we let $b_1=a_2^2$, we can write this as $b_1^3 - 14b_1 - 8 = 0$. We need to find if there is a rational solution for $b_1$. By the Rational Root Test, we try integer divisors of -8.\n*   For $b_1=4$: $4^3 - 14(4) - 8 = 64 - 56 - 8 = 0$.\nA rational solution exists: $b_1=4$.\nWith $b_1=4$, we have $a_2^2 = 4 \\implies a_2 = \\pm 2$. Let's take $a_2=2$.\nThen $b_2 = -2/a_2 = -2/2 = -1$.\nWe have found rational numbers $a_1=0, a_2=2, b_1=4, b_2=-1$ that solve the system. This means $f(x)$ is indeed reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe explicit factorization is: $(x^2+2\\sqrt{2}x + (4-\\sqrt{2}))(x^2-2\\sqrt{2}x+(4+\\sqrt{2}))$.\n\n*Careful Point:* The existence of this factorization means the condition for the Galois group to be $D_4$ is met.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the Galois group and its order.**\n\nSince $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, its resolvent cubic has one rational root, and $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group $G$ is the dihedral group $D_4$.\nThe order of the group $D_4$ is 8."
