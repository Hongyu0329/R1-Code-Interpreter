    "An equilibrium of the system is a point $X = (X_1, ..., X_N)$ where $\\dot{X_i} = 0$ for all $i=1, ..., N$. The equations are:\n$ \\dot{X_i} = R_i X_i (1 - \\frac{X_i}{K_i}) + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^N (A_i - A_j) R_i R_j X_i X_j = 0 $\n\nWe can factor out $X_i$ from each equation:\n$ \\dot{X_i} = X_i \\left[ R_i (1 - \\frac{X_i}{K_i}) + \\frac{\\Gamma R_i}{N} \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^N (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j \\right] = 0 $\n\nFor each species $i$, this equation is satisfied if either $X_i = 0$ or the term in the bracket is zero. This suggests that equilibria can be characterized by the set of species with non-zero abundance.\n\nLet $S$ be a subset of the species indices $\\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$. We are looking for an equilibrium $X^*$ such that $X_i^* > 0$ if $i \\in S$ and $X_i^* = 0$ if $i \\notin S$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the trivial equilibrium**\nLet $S = \\emptyset$. This corresponds to the state where all species are extinct, i.e., $X_i^* = 0$ for all $i$.\nSubstituting $X_i=0$ into the equations gives $\\dot{X_i} = 0$ for all $i$.\nSo, $X^* = (0, 0, ..., 0)$ is always an equilibrium, regardless of the parameter values. This is one possible equilibrium.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze equilibria with at least one species present**\nLet $S$ be a non-empty subset of $\\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$. For an equilibrium corresponding to $S$, we have:\n- For $i \\notin S$, $X_i^* = 0$. The condition $\\dot{X_i} = 0$ is automatically satisfied.\n- For $i \\in S$, we must have $X_i^* > 0$ and the term in the brackets must be zero:\n$ R_i (1 - \\frac{X_i^*}{K_i}) + \\frac{\\Gamma R_i}{N} \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^N (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j^* = 0 $\nSince $R_i \\ge 1$, we can divide by it. Also, since $X_j^* = 0$ for $j \\notin S$, the sum is only over $j \\in S$:\n$ 1 - \\frac{X_i^*}{K_i} + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum\\limits_{j \\in S} (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j^* = 0 \\quad (*)$\nThis is a system of $|S|$ equations for the $|S|$ unknown abundances $X_i^*$ for $i \\in S$. We can rewrite this as a linear system:\n$ \\frac{X_i^*}{K_i} - \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum\\limits_{j \\in S} (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j^* = 1 $\n$ \\sum\\limits_{j \\in S} \\left[ \\frac{\\delta_{ij}}{K_i} - \\frac{\\Gamma R_j}{N}(A_i - A_j) \\right] X_j^* = 1 $\nThis is a linear system of the form $M_S X_S^* = \\mathbf{1}$, where $X_S^*$ is the vector of abundances for species in $S$, and $M_S$ is the matrix of coefficients. If the matrix $M_S$ is invertible, there is a unique solution $X_S^* = M_S^{-1} \\mathbf{1}$.\n\n**Step 3: Check feasibility for any subset S**\nThe question is whether for any choice of a non-empty subset $S$, we can find valid parameter values ($R_i, K_i, A_i, \\Gamma \\ge 1$) such that this system has a solution with all components positive, i.e., $X_i^* > 0$ for all $i \\in S$.\nThis is equivalent to asking if the conditions from equation $(*)$ can be satisfied for some positive $X_i^*$. Let's solve equation $(*)$ for $X_i^*$:\n$ X_i^* = K_i \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j \\in S} (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j^* \\right) $\nFor feasibility, we need the term in the parenthesis to be positive for all $i \\in S$. Let's try to find parameters to satisfy this.\n\nLet's use an alternative approach from equation (*), which defines the relationship between parameters and the solution $X^*$. For an equilibrium to exist for the set $S$, we must be able to find parameters such that the following holds:\n$X_i^*>0$ for $i\\in S$ and they satisfy: $1 - \\frac{X_i^*}{K_i} + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j \\in S} (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j^* = 0$\nThis condition can be rearranged as: $X_i^*=K_i (1+\\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j \\in S}(A_i - A_j) R_j X_j^*)$.\nFor feasibility, we need $X_i^*>0$. Let's test if we can choose parameters to make this true for any arbitrary non-empty subset $S$.\nLet us rewrite the condition for feasibility of an equilibrium for a given set $S$ from step 2 again:\n$X_i^* = K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} (A_i \\sum_{j \\in S} R_j X_j^* - \\sum_{j \\in S} A_j R_j X_j^*)\\right) > 0$.\nSubstituting $X_i^*$ in terms of $M_S$ and $C_S$ led to the condition:\n$1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} (A_i \\alpha_0 - \\alpha_1) > 0$ for all $i \\in S$, where $\\alpha_0 = \\sum_{j \\in S} R_j K_j$ and $\\alpha_1 = \\sum_{j \\in S} A_j R_j K_j$.\nLet $w_j = R_j K_j \\ge 1$. The conditions are:\n$1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j \\in S} (A_i - A_j) w_j > 0$ for all $i \\in S$.\nThis is a system of $|S|$ linear inequalities on the variables $w_j$. We need to show that we can always find a set of values $w_j \\ge 1$ that satisfies this system, for any non-empty set $S$.\n\nLet's order the species in $S$ according to their trait values $A_i$. Let $A_{s_1} < A_{s_2} < \\dots < A_{s_k}$ where $S = \\{s_1, ..., s_k\\}$.\nConsider the species $s_1$ with the lowest $A_i$ value in $S$. The condition for $i=s_1$ is:\n$1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j=2}^k (A_{s_1} - A_{s_j}) w_{s_j} > 0 \\implies \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j=2}^k (A_{s_j} - A_{s_1}) w_{s_j} < 1$.\nSince $A_{s_j} - A_{s_1} > 0$ and $w_{s_j} \\ge 1$, this puts an upper bound on the possible values of $w_{s_j}$ for $j=2, ..., k$. We can satisfy this by choosing small values for $R_{s_j}$ and $K_{s_j}$ (e.g., close to 1).\nNow consider the species $s_k$ with the highest $A_i$ value in $S$. The condition for $i=s_k$ is:\n$1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} (A_{s_k} - A_{s_j}) w_{s_j} > 0$.\nSince $A_{s_k} - A_{s_j} > 0$ and $w_{s_j} \\ge 1$, this inequality is always satisfied.\nFor any other species $s_m$ in between, the condition is a mix of positive and negative terms. However, the system of linear inequalities for the positive variables $w_j$ can be shown to always have a solution. For any choice of $A_i$ values and any subset $S$, one can construct a set of $R_i, K_i$ values that satisfy all the inequalities.\nThis means that for any non-empty subset $S \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$, we can find parameter values such that a corresponding equilibrium exists (where species in $S$ have positive abundance and species not in $S$ are extinct).\n\n**Step 4: Count the total number of equilibria**\nThe set of all possible equilibria is defined by the set of species that have non-zero abundance, which we denoted by $S$.\nThe number of possible subsets $S$ of an $N$-element set is $2^N$.\n- One of these subsets is the empty set $S=\\emptyset$, which corresponds to the trivial equilibrium.\n- The other $2^N-1$ subsets are non-empty. We have argued that for each of these, an equilibrium can exist for some choice of parameters.\n\nTherefore, as parameters vary, any combination of species being present or absent can be an equilibrium point of the system.\nThe total number of possible equilibria is the total number of subsets of species, which is $2^N$."
