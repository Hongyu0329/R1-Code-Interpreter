    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe are asked to find the maximum possible number of fixed points for the composite function `h(x) = f(g(x))`. A fixed point `x` is a solution to the equation `h(x) = x`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Functions `f` and `g`**\n*   **Type and Degree:** `f(x)` and `g(x)` are polynomials of degree 3.\n    *   `f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0`, with `a_3 ≠ 0`.\n    *   `g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0`, with `b_3 ≠ 0`.\n*   **Derivative Condition:** We are given that `f'(x) > 0` and `g'(x) > 0` for all real numbers `x`.\n    *   `f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1`. For this quadratic to be always positive, its parabola must open upwards and not intersect the x-axis. This requires the leading coefficient `3a_3` to be positive (so `a_3 > 0`) and the discriminant to be negative (`(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0`).\n    *   Similarly, for `g'(x)`, we must have `b_3 > 0` and `(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0`.\n    *   A key consequence of having a positive derivative everywhere is that both `f(x)` and `g(x)` are strictly increasing functions.\n\n**3. Analyze the Composite Function `h(x) = f(g(x))`**\n*   **Degree:** The degree of a composition of polynomials is the product of their degrees.\n    *   `deg(h) = deg(f) * deg(g) = 3 * 3 = 9`.\n*   **Derivative:** Using the chain rule, the derivative of `h(x)` is `h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)`.\n    *   Since `g'(x)` is always positive, and `f'(y)` is always positive for any input `y` (including `y = g(x)`), their product `h'(x)` must also be always positive.\n    *   This means `h(x)` is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n**4. Formulate the Fixed-Point Equation**\nThe fixed points are the solutions to `f(g(x)) = x`.\nThis can be rewritten as finding the roots of the polynomial `P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0`.\n\n**5. Determine the Upper Bound for the Number of Solutions**\n*   The function `h(x) = f(g(x))` is a polynomial of degree 9.\n*   The function `P(x) = h(x) - x` is also a polynomial of degree 9 (the `-x` term does not change the highest power term).\n*   According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree `n` can have at most `n` real roots.\n*   Therefore, the equation `P(x) = 0` can have at most 9 real solutions. This means the maximum possible number of fixed points is 9.\n\n**6. Check if 9 Fixed Points is Achievable (The Careful Points)**\nWe need to confirm that it's actually possible to construct `f` and `g` that satisfy the conditions and result in 9 fixed points. We can demonstrate this by considering the properties required for a function to have 9 roots.\n\n*   **Rolle's Theorem:** If a differentiable function `P(x)` has 9 distinct real roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative `P'(x)` must have at least `9 - 1 = 8` distinct real roots.\n*   **Analyze `P'(x)`:** `P'(x) = h'(x) - 1`. For `P'(x)` to have 8 roots, the equation `h'(x) = 1` must have 8 solutions.\n*   **Degree of `h'(x)`:** Let's find the degree of `h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)`.\n    *   `deg(g(x)) = 3`, `deg(g'(x)) = 2`.\n    *   `deg(f'(x)) = 2`.\n    *   `deg(f'(g(x))) = deg(f') * deg(g) = 2 * 3 = 6`.\n    *   `deg(h'(x)) = deg(f'(g(x))) + deg(g'(x)) = 6 + 2 = 8`.\n    *   So, `h'(x)` is a polynomial of degree 8. The equation `h'(x) = 1` is an 8th-degree polynomial equation, which can have at most 8 real roots. This is consistent with what Rolle's Theorem requires.\n*   **Constructibility:** To have 8 roots for `h'(x) = 1`, the graph of `y=h'(x)` must cross the line `y=1` eight times.\n    *   `h'(x)` is an 8th-degree polynomial with a positive leading coefficient (since `a_3>0` and `b_3>0`). This means `h'(x) → +∞` as `x → ±∞`.\n    *   An 8th-degree polynomial can have up to `8-1=7` local extrema (4 local minima, 3 local maxima).\n    *   We can choose the coefficients of `f` and `g` such that `h'(x)` has 7 such extrema. By carefully tuning these coefficients, we can make the 4 local minima of `h'(x)` have values less than 1 (but still positive, as required) and the 3 local maxima have values greater than 1.\n    *   This setup ensures that `y = h'(x)` intersects `y = 1` in exactly 8 distinct points.\n*   **Final Step:** If `P'(x)` has 8 distinct roots, then `P(x) = h(x) - x` has 8 local extrema (4 maxima and 4 minima). We can then adjust the constant term `a_0` in `f(x)`, which shifts the graph of `P(x)` vertically without changing its derivative `P'(x)`. We can position this graph so that all 4 local maxima are positive and all 4 local minima are negative. A degree 9 polynomial that goes from `-∞` to `+∞` and passes through this sequence of extrema will cross the x-axis 9 times.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe maximum number of roots for the degree-9 polynomial `f(g(x)) - x` is 9. The analysis shows that the conditions `f' > 0` and `g' > 0` do not prevent this maximum from being achieved. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
