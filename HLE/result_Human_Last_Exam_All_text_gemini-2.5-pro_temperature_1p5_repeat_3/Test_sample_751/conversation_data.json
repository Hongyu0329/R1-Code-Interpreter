    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form and the new matrix C.\n\n**1. Understand Duality and Canonical Forms**\n\nThe principle of duality in linear systems states that a system `(A, C)` is observable if and only if its dual system `(A^T, C^T)` is controllable. We can use this property to find the observer canonical form. The procedure is:\n1.  Construct the dual system `(A_d, B_d)`, where `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`.\n2.  Find the transformation matrix `P_c` that transforms the dual system into the controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`.\n3.  The observer canonical form of the original system is then given by `A_o = A_c^T` and `C_o = B_c^T`. The question specifically asks for `C_o`.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step A: Define the Dual System**\n\nFirst, we are given the system matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe dual system matrices, `A_d` and `B_d`, are the transposes of `A` and `C`:\n`A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n`B_d` is a 3x2 matrix. Let's denote its columns as `b1` and `b2`:\n`b1 = [0, 1, 0]^T`\n`b2 = [1, 1, 0]^T`\n\n**Step B: Find the Transformation for Controller Canonical Form**\n\nTo find the transformation matrix `P_c`, we first need to check the controllability of the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` and determine its controllability indices.\n\n*   **Controllability Check and Indices:**\n    We form a set of linearly independent vectors by selecting from the sequence `{b1, b2, A_d*b1, A_d*b2, ...}`. The state dimension `n` is 3.\n    1.  Select `b1`.\n    2.  Select `b2` (it is linearly independent of `b1`).\n    3.  Calculate `A_d*b1`:\n        `A_d*b1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]^T = [2, 1, 1]^T`.\n        This vector is linearly independent of `{b1, b2}`.\n    We have now found 3 linearly independent vectors `b1, b2, A_d*b1`. These form a basis for the state space. The system is controllable.\n    To find the controllability indices (`v1`, `v2`), we count how many vectors were taken from each input's chain:\n    -   From `b1`'s chain (`b1, A_d*b1, ...`): we took `b1` and `A_d*b1`. So, `v1 = 2`.\n    -   From `b2`'s chain (`b2, A_d*b2, ...`): we took `b2`. So, `v2 = 1`.\n    The sum `v1 + v2 = 2 + 1 = 3 = n`, which is correct.\n\n*   **Construct the Selection Matrix `S`:**\n    The selection matrix `S` is formed by these linearly independent vectors, ordered according to the indices: `S = [b1, A_d*b1, b2]`.\n    `S = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n\n*   **Find the Transformation Matrix `P_c`:**\n    The transformation matrix `P_c` that puts the system into controller canonical form is the inverse of the selection matrix `S`.\n    `P_c = S^-1`\n    We calculate the inverse of `S`:\n    `det(S) = 0 * (0-1) - 2 * (0-0) + 1 * (1-0) = 1`\n    The adjugate of `S` is `[[ -1, 1, 1 ], [ 0, 0, 1 ], [ 1, 0, -2 ]]`.\n    `P_c = S^-1 = (1/det(S)) * Adj(S) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the new B matrix (`B_c`)**\n\nThe new input matrix in controller canonical form, `B_c`, is given by `B_c = P_c * B_d`.\n`B_c = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n`B_c = [[-1*0+1*1+1*0, -1*1+1*1+1*0], [0*0+0*1+1*0, 0*1+0*1+1*0], [1*0+0*1-2*0, 1*1+0*1-2*0]]`\n`B_c = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\n**Step D: Determine the new C matrix (`C_o`) for the Observer Form**\n\nAccording to the duality principle, the output matrix of the observer canonical form, `C_o`, is the transpose of the `B_c` we just calculated.\n`C_o = B_c^T`\n`C_o = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]^T`\n`C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe value of the new matrix C, denoted as `C_o`, in the observer canonical form is:\n`[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
