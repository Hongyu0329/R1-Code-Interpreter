    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Noble Gases:** The noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. For Earth's natural composition, we consider:\n    *   Helium (He)\n    *   Neon (Ne)\n    *   Argon (Ar)\n    *   Krypton (Kr)\n    *   Xenon (Xe)\n    *   Radon (Rn)\n    *   (Oganesson is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally, so it is not a candidate).\n\n2.  **Understand the Scope of the Question:** The question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\". This is a crucial point. It means we cannot just look at the composition of the atmosphere; we must consider the entire Earth (atmosphere, oceans, crust, mantle, and core). The year \"2002\" is not significant, as the natural abundance of elements on Earth does not change on such a short timescale.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas:**\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** Argon is the most abundant noble gas on Earth. Its high concentration in the atmosphere (~0.93% by volume) is primarily due to the decay of the radioactive isotope Potassium-40 (K-40), which is common in the Earth's crust.\n    *   **Helium (He):** Helium is the second most abundant noble gas in the universe, but much of Earth's primordial helium escaped into space long ago due to its low mass. However, new helium is constantly being generated within the Earth's crust and mantle through the alpha decay of radioactive elements like uranium and thorium. This makes it more abundant than Neon, Krypton, or Xenon in total terrestrial matter.\n    *   **Neon (Ne):** Neon is more abundant than Krypton or Xenon in the atmosphere (~18 parts per million). It is relatively rare in the Earth's crust.\n    *   **Krypton (Kr):** Krypton is rarer than Neon in the atmosphere (~1 part per million).\n    *   **Xenon (Xe):** Xenon is the rarest of the stable noble gases. Its concentration in the atmosphere is very low, at approximately 0.09 parts per million (or 90 parts per billion). It is extremely rare in the Earth's crust.\n    *   **Radon (Rn):** This is the key candidate to consider carefully. Radon is different from the others because all of its isotopes are highly radioactive. The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only about 3.8 days.\n\n4.  **Compare the Rarest Candidates: Xenon vs. Radon:**\n    *   **Xenon (Xe)** is stable. The Xenon present on Earth today is mostly a remnant from the planet's formation. Although its concentration is incredibly low, it persists over geological time. The total mass of Xenon in Earth's atmosphere is estimated to be in the trillions of kilograms.\n    *   **Radon (Rn)** is transient. It is continuously produced in the Earth's crust from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. However, because it decays so rapidly, the total amount of Radon present on the entire planet at any single moment (its steady-state concentration) is extraordinarily small. Estimates for the total mass of Radon in the entire atmosphere are just a few tens of kilograms.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    While Xenon is the rarest *stable* noble gas, the extreme radioactivity and very short half-life of Radon mean that its total abundance on Earth at any given time is far, far lower than that of Xenon. Therefore, when measured as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, Radon is the rarest of all naturally occurring noble gases.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Radon}$."
