The measure for a Grassmann variable integral is defined by the Berezin integration rules. For a single Grassmann variable η, these rules are:
1. The integral of a constant is zero:  `∫ dη 1 = 0`
2. The integral of the variable itself is one: `∫ dη η = 1`
These two rules, built upon the fundamental algebraic property `η² = 0` which encodes the Pauli exclusion principle, completely define the integration measure.
