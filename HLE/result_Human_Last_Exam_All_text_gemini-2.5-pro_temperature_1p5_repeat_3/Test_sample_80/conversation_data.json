    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and the Pieces**\nThe game is played on a standard 8x8 chessboard. The pieces are bishops. A bishop attacks any square along the same diagonal path. A key property of bishops is that they always stay on squares of the same color. A bishop on a white square can only ever move to and attack other white squares. A bishop on a black square can only ever move to and attack other black squares.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the \"Edge Squares\"**\nThe edge squares are all the squares on the first rank, the eighth rank, the 'a' file, and the 'h' file.\n*   Number of squares on the top edge (rank 8) = 8\n*   Number of squares on the bottom edge (rank 1) = 8\n*   Number of squares on the left edge (file 'a'), not including corners = 6\n*   Number of squares on the right edge (file 'h'), not including corners = 6\n*   Total number of edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Objective**\nThe goal is to place the maximum possible number of bishops on these 28 edge squares such that no bishop attacks another.\n\n**Step 4: Develop a Strategy for Maximum Placement**\nA simple and powerful way to place non-attacking bishops is to place them along files or ranks. Let's consider placing bishops on the squares of the 'a' file and the 'h' file, as all these squares are edge squares.\n*   There are 8 squares on the 'a' file (a1, a2, ..., a8).\n*   There are 8 squares on the 'h' file (h1, h2, ..., h8).\n*   This gives a total of 16 potential locations.\n\n**Step 5: Check for Conflicts in the Strategy**\nWe must ensure no two bishops placed this way can attack each other.\n*   **Conflicts within a file:** No two squares on the same file (e.g., a3 and a5) are on the same diagonal. So, all 8 bishops can be placed on the 'a' file without any attacking each other. The same is true for the 'h' file.\n*   **Conflicts between files:** We need to check if a bishop on the 'a' file can attack a bishop on the 'h' file. An attack occurs if two squares (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are on the same diagonal, which means the distance between their files is the same as the distance between their ranks (i.e., |x1 - x2| = |y1 - y2|).\n    *   For the 'a' file (file 1) and 'h' file (file 8), the distance between files is |1 - 8| = 7.\n    *   Therefore, an attack can only happen between a square on file 'a' (1, y_a) and a square on file 'h' (8, y_h) if the distance between their ranks is also 7 (i.e., |y_a - y_h| = 7).\n    *   On an 8x8 board, this rank distance of 7 can only happen between rank 1 and rank 8.\n    *   This gives us two specific conflicting pairs:\n        1.  The square **a1** attacks the square **h8**.\n        2.  The square **a8** attacks the square **h1**.\n*   There are no other possible attacks between bishops on the 'a' file and the 'h' file.\n\n**Step 6: Maximize the Number of Bishops**\nWe have 16 potential locations (all squares on files 'a' and 'h') with two pairs of conflicting squares: (a1, h8) and (a8, h1).\n*   To resolve the (a1, h8) conflict, we must place a bishop on only one of these two squares.\n*   To resolve the (a8, h1) conflict, we must place a bishop on only one of these two squares.\nTo place the maximum number of bishops, we start with 16 and must remove one bishop for each conflict. This means we must remove a total of 2 bishops.\n*   Maximum placed bishops = 16 (total squares on 'a' and 'h' files) - 2 (removed for conflicts) = 14.\nAn example placement would be bishops on all 8 squares of the 'a' file, and on the 6 squares of the 'h' file from h2 to h7. This totals 8 + 6 = 14 bishops. The known maximum number of non-attacking bishops on an entire 8x8 board is 14, so we know we cannot place any more.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would *lack* bishops.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28\n*   Maximum number of placed bishops = 14\n*   Number of edge squares lacking bishops = Total Edge Squares - Placed Bishops\n*   Number of edge squares lacking bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
