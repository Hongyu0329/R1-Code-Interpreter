    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The key to identifying this repeat is to find the pattern of hydrophobic residues, which typically occupy the 'a' and 'd' positions, forming the core of the structure.\n\nLet's examine the sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\nThe large hydrophobic residues are Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W). We are looking for a pattern where these residues are separated by 2 or 3 other amino acids (e.g., HxxHxxx, where H is hydrophobic).\n\nIf we assign the sequence to the `abcdefg` register, we find the most stable arrangement by placing the hydrophobic residues at 'a' and 'd'. Let's test a phasing that starts with `I` at position 'a'.\n\n*   Sequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n*   Register: `g a b c d e f|g a b c d e f|g a b c d e f|g a b c d e f|g a b`\n\nThis doesn't work because the 'd' position becomes A, K, W, Q, which is not consistently hydrophobic.\n\nLet's try another phasing that aligns the sequence's characteristics with a typical coiled-coil. A common feature is having charged residues (like K, E) at the 'e' and 'g' positions to form stabilizing salt bridges.\n\nThe most plausible phasing is:\n*   Sequence: `G E I A Q S L | K E I A K S L | K E I A W S L | K E I A Q S L | K G`\n*   Register:  `e f g a b c d | e f g a b c d | e f g a b c d | e f g a b c d | e f g`\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Residues at Each Position of the Heptad**\n\nBased on the phasing above, let's list the amino acids found at each position of the heptad repeat:\n*   **'a' positions (Core):** I, I, I, I (Consistently Isoleucine)\n*   **'b' positions:** A, A, A, A\n*   **'c' positions:** Q, K, W, Q\n*   **'d' positions (Core):** L, L, W, L (Predominantly Leucine, one Tryptophan)\n*   **'e' positions (Flanking):** G, K, K, K (Generally charged/polar)\n*   **'f' positions:** S, S, S, S\n*   **'g' positions (Flanking):** E, E, E, E (Consistently Glutamate, charged)\n\nThis arrangement is highly characteristic of a coiled-coil: the 'a' and 'd' positions form a hydrophobic core, and the 'e' and 'g' positions contain charged residues suitable for inter-helical electrostatic interactions.\n\n**Step 3: Apply \"Knobs-into-Holes\" Packing Principles**\n\nThe specific identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' core positions determines the oligomeric state due to the efficiency of side-chain packing, a concept known as \"knobs-into-holes\". The key factor is the position of the branch in the side chain.\n*   **Isoleucine (I)** and Valine (V) are **β-branched** (branch on the second carbon of the side chain).\n*   **Leucine (L)** and Methionine (M) are **γ-branched** (branch on the third carbon).\n\nExperimental studies have established predictive rules for oligomerization:\n*   **Dimer (Oligomeric State = 2):** Favored by **Isoleucine at 'a'** and **Leucine at 'd'**. This combination allows for optimal side-chain packing in a two-stranded coiled-coil.\n*   **Trimer (Oligomeric State = 3):** Favored by having the same type of residue in each layer, e.g., Isoleucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd', OR Leucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd'.\n*   **Tetramer (Oligomeric State = 4):** Favored by the inverse of the dimer pattern: **Leucine at 'a'** and **Isoleucine at 'd'**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Oligomeric State for the Given Sequence**\n\nLet's look at our sequence's core pattern:\n*   **'a' position:** Consistently **Isoleucine (I)**, a β-branched residue.\n*   **'d' position:** Predominantly **Leucine (L)**, a γ-branched residue. (The one Tryptophan is also large and hydrophobic, behaving similarly to Leucine in terms of core packing).\n\nThis **`I` at 'a' / `L` at 'd'** pattern is the classic signature for a **dimeric coiled-coil**. The packing of the β-branched and γ-branched side chains is most sterically favorable in a two-stranded structure. Other oligomeric states would lead to steric clashes and less efficient core packing.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state of this protein sequence would be 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
