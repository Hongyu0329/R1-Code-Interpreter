The bare Green's function $G_0$, when represented in the frequency-momentum basis $(k, \omega)$, is a simple algebraic function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. Its functional dependence is given by the expression $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta_{k}}$, where $\eta_k$ is an infinitesimal term whose sign depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied or empty. Thus, $G_0$ is characterized by having simple poles in the complex frequency plane located exactly at the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\epsilon_k$.
