    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the relationship between the bare Green's function ($G_0$) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$) in the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and the Bare Green's Function**\n\nThe \"bare\" or \"non-interacting\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes a system governed by a non-interacting Hamiltonian, $H_0$. This Hamiltonian can be written in second quantization in terms of creation ($c_k^\\dagger$) and annihilation ($c_k$) operators for single-particle states $|k\\rangle$:\n\n$H_0 = \\sum_k \\epsilon_k c_k^\\dagger c_k$\n\nHere, $|k\\rangle$ represents a complete set of single-particle eigenstates (e.g., plane waves with momentum $k$), and $\\epsilon_k$ are the corresponding single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n\nThe time-ordered bare Green's function is formally defined in the operator formalism as the expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators in the non-interacting ground state:\n\n$G_0(x_1, t_1; x_2, t_2) = -i \\langle \\Psi_0 | T[\\psi(x_1, t_1) \\psi^\\dagger(x_2, t_2)] | \\Psi_0 \\rangle$\nwhere $T$ is the time-ordering operator.\n\n**Step 2: Express the Green's Function using the Path Integral**\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, physical quantities are calculated using functional integrals over fields (in this case, Grassmann fields $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$ for fermions). The Green's function is expressed as a two-point correlation function:\n\n$G_0(x_1, t_1; x_2, t_2) = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, \\psi(x_1, t_1) \\bar{\\psi}(x_2, t_2) e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}$\n\nwhere $S_0$ is the action for the non-interacting system.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe action $S_0$ corresponds to the Hamiltonian $H_0$. It is quadratic in the fields and can be written as:\n\n$S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int dt \\int d^d x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(x, t) (i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - h_0) \\psi(x, t)$\n\nHere, $h_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator in the position representation (e.g., $h_0 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2 \\nabla^2}{2m} + V(x)$). The eigenvalues of this operator are the $\\epsilon_k$. The Green's function $G_0$ is the inverse of the operator $(i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - h_0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Diagonalize the Action**\n\nTo evaluate the path integral, the most effective method is to change the basis to one that diagonalizes the operator $(i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - h_0)$. This is achieved in two steps:\n1.  **Spatial Transformation:** We expand the fields $\\psi(x,t)$ in the basis of eigenstates of $h_0$. These are the states $|k\\rangle$ with wavefunctions $\\phi_k(x) = \\langle x | k \\rangle$. In this basis, the operator $h_0$ becomes a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ on the diagonal.\n2.  **Temporal Transformation:** We perform a Fourier transform from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$). This transforms the time derivative operator $i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ into multiplication by $\\hbar\\omega$.\n\nLet's expand the field $\\psi(x, t)$ in this basis:\n$\\psi(x, t) = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\psi_k(\\omega) \\phi_k(x) e^{-i\\omega t}$\n\nSubstituting this into the action $S_0$ (setting $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity):\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n\nThe action is now completely diagonal in the $(k, \\omega)$ basis.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Green's Function in the Diagonal Basis**\n\nWith the diagonal action, the path integral becomes a product of independent integrals for each $(k, \\omega)$ mode. The two-point function $\\langle \\psi_k(\\omega) \\bar{\\psi}_{k'}(\\omega') \\rangle$ can be calculated directly. From the properties of Gaussian integrals over Grassmann variables, this correlation function is simply the inverse of the kernel in the quadratic action.\n\nThe Green's function in this basis, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is therefore:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\nTo handle the singularity at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$ correctly and ensure causality, an infinitesimal imaginary part, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), is added. The precise form depends on whether the state $|k\\rangle$ is occupied or unoccupied relative to the Fermi sea (chemical potential $\\mu$). For the time-ordered Feynman Green's function, the prescription is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nThis can also be written as:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1 - f_k}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta} + \\frac{f_k}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\eta}$\nwhere $f_k$ is the zero-temperature Fermi function $\\theta(\\mu - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full:** This analysis is strictly for the *bare* Green's function ($G_0$) of a *non-interacting* system. In an interacting system, the full Green's function ($G$) has a more complex structure where the self-energy modifies the denominator.\n2.  **Choice of Basis:** The simple relationship between $G_0$ and $\\epsilon_k$ is only manifest in the basis that diagonalizes the single-particle Hamiltonian, which is the energy-momentum eigenbasis.\n3.  **Physical Interpretation:** The most crucial point is that the **poles** of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane occur exactly at the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. These poles represent the energies required to add or remove a single, non-interacting particle from the system.\n4.  **Causality and the $i\\eta$ Prescription:** The $i\\eta$ term is not a mathematical convenience but is essential for correctly defining the time-ordered product and ensuring the Green's function has the correct causal properties.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is that, in the energy-momentum representation $(k, \\omega)$, $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. The poles of $G_0(k, \\omega)$ in the complex frequency plane are located precisely at the single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$, when represented in the frequency-momentum basis $(k, \\omega)$, is a simple algebraic function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. Its functional dependence is given by the expression $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta_{k}}$, where $\\eta_k$ is an infinitesimal term whose sign depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied or empty. Thus, $G_0$ is characterized by having simple poles in the complex frequency plane located exactly at the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
