    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the curve for the first interval, $t \\in [0, \\pi]$.**\nIn this interval, the parameter $b=1$. The parametric equations of the curve are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\sin t$\nWe can recognize this from the identity $\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which gives us the Cartesian equation $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. This is the equation of a unit circle centered at the origin.\nLet's trace the path as $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n*   At $t=0$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n*   At $t=\\pi/2$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos(\\pi/2), \\sin(\\pi/2)) = (0, 1)$.\n*   At $t=\\pi$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\nThis part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of the unit circle.\nThe extreme values for this part are:\n*   Maximum x-value: 1\n*   Minimum x-value: -1\n*   Maximum y-value: 1\n*   Minimum y-value: 0\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the curve for the second interval, $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$.**\nIn this interval, the parameter $b=5$. The parametric equations of the curve are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5 \\sin t$\nFrom these equations, we can write $x = \\cos t$ and $y/5 = \\sin t$. Using the identity $\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, we get the Cartesian equation $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$, or $x^2 + y^2/25 = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a semi-minor axis of length 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of length 5 along the y-axis.\nLet's trace the path as $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$:\n*   As $t$ approaches $\\pi$, the point approaches $(\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n*   At $t=3\\pi/2$, the point is $(x, y) = (\\cos(3\\pi/2), 5\\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n*   As $t$ approaches $2\\pi$, the point approaches $(\\cos(2\\pi), 5\\sin(2\\pi)) = (1, 0)$.\nThis part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse.\nThe extreme values for this part are:\n*   Maximum x-value: 1\n*   Minimum x-value: -1\n*   Maximum y-value: 0\n*   Minimum y-value: -5\n\n**Step 3: Determine the bounding box of the entire figure.**\nThe complete figure is the union of the upper semi-circle and the lower semi-ellipse. To find the smallest square that circumscribes this figure, we first need to find its overall bounding box by combining the ranges of x and y from both parts.\n*   **Overall x-range:** The x-values for both parts vary between -1 and 1. So, the overall minimum x is $x_{min} = -1$ and the overall maximum x is $x_{max} = 1$.\n*   **Overall y-range:** The y-values for the first part range from 0 to 1. The y-values for the second part range from -5 to 0. Combining these, the overall y-range is from -5 to 1. So, the overall minimum y is $y_{min} = -5$ and the overall maximum y is $y_{max} = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box.**\nThe width of the bounding box is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values:\nWidth = $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\nThe height of the bounding box is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values:\nHeight = $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of dimensions 2x6.\n\n**Step 5: Find the area of the smallest circumscribing square.**\nA square that circumscribes (outcircles) this 2x6 rectangle must have a side length at least as large as the larger dimension of the rectangle.\nSide length of the square, $S = \\max(\\text{Width, Height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\nThe area of this square is $S^2$.\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
