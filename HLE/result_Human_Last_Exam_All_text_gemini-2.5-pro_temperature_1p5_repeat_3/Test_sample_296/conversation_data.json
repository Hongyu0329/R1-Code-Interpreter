    "Answering this question requires analyzing the structure of the Grigorchuk group, denoted by `G`. The number of subgroups of a given index can be found by classifying them as either normal or non-normal and counting each type.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Preliminary Properties of the Grigorchuk Group (G)**\n\n*   `G` is a finitely generated group (by 4 involutions `a, b, c, d`).\n*   `G` is a residually finite 2-group. This is a crucial property, as it implies that any finite quotient of `G` must be a finite 2-group (a group whose order is a power of 2). Consequently, any subgroup of finite index must have an index that is a power of 2. An index of 4 is therefore possible.\n*   The abelianization of `G` is known to be `G^{ab} = G/[G, G] \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2`, where `[G, G]` is the commutator subgroup and `C_2` is the cyclic group of order 2. This group has order `2^3 = 8`.\n\n**2. Counting Normal Subgroups of Index 4**\n\nA subgroup `H` of `G` is normal with index 4 if and only if the quotient group `G/H` is a group of order 4. The possible groups of order 4 are the cyclic group `C_4` and the Klein four-group `V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2`.\n\n*   Any homomorphism from `G` to an abelian group (like `C_4` or `V_4`) must factor through its abelianization `G^{ab}`.\n*   **Case 1: `G/H \\cong C_4`**\n    For this to be possible, there must be a surjective homomorphism (epimorphism) from `G` to `C_4`. This would imply there is an epimorphism from `G^{ab} = C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2` to `C_4`. However, every element in `C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2` has order 1 or 2. In `C_4`, there is an element of order 4. It's impossible to map onto `C_4` from a group where no element has order greater than 2. Thus, `G` has no normal subgroups with quotient `C_4`.\n*   **Case 2: `G/H \\cong V_4`**\n    For this to be possible, there must be an epimorphism from `G` to `V_4`. This is equivalent to finding epimorphisms from `G^{ab} = C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2` to `V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2`. Such epimorphisms exist.\n    The normal subgroups `H` with `G/H \\cong V_4` are precisely the subgroups of `G` that contain the commutator subgroup `[G,G]` and have index 4 in `G`. By the lattice isomorphism theorem, counting these is equivalent to counting subgroups of index 4 in `G/[G,G] \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2`.\n    A subgroup of index 4 in `C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2` (which has order 8) must have order `8 / 4 = 2`.\n    A group of order 2 is generated by a single element of order 2. In `C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2`, there are `2^3 - 1 = 7` non-identity elements, all of which have order 2. Each of these 7 elements generates a unique subgroup of order 2.\n    Therefore, there are **7** such subgroups.\n\nSo, there are **7** normal subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n\n**3. Counting Non-Normal Subgroups of Index 4**\n\nLet `H` be a non-normal subgroup of `G` with index `[G:H] = 4`.\n\n*   Consider the core of `H`, `N = Core_G(H) = \\bigcap_{g \\in G} gHg^{-1}`. This is the largest normal subgroup of `G` contained in `H`.\n*   The quotient group `G/N` acts faithfully and transitively on the set of left cosets `G/H`. This means `G/N` is isomorphic to a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group `S_4`.\n*   Since `H` is not normal, `N` must be a proper subgroup of `H`. Therefore, `[G:N] = [G:H][H:N] = 4 \\cdot [H:N] > 4`.\n*   The order of `G/N`, which is `[G:N]`, must be a power of 2 (since `G` is a 2-group) and must divide `|S_4|=24`. The only power of 2 greater than 4 that divides 24 is 8.\n*   So, `[G:N] = 8`, and `G/N` must be a transitive subgroup of `S_4` of order 8. The only such group (up to isomorphism) is the dihedral group `D_8`. This implies that `G` must have a quotient group isomorphic to `D_8`. (This is a known fact; the action of `G` on the second level of the binary tree induces an epimorphism onto a group isomorphic to `D_8`).\n*   From `[G:N] = [G:H][H:N]`, we have `8 = 4 \\cdot [H:N]`, which implies `[H:N] = 2`. This means `H/N` is a subgroup of index 2 in `G/N \\cong D_8`.\n*   For `H` to be a non-normal subgroup of `G`, `H/N` must be a non-normal subgroup of `G/N`.\n*   Now we must check if `D_8` has any non-normal subgroups of index 2.\n    *   A subgroup `K` of a group `Q` is normal if it contains the commutator subgroup `Q'`.\n    *   The commutator subgroup of `D_8` is `D_8' = \\langle r^2 \\rangle`, where `r` is an element of order 4. This subgroup has order 2.\n    *   Subgroups of index 2 in `D_8` have order `8/2 = 4`.\n    *   The subgroups of order 4 in `D_8` are: one cyclic subgroup `\\langle r \\rangle` and two Klein four-subgroups (`\\langle s, r^2 \\rangle` and `\\langle sr, r^2 \\rangle`, where `s` is an involution).\n    *   All three of these subgroups of order 4 contain the element `r^2`. Therefore, they all contain the commutator subgroup `D_8'`.\n    *   This implies that **all subgroups of index 2 in `D_8` are normal**.\n*   This leads to a contradiction. We assumed `H` was non-normal, which requires `H/N` to be non-normal in `G/N`. But we found that all possible subgroups for `H/N` (subgroups of index 2 in `D_8`) are normal.\n*   Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. There are **no** non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the normal and non-normal subgroups.\nTotal number = (Number of normal subgroups) + (Number of non-normal subgroups)\nTotal number = 7 + 0 = 7.\n\n>>>7"
