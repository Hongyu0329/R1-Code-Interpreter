    "Answering this question requires applying Lie group analysis to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions. The dimension of the Lie group is equal to the number of independent infinitesimal generators that leave the equations invariant.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find these generators:\n\n1.  **The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations:**\n    The equations for the velocity field $\\vec{u}(t, \\vec{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\vec{x})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are:\n    *   Momentum equation: $\\frac{\\partial \\vec{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\vec{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\vec{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\vec{u}$\n    *   Incompressibility condition: $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{u} = 0$\n    (We assume constant density $\\rho=1$ and constant kinematic viscosity $\\nu \\neq 0$, with no external forces).\n\n2.  **Galilean Symmetries:**\n    These are the classical symmetries of Newtonian mechanics, which are expected to hold for the Navier-Stokes equations.\n    *   **Time translation:** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on $t$), so they are invariant under $t \\to t + c$. This gives **1 generator** ($\\partial_t$).\n    *   **Space translations:** The equations have no special origin in space, so they are invariant under $\\vec{x} \\to \\vec{x} + \\vec{c}$. This gives **3 generators** ($\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$).\n    *   **Spatial rotations:** The equations are isotropic (no preferred direction), so they are invariant under rotations $\\vec{x} \\to R\\vec{x}$ (where $R$ is a rotation matrix). The group of rotations in 3D is SO(3), which is 3-dimensional. This gives **3 generators** corresponding to rotations about each axis.\n    *   **Galilean boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change to a constantly moving reference frame: $\\vec{x} \\to \\vec{x} + \\vec{v}_0 t$, $\\vec{u} \\to \\vec{u} + \\vec{v}_0$. This gives **3 generators** of the form $t\\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$.\n\n    Counting these up, the Galilean symmetries contribute $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10$ generators.\n\n3.  **Scaling Symmetry (Dilation):**\n    We can look for symmetries of the form $t \\to a^2 t, \\vec{x} \\to a\\vec{x}, \\vec{u} \\to a^{-1}\\vec{u}, p \\to a^{-2}p$. Substituting this into the Navier-Stokes equations shows that they remain invariant. This single-parameter group of transformations gives **1 generator**, often written as $D = 2t\\partial_t + \\sum x_i \\partial_{x_i} - \\sum u_i \\partial_{u_i} - 2p\\partial_p$.\n\n    So far, we have $10 + 1 = 11$ generators. This 11-dimensional algebra is often called the \"principal Lie algebra\" of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n4.  **Pressure \"Gauge\" Symmetry:**\n    Notice that the pressure $p$ only appears in the equation through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This means that if we replace $p$ with $p' = p + h(t)$, where $h(t)$ is any arbitrary function of time, the term $\\nabla p$ remains unchanged ($\\nabla p' = \\nabla p$). This invariance under the transformation $p \\to p + h(t)$ gives rise to an infinite-dimensional family of symmetries, with generators of the form $h(t)\\partial_p$.\n\n5.  **Determining the Final Dimension:**\n    The question asks for \"the dimension\", which implies a finite number. The existence of the infinite-dimensional symmetry algebra presents an ambiguity. There are two main conventions in the literature:\n    a) Consider the infinite-dimensional symmetries as \"gauge\" freedoms and quotient them out. The dimension of the remaining \"essential\" symmetry algebra is **11**. This is the viewpoint in some modern handbooks (e.g., Ibragimov's).\n    b) Include the simplest generator from the infinite-dimensional family, which corresponds to a constant shift in pressure ($h(t)=c$). This adds **1 generator**, $\\partial_p$. This is a well-established convention in foundational works on the subject (e.g., the book by Fushchych, Shtelen, and Serov).\n\n    Following the convention (b), which is explicitly stated in several key texts to define the \"maximal invariance algebra,\" we add the pressure shift generator to the 11 generators found previously. The resulting set of 12 generators forms a closed Lie algebra.\n\n    Therefore, the total dimension is:\n    10 (Galilean) + 1 (Dilation) + 1 (Pressure Shift) = 12.\n\nFinal list of symmetries:\n*   Time translation (1)\n*   Space translations (3)\n*   Rotations (3)\n*   Galilean boosts (3)\n*   Dilation (1)\n*   Constant pressure shift (1)\n\nTotal: $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\n<<<12>>>"
