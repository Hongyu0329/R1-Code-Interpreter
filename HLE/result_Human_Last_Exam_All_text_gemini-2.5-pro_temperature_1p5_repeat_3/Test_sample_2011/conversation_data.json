    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the core concepts\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question:\n\n*   **Graph on n = 128 vertices:** A collection of 128 points (vertices) and a set of lines (edges) connecting pairs of these vertices. The question considers *all possible* such graphs.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique with `k` vertices is denoted as `K_k`.\n*   **Clique Size:** The number of vertices in a clique. For a `K_k`, the size is `k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** Given a graph `G` and a subset of its vertices `S`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` consists of the vertices `S` and *all* the edges from `G` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **Simultaneously Appear:** All the different-sized cliques must exist as induced subgraphs within the *same single graph*.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find a single graph `G` with 128 vertices that maximizes the count of different values of `k` for which `K_k` is an induced subgraph of `G`.\n\n### Step 2: The crucial link between induced cliques of different sizes\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between induced cliques within a single graph.\nSuppose a graph `G` has an induced clique of size `k_max`. This means there is a set of `k_max` vertices, let's call it `V_max`, such that every vertex in `V_max` is connected to every other vertex in `V_max`.\n\nNow, let's consider any integer `k` where `1 <= k < k_max`. Can we find an induced clique of size `k` in this same graph `G`?\n\nYes, we can. We simply need to choose any subset of `k` vertices from our set `V_max`. Let's call this smaller subset `V_k`. Since every vertex in `V_max` is connected to every other vertex in `V_max`, it must be true that every vertex in the subset `V_k` is also connected to every other vertex in `V_k`.\n\nThe subgraph induced by `V_k` will therefore be a complete graph of size `k`, i.e., a `K_k`.\n\nThis leads to a critical realization:\n\n**Careful Point 1:** If a graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `k_max`, it is guaranteed to also contain induced cliques of all sizes `k` for `1 <= k <= k_max`.\n\n### Step 3: Simplifying the problem\n\nBased on the insight from Step 2, the set of all possible induced clique sizes that can appear in any given graph `G` is not just a random collection of numbers. It will always be a continuous sequence of integers starting from 1: `{1, 2, 3, ..., k_max}`, where `k_max` is the size of the largest induced clique in `G`.\n\nTherefore, the *number of different clique sizes* is simply `k_max`.\n\nThe problem can now be rephrased much more simply:\n\n**Simplified Question:** What is the maximum possible size of an induced clique in any graph on `n=128` vertices?\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Maximizing the number of different clique sizes is equivalent to maximizing the size of the single largest induced clique.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the maximum possible size of an induced clique\n\nWe are given `n = 128` vertices. A clique is a subset of these vertices. The size of any subset of vertices cannot exceed the total number of vertices. Therefore, the maximum possible size of any clique in a graph with 128 vertices is 128.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The total number of vertices `n` provides a hard upper bound on the size of any clique.\n\nNow, we must confirm that it's actually possible to construct a graph that achieves this maximum. Consider the **complete graph** `K_128`. This is a graph on 128 vertices where every single pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\n\n*   In the graph `K_{128}`, the set of all 128 vertices forms a clique of size 128.\n*   This clique is an induced subgraph (as it is the entire graph).\n*   The size of the largest induced clique in `K_{128}` is `k_max = 128`.\n\n### Step 5: Final conclusion\n\nSince we have found a specific graph, `K_{128}`, where the largest induced clique size is 128, the number of different clique sizes in this graph is also 128 (corresponding to induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., 128). Since no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique of size greater than 128, this is the maximum possible number.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis:\n1.  The problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes.\n2.  We established that if a graph has an induced `K_k`, it must have an induced `K_j` for all `j < k`.\n3.  This means the number of different clique sizes is determined by the size of the largest induced clique, `k_max`.\n4.  The problem becomes: what is the maximum possible value of `k_max` for a graph with 128 vertices?\n5.  A graph cannot have a clique larger than its total number of vertices, so `k_max <= 128`.\n6.  The complete graph `K_{128}` has an induced clique of size 128.\n7.  Therefore, the maximum possible value for `k_max` is 128, and thus the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
