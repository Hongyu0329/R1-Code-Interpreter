    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Film Requirement:** The film must have been nominated for at least one Academy Award (Oscar).\n    *   **Setting/Action:** A character is boarding a bus.\n    *   **Key Dialogue:** The character says the specific phrase \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **Consequence:** This act of saying \"Thank you\" is the specific event that \"seals his fate,\" meaning it leads directly to a negative, irreversible outcome, likely death or capture.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Filtering:**\n    *   The nature of the clue (a seemingly innocuous phrase having fatal consequences) points towards a crime, thriller, or spy film. In these genres, small details and behavioral tells are often used as plot devices.\n    *   We need to recall films with pivotal bus scenes. Many films have bus scenes, but few hinge on such a specific piece of dialogue.\n    *   We can eliminate films where bus travel is central but doesn't fit the context, like *Speed*, *Forrest Gump*, or *Little Miss Sunshine*.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Film and Scene:**\n    *   The film that perfectly matches this description is the 1997 neo-noir crime film, **L.A. Confidential**.\n    *   Let's check the criteria against this film.\n\n### Careful Points and Scene Breakdown\n\n*   **Is the film Oscar-nominated?**\n    *   Yes. *L.A. Confidential* was a critical success and was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It won for Best Supporting Actress (Kim Basinger) and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\n*   **Who is the character and what is the situation?**\n    *   The character is **Leland \"Buzz\" Meeks**, a corrupt ex-cop who has come into a large amount of money from a heroin deal. He is trying to flee Los Angeles to start a new life.\n    *   He is being hunted by the film's primary antagonist, the secretly corrupt police captain **Dudley Smith** (played by James Cromwell), who needs to eliminate Meeks as a loose end.\n\n*   **How does the scene play out?**\n    *   Captain Smith has his men staking out the bus depot, but they don't know what Buzz Meeks looks like.\n    *   Smith provides them with a key behavioral profile. He tells his men that Meeks is an ex-cop, and cops have a certain ingrained politeness and professional courtesy.\n    *   Smith's instruction is that a cop, out of habit, will say \"thank you\" to a bus driver. He bets that Meeks will do exactly that.\n    *   The camera shows Meeks, looking nervous, boarding the bus. He hands his ticket to the driver and, just as predicted, says a quiet **\"Thank you.\"**\n    *   This confirms his identity to Smith's men, who are watching from a car. They proceed to follow the bus, intercept Meeks at a later stop, and kill him.\n\n*   **How does this \"seal his fate?\"**\n    *   Up until that moment, Meeks was an anonymous face in a crowd and was seconds away from successfully escaping. The simple, almost unconscious act of saying \"Thank you\"—a tell rooted in his former profession—is what gives him away and leads directly to his murder. His fate is sealed by this small gesture.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe scene described in the question occurs in the Oscar-nominated film *L.A. Confidential*, where the character Buzz Meeks is identified and subsequently killed because he politely says \"Thank you\" to a bus driver.\n\n<<<L.A. Confidential>>>"
