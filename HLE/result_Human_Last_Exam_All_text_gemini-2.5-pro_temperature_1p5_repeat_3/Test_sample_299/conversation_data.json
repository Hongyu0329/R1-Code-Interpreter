    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function $f$.**\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$. We want to find the cardinality of this set, $|S|$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. The given equation tells us this is equivalent to $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function $g(x)=e^x$ is injective (one-to-one), we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** A continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is injective must be strictly monotonic. That is, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**Step 2: Rule out the possibility of strictly decreasing solutions.**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function.\n\n1.  **Limits at infinity:** As a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, the limits at $\\pm\\infty$ must exist in the extended real numbers. Let $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = L$ and $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = M$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $L = \\inf_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} f(x)$ and $M = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} f(x)$. The range of $f$ is the open interval $(L, M)$.\n\n2.  **Behavior of the composition $f \\circ f$:**\n    *   Let's find the limit of $f(f(x))$ as $x \\to \\infty$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $y = f(x) \\to L$ from above (since $f$ is decreasing). Then $f(y) \\to M$ because $f$ maps values near the infimum of its domain to values near the supremum of its range. So, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(f(x)) = M$.\n    *   From the original equation, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} e^x = \\infty$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $M = \\infty$.\n\n    *   Now, let's find the limit of $f(f(x))$ as $x \\to -\\infty$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $y = f(x) \\to M = \\infty$. Then $f(y) \\to L$ as $y \\to \\infty$. So, $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = L$.\n    *   From the original equation, $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} e^x = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $L = 0$.\n\n3.  **Range of $f$ and a key identity:** From the limit analysis, if a strictly decreasing solution exists, its range must be $(0, \\infty)$. This implies that $f(x) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Any solution $f$ must commute with the function $g(x) = e^x$. This can be shown as follows:\n    $f(e^x) = f(f(f(x)))$\n    $e^{f(x)} = f(f(f(x)))$\n    Thus, $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n4.  **The contradiction:** Let's take the limit of the identity $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n    *   Left-hand side (LHS): Let $u = e^x$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $u \\to \\infty$. So, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(e^x) = \\lim_{u \\to \\infty} f(u) = L = 0$.\n    *   Right-hand side (RHS): Using the continuity of the exponential function, $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} e^{f(x)} = e^{\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)} = e^L = e^0 = 1$.\n    *   Equating the limits gives $0 = 1$, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions that satisfy the given equation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze strictly increasing solutions and find their cardinality.**\n\nSince any solution must be monotonic and cannot be decreasing, it must be strictly increasing. Let's demonstrate that such solutions exist and find how many there are.\n\n1.  **Commutation and fixed points:** As shown before, any increasing solution $f$ must also satisfy $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$. Let $c = f(0)$. Then $f(f(0)) = e^0=1$, which means $f(c)=1$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing:\n    *   If $c=0$, then $f(0)=0$. But then $f(f(0)) = f(0)=0 \\neq 1$.\n    *   If $c > 1$, then from $c>1$ we get $f(c) > f(1)$. But $f(c)=1$, so $1 > f(1)$. From the commutation relation, $f(1) = f(e^0) = e^{f(0)} = e^c$. So we have $1 > e^c$. This implies $0 > c$, which contradicts $c>1$.\n    *   If $c<0$, then from $c<0$ we get $f(c)<f(0)=c$. So $1<c$. This contradicts $c<0$.\n    *   If $c=1$, then $f(0)=1$. So $f(f(0))=f(1)=1$. But $e^0=1$. This looks possible so far. However, $f(1) = e^{f(0)} = e^1 = e$. So $f(1)$ must be both $1$ and $e$, a contradiction.\n    *   The only remaining possibility is $0 < c < 1$. Let's check consistency. If $0<c<1$, then $f(0)=c$. From $f(c)=1$ and $f$ increasing, we need $f(c)>f(0)$, which is $1>c$. This is consistent. Also $f(1) = e^c > e^0=1$. This is also consistent.\n    So, for any strictly increasing solution, $f(0)$ must be a number $c \\in (0,1)$.\n\n2.  **Construction of solutions:** We can construct solutions by defining $f$ on a small interval and then extending it to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   Let's pick any $c \\in (0,1)$. Let $f(0)=c$. We know this implies $f(c)=1$.\n    *   Choose an arbitrary continuous and strictly increasing function $\\phi: [0, c] \\to [c, 1]$ such that $\\phi(0) = c$ and $\\phi(c) = 1$. Let's define $f(x) = \\phi(x)$ for $x \\in [0,c]$. There are infinitely many such functions $\\phi$. For example, the linear function $\\phi(x) = c + \\frac{1-c}{c}x$.\n    *   Now we must define $f$ on the interval $[c,1]$. For any $y \\in [0,c]$, the equation $f(f(y)) = e^y$ must hold. Since $y \\in [0,c]$, $f(y)=\\phi(y)$ is in the interval $[c,1]$. So this equation defines how $f$ must act on the interval $[c,1]$. Let $x = \\phi(y) \\in [c,1]$. Then $y = \\phi^{-1}(x)$. We must define $f(x) = f(\\phi(y)) = e^y = e^{\\phi^{-1}(x)}$.\n    *   With this, we have defined a continuous, strictly increasing function $f$ on the interval $[0,1]$ which satisfies $f(f(x))=e^x$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$.\n    *   We can extend this definition to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the commutation relation $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$. For any $x>1$, we can write $x = e^{e^{...e^y}}$ for some $y \\in [0,1)$ and define $f(x)$ recursively. For any $x<0$, we use $f(x) = \\ln(f(e^x))$. This construction yields a well-defined continuous and strictly increasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the original equation everywhere.\n\n3.  **Counting the solutions:** The construction depends on two choices:\n    a. The choice of the constant $c = f(0) \\in (0,1)$. The set of possible values for $c$ is the interval $(0,1)$, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n    b. For each choice of $c$, the choice of a continuous strictly increasing bijection $\\phi: [0, c] \\to [c, 1]$. The set of such functions also has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. To see this, one can, for example, choose any value for $\\phi(c/2)$ in $(c,1)$ and connect the points with two monotonic functions. The freedom in this choice shows there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions. Since the set of all continuous functions on an interval is $\\mathfrak{c}$, there can be no more than that.\n\nSince we have a family of solutions indexed by pairs $(c, \\phi)$, the total number of solutions is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$. The total number of continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$, so there can be at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions.\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set of solutions is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The cardinality is that of the continuum, often denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$, $|\\mathbb{R}|$, or $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
