    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome (the square in front of the Pantheon).\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action:** It was removed.\n    *   **Date:** In 1950.\n    *   **Agent:** The city administration.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Elimination of Incorrect Options:**\n    *   The most famous features removed from the area are the two bell towers, nicknamed \"the donkey's ears\" (*orecchie d'asino*), which were added to the Pantheon's facade by the artist Bernini in the 17th century. However, these were removed much earlier, between 1883 and 1892. Therefore, this is not the correct answer as the date does not match.\n    *   The fountain in the center of the square (Fontana del Pantheon) was not removed; it is still there. The Egyptian obelisk was added to the fountain in 1711 and also remains.\n    *   The Pantheon itself was, of course, not removed.\n\n3.  **Focusing on the 1950 Timeframe:**\n    *   The year 1950 is significant. This is the post-World War II period in Italy, a time of reconstruction, modernization, and significant changes to urban infrastructure.\n    *   In Rome, this era saw a major reorganization of the public transport system. Many tram lines running through the congested historic center were deemed obsolete or disruptive.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Feature:**\n    *   Historical records and photographs from the first half of the 20th century show a tram line that ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda, with tracks curving right in front of the Pantheon's portico.\n    *   This tram line, with its tracks, overhead electrical wires, and the passing trams themselves, was a very prominent feature of the square for decades.\n    *   While a tram line is primarily infrastructure, its presence so dramatically impacted the visual landscape and experience of the historic architecture that it can be considered a defining, if incongruous, feature of the square during that period. Its removal was a significant urban planning and aesthetic decision.\n\n5.  **Confirming the Details:**\n    *   The decision to remove the tram tracks from the Piazza della Rotonda and other parts of the historic center was made by Rome's city administration.\n    *   The removal was part of a larger plan to replace trams with more flexible bus lines and to begin pedestrianizing key historical areas, restoring their appearance to something closer to a pre-industrial state. This process took place in the late 1940s and was largely completed by 1950.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **The term \"architectural feature\":** One must interpret this term broadly. The tram line was not a building, but it was a man-made structure that fundamentally altered the architectural composition and perception of the square for a long period.\n*   **The date is key:** The year 1950 is the crucial piece of information that rules out more famous alterations, like the removal of Bernini's bell towers.\n*   **Context of the era:** Understanding the post-war drive for modernization and traffic management in Rome is essential to grasping why the city administration would remove the tram line.\n*   **Visual impact:** The removal of the tracks and overhead wires was not a minor change; it completely transformed the foreground of one of the world's most famous architectural views, allowing for an unobstructed appreciation of the Pantheon.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe unique feature that was present in the Piazza della Rotonda until its removal by the city administration in 1950 was the public tram line, including its tracks and overhead wires, which passed directly through the square.\n\n<<<The tram line>>>"
