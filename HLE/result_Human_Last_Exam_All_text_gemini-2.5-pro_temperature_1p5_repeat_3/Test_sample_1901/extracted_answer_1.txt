D. Specific example structure:
4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) modified to a single ring to 4-cyano-4'-pentylbenzene
The most significant flaw in the logic is presented in statement D. The analogy made between the biphenyl system (5CB) and a single-ring system is invalid. The removal of a phenyl ring drastically reduces the molecular aspect ratio, which is the key factor for liquid crystallinity. The resulting molecule, 4-pentylbenzonitrile, is not a liquid crystal, and therefore the entire subsequent design strategy (E and F) based on this structure is fundamentally flawed.
