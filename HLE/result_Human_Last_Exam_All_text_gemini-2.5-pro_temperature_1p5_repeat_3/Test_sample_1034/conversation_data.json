    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given a triangle ABC with the following information:\n1.  The length of side BC is S, where S = SNYWR.\n2.  The measure of angle B is 30째.\n3.  We need to find the number of possible integer values for the length of side AC such that there are exactly two possible values for the length of side AB.\n\n**Step 2: Decipher the value of S**\nThe term `S = SNYWR` is a placeholder. In contest math, such strings often represent a value derived from the letters themselves or the answer to a previous problem. A common method is to use A1Z26 substitution and sum the values.\n*   S = 19\n*   N = 14\n*   Y = 25\n*   W = 23\n*   R = 18\nSumming these values: `S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99`.\nSo, we will proceed with the side length BC = 99.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the relevant geometric condition**\nThe problem describes a scenario of constructing a triangle given two sides and a non-included angle (SSA). This is known as the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines. The condition for having two possible triangles is very specific.\n\nLet's denote the side lengths as follows:\n*   `a` = BC = 99\n*   `b` = AC (the length we are trying to find)\n*   `c` = AB\n*   Angle B = 30째\n\nFor two distinct triangles (and thus two possible lengths for side AB) to exist, the length of the side opposite the given angle (AC = `b`) must be greater than the altitude from the third vertex (C) to the line containing side AB, but less than the other given side (BC = `a`).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the altitude**\nLet `h` be the altitude from vertex C to the line containing side AB. In the right-angled triangle formed by this altitude, we have:\n`sin(B) = h / BC`\n`h = BC * sin(B)`\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n`h = 99 * sin(30째)`\nSince `sin(30째) = 1/2`:\n`h = 99 * (1/2) = 49.5`\n\n**Step 5: Apply the condition for two triangles**\nThe condition for two possible triangles is:\n`h < b < a`\n\nSubstituting the values we have for `h` and `a`:\n`49.5 < AC < 99`\n\n**Step 6: Count the possible integer values**\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values of AC that satisfy this inequality. We need to find the number of integers `k` such that `49.5 < k < 99`.\n\n*   The smallest integer greater than 49.5 is 50.\n*   The largest integer less than 99 is 98.\n\nSo, the possible integer values for AC are 50, 51, 52, ..., 98. To count the number of integers in this range, we can use the formula: (Last Value - First Value) + 1.\n\nNumber of values = (98 - 50) + 1\nNumber of values = 48 + 1\nNumber of values = 49\n\nTherefore, there are 49 integer values for the length of AC that result in two possible triangles.\n\n<<<49>>>"
