    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of unique members belonging to the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans (`Homo sapiens`).\n\n**Step 2: Define what constitutes a \"family member\".**\nIn the context of miRNA families, a \"member\" typically refers to a unique mature miRNA sequence. The let-7 family is characterized by a highly conserved seed sequence (positions 2-8 of the mature miRNA), which is crucial for target recognition. Multiple genes (paralogs) located at different positions in the genome can produce the exact same mature miRNA sequence. The question is asking for the number of these unique mature sequences, not the total number of genes.\n\n**Step 3: Consult an authoritative database for miRNA information.**\nThe primary and most widely accepted repository for miRNA sequence data, annotation, and nomenclature is miRBase. We will use this as our primary source to identify the members.\n\n**Step 4: List the human let-7 family members from the database.**\nBy querying miRBase for let-7 family miRNAs in *Homo sapiens*, we can compile a list of the distinct family members. The standard nomenclature for human miRNAs is \"hsa-mir-...\" for the precursor and \"hsa-let-...\" for the mature miRNA.\n\nThe established members of the human let-7 family are:\n1.  **let-7a**\n2.  **let-7b**\n3.  **let-7c**\n4.  **let-7d**\n5.  **let-7e**\n6.  **let-7f**\n7.  **let-7g**\n8.  **let-7i**\n9.  **miR-98** (While it has a different name, miR-98 is universally considered a member of the let-7 family due to its high sequence similarity and shared seed sequence).\n\n**Step 5: Distinguish between \"members\" and \"genes\".**\nThis is a critical point. While there are 9 unique members (mature sequences), they are encoded by a larger number of genes.\n*   `let-7a` is encoded by 3 genes (`hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, `hsa-let-7a-3`).\n*   `let-7f` is encoded by 2 genes (`hsa-let-7f-1`, `hsa-let-7f-2`).\n*   The other 7 members are each encoded by a single gene.\nThis leads to a total of 12 distinct genes (3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12 genes or paralogs). However, the question asks for the number of *members*, which, by convention, refers to the 9 distinct mature miRNA types.\n\n**Step 6: Final Count.**\nBased on the list compiled in Step 4, counting the distinct members gives a total of 9. This number is widely cited in scientific literature and consistent with the data in miRBase.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Members vs. Genes:** Be precise about whether the question implies unique mature miRNAs or the genes that encode them. The term \"members\" almost always refers to the unique mature sequences.\n*   **Family Inclusion:** Understand that family classification is based on sequence homology, specifically the seed sequence. This is why `miR-98` is included in the let-7 family despite its name.\n*   **Database Version:** miRNA discoveries are ongoing, but the let-7 family is highly conserved and well-studied. Its composition has been stable for many years, so the current count is reliable.\n*   **Organism Specificity:** The number of family members can vary between species. The analysis was specifically limited to humans (`Homo sapiens`).\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy systematically identifying the unique mature miRNA sequences that constitute the human let-7 family using authoritative biological databases, we arrive at the final count.\n\n1.  List the members: let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98.\n2.  Count the items in the list.\n3.  The total is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
