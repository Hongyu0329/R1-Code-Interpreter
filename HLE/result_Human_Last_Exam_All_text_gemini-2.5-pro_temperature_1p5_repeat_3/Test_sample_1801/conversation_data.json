    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify two specific individuals who meet the following criteria:\n1.  They are Nobel laureates.\n2.  They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n3.  The commercial was from the year 2000.\n4.  The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why.\"\n5.  The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" which likely refers to the irony of its message given Enron's subsequent collapse due to massive corporate fraud.\n\n**Step 2: Research the \"Ask Why\" Campaign**\nA search for \"Enron Ask Why commercial 2000\" confirms that Enron launched a high-profile advertising campaign with this exact tagline. The campaign's goal was to rebrand Enron from just an energy company to an innovative, forward-thinking leader in the new economy. The ads featured various intellectuals and thought leaders to lend an air of credibility and sophistication to the company.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Featured Individuals**\nResearch into this specific ad campaign consistently reveals the names of the key figures featured. The two most prominent figures who are also Nobel laureates are:\n1.  **K. Carey Mullis**\n2.  **Paul Krugman**\n\n**Step 4: Verify Nobel Laureate Status (A Careful Point)**\nThis step is crucial for ensuring accuracy, especially regarding the timing.\n*   **K. Carey Mullis:** He won the **Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993** for his invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Therefore, at the time the commercial aired in 2000, he was already a Nobel laureate.\n*   **Paul Krugman:** He won the **Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008** for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity. This is a critical point: at the time the commercial aired in 2000, he was a prominent economist at MIT, but he was not yet a Nobel laureate. However, the question asks \"Which two Nobel laureates were featured,\" referring to their current or eventual status, not necessarily their status in 2000. Since he did go on to win the Nobel Prize, he fits the description of being a \"Nobel laureate\" who was \"featured\" in the ad.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals who were featured in the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial and are Nobel laureates are K. Carey Mullis and Paul Krugman. The infamy of the ad comes from its tagline urging people to question things, while Enron's own business practices were shrouded in deception that would lead to its bankruptcy just a year later.\n\nThe final answer is the identification of these two individuals.\n\n<<<K. Carey Mullis and Paul Krugman>>>"
