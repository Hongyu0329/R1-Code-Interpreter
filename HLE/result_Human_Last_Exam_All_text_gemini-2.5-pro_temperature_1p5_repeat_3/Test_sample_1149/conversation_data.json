    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject and Anatomical Feature:** The question concerns the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*, a member of the Spinosauridae family. The specific anatomical feature is the \"lacrimal recess,\" which is a depression on the lacrimal bone (a skull bone located in front of the eye socket). We need to find out how many smaller depressions are contained *within* this larger recess.\n\n2.  **Locate the Primary Scientific Source:** To answer such a specific anatomical question, we must refer to the primary paleontological literature describing the holotype skull of *Irritator challengeri* (specimen number SMNS 58022). The key scientific paper is:\n    *   Sues, H. D., Frey, E., Martill, D. M., & Scott, D. M. (2002). *Irritator challengeri*, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil. *Palaeontographica Abteilung A*, 264(4-6), 1-137.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** Within this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the dinosaur's skull anatomy. We need to find the section describing the lacrimal bone.\n\n4.  **Extract the Specific Information:** In their description of the lacrimal bone, Sues et al. (2002) state the following about its lateral (outer) surface:\n    *   The bone has a large, deep recess, which they identify as the lacrimal recess.\n    *   Critically, they specify the internal structure of this recess. The paper states (on page 12 of the description): \"This recess contains **two large depressions**, which are separated by a slender, vertical strut of bone.\"\n\n5.  **Interpret the Finding:** The two depressions within the lacrimal recess are identified as the proantorbital fenestra (the anterior one) and a large pneumatic fossa (the posterior one). The presence of these two distinct features, separated by a bony strut, means the single lacrimal recess contains two individual depressions.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of the Terminology:** It is crucial to distinguish between the \"lacrimal recess\" itself (which is one large feature) and the number of depressions *contained within* it. The question asks for the latter.\n*   **Reliance on Primary Sources:** This type of anatomical detail is not common knowledge and can only be reliably confirmed by consulting the original scientific description of the fossil specimen.\n*   **Verification:** The description in Sues et al. (2002) is the foundational text for the anatomy of *Irritator*. Later studies on spinosaurids have consistently referenced this paper for the anatomy of this genus, confirming the two-depression structure within the lacrimal recess.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the detailed anatomical description provided in the primary scientific literature, the lacrimal recess in the skull of *Irritator challengeri* is a large concavity that is subdivided internally into two smaller, distinct depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
