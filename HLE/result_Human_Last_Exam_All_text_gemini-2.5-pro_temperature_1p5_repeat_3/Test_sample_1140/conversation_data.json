    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify Key Information\n*   **Molecule to be synthesized:** A peptide.\n*   **Size:** 100 amino acids (aa). This is a crucial detail. While it's called a \"small\" peptide in the question, in the context of chemical synthesis, 100 aa is considered quite large.\n*   **Special Component:** It contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), specifically designated as \"X\".\n*   **Identity of UAA:** X is azido phenylalanine (p-azido-L-phenylalanine or AzF).\n*   **Goal:** Identify the \"most helpful technique\" for this specific synthesis.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Constraints\n1.  **Length (100 aa):** This length poses a significant challenge for purely chemical synthesis methods.\n2.  **Unnatural Amino Acid Incorporation:** The chosen method must be able to site-specifically incorporate AzF.\n3.  **\"Most Helpful\":** This implies we should compare the feasibility, efficiency, and commonality of different available methods to find the optimal one.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Potential Synthesis Techniques\n\nLet's evaluate the primary methods for peptide synthesis in light of the constraints identified above.\n\n*   **Technique 1: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n    *   **How it works:** The peptide is built step-by-step on a solid resin support. In each cycle, a protected amino acid is coupled to the growing chain.\n    *   **Can it incorporate AzF?** Yes. A protected version (e.g., Fmoc-AzF-OH) is commercially available and can be used just like any other amino acid in the synthesis cycle.\n    *   **Is it suitable for 100 aa?** This is the major drawback. The overall yield of SPPS is the product of the yield of each individual coupling step. Even with an excellent coupling efficiency of 99% per step, the theoretical maximum yield for a 100-mer would be (0.99)^99 â‰ˆ 37%. In practice, efficiencies are lower, and side reactions accumulate. The final crude product would contain many truncated and modified sequences, making purification extremely difficult and the final yield very low. Therefore, SPPS is generally considered impractical for peptides over ~50-60 aa.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Not the most helpful or efficient method due to the length.\n\n*   **Technique 2: Standard Recombinant Protein Expression**\n    *   **How it works:** A gene encoding the peptide is inserted into an expression vector, which is then put into a host organism (like *E. coli*). The host's cellular machinery (ribosomes) synthesizes the protein.\n    *   **Can it incorporate AzF?** No. The standard genetic code only uses 20 canonical amino acids. There is no natural codon, tRNA, or synthetase for AzF.\n    *   **Is it suitable for 100 aa?** Yes, this method is excellent for producing proteins of this size and much larger.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Unsuitable because it cannot incorporate the required unnatural amino acid.\n\n*   **Technique 3: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n    *   **How it works:** This method chemically joins two smaller synthetic peptide fragments. One fragment is made with a C-terminal thioester, and the other with an N-terminal cysteine. They react to form a native peptide bond.\n    *   **How would it be used here?** One could synthesize two ~50 aa fragments using SPPS (a much more manageable length). The AzF would be incorporated into one of the fragments during its SPPS run. Then, the two fragments would be ligated.\n    *   **Can it incorporate AzF?** Yes, within one of the SPPS-generated fragments.\n    *   **Is it suitable for 100 aa?** Yes, this is a valid strategy to create proteins of this size.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a plausible and viable technique. However, it can be technically complex, requires a Cysteine at the ligation junction (though modern variations exist), and still relies on two separate, challenging SPPS syntheses.\n\n*   **Technique 4: Genetic Code Expansion (also known as Amber Suppression or Non-canonical Amino Acid Incorporation)**\n    *   **How it works:** This is an advanced recombinant expression technique. It hijacks a codon that normally signals for translation to stop (e.g., the UAG \"amber\" stop codon). An engineered enzyme (an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase) is introduced that specifically charges a unique tRNA with the unnatural amino acid (AzF). This tRNA has an anticodon that recognizes the hijacked stop codon.\n    *   **How would it be used here?** The gene for the 100 aa peptide is synthesized with a UAG codon at the position for 'X'. The expression host (*E. coli*) is also given the plasmids for the orthogonal synthetase/tRNA pair. When grown in media containing AzF, the ribosome will read the UAG codon and, instead of stopping, will insert AzF into the growing peptide chain.\n    *   **Can it incorporate AzF?** Yes, this is precisely what the technique is designed for. Systems for incorporating AzF are very well-established.\n    *   **Is it suitable for 100 aa?** Absolutely. It leverages the high efficiency and fidelity of the ribosome, making the synthesis of a 100 aa protein straightforward.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This technique is perfectly suited for the task. It elegantly combines the ability to make long peptides (like recombinant expression) with the ability to incorporate unnatural amino acids (like chemical synthesis). It is the most common, powerful, and helpful method for this specific problem.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nComparing the options, **Genetic Code Expansion** is the superior method. It directly addresses both major challenges: the large size of the peptide (100 aa) and the need for site-specific incorporation of an unnatural amino acid (AzF). While NCL is possible, it is generally more laborious than using an established genetic code expansion system for this purpose.\n\n<<<Genetic code expansion (via amber suppression mutagenesis)>>>"
