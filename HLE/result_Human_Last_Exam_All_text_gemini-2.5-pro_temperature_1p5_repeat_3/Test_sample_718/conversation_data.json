    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the terms in the question\n\n1.  **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**: An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements have a least upper bound (a join). We can view a poset as a small category where objects are the elements of the poset and there is a unique morphism from $x$ to $y$ if and only if $x \\le y$. The property of being an upper semilattice implies that this category has finite coproducts.\n\n2.  **Filtered Category**: A crucial property of an upper semilattice $J$, when viewed as a category, is that it is a **filtered category**. A category $C$ is filtered if:\n    a) For any two objects $x, y \\in C$, there exists an object $z$ and morphisms $x \\to z$ and $y \\to z$. For an upper semilattice, we can take $z = x \\vee y$.\n    b) For any two parallel morphisms $f, g: x \\to y$, there exists a morphism $h: y \\to z$ such that $h \\circ f = h \\circ g$. In a poset, there is at most one morphism between any two objects, so this condition is trivially satisfied.\n    Therefore, any upper semilattice is a filtered category.\n\n3.  **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$**: This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(x)$ to each element $x \\in J$ and a linear map for each relation $x \\le y$ in a way that respects composition. The category of such functors is equivalent to the category of right modules over the incidence algebra $KJ$.\n\n4.  **Tame Functor**: The term \"tame\" in representation theory usually describes a representation type of an algebra or a category, not a single object or functor. An algebra is of tame representation type if its indecomposable modules can be classified into a finite number of one-parameter families for each dimension. The term \"tame functor\" is not standard. There are two likely interpretations:\n    a) The category of functors itself, $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, is of tame representation type. This is equivalent to saying the incidence algebra $KJ$ is tame.\n    b) \"Tame\" is a property of the specific functor $f$. This is less common but could mean, for instance, an indecomposable regular representation.\n    The question says \"Let $J$ be an upper semilattice\", not \"Let $J$ be a tame upper semilattice\". This strongly suggests that \"tame\" is a property of the functor $f$, and $J$ itself can be any upper semilattice (including those of wild representation type). However, even under this interpretation, standard definitions of regular modules lead to periodic resolutions, not resolutions of a fixed finite length. Given the ambiguity, we'll see if we can find a solution that is independent of the precise meaning of \"tame\".\n\n5.  **n-resolvable**: This term usually refers to homological properties. For an object $M$, being $n$-resolvable can mean:\n    a) There exists a projective resolution of length $n-1$: $0 \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$. This means the projective dimension, pd($M$), is at most $n-1$.\n    b) There exists an injective resolution of length $n-1$: $0 \\to M \\to I_0 \\to \\dots \\to I_{n-1} \\to 0$. This means the injective dimension, id($M$), is at most $n-1$.\n    c) It could refer to a property of category homology/cohomology involving the functor.\n\n### Step 2: Exploring Homological Dimensions\n\nLet's assume \"n-resolvable\" refers to projective or injective dimension. The global dimension of the functor category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ (when $J$ is a finite poset) is equal to the length of the longest chain of elements in $J$.\n\nThe problem states $J$ is an upper semilattice. The property \"tame\" might apply to $J$. However, a simple chain of length $L$ (e.g., $1 < 2 < \\dots < L+1$) is a lattice, hence an upper semilattice. It is of finite representation type, and thus also of tame type. Its global dimension is $L$. Since $L$ can be arbitrarily large, there is no universal integer $n$ that would bound the projective/injective dimension of all functors for all tame upper semilattices.\n\nThis suggests that the interpretation of \"n-resolvable\" in terms of projective/injective dimension is likely incorrect, or there is a misunderstanding of the premises.\n\n### Step 3: A More Promising Approach using Category Homology\n\nThe most robust property we've identified is that an upper semilattice $J$ is a filtered category. This has profound homological consequences.\n\nA key result in category theory (due to Quillen and others) states that for a filtered category $C$, the left derived functors of the colimit functor, $L_i(\\text{colim})$, vanish for $i \\ge 2$.\nThe derived functors $L_i(\\text{colim})$ are computed by the category homology groups. Specifically, for a functor $F: C \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, we have $L_i(\\text{colim})(F) \\cong H_i(C, F)$.\n\nSo, for any upper semilattice $J$ and any functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, we have:\n$H_n(J, f) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 2$.\n\nNow, let's connect this to the term \"n-resolvable\". If we define a functor $f$ to be \"n-resolvable\" when $H_k(J, f) = 0$ for all $k \\ge n$, this gives a precise meaning that leverages the property of $J$. This interpretation is not standard for the term \"resolvable\" applied to an object, but it fits the context of category theory perfectly.\n\nUnder this interpretation:\n- Any functor $f$ on an upper semilattice $J$ has its homology vanish in degrees 2 and higher.\n- This means any such functor is **2-resolvable**.\n\nThis conclusion holds for *any* functor on *any* upper semilattice. The property that the functor is \"tame\" becomes a specific condition on the functor, but the 2-resolvability holds universally for the entire category $J$. It is common in mathematical problems to provide more information than strictly necessary to solve the problem. The \"tame\" property might be such information here, perhaps to ensure we are in a context where such homological questions are natural.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  An upper semilattice $J$ is a filtered category.\n2.  For any functor $f$ from a filtered category $J$ to an abelian category like $\\text{Vect}_K$, the homology groups $H_n(J, f)$ are zero for all $n \\geq 2$.\n3.  Interpreting \"$n$-resolvable\" as the integer $n$ for which $H_k(J,f)=0$ for all $k \\ge n$, we find that any functor on an upper semilattice is 2-resolvable.\n4.  This property holds regardless of whether the functor is \"tame\" or not. Therefore, a tame functor is also 2-resolvable.\n\nThis provides a consistent answer that uses all the mathematical properties mentioned in the question in a meaningful way, avoiding the contradictions found in other interpretations.\n\nThe final answer is $n=2$."
