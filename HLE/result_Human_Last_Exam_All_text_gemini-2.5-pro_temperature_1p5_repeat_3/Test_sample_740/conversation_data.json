    "An ordered step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the integral equation in a standard form and analyze the kernel.**\nThe given integral equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.`\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, `u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ₐᵇ K(x, y) u(y) dy`, with `f(x) = 1`, `a=0`, `b=1`, and the kernel `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\nThe kernel can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n`xⁿ - yⁿ = (x - y)(xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹)`.\nSo, the kernel is:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`.\nThis kernel is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, as it's a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and `y`.\nAlso, `K(x, y) = K(y, x)`, so the kernel is symmetric. This implies that the integral operator is self-adjoint, and its eigenvalues are all real.\n\n**Step 2: Convert the integral equation into a system of linear algebraic equations.**\nSubstitute the separable kernel into the integral equation:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ [∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k] u(y) dy`\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\n\nLet `c_k` be the unknown constants defined by the moments of `u(y)`:\n`c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nThe solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)`.\n\nTo find the constants `c_k`, substitute this expression for `u(y)` back into their definition:\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j [1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)] dy` for `j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^j y^(n-1-k) dy`\n`c_j = [y^(j+1)/(j+1)]₀¹ + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k [y^(j+n-k)/(j+n-k)]₀¹`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j+n-k)`\n\nThis is a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknowns `c_0, ..., c_(n-1)`. We can write it in matrix form as:\n`C = B + λ A C`\n`(I - λA) C = B`\nwhere:\n`C` is the column vector `[c_0, ..., c_(n-1)]ᵀ`.\n`B` is the column vector `[1/1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`.\n`A` is the `n x n` matrix with elements `A_jk = 1 / (j+n-k)` (row index `j`, column index `k`, both from 0 to `n-1`).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conditions for the existence of a solution.**\nAccording to the theory of linear equations, the system `(I - λA) C = B` has:\n1.  A unique solution for `C` if `det(I - λA) ≠ 0`. This means `λ` is not a characteristic value of the integral equation. In this case, the integral equation has a unique solution.\n2.  No solution or infinitely many solutions if `det(I - λA) = 0`. This occurs when `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. The values of `λ` satisfying this are the characteristic values of the equation.\n\nWe are looking for values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution. This can only happen for characteristic values of `λ`.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Fredholm Alternative Theorem.**\nFor a characteristic value `λ_i`, the non-homogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the forcing term `f(x)` is orthogonal to all the eigenfunctions of the corresponding adjoint homogeneous equation.\nThe homogeneous adjoint equation is `v(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(y, x) v(y) dy`.\nSince our kernel `K(x,y)` is symmetric (`K(x,y) = K(y,x)`), the adjoint equation is the same as the homogeneous equation: `u_h(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u_h(y) dy`.\nThe solvability condition is:\n`∫₀¹ f(x) u_h(x) dx = 0` for every eigenfunction `u_h(x)` corresponding to `λ`.\nIn our case, `f(x) = 1`. So, the condition is `∫₀¹ u_h(x) dx = 0`.\n\nIf for a characteristic value `λ`, there exists at least one corresponding eigenfunction `u_h(x)` such that `∫₀¹ u_h(x) dx ≠ 0`, then the equation has no solution for this `λ`.\n\n**Step 5: Check the solvability condition.**\nLet `λ` be a characteristic value and `u_h(x)` a corresponding non-zero eigenfunction.\n`u_h(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u_h(y) dy`.\nIntegrate both sides with respect to `x` from 0 to 1:\n`∫₀¹ u_h(x) dx = λ ∫₀¹ [∫₀¹ K(x, y) u_h(y) dy] dx`\nSwap the order of integration:\n`∫₀¹ u_h(x) dx = λ ∫₀¹ u_h(y) [∫₀¹ K(x, y) dx] dy`\nSince `K(x,y)` is symmetric, `∫₀¹ K(x, y) dx = ∫₀¹ K(y, x) dx`. Let's define `q(y) = ∫₀¹ K(y, x) dx`.\nThe integral becomes: `∫₀¹ u_h(x) dx = λ ∫₀¹ u_h(y) q(y) dy`.\nThe integral on the right is the inner product `<u_h, q>`.\nSo, `∫₀¹ u_h(x) dx = λ <u_h, q>`.\n\nNow, let's identify `q(y)`.\n`q(y) = ∫₀¹ K(y,x) dx`. The operator `L` is defined by `(Lu)(y) = ∫₀¹ K(y,x)u(x)dx`. So `q(y) = (L(1))(y)`.\nThe integral equation for the eigenfunction is `u_h = λ L u_h`.\nWe have `<u_h, q> = <u_h, L(1)>`.\nSince `L` is self-adjoint, `<u_h, L(1)> = <L u_h, 1>`.\nUsing `L u_h = (1/λ) u_h`, we get `<(1/λ) u_h, 1> = (1/λ) <u_h, 1> = (1/λ) ∫₀¹ u_h(x) dx`.\nSubstituting this back into our derived equality:\n`∫₀¹ u_h(x) dx = λ [ (1/λ) ∫₀¹ u_h(x) dx ] = ∫₀¹ u_h(x) dx`.\nThis result `∫u_h = ∫u_h` is an identity and does not help determine if `∫u_h` is zero.\n\nLet's go back to the matrix formulation. The condition for no solution is that `λ` is a characteristic value and `B` is not in the column space of `(I-λA)`. This is equivalent to `B` not being orthogonal to the null space of `(I-λA)ᵀ`. Let `v` be a vector in this null space.\n`(I-λAᵀ)v = 0`. The condition for no solution is `vᵀB ≠ 0`.\n`A_jk = 1/(j+n-k)`. `(Aᵀ)_{jk} = A_{kj} = 1/(k+n-j)`.\n`B = [1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`.\n`vᵀB = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) v_k / (k+1)`.\n\nIt can be shown that for any eigenvector `v` of `Aᵀ`, the sum `vᵀB` is never zero. This is a non-trivial property of the specific Cauchy-type matrix `Aᵀ`. The proof for general `n` is advanced, but we can demonstrate it for small `n`.\nFor `n=1`: `A=[1]`, `λ=1`. `Aᵀ=[1]`. An eigenvector is `v=[c]` for `c≠0`. `B=[1]`. `vᵀB = c ≠ 0`. So no solution.\nFor `n=2`: `A_jk=1/(j+2-k)`. `A=[[1/2, 1],[1/3, 1/2]]`. `Aᵀ=[[1/2, 1/3],[1, 1/2]]`.\nCharacteristic equation for `A` is `det(I-λA)=0`, which we found to be `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`, giving `λ = -6 ± 4√3`.\nThe eigenvectors `v` of `Aᵀ` satisfy `Aᵀv = (1/λ)v`. `(Aᵀ - (1/λ)I)v=0`.\n`((1/2 - 1/λ))v_0 + (1/3)v_1 = 0`. If we assume `vᵀB = v_0/1 + v_1/2 = 0`, then `v_0 = -v_1/2`. Substituting this into the eigenvector equation gives `((1/2 - 1/λ))(-v_1/2) + (1/3)v_1 = 0`. This simplifies to `(-1/4 + 1/(2λ) + 1/3)v_1 = (1/12 + 1/(2λ))v_1 = 0`. Since `λ` is non-zero, this implies `1/12 = -1/(2λ)` so `λ = -6`. But `λ=-6` is not a characteristic value (`(-6)²+12(-6)-12 = -48 ≠ 0`). Thus, the assumption `vᵀB=0` must be false.\n\nSo, for any characteristic value `λ`, the condition for solvability is not met. Therefore, the equation has no solution if and only if `λ` is a characteristic value. The characteristic values are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the roots of the polynomial equation `det(I - λA) = 0`, where `A` is the `n x n` matrix with entries `A_jk = 1 / (j+n-k)` for `j,k = 0, ..., n-1`. These values are known as the characteristic values of the integral equation.\n\nFor `n=1`, `A=[1]`, `det(I-λA) = 1-λ = 0`, so `λ=1`.\nFor `n=2`, `A=[[1/2, 1],[1/3, 1/2]]`, `det(I-λA) = (1-λ/2)² - λ²/3 = 1-λ-λ²/12 = 0`, so `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`, which gives `λ = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\nThe problem asks for \"the values\", which depend on `n`. The full specification is the set of roots of `det(I - λA) = 0`."
