    "This is an initial value problem. We are given a differential equation and an initial condition, and we need to find the value of the solution at a specific point.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis equation is a **separable differential equation** because it can be written in the form $\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(t)g(x)$, where $f(t) = t-1$ and $g(x) = x^2$.\n\n**2. Separate the variables.**\nTo solve a separable equation, we move all terms involving $x$ and $dx$ to one side, and all terms involving $t$ and $dt$ to the other side.\n$$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt $$\n*   **Careful Point 1:** This step involves dividing by $x^2$. This is permissible as long as $x(t)$ is not the constant function $x(t) = 0$. The initial condition is $x(0) = -8$, which is non-zero. Since the solution to a differential equation of this form is unique, our solution will not be the zero function. Thus, the division is valid.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides.**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's compute each integral:\n*   The left-hand side: $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n*   The right-hand side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$\n\nCombining these results and adding a constant of integration, $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\nThis is the general implicit solution to the differential equation.\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C.**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our general solution to find the specific value of $C$.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**5. Write down the particular solution.**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1).**\nThe problem asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can find this by substituting $t=1$ into our particular solution equation.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo simplify the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nNow, we can solve for $x(1)$. First, multiply both sides by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides to find $x(1)$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** We should be mindful of the interval of existence of the solution. The explicit solution is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{8}{-4t^2+8t-1}$. The solution is defined as long as the denominator is not zero. The roots of $-4t^2+8t-1=0$ are $t = 1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Our interval of existence containing the initial point $t=0$ is $(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$, which is approximately $(0.134, 1.866)$. Since $t=1$ is within this interval, our calculation is valid.\n\nThe final answer is $\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
