    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\n\nThe user wants to find the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix. The question is phrased as: \"Compute the determinant of the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\), where:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\"\nWe need to carefully analyze all the components of this question.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Identify the core task.**\nThe question explicitly provides the matrix \\(A\\) and asks for its determinant. The primary task is a mathematical computation: find \\(\\det(A)\\).\n\n**Careful Point 2: Analyze the terminology.**\n*   **\"Adjacency matrix\"**: In standard graph theory, an adjacency matrix has non-negative entries representing the number of edges between vertices. The given matrix \\(A\\) has negative entries, so it is not an adjacency matrix in the standard sense. In the context of quivers and cluster algebras, the matrix \\(C = 2I - (B+B^T)\\), where B is the standard adjacency matrix of the quiver, is often studied and is called a Cartan matrix. For the Markov quiver (a cycle of 3 vertices), this Cartan matrix is precisely the matrix \\(A\\) given. It is likely that the question uses the term \"adjacency matrix\" loosely to refer to this associated matrix \\(A\\).\n*   **\"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\"**: The Markov numbers are a sequence of integers (1, 2, 5, 13, 29, ...). The number 13 is a Markov number. However, the matrix \\(A\\) is a fundamental matrix associated with the general structure of the Markov quiver, and it does not depend on a specific Markov number. Therefore, the phrase \"for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" appears to be extraneous information provided for context, possibly to make the problem seem more complex than it is. It does not alter the matrix \\(A\\) whose determinant we need to compute.\n\nBased on this analysis, the problem simplifies to: **Compute the determinant of the matrix \\(A\\).**\n\n**Step 2: Choose a method for computing the determinant**\n\nFor a 3x3 matrix, we can use several methods. The most common are:\n1.  Sarrus' Rule.\n2.  Cofactor Expansion.\n3.  Row reduction to an upper triangular form.\n4.  Finding the eigenvalues.\n\nWe will use the Cofactor Expansion method for a clear, step-by-step demonstration.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the determinant using Cofactor Expansion**\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\(A\\) by expanding along the first row is:\n\\(\\det(A) = a_{11}C_{11} + a_{12}C_{12} + a_{13}C_{13}\\), where \\(C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j}M_{ij}\\) is the cofactor of the element \\(a_{ij}\\), and \\(M_{ij}\\) is the minor.\n\nThe matrix is:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe elements of the first row are \\(a_{11} = 2\\), \\(a_{12} = -1\\), \\(a_{13} = -1\\).\n\n*   **Calculate the cofactor \\(C_{11}\\):**\n    The minor \\(M_{11}\\) is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing the first row and first column:\n    \\(M_{11} = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3\\).\n    The cofactor is \\(C_{11} = (-1)^{1+1}M_{11} = (1)(3) = 3\\).\n\n*   **Calculate the cofactor \\(C_{12}\\):**\n    The minor \\(M_{12}\\) is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing the first row and second column:\n    \\(M_{12} = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3\\).\n    The cofactor is \\(C_{12} = (-1)^{1+2}M_{12} = (-1)(-3) = 3\\).\n\n*   **Calculate the cofactor \\(C_{13}\\):**\n    The minor \\(M_{13}\\) is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing the first row and third column:\n    \\(M_{13} = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3\\).\n    The cofactor is \\(C_{13} = (-1)^{1+3}M_{13} = (1)(3) = 3\\).\n\n*   **Combine the results:**\n    \\(\\det(A) = a_{11}C_{11} + a_{12}C_{12} + a_{13}C_{13}\\)\n    \\(\\det(A) = (2)(3) + (-1)(3) + (-1)(3)\\)\n    \\(\\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\\)\n    \\(\\det(A) = 0\\)\n\n**Step 4: Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\n\nWe can verify this result using another method, for example, by observing the properties of the matrix. Notice that the sum of the elements in each row is 0:\n*   Row 1: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   Row 2: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   Row 3: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n\nA square matrix where the sum of the entries in each row is zero is a singular matrix. This means its determinant is 0. This is because the vector \\(\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is a non-trivial solution to the equation \\(A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}\\), which implies that 0 is an eigenvalue of \\(A\\). Since the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, the determinant must be 0.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe determinant of the given matrix \\(A\\) is 0. The additional context provided in the question does not change this result.\n\n<<<0>>>"
