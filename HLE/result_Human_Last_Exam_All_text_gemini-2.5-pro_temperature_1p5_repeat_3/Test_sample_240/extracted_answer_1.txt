The most likely reason is that the MRI coil is equipped with an active detuning safety circuit. This circuit, often using PIN diodes, intentionally shifts or destroys the coil's resonance when it is not in its active "receive" mode. When the coil is disconnected from the scanner on a bench, this circuit is typically in its default "safe" (detuned) state. Therefore, you are probing a non-resonant circuit. To see the resonance, one would often need to apply a specific DC bias voltage to the coil's control circuit to switch it into its resonant "receive" state. Other possibilities include poor magnetic coupling due to probe placement at a field null, or the coil requiring its specific powered preamplifier to form a complete and functional resonant circuit.
