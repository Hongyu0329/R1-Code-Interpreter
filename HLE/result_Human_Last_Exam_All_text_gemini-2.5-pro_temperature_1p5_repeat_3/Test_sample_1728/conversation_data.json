    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of the graph \\( G \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Graph G**\n\n*   The problem defines the graph \\( G \\) as \"the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\".\n*   **Cycles of length n:** Let's denote a cycle of length \\( n \\) as \\( C_n \\). The graph \\( G \\) is constructed from three such cycles, let's call them \\( C_A, C_B, C_C \\). Each of these cycles has \\( n \\) vertices and \\( n \\) edges. We assume the vertex sets of these three cycles are disjoint. So, \\( V(C_A) \\), \\( V(C_B) \\), and \\( V(C_C) \\) each have size \\( n \\).\n*   **Sum of Graphs:** The \"sum\" of graphs, denoted by '+', typically refers to the **graph join** operation. The join of two graphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), written as \\( G_1 + G_2 \\), is a graph formed by taking the disjoint union of their vertices and edges, and then adding an edge between every vertex of \\( G_1 \\) and every vertex of \\( G_2 \\).\n*   **Structure of G:** The graph \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\) is formed by taking three disjoint cycles \\( C_A, C_B, C_C \\) and adding all possible edges between the vertices of \\( C_A \\) and \\( C_B \\), between \\( C_B \\) and \\( C_C \\), and between \\( C_A \\) and \\( C_C \\). In essence, if you pick any three vertices, one from each cycle, they form a triangle (a \\(K_3\\) subgraph).\n\n**2. Finding the Chromatic Number of a Graph Join**\n\n*   The chromatic number of a graph, \\( \\chi(G) \\), is the minimum number of colors needed to color its vertices so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n*   A key property of the graph join operation relates to the chromatic number. For any two graphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), the chromatic number of their join is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers:\n    \\[ \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\]\n*   **Reasoning:** In the graph \\( G_1 + G_2 \\), every vertex of \\( G_1 \\) is connected to every vertex of \\( G_2 \\). This means that the set of colors used to color the vertices of \\( G_1 \\) must be completely disjoint from the set of colors used for \\( G_2 \\). To minimize the total number of colors, we use the minimum required for each part, which is \\( \\chi(G_1) \\) and \\( \\chi(G_2) \\) respectively. Therefore, the total number of colors is \\( \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\).\n*   This property extends to the join of multiple graphs:\n    \\[ \\chi(G_1 + G_2 + \\dots + G_k) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) + \\dots + \\chi(G_k) \\]\n\n**3. Applying the Formula to G**\n\n*   Our graph is \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\). Using the formula above, its chromatic number is:\n    \\[ \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\]\n*   So, the problem now reduces to finding the chromatic number of a single cycle, \\( \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n**4. Finding the Chromatic Number of a Cycle \\( C_n \\)**\n\n*   The chromatic number of a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) depends on whether its length \\( n \\) is even or odd. For a cycle to be well-defined in a simple graph, we must have \\( n \\ge 3 \\).\n*   **Case 1: n is even** (e.g., \\( n=4, 6, 8, \\dots \\)).\n    An even cycle is a bipartite graph. We can color its vertices by alternating between two colors (e.g., color 1, color 2, color 1, color 2, ...). Therefore, for even \\( n \\ge 4 \\), \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n*   **Case 2: n is odd** (e.g., \\( n=3, 5, 7, \\dots \\)).\n    An odd cycle is not bipartite. If you try to color it with two colors, you will find that the first and last vertices are adjacent but would be assigned the same color. Thus, a third color is necessary. For odd \\( n \\ge 3 \\), \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n**5. Determining the Maximal Chromatic Number**\n\n*   The question asks for the **maximal** chromatic number of \\( G \\). This means we should choose the value of \\( n \\) that maximizes \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\).\n*   Let's analyze the value of \\( \\chi(G) \\) based on the parity of \\( n \\):\n    *   If \\( n \\) is even, \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is odd, \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\).\n*   Comparing the two possible outcomes, the maximum value is 9. This maximum is achieved whenever \\( n \\) is an odd integer (\\( n \\ge 3 \\)). For example, if \\( n=3 \\), \\( G = C_3 + C_3 + C_3 = K_3 + K_3 + K_3 \\), and \\( \\chi(G) = 3+3+3 = 9 \\).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Sum\":** The most critical point is correctly interpreting \"sum of graphs\" as the graph join operation. Other graph products exist (like Cartesian or tensor products) which would yield a completely different graph and chromatic number.\n2.  **Role of \"n\":** The parameter \\( n \\) is the length of the cycles. The term \"maximal\" implies that \\( \\chi(G) \\) depends on \\( n \\), and we are looking for its maximum possible value across all valid \\( n \\) (i.e., \\( n \\ge 3 \\)).\n3.  **Property of Chromatic Number of Join:** The formula \\( \\chi(\\sum G_i) = \\sum \\chi(G_i) \\) is the linchpin of the solution.\n4.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle:** Correctly recalling or deriving that \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 2 for even \\( n \\) and 3 for odd \\( n \\) is essential. A mistake here would lead to an incorrect final answer.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the analysis, the chromatic number of \\( G \\) can be 6 or 9. The maximal value is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
