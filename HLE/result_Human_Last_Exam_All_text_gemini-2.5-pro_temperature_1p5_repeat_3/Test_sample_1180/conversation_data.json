    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Write down the curve equation and the valuation.**\n    The curve is given by $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\n    We are working over a 2-adic field, say $K \\supseteq \\mathbb{Q}_2$, with a valuation $v$ normalized such that $v(2)=1$.\n\n2.  **Find a better model for the curve.**\n    The given model is integral over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let's reduce it modulo 2. The equation for the special fiber is $z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, which is $(z-1)^2 \\equiv 0$ in characteristic 2. This shows the special fiber is a non-reduced, double line. This is a model with bad reduction. To find the stable reduction, we need to transform the model.\n\n3.  **Perform a change of variables to reveal the structure.**\n    A standard technique is to complete the square, but that introduces division by 2 in coefficients, which is not ideal. Instead, we can try to make the equation simpler after a base extension.\n    Let's rewrite the equation as $z^2 - 1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3$.\n    This suggests a substitution to simplify the left side. We need to work in a ramified extension. Let $K' = K(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\sqrt{2})$. Let $\\pi = \\sqrt{2}$ be the uniformizer of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K'} = \\mathbb{Z}_2[\\sqrt{2}]$. The valuation on $K'$, also denoted $v$, is normalized so that $v(\\pi) = v(\\sqrt{2}) = 1/2$.\n    Let $z = 1 + \\pi u$. Substitute this into the equation:\n    $(1+\\pi u)^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n    $1 + 2\\pi u + \\pi^2 u^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n    Since $\\pi^2=2$, this becomes:\n    $1 + 2\\pi u + 2u^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$\n    $2\\pi u + 2u^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\n    Dividing by 2 (which is $\\pi^2$):\n    $\\pi u + u^2 = x^5 + x^3$\n    This gives us a new model of the curve, defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2[\\sqrt{2}]$: $u^2 + \\pi u - (x^5+x^3) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the special fiber of the new model.**\n    The special fiber is obtained by reducing the equation modulo $\\pi$.\n    $u^2 \\equiv x^5+x^3 \\pmod \\pi$\n    $u^2 = x^3(x^2+1) = x^3(x+1)^2$ (in characteristic 2).\n    This special fiber $C_s$ is an irreducible rational curve. Let's find its singularities. A point $(x_0, u_0)$ is singular if the partial derivatives of $F(x,u) = u^2 - x^3(x+1)^2$ vanish.\n    $\\partial F/\\partial u = 2u \\equiv 0$.\n    $\\partial F/\\partial x = -3x^2(x+1)^2 - x^3(2(x+1)) \\equiv x^2(x+1)^2 \\pmod 2$.\n    The singularities are at $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n    -   At $x=1$: $u^2 = 1^3(1+1)^2=0 \\implies u=0$. Point is $(1,0)$. Let $s=x-1$. The local equation is $u^2 \\approx s^2(1+s) \\approx s^2$. This is an ordinary double point (a node).\n    -   At $x=0$: $u^2 = 0 \\implies u=0$. Point is $(0,0)$. The local equation is $u^2 \\approx x^3(1)^2=x^3$. This is a cusp.\n\n5.  **Find the stable model by resolving the non-nodal singularity.**\n    A stable curve can only have nodes as singularities. The cusp at $(x,u)=(0,0)$ must be resolved. We do this by a sequence of blow-ups of the model defined by $u^2 + \\pi u - (x^5+x^3) = 0$ at the point $(x,u)=(0,0)$ of its special fiber.\n    The local equation at $(0,0)$ is approximately $u^2+\\pi u-x^3=0$.\n    -   **First Blow-up:** Blow up the origin in the $(x,u)$ plane. We analyze the chart $x_1=x, u_1=u/x$.\n        Substitute $u=x_1u_1$ into the equation:\n        $(x_1u_1)^2 + \\pi(x_1u_1) - x_1^3(x_1^2+1) = 0$\n        $x_1^2 u_1^2 + \\pi x_1 u_1 - x_1^5 - x_1^3 = 0$\n        The total transform contains the exceptional divisor $x_1=0$. The strict transform is given by:\n        $x_1 u_1^2 + \\pi u_1 - x_1^4 - x_1^2 = 0$.\n        The special fiber (mod $\\pi$) is $x_1 u_1^2 - x_1^2(x_1^2+1) = 0 \\implies x_1(u_1^2-x_1(x_1+1)^2)=0$. This has a singularity at $(x_1,u_1)=(0,0)$ which is a tacnode. It needs further resolution.\n    -   **Second Blow-up:** Blow up the origin in the $(x_1, u_1)$ plane. The local equation is $x_1 u_1^2 + \\pi u_1 - x_1^2 \\approx 0$.\n        We check the chart $u_2=u_1, x_2=x_1/u_1$. Substitute $x_1=x_2u_2$:\n        $(x_2u_2)u_2^2 + \\pi u_2 - (x_2u_2)^2 = 0$\n        $x_2 u_2^3 + \\pi u_2 - x_2^2 u_2^2 = 0$\n        The strict transform is:\n        $x_2 u_2^2 + \\pi - x_2^2 u_2 = 0$\n        This can be rewritten as $\\pi = x_2^2 u_2 - x_2 u_2^2 = u_2 x_2(x_2 - u_2)$.\n\n6.  **Interpret the result to find the thickness.**\n    The equation $\\pi = u_2 x_2(x_2-u_2)$ describes the neighborhood of the singularity in the stable model. A double point (node) in a stable reduction locally corresponds to an equation of the form $XY = t$, where $t$ is an element of the base ring. The \"thickness\" of the node is defined as $v(t)$.\n    In our case, the singularity has resolved into a configuration whose structure is determined by the parameter $\\pi = \\sqrt{2}$. The special fiber (reducing $\\pi=...$ mod $\\pi$) is $u_2 x_2(x_2-u_2)=0$, which consists of three lines meeting at a point. This resolves to a configuration with three nodes. The parameter governing the splitting of these nodes is $\\pi$.\n    The term \"the double point\" can be interpreted as the effective singularity resulting from this resolution process. The thickness of this resulting singularity structure is given by the valuation of the parameter $\\pi$.\n    The thickness is $v(\\pi) = v(\\sqrt{2})$. Since the valuation is normalized by $v(2)=1$, we have $v(\\sqrt{2}) = 1/2$.\n\n7.  **Final check on other singularities.**\n    The original node at $(x,u)=(1,0)$ on the special fiber has a local equation $u^2+\\pi u - s^2(s+1) \\approx 0$ (where $s=x-1$). The local equation is $u^2+\\pi u-s^2=0$. This is a quadratic form whose discriminant is $\\Delta = \\pi^2 - 4(1)(-s^2) = \\pi^2+4s^2$. The valuation of the coefficient giving the nodal structure is $v(\\pi^2)=v(2)=1$. So this node has a thickness of 1.\n    However, the question asks for the thickness of \"the\" double point, which suggests a single, most significant value characterizes the degeneration. The resolution of the more severe singularity (the cusp) should provide this value. The parameter that emerged from resolving the cusp was $\\pi$, with valuation $1/2$. The most intricate part of the degeneration geometry is governed by this value. Thus, $1/2$ is the most plausible answer."
