    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of the question.**\nThe question has four key parts:\n1.  **\"Academy Award for Best Picture\" winner:** We must only consider films that won this specific award.\n2.  **\"Luxor Obelisk\":** We need to identify what this is and where the obelisks are located.\n3.  **\"Depict on-screen\":** The obelisk must be visibly shown in the film, either on location or as a recreation on a set.\n4.  **\"First\":** We need to search chronologically through the list of Best Picture winners to find the earliest example.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Luxor Obelisks.**\nThere are two famous Luxor Obelisks, which were originally a pair at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Egypt, carved around 1250 BC.\n*   **One remains at the Luxor Temple** in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   **The other was gifted to France in 1833** and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde in Paris.**\nTherefore, a qualifying film could be set in either Luxor, Egypt, or Paris, France.\n\n**Step 3: Conduct a chronological search of Best Picture winners.**\nWe will go through the winners year by year, checking their setting and key scenes for a depiction of either obelisk.\n\n*   **1920s - 1930s:** Early winners like *Wings* (1928), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930), and *Grand Hotel* (1932) are set in WWI battlefields, Germany, or other locations without a Luxor Obelisk. A notable candidate from this era is **_The Life of Emile Zola_ (1937)**, which is set in Paris. However, the film focuses on interior scenes like courtrooms and offices, and does not feature establishing shots or prominent scenes at the Place de la Concorde.\n\n*   **1940s:** Winners from this decade like *Rebecca* (1940), *How Green Was My Valley* (1941), *Casablanca* (1942), and *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946) are set in England, Wales, Morocco, and the American Midwest, respectively. None of these locations contain a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n*   **1950s:** This decade presents several strong candidates set in Paris.\n    *   **_An American in Paris_ (1951):** This film is a musical celebration of Paris. Its famous climactic 17-minute ballet sequence features elaborate sets designed to evoke the works of French Impressionist painters and famous Parisian locations. One of these sequences is explicitly set in the Place de la Concorde, and the Luxor Obelisk is clearly depicted as the centerpiece. As the winner for 1951, this is a very strong candidate for being the \"first.\"\n    *   **_Around the World in 80 Days_ (1956):** This film features a journey through many global locations. Early in the film, there is a segment in Paris where the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk are shown. However, since this film won five years after *An American in Paris*, it cannot be the first.\n    *   **_Gigi_ (1958):** Another musical set in Paris. This film also includes on-location and set-based scenes of Paris, including shots that feature the Place de la Concorde and the obelisk. Again, this is later than 1951.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the search.**\nBased on the chronological review, no Best Picture winner prior to 1951 features a confirmed on-screen depiction of either the obelisk in Luxor or the one in Paris. *An American in Paris* (1951) contains a clear and memorable depiction of the Paris obelisk in its final ballet sequence. Later winners like *Around the World in 80 Days* and *Gigi* also show the obelisk, but *An American in Paris* is the earliest.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is **An American in Paris**.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
