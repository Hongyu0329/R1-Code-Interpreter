    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity for the given algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Basic Operations and Input Size:**\n    *   The inputs are integers `n` and `c`. The complexity of the algorithm primarily depends on the magnitude of `n`.\n    *   The basic operations are assignments (`:=`), comparisons (`>`), and arithmetic operations (addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, and integer division `⌊ / ⌋`). In a standard model of computation, where the numbers `n` and `c` fit within a machine's word size, each of these operations is considered to take constant time, denoted as `O(1)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Cost of Each Step in the Algorithm:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Initialization):**\n        *   `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n        *   This step consists of two assignments, one division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. All are `O(1)` operations. Thus, the total time for Step 1 is constant.\n\n    *   **Step 2 (The `while` loop):**\n        *   This is the core of the algorithm. The total time spent here will be the number of times the loop executes multiplied by the time taken for each iteration.\n        *   **Inside the loop (Step 2.1):**\n            *   `i := i + 1;`: One `O(1)` operation.\n            *   `x := q;`: One `O(1)` operation.\n            *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: One `O(1)` operation.\n            *   `a_{i} := x — qc`: One multiplication and one subtraction, which are `O(1)`.\n        *   The loop condition `q > 0` is also an `O(1)` check.\n        *   Therefore, the total work inside a single iteration of the `while` loop is constant, `O(1)`.\n\n    *   **Step 3 (Return):**\n        *   `return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1}  a_{0}))`\n        *   Returning the computed sequence of digits is typically an `O(1)` operation, as it just involves passing a reference to the result.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Loop Iterations:**\n    *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's trace how the value of `q` changes.\n    *   Before the loop starts, `q` is set to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   In each iteration, `x` takes the value of the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`.\n    *   Essentially, the value of `n` is being divided by `c` repeatedly. The loop continues until the quotient becomes 0.\n    *   The number of times you can divide `n` by a base `c` until the result is 0 is logarithmically related to `n`.\n    *   Let `k` be the number of digits in the base-`c` representation of `n`. We know that `c^(k-1) ≤ n < c^k`.\n    *   Taking the logarithm base `c` across the inequality, we get `k-1 ≤ log_c(n) < k`.\n    *   This implies that the number of digits `k` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`.\n    *   The algorithm computes `a_0` outside the loop and `a_1, a_2, ...` inside the loop. The loop runs for each digit from the second (`a_1`) to the last. The number of iterations is therefore `k-1`, which is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n    *   So, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Computational Time Complexity:**\n    *   Total Time = (Time for Step 1) + (Number of Iterations × Time per Iteration) + (Time for Step 3)\n    *   Total Time = `O(1)` + `O(log_c(n)) × O(1)` + `O(1)`\n    *   Total Time = `O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(1)`\n    *   Total Time = `O(log_c(n))`\n\n5.  **Simplify Using Big-O Notation Rules:**\n    *   In Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm can be changed without affecting the complexity class, because of the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c` is a constant, `log_b(c)` is also a constant. Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Assumption of Constant-Time Arithmetic:** The analysis assumes that division, multiplication, etc., take `O(1)` time. This is a standard assumption for numbers that fit in a computer word. If `n` were an arbitrarily large number (requiring a bignum library), the cost of these arithmetic operations would increase, leading to a higher overall complexity (e.g., `O((log n)^2)`).\n*   **Complexity is with respect to `n`'s value:** The complexity is logarithmic in the *value* of `n`. This is a very efficient algorithm. For instance, if `n` doubles, `log n` only increases by a constant, so the runtime increases by a small constant amount.\n*   **The base `c` is a constant:** The analysis treats `c` as a fixed parameter. While a larger base `c` would result in fewer iterations and a faster execution time, it only affects the constant factor in the complexity, not the overall logarithmic nature.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The loop executes approximately `log_c(n)` times, and each iteration performs a constant amount of work. Therefore, the total complexity is `O(log_c n)`, which is simplified to `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
