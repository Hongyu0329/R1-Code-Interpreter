    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve and its Properties:**\n    The curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n    *   x(t) = cos(9t)\n    *   y(t) = sin(5t)\n    This is a type of curve known as a Lissajous curve.\n\n2.  **Determine the Fundamental Period:**\n    To find the number of self-intersections, we first need to determine the interval of the parameter `t` over which the curve is traced exactly once.\n    *   The period of the x-component, `cos(9t)`, is `T_x = 2π / 9`.\n    *   The period of the y-component, `sin(5t)`, is `T_y = 2π / 5`.\n    The fundamental period `T` of the entire curve is the least common multiple (LCM) of `T_x` and `T_y`.\n    `T = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1 / GCF(9, 5)) = 2π * (1/1) = 2π`.\n    So, we need to find the self-intersections for `t` in the interval `[0, 2π)`.\n\n3.  **Define Self-Intersection:**\n    A self-intersection point is a point `(x, y)` on the curve that is reached at two different parameter values, `t1` and `t2`, within the fundamental period.\n    So, we need to find the number of distinct points `(x, y)` such that:\n    *   `cos(9*t1) = cos(9*t2)`\n    *   `sin(5*t1) = sin(5*t2)`\n    for `0 ≤ t1 < t2 < 2π`.\n\n4.  **Use the Standard Formula for Lissajous Curves:**\n    For a Lissajous curve given by `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`, where `a` and `b` are coprime integers, there is a well-known formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points.\n\n    **Careful Points to Check:**\n    *   **Are `a` and `b` integers?** Yes, `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n    *   **Are `a` and `b` coprime?** The greatest common factor of 9 and 5 is `GCF(9, 5) = 1`. Yes, they are coprime.\n    *   **Does the curve pass through the origin?** A self-intersection at the origin can sometimes require special consideration. The curve passes through the origin if there is a value of `t` for which `x(t) = 0` and `y(t) = 0` simultaneously.\n        *   `x(t) = cos(9t) = 0` implies `9t = (2k+1)π/2` for some integer `k`.\n        *   `y(t) = sin(5t) = 0` implies `5t = mπ` for some integer `m`.\n        Equating `t`, we would need `(2k+1)π/18 = mπ/5`, which simplifies to `5(2k+1) = 18m`. The left side (`10k+5`) is always odd, while the right side (`18m`) is always even. This equation has no integer solutions for `k` and `m`. Therefore, the curve never passes through the origin.\n\n    The standard formula for the number of self-intersections for this type of Lissajous curve is:\n    Number of self-intersections `N = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Substitute the values `a = 9` and `b = 5` into the formula:\n    `N = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2`\n    `N = (8) * (4) / 2`\n    `N = 32 / 2`\n    `N = 16`\n\nThe curve has 16 self-intersection points."
