    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of K.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Tensor and the Slice Rank**\n\nThe problem considers a tensor $T$ which is a function from $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$, defined as:\n$T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$\nwhere $x=(x_1,...,x_n)$, $y=(y_1,...,y_n)$, $z=(z_1,...,z_n)$ are vectors in $\\{0, 1\\}^n$.\n\nThis tensor lives in the space $V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n}$, where $V$ is the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. This is a $2^n \\times 2^n \\times 2^n$ tensor.\n\nThe **slice rank** of a 3-tensor is the minimum number of \"slices\" needed to write the tensor as a sum. A slice is a tensor of the form $A(x)B(y,z)$, $C(y)D(x,z)$, or $E(z)F(x,y)$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Tensor to a Simpler One**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the tensor $T$. It is composed of two parts: the product term and the constant term.\nLet $T'_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$.\nLet $J(x,y,z) = 1$ be the tensor that is constantly 1.\nThen $T = T'_n - J$.\n\nThe tensor $J$ can be written as $J(x,y,z) = f(x)g(y,z)$ where $f(x)=1$ for all $x$ and $g(y,z)=1$ for all $y,z$. Thus, $J$ is a slice and its slice rank is 1.\nThe slice rank satisfies the triangle inequality: $\\text{slicerank}(A+B) \\le \\text{slicerank}(A) + \\text{slicerank}(B)$.\nSo, we have:\n$\\text{slicerank}(T'_n) - \\text{slicerank}(J) \\le \\text{slicerank}(T) \\le \\text{slicerank}(T'_n) + \\text{slicerank}(J)$\n$\\text{slicerank}(T'_n) - 1 \\le \\text{slicerank}(T) \\le \\text{slicerank}(T'_n) + 1$.\n\nThe problem gives the asymptotic behavior of the slice rank: $\\text{slicerank}(T) = (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The base of this exponential growth is given by $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (\\text{slicerank}(T))^{1/n}$. Since $\\text{slicerank}(T'_n)$ grows exponentially with $n$, the additive term of $\\pm 1$ does not affect this limit. Thus, the asymptotic slice rank of $T$ is the same as that of $T'_n$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Asymptotic Slice Rank of $T'_n$**\n\nThe tensor $T'_n$ is the $n$-th tensor power of a base tensor $T_1$:\n$T'_n = T_1^{\\otimes n}$, where $T_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$ for $x_1,y_1,z_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n\nThe asymptotic slice rank of $T_1$ is defined as $Q_s(T_1) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (\\text{slicerank}(T_1^{\\otimes n}))^{1/n}$. This limit exists due to Fekete's lemma and the property $\\text{slicerank}(A\\otimes B) \\le \\text{slicerank}(A)\\text{slicerank}(B)$.\n\nOur goal is to compute $Q_s(T_1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Show that $T_1$ is Isomorphic to the W-tensor**\n\nLet's analyze the tensor $T_1$. In the standard basis $\\{\\delta_0, \\delta_1\\}$ for $V \\cong \\mathbb{C}^2$, the components of $T_1$ are $T_{ijk} = i+j+k$ for $i,j,k \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n\nConsider the action of $T_1$ as a trilinear form on the dual space $(V^*)^3$. Let $u=(u_0,u_1), v=(v_0,v_1), w=(w_0,w_1)$ be coordinate vectors in $V^*$.\n$T_1(u,v,w) = \\sum_{i,j,k} (i+j+k) u_i v_j w_k = (\\sum i u_i)(\\sum v_j)(\\sum w_k) + (\\sum u_i)(\\sum j v_j)(\\sum w_k) + (\\sum u_i)(\\sum v_j)(\\sum k w_k)$.\nLet $S_u = u_0+u_1$ and $u_1' = u_1$. Similarly for $v$ and $w$. Then the expression becomes:\n$T_1(u,v,w) = u_1' S_v S_w + S_u v_1' S_w + S_u S_v w_1'$.\n\nLet's perform a change of coordinates for the vectors in $V^*$: $u' = (u'_0, u'_1) = (u_0+u_1, u_1)$. This is an invertible linear transformation. In this new coordinate system, the trilinear form becomes:\n$T_1(u', v', w') = u'_1 v'_0 w'_0 + u'_0 v'_1 w'_0 + u'_0 v'_0 w'_1$.\nThis is the defining expression for the celebrated W-tensor, whose components are $W_{ijk}=1$ if exactly one index is 1, and 0 otherwise.\nSince $T_1$ can be transformed into the W-tensor by an invertible linear map on each of its three vector spaces (a $GL_2(\\mathbb{C})^{\\times 3}$ transformation), they are isomorphic. This means they share the same tensor properties, including slice rank and asymptotic slice rank. So, $Q_s(T_1) = Q_s(W)$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Asymptotic Slice Rank of the W-tensor**\n\nWe need to find $Q_s(W) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (\\text{slicerank}(W^{\\otimes n}))^{1/n}$. Let's first determine the slice rank of $W$.\nThe tensor $W$ is given by $W(x,y,z) = x_0 y_0 z_1 + x_0 y_1 z_0 + x_1 y_0 z_0$.\nA decomposition of $W$ into two slices is:\n$W = (x_0) \\cdot (y_0 z_1 + y_1 z_0) + (x_1) \\cdot (y_0 z_0)$.\nThe first term is a slice with $A(x)=x_0$ and $B(y,z)=y_0 z_1 + y_1 z_0$. The second term is a slice with $A(x)=x_1$ and $B(y,z)=y_0 z_0$. Thus, $\\text{slicerank}(W) \\le 2$.\n\nFor a lower bound, the slice rank of a tensor is at least the rank of any of its matrix \"flattenings\". The flattening of $W$ that maps $V_1$ to $V_2 \\otimes V_3$ is the matrix $M_W = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which has rank 2.\nSo, $\\text{slicerank}(W) \\ge 2$.\nCombining the bounds, we have $\\text{slicerank}(W) = 2$.\n\nNow we consider $W^{\\otimes n}$. The property $\\text{slicerank}(A \\otimes B) \\le \\text{slicerank}(A) \\text{slicerank}(B)$ gives:\n$\\text{slicerank}(W^{\\otimes n}) \\le (\\text{slicerank}(W))^n = 2^n$.\n\nFor the lower bound, the rank of a matrix flattening of a tensor product is the product of the ranks of the corresponding flattenings: $\\text{rank}(M_{A\\otimes B}) = \\text{rank}(M_A)\\text{rank}(M_B)$.\nSo, the rank of the corresponding flattening of $W^{\\otimes n}$ is $(\\text{rank}(M_W))^n = 2^n$.\nThis provides the lower bound: $\\text{slicerank}(W^{\\otimes n}) \\ge \\text{rank}(M_{W^{\\otimes n}}) = 2^n$.\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we find that $\\text{slicerank}(W^{\\otimes n}) = 2^n$ exactly.\nTherefore, the asymptotic slice rank is:\n$Q_s(W) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (2^n)^{1/n} = 2$.\n\n**Step 6: Solve for K**\n\nWe have established that the asymptotic slice rank of the tensor $T$ from the problem is $Q_s(T_1) = Q_s(W) = 2$.\nThe problem states that the slice rank is of the form $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$.\nThe base of this exponential growth is $3/2^K$.\nEquating this with our computed value:\n$3/2^K = 2$\n$3 = 2 \\cdot 2^K$\n$3 = 2^{K+1}$\nTaking $\\log_2$ of both sides:\n$\\log_2(3) = K+1$\n$K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\nUsing logarithm properties, this can be simplified:\n$K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3/2)$."
