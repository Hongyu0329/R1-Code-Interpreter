    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: This is the core structure, consisting of a benzene ring attached to an amide group, -C(=O)N-.\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide group. The full amide group is -C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂. This group defines the C1 position on the benzene ring.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, is attached to the C3 position of the benzene ring.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n        C(=O)N(Et)₂\n       /\n    (1)C\n   /  \\\\\n(6)C   C(2)\n  |     |\n(5)C   C(3)-N(Me)₂\n   \\  //\n    C(4)\n```\nThe available protons for reaction on the ring are at positions 2, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Conditions (First Step)**\n*   **sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium)**: This is a very strong organometallic base.\n*   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine)**: This is a chelating agent for the lithium cation (Li⁺). By coordinating to lithium, TMEDA breaks up the aggregates of sec-BuLi, making it a more potent base. It also plays a crucial role in directing the lithiation.\n*   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran)**: A common ether solvent that is inert under these reaction conditions.\n\nThe combination of a strong organolithium base with a directing group on an aromatic ring leads to a reaction called **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)**. In this reaction, the base selectively removes a proton from the position *ortho* (adjacent) to the directing group.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Site of Lithiation (Deprotonation)**\nThe starting material has two potential directing groups (DMGs), both of which can coordinate with the lithium ion and direct the base to an adjacent position:\n1.  **The N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂)** at C1: This is a very strong directing group. It directs lithiation to its ortho positions, C2 and C6.\n2.  **The dimethylamino group (-NMe₂)** at C3: This is also a good directing group. It directs lithiation to its ortho positions, C2 and C4.\n\nWe must evaluate where the lithiation will occur:\n*   **Position C2**: This position is ortho to *both* the amide group (the stronger DMG) and the dimethylamino group. The two groups act cooperatively (synergistically), making the proton at C2 the most acidic proton on the ring. Deprotonation at C2 allows for the formation of a stable six-membered chelate ring involving the lithium ion, the amide oxygen, and the amine nitrogen.\n*   **Position C4**: This position is ortho to the -NMe₂ group but meta to the stronger -CONEt₂ group.\n*   **Position C6**: This position is ortho to the -CONEt₂ group but meta to the -NMe₂ group.\n\nDue to the powerful cooperative effect of the two directing groups, the sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the C2 position. This forms an aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Intermediate:** 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n```\n        C(=O)N(Et)₂\n       /\n    (1)C\n   /  \\\\\n(6)C   C(2)-Li⁺\n  |     |\n(5)C   C(3)-N(Me)₂\n   \\  //\n    C(4)\n```\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Reaction Step**\n*   **Methyl iodide (CH₃I)**: This is an electrophilic reagent. The carbon atom in the methyl group is susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n\nThe aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile (a carbanion). It will attack the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide. The iodide ion (I⁻) acts as the leaving group. This is a standard electrophilic quench reaction.\n\n**Reaction:** Ar⁻Li⁺ + CH₃-I → Ar-CH₃ + LiI\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Product**\nThe methyl group (-CH₃) replaces the lithium atom at the C2 position of the aromatic ring. The final product is formed by adding a methyl group at the C2 position of the starting material.\n\n*   **Structure**: A benzamide with an N,N-diethylamide group at C1, a methyl group at C2, and a dimethylamino group at C3.\n*   **Name**: Following IUPAC nomenclature, we alphabetize the substituents on the ring (\"dimethylamino\" and \"methyl\"). \"d\" comes before \"m\".\n    Therefore, the name is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   [✓] The structure of the starting material is correctly identified.\n*   [✓] The reaction type (Directed Ortho-Metalation) is recognized.\n*   [✓] The directing groups (-CONEt₂ and -NMe₂) are identified.\n*   [✓] The cooperative effect of the two directing groups is correctly assessed, leading to selective lithiation at the C2 position.\n*   [✓] The role of the aryllithium intermediate as a nucleophile and methyl iodide as an electrophile is understood.\n*   [✓] The final structure is correctly deduced by substituting the lithium with a methyl group.\n*   [✓] The final product is named correctly according to IUPAC rules.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide>>>"
