    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question regarding the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Terms**\n\n*   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** This is the date and/or time after which a compounded preparation shall not be used, stored, or transported. The date is determined from the time the preparation is compounded. Its purpose is to ensure the sterility and stability of the drug after it has been manipulated, which is different from the manufacturer's expiration date on an unopened container.\n*   **Single-Dose Container (or Single-Dose Vial - SDV):** This is a container of a sterile medication intended for parenteral administration (e.g., injection, infusion) that is meant for use in a single patient for a single procedure. A key characteristic is that these containers typically do not contain an antimicrobial preservative.\n*   **Ampule:** An ampule is a specific type of single-dose container. It is a small, sealed glass vial that is opened by breaking the neck. Once opened, an ampule cannot be resealed.\n*   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to a controlled area designed to maintain sterility during compounding. According to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), this means an ISO Class 5 or cleaner Primary Engineering Control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench or a biological safety cabinet.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Governing Standard**\n\nThe primary authority on sterile compounding in the United States is the **USP General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations**. These guidelines are designed to prevent patient harm, including death, from microbial contamination, excessive bacterial endotoxins, and other impurities.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Specific Rules for Single-Dose Containers in USP <797>**\n\nUSP <797> has very specific rules for handling single-dose containers to minimize the risk of contamination. It is crucial to distinguish between different types of single-dose containers.\n\n*   **For a Single-Dose Vial (with a rubber stopper):** If a single-dose vial is punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment, it can be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial puncture, provided it is maintained within that ISO Class 5 environment. This allows for multiple entries into the same vial to prepare doses.\n*   **For a Single-Dose Ampule:** This is the container specified in the question. The rules for an ampule are much stricter.\n\n**Step 4: Focus on the Ampule and List Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Ampules Cannot Be Resealed.** The most critical factor for an ampule is that once the glass neck is broken, it becomes an open system. There is no rubber stopper or other barrier to protect the contents from the surrounding environment.\n*   **Careful Point 2: High Risk of Contamination.** Because it is an open system, an opened ampule is highly susceptible to microbial contamination from the air, even within the highly controlled ISO Class 5 environment. The protection afforded by the unidirectional HEPA-filtered air is not absolute for an open container.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The USP <797> Mandate.** Due to this high risk, USP <797> states that opened ampules cannot be stored for any period. They are intended for **immediate use only**.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Discarding Unused Contents.** After opening an ampule and withdrawing the required dose, any unused portion of the medication must be discarded immediately. It cannot be saved for later use, even if that later use is only minutes away.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Acquire the Final Answer**\n\n1.  The question specifies a **single-dose container ampule**.\n2.  The ampule is opened in a **sterile environment** (ISO Class 5).\n3.  Unlike a vial with a stopper, an ampule, once opened, is an **open system** that cannot be resealed.\n4.  According to USP <797>, to prevent microbial contamination, opened ampules cannot be stored.\n5.  Therefore, the contents must be used **immediately** after opening. The BUD is effectively zero time from the point of opening.\n6.  Any unused contents must be discarded immediately and not be used for any other purpose.\n\nThe final answer is that the contents of the ampule must be used immediately, and any remainder must be discarded. There is no extended BUD.\n\n<<<Immediate use. Any unused portion must be discarded and cannot be stored for any period."
