**Chemical Phase:** The sample is a mixture of two polymorphs of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃): **Aragonite** and **Calcite**.

**Unit Cell Structure:**
*   **Aragonite:** Orthorhombic
*   **Calcite:** Rhombohedral (Trigonal)

**Lattice Constants:**
The lattice constants are estimated based on the experimental data, but deviate slightly from pure reference values, likely due to crystal strain, ionic substitution, and preferred orientation.
*   **Aragonite (Orthorhombic):** a ≈ 4.86 Å, b ≈ 8.37 Å, c ≈ 5.23 Å
*   **Calcite (Rhombohedral, in hexagonal setting):** a ≈ 4.99 Å, c ≈ 17.71 Å
