    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂). This is a conjugated diene, a four-π-electron system.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂). This is an alkene derivative, a two-π-electron system. Alkenes in this context are called dienophiles.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as the Diels-Alder reaction. This reaction forms a six-membered ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the General Product Structure:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted, pericyclic reaction where a new six-membered ring is formed.\n    *   The four carbons of the diene (C1 to C4) and the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond form the new ring.\n    *   The double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4 of the diene are consumed, and a new double bond is formed between C2 and C3.\n    *   The double bond of the dienophile is consumed.\n    *   The resulting product skeleton is a cyclohexene ring. The substituents from the dienophile (two Cl atoms and two F atoms) will be attached to two adjacent carbons of this ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze Regioselectivity:**\n    *   The diene (butadiene) is symmetrical.\n    *   The dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) is unsymmetrical, as one carbon is bonded to two chlorine atoms (CCl₂) and the other is bonded to two fluorine atoms (CF₂).\n    *   Because the dienophile is unsymmetrical, there are two possible ways it can add to the diene, leading to two different constitutional isomers (regioisomers). We need to determine which one is the major product.\n    *   Regioselectivity in the Diels-Alder reaction is governed by electronic effects, specifically Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory. For a \"normal electron demand\" Diels-Alder reaction (electron-rich diene, electron-poor dienophile), the dominant interaction is between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile.\n    *   **Diene's HOMO:** For butadiene, the HOMO has the largest orbital coefficients on its terminal carbons (C1 and C4). These are the most nucleophilic sites.\n    *   **Dienophile's LUMO:** We need to identify the most electrophilic carbon in CCl₂=CF₂. This carbon will have the largest coefficient in the LUMO. The electrophilicity is determined by the electron-withdrawing character of the halogen substituents.\n        *   Fluorine is significantly more electronegative than chlorine. This creates a stronger inductive electron withdrawal (-I effect) from the carbon it's attached to.\n        *   Therefore, the carbon atom of the CF₂ group is more electron-deficient (more δ+) and thus more electrophilic than the carbon atom of the CCl₂ group.\n    *   **Prediction:** The reaction will preferentially occur in a way that aligns the largest coefficient of the diene's HOMO (at C1 or C4) with the largest coefficient of the dienophile's LUMO (at the CF₂ carbon). This means the primary new bond forms between a terminal carbon of butadiene and the CF₂ carbon of the dienophile.\n\n4.  **Construct the Major Product and Name It:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the major product forms from the dienophile orienting itself so that its CF₂ group bonds to one end of the butadiene chain (e.g., C1) and its CCl₂ group bonds to the other end (C4).\n    *   Let's trace the atoms in the resulting six-membered ring: `C1(from diene) - C2=C3 - C4(from diene) - C(Cl₂) - C(F₂) - (back to C1)`.\n    *   The product is a cyclohexene derivative with a CCl₂ group and a CF₂ group on adjacent saturated carbons.\n    *   To name the product using IUPAC nomenclature:\n        a.  The parent ring is cyclohexene. The double bond defines carbons 1 and 2.\n        b.  We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants). In this case, the substituents will be on carbons 4 and 5, regardless of the numbering direction around the ring. The locant set is {4,4,5,5}.\n        c.  When the locant set is the same, we use alphabetical order of the substituents to decide the numbering. \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically. Therefore, the CCl₂ group must be assigned the lower locant.\n        d.  Thus, the CCl₂ group is at position 4, and the CF₂ group is at position 5.\n    *   The systematic name of the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. Butadiene acts as the diene, and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene acts as the dienophile. The reaction forms a six-membered ring. Due to the higher electronegativity of fluorine compared to chlorine, the CF₂ carbon of the dienophile is more electrophilic. The regioselectivity of the reaction is governed by the interaction between the nucleophilic terminal carbons of butadiene and the more electrophilic CF₂ carbon of the dienophile. This leads to the formation of a specific regioisomer as the major product. The IUPAC name of this product is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
