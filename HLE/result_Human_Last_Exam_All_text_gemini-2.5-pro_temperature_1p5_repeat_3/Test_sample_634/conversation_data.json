    "An analysis of the question is as follows, with a step-by-step derivation of the answer.\n\n### **1. Understand the Question**\n\nThe objective is to find the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two given 2x2 polynomial matrices, `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`.\n\n*   **P1(s) = [s² + s, -s; -s² - 1, s²]**\n*   **P2(s) = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]**\n\n### **2. Key Concepts and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Right Divisor:** A polynomial matrix `R(s)` is a right divisor of `P(s)` if there exists a polynomial matrix `Q(s)` such that `P(s) = Q(s)R(s)`.\n*   **Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD):** A polynomial matrix `G(s)` is a GCRD of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` if:\n    1.  It is a common right divisor of both `P1` and `P2`.\n    2.  Any other common right divisor `D(s)` is a right divisor of `G(s)` (i.e., `G(s) = L(s)D(s)` for some polynomial matrix `L(s)`).\n*   **Uniqueness:** The GCRD is not unique. If `G(s)` is a GCRD, then `U(s)G(s)` is also a GCRD, where `U(s)` is any unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant). We typically choose a GCRD in a simplified or canonical form (e.g., row echelon form).\n*   **Method of Calculation:** The standard method for finding the GCRD is the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This algorithm involves performing elementary row operations on the stacked matrix `M = [P1; P2]` to reduce it to the form `[G; 0]`, where `G` is a square matrix. The resulting matrix `G` is a GCRD of `P1` and `P2`.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Polynomial matrix multiplication and division must be handled with care.\n    *   All row operations must be elementary (swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, or adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another). These operations are equivalent to left-multiplying by a unimodular matrix.\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Form the stacked matrix M.**\n\nWe begin by stacking `P1` and `P2` to form a 4x2 matrix `M(s)`.\n\n`M = [P1; P2] = [ s² + s,  -s   ;  (Row 1)\n                  -s² - 1,  s²   ;  (Row 2)\n                  s,        0    ;  (Row 3)\n                  -s - 1,   1    ]` (Row 4)\n\n**Step 2: Perform elementary row operations to simplify M.**\n\nThe goal is to introduce zero rows by finding linear dependencies among the rows. Let's inspect the rows. We can see a simple relationship between `Row 1` and `Row 4`.\n\n`(-s) * Row 4 = (-s) * [-s - 1, 1] = [s² + s, -s] = Row 1`\n\nThis shows that `Row 1` is a polynomial multiple of `Row 4`. We can use this to eliminate `Row 1` with the elementary row operation `Row 1 → Row 1 + s * Row 4`.\n\n`[s² + s, -s] + s*[-s - 1, 1] = [s² + s - s² - s, -s + s] = [0, 0]`\n\nAfter this operation, the matrix `M` becomes `M'`:\n\n`M' = [ 0,         0    ;\n       -s² - 1,  s²   ;  (Row 2)\n       s,        0    ;  (Row 3)\n       -s - 1,   1    ]` (Row 4)\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding a basis for the vector space spanned by the remaining three non-zero rows. Let's call the submatrix formed by these rows `M_sub`.\n\n`M_sub = [ -s² - 1,  s²   ;  (R'2)\n            s,        0    ;  (R'3)\n            -s - 1,   1    ]` (R'4)\n\n**Step 3: Reduce the submatrix M_sub.**\n\nWe continue with row reduction on `M_sub`.\n\n*   Use `R'3` to simplify `R'2`. Polynomial division of the first element of `R'2` by the first element of `R'3` is `(-s² - 1) / s = -s` with a remainder of `-1`.\n    Perform the operation `R'2 → R'2 + s * R'3`:\n    `[-s² - 1, s²] + s*[s, 0] = [-s² - 1 + s², s²] = [-1, s²]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    `[ -1,     s²   ;  (R''2)\n      s,      0    ;  (R'3)\n      -s - 1, 1    ]` (R'4)\n\n*   Now, use the new `R''2` to simplify `R'3` and `R'4`.\n    Perform `R'3 → R'3 + s * R''2`:\n    `[s, 0] + s*[-1, s²] = [s - s, s³] = [0, s³]`\n    Perform `R'4 → R'4 - (s + 1) * R''2`:\n    `[-s - 1, 1] - (s+1)*[-1, s²] = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1 - (s+1)s²] = [0, 1 - s³ - s²]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    `[ -1,   s²        ;\n      0,    s³        ;\n      0,    1 - s³ - s² ]`\n\n**Step 4: Final reduction to find the basis.**\n\nThe last two rows are `[0, s³]` and `[0, 1 - s³ - s²]`. The row space spanned by these two vectors is generated by `[0, gcd(s³, 1 - s³ - s²)]`.\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials:\n`gcd(s³, 1 - s³ - s²) = gcd(s³, -s³ - s² + 1)`\n`(-s³ - s² + 1) = (-1) * (s³) + (-s² + 1)`\n`s³ = (-s) * (-s² + 1) + s`\n`-s² + 1 = (-s) * s + 1`\nThe greatest common divisor (the last non-zero remainder) is `1`.\n\nThis means the row space spanned by `[0, s³]` and `[0, 1 - s³ - s²]` can be reduced to the space spanned by `[0, 1]`. Our basis vectors are now:\n`[ -1, s² ]`\n`[ 0,  1  ]`\n\n*   Finally, use the second row `[0, 1]` to eliminate the `s²` term in the first row.\n    Perform `Row 1 → Row 1 - s² * Row 2`:\n    `[-1, s²] - s² * [0, 1] = [-1, s² - s²] = [-1, 0]`\n\nThe final basis for the row space of `M` consists of the vectors `[-1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`.\n\n**Step 5: State the GCRD.**\n\nThese basis vectors form the rows of our GCRD, `G(s)`.\n`G(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1]`\n\nAs the GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix, we can multiply `G(s)` by the unimodular matrix `U(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1]` to get a normalized form, which is the identity matrix.\n`G_normalized(s) = U(s) * G(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1] * [-1, 0; 0, 1] = [1, 0; 0, 1] = I`\n\nThus, the greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix. This implies that `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` are **right coprime**.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
