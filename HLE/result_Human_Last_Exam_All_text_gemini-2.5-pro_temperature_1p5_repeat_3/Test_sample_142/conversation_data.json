    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Determine the Total Number of Electrons (N)**\n\nFirst, we need to count the total number of electrons in the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. We sum the atomic numbers (which equal the number of electrons for neutral atoms) for each atom in the molecule.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** Atomic number Z=6, so 6 electrons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Atomic number Z=1. There are two H atoms, so 2 * 1 = 2 electrons.\n*   **Silicon (Si):** Atomic number Z=14, so 14 electrons.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** Atomic number Z=9, so 9 electrons.\n\nThe total number of electrons is:\n$N = 6 + 2 + 14 + 9 = 31$ electrons.\n\n**Careful Point:** Since the number of electrons (N=31) is odd, the molecule must be a radical. The lowest possible total spin quantum number (S) for an odd-electron system is S = 1/2. Therefore, we are calculating the number of doublet CSFs.\n\n**2. Determine the Total Number of Basis Functions (K)**\n\nNext, we count the number of atomic orbital basis functions for the 6-31G** basis set for each atom.\n\n*   **Basis Set Notation:**\n    *   **6-31G:** A split-valence basis set. Core orbitals are represented by a single contracted function, while valence orbitals are \"split\" into two functions (an inner and an outer part).\n    *   **\\*\\***: Indicates the addition of polarization functions. The first `*` adds one set of d-type functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. The second `*` adds one set of p-type functions to hydrogen atoms. (We assume spherical harmonic functions, where a d-set has 5 functions and a p-set has 3).\n\n*   **Counting Basis Functions per Atom:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** The valence 1s orbital is split into two (1s, 1s'). The `**` adds a set of p-functions (px, py, pz).\n        *   Functions for H = 2 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = 5.\n        *   For two H atoms: 2 * 5 = 10 functions.\n    *   **Carbon (C) (Second-row atom):** Has a 1s core and 2s, 2p valence shells.\n        *   6-31G part: 1 (for 1s) + 2*(1 for 2s + 3 for 2p) = 9 functions.\n        *   The `*` adds a set of d-functions (5 functions).\n        *   Functions for C = 9 + 5 = 14.\n    *   **Fluorine (F) (Second-row atom):** Same rule as Carbon.\n        *   Functions for F = 9 + 5 = 14.\n    *   **Silicon (Si) (Third-row atom):** Has 1s, 2s, 2p core and 3s, 3p valence shells.\n        *   6-31G part: 1 (for 1s) + 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) + 2*(1 for 3s + 3 for 3p) = 5 + 8 = 13 functions.\n        *   The `*` adds a set of d-functions (5 functions).\n        *   Functions for Si = 13 + 5 = 18.\n\n*   **Total Number of Basis Functions (Spatial Orbitals, K):**\n    $K = (\\text{funcs for 2H}) + (\\text{funcs for C}) + (\\text{funcs for F}) + (\\text{funcs for Si})$\n    $K = 10 + 14 + 14 + 18 = 56$ spatial orbitals.\n\n**3. Use the Formula for the Number of CSFs**\n\nThe number of CSFs for a given spin S is calculated as the number of determinants with spin projection $M_S = S$ minus the number of determinants with spin projection $M_S = S+1$. This is given by the formula:\n\n$N_{CSF}(K,N,S) = \\binom{K}{N_\\alpha}\\binom{K}{N_\\beta} - \\binom{K}{N_\\alpha+1}\\binom{K}{N_\\beta-1}$\n\nwhere $N_\\alpha$ and $N_\\beta$ are the number of spin-up and spin-down electrons for the $M_S=S$ state. They are found by solving:\n$N_\\alpha + N_\\beta = N$\n$N_\\alpha - N_\\beta = 2S$\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to use the formula for CSFs, not the simpler formulas for Slater determinants, and to use the correct formula that is guaranteed to yield an integer result.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\n*   **Find $N_\\alpha$ and $N_\\beta$:**\n    With N = 31 and S = 1/2:\n    $N_\\alpha + N_\\beta = 31$\n    $N_\\alpha - N_\\beta = 2(1/2) = 1$\n    Solving these equations gives $2N_\\alpha = 32 \\implies N_\\alpha = 16$, and $N_\\beta = 15$.\n\n*   **Substitute values into the CSF formula:**\n    The formula requires terms for the next higher spin state ($S+1$). The term $\\binom{K}{N_\\alpha+1}\\binom{K}{N_\\beta-1}$ corresponds to the number of determinants with $N_\\alpha' = N_\\alpha+1=17$ and $N_\\beta' = N_\\beta-1=14$.\n    With K = 56, $N_\\alpha = 16$, and $N_\\beta = 15$, the number of CSFs is:\n    $N_{CSF} = \\binom{56}{16}\\binom{56}{15} - \\binom{56}{17}\\binom{56}{14}$\n\n*   **Calculate the binomial coefficients:**\n    *   $\\binom{56}{14} = 7,183,354,743,225$\n    *   $\\binom{56}{15} = 25,575,514,207,800$\n    *   $\\binom{56}{16} = 76,726,542,623,400$\n    *   $\\binom{56}{17} = 196,590,297,079,200$\n\n*   **Calculate the two product terms:**\n    *   Term 1 = $\\binom{56}{16} \\times \\binom{56}{15} = 76,726,542,623,400 \\times 25,575,514,207,800 = 1,962,388,656,627,068,532,296,052,000,000$\n    *   Term 2 = $\\binom{56}{17} \\times \\binom{56}{14} = 196,590,297,079,200 \\times 7,183,354,743,225 = 1,412,093,774,026,330,032,906,200,000,000$\n\n*   **Calculate the final result:**\n    $N_{CSF}$ = Term 1 - Term 2\n    $N_{CSF} = 1,962,388,656,627,068,532,296,052,000,000 - 1,412,093,774,026,330,032,906,200,000,000$\n    $N_{CSF} = 550,294,882,600,738,499,389,852,000,000$\n\nThis can be written in scientific notation as approximately $5.503 \\times 10^{26}$."
