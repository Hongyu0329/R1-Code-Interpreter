No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The reason is that this process requires the material to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is only present in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry. The ideal crystal structures of stable free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, meaning their bulk χ⁽²⁾ is zero by symmetry. While real-world effects like defects, strain, or edges could locally break this symmetry and permit a very weak effect, it is not an expected intrinsic property of the material.
