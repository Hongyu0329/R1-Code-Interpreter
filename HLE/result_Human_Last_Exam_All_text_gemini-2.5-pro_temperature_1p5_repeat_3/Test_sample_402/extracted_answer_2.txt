A two-step filtering strategy. First, identify a list of contaminant genes by performing a differential expression analysis on control samples: pure cancer cell line RNA-seq vs. pure T-cell RNA-seq. Create a list of genes with a very high log2 fold change (e.g., >5) and statistical significance (e.g., padj < 0.01) from this analysis; these are your cancer-specific markers. Second, run your primary differential expression analysis on the experimental samples (CAR-T-IL15 vs. CAR-T). Then, use a command-line utility like `grep -v -f` to remove the previously identified list of contaminant genes from your final results table.
