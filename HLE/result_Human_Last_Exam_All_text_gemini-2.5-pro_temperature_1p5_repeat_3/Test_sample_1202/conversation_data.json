    "This question asks to identify the most probable mechanism that allows duplicate genes to be kept in the genome (retention) and to evolve different sequences (divergence), rather than being lost.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the options:\n\n1.  **Understand the initial problem:** When a gene is duplicated, the new copy is initially redundant. The organism has two functional copies where only one is needed. Because it is redundant, the second copy is not under strong selective pressure to remain functional. It can accumulate mutations without harming the organism. The most common fate for such a redundant gene is to accumulate so many deleterious mutations that it becomes non-functional, turning into a \"pseudogene\". Therefore, for a duplicate gene to be retained and diverge, there needs to be a specific evolutionary mechanism at play.\n\n2.  **Analyze Choice A: Gene conversion.** Gene conversion is a process where the sequence of one gene is used as a template to \"correct\" or replace the sequence of its homologous partner (in this case, the duplicate gene). This process makes the two gene copies more similar, or even identical. It actively works *against* divergence. Therefore, it is not the primary mechanism for retaining two distinct, divergent genes.\n\n3.  **Analyze Choice B: Pseudogenization.** This is the process where a duplicate gene becomes non-functional due to the accumulation of mutations. This is the most common outcome, representing a *failure* to retain a functional gene, not a mechanism for its retention. Thus, this is the opposite of what the question is asking for.\n\n4.  **Analyze Choice C: Neofunctionalization.** In this model, one copy of the duplicated gene maintains the original function, while the other copy is free to accumulate mutations. By chance, a mutation may arise that gives this copy a completely new, beneficial function. Natural selection would then act to preserve this second copy because of its new, useful role. This model successfully explains both retention (due to the new advantage) and divergence (the sequence must change to acquire the new function). This is a very important mechanism for evolutionary innovation.\n\n5.  **Analyze Choice D: Subfunctionalization.** This model, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, proposes that the original ancestral gene had multiple functions (pleiotropy) or complex regulation (e.g., expressed in different tissues). After duplication, degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations can occur in both copies, but in different parts of the gene. For example, copy 1 might lose the ability to function in tissue A, while copy 2 loses the ability to function in tissue B. Now, both copies are required to perform the complete set of functions of the original gene. This \"division of labor\" makes both genes essential and ensures their retention. They also diverge as they accumulate different mutations.\n\n6.  **Analyze Choice E: Adaptive radiation.** This is a macroevolutionary term describing the rapid diversification of a single lineage into many new species filling different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a mechanism for retaining an individual gene at the molecular level. This choice operates at the wrong biological scale.\n\n7.  **Compare the plausible options (C and D):** Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** requires a rare event: a gain-of-function mutation that creates a new, beneficial role for the gene.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization** relies on more common events: degenerative mutations that knock out parts of a gene's existing function.\n    *   Because loss-of-function mutations are much more frequent than beneficial gain-of-function mutations, many evolutionary biologists argue that subfunctionalization is a more common and therefore more \"likely\" pathway for the initial preservation of duplicate genes. It provides a passive, neutral way to protect both copies from being lost to pseudogenization, essentially holding them in the genome long enough that they might later have the opportunity to neofunctionalize.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are valid mechanisms, subfunctionalization is considered a more probable or frequent pathway for the initial retention of duplicate genes because it relies on common degenerative mutations rather than rare beneficial ones.\n\n<<<D>>>"
