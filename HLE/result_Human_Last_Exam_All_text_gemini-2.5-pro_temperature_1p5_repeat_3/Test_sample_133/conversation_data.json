    "This is a Connect 4 game analysis. The current player is O. The goal is to find all optimal moves for O to win as fast as possible.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the current board state and identify the goal.**\n    *   The board is partially filled with X and O tokens.\n    *   It is O's turn to move.\n    *   The goal is to find moves that lead to a win for O in the minimum number of turns. This means we first look for an immediate winning move (a \"win in 1\"). If none exists, we look for a move that forces a win on the next turn (a \"win in 3\", i.e., O plays, X blocks, O plays the winning move).\n\n2.  **List all possible moves for O.**\n    A move is possible if the column is not full. The token will fall to the lowest empty spot in the chosen column.\n    *   Column a: Lowest empty spot is a4.\n    *   Column b: Lowest empty spot is b5.\n    *   Column c: Lowest empty spot is c4.\n    *   Column d: Lowest empty spot is d3.\n    *   Column e: Lowest empty spot is e3.\n    *   Column f: Lowest empty spot is f4.\n    *   Column g: Lowest empty spot is g4.\n\n3.  **Check for immediate winning moves (Win in 1).**\n    We need to check if any of the possible moves (`a4, b5, c4, d3, e3, f4, g4`) result in O getting four tokens in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n    *   **Horizontal:** There is no existing row with three O's and a blank space for O to play. The closest is row 4 with `O O` at d4 and e4.\n    *   **Vertical:** There is no existing column with three O's stacked up. The closest is column d with `O O` at d4 and d5. Playing at d3 would make it `O O O`.\n    *   **Diagonal:** The diagonal `c6-d5-e4` contains three O's. However, the winning spot `f3` is not playable because the spot below it, `f4`, is empty.\n    *   A thorough check confirms there is no move for O that results in an immediate win.\n\n4.  **Check for moves that set up a forced win (Win in 3).**\n    This usually involves creating a \"double threat,\" where the opponent can only block one of two winning possibilities. A common way to do this is to create an \"open-ended three-in-a-row\".\n\n    *   **Move c4:**\n        *   If O plays at `c4`, it creates a horizontal sequence of three O's: `c4-d4-e4`.\n        *   This line is open at both ends: `b4` and `f4`.\n        *   To avoid losing, X must play in either `b4` or `f4`.\n        *   If X plays at `b4`, O plays at `f4` and wins with the line `c4-d4-e4-f4`.\n        *   If X plays at `f4`, O plays at `b4` and wins with the line `b4-c4-d4-e4`.\n        *   Since X can only block one of the two winning spots, this move guarantees a win for O on the next turn. Thus, `c4` is an optimal move.\n\n    *   **Move f4:**\n        *   If O plays at `f4`, it creates a horizontal sequence of three O's: `d4-e4-f4`.\n        *   This line is open at both ends: `c4` and `g4`.\n        *   To avoid losing, X must play in either `c4` or `g4`.\n        *   If X plays at `c4`, O plays at `g4` and wins with the line `d4-e4-f4-g4`.\n        *   If X plays at `g4`, O plays at `c4` and wins with the line `c4-d4-e4-f4`.\n        *   This also guarantees a win for O on the next turn. Thus, `f4` is also an optimal move.\n\n    *   **Other moves:**\n        *   `d3`: Creates a vertical threat of three O's (`d3-d4-d5`), which can be won at `d2`. This is a single threat, which X can easily block by playing at `d2`. Not optimal.\n        *   Other moves like `a4`, `b5`, `e3`, `g4` do not create an immediate or forced win.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    There are no immediate winning moves for O. However, two moves, `c4` and `f4`, each create an unstoppable horizontal threat that guarantees a win for O on the subsequent turn. As they both lead to the fastest possible win, they are the optimal moves.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe optimal moves for O are c4 and f4.\n\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
