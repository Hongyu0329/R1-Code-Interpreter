    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the target word and the sentence.** The word to be analyzed is \"Fat\". The sentence is \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\n2.  **Examine the position of the word \"Fat\".** The word \"Fat\" appears directly before the word \"people\".\n3.  **Analyze the word \"people\".** \"People\" is a noun, specifically the plural form of \"person\".\n4.  **Determine the relationship between \"Fat\" and \"people\".** In English grammar, a word that is placed before a noun to describe or modify it is typically an adjective. In the phrase \"Fat people\", the word \"Fat\" describes a characteristic of the \"people\". It answers the question \"What kind of people?\".\n5.  **Consider other possibilities.**\n    *   Can \"Fat\" be a noun? Yes, \"fat\" can be a noun (e.g., \"Cooking with fat\"). However, in the given phrase \"Fat people\", the most natural and common grammatical reading is to interpret \"Fat\" as an adjective describing \"people\". If \"Fat\" were a noun, the phrase would be a noun-noun compound (like \"school bus\"), which doesn't make sense here, or it would imply \"people eat fat\", but the sentence structure \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is very awkward for that meaning.\n    *   Can \"Fat\" be a verb, adverb, or conjunction? No. It doesn't denote an action (verb), modify a verb or adjective (adverb), or connect clauses (conjunction).\n6.  **Conclusion based on grammatical structure.** The phrase \"Fat people\" follows a standard adjective-noun construction (like \"tall buildings\", \"red cars\", \"happy children\"). Therefore, the word \"Fat\" is functioning as an adjective in this sentence, modifying the noun \"people\". The grammatical incorrectness of the rest of the sentence (\"eat accumulates\") does not change the part of speech of \"Fat\" in the initial noun phrase.\n\nCareful points:\n*   The sentence provided is grammatically incorrect. You must analyze the part of speech based on the word's role in its immediate context within the sentence, not on the correctness of the sentence as a whole.\n*   The core of the analysis rests on the relationship between \"Fat\" and \"people\".\n*   The most direct and standard grammatical interpretation of the phrase \"Fat people\" is an adjective followed by a noun.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe word \"Fat\" describes the noun \"people\". A word that describes or modifies a noun is an adjective. Therefore, \"Fat\" is an adjective.\n\n<<<C>>>"
