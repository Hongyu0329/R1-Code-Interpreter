    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe goal is to identify which of the many battles painted by the artist Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler, occurred at the latest date in history. This is about the date of the event itself, not the date the painting was created.\n\n**Step 2: List Major Battle Paintings by Lady Butler and the Dates of the Events Depicted**\nWe need to compile a list of Lady Butler's famous paintings that depict specific military engagements and identify the year each event took place.\n\n*   ***Quatre Bras* (painted 1875):** Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which took place on June 16, **1815**, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!* (painted 1881):** Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo, which took place on June 18, **1815**.\n*   ***The Roll Call* (painted 1874):** Depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War, which occurred on November 5, **1854**.\n*   ***Balaclava* (painted 1876):** Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava, also during the Crimean War, on October 25, **1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift* (painted 1880):** Depicts the Battle of Rorke's Drift during the Anglo-Zulu War, which took place on January 22-23, **1879**.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!* (painted 1882):** Depicts an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War on January 28, **1881**.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir* (painted 1885):** Depicts the Battle of Tel El Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War on September 13, **1882**.\n*   ***A Desert Grave* (painted 1887) and *The Camel Corps* (c. 1890s):** These paintings depict scenes from the Gordon Relief Expedition in Sudan (1884-85), which included the Battle of Abu Klea in January **1885**.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Lady Butler's Later Works**\nA careful point is not to stop at her most famous 19th-century works. Lady Butler lived until 1933 and continued to paint, including scenes from World War I.\n\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards* (painted c. 1915):** Depicts the British Expeditionary Force during the Great Retreat from Mons in August **1914**.\n*   ***The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February 1916* (painted 1917):** Depicts a specific cavalry charge during the Senussi Campaign in Egypt as part of the wider conflict of World War I. The event took place on February 26, **1916**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare All Dates to Find the Latest Battle**\nLet's list the years of the battles we have identified in chronological order:\n*   1815 (Quatre Bras, Waterloo)\n*   1854 (Inkerman, Balaclava)\n*   1879 (Rorke's Drift)\n*   1881 (Laing's Nek)\n*   1882 (Tel El Kebir)\n*   1885 (Battle of Abu Klea)\n*   1914 (Retreat from Mons)\n*   1916 (Affair of Agagia)\n\nBy comparing these dates, it is clear that **1916** is the latest year.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Affair of Agagia, which occurred on February 26, 1916. The painting is titled *The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February 1916*.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Event Date vs. Painting Date:** The question asks for the latest battle depicted (event date), not the latest painting created (painting date). For example, *Scotland for Ever!* was painted in 1881, but the Battle of Waterloo it depicts was in 1815.\n2.  **Completeness of Works:** It is important to consider the artist's entire career. Limiting the analysis to only her most famous works from the Victorian era would lead to an incorrect answer (the Battle of Abu Klea in 1885), as she painted scenes from the later World War I.\n3.  **Specificity of the Battle:** Ensure the painting depicts a specific, dateable battle or military campaign. Some works might be more generic scenes of military life.\n\nBy following this analysis, the correct answer can be confidently determined.\n\n<<<The Affair of Agagia (1916)"
