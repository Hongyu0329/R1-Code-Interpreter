    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Interpret the Question\n\nThe question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\)\". The term \"generalized Markov number\" can have different meanings in different mathematical contexts. In the classical theory, Markov numbers are integers associated with specific Diophantine equations and quadratic irrationals whose continued fractions have a particular periodic structure. These classical cases are linked to rational numbers \\(p/q\\) whose own continued fractions are palindromic.\n\nThe given rational number is \\(4/7\\). Its continued fraction is not palindromic, so it does not correspond to a classical Markov number. Therefore, we are in the realm of \"generalized\" Markov numbers. A common way to generalize the theory is to associate a non-palindromic rational with a canonical periodic continued fraction.\n\nThe most natural and mathematically consistent interpretation is that the problem requires us to:\n1.  Find the finite continued fraction of the rational number \\(4/7\\).\n2.  Use the coefficients from this finite continued fraction to construct a periodic block that is a palindrome.\n3.  The final answer will be the purely periodic continued fraction formed from this palindromic block, prefixed with a zero integer part.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Continued Fraction of 4/7\n\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\).\n1.  Since \\(0 < 4/7 < 1\\), the integer part is \\(a_0 = 0\\). We consider its reciprocal, \\(7/4\\).\n2.  \\(\\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4}\\). The first coefficient is \\(a_1 = 1\\).\n3.  We take the reciprocal of the remainder: \\(\\frac{1}{3/4} = \\frac{4}{3}\\).\n4.  \\(\\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\). The second coefficient is \\(a_2 = 1\\).\n5.  We take the reciprocal of the remainder: \\(\\frac{1}{1/3} = 3\\).\n6.  \\(3 = 3 + 0\\). The third coefficient is \\(a_3 = 3\\). The process terminates.\n\nSo, the continued fraction representation of \\(4/7\\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\). The sequence of coefficients after the integer part is \\((a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3)\\).\n\n### Step 3: Construct the Palindromic Block\n\nA standard method to create a periodic continued fraction associated with a finite sequence of coefficients \\((a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n)\\) is to form a palindromic block. A very common and mathematically significant construction for this is to create the block \\((a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{n-1}, a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_2, a_1)\\).\n\nFor our sequence of coefficients \\((1, 1, 3)\\), we have \\(n=3\\). The resulting palindromic block is:\n\\((a_1, a_2, a_3, a_2, a_1) = (1, 1, 3, 1, 1)\\)\n\nThis sequence is a palindrome, as it reads the same forwards and backward. The periodic continued fractions based on such palindromic blocks correspond to an important class of quadratic irrationals.\n\n### Step 4: Form the Associated Continued Fraction\n\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the one whose periodic part is the palindromic block we constructed in the previous step. We write this as a purely periodic continued fraction with a zero integer part.\n\nThe final continued fraction is:\n\\([0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 1, 1}]\\)\n\nThis notation represents the number\n\\( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\dots}}}}} \\)\nwhere the sequence of denominators \\((1, 1, 3, 1, 1)\\) repeats infinitely."
