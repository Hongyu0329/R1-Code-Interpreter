    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**:\n    *   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This seeks a specific point in time (day, month, year), not just an artifact's age determined by radiocarbon dating.\n    *   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed or written down.\n    *   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must have existed in the Americas before 1492.\n    *   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written in a native script, such as Maya hieroglyphs, Zapotec script, or Isthmian (Epi-Olmec) script.\n\n2.  **Identify Writing Systems with Calendars**:\n    Several pre-Columbian civilizations developed writing and complex calendars. The most relevant for recording specific, non-repeating dates are those that used the **Long Count calendar**. This system counts days continuously from a mythical starting point, allowing for the precise pinpointing of any day in history. The primary users of this system were the Maya and their predecessors/neighbors like the Epi-Olmec and other groups in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region.\n\n3.  **Differentiate Between Date Types**:\n    It is crucial to distinguish between two types of recorded dates:\n    *   **Repeating Calendar Dates**: These are day names within a cycle, like the 260-day *tzolk'in*. An example is a glyph for \"7 Deer\". While this is a calendrical notation, the day \"7 Deer\" repeats every 260 days and does not, by itself, specify a unique year. The earliest known example of this is a \"7 Deer\" notation from San Bartolo, Guatemala, dated archaeologically to circa 250 BCE.\n    *   **Absolute (Long Count) Dates**: These dates are unique and non-repeating. They are expressed as a series of five numbers representing a count of days from the calendar's start date (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE). This is the type of date that best fits the question's request for a specific, recorded date.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Artifacts with the Earliest Absolute Dates**:\n    We must look for the artifact with the oldest inscribed Long Count date. The main contenders are:\n\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C**: Found in Veracruz, Mexico, this monument was for a long time the record holder. It belongs to the Epi-Olmec culture.\n        *   **Inscribed Long Count Date**: 7.16.6.16.18\n        *   **Gregorian Calendar Equivalent**: September 3, 32 BCE.\n\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**: Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this artifact proved to be even older. It was found at a site with a complex history, showing influence from early Zoque or proto-Mayan peoples. The writing style is also very early.\n        *   **Inscribed Long Count Date**: 7.16.3.2.13\n        *   **Comparison**: When compared to the Tres Zapotes date (7.16.6.16.18), the number in the third position (the *tun*, or 360-day period) is smaller (3 vs. 6), meaning this date is earlier.\n        *   **Gregorian Calendar Equivalent**: This date correlates to **December 7, 36 BCE**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWhile earlier examples of calendrical *notation* exist (like the \"7 Deer\" glyph from San Bartolo), the earliest *specific, non-repeating historical date* recorded in an indigenous writing system is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo. This monument uses the Long Count system to record a date that corresponds to December of 36 BCE.\n\n***\n\nThe earliest known recorded date is from Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2, which bears the Long Count date 7.16.3.2.13. This correlates to the Gregorian calendar date of **December 7, 36 BCE**.\n\n<<<December 7, 36 BCE>>>"
