    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the Lie algebra structure.**\n    The given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is 6-dimensional with basis $e_1, \\ldots, e_6$. The non-zero brackets are $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\n    We can identify a 5-dimensional abelian ideal $\\mathfrak{n} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$. The commutation relations within $\\mathfrak{n}$ are all zero.\n    The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be written as a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R}e_1 \\ltimes \\mathfrak{n}$, where the action of $e_1$ on $\\mathfrak{n}$ is given by the adjoint representation, $\\text{ad}(e_1)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Poincaré polynomial using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence.**\n    For a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{h} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{n}$ where $\\mathfrak{n}$ is an ideal, there is a spectral sequence with $E_2^{p,q} = H^p(\\mathfrak{h}, H^q(\\mathfrak{n}))$, which converges to $H^{p+q}(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n    In our case, $\\mathfrak{h} = \\mathbb{R}e_1 \\cong \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathfrak{n}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian Lie algebra, so $\\mathfrak{n} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n3.  **Compute the cohomology of the ideal $\\mathfrak{n}$.**\n    Since $\\mathfrak{n}$ is abelian, its cohomology algebra is the exterior algebra of its dual space: $H^q(\\mathfrak{n}; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{n}^*)$.\n    Let $\\{e^2, e^3, e^4, e^5, e^6\\}$ be the basis of $\\mathfrak{n}^*$ dual to $\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$.\n    The dimension of $H^q(\\mathfrak{n})$ is $\\binom{5}{q}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the action of $\\mathfrak{h}$ on $H^q(\\mathfrak{n})$.**\n    The action of $e_1 \\in \\mathfrak{h}$ on $H^q(\\mathfrak{n}) = \\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{n}^*)$ is induced by the adjoint action. It is given by the Lie derivative $L_{e_1}$. The action on the 1-forms in $\\mathfrak{n}^*$ is given by the operator $L = -(\\text{ad}(e_1)|_\\mathfrak{n})^T$.\n    The matrix of $\\text{ad}(e_1)$ on $\\mathfrak{n}$ with respect to the basis $(e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6)$ is:\n    $\\text{ad}(e_1)(e_2)=e_3$, $\\text{ad}(e_1)(e_3)=e_4$, $\\text{ad}(e_1)(e_4)=0$, $\\text{ad}(e_1)(e_5)=e_6$, $\\text{ad}(e_1)(e_6)=0$.\n    $A = \\text{Mat}(\\text{ad}(e_1)|_\\mathfrak{n}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The action on $\\mathfrak{n}^*$ is given by $L = -A^T$. In the dual basis $(e^2, \\ldots, e^6)$, we find the action of $L$:\n    $L(e^j) (e_k) = -e^j([e_1, e_k])$.\n    $L(e^2) = 0$\n    $L(e^3) = -e^2$\n    $L(e^4) = -e^3$\n    $L(e^5) = 0$\n    $L(e^6) = -e^5$\n    The operator $L$ is nilpotent.\n\n5.  **Decompose the action.**\n    The space $\\mathfrak{n}^* = V$ decomposes into two $L$-invariant subspaces, $V = V_1 \\oplus V_2$, where $V_1 = \\text{span}\\{e^2, e^3, e^4\\}$ and $V_2 = \\text{span}\\{e^5, e^6\\}$.\n    Let $L_1 = L|_{V_1}$ and $L_2 = L|_{V_2}$. The action of $L$ on $\\Lambda^q(V)$ is the sum of the induced actions.\n\n6.  **Compute the invariants and coinvariants.**\n    The $E_2$ page is given by $E_2^{p,q} = H^p(\\mathbb{R}, H^q(\\mathfrak{n}))$. Since the action is by a single operator $L$, the cohomology of $\\mathbb{R}$ is computed by the complex $0 \\to H^q(\\mathfrak{n}) \\stackrel{L}{\\to} H^q(\\mathfrak{n}) \\to 0$.\n    $E_2^{0,q} = H^0(\\mathbb{R}, H^q(\\mathfrak{n})) = \\ker(L: \\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{n}^*) \\to \\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{n}^*))$.\n    $E_2^{1,q} = H^1(\\mathbb{R}, H^q(\\mathfrak{n})) = \\text{coker}(L: \\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{n}^*) \\to \\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{n}^*))$.\n    $E_2^{p,q} = 0$ for $p \\neq 0, 1$.\n    Since $L$ is a nilpotent operator on a finite-dimensional space, $\\dim(\\ker L) = \\dim(\\text{coker} L)$.\n    Let $K(x) = \\sum_q \\dim(\\ker L|_{\\Lambda^q V}) x^q$ and $C(x) = \\sum_q \\dim(\\text{coker} L|_{\\Lambda^q V}) x^q$. Then $K(x)=C(x)$.\n    The problem reduces to computing $K(x)$.\n    Using the decomposition $V=V_1 \\oplus V_2$, we have $K(x) = K_1(x) K_2(x)$, where $K_i(x)$ is the corresponding polynomial for $V_i$.\n    For $V_1 = \\text{span}\\{e^2, e^3, e^4\\}$, $L_1$ forms a single Jordan block of size 3. The dimensions of the kernels on $\\Lambda^i V_1$ for $i=0,1,2,3$ are all 1. So, $K_1(x) = 1+x+x^2+x^3$.\n    For $V_2 = \\text{span}\\{e^5, e^6\\}$, $L_2$ forms a single Jordan block of size 2. The dimensions of the kernels on $\\Lambda^j V_2$ for $j=0,1,2$ are all 1. So, $K_2(x) = 1+x+x^2$.\n    Thus, $K(x) = (1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x+x^2) = 1+2x+3x^2+3x^3+2x^4+x^5$.\n\n7.  **Compute the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$.**\n    Since $L$ is nilpotent, the spectral sequence degenerates at the $E_2$ page ($d_r=0$ for $r \\ge 2$).\n    So, $E_\\infty^{p,q} = E_2^{p,q}$.\n    The Betti numbers of $\\mathfrak{g}$ are $b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\sum_{p+q=k} \\dim E_\\infty^{p,q} = \\dim E_2^{0,k} + \\dim E_2^{1,k-1}$.\n    The Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_k b_k x^k = \\sum_k (\\dim E_2^{0,k})x^k + \\sum_k (\\dim E_2^{1,k-1})x^k$.\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = K(x) + x C(x)$.\n    Since $K(x) = C(x)$, we have $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)K(x)$.\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)(1+2x+3x^2+3x^3+2x^4+x^5)$.\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+2x+3x^2+3x^3+2x^4+x^5) + (x+2x^2+3x^3+3x^4+2x^5+x^6)$\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + (2+1)x + (3+2)x^2 + (3+3)x^3 + (2+3)x^4 + (1+2)x^5 + x^6$\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The coefficients are symmetric ($b_k = b_{6-k}$), which is a common feature, though not guaranteed for all Lie algebras.\n$b_0 = 1$: ok\n$b_1 = 3$: $H^1(\\mathfrak{g})$ is the quotient of the derivations by inner derivations. Also $\\dim H^1(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim(Z^1/B^1) = \\dim(\\ker(d|_{\\Lambda^1}))$. $de^1=de^2=de^5=0$, others non-zero. So $Z^1=\\text{span}(e^1,e^2,e^5)$, $\\dim=3$. $B^1=0$. So $b_1=3$. Correct.\n$b_2 = 5$. A direct calculation of $b_2 = \\dim(Z^2/B^2)$ is more involved but can be error-prone. The spectral sequence method is systematic and robust.\n\nFinal Answer: The Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is $1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 5*x^2 + 6*x^3 + 5*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
