No, homopolynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They differ in their fundamental monomer units (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), the chemical bonds linking these units (phosphodiester bonds vs. glycosidic bonds), and their overall chemical composition and backbone structure (a sugar-phosphate backbone containing N and P vs. a sugar-only backbone containing only C, H, and O).
