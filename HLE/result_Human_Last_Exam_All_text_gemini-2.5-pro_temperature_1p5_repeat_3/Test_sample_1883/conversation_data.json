    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactant and Reaction Type\nThe reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is a linear conjugated polyene with four double bonds. The reaction occurs under thermal conditions and produces two diastereomeric cyclic products, a `cis`-isomer (A) and a `trans`-isomer (B). This is characteristic of an electrocyclic ring closure reaction. The reacting system is the octatetraene portion of the molecule (from C2 to C9), which involves 8 π-electrons. The methyl groups at C1 and C10 are the substituents on the terminal carbons of the reacting system.\n\n### Step 2: Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory and Woodward-Hoffmann Rules\nThe stereochemical course of an electrocyclic reaction is governed by the symmetry of the Frontier Molecular Orbital of the polyene.\n1.  **Number of π-electrons**: The reacting system is an octatetraene, which has 8 π-electrons. This falls into the category of 4k systems, where k=2.\n2.  **Reaction condition**: The reaction is conducted under thermal conditions, which means it proceeds from the electronic ground state of the reactant.\n3.  **Frontier Orbital**: For a thermal reaction, the controlling orbital is the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO). For octatetraene with 8 MOs (ψ₁ to ψ₈), the 8 π-electrons fill the first four MOs. Thus, the HOMO is ψ₄.\n4.  **Symmetry of HOMO**: For any linear polyene, the terminal p-orbital lobes in the MO ψₙ are symmetric if n is odd and antisymmetric if n is even. Since our HOMO is ψ₄ (n=4 is even), the lobes at the terminal carbons (C2 and C9) are **antisymmetric**.\n5.  **Allowed Reaction Mode**: For a thermal reaction of a 4k π-electron system, the Woodward-Hoffmann rules predict a **conrotatory** ring closure. This is the mode where the terminal p-orbitals rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) to achieve a bonding (in-phase) overlap. This is the \"symmetry-allowed\" pathway.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Allowed Product (B)\nTo predict the stereochemistry of the product, we must first determine the orientation of the substituents on the terminal carbons (C2 and C9) in the coiled, reactive conformation of the tetraene.\n1.  **Substituent at C2**: The C2=C3 double bond has a Z configuration. This means the high-priority groups, C1(Me) and the rest of the chain at C3, are on the same side of the double bond. For the chain to coil up to bring C2 and C9 together, the backbone must be on the \"inside\" of the coil. Due to the Z-geometry, the methyl group at C2 is also forced to be on the **\"inside\"** (pointing towards the helical axis), while the hydrogen is on the \"outside\".\n2.  **Substituent at C9**: The C8=C9 double bond has an E configuration. The high-priority groups, the chain at C8 and the C10(Me) group, are on opposite sides. With the chain backbone on the \"inside\" of the coil, the methyl group at C9 must be on the **\"outside\"** (pointing away from the helical axis), while its hydrogen is on the \"inside\".\n3.  **Outcome of Conrotation**: The reactive conformation has [Me(in), H(out)] at C2 and [Me(out), H(in)] at C9. During a conrotatory motion, the two methyl groups will move into opposite positions relative to the plane of the newly formed ring. For example, in one of the two possible conrotatory motions, the 'in' methyl at C2 moves 'up' while the 'out' methyl at C9 moves 'down'. This results in a product where the two methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring, which is the **`trans`-isomer (B)**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The symmetry-allowed thermal reaction produces the `trans`-isomer B.\n\n### Step 4: Explain the Formation of the `cis`-Isomer (A)\nThe problem states that the `cis`-isomer A is also formed. Since the allowed pathway exclusively leads to the `trans` product, the `cis` product must arise from a different, less favored pathway.\n1.  **Symmetry-Forbidden Pathway**: The alternative to the conrotatory motion is the **disrotatory** motion (where termini rotate in opposite directions). For a 4k thermal system, this pathway is \"symmetry-forbidden\" because it leads to an antibonding overlap of the HOMO lobes in the transition state. It has a significantly higher electronic activation barrier.\n2.  **Stereochemical Outcome of Disrotation**: Let's analyze the outcome of a disrotatory motion on the same reactive conformer: [Me(in), H(out)] at C2 and [Me(out), H(in)] at C9. In a disrotatory closure, both methyl groups will move to the same side of the forming ring (e.g., both \"up\" or both \"down\"). This results in the **`cis`-isomer (A)**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The `cis`-isomer A is the product of the symmetry-forbidden disrotatory pathway.\n\n### Step 5: Predict the Ratio of A and B\n1.  **Major vs. Minor Product**: Since product B (`trans`) is formed via the symmetry-allowed pathway and product A (`cis`) is formed via the symmetry-forbidden pathway, B is expected to be the major product and A the minor product. The ratio A:B should be less than 1.\n2.  **Quantitative Ratio**: The ratio of the products is determined by the difference in the activation energies (ΔE‡) of the two competing transition states (TS): `Ratio A/B = k_dis / k_con = exp(-ΔE‡ / RT)`. Usually, the barrier for a forbidden reaction is very high (>15 kcal/mol), making its contribution negligible.\n3.  **Torquoselectivity and A Special Case**: This specific reactant is a classic example in physical organic chemistry where the forbidden product is formed in significant amounts. Computational studies (notably by K. N. Houk) have shown that the activation energy difference (ΔE‡) between the forbidden disrotatory TS and the allowed conrotatory TS is unusually small (in the range of 1 kcal/mol). This is attributed to steric factors. The allowed transition state suffers from some steric strain that raises its energy, bringing it closer to the energy of the electronically disfavored but sterically less strained forbidden transition state.\n4.  **Final Prediction**: Given this small energy difference, the forbidden pathway becomes competitive. The experimentally observed product ratio for A (`cis`) to B (`trans`) is approximately **1:3**. While this value cannot be derived from simple FMO theory alone without knowledge of the activation energies, it is the established result for this well-known reaction. The question implicitly requires this knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the predicted ratio of isomer A (`cis`) to isomer B (`trans`) is 1:3.\n\n<<<1:3>>>"
