    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and Key Concepts\n\n1.  **The Algebra A**: $A$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a finite-dimensional, hereditary algebra of Dynkin type $A_3$. The category of finite-dimensional $A$-modules, mod-$A$, is well-understood.\n\n2.  **Indecomposable Modules**: There are 6 indecomposable modules, which can be represented by intervals $[i,j]$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$:\n    *   $S_1 = [1,1]$ (Simple, Injective)\n    *   $S_2 = [2,2]$ (Simple)\n    *   $S_3 = [3,3]$ (Simple, Projective) = $P_3$\n    *   $I_2 = [1,2]$ (Injective)\n    *   $P_2 = [2,3]$ (Projective)\n    *   $P_1 = [1,3]$ (Projective, Injective) = $I_3$\n\n3.  **$\\tau$-tilting modules**: For a hereditary algebra $A$, the concepts of a tilting module and a $\\tau$-tilting module coincide. A module $T$ is a tilting module if:\n    a. The number of non-isomorphic indecomposable direct summands of $T$ is equal to the number of simple $A$-modules, which is 3.\n    b. $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T, T) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Checking the Tilting Condition**: For a hereditary algebra, the condition $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T, T)=0$ can be checked as follows. Let $T = P \\oplus M$, where $P$ is a direct sum of projective modules and $M$ has no projective summands. The condition simplifies to:\n    a. $\\text{Ext}^1_A(M, M) = 0$. This is equivalent to $\\text{Hom}_A(M, \\tau M) = 0$, where $\\tau$ is the Auslander-Reiten translation. This means $M$ must be a $\\tau$-rigid module.\n    b. $\\text{Ext}^1_A(M, P) = 0$.\n\n5.  **Slice Modules**: For a representation-finite hereditary algebra like our $A$, a fundamental theorem by Happel and Ringel states that every tilting module is a slice module. This suggests that the question relies on a specific interpretation or definition of \"slice\" that creates an exception. A common informal view of a slice is a \"cut\" across the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver, separating the preprojective modules from the preinjective ones. The set of all preprojective modules itself (and dually, all preinjective modules) forms a tilting module, but they can be seen as boundaries rather than \"slices\" that cut through the middle of the quiver.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Canonical Tilting Modules\n\nThere are two canonical tilting modules for any hereditary algebra:\n1.  **The Projective Generator ($A$)**: $T_P = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$. Since $P_3=S_3$, this is $P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_3$. As all its direct summands are projective, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_P, T_P)=0$ trivially holds. Thus, $A$ is a tilting module. This corresponds to the set of all preprojective modules.\n\n2.  **The Injective Cogenerator ($DA$)**: $T_I = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3$. In our case, this is $S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1$. As all its direct summands are injective, $\\text{Ext}^1_A(\\text{any}, T_I)=0$. Thus, $T_I$ is a tilting module. This corresponds to the set of all preinjective modules.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the \"Slice\" Property\n\n*   The AR-quiver for $A$ has the preprojective modules $\\{P_1, P_2, S_3\\}$ on one side and the preinjective modules $\\{S_1, I_2, P_1\\}$ on the other.\n*   A \"slice\" is typically a set of modules that forms a path-closed, acyclic transversal of the AR quiver. A slice module is a tilting module built from such a slice.\n*   The set of preprojective modules $\\{P_1, P_2, S_3\\}$ forms a tilting module. Let's check if it forms a slice. A path $P_1 \\to P_2 \\to S_3$ exists and is contained in the set. However, a slice is meant to \"cut\" the quiver. The preprojective component itself is one entire \"half\" of the quiver, not a cut. Some definitions of slice explicitly exclude the trivial cases of the purely preprojective or purely preinjective tilting modules.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Unique Module\n\nThe question asks for a *unique* $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice.\n*   We have identified two candidates for \"non-slices\" in this specific sense: the projective generator $A$ and the injective cogenerator $DA$.\n*   However, the question implies uniqueness. This suggests there is a reason to single one of them out. The projective generator $A$ itself is the algebra we are working over. It is the most fundamental module, representing the regular representation. In many contexts of tilting theory, $A$ serves as the starting point (the trivial case) from which other, more interesting tilting modules (and tilted algebras) are derived. Therefore, it is the most natural candidate for the \"unique\" module that is set apart from the others, which are considered \"slices\".\n\nThe module is the projective generator $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$. Let's write its summands in terms of their standard representation notation.\n*   $P_1$: The representation corresponding to the interval $[1,3]$. It is $(\\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{id} \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{id} \\mathbb{C})$.\n*   $P_2$: The representation corresponding to the interval $[2,3]$. It is $(0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{id} \\mathbb{C})$.\n*   $P_3$: The representation corresponding to the interval $[3,3]$. It is $(0 \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{C})$, which is the simple module $S_3$.\n\nThus, the module is $P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_3$.\n\n<<<P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_3>>>"
