    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement\n\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nA new 8-point sequence, `y(n)`, is created by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\nThe objective is to find the **4-point DFT** of this 8-point sequence `y(n)`.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret \"4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence\"\n\nCalculating an `N`-point DFT of an `M`-point sequence where `N < M` (here, `N=4`, `M=8`) is a standard operation in digital signal processing. It involves two equivalent interpretations:\n\n**Interpretation A: Time-Domain Aliasing**\n1.  Create a 4-point sequence `z(n)` by \"wrapping and adding\" the 8-point sequence `y(n)`. This is also known as time-aliasing.\n    `z(n) = y(n) + y(n + 4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n2.  Calculate the 4-point DFT of this new sequence `z(n)`.\n\n**Interpretation B: Frequency-Domain Decimation**\n1.  Calculate the 8-point DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`, let's call it `Y(k)`.\n2.  The desired 4-point DFT, let's call it `Z(k)`, is obtained by taking every second sample of `Y(k)`.\n    `Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nBoth interpretations lead to the same result. Interpretation B is computationally more direct if we can find a relationship between `Y(k)` and the given `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to `X(k)` and `H(k)`\n\nThe interleaved sequence `y(n)` has its even-indexed terms formed by `x(n)` and odd-indexed terms formed by `h(n)`:\n*   Even part: `y(2n) = x(n)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n*   Odd part: `y(2n+1) = h(n)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\nThe 8-point DFT of `y(n)` can be expressed in terms of the 4-point DFTs of its even and odd parts using the decimation-in-time principle. The general formula is:\n`Y(k) = DFT_4{x(n)}[k \\mod 4] + W_8^k * DFT_4{h(n)}[k \\mod 4]`\nwhere `W_N^k = e^{-j2\\pi k/N}` is the DFT twiddle factor.\n\nSubstituting the given `X(k)` and `H(k)`, we get:\n`Y(k) = X(k \\mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k \\mod 4)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Required DFT Points\n\nWe need to find `Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`. This means we need to calculate `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\n\nFirst, let's determine the necessary twiddle factors:\n*   `W_8^0 = e^{-j0} = 1`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^{-j2\\pi(2)/8} = e^{-j\\pi/2} = -j`\n*   `W_8^4 = e^{-j2\\pi(4)/8} = e^{-j\\pi} = -1`\n*   `W_8^6 = e^{-j2\\pi(6)/8} = e^{-j3\\pi/2} = j`\n\nNow, let's calculate each point:\n\n*   **For Z(0):**\n    `Z(0) = Y(2*0) = Y(0) = X(0 \\mod 4) + W_8^0 * H(0 \\mod 4)`\n    `Z(0) = X(0) + (1) * H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **For Z(1):**\n    `Z(1) = Y(2*1) = Y(2) = X(2 \\mod 4) + W_8^2 * H(2 \\mod 4)`\n    `Z(1) = X(2) + (-j) * H(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **For Z(2):**\n    `Z(2) = Y(2*2) = Y(4) = X(4 \\mod 4) + W_8^4 * H(4 \\mod 4)`\n    `Z(2) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0) = 1 + (-1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **For Z(3):**\n    `Z(3) = Y(2*3) = Y(6) = X(6 \\mod 4) + W_8^6 * H(6 \\mod 4)`\n    `Z(3) = X(2) + (j) * H(2) = -1 + (j)(1) = -1 + j`\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\nCombining the results, the 4-point DFT of the sequence `{x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}` is:\n`Z(k) = [Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)]`\n\n`Z(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
