    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the core concepts:**\n    *   **Curve of genus 2:** A smooth projective algebraic curve of genus $g=2$. Its arithmetic genus is 2.\n    *   **Stable Reduction:** A process that extends a family of smooth curves over a punctured disk to a family over the whole disk, where the central fiber is a \"stable curve\".\n    *   **Stable Curve:** A complete, connected curve $C$ of arithmetic genus $g \\geq 2$ is stable if its only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes) and every rational component (a component isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$, i.e., of geometric genus 0) has at least 3 special points (nodes).\n    *   **The Question:** We are asked to find the number of different \"types\" of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. \"Type\" refers to the combinatorial structure: the number of components, their geometric genera, and how they are connected by nodes.\n\n2.  **Set up the combinatorial classification framework:**\n    Let $C$ be a stable curve of arithmetic genus $p_a(C) = 2$.\n    The arithmetic genus is given by the formula for a connected nodal curve:\n    $p_a(C) = \\delta - k + 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} g_i$\n    where:\n    *   $k$ is the number of irreducible components.\n    *   $g_i$ is the geometric genus of the $i$-th component.\n    *   $\\delta$ is the total number of nodes on the curve.\n\n    Substituting $p_a(C)=2$, we get the main equation:\n    $2 = \\delta - k + 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} g_i$\n\n    We must also satisfy the stability condition: for any component $C_i$ with $g_i=0$, the number of nodes on it, let's call it $n_i$, must be at least 3 ($n_i \\ge 3$).\n\n3.  **Analyze the number of components, k:**\n    We can prove that a stable curve of genus 2 can have at most 2 components. Let $k_0$ be the number of rational components ($g=0$) and $k_{\\ge 1}$ be the number of components with genus $\\ge 1$. Then $k=k_0+k_{\\ge 1}$. The sum of nodes on all components is $2\\delta = \\sum n_i$. From the stability and connectivity conditions, $\\sum n_i \\ge 3k_0 + k_{\\ge 1}$. Combining this with the genus formula leads to the inequality $k = k_0 + k_{\\ge 1} \\le 2$. Thus, we only need to check cases for $k=1$ and $k=2$.\n\n4.  **Case 1: $k = 1$ (Irreducible curves)**\n    The genus formula becomes $2 = \\delta - 1 + 1 + g_1 \\implies 2 = \\delta + g_1$.\n    *   **Subcase 1.1:** $g_1 = 2$ (geometric genus 2). This implies $\\delta = 0$. The curve is smooth. This is the case of \"good reduction\" and is a valid type of stable curve.\n        *   **Type 1:** A smooth, irreducible curve of genus 2.\n    *   **Subcase 1.2:** $g_1 = 1$ (geometric genus 1, i.e., an elliptic curve). This implies $\\delta = 1$. This is an elliptic curve with one node. The component is not rational, so the stability condition is trivially satisfied.\n        *   **Type 2:** An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node.\n    *   **Subcase 1.3:** $g_1 = 0$ (rational curve). This implies $\\delta=2$. A rational curve with 2 nodes is **not stable**, as it requires at least 3 nodes.\n\n5.  **Case 2: $k = 2$ (Two components)**\n    The genus formula becomes $2 = \\delta - 2 + 1 + g_1 + g_2 \\implies 3 = \\delta + g_1 + g_2$.\n    *   **Subcase 2.1:** $g_1 = 1, g_2 = 1$. This implies $\\delta = 1$. To be connected, the two elliptic components must be joined by this single node. Since the components are not rational, this configuration is stable.\n        *   **Type 3:** Two elliptic curves connected by one node.\n    *   **Subcase 2.2:** $g_1 = 1, g_2 = 0$. This implies $\\delta = 2$. We have an elliptic component ($C_1$) and a rational component ($C_2$). Stability requires the rational component $C_2$ to have at least 3 nodes ($n_2 \\ge 3$). The total number of node \"halves\" is $2\\delta = 4$. For $n_2$ to be 3, the elliptic component must have $n_1=1$. This unique configuration is stable: one node connects $C_1$ and $C_2$, and the second node is a self-node on $C_2$.\n        *   **Type 4:** An elliptic curve connected to a rational curve with one self-node.\n    *   **Subcase 2.3:** $g_1 = 0, g_2 = 0$. This implies $\\delta=3$. Both components are rational and require at least 3 nodes each ($n_1 \\ge 3, n_2 \\ge 3$). The sum of nodes on the components is $n_1 + n_2 = 2\\delta = 6$. The only way to satisfy this is if $n_1 = 3$ and $n_2 = 3$. We can then solve for the distribution of the 3 nodes:\n        *   Possibility (a): One node connects the two components, and each component has one self-node. This satisfies $n_1=3$ and $n_2=3$.\n            *   **Type 5:** Two rational curves, each with one self-node, connected to each other by a third node.\n        *   Possibility (b): All three nodes connect the two components. This also satisfies $n_1=3$ and $n_2=3$.\n            *   **Type 6:** Two rational curves connected to each other by three nodes.\n\n6.  **Summarize and Count:**\n    The systematic analysis yields 6 distinct combinatorial types of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2.\n\n    1.  A smooth curve of genus 2.\n    2.  An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node.\n    3.  Two elliptic curves attached at one node.\n    4.  An elliptic curve attached to a rational curve with a node.\n    5.  Two rational curves, each with a node, attached at a third node.\n    6.  Two rational curves attached at three nodes.\n\n    Each of these represents a different type of stable reduction. Therefore, there are 6 different types."
