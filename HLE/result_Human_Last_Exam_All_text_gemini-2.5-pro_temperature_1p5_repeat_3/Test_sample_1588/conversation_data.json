    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z$ in the equation $e^X e^Y = e^Z$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting elements of a Lie algebra. The formula for $Z$ is an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$:\n$Z = X + Y + \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y] + \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] - \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [X, Y]] + \\dots$\nThe \"order\" (or degree) of a term is the total count of $X$'s and $Y$'s within it. For example, $[X, [X, Y]]$ is an order 3 term.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the Question to the Free Lie Algebra\nThe collection of all terms of a given order $n$ in the BCH expansion spans a vector space. This vector space is precisely the $n$-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, $X$ and $Y$. Let's denote this component as $L_n(X, Y)$.\n\nA crucial point is that in the BCH formula, every basis element of $L_n(X, Y)$ appears with a non-zero rational coefficient. Therefore, the \"number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\" is equivalent to the dimension of the vector space $L_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\n### Step 3: Using Witt's Formula to Find the Dimension\nThe dimension of the $n$-th component of a free Lie algebra on $d$ generators is given by Witt's formula:\n$$ \\text{dim}(L_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k|n} \\mu(k) d^{n/k} $$\nHere:\n*   $n$ is the order (degree) of the terms.\n*   $d$ is the number of generators.\n*   The sum is over all positive integers $k$ that divide $n$.\n*   $\\mu(k)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n### Step 4: Applying Witt's Formula to Our Specific Problem\nIn our case, we need to find the number of coefficients of order 10.\n*   The order is $n = 10$.\n*   The generators are $X$ and $Y$, so $d = 2$.\n\nWe need to calculate:\n$$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{k|10} \\mu(k) 2^{10/k} $$\n\n### Step 5: Detailed Calculation\nFirst, we list the divisors of $n=10$ and find their corresponding Möbius function values.\n\n*   **Divisors of 10:** The divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n*   **Möbius function, $\\mu(k)$:**\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (since 2 is a single prime)\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (since 5 is a single prime)\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (since 10 is the product of two distinct primes)\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into Witt's formula:\n$$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} + \\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} + \\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} + \\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} \\right] $$\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n$$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} + (1) \\cdot 2^{1} \\right] $$\n\nNext, calculate the powers of 2:\n*   $2^{10} = 1024$\n*   $2^5 = 32$\n*   $2^2 = 4$\n*   $2^1 = 2$\n\nSubstitute these results back into the equation:\n$$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2] $$\n\nFinally, perform the arithmetic:\n$$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [990] $$\n$$ \\text{dim}(L_{10}) = 99 $$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the 10th-degree component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, which is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
