    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core objects**\n\n*   **Great Icosahedron:** This is a non-convex regular polyhedron, one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra. It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangles. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges. The key feature is that its faces pass through its interior.\n*   **Outer-hull:** This term refers to the convex hull of the polyhedron. The convex hull of a set of points (like the vertices of a polyhedron) is the smallest convex shape that contains all the points. For a non-convex object, its convex hull is the shape you would get if you stretched a rubber sheet over it.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the outer-hull of the great icosahedron**\n\n*   The 12 vertices of the great icosahedron are located at the same positions as the 12 vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n*   Since the convex hull is determined by the outermost points (the vertices), the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the triangulation requirement**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull\".\n*   This means we need to cover the surface of the outer-hull (which we've established is a regular icosahedron) with triangles.\n*   The phrase \"visible triangles from the outside\" reinforces that we are only concerned with the surface of the convex hull.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the surface of the outer-hull (the regular icosahedron)**\n\n*   A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose surface is already made up of triangles.\n*   Specifically, a regular icosahedron has exactly 20 faces, and each face is an equilateral triangle.\n*   Since the surface is already perfectly tiled by triangles, the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating\" it is simply the number of faces it already has. We cannot use fewer triangles to form the same closed surface.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final number**\n\n*   The outer-hull is a regular icosahedron.\n*   A regular icosahedron has 20 triangular faces.\n*   Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed to form its surface is 20.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Distinction:** It's crucial not to confuse the 20 intersecting faces of the great icosahedron itself with the 20 non-intersecting faces of its outer-hull. The question is about the hull.\n*   **\"Minimal Triangulation\":** The term \"triangulation\" can sometimes imply subdividing larger faces into triangles. However, since the faces of the icosahedron are already triangles, no subdivision is necessary. The minimal number is simply the count of these existing triangular faces.\n*   **Visualizing:** Imagine the great icosahedron with its spiky vertices. If you were to \"shrink-wrap\" it, the resulting shape would be the smooth, convex regular icosahedron. The question asks how many triangles make up the surface of that shrink-wrapped shape.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n1.  Identify the object: Great Icosahedron.\n2.  Determine its outer-hull: Regular Icosahedron.\n3.  Count the faces of the regular icosahedron: 20.\n4.  Since the faces are triangles, this is the minimal number for triangulation.\n\nThe final answer is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
