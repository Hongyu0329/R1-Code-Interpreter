    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the title of a specific \"book of manners\" that was physically located next to the poem \"Sir Launfal\" in its original manuscript.\n2.  **Identify \"Sir Launfal\":** The work in question is the Middle English romance poem *Sir Launfal*, written by Thomas Chestre around the late 14th century.\n3.  **Determine How It Was \"Preserved\":** The phrase \"preserved alongside\" refers to the specific physical manuscript in which the poem has survived to the present day. Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal* is famously preserved in a single manuscript.\n4.  **Identify the Manuscript:** The sole surviving manuscript containing *Sir Launfal* is **British Library MS Cotton Caligula A.ii**. This is a collection of various texts compiled in the mid-15th century.\n5.  **Examine the Manuscript's Contents:** To find the \"book of manners,\" we must look at the other texts included in this specific manuscript. MS Cotton Caligula A.ii contains several romances and didactic works.\n6.  **Locate the \"Book of Manners\":** Within this manuscript, alongside romances like *Sir Launfal* and *Libeaus Desconus*, there is a didactic poem focused on etiquette, courtesy, and proper behavior for a young man serving in a noble household. This text perfectly fits the description of a \"book of manners.\"\n7.  **Identify the Title:** The name of this instructional poem on etiquette is ***The Boke of Curtasye*** (often modernized as *The Book of Courtesy*).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Specificity of the Text:** It is crucial to identify the correct \"Sir Launfal\" (Thomas Chestre's version) as its preservation history is unique.\n*   **Manuscript Context:** The question is not about thematic links but about physical proximity in a historical document. The answer depends entirely on the contents of the specific codex (manuscript book).\n*   **Identifying the Manuscript:** Correctly identifying the manuscript as Cotton Caligula A.ii is the key to finding the other texts it contains.\n*   **Defining \"Book of Manners\":** In the medieval context, a \"book of manners\" was often a poem on \"courtesy\" or \"nurture,\" providing instruction on social conduct. *The Boke of Curtasye* is a prime example of this genre.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\nBased on the analysis, the poem *Sir Launfal* is preserved in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii. This same manuscript also contains the instructional poem on etiquette, *The Boke of Curtasye*. Therefore, *The Boke of Curtasye* is the book of manners that Sir Launfal was preserved alongside.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
