    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Musical Terms in the Question:**\n    *   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the foundational or \"home\" chord of a song's key. For example, in the key of G major, the tonic chord is G major.\n    *   **Fifth Chord (V):** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. It is also known as the dominant chord. In the key of G major, the fifth note is D, making the V chord D major.\n    *   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is a variation where the fifth chord, which is normally major in a major key, is made minor. This is done by lowering the third of the chord. In our G major example, the D major chord (D-F#-A) would become a D minor chord (D-F-A). This is a common device known as \"modal interchange\" or \"borrowing\" a chord from the parallel minor key (in this case, G minor).\n    *   **Chord Jump:** This implies a direct and distinct movement from one chord to the next, especially at the very start of the song.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Core Task:**\n    The goal is to find a Beatles song that opens with the specific chord progression of I → v (a major tonic chord moving directly to a minor dominant chord).\n\n3.  **Analyze Candidate Beatles Songs:**\n    We must examine the introductions of famous Beatles songs to see if they match this pattern.\n    *   \"A Hard Day's Night\": Starts with a famously debated, dissonant Gsus4/F chord. Does not fit.\n    *   \"Help!\": The key is A major. The opening vocal section starts on B minor (the ii chord). Does not fit.\n    *   \"Ticket to Ride\": The key is A major. The song starts with a guitar riff over the A major chord (the tonic), but it doesn't jump to a minor fifth. Does not fit.\n\n4.  **Identify the Correct Song: \"Michelle\"**\n    *   **Key:** The introduction and chorus of \"Michelle\" are centered around the key of F major.\n    *   **Tonic (I):** In the key of F major, the tonic chord (I) is **F major**.\n    *   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** The fifth note of the F major scale is C. The standard dominant V chord would be C major. The \"minor fifth\" chord (v) would therefore be **C minor**.\n    *   **Analysis of the Intro:** \"Michelle\" begins with a memorable instrumental guitar passage. The very first chord played is F major (the tonic). This is immediately followed by a clear \"jump\" to a C minor chord (the minor fifth).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The opening progression of \"Michelle\" is F major → C minor, which is a perfect example of a I → v progression.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Clarity of the progression:** The I → v harmonic move is the defining feature of the introduction to \"Michelle,\" making it a clear and unambiguous answer.\n*   **Interpretation of \"minor fifth\":** The most standard musical interpretation is the minor dominant (v), not a chord built on a flatted fifth degree.\n*   **Alternative Answer:** The song \"I Me Mine\" starts with a progression of A minor → E minor. In the key of A minor, this is a i → v progression (minor tonic to minor dominant). While it technically fits the description, the progression in \"Michelle\" (major tonic to minor dominant) is a more classic example of the specific harmonic color change implied by the question and is a more famous musical introduction.\n\nBased on this analysis, \"Michelle\" is the strongest and most accurate answer.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
