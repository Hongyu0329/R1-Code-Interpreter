    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Protagonist:** Fernand Braudel, a historian known for a global perspective.\n    *   **Source:** A quote from another author, Paul Morand.\n    *   **The Quote's Idea:** A certain \"conceptual entity\" must be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   **The Metaphor:** The \"sphere\" represents the globe, or a world-system, aligning with Braudel's global perspective.\n    *   **The Example:** This entity is exemplified by a nation (like France, in the original quote).\n    *   **The Goal:** Identify this specific \"conceptual entity.\"\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** The quote is found in Fernand Braudel's major work, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*, specifically in the third volume, *The Perspective of the World*.\n\n3.  **Examine the Quote in Context:** Braudel introduces the concept of the \"world-economy\" (*économie-monde*). To illustrate that national histories are insufficient on their own, he brings up Paul Morand's statement. The actual passage reads (in translation):\n    > \"Paul Morand once wrote: 'The history of France must from now on be inscribed within a sphere.' The same goes for the **economic history** of France and a fortiori for that of any other country.\"\n\n4.  **Analyze Braudel's Interpretation:**\n    *   Paul Morand's original assertion was about \"the history of France.\"\n    *   Braudel immediately takes this idea and applies it specifically to his own field of study. He states that Morand's principle—viewing a national story within a global context—is precisely what must be done for **economic history**.\n    *   He argues that the economic history of a single nation (the \"symbol of a nation\" mentioned in your question) is meaningless unless it is understood as part of a larger, interconnected global system (the \"sphere\").\n\n5.  **Identify the Conceptual Entity:** Based on Braudel's explicit application of the quote, the \"conceptual entity\" he is referring to is **economic history**. He uses Morand's words as a launching point to argue that one cannot study the economy of a single nation in isolation; it must be situated within the world-economy.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Attribution:** The core idea of being \"inscribed within a sphere\" originates with Paul Morand, but the specific application and conceptual entity in question is Braudel's. The question asks what entity Braudel was emphasizing.\n*   **Braudel's Agenda:** Braudel's entire project was to move beyond event-based, nation-centric history towards a history of large-scale structures and long-term trends (*longue durée*), such as the global capitalist system. This quote perfectly serves his purpose.\n*   **The Specific vs. The General:** Morand speaks of \"the history of France.\" Braudel generalizes this to the \"economic history of France\" and then further to the \"economic history...of any other country.\" The entity is the *field of study itself*.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that when Fernand Braudel quoted Paul Morand, he was using the idea to make a specific point about the necessity of studying **economic history** from a global, rather than a national, perspective. Therefore, economic history is the conceptual entity.\n\n<<<Economic history>>>"
