    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for a specific novel identified by three key pieces of information:\n    *   **The Critic:** The quote is from Jorge Luis Borges.\n    *   **Description of the Author:** The author is described as \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n    *   **Description of the Novel:** The novel has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Author\" Clue:**\n    *   Jorge Luis Borges was a great admirer of William Faulkner but also found his style dense and complex.\n    *   The description \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" points to an author who works within the same tradition as Faulkner (likely Southern Gothic) but with a more direct, concise, or focused style.\n    *   This clue strongly suggests the American author **Flannery O'Connor**. She is a major figure in the Southern Gothic genre, and critics frequently compare her work to Faulkner's, often noting her tighter, more focused narrative structures. Borges himself wrote a prologue for a collection of her work.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Novel\" Clue:**\n    *   **\"The intensity of a tiger\"**: This suggests a work of raw, primal power, ferocity, and perhaps violence. It speaks to the visceral impact of the story.\n    *   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\"**: This suggests a work that is highly structured, strategic, and intellectually rigorous. Every element of the plot is carefully placed, like a move in a chess game, leading to a complex but logical conclusion.\n    *   The combination of these two phrases points to a novel that is both violently emotional and meticulously constructed.\n\n4.  **Connecting the Clues:**\n    *   The specific quotes come from a prologue that Jorge Luis Borges wrote for the Spanish edition of a Flannery O'Connor novel.\n    *   The novel in question is **_The Violent Bear It Away_**.\n    *   This novel perfectly fits the descriptions. It tells the story of the young protagonist, Francis Marion Tarwater, who struggles violently with his religious destiny, embodying the \"intensity of a tiger.\" The plot is a tightly woven intellectual and spiritual \"chess duel\" between Tarwater, his fanatical great-uncle's teachings, and the secular rationalism of his schoolteacher uncle, Rayber.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Source of the Quote:** It's crucial to correctly attribute the quote to Borges's critical writings, specifically his prologue to the novel. This confirms the connection.\n*   **Context of the Comparison to Faulkner:** Understanding why O'Connor is seen as a \"simplifier\" of Faulkner is key. While both wrote about the American South with a focus on sin, grace, and decay, O'Connor's prose is generally more direct and her plots more allegorically clear-cut than Faulkner's sprawling, multi-perspective epics.\n*   **Meaning of the Metaphors:** The \"tiger\" and \"chess\" metaphors must be understood together. The novel is not just a violent story nor just a cold intellectual exercise; it is the synthesis of both, which is what Borges found so remarkable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy combining the clues, we can confidently identify the author as Flannery O'Connor and the specific novel praised by Borges as *The Violent Bear It Away*.\n\n<<<The Violent Bear It Away>>>"
