Yes. The Generality Constraint (GC) requires that to understand a proposition like `Fa`, one must possess the constituent concepts `F` and `a` as reusable components. Possessing the concept of the property `F` means one can think of it in relation to other objects (`Fb`, `Fc`, etc.). If one also possesses the concept of universal quantification (`∀`), which is a logical operator that applies to properties, the principle of conceptual recombination central to the GC dictates that one must be able to combine the possessed concept `F` with the possessed concept `∀`. The resulting thought is `∀x Fx`. Therefore, the ability to understand `Fa` and `∀` implies the ability to understand `∀x Fx`.
