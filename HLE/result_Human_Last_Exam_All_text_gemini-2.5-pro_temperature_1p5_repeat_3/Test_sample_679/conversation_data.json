    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n    *   We calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to determine the number of rings and/or double bonds.\n    *   DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1.\n    *   A DBE of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   The problem provides six distinct signals with their chemical shifts (in ppm) and multiplicities. The multiplicities (s, d, t, q) tell us the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon:\n        *   s = singlet (quaternary C, 0 H)\n        *   t = triplet (CH$_2$, 2 H)\n        *   d = doublet (CH, 1 H)\n        *   q = quartet (CH$_3$, 3 H)\n    *   The given signals are:\n        *   **145(s):** A quaternary carbon (C). Its chemical shift (>100 ppm) indicates it's an $sp^2$ carbon, part of an alkene (C=C).\n        *   **112(t):** A CH$_2$ group. Its chemical shift (>100 ppm) also indicates it's an $sp^2$ carbon from an alkene.\n        *   **48(t):** An aliphatic CH$_2$ group ($sp^3$).\n        *   **27(d):** An aliphatic CH group ($sp^3$).\n        *   **22(q):** An aliphatic CH$_3$ group ($sp^3$).\n        *   **21(q):** An aliphatic CH$_3$ group ($sp^3$).\n    *   The presence of two signals in the alkene region (145 ppm and 112 ppm) confirms that the DBE of 1 is due to a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n3.  **Determine the Full Carbon and Hydrogen Inventory:**\n    *   The molecular formula has 7 carbons, but only 6 signals are given. The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" suggests that one signal represents two chemically equivalent carbons.\n    *   Let's check which type of carbon could be doubled-up to match the molecular formula $C_7H_{14}$. We need to find a combination that gives 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens.\n    *   Let's assume one of the quartet (q) signals represents two equivalent CH$_3$ groups.\n        *   **Carbon count:** 1(s) + 1(t) + 1(t) + 1(d) + 2(q) + 1(q) = 7 carbons. This matches.\n        *   **Hydrogen count:** 0 (from C) + 2 (from CH$_2$) + 2 (from CH$_2$) + 1 (from CH) + (2 Ã— 3) (from 2 equiv. CH$_3$) + 3 (from 1 CH$_3$) = 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 3 = 14 hydrogens. This also matches.\n    *   Therefore, the molecule must be composed of the following pieces:\n        *   One quaternary carbon (C).\n        *   Two CH$_2$ groups.\n        *   One CH group.\n        *   Three CH$_3$ groups, two of which must be chemically equivalent.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   The two alkene carbons (145s and 112t) form a disubstituted terminal alkene group: `R1,R2-C=CH2`.\n    *   The requirement of two equivalent CH$_3$ groups and one CH group strongly suggests the presence of an isopropyl group, `(CH3)2CH-`. The two methyls in an isopropyl group are equivalent as long as the rest of the molecule attached to the CH group is achiral.\n    *   The remaining aliphatic fragments are one CH$_2$ group and one CH$_3$ group, which form an ethyl group, `-CH2CH3`.\n    *   Now, we need to attach the isopropyl group and the ethyl group to the quaternary carbon of our `>C=CH2` fragment.\n    *   This gives the following structure:\n        ```\n              CH(CH3)2\n             /\n            C = CH2\n           /\n          CH2CH3\n        ```\n    *   Let's verify this structure against our data.\n        *   It contains a quaternary carbon (`=C<`, s), an alkene CH$_2$ (`=CH2`, t), an aliphatic CH$_2$ (from ethyl, t), a CH group (from isopropyl, d), and three CH$_3$ groups.\n        *   **Equivalence Check:** Is the molecule chiral? No. There are no chiral centers. Therefore, the two methyl groups of the isopropyl substituent are chemically equivalent, and the third methyl (from the ethyl group) is in a different environment. This results in two distinct CH$_3$ signals (one for 2C, one for 1C), which perfectly matches our analysis.\n        *   **Signal Assignment:**\n            *   `=C<`: 145(s)\n            *   `=CH2`: 112(t)\n            *   `-CH2CH3`: 48(t)\n            *   `-CH(CH3)2`: 27(d)\n            *   The two remaining signals, 22(q) and 21(q), correspond to the two equivalent methyls of the isopropyl group and the single methyl of the ethyl group.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The structure is `(CH3)2CH-C(CH2CH3)=CH2`.\n    *   To find the IUPAC name, we must find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    *   Path 1: `CH2=C-CH2-CH3`. This is a 4-carbon chain (1-butene) with an isopropyl group at position 2. Name: `2-isopropyl-1-butene`. (1 substituent).\n    *   Path 2: `CH2=C-CH(CH3)-CH3`. This is also a 4-carbon chain (a `3-methyl-1-butene` chain) with an ethyl group at position 2. Name: `2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene`. (2 substituents).\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, when two chains of equal length are possible, we choose the one with the greater number of substituents.\n    *   Therefore, Path 2 is preferred, and the correct IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene>>>"
