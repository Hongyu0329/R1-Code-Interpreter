    "This question asks to identify a classical ballet step from the given options where the final leg position is identical to the starting leg position. This means that if the step begins in fifth position with the right foot in front, it must also end in fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\nLet's analyze each step:\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically, fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Movement:** This is a vertical jump from two feet where the legs beat six times (which corresponds to three changes of position in the air). The sequence is: open, beat back, beat front, beat back, open, close.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in fifth position, but the feet have switched. The foot that started in front is now in the back (e.g., left foot in front). Even-numbered entrechats that start and end on two feet (like quatre, six, huit) always change the feet.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Movement:** *Échappé* means \"to escape,\" so the dancer jumps from fifth position to second position. *Battu* means \"beaten,\" indicating the legs beat as they return to fifth. *Changé* means \"changed.\"\n*   **Ending Position:** The word *changé* explicitly states that the feet change position. The dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Movement:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" One foot brushes out, the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and the legs are brought together (\"assembled\") in the air before landing on both feet simultaneously in fifth position. There are many types of assemblé:\n    *   *Assemblé dessus* (over): The working leg (e.g., the back leg) brushes out and closes in front. This changes the feet.\n    *   *Assemblé dessous* (under): The working leg (e.g., the front leg) brushes out and closes in the back. This changes the feet.\n    *   However, an *assemblé devant* where the front foot brushes forward and returns to the front does not change the feet. Similarly, an *assemblé derrière* where the back foot brushes backward and returns to the back does not change the feet.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since some common types of *assemblé* change the feet while others do not, the term \"Assemblé\" by itself is ambiguous. But it is possible for an assemblé not to change. We need to evaluate if other options are more definitively correct.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Movement:** *Glissade* is a gliding step. From fifth, the dancer glides the back foot out, transfers weight, and then closes the other foot. *Derrière* means \"behind.\" This specifies that the foot that started in front (the right foot) closes *behind* the other foot.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Movement:** This is a complex, decorative jumping step. It is essentially a *pas de chat* with an added *rond de jambe* for each leg. The foot that starts in front (right foot) is picked up and performs a small circle in the air (*rond de jambe en l'air*) as the dancer jumps. The dancer lands on that same foot (the right foot) and then the other foot (the left foot) closes behind it into fifth position.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer finishes in the same fifth position they started in (e.g., right foot in front). The fundamental mechanics of the step, across major ballet schools (Vaganova, Cecchetti, French), involve returning to the original foot position.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position is the same as the starting position.\n\n**Final Comparison:**\n\n*   Steps A, B, and D definitively change the starting leg position.\n*   Step C (*Assemblé*) can either change or not change, depending on the specific type performed. The most common classroom versions (*dessus* and *dessous*) do change the feet.\n*   Step E (*Gargouillade*) is a specific step whose definition and execution inherently lead to the feet returning to their original starting position.\n\nTherefore, *Gargouillade* is the most accurate and unambiguous answer among the choices.\n\n<<<E>>>"
