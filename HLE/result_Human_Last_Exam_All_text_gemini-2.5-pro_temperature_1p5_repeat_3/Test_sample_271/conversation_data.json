    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Factor the polynomial**\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe try to find a common factor for groups of terms.\nLet's rearrange the terms:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\nFactor out common terms from each group:\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nNow, factor out the common term $(x^2 - 2)$:\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nSo the polynomial $f(x)$ is a product of two polynomials, let $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$.\n\n**2. Analyze the factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n*   The polynomial $h(x) = x^2 - 2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$, or simply because its roots $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$ are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The splitting field of $h(x)$ is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with degree $[K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]=2$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2).\n\n*   The polynomial $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3. All other coefficients (0, 0, -9, 3) are divisible by 3. The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$. Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible.\n\n**3. Determine the Galois group of $g(x)$**\nLet $K_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$. The Galois group $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_5$. Since $g(x)$ is irreducible of degree 5, $G_g$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\n\nTo determine which subgroup it is, we find the number of real roots of $g(x)$. We use calculus:\n$g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\nLet's evaluate $g(x)$ at these critical points:\n$x_0 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. The local minimum value is $g(x_0) = (\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 - 9(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) + 3 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}( (9/5) - 9) + 3 = 3 - \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. Since $\\sqrt[4]{9/5} = \\sqrt[4]{1.8} > \\sqrt[4]{1}=1$, we have $g(x_0) < 3 - 36/5 = 3 - 7.2 = -4.2 < 0$.\nThe local maximum value is $g(-x_0) = 3 + \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 0$.\nSince the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has three real roots. The other two roots must be a complex conjugate pair.\n\nA theorem in Galois theory states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group is the full symmetric group $S_p$.\nHere $p=5$, so the Galois group $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ is $S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**4. Determine the Galois group of $f(x)$**\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields $K_g$ and $K_h$. So, $K = K_g K_h = K_g(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ fits into the following relation:\n$G \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$ if and only if $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nLet's check the intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This intersection is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so it can only be $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subseteq K_g$.\nThe Galois group of $K_g$ is $S_5$. The subgroups of $S_5$ correspond to subfields of $K_g$. The only subgroup of index 2 in $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, $K_g$ contains a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$, where $\\Delta_g$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1}+(-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1} a^n)$.\nFor $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$\\Delta_g = (-1)^{10} (5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 4^4 (-9)^5) = 5^5 \\cdot 3^4 - 4^4 \\cdot 9^5 = 3^4(5^5 - 4^4 \\cdot 9^3) = 81(3125 - 256 \\cdot 729) = 81(3125 - 186624) = 81(-183499)$.\nSince $\\Delta_g < 0$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$ is an imaginary quadratic field.\nOn the other hand, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which implies $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\not\\subseteq K_g$.\nSo, the intersection is trivial: $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis confirms that the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong G_g \\times G_h \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe order of the group is $|G| = |S_5| \\times |C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n**5. Find possible degrees of normal sub-extensions**\nWe are looking for the degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between intermediate fields $L$ and subgroups of $G$. Furthermore, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension if and only if the corresponding subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$ and compute their indices.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ include subgroups of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\triangleleft G_1$ and $N_2 \\triangleleft G_2$. Also, because $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$, there exist other \"diagonal\" normal subgroups.\n\nLet's list the normal subgroups $H \\triangleleft S_5 \\times C_2$ and their indices:\n1.  **Product-type subgroups:** $H = N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\in \\{\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5\\}$ and $N_2 \\in \\{\\{e\\}, C_2\\}$. We exclude $H = \\{e\\}\\times\\{e\\}$ (trivial subgroup) and $H=S_5 \\times C_2$ (the whole group).\n    *   $H_1 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_1|=60$. $[G:H_1] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_2 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_2|=120$. $[G:H_2] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$. $|H_3|=2$. $[G:H_3] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_4 = A_5 \\times C_2$. $|H_4|=60 \\times 2 = 120$. $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **Diagonal-type subgroups:** These arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of normal subgroups. The only non-trivial possibility is an isomorphism $\\phi: S_5/A_5 \\to C_2/\\{e\\}$. Let sgn: $S_5 \\to C_2$ be the sign homomorphism (which has kernel $A_5$).\n    *   $H_5 = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(g) = c\\}$. This is a normal subgroup of $S_5 \\times C_2$. Its order is $|H_5| = |S_5| = 120$.\n    *   The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThese are all the proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$.\n\n**6. List the possible degrees**\nThe possible degrees of the normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the indices we have calculated.\nThe set of indices is $\\{4, 2, 120, 2, 2\\}$.\nCollecting the unique values, the possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nFinal list of careful points:\n*   The factorization of the polynomial is the crucial first step. It simplifies the problem immensely.\n*   Confirming the irreducibility of factors is necessary to determine the structure of the extension.\n*   Determining the Galois group of the quintic factor $g(x)$ requires analyzing its number of real roots.\n*   Establishing that the Galois group of $f(x)$ is a direct product requires checking that the splitting fields have a trivial intersection. This depends on identifying the unique quadratic subfield of $K_g$.\n*   A complete classification of the normal subgroups of the direct product group $S_5 \\times C_2$ is required. One must not forget the diagonal-type subgroups.\n*   The degree of a normal sub-extension corresponds to the index of the corresponding normal subgroup.\n\nThe analysis has covered these points and leads to a definitive set of possible degrees.\n\nThe possible degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
