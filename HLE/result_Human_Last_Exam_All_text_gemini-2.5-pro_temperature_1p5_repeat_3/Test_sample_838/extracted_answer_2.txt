The final product C is (4-bromobutyl)benzene, also named 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane. The product is achiral because the original chiral center in the starting material, [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, was destroyed in the first step of the synthesis (E2 elimination to form an alkene), and no new chiral centers were formed in the subsequent steps.
