    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the range of verses mentioning the names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Question:** The core of the question is to find the exact starting and ending verses (*abyat*) in Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', where the names of the 25 prophets are listed.\n\n2.  **Locate the Relevant Section:** The poem is structured to cover the pillars of Islamic faith. After discussing the attributes of Allah, it moves on to the belief in His Messengers (Prophets). The author first discusses their necessary, possible, and impossible attributes in general terms.\n\n3.  **Find the Introductory Verse:** Before listing the names, the author signals his intent to do so. This is a crucial marker for finding the start of the section.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must distinguish between the verse that *introduces* the list and the verse where the list *actually begins*.\n    *   **Bayt 32** is the introductory verse. It states:\n        > تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ  \n        > كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n        *Translation: The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding, upon every legally responsible person, so ascertain this and seize the opportunity.*\n    *   This verse (32) announces that the list of 25 prophets is forthcoming, but does not contain any names itself.\n\n4.  **Find the First Verse with Names:** The enumeration of the names begins immediately in the following verse.\n    *   **Bayt 33** is the first verse that contains the prophets' names. It states:\n        > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ  \n        > صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n        *Translation: They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud with Salih, and Ibrahim—each is to be followed.*\n    *   Therefore, the listing of the names begins at **bayt 33**.\n\n5.  **Trace the List to its Conclusion:** We now need to follow the list of names until the last one is mentioned.\n    *   **Bayt 34** continues the list: Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 35** continues the list: Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n    *   **Bayt 36** contains the final names in the list:\n        > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى  \n        > عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n        *Translation: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa (Jesus), and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the Seal—leave misguidance.*\n    *   This verse concludes the list of the 25 prophets.\n\n6.  **Find the Concluding Verse:** The verse immediately following the list provides a salutation upon them, which acts as a conclusion to this specific section.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The question asks where the *names* are mentioned. The concluding verse of salutation (bayt 37) does not contain names but is directly related to the list.\n    *   **Bayt 37**:\n        > عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ  \n        > وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n        *Translation: Upon them be blessings and peace, and upon their families, as long as the days endure.*\n\n7.  **Final Determination of the Range:**\n    *   The introduction to the topic is in bayt 32.\n    *   The listing of the actual names begins in **bayt 33**.\n    *   The listing of the actual names ends in **bayt 36**.\n    *   The section is concluded with a salutation in bayt 37.\n\nTherefore, the specific verses that contain the names of the prophets are from bayt 33 to bayt 36.\n\n***\n\n<<<From bayt (verse) 33 to bayt 36.>>>"
