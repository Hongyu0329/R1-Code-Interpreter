    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{4n}$):** The generalized quaternion group of order $4n$ is defined by the presentation:\n    $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **The Group in Question:** We are given a group of size 128. So, $4n = 128$, which implies $n = 32$. The group is $Q_{128}$ with the presentation:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an element $g \\in G$ such that $H$ is the cyclic subgroup generated by $g$, i.e., $H = \\langle g \\rangle$. The question is asking for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n**2. Partition the Elements of the Group**\n\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be divided into two disjoint sets:\n1.  The elements of the form $x^k$ for $0 \\le k < 64$. These form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64. There are 64 such elements.\n2.  The elements of the form $yx^k$ for $0 \\le k < 64$. There are 64 such elements.\n\nWe will find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements from each set.\n\n**3. Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Elements of the Form $x^k$**\n\nThese are the subgroups of the cyclic group $\\langle x \\rangle$, which has order 64.\nA fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that a cyclic group of order $m$ has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$.\n*   The order of $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $m=64$.\n*   We need to find the number of divisors of 64. Since $64 = 2^6$, the number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1=7$.\n*   The divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.\n*   For each of these divisors $d$, there is exactly one cyclic subgroup of order $d$, which is $\\langle x^{64/d} \\rangle$.\n\nTherefore, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**4. Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Elements of the Form $yx^k$**\n\nFirst, let's determine the order of an element $g = yx^k$.\n*   Let's compute $g^2$:\n    $g^2 = (yx^k)^2 = yx^k yx^k$\n*   From the relation $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}$, we can derive $xy = yx^{-1}$ and more generally $x^k y = yx^{-k}$.\n*   Substituting this into the expression for $g^2$:\n    $g^2 = y(x^k y)x^k = y(yx^{-k})x^k = y^2 x^{-k} x^k = y^2$\n*   From the group presentation, we have $y^2 = x^{32}$.\n*   So, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\n*   The element $x^{32}$ is not the identity, since its order is $o(x^{32}) = \\frac{64}{\\gcd(32, 64)} = \\frac{64}{32} = 2$.\n*   Now let's compute $g^4$:\n    $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   Since $g^2 \\ne 1$ and $g^4 = 1$, the order of any element of the form $yx^k$ is exactly 4.\n\nNow, we need to count how many distinct cyclic subgroups are generated by these 64 elements of order 4.\n*   Let $H_k = \\langle yx^k \\rangle$ be the cyclic subgroup generated by $yx^k$.\n*   Any cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators. The generators of $H_k$ are $yx^k$ and $(yx^k)^3$.\n*   Let's find an expression for $(yx^k)^3$:\n    $(yx^k)^3 = (yx^k)^2 (yx^k) = x^{32}(yx^k)$.\n    The element $x^{32}$ is in the center of the group $Q_{128}$ (since $y^{-1}x^{32}y = (y^{-1}xy)^{32} = (x^{-1})^{32} = x^{-32}$ and $x^{-32}=x^{32}$ in a group of order 64), so it commutes with $y$.\n    Thus, $x^{32} yx^k = yx^{32}x^k = yx^{k+32}$.\n*   So the two generators of the subgroup $H_k = \\langle yx^k \\rangle$ are $yx^k$ and $yx^{k+32 \\pmod{64}}$.\n*   This means that for any $k$, the subgroups $\\langle yx^k \\rangle$ and $\\langle yx^{k+32} \\rangle$ are identical.\n*   We have 64 elements of the form $yx^k$, and they are paired up (e.g., $yx^0$ and $yx^{32}$, $yx^1$ and $yx^{33}$, etc.) to generate the same subgroup.\n*   The number of distinct subgroups is the total number of generators divided by the number of generators per subgroup: $64 / 2 = 32$.\n\nTherefore, there are **32** distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $yx^k$.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is the sum of the counts from the two disjoint sets of generators.\n*   Cyclic subgroups within $\\langle x \\rangle$: 7\n*   Cyclic subgroups not within $\\langle x \\rangle$: 32\n\nThese two sets of subgroups are distinct because the second set contains elements not found in the first set.\nTotal number of power subgroups = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
