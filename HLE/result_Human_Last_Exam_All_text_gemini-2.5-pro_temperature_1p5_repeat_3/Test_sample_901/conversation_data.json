    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). This is a polar protic solvent, commonly used for elimination reactions with t-BuOK.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide and a strong, bulky base strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Substrate**\n*   For 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexanes, the (1S,2R) or (1R,2S) designation indicates a *cis* relationship between the two substituents. The bromo group and the methyl group are on the same face of the ring.\n*   A cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformers where one substituent is axial and the other is equatorial.\n\n**Step 3: Draw and Analyze the Chair Conformers**\nThe two possible chair conformers for cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane are:\n*   **Conformer A:** The bromo group is equatorial and the methyl group is axial.\n*   **Conformer B:** The bromo group is axial and the methyl group is equatorial.\n\nTo determine which conformer is more stable, we consider steric strain (A-values). The methyl group (A-value ≈ 1.7 kcal/mol) is much bulkier than the bromo group (A-value ≈ 0.5 kcal/mol). The conformer that places the larger group (methyl) in the more stable equatorial position will be the major conformer at equilibrium. Therefore, **Conformer B is more stable and will be present in a higher concentration.**\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Reactive Conformer and Necessary Geometry for E2**\n*   The E2 elimination has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Br) and the proton being removed (β-hydrogen) must be **anti-periplanar**.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair, this means the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be **trans-diaxial** (one axial-up, the other axial-down).\n*   For the reaction to occur, the leaving group (Br) **must be in an axial position**.\n*   Comparing our two conformers, only **Conformer B (Axial Br, Equatorial CH3)** can undergo the E2 reaction. Luckily, this is also the more stable conformer, so the reaction can proceed readily.\n\n**Step 5: Identify Available β-Protons for Elimination**\nIn Conformer B, the bromine atom is axial. We now need to look at the adjacent carbons (β-carbons), C2 and C6, for hydrogens that are also axial and on the opposite face of the ring.\n*   Let's assume the axial Br is pointing down. We need to find axial hydrogens pointing up on C2 and C6.\n*   **At C2:** This carbon has an equatorial methyl group. Therefore, the hydrogen on C2 is in the **axial** position (pointing up). This hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination is possible here.\n*   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial (pointing up) and one is equatorial. The **axial hydrogen** is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination is also possible here.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Regioselectivity (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann Product)**\nSince there are valid anti-periplanar hydrogens on both C2 and C6, two different alkene products can be formed. We must determine which is the major product.\n*   **Elimination of H from C2:** This forms a double bond between C1 and C2. The product is **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is a trisubstituted alkene, known as the **Zaitsev product**.\n*   **Elimination of H from C6:** This forms a double bond between C1 and C6. The product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a disubstituted alkene, known as the **Hofmann product**.\n\nThe choice between these two products depends on the base.\n*   Small, strong bases (like NaOEt) typically favor the more thermodynamically stable, more substituted Zaitsev product.\n*   Large, sterically hindered bases, like **potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK)**, have difficulty accessing the more sterically hindered β-proton. They preferentially attack the most accessible, least hindered β-proton, leading to the Hofmann product.\n*   The β-proton on C2 is sterically hindered by the adjacent equatorial methyl group. The β-proton on C6 is on a simple -CH2- group and is much less hindered.\n\n**Step 7: Conclusion**\nBecause the bulky base potassium tert-butoxide is used, it will preferentially attack the less hindered axial proton on C6. This leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene as the major product.\n\nThe product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
