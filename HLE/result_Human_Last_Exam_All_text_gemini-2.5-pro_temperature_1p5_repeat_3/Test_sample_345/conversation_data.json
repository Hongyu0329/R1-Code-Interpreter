    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key search terms** from the question:\n    *   Painting: \"The Radionist\" (German: \"Der Radionist\")\n    *   Artist: Kurt Günther\n    *   Creation Year: 1927\n    *   Acquisition Year: 1967\n    *   Information needed: The name of the acquiring museum.\n\n2.  **Conduct a targeted search** using these keywords. A search for `\"Kurt Günther\" \"Der Radionist\" 1927` will likely lead to information about the painting's current location and history.\n\n3.  **Analyze the search results.** The painting \"Der Radionist\" by Kurt Günther is a well-known work of the New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) movement. Multiple sources, including online art archives and museum collection databases, confirm its location.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the museum.** The painting is held by the **Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden** (Dresden State Art Collections) in Germany. Specifically, it is part of the collection of the **Galerie Neue Meister** (New Masters Gallery), which is one of the museums within the Dresden State Art Collections.\n\n5.  **Verify the acquisition date.** We must confirm that this museum acquired the work in **1967**. Museum records for the painting list its inventory number as `Inv.-Nr. 67/12`. In many European museum cataloging systems, the number before the slash indicates the year of acquisition. Therefore, \"67\" corresponds to the year 1967, confirming this was the year the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden acquired the painting.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Original Title:** Knowing the original German title, \"Der Radionist,\" is helpful for searching German museum databases.\n*   **Museum vs. Gallery:** The painting is in the Galerie Neue Meister, which is *part of* the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden. The Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden is the overarching institution that made the acquisition, so it is the most accurate and comprehensive answer.\n*   **Inventory Number:** The inventory number (67/12) is a key piece of evidence that directly confirms the acquisition year mentioned in the question.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy tracing the painting's location and verifying its acquisition details through its inventory number, we can confidently identify the museum.\n\n<<<Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden>>>"
