    "This question asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings required to implement a specific type of hyperspectral imaging known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). Let's break down the problem and the underlying principles.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The goal is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\". A spectral volume is a three-dimensional dataset, often called a data cube, with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). The constraint is that all the information needed to build this 3D cube must be captured in a single 2D snapshot (a single image on a sensor like a CCD or CMOS).\n\n2.  **Understand the Method:** The method specified is \"computed tomography\". In medical imaging (CT scans), a 3D volume of the human body is reconstructed from many 2D X-ray images (projections) taken from different angles around the body. The core idea is that you need multiple different \"views\" or \"projections\" of the object to reconstruct its higher-dimensional structure.\n\n3.  **Relate CT to Spectral Imaging:** In our case, the \"object\" we want to reconstruct is the 3D (x, y, λ) data cube. The \"projections\" are what we capture on the 2D sensor. To apply CT principles, we need to capture multiple, different projections of this data cube onto our 2D sensor *simultaneously*.\n\n4.  **Role of a Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits (disperses) light into its constituent wavelengths. When light from a point source passes through a grating, it creates a line of colors (a spectrum) on the sensor.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Case of One Grating (A):**\n    *   If we place a single diffraction grating in the optical path, every point (x, y) in the scene will be dispersed into a line of its component wavelengths (λ) on the sensor.\n    *   All these spectral lines will be oriented in the same direction (e.g., horizontally).\n    *   This creates a single, heavily smeared image where spatial and spectral information are overlapped in one direction.\n    *   This is analogous to having only *one* X-ray projection in medical CT. You cannot reconstruct a 3D object from a single 2D projection because you lack information from other viewing angles. The problem is severely underdetermined. Therefore, one grating is insufficient.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Case of Two Gratings (B):**\n    *   Now, consider using two diffraction gratings oriented perpendicularly to each other (e.g., one dispersing light horizontally and the other vertically). This combination is often called a \"crossed grating\" or a 2D disperser.\n    *   When light from the scene passes through this crossed grating, it produces multiple diffraction orders on the sensor. There is:\n        *   A central, undispersed image (the 0th order). This is a grayscale image of the scene, which is a projection of the data cube along the wavelength (λ) axis.\n        *   Dispersed images in the horizontal direction (the ±1st orders from the first grating). These are projections where the horizontal spatial dimension (x) is mixed with the spectral dimension (λ).\n        *   Dispersed images in the vertical direction (the ±1st orders from the second grating). These are projections where the vertical spatial dimension (y) is mixed with the spectral dimension (λ).\n        *   Dispersed images along the diagonals (from combinations of orders like (+1, +1), (+1, -1), etc.).\n    *   Crucially, all these different orders are captured in a single snapshot on the 2D sensor. Each order represents a different \"view\" or \"projection\" of the (x, y, λ) data cube.\n    *   Having this set of multiple, distinct projections allows us to use a computed tomography algorithm to \"back-project\" the information and reconstruct the original 3D data cube.\n    *   Since one grating is not enough, and two gratings are sufficient to provide the multiple projections needed for tomography, two is the minimum number.\n\n7.  **Analyze the Case of More Than Two Gratings (C, D, E, F):** While more complex systems could be designed, the question asks for the *minimum* number necessary. Since two gratings are sufficient, any number greater than two is not the minimum.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The \"single image\" constraint** is key. It forces the system to capture all necessary projections simultaneously, which is what the crossed-grating system does.\n*   **The \"computed tomography\" method** is the direct clue. It fundamentally relies on having multiple projections. The challenge is figuring out how to generate these multiple projections of a spectral cube in one shot.\n*   A specially fabricated single component that acts as a 2D disperser (like a computer-generated hologram or a pixelated grating) can be used. However, such a device is functionally equivalent to two crossed 1D gratings, as it must disperse light along two orthogonal axes to create the necessary set of projections for tomography. Therefore, the conceptual minimum is based on two orthogonal dispersions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo apply computed tomography for reconstructing a spectral data cube, multiple projections are required. A single diffraction grating provides only one type of projection, which is insufficient. Two perpendicular diffraction gratings (a crossed grating) create multiple diffraction orders on the sensor, each serving as a unique projection of the data cube. This provides the necessary information for a tomographic algorithm to reconstruct the full spectral volume. Therefore, the minimum number of gratings is two.\n\n<<<B>>>"
