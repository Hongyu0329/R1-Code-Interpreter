No. It is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics (involving Hilbert spaces, linear operators, and differential equations) is designed to model the physical world and makes no reference to the concepts central to Gödel's proof, such as "positive properties," "essence," or metaphysical "necessity." Gödel's proof is a formal argument within modal logic, whose axioms are metaphysical, not physical. One cannot use the tools of a physical theory to prove a conclusion derived from an unrelated set of metaphysical axioms.
