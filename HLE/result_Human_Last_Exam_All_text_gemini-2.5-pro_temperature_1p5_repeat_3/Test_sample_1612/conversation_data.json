    "### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe user is asking for the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history. To answer this accurately, we must break down the question and consider all relevant details.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define \"Triple Crown\":** In baseball, there are two different types of Triple Crowns a player can win. The question does not specify which one, so we must consider both.\n    *   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead their league (American League or National League) in Batting Average, Home Runs, and Runs Batted In (RBIs) in the same season.\n    *   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher must lead their league in Wins, Strikeouts, and Earned Run Average (ERA) in the same season.\n\n2.  **Clarify \"Winners\":** The question asks \"how many ... winners are there.\" This typically means the number of *unique players* who have accomplished the feat. It is different from the number of *times* the Triple Crown has been won, as several players have won it more than once. The best approach is to count the unique players for each type of Triple Crown and then combine them.\n\n3.  **Identify Batting Triple Crown Winners:** We need to list all the unique players who have won the Batting Triple Crown.\n\n    *   **Players who won once:** Nap Lajoie, Ty Cobb, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle, Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski, Miguel Cabrera, Paul Hines, Tip O'Neill, Hugh Duffy, Heinie Zimmerman, Chuck Klein, Joe Medwick.\n    *   **Players who won twice:** Ted Williams, Rogers Hornsby.\n    *   **Total unique batting winners:** 14 (one-time winners) + 2 (two-time winners) = **16 unique players**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* The wins by Paul Hines (1878), Tip O'Neill (1887), and Hugh Duffy (1894) occurred in the 19th century before the \"modern era\" (post-1900). RBIs were not an official statistic for Hines's win but are recognized retroactively. These are still counted in official MLB records.\n\n4.  **Identify Pitching Triple Crown Winners:** We need to list all the unique players who have won the Pitching Triple Crown.\n\n    *   **Players who won once:** Rube Waddell, Hal Newhouser, Pedro Mart√≠nez, Johan Santana, Justin Verlander, Shane Bieber, Gerrit Cole, Tommy Bond, Old Hoss Radbourn, Tim Keefe, John Clarkson, Amos Rusie, Dazzy Vance, Bucky Walters, Hippo Vaughn, Steve Carlton, Dwight Gooden, Randy Johnson, Jake Peavy, Clayton Kershaw, Cy Young.\n    *   **Players who won twice:** Lefty Grove, Lefty Gomez, Roger Clemens, Christy Mathewson.\n    *   **Players who won three times:** Walter Johnson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Sandy Koufax.\n    *   **Total unique pitching winners:** 21 (one-time winners) + 4 (two-time winners) + 3 (three-time winners) = **28 unique players**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* Several winners are from the 19th century. Shane Bieber's 2020 win occurred during a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Hippo Vaughn's 1918 win is sometimes noted as he tied for the ERA lead, but he is officially recognized as a Triple Crown winner.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Winners:** To get the final answer, we add the number of unique batting winners to the number of unique pitching winners.\n\n    *   A key check is to ensure no player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown. No player in MLB history has accomplished this.\n    *   Therefore, we can simply add the two counts together.\n    *   Total Unique Winners = (Unique Batting Winners) + (Unique Pitching Winners)\n    *   Total Unique Winners = 16 + 28 = 44.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** There have been **16** unique players who have won the Batting Triple Crown.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** There have been **28** unique players who have won the Pitching Triple Crown.\n*   **Total Winners:** Since no player appears on both lists, the total number of MLB Triple Crown winners is the sum of these two numbers.\n*   **Final Calculation:** 16 + 28 = 44.\n\n<<<44>>>"
