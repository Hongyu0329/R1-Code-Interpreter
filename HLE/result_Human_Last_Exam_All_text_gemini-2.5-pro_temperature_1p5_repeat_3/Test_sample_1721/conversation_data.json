    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are looking for the largest possible density `c` of a set `A` within the integers `{1, 2, ..., N}` such that the sumset `A+A` contains no perfect squares.\n*   **Set A:** $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$\n*   **Size of A:** $|A| = (c + o(1))N$, which means we are interested in the limit of the ratio $|A|/N$ as $N \\to \\infty$.\n*   **Sumset A+A:** This is the set of all sums of two elements from A, i.e., $\\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$. Note that $a_1$ and $a_2$ can be the same element.\n*   **The Condition:** $A+A$ must not contain any perfect square. That is, for any $x, y \\in A$, the sum $x+y$ is never a number like $1, 4, 9, 16, \\dots$.\n\n**2. Finding a Lower Bound for c (Construction)**\n\nA powerful method for constructing such sets is to use modular arithmetic. The idea is to find a modulus `m` and a subset of residues `B` such that sums of elements from `B` avoid being squares modulo `m`.\n\n*   **Step 2.1: Choose a modulus `m`**. Let's try a small one, `m=3`.\n*   **Step 2.2: Identify squares modulo `m`**.\n    *   $0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$\n    *   $1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n    *   $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n    *   The set of squares modulo 3 is $S_3 = \\{0, 1\\}$. Any integer that is a perfect square must be congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 3.\n*   **Step 2.3: Find a subset `B` of `{0, 1, 2}` such that `B+B` avoids `S_3`**.\n    *   The numbers that are not squares modulo 3 are the elements in $\\{0, 1, 2\\} \\setminus S_3 = \\{2\\}$.\n    *   We need to find a subset $B \\subseteq \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ such that for any $b_1, b_2 \\in B$, their sum $b_1 + b_2 \\pmod 3$ is equal to 2.\n    *   Let's test possibilities for B:\n        *   If we choose $B=\\{0\\}$, $0+0=0 \\in S_3$. Fails.\n        *   If we choose $B=\\{2\\}$, $2+2=4\\equiv 1 \\in S_3$. Fails.\n        *   If we choose $B=\\{1\\}$, $1+1=2$. This is not in $S_3$. This works.\n        *   If B has more than one element, it's easy to check that some sum will fall into $S_3$. For example, if $B=\\{0,1\\}$, $0+0=0 \\in S_3$.\n    *   The only such set (that is not empty) is $B=\\{1\\}$.\n*   **Step 2.4: Construct the set `A`**. We can now define `A` to be the set of all numbers in `{1, ..., N}` that are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n    *   $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\n*   **Step 2.5: Verify the condition and find the density `c`**.\n    *   For any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n    *   Their sum is $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 1 + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n    *   As we established, no perfect square can be congruent to 2 modulo 3. Therefore, $a_1+a_2$ can never be a perfect square.\n    *   The size of this set A is $|A| = \\lfloor\\frac{N-1}{3}\\rfloor + 1 \\approx N/3$.\n    *   This construction shows that it's possible to have a density $c=1/3$. So, we have a lower bound: $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n**3. Finding an Upper Bound for c (Theoretical Argument)**\n\nProving that $c$ cannot be larger than $1/3$ is more involved and relies on deep results from additive combinatorics. Here is a sketch of the reasoning.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Partition `A` by residues modulo 3**.\n    *   Let $A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$ be a set such that $A+A$ contains no squares.\n    *   Let's partition `A` into three subsets based on their value modulo 3:\n        *   $A_0 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\\}$\n        *   $A_1 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$\n        *   $A_2 = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$\n    *   So, $A = A_0 \\cup A_1 \\cup A_2$.\n*   **Step 3.2: Analyze the sums between these partitions**.\n    *   If $a, a' \\in A_1$, then $a+a' \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. This sum is never a square. This portion of the sumset is \"safe\".\n    *   However, other sums could be squares:\n        *   $A_0+A_0$: sums are $\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. Could be squares (e.g., $9, 36, \\dots$).\n        *   $A_2+A_2$: sums are $\\equiv 2+2=4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Could be squares (e.g., $4, 25, \\dots$).\n        *   $A_0+A_1$: sums are $\\equiv 0+1=1 \\pmod 3$. Could be squares.\n        *   $A_1+A_2$: sums are $\\equiv 1+2=0 \\pmod 3$. Could be squares.\n*   **Step 3.3: Apply density theorems**.\n    *   Theorems by Sárközy and others state that if a set (or a pair of sets) is \"dense enough,\" its sumset must contain a member of certain well-structured sets, including the squares.\n    *   For example, a key result implies that if the set $A_2$ had a positive density (i.e., $|A_2| = \\gamma N$ for some constant $\\gamma > 0$), then the sumset $A_2+A_2$ would be guaranteed to contain a square (for large enough N). Since $A+A$ cannot contain a square, this forces $|A_2|$ to be vanishingly small compared to N, i.e., $|A_2|=o(N)$.\n    *   A similar argument can be made for all the other \"unsafe\" pairs. For $A$ to maintain the no-squares-in-sumset property while having a positive density, the components involved in unsafe sums must have zero density.\n    *   This forces $|A_0|=o(N)$ and $|A_2|=o(N)$.\n*   **Step 3.4: Conclude the upper bound**.\n    *   If any set $A$ with a positive density $c$ must satisfy $|A_0|=o(N)$ and $|A_2|=o(N)$, then the set $A$ must be composed almost entirely of elements from $A_1$.\n    *   $|A| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2| = o(N) + |A_1| + o(N) = |A_1| + o(N)$.\n    *   The set $A_1$ is a subset of all integers up to N that are congruent to 1 modulo 3. The total number of such integers is approximately $N/3$.\n    *   Therefore, $|A_1| \\le N/3 + O(1)$.\n    *   This leads to the conclusion that $|A| \\le N/3 + o(N)$.\n    *   Thus, the density $c$ must be less than or equal to $1/3$. So, $c \\le 1/3$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nCombining the lower bound ($c \\ge 1/3$) from our construction and the upper bound ($c \\le 1/3$) from the theoretical argument, we find that the largest possible value for $c$ is exactly $1/3$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
