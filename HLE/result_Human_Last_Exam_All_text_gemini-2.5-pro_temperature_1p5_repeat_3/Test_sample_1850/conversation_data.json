    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Terms**\n\n*   **\"Historical Saint\"**: In the context of Milton's Protestant theology, this term does not refer to saints officially canonized by the Catholic Church. Instead, it refers to major holy and righteous figures from the biblical narrative (primarily the Old Testament) who are revered in the broader Christian tradition. This includes patriarchs, prophets, and other significant righteous individuals. Figures who are named but are explicitly presented as unrighteous (like Cain or Nimrod) are excluded.\n*   **\"Mentioned by Name\"**: The character must be referred to by their proper name or a standard, unambiguous patronymic (e.g., \"Amram's son\" for Moses). A mere description of the person (e.g., \"the Virgin\" for Mary or \"that uxorious king\" for Solomon) does not count.\n\n### **Step 2: Systematic Search through *Paradise Lost***\n\nWe will search the text of *Paradise Lost* (Books I-XII) for names of biblical figures who fit the definition of a \"saint.\"\n\n1.  **Adam**: Mentioned by name throughout the epic, starting from Book I. He is a central character.\n2.  **Eve**: Mentioned by name throughout the epic. She is a central character.\n3.  **Abel**: Mentioned by name in Book XI. Michael shows Adam the future, where Cain murders his brother. \"And Abel's cry / Rose to the heavens\" (Book XI, line 454).\n4.  **Seth**: Mentioned by name in Book XI as the progenitor of the righteous line that contrasts with Cain's. \"To these that sober race of men, whose lives / Religious titled them the sons of God, / Shall yield up all their virtue... (by which he means the seed of Seth)\" (Book XI, lines 606-610, referencing the \"holy Seed of Seth\" mentioned earlier).\n5.  **Enoch**: Mentioned by name in Book XI as the man who was taken by God without dying. After describing the event, the text concludes, \"Thus... / Men shall be born and die... / ...So Enoch walkt with God, and was translated / To the heavenly life\" (Book XI, lines 702-706).\n6.  **Noah**: Mentioned by name in Book XI in the context of the Great Flood. \"and God remembered Noah, / And all the souls that were with him in the Ark\" (Book XI, lines 876-877).\n7.  **Japhet**: One of Noah's sons. He is mentioned by name in Book XII as an ancestor of nations. \"...from the sons of Noah, and from the sons of Japhet; which from him shall stretch their race\" (Book XII, line 118 in the standard second edition text).\n8.  **Abraham**: The great patriarch is named in Book XII as Michael explains the covenant. \"...This is the seed of Abraham elected\" (Book XII, line 149).\n9.  **Isaac**: Mentioned by name in Book XII when Michael lists the patriarchs to whom God swore his covenant. \"...which God to the seed of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob he had sworn...\" (Book XII, lines 228-229).\n10. **Jacob**: Mentioned in the same line as Isaac in Book XII. \"...of Isaac, and of Jacob he had sworn...\" (Book XII, line 229).\n11. **Moses**: He is not mentioned by his direct name \"Moses.\" However, he is identified by a common epic patronymic in Book I. \"As when the potent Rod / Of Amram's Son in Egypts evill day...\" (Book I, lines 338-339). \"Amram's son\" is an unambiguous name for Moses.\n12. **David**: The king is mentioned by name in Book XII in the context of the Messianic lineage. \"A King is sought... whom God, displeased, shall give them... yet from his line shall spring / A Son, the woman's seed to thee foretold... and for him the world's great Architect / His regal Seat in Sion shall erect... to reign / The Son of David, and his rightful Lord\" (Book XII, lines 341-348, with slight condensing).\n\n### **Step 3: Noting Key Exclusions**\n\nIt is important to note who is *not* mentioned by name, even though their stories are told.\n\n*   **New Testament Figures**: Remarkably, *no* New Testament saints are mentioned by their personal names. Mary is called \"a Virgin pure,\" John the Baptist is a \"great Forerunner,\" and the apostles are referred to collectively as \"twelve... / His messengers\" or \"fishermen.\" The name \"Jesus\" itself never appears; Milton consistently uses titles like \"the Son,\" \"Messiah,\" \"Saviour,\" and \"Emmanuel.\"\n*   **Other Old Testament Figures**: Many prominent figures are described but not named, including **Solomon** (\"that uxorious king\"), **Joshua** (a \"great Deliverer\" who succeeds Moses), and **Elijah** (his story's imagery is used for Enoch, but he is not named). **Joseph**, the son of Jacob, is also described as the one who saves his family, but he is not named.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Tally**\n\nCompiling the list from Step 2 gives us the following named historical saints:\n\n1.  Adam\n2.  Eve\n3.  Abel\n4.  Seth\n5.  Enoch\n6.  Noah\n7.  Japhet\n8.  Abraham\n9.  Isaac\n10. Jacob\n11. Moses (as \"Amram's son\")\n12. David\n\nThe total number of historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost* is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
