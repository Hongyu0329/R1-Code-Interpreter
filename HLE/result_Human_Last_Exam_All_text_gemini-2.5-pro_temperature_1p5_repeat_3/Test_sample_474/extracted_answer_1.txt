No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of a mimicry syndrome is to signal to predators that the bee is dangerous. Therefore, the effectiveness of the mimicry is determined by how the predator's visual system perceives the signal, not a human's. The primary predators of bumblebees, such as birds, have tetrachromatic vision and can see ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Two bee species that appear identical to a human may look distinctly different to a bird if they have different UV-reflectance patterns. Because the study relies on the visual perception of humans (who are not the natural predators) and uses standard field images that likely do not capture UV information, the resulting clusters would reflect human perceptual biases and would not necessarily represent the true, functional mimicry rings as they exist in nature.
