    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut \"Death of Nikiya\" variation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Specific Performance**\nThe question refers to Natalia Osipova's debut performance as the character Nikiya in the ballet *La Bayadère*. This specific performance was with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. We need to analyze her solo variation in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene from Act II.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step \"Entrelacé\"**\nAn *entrelacé*, short for *tour jeté entrelacé*, is a turning leap. The dancer jumps from one leg, makes a half turn in the air while the legs pass each other, and lands on the other leg. In this specific variation, these are the signature, spectacular high jumps performed traveling across the stage.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Variation in the Performance**\nThe \"Death of Nikiya\" scene is Nikiya's final solo in Act II. It occurs after she is presented with a basket of flowers, which secretly hides a snake. The variation is famous for its technical difficulty and emotional intensity.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Entrelacés in Sequence**\nBy carefully watching the video of Osipova's 2009 debut performance, we can count the steps methodically. The *entrelacés* are performed in two separate diagonal passes across the stage.\n\n*   **First Diagonal Pass:** After the initial section of the variation, Osipova begins the first sequence of traveling leaps. Counting each distinct *entrelacé* jump, she performs a total of **7** entrelacés.\n*   **Second Diagonal Pass:** Following a brief section of other steps (including *piqué* turns), she begins the second sequence of leaps, traveling across the stage in the opposite direction. Counting these jumps, she again performs a total of **7** entrelacés.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total**\nTo find the total number of *entrelacés* in the entire variation, we sum the number from each pass.\nTotal = (Entrelacés in first pass) + (Entrelacés in second pass)\nTotal = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to analyze the specific performance requested (Osipova, Bolshoi, 2009 debut), as different ballerinas or even the same ballerina in different performances might vary the number of jumps.\n*   One must clearly distinguish the *entrelacés* from other steps in the variation, such as connecting steps, poses (like *attitude*), and other types of turns (*piqués*). In this variation, the *entrelacés* are the most prominent and powerful traveling jumps.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the specified performance, the final count is 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
