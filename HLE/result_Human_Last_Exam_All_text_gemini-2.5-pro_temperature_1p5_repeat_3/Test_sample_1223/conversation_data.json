    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terms:**\n    *   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. This is a very strong condition. The classic example is the pseudo-arc.\n    *   **Stone-Cech Compactification ($\\beta Y$):** For a locally compact Hausdorff space $Y$, $\\beta Y$ is the \"largest\" compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense open subspace. Any continuous map from $Y$ to a compact Hausdorff space $K$ can be uniquely extended to a continuous map from $\\beta Y$ to $K$.\n    *   **Stone-Cech Remainder ($\\beta Y \\setminus Y$):** The set of points in the Stone-Cech compactification that are not in the original space.\n    *   **Composant:** In a continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the set of all points $q$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. Composants partition the continuum.\n\n2.  **Understand the Space and its Remainder:**\n    *   We start with a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$.\n    *   We consider the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a compact metric space, $Y$ is a locally compact, non-compact, separable metric space.\n    *   Since $X$ is a continuum, any point $x$ is not a global cut-point, so $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected.\n    *   Let $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ be the Stone-Cech remainder.\n    *   The space $X$ is itself a compactification of $Y$. By the universal property of $\\beta Y$, there exists a unique continuous map $\\pi: \\beta Y \\to X$ that is the identity on $Y$. This map sends the remainder $R$ to the single point $x$, i.e., $\\pi(R) = \\{x\\}$.\n    *   A key theorem in continuum theory states that for a continuum $X$ and a non-cut point $x \\in X$, the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is a continuum. In a hereditary indecomposable continuum, no point is a cut point. Therefore, the remainder $R$ is a continuum.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Composants of the Remainder $R$:**\n    *   The number of composants of a continuum depends on whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n        *   An indecomposable metric continuum has uncountably many composants, specifically $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n        *   A decomposable, locally connected continuum has exactly one composant.\n        *   A decomposable continuum that is not locally connected can have more than one composant (e.g., an arc has 3 composants according to some sources, though locally connected continua are often cited as having just one).\n    *   The question asks for the *maximum possible* number of composants. This means we should look for an example of a hereditary indecomposable continuum $X$ whose remainder $R$ has the largest possible number of composants.\n\n4.  **The Key Example: The Pseudo-arc:**\n    *   Let's choose $X$ to be the **pseudo-arc**, which we denote by $P$. The pseudo-arc is the prime example of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\n    *   A deep and important theorem in continuum theory (due originally to R.H. Bing, with published proofs by others such as M. Smith and W. Lewis) states that for the pseudo-arc $P$ and any point $x \\in P$, the remainder $R_P = \\beta(P \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (P \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc $P$ itself.\n    *   This means that for this choice of $X$, the remainder $R$ is a pseudo-arc.\n    *   The pseudo-arc is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Every indecomposable metric continuum has $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n    *   Therefore, by choosing $X$ to be the pseudo-arc, we obtain a remainder with $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants.\n\n5.  **Establish the Maximum:**\n    *   The pseudo-arc example shows that it is possible to obtain $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants. This means the maximum possible number is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   The remainder $R$ is a subcontinuum of the Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. Since $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a separable metric space, the remainder $R$ (in the case of the pseudo-arc example) is a metric continuum.\n    *   A metric continuum is a separable space, and therefore has at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ points.\n    *   Since each composant is a non-empty set of points, the number of composants cannot exceed the total number of points in the space. Thus, the number of composants is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Combining these two points, the maximum possible number of composants is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe maximum possible number of composants is achieved when the remainder is an indecomposable continuum. The case where $X$ is a pseudo-arc demonstrates that the remainder can indeed be an indecomposable continuum (another pseudo-arc), which has $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. As a metric continuum cannot have more than $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants, this is the maximum possible number."
