No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered radial. It follows the Parker Spiral, which is typically angled at ~45 degrees to the radial direction. The use of magnetic components perpendicular to the radial direction to calculate helicity is a practical simplification justified by Taylor's "frozen-in flow" Hypothesis, where the fast, radial solar wind flow makes the *apparent* direction of wave propagation radial from the spacecraft's perspective.
