    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific character in William Morris's novel *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must satisfy two key conditions:\n    *   They must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   They must describe Roman religious practices, specifically mentioning a story that is clearly identifiable as the myth of Romulus and Remus (twin brothers suckled by a wolf).\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters and Plot Points:** The novel is centered on the Wolfing tribe, a branch of the Goths, as they prepare to fight the invading Romans. The central protagonist is **Thiodolf**, the war-duke and leader of the Wolfings. A crucial part of his backstory, which informs his leadership and understanding of the enemy, is that he spent a significant part of his youth living among the Romans. This makes him the most likely candidate. Other characters, like his daughter Hall-Sun or his divine wife the Wood-Sun, are primarily rooted in the world of the Goths and the forest, lacking this direct experience with Roman civilization.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Passage in the Novel:** The specific scene where this description occurs is in **Chapter IV: \"Thiodolf telleth of the City of the Romans.\"** In this chapter, Thiodolf is addressing his people, the Kindred of the Wolf, to explain the nature and beliefs of the powerful enemy they are about to face.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Character's Description:** During his speech, Thiodolf describes the grandeur and might of the Roman city he witnessed. He then moves on to their gods and founding myths. He says the Romans believe their city was founded by \"twin brethren.\" He recounts their origin story, explaining how these twins were cast out to die as infants but were discovered and \"suckled by a she-wolf.\"\n\n5.  **Connect the Description to the Myth:** This description is an unmistakable allusion to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus. The key elements match perfectly: twin brothers, abandonment as infants, and being nursed by a she-wolf (Lupa). The reader is meant to recognize this famous story immediately.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The character who lived among the Romans and recounts the story of their wolf-suckled twin founders is **Thiodolf**. He uses this story to explain the culture and martial spirit of the Romans to his own people.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Indirect Reference:** The question notes that the character describes the practices \"in a way that readers will recognize.\" Thiodolf does not use the names \"Romulus\" and \"Remus,\" but the details he provides are so specific that the reference is unambiguous.\n*   **Character Motivation:** It's important to understand *why* Thiodolf tells this story. He is not just sharing an interesting anecdote; he is providing crucial intelligence about his enemy's psychology and self-perception, explaining their connection to the wolf and their belief in a divinely ordained, martial destiny.\n*   **Source Confirmation:** This analysis is based on the text of *The House of the Wolfings*, specifically the events of Chapter IV.\n\nWith the analysis complete, the final answer can be identified.\n\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
