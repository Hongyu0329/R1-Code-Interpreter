    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Query's Key Elements:** The question asks to identify a specific film based on four distinct and crucial pieces of information:\n    *   **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n    *   **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n    *   **The Character/Action:** A teenager is the person performing the action.\n    *   **The Scene:** The character rides a pink bicycle and pedals it directly toward a car that is driving toward them.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of \"Pink Bike\":** This is a very strong visual cue. Many films feature bikes, but a pink one narrows the search considerably. Iconic movie bikes (like in *E.T.* or *Pee-wee's Big Adventure*) are typically red or other colors.\n*   **Specificity of the Action:** The action is not just riding a bike near a car. It is a direct confrontationâ€”\"pedal directly toward an oncoming car.\" This implies a game of chicken or a desperate attempt to stop the vehicle.\n*   **Definition of \"Teenager\":** The character should be adolescent (roughly 13-19 years old). Some coming-of-age films feature pre-teens (like *Now and Then*), which could be a point of confusion.\n*   **Definition of \"Major Film Studio\":** This includes studios like Universal, Warner Bros., Paramount, Sony, and Disney. It can also include prominent studios like New Line Cinema (part of WB) or production companies like Blumhouse that have distribution deals with majors.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Answer\n\n1.  **Initial Search and Elimination:** Common films with teenagers and bikes are considered first.\n    *   ***It* (2017):** Has teenagers, bikes, and a car confrontation, but the main character bikes are not pink, and the confrontation is a standoff, not one character riding at the moving car.\n    *   ***Now and Then* (1995):** Does feature a character with a pink bike. However, the characters are pre-teens (age 12), not teenagers, and the pivotal scene of riding toward an oncoming car does not occur.\n    *   Other films like *Napoleon Dynamite* or *E.T.* are eliminated for not matching the bike color or the specific action.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Correct Film:** The unique combination of all elements points to the 2020 horror-comedy film **Freaky**.\n\n3.  **Verifying the Match:** Let's check *Freaky* against all the careful points:\n    *   **Hollywood Feature Film from a Major Studio:** Yes, *Freaky* was produced by Blumhouse and distributed by Universal Pictures, a major studio.\n    *   **Pink Bike:** Yes, the film has a scene with a small, pink child's bicycle, complete with tassels.\n    *   **Pedal Directly Toward an Oncoming Car:** Yes, the pink bike is grabbed from a lawn and pedaled furiously into the path of an oncoming car to force it to stop. The scene is a direct match for this action.\n    *   **A Teenager Rides the Bike:** This is the one point of slight ambiguity. In the film, the body of the teenage protagonist (Millie) has been swapped with that of an adult serial killer (the Blissfield Butcher, played by Vince Vaughn). The rider of the pink bike is the Butcher in his original adult body, trying to stop the car containing the teenagers. Although the rider is technically an adult, the film is a teen-centric movie, and the scene's entire context revolves around teenagers. Given that every other highly specific detail matches perfectly, this is unequivocally the film the question refers to.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe film that contains the scene where a character rides a pink bicycle and pedals it directly toward an oncoming car is the 2020 film *Freaky*.\n\n<<<Freaky>>>"
