    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to compute the \"rule activation level\" (also known as the firing strength) for a single fuzzy rule. This value represents the degree to which the rule's conditions are met by the current inputs.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Components of a Fuzzy Rule**\nA fuzzy rule consists of an antecedent (the \"IF\" part) and a consequent (the \"THEN\" part). The rule activation level is calculated based *only* on the antecedent part. The antecedent can contain multiple clauses linked by logical operators like AND or OR. The \"AND\" operator is modeled by a t-norm, while the \"OR\" operator is modeled by a t-conorm (or s-norm).\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the Given Information**\nWe are given two values and an operation:\n*   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`: This represents the membership degree (or degree of truth) for the first condition in the rule's antecedent. Let's denote this as `μ_1 = 0.7`.\n*   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: Although the notation `G` often refers to a consequent set, in the context of calculating a single activation level for a rule, this must be interpreted as the membership degree for a second condition in the antecedent. The problem implies these two values must be combined. Let's denote this as `μ_2 = 0.9`.\n*   **t-norm operation:** This specifies that the antecedent clauses are connected by a logical \"AND\".\n\nThe mention of an \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\" indicates the underlying complexity of the system. However, the problem provides specific scalar values (0.7, 0.9), suggesting we are analyzing the system at a particular point or a specific alpha-plane where the membership functions yield these crisp values. The calculation itself follows standard fuzzy logic principles.\n\n**Step 4: Select and Apply the T-Norm Operation**\nA t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy membership values. There are several types of t-norms, but the most common and standard one is the **minimum operator**. Unless specified otherwise, it is the default choice.\n\n*   **Rule's Antecedent:** IF (condition 1 is true to degree `μ_1`) AND (condition 2 is true to degree `μ_2`)\n*   **Activation Level Calculation:** `Activation Level = t-norm(μ_1, μ_2)`\n*   **Applying the Minimum T-Norm:** `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\nWe compute the minimum of the two given membership values.\n*   `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\nThe resulting rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Antecedent vs. Consequent:** It is critical to recognize that the rule activation level depends only on the \"IF\" part (antecedent) of the rule. The result of this calculation is then used to infer an output from the \"THEN\" part (consequent), but the consequent's membership function does not influence the activation level itself.\n2.  **Ambiguous Notation:** The notation `μG_k_j(y_j)` is potentially confusing, but given the request to use a t-norm to find an activation level, it must be treated as a second antecedent membership value. If `Phi_k(x′)` were the final activation level, the t-norm operation would be unnecessary.\n3.  **Choice of T-Norm:** The result depends on the specific t-norm used. While the minimum operator is standard, another t-norm like the product operator would yield a different result (`0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`). The analysis assumes the most common convention.\n4.  **Context of IT3 FS:** The complexity of the Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set is abstracted away by the provision of scalar membership values. The core operation of combining antecedent truths with a t-norm remains the same regardless of the fuzzy set type.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
