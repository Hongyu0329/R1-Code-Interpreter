    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the partition function Z.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of the Grand Canonical Partition Function**\n\nThe grand canonical partition function, Z, for a quantum system is defined as the trace of the statistical operator `exp[-β(H^ - μN^)]`:\n`Z = Tr(e^(-β(H^ - μN^)))`\nwhere:\n*   `H^` is the Hamiltonian of the system.\n*   `N^` is the particle number operator.\n*   `μ` is the chemical potential.\n*   `β = 1/(k_B T)` is the inverse temperature (`k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature).\n*   `Tr(...)` denotes the trace over a complete set of states.\n\n**2. Substitute the Given Hamiltonian into the Definition**\n\nThe problem states that the Hamiltonian for the system is `H^ = -μN^`. We substitute this specific `H^` into the general formula for `Z`:\n\n`Z = Tr(e^(-β((-μN^) - μN^)))`\n`Z = Tr(e^(-β(-2μN^)))`\n`Z = Tr(e^(2βμN^))`\n\n**3. Formulate the Problem in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe path integral representation of the partition function `Z = Tr(e^(-βK^))` for a grand canonical Hamiltonian `K^ = H^ - μN^` is given by:\n\n`Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] e^(-S[ψ*, ψ])`\n\nwhere `S` is the Euclidean action, and `ψ*, ψ` are the fields representing the particles (Grassmann fields for fermions, complex fields for bosons). The action is given by:\n\n`S = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x L_E`\n\nwhere `τ` is imaginary time and the Euclidean Lagrangian density `L_E` is typically of the form `L_E = ψ*(∂_τ + H_sp - μ)ψ`, with `H_sp` being the single-particle Hamiltonian operator.\n\nIn our case, the operator in the exponent is `2βμN^`. This is equivalent to the grand canonical operator `e^(-β(H'_{eff} - μ'_{eff}N^))` for an effective system with:\n*   Effective Hamiltonian: `H'_{eff} = 0`\n*   Effective Chemical Potential: `μ'_{eff} = 2μ`\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the partition function for a non-interacting gas (`H'_{eff} = 0`) with a chemical potential of `2μ`. The corresponding single-particle Hamiltonian operator is `H_sp = 0`, meaning all single-particle energy eigenvalues `ε_j` are zero.\n\nThe Euclidean action for this effective system is:\n\n`S = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x ψ*(∂_τ + H_sp - μ'_{eff})ψ = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x ψ*(∂_τ - 2μ)ψ`\n\n**4. Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nThe path integral with a quadratic action like this is a Gaussian integral. Evaluating it gives the determinant of the operator `(∂_τ - 2μ)`. The result is a standard formula that depends on the statistics of the particles (Bosons or Fermions).\n\nLet `M` be the number of degenerate single-particle states available to the system. The degeneracy arises because the Hamiltonian `H^ = -μN^` has no dependence on momentum or position, so all single-particle states are treated equally. The logarithm of the partition function is a sum over the contributions from each of these states.\n\n`ln Z = ∑_{j=1 to M} (ln Z_j)`\n\nThe standard result from evaluating the functional determinant for a single state `j` with single-particle energy `ε_j` and chemical potential `μ` is:\n*   **For Bosons:** `ln Z_j = -ln(1 - e^(-β(ε_j - μ)))`\n*   **For Fermions:** `ln Z_j = ln(1 + e^(-β(ε_j - μ)))`\n\nWe apply this result to our effective system where `ε_j = 0` for all `j` and the effective chemical potential is `μ'_{eff} = 2μ`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Partition Function for Fermions**\n\nFor fermions, we use the corresponding formula with our effective parameters:\n`ln Z_F = ∑_{j=1 to M} ln(1 + e^(-β(0 - 2μ)))`\n`ln Z_F = ∑_{j=1 to M} ln(1 + e^(2βμ))`\nSince all `M` terms are identical:\n`ln Z_F = M * ln(1 + e^(2βμ))`\nExponentiating both sides gives the partition function:\n`Z_F = (1 + e^(2βμ))^M`\n\n**6. Calculate the Partition Function for Bosons**\n\nFor bosons, we use the corresponding formula:\n`ln Z_B = ∑_{j=1 to M} [-ln(1 - e^(-β(0 - 2μ)))]`\n`ln Z_B = ∑_{j=1 to M} [-ln(1 - e^(2βμ))]`\nAgain, all `M` terms are identical:\n`ln Z_B = -M * ln(1 - e^(2βμ)) = M * ln((1 - e^(2βμ))⁻¹)`\nExponentiating both sides gives the partition function:\n`Z_B = (1 - e^(2βμ))⁻ᴹ`\n\nThis result for bosons is physically meaningful only if the geometric series used in its derivation converges. This requires `e^(2βμ) < 1`, which implies `2βμ < 0`. Since `β > 0`, this condition simplifies to `μ < 0`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Correctly Identifying the Operator:** The key is to correctly identify the operator in the trace as `exp(2βμN^)` by substituting the given `H^` into the standard definition of `Z`.\n*   **Using an Effective System:** The problem is simplified by mapping it to a known system—a non-interacting gas (`H=0`) with a modified chemical potential (`μ_{eff} = 2μ`).\n*   **Particle Statistics:** The result depends critically on whether the particles are bosons or fermions. Since the problem does not specify, the solution should address both cases.\n*   **Degeneracy (M):** The Hamiltonian implies a degeneracy of single-particle states. The partition function depends on this number, `M`. Without more information, `M` remains a parameter in the final answer.\n*   **Convergence Condition:** For the bosonic case, the physical validity of the result depends on the condition `μ < 0`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function Z depends on the statistics of the particles in the system and the number of degenerate single-particle states, `M`.\n\n**For a system of Fermions:**\nThe partition function is:\n`Z_F = (1 + e^(2βμ))^M`\n\n**For a system of Bosons:**\nThe partition function is:\n`Z_B = (1 - e^(2βμ))⁻ᴹ`\nThis result is valid under the condition that `μ < 0` for the sum to converge.\n\n<<<\nThe partition function Z depends on the particle statistics. Let M be the number of degenerate single-particle states.\nFor Fermions: Z_F = (1 + e^(2βμ))^M\nFor Bosons: Z_B = (1 - e^(2βμ))⁻ᴹ, valid for μ < 0.\n>>>"
