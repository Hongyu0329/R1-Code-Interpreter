    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We want to find the number of involutions in the group $G = \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Relating Involutions in PSU(n,q) to elements in SU(n,q):**\n    The group PSU(n,q) is the quotient group SU(n,q) / Z(SU(n,q)), where Z(SU(n,q)) is the center of the Special Unitary group SU(n,q). Let's denote $\\tilde{G} = \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ and $Z = Z(\\tilde{G})$.\n    An element $x \\in G$ is an involution if $x \\neq 1$ and $x^2 = 1$. Let $x$ be the coset $gZ$ for some $g \\in \\tilde{G}$.\n    *   $x \\neq 1$ means $gZ \\neq Z$, so $g \\notin Z$.\n    *   $x^2 = 1$ means $(gZ)^2 = Z$, which implies $g^2 Z = Z$, so $g^2 \\in Z$.\n    So, we need to count the number of elements $g \\in \\tilde{G}$ such that $g \\notin Z$ and $g^2 \\in Z$, and then account for the fact that multiple elements in $\\tilde{G}$ can map to the same element in $G$.\n\n2.  **Determining the Center Z(SU(4, 997)):**\n    The center of SU(n,q) consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^n = 1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1} = 1$. This implies that $\\lambda^{\\gcd(n, q+1)} = 1$. The order of the center is $d = \\gcd(n, q+1)$.\n    For our case, n=4 and q=997.\n    $d = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998)$.\n    $998 = 2 \\times 499$. Since 499 is a prime number, $\\gcd(4, 998) = 2$.\n    So, $|Z|=2$. The elements are roots of $\\lambda^2=1$, so $Z = \\{I, -I\\}$.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the condition $g^2 \\in Z$:**\n    The condition on $g \\in \\tilde{G}$ becomes $g^2 = I$ or $g^2 = -I$.\n\n4.  **Case 1: $g^2 = -I$ (Skew-involutions)**\n    Let g be an element in U(n,q) (a slightly larger group containing SU(n,q)). If $v$ is a non-null eigenvector of $g$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda$, then $\\lambda^{q+1} = 1$.\n    If $g^2 = -I$, then any eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of $g$ must satisfy $\\lambda^2=-1$.\n    Combining these two conditions, we must have $(\\lambda^2)^{(q+1)/2} = (-1)^{(q+1)/2} = \\lambda^{q+1} = 1$.\n    This requires $(q+1)/2$ to be an even integer.\n    For $q=997$, we have $(q+1)/2 = 998/2 = 499$.\n    Since 499 is odd, $(-1)^{499} = -1 \\neq 1$. This is a contradiction.\n    Therefore, there are no elements $g \\in \\text{U}(4, 997)$ (and thus no elements in SU(4, 997)) such that $g^2=-I$.\n\n5.  **Case 2: $g^2 = I$ (Involutions)**\n    We are looking for elements $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that $g^2=I$ and $g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}$. These are the non-central involutions in SU(4, 997).\n    An involution $g$ is diagonalizable, and its eigenvalues must be 1 or -1. Let $k$ be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue -1.\n    Since $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$, its determinant must be 1. $\\det(g) = (-1)^k = 1$, which implies $k$ must be even.\n    *   If $k=0$, $g=I$ (the identity matrix), which is in the center $Z$.\n    *   If $k=4$, $g=-I$, which is also in the center $Z$.\n    *   If $k=2$, the eigenvalues are {1, 1, -1, -1}. Such an element $g$ is not a scalar matrix, so it is not in the center. These are the elements we need to count.\n\n6.  **Conjugacy Classes and Number of Non-Central Involutions:**\n    An involution $g$ with $k=2$ corresponds to a decomposition of the 4-dimensional vector space $V$ into a direct sum of eigenspaces $V = E_1 \\oplus E_{-1}$, where $\\dim(E_1)=2$ and $\\dim(E_{-1})=2$. For $g$ to be a unitary transformation, these subspaces must be non-degenerate and orthogonal.\n    The conjugacy class of such an involution is determined by the isometry type of the eigenspaces. In a 2-dimensional unitary space, there are two isometry types, which we can denote as '+' and '-'.\n    Since the whole space V is of a standard type (let's call it '+'), the types of the subspaces must satisfy type($E_1$) * type($E_{-1}$) = type(V) = '+'. This means type($E_1$) = type($E_{-1}$).\n    This gives two possibilities for the decomposition:\n    a) $E_1$ and $E_{-1}$ are both of type '+'. This defines one conjugacy class, $C_1$.\n    b) $E_1$ and $E_{-1}$ are both of type '-'. This defines a second conjugacy class, $C_2$.\n    The sizes of these conjugacy classes can be calculated using the formula $|C| = |\\tilde{G}|/|C_{\\tilde{G}}(g)|$. The centralizer $C_{\\tilde{G}}(g)$ for $g$ in either class has the same order. A detailed calculation shows that the size of each class is:\n    $|C_1| = |C_2| = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)$.\n    The total number of non-central involutions in SU(4, q) is the sum of the sizes of these two classes:\n    $N_{non-central} = |C_1| + |C_2| = 2q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)$.\n\n7.  **Counting the Involutions in PSU(4, 997):**\n    The set of elements we are counting in PSU(4, 997) is the image of the set of non-central involutions of SU(4, 997) under the quotient map $\\pi: \\tilde{G} \\to G$.\n    This map sends the coset $gZ$ to a single element. Since $|Z|=2$, the map $\\pi$ is 2-to-1 on elements not in the center. Specifically, for any non-central involution $g$, the element $-g$ is also a distinct non-central involution, and they both map to the same element in PSU(4, 997) because $\\pi(g) = gZ$ and $\\pi(-g) = -gZ = g(-1)Z = gZ$.\n    Thus, the total number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is half the number of non-central involutions in SU(4, q).\n    Number of involutions in PSU(4, q) = $N_{non-central} / 2 = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)$.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substituting $q=997$:\n    Number of involutions = $997^4 (997^2 - 997 + 1)(997^2 + 1)$.\n    This expression represents the final count.\n\nThe number of involutions in PSU(4,997) is $997^4(997^2 - 997 + 1)(997^2 + 1)$.\n\n$997^2 = 994009$\n$997^2 - 997 + 1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013$\n$997^2 + 1 = 994010$\n\nFinal Answer = $997^4 \\times 993013 \\times 994010$."
