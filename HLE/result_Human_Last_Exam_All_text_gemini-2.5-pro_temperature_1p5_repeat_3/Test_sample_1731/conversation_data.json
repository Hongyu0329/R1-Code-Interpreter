    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem asks for the equilibrium properties of a photon gas. In statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state consistent with the system's constraints. The principles of large deviation theory (LDT), specifically theorems like Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff, provide a formal mathematical framework for this concept. They state that the probability of observing a macroscopic state that deviates from the most probable (equilibrium) state is exponentially small. Maximizing the Boltzmann entropy is equivalent to finding the state with the minimum large deviation rate function, thus identifying the most probable, or equilibrium, state.\n\n#### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **System Identification**: We are dealing with light quanta (photons). These are bosons, meaning they obey Bose-Einstein statistics.\n2.  **Particle Number Conservation**: Unlike a gas of massive particles, the number of photons in a cavity is not conserved. Photons can be created and absorbed by the walls of the container. In the language of statistical mechanics, this means the chemical potential, $\\mu$, is zero.\n3.  **Energy Constraint**: The system is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings (e.g., the walls of a cavity) at a fixed temperature $T$. This corresponds to a fixed average total energy, $U = \\langle E \\rangle$. The Lagrange multiplier associated with this constraint is $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n4.  **LDT Framework**: The equilibrium distribution is found by maximizing the entropy functional, which corresponds to minimizing the large deviation rate function. The probability of observing a particular macroscopic energy distribution $\\{n_i\\}$ is proportional to the number of microstates $\\Omega(\\{n_i\\})$, and $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. Large deviations from the configuration that maximizes $S$ are exponentially suppressed.\n5.  **Density of States**: To obtain a concrete expression for energy and entropy, we need the density of states $g(\\epsilon)$ for photons in a three-dimensional volume $V$.\n\n---\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: The Entropy and Constraints**\n\nFor bosons distributed among energy levels $\\epsilon_i$ with degeneracy $g_i$, the entropy $S$ is given by the Bose-Einstein formula. Let $n_i$ be the number of particles in level $i$, and $f_i = n_i/g_i$ be the average occupation number.\n\n$S(\\{f_i\\}) = k_B \\sum_i g_i \\left[ (f_i + 1) \\ln(f_i + 1) - f_i \\ln f_i \\right]$\n\nWe want to maximize this entropy subject to a single constraint of fixed mean energy $U$:\n\n$U = \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i = \\sum_i g_i f_i \\epsilon_i$\n\nThere is no constraint on the total particle number, so the chemical potential $\\mu=0$.\n\n**Step 2: Finding the Equilibrium Distribution via Entropy Maximization**\n\nWe use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize $S/k_B$ subject to the energy constraint. We define the functional $\\mathcal{L}$:\n\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{S}{k_B} - \\beta \\left( \\sum_i g_i f_i \\epsilon_i - U \\right) = \\sum_i g_i \\left[ (f_i + 1) \\ln(f_i + 1) - f_i \\ln f_i - \\beta f_i \\epsilon_i \\right] + \\beta U$\n\nTo maximize this, we set the partial derivative with respect to each $f_i$ to zero:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial (\\mathcal{L}/g_i)}{\\partial f_i} = \\left[ \\ln(f_i+1) + 1 \\right] - \\left[ \\ln(f_i) + 1 \\right] - \\beta \\epsilon_i = 0$\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{f_i+1}{f_i}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_i$\n$1 + \\frac{1}{f_i} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i}$\n$\\frac{1}{f_i} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1$\n\nThis gives the equilibrium occupation number, known as the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for photons:\n\n$f_{eq}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1}$\n\nThis distribution represents the most probable macroscopic state. According to Cramer-Chernoff and related LDT results, the probability of observing a significantly different mean energy is exponentially small.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**\n\nTo find the total mean energy $U$, we must sum (or integrate) the energy of all occupied states, weighted by the equilibrium distribution. We replace the sum over discrete levels with an integral over a continuous energy spectrum using the density of states $g(\\epsilon)$.\n\nFor photons in a 3D volume $V$, including two polarization states, the density of states is:\n$g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n\nNow, we can calculate $U$:\n$U = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot f_{eq}(\\epsilon) \\cdot g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} \\cdot \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n$U = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n\nTo solve the integral, we make the substitution $x = \\beta \\epsilon$, so $\\epsilon = x/\\beta$ and $d\\epsilon = dx/\\beta$:\n$U = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{(x/\\beta)^3}{e^x - 1} \\frac{dx}{\\beta} = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(h^3 c^3)\\beta^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\n\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 3! \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n\nSubstituting this value and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$U = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} (k_B T)^4 \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^4$\n\nThis is the famous **Stefan-Boltzmann Law** for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nWe can calculate the entropy by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy formula. However, a more straightforward method is to use the fundamental thermodynamic relation for a photon gas. The pressure $P$ of a photon gas is related to its energy density $u=U/V$ by $P = u/3 = U/(3V)$.\n\nThe general thermodynamic relation is $S = \\frac{U - F}{T}$, where $F$ is the Helmholtz Free Energy. For a system at constant T and V, $dF = -SdT - PdV$. Also, we know $F=U-TS$. For a photon gas, the entropy can be found from the energy and pressure:\n$S = \\frac{U + PV}{T} = \\frac{U + (U/3V)V}{T} = \\frac{U + U/3}{T} = \\frac{4U}{3T}$\n\nNow, we substitute our expression for the equilibrium energy $U$:\n\n$S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^4 \\right] = \\frac{4}{3} \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^3$\n\nThis is the equilibrium entropy of the photon gas.\n\n<<<Mean Energy, $U = \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^4$\nEntropy, $S = \\frac{4}{3} \\left( \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^3$>>>"
