It is essential not to confuse her with other entities or characters he interacts with.\n*   **Confirmation of Marriage:** The question specifically asks about marriage, not just a romantic partnership. The novel explicitly features a marriage ceremony between the two characters.\n\nThe name of the character that the main character marries is Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
