    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\nThe question asks to identify the key difference between a *cambré derrière* (a backward bend) as taught in the Vaganova method and the Balanchine method of classical ballet.\n\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A fundamental ballet movement where the upper body bends backward from the waist, while maintaining proper alignment and support.\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A Russian ballet training system developed by Agrippina Vaganova. It is known for its rigor, precision, and systematic approach, emphasizing core strength, stability, and the harmonious coordination of the entire body.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** A style or technique developed by George Balanchine for his company, the New York City Ballet. It is characterized by speed, athleticism, long lines, and an often more extreme range of motion than traditional classical ballet.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Cambré Derrière**\nThe Vaganova method places a very strong emphasis on stability and control originating from the core.\n\n*   **Execution:** The bend is initiated from the upper back, lifting the chest towards the ceiling.\n*   **Hips:** The hips must remain squarely over the supporting leg(s). They do not push forward. This is a critical rule to protect the lower back and build core strength. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault. The torso bends back, supported entirely by the back and abdominal muscles.\n*   **Head:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back without \"breaking\" the neck.\n*   **Goal:** To build strength in the back and abdominals and to develop a controlled, pure line.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Cambré Derrière**\nThe Balanchine style often seeks a different aesthetic quality, prioritizing a longer, more dramatic line and a dynamic, \"off-balance\" feeling.\n\n*   **Execution:** The bend is often deeper and more sweeping.\n*   **Hips:** To achieve this deeper backbend, the Balanchine style allows and often encourages the dancer to press the hips forward. This forward placement of the hips acts as a counterbalance, enabling the upper body to bend further back. This creates a more dramatic, crescent-like curve in the body.\n*   **Head:** The head follows the line, often with more expressive freedom.\n*   **Goal:** To create a visually striking, elongated line and to achieve a greater range of motion, often for choreographic effect.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Two Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there might be subtle stylistic differences in the hands or arms (e.g., Balanchine's broken wrists), the fundamental principles of arm placement are not the primary distinguishing factor.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most significant and defining difference. Vaganova insists on keeping the hips stable and stacked over the feet. Balanchine allows the hips to press forward to facilitate a deeper bend.\n*   **C. Speed:** Speed is a general characteristic of the Balanchine style, but a cambré in either technique can be performed at various speeds. It is not the defining technical difference of this specific step.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The deeper backbend in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the hip placement, not the fundamental technical difference itself. The allowance of the forward hip placement is what *enables* the greater degree of bend. Therefore, hip placement is the more fundamental cause.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head generally follows the spine. The core principle is the same, even if there are slight stylistic variations. This is not the main point of contrast.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most critical and widely recognized technical difference between a Vaganova cambré derrière and a Balanchine cambré derrière lies in the treatment of the hips. Vaganova technique requires the hips to remain stationary, while the Balanchine style utilizes a forward press of the hips as a counterbalance.\n\n<<<B>>>"
