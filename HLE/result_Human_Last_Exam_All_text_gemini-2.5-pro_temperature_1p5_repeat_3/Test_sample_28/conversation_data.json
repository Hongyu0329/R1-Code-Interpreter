    "An analysis of the question is performed step-by-step to determine the VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Hypothesis Class\nThe hypothesis class is defined as $H_{z-ones}=\\{h:X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$.\n-   **Domain $X$:** A set of points of size $|X| = T$.\n-   **Hypothesis $h$:** A function (a classifier) that maps each point in $X$ to either 0 or 1.\n-   **Constraint:** The crucial part of the definition is that every hypothesis $h$ in this class must label **exactly** $z$ points as 1. Consequently, it must label exactly $T-z$ points as 0.\n-   **Parameters:** $z$ is a positive integer, and $T$ is the size of the domain. For the class to be non-empty, it must be possible to choose $z$ points from $T$, so we assume $1 \\le z \\le T$.\n\n### Step 2: Recalling the Definition of VC Dimension\nThe Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a hypothesis class $H$ is the size of the largest set of points $S \\subseteq X$ that can be **shattered** by $H$. A set $S$ of size $m$ is shattered if for every one of the $2^m$ possible binary labelings of the points in $S$, there is a hypothesis $h \\in H$ that realizes that labeling.\n\n### Step 3: Deriving a Lower Bound for the VC Dimension\nWe want to find the largest number $m$ such that we can shatter *any* set of $m$ points. Let's try to shatter a set $S \\subseteq X$ of size $m$.\nLet $S$ be any set of $m$ points. To shatter $S$, we must be able to realize any labeling of $S$. Consider an arbitrary labeling of $S$ that has $k$ points labeled 1 and $m-k$ points labeled 0, where $0 \\le k \\le m$.\n\nTo realize this labeling with a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$, we need to define $h$ over the entire domain $X$. The hypothesis must satisfy:\n1.  It assigns 1 to the $k$ specified points in $S$.\n2.  It assigns 0 to the other $m-k$ points in $S$.\n3.  The total number of points in $X$ labeled 1 by $h$ is exactly $z$.\n\nFrom points 1 and 3, this means we must label an additional $z-k$ points as 1. These points must come from outside $S$, i.e., from the set $X \\setminus S$. The number of points available in $X \\setminus S$ is $T-m$.\nSo, we must be able to choose $z-k$ points from the $T-m$ points in $X \\setminus S$. This is possible if and only if the number of points we need to choose is between 0 and the number of points available:\n$0 \\le z-k \\le T-m$\n\nFor the set $S$ to be shattered, this condition must hold for **all** possible values of $k$, from $k=0$ (all zeros labeling) to $k=m$ (all ones labeling).\nLet's analyze the two inequalities:\n1.  $z-k \\ge 0 \\implies k \\le z$. This must hold for all $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, m\\}$. The most stringent requirement is for the largest $k$, which is $k=m$. So we must have $m \\le z$.\n2.  $z-k \\le T-m \\implies m+z-T \\le k$. This must hold for all $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, m\\}$. The most stringent requirement is for the smallest $k$, which is $k=0$. So we must have $m+z-T \\le 0 \\implies m \\le T-z$.\n\nTo shatter a set of size $m$, we need both conditions to be met: $m \\le z$ and $m \\le T-z$. This is equivalent to saying $m \\le \\min(z, T-z)$.\nThis shows that we can shatter any set of size $m = \\min(z, T-z)$. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n**VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\ge \\min(z, T-z)$**.\n\n### Step 4: Deriving an Upper Bound for the VC Dimension\nNow we show that no set of size $m = \\min(z, T-z) + 1$ can be shattered. To do this, we just need to find one set of this size and one labeling that cannot be realized by any hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$.\n\nLet $d = \\min(z, T-z)$. We will try to shatter a set $S$ of size $d+1$. We consider two cases based on which term in the minimum is smaller.\n\n**Case 1: $z \\le T-z$ (which means $z \\le T/2$).**\nIn this case, $d = z$. Let's consider a set $S$ of size $d+1 = z+1$.\nConsider the labeling for $S$ where all $z+1$ points are labeled 1. To realize this labeling, we would need a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that assigns 1 to all points in $S$. But this means $h$ would have to label at least $z+1$ points as 1. This contradicts the definition of the class $H_{z-ones}$, where every hypothesis must label **exactly** $z$ points as 1. Thus, this labeling cannot be realized. Therefore, a set of size $z+1$ cannot be shattered.\n\n**Case 2: $z > T-z$ (which means $z > T/2$).**\nIn this case, $d = T-z$. Let's consider a set $S$ of size $d+1 = T-z+1$.\nConsider the labeling for $S$ where all $T-z+1$ points are labeled 0. To realize this labeling, a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ must assign 0 to all points in $S$. By definition, $h$ must label exactly $z$ points in the entire domain $X$ as 1. Since all points in $S$ are labeled 0, these $z$ points must be chosen from the complement set $X \\setminus S$.\nThe size of this complement set is $|X \\setminus S| = |X| - |S| = T - (T-z+1) = z-1$.\nSo, to realize the all-zeros labeling on $S$, we need to choose $z$ points to label 1 from a set of available points of size $z-1$. This is impossible. Thus, this labeling cannot be realized. Therefore, a set of size $T-z+1$ cannot be shattered.\n\nIn both cases, we have shown that any set of size $d+1 = \\min(z, T-z)+1$ cannot be shattered. This establishes that the VC dimension is at most $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n**VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le \\min(z, T-z)$**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nCombining the lower and upper bounds:\n-   From Step 3: VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\ge \\min(z, T-z)$\n-   From Step 4: VCdim($H_{z-ones}$) $\\le \\min(z, T-z)$\n\nTherefore, the VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ is exactly $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n1.  **Strict Equality:** The definition $| \\{x: h(x)=1\\} |=z$ is a strict equality, not an inequality. This is the key constraint.\n2.  **Shattering Requires All Labelings:** To prove a set is shattered, one must show that *all* $2^m$ possible labelings can be generated.\n3.  **Proving an Upper Bound:** To prove an upper bound $d$, one only needs to find *one* specific set of size $d+1$ and *one* specific labeling of it that the hypothesis class cannot generate.\n4.  **Case Analysis:** The expression $\\min(z, T-z)$ naturally partitions the problem into two cases: $z \\le T/2$ and $z > T/2$. The proofs for the upper bound must consider both scenarios.\n5.  **Feasibility of Choosing Points:** The core of the lower bound proof relies on the condition $0 \\le z-k \\le T-m$, which ensures that we can always select the required number of positive labels from the points outside the set being shattered.\n6.  **Implicit Assumptions:** The problem implicitly assumes $1 \\le z \\le T$, as otherwise the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ would be empty, and its VC dimension would be 0. The formula $\\min(z, T-z)$ correctly evaluates to 0 for the edge cases $z=T$ (where $\\min(T, 0)=0$) and could be taken to be 0 if $z=0$ were allowed.\n\n<<<min(z, T-z)>>>"
