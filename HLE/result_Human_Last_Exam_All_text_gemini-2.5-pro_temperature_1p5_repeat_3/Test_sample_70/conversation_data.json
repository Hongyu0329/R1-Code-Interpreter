    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Matrix Representation and Rank\n\n*   **Matrix Representation:** A flag is viewed as a matrix where each distinct color is represented by a unique numerical value.\n*   **\"Maximal Rank\" Assumption:** The phrase \"values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal\" implies that we should assign numerical values to the colors in a way that avoids accidental linear dependencies. For example, if a flag has colors Red (R), White (W), and Blue (B), we should not choose values like R=1, W=2, B=3 (since 3 = 1+2). Instead, we treat the color values as abstract, linearly independent entities.\n*   **Calculating Rank:** The rank of the matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). A simplified way to find this is to count the number of unique \"row patterns\" and then determine how many of them are linearly independent.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Visual Description:** The Danish flag has a red field with a white Nordic cross (an off-center cross).\n2.  **Row Patterns:** When viewed as a matrix, the flag has only two distinct types of rows:\n    *   **Pattern 1 (P1):** A mostly red row with a white segment where the vertical part of the cross passes through. (e.g., a vector like `(R, R, W, R, R, R)`)\n    *   **Pattern 2 (P2):** An all-white row for the horizontal bar of the cross. (e.g., a vector like `(W, W, W, W, W, W)`)\n3.  **Linear Independence:**\n    *   Let `r` and `w` be the numerical values for Red and White. By the \"maximal rank\" assumption, `r ≠ w`, and both are non-zero.\n    *   The vector for P2 is a multiple of the vector `(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)`.\n    *   The vector for P1 is not a multiple of `(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)` because it contains two different values, `r` and `w`.\n    *   Therefore, the two row patterns are linearly independent.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The row space of the Danish flag's matrix is spanned by these two linearly independent vectors. Thus, the rank of the flag of Denmark is **2**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze African Flags to Find Rank 2 Flags\n\nWe need to find African flags whose matrix representation has a rank of 2.\n\n**Flags with Rank 1:**\n*   **Structure:** Flags composed of only horizontal or only vertical solid-colored bands.\n*   **Reasoning:** In a flag with only horizontal bands (e.g., Gabon, Sierra Leone), every row is a solid color. A row of red is `r * (1, 1, ..., 1)`, and a row of green is `g * (1, 1, ..., 1)`. All such rows are scalar multiples of the vector `(1, 1, ..., 1)` and are therefore linearly dependent on each other. They span a 1-dimensional space. The rank is 1. The same logic applies to flags with only vertical bands (e.g., Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire) when considering columns.\n*   **Examples:** Botswana, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Mauritius, Nigeria, Sierra Leone.\n\n**Flags with Rank > 2:**\n*   **Structure:** Flags with complex geometric shapes like diagonal lines, triangles pointing from the hoist, or intricate emblems.\n*   **Reasoning:** These features create many unique row patterns that are not simple multiples of each other or other patterns. For example, a diagonal line means that almost every row in the flag is a unique pattern, leading to a very high rank. A complex emblem also introduces many new, linearly independent rows.\n*   **Examples:** South Africa (Y-shape), Tanzania (diagonal), Djibouti (triangle), Somalia (the star creates at least 3 independent patterns), Kenya (the central shield is complex).\n\n**Flags with Rank 2:**\nWe are looking for flags whose row patterns span exactly a 2-dimensional space. This typically happens in two scenarios:\n\n**Scenario A: Two Unique, Linearly Independent Row Patterns**\n*   **Structure:** A flag with a vertical band at the hoist and two horizontal bands on the fly.\n*   **Flags:**\n    *   **Madagascar:** A vertical white band with horizontal red-over-green bands. The two row patterns are `(W, W, R, R, R)` and `(W, W, G, G, G)`. These are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n    *   **Benin:** A vertical green band with horizontal yellow-over-red bands. The logic is identical to Madagascar. The rank is 2.\n\n**Scenario B: More than Two Patterns that Span a 2D Space**\n*   **Structure:** A flag with horizontal (or vertical) bands where one band has a simple, centered emblem (like a star or circle).\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    1.  The plain, solid-color rows are all linearly dependent (they are multiples of `(1, 1, ..., 1)`), contributing 1 to the rank.\n    2.  The rows that cut through the simple emblem have a different pattern (e.g., `(R, R, Y, R, R)` for a red stripe with a yellow star). This pattern is not a multiple of `(1, 1, ..., 1)` and is thus linearly independent of the plain rows.\n    3.  If the emblem is simple and centered, all rows containing the emblem are often linearly dependent on the first emblem row and the plain row type. However, for a simple analysis, it's sufficient that we have two independent groups of patterns: the plain bands and the band-with-emblem. These span a 2D space.\n*   **Flags:**\n    *   **Burkina Faso:** Horizontal red-over-green with a central yellow star. The patterns are (plain red), (red with star), and (plain green). The plain rows are dependent. The \"red with star\" pattern is independent of them. Rank = 2.\n    *   **Ghana:** Horizontal red-yellow-green with a central black star on the yellow stripe. Same logic as Burkina Faso. Rank = 2.\n    *   **Niger:** Horizontal orange-white-green with a central orange circle on the white stripe. Same logic. Rank = 2.\n    *   **Mauritania:** Red-green-red horizontal bands with a central gold crescent and star on the green band. Same logic. Rank = 2.\n    *   **Senegal:** Vertical green-yellow-red bands with a central green star on the yellow stripe. The same logic applies to the columns. Rank = 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe flags of African nations that have a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark, are:\n*   Benin\n*   Burkina Faso\n*   Ghana\n*   Madagascar\n*   Mauritania\n*   Niger\n*   Senegal\n\n<<<Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Madagascar, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal>>>"
