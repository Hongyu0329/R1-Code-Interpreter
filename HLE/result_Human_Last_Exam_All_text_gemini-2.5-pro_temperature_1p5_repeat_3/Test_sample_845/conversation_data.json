    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Input:**\n    *   \"HR and HRV were tracked...\": This sets the context. We are discussing Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   \"...by capturing beat-to-beat intervals...\": This tells us how the data is collected. The fundamental piece of data is the time *between* each heartbeat.\n    *   \"...by using PPG.\": This specifies the technology used, which is Photoplethysmography (common in smartwatches and fitness trackers). It detects blood volume changes, and the peaks in its signal correspond to heartbeats.\n    *   \"HRV is computed as a value between heartbeats.\": This re-emphasizes that HRV is not the heartbeat itself, but a calculation based on the time interval separating consecutive heartbeats.\n    *   \"What is that value called?\": This is the core question. It asks for the technical name of the time interval between two consecutive heartbeats.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **HR vs. HRV:** It is crucial not to confuse Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HR is the average number of beats per minute. HRV is the measure of the *variation* in the time *between* those beats. The question is about the fundamental unit used to calculate HRV.\n2.  **Raw Data vs. Computed Metric:** HRV itself is a computed statistical metric (e.g., RMSSD, SDNN). The question is not asking for one of these metrics, but for the name of the raw data point from which they are calculated â€“ the \"value between heartbeats\".\n3.  **Technology Terminology (ECG vs. PPG):**\n    *   The gold standard for measuring heart activity is the Electrocardiogram (ECG). In an ECG waveform, the most prominent spike of a normal heartbeat is called the \"R wave\". Therefore, the time interval between two consecutive R waves is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   The question mentions PPG, where peaks in the signal correspond to heartbeats. The interval between these peaks is technically called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** or sometimes the Peak-to-Peak interval (PP-interval).\n    *   However, because HRV research was founded on ECG data, the term **R-R interval** is ubiquitously used in the scientific and medical literature as the standard term for the beat-to-beat interval, regardless of whether it was measured by ECG or PPG.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  The question asks for the name of the time value measured between heartbeats.\n2.  This time value is the duration from one heartbeat to the next, typically measured in milliseconds (ms).\n3.  This duration is the fundamental input for all HRV calculations.\n4.  The most common and standard term for this interval, originating from ECG terminology but widely adopted for all HRV measurement methods including PPG, is the **R-R interval**.\n5.  An alternative and equally correct term, especially in a PPG-specific context, is the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n6.  Given its universal acceptance in the field of HRV, \"R-R interval\" is the most precise and recognized answer.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
