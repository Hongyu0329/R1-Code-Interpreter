    "This problem asks for the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the equation using modular arithmetic.\nWe analyze the equation modulo 8. The square of an integer, $x^2$, can only take values 0, 1, or 4 modulo 8.\n- If $x$ is a multiple of 4 ($x=4k$), then $x^2 = 16k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\n- If $x$ is even but not a multiple of 4 ($x=4k+2$), then $x^2 = (4k+2)^2 = 16k^2+16k+4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$.\n- If $x$ is odd ($x=2k+1$), then $x^2 = 4k(k+1)+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$ since $k(k+1)$ is always even.\n\nThe sum is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$.\nSince $2024 = 8 \\times 253$, we have $2024 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$.\nSo, the sum of five squares must be congruent to 0 modulo 8. Let $n_0, n_1, n_4$ be the number of terms congruent to 0, 1, and 4 (mod 8) respectively. We have:\n$n_0+n_1+n_4=5$\n$0 \\cdot n_0 + 1 \\cdot n_1 + 4 \\cdot n_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$\n\nThis leads to $n_1 + 4n_4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$. We test the possible values for $n_1, n_4$ (non-negative integers summing to at most 5):\n- If $n_4=0$, $n_1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$. So $n_1=0$. This implies $n_0=5$. All five $x_i$ must be multiples of 4. Let $x_i=4y_i$. The equation becomes $\\sum(4y_i)^2 = 16\\sum y_i^2 = 2024$, which gives $\\sum y_i^2 = 2024/16 = 126.5$, not an integer. So this case is impossible.\n- If $n_4=1$, $n_1+4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$, so $n_1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$. As $n_1 \\le 4$, we have $n_1=4$. Then $n_0=5-1-4=0$. This is a valid case. It means one $x_i^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$ and four $x_i^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. This corresponds to one variable being of the form $4k+2$ and four variables being odd. Let's call this **Type 1**.\n- If $n_4=2$, $n_1+8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$, so $n_1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$, which means $n_1=0$. Then $n_0=5-2-0=3$. This is a valid case. It means two $x_i^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$ and three $x_i^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$. This corresponds to two variables of the form $4k+2$ and three of the form $4k$. Let's call this **Type 2**.\n- If $n_4=3$, $n_1+12 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$, so $n_1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 8$. Then $n_1=4$. $n_0+n_1+n_4 = n_0+4+3=7>5$. Impossible.\n- If $n_4=4$, $n_1+16 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$, so $n_1=0$. Then $n_0=1$. This corresponds to one variable of type $4k$ and four of type $4k+2$. Let's check this: $x_1=4y_1, x_{2,3,4,5}=4y_i+2$. $(4y_1)^2 + \\sum_{i=2}^5(4y_i+2)^2 = 16y_1^2 + \\sum(16y_i^2+16y_i+4) = 16(y_1^2+\\sum(y_i(y_i+1)))+16=2024$. This leads to $16(...)=2008$, and $2008/16=125.5$, not an integer. Impossible.\n- Higher values for $n_4$ are also impossible.\n\nSo, any non-negative integer solution $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ must be of one of two types:\n- **Type 1:** Four of the numbers are odd, and one is of the form $4k+2$.\n- **Type 2:** Three of the numbers are multiples of 4, and two are of the form $4k+2$.\n\n### Step 2: Find the sets of values for the solutions.\nWe need to find all unordered sets of 5 non-negative integers $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ that satisfy the equation. This can be done by a careful search, starting from the largest possible values. The maximum value for any $x_i$ is $\\lfloor\\sqrt{2024}\\rfloor = 44$.\n\nHere is a list of the unique sets of non-negative integers that sum to 2024 when squared:\n1.  **{44, 8, 4, 2, 2}**: (Type 2: 44,8,4 are 4k; 2,2 are 4k+2)\n2.  **{44, 6, 6, 4, 0}**: (Type 2: 44,4,0 are 4k; 6,6 are 4k+2)\n3.  **{43, 13, 2, 1, 1}**: (Type 1: 43,13,1,1 odd; 2 is 4k+2)\n4.  **{43, 11, 7, 2, 1}**: (Type 1: 43,11,7,1 odd; 2 is 4k+2)\n5.  **{43, 10, 5, 5, 5}**: (Type 1: 43,5,5,5 odd; 10 is 4k+2)\n6.  **{43, 9, 9, 3, 2}**: (Type 1: 43,9,9,3 odd; 2 is 4k+2)\n7.  **{42, 16, 2, 0, 0}**: (Type 2: 16,0,0 are 4k; 42,2 are 4k+2)\n8.  **{42, 15, 5, 3, 1}**: (Type 1: 15,5,3,1 odd; 42 is 4k+2)\n9.  **{42, 14, 8, 0, 0}**: (Type 2: 8,0,0 are 4k; 42,14 are 4k+2)\n10. **{42, 13, 9, 3, 1}**: (Type 1: 13,9,3,1 odd; 42 is 4k+2)\n11. **{42, 12, 10, 4, 0}**: (Type 2: 12,4,0 are 4k; 42,10 are 4k+2)\n12. **{42, 12, 8, 6, 4}**: (Type 2: 12,8,4 are 4k; 42,6 are 4k+2)\n13. **{41, 17, 5, 5, 2}**: (Type 1: 41,17,5,5 odd; 2 is 4k+2)\n14. **{40, 20, 4, 2, 2}**: (Type 2: 40,20,4 are 4k; 2,2 are 4k+2)\n15. **{39, 21, 7, 3, 2}**: (Type 1: 39,21,7,3 odd; 2 is 4k+2)\n16. **{38, 24, 2, 0, 0}**: (Type 2: 24,0,0 are 4k; 38,2 are 4k+2)\n17. **{38, 23, 7, 1, 1}**: (Type 1: 23,7,1,1 odd; 38 is 4k+2)\n18. **{38, 22, 8, 4, 4}**: (Type 2: 8,4,4 are 4k; 38,22 are 4k+2)\n19. **{38, 20, 10, 8, 4}**: (Type 2: 20,8,4 are 4k; 38,10 are 4k+2)\n20. **{38, 18, 16, 0, 0}**: (Type 2: 16,0,0 are 4k; 38,18 are 4k+2)\n21. **{37, 22, 13, 1, 1}**: (Type 1: 37,13,1,1 odd; 22 is 4k+2)\n22. **{35, 26, 11, 1, 1}**: (Type 1: 35,11,1,1 odd; 26 is 4k+2)\n23. **{34, 29, 5, 1, 1}**: (Type 1: 29,5,1,1 odd; 34 is 4k+2)\n24. **{33, 30, 5, 3, 1}**: (Type 1: 33,5,3,1 odd; 30 is 4k+2)\n25. **{24, 20, 20, 18, 18}**: (Type 2: 24,20,20 are 4k; 18,18 are 4k+2)\n26. **{23, 23, 22, 19, 11}**: (Type 1: 23,23,19,11 odd; 22 is 4k+2)\n27. **{23, 22, 19, 19, 17}**: (Type 1: 23,19,19,17 odd; 22 is 4k+2)\n28. **{23, 21, 21, 18, 17}**: (Type 1: 23,21,21,17 odd; 18 is 4k+2)\n29. **{22, 22, 20, 20, 16}**: (Type 2: 20,20,16 are 4k; 22,22 are 4k+2)\nThis list contains 29 unique sets of solutions.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of ordered solutions (permutations for each set).\nFor each set of values, we calculate the number of distinct permutations.\n- If all 5 values in the set are distinct (e.g., {a,b,c,d,e}), the number of permutations is $5! = 120$.\n- If there is one pair of repeated values (e.g., {a,a,b,c,d}), the number of permutations is $5!/2! = 60$.\n- If there are two pairs of repeated values (e.g., {a,a,b,b,c}), the number of permutations is $5!/(2!2!) = 30$.\n- If there is one triple of repeated values (e.g., {a,a,a,b,c}), the number of permutations is $5!/3! = 20$.\n\nLet's categorize the 29 sets and sum their permutations:\n-   **All distinct (8 sets):** {43,11,7,2,1}, {42,15,5,3,1}, {42,13,9,3,1}, {42,12,10,4,0}, {42,12,8,6,4}, {39,21,7,3,2}, {38,20,10,8,4}, {33,30,5,3,1}.\n    Number of solutions: $8 \\times 120 = 960$.\n-   **One pair (18 sets):** {44,8,4,2,2}, {44,6,6,4,0}, {43,13,2,1,1}, {43,9,9,3,2}, {42,16,2,0,0}, {42,14,8,0,0}, {41,17,5,5,2}, {40,20,4,2,2}, {38,24,2,0,0}, {38,23,7,1,1}, {38,22,8,4,4}, {38,18,16,0,0}, {37,22,13,1,1}, {35,26,11,1,1}, {34,29,5,1,1}, {23,23,22,19,11}, {23,22,19,19,17}, {23,21,21,18,17}.\n    Number of solutions: $18 \\times 60 = 1080$.\n-   **Two pairs (2 sets):** {24,20,20,18,18}, {22,22,20,20,16}.\n    Number of solutions: $2 \\times 30 = 60$.\n-   **One triple (1 set):** {43,10,5,5,5}.\n    Number of solutions: $1 \\times 20 = 20$.\n\nThe total number of non-negative integer solutions is the sum of these counts.\nTotal = $960 + 1080 + 60 + 20 = 2120$."
