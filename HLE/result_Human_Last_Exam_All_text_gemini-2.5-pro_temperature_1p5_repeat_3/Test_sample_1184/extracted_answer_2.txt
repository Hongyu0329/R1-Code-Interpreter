Here are the exact residues from the human beta-1 subunit (Î²1b isoform, UniProt: P54289) that serve as hotspots for interaction and gating modulation of the alpha-1 subunit.

**1) Hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues form the core hydrophobic binding pocket within the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain that binds directly to the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit.

*   **Y382** (Tyrosine at position 382)
*   **L427** (Leucine at position 427)
*   **V430** (Valine at position 430)
*   **W440** (Tryptophan at position 440)
*   **F443** (Phenylalanine at position 443)
*   **M459** (Methionine at position 459)
*   **I463** (Isoleucine at position 463)

**2) Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (gating modulation) of the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are critical for the functional effects of the beta-1 subunit on channel activity, such as shifting voltage-dependence or altering inactivation kinetics.

*   **K3** (Lysine at position 3) and **K4** (Lysine at position 4): Located in the N-terminus, these residues are important for modulating the voltage-dependence of activation.
*   **D244** (Aspartic Acid at position 244) and **E245** (Glutamic Acid at position 245): Located in the SH3 domain, these residues are involved in modulating channel inactivation kinetics.
*   **S480** (Serine at position 480): Located near the C-terminus, this residue is a key modulator of the channel's sensitivity to inhibition by G-proteins.
