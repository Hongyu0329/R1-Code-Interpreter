    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Second Great War and its start point.**\nThe conflict referred to as the Second Great War (also known as the End War) is the primary narrative arc of the *StarCraft II* trilogy. It begins with the resurgence of large-scale Zerg attacks on Terran Dominion worlds. According to the official StarCraft lore timeline, this kicks off the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*.\n*   **Start Event:** Renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, specifically targeting Dominion worlds like Mar Sara.\n*   **Start Year:** **2504**\n\n**Step 2: Define the end point of the war.**\nThe war concludes with the final defeat of the primary antagonist, the dark god Amon. This happens after the Protoss, Terran, and Zerg forces unite and pursue Amon into the Void itself. This is depicted in the epilogue campaign of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void*, titled *Into the Void*.\n*   **End Event:** The final destruction of Amon's host form within the Void by the combined Daelaam, Dominion, and Zerg Swarm forces.\n*   **End Year:** **2508**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total duration.**\nThe war started in the year 2504 and ended in the year 2508. To calculate the duration, we need to consider the years the conflict was active:\n*   Year 1: 2504 (*Wings of Liberty*)\n*   Year 2: 2505 (*Heart of the Swarm*)\n*   Year 3: 2506 (*Legacy of the Void* begins)\n*   Year 4: 2507 (*Legacy of the Void* continues)\n*   Year 5: 2508 (*Epilogue: Into the Void*, the war concludes)\n\nThe conflict spans across five different calendar years. While the exact duration isn't a precise number of days, the lore makes it clear that the events cover a period of slightly more than four full years.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the \"rounded up\" rule.**\nThe question requires the duration to be in years, rounded up.\n*   The actual duration is between 4 and 5 years.\n*   Rounding up any value greater than 4.0 results in 5.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Defining the War:** The term \"Second Great War\" is a community and lore-accepted name for the conflict in *StarCraft II*. Its start and end are tied directly to the events of the game campaigns, not a formal declaration and treaty signing.\n2.  **Timeline Specificity:** StarCraft lore primarily uses years, not specific dates (month/day), for major events. Therefore, we must work with the understanding that the war started at some point *during* 2504 and ended at some point *during* 2508.\n3.  **The \"Rounding Up\" Clause is Crucial:** A simple subtraction (2508 - 2504 = 4) would be inaccurate. Because the war spans *across* five separate years, its total length is necessarily greater than 4. The instruction to round up clarifies how to handle this duration that is not a neat integer.\n4.  **In-Universe Time:** The calculation is based on the established in-universe timeline of the StarCraft lore, not the real-world release dates of the games.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe Second Great War began in 2504 and concluded in 2508. This means the war was ongoing during parts or all of five consecutive years. This results in a total duration of just over four years. Rounding this figure up to the nearest whole year gives a final answer of 5 years.\n\n<<<5>>>"
