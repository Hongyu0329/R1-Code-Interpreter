    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(3).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a(n)**\n\n*   The problem defines `a(n)` as the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of a specific type.\n*   **Type of diagrams:** Diagrams for the electron or the photon propagators. In the language of quantum field theory, these are the one-particle-irreducible (1PI) self-energy diagrams for the electron and photon, respectively. It is a known fact in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) that the number of these diagrams is the same for both the electron and the photon at any given order.\n*   **Order of diagrams:** The order is `2n`. The order in QED is determined by the power of the fine-structure constant, which is related to the number of vertices in the diagram. An order `2n` diagram has `2n` vertices.\n*   **Non-vanishing:** This condition ensures we only count diagrams that contribute to the physical quantity. For these types of diagrams, the standard topologies are non-vanishing.\n\n**Step 2: Relate `a(n)` to the loop expansion**\n\nThe order `2n` corresponds to the number of vertices. The number of loops `L` in a connected diagram is given by Euler's formula for graphs: `L = I - V + 1`, where `I` is the number of internal lines and `V` is the number of vertices. For QED self-energy diagrams, it turns out that a diagram of order `2n` (i.e., `V=2n` vertices) has `L=n` loops.\n*   `n=1` -> order 2 -> 1-loop diagrams.\n*   `n=2` -> order 4 -> 2-loop diagrams.\n*   `n=3` -> order 6 -> 3-loop diagrams.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the specific value required**\n\nThe question asks for `a(3)`. Based on our analysis in Step 2, this corresponds to finding the number of 3-loop (order 6) non-vanishing 1PI self-energy diagrams in QED.\n\n**Step 4: Count the diagrams for n=1, n=2, and n=3**\n\nThe counting of Feynman diagrams is a well-established problem in theoretical physics. We can list the results for the first few values of `n`.\n\n*   **For n=1 (order 2, 1-loop):**\n    *   There is only one possible topology for a 1-loop correction to a propagator.\n    *   For the electron propagator, an electron emits and reabsorbs a photon.\n    *   For the photon propagator, a photon splits into a virtual electron-positron pair, which then annihilates back into a photon.\n    *   In both cases, there is just one diagram. So, `a(1) = 1`.\n\n*   **For n=2 (order 4, 2-loops):**\n    *   The calculation becomes more complex, but it has been shown that there are two distinct diagram topologies.\n    *   So, `a(2) = 2`.\n\n*   **For n=3 (order 6, 3-loops):**\n    *   This is the value we need. Enumerating these diagrams by hand is difficult and prone to error.\n    *   We rely on the established results from the physics literature (for example, the work of D.J. Broadhurst and D. Kreimer). These sources have systematically enumerated these diagrams.\n    *   The result is that there are exactly seven distinct, non-vanishing, 1PI diagrams for the QED propagators at the 3-loop level.\n    *   So, `a(3) = 7`.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final answer**\n\nThe sequence `a(n)` is known in mathematical physics and is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The terms are:\n*   `a(1) = 1`\n*   `a(2) = 2`\n*   `a(3) = 7`\n*   `a(4) = 34`\n*   ...\n\nTherefore, the value of `a(3)` is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
