    "### Step-by-step analysis of the problem\n\n1.  **Understand the input**: We are given a vector field $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This vector field is a unit vector, meaning $|\\mathbf{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. This means that for every point $(x,y,z)$ in our 3D space, the vector field gives us a point on the surface of a unit sphere, $S^2$. The problem asks for the Hopf charge of this field configuration.\n\n2.  **Define the mapping**: The vector field is constructed as follows:\n    *   $f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)$: This is the azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$, where $x = \\rho \\cos\\phi, y = \\rho \\sin\\phi$. So, $f=\\phi$. This angle ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n    *   $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2+z^2} = \\sqrt{(\\rho^2-0.5)^2+z^2}$: This is a distance-like variable. It depends only on the cylindrical radius $\\rho$ and the height $z$.\n    *   $G = \\pi \\cdot \\exp(-10 \\cdot r_2)$: This will be the polar angle on the sphere $S^2$. Since $r_2 \\ge 0$, $G$ ranges from a maximum value down to 0.\n    *   $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z) = (\\sin(G)\\cos(f), \\sin(G)\\sin(f), \\cos(G))$: This is the standard spherical coordinate representation of a unit vector, with polar angle $G$ and azimuthal angle $f$.\n\n3.  **Understand the Hopf Charge**: The Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological invariant that characterizes maps from the 3-sphere ($S^3$) to the 2-sphere ($S^2$).\n    *   Our map is from $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to $S^2$. To define a Hopf charge, the map must behave consistently at infinity. We need to check the value of $\\mathbf{n}$ as $(x,y,z) \\to \\infty$.\n    *   As the distance from the origin goes to infinity, $\\rho^2+z^2 \\to \\infty$, which implies $r_2 \\to \\infty$.\n    *   Then, $G = \\pi \\cdot e^{-10 \\cdot r_2} \\to \\pi \\cdot e^{-\\infty} = 0$.\n    *   As $G \\to 0$, the vector field becomes $\\mathbf{n} \\to (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)$.\n    *   Since the vector field approaches a constant vector at all points at infinity, we can think of the point at infinity in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as being mapped to a single point $(0,0,1)$ on $S^2$. This makes the map a well-defined continuous function from the one-point compactification of $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (which is topologically an $S^3$) to $S^2$. Thus, it has a well-defined Hopf charge.\n\n4.  **Topological Method for Calculating Hopf Charge**: For fields with axial symmetry, like the one given, the Hopf charge can be determined by a simpler formula: $Q_H = m \\cdot n$.\n    *   $m$ is the winding number of the azimuthal part of the map. Our map uses $f = \\phi$, the standard cylindrical angle. As we go around the z-axis once (e.g., a circle in the xy-plane), the angle $f$ changes by $2\\pi$. This corresponds to one full wrap around the equator of the target sphere $S^2$. So, the azimuthal winding number is $m=1$.\n    *   $n$ is the winding number of the poloidal part of the map. This is the degree of the map defined by the profile function $G(\\rho, z)$. This map takes the poloidal plane (the $(\\rho,z)$ half-plane, with $\\rho \\ge 0$) and maps it to the polar angle $G$ on the sphere.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Poloidal Winding Number ($n$)**:\n    *   The domain for the poloidal map is the half-plane $(\\rho, z)$ where $\\rho \\ge 0$. Compactifying this domain (by adding a point at infinity) makes it topologically equivalent to a disk $D^2$, whose boundary is the z-axis ($\\rho=0$) and the points at infinity.\n    *   Let's check the values of $G$ on the boundary of this domain:\n        *   At infinity ($\\rho\\to\\infty$ or $|z|\\to\\infty$), we already found $G=0$.\n        *   On the z-axis ($\\rho=0$), $r_2 = \\sqrt{(-0.5)^2 + z^2} = \\sqrt{0.25+z^2}$. As $z$ goes from $-\\infty$ to $0$ to $+\\infty$, $r_2$ goes from $\\infty$ to $0.5$ to $\\infty$. Correspondingly, $G$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi e^{-5}$ and back to $0$.\n    *   So, the entire boundary of our disk-like domain is mapped to values of $G$ near 0. Essentially, the boundary maps to a single point in the target space (the North Pole, where $G=0$).\n    *   Now, let's find the range of $G$ in the interior of the domain. $G$ is maximized when $r_2$ is minimized. The minimum value of $r_2 = \\sqrt{(\\rho^2-0.5)^2+z^2}$ is $0$. This occurs when $z=0$ and $\\rho^2-0.5=0$, i.e., $\\rho=1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n    *   At this point $(\\rho,z) = (1/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, the value of $G$ is $G_{max} = \\pi \\cdot e^0 = \\pi$. This corresponds to the South Pole of the target sphere $S^2$.\n    *   The map $G(\\rho, z)$ takes the domain (a topological sphere) and maps it to the target (also a topological sphere generated by the polar angle $G$). The boundary of the domain maps to the North Pole, while an interior point maps to the South Pole. The map covers the entire range of $G$ from $0$ to $\\pi$ exactly once.\n    *   Such a map has a topological degree (winding number) of $n = \\pm 1$. The sign depends on orientation. A common convention for this winding number is given by $n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} (G_{center} - G_{boundary})$. Using $G_{center}=\\pi$ (value at the core of the structure) and $G_{boundary}=0$ (value at infinity), we get $n = (\\pi-0)/\\pi = 1$. This indicates that the map preserves orientation. So, $n=1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Hopf Charge**:\n    *   Using the formula $Q_H = m \\cdot n$, we have $m=1$ and $n=1$.\n    *   Therefore, the Hopf charge is $Q_H = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\n7.  **Alternative verification (Linking Number)**:\n    *   The Hopf charge can also be understood as the linking number of the preimages of two regular points on the target sphere $S^2$.\n    *   Let's choose the South Pole, $\\mathbf{p}_S=(0,0,-1)$, and a point on the equator, e.g., $\\mathbf{p}_E=(1,0,0)$.\n    *   The preimage of $\\mathbf{p}_S$ is the set of points where $\\mathbf{n}=(0,0,-1)$. This requires $\\cos(G)=-1$, so $G=\\pi$. This happens when $r_2=0$, which gives the circle $C_S: x^2+y^2 = 0.5, z=0$.\n    *   The preimage of $\\mathbf{p}_E$ is the set of points where $\\mathbf{n}=(1,0,0)$. This requires $\\cos(G)=0$ ($G=\\pi/2$) and $f=0$.\n        *   $f=0$ means $y=0$ and $x>0$.\n        *   $G=\\pi/2$ means $\\pi e^{-10 r_2}=\\pi/2$, so $r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\n        *   Substituting $y=0$ into the formula for $r_2$, we get the curve $C_E: (x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$, restricted to the half-plane $y=0, x>0$. This is a closed loop in the xz-plane.\n    *   To find the linking number, we check if $C_S$ pierces the surface bounded by $C_E$. $C_S$ is a circle in the xy-plane and it intersects the xz-plane at $x=\\pm 1/\\sqrt{2}$. The loop $C_E$ lies in the xz-plane. We check if the piercing point $(x,z)=(1/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ is inside the loop $C_E$.\n    *   The x-intercepts of $C_E$ are at $x=\\sqrt{0.5 \\pm \\ln(2)/10}$.\n    *   Since $\\ln(2)/10 \\approx 0.0693$, the x-intercepts are at $x \\approx \\sqrt{0.5 \\pm 0.0693}$, which are approx. $0.656$ and $0.755$.\n    *   The piercing point is at $x=1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.707$. Since $0.656 < 0.707 < 0.755$, the point is inside the loop $C_E$.\n    *   This confirms that the two preimage curves are linked. Since the piercing happens once, the magnitude of the linking number is 1. This matches the result from the winding number analysis.\n\nFinal conclusion based on both methods is that the Hopf charge is 1.\n\n>>>1"
