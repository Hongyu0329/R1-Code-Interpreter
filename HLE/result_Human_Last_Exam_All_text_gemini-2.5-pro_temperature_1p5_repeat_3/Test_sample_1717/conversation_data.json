    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Stats:**\n    First, we must determine the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in the specified game mode, Expert Mode, before any multiplayer scaling is applied.\n    *   In Normal Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 2800.\n    *   In Expert Mode, boss health is increased. For the Eye of Cthulhu, the source code sets its base health in Expert Mode to **3640**. This is the value used for subsequent calculations.\n\n2.  **Determine the Health Scaling Formula:**\n    Next, we need to find the formula the game uses to scale boss health based on the number of players.\n    *   In Expert Mode, boss health is multiplied by a factor that increases with the number of active players in the server (`N`).\n    *   According to the source code, each player contributes a 35% (or 0.35) health bonus.\n    *   The total health multiplier is calculated as `(1 + 0.35 * N)`.\n    *   Therefore, the complete formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode is:\n        `Total Health = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * N)`\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. This means we must consider the behavior of the formula as `N` approaches infinity (`N → ∞`).\n    *   As the number of players `N` increases, the term `0.35 * N` increases without bound.\n    *   This means the entire expression `3640 * (1 + 0.35 * N)` also grows infinitely large.\n    *   Mathematically, the limit of this function as `N` approaches infinity is infinity.\n\n4.  **Consider the Technical Limitations (\"Careful Points\"):**\n    The question asks for a \"theoretical maximum\" and references the \"source code\". This implies we must look beyond the pure mathematical formula and consider the technical constraints of the game engine.\n    *   **Data Type Limitation:** In the Terraria source code (C#), the variable that stores the health of an NPC (`NPC.lifeMax`) is a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n    *   **Maximum Value:** A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value. Any value higher than this cannot be correctly stored. This hard limit represents the true \"theoretical maximum\" health an entity can have in the game.\n    *   The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2³¹ - 1, which equals **2,147,483,647**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWhile the health scaling formula would yield an infinite result for an infinite number of players, the game's code fundamentally limits the health to the maximum value of the data type used to store it. As the calculated health value from the formula exceeds 2,147,483,647, it will be capped at this number by the engine.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
