    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Context:** Painted after escaping/being released from the Gestapo (or more accurately, the SA, the early Nazi paramilitary force).\n*   **Question:** What object does he hold in his hand, and what is its symbolic meaning as an act of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific painting.**\nA search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933\" leads to the famous painting titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Mohnblume\" or \"Self-Portrait with Poppy.\" This confirms the artwork in question.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the historical context.**\nIn 1933, the Nazi Party seized power in Germany. Curt Querner was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and associated with the \"New Objectivity\" art movement, both of which were targeted by the Nazis. In March 1933, he was arrested by the SA and imprisoned in a concentration camp. He was released after a short period. It was upon his release that he painted this self-portrait.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the object in his hand.**\nBy examining the painting \"Self-Portrait with Poppy,\" we can clearly see that Querner is holding a single red poppy flower.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the symbolism of the object as a form of resistance.**\n*   **The Color Red:** The most crucial element is the color of the poppy. Red was the internationally recognized color of communism and the workers' movement. By painting himself holding a bright red flower immediately after being imprisoned for his communist beliefs, Querner was making a bold and dangerous political statement.\n*   **Defiance:** Instead of showing a broken or fearful man, the portrait depicts him with a stern, resolute, and defiant expression. The flower is not just an accessory; it is the focal point of his defiance. It signifies that his spirit and political convictions remain unbroken despite the persecution he just endured.\n*   **Life and Resilience:** A flower is a symbol of life, beauty, and nature. By holding this fragile, living thing, Querner contrasts the life-affirming ideals of his beliefs with the death-dealing nature of the Nazi regime. It is a symbol of resilience and hope in the face of brutal oppression.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn his 1933 self-portrait, painted after his release from imprisonment by the Nazis, Curt Querner holds a red poppy. This flower serves as a powerful symbol of resistance by openly alluding to his communist ideals through its red color, representing his unbroken spirit and defiance against the regime.\n\n<<<A red poppy>>>"
