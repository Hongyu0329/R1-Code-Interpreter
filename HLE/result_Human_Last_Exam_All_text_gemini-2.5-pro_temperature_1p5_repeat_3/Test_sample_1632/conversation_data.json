    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice. Let's analyze this step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D square grid, also known as the square lattice ZÂ². Movement is restricted to one unit step horizontally or vertically to an adjacent point.\n*   **Self-avoiding Walk (SAW):** A path on the lattice starting from a fixed origin, say (0,0), that never visits the same point (vertex) more than once.\n*   **n-step walk:** A walk consisting of exactly `n` steps.\n*   **a(n):** The function that counts the total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze for small values of n**\n\nWe can build intuition by calculating the first few terms of the sequence a(n). We'll assume the walk starts at (0,0).\n\n*   **n = 1:**\n    *   From (0,0), we can move to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1).\n    *   These are 4 distinct walks.\n    *   So, `a(1) = 4`.\n\n*   **n = 2:**\n    *   For each of the 4 starting steps, the second step cannot reverse the first one. For example, if the first step is to (1,0), the second step cannot be to (0,0).\n    *   The available moves from (1,0) are to (2,0), (1,1), and (1,-1). There are 3 choices.\n    *   Since there were 4 possible first steps, and each has 3 valid second steps, the total is `4 * 3 = 12`.\n    *   So, `a(2) = 12`.\n\n*   **n = 3:**\n    *   Consider any 2-step walk, for example, (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0). The next step cannot be back to (1,0). The other 3 neighbors of (2,0) are new points. So, 3 possibilities.\n    *   Consider another 2-step walk, (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1). The next step cannot be back to (1,0). The other 3 neighbors of (1,1) are new points. So, 3 possibilities.\n    *   For every 2-step walk, the endpoint has 3 available neighbors that haven't been visited yet.\n    *   Total walks = (Number of 2-step walks) * 3 = `12 * 3 = 36`.\n    *   So, `a(3) = 36`.\n\n*   **n = 4:**\n    *   This is where it gets tricky. The number of choices for the next step is no longer guaranteed to be 3.\n    *   Consider the 3-step walk (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1). The path has visited (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1).\n    *   The neighbors of the endpoint (0,1) are (1,1), (-1,1), (0,2), and (0,0).\n    *   Two of these neighbors, (1,1) and (0,0), are already on the path.\n    *   So, there are only 2 available next steps: to (-1,1) or (0,2). This is called \"trapping\".\n    *   Because the number of next steps depends on the specific shape of the path, we can't use a simple multiplication rule. We have to enumerate all possibilities.\n\n**Step 3: Finding a(10) - The Challenge**\n\nManually calculating a(4) is tedious, and calculating a(10) by hand is practically impossible due to the massive number of paths (combinatorial explosion). There is no simple closed-form formula for a(n). This is a well-known, unsolved problem in mathematics.\n\nHowever, the values of a(n) for small `n` have been computed using sophisticated computer algorithms (a method called exact enumeration). These values are standard and well-documented in scientific literature and databases like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\n**Step 4: Using known, pre-computed values**\n\nThe sequence for the number of self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is cataloged as sequence A001411 in the OEIS. The known values are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the established computational results for this famous combinatorial problem, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
