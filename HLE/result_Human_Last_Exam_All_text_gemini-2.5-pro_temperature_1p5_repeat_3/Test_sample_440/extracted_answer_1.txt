The density profile is given by \(\rho(z) = m_A n_A(z) + m_B n_B(z)\), where \(n_A(z)\) and \(n_B(z)\) are the numerical solutions to the system of coupled ordinary differential equations derived from the constancy of chemical potential for each gas species (\(d\mu_i/dz=0\)) under the specified van der Waals interactions and gravitational field, subject to integral constraints on the total number of particles \(N_A\) and \(N_B\).
