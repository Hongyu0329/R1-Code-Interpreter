    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer gain matrix L.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to design a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system. This means we need to find an observer gain matrix `L` such that the observer error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. The error dynamics are given by `e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)`. To achieve deadbeat performance, all eigenvalues of the matrix `(A - LC)` must be placed at the origin (z=0). The shortest possible time for the error to vanish is determined by the system's observability index, `nu`.\n\n**Step 2: Check Observability**\n\nFirst, we must confirm that the system is observable. A system is observable if its observability matrix `O` has full rank (`rank(O) = n`, where `n` is the state dimension). Here, `n=4`.\n\nThe observability matrix is `O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]`.\n\nGiven matrices:\nA = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]\nC = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]\n\nWe compute the products:\n*   `C` = `[1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n*   `CA` = `[-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\n*   `CA^2` = `[0 0 1 -2; 2 1 0 -3]`\n\nTo check for rank `n=4`, we only need to construct the matrix `O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2]` and find a 4x4 submatrix with a non-zero determinant.\nLet's select the first row of `C`, the second row of `C`, the second row of `CA`, and the second row of `CA^2`.\nM = [ 1  0  0  0;\n      1  0  0  1;\n     -2  0  1  0;\n      2  1  0 -3 ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix `M` is `det(M) = 1 * det([0 0 1; 0 1 0; 1 0 -3]) = 1 * (1 * det([0 1; 1 0])) = -1`.\nSince `det(M)` is non-zero, the rank of `M` is 4. As `M` is a submatrix of `O`, `rank(O)` is at least 4. Since `O` has 4 columns, its rank is exactly 4. Thus, the system is observable.\n\nThe observability index `nu` is the smallest integer `k` for which `O_k = [C; CA; ...; CA^(k-1)]` has rank `n`. We found `rank(O_3)=4` while `rank(O_2)=3` (calculation not shown in detail but can be verified), so the observability index is `nu=3`. This means the error can be made to vanish in 3 steps.\n\n**Step 3: Use Duality for Observer Design**\n\nDesigning the observer gain `L` directly can be complicated. We can use the principle of duality, which relates the observer design problem to a controller design problem. The observer gain `L` for the system `(A, C)` that places the eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` at desired locations is the transpose of the controller gain `K_c` for the dual system `(A^T, C^T)` that places the eigenvalues of `(A^T - C^T K_c)` at the same locations.\nSo, `L = K_c^T`.\n\nOur goal is to find `K_c` such that the dual closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A^T - C^T K_c` has all its eigenvalues at 0. This means its characteristic polynomial must be `det(zI - A_cl) = z^4`.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Pole Placement Problem for the Dual System**\n\nThe dual system matrices are:\nA_d = A^T = [-1 1 0 -1; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1]\nB_d = C^T = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1]\n\nThe control gain `K_c` is a 2x4 matrix (since input dimension is 2 and state dimension is 4):\nK_c = [k11 k12 k13 k14; k21 k22 k23 k24]\n\nThe dual closed-loop matrix is `A_cl = A^T - C^T K_c`:\nA_cl = [-1-(k11+k21)  1-(k12+k22)  -(k13+k23)  -1-(k14+k24);\n           0             0             1             0;\n           0             0             0             1;\n         1-k21         2-k22        -1-k23        -1-k24]\n\nWe set the characteristic polynomial `det(zI - A_cl)` equal to `z^4`, which yields four equations for the coefficients of `z^3, z^2, z^1, z^0` being zero. Since there are 8 unknowns (the `k` values) and only 4 equations, there are multiple solutions. We can simplify the problem by setting some gains to zero, provided the resulting system remains controllable.\n\nLet's test setting the second row of `K_c` to zero: `k21=k22=k23=k24=0`. This is valid because the dual system `(A^T, C^T)` is controllable, and it can be verified that the system `(A^T, c1)` (where `c1` is the first column of `C^T`) is also controllable.\n\nWith `k2j=0`, the four equations for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial become:\n1.  Coeff `z^3`: `2 + k11 = 0`\n2.  Coeff `z^2`: `1 + (1+k11) + (1+k14) = 0`\n3.  Coeff `z^1`: `-2 + (1+k11) + k13 = 0`\n4.  Coeff `z^0`: `(-2)(1+k11) + (-1+k12) = 0`\n\nSolving this system of linear equations:\n1.  From (1): `k11 = -2`.\n2.  Substitute `k11` into (2): `1 + (1-2) + (1+k14) = 0` -> `1 - 1 + 1 + k14 = 0` -> `k14 = -1`.\n3.  Substitute `k11` into (3): `-2 + (1-2) + k13 = 0` -> `-2 - 1 + k13 = 0` -> `k13 = 3`.\n4.  Substitute `k11` into (4): `(-2)(1-2) + (-1+k12) = 0` -> `(-2)(-1) - 1 + k12 = 0` -> `2 - 1 + k12 = 0` -> `k12 = -1`.\n\nSo, the controller gain matrix is:\nK_c = [-2 -1  3 -1;\n        0  0  0  0]\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Observer Gain Matrix L**\n\nThe observer gain is the transpose of `K_c`:\nL = K_c^T\n\nL = [-2  0;\n     -1  0;\n      3  0;\n     -1  0]\n\nThis is the required observer gain matrix.\n\n<<<[[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]>>>"
