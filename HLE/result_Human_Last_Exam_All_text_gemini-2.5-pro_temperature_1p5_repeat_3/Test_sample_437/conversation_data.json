    "An analysis of the question, step by step, with a list of careful points.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks to evaluate the quantum mechanical integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j \\rangle$, where $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are 1s Slater-type orbitals (STOs). This expression represents a matrix element of the operator $\\frac{1}{r}$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the 1s Slater Orbital (STO)**\n\nA Slater-type orbital is a function used to represent atomic orbitals in quantum chemistry. The general form depends on the quantum numbers $n, l, m$ and an orbital exponent $\\zeta$.\nFor a 1s orbital, the quantum numbers are $n=1, l=0, m=0$. The normalized wavefunction for a 1s STO centered at the origin is given by:\n\\[ \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\left(\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r} \\]\nwhere:\n*   $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$ is the distance from the origin.\n*   $\\zeta$ (zeta) is the orbital exponent, which determines the \"size\" or diffuseness of the orbital. It is treated as a variational parameter in calculations.\n*   $(\\zeta^3/\\pi)^{1/2}$ is the normalization constant, which ensures that the probability of finding the electron somewhere in space is 1, i.e., $\\int |\\phi_{1s}|^2 dV = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Integral**\n\nThe expression $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j \\rangle$ is a bracket in Dirac notation.\n*   The operator is $\\frac{1}{r}$, which corresponds to the potential energy between an electron and a nucleus of charge +1 at the origin, in atomic units.\n*   The orbitals are $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$. The phrasing \"for a 1s Slater orbital\" suggests that we are considering a single type of orbital. The most standard and straightforward interpretation is that $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are the same orbital, i.e., $i=j$. This means we are calculating the **expectation value** of the operator $\\frac{1}{r}$ for an electron in the state $\\phi_{1s}$.\n\nThus, the integral to be evaluated is:\n\\[ \\left\\langle \\phi_{1s} \\left| \\frac{1}{r} \\right| \\phi_{1s} \\right\\rangle = \\int \\phi_{1s}^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}) \\, dV \\]\n\n**Step 3: Set up the Integral in Coordinate Space**\n\nSubstitute the expression for $\\phi_{1s}$ into the integral. Since $\\phi_{1s}$ is a real function, its complex conjugate $\\phi_{1s}^*$ is just $\\phi_{1s}$.\n\\[ I = \\int \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r} \\right]^2 \\frac{1}{r} \\, dV = \\int \\left(\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}\\right) e^{-2\\zeta r} \\frac{1}{r} \\, dV \\]\nThe problem has spherical symmetry, so it is best to evaluate the integral in spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, where the volume element is $dV = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$. The integration limits are $r \\in [0, \\infty)$, $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\\[ I = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}\\right) e^{-2\\zeta r} \\frac{1}{r} \\cdot (r^2 \\sin\\theta) \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi \\]\nWe can simplify the term inside the integral:\n\\[ I = \\left(\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}\\right) \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^\\infty r \\, e^{-2\\zeta r} \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi \\]\n\n**Step 4: Separate and Evaluate the Integrals**\n\nThe integral can be separated into a radial part and an angular part:\n\\[ I = \\left(\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}\\right) \\left( \\int_0^\\infty r \\, e^{-2\\zeta r} dr \\right) \\left( \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\right) \\]\n\n*   **Angular Integrals:**\n    *   $\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi = [\\phi]_0^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi$\n    *   $\\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta d\\theta = [-\\cos\\theta]_0^\\pi = -(\\cos\\pi - \\cos0) = -(-1 - 1) = 2$\n    *   The product of the angular parts is $(2\\pi) \\times 2 = 4\\pi$.\n\n*   **Radial Integral:**\n    *   We need to evaluate $\\int_0^\\infty r \\, e^{-2\\zeta r} dr$.\n    *   This integral is a specific case of the standard integral formula (related to the Gamma function): $\\int_0^\\infty x^n e^{-ax} dx = \\frac{n!}{a^{n+1}}$.\n    *   In our case, $n=1$ and $a = 2\\zeta$.\n    *   Plugging these values in, we get: $\\frac{1!}{(2\\zeta)^{1+1}} = \\frac{1}{(2\\zeta)^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2}$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Results**\n\nNow, we multiply all the parts together:\n\\[ I = \\left(\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}\\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2} \\right) \\times (4\\pi) \\]\nSimplifying the expression by cancelling terms:\n\\[ I = \\frac{\\zeta^3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 4\\pi}{\\pi \\cdot 4\\zeta^2} = \\frac{4\\pi\\zeta^3}{4\\pi\\zeta^2} = \\zeta \\]\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Interpretation:** The most critical point is interpreting the question correctly. While the indices $i, j$ could imply different orbitals (e.g., centered on different atoms or having different exponents $\\zeta$), the phrasing \"for a 1s Slater orbital\" (singular) makes the calculation of the expectation value ($\\phi_i = \\phi_j$) the most plausible interpretation. The more complex cases would require more information to be specified.\n2.  **Normalization:** Using the correctly normalized wavefunction is crucial. An unnormalized wavefunction would give a result that is incorrect by a constant factor. We verified that $\\phi_{1s} = (\\zeta^3/\\pi)^{1/2} e^{-\\zeta r}$ is indeed normalized.\n3.  **Coordinate System:** The operator $\\frac{1}{r}$ implies the potential source is at the origin. It is essential to place the STO at the same origin for this calculation to be valid as presented.\n4.  **Integration Technique:** The choice of spherical coordinates is key due to the spherical symmetry of the integrand. The volume element $dV = r^2 \\sin\\theta dr d\\theta d\\phi$ must be used correctly.\n5.  **Standard Integrals:** Recognizing the radial integral as a standard form saves time and avoids potential errors from performing integration by parts manually.\n\nThe final answer is the value of the orbital exponent, $\\zeta$. This result makes physical sense, as $\\langle 1/r \\rangle$ should have units of inverse length, which is consistent with the units of $\\zeta$."
