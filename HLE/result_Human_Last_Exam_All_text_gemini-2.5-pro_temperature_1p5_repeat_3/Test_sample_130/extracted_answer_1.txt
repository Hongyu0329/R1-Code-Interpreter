The edges are first smoothed out, with sharp corners becoming rounded. Then, the smoothed edges move and contract in a way that simplifies the shapes in the image, causing smaller regions (both "islands" and "holes") to shrink and disappear. As $t\rightarrow\infty$, this process continues until all edges have been eliminated, resulting in a uniform image of a single color (either all black or all white).
