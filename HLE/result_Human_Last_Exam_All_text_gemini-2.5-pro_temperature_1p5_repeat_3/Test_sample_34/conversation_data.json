    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Game Conditions**\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most powerful position in preflop and postflop poker. You are guaranteed to act last on every street after the flop, which gives you a significant informational advantage. This advantage means you should play a very wide range of hands.\n*   **Stack Size:** 100 Big Blinds (BB). This is a standard stack depth, meaning implied odds (the potential to win a large pot if you hit your hand) are a significant factor. Suited hands excel in deep-stacked situations due to their ability to make flushes.\n*   **Action:** Opening to 2.5x. This is a standard raise size from late position. Your goal is to either steal the blinds preflop or to play a pot with the initiative and positional advantage.\n*   **Game Type:** Rake-free. Rake is the fee the house takes from a pot. In a standard game, rake discourages playing small, marginal pots. In a rake-free game, the expected value (EV) of every hand you play increases, especially for marginal hands. This pushes you to play an even wider, more aggressive range than you would in a raked game.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the \"worst suited jack\" that you *should* open. This means we are looking for the hand at the absolute bottom of the \"JXs\" (Jack-X suited) category that is still a profitable open-raise. We are not looking for a suited jack that should be folded, but the weakest one that makes the cut.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the \"Suited Jack\" Hands (JXs)**\nSuited jacks are valuable for several reasons:\n1.  **Flush Potential:** The primary strength of any suited hand is the ability to make a flush, a very strong hand.\n2.  **High Card Value:** The Jack is a strong high card. Flopping a pair of jacks will often be the top pair on the board.\n3.  **Kicker and Connectivity:** The second card (the \"X\") contributes value. A high kicker (like in AJs or KJs) is very strong. A connecting card (like in JTs or J9s) adds straight potential. As the kicker gets lower (J5s, J4s, etc.), the hand's value decreases.\n\n**Step 4: Rank the JXs Hands**\nThe hierarchy of suited jacks, from best to worst, is determined by the rank of the second card:\n*   AJs (Best)\n*   KJs\n*   QJs\n*   JTs\n*   J9s\n*   J8s\n*   J7s\n*   J6s\n*   J5s\n*   J4s\n*   J3s\n*   J2s (Worst)\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Opening Cutoff Point**\nGiven the powerful combination of being on the button, playing deep-stacked, and the absence of rake, your opening range should be extremely wide. Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solvers show that even in games *with* rake, the button's opening range includes every single suited jack. The combination of position and equity from the suit and high card makes even the weakest version, J2s, a profitable open. Since playing in a rake-free environment makes marginal hands *more* profitable, J2s is comfortably a mandatory open-raise in this scenario.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSince every single suited jack from AJs down to J2s is a profitable and standard hand to open-raise from the button under these conditions, the \"worst\" one that you should still open is the one at the very bottom of the ranking.\n\nThe worst hand in the JXs category is **J2s**.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
