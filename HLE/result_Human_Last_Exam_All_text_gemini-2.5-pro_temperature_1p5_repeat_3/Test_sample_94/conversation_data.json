    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the physicist in question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question provides several distinct clues to identify a specific physicist:\n1.  **Field of Expertise:** The person is primarily known for their work in microscopy.\n2.  **The Discovery:** They discovered an optical effect related to real imagery. A real image is one formed by the actual convergence of light rays, which can be projected onto a screen.\n3.  **The Circumstance of Discovery:** The effect was first noticed by accident. A custodial worker observed it while cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Most Specific Clue**\nThe story of the discovery being made by a custodial worker cleaning a concave mirror is the most unusual and distinctive clue. This is a well-known, albeit sometimes embellished, anecdote in the history of science. We can use this as the primary search key.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Anecdote to a Scientific Principle**\nThe story describes how a person wiping a concave mirror left a thin, uneven film of oil or grime on its surface. When this mirror was used to view the reflection of a distant light source, details of that source (like a lamp's filament) became visible with much greater contrast than before. The thin film was unintentionally acting as a \"phase plate,\" delaying parts of the light wave (changing its phase) relative to other parts. This conversion of phase differences into amplitude (brightness) differences is the core of the optical effect. This effect is known as **phase contrast**.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Physicist Associated with the Principle**\nThe physicist who understood the physics behind this phenomenon, formalized the theory, and invented a device based on it is **Frits Zernike**. He developed the mathematical framework for phase contrast and applied it to create the phase-contrast microscope.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Physicist Against All Clues**\n*   **\"Better known for work in the microscopy field?\"** Yes. Frits Zernike won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 specifically \"for his demonstration of the phase-contrast method, especially for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope.\" This invention revolutionized biology by allowing scientists to study living, transparent cells without the need for staining, which usually kills them.\n*   **\"Discovered an optical effect in real imagery?\"** Yes. The principle of phase contrast fits this description perfectly. The initial observation involved the real image of a light source formed by a concave mirror.\n*   **\"Accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\"** Yes. This famous story is directly associated with Zernike's work. While the exact details are sometimes debated, the story serves to illustrate how the inspiration for his Nobel-winning discovery came from an observation of light reflecting off a surface with slight imperfections.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll clues point directly to the Dutch physicist Frits Zernike, who developed the theory of phase contrast and invented the phase-contrast microscope.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
