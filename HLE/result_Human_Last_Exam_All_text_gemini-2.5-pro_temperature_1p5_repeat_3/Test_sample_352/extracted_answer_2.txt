The best replacement would be to mutate all four residues—Serine (47), Glutamate (48), Glutamate (49), and Aspartate (50)—to Alanine (A). This would change the native S-E-E-D sequence to A-A-A-A, which would effectively eliminate the potential for negative charge from both phosphorylation (at S47) and the acidic side chains (at E48, E49, D50).
