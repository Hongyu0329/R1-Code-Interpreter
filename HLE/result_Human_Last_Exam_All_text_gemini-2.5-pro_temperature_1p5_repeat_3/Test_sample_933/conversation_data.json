    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) to determine the coldest temperature for its efficient production.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the lowest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced efficiently using any synthesis method. The key terms are \"coldest temperature\" and \"efficiently\".\n\n2.  **Recall or Research the Synthesis of XeF₄:** The most common and direct method for synthesizing XeF₄ is the reaction between elemental Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F₂).\n    *   **Chemical Equation:** Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n    *   This reaction is exothermic, but it has a high activation energy. This means that energy, usually in the form of heat, must be supplied to start the reaction and make it proceed at a reasonable rate.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conditions for Synthesis:** The synthesis of xenon fluorides is sensitive to temperature, pressure, and the ratio of reactants.\n    *   **Reactant Ratio:** To favor the formation of XeF₄ over other xenon fluorides (like XeF₂ or XeF₆), a molar excess of fluorine is used, typically in a ratio of Xe:F₂ of 1:5.\n    *   **Pressure:** The reaction is typically carried out at elevated pressures (around 6 atmospheres) to increase the concentration of the gaseous reactants and push the equilibrium towards the product.\n    *   **Temperature:** This is the critical factor for this question.\n        *   **Too Low:** If the temperature is too low, the reactant molecules will not have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. The reaction rate will be extremely slow, making the process inefficient.\n        *   **Too High:** If the temperature is too high, it can favor the formation of the more highly fluorinated compound, Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆), especially with the excess fluorine present: XeF₄ + F₂ ⇌ XeF₆. This would decrease the yield of XeF₄, making the process inefficient for producing the target compound.\n\n4.  **Determine the Optimal Temperature Range:** Based on established chemical literature and standard laboratory procedures, the synthesis of XeF₄ is most efficiently carried out by heating the mixture of xenon and fluorine. The generally accepted optimal temperature is around **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds at a good rate to give a high yield of XeF₄ within a reasonable time (a few hours), without significant formation of XeF₆.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Given Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is too high. It would significantly increase the rate of formation of XeF₆, thus reducing the efficiency of XeF₄ production.\n    *   **B. 400 °C:** This is the widely cited and standard temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄. It provides the best balance between reaction rate and product purity.\n    *   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate would be very slow. The process would not be considered \"efficient\" as it would require a much longer reaction time to achieve a reasonable yield.\n    *   **D. 78 °C, E. 0 °C, F. -78 °C:** These temperatures are far too low for the thermal reaction to occur at any meaningful rate. The activation energy barrier is simply too high to be overcome without a significant external energy source like heat.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature at which the production is *still efficient*. While the reaction might proceed very slowly at temperatures slightly below 400 °C, this temperature is the standard benchmark for an efficient process that is widely used and documented. Temperatures below this, such as 200 °C, are generally considered too slow for an efficient synthesis. Therefore, among the given choices, 400 °C is the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
