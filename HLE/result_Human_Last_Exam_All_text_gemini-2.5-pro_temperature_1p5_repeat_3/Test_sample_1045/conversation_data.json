    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and atomic composition of toluene.**\n*   The chemical formula for toluene is C₇H₈.\n*   This means the molecule contains:\n    *   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n    *   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The notation tells us how the atomic orbitals (AOs) are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs).\n\n*   **For heavy atoms (like Carbon in this case):**\n    *   **\"6-\"**: The core orbitals are described by a single CGF, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   **\"-31\"**: The valence orbitals are \"split\" into two basis functions (a double-zeta representation).\n        *   The inner part of the valence shell is described by one CGF, composed of 3 PGFs.\n        *   The outer part of the valence shell is described by one CGF, composed of 1 PGF.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n    *   **\"-31\"**: The valence 1s orbital is split into two CGFs, in the same manner as the valence orbitals of heavy atoms (one from 3 PGFs and one from 1 PGF).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs) for each Carbon atom.**\n*   A Carbon atom has the electron configuration 1s² 2s² 2p².\n*   **Core orbital (1s):** This is represented by **1 CGF** (from the \"6-\" part).\n*   **Valence orbitals (2s, 2pₓ, 2pᵧ, 2p₂):** Carbon has 4 valence AOs (one 2s and three 2p).\n    *   According to the split-valence \"-31\" notation, each of these 4 valence AOs is represented by two CGFs (an inner and an outer function).\n    *   Number of valence CGFs = 4 valence AOs × 2 CGFs/AO = **8 CGFs**.\n*   **Total CGFs per Carbon atom** = 1 (core) + 8 (valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs) for each Hydrogen atom.**\n*   A Hydrogen atom has the electron configuration 1s¹. It has no core electrons.\n*   **Valence orbital (1s):** The single 1s orbital is a valence orbital.\n    *   According to the split-valence \"-31\" notation, this orbital is represented by **2 CGFs** (an inner and an outer function).\n*   **Total CGFs per Hydrogen atom** = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of CGFs for the toluene molecule (C₇H₈).**\n*   Total CGFs = (Number of Carbon atoms × CGFs per C) + (Number of Hydrogen atoms × CGFs per H)\n*   Total CGFs = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n*   Total CGFs = 63 + 16\n*   Total CGFs = 79\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Distinguish between core and valence electrons:** The basis set treats them differently. For first-row atoms (like C), 1s is core, while 2s and 2p are valence. For H, 1s is valence.\n*   **Interpret \"split-valence\" correctly:** The split applies *per atomic orbital*. For Carbon, this means the 2s, 2pₓ, 2pᵧ, and 2p₂ orbitals are each split into two basis functions. It is a common mistake to think only the \"shell\" (s and p) is split once.\n*   **Contracted vs. Primitive functions:** The question asks for the number of *contracted* Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are the basis functions used in the calculation. Do not confuse this with the number of *primitive* Gaussian functions (PGFs) which are summed to create the CGFs.\n*   **Atom count:** Ensure you have the correct number of atoms from the molecular formula (7 C and 8 H for toluene).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  **C atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs\n2.  **H atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs\n3.  **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 CGFs\n\n<<<79>>>"
