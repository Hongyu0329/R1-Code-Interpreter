    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Chemical Reaction and Reactant\n\nThe question asks for a property of the product of the **Favorskii rearrangement** of **2-chlorocyclohexanone**.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 2-chlorocyclohexanone is an α-halo ketone. It is a six-membered cyclic ketone with a chlorine atom on a carbon atom adjacent (alpha) to the carbonyl group.\n*   **Reaction:** The Favorskii rearrangement is the reaction of an α-halo ketone with a base. For ketones with acidic protons on the other alpha-carbon (α'-position), the reaction proceeds through a cyclopropanone intermediate and typically results in a ring-contracted carboxylic acid or ester.\n*   **Reagents:** The base is not specified. Common bases for this rearrangement are sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to produce a carboxylic acid (after acidic workup), or a sodium alkoxide like sodium methoxide (NaOMe) to produce an ester (e.g., a methyl ester). We will assume standard textbook conditions using sodium methoxide in methanol, which is a very common way this reaction is performed.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Structure of the Product\n\n1.  **Mechanism Initiation:** The methoxide ion (MeO⁻) acts as a base and removes an acidic proton from the α'-carbon (C6) of 2-chlorocyclohexanone. This forms an enolate intermediate.\n2.  **Intermediate Formation:** The enolate undergoes an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. The carbanion at C6 attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine (C2), displacing the chloride ion (Cl⁻). This forms a strained, bicyclic intermediate containing a cyclopropane ring: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-1-one is a possible way to name it, but the key is its structure which has the original six-membered ring skeleton with a new bond between C2 and C6.\n3.  **Ring Opening:** The methoxide ion (MeO⁻) now acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon (C1) of the bicyclic intermediate. This forms a tetrahedral intermediate.\n4.  **Ring Contraction:** The tetrahedral intermediate collapses. The ring opens by cleaving one of the bonds to the original carbonyl carbon (C1-C2 or C1-C6). Due to the symmetry of the intermediate, breaking either bond leads to the same product. Let's say the C1-C2 bond breaks. This process forms a carbanion on C2.\n5.  **Final Product Formation:** The original six-membered ring is now a five-membered ring (composed of atoms C2, C3, C4, C5, C6). The original carbonyl carbon (C1) is now part of an exocyclic methyl ester group (-COOCH₃) attached to C6. The carbanion at C2 is protonated by the solvent (methanol).\n\nThe final product is **methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate**.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Böttcher Molecular Complexity\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMC) is a topological index calculated from the structure of a molecule. The formula is:\nBMC = (N_A * N_B) / (N_C)²\n\nWhere:\n*   **N_A** = The number of non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule.\n*   **N_B** = The number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms. Multiple bonds (double, triple) are counted as a single bond.\n*   **N_C** = The number of connected components of non-hydrogen atoms. For a single molecule, this value is always 1.\n\nFor a single, connected molecule, the formula simplifies to:\n**BMC = N_A * N_B**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Böttcher Molecular Complexity for the Product\n\n1.  **Product:** Methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.\n2.  **Chemical Formula:** C₇H₁₂O₂.\n3.  **Structure:** A five-membered carbon ring is bonded to a methyl ester group (-COOCH₃).\n    ```\n        H₂C--CH₂\n       /     \\\n      HC------CH₂\n      |\n      C=O\n      |\n      O\n      |\n      CH₃\n    ```\n4.  **Calculate N_A (Number of non-hydrogen atoms):**\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n    *   Number of Oxygen (O) atoms = 2\n    *   **N_A = 7 + 2 = 9**\n\n5.  **Calculate N_B (Number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms):**\n    *   Bonds in the cyclopentane ring (5 C-C single bonds) = 5\n    *   Bond connecting the ring to the ester group (1 C-C single bond) = 1\n    *   Bonds within the ester group:\n        *   One C=O double bond (counted as 1)\n        *   One C-O single bond\n        *   One O-C single bond (to the methyl group)\n        *   Total bonds in the ester group = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n    *   Total bonds (N_B) = 5 (ring) + 1 (linker) + 3 (ester) = **9**\n\n6.  **Calculate the BMC:**\n    *   BMC = N_A * N_B\n    *   BMC = 9 * 9\n    *   **BMC = 81**\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis leads to the conclusion that the product is methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, which has a Böttcher Molecular Complexity of 81.\n\n<<<81>>>"
