    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final binary pattern.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand Cellular Automaton Rule 110**\n\nA one-dimensional cellular automaton consists of a row of cells, each with a state (in this case, 0 or 1). The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by a set of rules based on its own state and the state of its immediate neighbors (left and right).\n\nRule 110 is defined by the following state transitions for a cell based on its 3-cell neighborhood (left neighbor, itself, right neighbor):\n\nFirst, we convert the decimal number 110 to its 8-bit binary representation:\n$110 = 0 \\times 128 + 1 \\times 64 + 1 \\times 32 + 0 \\times 16 + 1 \\times 8 + 1 \\times 4 + 1 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 1 = 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2$.\nSo, the binary is `01101110`.\n\nThis binary string defines the output for the 8 possible neighborhood patterns, listed in standard descending order:\n\n| Current Neighborhood | Binary Value | New State (from `01101110`) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| `111` | 7 | `0` |\n| `110` | 6 | `1` |\n| `101` | 5 | `1` |\n| `100` | 4 | `0` |\n| `011` | 3 | `1` |\n| `010` | 2 | `1` |\n| `001` | 1 | `1` |\n| `000` | 0 | `0` |\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Initial State and Boundary Conditions**\n\n*   **Initial State (Generation 0):** A single cell in state 1. We represent this as the pattern `1`.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The grid of cells is considered infinite. For our calculations, we can assume that any cell beyond our current pattern is in state 0. We handle this by adding leading and trailing zeros to our pattern before calculating the next generation.\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the Rule 20 Times**\n\nWe will compute each generation sequentially. The pattern for the next generation is found by applying the rules to every possible 3-cell neighborhood in the current generation (including the zero-padded boundaries).\n\n*   **Gen 0:** `1`\n    *   Padded: `...00100...`\n    *   Neighborhoods to consider: `001`, `010`, `100`\n    *   Next states: `1`, `1`, `0`\n\n*   **Gen 1:** `11`\n\n*   **Gen 2:** `111`\n\n*   **Gen 3:** `1101`\n\n*   **Gen 4:** `11111`\n\n*   **Gen 5:** `110001`\n\n*   **Gen 6:** `1110011`\n\n*   **Gen 7:** `11010111`\n\n*   **Gen 8:** `11111101`\n\n*   **Gen 9:** `110000111`\n\n*   **Gen 10:** `1110001101`\n\n*   **Gen 11:** `11010011111`\n\n*   **Gen 12:** `111110110001`\n\n*   **Gen 13:** `1100011110011`\n\n*   **Gen 14:** `11100110010111`\n\n*   **Gen 15:** `110101110111101`\n\n*   **Gen 16:** `111111011100111`\n\n*   **Gen 17:** `1100001110101101`\n\n*   **Gen 18:** `11100011011111111`\n\n*   **Gen 19:** `110100111110000001`\n\n*   **Gen 20:** To get the final generation, we apply the rules to Gen 19 (`110100111110000001`).\n    *   Padded: `...0011010011111000000100...`\n    *   Applying the rules across this padded string yields the next pattern. For example:\n        *   The new leftmost `1` comes from the neighborhood `001`.\n        *   The new second `1` comes from the neighborhood `011`.\n        *   ...and so on.\n    *   The complete calculation results in: `1111101100010000011`\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe binary pattern after applying Rule 110 for 20 iterations is:\n\n<<<1111101100010000011>>>"
