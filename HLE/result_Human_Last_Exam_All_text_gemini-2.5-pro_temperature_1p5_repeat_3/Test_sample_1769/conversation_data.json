    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core of the question.**\nThe question asks for the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\" if a specific historical event—the Norse invasions and settlement in England (c. 7th-12th centuries)—had not occurred. This requires us to understand the etymology of the current word \"sister\" and trace the linguistic path the original native word would have taken without external influence.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the etymology of the current word \"sister\".**\nThe Modern English word \"sister\" comes from the Middle English word *sister*. Historical linguists have determined that this form is not a direct, natural evolution of the native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word. Instead, it is either a direct loanword from Old Norse *systir* or its form was heavily influenced by the Norse word. The `-i-` vowel sound in the first syllable is a clear hallmark of the Scandinavian form, which became dominant in the Danelaw (the parts of England under Norse control) and eventually spread to become the standard throughout England.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the native Old English word for \"sister\".**\nBefore the Vikings arrived, the Anglo-Saxons had their own word for a female sibling. This word in Old English was *sweostor*. There was also a common variant, *swuster*, which was used in certain dialects. Both *sweostor* and the Old Norse *systir* descended from the same ancient root, Proto-Germanic **\\*swestēr*, which is why they are so similar. However, their evolution within their respective languages led to distinct pronunciations and spellings.\n\n**Step 4: Trace the hypothetical evolution of the Old English word without Norse influence.**\nIf the Norse had never invaded, there would have been no *systir* to influence the English language. The native word *sweostor* or *swuster* would have continued its natural evolution.\n*   The form *suster* was already a very common variant in Middle English, particularly in the southern and western dialects where Norse influence was weakest. It evolved directly from the Old English variant *swuster*. This makes *suster* the most likely candidate for the word that would have become standard.\n*   We then need to project how Middle English *suster* would have evolved into Modern English. The primary sound change to consider is the Great Vowel Shift (c. 1400-1700).\n*   During the Great Vowel Shift, the short 'u' sound /ʊ/ (as in \"put\") typically shifted to the /ʌ/ sound (the \"uh\" sound in \"cut\" or \"duster\"). We can see this in many other words, such as Middle English *sunne* becoming Modern English \"sun\", and *butere* becoming \"butter\".\n*   Applying this rule, the Middle English *suster* would have evolved into a Modern English word spelled **suster** and pronounced \"SUH-ster\" (to rhyme with \"duster\" or \"buster\").\n\n**Step 5: Corroborate with related languages.**\nWe can check this hypothesis by looking at other West Germanic languages that were not subject to the same Old Norse influence.\n*   **Dutch:** *zuster*\n*   **German:** *Schwester*\nBoth of these cognates evolved from the same Proto-Germanic root without the Norse influence. The Dutch *zuster* is particularly close to our projected evolution of the English word, strengthening the conclusion that the native English form would have been \"suster\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWithout the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the native Old English word *sweostor*/*swuster* would have evolved naturally through Middle English (*suster*) into Modern English. Following the predictable path of sound changes, the resulting word would be \"suster\".\n\n<<<suster>>>"
