    "Answering this question requires analyzing the algebraic structure of the given polynomial, determining its Galois group, and then applying the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the polynomial $f(x)$**\n    The polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n    The structure of the terms, with decreasing odd powers, suggests a connection to polynomials related to trigonometric identities or cyclotomy. Let's consider the polynomials $P_n(x, \\alpha)$ which are defined by the relation $P_n(u+v, uv) = u^n+v^n$ where the second argument indicates that $uv = \\alpha$ is constant.\n    These polynomials follow a recurrence relation: $P_{n+1}(x, \\alpha) = x P_n(x, \\alpha) - \\alpha P_{n-1}(x, \\alpha)$.\n    Let's compute the first few polynomials for a general $\\alpha$:\n    $P_0(x, \\alpha) = u^0+v^0 = 2$\n    $P_1(x, \\alpha) = u+v = x$\n    $P_2(x, \\alpha) = u^2+v^2 = (u+v)^2 - 2uv = x^2-2\\alpha$\n    $P_3(x, \\alpha) = u^3+v^3 = (u+v)^3 - 3uv(u+v) = x^3-3\\alpha x$\n    ...\n    A general formula can be derived:\n    $P_n(x, \\alpha) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} (-1)^k \\frac{n}{n-k} \\binom{n-k}{k} \\alpha^k x^{n-2k}$.\n\n    For $n=7$, this gives:\n    $P_7(x, \\alpha) = x^7 - 7\\alpha x^5 + 14\\alpha^2 x^3 - 7\\alpha^3 x$.\n\n    Now, let's compare this to the polynomial part of $f(x)$, which is $f(x) - 22 = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$.\n    Matching the coefficients:\n    - Coefficient of $x^5$: $-7\\alpha = -14 \\implies \\alpha = 2$.\n    - Coefficient of $x^3$: $14\\alpha^2 = 14(2^2) = 14 \\times 4 = 56$. This matches.\n    - Coefficient of $x$: $-7\\alpha^3 = -7(2^3) = -7 \\times 8 = -56$. This also matches.\n\n    So, we have established that $f(x) = P_7(x, 2) + 22$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Galois group of $f(x)$**\n    The equation $f(x) = 0$ is equivalent to $P_7(x, 2) = -22$.\n    By definition of $P_7(x,2)$, the roots of $f(x)$ are of the form $x=u+v$ where $uv=2$ and $u^7+v^7=-22$.\n    Substituting $v=2/u$ into the second equation gives $u^7 + (2/u)^7 = -22$, which simplifies to $u^7 + 128/u^7 = -22$.\n    Let $y=u^7$. The equation becomes $y + 128/y = -22$, or $y^2 + 22y + 128 = 0$.\n    The roots of this quadratic equation are $y = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{22^2 - 4(1)(128)}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{484 - 512}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{-28}}{2} = -11 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}$.\n    Let $\\beta = -11 + i\\sqrt{7}$. Then the possible values for $u^7$ are $\\beta$ and its complex conjugate $\\bar{\\beta} = -11 - i\\sqrt{7}$.\n    Note that $|\\beta|^2 = (-11)^2 + (\\sqrt{7})^2 = 121 + 7 = 128 = 2^7$.\n\n    Let $u_0$ be a specific 7th root of $\\beta$. Then all seven 7th roots of $\\beta$ are $u_k = u_0 \\zeta_7^k$ for $k=0, \\dots, 6$, where $\\zeta_7 = e^{2\\pi i/7}$ is a primitive 7th root of unity.\n    From $u_0^7 = \\beta$, we have $\\bar{u_0}^7 = \\bar{\\beta}$. Also, $(u_0\\bar{u_0})^7 = \\beta\\bar{\\beta} = 128 = 2^7$. This implies $u_0\\bar{u_0} = 2$ (after possibly rotating $u_0$ by a power of $\\zeta_7$).\n    The roots of $f(x)$ are $x_k = u_k + v_k$. Since $u_k v_k = 2$ and $u_k \\bar{u_k} = u_0\\bar{u_0} = 2$, we have $v_k = \\bar{u_k}$.\n    Thus, the 7 roots of $f(x)$ are $x_k = u_k + \\bar{u_k} = u_0\\zeta_7^k + \\bar{u_0}\\zeta_7^{-k}$ for $k=0, \\dots, 6$.\n\n    The splitting field of $f(x)$ is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(x_0, ..., x_6)$, which is a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(u_0, \\zeta_7)$.\n    The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(f(x)/\\mathbb{Q})$ acts on the set of roots by permuting the indices $\\{0, 1, ..., 6\\}$.\n    We can identify elements of $G$ by considering automorphisms of $K$.\n    - The map $\\rho: u_0 \\mapsto u_0\\zeta_7$ fixes $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$ and sends $x_k \\mapsto x_{k+1}$ (indices mod 7). This corresponds to the 7-cycle $(0,1,2,3,4,5,6)$ on the indices. This implies $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_7$.\n    - The map $\\sigma: \\zeta_7 \\mapsto \\zeta_7^3$ corresponds to an element of $\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q})$. It can be extended to an automorphism of $K$. This map sends $x_k \\mapsto x_{3k}$ or $x_{-3k}=x_{4k}$. The corresponding permutation is $k \\mapsto 4k \\pmod 7$, which has cycle structure $(0)(1,4,2)(3,5,6)$ and is of order 3.\n    - Complex conjugation maps $\\zeta_7 \\mapsto \\zeta_7^{-1}$ and can be chosen to map $u_0 \\mapsto \\bar{u_0}$. This sends $x_k \\mapsto x_{-k}$. The corresponding permutation is $k \\mapsto -k \\pmod 7$, which has cycle structure $(0)(1,6)(2,5)(3,4)$ and is of order 2.\n\n    The group $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_7$ and contains elements of order 7, 3, and 2. The order of $G$ must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(7,3,2) = 42$.\n    The only transitive subgroup of $S_7$ of order 42 is the affine general linear group $AGL_1(7)$.\n    This group consists of permutations of $\\mathbb{F}_7$ of the form $x \\mapsto ax+b$ where $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_7^\\times$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$.\n    So, $G \\cong AGL_1(7)$, which has order $|\\mathbb{F}_7^\\times| \\times |\\mathbb{F}_7| = 6 \\times 7 = 42$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem**\n    The Chebotarev Density Theorem relates the density of primes with a certain splitting behavior to the structure of the Galois group. A key result derived from it states that the density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial remains irreducible modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in its Galois group that act as a single cycle of length equal to the degree of the polynomial.\n    In our case, $f(x)$ has degree 7. We need to find the density of primes $p$ such that $f(x) \\pmod p$ is irreducible. This corresponds to the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_p$ being a 7-cycle in the Galois group $G \\cong AGL_1(7)$.\n\n4.  **Count the 7-cycles in $AGL_1(7)$**\n    An element of $AGL_1(7)$ is a map $g_{a,b}: x \\mapsto ax+b$ on $\\mathbb{F}_7$. We need to find for which pairs $(a,b)$ this map is a 7-cycle. A 7-cycle is a permutation of order 7 with no fixed points.\n    Let's find the fixed points by solving $ax+b=x$:\n    $(a-1)x = -b$.\n\n    -   **Case 1:** $a=1$. The equation becomes $0 = -b$.\n        -   If $b=0$, the map is the identity $x \\mapsto x$. It has 7 fixed points.\n        -   If $b \\neq 0$, the equation is $0=-b$, which has no solution. So, the map $x \\mapsto x+b$ has no fixed points. These are translations on $\\mathbb{F}_7$. The order of such a map is 7, so it is a single 7-cycle. There are 6 such maps, for $b \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n\n    -   **Case 2:** $a \\neq 1$. The equation $(a-1)x=-b$ has a unique solution $x = -b(a-1)^{-1}$.\n        -   Since there is a fixed point, the permutation cannot be a 7-cycle. It must be a permutation of the other 6 elements.\n\n    Therefore, the elements in $G=AGL_1(7)$ that are 7-cycles are precisely the 6 translations ($a=1, b\\neq 0$).\n\n5.  **Calculate the Density**\n    The number of 7-cycles in $G$ is 6.\n    The total number of elements in $G$ is $|G| = 42$.\n    The natural density of the set of primes $p$ where $f(x)$ is irreducible mod $p$ is the ratio:\n    Density = $\\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles in } G}{|G|} = \\frac{6}{42} = \\frac{1}{7}$.\n\nFinal Answer is $1/7$."
