    "This analysis will break down the statement \"The predictive ability of a polygenic score, measured by variance explained, is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the phenotype\" to determine if it is true or false.\n\n### Step 1: Define the key terms\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS), or Polygenic Risk Score (PRS):** This is a score calculated for an individual that summarizes the estimated effect of many genetic variants (SNPs) on their risk of developing a disease or their value for a particular trait. It is constructed as a weighted sum of the person's genotypes, where the weights are derived from the effect sizes estimated in a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS).\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS (R²):** This measures how well the PGS can predict the actual phenotype (trait or disease status) in a *new sample* of individuals not used to create the score. It is quantified as R², the proportion of the total variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS.\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical quantity representing the proportion of total phenotypic variance in a population that can be explained by the additive effects of *all* the common SNPs being considered, assuming we knew their *true* effects. It is not a predictive model itself, but rather a measure of the total genetic signal present in the SNPs. It represents the theoretical ceiling, or the absolute maximum possible R² that any predictive model based *only* on those SNPs could ever achieve.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the concepts\n\nThe core of the question is to compare the *actual* predictive performance of a real-world tool (the PGS) with the *theoretical maximum* possible performance (the SNP heritability).\n\n1.  **SNP heritability is the target:** Think of SNP heritability as the total amount of \"predictive information\" about a trait that is contained within the entire set of common SNPs. It is the upper bound on prediction accuracy. This would be the R² you would get from a \"perfect\" polygenic score built using the true, but unknown, effect sizes for every single SNP.\n\n2.  **PGS is the attempt to reach the target:** A polygenic score is our best attempt to build that \"perfect\" score. However, it is built using *estimated* effect sizes from a GWAS discovery sample. These estimates are not perfect due to several factors:\n    *   **Finite Sample Size:** GWAS are performed on a finite number of people. This means the estimated SNP effects will have some statistical noise or \"sampling error\" and will not be the true effect sizes. The smaller the GWAS, the larger this error.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** GWASs often identify SNPs that are simply correlated with the true causal variants, not the causal variants themselves. Imperfect and population-specific LD patterns can reduce the PGS's accuracy when applied to new samples.\n    *   **Model Simplification:** PGS models often use a subset of SNPs (e.g., those passing a statistical significance threshold) rather than all SNPs, thereby discarding some of the true genetic signal captured in the SNP heritability estimate.\n\n### Step 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nBecause the PGS is built using imperfect, estimated information (the SNP weights from a GWAS), it is an imperfect predictor. An imperfect predictor will not be able to capture the full signal that is theoretically available. The SNP heritability represents the full, theoretical signal.\n\nTherefore, the variance explained by a real-world PGS (R²) will be lower than the total variance that is theoretically explainable by all SNPs (h²_SNP). The PGS predictive ability can approach the SNP heritability as the size of the GWAS used to create it becomes infinitely large (which is impossible), but it can never exceed it. The gap between the SNP heritability and the R² of the best possible PGS reflects the information lost due to the limitations of real-world data and estimation.\n\nThus, the statement is correct.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The term \"necessarily\" is strong, but correct in this context. The PGS is fundamentally an *estimator* of the true genetic value, and the process of estimation from finite data invariably introduces error, which reduces predictive power relative to the theoretical maximum.\n*   The comparison is between the predictive ability (R²) of a score and the SNP heritability (h²_SNP), not between two different *estimates* which could fluctuate due to sampling error. The statement concerns the fundamental properties of these two quantities.\n*   This relationship (R²_PGS < h²_SNP) is a foundational concept in statistical genetics that explains why, for many complex traits, we see a large \"missing heritability\" when comparing prediction R² to heritability estimates.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score is measured by how much variance it explains (R²) in an independent sample. This score is built using effect sizes estimated from a finite GWAS sample. These estimated effects are inherently noisy and imperfect. SNP heritability, on the other hand, represents the total variance explained by the true effects of all SNPs. Because the PGS uses imperfect estimates rather than the true values, its predictive power is fundamentally limited and will be lower than this theoretical maximum.\n\n<<<True>>>"
