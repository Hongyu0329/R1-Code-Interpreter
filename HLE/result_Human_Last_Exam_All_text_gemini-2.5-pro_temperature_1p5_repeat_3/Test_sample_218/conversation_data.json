    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely determined, up to isomorphism, by a partition of $n$. A partition of an integer $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_k)$, where $\\lambda_1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq \\ldots \\geq \\lambda_k > 0$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i = n$.\n\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$, denoted $\\dim(V_\\lambda)$, is given by the hook-length formula:\n$$ \\dim(V_\\lambda) = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in Y(\\lambda)} h_\\lambda(i,j)} $$\nwhere $Y(\\lambda)$ is the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_\\lambda(i,j)$ is the hook length of the cell at position $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of cells to the right in the same row, plus the number of cells below in the same column, plus one for the cell itself.\n\nWe are looking for the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ such that $\\dim(V_\\lambda) < 500,000$.\n\nA key property is that partitions with small dimensions are those whose Young diagrams are \"long and thin\". That is, they have a very large first part $\\lambda_1$, or a very large number of parts $k$ (which corresponds to a large first part in the conjugate partition $\\lambda'$). The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is equal to the dimension of the irrep for its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$, i.e., $\\dim(V_\\lambda) = \\dim(V_{\\lambda'})$.\n\nWe can systematically search for these partitions by fixing the first part $\\lambda_1$ to be large and checking all possible partitions for the remaining sum.\n\nLet $\\lambda_1 = k$. The remaining parts must sum to $25-k$.\n\n*   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 25$**: The only partition is $\\lambda=(25)$. The diagram is a single row. The dimension is $\\dim(V_{(25)}) = 1$. The conjugate partition is $\\lambda'=(1^{25})$, which also has dimension 1. Both are less than 500,000. This gives 2 irreps.\n\n*   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 24$**: The remaining part is 1. The only partition is $\\lambda=(24,1)$. The dimension is $\\dim(V_{(24,1)}) = 24$. The conjugate is $\\lambda'=(2, 1^{23})$, with dimension 24. This gives 2 irreps.\n\n*   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 23$**: The remaining parts sum to 2. The partitions of 2 are $(2)$ and $(1,1)$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,2)$: $\\dim(V_{(23,2)}) = 275$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,1,1)$: $\\dim(V_{(23,1,1)}) = 276$.\n    Both dimensions are < 500,000. These two partitions and their conjugates give $2 \\times 2 = 4$ irreps.\n\n*   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 22$**: The remaining parts sum to 3. The partitions of 3 are $(3), (2,1), (1,1,1)$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,3)$: $\\dim(V_{(22,3)}) = 2000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$: $\\dim(V_{(22,2,1)}) = 1925$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,1,1,1)$: $\\dim(V_{(22,1,1,1)}) = 2024$.\n    All are < 500,000. This gives $3 \\times 2 = 6$ irreps.\n\n*   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 21$**: The remaining parts sum to 4. There are $p(4)=5$ partitions of 4. We check the dimension for each corresponding partition of 25.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,4)$: $\\dim=10,350$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,3,1)$: $\\dim=19,950$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,2)$: $\\dim=21,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,1,1)$: $\\dim=31,625$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,1,1,1,1)$: $\\dim=10,626$.\n    All are < 500,000. This gives $5 \\times 2 = 10$ irreps.\n\n*   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 20$**: The remaining parts sum to 5. There are $p(5)=7$ partitions of 5.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,5)$: $\\dim=40,480$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,4,1)$: $\\dim=134,596$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,3,2)$: $\\dim=141,900$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,3,1,1)$: $\\dim=212,850$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,2,2,1)$: $\\dim=218,750$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,2,1,1,1)$: $\\dim=292,825$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,1,1,1,1,1)$: $\\dim=42,504$.\n    All are < 500,000. This gives $7 \\times 2 = 14$ irreps.\n\n*   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 19$**: The remaining parts sum to 6. There are $p(6)=11$ partitions of 6.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,6)$: $\\dim=123,970$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,5,1)$: $\\dim=296,010$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,4,2)$: $\\dim=303,600$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,4,1,1)$: $\\dim=463,750$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,3,3)$: $\\dim=326,025$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,3,2,1)$: $\\dim=607,200 (> 500,000)$. Further partitions in the dominance order will have even larger dimensions.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,1,1,1,1,1,1)$: $\\dim=134,596$.\n    We find 6 such partitions. This gives $6 \\times 2 = 12$ irreps.\n\n*   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 18$**: The remaining parts sum to 7. There are $p(7)=15$ partitions of 7.\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,7)$: $\\dim=303,600$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,6,1)$: $\\dim=600,875 (> 500,000)$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)$: $\\dim=346,104$.\n    According to the dominance ordering of partitions, since $\\dim(V_{(18,6,1)})$ is too large, so will the dimensions for all partitions $\\lambda=(18,p)$ where $p$ is dominated by $(6,1)$. This leaves only $(18,7)$ and $(18, 1^7)$. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ irreps.\n\n*   **Case $\\lambda_1 = 17$**: The remaining parts sum to 8.\n    *   $\\dim(V_{(17,8)}) = 600,875 (> 500,000)$.\n    *   $\\dim(V_{(17,1^8)}) = 735,471 (> 500,000)$.\n    Since these are the most \"long and thin\" shapes for $\\lambda_1=17$, all other partitions with $\\lambda_1=17$ will have even larger dimensions. So there are no solutions for $\\lambda_1=17$.\n\n*   **Case $\\lambda_1 < 17$**: The dimensions will continue to increase. For example, $\\dim(V_{(16,9)}) = 961,400$. So there are no more solutions.\n\nThe partitions we found are:\n- When $\\lambda_1=25$: 1 partition, (25).\n- When $\\lambda_1=24$: 1 partition, (24,1).\n- When $\\lambda_1=23$: 2 partitions.\n- When $\\lambda_1=22$: 3 partitions.\n- When $\\lambda_1=21$: 5 partitions.\n- When $\\lambda_1=20$: 7 partitions.\n- When $\\lambda_1=19$: 6 partitions.\n- When $\\lambda_1=18$: 2 partitions.\n\nTotal number of partitions found this way is $1+1+2+3+5+7+6+2=27$.\n\nNone of these 27 partitions are self-conjugate (a self-conjugate partition must have its first part equal to its number of parts, e.g. $\\lambda=(3,2,1)$ for $n=6$). Since none are self-conjugate, for each partition $\\lambda$ in our list, its conjugate $\\lambda'$ is a distinct partition that also gives an irrep with the same dimension. For example, for $\\lambda=(23,2)$, its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(2,2,1^{21})$. $\\dim(V_{(2,2,1^{21})}) = 275$. The conjugate partitions have first parts $\\lambda'_1 \\leq 8$, and we have already verified that no solution has $\\lambda_1 \\leq 17$. So the set of 27 partitions and the set of their conjugates are disjoint.\n\nTherefore, the total number of irreducible representations is twice the number of partitions we found.\nTotal irreps = $27 \\times 2 = 54$.\n\nFinal Count:\n- (25) and its conjugate (1^25): 2 irreps.\n- (24,1) and its conjugate: 2 irreps.\n- (23,...) : 2 partitions and their conjugates: 4 irreps.\n- (22,...) : 3 partitions and their conjugates: 6 irreps.\n- (21,...) : 5 partitions and their conjugates: 10 irreps.\n- (20,...) : 7 partitions and their conjugates: 14 irreps.\n- (19,...) : 6 partitions and their conjugates: 12 irreps.\n- (18,...) : 2 partitions and their conjugates: 4 irreps.\nTotal: $2+2+4+6+10+14+12+4 = 54$."
