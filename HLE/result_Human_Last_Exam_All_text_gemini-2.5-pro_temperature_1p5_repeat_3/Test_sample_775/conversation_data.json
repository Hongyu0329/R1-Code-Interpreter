    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** We are given two sets, A and B, in the plane (ℝ²).\n    *   They are **closed**: They contain all their boundary points.\n    *   They are **connected**: They are \"in one piece\".\n    *   Their union is the **unit square** `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`. This implies both A and B are subsets of S and are therefore compact.\n    *   We need to find the maximum possible number of **connected components** of their intersection, `A ∩ B`. A connected component is a maximal connected subset.\n\n2.  **Simple Examples:**\n    *   Let A be the left half of the square, `A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1]`.\n    *   Let B be the right half, `B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n    *   Both are closed and connected. Their union is S.\n    *   Their intersection is the line segment `{1/2} x [0, 1]`, which is connected. So, the number of components is 1.\n    *   Let A be a closed disk in the center of S, and `B = cl(S \\ A)` (the closure of the square minus the interior of the disk). A is connected. B is a closed annulus, which is also connected. Their union is S. Their intersection `A ∩ B` is the boundary of the disk, which is a circle, hence connected. The number of components is 1.\n\n3.  **An attempt with Algebraic Topology (Mayer-Vietoris Sequence):**\n    *   For a space `X` that is the union of two subspaces `A` and `B`, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence relates the homology groups of `X`, `A`, `B`, and `A ∩ B`.\n    *   The relevant part of the sequence for 0-dimensional homology (which counts path-components) is:\n        `H_1(S) → H_0(A ∩ B) → H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) → H_0(S) → 0`\n    *   Let's analyze the rank of these groups (the number of path-components, which is an lower bound for the number of connected components):\n        *   `H_0(A)` has rank 1 (since A is connected, it has 1 path-component).\n        *   `H_0(B)` has rank 1 (B is connected).\n        *   `H_0(S)` has rank 1 (S is connected).\n        *   `H_1(S)` is the first homology group of the square. Since the square is contractible (can be shrunk to a point), `H_1(S) = 0`.\n        *   Let `n_p` be the number of path-components of `A ∩ B`. `H_0(A ∩ B)` has rank `n_p`.\n    *   The sequence is exact. The map `H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) → H_0(S)` is surjective, and its kernel has rank 1.\n    *   By exactness, the image of the map `H_0(A ∩ B) → H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B)` must be equal to this kernel, so its image must have rank 1.\n    *   By the rank-nullity theorem, `rank(H_0(A ∩ B)) = rank(image) + rank(kernel)`. This gives `n_p = 1 + rank(kernel)`.\n    *   Again, by exactness, this kernel is the image of the map from `H_1(S)`. Since `H_1(S) = 0`, the image is 0, so the kernel has rank 0.\n    *   This leads to the conclusion `n_p - 1 = 0`, which means `n_p = 1`. This implies `A ∩ B` has only one path-component, which in turn implies it has only one connected component.\n\n4.  **The Flaw in the Argument:**\n    *   The Mayer-Vietoris sequence as stated above is not guaranteed to be exact for any arbitrary pair of closed sets A and B. A common condition for the sequence to hold is that the union of the interiors of A and B covers the space (`Int(A) ∪ Int(B) = S`). This condition is not necessarily met.\n    *   More generally, the sequence holds if the triad `(S; A, B)` is \"excisive\". For closed sets A and B whose union is S, this requires `cl(A \\ B) ∩ cl(B \\ A) = ∅`. However, the intersection of these closures is precisely `A ∩ B`. So, this condition would require `A ∩ B = ∅`, which is not true (as S would be disconnected).\n    *   Therefore, this powerful homological argument is not applicable, and its conclusion that the number of components is 1 is not necessarily correct.\n\n5.  **Constructions and Literature:**\n    *   This is a well-known problem in topology (sometimes called Zylev's problem). It has been shown that for any integer `N > 0`, it is possible to construct two closed connected sets A and B whose union is the unit square and whose intersection has exactly `N` connected components.\n    *   These constructions typically involve creating sets that are highly \"intertwined\" and pathologically complex, for example, using variations of the Lakes of Wada or indecomposable continua.\n    *   A simplified idea for getting `N` components: Start with a central shape for B (like a vertical spine) and let A be the rest of the square. A is not connected. To connect the parts of A, one can add `N` disjoint \"arms\" that cross B. The intersection of these arms with B will form `N` disjoint components of `A ∩ B`. With careful construction, A can be made connected, and so can B, while maintaining the disjoint intersection components.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the \"Largest Number\":**\n    *   Since it is possible to construct examples where the intersection `A ∩ B` has `N` components for *any* positive integer `N`, there is no finite upper bound on the number of components.\n    *   Therefore, there is no \"largest number\" of components. The set of possible numbers of components is the set of all positive integers `{1, 2, 3, ...}`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe problem asks for the largest number of components. Based on established results in topology, for any positive integer `N`, it is possible to construct two closed connected subsets of the unit square whose union is the square and whose intersection has exactly `N` components. Therefore, there is no largest number.\n\nSince a numerical answer might be expected in a test format, this suggests a misunderstanding of the problem's nature or a flawed question. If the sets were restricted to be \"nice\" (e.g., finite polyhedra or submanifolds with boundary), the answer would likely be different and bounded. Without such restrictions, no finite maximum exists. However, as no such restrictions are provided, the conclusion must be that there is no upper bound. If the question must be answered with a \"number\", it's an ill-posed problem, but the mathematical reality is that the number can be arbitrarily large. The prompt format cannot be fulfilled with a number.\n\nThere is no largest number. Any positive integer `n` is a possible number of components for the intersection."
