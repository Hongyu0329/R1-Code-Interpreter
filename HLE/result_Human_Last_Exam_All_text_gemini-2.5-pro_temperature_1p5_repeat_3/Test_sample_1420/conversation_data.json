    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Scaling Exponent α:** This exponent describes the singular behavior of the specific heat (C) near the critical temperature (Tc). The relationship is given by C ∝ |t|^(-α), where t = (T - Tc)/Tc is the reduced temperature. A positive α implies a divergent specific heat at the critical point.\n*   **Renormalization Group (RG) Theory:** A theoretical framework used to understand critical phenomena and phase transitions. It systematically studies how a system's properties change under a change of scale.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** The spatial dimension above which the critical exponents of a system take on their simple \"mean-field theory\" values. For the class of models we are considering (like the Ising, XY, or Heisenberg models, generally known as O(N) models), the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4.\n*   **Epsilon (ϵ) Expansion:** A key technique in RG theory developed by Wilson and Fisher. It involves calculating critical exponents as a power series in the small parameter ϵ = d_c - d. This method is formally valid for dimensions d just below d_c (i.e., ϵ ≪ 1), but it provides surprisingly good estimates even when ϵ is set to 1 (which corresponds to d=3).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Physical Laws and Formulas\n\nThe calculation relies on two key results from RG theory:\n\n1.  **Hyperscaling Relation:** This relation connects the specific heat exponent α to the spatial dimension d and the correlation length exponent ν. The correlation length ξ diverges as ξ ∝ |t|^(-ν). The relation is:\n    `2 - α = dν`\n\n2.  **Epsilon Expansion for ν:** The RG analysis for the O(N) model (a model with an N-component order parameter) gives the correlation length exponent ν as a series in ϵ. To the first order in ϵ, the result is:\n    `ν ≈ 1/2 + (N + 2) / (4 * (N + 8)) * ϵ`\n\n### Step 3: Set Up the Calculation\n\nWe are given:\n*   Spatial dimension: `d = 3`\n*   Upper critical dimension: `d_c = 4`\n\nFrom this, we calculate our expansion parameter ϵ:\n*   `ϵ = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1`\n\nWe also need to express the dimension `d` in terms of ϵ for use in the hyperscaling relation:\n*   `d = d_c - ϵ = 4 - ϵ`\n\nThe question does not specify the number of components `N` of the order parameter. The phrase \"a system\" is generic, and in this context, it is standard practice to assume the most fundamental and commonly studied case, the **Ising model**, for which `N = 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Start with the hyperscaling relation:**\n    `α = 2 - dν`\n\n2.  **Substitute the expressions for `d` and `ν` in terms of ϵ:**\n    `α = 2 - (4 - ϵ) * [1/2 + (N + 2) / (4 * (N + 8)) * ϵ]`\n\n3.  **Expand the product, keeping only terms up to the first order in ϵ (O(ϵ)).** This is because our formula for ν is only accurate to this order.\n    `α ≈ 2 - [ (4 * 1/2) + (4 * (N + 2) / (4 * (N + 8)) * ϵ) - (ϵ * 1/2) ]`\n    We ignore the term `(-ϵ) * ((N + 2) / (4 * (N + 8)) * ϵ)` as it is of order ϵ².\n\n4.  **Simplify the expression:**\n    `α ≈ 2 - [ 2 + (N + 2) / (N + 8) * ϵ - ϵ / 2 ]`\n    `α ≈ 2 - 2 - (N + 2) / (N + 8) * ϵ + ϵ / 2`\n    `α ≈ [ 1/2 - (N + 2) / (N + 8) ] * ϵ`\n\n5.  **Combine the terms inside the bracket by finding a common denominator:**\n    `α ≈ [ (N + 8) - 2(N + 2) ] / [ 2(N + 8) ] * ϵ`\n    `α ≈ [ N + 8 - 2N - 4 ] / [ 2(N + 8) ] * ϵ`\n    `α ≈ [ 4 - N ] / [ 2(N + 8) ] * ϵ`\n    This is the general formula for α to first order in ϵ for the O(N) model.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nNow, we substitute the specific values for our problem into the derived formula.\n*   `N = 1` (Ising model)\n*   `ϵ = 1` (for d=3)\n\n`α ≈ [ 4 - 1 ] / [ 2 * (1 + 8) ] * 1`\n`α ≈ 3 / [ 2 * 9 ]`\n`α ≈ 3 / 18`\n`α ≈ 1/6`\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Model Assumption:** The result depends on N. Assuming N=1 (Ising model) is a critical step based on convention for such a generic question.\n*   **Validity of ϵ=1:** The epsilon expansion is an asymptotic series, most accurate for small ϵ. Using ϵ=1 is a formal extrapolation, but one that has proven to be remarkably effective in statistical physics for getting reasonable estimates for d=3.\n*   **Hyperscaling Dimension:** It is crucial to use `d = 4 - ϵ` in the hyperscaling relation, not `d = 4` or `d = 3` directly at the start. The consistent expansion of all quantities in terms of ϵ is what makes the calculation work.\n\nThe calculated value of α ≈ 1/6 ≈ 0.167. This first-order approximation is reasonably close to the best known numerical estimates for the 3D Ising model, which is α ≈ 0.110.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
