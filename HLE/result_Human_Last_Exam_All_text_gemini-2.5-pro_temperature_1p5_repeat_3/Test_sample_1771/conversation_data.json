    "This question requires tracing a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root through several stages of sound change into Proto-Germanic and its daughter languages: Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the PIE Root:**\n    *   The form given is `*seh₂g-ie-ti`. The root is `*seh₂g-`. The `-ie-ti` part indicates a present tense verb form.\n    *   The cognates provided, Latin `sāgīre` and Hittite `sākizzi`, both point to a long vowel in the root. This suggests the PIE form was likely a long-grade form, `*sēh₂g-`. The meaning is 'to track, seek out, perceive'.\n\n2.  **From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc):**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Laryngeal effect.** The laryngeal consonant `*h₂` disappears in Proto-Germanic, but not before coloring the preceding vowel. The sequence PIE `*ēh₂` becomes PGmc `*ā`. Therefore, PIE `*sēh₂g-` becomes the stem `*sāg-` in pre-Proto-Germanic.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Grimm's Law.** This is the fundamental consonant shift from PIE to PGmc. The PIE voiced velar stop `*g` becomes the PGmc voiceless velar stop `*k`. The initial `*s` is not affected. So, `*sāg-` becomes `*sāk-`.\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Verb Class.** The PIE `*-ie/o-` suffix commonly results in a Class 1 weak verb in Germanic. These verbs are formed with the suffix `*-janą`. When the root `*sāk-` is combined with `*-janą`, a phonological rule applies: `*ā` becomes `*ō` when followed by `*j` in the next syllable.\n    *   **Result:** `*sāk-` + `*-janą` -> `*sōkijaną`. This is the reconstructed Proto-Germanic infinitive for 'to seek'.\n\n3.  **From Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages:**\n    *   The starting form for all subsequent languages is PGmc `*sōkijaną`. The key processes will be i-umlaut, consonant shifts, and changes to infinitive endings.\n\n    *   **Old Norse (ON):**\n        *   **Careful Point: I-umlaut.** The `*i` (from the original `*j`) in the suffix causes the root vowel `*ō` to be fronted and rounded, becoming `œ`.\n        *   The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` reduces to `-a`. The `*j` is often retained in spelling.\n        *   **Result:** `*sōkijaną` > `sœkja`.\n\n    *   **Old English (OE):**\n        *   **Careful Point: I-umlaut.** As in Old Norse, i-umlaut affects the root vowel. PGmc `*ō` is fronted to `ē`.\n        *   **Careful Point: Palatalization.** In Old English, the velar consonant `*k` was palatalized to an affricate `c` (pronounced /tʃ/) when next to a front vowel like the newly formed `ē`.\n        *   The `*j` of the suffix is lost after a long root syllable, and the infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an`.\n        *   **Result:** `*sōkijaną` > `*sōkjan` > `*sēkjan` (umlaut) > `sēcan` (palatalization and loss of `j`).\n\n    *   **Old High German (OHG):**\n        *   **Careful Point: Diphthongization.** PGmc `*ō` regularly becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German.\n        *   **Careful Point: High German Consonant Shift.** PGmc `*k` shifts to the long (geminated) voiceless fricative `hh` (pronounced /xx/) when it follows a vowel. The `*j` is assimilated into this geminated consonant.\n        *   I-umlaut of `uo` to `üe` occurs in OHG, but it is not consistently written in the infinitive form.\n        *   The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-en`.\n        *   **Result:** `*sōkijaną` > `*suokjan` > `suohhen`.\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** The PIE root `*sēh₂g-` becomes `*sāk-` through Grimm's Law and laryngeal loss. As a Class 1 weak verb, this gives the infinitive `*sōkijaną`.\n*   **Old Norse:** I-umlaut changes `*ō` to `œ`, giving `sœkja`.\n*   **Old English:** I-umlaut changes `*ō` to `ē`, and subsequent palatalization changes `k` to `c` (/tʃ/), giving `sēcan`.\n*   **Old High German:** Diphthongization changes `*ō` to `uo`, and the High German Consonant Shift changes `k` to `hh`, giving `suohhen`.\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną\nOld Norse: sœkja\nOld English: sēcan\nOld High German: suohhen>>>"
