    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Board and Attack Rules\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around. Row 1 is adjacent to row 5, and column 1 is adjacent to column 5. We can use 0-indexed coordinates (0 to 4) for easier calculations with modulo arithmetic.\n*   **Queens:** 4 queens are to be placed.\n*   **Non-attacking:** Two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other if they share a row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, this means:\n    1.  `r1 = r2` (same row)\n    2.  `c1 = c2` (same column)\n    3.  `r1 - c1 ≡ r2 - c2 (mod 5)` (same main diagonal)\n    4.  `r1 + c1 ≡ r2 + c2 (mod 5)` (same anti-diagonal)\n\nFor a valid placement of 4 queens `{(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)}`, the following four sets must each contain 4 distinct elements:\n*   The set of rows: `{r1, r2, r3, r4}`\n*   The set of columns: `{c1, c2, c3, c4}`\n*   The set of main diagonals (d-indices): `{(r1-c1) mod 5, ..., (r4-c4) mod 5}`\n*   The set of anti-diagonals (s-indices): `{(r1+c1) mod 5, ..., (r4+c4) mod 5}`\n\n### Step 2: Method 1 - Direct Counting using Symmetry\n\nWe can find the total number of solutions, `N`, by first finding the number of solutions that include a queen at a specific square, say `(0,0)`, and then using the board's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Fix one queen:** Place the first queen, Q1, at `(0,0)`.\n\n2.  **Identify available squares:** A queen at `(0,0)` attacks all squares `(r,c)` where `r=0`, `c=0`, `r=c`, or `r+c ≡ 0 (mod 5)`. This totals 17 squares (including `(0,0)` itself). The remaining `25 - 17 = 8` squares are available for the other three queens. These squares are:\n    `A = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3)}`\n\n3.  **Place the second queen:** Choose a position for the second queen, Q2, from set `A`. Let's pick `Q2 = (1,2)`.\n\n4.  **Find remaining squares:** Now we find which squares in `A` are attacked by `Q2 = (1,2)`.\n    *   Row 1 attack: `(1,3)`\n    *   Column 2 attack: `(4,2)`\n    *   Main diagonal `r-c ≡ -1 (mod 5)` attack: `(3,4)` is attacked since `3-4 = -1`.\n    *   Anti-diagonal `r+c ≡ 3 (mod 5)` attack: `(2,1)` is attacked since `2+1 = 3`.\n    The remaining available squares in `A` for Q3 and Q4 are `A'' = {(2,4), (3,1), (4,3)}`.\n\n5.  **Place the last two queens:** We need to choose 2 non-attacking queens from `A''`. Let's check if the pairs from `A''` attack each other.\n    *   `(2,4)` and `(3,1)`: Non-attacking.\n    *   `(2,4)` and `(4,3)`: Non-attacking.\n    *   `(3,1)` and `(4,3)`: Non-attacking.\n    Since all three points in `A''` are mutually non-attacking, we can choose any two. The number of ways to do this is `C(3,2) = 3`.\n\n6.  **Generalize the count:** Due to the board's symmetries, the number of ways to complete the set is 3, regardless of which of the 8 squares in `A` we choose for Q2.\n    *   This gives `8 * 3 = 24` ordered triplets `(Q2, Q3, Q4)` that can be combined with `Q1=(0,0)`.\n    *   However, we are counting unordered sets of queens `{Q2, Q3, Q4}`. Each valid set will be counted 3 times in the procedure above (once for each queen chosen as \"Q2\").\n    *   So, the number of solutions containing a queen at `(0,0)` is `24 / 3 = 8`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the total number of solutions:** Let `N` be the total number of solutions. Let `N_p` be the number of solutions containing a queen at position `p`.\n    The sum of the sizes of all solutions is `4 * N`. This can also be expressed as the sum of `N_p` over all 25 positions `p`.\n    `4 * N = Σ N_p`\n    By the toroidal symmetry, `N_p` is the same for every position `p`. We found `N_{(0,0)} = 8`.\n    `4 * N = 25 * N_{(0,0)} = 25 * 8 = 200`\n    `N = 200 / 4 = 50`\n\n### Step 3: Method 2 - Relating 4-Queens to 5-Queens Solutions\n\nThis method connects the problem of `k=n-1` queens to the problem of `n` queens.\n\n1.  **The \"Hole\" Concept:** A valid 4-queen configuration leaves exactly one row, one column, one main diagonal, and one anti-diagonal unused. Let the indices of these \"holes\" be `r_x, c_x, d_x, s_x`.\n\n2.  **Relating Holes:** A mathematical relationship exists between these hole indices. The sum of all indices (0 to 4) is `10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`. For the four placed queens, `sum(r_i) ≡ -r_x (mod 5)`, and similarly for `c, d, s`. This leads to the relations:\n    *   `r_x ≡ 3(d_x + s_x) (mod 5)`\n    *   `c_x ≡ 3(s_x - d_x) (mod 5)`\n    This means that if we add a fifth queen at this \"hole\" position `(r_x, c_x)`, its diagonal indices will be `d_x` and `s_x`. Therefore, any 4-queen configuration can be uniquely extended to a 5-queen solution.\n\n3.  **Counting from 5-Queen Solutions:** This implies that the set of all 4-queen solutions can be generated by taking all possible 5-queen solutions and removing one queen from each, in every possible way.\n    *   The number of 5-queen solutions on a 5x5 toroidal board is a known result. There are exactly **10** such solutions.\n    *   From each of these 10 solutions, we can remove any of the 5 queens to obtain a valid 4-queen configuration. This gives `10 * 5 = 50` configurations.\n\n4.  **Uniqueness:** We must ensure these 50 configurations are all distinct. This requires showing that any two of the 10 five-queen solutions do not share 4 or more queens. It can be verified that the 10 fundamental solutions intersect at most at a single point. Thus, removing one queen from two different 5-queen solutions will always result in two different 4-queen configurations.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens is `10 (5-queen solutions) * 5 (choices of queen to remove) = 50`.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same result.\n\nThe final answer is 50.\n\n<<<50>>>"
