    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\n### Step 1: Rewrite the equation using the definition of complex exponentiation\n\nThe right side of the equation, $i^z$, is a multi-valued complex exponentiation. The general definition is $a^b = e^{b \\ln(a)}$. The complex logarithm $\\ln(a)$ is also multi-valued:\n$\\ln(a) = \\text{Log}(|a|) + i(\\text{Arg}(a) + 2k\\pi)$, for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $\\text{Log}$ is the real natural logarithm and $\\text{Arg}(a)$ is the principal argument of $a$.\n\nFor the base $i$, we have $|i|=1$ and $\\text{Arg}(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nSo, $\\ln(i) = \\text{Log}(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\n\nThe equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ means that $z\\cdot i$ must be equal to one of the possible values of $i^z$. Therefore, for some integer $k$:\n$z\\cdot i = e^{z \\ln(i)} = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n\n### Step 2: Introduce a substitution and solve using the Lambert W function\n\nLet's simplify the equation. A common term is $z \\cdot i$. Let $w = z \\cdot i$.\nThen the equation becomes:\n$w = e^{w(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n\nThis equation is of the form $w = e^{cw}$, which can be solved using the Lambert W function. The Lambert W function, denoted $W(x)$, is defined as the function satisfying the equation $W(x)e^{W(x)} = x$. Since the logarithm is multi-valued, the Lambert W function is also multi-valued, with branches denoted by $W_n(x)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's rearrange our equation to match the form for the Lambert W function:\n$w = e^{w(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n$w e^{-w(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = 1$\nMultiply by $-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$:\n$-w(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) e^{-w(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$\n\nThis matches the form $Y e^Y = X$ with $Y = -w(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ and $X = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nThe solution is $Y = W_n(X)$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function for any integer $n$.\n$-w(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$\n$w = -\\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\n\n### Step 3: Express the solution in terms of z\n\nSince $w = z \\cdot i$, we have $z = \\frac{w}{i} = -iw$.\n$z = -i \\left( -\\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi} \\right) = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\n\nThis is the general form for all solutions, parameterized by two integers, $k$ and $n$.\nLet $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}$. The general solution is:\n$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-A_k)}{A_k}$ for $k, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 4: Classify the solutions\n\nWe can classify the solutions by analyzing the argument of the Lambert W function, $X = -A_k$.\n\n**Case 1: Real Solutions**\nWe test for simple real solutions by substitution into the original equation.\n*   If $z=1$: $1 \\cdot i = i$. For the right side, $i^1=i$. This holds if we choose the principal branch of the logarithm ($k=0$). Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n*   If $z=-1$: $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$. For the right side, $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. This also holds for the principal branch ($k=0$). Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\nThese solutions are contained within the general formula.\n*   $z=1$ corresponds to $(k,n) = (0,-1)$, since $1 = i \\frac{W_{-1}(-\\pi/2)}{\\pi/2}$.\n*   $z=-1$ corresponds to $(k,n) = (0,0)$, since $-1 = i \\frac{W_{0}(-\\pi/2)}{\\pi/2}$.\n\n**Case 2: Purely Imaginary Solutions**\nA solution $z_{k,n}$ is purely imaginary if $i \\frac{W_n(-A_k)}{A_k}$ is a purely imaginary number. This means $\\frac{W_n(-A_k)}{A_k}$ must be a real number. Since $A_k$ is always real, $W_n(-A_k)$ must be real.\n\nThe function $W_n(x)$ gives real values only for real argument $x \\ge -1/e$. The only branch that gives real values for $x>0$ is the principal branch $W_0(x)$. For $x \\in [-1/e, 0)$, both $W_0(x)$ and $W_{-1}(x)$ are real.\n\nLet's check the argument $X = -A_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)$.\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $A_k \\ge \\pi/2$. Thus $-A_k \\le -\\pi/2 \\approx -1.57$. Since $-1.57 < -1/e \\approx -0.368$, the argument is in the range where $W_n(x)$ has no real values. So there are no purely imaginary solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n*   If $k \\le -1$, then $A_k$ is negative, so $-A_k$ is positive. For a positive argument, only the principal branch $W_0(-A_k)$ is real. Thus, purely imaginary solutions occur for $n=0$ and $k \\le -1$.\n\nLet $k = -m$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n$A_k = A_{-m} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2m\\pi = -\\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2}$.\nThe purely imaginary solutions are:\n$z_{-m,0} = i \\frac{W_0(-A_{-m})}{A_{-m}} = i \\frac{W_0(\\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2})}{-\\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2}} = -i \\frac{W_0(\\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2})}{\\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2}}$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n**Case 3: Other Complex Solutions**\nAll other combinations of integers $(k, n)$ yield complex solutions where both the real and imaginary parts are non-zero.\n*   For $k \\ge 0$, $-A_k < -1/e$. For such arguments, $W_n(-A_k)$ is complex for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This family includes the real solutions $z=\\pm 1$ for $(k,n)=(0,0)$ and $(0,-1)$, and infinite other complex solutions.\n*   For $k \\le -1$, $-A_k > 0$. For such arguments, $W_n(-A_k)$ is complex for all $n \\ne 0$. This gives another infinite set of complex solutions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe set of all solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ to the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ is given by:\n$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\nfor all integers $k, n$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function.\n\nThese solutions can be categorized as follows:\n\n1.  **Real solutions**:\n    $z = 1$ and $z = -1$.\n\n2.  **Purely imaginary solutions**: An infinite set of solutions given by\n    $z_m = -i \\frac{W_0(\\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2})}{\\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2}}$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$,\n    where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n\n3.  **Other complex solutions**: All other solutions are complex with non-zero real and imaginary parts. These are given by the general formula for all pairs $(k,n)$ not listed above. This includes:\n    *   $k \\ge 0$, and $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (this set contains the real solutions for $(k,n) = (0, -1)$ and $(k,n) = (0, 0)$).\n    *   $k \\le -1$, and $n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\n<<<\nThe solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ are given by the formula:\n$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\nfor all integers $k$ and $n$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function.\n\nThese solutions can be classified into three types:\n1.  **Real solutions**: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  **Purely imaginary solutions**: An infinite series of solutions $z_m = -i \\frac{W_0\\left(\\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2}\\right)}{\\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2}}$ for all positive integers $m=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n3.  **Other complex solutions**: An infinite number of complex solutions with non-zero real and imaginary parts, corresponding to all pairs of integers $(k, n)$ not covered by the cases above.\n>>>"
