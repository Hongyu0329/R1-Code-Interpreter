    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Location of Waskaganish:**\n    *   Waskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec, Canada.\n    *   Its specific location is on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. The question refers to the \"Waskaganish gathering place,\" which we can interpret as the community of Waskaganish itself.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Nearby Provinces and Territories:**\n    *   By examining a map of Canada centered on James Bay, we can identify the provinces and territories that border this region.\n    *   **Quebec:** This is the province where Waskaganish is located, so it must be excluded from the final answer.\n    *   **Ontario:** The province of Ontario lies directly to the west and south of James Bay.\n    *   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands located within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n    *   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** This province is located far to the east of Waskaganish and is clearly not the closest.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Proximity of Ontario:**\n    *   The border between Quebec and Ontario runs along the southern shore of James Bay.\n    *   Waskaganish is situated on the southeastern shore. The land border with Ontario is located a relatively short distance to the southwest, following the coastline of the bay. This land border represents the closest point of the province of Ontario to Waskaganish.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Proximity of Nunavut:**\n    *   The territory of Nunavut's closest point to Waskaganish would be one of the islands in James Bay.\n    *   The largest and most prominent island is Akimiski Island, located in the middle-western part of the bay, northwest of Waskaganish.\n    *   The distance from Waskaganish across the open water to the shore of Akimiski Island is considerably greater than the distance to the land border with Ontario.\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    *   The distance from Waskaganish to the **land border with Ontario** along the southern edge of James Bay is the shortest distance to any province or territory outside of Quebec.\n    *   The distance to the islands of **Nunavut** is further.\n    *   The distance to the mainland of Ontario directly across the bay is also further than the distance to the land border.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Political Geography:** It is crucial to understand that the islands within James Bay are politically part of Nunavut, while the mainland to the west and south is Ontario.\n*   **Land vs. Water Distance:** The shortest distance is not necessarily across the main body of water. In this case, the land border connecting Quebec and Ontario at the southern end of the bay is closer to Waskaganish than any other jurisdiction.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Gathering Place\":** Assuming the \"gathering place\" is the community of Waskaganish is the most logical approach, and a more specific location within the community would not alter the final answer due to the large scale of the geography involved.\n\nBased on this analysis, the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
