    "**Step 1: Understanding the structure of $\\Delta$ as a 2-category**\n\nThe simplex category, $\\Delta$, is given a 2-categorical structure by viewing it as a subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, the category of partially ordered sets.\n*   **Objects (0-cells):** The objects are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. These are viewed as posets with the standard ordering $0 \\le 1 \\le 2 \\le \\ldots$.\n*   **Morphisms (1-cells):** A morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving (or monotone) map between the posets. This means that if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-Morphisms (2-cells):** For two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$, denoted $f \\Rightarrow g$, exists if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. Since for any two morphisms $f, g$, there is at most one 2-morphism between them (either $f \\le g$ or not), this makes each hom-set $\\text{Hom}([m], [n])$ a poset. This is what \"locally posetal\" means.\n\n**Step 2: Defining an internal adjunction in $\\Delta$**\n\nWe are looking for the number of internal adjunctions in $\\Delta$ from the object $[23]$ to the object $[37]$. An internal adjunction from an object $X$ to an object $Y$ in a 2-category consists of:\n1.  A pair of 1-morphisms: $L: X \\to Y$ and $R: Y \\to X$.\n2.  A pair of 2-morphisms: a unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_X \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and a counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\text{id}_Y$.\n3.  These must satisfy the triangle identities.\n\nIn our specific case, this means we need:\n1.  An order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n2.  An order-preserving map $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n3.  A unit 2-morphism $\\eta: \\text{id}_{[23]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$. According to the definition of 2-morphisms in $\\Delta$, this means $\\text{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$ for all $i \\in [23]$, which simplifies to $i \\le R(L(i))$.\n4.  A counit 2-morphism $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\text{id}_{[37]}$. This means $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\text{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$, which simplifies to $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n\nThe triangle identities are automatically satisfied in any poset-enriched category. The conditions $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j$, for a pair of order-preserving maps $L$ and $R$, is precisely the definition of a **Galois connection** between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$.\n\n**Step 3: Relating adjunctions to order-preserving maps**\n\nThe condition for a Galois connection between posets $P$ and $Q$ is that for a pair of monotone maps $L:P \\to Q$ and $R:Q \\to P$, we have $L(p) \\le q \\iff p \\le R(q)$ for all $p \\in P, q \\in Q$. This single condition implies the two inequalities we derived above.\n\nCrucially, an adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left part $L$ or its right part $R$.\n*   Given a monotone map $L: [23] \\to [37]$, if a right adjoint $R$ exists, it must be unique and defined by the formula:\n    $R(j) = \\max \\{i \\in [23] \\mid L(i) \\le j\\}$.\n    Since $[23]$ is a finite, totally ordered set, this maximum always exists for any $j$ for which the set is non-empty (which is always true for $j \\ge L(0)$). More generally, for maps between finite total orders, this is always well-defined.\n*   Given a monotone map $R: [37] \\to [23]$, if a left adjoint $L$ exists, it must be unique and defined by the formula:\n    $L(i) = \\min \\{j \\in [37] \\mid i \\le R(j)\\}$.\n\nIt can be shown that for maps between finite totally ordered sets (which are complete lattices), any order-preserving map $L$ has a right adjoint $R$ (because $L$ preserves all suprema), and any order-preserving map $R$ has a left adjoint $L$ (because $R$ preserves all infima).\n\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence between:\n*   Adjunctions $(L,R)$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n*   Order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n*   Order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n\nTherefore, to find the number of internal adjunctions, we can simply count the number of order-preserving maps from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n**Step 4: Counting the number of order-preserving maps**\n\nWe need to count the number of maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ that are order-preserving, with $m=23$ and $n=37$.\nAn order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is defined by the sequence of its values $f(0), f(1), \\ldots, f(m)$. The order-preserving property imposes the condition:\n$0 \\le f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\cdots \\le f(m) \\le n$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. We are choosing $m+1$ values from the set $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ (which has $n+1$ elements) with replacement, and the order is fixed by the non-decreasing condition. This is a \"multiset combination\" problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of size $N$ with replacement is given by the \"stars and bars\" formula: $\\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\nIn our case:\n*   We are choosing $k = m+1$ values (for $f(0), \\ldots, f(m)$).\n*   The values are chosen from a set of size $N = n+1$ (the set $\\{0, \\ldots, n\\}$).\n\nSo the number of such maps is $\\binom{(n+1) + (m+1) - 1}{m+1} = \\binom{n+m+1}{m+1}$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nWe substitute our specific values, $m=23$ and $n=37$, into the formula:\nNumber of adjunctions = Number of order-preserving maps from $[23]$ to $[37]$\n$$ = \\binom{37 + 23 + 1}{23 + 1} $$\n$$ = \\binom{61}{24} $$\n\nWe can verify this using the equivalent formula $\\binom{n+m+1}{n}$:\n$$ = \\binom{37+23+1}{37} = \\binom{61}{37} $$\nSince $\\binom{61}{24} = \\binom{61}{61-24} = \\binom{61}{37}$, the formulas are consistent.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ in $\\Delta$ is $\\binom{61}{24}$.\n\n<<<1613586186355811650>>>"
