    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain `F`.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are given a linear time-invariant (LTI) system defined by state matrix `A` and input matrix `B`.\n`A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\nWe need to design a state feedback controller `u = -Fx` such that the closed-loop system `dx/dt = (A+BF)x` has its eigenvalues at desired locations `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Define the State Feedback Gain Matrix F**\nThe state vector `x` is 2x1. Since matrix `B` is 2x2, the input vector `u` must be 2x1 for the product `Bu` to be valid. The feedback law is `u = -Fx`, so `F` must be a 2x2 matrix to make the dimensions consistent: `u(2x1) = -F(2x2) * x(2x1)`.\nLet `F = [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]]`.\n\n**3. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `λ_d1 = -1 + j` and `λ_d2 = -1 - j`.\nThe desired characteristic polynomial, `P_d(λ)`, is formed from these roots:\n`P_d(λ) = (λ - λ_d1)(λ - λ_d2)`\n`P_d(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`P_d(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n`P_d(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`P_d(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`P_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**4. Form the Closed-Loop System Matrix A_cl**\nThe closed-loop matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`.\nFirst, calculate `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]]`\n`BF = [[1*f11 + 2*f21, 1*f12 + 2*f22], [1*f11 + 0*f21, 1*f12 + 0*f22]]`\n`BF = [[f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22], [f11, f12]]`\n\nNow, add `A` to `BF`:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22], [f11, f12]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f11 + 2*f21, 1 + f12 + 2*f22], [1 + f11, f12]]`\n\n**5. Calculate the Characteristic Polynomial of A_cl**\nThe characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system, `P_cl(λ)`, is given by `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`.\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ - (-1 + f11 + 2*f21), -(1 + f12 + 2*f22)], [-(1 + f11), λ - f12]]`\n`det(λI - A_cl) = (λ - (-1 + f11 + 2*f21))(λ - f12) - (-(1 + f12 + 2*f22))(-(1 + f11))`\n`det(λI - A_cl) = (λ + 1 - f11 - 2*f21)(λ - f12) - (1 + f11)(1 + f12 + 2*f22)`\nExpanding this expression gives a polynomial in the form `λ^2 + c1*λ + c0`. Let's find the coefficients `c1` and `c0`.\nThe coefficient of `λ` is `c1 = -(Trace(A_cl))`:\n`Trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f11 + 2*f21) + f12 = -1 + f11 + f12 + 2*f21`\nSo, the coefficient of `λ` in the polynomial is `-Trace(A_cl) = 1 - f11 - f12 - 2*f21`.\nThe constant term is `c0 = det(A_cl)`:\n`det(A_cl) = (-1 + f11 + 2*f21)(f12) - (1 + f12 + 2*f22)(1 + f11)`\n`det(A_cl) = -f12 + f11*f12 + 2*f12*f21 - (1 + f11 + f12 + f11*f12 + 2*f22 + 2*f11*f22)`\n`det(A_cl) = -f12 + f11*f12 + 2*f12*f21 - 1 - f11 - f12 - f11*f12 - 2*f22 - 2*f11*f22`\n`det(A_cl) = -1 - f11 - 2*f12 - 2*f22 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f11*f22`\nSo, the characteristic polynomial is:\n`P_cl(λ) = λ^2 + (1 - f11 - f12 - 2*f21)λ + (-1 - f11 - 2*f12 - 2*f22 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f11*f22)`\n\n**6. Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\nWe match the coefficients of `P_cl(λ)` with `P_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n1.  `λ^1` coefficient: `1 - f11 - f12 - 2*f21 = 2`\n2.  `λ^0` coefficient: `-1 - f11 - 2*f12 - 2*f22 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f11*f22 = 2`\n\nWe have two equations with four unknowns (`f11, f12, f21, f22`). This is an underdetermined system, which is expected for a multi-input system. It means there are infinitely many solutions for `F`. We can find one solution by making a simplifying assumption.\n\nLet's assume we only use the first input, meaning the second row of `F` is zero.\nSet `f21 = 0` and `f22 = 0`.\nThe equations simplify to:\n1.  `1 - f11 - f12 - 2(0) = 2`  =>  `1 - f11 - f12 = 2`  =>  `f11 + f12 = -1`\n2.  `-1 - f11 - 2*f12 - 2(0) + 2*f12(0) - 2*f11(0) = 2`  =>  `-1 - f11 - 2*f12 = 2`  =>  `f11 + 2*f12 = -3`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n(a) `f11 + f12 = -1`\n(b) `f11 + 2*f12 = -3`\n\nSubtract equation (a) from equation (b):\n`(f11 + 2*f12) - (f11 + f12) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f12 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f12 = -2` back into equation (a):\n`f11 + (-2) = -1`\n`f11 = 1`\n\nSo, one possible state feedback gain matrix is `F = [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]] = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`.\n\n**7. Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\nLet's check our result. With `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation for this `A_cl` is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThis is exactly our desired characteristic polynomial, confirming the eigenvalues are `-1 ± j`.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
