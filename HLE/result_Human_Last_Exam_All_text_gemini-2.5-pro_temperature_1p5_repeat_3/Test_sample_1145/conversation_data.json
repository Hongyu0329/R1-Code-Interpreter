    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the System and the Goal:**\n    *   The system is a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) box of length `a`.\n    *   The particle is in the `n=2` energy state.\n    *   We need to find the probability of locating the particle in the small interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n\n2.  **Recall the Fundamental Formula:**\n    *   The probability `P` of finding a particle in an interval from `x₁` to `x₂` is given by the integral of the probability density function, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that interval.\n    *   `P = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] |ψₙ(x)|² dx`\n\n3.  **State the Wave Function and Probability Density:**\n    *   The normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box is:\n        `ψₙ(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n    *   For the `n=2` state, this becomes:\n        `ψ₂(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`\n    *   The probability density `|ψ₂(x)|²` is therefore:\n        `|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n\n4.  **Set Up the Specific Integral:**\n    *   Substituting the values into the probability formula:\n        `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Interval and the Function (Careful Point):**\n    *   The length of the interval is `Δx = x₂ - x₁ = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`. This is a very small interval.\n    *   The interval is centered at `x = 0.5a`.\n    *   Let's check the value of the probability density at the center of the interval (`x = 0.5a`):\n        `|ψ₂(0.5a)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2π(0.5a) / a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = (2/a) * (0)² = 0`\n    *   This is a crucial point. The center of our interval is a **node** for the `n=2` state. A simple approximation like `P ≈ |ψ₂(center)|² * Δx` would give an answer of `0`, which is incorrect. The probability is very small, but not exactly zero because the particle can be found on either side of the node.\n    *   Since the function is not constant but changing quadratically near the node, we must perform the integration carefully or use a better approximation.\n\n6.  **Approximation Method (Recommended for Small Intervals Near a Node):**\n    *   Because the interval is very small, we can approximate the `sin²` term. It's helpful to shift the origin to the center of the interval, `x_c = 0.5a`.\n    *   Let `u = x - 0.5a`. When `x = 0.495a`, `u = -0.005a`. When `x = 0.505a`, `u = 0.005a`. And `dx = du`.\n    *   The argument of the sine function becomes: `2πx/a = 2π(u + 0.5a)/a = 2πu/a + π`.\n    *   Using the identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, we get `sin(2πu/a + π) = -sin(2πu/a)`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(2πx/a) = sin²(π + 2πu/a) = [-sin(2πu/a)]² = sin²(2πu/a)`.\n    *   The integral becomes: `P = ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(2πu/a) du`.\n    *   Now, for small `u`, the argument `θ = 2πu/a` is also small. We can use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    *   `P ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * (2πu/a)² du`\n    *   `P ≈ (2/a) * (4π²/a²) ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] u² du = (8π²/a³) ∫ u² du`\n\n7.  **Evaluate the Simplified Integral:**\n    *   `∫ u² du = u³/3`\n    *   `P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [u³/3]` (evaluated from `-0.005a` to `0.005a`)\n    *   `P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [ ( (0.005a)³ / 3 ) - ( (-0.005a)³ / 3 ) ]`\n    *   `P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [ 2 * (0.005a)³ / 3 ]`\n    *   The `a³` terms cancel out.\n    *   `P ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³`\n\n8.  **Calculate the Final Numerical Value:**\n    *   `P ≈ (16 * π² / 3) * (5 x 10⁻³)³`\n    *   `P ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (125 x 10⁻⁹)`\n    *   `P ≈ (52.6379) * (125 x 10⁻⁹)`\n    *   `P ≈ 6579.7 * 10⁻⁹`\n    *   `P ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶`\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the specified interval is approximately `6.58 x 10⁻⁶`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
