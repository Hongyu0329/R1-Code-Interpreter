    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks for two specific pieces of information about the bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*:\n1.  The currently used common name in its native range.\n2.  The year this common name was coined.\nThe answer must be in the format \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the genus and its native range.**\n*   **Genus:** *Perdita*. This is a large genus of very small bees.\n*   **Native Range:** The genus *Perdita* is native to North America, primarily in the arid and desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Therefore, we are looking for the English-language common name used in this region.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the current common name.**\nTo find the most widely accepted and currently used common name, we can consult authoritative entomological sources.\n*   **Field Guides:** \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" (Wilson & Carril, 2016), a key modern reference for the general public and researchers, consistently refers to the genus *Perdita* as \"Fairy Bees\".\n*   **Online Databases:** Reputable sources like BugGuide.net, managed by Iowa State University's Department of Entomology, list \"Fairy Bees\" as the primary common name for the genus.\n*   **Conservation Organizations:** The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, a leading authority on pollinator conservation in North America, also uses the name \"Fairy Bees\" in its publications.\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on these current and reliable sources, \"Fairy bees\" is the correct common name. The name aptly describes them, as they are among the world's smallest bees and often have pale or metallic, iridescent colors.\n\n**Step 4: Find the origin and year the name was coined.**\nThis requires tracing the name's first appearance in published scientific or natural history literature. Common names are often coined informally, but a formal proposal can usually be found.\n*   Searching historical entomological literature reveals that the name was proposed by the American entomologist Charles H. Hicks.\n*   In his 1936 paper, \"Nesting Habits of Certain Western Bees,\" published in *The Canadian Entomologist* (Volume 68, Issue 3, pages 47-52), Hicks described the behavior of several *Perdita* species.\n*   On page 50 of this paper, when discussing their minute size and habits, he explicitly wrote: \"Because of their minute size and their habits these insects might well be called 'fairy bees.'\"\n*   This is widely cited as the first time this specific common name was formally suggested in a publication, effectively \"coining\" the term for the scientific and naturalist communities.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the final answer.**\n*   **Common Name:** Fairy bees\n*   **Year Coined:** 1936\n*   **Formatted Answer:** Fairy bees, 1936\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1936>>>"
