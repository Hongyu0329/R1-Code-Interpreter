    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Correct Paper\nThe question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. This is one of his four famous \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers. The full title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat).\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Theoretical Background\nEinstein's paper on Brownian motion was not written in a vacuum. It was a direct application of the principles of statistical mechanics, a field which explains the behavior of large systems (like gases or liquids) by considering the statistical behavior of their constituent molecules. The theoretical framework Einstein used was largely developed by one key physicist.\n\n### Step 3: Investigate the Citations and Influences\nThe question asks whose *lectures* Einstein cited. This could refer to a book with \"Lectures\" in the title or an actual lecture series.\n*   **Primary Influence:** Historians of science agree that Einstein's work in statistical mechanics was profoundly influenced by the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. Einstein studied Boltzmann's work on his own, as it was not a major part of his university curriculum at the time.\n*   **The Specific \"Lectures\":** The key work of Boltzmann's that Einstein studied was his book titled ***Vorlesungen über Gastheorie***, which translates to ***Lectures on Gas Theory***. This book was the main source for Einstein's understanding of statistical mechanics.\n\n### Step 4: Check for a Direct Citation in the 1905 Paper\nThis is a crucial point that requires care. If we examine the text of the 1905 paper on Brownian motion itself, it is famous for its lack of references. It contains only one explicit footnote citation, and it is to a paper by Henry Siedentopf concerning observations of gold particles, not to lectures.\n\n### Step 5: Widen the Context to Einstein's Related Work\nWhile the 1905 paper doesn't explicitly name Boltzmann, it is the culmination of a series of papers Einstein wrote on statistical mechanics from 1902-1904. In these earlier foundational papers, which built the very framework he used for his Brownian motion analysis, Einstein *does* explicitly cite Ludwig Boltzmann's ***Lectures on Gas Theory***. Because the 1905 paper is a direct consequence and application of this earlier work, the citation to Boltzmann's lectures is considered foundational to the Brownian motion paper as well. Therefore, in the context of the entire body of work that led to his theory of Brownian motion, Einstein did cite Boltzmann's lectures.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe most accurate answer, taking into account the full intellectual context, is that the lectures Einstein cited as the basis for his work on statistical mechanics and Brownian motion were those of Ludwig Boltzmann, published in his book *Lectures on Gas Theory*.\n\n***\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
