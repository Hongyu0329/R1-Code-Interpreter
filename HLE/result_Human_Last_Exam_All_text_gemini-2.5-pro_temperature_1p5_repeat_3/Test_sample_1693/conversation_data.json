    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** We need to identify a specific ship based on four key criteria:\n    *   **Nationality:** French.\n    *   **Size:** The largest by displacement. Note: Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a measure of volume, is often used as a proxy for the size of merchant ships, and it generally correlates with displacement (weight).\n    *   **Cause of Loss:** Sunk by a German U-boat.\n    *   **Timeframe:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the Franco-German Armistice signed on 22 June 1940. This period runs from 3 September 1939 to 22 June 1940.\n\n2.  **Initial Research and Candidate Identification:** We must search for French vessels (both naval and merchant) sunk by U-boats within the specified timeframe and then compare their sizes. Major French naval vessels like the battleship *Bretagne* were sunk after the armistice by the British at Mers-el-Kébir, so they are not eligible. We must focus on the sinkings between September 1939 and June 1940.\n\n3.  **Identify Major French Losses to U-boats in the Period:**\n    *   **MS *Sheherazade*:** A large motor tanker.\n        *   **Tonnage:** 13,467 GRT.\n        *   **Date Sunk:** 21 June 1940. This is just one day before the armistice was signed, so it falls within the required timeframe.\n        *   **Cause:** Torpedoed and sunk by the German U-boat **U-47**, commanded by the famous ace Günther Prien.\n    *   **SS *Champlain*:** A large passenger liner operated by the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique.\n        *   **Tonnage:** 28,124 GRT. Its displacement was significantly higher, over 35,000 tons.\n        *   **Date Sunk:** 17 June 1940. This is comfortably before the armistice.\n        *   **Cause:** Struck a magnetic mine off La Rochelle. The mine had been laid by the German U-boat **U-65**.\n\n4.  **Compare the Candidates and Address Nuances:**\n    *   **Size:** Comparing the two primary candidates, the SS *Champlain* at **28,124 GRT** is more than double the size of the MS *Sheherazade* at **13,467 GRT**. Therefore, by any measure of size (GRT or displacement), the *Champlain* was the larger vessel.\n    *   **Cause of Sinking (\"sunk by a U-boat\"):** This is a critical point. The *Sheherazade* was sunk directly by torpedoes from a U-boat. The *Champlain* was sunk by a mine that a U-boat had previously laid. In naval and historical records, sinkings caused by submarine-laid mines are credited to the submarine that laid them. Therefore, the sinking of the *Champlain* is officially attributed to U-65, qualifying it as \"sunk by a U-boat.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The SS *Champlain* was the largest French ship by displacement (and GRT).\n    *   Its sinking on 17 June 1940 falls before the armistice deadline.\n    *   Its loss, caused by a mine laid by U-65, is credited as a U-boat sinking.\n\nTherefore, the SS *Champlain* is the correct answer.\n\n***\n\n<<<SS Champlain"
