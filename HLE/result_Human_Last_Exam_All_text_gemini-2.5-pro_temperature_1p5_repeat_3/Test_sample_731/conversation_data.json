    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    The question specifies a size of 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, we are dealing with the group $SD_{512}$, which corresponds to $n=9$.\n    The presentation for $SD_{512}$ is:\n    $SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of this group are of two forms:\n    1.  $\\{r^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 256\\}$, which form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order 256.\n    2.  $\\{sr^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 256\\}$, the 256 elements outside of $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a \"power subgroup\" if it can be generated by a single element of $G$. That is, $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ for some $g \\in G$. This is the definition of a cyclic subgroup.\n\nThe problem is to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $SD_{512}$.\n\n**Step 2: Enumerate Cyclic Subgroups by Type of Generator**\n\nWe can find all cyclic subgroups by considering the subgroups generated by each element of $SD_{512}$. We partition the elements into two sets as described above.\n\n**Part A: Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $r^k$**\n\nThese are the subgroups that lie entirely within the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$. The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 256, $C_{256}$.\n\n*   **Key Point:** For a finite cyclic group of order $m$, there is exactly one subgroup for each positive divisor of $m$. The total number of subgroups is the number of divisors of $m$, denoted $\\tau(m)$.\n*   Here, $m = 256 = 2^8$. The divisors of $2^8$ are $2^0, 2^1, \\dots, 2^8$.\n*   The number of divisors is $\\tau(2^8) = 8 + 1 = 9$.\n*   Therefore, there are **9** distinct cyclic subgroups contained in $\\langle r \\rangle$. These are $\\langle r \\rangle, \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n\n**Part B: Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $sr^k$**\n\nThese are the cyclic subgroups that are not contained in $\\langle r \\rangle$. To count them, we first need to determine the orders of the elements $sr^k$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must calculate the square of the element $g = sr^k$. We use the relation $sr = r^{127}s$, which implies $sr^k = r^{127k}s$.\n    $g^2 = (sr^k)^2 = (sr^k)(sr^k) = (r^{127k}s)s r^k = r^{127k} (s^2) r^k = r^{127k} \\cdot 1 \\cdot r^k = r^{128k}$.\n*   The order of $sr^k$ now depends on the order of $r^{128k}$. The order of $r$ is 256.\n\n*   **Case 1: $k$ is even.**\n    Let $k=2m$. Then $(sr^{2m})^2 = r^{128(2m)} = r^{256m} = (r^{256})^m = 1^m = 1$.\n    So, if $k$ is even, the element $sr^k$ has order 2.\n    There are $256/2 = 128$ even values for $k$ in the range $0 \\le k < 256$.\n    Each of these 128 elements generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2: $\\langle sr^k \\rangle = \\{1, sr^k\\}$. Since $sr^{k_1} = sr^{k_2}$ implies $k_1 = k_2$, these 128 subgroups are all unique.\n    This gives **128** cyclic subgroups of order 2.\n\n*   **Case 2: $k$ is odd.**\n    Let $k=2m+1$. Then $(sr^k)^2 = r^{128k} = r^{128(2m+1)} = r^{256m + 128} = r^{128}$.\n    The element $r^{128}$ has order 2 (since $(r^{128})^2 = r^{256} = 1$).\n    So, $(sr^k)^4 = ((sr^k)^2)^2 = (r^{128})^2 = 1$.\n    Since $(sr^k)^2 \\ne 1$, the order of $sr^k$ for odd $k$ is 4.\n    There are $256/2 = 128$ odd values for $k$ in the range $0 \\le k < 256$. Each generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must check for duplicates among these subgroups.\n    The subgroup generated by $sr^k$ (for odd $k$) is $H_k = \\{1, sr^k, (sr^k)^2, (sr^k)^3\\} = \\{1, sr^k, r^{128}, sr^k r^{128}\\}$.\n    We need to simplify $(sr^k)^3 = sr^k r^{128}$. Using $r^j s = s r^{127j}$, we get $r^{128} = s r^{127 \\cdot 128} s = s r^{-128} s = s r^{128} s$. So $r^{128}$ commutes with $s$.\n    $(sr^k)^3 = s r^k r^{128} = s r^{k+128}$.\n    So, $H_k = \\{1, sr^k, r^{128}, sr^{k+128}\\}$.\n    Another generator for this group is $(sr^k)^3 = sr^{k+128}$.\n    This means that $\\langle sr^k \\rangle = \\langle sr^{k+128} \\rangle$.\n    The 128 elements of order 4 are paired up, with each pair generating the same subgroup. For example, $\\langle sr^1 \\rangle = \\langle sr^{129} \\rangle$.\n    The number of distinct cyclic subgroups of this type is the number of pairs, which is $128 / 2 = 64$.\n    This gives **64** cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Results**\n\nNow we sum the number of distinct cyclic subgroups from each part. We must ensure there is no overlap.\n*   The 9 subgroups from Part A are all contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n*   The $128+64=192$ subgroups from Part B are not contained in $\\langle r \\rangle$, because their generator $sr^k$ is not in $\\langle r \\rangle$. The only subgroup they could share is the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$, but none of the generators $sr^k$ have order 1. Therefore, the sets of subgroups are disjoint (except for the trivial group, which is counted once in Part A).\n\nTotal number of cyclic subgroups = (subgroups from Part A) + (subgroups from Part B, Case 1) + (subgroups from Part B, Case 2)\nTotal = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\nThe semidihedral group of size 512 has 201 power subgroups.\n\n<<<201>>>"
