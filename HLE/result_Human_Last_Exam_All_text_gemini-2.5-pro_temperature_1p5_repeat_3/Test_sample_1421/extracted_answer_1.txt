The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is $Z = \int \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi \, e^{-S[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$, where the integral is a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields $\psi(\tau)$ and $\bar{\psi}(\tau)$. The Euclidean action is given by $S[\bar{\psi}, \psi] = \int_{0}^{\beta} d\tau \left[ \sum_k \bar{\psi}_k(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi_k(\tau) + H(\{\bar{\psi}_k\}, \{\psi_k\}) \right]$. The integration is performed over all fields satisfying anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time, $\psi_k(\beta) = -\psi_k(0)$.
