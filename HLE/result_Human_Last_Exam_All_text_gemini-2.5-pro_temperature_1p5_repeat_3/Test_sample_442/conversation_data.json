    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poetic device in the Virgilian line.\n\n**The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, *Eclogue* 8.17)\n\n**Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, lead on, Lucifer, the nurturing day.\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints**\n\nThe goal is to identify one Latin poetic device in the given line. The question explicitly excludes the following devices:\n*   Apostrophe / Personification\n*   Any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Excluded Devices to Confirm Their Presence**\n\nIt's useful to first identify the excluded devices to ensure they are present and to understand why they are being set aside.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses the morning star (\"Lucifer\") and commands it to perform human-like actions (\"Nascere\" - be born; \"age\" - lead on). This is a clear example of both apostrophe (addressing an inanimate object) and personification (giving it human qualities/agency). This is present and correctly excluded.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is assonance with the repeated 'e' sound in \"pr<u>ae</u>qu<u>e</u> di<u>e</u>m v<u>e</u>ni<u>e</u>ns ag<u>e</u>\" and the 'a' sound in \"<u>a</u>ge, Lucifer, <u>a</u>lmum.\" There is also alliteration/consonance with the 'l' in \"**L**ucifer, a**l**mum.\" These sound effects are present and correctly excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional separation of words that grammatically belong together. In the phrase \"diem...almum\" (\"the nurturing day\"), the noun `diem` is separated from its modifying adjective `almum` by the verb `age` and the vocative `Lucifer`. This is a classic example of hyperbaton. It is present and correctly excluded.\n\n**Step 3: Search for Other Poetic Devices**\n\nWith the major devices accounted for and excluded, we must look for more subtle figures of speech. Let's examine the word choices and structure.\n\n*   Consider the verb **`nascere`**. This is the imperative form of the verb *nascor*, which means \"to be born.\" It is being used here to describe the rising or appearance of the morning star in the sky.\n*   A celestial body like a star does not undergo a biological birth. The poet is describing one event (the astronomical rising of a star) in terms of another, unrelated event (the birth of a living creature).\n*   This use of a word or phrase to refer to something to which it is not literally applicable, implying a resemblance or analogy, is the definition of a **metaphor**. The appearance of the star at dawn is being compared metaphorically to a birth. This is a distinct device from the personification of Lucifer; the metaphor lies in the specific verb choice used to describe the action of the personified star.\n\n**Step 4: Consider and Discard Other Potential Devices**\n\n*   **Transferred Epithet (Enallage):** One could argue that `almum` (\"nurturing\") is an adjective better suited to the effects of the day (the life-giving sun) or the bringer of the day (Lucifer) than to the day itself. However, `almus` is a very common poetic epithet for beneficial natural phenomena like the day or light, so this may be a conventional pairing rather than a specific rhetorical device.\n*   **Poetic Grammar:** The use of the preposition `prae` with the accusative case (`diem`) instead of the standard ablative is a feature of poetic grammar (an archaism or Grecism). While a feature of poetic language, this is typically categorized as a grammatical license rather than a rhetorical figure of speech like metaphor or simile.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nAfter excluding apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and hyperbaton, the most prominent and undeniable poetic device remaining in the line is **metaphor**. The use of `nascere` (\"to be born\") to describe the rising of the morning star is a clear metaphorical substitution that creates a vivid and poignant image.\n\n<<<Metaphor>>>"
