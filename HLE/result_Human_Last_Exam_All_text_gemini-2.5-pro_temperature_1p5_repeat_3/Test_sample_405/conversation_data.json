    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Allotropes:** These are different structural modifications of an element. The atoms of the element are bonded together in different ways, leading to distinct physical and chemical properties, including color.\n    *   **Pure Allotropes:** We must consider the color of the allotrope in its pure form, without impurities or degradation products that might alter its appearance.\n\n2.  **Identify the Allotropes of Phosphorus and Their Colors:**\n    We will list the recognized allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors.\n\n    *   **White Phosphorus (P₄):**\n        *   **Structure:** A molecular solid consisting of tetrahedral P₄ molecules.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This allotrope is highly reactive. When pure, it is a colorless or white waxy solid. It is often called \"yellow phosphorus\" commercially because it tends to develop a yellow hue upon exposure to light, which causes a partial transformation to the more stable red phosphorus. Since the question specifies *pure* allotropes, we consider its intrinsic color.\n        *   **Color:** **White** (or colorless).\n\n    *   **Red Phosphorus (Pₙ):**\n        *   **Structure:** An amorphous (non-crystalline) polymeric solid.\n        *   **Careful Point:** \"Scarlet phosphorus\" is sometimes mentioned, but it is generally considered a finely divided and more reactive form of amorphous red phosphorus, not a structurally distinct allotrope. Its color falls within the spectrum of red.\n        *   **Color:** **Red**.\n\n    *   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus):**\n        *   **Structure:** A crystalline (monoclinic) polymeric form of phosphorus.\n        *   **Careful Point:** Due to its well-defined crystalline structure, it is considered a distinct allotrope from the amorphous red phosphorus.\n        *   **Color:** **Violet**.\n\n    *   **Black Phosphorus:**\n        *   **Structure:** The most thermodynamically stable allotrope. It has a layered, puckered crystalline structure (orthorhombic).\n        *   **Careful Point:** It is a semiconductor and has a flaky, graphite-like appearance with a metallic luster.\n        *   **Color:** **Black**.\n\n    *   **Blue Phosphorus:**\n        *   **Structure:** A 2D allotrope (also known as phosphorene), analogous to graphene. It is typically synthesized on a substrate.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This is a more recently discovered allotrope, and its existence and properties are well-documented in scientific literature.\n        *   **Color:** **Blue**.\n\n3.  **Compile and Count the Distinct Colors:**\n    By listing the colors of the identified pure allotropes, we can find the total number of observable colors.\n\n    1.  White (from White Phosphorus)\n    2.  Red (from Red Phosphorus)\n    3.  Violet (from Violet Phosphorus)\n    4.  Black (from Black Phosphorus)\n    5.  Blue (from Blue Phosphorus)\n\n    Counting these unique colors, we find there are 5 distinct colors corresponding to the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there are five well-established allotropes of phosphorus, each possessing a distinct color in its pure form.\n\n<<<5>>>"
