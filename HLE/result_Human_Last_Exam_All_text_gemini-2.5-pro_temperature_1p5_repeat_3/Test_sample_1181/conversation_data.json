    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying detail is that this character feels \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This points to a specific piece of dialogue or a moment of expressed introspection.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters Provided in the Answer Choices**\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist, a psychologist. The film begins and ends with him at his family home on Earth, where the sounds of nature, including rustling leaves, are very prominent. His primary emotional struggle on the station revolves around his resurrected wife, Hari, and his feelings of guilt and love.\n*   **B. Hari:** Kris's wife who committed suicide but is recreated by the Solaris ocean. She is a \"visitor\" with no independent memory of Earth; her knowledge and identity are derived from Kris's mind. Therefore, she couldn't miss something she has never truly experienced herself.\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** One of the two scientists Kris finds alive on the station. He is a cyberneticist who has become cynical and philosophical after his time on the station. He frequently reflects on humanity's purpose and its place in the cosmos.\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** The other surviving scientist, a biologist. He is depicted as cold, clinical, and almost obsessively dedicated to scientific inquiry. He treats the \"visitors\" as phenomena to be studied and shows little patience for emotional or philosophical concerns.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Kris's friend and colleague who commits suicide right before Kris arrives. We see him only in a video recording where he warns Kris about the strange occurrences on the station.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nThe line in question is spoken during a scene where the characters are gathered, often referred to as Snaut's \"un-birthday\" party. In this scene, the characters drink and discuss their reasons for being in space. Dr. Snaut delivers a thoughtful, weary monologue about the human condition and the futility of their mission. He argues that man doesn't truly seek other worlds but seeks a mirror. It is during this reflection that he expresses his homesickness.\n\n**Step 4: Attribute the Dialogue to the Correct Character**\nIn his monologue, it is **Dr. Snaut** who confesses his longing for simple, terrestrial things. He expresses shame that, as a scientist on a monumental mission, he finds himself missing something as simple as the sound of rustling leaves. This sentiment perfectly aligns with his character—a man who has lost faith in the grand scientific purpose and is left with only a profound sense of human alienation and nostalgia. Sartorius is too scientifically detached for such a confession, and Kris's nostalgia is tied directly to his personal trauma concerning Hari, not a general homesickness expressed in this way.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Film vs. Novel:** The question is specifically about Tarkovsky's 1972 film. Tarkovsky heavily altered the source material, Stanisław Lem's novel, to focus more on human emotions, memory, and the \"earthly\" versus the \"cosmic.\" This dialogue is a key part of Tarkovsky's specific thematic focus.\n2.  **Character's State of Mind:** Snaut is not just homesick; he is \"ashamed\" of it. This reveals the internal conflict between his duty as a scientist exploring the unknown and his fundamental human need for the familiar. He sees this nostalgia as a weakness or a failing.\n3.  **Role of the Character:** Snaut serves as the film's primary philosophical voice, questioning the very nature of their mission. This quote is a cornerstone of his philosophical stance, highlighting the idea that humanity may not be suited for the cold, vast, and alien universe.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of the characters and the specific dialogue from the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
