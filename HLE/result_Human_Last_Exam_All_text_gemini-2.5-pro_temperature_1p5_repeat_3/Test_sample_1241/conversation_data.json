    "This problem asks for the long-term behavior of a system described by the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, which is a system of linear ordinary differential equations modeling a continuous-time Markov chain. The value $P_{i}(+\\infty)$ represents the stationary probability of the system being in state $i$. Let's denote these stationary probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nTo find the stationary probabilities, we need to solve the system of equations when the probabilities are no longer changing, which means their time derivatives are zero. So we set $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i=0, 1, 2, 3$.\n\n### Step 1: Formulate the steady-state equations\nSetting the derivatives to zero in the given system of differential equations, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for the stationary probabilities $\\pi_i$:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\nIn addition, the sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1:\n5.  $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n**Careful point:** The first four equations are linearly dependent (summing them gives $0=0$). We must use the normalization equation (5) to find a unique solution.\n\n### Step 2: Substitute the given parameter values\nThe given values for the transition rates are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n$\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n$\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n$\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n$\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n$\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equations from Step 1:\n1.  $0 = -0.019\\pi_0 + 0.65\\pi_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019\\pi_0 - (0.65 + 0.4)\\pi_1 + 0.392\\pi_2 + 0.008\\pi_3 \\implies 0 = 0.019\\pi_0 - 1.05\\pi_1 + 0.392\\pi_2 + 0.008\\pi_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4\\pi_1 - (0.392 + 0.008)\\pi_2 \\implies 0 = 0.4\\pi_1 - 0.4\\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008\\pi_2 - 0.008\\pi_3$\n5.  $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n### Step 3: Solve the system of algebraic equations\nWe can express $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_2$, and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4\\pi_1 = 0.4\\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_1$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008\\pi_2 = 0.008\\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_3 = \\pi_2$. Since $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$, we have $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019\\pi_0 = 0.65\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$\n\n**Careful point:** At this stage, it's a good practice to check for consistency with equation (2), which we haven't used yet. Substituting $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$ and $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$ into eq (2) should give us a result consistent with eq (1). Eq (2) becomes $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_1$. Rearranging, $\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 = (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12} - \\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{31})\\pi_1$. For consistency with eq (1) which states $\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 = \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$, we need $\\lambda_{12} - \\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{31} = 0$. Using the given values: $0.4 - 0.392 - 0.008 = 0.4 - 0.4 = 0$. The equations are consistent.\n\n### Step 4: Use the normalization condition\nNow we substitute the expressions for $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$ into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1) + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19}\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the required probabilities\nWe can now find the values of $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_1 = P_1(+\\infty) = \\frac{19}{707}$\n$\\pi_0 = P_0(+\\infty) = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\n### Step 6: Find the final answer\nThe question asks for the sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$.\n$P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650+19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nTo get a numerical value, we perform the division:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768033946...$\n\nRounding the result to seven decimal places gives 0.9462518."
