    "To determine the number of essential controls for a flow cytometry sorting experiment, we must consider controls for instrument setup, gating, and experimental validation.\n\n**Question Analysis:**\n*   **Experiment Type:** Flow Cytometry Sorting\n*   **Staining Target:** Streptavidin (SA) beads, implying capture of a biotinylated molecule.\n*   **Number of Colors:** 5\n*   **Detection Channels/Fluorochromes:** AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Essential Controls:**\n\n**1. Controls for Instrument Setup (Compensation & Voltages)**\nThese controls are necessary to set the detector voltages (gains) and to create a compensation matrix that corrects for spectral overlap between the fluorochromes.\n*   **Unstained Control (1):** A sample of only the streptavidin beads. This is used to define the baseline autofluorescence of the beads and to set the initial forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) parameters to identify the bead population.\n*   **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5):** For a five-color experiment, you need one control for each fluorochrome. Each control consists of beads stained with only one fluorescent label. These are used by the software to calculate the spillover values for the compensation matrix.\n    *   Beads + AF350 only\n    *   Beads + GFP only\n    *   Beads + PE only\n    *   Beads + AF647 only\n    *   Beads + AF750 only\n*   **Total for Instrument Setup:** 1 (unstained) + 5 (single-stains) = **6 controls**.\n\n**2. Controls for Accurate Gating (FMO Controls)**\nFor sorting, precise identification of positive versus negative populations is critical. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls are the gold standard for setting accurate gates in multi-color experiments. An FMO control contains all the fluorochromes in the panel *except for one*. This reveals the spread of fluorescence from all other colors into the \"empty\" channel, allowing for a precise gate to be drawn. For a rigorous sorting experiment, an FMO for each fluorochrome is considered essential.\n*   **FMO for AF350 (1):** Beads stained with GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 (everything *except* AF350).\n*   **FMO for GFP (1):** Beads stained with AF350, PE, AF647, and AF750 (everything *except* GFP).\n*   **FMO for PE (1):** Beads stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750 (everything *except* PE).\n*   **FMO for AF647 (1):** Beads stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF750 (everything *except* AF647).\n*   **FMO for AF750 (1):** Beads stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF647 (everything *except* AF750).\n*   **Total for Gating:** **5 controls**.\n\n**3. Experimental/Assay-Specific Control**\nThis control validates the specificity of the staining protocol. Since the experiment uses streptavidin beads, it's likely designed to capture a biotinylated target (e.g., a biotinylated antibody or protein), which is then detected by the five fluorescent probes. A critical control is to check for non-specific binding of these fluorescent probes directly to the streptavidin beads.\n*   **Negative Assay Control (1):** Streptavidin beads + the full cocktail of all five fluorescent probes, but **without the biotinylated target molecule**. This ensures that the signal in the final experiment is dependent on the presence of the specific target being captured.\n*   **Total for Experimental Validation:** **1 control**.\n\n**Final Summary and Count:**\n\n*   **Instrument Setup Controls:** 6 (1 unstained + 5 single-stains)\n*   **Gating Controls:** 5 (5 FMO controls)\n*   **Experimental Controls:** 1 (Negative Assay Control)\n\nTotal number of essential controls = 6 + 5 + 1 = 12.\n\nThis list does not include the fully stained experimental sample, which is the sample you will analyze and sort from, as it is not technically a \"control\".\n\n<<<12>>>"
