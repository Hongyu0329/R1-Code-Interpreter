    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the reaction type.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** The problem specifies a Wittig reaction. This reaction is a cornerstone of organic synthesis used to create carbon-carbon double bonds (alkenes). It involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound (an aldehyde or ketone) with a phosphorus ylide (a Wittig reagent).\n*   **Reactant 1 (Carbonyl Compound): Pivalaldehyde.**\n    *   The \"pival-\" prefix refers to the tert-butyl group, (CH₃)₃C-.\n    *   The \"-aldehyde\" suffix indicates a -CHO functional group.\n    *   Therefore, the structure of pivalaldehyde is (CH₃)₃C-CHO. Its systematic name is 2,2-dimethylpropanal.\n*   **Reactant 2 (Wittig Reagent/Ylide): (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane.**\n    *   \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" indicates a triphenylphosphine group, P(C₆H₅)₃ or PPh₃. The λ⁵ notation specifies the +5 oxidation state/coordination of phosphorus, which is characteristic of an ylide (formally Ph₃P⁺-C⁻↔ Ph₃P=C).\n    *   \"ethylidene\" refers to a two-carbon fragment attached via a double bond to the phosphorus, `P=CH-CH₃`.\n    *   \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" is a substituent on the ethylidene group. Position 1 is the carbon attached to the phosphorus, and position 2 is the terminal methyl carbon.\n    *   Putting it all together, the substituent `2-chlorophenyl` is on carbon 2 of the ethylidene group. The structure of the ylide is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where the chloro group is at the ortho (position 2) of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the mechanism and classify the ylide.**\n*   The core transformation of a Wittig reaction is the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen (C=O) with the carbon group from the ylide (C=PPh₃). The final products are an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n    `R¹R²C=O + Ph₃P=CR³R⁴ → R¹R²C=CR³R⁴ + Ph₃P=O`\n*   **Classification of the ylide:** Wittig ylides are classified based on the stability of the carbanionic form (Ph₃P⁺-C⁻R³R⁴).\n    *   **Unstabilized Ylides:** The ylide carbon is attached to alkyl groups or hydrogen.\n    *   **Stabilized Ylides:** The ylide carbon is attached to an electron-withdrawing group (e.g., -C=O, -CN, -NO₂) that can delocalize the negative charge.\n    *   In our case, the ylide is `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-Cl-C₆H₄)`. The carbon attached to phosphorus (`=CH-`) is bonded to a hydrogen and a 2-chlorobenzyl group (`-CH₂-(o-Cl-C₆H₄)`). Since the 2-chlorobenzyl group is an alkyl-type group (the phenyl ring is not directly attached to the ylide carbon), this is considered an **unstabilized ylide**.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the stereochemistry of the product.**\n*   The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the type of ylide.\n*   **Unstabilized ylides** (like the one in this problem) generally react with aldehydes to form the **Z-alkene** (or cis-alkene) as the major product. This is because the reaction proceeds under kinetic control through a puckered oxaphosphetane intermediate, where steric interactions between the aldehyde's R-group and the ylide's R-group are minimized when they are cis to each other.\n*   The large tert-butyl group of pivalaldehyde will strongly favor the formation of the Z-isomer to minimize steric clash in the transition state.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the final product.**\n*   Take the carbon framework of pivalaldehyde: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=`\n*   Take the carbon framework of the ylide: `=CH-CH₂-(o-Cl-C₆H₄)`\n*   Combine these two fragments at the double bond: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-Cl-C₆H₄)`\n*   The major product will be the Z-isomer, where the two larger groups on each side of the double bond (the tert-butyl group and the 2-chlorobenzyl group) are on the same side.\n\n**Step 5: Name the final product.**\n*   **Parent chain:** The longest carbon chain including the double bond is a 5-carbon chain (pentene).\n*   **Numbering:** Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible locant. Numbering from the right gives the double bond at position 2. `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** As determined in Step 3, the major isomer is (Z). We can confirm this with Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:\n    *   On C2: The priority group is the 2-chlorobenzyl group over the hydrogen.\n    *   On C3: The priority group is the tert-butyl group over the hydrogen.\n    *   Since the two high-priority groups are on the same side of the double bond, the configuration is indeed (Z).\n*   **Final Product Name:** (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n**Summary of Product Formation:**\nPivalaldehyde `[(CH₃)₃C-CHO]` reacts with the unstabilized ylide `[Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-Cl-C₆H₄)]` to predominantly form the Z-alkene, `(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`, along with the byproduct triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene"
