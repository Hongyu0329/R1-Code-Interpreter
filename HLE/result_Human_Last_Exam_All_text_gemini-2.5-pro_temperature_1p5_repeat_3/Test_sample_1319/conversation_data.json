    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the primary mountain and its details.**\nThe question specifies that Mount Olympus is the tallest.\n*   **Mountain:** Mount Olympus\n*   **Location:** Thessaly/Macedonia border, Greece\n*   **Significance in the *Iliad*:** The home of the gods.\n*   **Elevation:** 2,918 meters (9,573 ft)\n\n**Step 2: List all other historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*.**\nWe need to carefully scan the text, particularly divine journeys and geographical descriptions like the Catalogue of Ships, to find other named mountains.\n\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain is very prominent. Zeus sits on its peak, Gargarus, to watch the Trojan War. Hera also visits him there.\n    *   **Careful Point:** There are two famous Mount Idas in antiquity: one on Crete (associated with Zeus's birth) and one near Troy in Anatolia. The *Iliad* is set at Troy, and the context of Zeus watching the battle makes it certain that this is the Trojan Ida.\n    *   **Modern Name:** Kaz Dağı, Turkey\n    *   **Elevation:** 1,774 meters (5,820 ft)\n\n*   **Samothrace (Mount Fengari/Saos):** In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits atop the highest peak of \"wooded Samothrace\" to get a clear view of the battlefield at Troy and the Achaean camp.\n    *   **Modern Name:** Mount Fengari (or Saos) on the island of Samothrace, Greece.\n    *   **Elevation:** 1,611 meters (5,285 ft)\n\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, during her journey from Olympus to Mount Ida, the goddess Hera flies over several locations, including \"snowy Athos.\"\n    *   **Modern Name:** Mount Athos, Greece\n    *   **Elevation:** 2,033 meters (6,670 ft)\n\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain is mentioned as the source of the ash spear given to Achilles' father, Peleus, by the centaur Chiron. Achilles uses this spear in battle.\n    *   **Modern Name:** Mount Pelion, Thessaly, Greece\n    *   **Elevation:** 1,624 meters (5,328 ft)\n\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** This mountain is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2), describing the homeland of the Maeonian (later Lydian) forces who fought for Troy. The passage says they live \"under the snows of Tmolus.\"\n    *   **Modern Name:** Bozdağ (part of the Tmolus mountain range), Turkey\n    *   **Elevation:** 2,157 meters (7,077 ft)\n\n**Step 3: Compare the elevations of the identified mountains.**\nNow, we rank the mountains we found based on their modern elevation data.\n\n1.  **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 m\n2.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,157 m\n3.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n4.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n5.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n6.  **Samothrace (Mount Fengari):** 1,611 m\n\n**Step 4: Determine the final answer.**\nAccording to the ranking, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
