    "Answering this question requires analyzing the homotopy properties of the spaces involved and identifying the specific map mentioned to determine its connectivity.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the domain and codomain spaces\n\nLet the map be denoted by $f: A \\to B$, where:\n*   The domain is $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n*   The codomain is $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nWe first determine the connectivity of these spaces. The connectivity of a space $X$ is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ are trivial for $i \\le k$.\n\n**Connectivity of the Codomain B:**\n*   The smash product of spheres is another sphere: $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$.\n*   Therefore, the codomain is $B \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   The homotopy groups of a loop space are given by $\\pi_k(\\Omega X) = \\pi_{k+1}(X)$.\n*   So, $\\pi_k(B) = \\pi_{k+1}(S^{10})$.\n*   The homotopy groups of the 10-sphere $\\pi_i(S^{10})$ are trivial for $i < 10$.\n*   Thus, $\\pi_k(B) = 0$ for $k+1 < 10$, which means $k < 9$.\n*   The codomain $B = \\Omega S^{10}$ is **8-connected**. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Connectivity of the Domain A:**\n*   The space $A$ is the suspension of $W = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$. The connectivity of $A$ is one greater than the connectivity of $W$.\n*   To find the connectivity of the smash product $W$, we first find the connectivity of its factors.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is the loop space of $S^4$. Its connectivity is $4-2=2$.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is the loop space of $S^6$. Its connectivity is $6-2=4$.\n*   For a smash product of a $p$-connected space and a $q$-connected space, the resulting space is $(p+q+1)$-connected.\n*   Here, $p=2$ and $q=4$. So, $W = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n*   The domain $A = \\Sigma W$ is a suspension, so its connectivity is $7+1 = 8$.\n*   The domain $A$ is **8-connected**. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_8(W)$. By the Hurewicz theorem, this group is related to the first non-trivial homology group. $H_8(W;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_3(\\Omega S^4;\\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6;\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$. So, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the initial range of connectivity for the map\n\nThe connectivity of a map $f: A \\to B$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$.\n\n*   Both the domain $A$ and the codomain $B$ are 8-connected.\n*   This means that for all $i \\le 8$, $\\pi_i(A) = 0$ and $\\pi_i(B) = 0$.\n*   The map $f_*: 0 \\to 0$ is trivially an isomorphism for $i \\le 8$.\n*   This implies that the connectivity of the map $f$ is at least 9.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the map at the first non-trivial dimension\n\nThe connectivity is determined by the behavior of $f_*$ on the first non-trivial homotopy groups, which occur at $i=9$.\n*   $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\pi_9(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   The map is $f_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$, which is a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nIf $f_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$, the connectivity is at least 10. If $f_*$ is an epimorphism but not an isomorphism (e.g., the zero map or multiplication by $n$ with $|n|>1$), the connectivity is exactly 9. If $f_*$ is not an epimorphism, the connectivity is 8.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the map and use known results\n\nThe phrasing \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" suggests a canonical construction. In the context of loop spaces, suspension, and smash products, this points to a specific map related to Samelson and Whitehead products. This well-known map is often denoted:\n$j_{X,Y}: \\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$\n\nThis map is the adjoint of the \"intrinsic Samelson product\" $\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y \\to \\Omega^2(X \\wedge Y)$. The properties of this map are a classical topic in algebraic topology. A key result, for instance by D. Anick (in \"The Gray-Whitehead Product and the Bass-Quillen Question\"), states that for spheres $X=S^m$ and $Y=S^n$, the connectivity of the map $j_{S^m, S^n}$ is exactly $m+n$.\n\n### Step 5: Final calculation\n\nWe apply this established result to the given problem:\n*   $m=4$\n*   $n=6$\n*   The connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is $m+n = 4+6 = 10$.\n\nThis means that $f_*:\\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$ is an isomorphism for $i<10$ and an epimorphism for $i=10$. This is consistent with our finding that $\\pi_9(A)$ and $\\pi_9(B)$ are both isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, and implies that the map between them is an isomorphism (multiplication by $\\pm 1$)."
