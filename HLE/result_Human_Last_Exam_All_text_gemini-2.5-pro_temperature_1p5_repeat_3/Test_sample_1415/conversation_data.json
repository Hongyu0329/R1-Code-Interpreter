    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the function F₃(x)**\n\nFirst, we need to find the explicit form of F₃(x) by substituting the functions into each other.\n1.  F₀(x) = x\n2.  F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n3.  F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n4.  F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integrand**\n\nThe integral we need to evaluate is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`.\nThis is a standard integral form. Let `u = F₃(x)`. Then `du = F₃'(x) dx`.\nThe integral transforms into `∫ (1/u) du`, whose antiderivative is `ln|u|`.\nSubstituting back `u = F₃(x)`, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the definite integral**\n\nWe need to evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\n= ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\nUsing the property of logarithms `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, this simplifies to:\nV = ln(|F₃(1) / F₃(0)|)\n\n**Step 4: Calculate F₃(0)**\n\nWe substitute x = 0 into the expression for F₃(x):\nF₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))\nSince sin(0) = 0 and e⁰ = 1:\nF₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(1)**\n\nWe substitute x = 1 into the expression for F₃(x):\nF₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\nHere, the argument of sin is 1 radian.\n\n**Step 6: Check the signs of F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n\n*   F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693, which is positive.\n*   For F₃(1): 1 radian is approximately 57.3 degrees. Since 0 < 1 < π, sin(1) > 0. Therefore, e^(sin(1)) > e⁰ = 1. This means 1 + e^(sin(1)) > 2, and `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) > ln(2) > 0`. So, F₃(1) is also positive.\nSince both F₃(1) and F₃(0) are positive, we can remove the absolute value signs.\nV = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final value V**\n\nSubstitute the expressions for F₃(1) and F₃(0) into the equation for V:\nV = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n1.  sin(1) ≈ 0.84147\n2.  e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147 ≈ 2.31978\n3.  F₃(1) = ln(1 + 2.31978) = ln(3.31978) ≈ 1.20000\n4.  F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69315\n5.  F₃(1) / F₃(0) ≈ 1.20000 / 0.69315 ≈ 1.73125\n6.  V = ln(1.73125) ≈ 0.54886\n\n**Step 8: Calculate 10000*V and find the closest integer**\n\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54886 = 5488.6\nThe closest integer to 5488.6 is 5489.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
