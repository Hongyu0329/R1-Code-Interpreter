    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat in Vietnam.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the period of Ming Dynasty rule over Vietnam (1407-1427), known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination. The key conflict during this time was the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418-1427), led by Lê Lợi against the Ming occupation. Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟) was one of the primary commanders tasked with suppressing this rebellion.\n\n2.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Campaigns and \"First Major Defeat\":**\n    *   The initial Ming invasion (1406-1407) against the Hồ Dynasty was successful, so Mu Sheng's defeat would not have occurred then.\n    *   We must look at the campaigns during the Lam Sơn Uprising. In the early years (1418-1423), the Lam Sơn army fought a guerrilla war primarily in their home base of what is now Thanh Hóa Province. They had some victories, but also suffered severe setbacks and were often on the run. These skirmishes were not typically a \"major defeat\" for a top general like Mu Sheng.\n    *   The turning point came in 1424-1425 when Lê Lợi shifted his strategy and moved his forces south into the less-defended, populous region of Nghệ An. This move was highly successful.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Battle:**\n    *   By late 1425, Lê Lợi's forces had captured most of Nghệ An and were besieging the main citadel.\n    *   In response, the Ming court ordered Mu Sheng, based in Yunnan, to lead a large relief army to break the siege.\n    *   As Mu Sheng's army advanced into Nghệ An through the western mountain passes, Lê Lợi anticipated their route. He tasked his talented general, Đinh Lễ, with setting up an ambush.\n    *   The ambush was laid at **Khả Lưu Pass** (Ải Khả Lưu) in the district of Trà Lân.\n    *   Mu Sheng's army walked directly into the trap. They were decisively defeated, reportedly losing thousands of soldiers and a vast amount of weapons and supplies. This was a catastrophic failure for the relief expedition and a huge morale boost for the Vietnamese forces.\n\n4.  **Confirm this as the \"First Major Defeat\":**\n    *   This battle, in late 1425, was the first time an army directly commanded by Mu Sheng himself suffered a large-scale, decisive defeat at the hands of the Lam Sơn rebels.\n    *   It is distinct from the even more disastrous Battle of Tốt Động-Chúc Động in 1426, where the Ming forces were commanded by Wang Tong (Vương Thông), not Mu Sheng directly. Therefore, the Battle of Khả Lưu correctly fits the description of Mu Sheng's *first major defeat*.\n\n5.  **Locate the Modern-Day Province:**\n    *   The historical battle site, Khả Lưu Pass, was located in the district of Trà Lân.\n    *   This historical region corresponds to the western part of modern-day **Nghệ An Province**. Specifically, the area is now part of the Anh Sơn and Con Cuông districts within Nghệ An.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing between commanders:** It is crucial to distinguish between defeats suffered by the Ming army in general and those where Mu Sheng was the direct field commander. The defeat at Tốt Động-Chúc Động was a bigger military disaster for the Ming, but it was Wang Tong's failure, not Mu Sheng's directly.\n*   **Defining \"Major Defeat\":** The battle at Khả Lưu Pass was not a minor skirmish. It involved a large relief army, was a planned ambush, resulted in thousands of casualties, and had significant strategic consequences, effectively stopping the Ming effort to relieve Nghệ An. This qualifies it as a \"major defeat.\"\n*   **Historical Geography:** Mapping historical place names like \"Khả Lưu\" and \"Trà Lân\" to modern administrative units is a key step. Research confirms these locations are within the borders of present-day Nghệ An Province.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred at the Battle of Khả Lưu Pass in late 1425. This historical site is located in the modern-day Vietnamese province of Nghệ An.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
