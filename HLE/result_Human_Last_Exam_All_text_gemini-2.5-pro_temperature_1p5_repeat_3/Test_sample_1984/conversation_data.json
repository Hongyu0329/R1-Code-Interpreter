    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given a first-order autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nWe need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, denoted by $m$. After finding $m$, we must calculate the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Equilibrium Points**\nAn equilibrium point (or fixed point) of the system is a value of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$. Let's denote the right-hand side of the equation as $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$.\nWe need to solve the algebraic equation $f(x) = 0$:\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\n**Careful Point:** It's important to find all the roots of this polynomial. We can start by factoring out a common term.\nFactoring out $-x$ from the expression gives:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term inside the parentheses is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor equal to zero:\n1.  $-x = 0 \\implies x = 0$\n2.  $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x-1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\nThus, the equilibrium points are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stability of Equilibrium Points**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can be determined using the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at that point, $f'(x^*)$.\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point is **stable**.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point is **unstable**.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive, and we need further analysis.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, let's test each equilibrium point:\n*   **For $x = 0$:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For $x = 1$:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    **Careful Point:** Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test fails. We must investigate the behavior of the system near $x=1$ by looking at the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ itself.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Stability of $x=1$ (Inconclusive Case)**\nWe analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ on either side of $x=1$. This is often called a phase line analysis.\n*   **To the left of $x=1$ (e.g., $x = 0.9$):**\n    $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.009$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, which means $x(t)$ is decreasing. A solution starting at $x=0.9$ will move to the left, away from $x=1$.\n\n*   **To the right of $x=1$ (e.g., $x = 1.1$):**\n    $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -0.011$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, which means $x(t)$ is decreasing. A solution starting at $x=1.1$ will move to the left, towards $x=1$.\n\nAn equilibrium point is stable only if solutions on *both* sides converge towards it (or at least stay within a small neighborhood). Since solutions starting just to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is **not stable**. (This type of point is called semi-stable, which is a subtype of unstable equilibrium).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of stable equilibria, $m$**\nBased on our analysis in Steps 3 and 4, we have found:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is an unstable (semi-stable) equilibrium point.\n\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is just one.\n$$ m = 1 $$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1-2^4048>>>"
