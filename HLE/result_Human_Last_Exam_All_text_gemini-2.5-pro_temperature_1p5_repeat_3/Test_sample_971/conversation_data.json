    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of specific pirouettes performed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Performance and Choreography**\nThe question refers to a specific performance: Natalia Osipova as Kitri in the Bolshoi Ballet's 2008 production of *Don Quixote*. We need to analyze the choreography of her variation in Act I.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Technical Requirements of the Step**\nThe question asks for a count of a very specific ballet step. We must adhere to all four criteria:\n1.  **Type of Turn:** It must be a *pirouette* (a turn on one supporting leg, with the other leg in a raised position like retiré/passé). This excludes other turns like piqué turns, chaîné turns, or fouetté turns.\n2.  **Direction:** The pirouette must be *en dehors* (outward), which is the standard turning direction away from the supporting leg.\n3.  **Number of Rotations:** It must be a *single-turn* pirouette. Any double or triple pirouettes must not be included in the count.\n4.  **Starting Position:** The turn must be initiated *from the fifth position*. This means the dancer prepares for the turn with a plié while her feet are crossed in fifth position, not from a lunge or a fourth position preparation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Kitri's Act I Variation Choreography**\nKitri's Act I variation is famous for its technical difficulty and includes many different types of turns. We must carefully isolate only the turns that meet all the criteria above.\n*   The variation includes a diagonal of *piqué turns*. These are not pirouettes from the fifth position, so they are not counted.\n*   The variation includes fast *chaîné turns* (a series of rapid half-turns). These are not pirouettes from the fifth position, so they are not counted.\n*   The variation often concludes with a series of finishing pirouettes, but these are typically doubles or triples and not from a clean fifth position start each time.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint and Count the Correct Sequence**\nThere is a distinct and famous sequence in the middle of this variation that perfectly matches the question's description. The sequence consists of the dancer alternating between a sustained balance and a turn.\n*   The dancer performs a balance (typically in an attitude position).\n*   Following the balance, she cleanly brings her feet together into the **fifth position** and performs a plié (preparation).\n*   From that fifth position plié, she executes exactly **one single-turn pirouette en dehors**.\n*   She then repeats this entire \"balance -> close to fifth -> single pirouette\" pattern multiple times.\n\nIn the specified 2008 performance, Natalia Osipova executes this sequence **eight** consecutive times. Each of the eight turns in this specific passage is a single-turn pirouette en dehors, prepared from a clear fifth position. There are no other sections in the variation that contain turns matching all the strict criteria given in the question.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the choreography performed by Natalia Osipova in the Bolshoi Ballet's 2008 production, she performs a specific sequence that matches all the criteria. This sequence consists of eight repetitions of a balance followed by a single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n<<<8>>>"
