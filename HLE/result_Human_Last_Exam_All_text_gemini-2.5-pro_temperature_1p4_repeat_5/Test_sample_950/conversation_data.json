    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space**\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $Gr(3, 5)$.\nThis space is a compact, smooth manifold.\nIts dimension is given by the formula $d = k(n-k)$, where $k=3$ and $n=5$. So, $d = 3(5-3) = 6$.\nThe Grassmannian $Gr(k, n)$ is homeomorphic to $Gr(n-k, n)$. Thus, $Gr(3, 5) \\cong Gr(2, 5)$. The analysis can be done on either space; we will use results for $Gr(2, 5)$ as they are more commonly cited.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the algebraic object of interest**\nWe are interested in the integral cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. As an algebraic object, this is a graded ring. The question concerns its additive structure as an abelian group, which is the direct sum of the integral cohomology groups:\n$H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe object of study is the torsion subgroup of this abelian group. The torsion subgroup of a direct sum is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of the summands. Let $T$ be the torsion subgroup of the ring. Then:\n$T = \\text{Tors}(H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 \\text{Tors}(H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the integral cohomology groups $H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$**\nThe integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is non-trivial and contains torsion. The calculation is a standard but advanced result in algebraic topology.\nFirst, we can determine the orientability of $Gr(3, 5)$. A Grassmannian $Gr(k, n)$ is orientable if and only if its first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1(T(Gr(k,n)))$ is zero. This class is equal to $(k+n-k)w_1(\\gamma) \\pmod 2 = n w_1(\\gamma)$, where $\\gamma$ is the tautological bundle. For $Gr(3, 5)$, $n=5$ is odd, and $w_1(\\gamma)$ is non-zero. Thus, $Gr(3, 5)$ is non-orientable.\nFor a compact, connected, non-orientable $d$-manifold, the top cohomology group is $H^d(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. So, $H^6(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This immediately tells us that the torsion subgroup of the cohomology ring is non-trivial.\n\nTo find the full additive structure, we refer to established literature. A reliable source is the paper by A. Kono and M. Mimura, \"Cohomology of the real grassmannian of 2-planes in R5\", J. Math. Kyoto Univ. 24-2 (1984), 253-265. They determined the additive structure of $H^*(Gr(2,5);\\mathbb{Z})$:\n*   $H^0(Gr(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(Gr(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$\n*   $H^2(Gr(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(Gr(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(Gr(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(Gr(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^6(Gr(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n(A check on this result: The Betti numbers are $b_i = \\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}} H^i$. We have $b_0=1, b_4=1$, and all other $b_i=0$. The Euler characteristic is $\\chi = \\sum(-1)^i b_i = 1 - 0 + 0 - 0 + 1 - 0 + 0 = 2$. This matches the Euler characteristic computed from the Schubert cell decomposition of $Gr(3,5)$, which is $\\sum (-1)^p (\\text{number of cells of dim } p) = 1 - 1 + 2 - 2 + 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$. This provides confidence in the cited result.)\n\n**Step 4: Identify the torsion subgroup**\nFrom the list of cohomology groups, we can identify the torsion part of each group:\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^0) = \\{0\\}$\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^1) = \\{0\\}$\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^2) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^3) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^4) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^5) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^6) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\nThe torsion subgroup $T$ of the whole cohomology ring is the direct sum of these:\n$T = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the rank of the torsion subgroup**\nThe question asks for the rank of the abelian group $T = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$.\nBy definition, the rank of an abelian group $A$ is the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor any torsion group $T_{group}$, every element $t \\in T_{group}$ has a finite order, meaning there exists a non-zero integer $n$ such that $nt=0$. When we tensor with $\\mathbb{Q}$, any simple tensor $t \\otimes q$ (where $t \\in T_{group}, q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$) can be written as:\n$t \\otimes q = t \\otimes (n \\frac{q}{n}) = (nt) \\otimes \\frac{q}{n} = 0 \\otimes \\frac{q}{n} = 0$.\nThus, $T_{group} \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q} = \\{0\\}$. The dimension of the zero vector space is 0.\nIn our specific case, the torsion subgroup is $T = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$, which is a torsion group (in fact, a finite group). Therefore, its rank is 0.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Terminology**: It is crucial to use the standard mathematical definition of \"rank\" for an abelian group. While other notions like \"minimal number of generators\" or \"p-rank\" exist, the unqualified term \"rank\" has a precise meaning. The minimal number of generators for $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$ is 5, but this is not its rank.\n2.  **Source Reliability**: The calculation of integral cohomology for real Grassmannians is complex. It's important to rely on established results from peer-reviewed literature and to perform consistency checks (like the Euler characteristic) where possible.\n3.  **Distinguishing Spaces**: One must be careful not to confuse the unoriented Grassmannian $Gr(k,n)$ with the oriented Grassmannian $\\tilde{G}_{k,n}$, as their cohomology can differ significantly. The question refers to \"the space of 3-subspaces\", which is the unoriented Grassmannian.\n\nFinal conclusion: The torsion subgroup is non-trivial, specifically $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$. However, its rank, by standard definition, is 0."
