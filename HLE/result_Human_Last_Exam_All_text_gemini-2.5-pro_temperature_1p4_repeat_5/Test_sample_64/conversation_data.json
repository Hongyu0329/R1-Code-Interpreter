    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Reading:**\n    The question asks for the standard pitch accent of the Japanese word 「弟」. This kanji is read as 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Count the Morae:**\n    A mora is a unit of sound that determines syllable weight and timing in Japanese. We need to count the morae in 「おとうと」 to understand how pitch accent patterns apply.\n    *   お (o) - 1st mora\n    *   と (to) - 2nd mora\n    *   う (u) - 3rd mora (This is a long vowel, extending the 'o' sound of 'to')\n    *   と (to) - 4th mora\n    So, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n3.  **Understand the Main Pitch Accent Patterns:**\n    In standard Japanese (Tokyo dialect), there are four main pitch accent patterns:\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板, \"flat type\"):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word. A particle following the word also remains high. (Pattern: L-H-H-H... + particle H) This is denoted by a [0] accent number.\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高, \"head-high type\"):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on all subsequent morae. (Pattern: H-L-L-L...) This is denoted by a [1] accent number.\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高, \"middle-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, peaks somewhere in the middle of the word, and then falls before the last mora. (Pattern: L-H-...-H-L...) The accent number [n] indicates the pitch drops *after* the nth mora.\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高, \"tail-high type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora. The particle that follows the word is pronounced at a low pitch. (Pattern: L-H-H-H + particle L) The accent number [n] is equal to the number of morae in the word.\n\n4.  **Determine the Pitch Accent of 「弟」 (otouto):**\n    According to standard Japanese pitch accent dictionaries (such as the NHK Japanese Pronunciation and Accent Dictionary or OJAD), the word 「弟」 (おとうと) has a [0] pitch accent.\n    *   The [0] notation corresponds to the **Heiban (平板)** pattern.\n\n5.  **Apply the Heiban Pattern to 「おとうと」:**\n    *   The first mora 「お」 is low.\n    *   The pitch rises on the second mora 「と」.\n    *   The pitch stays high for the remaining morae, 「う」 and 「と」.\n    *   A particle following it, like 「が」, would also be high.\n    *   Pitch contour: お(low) - と(high) - う(high) - と(high) - が(high).\n    *   This is the definition of the Heiban pattern.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (おとうと) is Heiban. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
