1. **The Problem of Justified Falsehood:** The model fails to recognize the epistemic value of justification when a belief is false. It forces a Justified False Belief (a belief held for good reasons that turns out to be wrong) into the same category of "Belief" as an Unjustified False Belief (a belief held for no good reason), suggesting they are epistemically equivalent and thus devaluing the process of rational inquiry.
2. **The Problem of Incommensurable Failures:** The framework cannot distinguish between different ways a belief can fail to be knowledge. A Justified False Belief (a failure of the truth condition) and an Unjustified True Belief (a failure of the justification condition) are both relegated to the single state of "Belief." This makes it impossible to recognize that the former is a rational error while the latter is mere luck, and that the former represents a more epistemically virtuous state.
