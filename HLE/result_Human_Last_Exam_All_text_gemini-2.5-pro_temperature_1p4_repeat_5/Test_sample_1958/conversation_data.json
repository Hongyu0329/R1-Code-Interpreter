    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question has four key components that must be addressed correctly to arrive at the right answer:\n1.  **\"Which is the first book in the Bible...\"**: The answer must be the name of a book from the Bible.\n2.  **\"...in canonical order...\"**: This is a crucial constraint. We must follow the standard Protestant biblical canon, as this was the version most familiar to Shakespeare and his audience (e.g., the Geneva Bible or the Bishops' Bible). The search must begin with Genesis and proceed sequentially through the books.\n3.  **\"...to be mentioned by name...\"**: This means we are not looking for allusions, paraphrases, or quotations from a book. The actual *name* of the book (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Psalms\") must appear in the text of the play.\n4.  **\"...in a Shakespeare play, and which play is it mentioned in?\"**: The source must be a play from the Shakespearean canon, and we need to identify both the book and the play.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Canonical Order:** The Protestant Old Testament order starts: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges... Psalms, Proverbs... etc. This order is non-negotiable for finding the \"first\" book.\n*   **Name vs. Allusion:** A reference to a character like Job, Samson, or Cain, or a quote from the Sermon on the Mount, does *not* count unless the book itself (Job, Judges, Genesis, Matthew) is named.\n*   **Common Words:** Some book names are common English words (e.g., Numbers, Judges, Kings). The context must be checked to ensure the reference is to the biblical book and not just the common meaning of the word.\n*   **Multiple Mentions:** A book might be mentioned in more than one play. The question only requires identifying one such play.\n\n### Step-by-Step Path to the Answer\n\n1.  **Start at the beginning of the Bible:** The first book is **Genesis**. A thorough search of Shakespeare's complete works shows that while there are many allusions to stories in Genesis (Cain and Abel, Adam and Eve, Noah's ark), the word \"Genesis\" is never used to name the book.\n2.  **Proceed to the next book:** The second book is **Exodus**. Like Genesis, its stories are alluded to, but the book is not mentioned by name.\n3.  **Proceed to the next book:** The third book is **Leviticus**. It is not mentioned by name in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n4.  **Proceed to the next book:** The fourth book is **Numbers**. We search the plays for the phrase \"Book of Numbers\" or a similar clear reference.\n    *   **Result:** We find a direct hit. In *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act IV, Scene 1), the Welsh parson Sir Hugh Evans, questioning the boy William Page on his Latin lessons, says: \"...what is your genitive case plural, William?\" When William struggles, his mother intervenes, and Evans says the boy has been reading a different book: **\"the book of Numbers.\"**\n    *   **Confirmation:** A second mention appears in *Henry V* (Act I, Scene 2), where the Archbishop of Canterbury argues for Henry's claim to the French throne by citing a passage: \"For in **the book of Numbers** is it writ, / When the man dies, let the inheritance / Descend unto the daughter.\"\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the first three books of the Bible are not mentioned by name, and the fourth book, **Numbers**, is explicitly named, we have found our answer. There is no need to continue searching through the rest of the canon (e.g., Psalms, which is mentioned later in the biblical order) as we are looking for the *first* book in canonical sequence.\n\nThe first book of the Bible mentioned by name is the Book of Numbers. It is mentioned in *The Merry Wives of Windsor* and *Henry V*.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers, in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.>>>"
