    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe question asks for a specific numerical detail from Anton Chekhov's short story, \"The Chameleon.\" The core task is to count how many times the author describes the coat of the main character, Police Superintendent Otchumyelov. The question itself provides a critical piece of literary analysis: that the descriptions of the coat are not merely sartorial details but are symbolic of the character's shifting mentality and servility. Therefore, the count should include not only static descriptions but also any actions involving the coat (putting it on, taking it off) that serve this symbolic purpose.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Defining \"Describe\":** The term \"describe\" must be interpreted in the context of the story's symbolism. A \"description\" in this case refers to any mention of the coat that highlights its state or Otchumyelov's interaction with it, as each interaction reflects a change in his attitude.\n2.  **Consistency in Translation:** The original story is in Russian. While English translations may have minor wording differences, the key actions involving the coat are central to the plot and symbolism and remain consistent across standard translations.\n3.  **Chronological Tracking:** The most accurate way to count is to read through the story chronologically and tally each instance where the coat is mentioned in a descriptive or active way that aligns with the story's theme.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\nBy carefully reading the text of \"The Chameleon,\" we can identify each moment the greatcoat is described.\n\n1.  **First Description (Initial State of Authority):** At the beginning of the story, as Otchumyelov walks through the square, Chekhov establishes his official status. The text states he is wearing a **\"new greatcoat.\"** This initial description sets up the coat as a symbol of his authority.\n\n2.  **Second Description (First Shift to Servility):** When Otchumyelov hears that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, he is instantly alarmed at the prospect of offending a superior. He physically manifests this anxiety, stating he is hot. He orders his subordinate, \"'Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...'\" This action of removing the coat is the second description, symbolizing his shedding of authority.\n\n3.  **Third Description (Return to Authority):** A moment later, someone in the crowd suggests the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov's authoritative demeanor returns. He now feels a chill and says, \"'Help me on with my greatcoat, brother; I feel the wind getting up...'\" Putting the coat back on is the third description, symbolizing the return of his official harshness.\n\n4.  **Fourth Description (Second Shift to Servility):** The policeman speculates that the General's brother might own a similar dog. This is enough to make Otchumyelov panic again. He once again feels hot and orders, \"'Just take my coat off, Yeldyrin...'\" This is the fourth instance, a repeat of his symbolic act of removing his authoritative shell.\n\n5.  **Fifth Description (Return to Authority):** The General's cook arrives and states firmly that the dog is not theirs. Otchumyelov immediately reverts to his bullying persona. He again feels a chill, saying, \"'Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad... I've got a shivering fit.'\" This is the fifth description, putting his coat of authority back on.\n\n6.  **Sixth Description (Final State of Sycophancy):** Finally, the cook clarifies that the dog actually belongs to the General's *brother*. Otchumyelov's attitude makes its final and definitive shift to fawning respect. As he walks away, the story concludes: **\"He wraps himself in his greatcoat** and, crossing the market-place, goes on his way.\" This final action is the sixth description, symbolizing him settling comfortably into his role as a sycophant.\n\nBy counting each of these distinct instances, we arrive at the total number of times Chekhov used the coat to describe Otchumyelov's character shifts.\n\n<<<6>>>"
