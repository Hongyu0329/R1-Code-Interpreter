    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Terminology:**\n    *   **Cambré Derrière:** A bend of the body backwards from the waist.\n    *   **Vaganova Method:** The Russian ballet method, known for its precision, strength, expressive upper body, and a structured, logical training system. It emphasizes clean lines and core stability.\n    *   **Balanchine Method:** The American ballet method developed by George Balanchine, characterized by speed, musicality, long lines, deep pliés, and a distinct neoclassical aesthetic that often pushes classical forms to their extremes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Cambré Derrière in the Vaganova Method:**\n    *   The bend is initiated from the upper back, creating a long, even curve through the entire spine.\n    *   The primary principle is to maintain stability in the lower body. The hips must remain square and aligned over the supporting leg(s).\n    *   To counterbalance, the hips press slightly forward, but this is done without \"breaking\" the line at the hip joint. The dancer is taught to lift up and out of the waist before and during the bend.\n    *   The head follows the line of the spine naturally.\n    *   The overall aesthetic is one of control, strength, and a pure, unbroken classical line.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Cambré Derrière in the Balanchine Method:**\n    *   The Balanchine style often seeks a deeper and more dramatic visual effect.\n    *   To achieve this, the dancer is typically taught to release one or both hips forward significantly. This action is often described as a \"broken hip\" line.\n    *   By pushing the hips forward, the dancer can achieve a deeper backbend, creating a more extreme, angular, and dynamic shape. This is a stylistic choice, not a lack of technique.\n    *   The movement often has a quality of being \"off-balance\" and is executed with great speed and attack to match the musical phrasing Balanchine preferred.\n    *   The head may be thrown back more dramatically to accentuate the line.\n\n4.  **Compare the Two Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic nuances in arm placement (port de bras) between the methods, this is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the cambré derrière.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the key point of divergence. Vaganova insists on square, stable hips to maintain a pure line. Balanchine intentionally uses a released, forward-pushed hip to create a different, deeper, and more dynamic line. This is the most significant and well-known technical difference.\n    *   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is generally faster, a cambré can be performed at various tempos in either method depending on the exercise or choreography. Speed is a characteristic of the overall style, not the defining technical difference of this specific step.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the bend is a result of flexibility and the technique used. The Balanchine hip placement *allows* for a visually deeper bend, but the core difference is *how* that bend is achieved (the technique), not just the resulting depth.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** The head placement is a consequence of the spinal and hip alignment. The dramatic head position in Balanchine is a result of the released hip and deeper bend. It is a secondary difference, stemming from the hip placement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most fundamental and defining technical difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière lies in the treatment of the hips. Vaganova prioritizes stability and a square hip line, while Balanchine utilizes a released, forward-pushed hip to create its signature aesthetic.\n\n<<<B>>>"
