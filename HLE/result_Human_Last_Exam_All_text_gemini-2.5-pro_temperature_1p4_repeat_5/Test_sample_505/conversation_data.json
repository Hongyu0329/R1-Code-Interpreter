    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics of Surface Codes and Logical Qubits:**\n    *   A surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code defined on a 2D lattice of physical qubits.\n    *   A logical qubit is an abstract quantum bit that is encoded across many physical qubits to protect it from local errors.\n    *   The number of logical qubits that can be encoded on a surface depends on its topological properties, not the specific number of physical qubits (as long as it's large enough to support the topology).\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Topological Features from the Question:**\n    *   **Patches:** The question specifies \"two patches\". A patch is a connected, distinct area of the surface code. Since they are separate, they form a disconnected surface with two components.\n    *   **Holes:** The question specifies \"two holes\" in total across these two patches. A hole in a surface code patch is a region where the code lattice is intentionally removed or modified. Topologically, a hole creates a new boundary on the surface.\n    *   **Genus:** Standard surface code patches are laid out on a plane. A plane is topologically equivalent to a sphere with a hole in it. The genus, which represents the number of \"handles\" (like in a donut), is 0 for a simple patch. The problem does not mention any twisting or joining of edges that would create a non-zero genus.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula for Logical Qubits:**\n    The number of logical qubits ($k$) on a surface is determined by its genus ($g$) and its number of boundaries ($b$). For a single, connected, orientable surface, the formula is:\n    $k = 2g + b - 1$\n\n4.  **Analyze a Single Patch:**\n    Let's first consider a single patch of surface code with $h$ holes.\n    *   The genus $g = 0$ (as it's a planar patch).\n    *   The number of boundaries $b$ is the sum of the outer boundary of the patch and the inner boundaries created by the holes. So, $b = 1$ (outer) + $h$ (holes).\n    *   Plugging this into the formula:\n        $k = 2(0) + (1 + h) - 1 = h$\n    *   This gives a very important rule: **For a single planar patch, the number of logical qubits it can encode is equal to the number of holes it contains.**\n\n5.  **Analyze the Total System (Two Patches, Two Holes):**\n    We have two separate patches and a total of two holes to distribute among them. Since the patches are not connected, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the logical qubits encoded on each patch individually.\n\n    Let $h_1$ be the number of holes in the first patch and $h_2$ be the number of holes in the second patch. We know that the total number of holes is two, so $h_1 + h_2 = 2$.\n\n    *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 1 ($k_1$) = $h_1$\n    *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 2 ($k_2$) = $h_2$\n    *   Total logical qubits ($k_{total}$) = $k_1 + k_2 = h_1 + h_2$\n\n    Since $h_1 + h_2 = 2$, the total number of logical qubits is always 2, regardless of how the holes are distributed.\n\n6.  **Consider Possible Distributions (and the \"at most\" part of the question):**\n    The question asks for the maximum number of logical qubits. Let's check the possible ways to distribute the two holes:\n    *   **Case A:** Two holes on Patch 1 ($h_1=2$) and zero holes on Patch 2 ($h_2=0$).\n        *   $k_1 = 2$ logical qubits.\n        *   $k_2 = 0$ logical qubits.\n        *   Total = $2 + 0 = 2$.\n    *   **Case B:** One hole on Patch 1 ($h_1=1$) and one hole on Patch 2 ($h_2=1$).\n        *   $k_1 = 1$ logical qubit.\n        *   $k_2 = 1$ logical qubit.\n        *   Total = $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n    In all possible configurations, the total number of logical qubits is exactly 2. Therefore, the maximum number is 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Topology is Key:** The result depends entirely on the topological properties (patches, holes, genus), not the physical size or distance of the patches.\n*   **Patches are Separate:** The analysis assumes the two patches are distinct and not connected in any way that would change the topology (e.g., by a bridge of qubits).\n*   **Holes are Boundaries:** Each hole adds one boundary to the surface. It's the number of boundaries relative to the number of connected components that determines the number of logical qubits.\n*   **Formula for Disconnected Surfaces:** An alternative way to think about it is using the formula for a disconnected surface with $c$ components: $k = 2g + b - c$.\n    *   Total genus $g=0$.\n    *   Total number of components $c=2$ (the two patches).\n    *   Total number of boundaries $b$ = 2 (for the outer edges of each patch) + 2 (for the two holes) = 4.\n    *   $k = 2(0) + 4 - 2 = 2$. This confirms the result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the holes in each separate patch. With two patches and two holes in total, the number of logical qubits is always 2, regardless of the distribution.\n\n<<<2>>>"
