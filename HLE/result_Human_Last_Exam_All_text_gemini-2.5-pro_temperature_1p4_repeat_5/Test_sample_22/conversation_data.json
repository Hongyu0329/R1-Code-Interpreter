    "This is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Statement**\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A single value that summarizes the estimated effect of many genetic variants (SNPs) on an individual's phenotype. It's a practical tool for prediction.\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This is measured by the proportion of variance (R²) in a phenotype that the PGS can explain in a *new, independent* dataset (a \"target\" sample). It's a measure of real-world performance.\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population parameter representing the proportion of phenotypic variance that is explained by the additive effects of *all* the SNPs being considered. It's a theoretical upper bound or a \"ceiling\" for prediction using those SNPs. It represents the total amount of signal available.\n*   **The Core Question:** Is the real-world performance of a PGS (`R²_PGS`) always less than the theoretical maximum signal available from the SNPs (`h²_SNP`)?\n\n**2. List the Careful Points and Analyze the Relationship**\n\n*   **Perfect Knowledge vs. Estimated Knowledge:** The crucial distinction is that `h²_SNP` represents the variance explained by a hypothetical, \"perfect\" score built using the *true* effect sizes of all SNPs. In contrast, a real PGS is built using *estimated* effect sizes derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   **Sources of Imperfection in PGS:** The estimation process for a PGS is inherently imperfect for several reasons:\n    *   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** A GWAS is conducted on a finite number of people. This leads to statistical noise and uncertainty in the estimated effect sizes. They are estimates, not the true values.\n    *   **Winner's Curse:** SNPs selected for inclusion in a PGS because they have small p-values in the GWAS tend to have their effect sizes overestimated. This leads to poorer performance when applied to a new sample.\n    *   **LD and Causal Variants:** A GWAS often identifies a \"tag SNP\" that is simply in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the true causal SNP. The effect size is therefore diluted, and if the LD pattern differs in the target sample, the prediction accuracy drops.\n    *   **Modeling Choices:** Many methods for building a PGS only include SNPs that pass a certain significance threshold (e.g., p < 5x10⁻⁸), thereby ignoring the small, real effects of many other SNPs which are included in the `h²_SNP` estimate.\n*   **The Ceiling Analogy:** Think of SNP heritability (`h²_SNP`) as the ceiling of a room. It's the highest point you can possibly reach. The predictive ability of your PGS is how high you can actually jump. Because of real-world limitations (gravity, your strength, your technique – analogous to finite sample size, estimation error, LD), your jump will necessarily fall short of the ceiling. You can get closer to the ceiling with better training (a larger GWAS), but you cannot jump higher than the ceiling itself.\n\n**3. Conclusion of the Analysis**\n\nThe SNP heritability (`h²_SNP`) is, by definition, the maximum possible variance that can be explained by a linear combination of the SNPs. A polygenic score is one such linear combination, but it is constructed with imperfect information (estimated weights from a finite sample). Because the weights are not the true, perfect weights, the predictive performance of the resulting score in a new sample will necessarily be lower than this theoretical maximum. The predictive accuracy of a PGS can approach the SNP heritability as the GWAS sample size becomes infinitely large and all other methodological issues are resolved, but in any practical application, it will be lower.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\n<<<True>>>"
