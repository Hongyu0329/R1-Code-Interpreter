Yes, the theory can fail. The introduction of a birefringent medium acts on the polarization state of the light, a degree of freedom that the original "inverse" procedure (involving only `T⁻¹` and `P⁻¹`) does not account for. When the calculated `Output 2` (which has had its polarization altered by `B` once) is sent back through the system, the birefringent medium acts on it a second time. Since the operator for the birefringent medium `B` is generally not equal to its square `B²`, the final output will not match the desired `Output 1`, causing the theory to break down.
