    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step 1: Identify All Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad*\n\nFirst, we must compile a list of all the named mountains that appear in Homer's epic poem. These are all real, historical locations.\n\n1.  **Mount Olympus:** The most frequently mentioned mountain, serving as the home of the Olympian gods. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n2.  **Mount Ida:** Located near Troy (in modern-day Turkey). In the *Iliad*, gods like Zeus often observe the battle from its peaks.\n3.  **Mount Athos:** Mentioned in Book 14 as part of Hera's journey from Olympus to Lemnos to deceive Zeus. It is a mountain and peninsula in northeastern Greece.\n4.  **Mount Samothrace (modern name Fengari):** Mentioned in Book 13. Poseidon sits on its summit to watch the Trojan War, as it offered a clear view of Troy and the battlefield.\n5.  **Mount Pelion:** Located in Thessaly, Greece. It is mentioned as the source of the ash wood used to create Achilles' powerful spear.\n6.  **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in Book 2 in the \"Catalogue of Ships.\" It is described as a snowy mountain under which the Maeonian allies of the Trojans lived. It is located in the region of Lydia in modern-day Turkey.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Modern Elevations of These Mountains\n\nTo find the tallest mountain after Olympus, we need to compare their summit elevations.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 feet)\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ):** 2,159 meters (7,083 feet)\n*   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n*   **Mount Ida (Kazdağı):** 1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n\n### Step 3: Compare and Rank the Mountains by Height\n\nNow, we can rank these mountains by elevation, from tallest to shortest. The question asks for the tallest *after* Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  Mount Olympus (2,918 m) - This is the tallest, but excluded from the final answer.\n2.  **Mount Tmolus (2,159 m)**\n3.  Mount Athos (2,033 m)\n4.  Mount Ida (1,774 m)\n5.  Mount Pelion (1,624 m)\n6.  Mount Samothrace (1,611 m)\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Historical vs. Mythological:** All the mountains listed are real, physical locations that exist today, making them \"historical\" mountains.\n*   **Specific Mentions:** Each mountain is explicitly named or clearly referenced within the text of the *Iliad*.\n*   **Accuracy of Elevation:** The elevations are based on modern geographic data.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nAfter ranking all the mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* by their height, the tallest mountain after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
