    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### **Part 1: Understanding the Role of Large Deviation Theorems**\n\nThe question asks us to use the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems. In the context of statistical mechanics, these theorems provide the formal mathematical foundation for the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n1.  **The Core Idea**: Large Deviation Theory (LDT) deals with the probability of rare events. It shows that the probability of a macroscopic system spontaneously being in a state far from equilibrium is exponentially small for a large number of particles. The equilibrium state is the one that is overwhelmingly the most probable.\n2.  **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem relates the probability of observing a certain empirical distribution (a macrostate) to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the true underlying distribution. For a system where all microstates are assumed to be a-priori equally likely, minimizing this divergence is equivalent to maximizing the statistical entropy, $S = k_B \\ln W$, where $W$ is the number of microstates corresponding to the macrostate.\n3.  **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem provides a rate function for the deviation of the sample mean of random variables from the expected value. In the canonical ensemble (a system at constant temperature), it justifies minimizing the Helmholtz Free Energy, $F = U - TS$, to find the equilibrium state. The rate function is directly related to the free energy.\n\n**Conclusion**: \"Using\" these theorems means we apply the physical principles they justify: the **Principle of Maximum Entropy** (for an isolated system with fixed energy) or the **Principle of Minimum Free Energy** (for a system at constant temperature). We will use the latter, which is more direct for this problem.\n\n#### **Part 2: Setting up the System (Light Quanta)**\n\n1.  **Particles**: Light quanta (photons) are bosons, so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics.\n2.  **Key Property**: The number of photons is not conserved. This is a critical feature, as it implies that in the language of the grand canonical ensemble, the chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$). This simplifies the analysis as we do not need to enforce a constraint on the total particle number.\n3.  **Macrostate Definition**: A macrostate of the system is defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{n_j\\}$, where $n_j$ is the number of photons in the energy level $j$. Each energy level $j$ has a specific energy $\\epsilon_j$ and contains $g_j$ degenerate single-particle quantum states.\n\n#### **Part 3: Deriving the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nWe seek the set of occupation numbers $\\{\\bar{n}_j\\}$ that describes the equilibrium state. Following the principle justified by LDT, we will find the distribution that minimizes the Helmholtz Free Energy $F = U - TS$.\n\n1.  **Total Energy (U)**: The total energy of a macrostate is the sum of the energies of all photons:\n    $U = \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j$\n2.  **Entropy (S)**: The statistical entropy is given by $S = k_B \\ln W$, where $W$ is the total number of microstates for the macrostate $\\{n_j\\}$. For bosons, the number of ways to arrange $n_j$ indistinguishable particles in $g_j$ distinguishable states is $W_j = \\frac{(n_j + g_j - 1)!}{n_j! (g_j - 1)!}$.\n    The total number of microstates is $W = \\prod_j W_j$.\n    For large numbers, using Stirling's approximation ($\\ln x! \\approx x \\ln x - x$), the entropy becomes:\n    $S = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (n_j+g_j)\\ln(n_j+g_j) - n_j \\ln n_j - g_j \\ln g_j \\right]$\n3.  **Minimizing Free Energy**: We minimize $F = U - TS$ with respect to each $n_j$. The temperature $T$ is considered fixed (canonical ensemble).\n    $F(\\{n_j\\}) = \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j - k_B T \\sum_j \\left[ (n_j+g_j)\\ln(n_j+g_j) - n_j \\ln n_j - g_j \\ln g_j \\right]$\n    We take the partial derivative with respect to $n_j$ and set it to zero for each $j$:\n    $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial n_j} = \\epsilon_j - k_B T \\left[ \\ln(n_j+g_j) + 1 - \\ln(n_j) - 1 - 0 \\right] = 0$\n    $\\epsilon_j - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_j+g_j}{n_j}\\right) = 0$\n    $\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{g_j}{n_j}\\right) = \\frac{\\epsilon_j}{k_B T}$\n    Let $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n    $1 + \\frac{g_j}{n_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$\n    $\\frac{g_j}{n_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1$\n    This gives the equilibrium occupation number $\\bar{n}_j$ for the energy level $j$:\n    $\\bar{n}_j = \\frac{g_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n    This is the celebrated Planck distribution law, a special case of the Bose-Einstein distribution for $\\mu=0$.\n\n#### **Part 4: Calculating Equilibrium Mean Energy and Entropy**\n\nNow we use the equilibrium distribution $\\bar{n}_j$ to find the macroscopic equilibrium values.\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**:\n    The mean energy is found by summing the energy of each level weighted by its equilibrium occupation number:\n    $U = \\sum_j \\bar{n}_j \\epsilon_j$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\bar{n}_j$:\n    $U = \\sum_j \\frac{g_j \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Entropy (S)**:\n    We substitute the equilibrium values $\\bar{n}_j$ back into the entropy formula. It is easier to use the equilibrium condition $\\beta \\epsilon_j = \\ln(1 + g_j/\\bar{n}_j)$ to simplify the expression for $S$:\n    $\\frac{S}{k_B} = \\sum_j \\left[ (\\bar{n}_j+g_j)\\ln(\\bar{n}_j+g_j) - \\bar{n}_j \\ln \\bar{n}_j - g_j \\ln g_j \\right]$\n    $= \\sum_j \\left[ \\bar{n}_j \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\bar{n}_j+g_j}{\\bar{n}_j}\\right) + g_j \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\bar{n}_j+g_j}{g_j}\\right) \\right]$\n    $= \\sum_j \\left[ \\bar{n}_j (\\beta \\epsilon_j) + g_j \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\bar{n}_j}{g_j}\\right) \\right]$\n    Now substitute $\\bar{n}_j/g_j = 1/(e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}-1)$:\n    $= \\sum_j \\left[ \\beta \\bar{n}_j \\epsilon_j + g_j \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}-1}\\right) \\right]$\n    $= \\sum_j \\left[ \\beta \\bar{n}_j \\epsilon_j + g_j \\ln\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}-1}\\right) \\right]$\n    $= \\sum_j \\left[ \\beta \\bar{n}_j \\epsilon_j - g_j \\ln\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}-1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}}\\right) \\right]$\n    $= \\sum_j \\left[ \\beta \\bar{n}_j \\epsilon_j - g_j \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) \\right]$\n    Recognizing that $\\sum_j \\beta \\bar{n}_j \\epsilon_j = \\beta U$:\n    $S = k_B \\left[ \\beta U - \\sum_j g_j \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) \\right]$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values are expressed in terms of the temperature $T$ (via $\\beta = 1/k_B T$) and the energy level structure of the system (given by the energies $\\epsilon_j$ and degeneracies $g_j$ of the levels).\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n    $U = \\sum_{j} \\frac{g_j \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n    $S = k_B \\left[ \\beta U - \\sum_{j} g_j \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) \\right]$"
