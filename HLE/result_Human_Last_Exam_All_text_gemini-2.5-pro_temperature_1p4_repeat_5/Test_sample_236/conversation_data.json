    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Homology Cobordism Group and Integral Surgery**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$)**: This is the group of integral homology 3-spheres (3-manifolds $Y$ with $H_*(Y; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_*(S^3; \\mathbb{Z})$) under the connected sum operation. Two homology spheres, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, are considered equivalent if their difference, $Y_1 \\# (-Y_2)$, bounds an integral homology 4-ball. The identity element is the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: To obtain an integral homology sphere from Dehn surgery on a knot $K \\subset S^3$, the surgery coefficient must be $p/q$ with $|p|=1$. This is because the first homology group of the resulting manifold $S_{p/q}^3(K)$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/|p|\\mathbb{Z}$. So, we only need to consider surgeries with coefficients $+1$ and $-1$. The resulting manifolds are denoted $S^3_1(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$.\n\n**2. List the Knots with at most Four Crossings**\n\nWe need to consider all distinct knots (up to ambient isotopy) with at most four crossings. The list is as follows:\n*   **0 crossings**: The unknot ($0_1$). This knot is amphicheiral (equivalent to its mirror image).\n*   **1, 2 crossings**: There are no knots with 1 or 2 crossings.\n*   **3 crossings**: The trefoil knot ($3_1$). This knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image. So we must consider both the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil ($m(3_1)$).\n*   **4 crossings**: The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphicheiral.\n\nSo, the set of knots to analyze is $\\{0_1, 3_1, m(3_1), 4_1\\}$.\n\n**3. Perform Surgeries and Identify the Resulting Manifolds**\n\nFor each knot, we perform $+1$ and $-1$ surgery and identify the resulting homology sphere. We also identify the corresponding element in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$.\n\n*   **Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   $S^3_1(0_1) = S^3$. This represents the identity element, `[0]`.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1) = S^3$. This also represents the identity, `[0]`.\n\n*   **Right-Handed Trefoil ($3_1$)**:\n    *   $S^3_1(3_1)$: This is the Poincaré homology sphere, $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. It represents a non-trivial element of order 2 in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$. Let's call its class `[P]`.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$: This is the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$. It is known to represent an element of infinite order. Let's call its class `[X]`.\n\n*   **Left-Handed Trefoil ($m(3_1)$)**:\n    We use the general formula $S^3_p(m(K)) = -S^3_{-p}(K)$, where $-Y$ denotes the manifold $Y$ with reversed orientation. The class of $-Y$ in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$ is the inverse of the class of $Y$.\n    *   $S^3_1(m(3_1)) = -S^3_{-1}(3_1) = -\\Sigma(2,3,7)$. This represents the inverse of `[X]`, which is `[-X]`.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(m(3_1)) = -S^3_1(3_1) = -\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. This represents the inverse of `[P]`, which is `[-P]`.\n\n*   **Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**:\n    This knot is amphicheiral, so $4_1 = m(4_1)$.\n    *   $S^3_1(4_1)$: This is a hyperbolic homology sphere. It represents an element of infinite order. Let's call its class `[Y]`.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$: Since $4_1$ is amphicheiral, $S^3_{-1}(4_1) = S^3_{-1}(m(4_1)) = -S^3_1(4_1)$. This represents the inverse of `[Y]`, which is `[-Y]`.\n\n**4. Consolidate the List of Homology Cobordism Classes**\n\nThe set of generated classes is $\\{[0], [P], [X], [-X], [-P], [Y], [-Y]\\}$.\nNow, we must identify which of these are distinct.\n\n*   The class of the Poincaré sphere, `[P]`, is known to have order 2. This means `[P] + [P] = [0]`, so `[P] = [-P]`.\n*   The classes `[X]` and `[Y]` are of infinite order, so `[X] \\neq [-X]` and `[Y] \\neq [-Y]` (as they are non-trivial).\n\nSo our set of potentially distinct classes is $\\{[0], [P], [X], [-X], [Y], [-Y]\\}$. We need to check if there are any other equivalences among these 6 classes.\n\n**5. Distinguish the Classes Using Invariants**\n\nWe can use invariants of homology cobordism to distinguish these classes.\n\n*   **Casson Invariant ($\\lambda$)**: If two spheres are homology cobordant, they must have the same Casson invariant. $\\lambda(-Y) = -\\lambda(Y)$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S^3) = 0$. So `[0]` is distinct from the others.\n    *   $\\lambda(\\Sigma(2,3,5)) = 1$. So for `[P]`, $\\lambda=1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(\\Sigma(2,3,7)) = -1$. So for `[X]`, $\\lambda=-1$. For `[-X]`, $\\lambda=1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S^3_1(4_1)) = -1$. So for `[Y]`, $\\lambda=-1$. For `[-Y]`, $\\lambda=1$.\n    This invariant distinguishes `[X]` from `[-X]` and `[Y]` from `[-Y]`. It also shows that (`[P]`, `[-X]`, `[-Y]`) form one group with $\\lambda=1$, and (`[X]`, `[Y]`) form another with $\\lambda=-1$.\n\n*   **Order in the group**: The order of an element is an invariant.\n    *   `[P]` has order 2.\n    *   `[X]` and `[Y]` have infinite order.\n    This distinguishes `[P]` from `[X]`, `[-X]`, `[Y]`, and `[-Y]`.\n\n*   **Geometric Structure**: A theorem by Boyer, Litherland, and Nicas states that homology spheres with different Thurston geometries (Spherical, Seifert Fibered, Hyperbolic) cannot be homology cobordant.\n    *   $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ (representing `[P]`) has a spherical geometry.\n    *   $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ (representing `[X]`) is a Seifert fibered space with $\\widetilde{SL_2(\\mathbb{R})}$ geometry.\n    *   $S^3_1(4_1)$ (representing `[Y]`) is a hyperbolic manifold.\n    Since these three manifolds have different geometries, their classes `[P]`, `[X]`, and `[Y]` must be distinct.\n    *   This implies their inverses `[-P]`, `[-X]`, and `[-Y]` are also distinct from each other.\n\n**Conclusion of the Analysis**\n\nBased on the analysis, the set of generated homology cobordism classes is $\\{[0], [P], [X], [-X], [Y], [-Y]\\}$. All six of these elements are distinct.\n\n1.  `[0]` (from the unknot): The identity element.\n2.  `[P]` (from $S^3_1(3_1)$ and $S^3_{-1}(m(3_1))$): Order 2, spherical geometry.\n3.  `[X]` (from $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$): Infinite order, $\\widetilde{SL_2(\\mathbb{R})}$ geometry.\n4.  `[-X]` (from $S^3_1(m(3_1))$): Inverse of `[X]`, same geometry.\n5.  `[Y]` (from $S^3_1(4_1)$): Infinite order, hyperbolic geometry.\n6.  `[-Y]` (from $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$): Inverse of `[Y]`, same geometry.\n\nCounting these distinct elements, we find there are 6.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
