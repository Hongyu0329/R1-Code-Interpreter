    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition of $n$. A partition of an integer $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\dots + \\lambda_k = n$, where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$. We denote this partition by $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$.\n\nFor $n=25$, we want to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep, denoted $d_\\lambda$, is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is calculated using the Hook-Length Formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in Y(\\lambda)} h_{ij}}$,\nwhere $Y(\\lambda)$ is the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell at row $i$ and column $j$.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ tends to be small for partitions that are \"far from the center\", i.e., partitions with a very large first part ($\\lambda_1$) or a very large number of parts ($k$). For any partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ has a Young diagram that is the transpose of the diagram for $\\lambda$. The corresponding irreps have the same dimension, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. Since $n=25$ is odd, a partition cannot be self-conjugate, so $\\lambda \\neq \\lambda'$. This means that for every irrep we find with dimension less than 500,000, its conjugate also satisfies the condition, and they correspond to distinct partitions.\n\nWe will systematically search for partitions $\\lambda$ with $\\lambda_1 \\ge n/2 = 12.5$, check their dimensions, and then account for their conjugates.\n\nLet's list the partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 with $\\lambda_1 \\ge 18$ and compute their dimensions. For complicated partitions, we can use known formulas or computational tools.\n\n1.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=25$**:\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$. This corresponds to the trivial representation. $d_{(25)} = 1$.\n\n2.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=24$**:\n    *   The only partition of $25-24=1$ is (1). So, $\\lambda = (24,1)$. This is a hook partition, and its dimension is $d_{(24,1)} = \\binom{25-1}{1} = 24$.\n\n3.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=23$**:\n    *   Partitions of 2: (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,2)$. Dimension $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23,1,1) = (23,1^2)$. Dimension $d_{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n\n4.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=22$**:\n    *   Partitions of 3: (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,3)$. $d_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,2,1)$. $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4025$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22,1^3)$. $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$.\n\n5.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=21$**:\n    *   Partitions of 4: (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1^4).\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,4)$. $d=10350$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,3,1)$. $d=31350$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,2,2)$. $d=21000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,2,1,1)$. $d=31625$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (21,1^4)$. $d=\\binom{24}{4} = 10626$.\n\n6.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=20$**:\n    *   Partitions of 5.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,5)$. $d=40480$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,4,1)$. $d=163900$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,3,2)$. $d=207000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,3,1^2)$. $d=249480$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,2,2,1)$. $d=209000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,2,1^3)$. $d=84265$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (20,1^5)$. $d=\\binom{24}{5} = 42504$.\n\n7.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=19$**:\n    *   Partitions of 6.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19,6)$. $d=123970$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19,1^6)$. $d=\\binom{24}{6} = 134596$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19,2,1^4)$. $d=233100$.\n    *   Other partitions of 6 like $(5,1), (4,2), (4,1,1), (3,3), (3,2,1), \\dots$ when appended to (19) give dimensions greater than 500,000. For instance, $d_{(19,5,1)} = 632500$.\n\n8.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=18$**:\n    *   Partitions of 7.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18,7)$. $d=303600$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18,1^7)$. $d=\\binom{24}{7} = 346104$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18,2,1^5)$. $d=466200$.\n    *   Other partitions of 7 when appended to (18) give dimensions greater than 500,000.\n\n9.  **Partitions with $\\lambda_1=17$**:\n    *   For $\\lambda=(17,8)$, $d = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1081575-480700=600875 > 500000$.\n    *   For $\\lambda=(17,1^8)$, $d=\\binom{24}{8}=735471>500000$.\n    *   Any partition starting with $\\lambda_1 \\le 17$ will be more \"central\" and have an even larger dimension. So we can stop our search here.\n\nNow, let's count the partitions we found:\n*   $\\lambda_1=25$: 1 partition\n*   $\\lambda_1=24$: 1 partition\n*   $\\lambda_1=23$: 2 partitions\n*   $\\lambda_1=22$: 3 partitions\n*   $\\lambda_1=21$: 5 partitions\n*   $\\lambda_1=20$: 7 partitions\n*   $\\lambda_1=19$: 3 partitions\n*   $\\lambda_1=18$: 3 partitions\n\nTotal number of such partitions: $1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 3 = 25$.\n\nFor each of these 25 partitions, $\\lambda$, its first part $\\lambda_1$ is greater than or equal to 18. The number of parts in the conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is equal to $\\lambda_1$. So, for the conjugate partitions, the number of parts is $\\ge 18$. The partitions we listed have at most 8 parts (for $(18,1^7)$). This means none of the 25 partitions we found is a conjugate of another in the list.\n\nThus, each of these 25 partitions has a distinct conjugate partition which also corresponds to an irrep of the same dimension (< 500,000). This gives us another 25 distinct partitions.\n\nTotal number of irreps is $25 + 25 = 50$.\n\nFinal check of the 50 partitions:\n1.  (25) and its conjugate (1^25), d=1.\n2.  (24,1) and its conjugate (2,1^23), d=24.\n3.  (23,2) and (2^2,1^21), d=275.\n4.  (23,1^2) and (3,1^22), d=276.\n5.  (22,3) and (2^3,1^19), d=2000.\n6.  (22,1^3) and (4,1^21), d=2024.\n7.

(19,2,1^4) and (6,2,1^{17}), d=233100.\n22. (20,3,1^2) and (4,3,1^{18}), d=249480.\n23. (18,7) and (2^7,1^{11}), d=303600.\n24. (18,1^7) and (8,1^{17}), d=346104.\n25. (18,2,1^5) and (7,2,1^{16}), d=466200.\n\nAll 50 dimensions are strictly less than 500,000. The next smallest dimension is $d_{(17,8)} = 600,875$.\n\n<<<50>>>"
