    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required to identify any PLL case.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n*   **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer):** This is the final step in the CFOP method of solving a Rubik's Cube. At this stage, all last-layer pieces are correctly oriented (i.e., all stickers on the top face are the same color), but they need to be permuted into their correct positions.\n*   **Goal:** To find the minimum number of side-sticker colors you need to see to uniquely identify which of the 21 PLL cases (plus the solved state) you have.\n*   **Non-top-facing stickers:** These are the stickers on the side faces of the last layer's four corner pieces and four edge pieces. There are 4 side colors in total.\n*   **\"Must be seen\":** This asks for the minimum number of stickers required to guarantee identification in all situations, distinguishing every case from every other case.\n\n### Step 2: Information Theory Lower Bound\nThere are 21 PLL cases and 1 solved state, making a total of 22 distinct states to identify.\n\n1.  To distinguish between 22 states, you need a certain amount of information. This can be calculated using logarithms: `log₂(22) ≈ 4.46 bits`.\n2.  Each non-top-facing sticker you observe can be one of four possible colors (e.g., Red, Orange, Blue, Green). The information provided by observing one sticker is `log₂(4) = 2 bits`.\n3.  To get the required `~4.46` bits of information, the theoretical minimum number of stickers is `ceil(4.46 / 2) = ceil(2.23) = 3`.\n\nSo, theoretically, it might be possible with 3 stickers. We must test if this is achievable in practice.\n\n### Step 3: Test if 3 Stickers are Sufficient\nLet's see if we can distinguish all 22 states by looking at just 3 stickers. A simple choice would be the three stickers on one face, for example, the Front face. These are:\n1.  The Front-facing sticker of the Up-Front-Left (UFL) corner.\n2.  The Front-facing sticker of the Up-Front (UF) edge.\n3.  The Front-facing sticker of the Up-Front-Right (UFR) corner.\n\nLet's test this with two very similar PLL cases: the **Aa-perm** and the **Ab-perm**. Both of these permutations only affect the corner pieces, leaving the edges solved.\n\n*   **Aa-perm:** Cycles three corners, leaving one corner fixed. In its standard orientation, the back-left corner (UBL) is fixed.\n*   **Ab-perm:** Also cycles three corners. In its standard orientation, the front-right corner (UFR) is fixed.\n\nLet's analyze the three stickers on the Front face for each case (assuming a standard color scheme where Front=Blue, Back=Green):\n*   **Edges:** Since edges are solved in both cases, the middle sticker (on the UF edge) will be the correct Front color (Blue) for both.\n*   **Aa-perm:** The UFR corner spot is now occupied by the UFL piece, which has a Blue sticker on its front face. The UFL corner spot is occupied by the UBR piece, which has a Green sticker on its side that now faces Front. The pattern is **(Green, Blue, Blue)**.\n*   **Ab-perm:** The UFR corner spot is solved. Its sticker is Blue. The UFL corner spot is occupied by the UBR piece, which (as in the Aa-perm) shows a Green sticker to the front. The pattern is **(Green, Blue, Blue)**.\n\nSince both the Aa-perm and Ab-perm can produce the exact same pattern on the three front-facing stickers, it is impossible to distinguish between them just by looking at these three stickers. Therefore, **3 stickers are not sufficient.**\n\n### Step 4: Test if 4 Stickers are Sufficient\nSince 3 stickers are not enough, the minimum must be at least 4. Let's find a set of 4 stickers and test if they are sufficient to distinguish difficult cases. A good set of stickers to check would provide information about multiple pieces on different sides. Consider this set:\n\n1.  Front-facing sticker of the Up-Front (UF) edge.\n2.  Right-facing sticker of the Up-Right (UR) edge.\n3.  Front-facing sticker of the Up-Front-Right (UFR) corner.\n4.  Right-facing sticker of the Up-Front-Right (UFR) corner.\n\nThis set of 4 stickers fully identifies which pieces are in the UF, UR, and UFR positions. Let's re-test the Aa-perm and Ab-perm with these 4 stickers.\n\n*   **Aa-perm (standard orientation):**\n    *   Edges are solved, so stickers 1 (UF) and 2 (UR) are correct.\n    *   The UFR corner position is occupied by the UFL piece. Let's say Front is Blue, Right is Red, and Left is Orange. The UFL piece has Blue and Orange side stickers. So sticker 3 will be Blue, and sticker 4 will be Orange.\n    *   Pattern: **(Correct, Correct, Correct_Front_Color, Different_Side_Color)**\n\n*   **Ab-perm (standard orientation):**\n    *   Edges are solved, so stickers 1 (UF) and 2 (UR) are correct.\n    *   The UFR corner position is solved. So sticker 3 will be the correct Front color, and sticker 4 will be the correct Right color.\n    *   Pattern: **(Correct, Correct, Correct_Front_Color, Correct_Right_Color)**\n\nThe patterns are different. The fourth sticker reveals the difference between the two cases. This 4-sticker set can also be shown to distinguish between other difficult pairs, like the four different G-permutations. The information from these four specific sticker locations is sufficient to create a unique \"signature\" for each of the 22 possible last-layer states.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the step-by-step analysis:\n1.  A minimum of 3 stickers is required based on information theory.\n2.  It was proven that 3 stickers are insufficient by finding a pair of PLLs (Aa and Ab) that cannot be distinguished.\n3.  A specific set of 4 stickers was shown to be sufficient to distinguish between difficult-to-recognize cases.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
