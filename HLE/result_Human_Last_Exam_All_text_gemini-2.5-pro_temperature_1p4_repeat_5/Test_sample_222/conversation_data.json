    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement\n\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n*   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nWe need to find the 8-point DFT of a new sequence, `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   The new 8-point sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the New Sequence `y(n)` to `x(n)` and `h(n)`\n\nThe sequence `y(n)` can be defined based on its even and odd indices:\n*   The even-indexed terms of `y(n)` are the terms from `x(n)`: `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The odd-indexed terms of `y(n)` are the terms from `h(n)`: `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n### Step 3: Derive the Formula for the 8-point DFT `Y(k)`\n\nLet `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. The definition of an N-point DFT is:\n`Y(k) = sum_{n=0}^{N-1} y(n) * W_N^(nk)`, where `W_N = e^(-j*2*pi/N)`.\n\nFor our case, N=8. We can split the summation into even and odd indices of `n`. Let `n = 2m` for even indices and `n = 2m+1` for odd indices.\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m) * W_8^(2mk) + sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nSubstitute `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)`:\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\nFactor out the term `W_8^k` from the second summation:\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + W_8^k * sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_8^(2mk)`\n\n### Step 4: Relate the Formula to the Given 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`\n\nWe use the property of the twiddle factor: `W_N^(2k) = W_(N/2)^k`. In our case, `W_8^(2mk) = W_4^(mk)`.\nSubstituting this back into the equation for `Y(k)`:\n`Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) + W_8^k * sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_4^(mk)`\n\nWe recognize that `sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(mk)` is the definition of the 4-point DFT of `x(m)`, which is `X(k)`. Similarly, the second sum is the 4-point DFT of `h(m)`, which is `H(k)`.\nSince `X(k)` and `H(k)` are 4-point DFTs, they are periodic with a period of 4. So `X(k) = X(k mod 4)` and `H(k) = H(k mod 4)`.\nThe final formula relating the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` is:\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\nThis is the fundamental equation for the Radix-2 Decimation-In-Time (DIT) FFT algorithm.\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Calculations\n\nWe will calculate `Y(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 7`.\nWe can use the \"butterfly\" property `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0,1,2,3` to simplify calculations.\n\n**Twiddle Factors `W_8^k`:**\n*   `W_8^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = e^(-j*pi/4) = (1-j)/sqrt(2)`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*pi/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = e^(-j*3*pi/4) = (-1-j)/sqrt(2)`\n\n**Calculation for k = 0, 1, 2, 3:**\n\n*   **For k=0:**\n    *   `Twiddle Product = W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 * 0 = 0`\n    *   `Y(0) = X(0) + 0 = 1`\n    *   `Y(4) = X(0) - 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k=1:**\n    *   `Twiddle Product = W_8^1 * H(1) = ((1-j)/sqrt(2)) * (1+j) = (1 - j^2) / sqrt(2) = 2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)`\n    *   `Y(1) = X(1) + sqrt(2) = j + sqrt(2)`\n    *   `Y(5) = X(1) - sqrt(2) = j - sqrt(2)`\n\n*   **For k=2:**\n    *   `Twiddle Product = W_8^2 * H(2) = (-j) * 1 = -j`\n    *   `Y(2) = X(2) + (-j) = -1 - j`\n    *   `Y(6) = X(2) - (-j) = -1 + j`\n\n*   **For k=3:**\n    *   `Twiddle Product = W_8^3 * H(3) = ((-1-j)/sqrt(2)) * (1-j) = (-1 + j - j + j^2) / sqrt(2) = -2 / sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)`\n    *   `Y(3) = X(3) + (-sqrt(2)) = -j - sqrt(2)`\n    *   `Y(7) = X(3) - (-sqrt(2)) = -j + sqrt(2)`\n\n### Step 6: Assemble the Final Answer\n\nCombining the results, the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is:\n*   `Y(0) = 1`\n*   `Y(1) = sqrt(2) + j`\n*   `Y(2) = -1 - j`\n*   `Y(3) = -sqrt(2) - j`\n*   `Y(4) = 1`\n*   `Y(5) = -sqrt(2) + j`\n*   `Y(6) = -1 + j`\n*   `Y(7) = sqrt(2) - j`\n\nSo, the final vector `Y(k)` is:\n`[1,  sqrt(2)+j,  -1-j,  -sqrt(2)-j,  1,  -sqrt(2)+j,  -1+j,  sqrt(2)-j]`\n\n<<<[1,  sqrt(2)+j,  -1-j,  -sqrt(2)-j,  1,  -sqrt(2)+j,  -1+j,  sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
