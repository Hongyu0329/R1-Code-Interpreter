    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of curve and its properties.**\nThe curve is a Lissajous curve. The parameters are a = 9 and b = 5.\nLet's analyze the symmetry of the curve:\n*   **Symmetry about the x-axis:**\n    x(-t) = cos(9(-t)) = cos(9t) = x(t)\n    y(-t) = sin(5(-t)) = -sin(5t) = -y(t)\n    Since (x(t), -y(t)) is on the curve whenever (x(t), y(t)) is, the curve is symmetric with respect to the x-axis.\n*   **Symmetry about the y-axis:**\n    x(π - t) = cos(9(π - t)) = cos(9π - 9t) = -cos(9t) = -x(t)\n    y(π - t) = sin(5(π - t)) = sin(5π - 5t) = sin(5t) = y(t)\n    Since (-x(t), y(t)) is on the curve whenever (x(t), y(t)) is, the curve is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.\n\nDue to these symmetries, the total number of self-intersection points can be found by summing the intersections on the axes and those within the four open quadrants. The intersections in the quadrants will appear in symmetric sets of four.\n\n**Step 2: Find the number of self-intersections on the axes.**\n\n**On the x-axis (y=0):**\nA point is on the x-axis if its y-coordinate is zero.\ny(t) = sin(5t) = 0  =>  5t = kπ  =>  t = kπ/5, for integer k.\nA self-intersection occurs if two different times, t1 and t2, give the same point (x, 0), where x ≠ 0.\nSo, we need t1 ≠ t2 such that y(t1) = y(t2) = 0 and x(t1) = x(t2).\nThe condition is cos(9t1) = cos(9t2).\nLet's find pairs of t values (t1, t2) in the curve's period [0, 2π) that satisfy these conditions.\nFrom y=0, we have t = {0, π/5, 2π/5, ..., 9π/5}.\nWe need to find pairs with the same x-value, x = cos(9t).\n*   t1=π/5 -> x1 = cos(9π/5) = cos(π/5)\n*   t2=2π/5 -> x2 = cos(18π/5) = cos(2π/5)\n*   t3=3π/5 -> x3 = cos(27π/5) = cos(3π/5) (negative)\n*   t4=4π/5 -> x4 = cos(36π/5) = cos(4π/5) (negative)\n*   t6=6π/5 -> x6 = cos(54π/5) = cos(4π/5) = x4\n*   t7=7π/5 -> x7 = cos(63π/5) = cos(3π/5) = x3\n*   t8=8π/5 -> x8 = cos(72π/5) = cos(2π/5) = x2\n*   t9=9π/5 -> x9 = cos(81π/5) = cos(π/5) = x1\nSo we have four pairs of times leading to four distinct self-intersection points on the x-axis:\n1.  t=π/5 and t=9π/5 give the point (cos(π/5), 0).\n2.  t=2π/5 and t=8π/5 give the point (cos(2π/5), 0).\n3.  t=3π/5 and t=7π/5 give the point (cos(3π/5), 0).\n4.  t=4π/5 and t=6π/5 give the point (cos(4π/5), 0).\nThere are **4** self-intersection points on the x-axis.\n\n**On the y-axis (x=0):**\nA point is on the y-axis if its x-coordinate is zero.\nx(t) = cos(9t) = 0  =>  9t = kπ + π/2  =>  t = (2k+1)π/18, for integer k.\nA self-intersection occurs if t1 ≠ t2 such that x(t1) = x(t2) = 0 and y(t1) = y(t2).\nThe condition is sin(5t1) = sin(5t2). This means 5t2 = 5t1 + 2mπ or 5t2 = π - 5t1 + 2mπ. The first case is trivial. The second case leads to intersections.\n5(t1+t2) = (2m+1)π.\nWe also know t1 = (2k1+1)π/18 and t2 = (2k2+1)π/18.\nSubstituting these in gives: 5/18 * (2k1+1 + 2k2+1)π = (2m+1)π\n10(k1+k2+1) = 18(2m+1) => 5(k1+k2+1) = 9(2m+1).\nSince 5 and 9 are coprime, k1+k2+1 must be a multiple of 9.\nWithin the interval t in [0, 2π), k runs from 0 to 17.\nLet k1+k2+1 = 9 => k1+k2=8. The pairs {k1,k2} are {0,8}, {1,7}, {2,6}, {3,5}.\nLet's check the y-values for these pairs:\n1.  k1=0, k2=8 -> t1=π/18, t2=17π/18. y=sin(5π/18). This gives one point.\n2.  k1=1, k2=7 -> t1=3π/18=π/6, t2=15π/18=5π/6. y=sin(5π/6)=1/2. This gives another point.\n3.  k1=2, k2=6 -> t1=5π/18, t2=13π/18. y=sin(25π/18)=-sin(7π/18). This gives a third point.\n4.  k1=3, k2=5 -> t1=7π/18, t2=11π/18. y=sin(35π/18)=-sin(π/18). This gives a fourth point.\nAnother possibility is k1+k2+1 = 27 (the next multiple of 9), which gives k1+k2=26. The pairs are {9,17}, {10,16}, {11,15}, {12,14}. These lead to the same four y-values.\nSo, there are a total of **4** self-intersection points on the y-axis.\n\nTotal intersections on axes = 4 + 4 = **8**.\n\n**Step 3: Find the number of self-intersections in the quadrants.**\nFor Lissajous curves of the form x=cos(at), y=sin(bt) where a and b are coprime odd integers greater than 1, a known formula gives the number of self-intersections that do not lie on the coordinate axes. This is the number of intersections in the open quadrants.\nThe formula is: N_quadrants = (a-1)(b-1)/2.\nFor our curve, a=9 and b=5.\nN_quadrants = (9-1)(5-1)/2 = (8)(4)/2 = 32/2 = **16**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of self-intersection points.**\nThe total number of self-intersection points is the sum of the intersections on the axes and the intersections within the quadrants.\nTotal Intersections = N_axes + N_quadrants\nTotal Intersections = 8 + 16 = 24."
