    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron ($\\Delta p$) to its actual momentum ($p$) in the first Bohr orbit. We need to calculate the value of $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n\n**2. Identify Given Information and Necessary Constants**\n*   **System:** An electron in the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$).\n*   **Given Uncertainty in Position ($\\Delta x$):** $10 \\text{ pm}$.\n*   **Necessary Physical Constants:**\n    *   Radius of the first Bohr orbit ($r_1$ or $a_0$): $a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n    *   Reduced Planck's Constant ($\\hbar$): $\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ JÂ·s}$. This constant will appear in the formulas, but we will see it can be cancelled out.\n\n**3. List Careful Points and Key Formulas**\n*   **Unit Conversion:** The uncertainty in position is given in picometers (pm). We must convert it to the standard SI unit, meters (m).\n    *   $1 \\text{ pm} = 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$\n    *   Therefore, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$.\n*   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle connects the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$). The relationship is given by:\n    *   $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    *   For this problem, we will assume the minimum possible uncertainty, so we use the equality: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n    *   From this, we can express the uncertainty in momentum as: $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n*   **Momentum in the Bohr Model:** The Bohr model quantizes the angular momentum of an electron in an orbit: $L = mvr = n\\hbar$.\n    *   The linear momentum is $p = mv$.\n    *   Substituting $p$ into the angular momentum equation gives $pr = n\\hbar$.\n    *   For the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$, so the momentum ($p$) is: $p = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\hbar}{r_1} = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$.\n\n**4. Derive the Ratio and Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Step 1: Formulate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.**\n    *   We have the expression for $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n    *   We have the expression for $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$.\n    *   Now, we can write the ratio:\n        $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}\\right)}$\n\n*   **Step 2: Simplify the expression.**\n    *   We can cancel the reduced Planck's constant ($\\hbar$) from the numerator and the denominator. This simplifies the calculation significantly and removes dependency on the exact value of $\\hbar$.\n        $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{1 / (2 \\Delta x)}{1 / r_1} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n*   **Step 3: Substitute the known values and compute the result.**\n    *   Radius of the first Bohr orbit, $r_1 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n    *   Uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$.\n    *   Now, substitute these into the simplified ratio formula:\n        $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m})}$\n        $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11}}{20 \\times 10^{-12}}$\n        $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29}{2} = 2.645$\n\nThe ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum is 2.645. This result, being greater than 1, shows that the uncertainty in the electron's momentum is much larger than the momentum itself, highlighting the incompatibility of the classical Bohr orbit picture with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
