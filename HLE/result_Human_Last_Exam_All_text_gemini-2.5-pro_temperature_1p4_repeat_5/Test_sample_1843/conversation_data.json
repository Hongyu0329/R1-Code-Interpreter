    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036$\n$N = 4 \\times 9009$\n$N = 2^2 \\times 9 \\times 1001$\n$N = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 143$\n$N = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$\n\n### Step 2: Decomposition of Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely written as a product of primitive characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet $\\chi$ be a primitive character of conductor $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\nThen $\\chi$ can be decomposed as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive Dirichlet character modulo $p^a$.\n\n### Step 3: Condition on the Order of the Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. Let $o_{p^a} = \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^a})$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6$.\n\nFor the lcm to be 6, two conditions must be met for the tuple of orders $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$:\n1.  Every order $o_{p^a}$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders must contain a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 4: Count Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power Factor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters of various orders for each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$. Let $P(m, d)$ denote the number of primitive characters modulo $m$ of order $d$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):**\n    The group of characters mod 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. It has one primitive character, and its order is 2.\n    $P(4, 2) = 1$. The only possible primitive order is 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):**\n    The group of characters mod 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character mod 9 is primitive if its order is divisible by 3. The possible orders for elements in $C_6$ are 1, 2, 3, 6. So primitive characters must have order 3 or 6.\n    The number of elements of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ is $\\phi(d)$ if $d|n$.\n    $P(9, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    $P(9, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7:**\n    The group of characters mod 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. Their orders can be 2, 3, or 6.\n    $P(7, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    $P(7, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    $P(7, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11:**\n    The group of characters mod 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. Primitive characters can have orders 2, 5, or 10.\n    $P(11, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    $P(11, 5) = \\phi(5) = 4$.\n    $P(11, 10) = \\phi(10) = 4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13:**\n    The group of characters mod 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. Primitive characters can have orders 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12.\n    $P(13, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    $P(13, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    $P(13, 4) = \\phi(4) = 2$.\n    $P(13, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    $P(13, 12) = \\phi(12) = 4$.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Results\nWe need to count the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), ..., \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\nFirst, let's filter the possible characters for each component based on the condition that their order must divide 6.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_4$**: The only primitive order is 2, which divides 6. So, we have $P(4, 2) = 1$ choice.\n*   **For $\\chi_9$**: Primitive orders are 3 and 6, both divide 6. So, we have $P(9, 3) + P(9, 6) = 2 + 2 = 4$ choices.\n*   **For $\\chi_7$**: Primitive orders are 2, 3, and 6, which all divide 6. So, we have $P(7, 2) + P(7, 3) + P(7, 6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ choices.\n*   **For $\\chi_{11}$**: Primitive orders are 2, 5, 10. Only order 2 divides 6. So, we have $P(11, 2) = 1$ choice.\n*   **For $\\chi_{13}$**: Primitive orders are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Orders 2, 3, and 6 divide 6. So, we have $P(13, 2) + P(13, 3) + P(13, 6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ choices.\n\nNow, we check if the lcm is guaranteed to be 6 for any combination of these selected characters.\nLet the chosen characters have orders $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\n*   Any choice for $\\chi_4$ must have $o_4=2$. Therefore, $\\text{lcm}(...)$ is guaranteed to be a multiple of 2.\n*   Any choice for $\\chi_9$ must have $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. Both are multiples of 3. Therefore, $\\text{lcm}(...)$ is guaranteed to be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm of the orders must be a multiple of 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$.\nWe also know that we have only selected component characters whose orders divide 6.\nIf a number is a multiple of 6 and also a divisor of 6, it must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, every possible combination of choices results in a character of order 6. We just need to multiply the number of choices for each component.\n\nTotal number of characters = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal number = $100$"
