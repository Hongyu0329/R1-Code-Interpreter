    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes in a graph with 128 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's clarify the key terms used in the question:\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** A graph $G=(V, E)$ where the number of vertices is $|V|=128$.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices $S \\subseteq V$ is a clique if for every two distinct vertices $u, v \\in S$, the edge $(u, v)$ is in $E$. The size of the clique is $|S|$. A clique of size $k$ is often denoted as $K_k$.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices $S \\subseteq V$, the induced subgraph $G[S]$ is the graph whose vertex set is $S$ and whose edge set consists of all edges in $E$ that have both endpoints in $S$.\n*   **Clique as an Induced Subgraph:** The statement \"a clique of size $k$ appears as an induced subgraph\" means that there exists a set of vertices $S$ with $|S|=k$ such that the induced subgraph $G[S]$ is a complete graph ($K_k$). This is equivalent to the standard definition of a clique. If $S$ is a clique, every pair of its vertices is connected, so the induced subgraph $G[S]$ contains all possible edges and is thus a $K_k$. Conversely, if $G[S]$ is a $K_k$, then all pairs of vertices in $S$ are connected in $G$, so $S$ is a clique.\n*   **Number of different clique sizes:** This is the cardinality of the set of integers $k$ for which the graph $G$ contains at least one clique of size $k$.\n\n### Step 2: Rephrasing the Problem\n\nLet $G$ be a graph on $n=128$ vertices. Let $\\mathcal{K}(G)$ be the set of all integers $k$ such that $G$ contains a clique of size $k$. The question asks for the maximum possible value of $|\\mathcal{K}(G)|$ over all possible graphs $G$ with 128 vertices.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Set of Clique Sizes for an Arbitrary Graph\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the set $\\mathcal{K}(G)$ for any given graph $G$.\n\nLet $\\omega(G)$ be the clique number of $G$, which is the size of the largest clique in $G$.\n\n**Claim:** For any graph $G$, the set of clique sizes is $\\mathcal{K}(G) = \\{1, 2, \\dots, \\omega(G)\\}$.\n\n**Proof of the Claim:**\n\n1.  By the definition of $\\omega(G)$, there exists a clique in $G$ of size $\\omega(G)$. Let's call this clique $C_{max}$. So, $\\omega(G) \\in \\mathcal{K}(G)$.\n2.  Also by definition, there cannot be a clique of size greater than $\\omega(G)$. So, if $k > \\omega(G)$, then $k \\notin \\mathcal{K}(G)$.\n3.  Now, consider any integer $k$ such that $1 \\le k \\le \\omega(G)$. We need to show that $k \\in \\mathcal{K}(G)$.\n4.  Since we have a maximum clique $C_{max}$ of size $\\omega(G)$, we can choose any subset $S$ of $C_{max}$ with size $|S| = k$.\n5.  Since $C_{max}$ is a clique, every pair of distinct vertices in $C_{max}$ is connected by an edge.\n6.  Because $S$ is a subset of $C_{max}$, every pair of distinct vertices in $S$ must also be connected by an edge.\n7.  Therefore, $S$ is a clique of size $k$. This means $k \\in \\mathcal{K}(G)$.\n8.  Combining these points, we have shown that for any integer $k$, $k \\in \\mathcal{K}(G)$ if and only if $1 \\le k \\le \\omega(G)$. (A clique of size 1, a single vertex, always exists in a non-empty graph).\n9.  Thus, the set of all possible clique sizes in $G$ is precisely $\\{1, 2, \\dots, \\omega(G)\\}$.\n\nFrom this, the number of different clique sizes is $|\\mathcal{K}(G)| = |\\{1, 2, \\dots, \\omega(G)\\}| = \\omega(G)$.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Maximum Number of Clique Sizes\n\nThe problem has now been reduced to finding the maximum possible value of $\\omega(G)$ for a graph $G$ with $n=128$ vertices.\n\n1.  **Upper Bound:** For any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, a clique is a subset of the vertex set $V$. Therefore, the size of any clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices. This means $\\omega(G) \\le n$. For our case, $n=128$, so $\\omega(G) \\le 128$.\n    This implies that the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n\n2.  **Achievability:** To show that 128 is the maximum possible number, we need to construct a specific graph $G$ on 128 vertices that achieves this upper bound. That is, we need to find a graph $G$ with $\\omega(G) = 128$.\n\n    Consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted $K_{128}$. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    The entire vertex set $V$ of $K_{128}$ forms a clique.\n    The size of this clique is $|V| = 128$.\n    Therefore, the clique number of $K_{128}$ is $\\omega(K_{128}) = 128$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nWe have established the following:\n\n*   The number of different clique sizes in any graph $G$ is equal to its clique number, $\\omega(G)$.\n*   For any graph $G$ on $n=128$ vertices, the clique number $\\omega(G)$ is at most 128.\n*   The complete graph $K_{128}$ is a graph on 128 vertices and has a clique number of 128.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on 128 vertices is 128. This is achieved by the complete graph $K_{128}$, which contains induced cliques of every size from 1 to 128."
