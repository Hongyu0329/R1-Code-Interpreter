    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula and the Question**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables. The result is an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$.\n\n$Z = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\n\nHere, $Z_n(X, Y)$ is the sum of all terms of total degree $n$. A term's degree is the total count of $X$'s and $Y$'s within it. For example, $\\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$ is of degree 2.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *nonzero coefficients* for the terms of order (degree) 10, i.e., in $Z_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate BCH Terms to the Free Lie Algebra**\n\nThe terms in the BCH expansion are elements of a mathematical structure called the **Free Lie Algebra** generated by $X$ and $Y$, denoted as $L(X, Y)$. A Lie algebra is defined by the properties of its bracket operation (bilinearity, anti-commutativity $[A,A]=0$, and the Jacobi identity $[A,[B,C]] + [B,[C,A]] + [C,[A,B]]=0$).\n\nThe space $L(X, Y)$ is graded by degree, meaning it can be broken down into subspaces of homogeneous terms of a specific degree $n$:\n\n$L(X, Y) = \\bigoplus_{n=1}^{\\infty} L_n(X, Y)$\n\nEach subspace $L_n(X, Y)$ is a vector space. The number of linearly independent commutators of degree $n$ is the dimension of this vector space, $\\dim(L_n(X, Y))$.\n\n**Step 3: Handle the \"Nonzero Coefficients\" Condition**\n\nA crucial point is whether any of the coefficients for the linearly independent terms might happen to be zero. For the specific expansion of $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$, it is a known mathematical result that if the terms are expressed in a standard basis of the free Lie algebra (such as a Hall basis or Lyndon basis), all the corresponding coefficients are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the problem of counting the number of nonzero coefficients is equivalent to finding the number of linearly independent commutator terms of degree 10. This is simply the dimension of the vector space $L_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\n**Step 4: Use Witt's Formula to Calculate the Dimension**\n\nThe dimension of the $n$-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on $k$ generators is given by **Witt's Formula**:\n\n$\\dim(L_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\n*   $n$ is the degree, which is 10 in our case.\n*   $k$ is the number of generators, which is 2 (namely, $X$ and $Y$).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the **Möbius function**.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Witt's Formula for n=10 and k=2**\n\n1.  **Identify the divisors of n=10:**\n    The divisors are $d = 1, 2, 5, 10$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$ (by definition).\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is prime, an odd number of prime factors).\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is prime, an odd number of prime factors).\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 is square-free with an even number of prime factors).\n\n3.  **Calculate the term $k^{n/d} = 2^{10/d}$ for each divisor:**\n    *   For $d=1$: $2^{10/1} = 2^{10} = 1024$.\n    *   For $d=2$: $2^{10/2} = 2^5 = 32$.\n    *   For $d=5$: $2^{10/5} = 2^2 = 4$.\n    *   For $d=10$: $2^{10/10} = 2^1 = 2$.\n\n4.  **Substitute these values into Witt's formula:**\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [ \\mu(1)2^{10/1} + \\mu(2)2^{10/2} + \\mu(5)2^{10/5} + \\mu(10)2^{10/10} ]$\n    $\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [ (1)(1024) + (-1)(32) + (-1)(4) + (1)(2) ]$\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nNow, we perform the arithmetic:\n\n$\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [ 1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 ]$\n$\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [ 988 + 2 ]$\n$\\dim(L_{10}) = \\frac{1}{10} [ 990 ]$\n$\\dim(L_{10}) = 99$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is equal to the dimension of the 10th-degree component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, which is 99.\n\n### Careful Points Checklist\n\n*   **Correct interpretation of the question:** Understood that \"number of nonzero coefficients\" refers to the number of basis elements of the Lie algebra that appear with a non-zero weight in the BCH series.\n*   **Correct mathematical tool:** Identified Witt's formula as the direct method to compute the dimension of the relevant space.\n*   **Correct parameters for Witt's formula:** Used $n=10$ for the order and $k=2$ for the number of generators.\n*   **Correct divisors of n:** All divisors of 10 (1, 2, 5, 10) were included.\n*   **Correct calculation of the Möbius function:** Values for $\\mu(1), \\mu(2), \\mu(5), \\mu(10)$ are correct.\n*   **Accuracy in arithmetic:** The calculation was performed step-by-step to minimize errors.\n\nThe analysis is complete and robust.\n\n<<<99>>>"
