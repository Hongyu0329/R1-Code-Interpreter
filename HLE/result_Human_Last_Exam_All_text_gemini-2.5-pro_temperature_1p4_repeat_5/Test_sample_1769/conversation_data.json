    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the current word and its origin:**\n    The modern English word is \"sister\". Its etymology is a key starting point. The word \"sister\" as we spell and pronounce it today comes from Old English, but its form was heavily influenced by the Old Norse word *systir*. Both the Old English and Old Norse words descend from a common ancestor, Proto-Germanic *\\*swestēr*.\n\n2.  **Examine the native Old English word:**\n    The original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word for \"sister\" was *sweostor*. In a history without Norse influence, this is the word that would have evolved into a modern form.\n\n3.  **Trace the likely evolution of *sweostor* without Norse influence:**\n    To understand how *sweostor* would have changed, we can look at how other similar Old English words evolved.\n    *   **Vowel Change:** The \"eo\" diphthong in *sw**eo**stor* is crucial. In many cases, the Old English \"eo\" sound evolved into an \"e\" or \"u\" sound in Middle English. For instance, in Southern and Western dialects of Middle English (areas with less Norse influence), *sweostor* became *suster*. This change is similar to how the Dutch cognate evolved into *zuster*.\n    *   **Comparison with similar words:** We can compare *sweostor* to other family-related words that were not replaced by Norse borrowings:\n        *   Old English *brōþor* -> Middle English *brother* -> Modern English *brother*\n        *   Old English *mōdor* -> Middle English *moder* -> Modern English *mother*\n    *   **The case of *suster***: The form *suster* was quite common in Middle English texts, especially in dialects that were less exposed to Old Norse. For example, it is found frequently in the writings of John Wycliffe. Without the influence of Old Norse *systir* from the Danelaw region, it is very probable that *suster* would have become the standard form across England.\n\n4.  **Project the Middle English form into Modern English:**\n    If *suster* had become the standard Middle English word, we can project its development into Modern English.\n    *   **The \"u\" sound:** The short \"u\" in Middle English *suster* (pronounced like the \"u\" in \"put\") would have most likely undergone the \"Strut-Split\", changing to the /ʌ/ vowel sound (like the \"u\" in \"strut\" or \"cut\"). This is the same change seen in other words:\n        *   Middle English *sone* -> Modern English *son*\n        *   Middle English *come* -> Modern English *come*\n    *   **Spelling:** English spelling often preserves older forms. Therefore, the word would likely still be spelled *suster*.\n\n5.  **Conclusion of the analysis:**\n    The current word \"sister\" owes its modern \"-i-\" vowel and \"-er\" spelling to the influence of Old Norse *systir* replacing the native development. Without this Norse interaction, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have naturally evolved, most likely into the Middle English form *suster*. This form would then have developed into the Modern English word *suster*, pronounced to rhyme with \"muster\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Dialectal Variation:** Middle English had significant dialectal differences. The form *sister* became dominant because the London dialect, which became the basis for standard English, adopted many features from the Norse-influenced East Midlands dialects. In our alternate timeline, a Southern or West Midland form like *suster* would have had a much higher chance of becoming standard.\n*   **Cognate vs. Borrowing:** \"Sister\" is a unique case where a word wasn't so much borrowed as it was *replaced* by a very similar-sounding cognate from a related language. This is a subtle but important distinction. The core meaning and Germanic root were the same, but the specific phonological form was imported.\n*   **Unpredictability of Language:** While this is a linguistically sound projection, language evolution can be unpredictable. However, based on the available evidence and known patterns of sound change, *suster* is by far the most likely candidate.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be the direct descendant of the native Old English word *sweostor*.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
