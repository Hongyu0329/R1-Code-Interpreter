    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the manifold and the fundamental group**\nLet $T$ be the trefoil knot in $S^3$.\nLet $K = \\tau_5(T)$ be the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil. This is a 2-sphere embedded in $S^4$ (a 2-knot).\nLet $M$ be the double branched cover of $S^4$ branched over $K$. $M$ is a 4-manifold.\nWe want to find the minimal number of generators of its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(M)$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate $\\pi_1(M)$ to the knot group of $K$**\nA standard result in the theory of branched covers states that the fundamental group of an $n$-fold branched cover of $S^d$ over a submanifold $L$ can be calculated from the fundamental group of the complement, $\\pi_1(S^d \\setminus L)$.\nFor a double branched cover ($n=2$), the formula is:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K) / \\langle\\langle \\mu^2 \\rangle\\rangle$\nwhere $\\mu$ is a meridian of the knot $K$ and $\\langle\\langle \\mu^2 \\rangle\\rangle$ denotes the normal closure of the element $\\mu^2$.\n\n**Step 3: Find a presentation for the 2-knot group $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)$**\nLet $G_K = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)$. We need a presentation for this group. The group of a twist-spun knot can be related to the group of the original knot in $S^3$.\nLet $G_T = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus T)$ be the group of the trefoil knot. A standard presentation for $G_T$ is the braid group on 3 strands:\n$G_T = \\langle a, b \\mid aba = bab \\rangle$.\nThe generators $a$ and $b$ correspond to meridians of the trefoil knot. Let's choose $\\mu = a$ as our primary meridian.\n\nThere are several (and sometimes conflicting) presentations for the group of a twist-spun knot in the literature. A reliable one, found in several modern sources (e.g., Lomonaco, Gonzalez-AcuÃ±a), gives the group of the $m$-twist-spun knot of $K_0$ as:\n$G_{\\tau_m(K_0)} = \\langle G_{K_0}, \\sigma \\mid [\\sigma, \\mu] = 1, \\sigma^m = [\\lambda, \\mu] \\rangle$\nwhere $\\mu$ is a meridian and $\\lambda$ is a corresponding longitude of $K_0$.\n\nFor our case, $m=5$, $K_0=T$, $G_{K_0}=G_T=\\langle a,b \\mid aba=bab \\rangle$, $\\mu=a$. A standard longitude for the trefoil knot is $\\lambda = (ab)^3 a^{-6}$. This is an element in the commutator subgroup of $G_T$.\nSo, the group of the 5-twist-spun trefoil is:\n$G_K = \\langle a, b, \\sigma \\mid aba = bab, [\\sigma, a] = 1, \\sigma^5 = [(ab)^3 a^{-6}, a] \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate $\\pi_1(M)$ by taking the quotient**\nWe now compute $\\pi_1(M) = G_K / \\langle\\langle a^2 \\rangle\\rangle$. We add the relation $a^2=1$ to the presentation of $G_K$.\nLet's analyze the effect of adding $a^2=1$ to the relations.\n1.  The subgroup generated by $a$ and $b$ has relations $\\langle a,b \\mid aba=bab, a^2=1 \\rangle$. This is a known presentation for the symmetric group $S_3$. A key consequence is that $b$ is conjugate to $a$ (via $b = (ab)a(ab)^{-1}$), so $b^2=1$ as well.\n2.  Now we evaluate the relation for $\\sigma$. We need to compute the element $[\\lambda, a] = \\lambda a \\lambda^{-1} a^{-1}$ in the group $S_3$.\n    In $S_3$, let's represent $a$ by the transposition $(1,2)$ and $b$ by $(2,3)$. We check $a^2=(1,2)^2 = id$ and $aba=(1,2)(2,3)(1,2)=(1,3)$, $bab=(2,3)(1,2)(2,3)=(1,3)$. The relations hold.\n    The longitude is $\\lambda = (ab)^3 a^{-6}$.\n    $a^{-6} = (a^2)^{-3} = (id)^{-3} = id$.\n    $ab = (1,2)(2,3)=(1,3,2)$, which is a 3-cycle.\n    $(ab)^3 = (1,3,2)^3 = id$.\n    So, in $S_3$, the longitude $\\lambda$ becomes the identity element.\n3.  Therefore, $[\\lambda, a] = [id, a] = id$.\n4.  The relation for $\\sigma$ simplifies to $\\sigma^5 = 1$.\n\nSo, the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ has the presentation:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\langle a, b, \\sigma \\mid (a,b \\text{ generate } S_3), [\\sigma, a] = 1, \\sigma^5 = 1 \\rangle$.\nThe relations for $S_3$ are $a^2=1, b^2=1, (ab)^3=1$. So, we have:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\langle a, b, \\sigma \\mid a^2=1, b^2=1, (ab)^3=1, \\sigma a = a \\sigma, \\sigma^5 = 1 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the minimal number of generators**\nLet $\\Pi = \\pi_1(M)$.\nFirst, we find the minimal number of generators for the abelianization, $\\Pi^{ab} = H_1(M; \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe relations in the abelian group (using additive notation) are:\n$2\\bar{a}=0, 2\\bar{b}=0, 3(\\bar{a}+\\bar{b})=0, \\bar{\\sigma}+\\bar{a}=\\bar{a}+\\bar{\\sigma}$ (trivial), $5\\bar{\\sigma}=0$.\nFrom $2\\bar{a}=0$ and $2\\bar{b}=0$, the relation $3\\bar{a}+3\\bar{b}=0$ becomes $\\bar{a}+\\bar{b}=0$, or $\\bar{b}=-\\bar{a}=\\bar{a}$.\nSo the abelianization is generated by $\\bar{a}$ and $\\bar{\\sigma}$ with relations $2\\bar{a}=0$ and $5\\bar{\\sigma}=0$.\n$\\Pi^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{10}$.\nThe minimal number of generators for a cyclic group like $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ is 1.\nSo, the minimal number of generators for $\\Pi$, denoted $d(\\Pi)$, must be at least 1, i.e., $d(\\Pi) \\ge 1$.\n\nNext, we check if $\\Pi$ is cyclic. A group is cyclic if and only if it is generated by one element. All cyclic groups are abelian. However, $\\Pi$ is not abelian since $a$ and $b$ do not commute in $S_3$ (i.e., $ab \\neq ba$). Therefore, $\\Pi$ is not cyclic, and $d(\\Pi) > 1$.\n\nNow, we search for a small generating set for $\\Pi$. The presentation involves three generators: $a, b, \\sigma$. Let's see if we can do better.\nConsider the subgroup generated by $a$ and $\\sigma$. Since they commute and have coprime orders (2 and 5), this subgroup is cyclic: $\\langle a, \\sigma \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{10}$. Let $g = a\\sigma$. The element $g$ generates this subgroup, since $g^5 = (a\\sigma)^5 = a^5\\sigma^5 = (a^2)^2 a \\cdot 1 = a$ and $g^6 = a\\sigma g^5 = a\\sigma a = a^2\\sigma = \\sigma$. So, $a=g^5$ and $\\sigma=g^6$.\nThe entire group $\\Pi$ is generated by $\\{a,b,\\sigma\\}$, which is equivalent to being generated by $\\{g, b\\}$.\nThe relations for $\\Pi$ can be rewritten in terms of $g$ and $b$:\n1.  $g^{10}=1$ (captures $a^2=1, \\sigma^5=1, [a,\\sigma]=1$)\n2.  $b^2=1$\n3.  $(ab)^3=1$ becomes $(g^5 b)^3 = 1$.\nSo we have a new presentation for $\\Pi$ with only two generators:\n$\\Pi = \\langle g, b \\mid g^{10}=1, b^2=1, (g^5 b)^3=1 \\rangle$.\nThis shows that the group can be generated by 2 elements, so $d(\\Pi) \\le 2$.\n\nCombining our findings:\n- $d(\\Pi) > 1$\n- $d(\\Pi) \\le 2$\n\nWe conclude that the minimal number of generators is 2."
