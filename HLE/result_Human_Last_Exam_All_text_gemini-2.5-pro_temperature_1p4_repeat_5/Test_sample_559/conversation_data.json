    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the System:**\n    We are given a system of two first-order autonomous differential equations:\n    $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n    $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n    We analyze the system in the $(u, d)$ phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n2.  **Find Equilibrium Points:**\n    Equilibrium points are points $(u, d)$ where $u'(t)=0$ and $d'(t)=0$.\n    From $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n    *   If $u=0$: Substitute into the $d'$ equation:\n        $2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2=0 \\implies d=0$.\n        So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\n    *   If $u=1$: Substitute into the $d'$ equation:\n        $2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$.\n        This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n        So, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\n    The equilibrium points for $u \\geq 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Classify the Equilibrium Points using Linearization:**\n    We compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Let $f(u,d) = u^3-u^2$ and $g(u,d) = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3+u^4$.\n    $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} = 3u^2-2u$\n    $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} = 0$\n    $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} = (10u-3)d - 3u^2+4u^3$\n    $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} = 4d + 5u^2-3u$\n    $J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d-3u^2+4u^3 & 4d+5u^2-3u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    *   At $(1, 0)$: $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (source).\n    *   At $(1, -1)$: $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. Since they have opposite signs, $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n    *   At $(0, 0)$: $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive. This is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium.\n\n4.  **Identify Separatrices:**\n    Separatrices are trajectories that separate regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are always separatrices. We focus on the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n\n    *   **Stable Manifold of (1, -1):** The eigenvector for the negative eigenvalue $\\lambda_2=-2$ is found by solving $(J - (-2)I)v = 0$:\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies 3v_u=0 \\implies v_u=0$.\n        The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This means the stable manifold is tangent to the vertical line $u=1$ at the saddle point. In fact, setting $u=1$ in the original system gives $u'=0$, so the line $u=1$ is an invariant manifold. Trajectories on this line approach $(1, -1)$ for $d \\in (-1,0)$, making the line segment $u=1, -1 < d < 0$ part of the stable manifold.\n\n    *   **Unstable Manifold of (1, -1):** The eigenvector for the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$ is found by solving $(J - I)v = 0$:\n        $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = 0 \\implies -6v_u-3v_d=0 \\implies v_d=-2v_u$.\n        The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The unstable manifold is a curve that passes through $(1, -1)$ and is tangent to the line with slope $-2$.\n\n5.  **Find the Equation of the Unstable Manifold:**\n    We look for an invariant curve (a trajectory) of the form $d=p(u)$ where $p(u)$ is a polynomial. This requires $\\frac{dp}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$. Let's try $d=-u^2$.\n    This curve passes through $(0,0)$ and $(1, -1)$.\n    The slope of this curve is $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2$, which matches the direction of the unstable manifold at the saddle point. This suggests $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold.\n    Let's verify if $d=-u^2$ is a solution to the differential equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2+(5u^2-3u)d-u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$.\n    LHS: $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$.\n    RHS: Substitute $d=-u^2$:\n    Numerator = $2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n    $= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n    $= -2u^4 + 2u^3 = -2u^3(u-1)$.\n    Denominator = $u^2(u-1)$.\n    RHS = $\\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u$.\n    Since LHS = RHS, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold. As it passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$ and is tangent to the unstable eigenvector, it is the unstable manifold.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    A separatrix is a trajectory that defines a boundary between different types of long-term behavior. The unstable manifold of a saddle point is a classic example of a separatrix. In this system, we have identified the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$ as the curve $d = -u^2$. This curve is a non-trivial separatrix of the system. While other curves like $u=1$ and $d=u-u^2$ also act as separatrices, the unstable manifold of the unique saddle point is often considered \"the\" principal separatrix."
