    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet & Act:** *Don Quixote*, Act I variation\n*   **Character:** Kitri\n*   **Specific Step:** single-turn pirouette en dehors\n*   **Starting Position:** from the fifth position\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Specific Performance and Choreography**\nThe question refers to a 2008 performance. While specific recordings from that exact year can be hard to isolate, Natalia Osipova's performances of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi during that period (including the widely distributed 2011 HD broadcast) are well-documented and feature consistent choreography by Marius Petipa and Alexander Gorsky. We will analyze the standard choreography for Kitri's Act I variation that she performed.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Act I Variation**\nKitri's entrance variation in Act I is famous for its vibrant character, use of a fan, high jumps, and sharp, quick footwork. It is one of the most iconic solos in classical ballet.\n\n**Step 4: Carefully Scrutinize the Turning Sequences**\nWe must look for the exact step specified: a single-turn pirouette en dehors starting from the fifth position.\n*   A **pirouette from fifth** involves the dancer starting with feet in the fifth position, doing a *plié* (bending the knees), and then pushing off into a *relevé* on one leg (in *passé*) to execute the turn.\n*   The most famous turning sequence in this specific variation is a diagonal of **piqué turns**. A piqué turn is fundamentally different. It involves the dancer stepping directly onto a straight leg on pointe (or demi-pointe) to execute a turn, with the other foot in a coupé or passé position. It does not start from a two-footed fifth position plié.\n*   The variation also often concludes with **chaîné turns**, which are a series of rapid half-turns performed in a line or circle. These are also not pirouettes from the fifth position.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nAfter a detailed analysis of the standard and performed choreography of Kitri's Act I variation, it is clear that this solo does not contain any single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position. The character's bravura is demonstrated through other types of turns (primarily piqués) and powerful jumps. Therefore, the number of such pirouettes performed by Osipova is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
