    "This question requires scanning a line of Latin poetry from Plautus. The meter is a **Trochaic Septenarius**, a common meter in Roman comedy.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Meter**\nA Trochaic Septenarius consists of seven trochaic feet (a trochee is a long syllable followed by a short syllable: L S), followed by a final, single syllable. This is called a \"catalectic\" line because the last foot is incomplete.\nThe basic pattern is:\nL S | L S | L S | L S || L S | L S | L x\n(The 'x' represents a final syllable, which can be long or short, called *syllaba anceps*. The double pipe || indicates the typical position of the main pause, or *caesura*).\nIn Plautine meter, substitutions are very common. A trochee (L S) can be \"resolved\" into a tribrach (S S S). A trochee can also be replaced by a spondee (L L), which can in turn be resolved into a dactyl (L S S) or an anapest (S S L).\n\n**Step 2: Syllabification and Quantity Analysis**\nWe must determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable in the line:\n`et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n\n*   **et**: The vowel 'e' is short, but it is followed by two consonants ('t' from *et* and 't' from *tibi*). This makes the syllable long by position. -> **L**\n*   **ti-bi**: Both syllables contain short vowels. -> **S S**\n*   **be-ne**: Both syllables contain short vowels. -> **S S**\n*   **es-se**: The first syllable 'es' has a short vowel but is followed by two 's' consonants ('ss'). This makes it long by position. The second syllable 'se' is short. -> **L S**\n*   **so-li**: From the word *sōlus*, the 'o' is long by nature. The final 'i' is short. -> **L S**\n*   **quom**: An old spelling of *cum*. The vowel 'o' is short but is followed by two consonants ('m' from *quom* and 's' from *sibi*). This makes the syllable long by position. -> **L**\n*   **si-bi**: Both syllables are short. -> **S S**\n*   **sit**: The vowel 'i' is short, but it is followed by two consonants ('t' from *sit* and 'm' from *male*). This makes the syllable long by position. -> **L**\n*   **ma-le**: Both syllables are short. The final syllable of any Latin line is *syllaba anceps*, meaning it can be treated as long or short to fit the meter. Here, it remains short. -> **S S**\n\nThe sequence of long and short syllables is: **L S S S S L S L S L S S L S S**\n\n**Step 3: Grouping Syllables into Feet**\nNow, we group this sequence into the seven-and-a-half feet of the trochaic septenarius, applying the allowed substitutions.\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et ti` -> **L S**. This is a perfect trochee.\n*   **Foot 2:** `bi bene` -> **S S S**. This is a tribrach, a valid resolution of a trochee.\n*   **Foot 3:** `esse` -> **L S**. This is a perfect trochee.\n*   **Foot 4:** `soli` -> **L S**. This is a perfect trochee. The caesura (main pause) occurs here.\n*   **Foot 5:** `quom sibi` -> **L S S**. This is a dactyl, a valid substitution for a trochee in this meter.\n*   **Foot 6:** `sit ma` -> **L S**. This is a perfect trochee.\n*   **Foot 7 (catalectic):** `le` -> **S**. This single short syllable is the incomplete final foot.\n\n**Summary of the analysis:**\n*   **Line:** et tibi | bene | esse | soli || quom sibi | sit ma | le\n*   **Feet:** Trochee | Tribrach | Trochee | Trochee || Dactyl | Trochee | Catalectic Syllable\n*   **Scansion:** L S | S S S | L S | L S || L S S | L S | S\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L S L S S L S S>>>"
