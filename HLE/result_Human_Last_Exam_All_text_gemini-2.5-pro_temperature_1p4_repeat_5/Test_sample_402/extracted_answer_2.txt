The proposed filtering strategy is as follows: First, perform a paired differential expression analysis comparing the CAR+IL15 samples against the CAR-only samples (e.g., using DESeq2 with a `~donor + condition` design). The contaminating cancer genes, being present only in the CAR-only samples, will be identifiable by a large negative log2 fold change (LFC) and a very low adjusted p-value (FDR). Generate a volcano plot of the results to visually identify the distinct cluster of these contaminant genes and determine an appropriate LFC threshold (e.g., LFC < -5). Then, use a command-line tool like `awk` to filter the differential expression results table based on both the LFC and FDR thresholds (e.g., LFC < -5 and FDR < 0.01), creating a list of contaminant gene IDs. Finally, use this gene list with a tool like `grep -v` to remove these specific genes from the original gene count matrix, yielding a cleaned dataset ready for downstream analysis.
