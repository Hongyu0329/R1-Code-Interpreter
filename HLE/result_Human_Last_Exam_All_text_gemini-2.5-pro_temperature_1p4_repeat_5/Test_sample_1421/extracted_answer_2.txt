The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by:
$Z = \int \mathcal{D}[\bar{\psi}, \psi] \exp\left( -S[\bar{\psi}, \psi] \right)$
where:
1.  The integration is a functional integral over all anti-commuting Grassmann fields $\psi_i(\tau)$ and $\bar{\psi}_i(\tau)$. The index $i$ labels the single-particle basis states (e.g., momentum, position), and $\tau$ is the imaginary time variable.
2.  The action $S[\bar{\psi}, \psi]$ is given by:
    $S[\bar{\psi}, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left[ \sum_i \bar{\psi}_i(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi_i(\tau) + H(\{\bar{\psi}_i(\tau)\}, \{\psi_i(\tau)\}) \right]$
3.  $H(\{\bar{\psi}_i\}, \{\psi_i\})$ is the normal-ordered Hamiltonian operator $\hat{H}$ with creation operators ($\hat{c}_i^\dagger$) replaced by $\bar{\psi}_i(\tau)$ and annihilation operators ($\hat{c}_i$) replaced by $\psi_i(\tau)$.
4.  The fields are subject to anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time $\tau \in [0, \beta]$:
    $\psi_i(\beta) = - \psi_i(0)$
    $\bar{\psi}_i(\beta) = - \bar{\psi}_i(0)$
