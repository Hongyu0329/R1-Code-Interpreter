    "An analysis of the question is provided below, outlining the steps and key considerations for deriving the formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Fundamental Definition:** The starting point is the definition of the canonical partition function ($Z$) in quantum statistical mechanics, which is the trace of the thermal density operator:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}})$\n    Here, $\\hat{H}$ is the many-body Hamiltonian operator, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature, and the trace (Tr) is taken over the complete, anti-symmetrized many-body Hilbert space for fermions.\n\n2.  **Imaginary Time Discretization:** The operator $e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$ is mathematically equivalent to an imaginary time evolution operator. To formulate a path integral, the imaginary time interval $[0, \\beta]$ is divided into $N$ small slices of duration $\\Delta\\tau = \\beta/N$. The expression for $Z$ is then written as a product of operators for each small time step:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\Delta\\tau \\hat{H}} e^{-\\Delta\\tau \\hat{H}} \\cdots e^{-\\Delta\\tau \\hat{H}})$\n\n3.  **Resolution of Identity with Fermionic Coherent States:** Between each pair of $e^{-\\Delta\\tau \\hat{H}}$ factors, a resolution of the identity operator is inserted. For fermionic systems, the correct choice of states is the **fermionic coherent states**, which are parameterized by anti-commuting **Grassmann numbers** ($\\psi_i, \\bar{\\psi}_i$). These numbers embody the Pauli exclusion principle at the classical level ($\\psi_i\\psi_j = -\\psi_j\\psi_i \\implies \\psi_i^2 = 0$).\n\n4.  **Path Integral Formulation:** By inserting the completeness relations and taking the continuum limit ($N \\to \\infty, \\Delta\\tau \\to 0$), the trace over states becomes a functional integral (or path integral) over all possible time-dependent trajectories of the Grassmann fields $\\psi_i(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau)$.\n\n5.  **The Resulting Formula:** The final expression takes the form of an integral over all field configurations, weighted by the exponential of a classical action, $S$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Grassmann Variables:** The core difference from the bosonic case is that the fields $\\psi(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau)$ are not ordinary numbers but are independent, anti-commuting Grassmann variables. The integration measure $\\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$ corresponds to Berezin integration.\n\n2.  **Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions:** Fermi-Dirac statistics impose a crucial constraint on the fields. The trace operation for fermions results in **anti-periodic boundary conditions** in the imaginary time direction. This means a field at the beginning of the interval is the negative of the field at the end:\n    $\\psi_i(0) = - \\psi_i(\\beta)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}_i(0) = - \\bar{\\psi}_i(\\beta)$.\n\n3.  **Form of the Action:** The action $S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$ consists of two parts:\n    *   A \"kinetic\" or time-derivative term, $\\sum_i \\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi_i(\\tau)$, which arises from the overlap of coherent states at successive time slices.\n    *   A \"potential\" term, $H(\\{\\bar{\\psi}_i\\}, \\{\\psi_i\\})$, which is the symbol of the Hamiltonian. It is obtained by taking the normal-ordered Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}(\\{\\hat{c}_i^\\dagger\\}, \\{\\hat{c}_i\\})$ and replacing the creation operators $\\hat{c}_i^\\dagger$ with $\\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau)$ and annihilation operators $\\hat{c}_i$ with $\\psi_i(\\tau)$.\n\nCombining these elements leads to the final formula.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\exp\\left( -S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\right)$\nwhere:\n1.  The integration is a functional integral over all anti-commuting Grassmann fields $\\psi_i(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau)$. The index $i$ labels the single-particle basis states (e.g., momentum, position), and $\\tau$ is the imaginary time variable.\n2.  The action $S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$ is given by:\n    $S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\sum_i \\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi_i(\\tau) + H(\\{\\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau)\\}, \\{\\psi_i(\\tau)\\}) \\right]$\n3.  $H(\\{\\bar{\\psi}_i\\}, \\{\\psi_i\\})$ is the normal-ordered Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$ with creation operators ($\\hat{c}_i^\\dagger$) replaced by $\\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau)$ and annihilation operators ($\\hat{c}_i$) replaced by $\\psi_i(\\tau)$.\n4.  The fields are subject to anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta]$:\n    $\\psi_i(\\beta) = - \\psi_i(0)$\n    $\\bar{\\psi}_i(\\beta) = - \\bar{\\psi}_i(0)$>>>"
