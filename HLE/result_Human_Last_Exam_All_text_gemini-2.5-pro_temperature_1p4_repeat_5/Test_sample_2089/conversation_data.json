    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question's Key Elements**\nThe query asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film containing a precise sequence of events. The key elements are:\n1.  **Oscar-nominated film:** The movie must have received at least one Academy Award nomination.\n2.  **A character:** The question specifies a male character (\"his fate\"), but this could be a minor error in recollection.\n3.  **Boarding a bus:** The action takes place as the character is getting on a bus.\n4.  **Says \"Thank you\":** This is the specific dialogue spoken by the character.\n5.  **Seals his fate:** This action and line of dialogue represent a point of no return, a final, often tragic, outcome for the character.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Films and Scenes**\nBased on these specific keywords, we can recall or search for films with memorable scenes involving buses and tragic turning points. The most prominent film that fits this description is *Babel* (2006).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Film *Babel* Against the Criteria**\n*   **Is it Oscar-nominated?** Yes. *Babel* was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actress for Adriana Barraza, the actress involved in the scene in question. It won the Oscar for Best Original Score. This satisfies the first criterion.\n\n*   **Does the scene involve a character, a bus, and the line \"Thank you\"?** Yes. The scene involves the character Amelia Hernandez (played by Adriana Barraza). After a harrowing series of events that lead to her being deported from the United States, she is escorted to a bus that will take her back across the Mexican border. As she boards, she turns to the U.S. border patrol officer and says a quiet \"Thank you.\"\n\n*   **Is the character's gender a match?** This is the only point of discrepancy. The question specifies a male character (\"his\"), while the character in *Babel* is female (Amelia). In trivia questions based on memory, it is common for such details to be misremembered. The uniqueness and specificity of the rest of the scene make it overwhelmingly the most likely answer.\n\n*   **Does this act \"seal her fate\"?** Absolutely. The events leading up to this moment (the illegal border crossing, abandoning the children in the desert) have already determined her fate of being deported. However, this final scene—the act of boarding the bus and uttering the words—is the cinematic moment that confirms and \"seals\" it. It is a heartbreaking moment of finality, showing her accepting the loss of her job, the children she loves as her own, and the life she had built in the U.S. The simple \"Thank you\" is laden with tragic irony and quiet dignity, cementing the irreversible consequences of her actions.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nDespite the minor discrepancy in the character's gender, the scene in *Babel* aligns perfectly with all the other crucial details of the question. No other Oscar-nominated film features such a memorable and specific scene that matches the description of a character's fate being sealed with the words \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus.\n\n<<<Babel>>>"
