    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Physics and Formulate the Problem**\n\n1.  **System:** We are considering a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well, commonly known as a \"particle in a box\". The box has a length of `a`, extending from `x=0` to `x=a`.\n2.  **Quantum State:** The particle is in the first excited state, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n3.  **Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    `ψ_n(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n    For our case (`n=2`), the wavefunction is:\n    `ψ_2(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)`\n4.  **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is given by the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, `|ψ_n(x)|^2`. This is the probability density function, `P(x)`.\n    `P(x) = |ψ_2(x)|^2 = (√(2/a) * sin(2πx / a))^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx / a)`\n5.  **Goal:** We need to find the probability of the particle being located in the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`. This probability is found by integrating the probability density function over this interval.\n    `Probability = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx`\n\n### **Step 2: Set Up and Solve the Integral**\n\n1.  **Set up the integral:**\n    `Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin^2(2πx / a) dx`\n\n2.  **Simplify the integrand:** To make the integral solvable, we use the trigonometric power-reduction identity: `sin^2(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ)) / 2`.\n    In our case, `θ = 2πx / a`, so `2θ = 4πx / a`.\n    The integrand becomes:\n    `(2/a) * [ (1 - cos(4πx / a)) / 2 ] = (1/a) * (1 - cos(4πx / a))`\n\n3.  **Rewrite the integral:**\n    `Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1/a) * (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx`\n\n4.  **Perform the integration:**\n    `Probability = (1/a) * [ ∫(1) dx - ∫cos(4πx / a) dx ]`\n    `Probability = (1/a) * [ x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a) ]` evaluated from `0.495a` to `0.505a`.\n\n5.  **Apply the limits of integration:**\n    `Probability = (1/a) * { [0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] - [0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)] }`\n    Simplify the terms:\n    `Probability = (1/a) * { (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] }`\n    `Probability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]`\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate the Trigonometric Expression and Final Answer**\n\n1.  **Analyze the trigonometric terms:**\n    The term `sin(2.02π)` can be written as `sin(2π + 0.02π)`, which is equal to `sin(0.02π)`.\n    The term `sin(1.98π)` can be written as `sin(2π - 0.02π)`, which is equal to `-sin(0.02π)`.\n    Substituting these back gives:\n    `[sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))] = 2 * sin(0.02π)`\n    So, `Probability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [2 * sin(0.02π)] = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)`\n\n2.  **Use the small-angle approximation (Taylor Series):**\n    The expression `0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)` involves subtracting two numbers that are very close to each other, which can lead to precision errors. A more robust way is to use the Taylor series for `sin(y)` where `y` is small: `sin(y) ≈ y - y³/6`.\n    Let `y = 0.02π`.\n    `Probability ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * [ (0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6 ]`\n    Distribute the `(1/2π)` term:\n    `Probability ≈ 0.01 - [ (0.02π / 2π) - (0.02π)³ / (2π * 6) ]`\n    `Probability ≈ 0.01 - [ 0.01 - (0.000008π³) / (12π) ]`\n    `Probability ≈ 0.01 - 0.01 + ( (8 x 10⁻⁶) * π² ) / 12`\n    `Probability ≈ (8/12) * π² * 10⁻⁶ = (2/3) * π² * 10⁻⁶`\n\n3.  **Calculate the final numerical value:**\n    Using `π² ≈ 9.8696`:\n    `Probability ≈ (2/3) * 9.8696 * 10⁻⁶`\n    `Probability ≈ 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶`\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n*   **Correct State:** The problem is for `n=2`, not the ground state `n=1`. This changes the wavefunction significantly, introducing a node at the center of the box (`x=a/2`).\n*   **Integration Limits:** The limits `0.495a` and `0.505a` are crucial. The length of the box `a` will cancel out in the final dimensionless probability.\n*   **Trigonometric Identity:** Using `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2` is essential for the integration. A common mistake is to forget the factor of 2 in `cos(2θ)`.\n*   **Catastrophic Cancellation:** The expression `0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)` is a classic example of catastrophic cancellation. Evaluating it directly on a calculator with limited precision might yield 0 or an inaccurate result. Using a Taylor series expansion is the correct way to handle this.\n*   **Taylor Series Order:** The Taylor series for `sin(y)` must be expanded to the third-order term (`y³`) because the first-order term (`y`) cancels out with the `0.01` term.\n*   **Node at the Center:** Since the interval is centered on a node (a point of zero probability), we expect the probability to be very small, but not exactly zero.\n\nThe probability that the particle is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately `6.58 x 10⁻⁶`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
