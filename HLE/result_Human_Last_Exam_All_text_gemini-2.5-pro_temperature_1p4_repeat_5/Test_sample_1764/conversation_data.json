    "An analysis of the question step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"Let X be a finite ultrametric space\"**: We are given a set $X$ with a finite number of points, let's say $n = |X|$, and a distance function $d: X \\times X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the following properties for all $x, y, z \\in X$:\n        1.  $d(x, y) \\ge 0$ (non-negativity)\n        2.  $d(x, y) = 0 \\iff x = y$ (identity of indiscernibles)\n        3.  $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ (symmetry)\n        4.  $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ (the strong triangle inequality or ultrametric inequality).\n    *   **\"and B a Banach space of cardinality K\"**: We are also given a target space $B$. A Banach space is a complete normed vector space. It is typically defined over the field of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ or complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$. The cardinality $K$ of any non-trivial Banach space (i.e., not just the zero vector) is infinite (at least the cardinality of the continuum). The mention of \"cardinality K\" might be a distractor.\n    *   **\"What is the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of X in B?\"**: We need to find the number of functions $f: X \\to B$ that preserve distance, i.e., for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d(x_1, x_2)$. The question asks for the \"smallest possible number,\" which means we are looking for the value $N = \\min_{X,B} (\\text{Number of embeddings of X into B})$, where we can choose any finite ultrametric space $X$ and any Banach space $B$.\n\n2.  **Careful Points & Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Existence of Embeddings**: For any given finite metric space $X$ (and thus for any finite ultrametric space), an isometric embedding into a Banach space is always guaranteed to exist. A well-known construction is the Kuratowski embedding, which maps $X$ into the Banach space $l_\\infty(X)$ of bounded functions on $X$. This means the number of embeddings is never zero. Therefore, the smallest possible number must be at least 1.\n\n    *   **The Role of Translations**: Let's assume we have found one isometric embedding, $f: X \\to B$. Let $B$ be a non-trivial Banach space (i.e., $B \\neq \\{0\\}$). For any vector $v_0 \\in B$, we can define a new map $f_{v_0}(x) = f(x) + v_0$. This new map is also an isometric embedding because:\n        $\\|f_{v_0}(x_1) - f_{v_0}(x_2)\\|_B = \\|(f(x_1) + v_0) - (f(x_2) + v_0)\\|_B = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n        If $B$ is a non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, it has infinitely many points. Each distinct $v_0 \\in B$ gives a distinct embedding function. This implies that if $X$ can be embedded into any non-trivial Banach space, there are infinitely many such embeddings. This seems to contradict the expectation of a small integer answer.\n\n    *   **Resolving the \"Infinity\" Problem**: The argument above seems to imply the minimum is either 1 (if we can only embed into $B=\\{0\\}$) or infinite. This suggests we must investigate the edge cases very carefully. The premises are that $X$ is a *finite* ultrametric space and $B$ is *a* Banach space. We have the freedom to choose both $X$ and $B$ to find the minimum.\n\n    *   **Considering Trivial Cases**:\n        *   **Trivial Space X**: The definition of a \"finite ultrametric space\" includes a space with a single point. Let $X = \\{x_0\\}$. The only distance is $d(x_0, x_0) = 0$.\n        *   **Trivial Space B**: The definition of a \"Banach space\" includes the space consisting of only the zero vector, $B = \\{0\\}$. This is a complete normed vector space. Its norm is $\\|0\\|=0$. Its cardinality is 1.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Derivation of the Final Answer:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Lower Bound**: As established by the existence of the Kuratowski embedding, for any finite ultrametric space $X$, there is at least one isometric embedding into some Banach space. Therefore, the number of embeddings is always at least 1. The smallest possible number cannot be less than 1.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Finding a Case for the Lower Bound**: We now search for a specific pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly 1. Let's use the trivial cases identified above.\n        *   Choose $X$ to be the one-point ultrametric space, $X = \\{x_0\\}$.\n        *   Choose $B$ to be the zero Banach space, $B = \\{0\\}$.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Count the Embeddings for this Case**: We need to count the number of functions $f: \\{x_0\\} \\to \\{0\\}$ that are isometric embeddings.\n        *   There is only one possible function from a one-point set to another one-point set: $f(x_0) = 0$.\n        *   We must check if this function is an isometric embedding. The condition is that for all points in $X$ (here, only $x_0$), the distance is preserved. The only pair of points to check is $(x_0, x_0)$.\n        *   We must verify if $\\|f(x_0) - f(x_0)\\|_B = d(x_0, x_0)$.\n        *   Plugging in our choices: $\\|0 - 0\\|_{\\{0\\}} = d(x_0, x_0)$.\n        *   $\\|0\\|_{\\{0\\}} = 0$ and $d(x_0, x_0) = 0$. The condition becomes $0=0$, which is true.\n        *   Therefore, the function $f(x_0)=0$ is an isometric embedding. Since it is the only possible function, the total number of isometric embeddings of this $X$ into this $B$ is exactly 1.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Conclusion**: We have shown that the number of embeddings is always at least 1, and we have found a specific instance where the number is exactly 1. This means the smallest possible number is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
