    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Subject**\nThe question is about a specific detail in an episode of the online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n\n**Step 2: Pinpoint the Specific Episode and Segment**\nThe question narrows the focus to \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". \"Teen Girl Squad\" is a recurring segment within the Homestar Runner universe, drawn by the character Strong Bad on loose-leaf paper.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Context of the Episode**\nThe plot of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" revolves around the main characters (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attending their Junior prom.\n\n**Step 4: Isolate the Specific Question Element**\nThe question asks to identify the fictional singer who \"performs\" at this prom. A key point here is that the performance is not by a live person, but by a cardboard cutout.\n\n**Step 5: Recall or Research the Details of the Scene**\nIn the episode, as the girls arrive at the prom, the on-screen text and an announcement introduce the musical guest. This guest is presented as a cardboard cutout propped up on the stage.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Name of the Fictional Singer**\nThe announcer introduces the performer with a very specific name and genre. The name is a play on one of the main Homestar Runner characters, Marzipan, combined with the nature of the object itself. The fictional singer is named \"Cardboard Marzipan\". She is described as an \"indie-folk-tronic-casio-core-for-babies artist.\"\n\n**Step 7: Final verification**\nConfirming through episode transcripts and wikis dedicated to the series verifies that the cardboard cutout performing at the Junior Prom in Teen Girl Squad #15 is indeed \"Cardboard Marzipan\".\n\n***\n\n<<<Cardboard Marzipan>>>"
