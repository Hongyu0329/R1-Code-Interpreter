    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nThe core components of the riddle are:\n1.  **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay.\n2.  **Location:** Vienna.\n3.  **Subject of description:** The wide boulevards of Vienna (most famously, the Ringstrasse).\n4.  **Hidden element:** The surname of an English poet is present within this description.\n5.  **Task:** Identify the poet's surname in English.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Key Clue**\nThe puzzle hinges on a linguistic pun or phonetic similarity. We are looking for a Russian word, used to describe Viennese boulevards, that sounds like the surname of an English poet.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Context (Vienna's Boulevards)**\nVienna's most famous wide boulevard is the Ringstrasse. It is known for its grand, monumental, and somewhat opulent or ostentatious 19th-century architecture. A fitting description for this style might involve words relating to grandeur, scale, or even excessive decoration.\n\n**Step 4: Brainstorming Potential Russian Words**\nLet's consider words that could be used in the description:\n*   \"Широкий\" (shirokiy) - wide.\n*   \"Проспект\" (prospekt) - avenue.\n*   \"Грандиозный\" (grandioznyy) - grandiose.\nNone of these directly sound like a famous English poet's name (like Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth, etc.). We need to think more creatively.\n\n**Step 5: The \"Kitsch\" Connection**\nThe specific style of the Ringstrasse is often described, sometimes critically, as being overly ornate or sentimental. A perfect word to capture this aesthetic is the German loanword \"Kitsch,\" which is also used in Russian as **\"китч\" (kitch)**. It refers to art or design considered to be in poor taste due to garishness or excessive sentimentality. It is highly plausible that an essay would use the word \"китч\" to describe the flamboyant style of Vienna's boulevards.\n\n**Step 6: Finding the Poet**\nNow, we must find an English poet whose surname sounds like the Russian word \"китч\" (kitch).\n*   The pronunciation of \"китч\" is very close to [kʲit͡ɕ].\n*   Let's consider famous English poets. The surname of the Romantic poet John **Keats** fits perfectly.\n*   In Russian, \"Keats\" is written as \"Китс\" and pronounced as [kʲit͡s].\n*   The phonetic similarity between \"китч\" (kitch) and \"Китс\" (Kits) is extremely strong and is the key to solving the riddle.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\nThe essay describes the wide boulevards of Vienna, likely using the word \"китч\" (kitsch) to characterize their grandiose style. This word sounds almost identical to the surname of the English poet John **Keats**.\n\n<<<Keats>>>"
