    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Schema and the Logic\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of four unary predicates, which we can denote as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A model (or structure) for this schema is a universe of elements $U$ along with interpretations for these predicates, which are subsets $P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M$ of $U$. For an element $a \\in U$, $P_i(a)$ is true if $a \\in P_i^M$.\n\n*   **Logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of first-order logic.\n    *   It uses the predicates from $S$.\n    *   The only allowed logical symbols are:\n        *   $\\exists$ (existential quantifier)\n        *   $\\land$ (conjunction, \"AND\")\n        *   $\\top$ (true)\n        *   $\\bot$ (false)\n    *   Atomic formulas are of the form $P_i(x)$, where $x$ is a variable. Equality ($=$) is not specified, so we assume it is not part of the language.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Concept Class (Hypothesis Space)\n\nThe question asks for the VC dimension of the language. In this context, we are interested in formulas with exactly one free variable, say $x_0$. Each such formula $\\phi(x_0)$ defines a concept.\n\nFor a given model $M$, a formula $\\phi(x_0)$ defines the set of elements in the universe $U^M$ that satisfy the formula. This set is the concept defined by $\\phi(x_0)$ in the context of model $M$.\n$C_{\\phi, M} = \\{ a \\in U^M \\mid M \\models \\phi(a) \\}$.\n\nThe overall concept class, let's call it $\\mathcal{H}$, is the set of all such concepts that can be formed. The VC dimension of $\\mathcal{H}$ is the largest integer $d$ for which there exists some model $M$ and a set of $d$ elements $X \\subseteq U^M$ that can be shattered by the concepts available in that model.\n\n### Step 3: Characterizing the Definable Concepts\n\nLet's analyze the structure of any formula $\\phi(x_0)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. A formula in this language can be rewritten into an equivalent form. Any formula $\\phi(x_0)$ is logically equivalent to a formula of the shape:\n$\\psi(x_0) \\land S$\nwhere:\n1.  $\\psi(x_0)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving the free variable $x_0$. So, $\\psi(x_0)$ is of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x_0)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n2.  $S$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). A sentence in this language is a conjunction of purely existential statements, like $\\exists y_1 \\exists y_2 (P_1(y_1) \\land P_3(y_2) \\land \\dots)$.\n\nFor a fixed model $M$, the sentence $S$ is either true or false.\n*   If $M \\not\\models S$, the formula $\\psi(x_0) \\land S$ is false for any assignment to $x_0$. The concept defined is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n*   If $M \\models S$, the formula is equivalent to just $\\psi(x_0)$. The concept defined is the set of elements satisfying $\\psi(x_0)$, which is $\\{a \\in U^M \\mid M \\models \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(a)\\} = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$.\n\nThe formulas $\\top$ and $\\bot$ are also in the language.\n*   $\\top$ defines the entire universe $U^M$, which corresponds to an empty conjunction ($I=\\emptyset$).\n*   $\\bot$ defines the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n\nSo, for any given model $M$, the set of all definable concepts, $\\mathcal{C}_M$, is a subset of the set of all possible intersections of the base predicates' interpretations, plus the empty set:\n$\\mathcal{C}_M \\subseteq \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$.\n\nThe formula $\\phi_I(x_0) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x_0)$ is a valid formula for any $I \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. Its sentence part is $\\top$, which is always true. Thus, for any model $M$, the class of definable concepts $\\mathcal{C}_M$ is precisely:\n$\\mathcal{C}_M = \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\}$.\n(Note: $\\emptyset$ can be one of these intersections, e.g., if $P_1^M$ and $P_2^M$ are disjoint, then $P_1^M \\cap P_2^M = \\emptyset$).\n\nThis class of concepts is known as the class of **monotone monomials**. The number of predicates is $k=4$. The number of such concepts is at most $2^k = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the VC Dimension - Upper Bound\n\nThe VC dimension is the size of the largest set that can be shattered. Let this be $d$. For a set $X$ of size $d$ to be shattered by a concept class $\\mathcal{C}$, there must be a concept in $\\mathcal{C}$ for each of the $2^d$ subsets of $X$. This means that the concept class must have at least $2^d$ distinct concepts.\n\nIn our case, we are looking for the maximum $d$ such that there exists a model $M$ and a set $X \\subseteq U^M$ of size $d$ shattered by $\\mathcal{C}_M$.\nFor any model $M$, the number of definable concepts is $|\\mathcal{C}_M| \\le 2^k = 16$.\nIf a set of size $d$ is shattered, then $2^d \\le |\\mathcal{C}_M| \\le 16$.\n$2^d \\le 16$ implies $d \\le 4$.\nThus, the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the VC Dimension - Lower Bound\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must construct a model $M$ and a set $X \\subseteq U^M$ of size 4 that can be shattered by the concepts in $\\mathcal{C}_M$.\n\nLet $k=4$ be the number of predicates. Let's choose a set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We need to define a model $M$ (the universe $U^M$ and the predicate interpretations $P_i^M$) over these elements.\n*   Let the universe $U^M$ be just the set $X$.\n*   Define the interpretations of the predicates $P_i^M$ as follows: an element $x_j$ has property $P_i$ if and only if $i \\ne j$.\n    *   $M \\models P_i(x_j) \\iff i \\ne j$.\n    *   For example, $x_1$ satisfies $P_2, P_3, P_4$ but not $P_1$.\n    *   $x_2$ satisfies $P_1, P_3, P_4$ but not $P_2$, and so on.\n\nNow, we need to show that any subset $Y \\subseteq X$ can be \"picked out\" by a concept from $\\mathcal{C}_M$. A concept is of the form $C_I = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$ for some $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. We need to show that for any $Y \\subseteq X$, there is an $I$ such that $C_I \\cap X = Y$.\n\nLet's determine which elements of $X$ belong to a concept $C_I$:\nAn element $x_j \\in X$ is in $C_I$ if and only if $M \\models P_i(x_j)$ for all $i \\in I$.\nBy our definition, this is equivalent to: $i \\ne j$ for all $i \\in I$.\nThis condition simply means that the index $j$ must not be in the set $I$.\nSo, $x_j \\in C_I \\iff j \\notin I$.\n\nThis gives us a simple rule for constructing the desired concepts:\n$C_I = \\{x_j \\in X \\mid j \\notin I\\}$.\n\nNow, let $Y$ be any desired subset of $X$. We can write $Y = \\{x_j \\mid j \\in J\\}$ for some index set $J \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nWe need to find an index set $I$ such that $C_I = Y$.\nThis means we need $\\{x_j \\in X \\mid j \\notin I\\} = \\{x_j \\in X \\mid j \\in J\\}$.\nThis requires the index sets to be complementary: $\\{j \\mid j \\notin I\\} = J$, which means $I = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus J$.\n\nFor any choice of $J$ (which defines the target subset $Y$), we can choose $I$ to be its complement set. This choice of $I$ is always valid (it's a subset of $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$). The corresponding formula $\\phi_I(x_0) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x_0)$ will then select exactly the subset $Y$.\n\nFor example:\n*   To get $Y = \\{x_1, x_3\\}$, we have $J=\\{1, 3\\}$. We choose $I = \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus \\{1,3\\} = \\{2, 4\\}$. The concept is $C_{\\{2,4\\}} = P_2^M \\cap P_4^M$.\n*   To get $Y = X$, we have $J=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. We choose $I = \\emptyset$. The concept is $C_\\emptyset = U^M = X$.\n*   To get $Y = \\emptyset$, we have $J=\\emptyset$. We choose $I=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The concept is $C_{\\{1,2,3,4\\}} = P_1^M \\cap P_2^M \\cap P_3^M \\cap P_4^M = \\emptyset$.\n\nSince we can generate all $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $X$, the set $X$ is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 4, we have VCdim $\\le 4$.\nFrom Step 5, we have VCdim $\\ge 4$.\nTherefore, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with 4 unary predicates is exactly 4."
