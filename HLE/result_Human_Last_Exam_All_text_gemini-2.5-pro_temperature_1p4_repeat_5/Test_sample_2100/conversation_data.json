    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the first clue.**\nThe first clue is a quote from the poet Andrei Voznesensky: \"a joy-discovering sailor\". This is a poetic description. \"Sailor\" suggests a person associated with travel, exploration, and adventure. \"Joy-discovering\" suggests he brought new, positive things, perhaps in art, exploration, or thought. This points towards a significant and adventurous figure. The fact that the quote is from a famous Russian poet suggests the man is likely Russian or from the Soviet sphere of influence.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the second clue.**\nThe second clue is another quote from Voznesensky about the same man: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This is a very direct clue. It tells us that at the time Voznesensky wrote the poem, the burial place of this man was completely unknown. This implies the man died under circumstances where his body was not recovered, or his grave was deliberately hidden or left unmarked. This often happened to victims of political purges, those lost in expeditions, or casualties of war whose bodies were never identified.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the poem and its subject.**\nBy combining the first two clues, we can identify the specific work by Voznesensky. The quotes are from his famous poem \"Сага\" (\"Saga\"). The poem is explicitly about, and even directly addresses, the poet Nikolai Gumilyov. A key line in the poem is \"Где твоя могила, Гумилёв?\" (\"Where is your grave, Gumilyov?\"). This identifies the man in question.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the third clue and cross-referencing with the subject's biography.**\nThe third clue states that the answer to the question of his grave's location \"emerged in the late 1980s\". We must check if this fits the life and death of Nikolai Gumilyov.\n*   **Nikolai Gumilyov (1886-1921)** was a major Russian poet, a founder of the Acmeist movement, an explorer who traveled in Africa, and the first husband of poet Anna Akhmatova. His adventurous life fits the \"sailor\" description.\n*   **His death:** Gumilyov was arrested and executed by the Soviet secret police (the Cheka) in August 1921 for alleged involvement in a counter-revolutionary conspiracy. The exact location of his execution and burial was kept secret by the Soviet authorities for over 60 years.\n*   **The discovery:** During the period of Glasnost and Perestroika in the late 1980s, KGB archives began to be opened. This allowed historians to research previously forbidden topics. Through this research, the site of the mass grave where Gumilyov was buried was identified as being in the Kovalevsky Forest area near St. Petersburg. This perfectly matches the timeline given in the clue.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The description \"sailor\" is metaphorical for Gumilyov's identity as an explorer and a discoverer of new poetic forms.\n*   The mystery of the grave is central to the question. It points to a victim of state secrecy or a person lost to history.\n*   The \"late 1980s\" is a critical historical marker, pointing directly to the Glasnost era in the Soviet Union when many such secrets were revealed.\n*   The question asks for the man's last name.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll clues point unambiguously to the Russian poet Nikolai Gumilyov. Voznesensky's poem laments his unknown fate, and the historical record confirms his grave's location was discovered in the late 1980s.\n\n<<<Gumilyov>>>"
