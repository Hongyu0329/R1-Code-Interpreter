    "This problem asks for the identification of all finite nilpotent groups that are \"filled groups\". Let's break down the problem by analyzing the definitions and properties step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a product-free set.**\n\nA subset `S` of a finite group `G` is defined as **product-free** if for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (where `x` and `y` are not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not an element of `S`. In set notation, this condition is written as `S⋅S ∩ S = ∅`, where `S⋅S = {xy | x ∈ S, y ∈ S}`.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Identity Element**\n\nA crucial consequence of this definition concerns the identity element `e` of the group `G`.\n*   Let's assume a set `S` is product-free.\n*   If `e` were an element of `S`, we could choose `x = e` and `y = e`.\n*   The product is `xy = e⋅e = e`.\n*   Since `e` is in `S`, this means `xy ∈ S`, which violates the condition for `S` to be product-free.\n*   Therefore, the identity element `e` can **never** be a member of any product-free set.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the definition of a \"maximum by inclusion product-free set\".**\n\nThis is standard terminology for a **maximal product-free set**. A product-free set `A` in `G` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. In other words, if you add any element `g ∈ G \\ A` to `A`, the new set `A ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Maximal sets are still product-free.**\n\nBy definition, a maximal product-free set is, first and foremost, a product-free set. Combining this with the conclusion from Step 1, it follows that **no maximal product-free set can contain the identity element `e`**.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the definition of a \"filled group\".**\n\nThe problem states that a finite group `G` is a **filled group** if \"all the maximum by inclusion product-free sets in G fills G\". This means that the union of all maximal product-free sets is equal to the entire group `G`.\n*   Let `M(G)` be the collection of all maximal product-free sets in `G`.\n*   The condition for `G` to be a filled group is `∪_{A ∈ M(G)} A = G`.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the definitions to identify filled groups.**\n\nFrom our analysis above:\n1.  Every maximal product-free set `A` is a subset of `G \\ {e}` (the set `G` excluding the identity element).\n2.  The union of all these sets, `U = ∪_{A ∈ M(G)} A`, must therefore also be a subset of `G \\ {e}`.\n3.  The condition for `G` to be a filled group is `U = G`.\n4.  This leads to a contradiction: `G = U ⊆ G \\ {e}`. This would imply that `e ∉ G`, which is impossible for any group.\n\nThis shows that no non-trivial group can be a filled group. We must also check the trivial group.\n\n**Careful Point 3: The Trivial Group**\n\nLet `G = {e}` be the trivial group of order 1.\n*   The subsets of `G` are `∅` and `{e}`.\n*   Is `{e}` a product-free set? No, because `e⋅e = e`, and `e` is in the set.\n*   Is `∅` a product-free set? Yes, the condition `∀x, y ∈ ∅, xy ∉ ∅` is vacuously true.\n*   Is `∅` a maximal product-free set? We check if adding any element from `G \\ ∅` to it makes it not product-free. The only element in `G \\ ∅` is `e`. The new set is `∅ ∪ {e} = {e}`, which we already established is not product-free. Thus, `∅` is the only maximal product-free set in `G = {e}`.\n*   The union of all maximal product-free sets is just `∅`.\n*   The condition for `G = {e}` to be a filled group is that this union must equal `G`. This means `∅ = {e}`, which is false.\n*   Therefore, the trivial group is not a filled group.\n\n**Step 5: Final conclusion about finite filled groups.**\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the definitions, **no finite group** can be a filled group. The set of finite filled groups is empty.\n\n**Step 6: Answer the specific question about nilpotent groups.**\n\nThe question asks for the finite **filled nilpotent** groups. Since the set of all finite filled groups is empty, the set of finite filled groups that also happen to be nilpotent must also be empty. The property of being nilpotent is irrelevant to the conclusion, which holds for all finite groups.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis demonstrates that, based on the standard definitions of the terms provided, a \"filled group\" cannot exist. The identity element can never belong to a product-free set, so the union of all maximal product-free sets can never be equal to the entire group. This holds true for the trivial group as well as any non-trivial group. Consequently, there are no finite filled groups, and therefore no finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n<<<No such groups exist>>>"
