    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group $Q_{128}$**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, has the presentation:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor our problem, the group is $Q_{128}$. Here, the order is $128 = 4n$, which implies $n=32$.\nSo, the presentation for $Q_{128}$ is:\n$G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Elements:** Any element in $G$ can be uniquely written as $x^i y^j$ where $0 \\le i < 64$ and $j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n*   **Order:** The order of the group is $|G| = 128$.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Power Subgroup\"**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a **power subgroup** if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is equal to the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. This set is denoted by $G^k$.\n$H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** For a general group $G$, the set $G^k$ is not necessarily a subgroup. However, for generalized quaternion groups, it is a known property that $G^k$ is always a subgroup for any integer $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Exponent of $Q_{128}$**\n\nThe exponent of a group is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of all its elements. Let's find the orders of the elements in $Q_{128}$.\n*   **Elements of the form $x^i$:** The element $x$ generates a cyclic subgroup of order 64. The order of $x^i$ is $o(x^i) = 64 / \\gcd(i, 64)$. The possible orders are all divisors of 64: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. The maximum order is 64.\n*   **Elements of the form $x^i y$:** Let's compute the square of such an element:\n    $(x^i y)^2 = (x^i y)(x^i y) = x^i (y x^i) y = x^i (x^{-i} y) y = (x^i x^{-i}) y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    Now, let's compute the fourth power:\n    $(x^i y)^4 = ((x^i y)^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n    Since $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32} \\ne 1$, the order of any element of the form $x^i y$ is exactly 4.\n\nThe set of all possible element orders is $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\nThe exponent of $Q_{128}$ is $\\exp(Q_{128}) = \\text{lcm}(1, 2, 4, ..., 64) = 64$.\n\n**Step 4: Relate Power Subgroups to the Exponent**\n\nWe can establish a crucial property relating the power subgroups $G^k$ to the exponent of the group, $E = \\exp(G)$. For any integer $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is equal to $G^d$, where $d = \\gcd(k, E)$.\n\n*   **Proof Sketch:**\n    *   Since $d$ divides $k$, any element $g^k = g^{d \\cdot (k/d)} = (g^{k/d})^d$ is in $G^d$. So, $G^k \\subseteq G^d$.\n    *   By the Euclidean algorithm, $d = ak + bE$ for some integers $a, b$. So, any element $g^d = g^{ak+bE} = (g^a)^k \\cdot (g^E)^b$. Since $g^E=1$ (by definition of exponent), we have $g^d = (g^a)^k$, which is in $G^k$. So, $G^d \\subseteq G^k$.\n    *   Therefore, $G^k = G^{\\gcd(k, E)}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This means that the set of all possible power subgroups is $\\{ G^d \\mid d \\text{ is a divisor of } \\exp(G) \\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Identify all Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nBased on Step 4, we only need to find the subgroups $G^d$ for all divisors $d$ of $\\exp(Q_{128}) = 64$.\nThe divisors of $64 = 2^6$ are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$. There are $6+1 = 7$ such divisors.\n\nLet's compute the subgroup $G^d$ for each divisor $d$:\n*   $d=1$: $G^1 = \\{g^1 \\mid g \\in G\\} = G = Q_{128}$.\n*   $d=2$: $G^2 = \\{g^2 \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n    *   For $g = x^i$, $g^2 = x^{2i}$. This gives the set $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   For $g = x^i y$, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\n    *   So $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{32}\\}$. Since $x^{32} = (x^2)^{16}$, we have $x^{32} \\in \\langle x^2 \\rangle$. Thus, $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$, a cyclic group of order 32.\n*   $d=4$: $G^4 = \\{g^4 \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n    *   For $g = x^i$, $g^4 = x^{4i}$. This gives $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   For $g = x^i y$, $g^4 = 1$.\n    *   So $G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle \\cup \\{1\\} = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$, a cyclic group of order 16.\n*   $d=8$: Similarly, $G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$, a cyclic group of order 8.\n*   $d=16$: $G^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$, a cyclic group of order 4.\n*   $d=32$: $G^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, a cyclic group of order 2. This is the center of the group, $Z(Q_{128})$.\n*   $d=64$: $G^{64} = \\{g^{64} \\mid g \\in G\\}$. Since $\\exp(G)=64$, $g^{64}=1$ for all $g$. So, $G^{64} = \\{1\\}$, the trivial subgroup.\n\n**Step 6: Count the Distinct Subgroups**\n\nWe have found 7 candidate power subgroups:\n1.  $G^1 = Q_{128}$ (order 128)\n2.  $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n3.  $G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n4.  $G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n5.  $G^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n6.  $G^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n7.  $G^{64} = \\{1\\}$ (order 1)\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** To ensure we have counted correctly, we must verify that these subgroups are all distinct. Since they all have different orders, they must be distinct subgroups.\n\nThus, there are exactly 7 distinct power subgroups in $Q_{128}$. This number is equal to the number of divisors of the exponent of the group, which is $\\tau(64) = \\tau(2^6) = 6+1=7$."
