    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which word from the given list is NOT used as part of a rhyming pair by Geoffrey Chaucer in his poem \"The Book of the Duchess\". This means we need to examine the poem's text to see if each word has a rhyming partner at the end of another line. The poem is primarily written in octosyllabic couplets (AABB rhyme scheme), so rhymes should appear in pairs of consecutive lines.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Word Choice**\n\n*   **A. Wente:**\n    *   This word, meaning \"went\" (verb) or \"path\" (noun), appears in the poem.\n    *   In lines 397-398 (line numbers may vary by edition), we find a homonymic rhyme:\n        > And I hym folwed, and hit forth **wente**\n        > Doun by a floury grene **wente**\n    *   Here, `wente` (the verb \"went\") rhymes with `wente` (the noun \"path\"). Since it is part of a rhyme, this is not the correct answer.\n\n*   **B. Here:**\n    *   This common word appears frequently. We need to find if it's used in a rhyme.\n    *   In lines 543-544 (numbers may vary), we find the following rhyme:\n        > That I herde seyn, and no more **yere**;\n        > But thus this lady song right **here**.\n    *   `Yere` (year) rhymes with `here`. Since it is part of a rhyme, this is not the correct answer.\n\n*   **E. Countour:**\n    *   This word is less common. In the poem, it is used with two different meanings: an accountant/calculator and a counting-board/abacus.\n    *   In lines 435-436 (numbers may vary), Chaucer uses a \"rime riche\" (a rhyme of two words that sound identical but have different meanings):\n        > Though Argus, the noble **countour**,\n        > Sete to rekene in his **countour**,\n    *   Here, `countour` (the accountant) rhymes with `countour` (the counting device). Since it is part of a rhyme, this is not the correct answer.\n\n*   **C. Fool and D. Hool:**\n    *   This leaves us with 'Fool' and 'Hool'. These two words look and sound very similar and could even rhyme with each other. We must investigate them carefully.\n    *   **Fool:** The word 'fool' does appear in the poem (e.g., when the dreamer chides the knight for his sorrow). However, in standard editions, it does not appear at the end of a line in a rhyming position. It is used, but not rhymed.\n    *   **Hool:** This word means \"whole,\" \"complete,\" or \"healthy.\" It appears in some influential editions of the poem at the end of a line where a rhyme is expected, but no rhyme is provided. For instance, in one textual tradition (reflected in Skeat's edition), we find:\n        > That may me hele and do me **boote**\n        > To make me live and be **hool**.\n    *   In this couplet, `boote` (remedy) does not rhyme with `hool`. Chaucer places 'hool' in a rhyming position but leaves it incomplete, mirroring the Black Knight's unending sorrow and inability to be made \"whole.\" This deliberate \"failed rhyme\" is a noted feature of the poem.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Remaining Candidates and Conclude**\nBoth 'Fool' and 'Hool' are not rhymed in the poem. However, there is a key distinction. The word 'fool' is simply never placed in a position to be rhymed. The word 'hool', on the other hand, is placed at the end of a line where a rhyme is structurally expected, but the rhyme is not completed. This makes 'Hool' the stronger and more famous example of a word Chaucer specifically *does not make a rhyme with* in this work. The act of placing it in a rhyming slot and leaving it unrhymed is a more direct instance of \"not rhyming\" it.\n\n<<<D>>>"
