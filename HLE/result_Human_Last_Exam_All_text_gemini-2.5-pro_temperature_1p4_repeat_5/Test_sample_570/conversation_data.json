    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the set of lines\nThe problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain `K` in the plane that intersects every line with an equation of the form `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (i.e., `gcd(p, q) = 1`). Let's call this set of lines `L`.\n\nExamples of lines in `L`:\n- If `(p,q) = (1,0)`, the line is `x = 1`.\n- If `(p,q) = (-1,0)`, the line is `-x = 1`, or `x = -1`.\n- If `(p,q) = (0,1)`, the line is `y = 1`.\n- If `(p,q) = (0,-1)`, the line is `-y = 1`, or `y = -1`.\n- If `(p,q) = (1,1)`, the line is `x + y = 1`.\n- If `(p,q) = (1,-1)`, the line is `x - y = 1`.\n- If `(p,q) = (-1,-1)`, the line is `-x - y = 1`, or `x + y = -1`.\n\nA key observation is that if `(p,q)` are coprime, then `(-p,-q)` are also coprime. This means that if the line `px + qy = 1` is in the set `L`, then the line `-px - qy = 1` (which is `px + qy = -1`) is also in `L`.\n\n### Step 2: Deriving a necessary condition for the convex domain `K`\nLet `K` be a convex domain. For `K` to intersect a line `L: px + qy = 1`, it must have points on both sides of the line (or on the line itself).\nSince `K` must also intersect the line `px + qy = -1`, `K` must have points on both sides of this line too.\nThis means that for any pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`, the convex set `K` cannot be entirely contained in the open strip `S_{p,q} = \\{(x,y) : -1 < px + qy < 1\\}`.\n\nThis gives a condition on the \"width\" of the set `K`. The width of a convex set `K` in a direction given by a unit vector `u` is denoted by `w_K(u)`. The direction of the line `px + qy = c` is perpendicular to the vector `(p,q)`. The distance between the parallel lines `px + qy = 1` and `px + qy = -1` is `|1 - (-1)| / sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 2 / sqrt(p^2 + q^2)`.\nSince `K` must intersect both lines, its width in the direction of the vector `(p,q)` must be at least this distance.\nSo, for every coprime integer pair `(p,q)`, `w_K(u_{p,q}) >= 2 / sqrt(p^2 + q^2)`, where `u_{p,q}` is the unit vector in the direction of `(p,q)`.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a lower bound for the area\nLet's focus on a small subset of the lines from `L`. Consider the four lines:\n1.  `x = 1` (for `(p,q)=(1,0)`)\n2.  `x = -1` (for `(p,q)=(-1,0)`)\n3.  `y = 1` (for `(p,q)=(0,1)`)\n4.  `y = -1` (for `(p,q)=(0,-1)`)\n\nAny convex domain `K` satisfying the problem's condition must intersect these four lines. These four lines form the boundary of a square `S_1 = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]`, which has an area of `2 * 2 = 4`.\n\nThere is a known geometric theorem (related to a problem from the Miklos Schweitzer competition) which states: If `P` is a parallelogram of area `A`, and `K` is a convex set that intersects each of the four lines forming the boundary of `P`, then the area of `K` must be at least `A/2`.\n\nApplying this theorem to our case, the four lines form a square (which is a parallelogram) of area `A = 4`. Therefore, any convex set `K` intersecting these four lines must have an area of at least `4 / 2 = 2`.\nThis establishes a lower bound for the minimal area: `Area(K) >= 2`.\n\n### Step 4: Finding a candidate domain with the minimal area\nNow, we need to find a convex domain `K` that satisfies the condition and has an area of 2. If we can find such a set, then the minimal area must be exactly 2.\n\nConsider the square `Q` with vertices at `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, and `(0,-1)`.\nThis square can be described by the inequality `|x| + |y| <= 1`.\nThe side length of this square is `sqrt( (1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2)`.\nThe area of this square is `(sqrt(2))^2 = 2`.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the candidate domain\nLet's check if the square `Q = \\{(x,y) : |x| + |y| <= 1\\}` intersects every line in the set `L`.\nA convex set `K` intersects a line `px + qy = c` if and only if the value `c` is between the minimum and maximum values of the linear function `f(x,y) = px + qy` over the set `K`.\nThat is, `inf_{(x,y) in K} (px+qy) <= c <= sup_{(x,y) in K} (px+qy)`.\n\nFor our candidate square `Q` and `c=1`, we need to find the supremum and infimum of `px + qy` for `(x,y)` in `Q`.\nThe extrema of a linear function on a convex polygon occur at its vertices. Let's check the values at the vertices of `Q`:\n- `(1,0)`: `p(1) + q(0) = p`\n- `(0,1)`: `p(0) + q(1) = q`\n- `(-1,0)`: `p(-1) + q(0) = -p`\n- `(0,-1)`: `p(0) + q(-1) = -q`\n\nThe supremum of `px+qy` on `Q` is `sup(p, q, -p, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\nThe infimum of `px+qy` on `Q` is `inf(p, q, -p, -q) = -max(|p|, |q|)`.\n\nSo, `Q` intersects the line `px + qy = 1` if and only if:\n`-max(|p|, |q|) <= 1 <= max(|p|, |q|)`\n\nThis inequality simplifies to `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`.\n\nThe problem states that `p` and `q` are coprime integers. This means they are not both zero.\n- If `p=0`, `q` must be `1` or `-1` for `gcd(0,q)=1`. In this case, `max(|p|, |q|) = 1`.\n- If `q=0`, `p` must be `1` or `-1` for `gcd(p,0)=1`. In this case, `max(|p|, |q|) = 1`.\n- If neither `p` nor `q` is zero, then `|p| >= 1` and `|q| >= 1`, so `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1`.\n\nIn all cases for coprime integers `(p,q)`, the condition `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1` is satisfied. Therefore, the square `Q` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n- We established a lower bound for the area of any such convex domain, which is 2.\n- We found a specific convex domain, the square `|x| + |y| <= 1`, that satisfies the condition.\n- The area of this square is exactly 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal area of such a convex domain is 2."
