No, this approach is not valid. The primary reason is that the visual system of humans is fundamentally different from that of the main predators of bumblebees, such as birds. Birds can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which is often a critical component of bee coloration and warning signals, but is invisible to humans and not captured in standard photographs. Therefore, similarity as judged by humans is not an ecologically relevant proxy for the similarity perceived by predators, which is what actually drives the evolution and function of mimicry syndromes.
