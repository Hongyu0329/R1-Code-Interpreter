    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the Coordinate System\nFirst, we need to define the position of the two cubes in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. For simplicity, let's place the first cube, Cube A, in the first octant with one vertex at the origin.\n*   **Cube A:** This cube is defined by the set of points `(x, y, z)` where `0 <= x <= 1`, `0 <= y <= 1`, and `0 <= z <= 1`.\n*   The side length of Cube A is 1. Its volume is `1^3 = 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Shift\nThe second cube, Cube B, is identical to Cube A but shifted relative to it. We need to determine the displacement vector from the problem statement.\n*   **Shift Direction:** The shift is \"along the main diagonal\". For Cube A positioned at `[0, 1]^3`, the main diagonal connects the vertex `(0, 0, 0)` to the opposite vertex `(1, 1, 1)`. The direction of this diagonal can be represented by the vector `d = (1, 1, 1)`.\n*   **Shift Amount:** The shift is \"by 1/2\". This is the most critical point of interpretation.\n    *   One interpretation is that the magnitude (length) of the shift vector is 1/2. This would lead to a shift vector of `(1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3))`, resulting in a complicated calculation and an irrational answer.\n    *   A more common and geometrically elegant interpretation, especially in contest-style problems, is that the shift components along each axis are 1/2. This means the displacement vector is `v = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. This interpretation creates a special configuration where the corner of one cube is at the center of the other. Let's proceed with this interpretation.\n\nSo, the shift vector is `v = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Position of the Second Cube\nWe find the coordinates of Cube B by adding the shift vector `v` to the coordinates of Cube A.\n*   **Cube B:** A point `(x, y, z)` is in Cube B if it is a shifted point from Cube A. This means Cube B is defined by the inequalities:\n    *   `0 + 1/2 <= x <= 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 <= x <= 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 <= y <= 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 <= y <= 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 <= z <= 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 <= z <= 3/2`\n\n### Step 4: Find the Region of Intersection\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the inequalities for both Cube A and Cube B. We find this by finding the intersection of the coordinate ranges for each axis.\n*   **For the x-axis:** The region must satisfy `0 <= x <= 1` (from Cube A) AND `1/2 <= x <= 3/2` (from Cube B). The common interval is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]`, which is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **For the y-axis:** Similarly, the common interval is `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]`, which is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **For the z-axis:** The common interval is also `[max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)]`, which is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\nThe intersection forms a new, smaller cube.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection\nThe intersection is a cube defined by the inequalities `1/2 <= x <= 1`, `1/2 <= y <= 1`, and `1/2 <= z <= 1`.\n*   **Side Length:** The length of each side of this intersection cube is the length of the coordinate intervals.\n    *   Side length = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   **Volume:** The volume of a cube is the side length cubed.\n    *   Volume = `(1/2)^3 = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Coordinate System:** A simple, axis-aligned setup `[0, 1]^3` is the easiest to work with.\n2.  **Shift Interpretation:** The key is to interpret \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" as a displacement vector of `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. This is the most plausible interpretation for a well-posed problem seeking a clean answer.\n3.  **Intersection Logic:** For axis-aligned boxes, the intersection is found by taking the maximum of the lower bounds and the minimum of the upper bounds for each coordinate independently.\n4.  **Final Shape:** The resulting intersection is itself a cube, making the final volume calculation straightforward.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
