    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figure and his general stance.**\nThe question is about Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian politician, historian, and leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic (Kadet) Party. The prompt states he \"frequently accused the Western culture of his time,\" which sets the context for his critique. Milyukov was a \"Westernizer\" in his political ideals (favoring a constitutional monarchy like Britain's), but he was culturally conservative, holding a strong belief in the 19th-century traditions of realism in art and literature.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the specific accusation.**\nMilyukov is quoted as denouncing \"X-Ys as a 'stagnant swamp'.\" The metaphor \"stagnant swamp\" suggests something lifeless, decaying, unproductive, and corrupt. It's a term of extreme contempt, implying a lack of forward movement or healthy development.\n\n**Step 3: Connect Milyukov to specific cultural critiques.**\nHistorical records and Milyukov's own writings show that he was a fierce public critic of the new artistic and literary movements that flourished in Russia at the turn of the 20th century. This period is known as the Russian \"Silver Age.\" These new movements, including Symbolism, Decadence, and Futurism, were part of a broader European modernist trend. They broke away from the tradition of social realism that Milyukov admired.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the target \"X-Y\".**\nMilyukov's criticism was particularly aimed at the artists and writers who he felt were detached from reality and social purpose. He often grouped the leading figures of these new movements under two main labels: the Decadents and the Symbolists. From his traditionalist viewpoint, their focus on mysticism, individualism, aestheticism for its own sake, and non-representational forms was a sign of cultural decay, not progress. He saw them as a negative influence imported from the West, representing the \"swamp\" of modern European culture. Therefore, the term \"X-Ys\" which he denounced refers to this combined group.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the identity of \"X-Y\".**\nCombining the two primary targets of Milyukov's cultural condemnation gives us the term \"Decadent-Symbolists.\" This hyphenated term accurately represents the group he saw as a \"stagnant swamp\" within contemporary culture.\n\n<<<Decadent-Symbolists>>>"
