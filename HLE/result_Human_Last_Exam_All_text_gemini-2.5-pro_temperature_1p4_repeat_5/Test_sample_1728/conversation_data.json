    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Graph G**\n\n*   **The components:** The graph G is built from three cycles of length `n`, let's call them `C_n_1`, `C_n_2`, and `C_n_3`. A cycle `C_n` is a graph with `n` vertices and `n` edges, where the vertices can be arranged in a circle. We will assume `n >= 3`, which is the standard definition for a simple cycle graph.\n*   **The operation \"sum\":** In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs, often denoted by `+`, refers to the **graph join** operation. The join of two graphs `G1` and `G2` is created by taking the disjoint union of their vertex sets and adding all possible edges between the vertices of `G1` and the vertices of `G2`.\n*   **Structure of G:** The graph `G = C_n_1 + C_n_2 + C_n_3` is formed by taking three disjoint n-cycles and adding an edge between every vertex of `C_n_i` and every vertex of `C_n_j` for all `i != j`. This means that if you pick any three vertices `v1` from `C_n_1`, `v2` from `C_n_2`, and `v3` from `C_n_3`, they will form a triangle in `G`.\n\n**2. Finding the Chromatic Number of G**\n\nThe problem asks for the chromatic number of G, denoted as `χ(G)`.\n\n*   **Property of Graph Join:** A key property of the graph join operation is that the chromatic number of the resulting graph is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the original graphs.\n    *   `χ(G1 + G2) = χ(G1) + χ(G2)`\n*   **Applying the property to G:** Since `G` is the join of three cycles `C_n`, we can extend this property:\n    *   `χ(G) = χ(C_n_1) + χ(C_n_2) + χ(C_n_3)`\n    *   As all three cycles have the same length `n`, their chromatic numbers are identical: `χ(C_n_1) = χ(C_n_2) = χ(C_n_3) = χ(C_n)`.\n    *   Therefore, `χ(G) = 3 * χ(C_n)`.\n\n**3. Determining the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (χ(C_n))**\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle `C_n` depends on whether `n` is even or odd.\n\n*   **Case 1: n is even (n ≥ 4)**\n    *   An even cycle is a bipartite graph. Its vertices can be colored using only two colors by alternating them around the cycle (e.g., color 1, color 2, color 1, ...).\n    *   Therefore, if `n` is even, `χ(C_n) = 2`.\n*   **Case 2: n is odd (n ≥ 3)**\n    *   An odd cycle is not bipartite. If you try to color it with two colors, you will find that the first and last vertices, which are adjacent, must have the same color. Thus, at least three colors are required. A 3-coloring is always possible.\n    *   Therefore, if `n` is odd, `χ(C_n) = 3`.\n\n**4. Calculating the Possible Values for χ(G)**\n\nNow we can calculate the chromatic number of `G` based on whether `n` is even or odd.\n\n*   **If n is even:**\n    *   `χ(G) = 3 * χ(C_n) = 3 * 2 = 6`.\n*   **If n is odd:**\n    *   `χ(G) = 3 * χ(C_n) = 3 * 3 = 9`.\n\n**5. Finding the Maximal Chromatic Number**\n\nThe question asks for the \"maximal\" chromatic number of `G`. This means we need to find the largest possible value that `χ(G)` can take, considering all possible values of `n` (where `n >= 3`).\n\n*   The possible values for `χ(G)` are 6 (for even `n`) and 9 (for odd `n`).\n*   The maximum of these two values is 9.\n\nThis maximum value is achieved for any graph `G` where the length of the cycles, `n`, is an odd number (e.g., `G = C_3 + C_3 + C_3` or `G = C_5 + C_5 + C_5`).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the maximal chromatic number of the graph G is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
