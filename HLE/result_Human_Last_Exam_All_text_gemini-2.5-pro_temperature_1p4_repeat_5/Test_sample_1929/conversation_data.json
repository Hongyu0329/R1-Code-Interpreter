    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (more specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH2=CH-CH=CH2. This is a conjugated diene, which is a molecule containing two double bonds separated by a single bond.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl2=CF2. This is a substituted alkene.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and an alkene is a classic example of a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, where the 4 π-electrons from the diene and the 2 π-electrons from the alkene (called the **dienophile**) react to form a six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Role of Each Reactant**\n*   **Diene (Butadiene):** For the Diels-Alder reaction to occur, the diene must be in the **s-cis conformation** (where the double bonds are on the same side of the central single bond). 1,3-butadiene can easily rotate into this conformation. It provides the 4π electron system.\n*   **Dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene):** This alkene provides the 2π electron system. Diels-Alder reactions are favored when the dienophile has electron-withdrawing groups attached to the double bond. In this case, the fluorine and chlorine atoms are highly electronegative and act as strong electron-withdrawing groups, making CCl2=CF2 a highly reactive dienophile.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the Mechanism and Product Formation**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction is a **concerted reaction**, meaning all bond-making and bond-breaking occurs in a single, concerted step through a cyclic transition state.\n1.  The two terminal carbons (C1 and C4) of the diene form new single (σ) bonds with the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond.\n2.  The double bond in the dienophile becomes a single bond.\n3.  The two double bonds in the diene are converted into one single bond and one new double bond between the central carbons (C2 and C3) of the original diene.\nThis process results in the formation of a six-membered ring, which is a derivative of cyclohexene.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Structure of the Product and Consider Regiochemistry**\n*   **Structure:** The product will be a cyclohexene ring. Two adjacent carbons of the ring will be the substituted carbons from the dienophile, one bearing two chlorine atoms (-CCl2-) and the other bearing two fluorine atoms (-CF2-). The other four carbons of the ring come from butadiene, with a double bond between the two central carbons.\n*   **Careful Point (Regiochemistry):** Regiochemistry refers to the orientation of the addition. The diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical, but the dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) is not. However, because the diene is symmetrical, there is only one possible product regardless of which end of the dienophile attacks which end of the diene. Attaching the CCl2 group to C1 of butadiene and the CF2 group to C4 results in the exact same molecule as attaching the CCl2 group to C4 and the CF2 group to C1 (the molecule can be flipped over to show they are identical). Therefore, there is only one regioisomer formed.\n\n**Step 5: Name the Product using IUPAC Nomenclature**\n1.  **Parent Ring:** The product is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so its parent name is **cyclohexene**.\n2.  **Numbering:** The carbons of the double bond are numbered 1 and 2. We then number the rest of the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants). In this product, the substituted carbons are at positions 4 and 5 relative to the double bond.\n3.  **Substituents:** The substituents are two chlorine atoms (dichloro) and two fluorine atoms (difluoro).\n4.  **Final Name Assembly:**\n    *   Substituents are listed in alphabetical order: **chloro** comes before **fluoro**.\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the alphabetically first substituent should be given the lower number. Therefore, the carbon with the two chlorine atoms is assigned position 4, and the carbon with the two fluorine atoms is assigned position 5.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\nThe final product of the reaction is a stable six-membered ring compound.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
