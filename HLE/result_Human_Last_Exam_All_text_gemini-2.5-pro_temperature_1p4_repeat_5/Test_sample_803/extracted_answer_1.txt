The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the generalized dihedral groups `Dih(Q) = Q ⋊ C₂`, where `Q` is any abelian group of order `q^m` and the semidirect product is defined by the C₂ generator acting as inversion on `Q` (i.e., `xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹` for all `a ∈ Q`). The distinct isomorphism classes of these groups correspond one-to-one with the distinct isomorphism classes of abelian groups `Q` of order `q^m`, which are classified by the partitions of `m`.
