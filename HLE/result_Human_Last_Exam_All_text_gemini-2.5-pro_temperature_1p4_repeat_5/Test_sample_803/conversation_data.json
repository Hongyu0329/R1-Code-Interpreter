    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's clarify the key terms in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set**: A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `S`. A crucial consequence is that the identity element `e` cannot be in any product-free set `S` (since if `e ∈ S`, then `e * e = e` would be in `S`, a contradiction). Also, if `x ∈ S`, then `x² ∉ S`.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set**: A product-free set `S` is maximal (by inclusion) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **A Set that Fills a Group**: A subset `S` of `G` fills `G` if `G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {e}`, where `S⁻¹ = {s⁻¹ | s ∈ S}`. Since `e ∉ S`, this is a partition of `G` into three disjoint sets: `{e}`, `S`, and `S⁻¹`. This implies that for every non-identity element `g ∈ G`, either `g ∈ S` or `g⁻¹ ∈ S`, but not both (unless `g = g⁻¹`, which is a special case we don't need to resolve here as the union notation handles it).\n*   **Filled Group**: A group `G` is called filled if *every* maximal product-free set in `G` fills `G`. This is a very strong condition on the group's structure.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Structure of a Group of Order `2q^m`\n\nLet `G` be a group of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number (`m ≥ 1`).\n\n*   **Sylow Subgroups**: According to Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow q-subgroups, `n_q`, must satisfy `n_q | 2` and `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)`.\n    *   Since `q` is an odd prime, `q ≥ 3`.\n    *   If `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)`, then `n_q` could be `1, 1+q, 1+2q, ...`.\n    *   Since `n_q` must also divide 2, `n_q` can only be 1 or 2.\n    *   `1+q` is greater than 2 for `q ≥ 3`, so the only possibility is `n_q = 1`.\n*   **Normal Subgroup**: Having only one Sylow q-subgroup means this subgroup is normal in `G`. Let's call this subgroup `Q`. We have `|Q| = q^m`.\n*   Let `P` be a Sylow 2-subgroup. `|P| = 2`. `P` is isomorphic to `C₂`, the cyclic group of order 2.\n*   **Semidirect Product**: Since `Q` is a normal subgroup and `Q ∩ P = {e}`, the group `G` is a semidirect product of `Q` and `P`. We can write `G = Q ⋊ P`.\n*   **Nonabelian Condition**: The problem states that `G` is nonabelian. This means the semidirect product must be non-trivial. The action of the non-identity element of `P` on `Q` by conjugation must be a non-identity automorphism of `Q`.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Characterization of Filled Groups\n\nThere is a known theorem that provides a complete characterization of finite filled groups.\n\n**Theorem**: A finite group `G` is filled if and only if one of the following holds:\n1.  `G` is an elementary abelian 2-group (i.e., isomorphic to `(C₂)ⁿ` for some `n`).\n2.  `G = H ⋊ C₂`, where `H` is an abelian group of odd order, and the non-identity element of `C₂` acts on `H` by inversion (i.e., `h ↦ h⁻¹` for all `h ∈ H`).\n\nLet's apply this theorem to our group `G` of order `2q^m`.\n\n*   The order of `G` is `2q^m`. Since `q` is an odd prime, the order is not a power of 2. Therefore, `G` cannot be an elementary abelian 2-group. This rules out case (1).\n*   `G` must therefore fall into case (2). We already established that `G = Q ⋊ P` where `|Q|=q^m` and `P ≅ C₂`.\n    *   For `G` to be filled, the subgroup `Q` must correspond to `H` in the theorem. The order of `Q` is `q^m`, which is odd. This is consistent.\n    *   The theorem requires that `H` (our `Q`) must be an **abelian group**.\n    *   The theorem requires that the action of `P` (`≅ C₂`) on `Q` must be by **inversion**. If we let `P = {e, x}`, this means the action is defined by `xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹` for all `a ∈ Q`.\n\nThis structure defines a **generalized dihedral group**, often denoted `Dih(Q)`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Identification of the Groups\n\nWe need to find all **nonabelian** filled groups of order `2q^m`.\n\nBased on the analysis above, a group `G` of order `2q^m` is filled if and only if `G ≅ Dih(Q) = Q ⋊ C₂` for some **abelian group** `Q` of order `q^m`.\n\nIs this group `G` nonabelian?\nThe product is non-commutative if there is some `a ∈ Q` such that `xax⁻¹ ≠ a`. The action is `xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹`. So we need an element `a` such that `a⁻¹ ≠ a`, which is equivalent to `a² ≠ e`. Since `Q` is an abelian group of odd order `q^m`, the order of any non-identity element must be a power of `q`, which is odd. Thus, no non-identity element has order 2. So, for any `a ∈ Q` with `a ≠ e`, we have `a² ≠ e`. This confirms that the group `G = Dih(Q)` is nonabelian for any non-trivial abelian group `Q` (i.e., for `m ≥ 1`).\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are precisely the generalized dihedral groups formed over an abelian group `Q` of order `q^m`.\n\nTo list all such groups, we must list all possible structures for the abelian group `Q`. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, any abelian group of order `q^m` is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups:\n`Q ≅ C_{q^{m_1}} × C_{q^{m_2}} × ... × C_{q^{m_k}}`\nwhere `m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_k = m` is a partition of the integer `m`.\n\nEach distinct isomorphism class of abelian groups `Q` of order `q^m` gives a distinct isomorphism class of the resulting group `G = Dih(Q)`. The number of such groups is therefore equal to `p(m)`, the number of partitions of `m`.\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups `G` of order `2q^m`, for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m`, are precisely the groups that can be constructed as follows:\n1.  Choose an abelian group `Q` of order `q^m`. The structure of `Q` is determined by a partition `m = m_1 + ... + m_k`, giving `Q ≅ C_{q^{m_1}} × ... × C_{q^{m_k}}`.\n2.  Construct the semidirect product `G = Q ⋊ C₂`, where `C₂` is the cyclic group of order 2, and the action of the non-identity element of `C₂` on `Q` is inversion (`a ↦ a⁻¹` for all `a ∈ Q`).\n\nThese groups are known as the **generalized dihedral groups** over `Q`.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the generalized dihedral groups `Dih(Q) = Q ⋊ C₂`, where `Q` is any abelian group of order `q^m` and the semidirect product is defined by the C₂ generator acting as inversion on `Q` (i.e., `xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹` for all `a ∈ Q`). The distinct isomorphism classes of these groups correspond one-to-one with the distinct isomorphism classes of abelian groups `Q` of order `q^m`, which are classified by the partitions of `m`.>>>"
