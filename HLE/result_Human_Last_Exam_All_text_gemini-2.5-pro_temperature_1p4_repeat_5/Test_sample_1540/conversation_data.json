    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory used by its variables.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring the case of the letters. The strings are guaranteed to have the same length.\n2.  **Input:** Two lines of input, each containing a string.\n    *   String length: 1 to 100 characters.\n    *   Content: Uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n3.  **Comparison Logic:** Lexicographical comparison means comparing the strings character by character from left to right. The first position where the characters differ determines which string is \"smaller\".\n4.  **Case-Insensitivity:** Before comparing characters, they must be converted to a common case (e.g., all lowercase). The C function `tolower()` from `<ctype.h>` is suitable for this.\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n\n### Identifying the Most Memory-Efficient Approach\n\nA naive approach would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays (e.g., `char s1[101]` and `char s2[101]`) and then iterate through them. This would require `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the string buffers.\n\nA more memory-efficient approach avoids storing both strings simultaneously. Since the input strings are on separate lines, we must read the first string completely before we can read the second. This means we *must* store the first string in memory. However, we can process the second string character by character as we read it, comparing it immediately against the corresponding character of the stored first string.\n\nThis leads to the following memory-efficient algorithm:\n1.  Declare a character array to store the first string.\n2.  Read the first string from the input into this array.\n3.  Read the second string one character at a time using `getchar()`.\n4.  For each character read from the second string, compare its lowercase version with the lowercase version of the character at the same position in the stored first string.\n5.  If a difference is found, print the result (-1 or 1) and exit.\n6.  If the end of the second string is reached without any difference, the strings are equal. Print 0.\n\n### Careful Points for Implementation and Memory Calculation\n\n1.  **Buffer Size:** The maximum string length is 100. To store a C string of length 100, an array of size 101 is needed to accommodate the null terminator (`\\0`). So, `char s1[101];` is required.\n2.  **Input Function for Second String:** `getchar()` is the ideal function for reading the second string character by character.\n3.  **`getchar()` Return Type:** `getchar()` returns an `int`, not a `char`. This is crucial because it needs to return a special value `EOF` (End Of File) which is outside the range of `char`. Therefore, the variable holding the result of `getchar()` must be an `int`.\n4.  **Loop Index Variable:** A variable is needed to keep track of the current position (index) in the strings. Since the length is at most 100, this index will range from 0 to 99. The smallest integer type that can hold this range is `char` or `unsigned char` (1 byte), which is more memory-efficient than a standard `int` (which is typically 4 bytes).\n5.  **Data Type Sizes:** For calculating total memory, we assume standard sizes on a typical 32/64-bit competitive programming platform:\n    *   `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte\n    *   `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Variable-by-Variable Memory Calculation\n\nBased on the most memory-efficient approach, let's list the necessary variables and their minimum memory footprint.\n\n1.  **Buffer for the first string:** To store the first string of up to 100 characters plus a null terminator.\n    *   Declaration: `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory: 101 * `sizeof(char)` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Loop index:** To iterate through the strings. The index goes up to 100.\n    *   Declaration: `unsigned char i;` (or `char i;`)\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Character from second string:** To hold the return value of `getchar()`.\n    *   Declaration: `int c;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\nThese are all the variables required to implement the logic. No other variables are necessary.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation:**\nSumming the memory usage of all variables:\nm = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `c`)\nm = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 4 bytes\nm = **106 bytes**\n\n<<<106>>>"
