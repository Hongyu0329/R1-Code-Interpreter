    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Event:** The \"Second Great War\" (also known as the \"End War\") is the primary conflict depicted in the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, *Legacy of the Void*) and its epilogue, *Into the Void*.\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date:** The war officially begins with the resurgence of the Zerg Swarm and their invasion of Terran Dominion worlds. This is the opening event of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*. According to the official StarCraft timeline, this occurs in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date:** The war concludes with the final and permanent defeat of the dark god Amon. While the main campaign of *Legacy of the Void* ends in 2505 with the reclamation of Aiur, the conflict is not truly over. The epilogue, *Into the Void*, details the final hunt for Amon's essence. According to the official *StarCraft: Field Manual*, a canon lore source, Amon was ultimately defeated in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration:**\n    *   Start Year: 2504\n    *   End Year: 2506\n    *   The war began at some point *within* the year 2504 and ended at some point *within* the year 2506. This means the conflict spanned across three separate calendar years.\n    *   The total duration includes a portion of the year 2504, all of the year 2505, and a portion of the year 2506.\n\n5.  **Round the Duration Up as Requested:**\n    *   The total duration is calculated as: `(Time in 2504) + (Full Year of 2505) + (Time in 2506)`.\n    *   This gives a total duration of `(a fraction of a year) + 1 year + (a fraction of a year)`.\n    *   Since the war spans across three calendar years and the *StarCraft: Field Manual* describes it as having \"lasted for years\" (plural), the duration must be at least two full years.\n    *   It is statistically very improbable that the war's duration was exactly 2.0 years (e.g., starting on May 10, 2504, and ending on May 10, 2506). It is far more likely that the duration was 2 years plus some additional months or days.\n    *   Any duration that is greater than 2.0 years (e.g., 2.1 years, or 2 years and 1 day) must be rounded up to the next whole number.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Official Sources:** The timeline relies on official sources like the games themselves and the *StarCraft: Field Manual*, which explicitly places the end of the war in 2506.\n*   **Distinguishing Campaign End from War End:** It is important not to confuse the end of the *Legacy of the Void* main campaign (2505) with the definitive end of the war against Amon (*Into the Void* epilogue, 2506).\n*   **\"Rounding Up\" Interpretation:** The instruction to \"round up\" means that any fractional year duration must be rounded to the next highest integer. A duration of 2.01 years rounds up to 3, while a duration of exactly 2.0 years would round up to 2. The former is a much more probable scenario for a historical conflict.\n\n### Final Calculation\nThe war started in 2504 and ended in 2506. This results in a duration that is certainly greater than one year and, based on the evidence, greater than two years. When rounding any duration over 2.0 years up, the result is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
