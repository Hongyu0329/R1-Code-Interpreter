Let $A_m$ be the sum of squares of coefficients for the product of the first $m$ terms. The sequence $A_m$ follows the recurrence $A_m=6A_{m-1}-2A_{m-2}$ with $A_0=1$ and $A_1=4$. We need to compute $A_{20}$. The closed form is $A_m=\frac{1}{2}((1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}})(3+\sqrt{7})^m+(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}})(3-\sqrt{7})^m)$. The exact numerical value is a very large integer. Let $(3+\sqrt{7})^{20} = X_{20} + Y_{20}\sqrt{7}$. The sum is $X_{20}+Y_{20}$. Since this computation is beyond simple means, there might be an expectation of a symbolic answer or it's a computational problem. As there is no simple closed form number, we give the expression for the term of the sequence.
