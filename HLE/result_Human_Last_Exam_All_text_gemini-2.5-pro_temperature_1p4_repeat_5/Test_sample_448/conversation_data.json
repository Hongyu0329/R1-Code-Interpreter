    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nFirst, we must identify the elements that belong to the noble gas group (Group 18) of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n(Note: Oganesson (Og) is also a Group 18 element but is a synthetic, superheavy element that does not occur naturally on Earth, so it is not considered in this analysis).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Metric for Rarity**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas as a \"percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we need to consider the total amount of each gas present on the entire Earth (atmosphere, crust, oceans, etc.) at a given time. For gases, the most significant and easily comparable reservoir is the atmosphere, but we must also consider if abundances elsewhere could change the final ranking. The data for these abundances was well-established by 2002 and has not fundamentally changed.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas**\nLet's compare the abundance of each noble gas, primarily using their concentration in the Earth's atmosphere, which is their main reservoir. Abundances are typically given in parts per million (ppm) by volume.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** The most abundant of the noble gases, making up about 0.934% (or 9,340 ppm) of the Earth's atmosphere.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant, with a concentration of about 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** The third most abundant, with a concentration of about 5.2 ppm. Although continuously produced in the Earth's crust by radioactive decay, its low mass allows it to escape into space, limiting its atmospheric concentration.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Much rarer than the previous three, with an atmospheric concentration of about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** The rarest of the *stable* noble gases. Its atmospheric concentration is extremely low, at about 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Special Case of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is different from the others because it is radioactive. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Production and Decay:** Radon is continuously generated in the Earth's crust through the radioactive decay of Radium-226 (which is part of the decay chain of Uranium-238).\n*   **Accumulation:** Because Radon decays so quickly, it cannot accumulate in the atmosphere or crust to any significant degree. Its concentration represents a steady-state balance between its constant production and its rapid decay.\n*   **Concentration:** As a result, its average concentration in the atmosphere is infinitesimally small, estimated at about 1 part in 10^21, which is equivalent to 1 x 10^-15 ppm. This is many orders of magnitude lower than Xenon's 0.09 ppm.\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Conclude**\nLet's order the noble gases from most abundant to least abundant based on their presence in terrestrial matter (primarily the atmosphere):\n\n1.  Argon (Ar) - ~9,340 ppm\n2.  Neon (Ne) - ~18.2 ppm\n3.  Helium (He) - ~5.2 ppm\n4.  Krypton (Kr) - ~1.1 ppm\n5.  Xenon (Xe) - ~0.09 ppm\n6.  **Radon (Rn)** - ~1 x 10^-15 ppm\n\nEven considering the Radon present in the Earth's crust and groundwater, its extremely short half-life ensures that the total amount existing on Earth at any single moment is vanishingly small compared to any other noble gas. Therefore, Radon is conclusively the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The distinction between stable gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and the radioactive gas (Rn) is crucial.\n*   Rarity is determined by the amount present at any given time (steady-state concentration), not the total amount ever produced over geological time.\n*   The key factor for Radon's rarity is its short half-life, which prevents it from accumulating.\n*   The specific year 2002 does not change the answer, as the relative abundances of these gases are governed by long-term geological and physical processes that are stable on human timescales.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
