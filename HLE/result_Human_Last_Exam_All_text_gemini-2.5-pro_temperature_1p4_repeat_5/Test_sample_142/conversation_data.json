    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the total number of electrons (N).**\nThe number of electrons in a neutral molecule is the sum of the atomic numbers of its constituent atoms.\nThe molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$, which contains:\n*   1 Carbon (C), Atomic Number = 6\n*   3 Hydrogen (H), Atomic Number = 1\n*   1 Silicon (Si), Atomic Number = 14\n*   1 Fluorine (F), Atomic Number = 9\n\nTotal number of electrons, N = 6 + (3 × 1) + 14 + 9 = **32 electrons**.\n\nFor a full CI calculation, we are typically interested in a specific spin state. For a molecule with an even number of electrons like this one, the ground state is a singlet state (total spin, S=0). In this state, the number of alpha-spin electrons ($N_{\\alpha}$) equals the number of beta-spin electrons ($N_{\\beta}$).\n$N_{\\alpha} = N_{\\beta} = N/2 = 32/2 = 16$.\n\n**2. Determine the total number of basis functions (K).**\nThe number of basis functions corresponds to the number of spatial orbitals. This depends on the chosen basis set, 6-31G**.\n\n*   **6-31G**: A split-valence basis set.\n*   **\\*\\***: Indicates polarization functions. The first `*` adds d-type functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms, and the second `*` adds p-type functions to hydrogen atoms. We will assume the standard spherical harmonic versions of these functions (5d and 3p).\n\nLet's count the basis functions for each atom:\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 1s orbital is split into two basis functions.\n    *   The `**` adds one set of p-functions (p_x, p_y, p_z), which is 3 functions.\n    *   Total per H atom = 2 + 3 = 5 functions.\n    *   For 3 H atoms: 3 × 5 = **15 functions**.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (2nd-row atoms):**\n    *   The 6-31G basis provides 9 functions (1 for 1s core, and 4+4 for the split 2s2p valence shell).\n    *   The `*` adds one set of d-functions (5 functions).\n    *   Total per C or F atom = 9 + 5 = **14 functions**.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si) (3rd-row atom):**\n    *   The 6-31G basis for a third-row atom provides 13 functions (representing the 1s, 2s, 2p core and the split 3s3p valence shell).\n    *   The `*` adds one set of d-functions (5 functions).\n    *   Total per Si atom = 13 + 5 = **18 functions**.\n\nTotal number of basis functions, K = (3 H × 5) + (1 C × 14) + (1 F × 14) + (1 Si × 18)\nK = 15 + 14 + 14 + 18 = **61 spatial orbitals**.\n\n**3. Choose the correct formula for the number of CSFs.**\nThe number of CSFs for a given number of electrons (N), spatial orbitals (K), and total spin (S) can be calculated using the Weyl-Paldus formula. An equivalent and often more direct formula for the number of singlet states (S=0) is the \"difference formula\":\n\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2-1}\\binom{K}{N/2+1}$\n\n**4. Calculate the number of CSFs.**\nUsing the values we determined:\n*   K = 61\n*   N = 32\n*   S = 0\n*   N/2 = 16\n\nThe formula becomes:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{61}{16}^2 - \\binom{61}{15}\\binom{61}{17}$\n\nNow, we evaluate the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{61}{15} = \\frac{61!}{15! \\cdot (61-15)!} = 662,589,255,877,860$\n*   $\\binom{61}{16} = \\frac{61!}{16! \\cdot (61-16)!} = 1,905,031,604,554,823$\n*   $\\binom{61}{17} = \\frac{61!}{17! \\cdot (61-17)!} = 4,800,079,549,392,055$\n\nNext, we substitute these values into the formula:\n*   Term 1: $(\\binom{61}{16})^2 = (1,905,031,604,554,823)^2 = 3,629,144,120,387,531,998,525,044,429$\n*   Term 2: $\\binom{61}{15} \\times \\binom{61}{17} = 662,589,255,877,860 \\times 4,800,079,549,392,055 = 3,180,479,705,910,399,119,283,737,300$\n\nFinally, we find the difference:\n$N_{CSF} = 3,629,144,120,387,531,998,525,044,429 - 3,180,479,705,910,399,119,283,737,300$\n$N_{CSF} = 448,664,414,477,132,879,241,307,129$\n\nThis astronomically large number illustrates why Full CI is computationally intractable for all but the smallest molecules and basis sets.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<448664414477132879241307129>>>"
