The optimal combination is a Zirconium (Zr) metal center complexed with a constrained-geometry ligand (CGC), which features a linked cyclopentadienyl-amido framework, and is heterogenized by grafting onto a high-surface-area silica (SiO2) support. This design is optimal because: 1) Zirconium provides a balance of high reactivity for polymerization and the ability to perform bond activation. 2) The constrained-geometry ligand creates a uniquely open and electrophilic active site, which is sterically capable of both accommodating olefin monomers for polymerization and accessing the inert C-C bonds within a polymer chain for hydrogenolysis. 3) The silica support provides essential thermal stability for the high-temperature hydrogenolysis process and ensures catalyst longevity and reusability through site isolation.
