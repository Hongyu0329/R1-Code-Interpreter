    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that fit inside a cube of edge length 15.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem and find the theoretical maximum\n*   We have a large cube with dimensions 15 x 15 x 15.\n*   We have small blocks (cuboids) with dimensions 9 x 1 x 1.\n*   The goal is to find the maximum number of blocks that can be placed inside the cube without overlapping.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volumes to find an absolute upper limit.\n*   Volume of the cube = 15 × 15 × 15 = 3375 cubic units.\n*   Volume of one block = 9 × 1 × 1 = 9 cubic units.\n\nThe theoretical maximum number of blocks is the ratio of the volumes:\n*   Theoretical Maximum = Volume of cube / Volume of block = 3375 / 9 = 375.\n\nThis means it is impossible to fit more than 375 blocks. However, this assumes perfect packing with no wasted space, which is not always possible due to geometric constraints.\n\n### Step 2: Check for perfect packing feasibility\nA box of dimensions L × M × N can be perfectly tiled by blocks of size k × 1 × 1 only if k divides at least one of L, M, or N.\n*   In our case, the box is 15 × 15 × 15 and the block is 9 × 1 × 1.\n*   The length of the block is k=9. The dimensions of the cube are L=M=N=15.\n*   We check if 9 divides 15. It does not (15 / 9 = 1 with a remainder of 6).\n*   Since 9 does not divide 15, a perfect packing is impossible. The maximum number of blocks must be less than 375.\n\n### Step 3: Develop a practical packing strategy\nWe can try to fill the cube using a systematic, layer-by-layer approach, changing the orientation of the blocks to fit them into the remaining spaces. This is a \"greedy\" approach that aims to fill the space as efficiently as possible at each stage.\n\n**Stage 1: First Orientation**\n*   Let's align the 9-unit length of the blocks with the first dimension (x-axis) of the 15x15x15 cube.\n*   Number of blocks along the x-axis = floor(15 / 9) = 1.\n*   Number of blocks along the y-axis = floor(15 / 1) = 15.\n*   Number of blocks along the z-axis = floor(15 / 1) = 15.\n*   Number of blocks in this stage = 1 × 15 × 15 = **225 blocks**.\n*   This arrangement occupies a volume of 9 × 15 × 15. The remaining volume is (15 - 9) × 15 × 15, which is a slab of size **6 × 15 × 15**.\n\n**Stage 2: Second Orientation**\n*   Now we try to fill the remaining 6 × 15 × 15 space.\n*   We cannot align the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 6-unit dimension. We must use one of the 15-unit dimensions. Let's align the 9-unit length with the y-axis.\n*   Number of blocks along the 6-unit dimension (x-axis) = floor(6 / 1) = 6.\n*   Number of blocks along the 15-unit dimension (y-axis) = floor(15 / 9) = 1.\n*   Number of blocks along the 15-unit dimension (z-axis) = floor(15 / 1) = 15.\n*   Number of blocks in this stage = 6 × 1 × 15 = **90 blocks**.\n*   This arrangement occupies a volume of 6 × 9 × 15 from the remaining space. The new remaining volume is 6 × (15 - 9) × 15, which is a slab of size **6 × 6 × 15**.\n\n**Stage 3: Third Orientation**\n*   Now we try to fill the remaining 6 × 6 × 15 space.\n*   The only dimension that can accommodate the 9-unit length is the 15-unit one. Let's align the 9-unit length with the z-axis.\n*   Number of blocks along the 6-unit dimension (x-axis) = floor(6 / 1) = 6.\n*   Number of blocks along the 6-unit dimension (y-axis) = floor(6 / 1) = 6.\n*   Number of blocks along the 15-unit dimension (z-axis) = floor(15 / 9) = 1.\n*   Number of blocks in this stage = 6 × 6 × 1 = **36 blocks**.\n*   This arrangement occupies a volume of 6 × 6 × 9. The final remaining volume is 6 × 6 × (15 - 9), which is a cube of size **6 × 6 × 6**.\n\n**Stage 4: Analyze Remaining Space**\n*   The leftover space is a 6 × 6 × 6 cube.\n*   A 9 × 1 × 1 block cannot fit into this space because its longest dimension (9) is larger than any dimension of the remaining space (6).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total number of blocks\nBy summing the blocks from each stage, we get the total number of blocks that can be packed using this method.\n*   Total blocks = 225 (from Stage 1) + 90 (from Stage 2) + 36 (from Stage 3)\n*   Total blocks = **351**\n\nThis constructive proof shows that it is possible to fit 351 blocks. This specific packing strategy consolidates all the wasted space into a single 6x6x6 cube, which is an efficient way to minimize unusable space. It is the optimal solution for this problem.\n\n<<<351>>>"
