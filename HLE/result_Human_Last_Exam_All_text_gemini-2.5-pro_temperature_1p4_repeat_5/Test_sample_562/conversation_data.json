    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the character 謄.**\nThe character 謄 can be visually broken down into two main components, a left part and a right part:\n*   Left side: ⺼\n*   Right side: 朕\n\nIn Japanese Kanji, the radical (部首, bushu) is the component used for classification in dictionaries. For characters with a left-right structure (偏旁, hen-bō), the radical is very often the left-side component (偏, hen).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the radical and its name.**\nThe left-side component is ⺼. This shape is a variant form of the character 月 (tsuki, moon). However, when used as a radical on the left side, 月 can represent two different original concepts:\n1.  **月 (tsuki):** Meaning \"moon\". When it means moon, the radical is called つきへん (tsukihen). Examples include 明 (bright) and 期 (period).\n2.  **肉 (niku):** Meaning \"flesh\" or \"body part\". When it represents flesh, the radical is called にくづき (nikuzuki). The character 肉 was graphically simplified to look identical to 月 when used as a component. Most kanji with this component relate to the body, organs, or flesh. Examples include 肝 (liver), 腕 (arm), and 脳 (brain).\n\n**Step 3: Determine which radical applies to 謄.**\nAlthough the modern meaning of 謄 is \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which doesn't seem related to the body, it is traditionally classified under the \"flesh\" radical. Dictionaries consistently list ⺼ (にくづき) as the radical for 謄. The right side, 朕, acts as the phonetic component. Therefore, the radical is にくづき.\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the radical's name into Hepburn romanization.**\nThe Japanese name for the radical is にくづき. We transcribe this kana by kana into the Hepburn system:\n*   に -> ni\n*   く -> ku\n*   づ -> zu\n*   き -> ki\n\nCombining these gives \"Nikuzuki\". Note that \"Nikuzuki\" is the complete and standard name for this radical; unlike \"Onnahen\" (女 + hen), \"hen\" is not appended to \"Nikuzuki\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The primary point of confusion is distinguishing between the \"moon\" radical (つきへん, tsukihen) and the \"flesh\" radical (にくづき, nikuzuki), as they are written identically (月 or ⺼). The classification is based on etymology and tradition, not always on the character's modern meaning.\n*   The transcription of づ is \"zu\" in modern standard Hepburn, the same as for ず.\n*   The format of the answer should be just the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name, as specified by the example \"Onnahen\".\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nThe radical of 謄 is ⺼, whose Japanese name is にくづき. The Hepburn transcription of にくづき is Nikuzuki.\n\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
