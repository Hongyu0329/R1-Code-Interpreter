The edges of the image will be smoothed. Iteratively applying the local median filter causes sharp corners and high-curvature sections of an edge to change. Specifically, convex corners of shapes are eroded (rounded off), while concave corners are filled in. This process is analogous to mean curvature flow, which acts to reduce the total length of the boundary. As a result, small or thin shapes will shrink and eventually disappear entirely. The process stops when the image reaches a fixed point, where the remaining shapes are large and their edges have very low curvature (i.e., they are smooth and locally straight).
