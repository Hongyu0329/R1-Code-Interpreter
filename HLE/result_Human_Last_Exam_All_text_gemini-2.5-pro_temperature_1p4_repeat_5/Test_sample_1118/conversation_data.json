    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Painted after an encounter with the Gestapo (or more accurately, the SA, the early Nazi paramilitary force).\n*   **Object of interest:** Something he holds in his hand.\n*   **Meaning:** The object is a symbol of resistance.\n\n**Step 2: Research the specific artwork.**\nThe painting in question is Curt Querner's \"Selbstbildnis II\" (Self-Portrait II), also known as \"Selbstbildnis vor roter Wand\" (Self-Portrait in Front of a Red Wall). It was indeed painted in 1933.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the historical context.**\nIn March 1933, shortly after the Reichstag fire, Querner was arrested and detained by the SA (Sturmabteilung) in Dresden due to his membership in the communist-affiliated Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists (ASSO). He was released after interrogation. This experience of persecution by the new Nazi regime is the direct background for this self-portrait.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the visual details of the painting.**\nIn the portrait, Querner confronts the viewer with a stern, defiant expression. He is positioned in front of a bold red wall, a color strongly associated with his leftist, communist political leanings. In his right hand, he is holding up a small, folded white paper.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the object and its symbolic meaning.**\nArt historians and museum curators identify the small folded paper he holds as his **membership card for the KPD (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands), the Communist Party of Germany**. At a time when membership in the KPD was being brutally suppressed, displaying his party card in a self-portrait was an incredibly courageous and direct act of political defiance. It was a clear statement that he would not renounce his beliefs, even in the face of persecution. The object, therefore, is the ultimate symbol of his resistance.\n\n<<<His Communist Party (KPD) membership card.>>>"
