**1) Hotspots for Interaction with alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain of the human beta-1b subunit (UniProt: P54283) and form the core of the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) binding pocket. They are essential for the high-affinity physical binding to the Cav2.3 alpha-1 subunit.

*   **Y226, M227, V231:** Part of a beta-strand (β7) forming one wall of the binding groove.
*   **W259:** A critical Tryptophan residue located in the center of the hydrophobic pocket. Its mutation typically abolishes the interaction.
*   **A256, V260:** Located on an alpha-helix (α2) adjacent to W259, contributing to the pocket's shape.
*   **L353:** A Leucine on another alpha-helix (α6) that lines the groove.
*   **I387:** An Isoleucine from a beta-strand (β12) forming the base of the pocket.
*   **V404, L406:** Reside on a C-terminal alpha-helix (α7) of the GK domain, completing the binding site.

**2) Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties (Gating Modulation):**

These residues or regions are critical for the allosteric modulation of the alpha-1 subunit's function. They are often located outside the primary interaction pocket.

*   **N-terminal Domain (Residues ~1-30):** This entire intrinsically disordered region acts as a key modulatory hotspot. It does not contain single critical residues but functions as a cassette to strongly influence the kinetics and voltage-dependence of channel inactivation.
*   **SH3 Domain (approx. Residues 78-154):** This domain is a major allosteric modulator, thought to interact with the N-terminus of the alpha-1 subunit to regulate channel activation. Key hotspot residues lie on its conserved protein-binding surface:
    *   **W100 (Tryptophan):** A critical aromatic residue at the core of the SH3 binding surface.
    *   **Y121 (Tyrosine) and Y134 (Tyrosine):** Aromatic residues that form part of the binding interface for proline-rich sequences or other interaction partners.
    *   **P132 (Proline):** Part of a conserved loop crucial for recognizing binding partners.
