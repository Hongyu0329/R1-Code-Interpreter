    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form:**\n    *   The given form is `*seh₂gieti`, meaning '(s)he’s giving a sign' or more broadly 'to track, trace, perceive keenly'.\n    *   The root is `*seh₂g-`. The `-ie-` is a present-tense suffix, and `-ti` is the third-person singular ending.\n    *   The cognates provided, Latin `sāgīre` ('to perceive keenly') and Hittite `sākizzi` ('(s)he gives a sign'), confirm this root and its general semantic field.\n\n2.  **Determine the relevant form for Proto-Germanic:**\n    *   While the question gives an e-grade form (`*seh₂g-`), the actual verb that survives into the Germanic languages with the meaning 'to seek' (a logical extension of 'to track, trace') is derived from a related o-grade causative form. This is a common pattern in Indo-European linguistics.\n    *   The relevant PIE causative form would be `*soh₂g-éye-ti`, meaning 'to cause to track' or 'to try to perceive', which develops into the meaning 'to look for, to seek'.\n\n3.  **Trace from PIE `*soh₂g-éye-ti` to Proto-Germanic (PGmc):**\n    *   **Root Vowel:** The o-grade `*o` combined with the laryngeal `*h₂` (`*oh₂`) becomes a long `*ō` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   **Root Consonants (Grimm's Law):**\n        *   PIE `*s` remains `*s` in PGmc.\n        *   PIE `*g` (a voiced velar stop) becomes `*k` (a voiceless velar stop) in PGmc.\n    *   **Suffix:** The PIE causative suffix `*-eye-` becomes the suffix for Class 1 weak verbs in PGmc, `*-ja-`.\n    *   **Combining the elements:** The PIE root `*soh₂g-` becomes the PGmc root `*sōk-`. Adding the weak verb suffix `*-ja-` and the infinitive ending `*-aną` gives us the Proto-Germanic verb.\n    *   **Proto-Germanic Result:** `*sōkijaną` 'to seek'.\n\n4.  **Trace from Proto-Germanic `*sōkijaną` to daughter languages:**\n\n    *   **Old Norse (ON):**\n        *   The PGmc long vowel `*ō` undergoes **i-umlaut** (or i-mutation) due to the following `*-j-`. `*ō` becomes `œ` (often written `ǿ`).\n        *   The `*k` remains a `k`.\n        *   The `*-j-` is retained after the consonant.\n        *   The infinitive ending `*-aną` reduces to `-a`.\n        *   **Result:** **`sǿkja`** (or `sœkja`)\n\n    *   **Old English (OE):**\n        *   The PGmc long vowel `*ō` undergoes **i-umlaut** from the `*-j-`, becoming `ē`.\n        *   The PGmc consonant `*k` undergoes **palatalization** before the new front vowel `ē` and the following `*-j-`. It becomes the affricate `ċ` (pronounced /tʃ/, like 'ch' in 'church'). The `*-j-` is then absorbed.\n        *   The infinitive ending becomes `-an`.\n        *   **Result:** **`sēċan`**\n\n    *   **Old High German (OHG):**\n        *   The PGmc long vowel `*ō` undergoes **diphthongization**, becoming `uo`. I-umlaut did not consistently affect this new diphthong in the OHG period for this verb class, as the `*-j-` was often lost early after heavy root syllables.\n        *   The PGmc consonant `*k` undergoes the **High German Consonant Shift**. After a vowel, `*k` becomes a long voiceless fricative `hh` (pronounced /xx/, like the 'ch' in Scottish 'loch').\n        *   The infinitive ending is `-an`.\n        *   **Result:** **`suohhen`**\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sǿkja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēċan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sǿkja; Old English: sēċan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
