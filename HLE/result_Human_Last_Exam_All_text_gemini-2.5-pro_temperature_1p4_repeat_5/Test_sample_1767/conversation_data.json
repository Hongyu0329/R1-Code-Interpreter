    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Building Blocks**\n\n*   **Chern Insulator:** A 2D material that is an electrical insulator in its bulk but supports conducting states on its edges.\n*   **Chern Number (C):** A topological invariant, which is an integer that characterizes the bulk of the Chern insulator.\n*   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** This is a fundamental principle connecting the bulk property (Chern number) to the boundary property (number of conducting edge states). The number of net chiral edge states at an interface between two regions, A and B, is given by the difference in their Chern numbers: $N_{edge} = C_A - C_B$. A chiral state is one that propagates in only one direction (e.g., clockwise).\n*   **Our specific case:** We have two Chern insulators, let's call them CI1 and CI2. Both have a Chern number of 1. So, $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$. They are placed next to each other. The surrounding medium is typically vacuum, which can be treated as a trivial insulator with a Chern number of 0 ($C_{vac} = 0$).\n\n**2. Analyze the Additivity of the Chern Number**\n\nThe Chern number is a property of the bulk material, calculated by integrating the Berry curvature (a geometric property of the electronic wavefunctions) over the entire Brillouin zone. When two systems are combined to form a larger system without fundamentally altering their bulk properties, the total Chern number of the composite system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n*   $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2$\n*   In this case, $C_{total} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the combined system, which is the junction of the two Chern insulators, has a bulk topological invariant of C = 2.\n\n**3. Analyze the Interfaces using Bulk-Boundary Correspondence**\n\nNow we can use this total Chern number to understand what happens at the boundaries.\n\n*   **External Boundary (Junction to Vacuum):**\n    *   The combined system has $C_{total} = 2$.\n    *   The vacuum has $C_{vac} = 0$.\n    *   The number of chiral edge states on the outer perimeter of the junction is $N_{external} = C_{total} - C_{vac} = 2 - 0 = 2$.\n    *   This means there will be **two** co-propagating chiral edge states circulating around the outer edge of the combined system.\n\n*   **Internal Interface (between CI1 and CI2):**\n    *   Region 1 has $C_1 = 1$.\n    *   Region 2 has $C_2 = 1$.\n    *   The number of net chiral edge states at the interface between them is $N_{internal} = C_1 - C_2 = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n    *   This means there are no net conducting states at the interface. The condition \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is crucial here. It ensures that the individual edge states that would exist at the boundaries of CI1 and CI2 (one moving up, the other moving down) can interact and \"annihilate\" or \"gap out\", resulting in an insulating interface.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the Chern number *of the junction*. This refers to the Chern number of the combined system as a whole. Based on the additivity principle, the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers. The physical consequences at the edges (2 states on the outside, 0 on the inside) are consistent with this conclusion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing the junction from the interface:** The \"junction\" in this context refers to the entire composite material, not just the line where they meet. An interface has edge states, whereas a bulk material has a Chern number.\n*   **The role of the negligible barrier:** This ensures the interface between the two C=1 materials becomes gapped, which is the expected outcome when two edge states with opposite chirality (velocity) meet.\n*   **Robustness of the additivity rule:** The summation of Chern numbers is a general and robust result for combining topological systems.\n\nThe Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers of its parts.\n\n$C_{junction} = C_{insulator\\_1} + C_{insulator\\_2} = 1 + 1 = 2$\n\n<<<2>>>"
