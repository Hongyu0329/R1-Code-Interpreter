Yes. While the Generality Constraint is typically formulated to govern the recombination of concepts within singular thoughts (e.g., if you can think 'a is F' and 'b is G', you can think 'a is G'), the deeper principle it exemplifies is the compositionality of thought. By understanding 'Fa', the Generality Constraint guarantees that you possess the concept of the predicate 'F' as an independent, recombinable element. Given the separate premise that you also understand the concept of universal quantification (∀), the principle of compositionality dictates that you should be able to combine these two concepts you possess to form the thought '∀x(Fx)'. Therefore, the inference is valid not by the narrowest letter of the GC, but by the fundamental principle of systematicity that motivates it.
