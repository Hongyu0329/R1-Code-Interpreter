No, it is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and the logical-metaphysical framework of Gödel's ontological proof are incommensurable. The core concepts of Gödel's proof, such as "positive property" and "necessity" in the modal logic sense, have no natural or non-arbitrary translation into the language of Hilbert spaces and linear operators. Quantum mechanics is a physical theory designed to model empirical reality, whereas Gödel's proof is an a priori argument in formal logic; attempting to use one to prove the other is a category error.
