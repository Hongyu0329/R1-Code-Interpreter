Two such languages are **Korean** and **Persian (Farsi)**.

1.  **Broom:** The Korean word for broom is **빗자루 (bitjaru)**. The Persian word for broom is **جارو (jâru)**. The second morpheme of the Korean word is strikingly similar to the Persian word.
2.  **Mom:** The informal Korean word for mom is **엄마 (eomma)**. The informal Persian word is **مامان (mâmân)**. Both are classic nursery words for "mother" using the /m/ sound.
3.  **Dad:** The informal Korean word for dad is **아빠 (appa)**. The informal Persian word is **بابا (bâbâ)**. Both are typical nursery words for "father" using reduplicated bilabial stops (/p/, /b/).

These languages are from entirely different language families (Koreanic and Indo-European) and distinct cultural regions of Asia (East and West) with no direct borrowing relationship for these words, making the similarities coincidental.
