    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\n\nLet $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We try to find a factorization of this polynomial.\nLet's rearrange the terms:\n$P(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$P(x) = x(x^6 - 2x^4 - 9x^2 + 18) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nWe can factor the expression in the first parenthesis by grouping:\n$x^6 - 2x^4 - 9x^2 + 18 = x^4(x^2 - 2) - 9(x^2 - 2) = (x^4 - 9)(x^2 - 2)$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $P(x)$:\n$P(x) = x(x^4 - 9)(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nNow, we can factor out the common term $(x^2 - 2)$:\n$P(x) = (x(x^4 - 9) + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n$P(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nSo, the polynomial $P(x)$ is a product of two polynomials: $f(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their splitting fields**\n\n*   **Analysis of f(x) = x^2 - 2:**\n    The roots of $f(x)$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    The splitting field of $f(x)$ is $K_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The degree of this extension is $[K_f : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$, and its Galois group is $Gal(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **Analysis of g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3:**\n    We check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$.\n    1. The leading coefficient, 1, is not divisible by 3.\n    2. All other coefficients, -9 and 3, are divisible by 3.\n    3. The constant term, 3, is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n    Therefore, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    The splitting field of $g(x)$, let's call it $K_g$, is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group $Gal(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of g(x)**\n\nTo determine the Galois group of the irreducible quintic $g(x)$, we can analyze its roots.\nLet's find the number of real roots of $g(x)$ using calculus.\nThe derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$.\nThe critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\nLet $c = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n-   $g(c) = c^5 - 9c + 3 = c(c^4) - 9c + 3 = c(9/5) - 9c + 3 = 3 - \\frac{36}{5}c$. Since $c = \\sqrt[4]{1.8} > 1$, $g(c) < 3 - 7.2 < 0$. This is a local minimum.\n-   $g(-c) = (-c)^5 - 9(-c) + 3 = -c^5 + 9c + 3 = -c(9/5) + 9c + 3 = 3 + \\frac{36}{5}c > 0$. This is a local maximum.\nSince the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ must have three real roots. The other two roots must be a complex conjugate pair.\nA theorem states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group is the symmetric group $S_p$.\nHere, $p=5$, so the Galois group of $g(x)$ is $S_5$.\nThus, $Gal(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$ and $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Galois group of the splitting field K**\n\nThe splitting field $K$ of $P(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its factors: $K = K_f K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) K_g$.\nThe Galois group $G = Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the direct product $Gal(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times Gal(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ if and only if $K_f \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$K_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field.\nThe subfields of $K_g$ are controlled by the subgroups of $S_5$. Quadratic subfields correspond to normal subgroups of index 2. The only normal subgroup of $S_5$ (for $n \\ge 5$) is the alternating group $A_5$, which has index 2.\nThus, $K_g$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^5+ax+b$ is $D = 4^4 a^5 + 5^5 b^4$. For $g(x)=x^5-9x+3$, $a=-9, b=3$.\n$D = 256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\nSince $D < 0$, the quadratic subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is an imaginary quadratic field.\nAs $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is real and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ is imaginary, they are not the same field. Thus, their intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo, the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product:\n$G = Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong Gal(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times Gal(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times S_5| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the possible degrees of intermediate normal extensions**\n\nWe are looking for normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions $L$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to list all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$ (where $C_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$).\nLet $N_1 \\triangleleft C_2$ and $N_2 \\triangleleft S_5$. Then $N_1 \\times N_2$ is a normal subgroup of $C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThis gives the following \"product\" normal subgroups $H = N_1 \\times N_2$:\n1.  $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|H|=60$. $[G:H] = 240/60 = 4$.\n2.  $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|H|=120$. $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n3.  $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H|=2$. $[G:H] = 240/2 = 120$.\n4.  $C_2 \\times A_5$: $|H|=2 \\cdot 60 = 120$. $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nBesides these product subgroups, we must check for \"diagonal\" normal subgroups. Such a subgroup $H$ exists if there is an isomorphism $\\phi: Q_1 \\to Q_2$ between non-trivial quotient groups of the factor groups.\nThe non-trivial quotient groups of $C_2$ is $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$.\nThe non-trivial quotient groups of $S_5$ are $S_5/\\{e\\} \\cong S_5$ and $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$.\nFor an isomorphism to exist, the quotients must be isomorphic. The only possibility is $C_2 \\cong C_2$.\nSo, there exists a diagonal normal subgroup $H_d$ related to the isomorphism $\\phi: C_2/\\{e\\} \\to S_5/A_5$. Let $\\sigma: S_5 \\to S_5/A_5$ be the sign homomorphism (which is onto). The subgroup is $H_d = \\{(c,s) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\phi(c) = \\sigma(s)\\}$.\nThis subgroup consists of pairs $(c,s)$ where $c$ \"matches\" the sign of the permutation $s$.\nIts order is $|A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\nThe index of this subgroup is $[G:H_d] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe possible indices of proper non-trivial normal subgroups are the possible degrees of the intermediate normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe indices we found are: 4, 2, 120, 2, 2.\nThe set of distinct possible degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\nFinal summary of possible degrees:\n-   Degree 2: Corresponds to subgroups $\\{e\\} \\times S_5$, $C_2 \\times A_5$, and the diagonal subgroup $H_d$. These correspond to the fixed fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2D})$ respectively.\n-   Degree 4: Corresponds to the subgroup $\\{e\\} \\times A_5$. This corresponds to the fixed field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{D})$.\n-   Degree 120: Corresponds to the subgroup $C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$. This corresponds to the fixed field $K_g$, the splitting field of $g(x)$.\n\nAll these degrees are possible."
