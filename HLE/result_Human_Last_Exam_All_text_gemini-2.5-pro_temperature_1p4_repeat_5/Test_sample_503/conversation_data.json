    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is a generalization of the concept of an adjoint pair of functors between categories. When the 2-category is locally posetal, meaning the hom-sets are posets, the definition simplifies.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-category.**\n*   **Objects:** The objects of the simplex category $\\Delta$ are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. These are totally ordered sets.\n*   **1-morphisms:** A morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ in $\\Delta$ is a non-decreasing (i.e., order-preserving) map.\n*   **2-morphisms:** $\\Delta$ is viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$ (the 2-category of posets). This means for any two parallel 1-morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a unique 2-morphism $f \\Rightarrow g$ if and only if $f \\le g$ pointwise. That is, $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. The collection of morphisms between $[m]$ and $[n]$ forms a poset $\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\Delta}([m],[n])$.\n\n**Step 2: Define an internal adjunction in this context.**\nAn internal adjunction from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ in $\\Delta$ consists of:\n1.  A pair of 1-morphisms (monotone maps): $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint).\n2.  A unit 2-morphism $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$.\n3.  A counit 2-morphism $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$.\n\nIn this posetal setting, these conditions translate to pointwise inequalities:\n*   The unit condition $\\eta$ means $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$, which simplifies to $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n*   The counit condition $\\epsilon$ means $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [n]$, which simplifies to $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\nThese are precisely the conditions for $(L,R)$ to be a Galois connection between the posets $([m], \\le)$ and $([n], \\le)$. The triangle identities required for an adjunction are automatically satisfied in any posetal 2-category.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps.**\nA key theorem in order theory states that an adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint or the right adjoint.\n*   A monotone map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). Since $[m]$ is a finite, and thus complete, lattice, we must check preservation of all suprema. This includes the supremum of the empty set, which is the bottom element $0 \\in [m]$. Thus, a left adjoint $L$ must satisfy $L(0) = 0$. Since $L$ is monotone, it can be shown that this condition is sufficient.\n*   A monotone map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). This includes the infimum of the empty set, which is the top element $n \\in [n]$. Thus, a right adjoint $R$ must satisfy $R(n) = m$. This condition is also sufficient for a monotone map.\n\nTherefore, the number of adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is equal to the number of monotone maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ with $L(0)=0$. Equivalently, it is the number of monotone maps $R: [n] \\to [m]$ with $R(n)=m$. We can count either of these.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of suitable maps.**\nLet's count the number of monotone maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ such that $L(0)=0$. The question asks for adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$, so we have $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n\nA monotone map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is defined by a sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that:\n$L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$\nThe values $L(i)$ must be in $[37] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThe condition for $L$ to be a left adjoint is $L(0) = 0$. So we are looking for the number of sequences satisfying:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to choosing the $23$ values $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter (as they will be arranged uniquely into a non-decreasing sequence). This is a classic \"stars and bars\" or \"combinations with repetition\" problem.\n\nWe need to choose $k=23$ items (the values of $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from a set of $N=37+1=38$ possible values (the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$).\nThe formula for combinations with repetition is $\\binom{k+N-1}{k}$.\nPlugging in our values, we get:\nNumber of adjunctions = $\\binom{23 + 38 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n**Step 5: Verification (optional but recommended).**\nWe can verify this by counting the right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$. We need to count monotone maps $R$ such that $R(37)=23$. This is a sequence:\n$R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le R(37) = 23$.\nThe values $R(i)$ must be in $[23] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\nWe need to choose the 37 values $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$ with replacement.\nHere, $k=37$ items are chosen from a set of $N=23+1=24$ values.\nThe number is $\\binom{37+24-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\nThe results match.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions in $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<\n$\\binom{60}{23}$\n>>>"
