    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are asked to design an observer for the discrete-time system:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nThe observer estimates the state x(k) with x_hat(k). The observer dynamics are given by:\nx_hat(k+1) = A*x_hat(k) + B*u(k) + L*(y(k) - y_hat(k))\nwhere y_hat(k) = C*x_hat(k) and L is the observer gain matrix.\n\nThe observation error is e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k). The error dynamics are derived as:\ne(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nThe goal is to make the error e(k) identically zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is a deadbeat observer. The shortest possible time for the error to become zero is the observability index, ν, of the system (A, C). This means we need to find a gain matrix L such that the error state becomes zero for all k ≥ ν. This can be achieved by ensuring that the matrix for the error dynamics, let's call it A_e = A - LC, is nilpotent with an index of nilpotency equal to ν. That is, (A - LC)^ν = 0.\n\n**Step 2: Check Observability and Find the Observability Index (ν)**\n\nThe system is observable if the observability matrix O has full rank (n=4).\nO = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]\n\nThe matrices A and C are:\nA = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]\nC = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]\n\nLet's compute the necessary terms:\nCA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]\nCA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [3, 1, 0, -1]]\n\nThe observability index ν is the smallest integer such that the matrix O_ν = [C; CA; ...; CA^(ν-1)] has rank n=4.\n- For ν=1, O_1 = C. The rank of C is 2.\n- For ν=2, O_2 = [C; CA]. This is a 4x4 matrix. Its determinant is 0, so its rank is less than 4. (Rank is 3).\n- For ν=3, O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2]. This is a 6x4 matrix. We can find a 4x4 submatrix with a non-zero determinant. For example, the matrix formed by rows 1, 2, 4, and 6 of O_3 has a determinant of -1.\n  det([[1,0,0,0], [1,0,0,1], [-2,0,1,0], [3,1,0,-1]]) = -1 ≠ 0.\nThus, the rank of O_3 is 4. The observability index is ν = 3.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Design Condition**\n\nSince ν = 3, we need to design L such that (A - LC)^3 = 0.\nLet's analyze the structure of A_e = A - LC.\nL is a 4x2 matrix: L = [[l11, l12], [l21, l22], [l31, l32], [l41, l42]]\nC is a 2x4 matrix: C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]\nLC = [[l11+l12, 0, 0, l12],\n      [l21+l22, 0, 0, l22],\n      [l31+l32, 0, 0, l32],\n      [l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]]\n\nA_e = A - LC =\n[[-1-(l11+l12),  0,  0, 1-l12],\n [ 1-(l21+l22),  0,  0, 2-l22],\n [ -(l31+l32),  1,  0, -1-l32],\n [-1-(l41+l42),  0,  1, -1-l42]]\n\nA key observation is that the second and third columns of A_e are constant and do not depend on L:\nColumn 2 of A_e = [0, 0, 1, 0]^T\nColumn 3 of A_e = [0, 0, 0, 1]^T\n\n**Step 4: Solve for L using the Nilpotency Condition**\n\nLet's use the property A_e^3 = 0.\n- The 2nd column of A_e^2 is A_e * (2nd column of A_e) = A_e * [0,0,1,0]^T = 3rd column of A_e.\n- The 2nd column of A_e^3 is A_e * (2nd column of A_e^2) = A_e * (3rd column of A_e) = 4th column of A_e.\nFor A_e^3 to be the zero matrix, its 2nd column must be zero. This means the 4th column of A_e must be zero.\n[1-l12; 2-l22; -1-l32; -1-l42] = [0; 0; 0; 0]\nThis gives us the second column of L:\nl12 = 1\nl22 = 2\nl32 = -1\nl42 = -1\n\n- Now let's consider the 1st column. With the l_i2 values found, the 4th column of A_e is zero. Let's denote the columns of A_e as v1, v2, v3, v4. We have v4=0.\nThe matrix A_e now has the form:\nA_e = [v1, v2, v3, 0] =\n[[ -2-l11,  0, 0, 0],\n [ -1-l21,  0, 0, 0],\n [1-l31,   1, 0, 0],\n [ -l41,    0, 1, 0]]\nLet's call the components of v1 as a, b, c, g.\nv1 = [a, b, c, g]^T = [-2-l11, -1-l21, 1-l31, -l41]^T.\n\nNow we compute the powers of A_e:\nA_e^2's 1st column = A_e * v1 = a*v1 + b*v2 + c*v3 + g*v4 = [a^2, ab, ac+b, ag+c]^T\nA_e^3's 1st column = A_e * (A_e^2's 1st column) = A_e * [a^2, ab, ac+b, ag+c]^T\n= a^2*v1 + ab*v2 + (ac+b)*v3 + (ag+c)*v4\n= [a^3, a^2b, a^2c+ab, a^2g+ac+b]^T\nFor this column to be zero, we must first have a^3 = 0, which implies a = 0.\na = -2 - l11 = 0  =>  l11 = -2\nWith a=0, the column becomes [0, 0, 0, b]^T. For this to be zero, we need b = 0.\nb = -1 - l21 = 0  =>  l21 = -1\nWith a=0 and b=0, the 1st column of A_e^3 is guaranteed to be zero. The remaining elements l31 and l41 can be chosen freely. For simplicity, we choose them to be zero.\nl31 = 0\nl41 = 0\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final Gain Matrix L**\n\nCombining the determined components:\nl11 = -2, l12 = 1\nl21 = -1, l22 = 2\nl31 = 0,  l32 = -1\nl41 = 0,  l42 = -1\n\nThe resulting observer gain matrix L is:\nL = [[-2, 1],\n     [-1, 2],\n     [ 0,-1],\n     [ 0,-1]]\n\nThis matrix L ensures that (A-LC)^3 = 0, causing the observation error to become identically zero for all k ≥ 3.\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
