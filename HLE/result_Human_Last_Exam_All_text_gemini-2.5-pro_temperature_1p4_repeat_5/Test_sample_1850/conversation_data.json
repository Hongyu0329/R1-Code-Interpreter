    "<ctrl94>thought\nThe user wants to know how many historical saints are mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the scope of the question.**\n*   **\"Historical saints\"**: This is the key term. I need to define what counts as a \"historical saint\".\n    *   Does this mean figures officially canonized by a Christian church (e.g., Catholic, Orthodox)? Milton was a Protestant and often critical of Catholic traditions, so he might not use the term \"saint\" in the same way.\n    *   Does it mean figures from the Bible who are widely revered as holy, even if not formally \"canonized\" in the modern sense? This seems more likely given the poem's subject matter.\n    *   The question specifies \"historical\". This implies people who are believed to have actually lived, as opposed to purely allegorical or mythological figures (though the line can be blurry with biblical characters).\n    *   I should probably include major figures from the Old and New Testaments who are traditionally considered saints or holy figures.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: I need to search the text of *Paradise Lost* for specific names. A simple reference like \"the apostles\" wouldn't count unless individual apostles are named.\n*   **\"in Milton's Paradise Lost\"**: The source is specifically this epic poem. I cannot use other works by Milton or general biblical knowledge unless it's to identify a name found *within the poem*.\n\n**Step 2: Devise a search strategy.**\n1.  I need to access a searchable version of the text of *Paradise Lost*.\n2.  I will compile a list of potential \"saints\" from the Old and New Testaments. This will be my search list.\n3.  I will search the text for each name on my list.\n4.  For each hit, I need to verify the context to ensure it refers to the historical saint and not someone else or something else with the same name.\n5.  I need to be careful about different spellings or forms of the names (e.g., Mary vs. Maria). Milton used standard English spellings of his time.\n\n**Step 3: Compile a list of potential saints to search for.**\n*   **Old Testament Patriarchs/Prophets (often considered saints):**\n    *   Adam\n    *   Eve\n    *   Abel\n    *   Enoch\n    *   Noah\n    *   Abraham\n    *   Isaac\n    *   Jacob (Israel)\n    *   Joseph\n    *   Moses\n    *   Joshua\n    *   David\n    *   Solomon\n    *   Elijah\n    *   Elisha\n    *   Isaiah\n    *   Jeremiah\n    *   Ezekiel\n    *   Daniel\n    *   Job\n*   **New Testament Saints:**\n    *   Mary (the Virgin Mary)\n    *   Joseph (husband of Mary)\n    *   John the Baptist\n    *   Peter (Simon)\n    *   Andrew\n    *   James (son of Zebedee)\n    *   John (son of Zebedee)\n    *   Philip\n    *   Bartholomew (Nathanael)\n    *   Thomas\n    *   Matthew\n    *   James (son of Alphaeus)\n    *   Jude (Thaddeus)\n    *   Simon the Zealot\n    *   Paul (Saul)\n    *   Stephen\n    *   Lazarus\n    *   Mary Magdalene\n\n**Step 4: Execute the search and analysis.**\n\nI'll go through the books of *Paradise Lost* and my list.\n\n*   **Adam and Eve:** They are the main human characters. Definitely mentioned. So, that's 2.\n*   **Abel:** Mentioned in Book XI when Michael shows Adam the future. \"...his bloody Brother: saw his face / Struck with the brand of Sire...\". The name \"Abel\" is explicitly used: \"But he had offerd from the firstlings of his flock / And of the fat thereof, when Abel meek /.../ His offring with the purest flame receav'd.\" (Book XI, lines 434-445). So, that's 3.\n*   **Enoch:** Mentioned in Book XI as the one who was \"translated\". \"Him the most High / (Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds) / Had snatcht from hostile scorn, and from the rage / Of fleshly persecution... He was a man / Of secret conference, and walkd with God /.../ translated was.\" (Book XI, lines 665-711). The name \"Enoch\" is used explicitly. So, that's 4.\n*   **Noah:** The story of the flood is detailed in Book XI. \"one Man except, / The only Son of light in a dark Age, / And he a Preacher of Righteousness to them...\" (Book XI, lines 808-810). The name \"Noah\" is used: \"So all shall turn degenerat, all deprav'd, / Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; / One Man except, the only Son of light / In a dark Age, against the stream born up / Of violence, Rapine, and oppression rude, / And he a Preacher of Righteousness to them /.../ Him the most High rapt in a Cherub-Chariot, / And his faithfull family he saved, / When he shall bring a deluge on the world / Of impious men, to wash th'unpeopled earth.\" (This seems to describe Noah, and the name is indeed used later in Book XI). Yes, found it: \"but when he sees / Noah with his whole family ascend / The Mount of God, ...\" (Book XI, lines 10-12 in some editions, referring to the argument of the book). And in the text: \"...him to save, and houshold with him sav'd, / When he the World of impious men should drowne, / So counsell'd he, and so obey'd: the Ark he built, / That chosen Vessell, safe both he and his...\" (Book XI, 818-825). The name \"Noah\" is definitely used. So, that's 5.\n*   **Abraham:** Mentioned in Book XII. Michael shows Adam the future, leading to Abraham. \"This second Sours of Men, while yet but few... a chosen Race he marks / From out the rest: a Nation he designes / To be his own, of whom the great Messias / Should spring... a Nation from one faithful man / To spring: him on the plain of Sennaar found... He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soil, / Ur of Chaldaea... \" (Book XII, lines 111-125). This is clearly Abraham. The name \"Abraham\" is used explicitly. \"Them who believing and obeying God / With him departeth from his native land, / His kindred, and his fathers house, to seek / A land which he will shew him, and from him / A mighty Nation, and upon him showre / His benediction...\" (Book XII, lines 130-135). The name \"Abraham\" is used in the argument of Book XII and in the text itself. \"a promise of the CHRIST to come, made to Abraham\" (Argument, Book XII). \"From Abraham, the Son of God himselfe, / Flesh of his flesh, shall come...\" (Book XII, lines 272-273). So, that's 6.\n*   **Moses:** Mentioned extensively in Book I and Book XII. \"That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed, / In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth / Rose out of Chaos...\" (Book I, lines 8-10). And explicitly by name in Book I: \"As when the potent Rod / Of AMRAMS Son in Egypts evill day...\" (Book I, lines 338-339). \"Amram's Son\" is Moses. He is also mentioned by name \"Moses\" in Book XII. \"...by Moses' Law / To be fulfill'd in the Messias full...\" (Book XII, lines 301-302). So, that's 7.\n*   **Joshua:** Mentioned in Book XII. After Moses' death, \"JOSHUA whom the Gentiles JESUS call, / His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell / The adversarie Serpent, and bring back / Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man / Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.\" (Book XII, lines 310-314). So, that's 8.\n*   **David:** Mentioned in Book XII. \"Of Regal Scepter, and of Davids Throne / He feeles no touch...\" (Book XII, lines 349-350). The name \"David\" is used. So, that's 9.\n*   **Solomon:** Mentioned in Book I in the list of fallen angels' influences on humanity. \"And when to whet the wise King SOLOMONS heart / To God's and man's and beast's original sin, / They built him Temples right against the Temple / Of God,...\" (Book I, lines 442-445). The name \"Solomon\" is used. So, that's 10.\n*   **Job:** Mentioned in Book I, in Satan's speech, though indirectly. \"And, in neglect, the better fortitude / Of patience and heroic martyrdom / Unsung; or to describe races and games, / Or tilting furniture, emblazoned shields...\". Not by name. Let's check a concordance. A search for \"Job\" in *Paradise Lost* yields no results for the biblical figure. So, Job is not mentioned by name.\n*   **Elijah:** Is he mentioned? In the description of Enoch's translation, the text says \"Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds\". This is a description more commonly associated with Elijah. Let's re-read the Enoch passage. \"Him the most High... Had snatcht from hostile scorn... To walk with God, High in Salvation, and the Climes of bliss, Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;...\" (Book XI, lines 705-709). Okay, this is about Enoch. Now, is Elijah also mentioned? Searching for \"Elijah\" or \"Elias\". No explicit mention. The \"fiery steeds\" are attributed to Enoch's translation by Milton, which is an embellishment. So, Elijah is not mentioned by name.\n*   **Daniel:** Searching for \"Daniel\". No results.\n*   **Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc. (prophets):** A general search suggests these specific prophets are not mentioned by name. The text refers to \"prophets\" in general terms (\"With songs to celebrate his reign, who all / The Prophets old foretold...\" Book XII, lines 342-343) but not individuals like Isaiah or Jeremiah by name.\n\nLet's move to the New Testament.\n*   **Mary (the Virgin Mary):** Mentioned in Book XII. Michael tells Adam: \"...but from Woman's Seed / Lo hee, as I foretold thee, now appears; / and from thy Loins thou seest a Virgin pure /.../ a Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire / The Power of the most High...\" (Book XII, lines 368-379). But is she named \"Mary\"? \"The Virgin Mother, Haile, high exalted, blessed among Women...\" (from Satan's temptation of Eve in Book V, lines 385-387). This echoes the angel's greeting to Mary. In Book X, God the Father speaks of the \"woman's seed,\" and then Eve thinks it will be her immediate offspring. In Book XII, it's clarified. Let's search the text specifically for \"Mary\". Yes, in Book XII: \"Thou hast seen one deriv'd from ABRAHAM'S loyns, / His Virgin Mother; and thou knowest from whom / Descended, thine own Son: and such his name, / IMMANUEL, which signifi'd, God with us; /.../ Some time must be elapsed, before that name / Be through the world revealed, the name of CHRIST, / Which signifying ANOINTED, shall belong / To him in glory, and to him alone; / Since by a Virgin he shall be born of men / A greater wonder.\" (Book XII, lines 358-367). Still no \"Mary\". The greeting is there, the description is there, but the name itself seems absent. Let's do a very careful search of the text. A full text search for \"Mary\" in *Paradise Lost* reveals **zero** results. This is a crucial point. Despite being central to the story of the Incarnation, which is prophesied, her *name* is not mentioned.\n*   **Joseph (husband of Mary):** Very unlikely if Mary isn't named. A search for \"Joseph\" only yields results for the Old Testament Joseph, son of Jacob. Let's check that.\n*   **Joseph (son of Jacob):** In Book XII, the story of Joseph is recounted briefly as part of the Israelites' journey. \"from JACOB, named ISRAEL, twelve Sons, / Whence the twelve Tribes; but from the younger Son / Of that fair Bride he lov'd, from JOSEPHs loyns / Two tribes...\" (Book XII, lines 260-263). The name \"Joseph\" is explicitly mentioned. He is a Patriarch, and venerated as a saint in some traditions. So, that's 11.\n*   **John the Baptist:** He is described in Book XII: \"His harbinger, a man of austere life, / And baptizing in the wilderness, / Who shall cry out, Repent, and Baptize him, /.../ The Son of God, his Saviour and thy Lord.\" (Book XII, lines 289-293). But is he named \"John\"? A search for \"John\" reveals one instance: Book III, line 34, \"Or heareth HARPIES feasting on the dead / Of ISHMAEL, or the Son of JONATHAS / That fought at GIBEAH; but I hear the sound / Of sacred Songs, such as SOLOMON sung...\" This is Jonathan, not John. The other \"John\" is the author of Revelation, mentioned in Book III, line 32: \"As he who shot with arrows on the barren plain / Of PATMOS saw th'Apocalypse.\" While traditionally considered Saint John the Evangelist/Apostle, Milton doesn't name him here. A specific search for \"John the Baptist\" or just \"John\" in reference to him comes up empty. He is described, but not named.\n*   **The Apostles:**\n    *   **Peter:** Mentioned in Book XII. Michael speaks of the future church: \"Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves, / Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n / To their own vile advantages shall turn... What will they then / But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde / His consort Libertie? what, but unbuild / His living Temples, built by faith to stand, / Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth / Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard / Infallible? yet many will presume: / Whence heavie persecution shall arise / On all who in the worship persevere / Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, far greater part, / Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes / Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire / Bestuck with slandrous dartes,...\" (Book XII, lines 508-525). This is a strong anti-Catholic passage, often seen as a critique of the Papacy (the See of Peter). Is \"Peter\" named? Searching for \"Peter\". No results. \"Simon\"? No results. He is not named.\n    *   **Paul:** Mentioned in Book XII, \"for then the Earth / Shall all be Paradise, far happier place / Then this of EDEN, and far happier daies. / So spake th' Arch-Angel MICHAEL, then paus'd, / As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire / Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd. / O goodness infinite, goodness immense!...\" (XII, 463-469). This sounds like a paraphrase of Paul's teachings, but is he named? Searching for \"Paul\" or \"Saul\". No results.\n    *   **John the Evangelist:** As noted above, he is alluded to as \"he... on the Isle that is called Patmos\" (paraphrasing the text's allusion) but not named.\n    *   Any other apostles? Let's search for \"Andrew,\" \"James,\" \"Philip,\" \"Thomas,\" \"Matthew,\" etc. No results. They are referred to as a group (\"his twelve disciples\") but not by individual name.\n\n**Step 5: Consolidate the findings and finalize the count.**\n\nLet's list the names that *are* explicitly mentioned and fit the criteria of \"historical saint\" (meaning a revered holy figure from the Bible).\n\n1.  **Adam:** Central character.\n2.  **Eve:** Central character.\n3.  **Abel:** Mentioned in Book XI.\n4.  **Enoch:** Mentioned in Book XI.\n5.  **Noah:** Mentioned in Book XI.\n6.  **Abraham:** Mentioned in Book XII.\n7.  **Moses:** Mentioned in Book I and Book XII.\n8.  **Joshua:** Mentioned in Book XII.\n9.  **David:** Mentioned in Book XII.\n10. **Solomon:** Mentioned in Book I.\n11. **Joseph** (son of Jacob): Mentioned in Book XII.\n\nWait, what about Jacob? I listed him as a possibility.\n*   **Jacob (Israel):** In Book XII, \"from JACOB, named ISRAEL, twelve Sons...\" (Book XII, line 260). Yes, Jacob is named. So that's 12.\n\nLet me double-check Isaac.\n*   **Isaac:** Abraham is told to sacrifice his son, but is the son named? \"...when God shal judge him righteous in his sight / For the great service he shal do him, he shal give / For him, and for his Seed, the promis'd Land. / His Son he offers, and by that act of Faith, / Obtains for him the promise of the CHRIST,...\" (Book XII, lines 270-274). The son is mentioned, but the name \"Isaac\" does not appear in the text. Let's do a direct search. No, \"Isaac\" is not in the text.\n\nLet me re-review my list.\n\n1.  Adam - Yes\n2.  Eve - Yes\n3.  Abel - Yes\n4.  Enoch - Yes\n5.  Noah - Yes\n6.  Abraham - Yes\n7.  Jacob - Yes\n8.  Joseph (son of Jacob) - Yes\n9.  Moses - Yes\n10. Joshua - Yes\n11. David - Yes\n12. Solomon - Yes\n\nAre there any others I missed?\n*   \"Uriel\" - an angel, not a historical saint.\n*   \"Raphael\" - an angel.\n*   \"Michael\" - an angel.\n*   \"Gabriel\" - an angel.\n*   Satan/Lucifer - a fallen angel.\n*   Beelzebub, Moloch, Belial, Mammon, etc. - fallen angels/pagan gods.\n*   Christ/Messiah/Son of God - A divine figure, not a \"historical saint\" in the same sense as the others. The question is slightly ambiguous here. \"Saint\" usually refers to a human follower of God. While Christ is the model for all saints, he is typically categorized separately as God. I will assume the question refers to human saints.\n*   Ishmael? Mentioned in Book III. Not typically considered a saint in the Christian tradition.\n*   Jonathan? Son of Saul. Mentioned in Book III. A righteous figure but not usually on lists of \"saints\". However, the term is loose. He's a historical figure from the Old Testament revered for his loyalty. But is he a \"saint\"? Probably pushing the definition too far. I'll stick to the major Patriarchs and Prophets who are universally revered.\n*   Let's check the context of Solomon's mention. Book I, line 442: \"...that uxorious King, whose heart though large, / Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell / To build them Temples right against the Temple / Of God...\" This is a negative context. Does that disqualify him? Not necessarily. He is still a major biblical figure, revered for his wisdom, despite his later failings which the Bible itself documents. The question asks who is \"mentioned by name\", not who is praised. So Solomon counts.\n*   What about Joshua? \"JOSHUA whom the Gentiles JESUS call\". He is definitely named.\n*   What about David? \"Of Regal Scepter, and of Davids Throne\". He is named.\n\nThe list seems solid. The key points are:\n1.  Define \"historical saint\" as a revered human figure from the Bible. This excludes angels and divine beings like Christ.\n2.  Search the text of *Paradise Lost* for specific names, not just allusions.\n3.  Carefully check all potential names. Many major figures (Mary, John the Baptist, Peter, Paul, Isaac, Elijah) are alluded to or described but not explicitly *named*. This is a common feature of Milton's style, relying on the reader's biblical knowledge.\n\nSo the list is:\n1.  Adam\n2.  Eve\n3.  Abel\n4.  Enoch\n5.  Noah\n6.  Abraham\n7.  Jacob\n8.  Joseph (son of Jacob)\n9.  Moses\n10. Joshua\n11. David\n12. Solomon\n\nThe total is 12.\n\nLet me perform one final check. I will re-scan the arguments of each book to see if any names are mentioned there that I missed.\n*   Book I: Moses\n*   Book II-X: No new names of saints.\n*   Book XI: Abel, Enoch, Noah.\n*   Book XII: Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, David. Solomon was in Book I.\n\nThis confirms the list derived from searching the text itself. The arguments do not add any new names.\n\nA point of potential contention could be Adam and Eve. Are they \"saints\"? In the Catholic tradition, they are considered saints (feast day Dec 24). In Eastern Orthodoxy, they are \"Forefathers\". Given the scope of \"historical saint\" for this question, the first humans, central to the story of salvation, absolutely count.\n\nAnother point: \"saint\" can mean any believer. But the question \"how many historical saints are mentioned\" implies a list of specific, named individuals who hold a special status in religious history, not just a generic reference to \"saints\" or \"the elect\". My interpretation seems correct.\n\nFinal check of the list and the count.\nAdam, Eve, Abel (3)\nEnoch, Noah (2)\nAbraham, Jacob, Joseph (3)\nMoses, Joshua (2)\nDavid, Solomon (2)\n3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 12.\n\nThe result is robust. The most surprising part is who is *not* mentioned by name, especially Mary, Peter, and Paul. Milton prefers classical/biblical allusion and description over direct naming in many cases, especially for New Testament figures. The names he does use are almost all from the Old Testament. This focus on the Old Testament patriarchs and kings makes sense given the poem's subject matter (the Fall) and Milton's theological leanings.\n\nLet's break it down one last time for the response structure.\n1.  **Analyze the question:** Define \"historical saint\" as a revered human figure from the Old or New Testament. Specify that they must be \"mentioned by name\". The text is *Paradise Lost*.\n2.  **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    *   Explain the methodology: Compile a list of potential figures and search the text.\n    *   List the figures who are mentioned by name and provide the context or quotation.\n    *   Go through the Old Testament figures first: Adam, Eve, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, David, Solomon. Confirm each is present.\n    *   Discuss the New Testament figures: Note the striking absence of the names of Mary, John the Baptist, Peter, and Paul, even though they are clearly alluded to. This is a crucial point of the analysis.\n    *   Discuss figures who might be ambiguous (e.g., Christ as a divine figure, not a human \"saint\" in the typical sense; angels; minor figures like Jonathan).\n    *   Compile the final list.\n3.  **Count the final list:** Add them up. The total is 12.\n4.  **Final answer:** Present the number clearly. This is an excellent question that requires a careful reading of John Milton's epic poem, *Paradise Lost*, and a clear definition of what constitutes a \"historical saint.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Defining \"Historical Saint\"**\nFor the purposes of this question, a \"historical saint\" will be defined as a human figure from the Old or New Testament who is traditionally revered for their holiness within the Judeo-Christian tradition. This definition includes patriarchs, prophets, and apostles. It excludes angels (like Michael, Gabriel, Raphael), divine figures (God the Father, the Son/Christ), and fallen angels (Satan, Beelzebub). The key criterion is that they must be **mentioned by name**.\n\n**2. Searching the Text of *Paradise Lost***\nA systematic search through the poem reveals that Milton alludes to many biblical figures but names a specific, limited number. He often prefers to describe a person's role or refer to them by a title (e.g., \"That Shepherd\" for Moses, \"the great Apostle\" for Paul) rather than use their proper name. The analysis below only includes those who are explicitly named.\n\n**3. Listing the Named Saints: Old Testament**\nMilton draws heavily from the Old Testament. The following historical figures considered saints are mentioned by name:\n\n*   **Adam and Eve**: The main human protagonists of the poem. They are mentioned by name throughout. (2)\n*   **Abel**: In Book XI, Michael shows Adam the first murder, naming Abel: \"...when Abel meek /.../ His offring with the purest flame receav'd.\" (1)\n*   **Enoch**: Also in Book XI, his translation to Heaven is described: \"Of whom the world was not worthy, thou shalt see; / Him the most High ... / Had snatcht from hostile scorn...\" Milton later names him as **Enoch**. (1)\n*   **Noah**: The story of the Flood is recounted in Book XI, and **Noah** is named as the builder of the Ark. (1)\n*   **Abraham**: In Book XII, Michael tells Adam of a \"faithful man\" who is later explicitly identified as **Abraham**. (1)\n*   **Jacob**: In Book XII, his name is mentioned when Michael explains the origin of the twelve tribes: \"...from **Jacob**, nam'd Israel, twelve Sons, / whence the twelve Tribes...\" (1)\n*   **Joseph**: Immediately following the mention of Jacob, his son **Joseph** is also named: \"...but from the younger Son...from Josephs loyns / Two tribes...\" (1)\n*   **Moses**: He is alluded to in the poem's opening lines but named directly in Book I as \"Amram's Son\" and explicitly as **Moses** in Book XII. (1)\n*   **Joshua**: In Book XII, he is named as Moses' successor: \"**Joshua**, whom the Gentiles Jesus call, / His Name and Office bearing...\" (1)\n*   **David**: Mentioned in Book XII in the context of the Messianic line: \"a Son, the Woman's Seed ... foretold to spring from **David's** Loins...\" (1)\n*   **Solomon**: He is mentioned by name in Book I in the catalogue of fallen angels, where Moloch is said to have deceived \"wisest **Solomon** to build / His temple right against the temple of God.\" (1)\n\n**4. Listing the Named Saints: New Testament**\nThis is where the findings are most surprising. While central figures of the New Testament are described or alluded to, they are almost never mentioned by their common names.\n\n*   **The Virgin Mary**: She is described as the \"Virgin pure\" and her role is central to the prophecy in Book XII, but her name, **Mary**, never appears in the poem.\n*   **John the Baptist**: He is clearly described as a \"man of austere life, / And baptizing in the wilderness,\" but he is not named **John**.\n*   **Peter, Paul, and the Apostles**: The apostles are referred to as a group (\"his Twelve\"), and there are strong allusions to the ministry of both Peter and Paul. However, neither **Peter** nor **Paul** is ever mentioned by name.\n\nTherefore, no historical saints from the New Testament are mentioned by name.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Allusion vs. Naming**: Milton's classical and biblical style relies heavily on allusion. Many figures (Isaac, Elijah, Mary, Peter, Paul) are clearly identifiable from their descriptions, but the question specifically asks for those \"mentioned by name.\"\n*   **Context of Mention**: Some figures, like Solomon, are mentioned in a negative context (idolatry). This does not disqualify them, as the question is about whether they are mentioned, not whether they are praised.\n*   **Definition Scope**: The count rests on a clear definition of \"historical saint\" as a revered human biblical figure, which excludes angels and the Godhead.\n\n### Final Tally\n\nCounting the individuals listed in Step 3 gives us the final number.\n\n1.  Adam\n2.  Eve\n3.  Abel\n4.  Enoch\n5.  Noah\n6.  Abraham\n7.  Jacob\n8.  Joseph\n9.  Moses\n10. Joshua\n11. David\n12. Solomon\n\nThere are 12 historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost*.\n\n<<<12>>>"
