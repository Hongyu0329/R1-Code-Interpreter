    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to develop the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral and Identify the Key Behavior**\n\nThe integral in question is:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nWe need to find an approximation for this integral when $\\epsilon$ is a small positive number ($\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\nLet's define the function in the denominator as $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)} dx$.\n\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)}$ will become very large if the denominator approaches zero. This happens at values of $x$ where $f(x)$ is at its minimum. Let's find the minimum of $f(x)$ on the interval $[0, 15]$.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = 45x^4 + 30x^5 + 72x^7 = x^4(45 + 30x + 72x^3)$.\nFor $x > 0$ in the interval $[0, 15]$, all terms in the parenthesis are positive, so $f'(x) > 0$. At $x=0$, $f'(0)=0$. This means that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function for $x>0$.\nTherefore, the minimum value of $f(x)$ on the interval $[0, 15]$ occurs at $x=0$, where $f(0) = 0$.\n\nThis means that as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand becomes very large near $x=0$. The dominant contribution to the integral comes from a small region (a \"boundary layer\") around $x=0$.\n\n**Step 2: Approximate the Function and the Integral**\n\nSince the main contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$, we can approximate the function $f(x)$ by its behavior for small $x$. For $x \\to 0$, the lowest power of $x$ dominates:\n$f(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5$\n\nWe can now approximate the integral by replacing $f(x)$ with this simpler form:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\nFurthermore, because the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$ decreases very rapidly as $x$ increases, the value of the integral is not sensitive to the upper limit of integration, as long as it is sufficiently large. For instance, the contribution from the tail end of the interval is negligible. We can therefore extend the upper limit of integration to infinity without introducing a significant error in the leading-order approximation.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Approximate Integral**\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a change of variables to make it a standard form.\nLet's make a substitution to get rid of the parameters $\\epsilon$ and $9$ from the denominator. A suitable substitution is $9x^5 = \\epsilon u$.\n\nFrom $9x^5 = \\epsilon u$, we get $x^5 = \\frac{\\epsilon u}{9}$, so $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon u}{9}\\right)^{1/5} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5} u^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}}$.\nThe differential $dx$ is then:\n$dx = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} u^{1/5-1} du = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} u^{-4/5} du$.\n\nThe limits of integration remain from $0$ to $\\infty$. Substituting these into the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} u^{-4/5} \\right) du$\n\nFactor out $\\epsilon$ from the denominator:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1 + u)} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} u^{-4/5} \\right) du$\n\nNow, we can separate the terms involving $\\epsilon$ from the integral:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{\\epsilon \\cdot 5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1 + u} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1 + u} du$\n\n**Step 4: Use a Standard Integral Identity**\n\nThe remaining integral is a standard integral related to the Beta function and Gamma function. The identity is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{p-1}}{1 + t} dt = \\Gamma(p)\\Gamma(1-p) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(p\\pi)}$, for $0 < p < 1$.\n\nIn our integral, we have $u^{-4/5}$. We can match this to the formula by setting $p-1 = -4/5$, which gives $p = 1 - 4/5 = 1/5$. Since $0 < 1/5 < 1$, the formula is applicable.\nSo, the value of our integral is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1 + u} du = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Final Formula**\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\nThis gives the final analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nThe numerical values in the original problem are given with one decimal place, so we can write the formula as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\epsilon^{-4.0/5.0}$\n\nThis formula captures the leading-order behavior of the integral for small $\\epsilon$. The dependence on $\\epsilon$ is $\\epsilon^{-0.8}$.\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}>>>"
