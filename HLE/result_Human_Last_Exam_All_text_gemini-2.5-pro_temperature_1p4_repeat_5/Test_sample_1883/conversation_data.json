    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to predict the ratio of products A and B.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reaction and Apply FMO Theory Selection Rules\n\n*   **Reactant:** (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is a conjugated polyene.\n*   **Conditions:** Thermal.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reactant is a linear conjugated system that forms a cyclic product. This is an electrocyclic ring-closing reaction.\n*   **π-Electrons:** The tetraene has 4 double bonds, so it is an 8-π electron system. This is a `4n` system, where `n=2`.\n*   **FMO Analysis (Selection Rule):** For a thermal reaction, we analyze the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the ground state. For an 8-π electron system (octatetraene), the HOMO is ψ₄. The ψ₄ molecular orbital has 3 nodes and its terminal lobes have opposite symmetry (one points \"up\" and the other points \"down\"). To form a sigma bond, these lobes must overlap in-phase. This requires the two ends of the molecule to rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise). This motion is defined as **conrotatory**.\n*   **Conclusion 1:** According to FMO theory, the thermal electrocyclization of an 8-π electron system is a symmetry-allowed conrotatory process.\n\n### Step 2: The Origin of Two Products\n\n*   The problem states that a single starting material, (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, produces two different stereoisomeric products: `cis`-isomer A and `trans`-isomer B.\n*   Electrocyclic reactions are highly stereospecific. A single reactant isomer undergoing a specific motion (conrotatory) should ideally give only one stereoisomeric product.\n*   The formation of two products implies that the initial reactant, the (8E)-isomer, is in equilibrium with another diastereomer under the thermal reaction conditions. This other isomer must be the (2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n    `(8E)-isomer  ⇌  (8Z)-isomer`\n*   Both of these isomers can then undergo the allowed conrotatory cyclization to yield the different products A and B.\n\n### Step 3: Stereochemical Analysis of the Cyclization Pathways\n\nWe need to determine which reactant leads to which product. This involves analyzing the stereochemistry of the substituents on the terminal carbons (C2 and C9) and how they move during conrotation. We will define \"up\" and \"down\" for the substituents relative to the plane of the coiling polyene.\n\n*   **Pathway 1: (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-isomer → Product B**\n    1.  **Reactant Geometry:** In the conformation required for cyclization, the (8E) geometry results in the terminal methyl groups having an opposing relationship. Let's set the C2-substituents as `Me(up)` and `H(down)`. Tracing the chain geometry, the C9-substituents will be `H(up)` and `Me(down)`.\n    2.  **Conrotation:** During conrotation, one \"up\" group (`Me` from C2) and the other \"up\" group (`H` from C9) rotate inwards to form the new bond. They will end up on opposite faces of the new ring, i.e., `trans`. Similarly, the \"down\" groups (`H` from C2 and `Me` from C9) also move to `trans` positions.\n    3.  **Product:** The two methyl groups end up `trans` to each other. Thus, the (8E)-isomer yields the **`trans`-isomer B**.\n\n*   **Pathway 2: (2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)-isomer → Product A**\n    1.  **Reactant Geometry:** For the all-Z isomer, the terminal methyl groups have the same relationship. If we set C2-substituents as `Me(up)` and `H(down)`, the C9-substituents will also be `Me(up)` and `H(down)`.\n    2.  **Conrotation:** During conrotation, the two \"up\" groups (`Me` from C2 and `Me` from C9) can rotate inwards. They will end up on the same face of the new ring, i.e., `cis`.\n    3.  **Product:** The two methyl groups end up `cis` to each other. Thus, the (8Z)-isomer yields the **`cis`-isomer A**.\n\n### Step 4: Comparing the Rates of Reaction (Kinetic Control)\n\nThe ratio of products A and B is determined by the competition between these two pathways. According to the Curtin-Hammett principle, the ratio depends on both the relative stabilities of the (8E) and (8Z) ground states and the activation energies of their respective cyclizations.\n\n*   **Torquoselectivity (Steric Effects in the Transition State):** FMO theory can be refined by considering steric hindrance in the transition state. The system will favor the rotational path that minimizes steric repulsion.\n    *   **Formation of A (cis):** The (8Z)-isomer can cyclize in two conrotatory ways: (i) both `Me` groups rotate inwards, causing a severe `Me-Me` steric clash, or (ii) both `H` atoms rotate inwards, causing a minimal `H-H` clash. The reaction will overwhelmingly proceed via the low-energy pathway with the **`H-H` clash**.\n    *   **Formation of B (trans):** The (8E)-isomer must rotate one `Me` group and one `H` group inwards. The transition state inevitably involves a **`Me-H` clash**.\n*   **Rate Comparison:** The steric clash in the transition state for forming A (`H-H`) is much smaller than for forming B (`Me-H`). Therefore, the activation energy for forming A is lower than for forming B (`Ea(A) < Ea(B)`), and the rate constant is higher (`k_A > k_B`). **This factor favors the formation of the `cis`-isomer A.**\n\n### Step 5: Considering Reactant Stability and Predicting the Ratio\n\n*   **Ground State Stability:** The (8E)-isomer is sterically less hindered and therefore thermodynamically more stable than the (8Z)-isomer. In the initial equilibrium `(8E) ⇌ (8Z)`, the concentration of the (8E)-isomer will be significantly higher than that of the (8Z)-isomer. **This factor favors the formation of the `trans`-isomer B.**\n*   **Overall Ratio Prediction:** The final product ratio is a result of two opposing effects:\n    1.  **Reactivity:** The (8Z)-isomer reacts faster to give `cis`-A.\n    2.  **Stability:** The (8E)-isomer is more abundant and leads to `trans`-B.\n*   In this well-known case, the ground-state stability factor is dominant over the transition-state reactivity factor. The larger population of the more stable (8E)-isomer leads to its corresponding product, `trans`-isomer B, being the major product of the reaction. Experimental results for this specific reaction show a product ratio of approximately **A:B = 1:9**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nFMO theory explains why the reaction is conrotatory and allows for a detailed analysis of the competing pathways. The analysis reveals that the kinetically favored product is `cis`-A, but this is counteracted by the higher stability and concentration of the (8E) reactant leading to `trans`-B. The dominance of the reactant stability factor leads to the `trans`-isomer B being the major product.\n\nThe ratio of A to B is therefore 1:9.\n\n<<<1:9>>>"
