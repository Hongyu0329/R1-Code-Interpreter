    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** This is a fundamental figure in many ballroom dances, characterized by a turn to the left (counter-clockwise). It's a cornerstone of the syllabus in Waltz, Foxtrot, Tango, and Quickstep.\n*   **Overturning:** This means rotating more than the standard, prescribed amount for a figure. For example, if a standard figure is supposed to turn 3/4 of a full circle, overturning it would mean turning 7/8 or a full circle.\n*   **\"Without Disregarding the Technique\":** This is the most critical part of the question. It means we are looking for a dance where the fundamental rules and mechanics of the dance itself prevent overturning. In other dances, overturning might be a permissible variation or a tool for floorcraft (navigating the dance floor), but in the correct answer, it would be a clear technical violation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Dance Option**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz & B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot & E. Quickstep:** These four dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) are categorized as \"swing\" dances.\n    *   **Key Technique:** They are characterized by continuous, flowing movement, body sway, and rise and fall (except for some Foxtrot figures). This flowing nature allows for flexibility.\n    *   **Application to Turns:** In these dances, turns can be \"blended\" into the next figure. Dancers frequently and intentionally under-turn or overturn figures, especially at corners of the room or to create different choreographic effects. For example, a dancer might overturn a Reverse Turn in a Waltz to align themselves differently for the next figure. This is considered an advanced skill, not a technical violation. The technique of these dances *allows* for such modifications.\n\n*   **C. European Tango (International Tango):**\n    *   **Key Technique:** Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. Its technique is based on sharp, staccato actions. There is no rise and fall and no body sway. Movement is direct and clipped. Footwork is precise; feet are picked up and placed, not glided.\n    *   **Application to the Reverse Turn:** Let's look at the Man's steps for a standard Reverse Turn in Tango:\n        1.  Step forward on the Left Foot.\n        2.  Step to the side on the Right Foot, turning.\n        3.  Close the Left Foot to the Right Foot, without weight.\n    *   **The Crucial Point:** The third step, where the feet are brought together (\"close\"), is the key. In Tango technique, this closing action is a definitive end to the rotational part of the figure. It acts as a \"full stop.\" To continue turning after the feet have closed would require a twisting or swiveling action on the supporting foot, which is a direct violation of the clean, staccato technique of Tango. The body's rotation is meant to be completed *as* the feet close. Any further turning disregards the fundamental principle of how a Tango turn is constructed and completed.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nWhile in the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), overturning a turn is a common and technically acceptable tool for choreography and floorcraft, in European Tango, the technique itself, specifically the closing action of the feet at the end of the Reverse Turn, makes overturning a technical impossibility. Attempting to do so would fundamentally break the rules of how the dance is performed.\n\n<<<C>>>"
