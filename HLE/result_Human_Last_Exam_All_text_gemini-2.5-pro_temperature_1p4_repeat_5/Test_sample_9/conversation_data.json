    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the moduli space $X$ of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space X**\n\n1.  **Lattices:** A lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. It can be represented by a basis, i.e., a pair of linearly independent vectors $(v_1, v_2)$. These vectors can be taken as the columns of an invertible $2 \\times 2$ real matrix $A$. The set of all such bases is the space $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n2.  **Unit Area:** The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition of unit area restricts the space of bases to matrices $A$ such that $|\\det(A)|=1$. Let's call this space $S = \\{A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(A)|=1\\}$. This space consists of two connected components: $S_+ = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (where $\\det(A)=1$) and $S_- = \\{A \\mid \\det(A)=-1\\}$.\n\n3.  **Moduli Space:** Two bases, represented by matrices $A$ and $A'$, define the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis matrix $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $A' = AM$. $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the group of $2 \\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$. The moduli space $X$ is the space of all such lattices, which is the quotient space of bases by this equivalence relation:\n    $X = S / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\{A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(A)|=1\\} / \\sim$, where $A \\sim AM$ for $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate X to a more standard space**\n\nThere is a well-known correspondence between lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and positive-definite binary quadratic forms.\n\n1.  **From Lattices to Quadratic Forms:** To a lattice $L$ with basis $(v_1, v_2)$ (columns of matrix $A$), we can associate a quadratic form $Q(x, y) = \\|xv_1 + yv_2\\|^2$. In matrix form, for a vector $\\mathbf{x} = (x, y)^T$, this is $Q(\\mathbf{x}) = (A\\mathbf{x})^T(A\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^T (A^T A) \\mathbf{x}$. The form is determined by the symmetric positive-definite matrix $S = A^T A$.\n\n2.  **Equivalence:** If two bases $A$ and $A' = AM$ with $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ define the same lattice, the corresponding symmetric matrices are related by $S' = (AM)^T(AM) = M^T (A^T A) M = M^T S M$. This is the standard notion of equivalence for quadratic forms.\n\n3.  **Unit Area Constraint:** The determinant of the quadratic form matrix is $\\det(S) = \\det(A^T A) = (\\det A)^2$. The condition of unit area for the lattice, $|\\det A|=1$, corresponds to $\\det S = 1$.\n\n4.  **The Space of Forms:** The space of positive-definite real symmetric $2 \\times 2$ matrices $S$ with $\\det S = 1$ is a standard space. Any such matrix can be written as $S = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ b & c \\end{pmatrix}$ with $a>0$ and $ac-b^2=1$. This space is homeomorphic to the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$ via the map $S \\mapsto z = \\frac{-b+i\\sqrt{\\det S}}{a} = \\frac{-b+i}{a}$.\n\n5.  **The Group Action:** The action $S \\mapsto M^T S M$ on the space of matrices corresponds to an action on $\\mathbb{H}$. For $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, this corresponds to the action of $M$ on $\\mathbb{H}$ via fractional linear transformations, where matrices with negative determinant act via complex conjugation. Specifically, if $M = \\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}$:\n    -   If $\\det M = 1$, $M \\cdot z = \\frac{pz+q}{rz+s}$.\n    -   If $\\det M = -1$, $M \\cdot z = \\frac{p\\bar{z}+q}{r\\bar{z}+s}$.\n    The group that acts effectively on $\\mathbb{H}$ is $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) / \\{\\pm I\\}$.\n\n6.  **Identification of X:** Thus, the moduli space $X$ is homeomorphic to the quotient orbifold $X \\cong \\mathbb{H} / PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the topology of $\\mathbb{H} / PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$**\n\nTo understand the topology of the quotient space, we can examine a fundamental domain and its boundary identifications.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Domain:** The standard fundamental domain for the modular group $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) = SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})/\\{\\pm I\\}$ acting on $\\mathbb{H}$ is $D = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{H} \\mid |z| \\ge 1, -1/2 \\le \\operatorname{Re}(z) \\le 1/2\\}$. The group $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ and the reflection $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$. We can therefore choose a fundamental domain for $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ to be one half of $D$. Let's choose the right half:\n    $D' = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{H} \\mid |z| \\ge 1, 0 \\le \\operatorname{Re}(z) \\le 1/2\\}$.\n\n2.  **Boundary of the Fundamental Domain:** The boundary of $D'$ consists of three parts:\n    *   $\\gamma_1$: The imaginary axis from $i$ to $\\infty$. ($ \\operatorname{Re}(z)=0, \\operatorname{Im}(z) \\ge 1$)\n    *   $\\gamma_2$: The circular arc on $|z|=1$ from $i$ to $\\rho = e^{i\\pi/3} = 1/2 + i\\sqrt{3}/2$.\n    *   $\\gamma_3$: The vertical line from $\\rho$ to $\\infty$. ($\\operatorname{Re}(z)=1/2, \\operatorname{Im}(z) \\ge \\sqrt{3}/2$)\n\n3.  **Boundary Identifications:** The space $X$ is formed by taking $D'$ and identifying points on its boundary that are equivalent under the action of $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   Any point $z$ on $\\gamma_1$ is equivalent to $S(z) = -1/z = i/\\operatorname{Im}(z)$, which is also on $\\gamma_1$. This identification \"folds\" the edge $\\gamma_1$ onto itself, with the point $i$ being fixed ($S(i)=i$).\n    *   Any point $z$ on $\\gamma_2$ is equivalent to $g(z) = (z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}) \\circ (z \\mapsto -1/z) = 1/z$. Since $|z|=1$ on $\\gamma_2$, $|1/z|=1$, so $1/z$ is also on $\\gamma_2$. This identification \"folds\" the arc $\\gamma_2$ onto itself, with $i$ again being fixed.\n    *   Any point $z = 1/2 + iy$ on $\\gamma_3$ is equivalent to a point on the line $\\operatorname{Re}(z)=-1/2$ via the map $z \\mapsto z-1$. This point is then equivalent to $z' = -(\\overline{z-1}) = 1-\\bar{z}$. For $z=1/2+iy$, we get $z'=1-(1/2-iy)=1/2+iy=z$. This means there are no non-trivial identifications for points in the interior of $\\gamma_3$.\n\n4.  **Topological Structure of X:** The space $X$ is topologically equivalent to the fundamental domain $D'$ with the edges $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ folded onto themselves. The resulting space is a surface whose only boundary is the image of $\\gamma_3$. Such a space is topologically a plane (or disk) with one edge. A space with a single boundary edge is simply connected. Specifically, we can construct a deformation retraction of $D'$ onto the boundary edge $\\gamma_3$. The same retraction descends to the quotient space $X$, showing that $X$ deformation retracts to a ray (the image of $\\gamma_3$).\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Homology Group**\n\nA space that deformation retracts to a ray is contractible. For any contractible space $K$, the homology groups are:\n$H_0(K, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n$H_n(K, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n\nSince $X$ is contractible, its first homology group is trivial.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe moduli space $X$ is homeomorphic to the orbifold $\\mathbb{H} / PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The underlying topological space can be constructed from a fundamental domain $D'$, which is a simply connected region in $\\mathbb{H}$. The boundary identifications \"fold\" two of the three boundary edges, leaving a single boundary edge in the quotient space. This makes the space $X$ contractible. Therefore, its first homology group is zero.\n\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$."
