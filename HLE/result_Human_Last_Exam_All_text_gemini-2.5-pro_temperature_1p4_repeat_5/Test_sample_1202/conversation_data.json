    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks for the primary mechanism that explains two key outcomes after a gene duplication event in eukaryotes:\n1.  **Retention:** Why is the new, duplicate copy not immediately lost from the genome through mutation or deletion? Initially, a second copy of a gene is often redundant, offering no selective advantage, making it prone to loss.\n2.  **Divergence:** How do the two gene copies (the original and the duplicate) evolve to become different from each other over time?\n\nThe question seeks the \"most likely\" mechanism, suggesting that while multiple processes might occur, one is considered the most common or a crucial first step for preserving these duplicates.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each answer choice in the context of gene duplication.**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicate genes, gene conversion tends to make the two copies *more similar* to each other, or even identical. This works *against* divergence. Therefore, it cannot be the primary mechanism for both retention and divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a duplicate gene accumulates disabling mutations (e.g., stop codons, frameshifts) and becomes non-functional, turning into a \"pseudogene.\" This is a very common fate for duplicate genes because the second copy is often not under selective pressure to remain functional. While this is a form of divergence (diverging from a functional to a non-functional state), it represents a *failure* to retain a functional gene. The question is about the retention of genes that can then evolve new roles.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that after duplication, one copy continues to perform the original, essential function. The second copy is free from the pressure of selection and can accumulate mutations. By chance, some of these mutations might lead to the evolution of a completely new, beneficial function. At this point, natural selection will act to preserve this second copy.\n    *   **Retention:** Retention is contingent on the rare event of acquiring a new beneficial function before the gene is lost to pseudogenization. The initial retention is precarious.\n    *   **Divergence:** Divergence is essential for creating the new function.\n    *   This is a valid mechanism but relies on a period of redundancy where the gene could be lost.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model assumes the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (e.g., active in different tissues or at different life stages). After duplication, each copy can accumulate mutations that degrade or silence different subfunctions. For example, copy 1 loses function B, and copy 2 loses function A. Now, both genes are required to carry out the complete set of the original gene's functions.\n    *   **Retention:** This model provides a strong and immediate reason for retaining both copies. As soon as they have each lost a different, complementary subfunction, losing either copy would be detrimental. They are no longer redundant.\n    *   **Divergence:** The process inherently involves divergence as the two copies accumulate different mutations and specialize in their retained subfunctions.\n    *   Because it quickly resolves the issue of redundancy, many evolutionary biologists consider subfunctionalization a very common and powerful mechanism for the preservation of duplicate genes.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary term describing the rapid diversification of a single lineage into many new species that occupy different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a *molecular mechanism* that explains the retention and divergence of a specific gene pair within a genome. It operates at the level of species and populations, not individual genes.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the plausible mechanisms and select the \"most likely\" one.**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models for the fate of duplicate genes. However, the question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n\nThe main challenge for retaining a new duplicate gene is surviving the initial period when it is redundant and prone to being lost.\n*   **Neofunctionalization** requires the duplicate to survive this period and then develop a novel function, which is a relatively rare evolutionary event.\n*   **Subfunctionalization** provides a more straightforward path to retention. It only requires the complementary loss of pre-existing functions, which is a much more common type of mutational event than the gain of a new one. This process quickly makes both copies essential, locking them into the genome.\n\nTherefore, subfunctionalization is considered a more common and immediate mechanism for ensuring the **retention** of duplicate genes, which is the crucial first step. Once retained, the genes can continue to diverge, sometimes even leading to neofunctionalization later on. Given this, subfunctionalization is the most likely general mechanism responsible for the widespread retention and divergence of duplicate genes observed in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
