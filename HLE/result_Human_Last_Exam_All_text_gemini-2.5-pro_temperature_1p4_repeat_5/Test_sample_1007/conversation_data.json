    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**Objective:** To identify the ballet step from the given options where the final leg position is identical to the initial leg position. \"Position\" refers to the placement of the feet (e.g., fifth position) and which foot is in front.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Choice A: Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a vertical jump in which the legs cross and uncross in the air. The number \"six\" refers to six movements (e.g., from fifth, legs open to second, beat behind the calf, open to second, beat in front of the calf, open to second, and close back in the starting fifth position).\n    *   **Ending Position:** The legs complete a full cycle of beats and land in the exact same fifth position from which the step began (right foot remains in front). All even-numbered entrechats (quatre, six, huit) by definition start and end in the same position.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a strong candidate because returning to the start is fundamental to its definition.\n\n2.  **Analyze Choice B: Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** *Échappé* means \"to escape,\" a jump from a closed to an open position. *Battu* means \"beaten.\" The key term here is ***changé***, which means \"changed.\" The dancer jumps from fifth, opens to second, and then springs back to fifth, but with the feet switched.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (left foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The name of the step itself tells you the position changes.\n\n3.  **Analyze Choice C: Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Let's assume fifth position (e.g., right foot back).\n    *   **Execution:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" It's a jump from one foot to two. A common form is *assemblé dessus* (over), where the back foot brushes to the side, the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and both legs are \"assembled\" together to land in fifth position with the working foot now in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, but the feet have switched places (right foot is now in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Assemblé is a fundamental step for traveling and changing direction, which usually necessitates changing which foot is in front.\n\n4.  **Analyze Choice D: Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** *Glissade* is a \"glide.\" *Derrière* means \"behind.\" To execute this, the back foot (left foot) glides out to the side, weight is transferred onto it, and the other foot (right foot) closes *behind* it into fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, but the feet have changed (left foot is now in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a traveling step that, by its standard execution, results in a change of feet.\n\n5.  **Analyze Choice E: Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step, often described as a *pas de chat* with a circular movement (*rond de jambe*) from each leg. In a common execution traveling to the right, the right leg performs a *rond de jambe en dehors* (outward) and the left leg performs a *rond de jambe en dedans* (inward). The dancer lands on the right foot and the left foot closes behind.\n    *   **Ending Position:** In this typical execution, the step finishes in the same fifth position it started (right foot remains in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** While a standard *gargouillade* can end in the same position, variations exist, and it's not as intrinsically defined by its non-changing nature as an even-numbered entrechat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing all the options, **Échappé battu changé**, **Assemblé**, and **Glissade derrière** are all steps that fundamentally involve changing the position of the feet. Both **Entrechat six** and **Gargouillade** *can* end in the same position they start. However, for an **Entrechat six**, returning to the original position is a core, defining element of the step. For a **Gargouillade**, while often performed this way, the non-changing aspect is not as fundamental to its identity. Therefore, **Entrechat six** is the most precise and correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
