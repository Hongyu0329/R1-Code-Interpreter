    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron**\n*   An icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   Each of its 20 faces is an equilateral triangle.\n*   The icosahedron is a \"centrally symmetric\" object. This means it has a center point, and for any point on the solid, there is an identical point on the opposite side, an equal distance from the center. This symmetry is key to solving the problem.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Orientation and Filling Condition**\n*   The tank is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of the triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n*   Because the icosahedron is symmetric, if it has a base face, it must also have a perfectly parallel top face.\n*   The tank is \"half-filled with water\". This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Height of the Water Surface**\n*   For any centrally symmetric solid, a plane passing through its center of symmetry will divide the solid's volume into two equal halves.\n*   When the icosahedron stands on a face, its center of symmetry is located exactly at the halfway point between the base face and the parallel top face. Let's say the total height is H. The center is at height H/2.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled by volume, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron. This water surface is therefore at a height of H/2.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section**\n*   We need to find the shape of the intersection of this horizontal mid-plane (the water surface) with the icosahedron. This intersection will be a polygon.\n*   To determine the polygon's shape, we can analyze how the plane cuts the edges of the icosahedron.\n*   Let's consider the vertices of the icosahedron in this orientation. They are arranged in four layers:\n    1.  **Base Layer:** 3 vertices forming the bottom triangle.\n    2.  **Lower-Mid Layer:** 3 vertices at a height above the base.\n    3.  **Upper-Mid Layer:** 3 vertices at a height further above.\n    4.  **Top Layer:** 3 vertices forming the top triangle.\n*   The water surface plane at height H/2 lies exactly between the \"Lower-Mid Layer\" and the \"Upper-Mid Layer\" of vertices.\n*   Therefore, the plane does not pass through any vertices. It must cut the edges that connect the vertices in the lower half of the icosahedron to the vertices in the upper half.\n*   The edges that are cut are precisely those connecting the 3 vertices of the Lower-Mid Layer to the 3 vertices of the Upper-Mid Layer.\n*   By inspecting the structure of an icosahedron, we find there are exactly **six** such edges that form a \"belt\" or \"equator\" around the middle of the shape.\n*   The water surface will intersect these six edges, forming a six-sided polygon (a hexagon).\n\n**Step 5: Determine if the Hexagon is Regular**\n*   The icosahedron has a 3-fold rotational symmetry around the vertical axis (the line passing through the centers of the base and top faces). The water surface is perpendicular to this axis. Therefore, the resulting hexagon must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   The icosahedron also has central symmetry. The water surface passes through this center of symmetry. This means the resulting hexagon must also be centrally symmetric.\n*   A six-sided polygon that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry must be a **regular hexagon**. All its sides will be of equal length, and all its internal angles will be equal (120 degrees).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen an icosahedron-shaped tank standing on a face is filled to half its volume, the water level reaches the exact middle height. The cross-section at this height, which forms the surface of the water, is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<a regular hexagon>>>"
