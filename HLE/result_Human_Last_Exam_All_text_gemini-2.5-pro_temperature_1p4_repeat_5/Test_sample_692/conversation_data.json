    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The core of the question is to identify the \"earliest known date recorded\" by a pre-Columbian civilization in its native writing system. Key elements are:\n    *   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This refers to the oldest specific point in time that is documented on an artifact.\n    *   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be inscribed or written down.\n    *   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must predate 1492.\n    *   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The script must be indigenous to the Americas (e.g., Maya, Zapotec, Olmec).\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Calendrical Systems**: Mesoamerican civilizations used sophisticated calendars. The two most relevant are:\n    *   **The 260-day Sacred Calendar (Tzolk'in in Maya)**: A cyclical calendar where a specific day name (e.g., \"7 Deer\") repeats every 260 days.\n    *   **The Long Count**: An absolute, non-repeating calendar that counts days from a mythological starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE). This system allows for the recording of specific, unique historical dates.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Evidence from the 260-day Calendar**: There are extremely old examples of written dates from the 260-day calendar.\n    *   **San Bartolo, Guatemala**: In 2022, archaeologists announced the discovery of a painted plaster fragment showing the glyph for \"7 Deer\". The artifact's context was radiocarbon dated to **c. 300-200 BCE**. This is the earliest *securely dated example of writing a date*.\n    *   **Careful Point**: While the artifact is very old, the date it records (\"7 Deer\") is cyclical. Without the radiocarbon dating of the artifact, we would not know *which* specific \"7 Deer\" day in history it referred to. The inscription itself does not specify a unique year.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Evidence from the Long Count Calendar**: The Long Count calendar records absolute dates that do not repeat for over 5,000 years. These inscriptions are self-contained records of a specific moment in time. Several artifacts contain very early Long Count dates:\n    *   **Tuxtla Statuette**: Contains a Long Count date corresponding to **162 CE**.\n    *   **La Mojarra Stela 1**: Contains a Long Count date corresponding to **156 CE**.\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C**: Contains a Long Count date (7.16.6.16.18) that corresponds to **32 BCE**.\n    *   **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico**: Contains the Long Count date 7.16.3.2.13. This is even earlier than the Tres Zapotes stela.\n\n5.  **Determine the Earliest Long Count Date**: To find the earliest recorded absolute date, we compare the Long Count inscriptions. The date on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo (7.16.3.2.13) precedes the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C (7.16.6.16.18). When converted to the Gregorian calendar (using the standard GMT correlation), the date on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo corresponds to **December 7, 36 BCE**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The earliest physical *evidence* of calendrical writing is the \"7 Deer\" fragment from San Bartolo (c. 300-200 BCE).\n    *   However, the earliest *specific, absolute date recorded*, which can be read directly from the inscription without external dating methods, is the Long Count date on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo.\n    *   Since the question asks \"What is the earliest known date recorded?\", the most precise and fitting answer is the absolute date from the Long Count system, as it pinpoints a unique moment in history.\n\nTherefore, the earliest known absolute date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is **36 BCE**.\n\n<<<36 BCE>>>"
