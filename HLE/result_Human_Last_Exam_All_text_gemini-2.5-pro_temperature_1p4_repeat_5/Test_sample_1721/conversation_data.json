    "Answering the question: What is the largest number $c$ such that there exists $A\\subseteq \\{1,…,N\\}$ and $|A|= (c+o(1))N $, $A+A$ contains no square numbers?\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the problem\n\n1.  **Understanding the definitions:**\n    *   $A$ is a subset of the first $N$ positive integers, $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\n    *   $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ means we are looking for the asymptotic density of the largest possible set $A$. The term $o(1)$ is a function of $N$ that goes to 0 as $N \\to \\infty$. So, $c = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N}$.\n    *   $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$. This includes sums where $a_1=a_2$.\n    *   The condition is that for any pair of elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum $a_1+a_2$ is never a perfect square (i.e., not a member of $\\{1, 4, 9, 16, \\dots\\}$).\n\n2.  **Strategy: Using Modular Arithmetic to Construct a set A**\n    A powerful method to control the properties of sums is to consider the numbers modulo some integer $m$. If we can show that for all $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, the sum $a_1+a_2$ has a specific remainder modulo $m$ that no square number can have, then we have found a valid set $A$.\n\n3.  **Careful Point: Choice of Modulus**\n    Let's analyze the remainders of square numbers modulo different integers $m$.\n    *   **Modulo 3:** Any integer $k$ can be written as $3j$, $3j+1$, or $3j+2$.\n        *   $(3j)^2 = 9j^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\n        *   $(3j+1)^2 = 9j^2+6j+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n        *   $(3j+2)^2 = 9j^2+12j+4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n        So, any perfect square is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 3. No square is ever congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n    *   **Modulo 4:** Any integer $k$ can be written as $4j, 4j+1, 4j+2, 4j+3$.\n        *   $(2j)^2 = 4j^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$.\n        *   $(2j+1)^2 = 4j^2+4j+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\n        So, any perfect square is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 4. No square is ever congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4.\n\n    The modulo 3 case provides a simple structure that we can exploit. If we can construct a set $A$ where all sums $a_1+a_2$ are congruent to 2 modulo 3, we are done.\n\n### Constructing the set A and finding a lower bound for c\n\n1.  **Construction of A:**\n    Let's choose our set $A$ to be composed of numbers that all have the same residue modulo 3. Let's try picking numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n    Let $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\n2.  **Verification of the condition:**\n    Let $a_1, a_2$ be any two elements in this set $A$. Then $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n    Their sum is $a_1+a_2 \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n    As we established, no perfect square can be congruent to 2 modulo 3. Therefore, $a_1+a_2$ can never be a perfect square. This construction is valid.\n3.  **Calculating the size of A:**\n    The set $A$ consists of the numbers $1, 4, 7, 10, \\dots$. This is an arithmetic progression.\n    The general term is $3k+1$. We need $3k+1 \\le N$, which means $3k \\le N-1$, or $k \\le (N-1)/3$. Since $k$ starts from 0 (for the number 1), the number of elements in $A$ is $|A| = \\lfloor \\frac{N-1}{3} \\rfloor + 1$.\n    For large $N$, $|A| = \\frac{N}{3} + O(1)$.\n4.  **Finding the density c:**\n    The density is $c = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N} = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{N/3 + O(1)}{N} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n    This construction proves that there exists such a set $A$ with density $1/3$. Therefore, the largest possible value of $c$ must be at least $1/3$. So, $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n### Proving that this is the maximal density (Upper Bound)\n\nThis part is more advanced and relies on results from combinatorial number theory, particularly a result by Ruzsa. We can sketch the main idea.\n\n1.  **Graph-Theoretic Formulation:**\n    Let's define a graph $G$ with vertex set $V=\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. An edge exists between two vertices $i$ and $j$ if their sum $i+j$ is a perfect square. The set $A$ we are looking for is an independent set in this graph $G$ (a set of vertices where no two are connected by an edge). The problem is to find the maximum size of an independent set in $G$, denoted $\\alpha(G)$.\n\n2.  **Analysis using Modulo 3 Partition:**\n    Let's partition the set of vertices $V$ into three sets based on their remainders modulo 3:\n    *   $B_0 = \\{n \\in V \\mid n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\\}$\n    *   $B_1 = \\{n \\in V \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$\n    *   $B_2 = \\{n \\in V \\mid n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$\n    Each of these sets has size approximately $N/3$.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Edges in the Graph:**\n    Let's check for edges within and between these partitions:\n    *   If $i,j \\in B_1$, then $i+j \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. This sum cannot be a square. Thus, there are no edges within $B_1$. This means **$B_1$ is an independent set**.\n    *   If $i \\in B_0, j \\in B_2$, then $i+j \\equiv 0+2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. This sum cannot be a square. Thus, there are no edges between $B_0$ and $B_2$.\n    *   Edges can exist within $B_0$, within $B_2$, between $B_0$ and $B_1$, and between $B_1$ and $B_2$.\n\n4.  **The Upper Bound Argument:**\n    *   We already found a large independent set, $B_1$, of size $\\approx N/3$.\n    *   Let $A$ be any independent set. We can partition it as $A = A_0 \\cup A_1 \\cup A_2$, where $A_i = A \\cap B_i$.\n    *   Since $A$ is an independent set, if we include any elements from $B_0$ or $B_2$ in our set $A$ (i.e., if $A_0$ or $A_2$ is non-empty), we must exclude their neighbors from $A_1$.\n    *   Let $S = A_0 \\cup A_2$. For $A$ to be an independent set, $A_1$ cannot contain any neighbor of any vertex in $S$. Let $N(S)$ be the set of all neighbors of vertices in $S$. Then $A_1 \\subseteq B_1 \\setminus N(S)$.\n    *   The size of $A$ is $|A| = |A_1| + |S| \\le |B_1| - |N(S) \\cap B_1| + |S|$.\n    *   So, $|A| \\le |B_1| + (|S| - |N(S) \\cap B_1|)$.\n    *   To get a set larger than $B_1$, the term $|S| - |N(S) \\cap B_1|$ would need to be positive.\n    *   It can be shown (this is the core of Ruzsa's proof) that for any independent set $S \\subseteq B_0 \\cup B_2$, the number of neighbors it has in $B_1$ is at least as large as the set itself, up to lower order terms. That is, $|N(S) \\cap B_1| \\ge |S| - o(N)$.\n    *   This implies $|A| \\le |B_1| + o(N) = N/3 + o(N)$.\n    *   Therefore, the asymptotic density $c$ cannot be greater than $1/3$. So, $c \\le 1/3$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown through construction that $c \\ge 1/3$ and we have outlined the argument that $c \\le 1/3$. Combining these two results, we find that the largest possible value for $c$ is exactly $1/3$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
