    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem's Components**\n\n*   **Group (G):** The group is $G = T \\times T$, the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself.\n*   **Cohomology Theory:** We are asked about Bounded Cohomology, denoted $H_b^*(G, E)$. This is different from ordinary group cohomology $H^*(G, E)$. It is defined as the cohomology of the complex of bounded cochains.\n*   **Degree (n):** We are interested in degree $n=4$.\n*   **Coefficients (E):** The coefficients are the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, with the trivial group action. This is a Banach module where the norm is the absolute value.\n\n**Step 2: The Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology**\n\nA key tool for computing the cohomology of a product group is the Künneth formula. For bounded cohomology with trivial real coefficients, there is an isomorphism of Banach spaces:\n$$H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R}) \\hat{\\otimes} H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R})$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\otimes}$ denotes the completed projective tensor product of Banach spaces, and the direct sum is over all non-negative integers $p, q$ such that $p+q=n$.\n\nFor calculating the dimension, this formula simplifies. The dimension of a direct sum is the sum of dimensions, and the dimension of a tensor product is the product of dimensions. Let $d_k(G) = \\dim H_b^k(G, \\mathbb{R})$. Then:\n$$\\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} d_p(G_1) \\cdot d_q(G_2)$$\n\nIn our case, $G_1 = G_2 = T$ and $n=4$. Let's denote $d_k = d_k(T)$. The formula is:\n$$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} d_p \\cdot d_q = d_0 d_4 + d_1 d_3 + d_2 d_2 + d_3 d_1 + d_4 d_0$$\n\n**Step 3: Dimensions of the Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T**\n\nThe next step is to find the values for $d_k = \\dim H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R})$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. These are standard, though highly non-trivial, results in the theory of bounded cohomology.\n\n*   **$d_0 = \\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R})$:** For any non-empty group $G$, $H_b^0(G, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $d_0 = 1$.\n*   **$d_1 = \\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R})$:** For any group $G$, $H_b^1(G, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{0\\}$. Thus, $d_1 = 0$.\n*   **$d_2 = \\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$:** A famous result by Étienne Ghys shows that $H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$ is a one-dimensional space, generated by the bounded Euler class arising from the action of T on the circle. Thus, $d_2 = 1$.\n*   **$d_3 = \\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R})$:** It is a known result, due to Grigorchuk and others, that $H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R})$ is an infinite-dimensional vector space. Thus, $d_3 = \\infty$.\n*   **$d_4 = \\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})$:** More generally, a result by Nicolas Monod shows that $H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R})$ is infinite-dimensional for all $k \\ge 3$. Therefore, $d_4 = \\infty$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute these dimensions into the Künneth formula expression derived in Step 2:\n$$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = (d_0 \\cdot d_4) + (d_1 \\cdot d_3) + (d_2 \\cdot d_2) + (d_3 \\cdot d_1) + (d_4 \\cdot d_0)$$\n$$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = (1 \\cdot \\infty) + (0 \\cdot \\infty) + (1 \\cdot 1) + (\\infty \\cdot 0) + (\\infty \\cdot 1)$$\n\nWe evaluate each term using the arithmetic of cardinal dimensions:\n*   $1 \\cdot \\infty = \\infty$\n*   $0 \\cdot \\infty = 0$\n*   $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n*   $\\infty \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   $\\infty \\cdot 1 = \\infty$\n\nSumming these results gives the total dimension:\n$$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\infty + 0 + 1 + 0 + \\infty = \\infty$$\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe dimension of the direct sum contains infinite-dimensional summands (specifically, the terms corresponding to $(p,q)=(0,4)$ and $(4,0)$). The presence of even one infinite-dimensional summand makes the total space infinite-dimensional. Therefore, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients is infinite.\n\n<<<Infinity>>>"
