    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the correct musical piece and section.**\nThe piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". We need to examine the score at the very end of the final movement, which is the 4th movement (Allegro con fuoco). We must focus specifically on the part written for the first violins (Violino I).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the final measures for the first violin.**\nLooking at the full orchestral score, the very last measure of the symphony for the first violins consists of a single whole note. This note is a **D5** (the D located on the fourth line of the treble clef).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the \"three notes\" the part ends on.**\nThe question states the part \"ends on three notes\". This refers to the final melodic sequence. The single final D5 is the last note. To find the other two, we must look at the notes immediately preceding it in the second-to-last measure. In that measure, the first violins play a rapid descending run of sixteenth notes. The last two notes of that run, which lead directly into the final note of the piece, are **D5** followed by **C#5** (C-sharp 5).\n\n**Step 4: List the last three notes in chronological order.**\nBased on the score, the last three notes played in sequence by the first violin are:\n1.  **D5** (the third-to-last note, a sixteenth note)\n2.  **C#5** (the second-to-last note, a sixteenth note)\n3.  **D5** (the final note, a whole note)\n\n**Step 5: Compare the pitches of the three notes.**\nNow we compare the pitches of D5, C#5, and D5 to find the lowest one. In the musical scale, C# is a semitone (half-step) lower than D.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the three notes (D5, C#5, D5), the note with the lowest pitch is **C#5**.\n\n<<<C#>>>"
