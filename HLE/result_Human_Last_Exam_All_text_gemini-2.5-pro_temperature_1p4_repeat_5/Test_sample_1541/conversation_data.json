    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory usage.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to take an input string representing a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), like \"3+2+1+4+1\", and output a new string where the numbers are sorted in non-decreasing order, like \"1+1+2+3+4\". The secondary and crucial goal is to design a C program that achieves this using the minimum possible memory for its variables.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Input:**\n    *   The input is a string.\n    *   It contains only the digits '1', '2', '3', '4' and the '+' character.\n    *   The maximum length of the string is 1000 characters.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Solution Strategy:**\n    *   **Sorting:** The core of the problem is sorting the numbers. Since the set of numbers is very small and fixed (1, 2, 3, 4), the most efficient sorting algorithm is **Counting Sort**. We don't need a general-purpose algorithm like quicksort, nor do we need to store all the numbers in a large array.\n    *   **Input Handling:** A naive approach would be to read the entire string into a character array (e.g., `char s[1001];`), which would immediately consume over 1000 bytes. A far more memory-efficient approach is to read the input character by character using a function like `getchar()`, processing each character as it comes in and discarding it. This avoids storing the whole string.\n    *   **Output Generation:** We can print the sorted sum directly to the standard output. There is no need to build the entire output string in memory first. We can print the required number of '1's, then '2's, and so on, carefully placing '+' characters between them.\n\n### List of Careful Points for Memory Optimization\n\n1.  **Avoid Storing the Input String:** As mentioned, use `getchar()` in a loop to read one character at a time. This is the single biggest memory saving.\n\n2.  **Use Counting Sort:** We only need to store the *counts* of each number (1, 2, 3, 4), not the numbers themselves. This requires a small, fixed-size array.\n\n3.  **Choose the Smallest Possible Data Types:** This is critical for minimizing memory. We must analyze the range of values each variable needs to hold. In a typical competitive programming environment, `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte, `sizeof(short)` is 2 bytes, and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n    *   **Character Input Variable:** The `getchar()` function returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` (End of File) value. Therefore, the variable that stores its return value *must* be an `int`.\n    *   **Count Array:** The input string has a maximum length of 1000. The maximum number of summands is `(1000 + 1) / 2 = 500.5`, rounded to 501. Thus, any single number can appear at most 501 times.\n        *   A `char` (1 byte, max value 255) is insufficient.\n        *   A `short` (2 bytes, max value 32,767) is sufficient.\n        We will use an array of 4 `short`s: `short counts[4];`.\n    *   **Loop Counters:** The printing logic will involve a nested loop.\n        *   The outer loop iterates through the numbers 1 to 4. A counter from 0 to 3 can be stored in a `char`.\n        *   The inner loop iterates up to the count of a specific number, which can be as high as 501. This counter must be a `short`.\n    *   **Output Formatting Flag:** To correctly print the '+' signs (not after the last number), we need a flag or a counter. A simple flag (e.g., `is_first`) only needs to store 0 or 1, so a `char` is the most efficient choice.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nLet's design the C program with these optimizations and calculate the total memory used by its variables.\n\n**1. Variable Declaration and Memory Calculation:**\n\n*   **`short counts[4];`**\n    *   Purpose: To store the counts of numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n    *   Reasoning: Max count is 501, which fits in a `short`.\n    *   Memory: `4 * sizeof(short) = 4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n\n*   **`int c;`**\n    *   Purpose: To store the return value of `getchar()`.\n    *   Reasoning: `getchar()` returns an `int` to handle `EOF`.\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n\n*   **`char is_first;`**\n    *   Purpose: A flag to manage printing the '+' separator. Stores 1 initially, then 0.\n    *   Reasoning: A boolean flag fits in a `char`.\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n*   **`char i;`**\n    *   Purpose: The outer loop counter, iterating from 0 to 3.\n    *   Reasoning: The range 0-3 fits comfortably in a `char`.\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\n*   **`short j;`**\n    *   Purpose: The inner loop counter, iterating up to `counts[i]` (max 501).\n    *   Reasoning: Max value 501 requires a `short`.\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(short) = 2` bytes.\n\n**2. Program Logic:**\n\n*   Initialize `counts` array to all zeros and `is_first` to 1.\n*   Loop using `while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF)`:\n    *   If `c` is a digit '1' through '4', increment the appropriate counter (e.g., `counts[c - '1']++`).\n*   Loop `for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)`:\n    *   Loop `for (j = 0; j < counts[i]; j++)`:\n        *   If `is_first` is false (i.e., this is not the very first number printed), print a '+'.\n        *   Print the number `i + '1'`.\n        *   Set `is_first` to false.\n\n**3. Final Memory Tally:**\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all variables:\n`m = (memory for counts) + (memory for c) + (memory for is_first) + (memory for i) + (memory for j)`\n`m = 8 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2`\n`m = 16`\n\nThe total memory used for variables in the most memory-efficient C program is 16 bytes.\n\n<<<16>>>"
