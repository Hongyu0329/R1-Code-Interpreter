    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set of real numbers $A$ is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums of its elements are distinct, up to the order of the summands. Formally, if $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \\in A$ satisfy $a_1 + a_2 = a_3 + a_4$, then the multisets $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$ and $\\{a_3, a_4\\}$ must be identical. This means either ($a_1=a_3$ and $a_2=a_4$) or ($a_1=a_4$ and $a_2=a_3$). A key consequence is that if $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ are distinct elements of a Sidon set, then $x_1+x_2 \\neq x_3+x_4$. Also, if $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are distinct, then $2x_1 \\neq x_2+x_3$.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, $\\dim_H(F)$, is a way to assign a (possibly non-integer) dimension to a set $F$. It generalizes our intuitive notion of dimension. For any set $A \\subseteq [0, 1]$, its Hausdorff dimension satisfies $0 \\le \\dim_H(A) \\le 1$.\n\nThe question asks for the supremum of $\\dim_H(A)$ over all sets $A \\subseteq [0, 1]$ that are Sidon sets.\n\n### Step 2: Deriving an Upper Bound for the Dimension\n\nThis part of the analysis uses a result from geometric measure theory concerning the dimension of projected sets.\n\n1.  Let $A \\subseteq [0, 1]$ be a Sidon set, and let its Hausdorff dimension be $s = \\dim_H(A)$.\n2.  Consider the Cartesian product $A \\times A = \\{(x, y) | x, y \\in A\\}$, which is a subset of the unit square in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. A standard result states that the Hausdorff dimension of a product of sets is the sum of their dimensions: $\\dim_H(A \\times A) = \\dim_H(A) + \\dim_H(A) = 2s$.\n3.  Consider the sum set $A+A = \\{x+y | x, y \\in A\\}$. Since $A \\subseteq [0, 1]$, the sum set $A+A$ must be a subset of $[0, 2]$. Therefore, its Hausdorff dimension is at most the dimension of the interval $[0, 2]$, which is 1. So, $\\dim_H(A+A) \\le 1$.\n4.  Let's relate the dimension of $A \\times A$ to the dimension of $A+A$. The sum set $A+A$ can be viewed as the image of the set $A \\times A$ under the map $f(x, y) = x+y$. This map is a linear projection (after a rotation of coordinates), which is a very \"smooth\" map (specifically, it's Lipschitz).\n5.  The Sidon property of $A$ places a strong constraint on the preimages of this map. For any value $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the preimage (or fiber) is the line $x+y=c$. The intersection of this line with the set $A \\times A$ consists of pairs $(x,y)$ from $A \\times A$ that sum to $c$. The Sidon property implies that if $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are in this intersection, then $\\{x_1, y_1\\} = \\{x_2, y_2\\}$. This means the intersection can contain at most two points: $(a, b)$ and $(b, a)$ for some $a, b \\in A$.\n6.  A set consisting of a finite number of points has a Hausdorff dimension of 0. So, for any $c$, the fiber $(A \\times A) \\cap \\{(x, y) | x+y=c\\}$ has dimension 0.\n7.  A fundamental result in geometric measure theory (a consequence of Marstrand's projection theorem, refined by Kaufman, Peres, and others) states that for a sufficiently nice map like our projection $f$, the dimension of the image is at least the dimension of the original set minus the maximum dimension of the fibers.\n    More formally: $\\dim_H(\\text{Image}) \\ge \\dim_H(\\text{Domain}) - \\sup_c \\dim_H(\\text{Fiber}_c)$.\n8.  Applying this to our case:\n    $\\dim_H(A+A) \\ge \\dim_H(A \\times A) - \\sup_c \\dim_H((A \\times A) \\cap f^{-1}(c))$.\n    Substituting the dimensions we found: $\\dim_H(A+A) \\ge 2s - 0 = 2s$.\n9.  Combining this with the fact that $\\dim_H(A+A) \\le 1$, we get the inequality:\n    $1 \\ge 2s$.\n10. This implies $s \\le 1/2$. Thus, the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ cannot exceed 1/2.\n\n### Step 3: Showing the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nTo show that 1/2 is the maximum possible dimension, we need to demonstrate the existence of a Sidon set $A \\subseteq [0,1]$ with $\\dim_H(A) = 1/2$. This is a more complex task, as simple constructions tend to fail.\n\n1.  A natural candidate for a set with a specific dimension is a Cantor-type set. For example, consider the set $C = \\{ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty d_k 4^{-k} \\mid d_k \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\}$. This set is known to have Hausdorff dimension $\\dim_H(C) = \\frac{\\log(2)}{\\log(4)} = 1/2$.\n2.  However, this specific set $C$ is *not* a Sidon set. For example, let $x = 1/4 = 0.100..._4$ and $y = 1/3 = 0.111..._4$ (which can be written as $\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty 4^{-k}$). Both $x$ and $y$ are in $C$. Their sum is $x+y = 7/12$. Now consider $z = 4/15 = 0.101010..._4$ and $w=19/60 = 0.110101..._4$. Both $z$ and $w$ also belong to $C$. Their sum is $z+w = 4/15 + 19/60 = (16+19)/60 = 35/60 = 7/12$. We have $x+y=z+w$, but the sets of summands $\\{1/4, 1/3\\}$ and $\\{4/15, 19/60\\}$ are different. Therefore, $C$ is not a Sidon set.\n\n3.  The construction of a Sidon set with dimension 1/2 is considerably more subtle. Such constructions have been established in the mathematical literature. For example, S. Astels in 2001 demonstrated the existence of such sets. The methods can be quite involved, sometimes using probabilistic arguments or carefully tweaking the construction of Cantor sets to eliminate the arithmetic coincidences that violate the Sidon property.\n\n4.  While the explicit construction is complex, the existence of a Sidon set with dimension 1/2 is a known result in the field. This establishes that the upper bound of 1/2 is sharp.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the results from Step 2 and Step 3:\n*   The Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in $[0,1]$ is at most 1/2.\n*   There exist Sidon sets in $[0,1]$ whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1/2.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
