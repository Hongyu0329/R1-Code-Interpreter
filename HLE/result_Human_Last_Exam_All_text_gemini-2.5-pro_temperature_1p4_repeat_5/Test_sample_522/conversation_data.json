    "This puzzle involves transforming a 2D grid of digits based on a set of rules. The input and output are string representations of these grids, with rows separated by commas.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Parse the Input/Output:** The strings represent grids. For example, `Input_A='001111,121111,111111'` corresponds to the grid:\n    ```\n    001111\n    121111\n    111111\n    ```\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Transformation:** By comparing the input and output grids in examples A and B, we can observe the changes. The primary agent of change is the digit '2'. In every case, the '2' moves to a new location, and its original location becomes a '0'. The destination for the '2' is always a cell that originally contained a '0'. This suggests a swap operation: the '2' swaps places with one of its neighboring '0's.\n\n3.  **Determine the Selection Rule:** The main challenge is to figure out which neighboring '0' the '2' swaps with if multiple options exist. Let's analyze the choices made in the given examples.\n    *   **In Example A:**\n        *   Input Grid:\n            ```\n            001111\n            121111\n            111111\n            ```\n        *   The '2' is at position (row=2, col=2). Its neighbors containing '0' are at (1,1) and (1,2).\n        *   Output Grid:\n            ```\n            201111\n            101111\n            111111\n            ```\n        *   The '2' swaps with the '0' at (1,1).\n\n    *   **In Example B:**\n        *   The '2' is at (row=4, col=7). Its neighbors containing '0' are at (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), and (4,6).\n        *   The output shows the '2' moves to (3,8).\n\n4.  **Establish a Priority Order for the Swap:** We need a consistent rule that explains why (1,1) was chosen in A and (3,8) in B. Let's test a priority order for checking the 8 neighbors of the '2'. Let `(r, c)` be the coordinates of the '2'. We check neighbors in a specific sequence and perform the swap with the first one that contains a '0'.\n    The following priority order works for both examples A and B:\n    1.  **Up-Right** `(r-1, c+1)`\n    2.  **Up-Left** `(r-1, c-1)`\n    3.  **Up** `(r-1, c)`\n    4.  **Right** `(r, c+1)`\n    5.  **Left** `(r, c-1)`\n    6.  **Down-Right** `(r+1, c+1)`\n    7.  **Down-Left** `(r+1, c-1)`\n    8.  **Down** `(r+1, c)`\n\n    *   **Applying to A:** '2' is at (2,2).\n        1. Check Up-Right (1,3): Value is '1'. No swap.\n        2. Check Up-Left (1,1): Value is '0'. Swap! This matches the output.\n\n    *   **Applying to B:** '2' is at (4,7).\n        1. Check Up-Right (3,8): Value is '0'. Swap! This matches the output.\n\n5.  **Solve for Input_C:** Now we apply the discovered rule to `Input_C`.\n    *   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n    *   Grid representation:\n        ```\n        000000  (Row 1)\n        011120  (Row 2)\n        111111  (Row 3)\n        ```\n    *   The '2' is located at (row=2, col=5).\n    *   We check its neighbors using the established priority order to find the first '0'.\n        1.  Check **Up-Right** `(r-1, c+1)` -> `(2-1, 5+1)` -> `(1, 6)`.\n        2.  The value at (1,6) is '0'.\n    *   We have found our swap target. The '2' at (2,5) will swap with the '0' at (1,6).\n    *   The character at (1,6) becomes '2'. The new Row 1 is `000002`.\n    *   The character at (2,5) becomes '0'. The new Row 2 is `011100`.\n    *   Row 3 remains unchanged: `111111`.\n\n6.  **Construct the Final Output:** Combining the new rows gives the final grid:\n    ```\n    000002\n    011100\n    111111\n    ```\n    In string format, this is `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe value for MISSING is the result of applying this transformation to Input_C.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
