    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the structure of the semidihedral group and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order `2^n`, denoted `SD_{2^n}`, is a non-abelian group. The question specifies a size of 512. Since `512 = 2^9`, we are dealing with `SD_{2^9}`.\n*   **Presentation of SD_{2^9}:** The group `G = SD_{512}` can be defined by the presentation:\n    `G = <r, s | r^(2^(9-1)) = s^2 = 1,  srs = r^(2^(9-2) - 1)>`\n    This simplifies to:\n    `G = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1,  srs = r^127>`\n    The elements of `G` are of the form `r^i` and `sr^i` for `0 <= i < 256`. The group has a cyclic subgroup `<r>` of order 256.\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup `H` of a group `G` is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer `d` such that `H` is the set of all `d`-th powers of elements in `G`. We denote this subgroup as `G^d = {g^d | g in G}`. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Exponent of the Group**\n\nThe set of power subgroups `P(G) = {G^d | d in Z}` is determined by the exponents `d`. For a finite group, the set of power subgroups is finite. The structure of these subgroups is related to the exponent of the group, `exp(G)`, which is the least common multiple of the orders of all elements in `G`.\n\n*   **Orders of elements in `<r>`:** The order of `r^i` is `256 / gcd(i, 256)`. These orders are all the powers of 2 from `2^0=1` to `2^8=256`.\n*   **Orders of elements not in `<r>`:** These are elements of the form `sr^i`. We calculate the square of such an element:\n    `(sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i`\n    From the relation `srs = r^127`, we derive `sr = r^127 s`. By induction, one can show `sr^i = r^(127i) s`. Also, `r^i s = s r^(127i)`.\n    So, `(sr^i)^2 = s(r^i s)r^i = s(s r^(127i))r^i = s^2 r^(127i) r^i = r^(128i) = (r^128)^i`.\n    The element `r^128` has order 2.\n    *   If `i` is even, `i=2k`, then `(sr^i)^2 = (r^128)^(2k) = (r^256)^k = 1^k = 1`. So, `sr^i` has order 2.\n    *   If `i` is odd, `i=2k+1`, then `(sr^i)^2 = (r^128)^(2k+1) = r^128`. Then `(sr^i)^4 = (r^128)^2 = r^256 = 1`. So, `sr^i` has order 4.\n*   **Exponent:** The orders of elements in `G` are powers of 2, with the maximum order being 256 (the order of `r`). Thus, `exp(G) = 256`.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Search for Power Subgroups**\n\nFor any integer `d`, the power subgroup `G^d` is equal to `G^gcd(d, exp(G))`. In our case, `exp(G) = 256`. This means we only need to consider `d` that are divisors of 256. The divisors of `256 = 2^8` are `2^k` for `k = 0, 1, ..., 8`.\nSo, we need to find the distinct subgroups in the set `{ G^(2^k) | k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 }`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Power Subgroups G^(2^k)**\n\nWe will calculate `G^d` for `d = 2^k`. The set `G^d` is the union of `{ (r^i)^d }` and `{ (sr^i)^d }`.\n\n*   **k = 0 (d = 1):** `G^1 = {g^1 | g in G} = G`. This is the group itself.\n\n*   **k = 1 (d = 2):** `G^2 = {g^2 | g in G}`.\n    *   `{(r^i)^2} = {r^(2i)}` which forms the cyclic subgroup `<r^2>` of order 128.\n    *   `{(sr^i)^2} = {r^(128i)}`. For all `i`, this gives the set `{1, r^128}`.\n    *   `G^2 = <r^2> U {1, r^128}`. Since `r^128 = (r^2)^64`, the element `r^128` is already in `<r^2>`. Thus, `G^2 = <r^2>`.\n\n*   **k = 2 (d = 4):** `G^4 = {g^4 | g in G}`.\n    *   `{(r^i)^4} = {r^(4i)}` which forms the cyclic subgroup `<r^4>` of order 64.\n    *   `{(sr^i)^4} = {((sr^i)^2)^2} = {(r^(128i))^2} = {r^(256i)} = {1}`.\n    *   `G^4 = <r^4> U {1} = <r^4>`.\n\n*   **k >= 2 (d = 2^k):** `G^(2^k) = {g^(2^k) | g in G}`.\n    *   `{(r^i)^(2^k)} = <r^(2^k)>`.\n    *   Since `k >= 2`, `2^k` is a multiple of 4. `(sr^i)^4 = 1`, so `(sr^i)^(2^k) = ((sr^i)^4)^(2^(k-2)) = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, for `k >= 2`, `G^(2^k) = <r^(2^k)>`. This also holds for k=1 as `G^2 = <r^2>`.\n\n**Step 5: List and Count the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nWe now list the power subgroups we found for `k=0, 1, ..., 8`:\n1.  `k=0`: `G^1 = G` (Order 512, non-cyclic)\n2.  `k=1`: `G^2 = <r^2>` (Cyclic, Order 128)\n3.  `k=2`: `G^4 = <r^4>` (Cyclic, Order 64)\n4.  `k=3`: `G^8 = <r^8>` (Cyclic, Order 32)\n5.  `k=4`: `G^16 = <r^16>` (Cyclic, Order 16)\n6.  `k=5`: `G^32 = <r^32>` (Cyclic, Order 8)\n7.  `k=6`: `G^64 = <r^64>` (Cyclic, Order 4)\n8.  `k=7`: `G^128 = <r^128>` (Cyclic, Order 2)\n9.  `k=8`: `G^256 = <r^256> = {e}` (The trivial subgroup, Order 1)\n\nThese 9 subgroups are all distinct because they have different orders. Any power `d=2^k` for `k > 8` will result in the trivial subgroup since `d` would be a multiple of the exponent `256`.\n\nThus, there are exactly 9 distinct power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512."
