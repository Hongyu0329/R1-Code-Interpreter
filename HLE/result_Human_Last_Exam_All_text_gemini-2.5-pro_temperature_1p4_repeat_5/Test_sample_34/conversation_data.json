    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Game Conditions:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB rake-free cash game.\n    *   **Stack Depth (100BB):** This is the standard stack depth for which most preflop ranges are constructed. It allows for significant post-flop play.\n    *   **Rake-Free:** This is a crucial detail. Rake is a small fee taken from the pot by the house. In its absence, the pot odds for any preflop action are slightly better. This encourages opening a wider, more marginal range of hands than in a game with rake, as the profitability threshold for playing a hand is lower.\n    *   **Position (Button):** The button is the most powerful position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street (flop, turn, and river). This positional advantage is immense, as it allows you to realize your equity more effectively, control the size of the pot, and bluff more profitably. Consequently, you should play the widest range of hands from the button.\n    *   **Action (Open to 2.5x):** This is a standard opening size from late position.\n\n2.  **Define \"Worst Suited Jack to Open\":**\n    *   We are looking for the suited jack with the lowest kicker that is still considered a profitable, standard open-raise in this specific scenario.\n    *   The suited jacks, in order of descending strength, are: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n    *   The \"worst\" hand is the one at the very bottom of this list that should still be opened. Any hand weaker than this (which doesn't exist in the suited jack category) would be a fold.\n\n3.  **Consult a Standard Button Opening Range:**\n    *   According to Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategies for 100BB cash games, the button's opening range is extremely wide, often encompassing 45-50% of all possible starting hands.\n    *   This range is built on the principles of equity, playability, and blocker effects, all amplified by the huge positional advantage.\n    *   Let's examine how suited hands with a Jack are treated within these GTO ranges:\n        *   **JTs, J9s, J8s:** These are very strong hands with great straight and flush potential. They are always opened.\n        *   **J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s:** These hands retain significant playability due to their flush potential and some straight potential (especially gapped straights). The Jack provides decent high-card strength.\n        *   **J3s, J2s:** These are the weakest hands in the category. They have minimal straight potential but still carry the two key advantages: a reasonably high card (the Jack) and the potential to make the second-nut flush.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   Because the button has a massive positional advantage, and because the hand is suited (giving it a significant equity boost over its offsuit counterpart), modern poker theory dictates that *all* suited jacks are profitable opens from the button.\n    *   The \"rake-free\" condition further solidifies this conclusion. If J2s is a standard open in a game *with* rake (which it is, according to most GTO solvers), it is even more profitable to open in a game *without* rake.\n    *   Therefore, the range of suited jacks you should open is J2s through JTs.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Positional Power:** Do not underestimate the power of the button. Acting last is so valuable that it makes many seemingly marginal hands profitable.\n*   **Suitedness:** A hand being suited adds roughly 2-3% to its raw equity and dramatically improves its playability, allowing you to semi-bluff effectively with flush draws.\n*   **GTO vs. Exploitative Play:** While this analysis is based on GTO principles, even in an exploitative game against passive blinds, opening this wide is correct as they are likely to fold too often or play poorly post-flop.\n*   **The Cutoff:** The question is asking for the hand at the bottom of the \"open\" range. Since all suited jacks are considered standard opens from the button, the one with the lowest kicker (`J2s`) is the correct answer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe range of suited jacks that are profitable to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free game includes all of them, from JTs down to J2s. The \"worst\" of these, meaning the one with the lowest equity that is still a standard open, is the one with the lowest kicker.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
