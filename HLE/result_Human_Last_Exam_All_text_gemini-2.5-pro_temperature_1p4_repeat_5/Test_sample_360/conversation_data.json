    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the number of isomers formed.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Reactants**\n\n1.  **The Ruthenium Complex: `cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)`**\n    *   **Formula:** `cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]`\n    *   **Metal Center:** Ruthenium(II), which typically forms octahedral complexes with a coordination number of 6.\n    *   **Ligands:**\n        *   `Cl⁻` (chloro): Two monodentate, anionic ligands.\n        *   `bpy` (2,2'-bipyridine): Two bidentate, neutral, chelating ligands. 2,2'-bipyridine is a symmetrical ligand.\n    *   **Structure and Chirality:** The complex is octahedral. The `cis` designation means the two `Cl` ligands are in adjacent positions (90° apart). The two `bpy` ligands occupy the remaining four sites.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A complex of the type `cis-[M(AA)₂X₂]` (where AA is a symmetrical bidentate ligand and X is a monodentate ligand) is chiral. It lacks a plane of symmetry and a center of inversion. Therefore, `cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]` exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers. These are designated by the stereochemical descriptors Δ (delta) and Λ (lambda). Unless specified otherwise, the reactant is a racemic mixture (a 50:50 mix of the Δ and Λ enantiomers).\n\n2.  **The Ligand: `2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole`**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a large, aromatic, heterocyclic molecule. It consists of a central `thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole` core with a 2-pyridyl group attached at the 2 and 5 positions.\n    *   **Potential Donor Atoms:** It has four nitrogen atoms (two in the pyridyl rings, two in the thiazole rings) that can potentially coordinate to a metal center.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must determine how this ligand will coordinate to the ruthenium center in the final product.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Reaction and Product Structure**\n\n1.  **The Reaction:** `cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]` is reacted with the `dptt` ligand. This is a ligand substitution reaction. The `Ru-Cl` bonds are significantly weaker and more labile than the `Ru-N` bonds of the strongly chelating `bpy` ligands. Therefore, the `dptt` ligand will replace the two `Cl⁻` ligands.\n    *   `cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]` + `dptt` → `[Ru(bpy)₂(dptt)]²⁺` + 2`Cl⁻`\n\n2.  **Coordination Mode of `dptt` in the Product:**\n    *   The ruthenium center has a coordination number of 6.\n    *   The two `bpy` ligands are bidentate, occupying a total of 4 coordination sites.\n    *   This leaves only 2 coordination sites available for the incoming `dptt` ligand.\n    *   Therefore, `dptt` must act as a **bidentate** ligand.\n    *   **Careful Point:** How does `dptt` act as a bidentate ligand? The most stable chelate ring formed by such ligands involves one pyridyl nitrogen and the adjacent thiazole nitrogen. This forms a 5-membered chelate ring. Since the two pyridyl-thiazole units in `dptt` are equivalent, it doesn't matter which end of the ligand coordinates.\n\n3.  **Symmetry of the Coordinating `dptt` fragment:**\n    *   The two donor atoms are a pyridyl nitrogen (`Np`) and a thiazole nitrogen (`Nt`). These two nitrogen atoms are in different chemical environments.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This means that when `dptt` acts as a bidentate ligand, it is an **unsymmetrical** bidentate ligand.\n\n4.  **The Final Product:** The product is `[Ru(bpy)₂(dptt)]²⁺`, which is an octahedral complex of the general type `[M(AA)₂(BC)]`, where `M = Ru`, `AA = bpy` (symmetrical bidentate), and `BC = dptt` (unsymmetrical bidentate).\n\n### **Step 3: Enumerate the Isomers of `[Ru(bpy)₂(dptt)]²⁺`**\n\nWe need to find the total number of stereoisomers for a `cis-[M(AA)₂(BC)]` type complex. We can approach this in two ways, both leading to the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Consideration of the Chiral Reactant**\n\n1.  We start with a racemic mixture of `Δ-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]` and `Λ-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]`. Let's analyze the reaction for one enantiomer, for example, the `Δ` isomer.\n2.  The reaction proceeds with retention of the configuration of the `[Ru(bpy)₂]` core. So, we are substituting the two `Cl` ligands on the chiral `Δ-[Ru(bpy)₂]` scaffold.\n3.  The `Δ-[Ru(bpy)₂]` framework has C₂ rotational symmetry. The axis of symmetry passes through the ruthenium atom and bisects the angle between the two sites occupied by the chlorine atoms. This means the two coordination sites where substitution occurs are chemically equivalent.\n4.  The unsymmetrical ligand `BC` (our `dptt`) must occupy these two equivalent sites. It can do so in two different orientations:\n    *   **Orientation 1:** Atom `B` binds to site 1, and atom `C` binds to site 2.\n    *   **Orientation 2:** Atom `C` binds to site 1, and atom `B` binds to site 2.\n5.  Because the `[Ru(bpy)₂]` environment is chiral (it has no mirror plane), these two orientations result in two different molecules. They have the same `Δ` configuration of the `bpy` ligands but differ in the orientation of the `dptt` ligand. These two products are **diastereomers**.\n6.  So, starting from `Δ-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]` gives two diastereomeric products.\n7.  By the same logic, starting from the other enantiomer, `Λ-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂]`, will produce the corresponding enantiomers of the first two products.\n8.  Therefore, the reaction of the racemic starting material produces two pairs of enantiomers.\n    *   Pair 1: (Δ-product 1, Λ-product 1)\n    *   Pair 2: (Δ-product 2, Λ-product 2)\n9.  The total number of isomers formed is **4**.\n\n**Method 2: Direct Analysis of `[M(AA)₂(BC)]` isomers**\n\n1.  Let's determine the number of possible geometric isomers for a complex with three different bidentate ligands, one of which is unsymmetrical. For a `cis-[M(AA)₂(BC)]` complex, we need to consider the arrangement of the three chelate rings.\n2.  There are two distinct geometric arrangements possible for the three chelate rings relative to one another.\n3.  Now, we must check the chirality of each geometric isomer. For a complex containing three chelate rings like `[Ru(bpy)₂(dptt)]²⁺`, neither of the possible geometric arrangements can possess a plane of symmetry. This is due to the inherent \"twist\" or propeller-like nature of such complexes.\n4.  Since both geometric isomers are chiral, each will exist as a pair of enantiomers (Δ and Λ).\n5.  Total isomers = 2 (geometric isomers) × 2 (enantiomers per geometric isomer) = **4**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBoth analytical methods conclude that the reaction produces a total of four stereoisomers. These isomers exist as two pairs of enantiomers.\n\n<<<4>>>"
