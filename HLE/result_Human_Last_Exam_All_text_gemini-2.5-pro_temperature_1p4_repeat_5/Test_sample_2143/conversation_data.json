    "This is an analysis of the question to identify the historical figure mentioned.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **\"HIS work\"**: The subject is a male historical figure.\n2.  **\"Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: This points to a specific scholarly source. Veronika Campan is a known French historian and Assyriologist whose work focuses on the law and society of ancient Mesopotamia, particularly Babylon. Her primary subject of study is the Code of Hammurabi.\n3.  **\"separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\"**: This describes the content of the work. The work is a legal text or code that deals extensively with property rights, theft, debt, and other matters related to personal and material possessions. The Code of Hammurabi is one of the most comprehensive ancient legal codes and extensively covers these topics.\n4.  **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: The Code of Hammurabi is inscribed on a large stone stele. The text concludes with a detailed epilogue. In this epilogue, the king speaks in the first person, summarizing his achievements as a just ruler and calling upon the gods to curse any future ruler who might deface the monument or alter his laws. This section effectively serves to protect the established legal order, including the rights to material possessions he has codified.\n5.  **\"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: This is the most specific clue. Many ancient Near Eastern cultures, particularly those with Semitic roots, had tendencies towards aniconism (the avoidance of creating images of divine beings or, sometimes, humans). However, the famous Stele of Hammurabi features a large and prominent relief carving at its very top. This carving depicts a full-figure representation of King Hammurabi standing before the seated figure of Shamash, the Babylonian god of justice. Hammurabi is shown receiving the symbols of authority to make law from the god. This is a clear and deliberate use of figurative representation to legitimize his authority and the divine origin of his laws, thereby \"ignoring\" any prohibition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe individual described is the king of Babylon who commissioned the famous legal code inscribed on the stele that bears his image. Based on the scholarly reference (Veronika Campan) and the detailed description of the work (a law code dealing with property, with a pictorial representation at the top and an epilogue at the end), the person in question is the author of the Code of Hammurabi.\n\nHis full name is **Hammurabi**.\n\n<<<Hammurabi>>>"
