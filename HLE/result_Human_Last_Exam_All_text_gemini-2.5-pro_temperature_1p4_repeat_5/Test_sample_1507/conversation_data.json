    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Object: The Great Icosahedron**\n    *   The great icosahedron is one of the four non-convex regular polyhedra, also known as Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra.\n    *   It is composed of 20 self-intersecting equilateral triangular faces.\n    *   It has 12 vertices, which are arranged in the same spatial configuration as the vertices of a standard regular icosahedron.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core of the Question: The \"Outer-Hull\"**\n    *   The term \"outer-hull\" refers to the convex hull of the polyhedron.\n    *   The convex hull of a set of points (or a geometric object) is the smallest convex shape that contains all the points.\n    *   Since the vertices of the great icosahedron are identical to the vertices of a regular icosahedron, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n3.  **Identify the Surface to be Triangulated**\n    *   The question asks for the triangulation of the \"outer-hull\". Based on the previous step, this means we need to triangulate the surface of a regular icosahedron.\n    *   The phrase \"the number of visible triangles from the outside\" reinforces this, as these visible faces form the convex hull.\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimal Number of Triangles**\n    *   The task is to find the \"minimal number of triangles\" needed for this triangulation.\n    *   A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose surface is already composed entirely of triangles. Specifically, it has 20 identical equilateral triangle faces.\n    *   Since the faces of the surface are already triangles, the most efficient or \"minimal\" triangulation is simply the set of faces themselves. No further subdivision of the faces is necessary.\n    *   Therefore, the minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the surface of a regular icosahedron is equal to its number of faces.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Don't confuse the great icosahedron with its convex hull.** The great icosahedron itself has 20 faces that intersect each other internally. The question is specifically about its outer surface or convex hull.\n*   **The vertices are key.** The fact that the great icosahedron shares its vertices with the regular icosahedron is the crucial piece of information that defines its convex hull.\n*   **\"Minimal\" triangulation is important.** For a surface already made of triangles, the minimal triangulation is the trivial one, i.e., using the existing triangles without adding more vertices or edges.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has 20 triangular faces. The minimal triangulation of this surface uses these 20 faces. Therefore, the number of triangles is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
