    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of K.\n\n**1. Understand the Tensor and the Slice Rank**\n\n*   The space $V_1^{\\otimes n} = V_2^{\\otimes n} = V_3^{\\otimes n}$ is the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. Let's denote this space by $\\mathcal{F}_n$. The dimension of this space is $2^n$.\n*   The tensor $T$ is an element of $\\mathcal{F}_n \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_n \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_n$, defined by the function:\n    $T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$, where $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$.\n*   The **slice rank** of a tensor is the minimum number of \"slices\" (tensors of the form $u \\otimes M$, $v \\otimes N$, or $w \\otimes P$) needed to represent the tensor as their sum. We denote the slice rank of $T$ by $s(T)$.\n*   We are given that the slice rank of $T$ follows the asymptotic formula $s(T) = (3/2^{K})^n e^{o(n)}$. Our goal is to find the constant $K$. The term $e^{o(n)}$ represents sub-exponential factors, so the base of the exponential growth is $3/2^K$.\n\n**2. Decompose the Tensor**\n\nThe tensor $T$ can be decomposed into two parts:\n1.  Let $T_{prod}(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$.\n2.  Let $J(x, y, z) = 1$ for all $x, y, z$.\n\nSo, $T = T_{prod} - J$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of $T_{prod}$. It is a tensor power. Let $V = \\mathbb{C}^{\\{0,1\\}}$ be the space of functions from $\\{0,1\\}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. Then $T_{prod}$ is the $n$-th tensor power of the base tensor $T_1 \\in V \\otimes V \\otimes V$ defined by:\n$T_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$, where $x_1, y_1, z_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\nSo, $T_{prod} = T_1^{\\otimes n}$.\n\nNow let's analyze $J$. The all-ones tensor $J$ in $\\mathcal{F}_n \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_n \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_n$ can be written as a single outer product:\n$J = (\\sum_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n} \\delta_x) \\otimes (\\sum_{y \\in \\{0,1\\}^n} \\delta_y) \\otimes (\\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}^n} \\delta_z)$, where $\\delta_v$ is the indicator function of the vector $v$.\nA tensor that can be written as an outer product $u \\otimes v \\otimes w$ is called a rank-1 tensor. Any rank-1 tensor is a slice (e.g., $u \\otimes (v \\otimes w)$). Thus, the slice rank of $J$ is $s(J) = 1$.\n\n**3. Use Properties of Slice Rank**\n\nThe slice rank is subadditive, so $s(A+B) \\le s(A) + s(B)$.\nThis implies:\n$s(T_{prod}) = s(T+J) \\le s(T) + s(J) \\implies s(T_1^{\\otimes n}) \\le s(T) + 1$.\n$s(T) = s(T_{prod}-J) \\le s(T_{prod}) + s(J) \\implies s(T) \\le s(T_1^{\\otimes n}) + 1$.\nThese inequalities show that $s(T)$ and $s(T_1^{\\otimes n})$ have the same asymptotic behavior. Specifically, they have the same exponential growth rate.\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} s(T)^{1/n} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} s(T_1^{\\otimes n})^{1/n}$.\n\n**4. The Asymptotic Slice Rank**\n\nThe limit $R_a(T_1) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} s(T_1^{\\otimes n})^{1/n}$ is called the **asymptotic slice rank** of the tensor $T_1$.\nFrom the given information, we have:\n$R_a(T_1) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left((3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}\\right)^{1/n} = 3/2^K$.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to calculating the asymptotic slice rank of the base tensor $T_1$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Asymptotic Slice Rank**\n\nA key result in algebraic complexity theory relates the asymptotic slice rank $R_a(T)$ to the **subrank** $Q(T)$ of a tensor. For any tensor $T$, $R_a(T) = Q(T)$.\nThe subrank is defined as the maximum slice rank achievable by applying invertible linear transformations to the legs of the tensor:\n$Q(T_1) = \\max \\{ s((A \\otimes B \\otimes C) T_1) \\mid A, B, C \\in \\text{GL}(V) \\}$, where $\\text{GL}(V)$ is the group of invertible linear transformations on the space $V = \\mathbb{C}^2$.\n\nLet's analyze the space our tensor $T_1$ lives in: $V \\otimes V \\otimes V = \\mathbb{C}^2 \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^2 \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^2$.\nThere is a fundamental theorem stating that for any tensor $T' \\in \\mathbb{C}^{d_1} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d_2} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d_3}$, its slice rank is bounded by the minimum dimension, $s(T') \\le \\min(d_1, d_2, d_3)$.\nIn our case, $d_1=d_2=d_3=2$, so for any tensor $T' \\in \\mathbb{C}^2 \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^2 \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^2$, its slice rank $s(T')$ is at most 2.\n\nThis implies that for any choice of invertible matrices $A, B, C$, the transformed tensor $(A \\otimes B \\otimes C) T_1$ will have a slice rank of at most 2. Therefore, the subrank $Q(T_1)$ must be at most 2.\n$Q(T_1) = \\max s((A \\otimes B \\otimes C) T_1) \\le 2$.\n\nTo show that $Q(T_1)=2$, we need to find at least one set of transformations $A, B, C$ for which the slice rank is exactly 2.\nFirst, we need to show that $s(T_1)$ itself is not 1. A tensor has slice rank 1 if it can be written in the form $u \\otimes M$ (or similar for other slice types). This would mean that $T_1(x,y,z)$ can be written as $u(x)M(y,z)$. This implies that for any fixed $y,z$, the vector $(T_1(0,y,z), T_1(1,y,z))$ is always proportional to $(u(0), u(1))$.\nLet's check this for $T_1(x,y,z)=x+y+z$.\nFor $(y,z)=(0,0)$, the vector is $(0,1)$.\nFor $(y,z)=(0,1)$, the vector is $(1,2)$.\nThese vectors are not proportional. Thus, $T_1$ is not a type 1 slice. By symmetry, it is not a type 2 or type 3 slice either. So $s(T_1)>1$.\nThis means $s(T_1) \\ge 2$. Since we know the maximum possible slice rank is 2, it must be that $s(T_1)=2$.\n\nSince we have found an instance (the identity transformation $A=B=C=I$) for which the slice rank is 2, the maximum possible slice rank must be at least 2.\n$Q(T_1) \\ge s(T_1) = 2$.\n\nCombining the two inequalities, we get $Q(T_1) = 2$.\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we can find $K$. We have the equality:\n$R_a(T_1) = Q(T_1) = 2$.\nFrom step 4, we have:\n$R_a(T_1) = 3/2^K$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for $R_a(T_1)$:\n$3/2^K = 2$\n$3 = 2 \\cdot 2^K$\n$3 = 2^{K+1}$\nTaking the logarithm base 2 on both sides:\n$\\log_2(3) = K+1$\n$K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log_b(x) - \\log_b(y) = \\log_b(x/y)$:\n$K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The steps rely on standard, albeit advanced, results from algebraic complexity theory. The reasoning is consistent: relating the given formula to the asymptotic slice rank, identifying the asymptotic slice rank with the subrank, and then calculating the subrank for a $2\\times 2\\times 2$ tensor. The conclusion that $Q(T_1)=2$ is robust as any slice rank in this space cannot exceed 2, and we have demonstrated that the slice rank of $T_1$ is at least 2.\n\n>>>log_2(3/2)"
