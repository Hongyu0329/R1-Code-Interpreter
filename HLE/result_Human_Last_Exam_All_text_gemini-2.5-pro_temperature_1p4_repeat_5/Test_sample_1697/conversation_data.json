    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material:**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (`C=O`), which is in turn attached to a nitrogen atom.\n*   **N,N-diethyl:** Two ethyl groups (`-CH₂CH₃`) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide.\n*   **3-dimethylamino:** A dimethylamino group (`-N(CH₃)₂`) is attached to the 3-position of the benzene ring (meta to the amide group).\n\nThe structure is a benzene ring with two key functional groups: an amide (`-CONEt₂`) at position C1 and a tertiary amine (`-NMe₂`) at position C3.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Conditions:**\n*   **Reagent 1: `sec-BuLi` (sec-butyllithium) and `TMEDA` (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) in THF.**\n    *   `sec-BuLi` is a very strong organometallic base. Its primary function is to deprotonate the most acidic available proton.\n    *   `TMEDA` is a bidentate chelating ligand for lithium ions. It breaks up the aggregates of sec-BuLi and complexes with the lithium, increasing its basicity and reactivity. It is a crucial component in many directed metalation reactions.\n    *   `THF` (tetrahydrofuran) is a standard aprotic ether solvent for such reactions.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Methyl iodide (`CH₃I`).**\n    *   Methyl iodide is an electrophile. It serves as a source for an electrophilic methyl group (`CH₃⁺` equivalent) that can be attacked by a nucleophile.\n\n**3. Analyze the First Reaction Step: Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**\nThis is a classic example of a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) reaction. In this reaction, a functional group on an aromatic ring directs a strong base (like sec-BuLi) to deprotonate a C-H bond at a position ortho (adjacent) to it.\n\n*   **Identifying the Directing Groups (DMGs):** Both substituents on the ring are excellent Directed Metalation Groups.\n    *   The **N,N-diethylamide group (`-CONEt₂`)** is one of the most powerful DMGs. The carbonyl oxygen can chelate the lithium ion, directing the base to deprotonate the ortho positions (C2 and C6).\n    *   The **dimethylamino group (`-NMe₂`)** is also a very good DMG. The nitrogen's lone pair can chelate the lithium ion, directing the base to deprotonate its ortho positions (C2 and C4).\n\n*   **Determining the Site of Deprotonation:** We need to find the most acidic proton on the ring.\n    *   The proton at **C2** is ortho to *both* the amide group and the dimethylamino group.\n    *   The proton at **C4** is ortho to the dimethylamino group but para to the amide group.\n    *   The proton at **C6** is ortho to the amide group but para to the dimethylamino group.\n\n    Due to the **synergistic effect** of both groups directing to the same position, the proton at **C2** is by far the most acidic. The sec-BuLi will selectively abstract this proton. The resulting lithium cation is stabilized by forming a stable six-membered chelate ring with the carbonyl oxygen and the amine nitrogen. This forms an aryllithium intermediate where the C2 carbon bears a negative charge and is bonded to lithium.\n\n**4. Analyze the Second Reaction Step: Electrophilic Quench**\n*   The aryllithium species formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile (a carbanion at C2).\n*   When methyl iodide (`CH₃I`) is added, the nucleophilic C2 carbon attacks the electrophilic methyl group in an S_N2 reaction.\n*   This displaces the iodide ion (`I⁻`) and forms a new carbon-carbon bond between C2 of the ring and the methyl group.\n\n**5. Determine the Final Product:**\n*   The original N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide skeleton remains intact.\n*   A methyl group (`-CH₃`) is introduced at the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n*   The final compound is therefore **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** Recognize this as a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) followed by an electrophilic quench.\n*   **Role of DMGs:** Both the amide and amino groups are strong directing groups. The amide (`-CONEt₂`) is generally a stronger director than the amine (`-NMe₂`).\n*   **Synergistic Effect:** The key to this problem is noticing that the C2 position is ortho to both directing groups. This cooperative or synergistic effect makes the C2 proton exceptionally acidic and the sole site of lithiation.\n*   **Chelation:** The stability of the lithiated intermediate is greatly enhanced by the formation of a six-membered chelate ring involving the lithium atom, the carbonyl oxygen, and the amino nitrogen. This is a major driving force for the regioselectivity.\n*   **Reagent Roles:** Understand that `sec-BuLi` is the base, `TMEDA` enhances the base's reactivity and helps direct it, and `CH₃I` is the electrophile that adds the methyl group.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** The final position of the new substituent is determined entirely by the site of the initial deprotonation. In this case, it is unambiguously the C2 position.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. The reaction proceeds via a directed ortho-metalation where the amide and dimethylamino groups synergistically direct the deprotonation by sec-BuLi to the C2 position. The resulting aryllithium species is then alkylated by methyl iodide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
