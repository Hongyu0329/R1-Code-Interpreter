The most common reason a functional MRI coil shows no resonance when probed is that its **active detuning circuit** is engaged. For safety, coils are designed to be non-resonant by default when not in use. They only become resonant when the MRI scanner provides a specific DC voltage to switch them into "receive" mode. Without this activation signal, the coil is intentionally "detuned" and will not absorb energy at its operating frequency. Other contributing factors can include the lack of proper loading from an unpowered preamplifier, or incorrect placement and orientation of the probing loop leading to poor magnetic coupling.
