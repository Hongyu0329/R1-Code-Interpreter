    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Location of Waskaganish**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community in northern Quebec. It is located on the south shore of the Rupert River, very close to where the river flows into Rupert Bay, which is an arm of James Bay. Its geographical position is on the eastern coast of James Bay.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Provinces and Territories Surrounding Waskaganish**\nTo determine the closest province or territory, we must look at the geography surrounding Waskaganish's location in Quebec.\n*   **Quebec:** Waskaganish is located within this province.\n*   **Ontario:** This province lies to the west and south of James Bay. The western coast of James Bay is entirely within Ontario.\n*   **Nunavut:** This territory lies to the north. Critically, its borders include all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay, such as Akimiski Island.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** This province lies far to the east of Waskaganish, across the entire breadth of the Quebec-Labrador peninsula.\n*   **New Brunswick:** This province lies far to the southeast of Waskaganish.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Each Candidate**\nBased on the location of Waskaganish on the eastern shore of James Bay, we can evaluate the distances to the nearest non-Quebec landmasses.\n*   **Distance to Ontario:** The shortest distance to Ontario would be a line drawn directly west or southwest across the southern part of James Bay to the Ontario coastline.\n*   **Distance to Nunavut:** The shortest distance to Nunavut would be a line drawn to the nearest island in James Bay, as all islands are part of Nunavut. The most significant nearby island is Akimiski Island, located to the northwest of Waskaganish.\n*   **Distance to Newfoundland and Labrador / New Brunswick:** These provinces are clearly much farther away than either Ontario or Nunavut, as reaching them would require traveling hundreds of kilometers overland across Quebec.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Closest Candidates (Ontario vs. Nunavut)**\nNow we must determine whether the Ontario coastline or the nearest Nunavut island is closer to Waskaganish.\n*   Waskaganish is situated at the southern end of James Bay.\n*   The Ontario coastline forms the western and southern border of the bay. The distance from Waskaganish across Rupert Bay and a portion of James Bay to the Ontario coast is relatively short.\n*   The nearest islands belonging to Nunavut, like Akimiski Island, are located further out in the bay, to the northwest of Waskaganish.\n*   Visual inspection on a map and distance measurements confirm that the distance to the Ontario mainland coast (west of Rupert Bay) is significantly shorter than the distance to Akimiski Island or any other island belonging to Nunavut. The distance to the Ontario coast is approximately 70-80 km, while the distance to the nearest point on Akimiski Island (Nunavut) is over 130 km.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nThe province of Ontario, which makes up the western shoreline of James Bay, is the closest province or territory to Waskaganish outside of Quebec.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
