    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (also known as trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change in English where a long vowel or diphthong becomes a short vowel. This typically happens when the vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) of a word, often due to the addition of a suffix. A classic example is the change from *sane* /seɪn/ (long diphthong /eɪ/) to *sanity* /ˈsænəti/ (short vowel /æ/).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Word**\n\nWe will examine each word by looking at its base form (or a related word) to see if a long vowel was shortened.\n\n*   **southern**:\n    *   **Base Word**: *south* (pronounced /saʊθ/, with a long diphthong /aʊ/).\n    *   **Analyzed Word**: *southern* (pronounced /ˈsʌðərn/).\n    *   **Analysis**: The diphthong /aʊ/ in *south* changes to the short vowel /ʌ/ in *southern*. Although *southern* only has two syllables, this is a clear case of vowel shortening or laxing triggered by the suffix *-ern*. Therefore, it **has** undergone this process.\n\n*   **derivative**:\n    *   **Base Word**: *derive* (pronounced /dɪˈraɪv/, with a long diphthong /aɪ/).\n    *   **Analyzed Word**: *derivative* (pronounced /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/). The relevant syllable is \"-riv-\", which is the third from the end (an-te-pen-ul-ti-mate).\n    *   **Analysis**: The diphthong /aɪ/ in *derive* becomes the short vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative*. This is a perfect example of trisyllabic laxing. Therefore, it **has** undergone this process.\n\n*   **serenity**:\n    *   **Base Word**: *serene* (pronounced /səˈriːn/, with a long vowel /iː/).\n    *   **Analyzed Word**: *serenity* (pronounced /səˈrɛnəti/). The relevant syllable is \"-ren-\", which is the third from the end.\n    *   **Analysis**: The long vowel /iː/ in *serene* becomes the short vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity*. This is another clear example of trisyllabic laxing. Therefore, it **has** undergone this process.\n\n*   **pleasant**:\n    *   **Base Word**: *please* (pronounced /pliːz/, with a long vowel /iː/).\n    *   **Analyzed Word**: *pleasant* (pronounced /ˈplɛzənt/).\n    *   **Analysis**: The long vowel /iː/ in *please* changes to the short vowel /ɛ/ in *pleasant*. Like *southern*, this is vowel shortening in a two-syllable word, often called pre-cluster shortening, but it's the same fundamental process of laxing. Therefore, it **has** undergone this process.\n\n*   **gratitude**:\n    *   **Related Word**: *grateful* (pronounced /ˈɡreɪtfʊl/, with a long diphthong /eɪ/).\n    *   **Analyzed Word**: *gratitude* (pronounced /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/). The relevant syllable is \"grat-\", which is the third from the end.\n    *   **Analysis**: The long vowel sound /eɪ/ found in the related word *grateful* is a short vowel /æ/ in *gratitude*. This shortening follows the rule of trisyllabic laxing. Therefore, it **has** undergone this process.\n\n*   **shadow**:\n    *   **Etymology**: Comes from Old English *sceadu*. The vowel cluster *ea* in this word represented a short diphthong, which later developed into the modern short vowel /æ/.\n    *   **Analyzed Word**: *shadow* (pronounced /ˈʃædoʊ/).\n    *   **Analysis**: There is no related English base word with a long vowel from which *shadow* is derived via suffixation. The vowel in the first syllable of *shadow* has been historically short since its origins in Old English. Because the vowel was never long, it could not have been shortened or \"laxed\". Therefore, it **has not** undergone this process.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nAll words on the list except for *shadow* show evidence of a historically long vowel or diphthong being shortened due to suffixation or word formation. The vowel in *shadow* was already short in its Old English ancestor, so it did not undergo shortening.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
