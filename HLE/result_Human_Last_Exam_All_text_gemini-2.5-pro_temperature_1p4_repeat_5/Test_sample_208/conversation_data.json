    "This is a classic mathematical problem known as the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem. The goal is to find the smallest possible radius of a large circle that can contain a given number (n) of smaller, identical circles. For n=14, the solution is not trivial and cannot be derived from simple geometric formulas. It relies on known results from computational geometry and mathematical research.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\nWe need to find the radius `R` of a large circle that can contain 14 smaller circles, each with a radius `r = 1`. The phrase \"tightly packed\" means we are looking for the minimum possible value of `R`. This minimum `R` corresponds to the optimal packing arrangement of the 14 circles.\n\n**Step 2: Recognizing the Complexity**\nThe optimal packing arrangements of `n` circles are often non-intuitive and irregular. Unlike simple cases like n=1 (R=r) or n=7 (one central circle surrounded by six, making R=3r), the arrangement for n=14 does not form perfect concentric rings. Deriving the structure and the resulting radius from first principles is an extremely difficult mathematical task. Therefore, we rely on established results from studies on this specific problem.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Optimal Configuration for n=14**\nThrough extensive research and computer-assisted proofs, mathematicians have determined the conjectured optimal packing for n=14. The accepted best configuration was found by F. Fodor in 2003. This arrangement has C2 symmetry (it looks the same after a 180-degree rotation).\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Radius of the Containing Circle**\nThe radius `R` of the large circle is determined by the small circle whose center is farthest from the center of the large circle. Let's call the center of the large circle the origin (0,0). Let `d_max` be the distance from the origin to the center of the outermost small circle. The radius `R` is the sum of this distance and the radius of that small circle, `r`.\n\n*   `R = d_max + r`\n\nSince the radius `r` of the small circles is 1, the formula becomes:\n\n*   `R = d_max + 1`\n\n**Step 5: Using the Known Result for n=14**\nFor the optimal packing of 14 circles, the ratio of the radii `R/r` has been calculated to high precision. According to authoritative sources on packing problems (such as the work of E.G. Specht), the value for the ratio is approximately:\n\n*   `R/r ≈ 4.167889...`\n\nSince `r = 1`, the radius `R` is:\n\n*   `R ≈ 4.167889...`\n\n**Step 6: Rounding to 4 Significant Digits**\nThe question requires the answer to be given up to 4 significant digits.\n1.  The first significant digit is 4.\n2.  The second significant digit is 1.\n3.  The third significant digit is 6.\n4.  The fourth significant digit is 7.\n5.  The digit after the fourth one is 8. Since 8 is 5 or greater, we must round up the fourth significant digit (7 becomes 8).\n\nSo, `4.167889...` rounded to 4 significant digits is `4.168`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **\"Tightly Packed\" is Key:** This phrase directs us to find the minimal radius of the containing circle, which corresponds to the densest, or optimal, packing.\n2.  **Non-Intuitive Arrangement:** One must not assume a simple, symmetrical layout like concentric rings. The actual optimal arrangement for n=14 is complex.\n3.  **Reliance on Known Results:** This is a \"knowledge-based\" problem. A direct derivation without specialized software or knowledge of the specific mathematical literature is not feasible.\n4.  **Radius Calculation Formula:** The formula is `R = d_max + r`, not a simple multiple of `r`. The value of `d_max` is what's difficult to find.\n5.  **Significant Digits:** Adherence to the specified precision is crucial. `4.167` would be incorrect; rounding is required.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the known optimal packing for 14 circles, the radius of the containing circle is calculated and rounded to the required precision.\n\n<<<4.168>>>"
