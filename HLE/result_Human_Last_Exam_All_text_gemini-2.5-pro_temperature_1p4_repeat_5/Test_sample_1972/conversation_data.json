    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question provides two key clues from Jorge Luis Borges to identify a novel and its author:\n    *   **A direct quote about the novel:** It possesses \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   **A description of the author:** He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Clue (The Quote):**\n    *   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This metaphor suggests a work that is powerful, visceral, fierce, and relentless in its narrative drive. It points to high stakes, tension, and possibly violence or raw emotion.\n    *   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This metaphor suggests a highly intelligent and complex structure. A chess game has a finite set of rules and pieces, yet it produces an immense number of strategic possibilities. This implies the novel has a meticulously planned, intricate plot with interwoven storylines, strategies, and counter-strategies, where every element is crucial to the whole.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Clue (The Author's Description):**\n    *   **\"A continuator...of Faulkner\":** This means the author follows in the literary tradition of the American novelist William Faulkner. Faulkner is famous for his complex narrative techniques, including non-linear timelines, multiple and often unreliable narrators, stream of consciousness, and a deep exploration of history and memory.\n    *   **\"(and simplifier)\":** This is a crucial qualifier. It suggests that while the author uses Faulkner's complex methods, he makes them more accessible or organized. The structure, while intricate, might be more clearly delineated than in Faulkner's most difficult works (like *The Sound and the Fury* or *Absalom, Absalom!*).\n\n4.  **Connecting the Clues and Identifying the Subject:**\n    *   We are looking for a novelist who was praised by Borges and whose work fits both descriptions. Given Borges's context, the author is likely a fellow Latin American from the \"Boom\" generation, as many of them were deeply influenced by Faulkner.\n    *   A search for the quote \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" reveals that Jorge Luis Borges wrote this as a piece of praise for **Mario Vargas Llosa's** debut novel, **_La ciudad y los perros_** (1963).\n    *   This novel is known in its English translation as **_The Time of the Hero_**.\n    *   Now, we must check if the second clue also fits. Mario Vargas Llosa is famously and explicitly a \"continuator of Faulkner.\" He has spoken and written at length about Faulkner's profound influence on his own work. The structure of *The Time of the Hero* is a prime example: it shifts between different time periods and multiple points of view (including those of \"The Jaguar,\" \"The Slave,\" \"The Poet,\" and a collective narrative voice for the cadets) to build a complex, multi-layered story.\n    *   The \"simplifier\" label also fits. While the novel's structure is intricate and challenging, its narrative threads are more distinct and its prose less syntactically convoluted than Faulkner's, making the complex structure ultimately decipherable for the reader, much like following the different interlocking lines of a \"chess duel.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth clues point definitively to the same novel and author. The quote is directly attributed to Borges in reference to the book, and the stylistic description is a perfect critical assessment of the author's early work.\n\nThe novel is **_The Time of the Hero_** (_La ciudad y los perros_) by **Mario Vargas Llosa**.\n\n<<<The Time of the Hero (original title: La ciudad y los perros) by Mario Vargas Llosa.>>>"
