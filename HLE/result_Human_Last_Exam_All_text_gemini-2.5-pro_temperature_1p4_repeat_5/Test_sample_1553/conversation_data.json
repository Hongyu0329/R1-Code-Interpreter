    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of the character that the protagonist of Jacek Dukaj's novel, \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection), marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe protagonist and main character of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a human from the 21st century who has been resurrected in the distant future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the plot to find the main character's spouse.**\nThe plot follows Adam Zamoyski's journey as he adapts to a far-future, post-human civilization. A central figure in his new existence is a powerful post-human entity who acts as his guardian, mentor, and protector.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific character who becomes the spouse.**\nThis post-human entity is named Angelica.

It's important to trace its development to the eventual marriage.\n*   **The Nature of \"Marriage\":** In the context of the far-future, post-human world of the novel, \"marriage\" is a formal union but may differ from the 21st-century concept. However, it is explicitly referred to as such.\n*   **Final Plot Point:** The marriage is a significant event that occurs towards the end of the novel, solidifying their alliance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the plot and characters of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries the post-human entity named Angelica.\n\n<<<Angelica>>>"
