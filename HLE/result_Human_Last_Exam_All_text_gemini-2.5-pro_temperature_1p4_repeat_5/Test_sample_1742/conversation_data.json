    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice module for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules\nThe algebra $A$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a hereditary algebra of type $A_3$, which is representation-finite.\n\nThe indecomposable $A$-modules can be denoted by $M_{ij}$, representing a module with support on vertices $i, i+1, \\dots, j$ and identity maps for the arrows. There are $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\frac{3(4)}{2} = 6$ indecomposable modules:\n1.  $S_1 = M_{11}$: The simple module at vertex 1. Representation: $\\mathbb{C} \\to 0 \\to 0$. This is also the injective module $I_1$.\n2.  $S_2 = M_{22}$: The simple module at vertex 2. Representation: $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$.\n3.  $S_3 = M_{33}$: The simple module at vertex 3. Representation: $0 \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{C}$. This is also the projective module $P_3$.\n4.  $M_{12}$: Representation $\\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$. This is the injective module $I_2$.\n5.  $M_{23}$: Representation $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C}$. This is the projective module $P_2$.\n6.  $M_{13}$: Representation $\\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C}$. This is the projective module $P_1$ and also the injective module $I_3$.\n\nThe indecomposable modules are:\n*   Projective: $P_1=M_{13}$, $P_2=M_{23}$, $P_3=S_3$.\n*   Injective: $I_1=S_1$, $I_2=M_{12}$, $I_3=M_{13}$.\n*   Projective and Injective: $P_1 = I_3 = M_{13}$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting modules and Slice modules\nFor a hereditary algebra like $A$, the theory simplifies.\n*   **Support $\\tau$-tilting module**: A module $M$ is support $\\tau$-tilting if and only if $\\text{Ext}^1_A(M,M)=0$. These are also called Ext-exceptional modules.\n*   **$\\tau$-tilting module**: A support $\\tau$-tilting module $M$ is a $\\tau$-tilting module if it is faithful (i.e., its annihilator $Ann(M)$ is zero) and it has $|A|=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable direct summands.\n*   **Tilting module**: A module $T$ is a (classical) tilting module if it satisfies $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T)=0$, its projective dimension is at most 1 (always true for a hereditary algebra), and it has 3 non-isomorphic indecomposable summands.\n*   For hereditary algebras, the concepts of \"$\\tau$-tilting module\" and \"tilting module\" are often used interchangeably, but there can be a subtle difference. A known result states that for path algebras of type $A_n$, there is exactly one $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a tilting module.\n*   **Slice module**: A slice module is a tilting module whose indecomposable summands form a complete slice in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver. For a hereditary algebra, a key property of a slice module is that it must contain any indecomposable module that is both projective and injective as a direct summand.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the unique Projective-Injective Module\nFor the algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, we list the indecomposable modules that are both projective and injective. From Step 1, we see that there is only one such module:\n*   $M_{13} = P_1 = I_3$.\n\nThis means any slice module for $A$ must have $P_1$ as one of its direct summands. The question asks for the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is *not* a slice. We can therefore rephrase the problem as finding the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that does *not* have $P_1$ as a direct summand.\n\n### Step 4: List all $\\tau$-tilting modules for A\nThe $\\tau$-tilting modules for path algebras of type $A_n$ are well-known. For $A_3$, there are 5 such modules ($C_3=5$, the third Catalan number). Let's list them:\n1.  $T_1 = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3 = M_{13} \\oplus M_{23} \\oplus S_3$. This is the standard projective tilting module.\n2.  $T_2 = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2 = M_{13} \\oplus M_{23} \\oplus S_2$.\n3.  $T_3 = P_1 \\oplus M_{12} \\oplus S_2$.\n4.  $T_4 = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3 = S_1 \\oplus M_{12} \\oplus M_{13} = S_1 \\oplus M_{12} \\oplus P_1$. This is the standard injective tilting module.\n5.  $T_5 = P_2 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_2 = M_{23} \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_2$.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the non-slice module\nNow we check which of these 5 modules does not contain $P_1=M_{13}$ as a summand.\n1.  $T_1$: Contains $P_1$. It is a slice module (the projective slice).\n2.  $T_2$: Contains $P_1$. It is a slice module.\n3.  $T_3$: Contains $P_1$. It is a slice module.\n4.  $T_4$: Contains $P_1$. It is a slice module (the injective slice).\n5.  $T_5$: Does **not** contain $P_1$. Its summands are $P_2=M_{23}$, $S_1$, and $S_2$.\n\nTherefore, the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice is $T_5 = P_2 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_2$. This module is also the unique $\\tau$-tilting module for $A_3$ which is not a classical tilting module, as $\\text{Ext}^1(S_1, S_2) \\ne 0$.\n\nThe final answer is the module $P_2 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_2$, which is also written as $M_{23} \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_2$.\n\n<<<P_2 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_2>>>"
