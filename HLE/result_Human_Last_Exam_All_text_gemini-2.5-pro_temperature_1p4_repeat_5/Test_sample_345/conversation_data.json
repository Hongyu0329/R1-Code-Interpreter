    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** The core components of the query are:\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\"\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Year of Creation:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Action:** Acquired\n    *   **Year of Acquisition:** 1967\n    *   **The unknown:** The acquiring museum.\n\n2.  **Initial Research:** The first step is to search for the painting \"The Radionist\" (in German, \"Der Radionist\") by Kurt Günther. This is a well-known work from the German New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) art movement.\n\n3.  **Identify Current Location:** Research quickly establishes that the painting is located in Dresden, Germany. It is part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections).\n\n4.  **Specify the Collection:** Within the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, the painting belongs to the Galerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery). This gallery is housed in the Albertinum building.\n\n5.  **Verify the Acquisition Date:** The final and most crucial step is to confirm the acquisition date. By checking the official collection database of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, we can find the provenance details for the painting (inventory number Gal.-Nr. 3474). The official record states \"Erworben 1967 von Rudolf Günther, Gera,\" which translates to \"Acquired in 1967 from Rudolf Günther, Gera.\"\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Answer:** All the pieces of information align. The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was indeed acquired in 1967. The acquiring institution was the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden for its Galerie Neue Meister collection.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Name Specificity:** The museum has several names that could be considered correct. \"Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden\" is the official name of the parent institution. \"Galerie Neue Meister\" is the specific collection that holds the painting. \"Albertinum\" is the name of the building where the Galerie Neue Meister is located. For maximum accuracy, the parent institution is the best answer.\n*   **Language:** The painting's original title is in German (\"Der Radionist\"). Searching with the German title can sometimes yield more precise results from German museum databases.\n*   **Verification:** It is important to verify the acquisition date from a reliable source, such as the museum's own public records, rather than relying on secondary sources which might not mention this specific detail.\n\n<<<Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections)>>>"
