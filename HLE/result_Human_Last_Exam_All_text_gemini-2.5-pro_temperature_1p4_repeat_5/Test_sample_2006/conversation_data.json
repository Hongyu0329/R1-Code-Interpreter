    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question's Framework\nThe problem asks us to solve a riddle. The structure is key:\n*   **The Title as a Question:** The prompt explicitly states, \"The title is a question.\" The title is \"The Bays\".\n*   **The Haiku as Clues:** The three lines of the haiku each contain a clue to a part of the answer.\n*   **The Final Answer Format:** The final answer should be a list of words, sorted in alphabetical order.\n\n### Careful Points for Initial Analysis:\n*   **The Title:** \"The Bays\" is a homophone. It sounds identical to \"The B's\". Therefore, the question being asked is, \"What are the B's?\".\n*   **The Haiku's Role:** Each of the three lines of the haiku must be decoded to find a specific word that begins with the letter 'B'.\n*   **Nature of Clues:** The clues are metaphorical and require general knowledge, particularly of history.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Decode Each Clue Line by Line\n\n**Clue 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n\n*   **Analysis:** We are looking for a 'B' word that can be described as a \"tempest\" (a violent storm or upheaval) that occurred in August.\n*   **Interpretation:** This points to a significant historical battle. The Battle of **Blenheim** was a major turning point in the War of the Spanish Succession. It was a decisive and chaotic (\"tempestuous\") battle fought on August 13, 1704.\n*   **Answer from Line 1:** Blenheim\n\n**Clue 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n\n*   **Analysis:** We need to break down this line into its components.\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is a simple calculation: 2 x 15 = 30.\n    *   \"brings winds of change\" refers to a major revolution or shift in power.\n*   **Interpretation:** The number 30 most likely refers to a year. The year 1830 saw the July Revolution in France. This revolution was a significant \"wind of change\" that led to the abdication of King Charles X, the last king of the House of **Bourbon**. The B-word is the name of the dynasty that was overthrown by this event.\n*   **Answer from Line 2:** Bourbon\n\n**Clue 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n\n*   **Analysis:** We are looking for something considered \"divine\" that \"yielded\" (surrendered, fell, or gave way).\n*   **Interpretation:** The \"divine one\" refers to an empire whose ruler and state religion gave it a sacred or holy status. The Byzantine Empire, the successor to the Roman Empire and the seat of Orthodox Christianity, fits this description perfectly. It \"yielded\" when its capital, Constantinople, fell to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. The 'B' word is **Byzantium**.\n*   **Answer from Line 3:** Byzantium\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Assemble and Order the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Gather the discovered 'B' words:**\n    *   Blenheim\n    *   Bourbon\n    *   Byzantium\n\n2.  **Fulfill the final instruction:** \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\" We must sort these words alphabetically.\n    *   **Ble**nheim\n    *   **Bou**rbon\n    *   **Byz**antium\n\nThe alphabetical order is indeed Blenheim, Bourbon, Byzantium.\n\n<<<Blenheim, Bourbon, Byzantium>>>"
