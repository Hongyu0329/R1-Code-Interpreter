    "This problem asks for the maximum number of composants in the product of two nondegenerate continua. To solve this, we need to understand the key topological concepts involved and how they interact.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core definitions.**\n\n1.  **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[0,1]`, a circle `S¹`, or a closed disk `D²`.\n2.  **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n3.  **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` is the set of all points `x` in `X` for which there exists a **proper subcontinuum** of `X` containing both `p` and `x`. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not the entire space `X`. Being in the same composant is an equivalence relation, and the composants of `X` are the equivalence classes under this relation. They form a partition of `X`.\n4.  **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continua:**\n    *   A continuum `X` is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua.\n    *   A continuum `X` is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the number of composants to decomposability.**\n\nThis relationship is a cornerstone of continuum theory.\n\n*   If a continuum `X` is **decomposable**, it has exactly **one** composant, which is `X` itself.\n    *   *Reasoning:* If `X = A ∪ B` where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua, one can show that any two points in `X` lie in the same composant. `A` connects all its points, `B` connects all its points, and since `X` is connected, `A` and `B` must intersect. This intersection allows one to bridge any point in `A` to any point in `B` through a chain of proper subcontinua, making the entire space a single composant.\n*   If a continuum `X` is **indecomposable**, it has more than one composant. A fundamental theorem states that any indecomposable metric continuum has **c** (the cardinality of the continuum, `2^ℵ₀`) pairwise disjoint composants. Each composant is also a dense subset of `X`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the product space `X × Y`.**\n\nWe are interested in the number of composants of the product space `X × Y`, where `X` and `Y` are two nondegenerate continua. To maximize this number, we should aim for `X × Y` to be indecomposable.\n\n*   A crucial theorem states: The product `X × Y` of two continua is **indecomposable if and only if both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable**.\n*   Conversely, if either `X` or `Y` (or both) is decomposable, then the product `X × Y` is decomposable. If `X` is decomposable (i.e., `X = A ∪ B`), then `X × Y = (A × Y) ∪ (B × Y)`. Since `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X`, `A × Y` and `B × Y` are proper subcontinua of `X × Y`, making `X × Y` decomposable.\n*   Therefore, to get more than one composant in the product, we *must* choose both `X` and `Y` to be indecomposable continua.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the composants of the product space.**\n\nNow, let's assume `X` and `Y` are both indecomposable continua. We need to find the number of composants of the indecomposable continuum `Z = X × Y`.\n\n*   There is a theorem that precisely describes the composants of a product space: A subset `K` of `X × Y` is a composant of `X × Y` if and only if `K` is of the form `K_X × K_Y`, where `K_X` is a composant of `X` and `K_Y` is a composant of `Y`.\n*   This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of composants of `X × Y` and the Cartesian product of the sets of composants of `X` and `Y`.\n*   Let `n(S)` denote the number of composants of a space `S`. This theorem implies: `n(X × Y) = n(X) × n(Y)`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the largest possible number.**\n\nTo find the largest possible value for `n(X × Y)`, we need to maximize `n(X)` and `n(Y)`.\n\n1.  From Step 2, we know the number of composants is 1 for a decomposable continuum and `c` for an indecomposable continuum.\n2.  To maximize `n(X)`, we must choose `X` to be an indecomposable continuum. An example is the **Knaster bucket-handle continuum**. For such an `X`, the number of composants is `n(X) = c`.\n3.  Similarly, to maximize `n(Y)`, we choose `Y` to be another indecomposable continuum (it can be the same one). For this `Y`, the number of composants is `n(Y) = c`.\n4.  Using the formula from Step 4, the number of composants of the product is `n(X × Y) = n(X) × n(Y) = c × c`.\n5.  By the laws of cardinal arithmetic, for any infinite cardinal number `κ`, we have `κ × κ = κ`. Since `c` is the cardinality of the real numbers (`2^ℵ₀`), it is an infinite cardinal.\n6.  Therefore, `c × c = c`.\n\nThe largest possible number of composants is `c`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Definition of Composant:** It relies on the existence of a *proper* subcontinuum. This is key.\n2.  **Number of Composants:** The stark difference between decomposable (1 composant) and indecomposable (`c` composants) continua is the central fact.\n3.  **Decomposability of Products:** The product `X × Y` is indecomposable *if and only if* both factors are. This forces us to choose indecomposable continua to maximize the number of composants.\n4.  **Composants of Products:** The composants of the product `X × Y` are precisely the products of the composants of `X` and `Y`. This provides the multiplicative formula `n(X × Y) = n(X) × n(Y)`.\n5.  **Cardinal Arithmetic:** The final step requires knowing that `c × c = c`.\n\nBy selecting two indecomposable continua `X` and `Y`, each of which has `c` composants, their product `X × Y` will be an indecomposable continuum with `c × c = c` composants. This is the maximum possible number.\n\nFinal Answer: The largest possible number of composants is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
