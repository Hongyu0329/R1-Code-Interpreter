    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pieces required to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Representation of Numbers in Red-Blue Hackenbush\n\nIn Combinatorial Game Theory, values of Red-Blue Hackenbush positions can be represented by numbers. Specifically, positive dyadic rationals (numbers of the form $\\frac{m}{2^k}$ where $m$ and $k$ are positive integers) have a canonical, finite representation. For fractional values, this representation typically takes the form of a single \"stalk\" of red and blue edges attached to the ground.\n\nThe value of a stalk is determined by the colors of its edges, calculated from the top down.\n*   A single red edge has a value of 1.\n*   Placing a red edge *under* a stalk with value $G$ creates a new stalk with value $1 + G$.\n*   Placing a blue edge *under* a stalk with value $G > 0$ creates a new stalk with value $\\frac{G}{2}$.\n\n### Step 2: The Construction Algorithm\n\nWe can construct the stalk for a given number $x$ by determining the required edges from the ground up. This is achieved by working backwards from our target value $x$.\n\nLet the value we want to represent be $y$. We start with $y = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n1.  **Current value to represent: $y_0 = \\frac{13}{16}$**\n    Since $0 < y_0 < 1$, the bottom-most edge of the stalk (the one connected to the ground) must be **blue**. A blue edge at the bottom halves the value of the structure above it. Therefore, the structure sitting on top of this blue edge must have the value $y_1 = 2 \\times y_0 = 2 \\times \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{13}{8}$.\n    *(Pieces so far: 1 Blue)*\n\n2.  **Current value to represent: $y_1 = \\frac{13}{8}$**\n    Since $y_1 > 1$, we can write it as $y_1 = 1 + \\frac{5}{8}$. The '1' is represented by placing a **red** edge. The structure sitting on this red edge must have the value $y_2 = y_1 - 1 = \\frac{5}{8}$.\n    *(Pieces so far: 1 Blue, 1 Red)*\n\n3.  **Current value to represent: $y_2 = \\frac{5}{8}$**\n    Since $0 < y_2 < 1$, the next edge up must be **blue**. The structure above it must have the value $y_3 = 2 \\times y_2 = 2 \\times \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{5}{4}$.\n    *(Pieces so far: 2 Blue, 1 Red)*\n\n4.  **Current value to represent: $y_3 = \\frac{5}{4}$**\n    Since $y_3 > 1$, we write it as $y_3 = 1 + \\frac{1}{4}$. This is represented by a **red** edge. The structure above it must have the value $y_4 = y_3 - 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    *(Pieces so far: 2 Blue, 2 Red)*\n\n5.  **Current value to represent: $y_4 = \\frac{1}{4}$**\n    Since $0 < y_4 < 1$, the next edge must be **blue**. The structure above must have the value $y_5 = 2 \\times y_4 = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    *(Pieces so far: 3 Blue, 2 Red)*\n\n6.  **Current value to represent: $y_5 = \\frac{1}{2}$**\n    Since $0 < y_5 < 1$, the next edge must be **blue**. The structure above must have the value $y_6 = 2 \\times y_5 = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1$.\n    *(Pieces so far: 4 Blue, 2 Red)*\n\n7.  **Current value to represent: $y_6 = 1$**\n    The value 1 is represented by a single **red** edge. This is the top-most piece of the stalk, and the construction is complete.\n    *(Final pieces: 4 Blue, 3 Red)*\n\n### Step 3: Count the Pieces\n\nBy following the construction algorithm, we have determined the color of each edge in the stalk from the ground up.\n*   We have 4 blue edges.\n*   We have 3 red edges.\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is the sum of the red and blue pieces.\nTotal pieces = 4 (blue) + 3 (red) = 7.\n\n### Alternative Method (Shortcut)\n\nThere is a well-known theorem for the number of pieces in the canonical representation of a simplified dyadic rational $x = \\frac{m}{2^k}$ (where m is an odd integer).\n\n*   The number of **blue pieces** is equal to $k$.\n*   The number of **red pieces** is equal to the number of '1's in the binary representation of the numerator, $m$.\n\nLet's apply this to $x = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n1.  **Identify m and k:**\n    The fraction is $x = \\frac{13}{2^4}$. It is in simplest form, so we have $m=13$ and $k=4$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of blue pieces:**\n    Number of blue pieces = $k = 4$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of red pieces:**\n    We need the binary representation of $m=13$.\n    $13 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 1 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0$.\n    So, $13_{10} = 1101_2$.\n    The number of '1's in $1101_2$ is 3.\n    Number of red pieces = 3.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total number of pieces:**\n    Total pieces = (Number of blue pieces) + (Number of red pieces) = 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Simplest Form:** The number must be in its simplest form. Since 13 is a prime number, $\\frac{13}{16}$ is already in simplest form.\n*   **Canonical Representation:** The question implies finding the number of pieces in the canonical (standard and most efficient) representation, which for dyadic rationals is a single stalk.\n*   **Positive Value:** The rules described apply to positive numbers. Negative numbers would involve stalks with a net negative value.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the total number of pieces needed is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
