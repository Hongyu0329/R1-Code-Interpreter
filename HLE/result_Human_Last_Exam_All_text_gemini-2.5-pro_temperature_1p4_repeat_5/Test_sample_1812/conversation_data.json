    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix, denoted by A. The question provides context by referring to it as \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\nThe matrix is given as:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe information about the Markov quiver and the Markov number \\(m_{1/2} = 13\\) serves to identify the specific matrix in a mathematical context. However, for the computation itself, we only need the explicit form of the matrix A. The problem boils down to a direct calculation of a determinant.\n\n**2. List Careful Points**\n\n*   **Focus on the core task:** The main task is to compute \\(\\det(A)\\). The contextual information is not needed for the calculation itself.\n*   **Matrix properties:** Before jumping into calculation, it's often useful to inspect the matrix for any special properties that might simplify the work.\n*   **Choice of method:** For a 3x3 matrix, several methods can be used: the Sarrus' rule, cofactor expansion, or row/column operations.\n*   **Arithmetic precision:** The calculation involves several negative numbers. It is crucial to be careful with the signs at each step.\n*   **Verification:** Whenever possible, use an alternative method to verify the result.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer**\n\nWe will compute the determinant using three different methods to ensure the accuracy of the result.\n\n**Method 1: Using Row Operations (and Linear Dependence)**\n\nA key property of determinants is that if the rows or columns of a matrix are linearly dependent, the determinant is zero. Let's examine the rows (R1, R2, R3) and columns (C1, C2, C3) of matrix A.\n\n*   **Column Sum:**\n    Let's add the three columns of the matrix:\n    \\[ C_1 + C_2 + C_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 - 1 - 1 \\\\ -1 + 2 - 1 \\\\ -1 - 1 + 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    Since the sum of the three column vectors is the zero vector, the columns are linearly dependent. Therefore, the determinant of the matrix is 0.\n\n*   **Row Sum (Alternative):**\n    Similarly, we can add the three rows:\n    \\[ R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = [2, -1, -1] + [-1, 2, -1] + [-1, -1, 2] = [2-1-1, -1+2-1, -1-1+2] = [0, 0, 0] \\]\n    Since performing the row operation \\(R_1 \\to R_1 + R_2 + R_3\\) results in a row of zeros, the determinant of the matrix is 0.\n\nThis is the most efficient method and gives the answer directly.\n\n**Method 2: Cofactor Expansion**\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be calculated by expanding along the first row:\n\\(\\det(A) = a_{11} C_{11} + a_{12} C_{12} + a_{13} C_{13}\\)\nwhere \\(C_{ij}\\) is the cofactor of the element \\(a_{ij}\\).\n\n\\(\\det(A) = 2 \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix}\\)\n\nLet's calculate the 2x2 determinants:\n*   \\(\\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3\\)\n*   \\(\\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3\\)\n*   \\(\\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3\\)\n\nNow, substitute these back into the expansion formula:\n\\(\\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3)\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = 0\\)\n\nThis method confirms the result from Method 1.\n\n**Method 3: Sarrus' Rule**\n\nFor this rule, we write down the matrix and repeat the first two columns to its right.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccc|cc}\n2 & -1 & -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 & -1 & 2 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2 & -1 & -1\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n1.  Sum the products of the diagonals going from top-left to bottom-right:\n    \\(S_1 = (2)(2)(2) + (-1)(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(-1)\\)\n    \\(S_1 = 8 + (-1) + (-1) = 8 - 2 = 6\\)\n\n2.  Sum the products of the diagonals going from bottom-left to top-right:\n    \\(S_2 = (-1)(2)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(2) + (2)(-1)(-1)\\)\n    \\(S_2 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\)\n\n3.  The determinant is the difference \\(S_1 - S_2\\):\n    \\(\\det(A) = S_1 - S_2 = 6 - 6 = 0\\)\n\nAll three methods yield the same result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe determinant of the given adjacency matrix is 0. This is because the rows (and columns) of the matrix are linearly dependent, a property that immediately implies a zero determinant.\n\n<<<0>>>"
