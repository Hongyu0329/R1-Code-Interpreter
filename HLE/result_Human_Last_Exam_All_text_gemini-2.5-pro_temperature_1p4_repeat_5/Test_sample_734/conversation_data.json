    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\nThe core of the question asks for a specific Christian theologian who meets several criteria:\n*   **Who:** A named individual from Christian history.\n*   **What:** Developed \"specialized terminology.\" This implies a unique set of concepts or words, not just a general discussion.\n*   **For what purpose:** To describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\"\n*   **Applicable to two specific cases:**\n    1.  The virgin birth of Jesus (a singular, miraculous event that suspends a known natural law).\n    2.  Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall (a systemic, ongoing change to the entire natural order).\n*   **\"First\":** The question implies we are looking for the originator of this line of thought within Christian theology.\n\n**2. Identifying Potential Candidates**\n\nMajor theologians who dealt with creation, miracles, and natural law include Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, and others. We must evaluate them against the specific criteria.\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** Aquinas had a highly developed theology of miracles, classifying them as events *supra naturam* (above nature), *contra naturam* (against nature), or *praeter naturam* (outside the course of nature). However, his framework explains miracles primarily as God acting *outside* the established natural order, rather than providing terminology for how the laws *within* that order might themselves be changed or have latent potentials.\n*   **The Reformers (16th Century):** Figures like John Calvin emphasized God's absolute sovereignty and direct providential action. For Calvin, a miracle is a direct act of God's will. While he discussed the effects of the Fall on creation, he did not typically invent a new philosophical or metaphysical vocabulary to categorize different types of changes to natural law.\n\n**3. Focusing on Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD)**\n\nAugustine is the strongest candidate, particularly because he was an early theologian who developed a sophisticated philosophical framework to address these exact issues.\n\n*   **Specialized Terminology:** Augustine's key concept is that of ***rationes seminales*** (Latin for \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal seeds\"). He adapted this idea from Stoic philosophy for his Christian theology of creation.\n\n*   **Explanation of the Terminology:** Augustine argued that at the moment of creation, God embedded into matter the latent potentials for everything that would ever come into being, both ordinary and extraordinary. These \"seminal reasons\" are like blueprints or seeds that unfold over time according to God's providence.\n\n**4. Applying Augustine's Terminology to the Question's Criteria**\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth (A Singular Miracle):** According to Augustine's system, a miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of nature or a change to an existing law in the sense of God breaking His own rules. Instead, it is the divine activation of a *ratio seminalis* that was part of creation's potential from the beginning but lay dormant. The event is contrary to the *ordinary course of nature* that we observe, but it is not contrary to the *full potential of nature* as established by God. This terminology allows the virgin birth to be both miraculous and part of God's ordered plan for creation.\n\n*   **The Fall (A Systemic Change):** Augustine's framework can also describe the changes at the Fall. The Fall introduced a corruption into the created order that fundamentally altered the conditions under which the \"seminal reasons\" unfold. The introduction of death, decay, disease, and pain in childbirth can be seen as a systemic shift in the \"laws\" of nature, moving from a pristine state to a fallen one. Augustine's concept provides a mechanism to explain this shift from one natural order to another, post-lapsarian (after the Fall) order.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nAugustine of Hippo was the first major Christian theologian to develop a specific, specialized terminology—the concept of *rationes seminales*—that could be applied to explain both singular miracles that deviate from the normal course of nature (like the virgin birth) and systemic alterations to the laws of nature itself (like the effects of the Fall). He provided a unified framework where both types of events are expressions of God's single, ordered, and providential plan for creation.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
