    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the User's Question**\nThe user wants to know two specific pieces of information about the bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*:\n1.  The currently used common name for this genus within its native range (North and Central America).\n2.  The year this common name was coined or first established in a significant publication.\nThe final answer must be in the format \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Common Name**\n*   **Identify the Genus:** The genus is *Perdita*. These are known for being exceptionally small bees, often with iridescent or colorful markings.\n*   **Research Current Usage:** A search of reputable entomological and conservation resources is necessary.\n    *   **The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation**, a leading authority, refers to the genus *Perdita* as \"Fairy Bees.\"\n    *   **BugGuide.net**, a primary resource for North American insect identification, lists the common name for the genus as \"Fairy Bees.\"\n    *   **\"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\"** (Wilson & Carril, 2016), a highly influential and comprehensive field guide, prominently features this group under the common name \"Fairy Bees.\"\n*   **Conclusion on Name:** The consensus from authoritative sources confirms that the currently used common name is **Fairy Bees**. The name is descriptive, reflecting their diminutive size.\n\n**Step 3: Determine When the Name was Coined**\n*   **Challenge of Common Names:** Unlike scientific names, which have a formal publication date, common names can arise informally and their origin can be difficult to trace. The goal is to find the first significant publication or event that established the name.\n*   **Investigate Historical Literature:** Reviewing older, major taxonomic works on bees reveals that the name \"Fairy Bees\" is a recent development.\n    *   The extensive works of Philip H. Timberlake on *Perdita* (spanning from the 1920s to the 1980s) do not use this common name.\n    *   Charles Michener's definitive scholarly work, \"The Bees of the World\" (2nd Ed., 2007), also does not mention \"Fairy Bees\" as a common name for the genus.\n    *   This lack of the name in major works before the 2010s indicates it was not established or widely used.\n*   **Identify the Origin:** The popularization and likely coining of the name are strongly associated with the book \"The Bees in Your Backyard\" by Joseph S. Wilson and Olivia Messinger Carril.\n    *   In the book's introduction, the authors state that while they used existing common names where possible, \"We also have coined a few new names for genera or groups of genera that have none.\"\n    *   Stronger evidence comes directly from one of the authors. In a November 2015 blog post for Scientific American, promoting the forthcoming book, author Olivia Messinger Carril wrote about a *Perdita* bee: \"We called them this because they are so tiny, and often iridescent.\" The use of \"We called them this\" is a direct claim of coining the name.\n*   **Conclusion on Year:** The blog post was in November 2015, and the book was published in late December 2015 (with a 2016 copyright). The act of coining and publicly introducing the name occurred in **2015**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer Formulation**\n*   **Common Name:** Fairy Bees\n*   **Year Coined:** 2015\n*   **Formatted Answer:** Fairy Bees, 2015\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 2015>>>"
