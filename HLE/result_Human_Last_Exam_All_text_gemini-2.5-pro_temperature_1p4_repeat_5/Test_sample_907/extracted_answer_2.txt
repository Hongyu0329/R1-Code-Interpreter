For a chain of molecules absorbing an ultrashort Gaussian-shape laser pulse, the absorption cross-section within the first-order time-dependent perturbation theory for a transition from state $|i\rangle$ to $|f\rangle$ (both with energies below the Fermi level, assuming $|i\rangle$ is occupied and $|f\rangle$ is empty) is given by the following equations for the two cases:

Let $\omega_0 = (\epsilon_f - \epsilon_i)/\hbar$ be the transition frequency and $\vec{\mu}_{fi}^{(mol)}$ be the transition dipole moment for a single molecule. Let $\omega_L$ be the laser frequency and $\tau$ be the pulse duration parameter.

**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected:**

In this case, each of the $N$ molecules acts as an independent absorber. The total cross-section is the sum of the individual cross-sections. This results in an absorption peak at the frequency of the molecular transition.

$\sigma_a(\omega_L) = \frac{N\sqrt{\pi}\tau\omega_0}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} |\vec{\mu}_{fi}^{(mol)} \cdot \vec{e}|^2 e^{-\tau^2(\omega_0 - \omega_L)^2}$

Here, $|\vec{\mu}_{fi}^{(mol)} \cdot \vec{e}|^2$ represents the squared transition dipole moment projected onto the laser polarization vector $\vec{e}$.

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered:**

In this case, the molecular excitations couple to form delocalized exciton states. Due to selection rules in a linear chain, only the exciton state with wavevector $k=0$ is optically active. This concentrates the entire absorption strength of the chain into a single transition which is shifted in energy.

$\sigma_b(\omega_L) = \frac{N\sqrt{\pi}\tau}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} \left(\omega_0 + \frac{2J}{\hbar}\right) |\vec{\mu}_{fi}^{(mol)} \cdot \vec{e}|^2 e^{-\tau^2\left(\left(\omega_0 + \frac{2J}{\hbar}\right) - \omega_L\right)^2}$

Here, $J$ is the nearest-neighbor coupling energy (hopping integral). The interaction causes a shift in the absorption peak frequency by $2J/\hbar$ compared to the non-interacting case. The shape remains a Gaussian determined by the laser pulse.
