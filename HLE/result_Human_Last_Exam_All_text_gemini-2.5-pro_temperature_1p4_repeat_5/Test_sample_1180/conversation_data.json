    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Curve and the Field:**\n    The curve is defined by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$, since the degree of the polynomial on the right is $5 = 2g+1$.\n    The analysis is to be done \"above 2 with respect to the valuation $v$ normalized to $v(2)=1$\". This means we work over the field of 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, and its extensions. The valuation $v$ is the standard 2-adic valuation, $v_2$.\n\n2.  **Initial Model and its Reduction:**\n    Let's consider the given equation as a model over the ring of 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    The reduction of the equation modulo 2 is:\n    $z^2 \\equiv 0 \\cdot x^5 + 0 \\cdot x^3 + 1 \\pmod 2$\n    $z^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2 \\implies (z-1)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    The special fiber is a non-reduced line. This means the curve has bad reduction, and this is not a semistable model. We need to find a better model to determine the stable reduction.\n\n3.  **Change of Variables and a Better Model:**\n    To simplify the analysis, we aim for a model of the form $w^2 = g(y)$ where $g(y)$ is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients. A standard change of variables is $x = ay$ and $z=bw$. Let's try to remove the leading coefficient of $2x^5$.\n    Let $x = y/c$. $z^2 = 2(y/c)^5 + 2(y/c)^3 + 1$.\n    $z^2 = \\frac{2y^5}{c^5} + \\frac{2y^3}{c^3} + 1$.\n    To make the $y^5$ coefficient 1, we need to multiply the equation by $c^5/2$.\n    $\\frac{c^5}{2} z^2 = y^5 + c^2 y^3 + \\frac{c^5}{2}$.\n    For the coefficients to be integers, we need $c$ to be a power of 2. Let $c=2$.\n    Then $\\frac{32}{2} z^2 = y^5 + 4y^3 + \\frac{32}{2}$.\n    $16z^2 = y^5 + 4y^3 + 16$.\n    Let $w = 4z$. The equation becomes $w^2 = y^5 + 4y^3 + 16$.\n    Let $g(y) = y^5 + 4y^3 + 16$. This is a new model for the curve, defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Its branch points are the roots of $g(y)=0$ and the point at infinity.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the New Model's Branch Points:**\n    We use the Newton Polygon of $g(y)$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v_2$. The coefficients of $g(y)$ are $c_5=1, c_3=4, c_0=16$.\n    Their 2-adic valuations are $v_2(c_5)=0, v_2(c_3)=v_2(2^2)=2, v_2(c_0)=v_2(2^4)=4$.\n    We plot the points $(i, v_2(c_i))$: $(5,0), (3,2), (0,4)$.\n    The lower convex hull of these points is the single line segment connecting $(0,4)$ and $(5,0)$. The point $(3,2)$ lies above this segment (the line is $Y=4-4X/5$; for $X=3, Y=8/5=1.6$, and $2>1.6$).\n    The slope of this segment is $(0-4)/(5-0) = -4/5$.\n    The valuations of the roots of $g(y)=0$ (let's call them $\\beta_i$) are given by the negative of the slope. So, $v_2(\\beta_i) = -(-4/5) = 4/5$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 5$.\n\n5.  **Field Extension:**\n    Since the valuations of the roots are fractional, we must work in a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The denominator of the valuation is 5, which indicates we need an extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}_2$ with ramification index $e(K/\\mathbb{Q}_2)$ being a multiple of 5. Let's take the simplest such field, $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\pi)$ where $\\pi^5 = 2u$ for a unit $u$. We can choose $u=1$, so $\\pi^5=2$.\n    The valuation $v_\\pi$ on $K$ is normalized so that $v_\\pi(\\pi) = 1$. The relation to $v_2$ is $v_2(a) = v_\\pi(a)/5$.\n    For the roots $\\beta_i$, their valuation in $K$ is $v_\\pi(\\beta_i) = 5 \\cdot v_2(\\beta_i) = 5 \\cdot (4/5) = 4$.\n    So, each root can be written as $\\beta_i = \\pi^4 u_i$, where $u_i$ is a unit in the ring of integers $O_K$.\n\n6.  **Clustering of Roots:**\n    To find out more about the units $u_i$, we substitute $y=\\pi^4 u$ into the equation $g(y)=0$:\n    $(\\pi^4 u)^5 + 4(\\pi^4 u)^3 + 16 = 0$\n    $\\pi^{20} u^5 + 2^2 \\pi^{12} u^3 + 2^4 = 0$\n    Using $\\pi^5=2$, we get $2^4 u^5 + ( \\pi^5 )^2 \\pi^{12} u^3 + (\\pi^5)^4 = 0$, so $\\pi^{20} u^5 + \\pi^{22} u^3 + \\pi^{20} = 0$.\n    Dividing by $\\pi^{20}$, we get the equation for the unit parts: $u^5 + \\pi^2 u^3 + 1 = 0$.\n    To see how the roots $u_i$ cluster, we reduce this equation modulo $\\pi$. The residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n    $u^5 + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod \\pi$.\n    This polynomial factors over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ as $(u+1)(u^4+u^3+u^2+u+1) = 0$.\n    The polynomial $u^4+u^3+u^2+u+1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n    By Hensel's Lemma, this implies that of the five roots $u_i$, one root ($u_1$) has residue $1 \\pmod \\pi$, while the other four roots ($u_2, u_3, u_4, u_5$) have residues that are the roots of the irreducible quartic.\n    This partitions the set of roots $\\{\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_5\\}$ into two clusters: $P_1=\\{\\beta_1\\}$ and $P_2=\\{\\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_4, \\beta_5\\}$.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Thickness of the Double Point:**\n    The stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve can be a graph of curves meeting at nodes (double points). The components of the graph correspond to partitions of the branch points. The clustering we found suggests a partition that will create a node.\n    The branch points of our curve $w^2=g(y)$ are $B = \\{\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_5, \\infty\\}$. The genus of a component of the special fiber is given by $(|B_C|-2)/2$, where $B_C$ is the set of branch points on that component. This requires $|B_C|$ to be even. The partition of $\\{\\beta_i\\}$ into sets of size 1 and 4 must be augmented with $\\infty$ to create a partition of $B$ into two sets of even size. The only way is $I = \\{\\beta_1, \\infty\\}$ and $J = \\{\\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_4, \\beta_5\\}$.\n    The thickness $e$ of the double point corresponding to this partition $(I,J)$ is given by the formula:\n    $e(I,J) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i \\in I, j \\in J} v(r_i - r_j)$.\n    We use the valuation $v_\\pi$. The formula involves valuations of differences of branch points.\n    $v_\\pi(\\beta_1 - \\beta_j) = v_\\pi(\\pi^4 u_1 - \\pi^4 u_j) = v_\\pi(\\pi^4(u_1-u_j)) = 4 + v_\\pi(u_1-u_j)$.\n    Since $\\bar u_1=1$ and $\\bar u_j \\neq 1$ for $j \\in \\{2,3,4,5\\}$, the difference $u_1-u_j$ is a unit, so $v_\\pi(u_1-u_j) = 0$. Thus, $v_\\pi(\\beta_1-\\beta_j)=4$ for $j \\in \\{2,3,4,5\\}$.\n    For the difference with infinity, a standard convention is to set $v(r-\\infty)=0$ for any finite $r$.\n    Now we compute the sum:\n    $\\sum_{i \\in I, j \\in J} v_\\pi(r_i - r_j) = \\sum_{j \\in J} v_\\pi(\\beta_1 - j) + \\sum_{j \\in J} v_\\pi(\\infty - j)$\n    $= [v_\\pi(\\beta_1-\\beta_2) + v_\\pi(\\beta_1-\\beta_3) + v_\\pi(\\beta_1-\\beta_4) + v_\\pi(\\beta_1-\\beta_5)] + [v_\\pi(\\infty-\\beta_2) + \\dots]$\n    $= [4+4+4+4] + [0+0+0+0] = 16$.\n    The thickness, with respect to $v_\\pi$, is $e_{v_\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2}(16) = 8$.\n\n8.  **Final Answer Normalization:**\n    The thickness is an integer with respect to the valuation of the field where the stable reduction is defined, which here is $K$. The value is $e_{v_\\pi}=8$. This means the local equation of the node is of the form $X Y = c \\pi^8$ for some unit $c \\in O_K$.\n    The question asks for the thickness with respect to the valuation $v=v_2$ normalized by $v(2)=1$. This corresponds to computing the $v_2$-valuation of the parameter $t=c\\pi^8$.\n    $v_2(t) = v_2(c\\pi^8) = v_2(c) + 8v_2(\\pi)$.\n    Since $c$ is a unit, $v_2(c)=0$. We have $v_2(\\pi) = 1/e(K/\\mathbb{Q}_2) = 1/5$.\n    Therefore, the final value is:\n    Thickness = $8 \\times (1/5) = 8/5$.\n\n<<<8/5>>>"
