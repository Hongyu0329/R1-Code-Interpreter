    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the initial value problem.\n\n**1. Identify and Classify the Differential Equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. We can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nWe can see that the variables $x$ and $t$ can be separated, so this is a separable equation.\n\n**2. Separate the Variables**\nTo separate the variables, we move all terms involving $x$ to one side with $dx$ and all terms involving $t$ to the other side with $dt$. Since the initial condition is $x(0)=-8 \\neq 0$, we can safely divide by $x^2(t)$ without losing the specific solution we are looking for.\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n\n**3. Integrate Both Sides**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's compute each integral:\n-   Left side: $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n-   Right side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$\n\nCombining these results and adding a constant of integration, $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the Initial Condition to Find the Constant C**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our integrated equation to solve for $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**5. Write the Particular Solution**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the integrated equation to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo make it easier to work with, let's solve for $x(t)$. First, multiply by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} $$\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n\n**6. Calculate x(1)**\nThe final step is to find the value of $x(1)$ by substituting $t=1$ into our particular solution:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{(1)^2}{2} + (1) - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\nTo simplify the denominator, find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{8}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{-4 + 8 - 1}{8}} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{8}} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Check for Constant Solutions:** The equation $x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t)$ has a constant solution $x(t)=0$. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, so this constant solution is not the one we are looking for. This check justifies dividing by $x^2$.\n2.  **Constant of Integration:** Do not forget to add the constant of integration, $C$, after performing the indefinite integrals. This is a critical step in finding the general solution.\n3.  **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be careful with signs and fractions when solving for the constant $C$ and then when solving for $x(t)$. A small error can lead to a completely different final answer. For example, getting $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\dots$ and correctly finding $C=\\frac{1}{8}$.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** When substituting $t=1$, simplify the arithmetic in the denominator carefully. Using a common denominator is a reliable method to avoid errors with fractions.\n5.  **Domain of the Solution:** The solution is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}}$. It is defined as long as the denominator is not zero. The denominator is zero when $t=1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Our interval of interest contains $t=0$ and $t=1$. Since $1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.134$ and $1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 1.866$, the interval of validity for the initial condition at $t=0$ is $(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$. Since $t=1$ is within this interval, the solution is well-defined at $t=1$.\n\n<<<$8/3$>>>"
