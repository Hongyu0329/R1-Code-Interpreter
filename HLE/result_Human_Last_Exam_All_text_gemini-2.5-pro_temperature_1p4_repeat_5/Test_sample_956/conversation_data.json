    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the group G**\n\nLet $S = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$ be the set of 12 elements on which the permutations act. For convenience, let's map these to numbers: $x \\to 10, y \\to 11, z \\to 12$. The generators of the group $G$ are:\n$a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, 11, 10)$\n$b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, 10, 7, 6)$\n$c = (1, 2)(3, 12)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, 11)(9, 10)$\n\nWe determine the parity of these permutations.\n- $a$ is an 11-cycle. The sign of an $m$-cycle is $(-1)^{m-1}$. So, the sign of $a$ is $(-1)^{11-1} = (-1)^{10} = +1$. Thus, $a$ is an even permutation.\n- $b$ is a product of two disjoint 4-cycles. A 4-cycle is odd ($(-1)^{4-1}=-1$). The product of two odd permutations is even. Thus, $b$ is an even permutation.\n- $c$ is a product of six disjoint 2-cycles (transpositions). The sign is $(-1)^6 = +1$. Thus, $c$ is an even permutation.\n\nSince all generators are even permutations, the group $G = \\langle a, b, c \\rangle$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_{12}$.\n$G \\le A_{12}$.\n\nNext, we check if $G$ is transitive. The orbit of element 1 under the generators is:\n$a(1)=3, b(1)=8, c(1)=2$.\nWe can reach {2,3,8} from 1. Applying the generators to these new elements, and repeating, we find that we can reach all 12 elements of the set $S$. For example, $c(3)=12=z$, so we can reach 12. As shown in the thought process, the orbit of 1 is the entire set $S$. Therefore, $G$ is a transitive group of degree 12.\n\nLet's analyze the stabilizer of the point $12$ (which is $z$), denoted by $G_{12}$. An element of $G$ is in $G_{12}$ if it fixes the point 12.\nThe generators $a$ and $b$ fix 12, so $a, b \\in G_{12}$.\nLet $H = \\langle a, b \\rangle$. Then $H$ is a subgroup of $G_{12}$. $H$ acts on the set $S' = S \\setminus \\{12\\}$ of 11 elements.\n$a$ is an 11-cycle on $S'$. $b$ is a permutation of order 4 on $S'$.\nAs shown in the scratchpad, the subgroup $H_1 = Stab_H(1)$ is transitive on the remaining 10 points of $S'$. This means that $H$ acts 2-transitively on the 11 points of $S'$.\nThe known 2-transitive groups of degree 11 are $PSL(2,11)$, $M_{11}$, $A_{11}$, and $S_{11}$. Since $H \\le G \\le A_{12}$, all its elements acting on $S'$ must be in $A_{11}$. So $H \\le A_{11}$.\nLet's consider the element $b^2 = (1, 5)(8, 9)(4, 7)(6, 10)$. This is an element of order 2 in $H$. It fixes the points $\\{2, 3, 11\\}$ in $S'$.\nIn $PSL(2,11)$, an involution has at most 2 fixed points in its permutation representation on 11 points (the projective line $P_1(F_{11})$).\nIn $M_{11}$, an involution (class 2A) has cycle structure $2^4 1^3$, so it fixes 3 points.\nThis suggests that $H$ is isomorphic to $M_{11}$ in its standard action on 11 points.\n\nNow let's consider other elements in $G_{12}$. Let's compute $cbc \\in G$.\n$c(12)=3, b(3)=3, c(3)=12$. So $cbc(12)=12$, which means $cbc \\in G_{12}$.\nLet's find the permutation form of $cbc$ on $S'$:\n$cbc = c(1, 8, 5, 9)(4, 10, 7, 6)c = (c(1),c(8),c(5),c(9))(c(4),c(10),c(7),c(6))$\n$cbc = (2, 4, 6, 10)(8, 9, 11, 5)$.\nThis is an element of order 4. Let's see how many points it fixes in $S'$. It fixes $\\{1, 3, 7\\}$. So it has 3 fixed points.\nNow we check if this element can belong to $H \\cong M_{11}$. The character table for $M_{11}$ shows the number of fixed points for elements of each conjugacy class in its degree 11 representation. For an element of order 4 (class 4A), the number of fixed points is 1.\nThe element $cbc$ has order 4 and 3 fixed points. Therefore, $cbc$ is not in $H$.\nSo, $G_{12}$ contains $H \\cong M_{11}$ as a proper subgroup. Since $H$ and $cbc$ consist of even permutations, $G_{12}$ is a subgroup of $A_{11}$.\nThe group $M_{11}$ is a maximal subgroup of $A_{11}$. Since $G_{12}$ is a subgroup of $A_{11}$ that properly contains $M_{11}$, it must be that $G_{12} \\cong A_{11}$.\n\nNow we can determine the order of $G$:\n$|G| = |G_{12}| \\cdot |\\text{orbit of 12}| = |A_{11}| \\cdot 12 = \\frac{11!}{2} \\cdot 12 = \\frac{12!}{2} = |A_{12}|$.\nSince $G \\le A_{12}$ and $|G| = |A_{12}|$, we conclude that $G = A_{12}$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Schur Multiplier of G**\n\nThe problem asks for the Schur multiplier of $G$, which we denote by $A$. So we need to find the Schur multiplier of $A_{12}$. The Schur multiplier of a group $G$ is the second homology group $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nFor the alternating groups $A_n$, the Schur multiplier $M(A_n)$ is known:\n- $M(A_n) \\cong C_2$ for $n \\ge 4$, with the exceptions of $n=6, 7$.\n- $M(A_6) \\cong C_6$ and $M(A_7) \\cong C_6$.\n\nFor $n=12$, we are in the general case. So, the Schur multiplier of $G=A_{12}$ is:\n$A = M(A_{12}) \\cong C_2$.\nThe Schur multiplier $A$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n**Step 3: Count the proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism**\n\nThe group $A$ is isomorphic to $C_2$. Let's list the subgroups of $C_2$. Let $C_2 = \\{e, g\\}$ where $e$ is the identity and $g^2 = e$. The subgroups are:\n1. The trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n2. The group $C_2$ itself.\n\nA proper subgroup of $A$ is any subgroup $H$ such that $H \\neq A$. For $A \\cong C_2$, the only proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n\nThe question asks for the number of proper subgroups \"up to isomorphism\". This means we must count how many non-isomorphic groups are in the set of proper subgroups.\nThe set of proper subgroups of $A$ is $S = \\{\\{e\\}\\}$.\nThe isomorphism class of $\\{e\\}$ is that of the trivial group, which is often denoted as $C_1$. All subgroups in $S$ are isomorphic to $C_1$.\nThus, there is only one isomorphism class of proper subgroups.\n\nThe number of proper subgroups of $A$, up to isomorphism, is 1."
