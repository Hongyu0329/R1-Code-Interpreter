    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify Key Components\n\n1.  **Peptide Size:** \"a small 100aa peptide\". While termed \"small\", 100 amino acids is a significant length for purely chemical synthesis.\n2.  **Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA):** The peptide contains \"X as an unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine\" (AzF or pAzF). This is the critical constraint.\n3.  **Goal:** To determine the \"most helpful\" technique for synthesizing this specific peptide. This implies we need to compare the feasibility, efficiency, and scalability of different methods.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Analyze Potential Techniques\n\nWe need to evaluate the common methods for peptide/protein synthesis in light of the two main challenges: the length (100 aa) and the UAA (azido phenylalanine).\n\n**Technique 1: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n\n*   **How it works:** Amino acids are sequentially coupled to a growing peptide chain that is anchored to a solid resin. The unnatural amino acid (AzF) can be incorporated by simply using a protected AzF derivative in the corresponding synthesis cycle.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   **Length (100 aa):** This is the major drawback. The efficiency of each coupling step is never 100%. For a 100 aa peptide, this involves 99 coupling reactions.\n    *   **Yield:** Even with a high 99.5% efficiency per step, the theoretical maximum yield would be (0.995)^99 ≈ 61%. In practice, it's often lower.\n    *   **Purity:** A more significant problem is the accumulation of side-products, especially deletion sequences (where an amino acid failed to couple). Separating the full-length 100-mer from a 99-mer is extremely difficult.\n    *   **Conclusion:** While technically possible, direct SPPS for a 100-mer is inefficient, expensive, and results in a product that is very difficult to purify. It is generally not the \"most helpful\" technique for peptides of this length.\n\n**Technique 2: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n\n*   **How it works:** This technique ligates (joins) two smaller, unprotected peptide fragments. For a 100-mer, one could synthesize two ~50-mer fragments separately. The fragment containing the UAA would be made via SPPS. The other fragment could also be made via SPPS or, if it contains no UAAs, by recombinant expression. One fragment needs an N-terminal Cysteine, and the other needs a C-terminal thioester.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   **Advantage over SPPS:** Synthesizing two 50-mer peptides is vastly more efficient and easier to purify than one 100-mer peptide. This approach significantly increases overall yield and purity.\n    *   **Incorporating UAA:** The azido phenylalanine is easily incorporated into one of the smaller fragments using SPPS, which is routine for ~50-mer peptides.\n    *   **Constraint:** The method requires a Cysteine residue at the ligation site. The sequence provided, `...KAVCLXVIGATR...`, conveniently contains a Cysteine (C), making NCL a very plausible strategy.\n    *   **Conclusion:** NCL is a powerful semi-synthetic method that is well-suited for producing peptides in the 50-150 aa range, especially those with UAAs. It is a very strong candidate.\n\n**Technique 3: Recombinant Expression with Genetic Code Expansion**\n\n*   **How it works:** This is a biological approach. It involves reprogramming the protein synthesis machinery of a host organism (like *E. coli*) to incorporate the UAA at a specific site.\n    1.  **Orthogonal System:** A new aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and its partner tRNA are introduced into the cell. This pair works independently of the host's own synthetases and tRNAs. The new aaRS is engineered to specifically recognize the UAA (azido phenylalanine) and charge it onto the new tRNA.\n    2.  **Codon Reassignment:** The new tRNA is engineered to recognize a codon that is normally not used for an amino acid, typically a stop codon like the amber codon (UAG).\n    3.  **Gene Modification:** The gene encoding the 100 aa peptide is modified so that the codon at position 'X' is changed to UAG.\n    4.  **Synthesis:** The engineered *E. coli* are grown in media supplemented with azido phenylalanine. When the ribosome translates the modified gene and reaches the UAG codon, the engineered tRNA delivers the azido phenylalanine, and synthesis continues to produce the full-length peptide containing the UAA.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   **Power and Scalability:** This method leverages the high efficiency of cellular protein synthesis. Once the biological system is set up, large quantities of the UAA-containing peptide can be produced at a relatively low cost.\n    *   **Feasibility:** Azido phenylalanine is one of the most commonly incorporated UAAs, and the required orthogonal aaRS/tRNA systems are well-established and even commercially available. This significantly lowers the barrier to using this technique.\n    *   **Conclusion:** For a 100 aa peptide, which is easily expressed in *E. coli*, this is arguably the most powerful and scalable method. It completely bypasses the limitations of chemical synthesis.\n\n### Step 3: Final Analysis and Selection of the \"Most Helpful\" Technique\n\n*   **SPPS** is not ideal due to the length.\n*   **NCL** is a very good method that solves the length problem of SPPS. It is an excellent choice.\n*   **Genetic Code Expansion** is also an excellent choice. It solves the problem by moving it into the biological realm, offering superior scalability and potentially lower cost for larger-scale production.\n\nComparing NCL and Genetic Code Expansion, the latter is often considered more powerful for producing protein-sized molecules (≥100 aa). It harnesses the cell's robust and efficient machinery. While it requires an upfront investment in molecular biology, the tools for incorporating azido phenylalanine are so well-established that it has become a routine and extremely helpful technique for this class of problem. It avoids chemical synthesis of large fragments altogether. Therefore, it stands out as the most helpful modern technique.\n\n<<<Genetic Code Expansion using an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair (often via amber stop codon suppression)>>>"
