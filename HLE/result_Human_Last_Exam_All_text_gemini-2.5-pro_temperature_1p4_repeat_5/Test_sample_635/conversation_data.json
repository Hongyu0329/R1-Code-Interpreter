    "An analysis of the question is as follows, with careful points listed and a step-by-step derivation of the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe need to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means finding two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$, where $D(s)$ is invertible (i.e., $\\det(D(s))$ is not the zero polynomial).\n2.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$.\n\n**2. Set up the defining equation**\n\nThe equation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ is equivalent to $D(s) H(s) = N(s)$. Let's write this out with a general polynomial matrix $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n\\[\nN(s) = D(s) H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nPerforming the matrix multiplication gives:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix}\nd_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\\nd_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**3. Find conditions for $D(s)$ to make $N(s)$ polynomial**\n\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all its entries must be polynomials.\n*   From the second column, we see that $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials. This is already part of the definition of $D(s)$.\n*   For the first column entries to be polynomials, the denominators must cancel. The common denominator is $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$.\n\nLet's rewrite the first column entries with the common denominator:\n*   $n_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$\n*   $n_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$\n\nFor these expressions to be polynomials, the numerators must be zero at the roots of the denominator, which are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\n**Condition set 1 (for the first row of D(s))**:\nThe numerator $d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$ must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n*   At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$. This means $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n*   At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n\n**Condition set 2 (for the second row of D(s))**:\nThe numerator $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$ must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n*   At $s=1$: $d_{21}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(1)=0$. This means $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n*   At $s=-1$: $d_{21}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{21}(-1) + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n\n**4. Construct a minimal degree polynomial matrix $D(s)$**\n\nWe need to find the simplest (lowest degree) polynomials that satisfy these conditions and form an invertible matrix $D(s)$.\n\n**For the first row $[d_{11}(s) \\quad d_{12}(s)]$**:\nLet's try a low-degree solution. Let $d_{11}(s) = 1$ (degree 0). From the condition $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$, we get $2(1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(-1)=-2$.\nWe also know $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor $(s-1)$. The simplest polynomial satisfying $d_{12}(1)=0$ and $d_{12}(-1)=-2$ is a degree 1 polynomial, $d_{12}(s) = c(s-1)$. Plugging in $s=-1$, we get $-2c = -2 \\implies c=1$.\nSo, a possible first row is $d_{11}(s) = 1$ and $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\nThis gives the first row of $D(s)$ as: $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\n\n**For the second row $[d_{21}(s) \\quad d_{22}(s)]$**:\nWe need a second row that is linearly independent of the first. Let's try to make it simple by setting $d_{21}(s) = 0$.\nThe conditions for the second row become:\n*   $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor $(s-1)$.\n*   $2(0) + d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(-1) = 0$. This means $d_{22}(s)$ must also have a factor $(s+1)$.\nCombining these, $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)(s+1) = s^2-1$.\nThe simplest non-zero choice is $d_{22}(s) = s^2-1$.\nThis gives the second row of $D(s)$ as: $[0 \\quad s^2-1]$.\n\nNow we assemble the matrix $D(s)$:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant is $\\det(D(s)) = 1(s^2-1) - 0(s-1) = s^2-1$. This is not the zero polynomial, so $D(s)$ is invertible. The rows are linearly independent.\n\n**5. Calculate the corresponding matrix $N(s)$**\n\nNow we compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nLet's calculate the entries of $N(s)$:\n*   $n_{11}(s) = (1)\\left(\\frac{s-1}{s+1}\\right) + (s-1)\\left(\\frac{2}{s^2-1}\\right) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} = \\frac{s+1}{s+1} = 1$\n*   $n_{12}(s) = (1)(1) + (s-1)(0) = 1$\n*   $n_{21}(s) = (0)\\left(\\frac{s-1}{s+1}\\right) + (s^2-1)\\left(\\frac{2}{s^2-1}\\right) = 2$\n*   $n_{22}(s) = (0)(1) + (s^2-1)(0) = 0$\n\nSo the matrix $N(s)$ is:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**6. Verify Coprimeness**\n\nThe final step is to verify that $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. We check if the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has rank 2 for all complex $s$.\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rank of this matrix can be less than 2 only if the two rows are linearly dependent. Since the first element of the first row is 1 and the first element of the second row is 0, the only way they can be dependent is if the second row is a zero vector. The second row is $[0, s^2-1, 2, 0]$. This is never the zero vector because the third element is 2. Therefore, the rows are always linearly independent, and the matrix has rank 2 for all $s$.\n\nThe factorization is correct and coprime.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ is given by:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
