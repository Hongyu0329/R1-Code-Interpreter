    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry (1S,2R) is specified.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide ($KOC(CH_3)_3$, or $KO^tBu$) in tert-butyl alcohol. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. Tert-butyl alcohol is a polar solvent that serves as the conjugate acid of the base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an E2 (elimination, bimolecular) reaction mechanism. SN2 is disfavored due to the steric bulk of the base.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\n\n*   The E2 mechanism is a concerted (one-step) process where the base removes a proton, the C-H bond breaks, a pi bond forms, and the leaving group departs simultaneously.\n*   For this to occur, the C-H bond being broken and the C-Br bond (the leaving group) must be **anti-periplanar**. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement. The leaving group (Br) and the beta-hydrogen (H) must both be in axial positions, on adjacent carbons, and pointing in opposite directions (e.g., one axial-up, one axial-down).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Conformation of the Substrate**\n\n*   First, we need to determine the relative configuration (cis or trans) of the bromo and methyl groups from the absolute configuration (1S,2R). A (1R,2S) or (1S,2R) configuration on a cyclohexane ring corresponds to a **trans** relationship between the substituents. Conversely, (1R,2R) or (1S,2S) corresponds to a cis relationship.\n*   Therefore, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a **trans-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane**.\n*   A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations:\n    1.  A **diequatorial** conformation (both Br and Me are in equatorial positions).\n    2.  A **diaxial** conformation (both Br and Me are in axial positions).\n*   The diequatorial conformer is much more stable than the diaxial conformer because axial substituents lead to unfavorable 1,3-diaxial steric interactions. Thus, at any given moment, most of the substrate molecules will be in the diequatorial conformation.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Reactive Conformer**\n\n*   The E2 reaction requires the leaving group (Br) to be in an **axial** position.\n*   The major, diequatorial conformer has an equatorial Br atom, so it **cannot** undergo E2 elimination directly.\n*   The molecule must first ring-flip into the less stable, minor, **diaxial** conformer for the reaction to proceed. The reaction will be slower than if the reactive conformer were the major one, but it will still occur through this minor population of molecules.\n    *   **Reactive Conformer:** Br is axial, and Me is axial.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Available Beta-Hydrogens for Elimination**\n\n*   In the reactive (diaxial) conformer, the bromine atom is on C1 in an axial position. Let's assume it's axial-up.\n*   The alpha-carbon is C1. The beta-carbons are C2 and C6. We must look for hydrogens on these carbons that are also axial (specifically, axial-down to be trans-diaxial to the axial-up Br).\n*   **At C2:** The methyl group is in an axial position (it must be axial-down since it is trans to the axial-up Br). This means the hydrogen on C2 is in an **equatorial** position. Since there is no axial hydrogen on C2, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 is **impossible**.\n*   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The hydrogen in the **axial-down** position is trans-diaxial to the axial-up bromine on C1.\n*   **Conclusion:** The base ($t-BuO^-$) can only abstract the axial hydrogen from C6.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Product**\n\n*   Since elimination can only occur by removing a proton from C6, the double bond will form between C1 and C6.\n*   The methyl group on C2 is unaffected by the elimination and remains on the ring.\n*   Numbering the resulting alkene according to IUPAC rules, the double bond carbons are C1 and C2 (or C1 and C6). If the double bond is between the original C1 and C6, the methyl group is on the adjacent carbon (the original C2). This places the methyl group at the 3-position relative to the new double bond.\n*   The name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Points Summary**\n\n*   **Stereochemistry is Key:** The strict anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) requirement of the E2 reaction is the most important factor in determining the product for cyclohexane systems.\n*   **Reactive Conformer:** The reaction proceeds through the less stable conformer if it is the only one that meets the stereochemical requirement.\n*   **Zaitsev's Rule vs. Stereochemistry:** Zaitsev's rule predicts the formation of the more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene in this case). However, when stereochemical constraints prevent the formation of the Zaitsev product, they override the rule. The only product that can be formed is the one allowed by the stereochemistry (3-methylcyclohexene), even though it's the less substituted (Hofmann-like) product.\n\nFinal product: 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
