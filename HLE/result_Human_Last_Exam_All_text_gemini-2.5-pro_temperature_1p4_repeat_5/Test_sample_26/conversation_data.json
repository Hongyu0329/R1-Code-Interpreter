    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the object $X$\n*   Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n*   This means $X$ is defined by the zero set of a smooth homogeneous polynomial of degree 5 in four variables.\n*   $X$ is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ of complex dimension 2. As a real manifold, its dimension is 4.\n*   By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, for a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ with $n \\ge 3$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $k < n-1$. Here $n=3$, so this holds for $k < 2$.\n*   Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, we have $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. So $X$ is simply connected.\n*   A smooth projective variety is a compact Kähler manifold.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a method to compute the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$\nThe rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its rationalization. We will compute the dimension of the rational homotopy group $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. This can be done using rational homotopy theory, particularly the theory of minimal Sullivan models, for which we need the Betti numbers of $X$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Betti numbers of $X$\nThe Betti numbers $b_k(X) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} H_k(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ are needed. $X$ is a 4-dimensional real manifold, so $b_k = 0$ for $k > 4$.\n\n*   **$b_0, b_1, b_3, b_4$:**\n    *   Since $X$ is connected, $b_0(X) = 1$.\n    *   Since $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X)=0$), $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$, so $b_1(X) = 0$.\n    *   By Poincaré duality for the compact oriented 4-manifold $X$, we have $b_4(X) = b_0(X) = 1$ and $b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\n\n*   **$b_2$:**\n    *   To find $b_2$, we compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^4 (-1)^k b_k(X)$.\n    *   Using the Betti numbers we have so far, $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic of a degree-$d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ can be calculated. A general formula for the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X_d^n)$ of a smooth degree $d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^{n+1}$ is given by the Hirzebruch formula, or more simply through Chern classes.\n    *   Using the formula for the total Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$, $c(T_X) = c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X) / c(N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3})$, where $N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3}$ is the normal bundle $\\mathcal{O}_X(5)$. Let $h$ be the hyperplane class on $X$.\n        *   $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X) = (1+h)^4|_X = 1 + 4h + 6h^2$.\n        *   $c(N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3}) = 1 + 5h$.\n        *   $c(T_X) = (1+4h+6h^2)(1-5h+25h^2) = 1 - h + 11h^2$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic is the degree of the top Chern class, $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(T_X)$.\n    *   $\\int_X c_2(T_X) = \\int_X 11h^2 = 11 \\cdot \\text{deg}(X) = 11 \\cdot 5 = 55$.\n    *   So, $\\chi(X) = 55$.\n    *   Equating the two expressions for $\\chi(X)$, we get $55 = 2 + b_2$, which implies $b_2(X) = 53$.\n\n*   **Summary of Betti numbers:** $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_2=53, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n\n### Step 4: Apply Rational Homotopy Theory\n*   A fundamental result by Deligne, Griffiths, Morgan, and Sullivan states that all compact Kähler manifolds are **formal**. Since $X$ is a smooth projective variety, it is a compact Kähler manifold and thus is formal.\n*   For a simply connected formal space, its rational homotopy type is determined by its rational cohomology algebra. The tool to make this explicit is the **minimal Sullivan model**, an algebraic object $(\\Lambda V, d)$ whose cohomology is the rational cohomology algebra of the space.\n*   The graded vector space $V = \\bigoplus_{k \\ge 2} V^k$ is dual to the rational homotopy groups, i.e., $V^k \\cong (\\pi_k(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q})^*$. The rank of $\\pi_k(X)$ is therefore $\\dim V^k$.\n*   For a simply connected space, the minimal model has $V^1=0$ and the differential $d$ has the property $d(V) \\subset \\Lambda^{\\ge 2}V$.\n*   The connection between the model and the cohomology of $X$ gives the following relations for a simply connected formal space:\n    *   $H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V^2$. Thus, $\\text{rank}(\\pi_2(X)) = \\dim V^2 = b_2 = 53$.\n    *   $H^3(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$. In the model, $H^3(\\Lambda V, d)$ is the kernel of the differential $d: V^3 \\to \\Lambda^2 V^2$. So, $d: V^3 \\to \\Lambda^2 V^2$ is injective.\n    *   $H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is given by the cohomology of the complex at degree 4. Since the differential on generators of degree 2 is zero ($d(V^2)=0$), we have $H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong (\\Lambda^2 V^2)/\\text{Im}(d|_{V^3})$.\n*   This gives a short exact sequence relating the vector spaces:\n    $$0 \\to V^3 \\xrightarrow{d} \\Lambda^2 V^2 \\to H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\to 0$$\n*   From this exact sequence, we can relate the dimensions:\n    $$\\dim(\\Lambda^2 V^2) = \\dim(V^3) + \\dim(H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q}))$$\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Rank\nLet $r_k = \\text{rank}(\\pi_k(X)) = \\dim(V^k)$. The equation from Step 4 becomes:\n$$\\dim(\\Lambda^2 H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})) = r_3 + b_4(X)$$\nWe can solve for $r_3$:\n$$r_3 = \\dim(\\Lambda^2 H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})) - b_4(X)$$\nThis is given by the binomial coefficient of $b_2$:\n$$r_3 = \\binom{b_2}{2} - b_4$$\nPlugging in the values we found:\n*   $b_2 = 53$\n*   $b_4 = 1$\n\n$$r_3 = \\binom{53}{2} - 1 = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} - 1 = (53 \\times 26) - 1 = 1378 - 1 = 1377$$\n\nThe rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1377."
