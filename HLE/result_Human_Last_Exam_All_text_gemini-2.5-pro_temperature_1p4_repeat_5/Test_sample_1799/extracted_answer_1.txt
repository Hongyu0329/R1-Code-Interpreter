No, it is not true. While applying the first postulate to Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism does imply that the speed of light must be a constant, this line of reasoning assumes that the first postulate must apply to Maxwell's equations, which was a point of major debate at the time. Stating the constancy of the speed of light as a separate, second postulate is essential because it explicitly resolves this debate. More fundamentally, the first postulate alone only implies that there must be a single universal invariant speed, but it cannot determine if this speed is finite (leading to Lorentz transformations) or infinite (leading to Galilean transformations). The second postulate provides the crucial physical input: this universal speed is finite and is equal to the speed of light, *c*. Therefore, the second postulate is not superfluous; it is a necessary, independent assertion that provides specific physical content to the theory and establishes the fundamental nature of spacetime.
