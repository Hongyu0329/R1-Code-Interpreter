In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space, $G_0(k, \omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ as the inverse of their difference. Specifically, the relationship is given by:

$G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta \, \text{sgn}(\epsilon_k - \mu)}$

Here, $\omega$ is the frequency, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $i\eta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality. The core functional dependence is that $G_0$ has a simple pole at a complex frequency whose real part is the single-particle energy $\epsilon_k$.
