    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, including careful points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nThe Green's function, in general, describes the propagation of a particle (or excitation) from one spacetime point to another. The \"bare\" or \"non-interacting\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes this propagation in a system without any particle-particle interactions.\n\n*   In the operator formalism, the fermionic Green's function is defined as the time-ordered expectation value of field operators:\n    $G(\\mathbf{r}t, \\mathbf{r}'t') = -i \\langle \\mathcal{T} [\\psi(\\mathbf{r}t) \\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r}'t')] \\rangle$\n*   For the bare Green's function, this expectation value is taken with respect to the ground state of the *non-interacting* Hamiltonian, $H_0$.\n\n**2. Formulate $G_0$ in the Feynman Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe Feynman path integral provides an alternative but equivalent way to calculate such expectation values. The Green's function is expressed as a functional integral over all possible field configurations $(\\psi, \\psi^*)$:\n\n$G_0(x, x') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\psi(x) \\psi^*(x') e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}$\n\nwhere $x=(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ and $S_0$ is the action for the non-interacting system.\n\n**3. Express the Free Action $S_0$ in terms of Energy Eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$**\n\nTo see the dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$, we must work in a basis where the free Hamiltonian $H_0$ is diagonal. The states that diagonalize $H_0$ are the single-particle energy eigenstates, often labeled by a quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum for a translationally invariant system).\n$H_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$\n\n*   The free action is the integral of the free Lagrangian: $S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^d\\mathbf{r} \\, \\mathcal{L}_0$.\n*   The Lagrangian density is $\\mathcal{L}_0 = \\psi^*(\\mathbf{r},t) (i\\hbar\\partial_t - H_0) \\psi(\\mathbf{r},t)$. (We will set $\\hbar=1$ for convenience).\n*   To diagonalize the action, we Fourier transform the fields from real space $(\\mathbf{r})$ to momentum space $(k)$ and from time $(t)$ to frequency $(\\omega)$.\n    $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r} - \\omega t)} \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n*   In this basis, the operators $i\\partial_t$ and $H_0$ become simple numbers:\n    *   $i\\partial_t \\rightarrow \\omega$\n    *   $H_0 \\rightarrow \\epsilon_k$\n*   Substituting this into the action integral, the action becomes diagonal in both $k$ and $\\omega$:\n    $S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} \\psi_k^*(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\omega)$\n\n**4. Evaluate the Path Integral to Find $G_0(k, \\omega)$**\n\nThe path integral for $G_0$ becomes a product of independent Gaussian integrals for each mode $(k, \\omega)$. The Green's function in momentum-frequency space, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is the Fourier transform of $G_0(\\mathbf{r}t, \\mathbf{r}'t')$. It corresponds to the expectation value $\\langle \\psi_k(\\omega) \\psi_k^*(\\omega) \\rangle$.\n\n*   For Gaussian integrals over commuting (bosonic) or anti-commuting (fermionic) variables, the propagator is the inverse of the quadratic kernel in the action.\n*   The quadratic kernel in our action $S_0$ is the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n*   Therefore, the path integral evaluation directly yields:\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**5. Incorporate Causality (The $i\\eta$ Prescription)**\n\nThe expression above is not quite complete. The time-ordering operator $\\mathcal{T}$ in the original definition imposes specific causal boundary conditions. This means we must be careful about how to handle the pole at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$.\n\n*   Propagating forward in time (a particle added to an empty state) and propagating backward in time (a hole created in an occupied state) are treated differently.\n*   This physical requirement is enforced mathematically by adding an infinitesimal imaginary part, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), to the denominator. The sign of this term depends on whether the state $k$ is occupied or unoccupied in the ground state.\n*   Let $\\mu$ be the chemical potential (Fermi energy at $T=0$).\n    *   If $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$ (unoccupied particle state), the pole is shifted into the lower half of the complex $\\omega$-plane: $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$.\n    *   If $\\epsilon_k < \\mu$ (occupied hole state), the pole is shifted into the upper half of the complex $\\omega$-plane: $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\eta}$.\n*   This can be written compactly as:\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Choice of Basis:** The functional dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is only made explicit by working in the energy eigenbasis where the free Hamiltonian $H_0$ is diagonal.\n2.  **Fourier Transformation:** The relationship is simplest in the momentum-frequency $(k, \\omega)$ domain. In real space-time, the relationship is convoluted and not a simple algebraic one.\n3.  **Meaning of $k$ and $\\epsilon_k$:** For a free particle in space, $k$ is the momentum and $\\epsilon_k = k^2/2m$. In a crystal, $k$ is the crystal momentum and $\\epsilon_k$ is the band energy. The formalism is general.\n4.  **Causality is Crucial:** Forgetting the $i\\eta$ term misses a fundamental aspect of the Green's function. The time-ordering in the definition is what introduces this feature, ensuring that particles propagate forward in time and holes (absence of particles) propagate backward.\n5.  **Path Integral as a Tool:** The path integral provides a direct route to the answer by showing that the propagator is the inverse of the operator in the quadratic action.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that the free action $S_0$ contains a term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ for each mode. The path integral for the Green's function effectively inverts this term. After accounting for causality, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ in the frequency-momentum domain is an inverse relationship, with the pole located at the energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ as the inverse of their difference. Specifically, the relationship is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nHere, $\\omega$ is the frequency, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $i\\eta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality. The core functional dependence is that $G_0$ has a simple pole at a complex frequency whose real part is the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
