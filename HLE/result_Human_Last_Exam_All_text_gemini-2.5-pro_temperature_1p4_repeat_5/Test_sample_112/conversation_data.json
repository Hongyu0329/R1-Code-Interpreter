    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal\".\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the correct \"Sir Launfal\":** The first crucial point is to understand which \"Sir Launfal\" the question refers to. There are two famous literary works with this title.\n    *   One is \"The Vision of Sir Launfal,\" a poem by the 19th-century American author James Russell Lowell. As a modern printed work, it would not be \"preserved\" in a manuscript alongside an old book of manners.\n    *   The other is \"Sir Launfal,\" a Middle English romance written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century. The term \"preserved alongside\" strongly suggests a medieval manuscript context, making this the correct work to consider.\n\n2.  **Locate the manuscript:** The poem \"Sir Launfal\" by Thomas Chestre survives in only one manuscript. This manuscript is known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**. It is a famous and important collection of Middle English texts, compiled in the mid-15th century.\n\n3.  **Examine the contents of the manuscript:** The Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is an anthology, meaning it contains several different works bound together. Besides \"Sir Launfal,\" it includes other notable romances such as *Sir Orfeo*, *Sir Degaré*, *Emaré*, and *Sir Isumbras*, as well as the famous debate poem *The Owl and the Nightingale*.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"book of manners\":** The question asks for a \"book of manners,\" which is a type of instructional text on etiquette, courtesy, and proper behavior. We must search the list of contents for Cotton Caligula A.ii to find such a work.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the specific text:** Within the diverse collection of romances and poems in the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript, there is indeed a text that fits the description of a book of manners. This text is explicitly titled **\"The Book of Curtesye\"** (also spelled \"The Book of Courtesy\"). This work provides instruction on proper conduct for a young man in a noble household.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy tracing the medieval poem \"Sir Launfal\" to its unique manuscript source, Cotton Caligula A.ii, and then examining the other texts within that same manuscript, we can identify the specific book of manners it was preserved with.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Book of Curtesye>>>"
