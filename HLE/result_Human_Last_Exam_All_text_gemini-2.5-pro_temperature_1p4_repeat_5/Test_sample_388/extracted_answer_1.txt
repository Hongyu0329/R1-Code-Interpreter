The pharmacist should counsel Allison on the increased risk of bleeding when taking Fluoxetine (an SSRI) with an NSAID like the aspirin found in Excedrin. The pharmacist could recommend using acetaminophen (Tylenol) alone for future headaches, as it does not carry the same bleeding risk when combined with Fluoxetine. Additionally, the pharmacist could mention that headaches can be a side effect of both Fluoxetine and Junel Fe, and she should monitor them and follow up with her doctor if they persist or worsen.
