    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the MLB Batting Triple Crown\nThe Triple Crown for a hitter in Major League Baseball is awarded to a player who leads their respective league (American League or National League) in three specific statistical categories in a single season:\n1.  **Batting Average (AVG)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: Identify and List All Triple Crown Winners\nTo find the total number of winners, we must list every player who has accomplished this feat. It's important to note that while two players have won it twice, the question asks for the number of *winners* (unique individuals), not the number of times it has been won. The list below includes players from the American League (AL), the National League (NL), and the American Association (AA), which is recognized by MLB as a major league.\n\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878, NL, Providence Grays)\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887, AA, St. Louis Browns)\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894, NL, Boston Beaneaters)\n4.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901, AL, Philadelphia Athletics)\n5.  **Ty Cobb** (1909, AL, Detroit Tigers)\n6.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922 & 1925, NL, St. Louis Cardinals)\n7.  **Chuck Klein** (1933, NL, Philadelphia Phillies)\n8.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, AL, Philadelphia Athletics)\n9.  **Lou Gehrig** (1934, AL, New York Yankees)\n10. **Joe Medwick** (1937, NL, St. Louis Cardinals)\n11. **Ted Williams** (1942 & 1947, AL, Boston Red Sox)\n12. **Mickey Mantle** (1956, AL, New York Yankees)\n13. **Frank Robinson** (1966, AL, Baltimore Orioles)\n14. **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, AL, Boston Red Sox)\n15. **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, AL, Detroit Tigers)\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the List and Address Careful Points\n\n*   **Batting vs. Pitching:** The question does not specify, but the \"Triple Crown\" in baseball context almost always refers to the more famous batting achievement. The pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA) is a separate accomplishment. This analysis is for the batting Triple Crown.\n*   **Counting Unique Winners:** Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won the Triple Crown twice. Since the question asks \"how many winners,\" we count each of them only once as a unique winner.\n*   **Historical Accuracy:** The RBI (Runs Batted In) statistic was not officially tracked until 1920. The RBI totals for the winners before this date (Hines, O'Neill, Duffy, Lajoie, Cobb) have been determined retroactively by baseball historians and are recognized by MLB.\n*   **League Inclusions:** The list includes winners from the American League, the National League, and the American Association. These are the leagues typically included in official MLB historical records for this achievement.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nBy counting each unique name on the list from Step 2, we arrive at the final number. There are 15 distinct players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<15>>>"
