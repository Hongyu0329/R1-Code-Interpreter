    "This problem asks for the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph under a randomized uniform gossiping model. Let's break down the problem into clear steps.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Barbell Graph Structure**\n\n*   A barbell graph is typically constructed by joining two dense components (cliques) with a sparse connection (a path or a single edge).\n*   Given 10 nodes and the term \"the bottleneck edge\" (singular), the most standard interpretation is a graph formed by two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge.\n*   Let's denote the two cliques as $C_1$ and $C_2$. Both are complete graphs on 5 vertices, i.e., $K_5$.\n*   A single edge, let's call it $e_b$, connects one node from $C_1$ to one node from $C_2$. This edge $e_b$ is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n*   Let $u_b$ be the node in $C_1$ connected to the bottleneck edge, and $v_b$ be the node in $C_2$ connected to it. So, $e_b = (u_b, v_b)$.\n*   The total number of nodes is $N = 5 (\\text{in } C_1) + 5 (\\text{in } C_2) = 10$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Degree of Each Node**\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. This is crucial for calculating sampling probabilities.\n\n*   **Nodes not on the bottleneck edge:** Consider a node $u$ in clique $C_1$ such that $u \\neq u_b$. Since $C_1$ is a complete graph ($K_5$), this node is connected to the other 4 nodes within $C_1$. It has no other connections.\n    *   The degree of such a node is $\\text{deg}(u) = 4$.\n    *   There are 4 such nodes in $C_1$ and 4 in $C_2$, for a total of 8 nodes with degree 4.\n*   **Nodes on the bottleneck edge:** Consider the node $u_b$ in $C_1$. It is connected to the other 4 nodes within its clique $C_1$. Additionally, it is connected to node $v_b$ via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   The degree of $u_b$ is $\\text{deg}(u_b) = 4 (\\text{internal}) + 1 (\\text{bottleneck}) = 5$.\n    *   Similarly, the degree of $v_b$ in $C_2$ is $\\text{deg}(v_b) = 4 (\\text{internal}) + 1 (\\text{bottleneck}) = 5$.\n    *   There are 2 such nodes ($u_b$ and $v_b$) with degree 5.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Randomized Uniform Gossiping Process**\n\nThe problem specifies \"randomized uniform gossiping\". This process for sampling an edge typically involves two stages:\n\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from the set of all $N$ nodes. The probability of selecting any specific node $u$ is $1/N$.\n2.  The selected node $u$ then chooses one of its neighbors, $v$, uniformly at random to communicate with. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor $v$ is $1/\\text{deg}(u)$.\n\nThe \"sampling of an edge\" corresponds to this communication event. The phrase \"uniform weights\" confirms that each neighbor has an equal chance of being chosen.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**\n\nThe bottleneck edge $e_b = (u_b, v_b)$ is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events occurs in a single step:\n\n*   **Event A:** Node $u_b$ is selected, and it chooses to gossip with node $v_b$.\n*   **Event B:** Node $v_b$ is selected, and it chooses to gossip with node $u_b$.\n\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events: $P(\\text{sample } e_b) = P(A) + P(B)$.\n\n*   **Calculating P(A):**\n    *   The probability of selecting node $u_b$ is $P(\\text{pick } u_b) = 1/N = 1/10$.\n    *   Given $u_b$ is selected, the probability it chooses $v_b$ from its neighbors is $P(u_b \\to v_b) = 1/\\text{deg}(u_b) = 1/5$.\n    *   Therefore, $P(A) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n*   **Calculating P(B):**\n    *   The probability of selecting node $v_b$ is $P(\\text{pick } v_b) = 1/N = 1/10$.\n    *   Given $v_b$ is selected, the probability it chooses $u_b$ from its neighbors is $P(v_b \\to u_b) = 1/\\text{deg}(v_b) = 1/5$.\n    *   Therefore, $P(B) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    *   $P(\\text{sample } e_b) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nSimplifying the resulting fraction gives the final probability.\n\n*   $P(\\text{sample } e_b) = 2/50 = 1/25$.\n\nAs a decimal, this is $0.04$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Graph Interpretation:** Correctly interpreting \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" as two $K_5$ cliques joined by one edge is the most critical assumption. The phrase \"the bottleneck edge\" strongly supports this singular connection model.\n*   **Gossiping Model:** The node-centric sampling model (pick a node, then a neighbor) is standard for \"gossiping\". An alternative model like picking an edge uniformly from all edges would yield a different result ($1/21$) but is less representative of how gossip protocols work.\n*   **Node Degrees:** The calculation hinges entirely on the correct determination of node degrees. The nodes connected to the bottleneck are the highest-degree nodes in the graph, which makes the bottleneck edge less likely to be traversed in this specific sampling model compared to other edges.\n\nFinal calculation is robust based on these standard interpretations.\n\n$1/25$\n<<<1/25>>>"
