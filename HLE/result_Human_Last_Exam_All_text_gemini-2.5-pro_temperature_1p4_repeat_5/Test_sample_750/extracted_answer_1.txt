The solutions for $z \in \mathbb{C}$ to the equation $z\cdot i=i^z$ are given by:

1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.
2.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions:
    $z_k = \frac{i}{\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi} W_0\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi\right)\right)$ for every negative integer $k \in \{-1, -2, -3, \dots\}$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.
3.  A doubly-infinite set of other complex solutions given by the general formula:
    $z_{k,j} = \frac{i}{\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi} W_j\left(-\left(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi\right)\right)$ for all pairs of integers $(k, j)$ not covered by the cases above.
