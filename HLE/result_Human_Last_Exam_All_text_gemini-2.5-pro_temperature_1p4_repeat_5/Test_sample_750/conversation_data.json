    "An elegant way to solve this equation is to use the Lambert W function. Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Rewrite the equation using the definition of complex exponentiation.**\nThe given equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\nThe term $i^z$ with a complex base and exponent is defined as $i^z = e^{z \\log(i)}$.\nSo the equation becomes $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\log(i)}$.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the multi-valued complex logarithm $\\log(i)$.**\nThe complex logarithm $\\log(w)$ for a complex number $w = |w|e^{i\\theta}$ is given by $\\log(w) = \\ln|w| + i(\\theta + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\nFor $w=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument is $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nSo, $\\log(i) = \\ln(1) + i\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right) = i\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's denote $\\alpha_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. The equation depends on the choice of the integer $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Transform the equation into a solvable form.**\nSubstituting $\\log(i) = i\\alpha_k$ into the equation from Step 1, we get:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z(i\\alpha_k)} = e^{(zi)\\alpha_k}$.\nLet's introduce a new variable $w = z \\cdot i$. The equation transforms into a simpler form:\n$w = e^{\\alpha_k w}$.\n\n**Step 4: Solve for $w$ using the Lambert W function.**\nThe equation $w = e^{\\alpha_k w}$ is a classic form that can be solved using the Lambert W function, which is defined as the inverse function of $f(u) = ue^u$. That is, if $u = W(v)$, then $v=ue^u$.\nTo put our equation into this form, we rearrange it:\n$1 = \\frac{e^{\\alpha_k w}}{w} = w^{-1} e^{\\alpha_k w}$.\n$w e^{-\\alpha_k w} = 1$.\nTo match the form $ue^u=v$, we multiply by $-\\alpha_k$:\n$(-\\alpha_k w) e^{-\\alpha_k w} = -\\alpha_k$.\nLet $u = -\\alpha_k w$. The equation is now $ue^u = -\\alpha_k$.\nThe solution for $u$ is $u = W(-\\alpha_k)$.\n\nSince the Lambert W function is multi-valued for a complex argument, we denote its different branches by $W_j$, where $j$ is an integer ($j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$).\nSo, the complete set of solutions for $u$ is $u = W_j(-\\alpha_k)$ for any integer $j$.\n\n**Step 5: Solve for $z$.**\nFrom $u = -\\alpha_k w$, we have $w = -\\frac{u}{\\alpha_k} = -\\frac{W_j(-\\alpha_k)}{\\alpha_k}$.\nSince we defined $w = z \\cdot i$, we can find $z$ by $z = \\frac{w}{i} = -iw$.\n$z = -i \\left(-\\frac{W_j(-\\alpha_k)}{\\alpha_k}\\right) = \\frac{i}{\\alpha_k} W_j(-\\alpha_k)$.\n\nSubstituting $\\alpha_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, the general solution for $z$ is:\n$z_{k,j} = \\frac{i}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi} W_j\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$ for all integers $k, j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 6: Identify specific families of solutions.**\nThis general formula contains all solutions. We can analyze it to find specific, simpler classes of solutions.\n\n**A. Real Solutions ($z \\in \\mathbb{R}$)**\nWe found two simple real solutions by inspection:\n1.  **$z=1$**: $1 \\cdot i = i^1 \\implies i=i$. This is a valid solution.\n2.  **$z=-1$**: $(-1) \\cdot i = i^{-1} \\implies -i = \\frac{1}{i} = -i$. This is also a valid solution.\n\nIn our general formula, these correspond to specific pairs of $(k,j)$:\n-   $z=1$ is obtained for any integer $k$ by choosing the branch $j=-k$.\n-   $z=-1$ is obtained for any integer $k$ by choosing the branch $j=k$.\n\n**B. Purely Imaginary Solutions ($z \\in i\\mathbb{R}$)**\nFor $z$ to be purely imaginary, $z=iy$ for some real number $y$. This requires the term $\\frac{i}{\\alpha_k}W_j(-\\alpha_k)$ to be purely imaginary. This implies that $W_j(-\\alpha_k)$ must be a real number.\nThe Lambert W function $W_j(x)$ produces a real value only if the argument $x$ is real and $x \\ge -1/e$.\nThe argument of our W function is $-\\alpha_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$. This is real.\nWe need $-\\alpha_k \\ge -1/e$, which means $\\alpha_k \\le 1/e$.\n$\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi \\le \\frac{1}{e}$.\n$\\pi(1/2 + 2k) \\le 1/e \\approx 0.367$.\n$1/2 + 2k \\le \\frac{1}{e\\pi} \\approx \\frac{1}{2.718 \\times 3.141} \\approx 0.117$.\n$2k \\le 0.117 - 0.5 = -0.383$.\n$k \\le -0.1915$.\nSince $k$ must be an integer, this condition holds for all integers $k < 0$ (i.e., $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$).\n\nWhen $k<0$, the argument $-\\alpha_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)$ is positive. For a positive argument, only the principal branch $j=0$ (i.e., $W_0$) gives a real value.\nThus, for each integer $k<0$, we get a unique purely imaginary solution:\n$z_k = \\frac{i}{\\alpha_k} W_0(-\\alpha_k) = \\frac{i}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi} W_0\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$.\n\n**C. Other Complex Solutions**\nFor all other pairs of integers $(k, j)$, the formula yields complex solutions where both the real and imaginary parts are non-zero. For example, for $(k,j)=(0,0)$, we get $z_{0,0} = \\frac{i}{\\pi/2}W_0(-\\pi/2) \\approx 1.165 + 0.258i$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Multi-valued Logarithm**: The expression $i^z$ is inherently multi-valued because the complex logarithm is. Each choice of the integer $k$ in $\\log(i)$ defines a different \"version\" of the equation.\n2.  **Multi-valued Lambert W Function**: Solving the resulting equation $w=e^{cw}$ requires the Lambert W function, which is also multi-valued. Each branch, indexed by integer $j$, yields a distinct solution for a given $k$.\n3.  **Complete Solution Set**: The full solution set is a doubly-infinite set indexed by the integers $k$ and $j$. The specific solutions (real, purely imaginary) are special cases within this set.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ to the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ are given by:\n\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions:\n    $z_k = \\frac{i}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi} W_0\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$ for every negative integer $k \\in \\{-1, -2, -3, \\dots\\}$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n3.  A doubly-infinite set of other complex solutions given by the general formula:\n    $z_{k,j} = \\frac{i}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi} W_j\\left(-\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)\\right)$ for all pairs of integers $(k, j)$ not covered by the cases above."
