    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question regarding the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Components of the Question:**\n    *   **Drug Container:** Single-dose container ampule.\n    *   **Action:** Punctured (or snapped open).\n    *   **Environment:** Sterile environment (implying it is handled using aseptic technique, likely within an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control like a sterile hood).\n    *   **Question:** What is the Beyond-Use Date (BUD)?\n\n2.  **Define the Terms:**\n    *   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** The date or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) shall not be stored or transported. It is determined from the time the preparation is compounded or the container is entered.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container:** A container intended for a single use. It holds a quantity of sterile medication intended for parenteral administration. Crucially, single-dose containers typically lack antimicrobial preservatives.\n    *   **Ampule:** A sealed glass container with a neck designed to be snapped off. Once opened, it becomes an open-system container and **cannot be resealed**.\n\n3.  **Consult Governing Standards:**\n    *   The primary source for sterile compounding standards in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically **USP General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations**. These standards are designed to prevent patient harm from microbial contamination, excessive bacterial endotoxins, and other potential quality issues.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Specific Case of an Ampule:**\n    *   According to USP <797>, once an ampule is opened, it is considered an open system. The contents are directly exposed to the surrounding environment.\n    *   Unlike a vial with a rubber stopper that can self-seal after a needle puncture, an ampule has no such barrier once broken.\n    *   Because it cannot be resealed to protect against contamination, the risk of microbial ingress is very high.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Distinguish Between Ampules and Vials:** This is the most critical point of potential confusion. USP <797> has different rules for single-dose vials versus single-dose ampules.\n    *   **Single-Dose Vial:** If entered in an ISO Class 5 environment, it can be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture.\n    *   **Single-Dose Ampule:** This rule **does not** apply to ampules.\n2.  **The \"Sterile Environment\" Doesn't Grant Storage Time for Ampules:** While opening the ampule in a sterile environment (like a laminar airflow hood) is the correct and required procedure to minimize contamination during the drawing-up process, it does not change the fact that the ampule is now an open system. It does not confer a BUD that allows for storage.\n3.  **Definition of \"Immediate Use\":** For an ampule, the contents must be used immediately. This means the medication should be withdrawn and then promptly administered or added to another sterile preparation (like an IV bag) without any delay or storage of the opened ampule itself. Any unused portion in the ampule must be discarded immediately and cannot be saved for later.\n4.  **No Preservatives:** The fundamental reason for these strict rules is that single-dose containers do not contain antimicrobial preservatives to inhibit microbial growth if contamination were to occur.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nGiven that an ampule is a single-dose, open-system container that cannot be resealed, the guidelines are absolute. To ensure patient safety and prevent microbial contamination, the contents must be used immediately after the ampule is opened. There is no permissible storage time for an opened ampule, regardless of the environment in which it was opened.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:** The BUD for a single-dose ampule once opened is **immediate use**. Any remaining contents must be discarded and not stored for any period.\n\n<<<The contents must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded. There is no storage time allowed."
