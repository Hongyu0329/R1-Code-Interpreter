    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Clues:**\n    *   **Profession:** The individual is a physicist.\n    *   **Primary Field of Fame:** They are \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\"\n    *   **Discovery:** They discovered an \"optical effect in real imagery.\"\n    *   **Origin Story:** The discovery was prompted by an effect that was \"accidentally observed by a custodial worker.\"\n    *   **Equipment Involved:** The observation involved the worker \"cleaning concave mirrors.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Anecdote (The Accidental Observation):**\n    *   The story of a worker cleaning a large concave mirror and noticing strange optical phenomena (like streaks or shadows in the air) is a famous anecdote in the history of optics.\n    *   These \"streaks\" are visualizations of variations in the refractive index of the air, caused by temperature differences or solvent fumes from the cleaning process. Objects that are transparent but alter the phase of light passing through them are called \"phase objects.\"\n    *   This specific observation is most directly linked to the development of the **Schlieren method** (or Schlieren photography).\n\n3.  **Identify the Scientist Associated with the Initial Effect:**\n    *   The scientist who first formally investigated this effect and developed the Schlieren method in the 1860s was **August Toepler**. He heard the story and devised a system using a lens, a concave mirror, and a knife-edge to visualize these phase objects.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While Toepler fits the discovery anecdote perfectly, the question specifies the physicist must be \"better known for work in the **microscopy** field.\" August Toepler is primarily known for his work in acoustics and fluid dynamics imaging (Schlieren photography), not microscopy. This means he is likely not the final answer, but a crucial link.\n\n4.  **Connect the Initial Effect to a Microscopy Expert:**\n    *   The question states the physicist discovered an optical effect *after* the accidental observation. This implies we are looking for a subsequent discovery that built upon the principles of the first one.\n    *   The physical principle behind the Schlieren method (visualizing phase objects) was later adapted and significantly refined for use in microscopy.\n    *   We must look for a physicist famous for inventing a microscopy technique based on visualizing phase objects.\n\n5.  **Identify the Correct Physicist:**\n    *   The Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike** studied the imperfections in diffraction gratings using a method similar to Toepler's Schlieren setup.\n    *   In the 1930s, Zernike had a profound insight: he realized that the same principle could be mathematically refined and applied on a microscopic scale. He developed a method to convert the tiny, invisible phase shifts that light undergoes when passing through a transparent specimen (like a living cell) into visible changes in brightness (amplitude).\n    *   This invention was the **phase-contrast microscope**.\n    *   For this groundbreaking work, which revolutionized biology by allowing scientists to study living cells without staining and killing them, Frits Zernike was awarded the **Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   The accidental observation by a custodial worker with a concave mirror led to the **Schlieren effect**, first formalized by August Toepler.\n*   **Frits Zernike**, a physicist famous for his work in microscopy, then built upon the principles of the Schlieren method to invent the **phase-contrast microscope**.\n*   Therefore, Frits Zernike is the physicist who is famous for microscopy and who discovered a related optical effect (phase contrast) *after* the initial accidental observation described in the question. He perfectly fits all the criteria.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
