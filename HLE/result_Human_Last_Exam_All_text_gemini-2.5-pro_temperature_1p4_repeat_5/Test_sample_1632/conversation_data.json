    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(10).\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is the standard two-dimensional square grid, where points have integer coordinates (x, y). From any point, one can move to one of its four immediate neighbors: up, down, left, or right.\n*   **n-step walk:** A sequence of `n` moves on the lattice, starting from an origin point, say (0,0). The walk is a sequence of `n+1` points `p_0, p_1, ..., p_n` where `p_0 = (0,0)` and each `p_{i+1}` is a neighbor of `p_i`.\n*   **Self-avoiding walk (SAW):** A walk in which all the points `p_0, p_1, ..., p_n` are distinct. In other words, the path does not visit the same grid point more than once.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from a fixed origin.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis for Small Values of n**\n\nWe can compute the first few values of a(n) by hand to understand the problem better. Due to the symmetry of the lattice, we can calculate the number of walks that start with a specific first move (e.g., to the right) and then multiply the result by 4.\n\n*   **n = 1:**\n    *   From the origin (0,0), there are 4 possible moves: to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1).\n    *   All these are valid 1-step SAWs.\n    *   Therefore, `a(1) = 4`.\n\n*   **n = 2:**\n    *   Let's consider a walk starting with the move (0,0) -> (1,0).\n    *   From the second point (1,0), we cannot move back to (0,0).\n    *   The available moves are to (2,0), (1,1), and (1,-1). There are 3 choices.\n    *   Since there were 4 choices for the first step, and each leads to 3 choices for the second, the total number of walks is `4 * 3 = 12`.\n    *   Therefore, `a(2) = 12`.\n\n*   **n = 3:**\n    *   Let's continue from the 2-step walks.\n    *   For a path like (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0), the third move from (2,0) has 3 valid options: (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1).\n    *   For a path like (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1), the third move from (1,1) has 3 valid options: (2,1), (1,2), (0,1).\n    *   In all cases for n=3, the third step has 3 valid options because the path has not yet had a chance to loop back on itself.\n    *   The total number of walks is `4 * 3 * 3 = 36`.\n    *   Therefore, `a(3) = 36`.\n\n*   **n = 4:**\n    *   This is the first case where a path can get \"trapped\".\n    *   Let's count the number of 4-step walks starting with (0,0) -> (1,0).\n    *   Walks starting (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0): The third move from (2,0) can go to (3,0), (2,1), or (2,-1). From any of those points, the fourth move will have 3 valid options. So `1 * 3 * 3 = 9` walks of this type.\n    *   Walks starting (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1): The third move from (1,1) can go to (2,1), (1,2), or (0,1).\n        *   If the third point is (2,1), the fourth move has 3 options.\n        *   If the third point is (1,2), the fourth move has 3 options.\n        *   If the third point is (0,1), the path is (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1). The next move from (0,1) cannot be to (1,1) or (0,0). So there are only 2 valid options: (-1,1) and (0,2).\n        *   Total walks of this type: `3 + 3 + 2 = 8`.\n    *   Walks starting (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,-1): By symmetry, this is the same as the case above, so there are 8 walks.\n    *   The total number of 4-step walks starting with a move to the right is `9 + 8 + 8 = 25`.\n    *   Multiplying by 4 for the initial directions, `a(4) = 4 * 25 = 100`.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Final Answer for a(10)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Computational Complexity:** As `n` increases, the number of paths to check grows exponentially, and the number of self-intersections to account for becomes very large. A manual calculation for `n=10` is not feasible and would be extremely prone to errors.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Established Problem:** This is a famous problem in combinatorics and statistical physics. The exact number of n-step SAWs is not known by a simple formula. The values have been computed and tabulated using sophisticated computer algorithms (like backtracking or transfer-matrix methods).\n*   **Careful Point 3: Using Known Results:** The sequence a(n) is well-documented. It is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. We can refer to this established result to find the value for `n=10`.\n\nThe sequence begins:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   **a(10) = 44100**\n\nBased on these established computational results, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
