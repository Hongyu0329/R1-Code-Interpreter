    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Attacking Rules\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid, where rows and columns are indexed from 0 to 4. The \"toroidal\" nature means the board wraps around. For a cell (r, c), the neighbor to the right of (r, 4) is (r, 0), and the neighbor below (4, c) is (0, c).\n*   **Queen Attacks:** A queen at (r, c) attacks any cell (r', c') if they are on the same:\n    1.  **Row:** `r' = r`\n    2.  **Column:** `c' = c`\n    3.  **Main Diagonal:** `r' - c' ≡ r - c (mod 5)`\n    4.  **Anti-Diagonal:** `r' + c' ≡ r + c (mod 5)`\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Non-Attacking Conditions\n\nWe want to place 4 queens at positions (r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), and (r4, c4). For them to be non-attacking, the following four sets of values must each contain 4 distinct elements:\n1.  The set of row indices: `R = {r1, r2, r3, r4}`\n2.  The set of column indices: `C = {c1, c2, c3, c4}`\n3.  The set of main diagonal indices: `D = {r1-c1, r2-c2, r3-c3, r4-c4}` (mod 5)\n4.  The set of anti-diagonal indices: `S = {r1+c1, r2+c2, r3+c3, r4+c4}` (mod 5)\n\n### Step 3: Using a Combinatorial Constraint\n\nSince we are placing 4 queens on a 5x5 board, exactly one value will be missing from each of the four sets above. Let these missing values be `r_miss`, `c_miss`, `d_miss`, and `s_miss`.\nThe sum of all possible indices (0 to 4) is `0+1+2+3+4 = 10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`.\nTherefore, the sum of the 4 chosen indices in each set is the negative of the missing index (mod 5).\n*   `Σ r_i ≡ -r_miss (mod 5)`\n*   `Σ c_i ≡ -c_miss (mod 5)`\n*   `Σ d_i ≡ -d_miss (mod 5)`\n*   `Σ s_i ≡ -s_miss (mod 5)`\n\nFrom the definitions of `d_i` and `s_i`, we can sum over the 4 queens:\n*   `Σ d_i = Σ (r_i - c_i) = (Σ r_i) - (Σ c_i)`\n*   `Σ s_i = Σ (r_i + c_i) = (Σ r_i) + (Σ c_i)`\n\nSubstituting the sums with the missing indices:\n*   `-d_miss ≡ (-r_miss) - (-c_miss)  =>  d_miss ≡ r_miss - c_miss (mod 5)`\n*   `-s_miss ≡ (-r_miss) + (-c_miss)  =>  s_miss ≡ r_miss + c_miss (mod 5)`\n\nThese constraints show that the choices for the sets `R, C, D, S` are not independent. If we choose the set of rows (by picking `r_miss`) and the set of columns (by picking `c_miss`), the sets of diagonals `D` and `S` are determined.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Number of Valid Line Sets\n\nWe can freely choose the missing row `r_miss` in 5 ways and the missing column `c_miss` in 5 ways. Once these are chosen, `d_miss` and `s_miss` are fixed.\n*   Number of ways to choose `r_miss`: 5\n*   Number of ways to choose `c_miss`: 5\nThis gives `5 × 5 = 25` possible combinations of valid sets `{R, C, D, S}` that could be occupied by a solution.\n\n### Step 5: Reducing to a Canonical Problem\n\nAny valid placement of 4 queens can be transformed into a canonical problem. Let's pick a specific solution. It has a particular `r_miss` and `c_miss`. If we shift the entire solution by `(-r_miss, -c_miss)` (mod 5), the new positions will have `r'_miss = 0` and `c'_miss = 0`. Consequently, `d'_miss = 0` and `s'_miss = 0`.\n\nThis means the canonical problem is to find the number of ways, let's call it `K`, to place 4 queens such that:\n*   The rows are `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   The columns are `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   The main diagonals occupied are `{1, 2, 3, 4}` (mod 5).\n*   The anti-diagonals occupied are `{1, 2, 3, 4}` (mod 5).\n\nThe total number of solutions will be `25 × K`, since each of the `K` canonical solutions can be translated to `24` other unique positions on the board corresponding to the other choices of `(r_miss, c_miss)`.\n\n### Step 6: Solving the Canonical Problem (Finding K)\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to arrange 4 queens on the subgrid defined by rows and columns `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. This is equivalent to finding a permutation `p` of `{1, 2, 3, 4}` that maps rows to columns, `(i, p(i))`, satisfying the diagonal constraints.\nThe positions are `(1, p(1)), (2, p(2)), (3, p(3)), (4, p(4))`.\nThe constraints are:\n1.  The set `{i - p(i) (mod 5) | i ∈ {1,2,3,4}}` must be `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n2.  The set `{i + p(i) (mod 5) | i ∈ {1,2,3,4}}` must be `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nThis implies that for all `i ∈ {1,2,3,4}`:\n*   `i - p(i) ≠ 0 (mod 5) => p(i) ≠ i`. The permutation must be a **derangement**.\n*   `i + p(i) ≠ 0 (mod 5) => p(i) ≠ 5-i`.\n\nLet's test all derangements of `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. There are 9 such permutations.\nThe condition `p(i) ≠ 5-i` means we must avoid the pairings `(1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)`.\n\nThe 9 derangements `p = (p(1), p(2), p(3), p(4))` are:\n1.  `(2,1,4,3)`: Fails condition `p(i) ≠ 5-i` because `p(2)=1` and we need `p(2)≠3`; `p(3)=4` and we need `p(3)≠2`. So it's okay. Let's check the main diagonal condition: `i-p(i)` gives `1-2=4`, `2-1=1`, `3-4=4`. The values are not distinct. Fails.\n2.  `(2,3,4,1)`: Fails `p(i) ≠ 5-i` because `p(2)=3`. Fails.\n3.  `(2,4,1,3)`: Passes `p(i) ≠ 5-i`.\n    *   `i - p(i)`: `1-2=4`, `2-4=3`, `3-1=2`, `4-3=1`. Set is `{1,2,3,4}`. OK.\n    *   `i + p(i)`: `1+2=3`, `2+4=1`, `3+1=4`, `4+3=2`. Set is `{1,2,3,4}`. OK.\n    *   This is a valid solution.\n4.  `(3,1,4,2)`: Passes `p(i) ≠ 5-i`.\n    *   `i - p(i)`: `1-3=3`, `2-1=1`, `3-4=4`, `4-2=2`. Set is `{1,2,3,4}`. OK.\n    *   `i + p(i)`: `1+3=4`, `2+1=3`, `3+4=2`, `4+2=1`. Set is `{1,2,3,4}`. OK.\n    *   This is a valid solution.\n5.  `(3,4,1,2)`: Passes `p(i) ≠ 5-i`. Let's check main diagonal: `1-3=3`, `2-4=3`. Not distinct. Fails.\n6.  `(3,4,2,1)`: Fails `p(i) ≠ 5-i` because `p(3)=2` and `p(4)=1`. Fails.\n7.  `(4,1,2,3)`: Fails `p(i) ≠ 5-i` because `p(3)=2`. Fails.\n8.  `(4,3,1,2)`: Fails `p(i) ≠ 5-i` because `p(1)=4` and `p(2)=3`. Fails.\n9.  `(4,3,2,1)`: Fails `p(i) ≠ 5-i` because `p(1)=4, p(2)=3, p(3)=2, p(4)=1`. Fails.\n\nBy systematically checking, we find exactly 2 permutations that work for the canonical problem. Therefore, `K = 2`.\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens is the number of valid line sets multiplied by the number of solutions for each set (which is `K`).\n\nTotal Ways = (Number of choices for `(r_miss, c_miss)`) × K\nTotal Ways = 25 × 2 = 50.\n\nThere are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
