    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Input Data\nWe are given a Calabi-Yau hypersurface defined by a polynomial equation in a weighted projective space.\n- **Polynomial Equation:** $F = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3 = 0$\n- **Weights of the ambient space $\\mathbb{P}^4$:** $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Degree of the Hypersurface and Verify Homogeneity\nA hypersurface in a weighted projective space must be defined by a weighted-homogeneous polynomial. Let's calculate the weighted degree of each monomial in `F`. The degree `d` of the polynomial should be consistent across all its terms.\n\n- `deg(z_1^8 z_3)` = $8 \\times w_1 + 1 \\times w_3 = 8 \\times 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n- `deg(z_1^4 z_2^3 z_3)` = $4 \\times w_1 + 3 \\times w_2 + 1 \\times w_3 = 4 \\times 22 + 3 \\times 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n- `deg(z_1 z_2^7)` = $1 \\times w_1 + 7 \\times w_2 = 1 \\times 22 + 7 \\times 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n- `deg(z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4 z_5)` = $w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5 = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$.\n- `deg(z_2 z_3^4)` = $1 \\times w_2 + 4 \\times w_3 = 29 + 4 \\times 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n- `deg(z_4^3 z_5)` = $3 \\times w_4 + 1 \\times w_5 = 3 \\times 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n- `deg(z_5^3)` = $3 \\times w_5 = 3 \\times 75 = 225$.\n\n**Careful Point:** We observe that one monomial, `z_1^4 z_2^3 z_3`, has a weight of 224, while all other six monomials have a weight of 225. This indicates a typographical error in the provided polynomial. For the object to be a well-defined hypersurface in the weighted projective space, the polynomial must be homogeneous. We will proceed by assuming the degree of the hypersurface is `d = 225`, as overwhelmingly suggested by the other terms. The specific polynomial is likely just one representative of a family of such hypersurfaces.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition\nA hypersurface $X_d$ in a weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, ..., w_5)$ is a Calabi-Yau manifold if its degree `d` equals the sum of the weights. This is the condition for the triviality of the first Chern class.\n- Degree `d = 225`.\n- Sum of weights $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\nSince $d = \\sum w_i$, the Calabi-Yau condition is satisfied.\n\n### Step 4: Define and Calculate the Crawley-Nordström Invariant\nFor a Calabi-Yau threefold `X` given as a hypersurface in a weighted projective 4-space, the Crawley-Nordström invariant `cn(X)` is defined as $cn(X) = h^{1,1}(X) - 1$. Here, $h^{1,1}(X)$ is a Hodge number, which topologically represents the rank of the Picard group of `X`. The `-1` accounts for the hyperplane class inherited from the ambient projective space. Therefore, `cn(X)` counts the number of \"extra\" divisors on `X` that do not come from the ambient space. These extra divisors arise from special geometric features of the Calabi-Yau family, which in turn are signaled by specific arithmetic relationships between the degree `d` and the weights `W`.\n\nWe look for these arithmetic conditions:\n\n1.  **K3-fibration condition:** Count the number of pairs of weights $(w_i, w_j)$ such that the least common multiple, `lcm(w_i, w_j)`, divides the degree `d`. This would indicate the Calabi-Yau can be fibered by K3 surfaces.\n    - We test the pair $(w_4, w_5) = (50, 75)$: `lcm(50, 75) = 150`. Does 150 divide 225? No ($225/150 = 1.5$).\n    - Any other pair will result in a much larger `lcm`, so none will divide 225.\n    - **Contribution from this rule: 0.**\n\n2.  **Elliptic-fibration condition:** Count the number of individual weights $w_i$ that divide the degree `d`. This indicates that the Calabi-Yau can be fibered by elliptic curves (curves of genus one).\n    - `d = 225`.\n    - $w_1 = 22$: 22 does not divide 225.\n    - $w_2 = 29$: 29 does not divide 225.\n    - $w_3 = 49$: 49 does not divide 225.\n    - $w_4 = 50$: 50 does not divide 225.\n    - $w_5 = 75$: 75 divides 225, since $225 = 3 \\times 75$.\n    - **Contribution from this rule: 1.**\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is the sum of these contributions.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Acquisition\nThe total count of special geometric structures contributing to `h^{1,1}(X)` beyond the basic value of 1 is the sum of the contributions found.\n- Contribution from K3-type fibrations: 0\n- Contribution from elliptic-type fibrations: 1\nTotal contribution to `cn` = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nThis means that $h^{1,1}(X) = 1 + cn(X) = 1 + 1 = 2$. The Crawley-Nordström invariant itself is the count of these extra structures."
