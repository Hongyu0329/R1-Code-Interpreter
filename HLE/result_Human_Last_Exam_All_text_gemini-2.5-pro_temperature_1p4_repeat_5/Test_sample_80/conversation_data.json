    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and Edge Squares**\n*   A standard chessboard is an 8x8 grid, containing 64 squares.\n*   The \"edge squares\" are those on the perimeter of the board: the first rank (row 1), the eighth rank (row 8), the 'a' file (column 1), and the 'h' file (column 8).\n*   To count the number of edge squares, we can sum the squares on all four sides and subtract the corners that were counted twice: (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28. Alternatively, it's 8 on the top row, 8 on the bottom row, and 6 on each side (excluding the already-counted corners): 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28.\n*   So, there are a total of 28 edge squares available for placing bishops.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Bishop's Constraint**\n*   The goal is to place the maximum number of bishops so that no two bishops can attack each other.\n*   Bishops attack along diagonals.\n*   A crucial property of bishops is that they always stay on the same color square. A bishop on a white square can only attack other bishops on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack other bishops on black squares.\n*   This means we can solve the problem for the white edge squares and the black edge squares independently and then add the results together.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Placement on White Edge Squares**\n*   Of the 28 edge squares, exactly half are white and half are black. So there are 14 white edge squares.\n*   The white edge squares are: b1, d1, f1, h1, a2, a4, a6, a8, c8, e8, g8, h3, h5, h7.\n*   We need to find the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these 14 squares without any of them attacking each other.\n*   Let's analyze the diagonals. The diagonals of a given color are parallel. For the white squares, the main diagonal runs from a8 to h1. Any bishop placed on a8 would attack a bishop placed on h1. So, from this pair of squares, we can only place one bishop.\n*   Similarly, the squares c8 and h3 lie on the same diagonal, as do e8 and h5, g8 and h7, f1 and a6, d1 and a4, and b1 and a2.\n*   This gives us 7 pairs of squares where each pair shares a diagonal: {a8, h1}, {c8, h3}, {e8, h5}, {g8, h7}, {f1, a6}, {d1, a4}, {b1, a2}.\n*   From each pair, we can select at most one square to place a bishop. This means the maximum number of bishops we can place on the white edge squares is 7. We can choose one from each pair (e.g., a8, c8, e8, g8, f1, d1, b1) such that they do not attack each other on the other diagonal direction.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Placement on Black Edge Squares**\n*   There are also 14 black edge squares.\n*   The black edge squares are: a1, c1, e1, g1, a3, a5, a7, b8, d8, f8, h8, h2, h4, h6.\n*   We apply the same logic. Let's find pairs of black edge squares that lie on the same diagonal.\n*   The main black diagonal runs from a1 to h8. A bishop on a1 attacks a bishop on h8.\n*   We can find 7 such pairs that share a diagonal: {a1, h8}, {c1, h6}, {e1, h4}, {g1, h2}, {a3, f8}, {a5, d8}, {a7, b8}.\n*   From each of these 7 pairs, we can place at most one bishop. Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the black edge squares is 7.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Maximum Number of Bishops**\n*   Maximum bishops on white edge squares = 7.\n*   Maximum bishops on black edge squares = 7.\n*   Since bishops on white squares do not attack bishops on black squares, the total maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is the sum of the two: 7 + 7 = 14.\n\n**Step 6: Answer the Final Question**\n*   The question asks: \"how many edge squares would lack bishops?\"\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Maximum number of bishops placed = 14.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = (Total edge squares) - (Number of bishops placed).\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
