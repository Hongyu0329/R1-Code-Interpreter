    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the precise location of the prophets' names in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the starting and ending verse numbers (*bayt*) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that exclusively list the names of the prophets mentioned in the Qur'an.\n\n2.  **Contextualize the Section:** The poem first establishes the obligation to believe in the messengers of Allah. It then specifies that while there are many prophets, it is obligatory to know the names of the 25 mentioned in the Qur'an. This is stated in the verse immediately preceding the list.\n\n3.  **Identify the Introductory Verse (Careful Point 1):** We must distinguish the verse that *introduces* the list from the verses that *contain* the list. Bayt 28 serves this introductory purpose:\n    *   **Bayt 28:** `تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ * كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ`\n    *   **Translation:** \"The details of twenty-five are binding upon every legally responsible person, so ascertain and take this opportunity.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse sets up the list but does not name any prophet. Therefore, the list does not start here.\n\n4.  **Identify the Starting Verse:** The enumeration of names begins in the very next verse.\n    *   **Bayt 29:** `هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ * صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ`\n    *   **Translation:** \"They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih, and Ibrahim - each one is to be followed.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is clearly the beginning of the list. Prophets mentioned: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim.\n\n5.  **Trace the Continuation of the List:** The list continues sequentially in the following verses.\n    *   **Bayt 30:** `لُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا * يَعْقُوبُ يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى`\n    *   **Analysis:** The list continues with Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n\n    *   **Bayt 31:** `شُعَيْبُ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ * ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ`\n    *   **Analysis:** The list continues with Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n6.  **Identify the Concluding Verse (Careful Point 2):** We must find the exact verse where the last of the 25 prophets are named.\n    *   **Bayt 32:** `إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا`\n    *   **Translation:** \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a title for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the Seal, so leave misguidance.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse concludes the list of 25 prophets, ending with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, referred to as Taha and the Seal (*Khaatim*). This is the final verse containing the names.\n\n7.  **Identify the Verse After the List (Careful Point 3):** To confirm the end point, we examine the next verse.\n    *   **Bayt 33:** `عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ * وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ`\n    *   **Translation:** \"Upon them be prayers and peace, and upon their families, as long as the days endure.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse is a supplication for the prophets just mentioned. It does not name any of them and comes after the list is completed. This confirms that Bayt 32 was indeed the end of the list.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the list of the prophets' names begins at Bayt 29 and concludes at Bayt 32.\n\n<<<From Bayt 29 to Bayt 32.>>>"
