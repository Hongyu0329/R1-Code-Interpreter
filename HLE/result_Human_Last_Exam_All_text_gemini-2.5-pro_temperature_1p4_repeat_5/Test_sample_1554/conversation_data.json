    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific philosophical concept.\n    *   **Concept:** The decomposition of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n    *   **Context:** The philosopher must belong to the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\n2.  **Define the Key Terms:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period (roughly 1918-1939). Its founder was Kazimierz Twardowski, and its prominent members included Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   **Hallmark (Polish: *oznaka*):** This is a general term for a sign, an indicator, or a mark. It refers to an object, state, or event that points to another object, state, or event.\n    *   **Symptom (Polish: *symptom*):** This is a type of hallmark or sign that is naturally connected to what it signifies, often through a causal relationship. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a high body temperature is a symptom of an illness.\n    *   **Signal (Polish: *sygnał*):** This is a type of hallmark or sign whose meaning is established by convention, rule, or agreement. The connection is artificial or arbitrary, not natural. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; a word is a signal for the concept it represents.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Candidates:**\n    The question narrows the search to philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School. The most likely candidates to have worked on such semiotic or epistemological distinctions are those focused on the philosophy of language and knowledge. This points strongly towards:\n    *   Tadeusz Kotarbiński\n    *   Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\n\n4.  **Investigate the Candidates' Work:**\n    *   While many philosophers have discussed the distinction between natural and conventional signs (dating back to the Stoics and Augustine), the specific terminology of decomposing \"hallmark\" (*oznaka*) into \"symptoms\" (*symptomy*) and \"signals\" (*sygnały*) is a characteristic feature of the work of one particular member of the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n    *   A review of the philosophical literature on this school confirms that **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is the philosopher who introduced and systematically used this precise classification.\n    *   Ajdukiewicz developed this distinction in his work on epistemology and philosophy of language, notably in works like his textbook \"Propaedeutics to Philosophy\" (*Propedeutyka filozofii*) and other essays on meaning. He used this framework to clarify the nature of signs and, more broadly, the foundations of language and knowledge.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:**\n    The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who analyzed the general notion of a sign or \"hallmark\" (*oznaka*) by breaking it down into natural signs, which he called \"symptoms,\" and conventional signs, which he called \"signals,\" is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
