    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and count the atoms.**\n*   The molecule is toluene.\n*   The chemical formula for toluene is C7H8.\n*   This means the molecule contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe question asks for the number of **contracted Gaussian functions** (CGFs), which are also referred to as basis functions. The 6-31G notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented. We need to analyze this for each type of atom in the molecule.\n\n*   **For Carbon (C), a heavy atom (non-hydrogen):**\n    *   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The \"6\" indicates that the core 1s orbital is represented by a single CGF. This CGF is a fixed linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n        *   Contribution: 1 CGF (for the 1s orbital).\n    *   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The \"31\" indicates that the valence shell is \"split\" into two parts (a \"double-zeta\" representation).\n        *   **Inner Valence (\"3\"):** This part is described by one set of valence functions. It includes one s-type CGF and a set of three p-type CGFs (px, py, pz). Each of these CGFs is a combination of 3 PGFs.\n            *   Contribution: 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = 4 CGFs.\n        *   **Outer Valence (\"1\"):** This part is described by a second, more diffuse set of valence functions. It also includes one s-type CGF and a set of three p-type CGFs (px, py, pz). Each of these CGFs consists of a single PGF.\n            *   Contribution: 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = 4 CGFs.\n    *   **Total CGFs per Carbon atom** = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital.\n    *   **Valence Orbital (1s):** The \"31\" split applies directly to the 1s orbital.\n        *   **Inner Valence (\"3\"):** Represented by one s-type CGF (from 3 PGFs).\n            *   Contribution: 1 CGF.\n        *   **Outer Valence (\"1\"):** Represented by one s-type CGF (from 1 PGF).\n            *   Contribution: 1 CGF.\n    *   **Total CGFs per Hydrogen atom** = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire molecule.**\nNow, we multiply the number of CGFs per atom by the count of each atom in toluene (C7H8) and sum the results.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon atoms:**\n    *   7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs\n\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs\n\n*   **Total number of CGFs:**\n    *   63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = **79 CGFs**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for *contracted* functions (CGFs), not *primitive* functions (PGFs). The numbers in \"6-31G\" refer to the number of PGFs used to build the CGFs.\n2.  **Atom Types:** The basis set description is different for hydrogen atoms compared to heavier atoms like carbon.\n3.  **p-Orbitals:** Remember that a p-shell consists of three orbitals (px, py, pz), so it contributes 3 functions for each part of the split-valence description (e.g., 3 functions for the \"3\" part and 3 functions for the \"1\" part for Carbon).\n4.  **Correct Atom Count:** Ensure you are using the correct number of atoms from the molecular formula (C7H8).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated by summing the contributions from all 7 carbon atoms and all 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   Total CGFs = (7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/C) + (8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/H) = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
