    "This question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, denoted as $ \\chi(G) $, for a graph $ G $ with specific properties.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   Number of vertices, $ n = 12345 $.\n    *   The graph $ G $ is not the complete graph $ K_{12345} $. A complete graph $ K_n $ is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n    *   We need to find the maximum number of colors for a proper vertex coloring. This is the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, $ \\chi(G) $, over all graphs $ G $ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n2.  **Recall Relevant Graph Theory Theorems:**\n    *   **General Upper Bound:** For any graph $ G $, the chromatic number is at most one more than its maximum degree: $ \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) + 1 $. The maximum possible degree for a graph with $ n $ vertices is $ n-1 $. So, for any graph with 12345 vertices, $ \\chi(G) \\leq (12345-1) + 1 = 12345 $.\n    *   **Brooks' Theorem:** This theorem provides a tighter bound. It states that for any connected graph $ G $, $ \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) $ unless $ G $ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. If $ G $ is a complete graph $ K_n $, $ \\chi(K_n) = n $ and $ \\Delta(K_n) = n-1 $, so $ \\chi(K_n) = \\Delta(K_n) + 1 $. If $ G $ is an odd cycle $ C_k $ (with $ k \\geq 3 $ being odd), $ \\chi(C_k) = 3 $ and $ \\Delta(C_k) = 2 $, so $ \\chi(C_k) = \\Delta(C_k) + 1 $.\n    *   **Clique Number as a Lower Bound:** The size of the largest clique (a subgraph that is a complete graph) in $ G $, denoted $ \\omega(G) $, provides a lower bound for the chromatic number: $ \\omega(G) \\leq \\chi(G) $.\n\n3.  **Determine the Upper Bound for $ \\chi(G) $:**\n    Let $ G $ be any graph with $ n=12345 $ vertices that is not the complete graph $ K_{12345} $.\n    *   If $ G $ is disconnected, its chromatic number is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. The analysis can be applied to the component with the highest chromatic number. We can assume $ G $ is connected to find the absolute maximum.\n    *   We apply Brooks' Theorem to $ G $.\n        *   **Case 1: $ G $ is an odd cycle.** Since $ n=12345 $ is odd, $ G $ could be the cycle graph $ C_{12345} $. In this case, $ \\chi(G) = 3 $. This is a possible value, but we are looking for the *maximum* possible value.\n        *   **Case 2: $ G $ is not a complete graph and not an odd cycle.** By Brooks' Theorem, $ \\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G) $. The maximum possible degree for any vertex in a graph with $ n=12345 $ vertices is $ \\Delta(G) \\leq n-1 = 12344 $. Therefore, for any such graph, $ \\chi(G) \\leq 12344 $.\n    *   Combining these cases, the chromatic number of any graph $G$ satisfying the conditions can be at most 12344.\n\n4.  **Determine if this Upper Bound is Achievable:**\n    To show that 12344 is the maximum possible chromatic number, we need to construct a graph $ G_0 $ with 12345 vertices that is not complete, for which $ \\chi(G_0) = 12344 $.\n    *   Let's construct such a graph. Consider the complete graph $ K_{12345} $ and remove a single edge, say between vertices $ u $ and $ v $. Let's call this new graph $ G_0 $.\n    *   $ G_0 $ has 12345 vertices.\n    *   $ G_0 $ is not the complete graph because the edge $ (u, v) $ is missing.\n    *   What is the maximum degree of $ G_0 $? The degrees of most vertices remain $ 12344 $. The degrees of $ u $ and $ v $ are now $ 12343 $. So, $ \\Delta(G_0) = 12344 $.\n    *   $ G_0 $ is not an odd cycle. It's a very dense graph.\n    *   Since $ G_0 $ is not a complete graph and not an odd cycle, Brooks' Theorem applies, giving us $ \\chi(G_0) \\leq \\Delta(G_0) = 12344 $. This confirms our upper bound for this specific graph.\n    *   Now let's find a lower bound for $ \\chi(G_0) $ using the clique number, $ \\omega(G_0) $. Consider the set of all vertices except for $ u $, i.e., $ V \\setminus \\{u\\} $. This set contains $ 12344 $ vertices, and in the original $ K_{12345} $, they formed a $ K_{12344} $. Since the removed edge $ (u,v) $ does not involve any two vertices from this set (it involves $ u $, which is not in the set), all edges between vertices in $ V \\setminus \\{u\\} $ are still present in $ G_0 $.\n    *   Therefore, the subgraph induced by $ V \\setminus \\{u\\} $ is a complete graph $ K_{12344} $. This means $ G_0 $ contains a clique of size 12344.\n    *   So, the clique number is $ \\omega(G_0) \\geq 12344 $.\n    *   We have the general inequality $ \\omega(G) \\leq \\chi(G) $. Thus, $ \\chi(G_0) \\geq \\omega(G_0) \\geq 12344 $.\n    *   Combining our findings for $ G_0 $: we have $ \\chi(G_0) \\leq 12344 $ and $ \\chi(G_0) \\geq 12344 $. This forces the conclusion that $ \\chi(G_0) = 12344 $.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    We have shown that for any graph $ G $ with 12345 vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number is at most 12344. We have also constructed a specific graph that satisfies these conditions and has a chromatic number of exactly 12344. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Reading the question carefully:** The key constraints are the number of vertices ($12345$) and the fact that the graph is *not* a complete graph. The question asks for the *maximum possible* chromatic number, not the number for a specific graph.\n*   **Choosing the right theorem:** Brooks' Theorem is the central tool here, as it directly connects the chromatic number $ \\chi(G) $ to the maximum degree $ \\Delta(G) $ and handles the specific exceptions of complete graphs and odd cycles.\n*   **The exceptions to Brooks' Theorem:** It's crucial to consider what happens if $G$ is one of the exceptions. The complete graph is ruled out by the problem statement. The odd cycle case ($C_{12345}$) gives a chromatic number of 3, which is a valid possibility but not the maximum.\n*   **Proving a maximum value:** A proof of a maximum requires two parts:\n    1.  An **upper bound**: Showing that no graph can have a chromatic number greater than this value.\n    2.  An **existence proof**: Constructing an example of a graph that achieves this value.\n*   **Using cliques for lower bounds:** The fact that $ \\omega(G) \\leq \\chi(G) $ is a very useful tool for establishing a minimum number of required colors.\n\nThe maximum number of colours needed is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
