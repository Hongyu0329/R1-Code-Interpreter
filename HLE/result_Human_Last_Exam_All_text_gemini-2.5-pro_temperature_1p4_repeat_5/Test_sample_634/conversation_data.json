    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of the two given polynomial matrices, $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$.\n    $P_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    $P_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of GCRD:** A polynomial matrix $G(s)$ is a GCRD of $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$ if:\n    a. $G(s)$ is a common right divisor of both $P_1(s)$ and $P_2(s)$. This means there exist polynomial matrices $Q_1(s)$ and $Q_2(s)$ such that $P_1(s) = Q_1(s)G(s)$ and $P_2(s) = Q_2(s)G(s)$.\n    b. If $D(s)$ is any other common right divisor, then $D(s)$ must be a right divisor of $G(s)$.\n    A GCRD is not unique; if $G(s)$ is a GCRD, then so is $U(s)G(s)$ for any unimodular matrix $U(s)$ (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant).\n\n3.  **Choose a Method:** A standard algorithm to find the GCRD is to use elementary row operations on the composite matrix formed by stacking $P_1$ and $P_2$. This is analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for integers.\n\n4.  **Form the Composite Matrix:**\n    Let $M(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} P_1(s) \\\\ P_2(s) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Our goal is to apply elementary row operations (which corresponds to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix) to transform $M(s)$ into the form $\\begin{pmatrix} G(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $G(s)$ is a 2x2 matrix and 0 is a 2x2 zero matrix. The resulting $G(s)$ will be a GCRD of $P_1$ and $P_2$.\n\n5.  **Perform Row Reduction:**\n    Let the rows of $M(s)$ be $R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4$.\n    $M(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} s^2 + s & -s & \\leftarrow R_1 \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 & \\leftarrow R_2 \\\\ s & 0 & \\leftarrow R_3 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 & \\leftarrow R_4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    To simplify, we want to use rows with lower degree polynomials to eliminate terms in higher degree rows. The lowest degree non-zero element in the first column is in $R_3$. Let's use $R_3$ as a pivot row.\n\n    *   Operation 1: $R_1 \\rightarrow R_1 - (s+1)R_3$\n        $(s^2+s) - (s+1)s = 0$\n        $-s - (s+1)0 = -s$\n        The new $R_1$ is $[0, -s]$.\n\n    *   Operation 2: $R_2 \\rightarrow R_2 + s R_3$\n        $(-s^2-1) + s(s) = -1$\n        $s^2 + s(0) = s^2$\n        The new $R_2$ is $[-1, s^2]$.\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    $M_1(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -s \\\\ -1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now, we have a constant (-1) in the first column of the new second row. This is an excellent pivot. Let's swap it to the top.\n    *   Swap $R_1$ and $R_2$:\n    $M_2(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & s^2 \\\\ 0 & -s \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Use the new $R_1$ to eliminate other entries in the first column.\n    *   Operation 3: $R_3 \\rightarrow R_3 + s R_1$\n        $s + s(-1) = 0$\n        $0 + s(s^2) = s^3$\n        The new $R_3$ is $[0, s^3]$.\n\n    *   Operation 4: $R_4 \\rightarrow R_4 - (s+1)R_1$\n        $(-s-1) - (s+1)(-1) = (-s-1) + (s+1) = 0$\n        $1 - (s+1)(s^2) = 1 - s^3 - s^2$\n        The new $R_4$ is $[0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]$.\n\n    The matrix is now:\n    $M_3(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & s^2 \\\\ 0 & -s \\\\ 0 & s^3 \\\\ 0 & 1 - s^3 - s^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    The first column is reduced. Now we focus on the second column for rows 2, 3, and 4. The pivot elements are $-s, s^3, 1-s^3-s^2$. The lowest degree polynomial is $-s$ in $R_2$. We use this to reduce the other rows.\n\n    *   Operation 5: $R_3 \\rightarrow R_3 + s^2 R_2$\n        $s^3 + s^2(-s) = 0$\n        The new $R_3$ is $[0, 0]$.\n\n    *   Operation 6: We divide $1 - s^3 - s^2$ by $-s$. The quotient is $(s^2+s)$ and the remainder is $1$. So, we perform $R_4 \\rightarrow R_4 - (s^2+s)R_2$.\n        $(1-s^3-s^2) - (s^2+s)(-s) = (1-s^3-s^2) + (s^3+s^2) = 1$.\n        The new $R_4$ is $[0, 1]$.\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    $M_4(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & s^2 \\\\ 0 & -s \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    We now have a row $[0, 1]$, which is an excellent pivot for the second column. Let's move it up.\n    *   Swap $R_3$ and $R_4$, then swap the new $R_3$ with $R_2$:\n    $M_5(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & s^2 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -s \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    Now use the new $R_2$, which is $[0, 1]$, to eliminate other entries in the second column.\n    *   Operation 7: $R_1 \\rightarrow R_1 - s^2 R_2$\n        $-1 - s^2(0) = -1$\n        $s^2 - s^2(1) = 0$\n        The new $R_1$ is $[-1, 0]$.\n\n    *   Operation 8: $R_3 \\rightarrow R_3 + s R_2$\n        $-s + s(1) = 0$\n        The new $R_3$ is $[0, 0]$.\n\n    The matrix is now:\n    $M_6(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n6.  **Interpret the Result:**\n    The matrix has been reduced to the form $\\begin{pmatrix} G(s) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, where\n    $G(s) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    This matrix $G(s)$ is a GCRD of $P_1$ and $P_2$.\n\n7.  **Final Form of the Answer:**\n    The GCRD is determined up to a left unimodular factor. The matrix $G(s)$ is unimodular since $\\det(G(s)) = -1$, which is a non-zero constant. Any unimodular matrix is a valid GCRD in this case, meaning the original matrices are \"right coprime\". By convention, the GCRD is often given in its simplest or canonical form. We can multiply the first row of $G(s)$ by -1 (an elementary row operation) to obtain the identity matrix.\n    $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    Both $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ are correct answers. We will provide the latter as it is the most standard representation.\n\nFinal Answer: The greatest common right divisor is the identity matrix.\n\n```\n<<<\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}>>>\n```"
