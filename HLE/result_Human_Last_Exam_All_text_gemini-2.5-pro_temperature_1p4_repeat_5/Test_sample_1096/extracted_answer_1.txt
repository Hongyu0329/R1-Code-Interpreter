The pair of optimal learning rates $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ is given by the values $\frac{4(M+1) + 2\sqrt{2}(M-1)}{M^2+6M+1}$ and $\frac{4(M+1) - 2\sqrt{2}(M-1)}{M^2+6M+1}$. The order does not matter. Alternatively, their inverses are $\frac{1}{\gamma_{1,2}} = \frac{M+1}{2} \mp \frac{M-1}{2\sqrt{2}}$.
