    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a concept from fixed point theory in mathematics, which generalizes the idea of a fixed point (`f(x)=x`) to a system of three equations with three variables. The conditions for its existence are typically established using a framework similar to the Banach Fixed Point Theorem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**\n\nFirst, we need to correctly define the object of interest. Given three sets X, Y, Z and three functions:\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × Z × X → Y`\n*   `H: Z × X × Y → Z`\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triple of elements `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, z, x) = y`\n3.  `H(z, x, y) = z`\n\n**Careful Point:** The order of variables in the domains of G and H is cyclically permuted. This is the standard convention. The functions provided in the question (`G:Y*X*Y→Y` and `H:Z*Y*X→Z`) appear to be typos and are corrected here to the standard, symmetric form for the problem to be well-posed in its usual context.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Mathematical Framework**\n\nTo prove the existence of a solution to this system, we use tools from fixed point theory. The most common tool is the **Banach Fixed Point Theorem (or Contraction Mapping Principle)**. This requires two key ingredients:\n1.  A **complete metric space**.\n2.  A **contraction mapping** on that space.\n\n**Careful Point:** We must translate the problem of finding a tripled fixed point into a standard fixed point problem for a single operator on a single space.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Metric Space and Operator**\n\n*   **Space:** We assume that `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are metric spaces. To use the Banach theorem, we require them to be **complete metric spaces**. We then form the product space `W = X × Y × Z`. We can equip `W` with a metric, for example:\n    `d((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    If X, Y, and Z are complete, then their product space W is also a complete metric space.\n\n*   **Operator:** We define a single operator `T: W → W` using the functions F, G, and H:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, z, x), H(z, x, y))`\n    A fixed point of this operator `T` is a point `(x, y, z)` such that `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`. This is exactly equivalent to the system of equations for the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Contraction Condition**\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the conditions on F, G, and H that make the operator `T` a **contraction mapping**. A mapping `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `w2 = (x2, y2, z2)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n`d(T(w1), T(w2)) ≤ k * d(w1, w2)`\n\nWe can derive this condition by imposing a set of \"mixed\" contraction inequalities on F, G, and H.\n\n**Careful Point:** The condition must link the output distances of F, G, H to the input distances in a way that the sum contracts.\n\nLet's assume there exist non-negative constants `α_i, β_i, γ_i` (for i=1, 2, 3) such that for all `x1,x2 ∈ X`, `y1,y2 ∈ Y`, `z1,z2 ∈ Z`:\n*   `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ α_1 d_X(x1, x2) + α_2 d_Y(y1, y2) + α_3 d_Z(z1, z2)`\n*   `d_Y(G(y1, z1, x1), G(y2, z2, x2)) ≤ β_1 d_Y(y1, y2) + β_2 d_Z(z1, z2) + β_3 d_X(x1, x2)`\n*   `d_Z(H(z1, x1, y1), H(z2, x2, y2)) ≤ γ_1 d_Z(z1, z2) + γ_2 d_X(x1, x2) + γ_3 d_Y(y1, y2)`\n\nSumming these three inequalities gives the distance `d(T(w1), T(w2))`:\n`d(T(w1), T(w2))`\n`≤ (α_1+β_3+γ_2)d_X(x1,x2) + (α_2+β_1+γ_3)d_Y(y1,y2) + (α_3+β_2+γ_1)d_Z(z1,z2)`\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, we need the sum on the right to be bounded by `k * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z)` for some `k < 1`. This is guaranteed if the coefficients for each distance component are less than 1. Let `k = max(α_1+β_3+γ_2, α_2+β_1+γ_3, α_3+β_2+γ_1)`. If `k < 1`, then `T` is a contraction mapping.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe conditions for the functions `F: X×Y×Z→X`, `G: Y×Z×X→Y`, and `H: Z×X×Y→Z` to have a (unique) FGH-tripled fixed point are based on the Banach Fixed Point Theorem applied to the product space. The primary conditions are:\n\n**1. Space Condition:**\nThe sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **non-empty complete metric spaces** with respective metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n\n**2. Mapping (Contraction) Condition:**\nThe functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must collectively satisfy a contractive condition. Specifically, there must exist nine non-negative constants `α_1, α_2, α_3`, `β_1, β_2, β_3`, and `γ_1, γ_2, γ_3` such that for all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, and `z1, z2 ∈ Z`, the following three inequalities hold:\n*   `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ α_1 d_X(x1, x2) + α_2 d_Y(y1, y2) + α_3 d_Z(z1, z2)`\n*   `d_Y(G(y1, z1, x1), G(y2, z2, x2)) ≤ β_1 d_Y(y1, y2) + β_2 d_Z(z1, z2) + β_3 d_X(x1, x2)`\n*   `d_Z(H(z1, x1, y1), H(z2, x2, y2)) ≤ γ_1 d_Z(z1, z2) + γ_2 d_X(x1, x2) + γ_3 d_Y(y1, y2)`\n\nFurthermore, the sums of these constants must satisfy the following criteria:\n*   `(α_1 + β_3 + γ_2) < 1`\n*   `(α_2 + β_1 + γ_3) < 1`\n*   `(α_3 + β_2 + γ_1) < 1`\n\nIf these conditions are met, there exists a unique tripled fixed point `(x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z` such that `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, z, x) = y`, and `H(z, x, y) = z`.\n\n<<<The primary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n1.  `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are non-empty complete metric spaces.\n2.  The functions F, G, and H satisfy a joint contraction condition. For all `x1, x2 ∈ X`, `y1, y2 ∈ Y`, `z1, z2 ∈ Z`, there exist non-negative constants `α_i, β_i, γ_i` (i=1,2,3) such that:\n    `d_X(F(x1,y1,z1), F(x2,y2,z2)) ≤ α_1d_X(x1,x2) + α_2d_Y(y1,y2) + α_3d_Z(z1,z2)`\n    `d_Y(G(y1,z1,x1), G(y2,z2,x2)) ≤ β_1d_Y(y1,y2) + β_2d_Z(z1,z2) + β_3d_X(x1,x2)`\n    `d_Z(H(z1,x1,y1), H(z2,x2,y2)) ≤ γ_1d_Z(z1,z2) + γ_2d_X(x1,x2) + γ_3d_Y(y1,y2)`\n    with the sums of the constants being less than 1:\n    `α_1+β_3+γ_2 < 1`\n    `α_2+β_1+γ_3 < 1`\n    `α_3+β_2+γ_1 < 1`>>>"
