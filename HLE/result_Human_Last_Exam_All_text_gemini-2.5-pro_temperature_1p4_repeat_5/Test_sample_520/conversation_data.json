    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question centers on a specific historical individual, Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the UK during World War II.\n2.  **Identify the Key Event:** He was suspected of being a German spy by British counterintelligence (MI5).\n3.  **Identify the Reason for Suspicion:** The primary reason for the suspicion, as stated in the question, was that he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\" This secrecy and evasiveness were interpreted as classic signs of an undercover agent with a fabricated cover story.\n4.  **Formulate the Research Question:** What was the profession that Andre Vernault was so ashamed of that he preferred to risk being seen as a spy rather than reveal it?\n5.  **Gather Information:** Historical records, particularly from the declassified files of MI5 and authoritative histories like Christopher Andrew's \"The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5,\" detail this case. These sources confirm that Vernault arrived in Britain in 1940 and was extensively debriefed. His reluctance to speak about his past work raised red flags.\n6.  **Uncover the True Profession:** The records reveal that Andre Vernault's profession was not espionage. Instead, he worked in the meat processing industry. Specifically, he was an abattoir (slaughterhouse) consultant and a manufacturer of sausage-skins, which involves processing animal intestines.\n7.  **Determine the Motive for Concealment:** Vernault was deeply embarrassed by his profession. He considered it to be a lowly and undignified trade. When interrogated by British officials, he chose to be vague and hide his real job, likely in an attempt to present himself as a more respectable person. This decision, born of personal pride and embarrassment, had the unintended consequence of making him a prime espionage suspect.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Context of War:** During the war, Britain was justifiably paranoid about German spies infiltrating the country disguised as refugees. Any inconsistency or secrecy in a refugee's story was treated with the utmost suspicion.\n*   **Intelligence Psychology:** From MI5's perspective, a person hiding their background is a significant indicator of potential hostile intent. They had to assume the worst-case scenario. The Vernault case is a classic example of how innocent actions can be misinterpreted under conditions of high alert.\n*   **The Nature of the Profession:** The job—working with animal guts to make sausage casings—was considered unglamorous and perhaps even unsanitary or distasteful by some. It is plausible that someone in this line of work would be sensitive about it, especially when trying to make a new start in a foreign country.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the specific profession that caused the misunderstanding.\n\n<<<Manufacturer of sausage-skins"
