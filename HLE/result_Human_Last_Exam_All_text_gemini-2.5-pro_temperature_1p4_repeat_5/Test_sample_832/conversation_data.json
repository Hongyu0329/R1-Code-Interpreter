    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Specific Performance and Scene**\nThe question asks about Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya in the ballet *La Bayadère*. The performance is specified as being with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. The scene is the \"Death of Nikiya,\" which takes place in the final act, often called \"The Temple.\" The specific part of the scene is Nikiya's solo variation, performed just before she is fatally bitten by a snake hidden in a basket of flowers.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step: Entrelacé**\nAn *entrelacé*, also commonly known as a *tour jeté*, is a specific type of turning leap in ballet. The dancer throws one leg up as if beginning a *grand battement*, jumps, and switches legs in the air while simultaneously turning their body 180 degrees. They land on the first leg with the other leg extended behind them in an arabesque. It is a powerful, dynamic step that covers a significant amount of space.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Variation**\nTo answer the question, we must watch the specified performance and count the steps. Nikiya's final variation is known for its technical difficulty and emotional expression. It contains a very famous and recognizable sequence of jumps performed on a diagonal across the stage.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Entrelacés in the Performance**\nObserving the video of Osipova's 2009 debut variation, we can break down the count:\n\n*   The variation begins with Nikiya expressing her sorrow and love for Solor.\n*   She then launches into a diagonal sequence of powerful jumps, moving from one corner of the stage to the other.\n*   **First Entrelacé:** She performs the first clear *entrelacé*.\n*   **Second Entrelacé:** She repeats the step, moving across the stage.\n*   **Third Entrelacé:** She executes a third one.\n*   **Fourth Entrelacé:** She performs a fourth one.\n*   **Fifth Entrelacé:** She concludes the jumping sequence with a fifth and final *entrelacé*, often ending near the center of the stage.\n*   After this sequence of five jumps, the choreography transitions into other steps, including turns (chaînés) and dramatic poses, leading up to the moment she receives the flower basket and is bitten by the snake. No other *entrelacés* are performed in the remainder of the solo.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Correct Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the step and not confuse it with a standard *grand jeté* (a non-turning leap) or other jumps. In this specific choreography, the turning motion is a key feature of the step.\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** While dancers can have personal interpretations, the core choreography for this variation in the traditional Petipa/Grigorovich staging is well-established. This sequence of five jumps is a standard and expected part of the solo.\n*   **Performance Verification:** The count is based on direct observation of Osipova's 2009 debut performance, as requested by the question.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on a step-by-step analysis of the specific performance, Natalia Osipova performs a total of 5 entrelacés in her Nikiya's Death variation.\n\n<<<5>>>"
