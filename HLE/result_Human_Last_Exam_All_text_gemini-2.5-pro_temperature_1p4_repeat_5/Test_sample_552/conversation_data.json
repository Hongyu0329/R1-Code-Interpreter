    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the specific scientific paper:** The question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. This is one of his four famous \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n2.  **Analyze the question's core requirement:** The question asks for the name of the person whose *lectures* were cited by Einstein in this specific paper. This is a very precise request, focusing on a citation to \"lectures\" rather than just any work or paper.\n\n3.  **Examine the citations in the paper:** Einstein's papers from this period are known for having very few citations. However, the paper on Brownian motion, which builds heavily on the foundations of statistical mechanics, is an exception.\n\n4.  **Locate the specific citation:** In the introduction (§1) of the paper, Einstein discusses the foundations of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat. When setting up the theoretical framework, he makes a direct reference to the work of a key figure in this field.\n\n5.  **Identify the person and the cited work:** The citation is to Ludwig Boltzmann. Einstein specifically wrote that a certain point had been \"emphasized by L. Boltzmann in his lectures on gas theory.\" This refers to Boltzmann's famous two-volume work, *Vorlesungen über Gastheorie* (*Lectures on Gas Theory*), published in 1896 and 1898. Einstein had studied this work intensively on his own.\n\n**Careful points to note:**\n\n*   **Specificity:** The question is not about who influenced Einstein in general, but specifically whose *lectures* he cited in this particular paper.\n*   **Source of the \"lectures\":** While Einstein cites \"lectures,\" he is referring to Boltzmann's published book titled *Lectures on Gas Theory*. Einstein did not personally attend lectures given by Boltzmann.\n*   **Context:** This citation is significant because it firmly places Einstein's work within the tradition of statistical mechanics developed by figures like James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, and it demonstrates his reliance on their foundational concepts.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBased on the direct textual evidence from Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion, the person whose lectures he cited was Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
