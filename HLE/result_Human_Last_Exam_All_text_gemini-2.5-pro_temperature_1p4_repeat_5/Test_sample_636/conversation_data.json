    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nThe goal is to design a state feedback controller for a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The system is described by matrices `A` and `B`, and the closed-loop system dynamics are given by `x_dot = (A + BF)x`. We need to find the feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF` are located at the desired positions `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Define Given Matrices and Variables**\n*   System matrix `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n*   The state vector `x` is 2-dimensional (`n=2`), and the input vector `u` is 2-dimensional (`m=2`).\n*   The state feedback gain matrix `F` must have dimensions `m x n`, so `F` is a `2x2` matrix. Let's denote its elements as:\n    `F = [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]]`\n\n**3. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues (poles) of the closed-loop system are `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial corresponding to these eigenvalues is:\n`p_d(s) = (s - λ1)(s - λ2)`\n`p_d(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n`p_d(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n`p_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\nThis is our target characteristic polynomial.\n\n**4. Calculate the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A_cl = A + BF`**\nFirst, we compute the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]] = [[1*f11 + 2*f21, 1*f12 + 2*f22], [1*f11 + 0*f21, 1*f12 + 0*f22]]`\n`BF = [[f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22], [f11, f12]]`\n\nNext, we add `A` to `BF` to get the closed-loop matrix `A_cl`:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22], [f11, f12]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f11 + 2*f21, 1 + f12 + 2*f22], [1 + f11, f12]]`\n\n**5. Find the Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`**\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `p(s) = det(sI - A_cl)`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n`sI - A_cl = [[s, 0], [0, s]] - [[-1 + f11 + 2*f21, 1 + f12 + 2*f22], [1 + f11, f12]]`\n`sI - A_cl = [[s - (-1 + f11 + 2*f21), -(1 + f12 + 2*f22)], [-(1 + f11), s - f12]]`\n`sI - A_cl = [[s + 1 - f11 - 2*f21, -1 - f12 - 2*f22], [-1 - f11, s - f12]]`\n\nNow, we calculate the determinant:\n`det(sI - A_cl) = (s + 1 - f11 - 2*f21)(s - f12) - (-1 - f12 - 2*f22)(-1 - f11)`\n`det(sI - A_cl) = s^2 + s(1 - f11 - f12 - 2*f21) + (-1 - f11 - 2*f12 - 2*f22 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f11*f22)`\n\n**6. Equate Coefficients and Solve for the Elements of F**\nWe match the coefficients of our calculated polynomial `p(s)` with the desired polynomial `p_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\n\n*   **Coefficient of s¹:**\n    `1 - f11 - f12 - 2*f21 = 2`\n    `f11 + f12 + 2*f21 = -1`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Coefficient of s⁰ (constant term):**\n    `-1 - f11 - 2*f12 - 2*f22 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f11*f22 = 2`\n    `-f11 - 2*f12 - 2*f22 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f11*f22 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\n**Careful Point:** We have two equations and four unknowns (`f11`, `f12`, `f21`, `f22`). This is a characteristic of multi-input systems, meaning there are infinite possible solutions for `F`. We can find one specific solution by simplifying the problem, for example, by setting some elements of `F` to zero.\n\n**7. Find a Specific Solution**\nLet's make a simplifying assumption to solve the system of equations. Let's set `f21 = 0` and `f22 = 0`. This is equivalent to assuming that the second input `u2` is not used for feedback (`u2=0`).\n\nThe equations become:\n*   Equation 1: `f11 + f12 + 2(0) = -1  =>  f11 + f12 = -1`\n*   Equation 2: `-f11 - 2*f12 - 2(0) + 2*f12(0) - 2*f11(0) = 3  =>  -f11 - 2*f12 = 3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n1.  `f11 + f12 = -1`\n2.  `-f11 - 2*f12 = 3`\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n`(f11 + f12) + (-f11 - 2*f12) = -1 + 3`\n`-f12 = 2`\n`f12 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f12 = -2` into the first equation:\n`f11 + (-2) = -1`\n`f11 = 1`\n\nSo, one possible solution for the feedback gain matrix is `F` where `f11 = 1`, `f12 = -2`, `f21 = 0`, and `f22 = 0`.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\nWe can verify this result:\n`A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A + BF = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic polynomial of this matrix is `det(sI - (A+BF)) = det([[s, 1], [-2, s+2]]) = s(s+2) - (1)(-2) = s^2 + 2s + 2`, which has roots `-1 ± j` as desired.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
