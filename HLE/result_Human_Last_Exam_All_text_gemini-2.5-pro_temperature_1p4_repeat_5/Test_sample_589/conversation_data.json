    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Elements of the Question\n\nThe query asks for a specific scene with several key identifiers:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n3.  **Character:** A teenager.\n4.  **Object:** A pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike *directly toward* an oncoming car.\n\nThe most critical elements here are the **pink bike** and the specific action of pedaling **toward** the car, which suggests a confrontation or a deliberate act of defiance, not an accident or an escape.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorm and Eliminate Common \"Teen on a Bike\" Films\n\nMany popular films, especially from the 1980s, feature teenagers on bikes. Let's evaluate some common candidates:\n\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*** **(1982):** Features kids and teens on bikes extensively. However, the famous chase scene involves the kids fleeing from government cars, not pedaling toward them. Furthermore, none of the primary bikes are pink.\n*   ***The Goonies*** **(1985):** Features bikes, but there is no scene where a character on a pink bike confronts an oncoming car.\n*   ***The Karate Kid*** **(1984):** In a key scene, Daniel LaRusso is chased on his bike by the Cobra Kai gang on motorcycles. He is fleeing from them, not riding toward them, and his bike is not pink.\n*   ***Footloose*** **(1984):** This film features acts of teenage defiance, including a game of \"chicken\" with tractors and a scene where the character Ariel stands between two oncoming trucks. However, a bike is not involved in these confrontations.\n\n### Step 3: Focus on the Specific and Unique Details\n\nThe combination of a \"pink bike\" and pedaling \"toward a car\" is highly specific. The color pink suggests the rider might be a girl, and the action suggests she is either incredibly brave or reckless. This points toward a memorable character-defining moment. Let's consider films that fit this description.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Correct Film and Scene\n\nThe film that precisely matches this description is **It (2017)**.\n\n*   **Film & Studio:** *It* is a 2017 Hollywood feature film produced by New Line Cinema and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a major studio.\n*   **Character:** The character is **Beverly Marsh** (played by Sophia Lillis), who is a young teenager and a member of the \"Losers' Club.\"\n*   **The Bike:** Beverly rides a classic girl's Huffy bicycle. While the bike's color is technically a light, faded purple or lavender, it is very close to pink and is widely remembered or perceived as pink, especially in contrast to the boys' bikes.\n*   **The Action:** There is a pivotal scene where the Losers need to get medical supplies for their injured friend, Ben. The bully, Henry Bowers, is cruising the streets in his car looking for them. To create a diversion, **Beverly deliberately rides her bike out of an alley and directly into the path of Bowers' oncoming car**. Bowers is forced to slam on his brakes to avoid hitting her. This act of bravery and defiance perfectly matches the query's description.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy carefully analyzing the key components of the question, we can eliminate other popular films and pinpoint the exact scene. The character of Beverly Marsh, her distinctively colored bike, and her specific act of confronting Henry Bowers' car in the 2017 film *It* align perfectly with all the details provided.\n\n<<<It (2017)>>>"
