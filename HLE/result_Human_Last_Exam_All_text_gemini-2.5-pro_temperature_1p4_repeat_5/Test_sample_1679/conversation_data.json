    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific film that meets three criteria:\n1.  It must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n2.  It must be the *first* such winner chronologically.\n3.  It must visually depict one of the two Luxor Obelisks.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and Their Locations\nThere are two Luxor Obelisks, which were originally a pair at the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   **Obelisk 1:** Remains at its original location in front of the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   **Obelisk 2:** Stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France, where it was erected in 1836.\n\nTherefore, the film in question must feature scenes shot or set either at the Luxor Temple in Egypt or the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\n### Step 3: Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners\nWe must search the list of Best Picture winners, starting from the first award in 1927/28, and look for a film that depicts one of these two locations.\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:** Winners like *Wings*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *It Happened One Night*, and *Gone with the Wind* are primarily set in America, on battlefields, or in locations other than Paris or Luxor.\n    *   A potential candidate from this era is **_The Life of Emile Zola_ (1937)**. The film is set in France and depicts historical events in Paris. However, upon review, its key scenes take place in courtrooms, offices, and at a train station. There is no clear, identifiable depiction of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk.\n\n*   **1940s:** Winners like *Rebecca*, *How Green Was My Valley*, *Casablanca*, and *The Best Years of Our Lives* do not feature the required locations. They are set in England, Wales, Morocco, and America, respectively.\n\n*   **1950s:** This decade saw several lavish productions set in international locations.\n    *   **_An American in Paris_ (1951):** This musical is explicitly set in Paris. The film's celebrated 17-minute closing ballet sequence is a visual tour of Paris, depicted through sets inspired by French painters. One of these elaborate sets is a recreation of the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk clearly visible at its center. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   **_Around the World in 80 Days_ (1956):** The film's global journey includes stops in both Paris and Egypt. The characters travel through Paris and there are shots of the city, including the Place de la Concorde with its obelisk. The film's path through Egypt is via the Suez Canal and does not include a stop in Luxor.\n    *   **_Gigi_ (1958):** Another musical set and filmed in Paris. It features many on-location shots of the city's landmarks, including the Place de la Concorde.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Candidates and Determine the First\nWe have identified three confirmed Best Picture winners that depict the Luxor Obelisk in Paris:\n1.  _An American in Paris_ (winner for 1951)\n2.  _Around the World in 80 Days_ (winner for 1956)\n3.  _Gigi_ (winner for 1958)\n\nSince the question asks for the *first* winner, we compare their award years. _An American in Paris_ (1951) predates the other two films. The stylized depiction in its ballet sequence is a clear representation of the landmark, thus fulfilling the question's criteria.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe first film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture and feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen is _An American in Paris_, which depicted the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde during its famous ballet finale.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
