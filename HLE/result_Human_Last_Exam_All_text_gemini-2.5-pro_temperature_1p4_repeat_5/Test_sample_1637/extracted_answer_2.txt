Yes, this strategy will likely solve the problem. The precipitation is caused by the poor water solubility of the probe, primarily due to its large hydrophobic thioxanthenone core and the long 6-chlorohexyl chain. While replacing the polar amide group itself is not the best approach, the general strategy of incorporating a hydrophilic Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain is a standard and effective method to increase the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic molecules. A more effective modification would be to replace the hydrophobic 6-chlorohexyl chain with a PEG chain, which would significantly increase the overall hydrophilicity of the probe and prevent it from precipitating out of the aqueous cell culture medium.
