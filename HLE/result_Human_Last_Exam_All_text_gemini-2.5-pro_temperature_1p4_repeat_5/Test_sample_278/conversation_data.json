    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parametric Curve**\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts based on the value of the parameter `t`:\n\n*   **Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n    *   The value of $b$ is 1.\n    *   The parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n    *   We know that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of a unit circle.\n    *   As `t` goes from 0 to $\\pi$, the point $(x, y)$ traces the upper half of the unit circle, starting from $(1, 0)$ and ending at $(-1, 0)$.\n\n*   **Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n    *   The value of $b$ is 5.\n    *   The parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n    *   We can write this as $(\\frac{x}{1})^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis.\n    *   As `t` goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, the value of $\\sin t$ is negative. This means the point $(x, y)$ traces the lower half of this ellipse, starting from $(-1, 0)$ and ending at $(1, 0)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Bounding Box of the Figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that can contain the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for `x` and `y` that the curve reaches. This defines the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **Finding the range of x:**\n    *   The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$ for the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n    *   The minimum value of $\\cos t$ is -1 (at $t=\\pi$).\n    *   The maximum value of $\\cos t$ is 1 (at $t=0$ and $t=2\\pi$).\n    *   So, the x-values range from -1 to 1.\n    *   The width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Finding the range of y:**\n    *   For the first part ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y = \\sin t$. The maximum value is 1 (at $t=\\pi/2$), and the minimum is 0.\n    *   For the second part ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y = 5\\sin t$. The minimum value of $\\sin t$ in this interval is -1 (at $t=3\\pi/2$), so the minimum y-value is $5 \\times (-1) = -5$. The maximum y-value approaches 0 as t approaches $\\pi$ or $2\\pi$.\n    *   Combining both parts, the overall y-values range from -5 to 1.\n    *   The height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Smallest Circumscribing Square**\n\nWe have determined that the figure fits perfectly inside a rectangle with a width of 2 and a height of 6. A square that \"outcircles\" (circumscribes) this figure must be large enough to contain this bounding rectangle.\n\n*   The side length of the square must be at least as large as the largest dimension of the rectangle.\n*   Side Length = $\\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n*   Therefore, the smallest square that can outcircle the figure has a side length of 6.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Square**\n\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\n\n*   Area = $(\\text{side length})^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\nThe area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure is 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
