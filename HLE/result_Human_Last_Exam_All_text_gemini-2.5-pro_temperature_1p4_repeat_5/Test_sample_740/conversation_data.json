    "An step-by-step analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of the integral equation.**\nThe given equation is:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy K(x, y) u(y), where the kernel is K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y).\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, of the form u = f + λ L(u), where f(x) = 1 is the forcing term and L is the integral operator with kernel K(x,y).\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the kernel.**\nThe kernel can be written as a sum of products of functions of x and y. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we have:\nK(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + xⁿ⁻³y² + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k.\nThis shows that K(x, y) is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. It is also symmetric, i.e., K(x, y) = K(y, x). Since the kernel is real and symmetric, the integral operator L is self-adjoint, and all its characteristic values are real.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fredholm Alternative Theorem.**\nFor a Fredholm equation with a symmetric kernel, the Fredholm Alternative states:\n1.  If λ is not a characteristic value (i.e., the homogeneous equation φ = λ L(φ) has only the trivial solution φ=0), then the inhomogeneous equation u = f + λ L(u) has a unique solution for any f.\n2.  If λ is a characteristic value, the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the forcing term f is orthogonal to all the eigenfunctions φ corresponding to λ. The orthogonality condition is ∫ f(x)φ(x) dx = 0.\n    - If the condition is met, there are infinitely many solutions.\n    - If the condition is not met, there is no solution.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the eigenfunctions and the orthogonality condition.**\nIn our case, f(x) = 1. The orthogonality condition is ∫₀¹ 1 · φ(x) dx = 0.\nSo, for a characteristic value λ, the equation has no solution if and only if there exists a corresponding eigenfunction φ such that ∫₀¹ φ(x) dx ≠ 0.\n\nLet's find the properties of the eigenfunctions. An eigenfunction φ must satisfy:\nφ(x) = λ L(φ)(x) = λ ∫₀¹ (∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k) φ(y) dy.\nLet's define the moments C_k = ∫₀¹ y^k φ(y) dy. Then the eigenfunction can be written as:\nφ(x) = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) C_k x^(n-1-k).\nThis shows that any eigenfunction φ(x) must be a polynomial of degree at most n-1. The space of polynomials of degree at most n-1, P_(n-1), is an n-dimensional space. The operator L maps P_(n-1) into itself. Therefore, there are exactly n characteristic values (counting multiplicity).\n\n**Step 5: Check the orthogonality condition, ∫₀¹ φ(x) dx ≠ 0.**\nThe integral of an eigenfunction is:\n∫₀¹ φ(x) dx = ∫₀¹ (λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) C_k x^(n-1-k)) dx = C₀.\nSo the orthogonality condition becomes C₀ = 0.\n\nWe need to determine if it is possible for an eigenfunction to have C₀ = 0.\nIf C₀ = 0, then the expression for φ becomes:\nφ(x) = λ ∑_(k=1)^(n-1) C_k x^(n-1-k).\nThe coefficient of x^(n-1) in φ(x) is λC₀. If C₀=0, this coefficient is zero, which means that φ(x) must be a polynomial of degree at most n-2.\n\nSubstituting φ(x) back into the definition of C_j, we get a system of linear equations for the coefficients C_k. If we assume C₀=0, the system must hold. This implies constraints on the other coefficients C₁, ..., C_(n-1). A detailed analysis (as shown for n=2 and n=3 in the thought process) shows that C₀=0 implies that all C_k=0, which means φ(x)=0 (the trivial solution). Since eigenfunctions are by definition non-trivial, it follows that for any eigenfunction φ, we must have C₀ = ∫₀¹ φ(x) dx ≠ 0.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the final answer.**\nSince for any characteristic value λ, the corresponding eigenfunction φ is not orthogonal to the forcing term f(x)=1 (i.e., ∫φ dx ≠ 0), the inhomogeneous equation will have no solution for these values of λ.\nTherefore, the given equation has no solution if and only if λ is a characteristic value of the integral equation.\n\nThe characteristic values are the n real, non-zero numbers λ for which the homogeneous equation φ(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(x,y) φ(y) dy has a non-trivial solution."
