    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question lies in identifying a \"conceptual entity\" that Fernand Braudel mentioned by quoting Paul Morand. The key characteristics of this entity are that it is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation\" and should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n\n2.  **Locate the Source:** The reference comes from Fernand Braudel's work. Specifically, the quote appears in the introduction to Volume 3 of his magnum opus, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*. The volume is titled *The Perspective of the World*.\n\n3.  **Identify the Quote:** Braudel is introducing his concept of the \"world-economy\" (*économie-monde*) and uses a quote from the French writer Paul Morand to illustrate the necessity of a global perspective.\n\n4.  **Examine the Exact Wording:** Braudel writes (in the English translation): \"In the 1920s, Paul Morand remarked in a fine phrase, ‘Our plural *civilizations*…’ which should, he said, like the symbol of a nation, be ‘inscribed inside a sphere’.\"\n\n5.  **Isolate the Entity:** The question asks for the entity from *Paul Morand's assertion*. According to Braudel's text, the subject of Morand's phrase is explicitly stated. The entity that should be inscribed within a sphere is **\"plural civilizations\"**.\n\n6.  **Interpret the Metaphor:** The instruction to \"inscribe within a sphere\" means to understand the concept not in isolation but as part of a larger, interconnected global system. The example \"like the symbol of a nation\" suggests that just as a nation is a single political unit within the world, a civilization is a single cultural unit that must also be viewed within a global context.\n\n7.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** While Braudel uses this idea to support his own theory of the \"world-economy,\" the entity specifically named in the quote by Paul Morand is **civilization**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Attribution:** It is crucial to distinguish between Braudel's own central concept (world-economy) and the concept he is quoting from Paul Morand. The question specifically asks about Morand's assertion.\n*   **The Role of the \"Nation\":** The \"nation\" is given as an *example* or an analogy for the entity, not the entity itself. It helps to clarify the scale and context.\n*   **The Metaphor of the \"Sphere\":** This is central to the question. It signifies a global, all-encompassing, and interconnected viewpoint, which was a cornerstone of Braudel's historical approach.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the entity from the original quote.\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
