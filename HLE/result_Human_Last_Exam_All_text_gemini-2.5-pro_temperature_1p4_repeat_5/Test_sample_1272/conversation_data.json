    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical context and key figures.**\nThe question asks about the Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and his first major defeat in Vietnam. This event took place during the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), a Vietnamese war of independence led by Lê Lợi against the rule of the Ming Dynasty. Mu Sheng was one of the primary Ming generals tasked with suppressing this rebellion.\n\n**Step 2: Differentiate between Mu Sheng's campaigns and defeats.**\nMu Sheng was involved in several campaigns in Vietnam and suffered more than one defeat. It is important to identify the *first major* one.\n*   **The Tốt Động-Chúc Động campaign (1426):** This was a catastrophic defeat for the Ming army. However, the overall commander was Wang Tong (Vương Thông). Mu Sheng was not present and was not the commander who was defeated here.\n*   **The final relief campaign (1427):** Two massive Ming armies were sent to break the siege of Dongguan (Hanoi). One, led by Liu Sheng, was annihilated at Chi Lăng. Mu Sheng commanded the other army coming from Yunnan. After hearing of Liu Sheng's fate, Mu Sheng's demoralized army was also attacked and defeated, forcing him to retreat. While a major defeat, this was not his first one.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the first major defeat in 1425.**\nWe must look at earlier events. In late 1424 and early 1425, Lê Lợi's forces moved from their mountain base into the populous plains, winning a series of victories and capturing the key citadel of Trà Lân in Nghệ An. They then proceeded to besiege the provincial capital of Nghệ An city, trapping the Ming commander Chen Zhi inside. In response, Mu Sheng personally led a large relief army from Dongguan (Hanoi) south to break the siege.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific battle and its location.**\nAnticipating this relief effort, Lê Lợi's generals, including Lê Sát and Đinh Liệt, prepared an ambush. They engaged Mu Sheng's army at the **Khả Lưu Pass** (Ải Khả Lưu). The Ming army was routed in the ensuing battle. Mu Sheng himself narrowly escaped and was forced to flee back north to Dongguan.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the significance of this battle.**\nThis Battle of Khả Lưu in 1425 was a significant turning point.\n*   It was a **major defeat** as a large relief army, led by one of the top Ming commanders, was decisively beaten.\n*   It was Mu Sheng's **first** major personal defeat in the war, predating the events of 1426 and 1427.\n*   The victory allowed Lê Lợi's forces to consolidate their control over the vast and resource-rich regions of Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa, providing the foundation for their ultimate victory.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the current Vietnamese province.**\nHistorical records place the Khả Lưu Pass, the site of the battle, in what is now **Anh Sơn District**. Anh Sơn District is an administrative unit within the modern-day **Nghệ An Province** in the North Central Coast region of Vietnam.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
