    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n**1. Define the building blocks**\n*   **Symbols:** T, F, !, &, |, (, )\n*   **Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Goal:** The expression must evaluate to True.\n*   **Operands:** T (True), F (False).\n*   **Operators:** ! (unary NOT), & (binary AND), | (binary OR).\n*   **Precedence:** `!` has the highest precedence, then `&`, then `|`. Parentheses `()` can be used to override precedence.\n\n**2. Systematic classification of expressions**\nA well-formed boolean expression (of length > 1) must have a top-level operator. We can classify all possible 5-symbol expressions by their top-level syntactic structure. The main operator can be:\n1.  Parentheses: `(E)`\n2.  Unary NOT: `!E`\n3.  Binary AND/OR: `E1 op E2`\n\nWe will analyze each case to find the number of true expressions.\n\n---\n\n### Case A: Expressions of the form `(E)`\n\nIf the entire expression is of the form `(E)`, its length is `2 + len(E)`.\nSince the total length is 5, the inner expression `E` must have a length of 3.\nFor `(E)` to be True, `E` must evaluate to True.\n\nSo, we need to find all 3-symbol expressions `E` that evaluate to True.\nThe possible structures for a 3-symbol expression `E` are:\n*   `A op B` (where `op` is `&` or `|`, and `A`, `B` are `T` or `F`).\n    *   `T & T` -> True. So, `(T&T)` is a valid 5-symbol true expression.\n    *   `T | T` -> True. So, `(T|T)` is a valid expression.\n    *   `T | F` -> True. So, `(T|F)` is a valid expression.\n    *   `F | T` -> True. So, `(F|T)` is a valid expression.\n    (4 expressions)\n*   `!!A` (double negation).\n    *   `!!T` -> `!F` -> True. So, `(!!T)` is a valid expression.\n    *   `!!F` -> `!T` -> False.\n    (1 expression)\n*   `(A)` (parenthesized literal).\n    *   `(T)` -> True. So, `((T))` is a valid 5-symbol true expression.\n    *   `(F)` -> False.\n    (1 expression)\n\n**Total for Case A: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 expressions.**\n\n---\n\n### Case B: Expressions of the form `!E`\n\nIf the expression is of the form `!E`, its length is `1 + len(E)`.\nSince the total length is 5, the inner expression `E` must have a length of 4.\nFor `!E` to be True, `E` must evaluate to False.\n\nSo, we need to find all 4-symbol expressions `E` that evaluate to False, such that `!E` is a valid 5-symbol string.\nThe possible structures for a 4-symbol expression `E` are:\n*   `!(A)`\n    *   `!(T)` -> False. The full expression `!!(T)` is of length 5 and evaluates to True.\n    (1 expression)\n*   `(!A)`\n    *   `(!T)` -> False. The full expression `!(!T)` is of length 5 and evaluates to True.\n    (1 expression)\n*   `!!!A`\n    *   `!!!T` -> `!(!T)` -> `!F` -> False. The full expression `!!!!T` is of length 5 and evaluates to True.\n    (1 expression)\n*   `((A))`\n    *   `((F))` -> False. The full expression `!((F))` is of length 5 and evaluates to True.\n    (1 expression)\n*   Binary operations like `!A op B` (e.g., `!T&T`). `E` would be `!T&T`. The full expression is `!(!T&T)`. Due to operator precedence, this would be interpreted as `!((!T)&T)`, which requires parentheses for the outer `!` to apply to the whole sub-expression, making the total length 6. Thus, no 5-symbol expressions of this form exist.\n\n**Total for Case B: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 expressions.**\n\n---\n\n### Case C: Expressions of the form `E1 op E2`\n\nIf the expression is `E1 op E2`, its length is `len(E1) + 1 + len(E2)`.\nSince the total length is 5, `len(E1) + len(E2)` must equal 4. We analyze the possible length combinations for `(E1, E2)`.\n\n*   **Subcase C1: `(len(E1), len(E2)) = (1, 3)`**\n    `E1` is an operand `A` (T or F). `E2` is a 3-symbol expression.\n    *   If `E2` is `(B)`: The form is `A op (B)`, which evaluates based on `A op B`. We need this to be true.\n        *   `T & (T)` -> True.\n        *   `T | (T)` -> True.\n        *   `T | (F)` -> True.\n        *   `F | (T)` -> True.\n        (4 expressions)\n    *   If `E2` is `!!B`: The form is `A op !!B`, which evaluates based on `A op B`. We need this to be true.\n        *   `T & !!T` -> True.\n        *   `T | !!T` -> True.\n        *   `T | !!F` -> True.\n        *   `F | !!T` -> True.\n        (4 expressions)\n\n*   **Subcase C2: `(len(E1), len(E2)) = (2, 2)`**\n    `E1` and `E2` must both be 2-symbol expressions. The only valid structure is `!A`. So the form is `!A op !B`. We need this to be true.\n    *   `!F & !F` (`T&T`) -> True.\n    *   `!T | !F` (`F|T`) -> True.\n    *   `!F | !T` (`T|F`) -> True.\n    *   `!F | !F` (`T|T`) -> True.\n    (4 expressions)\n\n*   **Subcase C3: `(len(E1), len(E2)) = (3, 1)`**\n    This is symmetric to Subcase C1. The form is `E1 op B`.\n    *   If `E1` is `(A)`: The form is `(A) op B`, which evaluates based on `A op B`.\n        *   `(T) & T` -> True.\n        *   `(T) | T` -> True.\n        *   `(F) | T` -> True.\n        *   `(T) | F` -> True.\n        (4 expressions)\n    *   If `E1` is `!!A`: The form is `!!A op B`, which evaluates based on `A op B`.\n        *   `!!T & T` -> True.\n        *   `!!T | T` -> True.\n        *   `!!F | T` -> True.\n        *   `!!T | F` -> True.\n        (4 expressions)\n\n**Total for Case C: (4+4) + 4 + (4+4) = 20 expressions.**\n\n---\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the counts from all disjoint cases:\nTotal = (Case A) + (Case B) + (Case C)\nTotal = 6 + 4 + 20 = 30\n\nThere are 30 distinct, well-formed boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols that evaluate to True.\n\n<<<30>>>"
