    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core physical process: Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC).**\nSPDC is a quantum optical phenomenon belonging to the class of second-order nonlinear optical processes. In this process, a single high-energy photon (called the \"pump\") interacts with a nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\"). For this process to occur, energy and momentum must be conserved.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the fundamental material requirement for SPDC.**\nAll second-order nonlinear optical processes, including SPDC and the more commonly discussed second-harmonic generation (SHG), are governed by the material's **second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, χ⁽²⁾**. For a material to exhibit SPDC, it must have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the material requirement (non-zero χ⁽²⁾) to a physical property of the material.**\nA fundamental principle of nonlinear optics dictates that for a material to possess a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) in the electric dipole approximation, its crystal structure must **lack a center of inversion**. Materials that have a center of inversion are called \"centrosymmetric\". In such materials, the response to an applied electric field (+E) is symmetrically equivalent to the response to a field in the opposite direction (-E), which forces all even-order susceptibility tensors, including χ⁽²⁾, to be zero.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the specific material in question: Free-standing boron nanosheets.**\n\"Boron nanosheet\" is a general term for a two-dimensional (2D) sheet of boron atoms, also known as \"borophene\". A critical point to consider is that borophene exhibits **polymorphism**, meaning it can exist in many different stable or metastable atomic arrangements (phases or polymorphs). The properties of a boron nanosheet, including its crystal symmetry, depend heavily on its specific polymorph.\n\n**Step 5: Examine the crystal symmetry of common boron nanosheet polymorphs.**\nTo determine if boron nanosheets would exhibit SPDC, we must check if their crystal structures are centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric.\n*   **Common, Stable Phases (e.g., β₁₂ and χ₃):** The most widely studied phases of borophene, which have been synthesized on metallic substrates and are also predicted to be among the most stable free-standing forms, are the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases. Both of these structures possess a center of inversion. They are **centrosymmetric**.\n*   **Consequence for Common Phases:** Because these common phases are centrosymmetric, their χ⁽²⁾ is zero. Therefore, free-standing nanosheets of β₁₂-borophene or χ₃-borophene would **not** be expected to exhibit SPDC. They can, however, exhibit third-order nonlinear effects (which depend on χ⁽³⁾) as these do not require a lack of inversion symmetry.\n*   **Other Theoretical Phases (e.g., β₈):** Theoretical calculations have predicted the existence of other, less common borophene polymorphs. Some of these, like the buckled **β₈** phase, are predicted to be **non-centrosymmetric**.\n*   **Consequence for Other Phases:** If it were possible to fabricate a free-standing boron nanosheet in a non-centrosymmetric phase like β₈, this specific sheet *would* have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ and would be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\n### Conclusion of the Analysis\n\nThe answer to the question is conditional and depends entirely on the specific atomic arrangement (polymorph) of the boron nanosheet.\n\n1.  For the most common and stable phases of borophene (like β₁₂ and χ₃), the answer is **No**, because they are centrosymmetric.\n2.  For certain specific, less common, and theoretically predicted phases (like β₈), the answer is **Yes**, because they are non-centrosymmetric.\n\nSince the question asks what \"would be expected\", this usually refers to the most common or stable configuration. As the most stable predicted free-standing forms are centrosymmetric, the general expectation is that boron nanosheets would not exhibit SPDC. The phenomenon is possible, but only in specific, non-standard structural phases.\n\n***\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would generally not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because the most stable and commonly studied phases of borophene (such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ structures) are centrosymmetric. Materials with a center of inversion have a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is a fundamental requirement for SPDC to occur. While it is theoretically possible for specific, non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of borophene to exhibit SPDC, these are not the generally expected forms."
