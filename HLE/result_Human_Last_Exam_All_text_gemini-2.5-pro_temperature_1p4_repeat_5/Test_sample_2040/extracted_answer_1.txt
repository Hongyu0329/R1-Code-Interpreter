No, free-standing boron nanosheets would generally not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because the most stable and commonly studied phases of borophene (such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ structures) are centrosymmetric. Materials with a center of inversion have a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is a fundamental requirement for SPDC to occur. While it is theoretically possible for specific, non-centrosymmetric polymorphs of borophene to exhibit SPDC, these are not the generally expected forms.
