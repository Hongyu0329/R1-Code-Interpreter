    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core question.**\nThe question asks for the name of the US city that the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, moves to in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the characters and premise.**\n*   **Film:** *Ovosodo* (English title: *Hard Boiled Egg*), directed by Paolo Virzì.\n*   **Character:** Tommaso Paladini.\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci.\n*   **Plot Point:** Does this character move to the United States in the film?\n    *   Yes, the plot confirms this. Tommaso is the best friend of the protagonist, Piero Mansani. While Piero stays in their hometown of Livorno, Tommaso becomes a highly successful and wealthy stockbroker.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the character's journey and the significance of the move.**\n*   Tommaso's character arc is one of ambition and upward mobility, contrasting with Piero's more static, provincial life.\n*   His move to the United States symbolizes the peak of his success and his embrace of a globalized, capitalist world, leaving his Italian roots behind.\n*   The choice of the city would likely be symbolic of finance, ambition, and the \"yuppie\" culture of the 1990s.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the specific city mentioned in the film.**\n*   By reviewing detailed plot summaries and analyses of *Ovosodo*, we can find the specific location.\n*   In the film's narrative, after achieving great success in finance, Tommaso informs Piero that he is moving.\n*   The city he moves to is **New York City**, a global center of finance and a classic symbol of achieving the \"American Dream\" in that context. The move to New York serves as the ultimate marker of his success and his divergence from Piero's life.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   Ensure not to confuse the character in question, Tommaso (Piero's friend), with the film's main protagonist, Piero Mansani, who remains in Livorno.\n*   Verify the actor-character pairing is correct (Marco Cocci as Tommaso).\n*   Confirm the move to the US is an actual plot point and not a misremembered detail.\n*   The city's name is explicitly stated or strongly implied within the film's context to be New York City.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
