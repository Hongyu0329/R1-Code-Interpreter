    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the curve and the prime.**\n    The curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\n    This is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = F(x)$, where $F(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\n    The degree of $F(x)$ is $d=5$. The genus of the curve is $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n    We are interested in the stable reduction over the prime $p=2$. This means we are working over the field of 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n2.  **Determine the branch points and their valuations.**\n    The branch points of the hyperelliptic curve are the roots of the polynomial $F(x)$ plus the point at infinity, as the degree of $F(x)$ is odd.\n    $F(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$.\n    One root is $r_0 = 0$.\n    The other four roots are the roots of the polynomial $G(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\n    To find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $G(x)$, we use the Newton polygon method for $p=2$. The vertices of the polygon are given by $(i, v_2(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$ in $G(x)$.\n    The coefficients of $G(x)$ are $a_4=8, a_3=4, a_2=4, a_1=1, a_0=8$.\n    The points for the Newton polygon are:\n    - $(0, v_2(a_0)) = (0, v_2(8)) = (0, 3)$\n    - $(1, v_2(a_1)) = (1, v_2(1)) = (1, 0)$\n    - $(2, v_2(a_2)) = (2, v_2(4)) = (2, 2)$\n    - $(3, v_2(a_3)) = (3, v_2(4)) = (3, 2)$\n    - $(4, v_2(a_4)) = (4, v_2(8)) = (4, 3)$\n\n    The lower convex hull of these points has two segments:\n    a) A segment from $(0, 3)$ to $(1, 0)$. The horizontal length is $1-0=1$. The slope is $(0-3)/(1-0)=-3$. This corresponds to one root, let's call it $r_1$, with valuation $v_2(r_1) = -(\\text{slope}) = 3$.\n    b) A segment from $(1, 0)$ to $(4, 3)$. The horizontal length is $4-1=3$. The slope is $(3-0)/(4-1)=1$. This corresponds to three roots, $r_2, r_3, r_4$, each with valuation $v_2(r_i) = -(\\text{slope}) = -1$.\n\n    So, the finite branch points are $\\{0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$ with valuations $v_2(0)=\\infty, v_2(r_1)=3, v_2(r_2)=v_2(r_3)=v_2(r_4)=-1$.\n    The full set of 6 branch points is $\\mathcal{B} = \\{0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, \\infty\\}$.\n\n3.  **Identify the clusters of branch points.**\n    Two branch points $b_i, b_j$ are in the same cluster if $v_2(b_i - b_j) > 0$. The analysis is simpler if we move the point at infinity to a finite point. We do this by the transformation $x \\to 1/x$.\n    The new curve has branch points which are the reciprocals of the original ones. The new set of branch points is $\\mathcal{B}' = \\{\\infty, 1/r_1, 1/r_2, 1/r_3, 1/r_4, 0\\}$.\n    The valuations of these new branch points are:\n    - $v_2(1/r_1) = -v_2(r_1) = -3$.\n    - $v_2(1/r_i) = -v_2(r_i) = 1$ for $i=2,3,4$.\n    - $v_2(0) = \\infty$.\n    - We treat $\\infty$ formally. The rule is $v_2(b - \\infty) = -v_2(b)$.\n\n    Let's find the clusters for $\\mathcal{B}'$.\n    - Cluster around $0$: $v_2(0 - b') = v_2(b')$. We need $v_2(b')>0$. This is true for $b' \\in \\{1/r_2, 1/r_3, 1/r_4\\}$. So $\\{0, 1/r_2, 1/r_3, 1/r_4\\}$ might be in a cluster. Let's check them against each other: $v_2(1/r_i - 1/r_j) = v_2((r_j - r_i)/(r_ir_j)) = v_2(r_j-r_i) - v_2(r_i) - v_2(r_j)$. Since the residual polynomial for the roots $r_{2,3,4}$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, we have $v_2(r_j-r_i) = -1$ for $i\\neq j$. So, $v_2(1/r_i-1/r_j) = -1 - (-1) - (-1) = 1 > 0$. Thus, $C_1 = \\{0, 1/r_2, 1/r_3, 1/r_4\\}$ forms a cluster of size 4.\n\n    - Cluster around $\\infty$: $v_2(\\infty - b') = -v_2(b')$. We need $-v_2(b')>0$. This is true for $b'=1/r_1$ since $-v_2(1/r_1)=-(-3)=3>0$. So, $C_2 = \\{\\infty, 1/r_1\\}$ forms a cluster of size 2.\n\n    - We check that there are no \"cross-cluster\" connections. For any $b_1 \\in C_1$ and $b_2 \\in C_2$, we have $v_2(b_1 - b_2) \\le 0$. For instance, $v_2(0-1/r_1) = -3 \\le 0$, and $v_2(1/r_2 - \\infty) = -v_2(1/r_2)=-1 \\le 0$.\n\n    So, we have two clusters: $C_1$ of size 4, and $C_2$ of size 2.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure of the stable reduction.**\n    The stable reduction of the curve will have a component for each cluster. So, there are two irreducible components in the special fiber of the stable model, let's call them $K_1$ and $K_2$.\n    The genus of each component $K_i$ corresponding to a cluster $C_i$ is given by the formula $g(K_i) = \\lfloor(\\#C_i - 1)/2\\rfloor$.\n    - For $K_1$ (from $C_1$ of size 4): $g_1 = \\lfloor(4-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor 3/2 \\rfloor = 1$. This component is an elliptic curve.\n    - For $K_2$ (from $C_2$ of size 2): $g_2 = \\lfloor(2-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor 1/2 \\rfloor = 0$. This component is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n\n5.  **Calculate the number of double points.**\n    The arithmetic genus of a stable curve is given by $g = \\sum g_i + h^1(\\Gamma)$, where $\\Gamma$ is the dual graph of the components. $h^1(\\Gamma) = (\\text{number of edges}) - (\\text{number of vertices}) + 1$ for a connected graph.\n    The number of double points in the stable reduction is the number of edges in the dual graph $\\Gamma$. The number of vertices is the number of components.\n    In our case, the total genus is $g=2$, we have two components ($K_1, K_2$), so $\\#V=2$. The genera of the components are $g_1=1$ and $g_2=0$.\n    Plugging into the formula:\n    $2 = (g_1 + g_2) + (\\#\\text{edges} - \\#\\text{vertices} + 1)$\n    $2 = (1 + 0) + (\\#\\text{edges} - 2 + 1)$\n    $2 = 1 + (\\#\\text{edges} - 1)$\n    $2 = \\#\\text{edges}$\n    The number of edges is 2. Since each edge in the dual graph corresponds to a double point (node) where two components intersect, the stable reduction has 2 double points.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n- The curve has genus 2.\n- The 6 branch points partition into two clusters under the 2-adic valuation: one of size 4 and one of size 2.\n- These clusters correspond to two components in the stable reduction.\n- The component from the size-4 cluster has genus 1.\n- The component from the size-2 cluster has genus 0.\n- The formula for the arithmetic genus implies that these two components must intersect at 2 points to make the total genus equal to 2.\n- These 2 intersection points are the double points of the stable reduction.\n\n<<<2>>>"
