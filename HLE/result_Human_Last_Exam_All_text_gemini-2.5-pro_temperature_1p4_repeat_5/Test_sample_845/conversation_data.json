    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Technology Used:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture beat-to-beat intervals. PPG works by shining light into the skin and measuring how much light is absorbed or reflected. Changes in blood volume with each heartbeat alter the light absorption, creating a waveform.\n    *   **Measurement:** The system tracks \"beat-to-beat intervals.\" This explicitly means it's measuring the time that elapses between one heartbeat and the next.\n    *   **Computation:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is computed from these intervals.\n    *   **Core Question:** What is the specific name for the \"value between heartbeats\" that is used to compute HRV?\n\n2.  **Analyze the Process:**\n    *   A heartbeat causes the heart's ventricles to contract. In an electrocardiogram (ECG), this event is marked by a prominent spike called the \"R-wave\" within the QRS complex.\n    *   The time between two consecutive R-waves is the fundamental measurement for HRV analysis. This is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   PPG detects the pulse wave that results from the heart's contraction. While not a direct measure of electrical activity like an ECG, the peak of the PPG waveform corresponds closely in time to the R-wave of the ECG.\n    *   Therefore, the time interval between consecutive peaks in a PPG signal is the proxy for the R-R interval. This is sometimes called the Peak-to-Peak (P-P) interval or, more generally, the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\n3.  **Identify Careful Points & Key Terminology:**\n    *   **Distinction between HR and HRV:** Heart Rate (HR) is the average number of beats in a given time period (e.g., beats per minute). HRV is the measure of the *variation* in the timing *between* those beats. A high HRV generally indicates a more resilient and adaptable physiological state.\n    *   **Distinction between the Raw Data and the Computed Metric:** The question asks for the name of the raw data point (the time interval), not the final HRV metric. Final HRV metrics have names like SDNN (Standard Deviation of Normal-to-Normal intervals) or RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences). These are calculated *from* a series of the intervals.\n    *   **ECG vs. PPG Terminology:** The gold standard for HRV is ECG, where the term **R-R interval** is universally used. Because PPG is used as a convenient proxy for ECG in consumer devices, the term \"R-R interval\" is very often used even when the data comes from a PPG sensor. \"Inter-Beat Interval\" (IBI) is a more general term that is also correct and applies to both technologies.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Answer:**\n    *   The \"value between heartbeats\" is the duration of the time interval between one beat and the next.\n    *   This interval is the fundamental piece of data used to calculate all HRV metrics.\n    *   The most common and standard name for this value in the context of HRV is the **R-R interval**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe value representing the time duration between successive heartbeats, which is used as the basis for calculating Heart Rate Variability (HRV), is called the R-R interval or Inter-Beat Interval (IBI). The most scientifically standard term originating from ECG is the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
