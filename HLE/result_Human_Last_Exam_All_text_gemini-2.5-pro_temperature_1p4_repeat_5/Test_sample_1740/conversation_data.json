    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the let-7 Family:** The let-7 family is a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are highly conserved across different species. Members of a miRNA family share a nearly identical \"seed sequence,\" a short region of nucleotides that is crucial for determining which messenger RNAs (mRNAs) they target and regulate. The let-7 family primarily acts as a tumor suppressor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Authoritative Source:** To find the most accurate and up-to-date count, we must consult the primary repository for miRNA data, which is miRBase (mirbase.org). Scientific literature and review articles also provide context.\n\n3.  **Distinguish Between Precursor Genes and Mature miRNAs:** This is the most critical point for answering this question correctly.\n    *   **Mature miRNA:** The short, single-stranded RNA molecule (~22 nucleotides) that is the final, functional product. For example, `hsa-let-7a-5p`.\n    *   **Precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA):** The gene transcript from a specific location on a chromosome, which folds into a hairpin structure and is later processed to become a mature miRNA. For example, `hsa-mir-let-7a-1`.\n    *   Crucially, different precursor genes located at different places in the genome can be processed into the exact same mature miRNA.\n\n4.  **Count the Unique Mature let-7 Family Members:** First, let's identify the number of unique mature miRNAs in the human let-7 family. These are the distinct functional molecules. According to miRBase, this list includes:\n    *   let-7a\n    *   let-7b\n    *   let-7c\n    *   let-7d\n    *   let-7e\n    *   let-7f\n    *   let-7g\n    *   let-7i\n    *   miR-98 (which is structurally and functionally part of the let-7 family)\n\n    This gives a total of **9** distinct mature let-7 family miRNAs.\n\n5.  **Count the Precursor Genes (Genomic Loci):** Now, let's count the number of genes that encode these mature miRNAs. This number is different because some mature miRNAs are encoded by more than one gene. In humans, the precursor genes are:\n    1.  `hsa-mir-let-7a-1`\n    2.  `hsa-mir-let-7a-2`\n    3.  `hsa-mir-let-7a-3` (all three produce mature let-7a)\n    4.  `hsa-mir-let-7b`\n    5.  `hsa-mir-let-7c`\n    6.  `hsa-mir-let-7d`\n    7.  `hsa-mir-let-7e`\n    8.  `hsa-mir-let-7f-1`\n    9.  `hsa-mir-let-7f-2` (both produce mature let-7f)\n    10. `hsa-mir-let-7g`\n    11. `hsa-mir-let-7i`\n    12. `hsa-mir-98`\n\n    Counting these distinct precursor genes gives a total of **12** members.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The term \"members\" can be ambiguous. However, in genomics and molecular biology literature, when a single number is cited for the size of the human let-7 family, it almost always refers to the number of precursor genes. Therefore, the most accurate and comprehensive answer is 12.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are 12 precursor genes that give rise to the let-7 family of miRNAs in humans. These genes produce 9 distinct mature miRNAs. The most commonly cited number for let-7 family \"members\" in humans is the count of the genes.\n\n<<<12>>>"
