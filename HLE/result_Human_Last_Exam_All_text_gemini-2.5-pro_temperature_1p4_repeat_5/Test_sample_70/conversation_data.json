    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks to identify which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. There are two key components to this question:\n1.  Determining the rank of the Danish flag when viewed as a matrix.\n2.  The instruction: \"Assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal.\"\n\n### Step 2: Understanding \"Maximal Rank\" of a Flag Matrix\nA flag can be represented as a matrix `A` where each entry corresponds to a pixel, and the value of the entry corresponds to its color. If a flag has `k` distinct colors `{c_1, c_2, ..., c_k}`, we can assign a unique numerical value `v_i` to each color `c_i`.\n\nThe matrix `A` can be expressed as a linear combination of \"indicator matrices\" `M_i`, where `M_i` is a matrix of the same dimensions as the flag, with a `1` at positions where the color is `c_i` and `0` otherwise.\n`A = v_1*M_1 + v_2*M_2 + ... + v_k*M_k`\n\nThe rank of matrix `A` depends on the numerical values `v_i` chosen for the colors. The problem requires us to find the *maximal possible rank*. The maximal rank of `A` is the dimension of the vector space spanned by the indicator matrices `{M_1, M_2, ..., M_k}`.\n\nThese indicator matrices `{M_1, M_2, ..., M_k}` are always linearly independent. To see why, consider a linear combination that equals the zero matrix: `a_1*M_1 + a_2*M_2 + ... + a_k*M_k = 0`. For any color `c_i` on the flag, there is at least one pixel with that color. At that pixel's position, the matrix `M_i` has a `1` while all other matrices `M_j` (where `j â‰  i`) have a `0`. For the sum to be zero at that position, the coefficient `a_i` must be zero. Since this applies to all colors present, all coefficients `a_i` must be zero.\n\nTherefore, the set of indicator matrices is linearly independent, and the dimension of the space they span is equal to the number of matrices, `k`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The maximal linear algebraic rank of any flag is simply the number of distinct colors it contains. This simplifies the problem significantly, as we do not need to analyze the specific geometric patterns of the flags.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Rank of the Danish Flag\nThe flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross.\n- Color 1: Red\n- Color 2: White\nThe flag has exactly two distinct colors. Therefore, according to our analysis in Step 2, the maximal rank of the Danish flag matrix is **2**.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying African Flags with a Rank of 2\nThe task now is to find all national flags of African countries that have exactly two colors. We will survey the flags of the 54 sovereign states in Africa.\n\n*   **Flags with more than 2 colors:** The vast majority of African flags have three or more colors (e.g., Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, etc.). These all have a rank of 3 or higher.\n*   **Flags with exactly 2 colors:** We need to find the flags that fit this criterion.\n\nLet's examine the candidates:\n\n1.  **Morocco:** The flag of Morocco features a red field with a green pentagram (the Seal of Solomon) in the center. The colors are **Red** and **Green**. This is a two-color flag.\n    *   *Rank = 2.*\n\n2.  **Nigeria:** The flag of Nigeria is a vertical triband of green, white, and green. The colors are **Green** and **White**. This is a two-color flag.\n    *   *Rank = 2.*\n\n3.  **Somalia:** The flag of Somalia features a light blue field with a single white five-pointed star in the center. The colors are **Light Blue** and **White**. This is a two-color flag.\n    *   *Rank = 2.*\n\n4.  **Tunisia:** The flag of Tunisia features a red field with a white disc in the center. Inside the disc is a red star and crescent. The only colors used are **Red** and **White**. This is a two-color flag.\n    *   *Rank = 2.*\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to consider the current, official national flags. For instance, the flag of Mauritania had two colors until 2017, but the current flag has three (Green, Gold, Red).\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe flag of Denmark has a maximal rank of 2. The African nations whose flags also have a maximal rank of 2 are those with exactly two colors. Based on a survey of all African national flags, the countries that meet this condition are Morocco, Nigeria, Somalia, and Tunisia.\n\n<<<Morocco, Nigeria, Somalia, Tunisia>>>"
