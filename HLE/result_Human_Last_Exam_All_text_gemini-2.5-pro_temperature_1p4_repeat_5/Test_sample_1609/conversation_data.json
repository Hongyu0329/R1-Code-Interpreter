    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n*   **Boolean Function:** A function `f(x1, x2, ..., xn)` where inputs and outputs are binary (0 or 1). For `n` variables, there are `2^n` possible input combinations (minterms).\n*   **Implicant:** A product term (e.g., `x1*x2'`) is an implicant of a function `f` if, for every input combination where the term is 1, the function `f` is also 1.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant that cannot be generalized further. If you remove any literal from a prime implicant, it ceases to be an implicant of the function. Geometrically, on a Karnaugh map or a Boolean hypercube, prime implicants correspond to the largest possible groupings (subcubes) of 1s.\n*   **a(n):** The maximal number of prime implicants that any Boolean function of `n` variables can have. To find `a(n)`, we need to find a specific function of `n` variables that maximizes the count of its prime implicants.\n\n**2. Finding the Optimal Function Structure**\nIt is a known result in switching theory that for small values of `n` (specifically `n <= 5`), the maximum number of prime implicants is achieved by a specific type of symmetric Boolean function. This function is defined by the weight of its minterms (the number of 1s in the binary representation of the minterm).\n\nThe function `f` that maximizes the number of PIs is one where `f=1` for all minterms with weight `k` or `k+1`, for a specific choice of `k`. We denote the set of minterms with weight `i` as `L_i`. So the function is `f = L_k U L_{k+1}`.\n\n**3. Counting the Prime Implicants for the Optimal Function**\nFor a function `f = L_k U L_{k+1}`, a prime implicant is formed by combining an adjacent pair of minterms, one from `L_k` and one from `L_{k+1}`. Such a pair forms a 1-dimensional subcube (an edge in the Boolean n-cube graph). Each such edge corresponds to a unique prime implicant, and these are all the prime implicants for this function.\n\nThe number of prime implicants for this function is, therefore, the number of edges connecting the layer `L_k` to the layer `L_{k+1}`. This count can be calculated with the following formula:\n\nNumber of PIs = (Number of minterms in `L_{k+1}`) * (Number of connections from each minterm in `L_{k+1}` down to `L_k`)\nNumber of PIs = `|L_{k+1}| * (k+1)`\nNumber of PIs = `C(n, k+1) * (k+1)`\n\nwhere `C(n, r)` is the binomial coefficient \"n choose r\".\n\n**4. Finding the Optimal `k` for `n=4`**\nThe problem now is to find the value of `k` (from `0` to `n-1`) that maximizes the expression `(k+1) * C(n, k+1)` for `n=4`.\n\nLet's calculate this value for all possible `k` where `n=4`:\n*   **Case k=0:** The function is `f = L_0 U L_1`.\n    Number of PIs = `(0+1) * C(4, 0+1) = 1 * C(4, 1) = 1 * 4 = 4`.\n*   **Case k=1:** The function is `f = L_1 U L_2`.\n    Number of PIs = `(1+1) * C(4, 1+1) = 2 * C(4, 2) = 2 * 6 = 12`.\n*   **Case k=2:** The function is `f = L_2 U L_3`.\n    Number of PIs = `(2+1) * C(4, 2+1) = 3 * C(4, 3) = 3 * 4 = 12`.\n*   **Case k=3:** The function is `f = L_3 U L_4`.\n    Number of PIs = `(3+1) * C(4, 3+1) = 4 * C(4, 4) = 4 * 1 = 4`.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nBy evaluating all possible cases, we can see that the maximum number of prime implicants is 12. This maximum is achieved when we select the function `f = L_1 U L_2` (the set of all minterms with 1 or 2 ones) or `f = L_2 U L_3` (the set of all minterms with 2 or 3 ones).\n\nTherefore, a(4) is 12.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<12>>>"
