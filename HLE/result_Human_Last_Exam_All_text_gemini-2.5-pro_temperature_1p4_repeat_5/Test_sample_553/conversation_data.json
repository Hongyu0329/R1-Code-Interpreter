    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Musical Question:** The core of the question is a specific chord progression: \"a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\" that occurs at the beginning of a Beatles song.\n\n2.  **Translate Music Theory:**\n    *   **Tonic Chord (or \"I\" / \"i\"):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord that feels most stable and resolved. For example, in the key of C Major, the tonic is a C Major chord. In the key of A minor, the tonic is an A minor chord (spelled 'i' in lower case).\n    *   **Minor Fifth Chord (or \"v\"):** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale, but it is a minor chord.\n        *   In a **minor key**, the chord on the fifth note is naturally minor. For example, in the key of A minor, the notes are A-B-C-D-**E**-F-G. The fifth note is E. The natural chord built on E is E minor (E-G-B). So, a progression from the tonic (A minor) to the minor fifth (E minor) is written as **i - v**. This is a very natural and common progression in minor keys.\n        *   In a **major key**, the chord on the fifth note is naturally major (it's called the \"dominant\" or \"V\" chord). To make it minor (\"v\") would require changing a note, which is less common but used for specific effects.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Search Strategy:** Based on the theory, it's most likely we are looking for a song in a **minor key** that starts with a **i - v** progression.\n\n4.  **Analyze Candidate Beatles Songs:**\n    *   Let's consider famous Beatles songs, particularly those in minor keys or with distinctive chordal openings.\n    *   **\"Things We Said Today\":** This song is in the key of A minor. It opens immediately with the verse, and the chords alternate between A minor (the tonic, **i**) and E minor (the minor fifth, **v**). This is a strong candidate.\n    *   **\"Michelle\":** This song is in the key of F minor. It begins with a short, instrumental guitar intro that is played over the tonic F minor chord (**i**). Immediately after, the first vocal line begins.\n        *   On the word \"Mi-**chelle**...\", the chord is F minor (**i**).\n        *   On the words \"...ma **belle**\", the chord changes to C minor (**v**).\n        *   The key is F minor. The tonic is F minor. The fifth note is C. The minor chord on C is C minor. Therefore, the progression F minor -> C minor is **i -> v**.\n\n5.  **Compare the Candidates and Finalize:**\n    *   Both \"Things We Said Today\" and \"Michelle\" fit the description. However, the phrasing \"starts with a chord jump\" often implies a single, notable leap that defines the opening theme.\n    *   In \"Things We Said Today,\" the i - v progression is more of a repetitive pattern or vamp.\n    *   In \"Michelle,\" the progression from F minor to C minor is a single, distinctive \"jump\" that launches the main vocal melody and is directly tied to the song's title. This makes it a slightly more precise and iconic answer to the question. The move is a memorable and defining characteristic of the song's opening phrase.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Key Identification:** Correctly identifying the song's key is crucial to determine the tonic chord.\n*   **Roman Numeral Analysis:** Understanding that 'i' means a minor tonic and 'v' means a minor fifth is key to analyzing the progression.\n*   **\"Starts with\":** This phrase can be ambiguous. It could mean the absolute first chords or the chords that begin the main theme/verse. In this case, \"Michelle\" fits perfectly for the opening of the main theme.\n*   **Distinguishing between 'V' (Major) and 'v' (minor):** Many songs use a major fifth chord (V) for a stronger resolution back to the tonic. The question specifically asks for a **minor** fifth chord (v), which is a critical detail.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe song is \"Michelle\". It is in the key of F minor. After a brief intro on the tonic (F minor), the very first vocal phrase \"Michelle, ma belle\" uses the chord progression of F minor (**i**) to C minor (**v**), which is a perfect example of a jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
