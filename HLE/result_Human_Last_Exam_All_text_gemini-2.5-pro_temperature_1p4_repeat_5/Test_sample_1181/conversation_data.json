    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying detail is that this character expresses shame about missing a specific sound from Earth: the rustling of leaves. This requires knowledge of the film's characters and their specific dialogues.\n\n**Step 2: List and Analyze the Characters (The Answer Choices)**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist, a psychologist sent to the space station. His story is defined by his deep-seated memories and longing for Earth, particularly for his dacha and his deceased wife, Hari. He is not ashamed of this longing; rather, it is the central conflict of his experience.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"guest\" or \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his wife. As a construct of the Solaris ocean, she has no direct memories of Earth herself. Her struggle is with her own identity and artificial existence, not with a lost connection to Earth.\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** One of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He is world-weary, cynical, and philosophical. Having been on the station for a very long time, he often reflects on the psychological toll of their isolation and disconnection from humanity and Earth.\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** The other surviving scientist. He is cold, rational, and obsessed with the scientific aspects of their predicament. He treats the \"guests\" as research subjects and shows little patience for emotional or nostalgic sentiments, which he would likely view as a weakness.\n*   **E. Dr. Gibarian:** A scientist who has committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. Kris watches a video message left by Gibarian, who expresses despair and warns Kris about the phenomena on the station. He does not mention this specific feeling of shame about leaves.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Dialogue and Character**\n\nThe key to answering the question is recalling a specific, poignant conversation. The feeling of being \"ashamed to miss\" something is complex. It's not just missing Earth, but feeling guilty or diminished for having lost that connection.\n\n*   In a conversation with Kris in the station's vast library, it is **Dr. Snaut** who expresses this exact sentiment.\n*   He reflects on how long they have been in space and how they have become detached from their home. He confesses that he is sometimes ashamed of his feelings, or lack thereof.\n*   The line, in various translations, is along the lines of: \"I'm ashamed of it... when I think... not even of people... but of the rustling of leaves... I'm ashamed.\"\n*   This statement perfectly encapsulates Snaut's character: a man who has been isolated for so long that he fears he has lost a fundamental part of his humanity, and he is self-aware enough to be ashamed of this loss.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and Select the Correct Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis of the characters and the specific dialogue from the film, Dr. Snaut is the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth. This eliminates all other options.\n\n<<<C>>>"
