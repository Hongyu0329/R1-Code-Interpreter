    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal of the Algorithm:** The algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is designed to find the base-`c` representation of a non-negative integer `n`. For example, `IMAG(13, 2)` would produce the binary representation `(1101)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Basic Operations:** The algorithm consists of elementary arithmetic operations: assignment `(:=)`, integer division `(⌊x/c⌋)`, multiplication `(qc)`, subtraction `(x - qc)`, and comparison `(q > 0)`. In standard computational models, these operations on numbers that fit within a single machine word are considered to take constant time, denoted as `O(1)`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Code Structure:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Initialization):** This step performs a fixed number of basic operations (`i := 0`, `x := n`, etc.). Therefore, the time complexity of this step is constant, `O(1)`.\n    *   **Step 2 (The `while` loop):** This is the core of the algorithm. Its complexity depends on two factors: the cost of the operations inside the loop and the number of times the loop executes.\n    *   **Step 2.1 (Loop Body):** The body of the loop consists of four basic operations. As established, each takes `O(1)` time. Thus, the total time for one execution of the loop body is `O(1)`.\n    *   **Step 3 (Return):** This step returns the computed digits. The time taken is proportional to the number of digits, which is determined by the number of loop iterations.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Loop Iterations:**\n    The complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the `while` loop. We need to find out how many times it runs.\n    *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   Let's trace the value of `q` across iterations.\n    *   Before the loop starts (in Step 1), `q` is initialized to `q₀ = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   If the loop runs, in the first iteration (let's call it `k=1`), `x` becomes `q₀`, and the new quotient `q₁` is calculated as `q₁ = ⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   In the second iteration (`k=2`), `x` becomes `q₁`, and the new quotient `q₂` is `q₂ = ⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    *   In general, after the `k`-th iteration of the loop, the value of the quotient will be `q_k = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q_k` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`, which is true if `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    *   The number of times the loop executes is `k`. The loop will run as long as `n ≥ c^(k)`.\n    *   To find the number of iterations `k`, we can take the logarithm base `c` of the inequality `n ≥ c^k`:\n        `log_c(n) ≥ log_c(c^k)`\n        `log_c(n) ≥ k`\n    *   This means the number of iterations `k` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. More precisely, it is `⌊log_c(n)⌋` if `n` is not a power of `c`, and `log_c(n)` if it is.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Time Complexity:**\n    The total time complexity `T(n)` is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the time complexity of the loop body.\n    *   `T(n) = (Number of Iterations) × (Time per Iteration)`\n    *   `T(n) = O(log_c(n)) × O(1)`\n    *   `T(n) = O(log_c(n))`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Input Size:** The complexity is a function of the input value `n`. The base `c` is considered a constant (`c ≥ 2`).\n2.  **Cost of Arithmetic:** The analysis assumes standard `O(1)` cost for arithmetic operations. For arbitrarily large numbers (requiring multiple memory words), the cost of division and modulo can be higher, but for typical algorithm analysis, `O(1)` is the standard assumption.\n3.  **Logarithm Base:** In Big O notation, the base of the logarithm does not affect the complexity class. This is because of the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c` is a constant, `log_b(c)` is also a constant. Constant factors are ignored in Big O notation. Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe algorithm's execution time is determined by the number of times it can divide the input `n` by the base `c` before the result is less than `c`. This is fundamentally a logarithmic process. Each iteration reduces the magnitude of the number being processed by a factor of `c`. This leads to a number of iterations proportional to `log_c(n)`. Since each iteration takes constant time, the overall time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`, which is simplified to `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
