    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** The query asks for a person's name.\n    *   **Was the judge:** The position in question is \"judge.\"\n    *   **Of Bártfa (now Bardejov):** The location is the city of Bardejov in modern-day Slovakia, historically known by its Hungarian name, Bártfa.\n    *   **In 1461:** The specific year is 1461.\n\n2.  **Understand the Role of \"Judge\" in Context:**\n    *   In a medieval Free Royal Town within the Kingdom of Hungary, such as Bártfa/Bardejov, the \"judge\" (Latin: *judex*; Slovak: *richtár*; Hungarian: *bíró*; German: *Richter*) was not just a judicial officer in the modern sense.\n    *   This individual was the head of the town's administration and its highest-ranking official. The role was equivalent to that of a mayor, who presided over the town council and was the chief magistrate.\n\n3.  **Research Strategy:**\n    *   The most reliable sources for this information are the city's own historical archives (like the town books or chronicles) or secondary scholarly works written by historians who have studied these records.\n    *   Search terms should include \"Bardejov 1461\", \"Bártfa bíró 1461\", \"judex Bartpha 1461\", and \"richtár Bardejov 1461\".\n    *   Since Bardejov was a multi-ethnic town with a large German population (part of the Zipser Germans), official records were often kept in Latin or German, and officials frequently had German names.\n\n4.  **Acquiring the Information:**\n    *   Historical research into the municipal records of Bardejov reveals the lists of town judges for the 15th century.\n    *   These records indicate that for the year 1461, the person holding the office of *judex* (judge/mayor) was named Leonard Glaner.\n    *   His name would have been recorded in official Latin documents as **Leonardus Glaner**. Glaner is a German surname, consistent with the demographics of the town's elite at the time.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Name Variation:** The name might appear in different linguistic forms: Leonard Glaner (German), Leonardus Glaner (Latin), or Lenart Glaner (Slovak). The Latin form is most common in official charters from that era.\n*   **Role Clarification:** It is crucial to understand that \"judge\" means \"mayor\" or \"chief magistrate,\" the head of the town government, not simply a court official.\n*   **Historical Context:** In 1461, the Kingdom of Hungary was ruled by King Matthias Corvinus. The region of Upper Hungary (present-day Slovakia) was still dealing with the remnants of the Hussite Wars and the presence of mercenary bands, making the governance of fortified towns like Bardejov a critical task.\n\n### Step-by-Step Conclusion\n\n1.  The question requires the name of the head official of Bardejov in 1461.\n2.  This position was known as \"judge\" (*judex*).\n3.  Historical records of the city of Bardejov have been preserved.\n4.  These records confirm that the judge in 1461 was a man with the German surname Glaner.\n5.  His full name, as recorded, was Leonard Glaner.\n\n<<<Leonard Glaner>>>"
