    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the \"rule activation level\" in the context of an interval type-3 (IT3) fuzzy set. This term refers to the result of the fuzzy implication step, where the firing strength of a rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part) is combined with the membership function of the rule's consequent (the \"THEN\" part).\n\n**2. Identify the Components and Given Information:**\n*   **System Type:** Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Logic System. In such systems, membership grades are not single numbers but are represented by more complex structures. Specifically, for an IT3 set, the membership at any point is a type-2 fuzzy set, whose footprint of uncertainty (FOU) is bounded by an upper and a lower membership function. This results in interval-based calculations.\n*   **Antecedent Firing Strength (`Phi_k(x′)`):** This represents the degree to which the input `x'` satisfies the premise of the k-th rule. We are given `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. In an IT3 system, this firing strength would be an interval `[w_k^L, w_k^U]`. The single value provided (0.7) likely represents one of these bounds, typically the upper bound `w_k^U`.\n*   **Consequent Membership Degree (`μG_k_j(y_j)`):** This is the membership grade of a specific output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k` of the k-th rule. We are given `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. Similarly to the antecedent, in an IT3 system, this would be an interval `[μ_G^L(y_j), μ_G^U(y_j)]`. The single value (0.9) likely represents the upper bound `μ_G^U(y_j)`.\n*   **Operation:** The problem specifies using a **t-norm** operation. A t-norm is a function that models a fuzzy logic AND. In the context of implication, it's used to \"clip\" or \"scale\" the consequent fuzzy set.\n\n**3. Define the Calculation (Implication):**\nThe rule activation level is calculated by applying the t-norm to the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership degree.\n`Activation Level = t-norm(Antecedent_Firing_Strength, Consequent_Membership_Degree)`\n\n**4. Select a Specific T-norm:**\nThere are many types of t-norms. The most common ones used for fuzzy implication are:\n*   **Minimum (min):** `t-norm(a, b) = min(a, b)`. This is the most widely used t-norm for Mamdani-style implication.\n*   **Product (prod):** `t-norm(a, b) = a * b`. This is used for Larsen-style implication.\n\nIn the absence of a specific t-norm being named, the **minimum (min)** operator is the standard and most common choice.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation:**\nWe will proceed assuming the standard `min` t-norm.\n\n*   `Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n*   Substitute the given values:\n    `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   Calculate the result:\n    `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Simplification of IT3:** The problem simplifies the complexity of an Interval Type-3 system by providing single numerical values instead of intervals. This is a common simplification for textbook or exam questions. The core principle of applying a t-norm for implication remains the same, whether it's applied to single numbers or the bounds of intervals.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Rule Activation Level\":** This term refers to the membership degree in the *output* fuzzy set of the rule after the implication step is performed. It represents the height of the consequent fuzzy set after it has been modified by the rule's firing strength.\n*   **Choice of T-norm:** The choice of t-norm is crucial. If the problem had specified the `product` t-norm, the answer would have been `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`. However, without that specification, `min` is the default assumption.\n*   **Result Consistency:** The result of the implication `t-norm(w, μ)` can never be greater than the firing strength `w` or the original membership `μ`. Our result `0.7` is consistent with this, as `0.7 <= 0.7` and `0.7 <= 0.9`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe rule activation level is found by combining the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership function using a specified t-norm.\n\n1.  **Antecedent Firing Strength:** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n2.  **Consequent Membership:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n3.  **Operation:** t-norm (assumed to be `min`)\n4.  **Calculation:** `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
