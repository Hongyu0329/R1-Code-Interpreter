    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nCritical-level views are a family of theories in population ethics. The most common version is **Critical-Level Utilitarianism**. According to this view, the value of a population is calculated by summing up the welfare of each individual, but only after subtracting a certain positive \"critical level\" (*c*).\n\n*   The value of a population is: **V = Σ (wᵢ - c)**, where *wᵢ* is the welfare of individual *i* and *c* is the positive critical level.\n*   A life is worth adding to the world only if its welfare level is **above** the critical level (*w > c*), as this adds positive value.\n*   A life with welfare **below** the critical level (*w < c*) has a negative contribution to the total value. Adding such a life makes the world worse.\n*   A life with welfare **exactly at** the critical level (*w = c*) has a neutral contribution.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem shows that a set of seemingly desirable conditions for a population axiology cannot all be true at the same time. Let's analyze each condition and see how critical-level views (CLV) fare against them.\n\n**A. Egalitarian Dominance:**\n*   **Condition:** If population A and B have the same number of people, and every person in A is at least as well-off as the corresponding person in B, and at least one person in A is strictly better off, then population A is better than population B.\n*   **Analysis with CLV:** Let the value of A be Σ(w_Ai - c) and the value of B be Σ(w_Bi - c). If w_Ai ≥ w_Bi for all i and w_Aj > w_Bj for some j, then it follows that Σ(w_Ai) > Σ(w_Bi). Therefore, Σ(w_Ai - c) > Σ(w_Bi - c).\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Egalitarian Dominance.\n\n**B. General Non-Extreme Priority (Priority Principle):**\n*   **Condition:** Benefitting a person matters more the worse off that person is. For any given level of welfare, there is some benefit to a person below that level that is more important than some benefit to a person above that level.\n*   **Analysis with CLV:** Critical-level views are a form of utilitarianism. They give equal weight to a one-unit increase in welfare, regardless of whether the person receiving it is rich or poor. The value calculation is linear in welfare (V = Σ(wᵢ - c)). This is the opposite of the priority principle, which requires non-linear weighting.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **violate** the Priority Principle. This is a possible answer.\n\n**C. Non-Elitism:**\n*   **Condition:** For any high-quality life, a sufficiently large number of people with low-but-positive quality lives can be better. More formally: For any population A (e.g., one person at a very high welfare level *x*), and for any other positive welfare level *y*, there exists a population B consisting of some number of people all at level *y* which is better than A.\n*   **Analysis with CLV:** Let's test this.\n    1.  Let population A be one person with a very high welfare level, `x`, such that `x > c`. The value of this population is `V(A) = x - c`, which is a positive number.\n    2.  The condition says this must hold for **any** positive welfare level `y`. Let's choose a level `y` such that `0 < y < c` (i.e., a life worth living, but below the critical level).\n    3.  Population B consists of `m` people, all at level `y`. The value of this population is `V(B) = m * (y - c)`.\n    4.  Since `y < c`, the term `(y - c)` is negative. Therefore, `V(B)` is a negative number, regardless of how large we make `m`.\n    5.  Can population B be better than population A? No. A negative value (`V(B)`) can never be better than a positive value (`V(A)`).\n*   **Conclusion:** The condition fails for any chosen `y` below the critical level. Therefore, critical-level views **violate** Non-Elitism.\n\n**D. Weak Non-Sadism:**\n*   **Condition:** For a fixed number of people, a population where everyone is at a higher welfare level is better than a population where everyone is at a lower welfare level.\n*   **Analysis with CLV:** Let population A have *n* people at level *x* and B have *n* people at level *y*, where *x > y*. The value of A is *n*(x-c) and the value of B is *n*(y-c). Since *x > y*, it is true that *n*(x-c) > *n*(y-c).\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n**E. Weak Quality Addition:**\n*   **Condition:** There exists at least one welfare level *x* such that adding a person with that welfare level *x* always makes a population better, regardless of the original population.\n*   **Analysis with CLV:** To make a population better, the added person must contribute positive value. The value contributed by a new person with welfare *x* is `(x - c)`. We need this to be positive, so we need `x > c`. We can easily find such a level; for example, if the critical level *c* is 10, we can choose *x*=11. Adding a person at welfare level 11 always adds `11-10=1` to the total value, thus making the population better. The condition only requires that *there exists* at least one such level.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Quality Addition.\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\n\nWe have found two conditions that critical-level views violate: **General Non-Extreme Priority** and **Non-Elitism**. However, the violation of Non-Elitism is the most distinctive and fundamental feature of critical-level views in the context of Arrhenius's paradoxes and the Repugnant Conclusion.\n\n*   Violating the priority principle is common to all forms of utilitarianism (Total, Average, etc.).\n*   Violating Non-Elitism is the specific mechanism by which critical-level views avoid the Repugnant Conclusion (which states that a huge population of people with barely-worth-living lives can be better than a smaller population of very happy people). Total Utilitarianism accepts Non-Elitism and thus suffers from the Repugnant Conclusion. Critical-level views reject Non-Elitism and avoid it.\n\nTherefore, in the context of analyzing how different theories navigate the impossibilities of population ethics, the violation of Non-Elitism is the defining characteristic of critical-level views.\n\n<<<C>>>"
