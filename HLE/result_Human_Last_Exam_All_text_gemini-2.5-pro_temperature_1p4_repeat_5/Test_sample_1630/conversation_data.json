    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the problem mathematically.**\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\nThe condition that their derivatives are positive for all $x$ means that $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions on the entire real line.\nA fixed point of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$.\nWe want to find the maximum possible number of these fixed points. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real roots of the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the equation.**\nLet $f(x) = ax^3 + \\dots$ and $g(x) = px^3 + \\dots$, where $a$ and $p$ are the leading coefficients.\nThe condition $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + \\dots > 0$ for all $x$ implies that the quadratic $f'(x)$ is an upward-opening parabola that is always above the x-axis, so its leading coefficient must be positive, i.e., $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$.\nSimilarly, from $g'(x) = 3px^2 + \\dots > 0$, we get $3p > 0 \\implies p > 0$.\n\nThe composite function is $h(x) = f(g(x)) = a(g(x))^3 + \\dots$.\nThe term with the highest power of $x$ comes from $a(px^3)^3 = ap^3 x^9$.\nSince $a > 0$ and $p > 0$, the leading coefficient $ap^3$ is not zero.\nTherefore, $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n\nThe equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation. The highest degree term is $ap^3 x^9$, so it is a degree 9 equation.\n\n**Step 3: Establish an upper bound for the number of fixed points.**\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots.\nSince $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ is a polynomial equation of degree 9, it can have at most 9 real roots.\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze if this upper bound of 9 is achievable.**\nTo have 9 distinct real roots, the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ must have 8 distinct local extrema (peaks and valleys). This requires its derivative, $P'(x)$, to have 8 distinct real roots.\n\nLet's analyze the derivative $P'(x)$:\n$P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = h'(x) - 1$, where $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\nBy the chain rule, $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\nSo, the critical points of $P(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $f'(g(x)) g'(x) = 1$.\n\nLet's determine the degree of $h'(x)$.\n$f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2 (since $f(x)$ is degree 3).\n$g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\nSo, the composition $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n$g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\nThus, $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nThe equation for the critical points, $h'(x) = 1$, is a polynomial equation of degree 8. It can have at most 8 real roots. So it is possible for $P(x)$ to have 8 critical points, which we will call $c_1 < c_2 < \\dots < c_8$.\n\nFor $P(x)$ to have 9 distinct roots, these 8 critical points must correspond to local extrema whose values alternate in sign, i.e., $P(c_1)>0, P(c_2)<0, P(c_3)>0$, and so on.\n\nLet's analyze the shape of $y=h'(x)$. We need to know if it can intersect the line $y=1$ eight times.\nThis requires $h'(x)$ to have enough \"wiggles\". The number of wiggles is determined by its derivative, $h''(x)$.\n$h''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}[h'(x)] = f''(g(x)) [g'(x)]^2 + f'(g(x)) g''(x)$.\n$f''(x)$ has degree 1, and $g''(x)$ has degree 1.\nThe degree of the first term $f''(g(x)) [g'(x)]^2$ is $\\deg(f'')\\deg(g) + 2\\deg(g') = 1 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 2 = 7$.\nThe degree of the second term $f'(g(x)) g''(x)$ is $\\deg(f')\\deg(g) + \\deg(g'') = 2 \\cdot 3 + 1 = 7$.\nThe leading coefficients can be shown not to cancel. So, $h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7.\nThis means $h''(x)$ has at most 7 real roots. Consequently, $h'(x)$ has at most 7 local extrema.\n\nAn 8th-degree polynomial like $h'(x)$ whose leading coefficient is positive (since $a>0, p>0$) goes to $+\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$. With 7 local extrema, it must have 4 local minima and 3 local maxima. To intersect the line $y=1$ at 8 different points, the values of the 4 local minima must be less than 1, and the values of the 3 local maxima must be greater than 1.\n\nBy carefully choosing the polynomials $f$ and $g$, this condition can be met.\n1.  We can make the minima of $f'$ and $g'$ small enough such that their product is less than 1. This ensures that the global minimum of $h'(x)$ is less than 1, so it can dip below the line $y=1$.\n2.  We can also ensure the functions grow sufficiently fast in other regions to create local maxima for $h'(x)$ that are greater than 1.\n3.  The parameters of the cubics $f$ and $g$ provide enough freedom to create 7 distinct real roots for the degree-7 polynomial $h''(x)$ and place the extrema of $h'(x)$ appropriately.\n4.  Once we have 8 critical points $c_i$ for $P(x) = f(g(x))-x$, we can use the constant term in $f(x)$ to shift the entire graph of $P(x)$ up or down without changing the locations of the critical points, ensuring that the local maxima are positive and the local minima are negative.\n\nSince it is possible to construct such polynomials $f$ and $g$, the upper bound of 9 is achievable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real roots of a degree 9 polynomial, which is 9. The analysis of the derivatives shows that the constraints on the polynomials do not prevent the construction of a case where 9 roots are achieved.\n\n<<<9>>>"
