The product is a complex tricyclic ketone with the molecular formula C₂₀H₃₂O₄Si. It is formed through an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement of the starting material. Key features of the product include:
1.  A ketone group (C=O) at the position of the original tertiary alcohol (C2).
2.  A carbon-carbon double bond within the new tricyclic framework.
3.  The original 7,7-dimethoxy ketal and 4'-TBDSO-ether protecting groups remain intact.
4.  The overall structure is a bridged bicyclo[4.3.0]nonenone (tricyclic) system resulting from the cleavage of the C1-C2 bond of the norbornene and the formation of a new C-C bond between the two original ring systems.
