    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE for large x.**\n    The given differential equation is $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$.\n    The initial conditions are $y(0) = 0$, $y'(0) = 3$, and $y''(0) = 2$.\n    From the initial conditions, we can calculate $y'''(0) = y(0)^4 + y'(0)^4 - \\frac{y''(0)}{3(0)^2+2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan(0)+1} = 0^4 + 3^4 - \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{1}{1} = 81 - 1 + 1 = 81$.\n    Since $y'(0)$, $y''(0)$, and $y'''(0)$ are all positive, the solution $y(x)$ is expected to grow rapidly and likely lead to a finite-time blow-up, where $y(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to x_0$ for some finite $x_0 > 0$. In the context of such problems, the \"large x regime\" refers to the behavior of the solution as $x$ approaches this singularity $x_0$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the ODE in the blow-up regime.**\n    As $x \\to x_0$, we assume $y$ and its derivatives become very large. In this limit, the terms that do not grow as fast can be neglected.\n    *   The term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ will be small compared to the blowing-up terms, as the denominator contains $x^2$ (or is a constant if $x_0$ is finite), while $y''$ blows up. Even if $y''$ grows, the polynomial in the denominator provides damping that is less significant than the high-power nonlinear terms.\n    *   The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ is bounded (except at its own singularities) and oscillates. Its contribution will be negligible compared to the terms that drive the blow-up. For a more rigorous approach, one might average it to its mean value of $1/2$, but even this constant is negligible compared to the terms that go to infinity.\n    *   Therefore, the dominant behavior of the ODE near the singularity is captured by the simplified equation: $y''' \\approx y^4 + (y')^4$.\n\n3.  **Perform a dominant balance analysis.**\n    We look for a solution of the form $y(x) \\approx a(x_0-x)^{-n}$ for $x \\to x_0^-$, where $n>0$ would signify a blow-up where $y \\to \\infty$. However, let's analyze the problem more generally.\n    Let's find the dominant term between $y^4$ and $(y')^4$.\n    If $y(x) \\sim A(x_0-x)^{-n}$, then $y'(x) \\sim An(x_0-x)^{-n-1}$.\n    $y^4 \\sim A^4(x_0-x)^{-4n}$\n    $(y')^4 \\sim A^4 n^4 (x_0-x)^{-4n-4}$\n    Since $-4n-4 < -4n$, the term $(y')^4$ has a higher singularity order and will dominate $y^4$ as $x \\to x_0$.\n    So, the dominant balance in the simplified ODE is between $y'''$ and $(y')^4$.\n    The equation becomes: $y''' \\approx (y')^4$.\n\n4.  **Solve the simplified dominant equation.**\n    Let $v = y'$. The equation becomes $v'' \\approx v^4$. This is an autonomous ODE for $v$.\n    To solve it in the asymptotic limit where $v \\to \\infty$, we multiply by $v'$: $v'v'' \\approx v^4v'$.\n    Integrating with respect to $x$ gives $\\frac{1}{2}(v')^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{5}v^5 + C$.\n    For large $v$, the integration constant $C$ is negligible: $(v')^2 \\approx \\frac{2}{5}v^5$.\n    $v' \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}} v^{5/2}$.\n    This is a separable ODE for $v$: $\\frac{dv}{v^{5/2}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}}dx$.\n    Integrating gives $\\int v^{-5/2}dv \\approx \\int \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}}dx$, which results in $-\\frac{2}{3}v^{-3/2} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}}(x - x_0)$.\n    Rearranging for $v$: $v(x) \\approx \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}}(x-x_0)\\right)^{-2/3} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}}\\right)^2\\right)^{-1/3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3}$.\n    $v(x) = y'(x) \\approx \\left(\\frac{9}{4}\\frac{2}{5}\\right)^{-1/3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3} = \\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^{-1/3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3} = \\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right)^{1/3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3}$.\n    Let $c = (10/9)^{1/3}$. So, $y'(x) \\approx c(x_0-x)^{-2/3}$.\n\n5.  **Find the behavior of y(x).**\n    We find $y(x)$ by integrating $y'(x)$:\n    $y(x) = \\int y'(x) dx \\approx \\int c(x_0-x)^{-2/3} dx = -c \\frac{(x_0-x)^{1/3}}{1/3} + K_2 = -3c(x_0-x)^{1/3} + K_2$.\n    As $x \\to x_0$, the term $(x_0-x)^{1/3} \\to 0$.\n    Thus, $y(x)$ approaches a finite constant $K_2$ at the singularity.\n    The analytical expression that approximates $y(x)$ in the blow-up regime is therefore a constant, $y(x) \\approx K_2$.\n\n6.  **Estimate the constant K2.**\n    The value of $K_2$ depends on the initial conditions. We can estimate it by assuming the asymptotic solution is a reasonable approximation over the entire interval from $x=0$ to $x=x_0$.\n    First, estimate $x_0$ by applying the initial condition $y'(0)=3.00$ to our asymptotic form for $y'(x)$:\n    $y'(0) \\approx c(x_0-0)^{-2/3} \\implies 3 \\approx c x_0^{-2/3}$.\n    $x_0^{2/3} \\approx c/3 \\implies x_0 \\approx (c/3)^{3/2}$.\n    Next, estimate $K_2$ using $y(x_0) = y(0) + \\int_0^{x_0} y'(t)dt$:\n    $K_2 \\approx 0 + \\int_0^{x_0} c(x_0-t)^{-2/3} dt = c \\left[ -3(x_0-t)^{1/3} \\right]_0^{x_0} = -3c(0) - (-3c(x_0)^{1/3}) = 3c x_0^{1/3}$.\n    Now substitute the expression for $x_0^{1/3} = (x_0^{2/3})^{1/2} \\approx (c/3)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{c/3}$.\n    $K_2 \\approx 3c \\sqrt{c/3} = 3c \\frac{\\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{3} c^{3/2}$.\n    Substitute the value of $c = (10/9)^{1/3}$:\n    $K_2 \\approx \\sqrt{3} \\left(\\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right)^{1/3}\\right)^{3/2} = \\sqrt{3} \\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{3} \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{\\sqrt{9}} = \\sqrt{3} \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{3} = \\sqrt{\\frac{30}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{3}}$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the numerical value and round.**\n    $K_2 \\approx \\sqrt{10/3} \\approx \\sqrt{3.333...} \\approx 1.82574$.\n    Rounding to two decimal places, we get $1.83$.\n    The approximate analytical expression for $y(x)$ in the large $x$ (blow-up) regime is the constant value it approaches."
