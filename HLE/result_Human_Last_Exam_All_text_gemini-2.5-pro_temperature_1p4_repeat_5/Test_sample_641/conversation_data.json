    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We are looking for the number of elements $x$ in the group $G = \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ such that $x^2=1$ and $x \\neq 1$.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Group PSU(4, 997)**\nThe Projective Special Unitary group PSU(n, q) is defined as the quotient group $\\text{SU}(n, q) / Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$, where $\\text{SU}(n, q)$ is the Special Unitary Group over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, and $Z$ is its center.\nIn our case, $n=4$ and $q=997$.\nThe group $\\text{SU}(4, 997)$ consists of $4 \\times 4$ matrices $A$ with entries in $\\mathbb{F}_{997^2}$ satisfying:\n1.  $A^*A = I$ (Unitary condition), where $A^* = \\bar{A}^T$ and $\\bar{x} = x^q$ is the Frobenius automorphism of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$.\n2.  $\\det(A) = 1$ (Special condition).\n\nThe center of $\\text{SU}(n, q)$, denoted $Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$, consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^n = 1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. The order of the center is $|\\Z| = \\gcd(n, q+1)$.\nFor PSU(4, 997), we have $n=4$ and $q=997$.\n$|\\Z| = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998)$.\nSince $998 = 2 \\times 499$, and 499 is a prime number, $\\gcd(4, 998) = 2$.\nSo, the center is $Z = \\{\\pm I\\}$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\n**Step 2: Characterizing Involutions in PSU(4, 997)**\nAn element $x=gZ$ in PSU(4, 997) is an involution if $x \\neq Z$ (the identity element) and $x^2=Z$.\nThis means we are looking for elements $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that:\n1.  $g \\notin Z$, i.e., $g \\neq I$ and $g \\neq -I$.\n2.  $g^2 \\in Z$, i.e., $g^2 = I$ or $g^2 = -I$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the condition $g^2 = -I$**\nLet $g$ be a matrix in $\\text{U}(n, q)$ (the general unitary group). Let $\\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $g$. Since $g$ is a unitary matrix, its eigenvalues must satisfy the condition $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$.\nIf $g^2 = -I$, then the minimal polynomial of $g$ must divide $t^2+1$. This means the eigenvalues of $g$ must be roots of $t^2+1=0$.\nThe question is whether roots of $t^2+1=0$ can satisfy $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$.\nOur field is defined by $q=997$. Since $997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, the polynomial $t^2+1$ has roots in the base field $\\mathbb{F}_{997}$. Let's call these roots $\\pm j$, where $j \\in \\mathbb{F}_{997}$.\nFor any such eigenvalue $\\lambda=\\pm j \\in \\mathbb{F}_{997}$, its Galois conjugate is $\\bar{\\lambda} = \\lambda^q = \\lambda^{997} = \\lambda$.\nThe unitary condition requires $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. But here, $\\lambda^{q+1} = \\lambda^q \\lambda = \\lambda \\cdot \\lambda = \\lambda^2 = -1$.\nSince $-1 \\neq 1$ (as the characteristic is not 2), the condition is not met.\nTherefore, there are no matrices $g$ in $\\text{U}(4, 997)$ such that $g^2=-I$. Consequently, there are no such elements in $\\text{SU}(4, 997)$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the condition $g^2 = I$**\nWe now consider elements $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that $g^2 = I$ and $g \\notin \\{\\pm I\\}$.\nSuch a matrix $g$ is an involution. It is diagonalizable and its eigenvalues must be $\\pm 1$.\nLet $k$ be the number of eigenvalues equal to $-1$. The remaining $4-k$ eigenvalues are equal to $1$.\nSince $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$, its determinant is $\\det(g) = (-1)^k = 1$. This implies that $k$ must be an even number.\nThe possible values for $k$ are $0, 2, 4$.\n*   If $k=0$, all eigenvalues are $1$. Then $g=I$, which is in the center. We exclude this case.\n*   If $k=4$, all eigenvalues are $-1$. Then $g=-I$, which is also in the center. We exclude this case.\n*   If $k=2$, the eigenvalues are $\\{-1, -1, 1, 1\\}$. These elements are not in the center. This is the only case that gives rise to involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n**Step 5: Counting the number of such elements**\nAll matrices with eigenvalues $\\{-1,-1,1,1\\}$ are conjugate in the general linear group. In the unitary group, they also form a single conjugacy class. An argument based on centralizer determinants shows this is also true in the special unitary group. Let's call this class $C_1$.\nThe number of elements in this class is $|C_1| = \\frac{|\\text{SU}(4, q)|}{|C_{\\text{SU}(4, q)}(J)|}$, where $J = \\text{diag}(-1, -1, 1, 1)$ is a representative of the class.\nThe centralizer of $J$ in $\\text{U}(4, q)$ is $\\text{U}(2, q) \\times \\text{U}(2, q)$.\nThe centralizer in $\\text{SU}(4, q)$ is $C_{\\text{SU}(4, q)}(J) = \\{(A,B) \\in \\text{U}(2,q)\\times\\text{U}(2,q) : \\det(A)\\det(B)=1\\}$.\nIts size is $|C_{\\text{SU}(4, q)}(J)| = \\frac{|\\text{U}(2, q)|^2}{q+1}$.\nThe orders of the unitary groups are given by the formulas:\n$|\\text{U}(n,q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} \\prod_{i=1}^{n} (q^i - (-1)^i)$\n$|\\text{SU}(n,q)| = \\frac{1}{q+1}|\\text{U}(n,q)|$\n\nFor $n=4$: $|\\text{SU}(4,q)| = q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$.\nFor $n=2$: $|\\text{U}(2,q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)$.\n\n$|C_1| = \\frac{|\\text{SU}(4, q)|}{|\\text{U}(2, q)|^2/(q+1)} = \\frac{q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q(q+1)(q^2-1))^2 / (q+1)}$\n$|C_1| = \\frac{q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{q^2(q+1)^2(q^2-1)^2} = \\frac{q^4(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)}$\nUsing $q^3+1=(q+1)(q^2-q+1)$ and $q^4-1=(q^2-1)(q^2+1)$:\n$|C_1| = \\frac{q^4(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**Step 6: Counting the involutions in PSU(4, 997)**\nThe set of all elements in SU(4, 997) that project to involutions in PSU(4, 997) is exactly the class $C_1$.\nThe involutions in PSU(4, 997) are the cosets $gZ$ where $g \\in C_1$. Since $Z=\\{\\pm I\\}$, each coset is of the form $\\{g, -g\\}$.\nFor any $g \\in C_1$, its negative, $-g$, also has eigenvalues $\\{-1,-1,1,1\\}$ (since $n=4$ is even) and belongs to SU(4, 997). Thus, $-g$ is also in $C_1$. Since $q$ is odd, $g \\neq -g$.\nTherefore, the set $C_1$ is partitioned into disjoint pairs of the form $\\{g, -g\\}$. Each such pair corresponds to a single involution in PSU(4, 997).\nThe total number of involutions is the number of such pairs, which is $|C_1|/2$.\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**Step 7: Final Calculation**\nWe substitute $q=997$.\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 \\cdot (997^2 - 997 + 1) \\cdot (997^2 + 1)$.\nLet's compute the terms in the parentheses:\n*   $997^2 - 997 + 1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013$.\n*   $997^2 + 1 = 994009 + 1 = 994010$.\n\nThe number of involutions is:\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 \\cdot 993013 \\cdot 994010 = 997^4 \\cdot 993013 \\cdot \\frac{994010}{2} = 997^4 \\cdot 993013 \\cdot 497005$.\n\nThis is the final numerical answer, expressed as a product of integers.\n\n$997^4 \\cdot 993013 \\cdot 497005$"
