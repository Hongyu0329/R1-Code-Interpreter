    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from William Morris's novel, *The House of the Wolfings*. The required character must satisfy three specific conditions:\n1.  They must have visited a Roman city.\n2.  They must describe Roman religious practices.\n3.  This description must contain details that a reader would recognize as the story of Romulus and Remus (twin founders of Rome suckled by a she-wolf).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Source Material:** The answer must come specifically from the text of *The House of the Wolfings*. General knowledge about the Goths or Romans is helpful for context, but the character and their description must be present in the novel.\n2.  **Character's Role:** Most characters in the book are Goths of the Wolfing tribe who are preparing to fight the Romans. This makes a character who has lived within a Roman city a unique individual, likely with a specific backstory, such as being a captive or a traveler.\n3.  **The Description:** The description of the Romulus and Remus myth would likely be from an outsider's perspective. The character might not use the names \"Romulus\" and \"Remus\" but would describe the core elements: two brothers and a she-wolf as a foster mother, connected to the founding of a great city.\n4.  **Identifying the Character:** The analysis needs to sift through the characters and their known histories within the narrative to find the one who fits this specific profile.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Answer\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Characters:** We must consider the main and supporting characters in the novel. These include Thiodolf (the War-Duke), his foster-daughter the Hall-Sun, her sister Wood-Sun, elders like Arinbiorn, and thralls (slaves/servants) like Otter.\n\n2.  **Filter by Experience:** We filter these characters based on who has firsthand experience with Roman cities.\n    *   Thiodolf and the other Gothic warriors only know the Romans as enemies on the battlefield.\n    *   The Hall-Sun and Wood-Sun are deeply connected to the Gothic forests and their people's magic; they have not traveled to Roman lands.\n    *   This leaves thralls or captives as the most likely candidates. The thrall **Otter** is explicitly noted to have been captured and to have lived among the Romans before rejoining the Goths. His past makes him a source of information about the enemy.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Passage:** We need to find the scene where Roman culture and religion are discussed. This occurs in **Chapter V, \"They Fall to Talk of the Romans.\"** In this chapter, the Goths are gathered in the great hall, and Otter is asked to speak about the Romans.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Character's Description:** When asked about the Romans' gods, Otter provides the crucial information. He describes a city he was in (which he calls the \"Burg of the Ram\") and speaks of the Romans' origins. He states that the Romans \"worship the Wolf\" and tells the assembled Goths the reason for this: **\"...the first men of them, two brethren, were suckled by a she-wolf, and that from them is their city named.\"**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** This description perfectly matches the criteria.\n    *   **Character:** Otter.\n    *   **Visited a Roman city:** Yes, he was a thrall there.\n    *   **Describes religious practices:** Yes, he speaks of their \"worship\" of the Wolf.\n    *   **Refers to Romulus and Remus:** Yes, his tale of \"two brethren\" being \"suckled by a she-wolf\" is a clear and unmistakable reference to the Roman foundation myth.\n\nTherefore, the character who fits all parts of the question is Otter.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
