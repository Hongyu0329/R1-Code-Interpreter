    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron commercial.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Who:** Two Nobel laureates.\n*   **What:** Featured in a commercial.\n*   **When:** The year 2000.\n*   **For whom:** Enron.\n*   **Key detail:** The tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Research the Enron \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign**\nA search for \"Enron Ask Why campaign 2000\" reveals it was a high-profile, expensive advertising effort by the agency Ogilvy & Mather. The goal was to rebrand Enron from an energy pipeline company to an innovative, idea-driven corporation. The campaign featured various intellectuals and business leaders talking about new ideas. The irony of the tagline, given the massive fraud happening within the company, is what made the commercials infamous after Enron's collapse in 2001.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the featured Nobel laureates**\nResearching the specific individuals who appeared in these commercials confirms that two people associated with the Nobel Prize were featured. They were economists Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes.\n\n**Step 4: List careful points and verify their Nobel status**\nThis is a critical step, as the timing of their awards is important.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Myron Scholes' Nobel Prize.** Myron Scholes was a co-recipient of the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for developing the Black-Scholes formula for pricing financial options. When he appeared in the Enron commercial in 2000, he was **already a Nobel laureate**.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Paul Krugman's Nobel Prize.** Paul Krugman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his work on trade theory. At the time the commercial aired in 2000, he was a prominent and respected economist, but he was **not yet a Nobel laureate**. The question asks for two \"Nobel laureates,\" which is factually correct as both individuals hold that title today. It is a common trivia point that Enron featured two men who would become or already were Nobel Prize winners.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the final answer**\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals featured in the campaign who are known as Nobel laureates are Myron Scholes (who had already won his prize) and Paul Krugman (who won his prize later).\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
