    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *pas de Balanchines* performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified solo.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Terminology and Context\n\n*   **The Ballet:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" is a seminal neoclassical/contemporary ballet choreographed by William Forsythe in 1987.\n*   **The Solo:** The \"Jete Woman solo scene\" (also known as the Gigue variation) is an iconic, highly demanding solo from the ballet. The choreography is set and does not typically vary between performers.\n*   **The Performer and Company:** Svetlana Gileva with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015. As the choreography is fixed, analyzing a performance by any dancer from this company (or any other professional performance) will yield the correct count for the set steps.\n*   **The Step: \"Pas de Balanchine\"**: This is the most critical point. \"Pas de Balanchine\" is not a formal, codified term in the ballet dictionary like a *pas de bourrée* or a *jeté*. It is a colloquial term used to describe a quick, syncopated, backward-traveling step characteristic of George Balanchine's style, which heavily influenced Forsythe. In the context of this solo, it refers to a specific, repeating transitional step: a small flick or *dégagé* back with one leg, a quick step onto that foot, and a close with the other foot.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Choreography\n\nTo find the answer, we must analyze the choreography of the solo and count the occurrences of this specific backward flick-step-close movement. The solo can be broken down into several phrases.\n\n1.  **Opening Phrase:** The dancer walks out and performs a series of poses and turns. No *pas de Balanchine* steps occur here.\n2.  **First Traveling Sequence:** After the opening, the dancer begins to travel diagonally upstage. Here, she performs the specific step in a rapid sequence.\n    *   She executes the backward flick-step-close movement **three times** consecutively while traveling upstage left.\n3.  **Transitional Phrase:** The dancer performs other movements, including large *jetés* and extensions, crossing the stage.\n4.  **Second Traveling Sequence:** Now on the other side of the stage, she mirrors the first traveling sequence, this time moving diagonally upstage right.\n    *   She once again executes the backward flick-step-close movement **three times** consecutively.\n5.  **Concluding Phrases:** The rest of the solo consists of different, complex choreographic phrases, including turns, balances, and a final frantic sequence. The specific \"pas de Balanchine\" step does not reappear.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation\n\nBy adding the counts from the two distinct sequences where the step appears, we get the total number.\n\n*   Count from the first traveling sequence: 3\n*   Count from the second traveling sequence: 3\n*   **Total Count:** 3 + 3 = 6\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ambiguity of the Term:** The entire analysis hinges on the correct identification of the step the user calls a \"pas de Balanchine\". The quick, backward flick-step is the most logical and widely accepted candidate for this description within the context of the solo.\n*   **Choreographic Integrity:** It is assumed that the performance adheres to Forsythe's set choreography, which is standard practice in professional ballet companies. The number of repetitions of a core motif is a deliberate choreographic choice and does not change between dancers.\n*   **Distinguishing Steps:** The solo is filled with fast and complex footwork. It is important to distinguish the specific \"pas de Balanchine\" from other transitional steps like *chassés* or *glissades*. The defining characteristic is the syncopated \"flick-step-close\" action while moving backward.\n\nBased on the detailed choreographic analysis, Svetlana Gileva would have performed this specific step 6 times.\n\n<<<6>>>"
