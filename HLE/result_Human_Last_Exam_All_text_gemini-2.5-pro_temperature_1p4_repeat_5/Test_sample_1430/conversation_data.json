    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the objects**\n\n*   **C:** A genus 3 Riemann surface. This is a smooth projective curve of genus $g=3$ over the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$.\n*   **X = C^(15):** The 15th symmetric power of C. This is the variety parameterizing effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi group NS(X):** This is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, denoted by $\\rho(X)$, is also called the Picard number of X.\n\n**Step 2: Relating X to the Jacobian of C**\n\nA key result in the theory of algebraic curves relates symmetric powers of a curve to its Jacobian variety. The Jacobian of C, denoted $J(C)$, is a $g=3$-dimensional abelian variety that parameterizes degree 0 line bundles on C.\n\nThere is a natural map, the Abel-Jacobi map (or summation map), $S_d: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$, given by sending a divisor $D$ to the linear equivalence class of the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D - d \\cdot P_0)$, where $P_0$ is a fixed base point on C.\n\nFor $d \\ge 2g-1$, this map $S_d$ exhibits $C^{(d)}$ as a projective bundle over $J(C)$.\nIn our case, $d=15$ and $g=3$, so $d=15 \\ge 2(3)-1=5$. Thus, $X = C^{(15)}$ is a projective bundle over $J(C)$. The fiber of this bundle is isomorphic to the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^{d-g} = \\mathbb{P}^{15-3} = \\mathbb{P}^{12}$.\n\n**Step 3: The Neron-Severi rank of a projective bundle**\n\nLet $p: X \\to B$ be a projective bundle over a smooth projective variety B. The Neron-Severi group of X is related to that of B. There is an exact sequence relating their Picard groups, which, after tensoring with $\\mathbb{Q}$, implies a simple relation for their ranks:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\n\nThe additional generator for $NS(X)$ comes from the class of the relative hyperplane bundle $\\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ of the projective bundle.\n\nIn our case, $X=C^{(15)}$ and $B=J(C)$, so we have:\n$\\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian $J(C)$, as C varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the range of the Picard number of a g=3 Jacobian**\n\nLet A be an abelian variety of dimension $g$. The rank of its Neron-Severi group, $\\rho(A)$, is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$. For $A=J(C)$ with $g=3$, we have $1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$. The lower bound $\\rho \\ge 1$ holds for any projective variety, as an ample class is always non-trivial. We need to determine if these bounds are achieved.\n\nThe Picard number of an abelian variety A is determined by its algebra of endomorphisms, $End^0(A) = End(A) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$. By a theorem of Albert and Weil, the space $NS(A) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the subspace of $End^0(A)$ consisting of elements fixed by the Rosati involution. The rank $\\rho(A)$ is the dimension of this subspace.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank:**\n    For a *very general* curve C of genus 3 (for instance, a non-hyperelliptic curve with a trivial automorphism group), its Jacobian $J(C)$ is simple and has the smallest possible endomorphism algebra, namely $End^0(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Q}$. The Rosati involution on $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the identity. Thus, the entire algebra is fixed by the involution.\n    $\\rho(J(C)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathbb{Q}) = 1$.\n    So, the minimum possible rank is 1.\n\n*   **Largest possible rank:**\n    To maximize $\\rho(J(C))$, we need to find a curve C such that $J(C)$ has a large endomorphism algebra. The maximum possible rank is $\\rho(J(C)) = g^2=9$.\n    This maximum is achieved when $J(C)$ is isogenous to a product of isogenous elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM).\n    Consider a curve C for which its Jacobian decomposes, up to isogeny, as $J(C) \\sim E \\times E \\times E = E^3$, where E is an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field K.\n    The endomorphism algebra is $End^0(J(C)) \\cong M_3(K)$. The Rosati involution on $M_3(K)$ corresponds to the conjugate transpose. The elements fixed by this involution are the Hermitian matrices, i.e., matrices $M$ such that $M = \\overline{M}^T$.\n    The dimension of the space of $3 \\times 3$ Hermitian matrices over K is calculated as follows:\n    - The 3 diagonal entries must be real, so they lie in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This gives 3 dimensions.\n    - The 3 entries above the diagonal can be any element of K. Since $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(K) = 2$, this gives $3 \\times 2 = 6$ dimensions. The entries below the diagonal are then determined.\n    - Total dimension = $3 + 6 = 9$.\n    So, $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n    A curve realizing this scenario is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$. This is a genus 3 curve, and its Jacobian is known to be isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$, which has complex multiplication by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n    Therefore, the maximum possible rank is 9.\n\n**Step 5: Final calculation**\n\nWe have found that the possible range for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of a genus 3 Jacobian is:\n$1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 9$.\n\nUsing the relation from Step 3, $\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$:\n\n*   The smallest possible rank for $NS(X)$ is $\\min(\\rho(J(C))) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n*   The largest possible rank for $NS(X)$ is $\\max(\\rho(J(C))) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
