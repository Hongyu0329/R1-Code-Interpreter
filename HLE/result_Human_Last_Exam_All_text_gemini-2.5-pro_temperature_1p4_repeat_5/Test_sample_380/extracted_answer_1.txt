The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial; it follows the Parker Spiral, which is typically angled at about 45 degrees to the radial direction. The reason for using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (Y and Z components in a system like GSE) to calculate normalized magnetic helicity is not a physical assumption about the field's direction, but a practical and standard methodological choice for analyzing data from a single spacecraft. This choice is justified by Taylor's "frozen-in flow" hypothesis. Because the solar wind convects the waves radially past the spacecraft at very high speed, the time series data measured is effectively a spatial scan along the radial direction. Therefore, the helicity is calculated relative to this dominant convection direction (the radial axis), characterizing the wave structure as it is observed in the spacecraft's frame of reference.
