    "To determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, denoted by Γ, we can classify these subgroups based on their core.\n\nLet `H` be a subgroup of Γ with index `[Γ : H] = 4`.\nThe core of `H` in Γ is `core_Γ(H) = ∩_{g∈Γ} gHg⁻¹`. This is the largest normal subgroup of Γ contained in `H`.\nThe quotient group `T = Γ / core_Γ(H)` is isomorphic to a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group `S_4`. The group Γ acts transitively on the set of left cosets `Γ/H`, and this action is described by a homomorphism `φ: Γ → S_4` whose image is `T`.\n\n**Step 1: Identify possible quotient groups T**\nA crucial property of the Grigorchuk group is that any of its finite quotient groups must be a 2-group (a group where every element's order is a power of 2).\nThe transitive subgroups of `S_4` are:\n1.  `C_4` (cyclic group of order 4): This is a 2-group.\n2.  `V_4` (Klein four-group, `C_2 × C_2`): This is a 2-group.\n3.  `D_4` (dihedral group of order 8): This is a 2-group.\n4.  `A_4` (alternating group of order 12): Not a 2-group (contains elements of order 3).\n5.  `S_4` (symmetric group of order 24): Not a 2-group (contains elements of order 3).\n\nTherefore, `T` can only be isomorphic to `C_4`, `V_4`, or `D_4`. We analyze each case.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the case T ≅ C_4**\nIf `Γ / core_Γ(H) ≅ C_4`, it implies there is a surjective homomorphism `φ: Γ → C_4`.\nAny homomorphism from a group `G` to an abelian group `A` must factor through the abelianization of `G`, `G_ab = G / [G, G]`.\nThe abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is known to be `Γ_ab ≅ C_2 × C_2 × C_2`.\nSo, any homomorphism `φ: Γ → C_4` must factor as `φ': Γ_ab → C_4`.\nLet `x` be any element in `Γ_ab`. Since `Γ_ab` is a direct product of `C_2`s, `x²` is the identity. Thus, `φ'(x)² = φ'(x²) = φ'(1) = 1`.\nThe image `Im(φ')` must therefore consist of elements of order at most 2. In `C_4`, the only elements of order at most 2 form the subgroup `{0, 2} ≅ C_2`.\nThis means the image of any homomorphism from `Γ_ab` to `C_4` cannot be `C_4` itself. It cannot be surjective.\nTherefore, there are no surjective homomorphisms from Γ to `C_4`, and no subgroups `H` for which `Γ / core_Γ(H) ≅ C_4`. This case contributes 0 subgroups.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case T ≅ V_4**\nHere, `Γ / core_Γ(H) ≅ V_4`. Let `K = core_Γ(H)`. The subgroup `H` corresponds to a subgroup `H/K` in `V_4`.\nThe index is related by `[Γ:H] = [Γ:K] / [H:K]`. Also `[Γ:H] = [V_4 : H/K]`.\nSince `[Γ:H] = 4` and `V_4` has order 4, we must have `[V_4 : H/K] = 4`. This implies `H/K` is the trivial subgroup, so `H = K`.\nThis means `H` must be a normal subgroup of Γ with `Γ/H ≅ V_4`.\nThe number of such normal subgroups is the number of distinct kernels of surjective homomorphisms from Γ to `V_4`.\nThis is given by `|Epi(Γ, V_4)| / |Aut(V_4)|`.\n*   As in Step 2, `Epi(Γ, V_4)` corresponds to `Epi(Γ_ab, V_4) = Epi(C_2×C_2×C_2, C_2×C_2)`.\n*   Thinking in terms of linear algebra over the field `F_2`, we are counting surjective linear maps from `F_2³` to `F_2²`.\n*   The total number of linear maps is `2^(3*2) = 64`.\n*   The non-surjective maps have an image of dimension 0 (the zero map, 1 of these) or 1. `F_2²` has 3 subspaces of dimension 1. For each such subspace `L ≅ F_2`, the number of non-zero maps from `F_2³` to `L` is `2³ - 1 = 7`. So there are `3 * 7 = 21` maps with a 1-dimensional image.\n*   Number of surjective maps `|Epi(Γ, V_4)| = 64 - 1 - 21 = 42`.\n*   The automorphism group of the codomain is `Aut(V_4) ≅ GL₂(F₂)`, which has size `(2²-1)(2²-2) = 3 * 2 = 6`.\n*   The number of such normal subgroups is `42 / 6 = 7`.\nThis case contributes **7 subgroups**, all of which are normal.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the case T ≅ D_4**\nHere, `Γ / core_Γ(H) ≅ D_4`. Let `K = core_Γ(H)`. As before, `H/K` is a subgroup of `D_4` and `[D_4 : H/K] = 4`.\nSince `|D_4| = 8`, this means `|H/K| = 2`. So `H/K` is a subgroup of order 2 in `D_4`.\n`D_4` has 5 elements of order 2 (the center `r²` and four reflections `s, sr, sr², sr³`), so it has 5 subgroups of order 2.\nFor a subgroup `H` to fall into this case, we must have `core_Γ(H) = K`, which implies `core_{D_4}(H/K)` must be the trivial subgroup.\nLet `S = H/K`. The core of `S` in `D_4` is the largest normal subgroup of `D_4` contained in `S`.\n*   If `S = <r²> = Z(D_4)`, then `S` is normal, so `core_{D_4}(S) = S ≠ {e}`. Subgroups `H` corresponding to this `S` do not have `K` as their core. Instead, `core(H) = φ⁻¹(S)`, and the quotient `Γ/core(H) ≅ D_4/S ≅ V_4`. These subgroups belong to the `V_4` case and have already been counted among the 7 normal subgroups.\n*   If `S` is one of the 4 subgroups generated by a reflection (e.g., `<s>`), it is not normal. The only normal subgroup contained in it is the trivial subgroup `{e}`. So `core_{D_4}(S) = {e}`.\nThis means for each normal subgroup `K` with `Γ/K ≅ D_4`, there are 4 subgroups `H` of index 4 which have `K` as their core.\nNow we need to know how many such normal subgroups `K` exist. This is a known, non-trivial result about the Grigorchuk group:\n*   There are exactly **3** normal subgroups of Γ of index 8, and for each of them, the quotient group is isomorphic to `D_4`.\nLet these normal subgroups be `K₁, K₂, K₃`. For each `Kᵢ`, there are 4 subgroups of index 4 whose core is `Kᵢ`. These `4 × 3 = 12` subgroups are distinct, as they have different cores. They are also non-normal, since `H/K` is not a normal subgroup of `D_4`.\nThis case contributes **12 subgroups**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\nThe subgroups of index 4 are partitioned by the isomorphism type of `Γ/core_Γ(H)`.\n*   From the `T ≅ V_4` case, we get 7 normal subgroups.\n*   From the `T ≅ D_4` case, we get 12 non-normal subgroups.\nThe sets of subgroups from these two cases are disjoint (normal vs. non-normal).\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum `7 + 12 = 19`."
