    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a \"unique architectural feature\" that was part of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" (hosting the Pantheon) and was removed by the city administration in 1950.\n\n2.  **Initial Research & Key Features:** The Piazza della Rotonda's main features are the Pantheon itself and the Fontana del Pantheon (a fountain with an obelisk). The question points to something that is *no longer there*. This requires historical research on modifications to the Pantheon or the piazza.\n\n3.  **Investigating Potential Removed Features:** Research into the architectural history of the Pantheon reveals a very famous and controversial addition that was later removed: a pair of bell towers.\n    *   **What were they?** In the 17th century (specifically between 1626 and 1636), under Pope Urban VIII Barberini, the celebrated artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini was commissioned to add two bell towers to the facade of the Pantheon.\n    *   **Why were they controversial?** These towers were widely disliked by the Roman populace from the very beginning. They were considered out of harmony with the classical, clean lines of the original Roman temple. They were derisively nicknamed *\"le orecchie d'asino\"* (the donkey's ears).\n    *   **When were they removed?** They stood for over two centuries but were eventually demolished.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Date:** This is a crucial and careful point. The question explicitly states the removal happened in **1950**. However, historical records show that the \"donkey's ears\" were removed much earlier, between **1883 and 1892**, under the Minister of Public Education, Guido Baccelli.\n\n5.  **Reconciling the Discrepancy:** It is very likely that the date in the question (1950) is incorrect, as this is a common error in trivia. There is no record of another major \"unique architectural feature\" being removed from the Pantheon or the piazza in 1950. The removal of Bernini's bell towers is the most significant and well-documented architectural removal associated with this site. Other changes, like the removal of tram lines from central Rome, happened around the mid-20th century, but tram lines would not typically be described as a \"unique architectural feature\" of the church itself. The bell towers fit this description perfectly.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the description \"unique architectural feature\" that was added to the Pantheon and later removed due to public and critical disapproval, the answer must be Bernini's twin bell towers. The date in the prompt is the element that appears to be mistaken.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe architectural feature was a pair of twin bell towers, added by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in the 17th century. They were widely disliked and nicknamed \"the donkey's ears\" (*le orecchie d'asino*). While the question states they were removed in 1950, historical records confirm they were actually removed between 1883 and 1892.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers known as \"the donkey's ears\">>>"
