  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary goal is to find the \"max length\" of a secret message. The unit of length for this message is characters.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source of the Encrypted Message:** The problem states, \"the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols.\" This tells us that the symbols within the Ching book are the fundamental units that carry the message's information.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Encoding Units:** The problem provides a precise number: \"The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols\". These are the individual \"containers\" for the encrypted information.\n\n4.  **Identify the Alphabet of the Decrypted Message:** The message, once decoded, is \"written using the letters in the Shu,\" and this alphabet consists of \"120 most common Chinese characters.\" This information defines what a single unit of the final message isâ€”it's one of these 120 characters.\n\n5.  **Filter Out Irrelevant Information:** The question includes several details that are not necessary to solve the core problem. Recognizing these as distractors is a key step.\n    *   **The total size of the Shu book (\"around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\"):** The total number of characters in the Shu is irrelevant. The important detail is the size of the alphabet derived from it, which is 120. Even this alphabet size is secondary to the main calculation.\n    *   **Computer vision recognition time (\"12 ms\"):** The time it takes a machine to read the characters has no impact on how many characters can be encoded in the Ching. This is a processing detail, not an information capacity detail.\n    *   **Computation time (\"10 ns\" and \"30 ns\"):** Similar to the vision time, the speed of a CPU is irrelevant to the length of a message that was encrypted in an ancient book.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Relationship between Symbols and Message Length:** We need to find the *maximum* possible length of the message. A message's length is the number of characters it contains. The message is encoded by 9999 symbols. To achieve the maximum possible length, we should assume the most efficient and direct encoding scheme where one symbol from the Ching encodes one character of the message.\n\n    *   `1 symbol` -> `1 character`\n\n    If we were to use a more complex scheme (e.g., 2 symbols encode 1 character), the resulting message would be shorter, not longer. Since the question asks for the *max length*, the one-to-one mapping is the logical assumption.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** With 9999 symbols available, and each symbol encoding a single character of the message in the most efficient scenario, the message can be a maximum of 9999 characters long.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Focus on Information Capacity:** The problem is fundamentally about how much information can be stored (the number of symbols), not how it's processed or the specific nature of the alphabet (as long as it's possible to map symbols to characters).\n*   **\"Max Length\" is the Key:** This phrase directs you to find the upper limit. The simplest, most direct encoding (1 symbol = 1 character) provides this upper limit.\n*   **Beware of Red Herrings:** The inclusion of specific timings and irrelevant counts is a classic feature of such analytical puzzles, designed to test your ability to separate signal from noise.\n\nBased on this analysis, the number of symbols in the Ching directly dictates the maximum possible length of the secret message.\n\n<<<9999>>>"
