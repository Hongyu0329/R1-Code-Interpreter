The appropriate management involves a phased approach. **Phase 1 (Emergency):** An immediate medical referral to start treatment for her diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%) is paramount. Dental emergency care includes wound debridement of the tooth sockets, suturing, and prescribing antibiotics and analgesics due to the 28-hour delay and compromised medical state. **Phase 2 (Healing):** A 3-6 month healing period is required, during which an interim removable denture can be provided for aesthetics. **Phase 3 (Definitive Treatment):** The most suitable definitive plan is a removable partial denture, considering her systemic health and Class III skeletal pattern (SNB 88‚Å∞).

The **cells of interest** are the **non-viable Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells** on the avulsed teeth, making replantation impossible. In the wound, key cells include **neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts**, whose functions are all impaired by uncontrolled diabetes, leading to a high risk of infection and poor healing.

For denture replacement, the recommended choice is a **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**. The materia
