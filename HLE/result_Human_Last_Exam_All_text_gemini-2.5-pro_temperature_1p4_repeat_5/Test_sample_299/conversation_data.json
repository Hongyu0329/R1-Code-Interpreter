    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function f**\n\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n1.  **Injectivity of f**: Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. This implies $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of f**: A continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. That is, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Monotonicity of f(f(x))**:\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f(f(x))$ is a composition of two strictly increasing functions, which is also strictly increasing.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then for $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$, and applying $f$ again reverses the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. Thus, $f(f(x))$ is strictly increasing.\n\nIn both cases, $f(f(x))$ is strictly increasing. This is consistent with the right-hand side of the equation, $e^x$, which is a strictly increasing function. So, $f$ could potentially be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**Step 2: Rule out the case where f is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a continuous, strictly decreasing function.\n1.  **Fixed points**: A fixed point of $f$ is a value $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. If such a point exists, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. So, $e^{x_0} = x_0$. However, the equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions (since $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$). Therefore, $f$ has no fixed points.\n\n2.  **Behavior of f(x) relative to x**: Since $f$ is continuous and has no fixed points, the continuous function $g(x) = f(x) - x$ is never zero. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, $g(x)$ must have the same sign for all $x$. This means either $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, or $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n3.  **Contradiction**:\n    *   **Case A: $f(x) > x$ for all $x$**. Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, applying $f$ to the inequality $f(x) > x$ gives $f(f(x)) < f(x)$, which means $e^x < f(x)$. This inequality must hold for all $x$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $e^x \\to \\infty$, which implies that $f(x)$ must also go to $\\infty$. However, a strictly decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$ cannot have a limit of $+\\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$. This is a contradiction.\n    *   **Case B: $f(x) < x$ for all $x$**. As $x \\to -\\infty$, the right side of the inequality goes to $-\\infty$, which implies that $f(x)$ must also go to $-\\infty$. However, for a strictly decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, the limit as $x \\to -\\infty$ must be its supremum, which cannot be $-\\infty$. This is a contradiction.\n\nSince both subcases lead to a contradiction, our initial assumption must be false. Therefore, there are no continuous, strictly decreasing functions satisfying the given equation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case where f is strictly increasing**\n\nWe are now looking for the number of continuous, strictly increasing functions $f$ such that $f(f(x)) = e^x$. These solutions are known as functional square roots of the exponential function.\n\nA standard method for solving such equations is to use conjugation. Let $g(x) = e^x$. We seek $f$ such that $f \\circ f = g$. We find a homeomorphism $\\phi: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that simplifies the action of $g$. The relevant functional equation for this is Abel's equation: $\\phi(g(x)) = \\phi(x) + c$. For $g(x)=e^x$, we have:\n$\\phi(e^x) = \\phi(x) + 1$.\nSuch a function $\\phi$ (a \"super-logarithm\") exists and is continuous and strictly increasing. Its inverse $\\phi^{-1}$ (a \"super-exponential\") also exists.\n\nUsing this $\\phi$, we can write $g(x) = \\phi^{-1}(\\phi(x) + 1)$. Then we can define $f$ as:\n$f(x) = \\phi^{-1}(S(\\phi(x)))$,\nwhere $S$ is a function such that $S(S(y)) = y+1$.\nFor $f$ to be continuous and strictly increasing, $S$ must also be continuous and strictly increasing.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the cardinality of the set of continuous, strictly increasing functions $S: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $S(S(y)) = y+1$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of solutions for S**\n\nLet's construct the set of functions $S$.\n1.  **Properties of S**: If $S(y) \\le y$ for some $y$, then $S(S(y)) \\le S(y) \\le y$, but $S(S(y))=y+1$, leading to $y+1 \\le y$, which is a contradiction. Thus, $S(y) > y$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Construction of S**: We can construct all such functions $S$ as follows:\n    *   Choose an arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing function $\\psi: [0, 1/2] \\to [1/2, 1]$ that satisfies the boundary conditions $\\psi(0)=1/2$ and $\\psi(1/2)=1$.\n    *   Define a function $S_0$ on the interval $[0, 1)$ by:\n        $S_0(y) = \\psi(y)$ for $y \\in [0, 1/2]$.\n        $S_0(y) = \\psi^{-1}(y) + 1$ for $y \\in [1/2, 1)$.\n        This function $S_0$ is continuous and strictly increasing on $[0,1)$.\n    *   Extend $S_0$ to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ by the relation $S(y+n) = S_0(\\{y\\}) + n$, where $n = \\lfloor y \\rfloor$ is an integer and $\\{y\\}$ is the fractional part. This can be expressed as $S(y+1) = S(y)+1$. It can be verified that this construction yields a continuous, strictly increasing function $S$ satisfying $S(S(y))=y+1$.\n\n3.  **Cardinality of the construction**: Each unique choice of the function $\\psi$ yields a unique solution $S$, which in turn yields a unique solution $f$. The question of the cardinality of the set of solutions $f$ is now the cardinality of the set of possible functions $\\psi$.\n    *   A function $\\psi$ is a continuous, strictly increasing map from $[0, 1/2]$ to $[1/2, 1]$ with fixed endpoints.\n    *   We can show there are at least $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}|$ (the cardinality of the continuum) such functions. For any real number $a \\in (1/2, 1)$, we can define a function $\\psi_a$ as the piecewise linear function connecting the points $(0, 1/2)$, $(1/4, a)$, and $(1/2, 1)$. Each choice of $a$ gives a distinct, valid function $\\psi_a$. Since there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $a$, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions.\n    *   The set of all continuous functions on an interval has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. The set of possible functions $\\psi$ is a subset of this, so its cardinality is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Since the cardinality is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, it is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of functions $\\psi$ and the set of solutions $f$. Since the set of possible functions $\\psi$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, the set of continuous functions $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x))=e^x$ also has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The cardinality is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers).\n\n>>>$\\mathfrak{c}$"
