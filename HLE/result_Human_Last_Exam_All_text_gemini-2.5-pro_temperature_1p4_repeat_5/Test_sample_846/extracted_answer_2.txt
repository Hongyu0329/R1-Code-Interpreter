At sunrise, when exposed to sunlight (specifically the UV component), the table must change its shape from a straight, elongated form (representing the stable trans-isomer) to a bent, V-shape (representing the less stable cis-isomer). At sunset, in the absence of light, it must reverse this process, changing from the bent shape back to the straight, elongated shape as it "relaxes" into its more stable state.
