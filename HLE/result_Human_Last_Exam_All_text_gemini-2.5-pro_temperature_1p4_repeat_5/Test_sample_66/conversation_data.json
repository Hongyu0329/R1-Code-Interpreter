    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Flag of Tonga and its Matrix Representation\n1.  **Flag Structure:** The flag of Tonga has a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. Inside the white canton, there is a red \"couped cross\" (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n2.  **Matrix `M`:** We represent an image of the flag as an `m x n` matrix `M`. Each red pixel is assigned the value `a`, and each white pixel is assigned the value `b`.\n3.  **Goal:** We want to find the maximal possible rank of this matrix `M`. The term \"maximal possible\" implies we can choose the dimensions of the flag, canton, and cross, as well as the specific values of `a` and `b` (under reasonable assumptions), to maximize the rank.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Matrix Using Row Operations\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row operations. We can use this to simplify the problem.\n\n1.  **Matrix Structure:** The matrix `M` has a block structure. Let the canton have dimensions `m_c x n_c`.\n    ```\n        M = [ C  | A_1 ]\n            [----|-----]\n            [ A_2 | A_3 ]\n    ```\n    where `C` is the `m_c x n_c` matrix for the canton, and `A_1`, `A_2`, `A_3` are matrices where all entries are `a` (since these parts of the flag are red).\n\n2.  **Row Operations:** Any row below the `m_c`-th row is a vector of all `a`'s: `r_a = (a, a, ..., a)`. All these rows are identical.\n    Let's assume there is at least one such row (i.e., `m > m_c`), which is true for the Tongan flag.\n    We can perform the row operation `R_i -> R_i - r_a` for all rows `i` that are not `r_a`.\n    *   For any other all-`a` row, this operation makes it a zero row, which does not contribute to the rank.\n    *   For a row `R_i` that passes through the canton (`i <= m_c`), `R_i = (c_i, a, a, ...)`, where `c_i` is the i-th row of the canton matrix `C`. The operation `R_i - r_a` results in `(c_i - (a,..,a), 0,..,0)`.\n    Let's call `d = b - a`. The elements of `c_i - (a,..,a)` will be `b-a=d` (for white pixels) or `a-a=0` (for red pixels).\n\n3.  **Rank Decomposition:** After these operations, the row space of the new matrix is spanned by the vector `r_a` and the vectors corresponding to the modified canton rows. Let `S` be the binary matrix representing the shape of the canton (1 for white, 0 for red). The modified canton rows are of the form `(d*s_i, 0, ..., 0)`, where `s_i` is a row of `S`.\n    Assuming `a != 0` and the flag is wider than the canton (`n > n_c`), the vector `r_a` is linearly independent of the vectors `(d*s_i, 0, ..., 0)`.\n    Therefore, the rank of `M` is:\n    `rank(M) = rank({(d*s_i, 0, ..., 0)}) + rank({r_a})`\n    Assuming `a != b` (so `d != 0`), `rank({d*s_i}) = rank({s_i}) = rank(S)`.\n    So, `rank(M) = rank(S) + 1`.\n\n    *Careful Point:* For this formula to hold, we need `a != b` and `a != 0`. If `a = b`, the flag is monochromatic, and the rank is 1. If `a = 0`, the all-red parts vanish, and `rank(M) = rank(S)`. To maximize the rank, we choose `a` and `b` to be distinct and non-zero, which gives `rank(M) = rank(S) + 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Rank of the Canton Matrix `S`\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible rank of `S`, the binary matrix for the canton. `S` has 1s for white pixels and 0s for the red cross.\n\n1.  **Structure of `S`:** The red cross is a \"couped cross,\" which can be modeled as the union of two overlapping rectangles: a horizontal one (`Rect_H`) and a vertical one (`Rect_V`).\n    `S_{ij} = 0` if pixel `(i,j)` is in `Rect_H` or `Rect_V`, and `S_{ij} = 1` otherwise.\n\n2.  **Row Patterns in `S`:** A row in `S` is a binary vector. Its pattern is determined by which rectangles it intersects. Let's define the vertical regions of the canton:\n    *   `Y_H`: The set of row indices for `Rect_H`.\n    *   `Y_V`: The set of row indices for `Rect_V`.\n    Let's define the column regions of the canton:\n    *   `C_H`: The set of column indices for `Rect_H`.\n    *   `C_V`: The set of column indices for `Rect_V`.\n\n    A row `i` of `S` will have a pattern of 0s based on its position:\n    *   **Type 1:** If `i` is not in `Y_H` and not in `Y_V`, the row has no 0s. It's an all-ones vector: `(1, 1, ..., 1)`.\n    *   **Type 2:** If `i` is in `Y_H` but not `Y_V`, the row has 0s at columns in `C_H`.\n    *   **Type 3:** If `i` is in `Y_V` but not `Y_H`, the row has 0s at columns in `C_V`.\n    *   **Type 4:** If `i` is in `Y_H \\cap Y_V`, the row has 0s at columns in `C_H \\cup C_V`.\n\n3.  **Maximizing the Number of Linearly Independent Row Types:** We can have at most 4 distinct types of rows. The space of all possible rows is spanned by these four types. Let `j` be the all-ones vector, and `i_C` be the indicator vector for a set of columns `C`. The row types correspond to the vectors `{j, j-i_{C_H}, j-i_{C_V}, j-i_{C_H \\cup C_V}}`. The vector space they span is the same as the one spanned by `{j, i_{C_H}, i_{C_V}, i_{C_H \\cap C_V}}`.\n\n    *Careful Point:* To maximize the rank, we should choose the column sets `C_H` and `C_V` such that these four vectors are linearly independent. We can achieve this. For example, in a canton with `n_c >= 4` columns:\n    *   Let `C_H = {1, 3}`\n    *   Let `C_V = {2, 3}`\n    *   Then `C_H \\cap C_V = {3}`\n    The four basis vectors become `(1,1,1,1)`, `(1,0,1,0)`, `(0,1,1,0)`, and `(0,0,1,0)`. A quick check shows these are linearly independent.\n    This means the space of row patterns has a dimension of 4.\n\n4.  **Achieving the Maximal Rank:** Since the dimension of the space containing all possible row patterns is 4, `rank(S)` can be at most 4. To show it can be 4, we must show we can construct a matrix `S` that contains 4 linearly independent rows. We can do this by ensuring one row of each of the four types exists and that the types themselves are linearly independent.\n    *   **Choose row positions:** We can define the vertical rectangles `Y_H` and `Y_V` to overlap partially, e.g., `Y_H = {rows 10-20}` and `Y_V = {rows 15-25}`. This ensures there are rows that intersect only H, only V, both, and neither.\n    *   **Choose column positions:** As shown above, choose `C_H` and `C_V` so the four pattern types are linearly independent.\n\n    With these choices, we can form a submatrix of `S` by picking one row of each of the four types. This `4 x n_c` submatrix will have rank 4. Thus, `max(rank(S)) = 4`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nWe combine the results from the previous steps.\n*   We established `rank(M) = rank(S) + 1` for the maximal case.\n*   We found that the maximum possible rank of `S` is 4.\n\nTherefore, the maximal possible rank of the matrix `M` is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n\nFinal check of all points:\n- The analysis depends on an idealized, grid-based image of the flag.\n- It requires the freedom to choose the dimensions and layout of the flag's components to create the necessary row/column diversity.\n- It assumes we can choose scalar values `a` and `b` such that `a \\neq b` and `a \\neq 0`.\n\nUnder these standard interpretations for such a problem, the logic holds."
