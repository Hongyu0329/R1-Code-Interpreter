    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Question:** What would the oligomeric state be of this protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`? Based off of understanding of knobs-into-holes interactions and packing efficiency.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Pattern\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, designated `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n*   **Positions 'a' and 'd'** are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. They form the core of the coiled-coil, packing against each other in what is known as a \"knobs-into-holes\" interaction. The identity of these residues is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state.\n*   **Positions 'e' and 'g'** are often charged or polar residues that form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between adjacent helices.\n*   **Positions 'b', 'c', and 'f'** are exposed to the solvent and are typically hydrophilic.\n\n### Step 2: Assign the Heptad Register to the Sequence\n\nWe need to align the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` to the `(abcdefg)` pattern to identify which residues are in the core `a` and `d` positions. We look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues spaced by 2 and 3 residues (HxxHxxx). The key hydrophobic residues in the sequence are I, L, A, and W.\n\nLet's test possible alignments (registers):\nThe most plausible alignment places the most consistently hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions.\n\nLet's try a register where the first Isoleucine (I) is at the `a` position.\n*   **Sequence:**   G E **I** A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G\n*   **Register:**    f g **a** b c d **e** f g **a** b c d **e** f g **a** b c d **e** f g **a** b c d **e** f\n\nLet's tabulate the residues at each position based on this register:\n*   **Position a:** I, I, I, I\n*   **Position b:** A, A, A, A\n*   **Position c:** Q, K, W, Q\n*   **Position d:** S, S, S, S  <- This is not correct. Serine (S) is polar and would not form a stable hydrophobic core.\n\nLet's try a different register. A very common pattern is for `a` and `d` to be large hydrophobic amino acids. Let's look at `I` and `L`. Let's assume the `I` at position 3 is `a` and the `L` at position 7 is `d`.\n*   **Sequence:** G E **I** A Q S **L** ...\n*   **Register:** f g **a** b c d **e** ...\nThis would place `S` at `d` which is not ideal.\n\nLet's try another register. What if the `I` at position 3 is `d` and the `L` at position 7 is `g`?\n*   **Sequence:** G E **I** A Q S **L** ...\n*   **Register:** a b **c** d e f **g** ...\nThis would place `I` at `c` which is not ideal.\n\nLet's re-examine the sequence and look for the most robust hydrophobic pattern. `...I A x S L...`, `...I A x S L...`, `...I A W S L...`, `...I A Q S L...`. The pattern `L-x-x-x-I-A-x` or `I-A-x-S-L-K-E` seems to repeat. The most stable hydrophobic core would be formed by the most hydrophobic residues. Let's try placing `I` at `a` and `L` at `d`.\n\n*   **Sequence:** `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n*   **Register:**  `f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f`\n\nLet's analyze this proposed register.\n*   **Position a (hydrophobic core):** I, I, I, I\n*   **Position d (hydrophobic core):** L, L, W, L\n*   **Position e (ionic interaction):** K, K, K, K\n*   **Position g (ionic interaction):** E, E, E, Q\n\nThis register is highly plausible. The `a` and `d` positions are consistently filled with large hydrophobic residues (I, L, W), which is the hallmark of a coiled-coil. The `e` and `g` positions are filled with charged/polar residues (K, E, Q), suitable for forming stabilizing inter-helical salt bridges.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Core Packing to Predict Oligomeric State\n\nThe specific identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions dictates the packing geometry and thus the number of helices in the bundle.\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Typically has a mixture of beta-branched (I, V) and non-beta-branched (L, A) residues at *both* `a` and `d` positions. There is no strong preference for one type at a specific position.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Famously shows a strong preference. The steric hindrance is minimized when beta-branched residues (with a branch at the second carbon, like **Isoleucine** and Valine) are placed at the `a` position, and non-beta-branched residues (**Leucine**, Alanine, Methionine) are at the `d` position.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** To reduce steric clash in the very crowded core, tetramers require a small residue (like Alanine) at the `a` position and a large hydrophobic residue (like Leucine or Isoleucine) at the `d` position.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Rules to the Sequence\n\nLet's review our findings from Step 2:\n*   **'a' positions:** I, I, I, I (all are Isoleucine, which is a **beta-branched** hydrophobic residue)\n*   **'d' positions:** L, L, W, L (Leucine and Tryptophan are both large **non-beta-branched** hydrophobic residues)\n\nThis pattern perfectly matches the canonical signature for a **trimeric coiled-coil**.\n*   The placement of the beta-branched Isoleucine exclusively at the `a` position.\n*   The placement of non-beta-branched hydrophobic residues (L, W) exclusively at the `d` position.\n\nA dimeric structure is less likely because of this very specific segregation. A tetrameric structure is highly unlikely because the bulky Isoleucine at the `a` positions would cause severe steric clashes in a four-helix bundle.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the strong `(I at a, L/W at d)` pattern in the hydrophobic core, the sequence is optimized for \"knobs-into-holes\" packing in a three-helix bundle. Therefore, the protein is most likely to form a trimer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
