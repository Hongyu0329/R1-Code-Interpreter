    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the name of a single, specific genus of mushroom. The key identifying characteristic given is that it is the only one known to produce a \"distinctly blue spore print\".\n\n2.  **Initial Research and Common Knowledge:** Spore print color is a fundamental characteristic used for mushroom identification. Common colors include white, cream, pink, brown, purple-brown, and black. A blue spore print is exceptionally rare, and most mycological guides and charts do not list blue as a possible spore print color. This immediately suggests the question might be tricky or based on a rare exception.\n\n3.  **Investigating Potential Candidates:**\n    *   The most famous blue mushroom is the Indigo Milk Cap, whose scientific name is *Lactifluus indigo* (it was formerly classified in the genus *Lactarius*). This mushroom is known for its striking blue color and the blue \"latex\" or \"milk\" it exudes when cut.\n    *   Because of its intense blue coloration, it is a very common misconception that *Lactifluus indigo* also has a blue spore print.\n\n4.  **Verifying the Spore Print Color:**\n    *   Consulting authoritative mycological sources (such as \"MushroomExpert.com\" by Michael Kuo, academic papers, and modern field guides) confirms that the spore print of *Lactifluus indigo* is **not blue**. It is consistently described as creamy white to pale yellow.\n    *   Leading mycologists explicitly state that to their knowledge, no mushroom produces a truly blue spore print. Some mushrooms, like *Chlorophyllum molybdites*, can have a greenish print, but blue is not a recognized color for a macroscopic spore deposit.\n\n5.  **Reconciling the Question with the Facts:**\n    *   The premise of the question—that a genus with a blue spore print exists—appears to be factually incorrect.\n    *   However, this type of question is common in trivia, where well-known myths or misconceptions are sometimes presented as fact to test knowledge of that specific subject.\n    *   Given the widespread myth about the Indigo Milk Cap, it is overwhelmingly likely that the question is alluding to this mushroom. The intended answer is the genus of the mushroom famously (though incorrectly) associated with a blue spore print.\n\n6.  **Identifying the Correct Genus Name:**\n    *   The Indigo Milk Cap (*indigo*) was long placed in the genus *Lactarius*.\n    *   Following modern phylogenetic research in the 2010s, it and many related species were reclassified into the new genus *Lactifluus*.\n    *   Therefore, the most current and accurate genus name for this mushroom is *Lactifluus*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAlthough no mushroom genus is scientifically recognized as having a blue spore print, the question is a well-known piece of trivia that plays on a common misconception about the Indigo Milk Cap. This mushroom is famous for its vibrant blue color, leading many to believe its spores are also blue. The genus for this mushroom is *Lactifluus*.\n\n<<<Lactifluus>>>"
