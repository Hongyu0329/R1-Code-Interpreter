    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the equilibrium points**\n\nAn equilibrium point of the differential equation $x'(t) = f(x(t))$ is a value of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. These are also called fixed points or critical points.\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. To find the equilibrium points, we need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square:\n$$ -x(x - 1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\nSo, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can use the linearization method. We analyze the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at the equilibrium point.\nThe rule is:\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable (specifically, asymptotically stable).\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point $x^*$ is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use other methods.\n\nFirst, let's compute the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, let's test each equilibrium point:\n\n**For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\nEvaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=0$:\n$$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\nSince $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n**For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\nEvaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=1$:\n$$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\nSince $f'(1) = 0$, the linearization method is inconclusive. We need to analyze the behavior of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$. We can do this by examining the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1** (e.g., $x = 1 + \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$):\n    *   $-x$ is negative (approximately -1).\n    *   $(x-1)^2 = \\epsilon^2$ is positive.\n    *   Therefore, $f(x) = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$.\n    *   Since $f(x) = x'(t) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing and moves towards $x=1$. This indicates stability from the right.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly less than 1** (e.g., $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$):\n    *   $-x$ is negative (approximately -1).\n    *   $(x-1)^2 = (-\\epsilon)^2 = \\epsilon^2$ is positive.\n    *   Therefore, $f(x) = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$.\n    *   Since $f(x) = x'(t) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing and moves away from $x=1$ (towards $x=0$). This indicates instability from the left.\n\nAn equilibrium point that is stable from one side and unstable from the other is called a semi-stable equilibrium point. For an equilibrium to be considered stable (in the sense of Lyapunov stability), solutions that start sufficiently close must remain close for all future times. Since solutions starting just to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, $x=1$ is not Lyapunov stable. Therefore, $x=1$ is classified as an **unstable** equilibrium point.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of stable equilibrium points ($m$)**\n\nBased on our analysis in Step 2:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is an unstable equilibrium point.\n\nThus, there is only one stable equilibrium point.\nThe number of stable equilibrium points is $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final expression**\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$ m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1-2^4048>>>"
