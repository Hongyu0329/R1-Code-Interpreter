    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the components of the question\n\n*   **Qudit:** A quantum system living in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S$, where $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_S) = d$. A density matrix $\\rho$ for such a system is a $d \\times d$ matrix.\n*   **Generalized Pauli Operators:** For a $d$-dimensional system, there is a set of $d^2$ unitary operators $\\{U_{ij}\\}_{i,j=0}^{d-1}$ that form an orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. These are the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators). We can label them with a single index $k$ from $0$ to $d^2-1$, so we have $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$, with $U_0 = I$ (the identity matrix). A key property is that the product of any two Pauli operators is another Pauli operator, up to a phase factor.\n*   **Pauli Channel ($\\Lambda$):** A Pauli channel is a quantum channel whose Kraus operators are proportional to the generalized Pauli operators. Its action on a density matrix $\\rho$ can be written as:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$\n    where $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{k} p_k = 1$). The Kraus operators for this channel are $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$.\n*   **Complementary Channel ($\\tilde{\\Lambda}$):** Any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ from a system S to itself can be viewed as the result of the system S interacting with an environment E, followed by tracing out the environment. The complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ describes the information that \"leaks\" into the environment. It's the map from the system's state space to the environment's state space.\n*   **Rank of a Channel:** The rank of a quantum channel is the dimension of the space of output states. Equivalently, it is the rank of the channel's Choi matrix. A more direct way to calculate the rank of a complementary channel is needed.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a formula for the rank of the complementary channel\n\nThe Stinespring dilation theorem allows us to represent a channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{K_k\\}$ via an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_S \\to \\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$, where $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is the environment Hilbert space. The complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_S) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is given by $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n\nA standard result in quantum information theory relates the rank of the complementary channel to the Kraus operators of the original channel. The rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the dimension of the linear space spanned by the operator products $K_j^\\dagger K_i$.\n    $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{ K_j^\\dagger K_i \\})$\nwhere the indices $i$ and $j$ run over the set for which the corresponding Kraus operators are non-zero.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the formula to the Pauli Channel\n\nFor a Pauli channel, the Kraus operators are $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. Let $S = \\{k \\mid p_k > 0\\}$ be the set of indices for which the probabilities are non-zero.\nThe operators we need to consider are:\n    $K_j^\\dagger K_i = (\\sqrt{p_j} U_j)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_i} U_i) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} U_j^\\dagger U_i$\nfor all $i, j \\in S$.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is the dimension of the space spanned by these operators:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{ U_j^\\dagger U_i \\mid i,j \\in S \\})$\n\n### Step 4: Using the algebraic properties of Pauli operators\n\nThe set of generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$ has a group-like structure under multiplication. The product of two Pauli operators, $U_j^\\dagger U_i$, is always proportional to another Pauli operator, say $U_m$.\n    $U_j^\\dagger U_i = c_{ij} U_m$\nwhere $c_{ij}$ is a phase factor and the index $m$ is determined by $i$ and $j$. The set of indices $\\{0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1\\}$ corresponds to the group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d$, and the multiplication corresponds to group subtraction, i.e., $m = i-j$ (in the group).\n\nThe set of operators spanning our space is therefore $\\{c_{ij}U_m \\mid i,j \\in S, m = i-j\\}$. The span of this set is the same as the span of $\\{U_m \\mid m \\in S-S\\}$, where $S-S = \\{i-j \\mid i,j \\in S\\}$ is the difference set of $S$.\n\nSince the Pauli operators $\\{U_m\\}$ for different $m$ are linearly independent (they are, in fact, orthogonal), the dimension of this span is simply the number of distinct indices $m$ that are generated.\n    $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = |S-S|$\n\n### Step 5: Maximizing the Rank\n\nThe problem asks for the *maximal rank*. This means we need to find the maximum possible value of $|S-S|$ by choosing a suitable Pauli channel (which means choosing the set $S$).\n1.  The set $S$ is a subset of the index group $G = \\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d$.\n2.  The difference set $S-S$ is therefore also a subset of $G$.\n3.  The maximum possible size of $S-S$ is the size of the group $G$ itself, which is $|G|=d^2$.\n4.  Can we find a set $S$ such that $|S-S| = d^2$? Yes. If we choose $S=G$, then $S-S=G$.\n5.  What does the choice $S=G$ mean for the Pauli channel? It means we must choose a channel where all probabilities $p_k$ are non-zero for $k=0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1$.\n6.  A valid channel with this property exists. The most common example is the **completely depolarizing channel**, where $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k$. This is a valid probability distribution, and thus defines a valid Pauli channel.\n\nFor the completely depolarizing channel, the support set is $S = G$, so $|S-S| = |G| = d^2$. Therefore, the rank of its complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\nSince the rank is the dimension of a subspace of $d \\times d$ matrices, it cannot exceed $d^2$. Because we found a channel that achieves this upper bound, $d^2$ is the maximal possible rank.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is $\\dim(\\text{span}\\{ K_j^\\dagger K_i \\})$.\n2.  For a Pauli channel, this becomes $\\dim(\\text{span}\\{ U_j^\\dagger U_i \\})$ where $i,j$ are indices of non-zero Pauli terms.\n3.  This is equivalent to $|S-S|$, where $S$ is the set of indices of the Pauli operators in the channel's definition.\n4.  The goal is to maximize $|S-S|$ for $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d$.\n5.  The maximum value is $|\\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d| = d^2$.\n6.  This maximum is achieved by a valid Pauli channel, for example, the depolarizing channel for which $S = \\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d$.\n7.  Therefore, the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
