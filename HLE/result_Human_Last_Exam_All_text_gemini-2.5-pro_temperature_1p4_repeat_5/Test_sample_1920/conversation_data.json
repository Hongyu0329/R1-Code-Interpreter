    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   $53599$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Dividing by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Dividing 7657 by 13: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Dividing 589 by 19: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n*   31 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. This is a square-free integer. Let's denote the prime factors as $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n**Step 2: Properties of primitive characters for a square-free conductor**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive with conductor $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$\nwhere each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive Dirichlet character modulo $p_i$.\n\nA character $\\chi_i$ modulo a prime $p_i$ is primitive if and only if it is not the trivial character (the character that maps all integers coprime to $p_i$ to 1). The trivial character is the only one with conductor 1; all other characters modulo $p_i$ have conductor $p_i$.\n\nTherefore, for $\\chi$ to be a primitive character with conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a non-trivial character modulo $p_i$. This means the order of each $\\chi_i$, denoted $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be greater than 1 ($k_i > 1$).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the order of the character**\n\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6. The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\nThis condition imposes two constraints on the orders $k_i$:\n1.  Each $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6. So, $k_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n2.  Combining with the primitivity condition ($k_i > 1$), the possible orders for each component character are $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n3.  For the lcm to be 6, the set of orders $\\{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4\\}$ must contain at least one number divisible by 2 (i.e., an order of 2 or 6) and at least one number divisible by 3 (i.e., an order of 3 or 6).\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of possible component characters**\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p_i$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $p_i-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p_i-1$.\n\nLet's check the orders of the groups for our primes:\n*   $p_1=7$: $p_1-1 = 6$. Orders 2, 3, 6 are all possible.\n*   $p_2=13$: $p_2-1 = 12$. Orders 2, 3, 6 are all possible.\n*   $p_3=19$: $p_3-1 = 18$. Orders 2, 3, 6 are all possible.\n*   $p_4=31$: $p_4-1 = 30$. Orders 2, 3, 6 are all possible.\n\nFor each prime factor $p_i$, let's count the number of available non-trivial characters with orders dividing 6:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nSo, for each component $\\chi_i$, there are $1+2+2=5$ possible choices of characters whose orders are in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the component characters using Inclusion-Exclusion**\n\nWe need to find the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ is chosen from the 5 available options, subject to the condition that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all possible 4-tuples where each $\\chi_i$ has an order from $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. Since there are 5 choices for each of the 4 components, the total number of tuples is $|S| = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we subtract the tuples that do not satisfy the lcm condition. The lcm is not 6 if the set of orders $\\{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4\\}$ lacks a multiple of 2, or lacks a multiple of 3.\n\n*   **Case A: The lcm is not divisible by 3.**\n    This occurs if all orders $k_i$ are not divisible by 3. From the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, this means all $k_i$ must be 2.\n    For each component $\\chi_i$, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2.\n    The number of such tuples is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n*   **Case B: The lcm is not divisible by 2.**\n    This occurs if all orders $k_i$ are not divisible by 2. From the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, this means all $k_i$ must be 3.\n    For each component $\\chi_i$, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3.\n    The number of such tuples is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   **Overlap (A and B): The lcm is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3.**\n    This would mean all orders $k_i$ are not divisible by 2 or 3. This is not possible as the only orders available are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. The number of such tuples is 0.\n\nBy the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the number of \"bad\" tuples (where the lcm is not 6) is the sum of the counts for Case A and Case B, minus their overlap.\nNumber of bad tuples = $1 + 16 - 0 = 17$.\n\nThe number of \"good\" tuples (where the lcm is 6) is the total number of tuples minus the number of bad tuples.\nNumber of desired characters = $|S| - (\\text{Number of bad tuples}) = 625 - 17 = 608$.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $53599$ and order $6$ is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
