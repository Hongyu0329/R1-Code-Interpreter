    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), one must first identify the number of each type of atom in the molecule and then ascertain the number of functions assigned to each atom by the basis set.\n\nToluene's chemical formula, C7H8, indicates it is composed of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe 6-31G basis set is what is known as a split-valence double-zeta basis set. The designation specifies how atomic orbitals are represented:\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom**, a \"heavy atom,\" the 6-31G basis set provides:\n    *   One contracted function for the inner core (1s) orbital, which is a combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   The valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals) is \"split.\" It uses one set of contracted functions made from 3 primitives and another set made from a single primitive function for the outer valence. This results in two functions for the 2s orbital and two functions for each of the three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz).\n    *   In total, each carbon atom is described by 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 2*3 (for 2p) = 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom**, which has no core electrons, the 1s orbital is the valence orbital.\n    *   The basis set is split into an inner part, a contracted function of 3 primitive Gaussians, and an outer part, a single primitive Gaussian function.\n    *   This results in a total of 2 contracted Gaussian functions for each hydrogen atom.\n\nTo calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire toluene molecule, we sum the functions for all of its constituent atoms:\n\n*   **Carbon atoms**: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Hydrogen atoms**: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total**: 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\n<<<79>>>"
