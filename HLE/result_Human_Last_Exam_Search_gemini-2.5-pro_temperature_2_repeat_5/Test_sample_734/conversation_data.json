    "### Thomas Aquinas Developed a Specialized Theological Vocabulary for Changes in Natural Law\n\nThe Christian theologian who first systematically developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Thomas Aquinas**. He refined and structured a vocabulary that had earlier roots in the writings of Augustine of Hippo.\n\nAquinas's key contribution was the formal distinction between divine actions that are **\"contra naturam\"** (against nature) and those that are **\"praeter naturam\"** (beyond or outside of nature). This framework provided a nuanced way to understand miracles and other divine interventions in the created order.\n\nIn his extensive work, particularly the *Summa Theologiae*, Aquinas classified miracles based on their relationship to the natural order which God himself established. He categorized them as follows:\n*   **Events *supra naturam* (above nature):** These are events that nature cannot bring about under any circumstances, such as the Incarnation and the glorification of bodies in the resurrection.\n*   **Events *contra naturam* (against nature):** These are occurrences where God does something contrary to the normal course and inclination of a specific nature. A key example of this is the virgin birth, as it goes against the natural process of human reproduction. The raising of the dead would also fall into this category.\n*   **Events *praeter naturam* (beyond or outside of nature):** These are events where God does something that nature could potentially do, but not in that specific way, at that speed, or in that quantity. Miraculous healings are often categorized this way, as the body can heal itself, but not instantaneously as in a miracle.\n\nWhile Augustine of Hippo had earlier described miracles as being \"*contra naturam quae nobis est nota*\" (against nature as it is known to us), Aquinas's systematization of these terms into distinct categories marks a more developed and specialized theological vocabulary.\n\nThis terminology is also applicable to understanding the theological concept of the Fall of Man. Theologians following Augustine believed that the Fall resulted in a corruption of human nature. Aquinas's framework can be used to describe this change. The state of \"original justice\" in the Garden of Eden could be seen as a state \"praeter naturam,\" where humanity was endowed with gifts beyond its basic nature. The consequences of the Fall, such as the introduction of death and concupiscence, represent a shift in the operation of natural laws as they pertain to humanity. While not a miracle in the same way as the virgin birth, the alteration of nature at the Fall can be analyzed using this theological lexicon of divine action in relation to the established natural order. For example, some medieval theologians used the term *praeter naturam* to describe additions to the post-Fall human condition, such as the need for clothing and the establishment of private property, which were not part of the original created nature but are not strictly contrary to it.\n\nIn conclusion, while Augustine laid the foundation, it was Thomas Aquinas who developed a sophisticated and specialized terminology—primarily the distinction between *contra naturam* and *praeter naturam*—that could be applied to understand and describe different modes of divine action that alter the expected course of nature, including both the miracle of the virgin birth and the theological understanding of the changed state of nature after the Fall.\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
