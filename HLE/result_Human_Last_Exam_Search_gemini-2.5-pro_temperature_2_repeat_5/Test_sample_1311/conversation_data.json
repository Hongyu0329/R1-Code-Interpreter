    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as samuraciclib or SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined as a potent inhibitor.\n\nThe half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀), a common measure of a compound's potency and an indicator of its binding affinity, is reported to be approximately 40-41 nM. Specifically, sources state that samuraciclib is a selective CDK7 inhibitor with an IC₅₀ value of 41 nM or 40 nM. This value falls within the 0.1 to 100 nM range.\n\n<<<B>>>"
