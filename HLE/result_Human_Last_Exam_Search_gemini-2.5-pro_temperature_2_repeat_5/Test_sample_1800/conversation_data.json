    "The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing the catalytic performance of Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is highly dependent on the specific reaction, with different optimal ratios identified for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and for water splitting.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, the catalytic activity of Ni/CeO₂ catalysts is sensitive to the nickel loading. Research indicates that a high conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) is achieved with specific weight percentages of nickel. One study found that the highest CO conversion (97.8%) was obtained with a 12.5 wt% Ni/CeO₂ catalyst at 400 °C. Another study also showed that increasing the Ni content from 1 to 8 wt% on a CeO₂-Al₂O₃ support led to increased catalytic activity. In another research, a 10 wt% Ni content on CeO₂ was used.\n\nTo compare these with the ratios for water splitting, these weight percentages can be converted to approximate Ni/Ce molar ratios:\n*   **12.5 wt% Ni** corresponds to a Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately **0.42**.\n*   **10 wt% Ni** corresponds to a Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately **0.33**.\n*   **8 wt% Ni** corresponds to a Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately **0.25**.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn the context of water splitting, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio differs for the two half-reactions: the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER).\n\n*   **Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER):** For the OER, which is a key part of water splitting, Ni-rich compositions have been shown to be more effective. A study on NiyCe100-yOx electrocatalysts found that compositions of **Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ (a Ni/Ce molar ratio of 3)** and **Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ (a Ni/Ce molar ratio of 1)** demonstrated higher OER activities. The Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ catalyst, in particular, also exhibited excellent long-term stability. This enhanced activity is attributed to a larger concentration of oxygen vacancy defects.\n\n*   **Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER):** For the HER, an investigation into Ni₃N-CeO₂/NF catalysts with varying Ce/Ni molar ratios found that a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (which corresponds to a Ni/Ce molar ratio of 0.5)** exhibited the optimal HER performance.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn conclusion, there is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio that maximizes catalytic performance for both the WGS reaction and water splitting. The optimal ratio is reaction-dependent:\n\n*   For the **Water Gas Shift reaction**, a lower Ni content appears to be favorable, with optimal performance seen at Ni loadings of 10-12.5 wt%, corresponding to a **Ni/Ce molar ratio in the range of approximately 0.33-0.42**.\n\n*   For **water splitting**, the ideal ratio varies between the two half-reactions. A significantly higher Ni content, with a **Ni/Ce molar ratio of 1 to 3**, is beneficial for the **Oxygen Evolution Reaction**. In contrast, a **Ni/Ce molar ratio of 0.5** is optimal for the **Hydrogen Evolution Reaction**.\n\nTherefore, the choice of the Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles must be tailored to the specific catalytic application.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is reaction-dependent, with an approximate molar ratio range of 0.33-0.42 being optimal for the Water Gas Shift reaction, while for water splitting, a ratio of 1-3 is ideal for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction and 0.5 is optimal for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction.>>>"
