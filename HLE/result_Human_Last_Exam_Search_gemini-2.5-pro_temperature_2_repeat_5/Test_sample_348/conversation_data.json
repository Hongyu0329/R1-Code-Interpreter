    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\nThe supply and demand functions are given as:\nSupply: P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)\nDemand: P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))\n\nAt equilibrium, Q_S = Q_D = Q* and the price P is the same. Therefore, we set the two equations equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity (Q*):\nln(Q*³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q*))\n\nSolving this equation for Q* requires numerical methods as it cannot be solved analytically. Using a numerical solver or a graphing calculator to find the intersection of the two functions, we find that the equilibrium quantity is approximately:\nQ* ≈ 4.688\n\nNow, we substitute this value of Q* back into either the supply or demand equation to find the equilibrium price (P*). Using the demand function:\nP* = 18e^(-arctan(4.688)) ≈ 18e^(-1.36) ≈ 4.60\n\nSo, the market equilibrium is approximately (Q*, P*) = (4.688, 4.60).\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It is calculated as the area between the demand curve and the supply curve from the minimum quantity to the equilibrium quantity. The supply function is defined for Q > ∛2 ≈ 1.26.\n\nTotal Welfare (TW) = Consumer Surplus (CS) + Producer Surplus (PS)\nTW = ∫[from ∛2 to Q*] (Demand(Q) - Supply(Q)) dQ\nTW = ∫[from 1.26 to 4.688] (18e^(-arctan(Q)) - ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\n\nThis definite integral must also be solved using numerical integration. Online integral calculators can be used to evaluate this expression.\n\nEvaluating the integral numerically, we get:\nTW ≈ 13.38\n\nTherefore, the total welfare is approximately 13.38.\n\n<<<13.38>>>"
