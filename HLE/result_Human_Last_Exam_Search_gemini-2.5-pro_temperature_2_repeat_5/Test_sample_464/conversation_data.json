    "Yes, it follows that $f = 0$. Here is the reasoning:\n\nLet $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Schwartz class function. By definition, $f$ is infinitely differentiable and, along with all its derivatives, decays at infinity faster than any inverse power of $|x|$. The condition given is that all the moments of $f$ are zero:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all non-negative integers } k \\ge 0 $$\nNote: The prompt specified $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. In the context of moments, this is standardly assumed to mean for all non-negative integers $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. If $k=0$ were excluded, the conclusion would not necessarily follow.\n\nConsider the Fourier transform of $f(x)$, which we denote by $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\nA crucial property of the Schwartz space is that the Fourier transform is a one-to-one and onto mapping of the Schwartz space onto itself. This means that $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is also a Schwartz function, and if we can show that $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is identically zero, it will imply that $f(x)$ is also identically zero.\n\nWe can relate the derivatives of the Fourier transform to the moments of the original function. Since $f$ is a Schwartz function, we can differentiate under the integral sign:\n$$ \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} (e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\nEvaluating these derivatives at $\\xi = 0$, we get:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx $$\nThe initial condition states that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$. This directly implies that all derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin are zero:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0 $$\nSince $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function, it is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$). In general, a $C^\\infty$ function with all derivatives at a point being zero is not necessarily the zero function (a common counterexample is the function $g(x)=e^{-1/x^2}$ for $x \\neq 0$ and $g(0)=0$). However, such counterexamples are not Schwartz functions because they do not satisfy the required decay conditions at infinity.\n\nA fundamental theorem in analysis states that a Schwartz function which is \"flat\" at a point (meaning the function and all its derivatives are zero at that point) must be the identically zero function. This property arises from the strong constraints imposed by combining smoothness with rapid decay at infinity.\n\nSince $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is a Schwartz function and all of its derivatives vanish at $\\xi=0$, it must be that $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFinally, because the Fourier transform is a bijection on the space of Schwartz functions, if $\\hat{f} \\equiv 0$, it follows that the original function $f$ must also be identically zero.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
