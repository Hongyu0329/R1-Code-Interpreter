    "The rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership grade of the rule's consequent. In this case, the firing strength is given by `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, and the membership grade of the consequent is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation in fuzzy logic. Since the specific t-norm was not defined in the query, the activation level can be calculated using two of the most common t-norms:\n\n1.  **Minimum T-norm:** This is the most frequently used t-norm and is calculated as the minimum of the two values.\n    *   Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n2.  **Product T-norm:** This t-norm is calculated by multiplying the two values.\n    *   Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nTherefore, depending on the specific t-norm implementation, the rule activation level would be either 0.7 (for the minimum t-norm) or 0.63 (for the product t-norm).\n\n<<<The rule activation level is 0.7 using the minimum t-norm, or 0.63 using the product t-norm.>>>"
