    "The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields. The key elements that define this formula are the Euclidean action, the use of Grassmann variables to represent fermionic fields, and the specific boundary conditions imposed on these fields in imaginary time.\n\nThe partition function Z in quantum statistical mechanics is defined as the trace of the thermal density matrix:\n`Z = Tr(e^(-βH))`\nwhere `H` is the Hamiltonian of the system and `β` is the inverse temperature (`1/k_B T`).\n\nUsing Feynman's path integral formalism, this trace can be expressed as a sum over all possible field histories in imaginary time `τ`, where `τ` ranges from 0 to `β`. For fermions, these field \"histories\" are represented by functions that take on values in the algebra of Grassmann numbers. This is necessary to correctly account for the anticommuting nature of fermion operators and the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nThe resulting formula for the fermionic partition function is:\n\n`Z = ∫Dψ̄Dψ e^(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])`\n\nwhere:\n*   **ψ(x, τ)** and **ψ̄(x, τ)** are independent Grassmann-valued fields, representing the fermion and its conjugate. These are functions of spatial position `x` and imaginary time `τ`.\n*   **∫Dψ̄Dψ** represents the functional integral, also known as the Berezin integral for Grassmann fields, over all possible configurations of these fields.\n*   **S_E[ψ̄, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system. It is obtained from the standard action in real-time by a Wick rotation (`t → -iτ`). The general form of the Euclidean action is:\n\n    `S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x L_E(ψ̄(x, τ), ψ(x, τ))`\n\n    Here, `L_E` is the Euclidean Lagrangian density. For a simple non-interacting fermionic gas, the action takes the form:\n\n    `S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ̄(x, τ) (ħ∂/∂τ - (ħ²∇²)/(2m) - μ) ψ(x, τ)`\n\n    where `μ` is the chemical potential.\n\nA crucial feature distinguishing the fermionic path integral from its bosonic counterpart is the boundary condition imposed on the Grassmann fields in the imaginary time direction. Due to the fermionic statistics, the fields must be **anti-periodic** over the interval `β`:\n\n**ψ(x, β) = -ψ(x, 0)**\n**ψ̄(x, β) = -ψ̄(x, 0)**\n\nThese anti-periodic boundary conditions are a direct consequence of the trace operation in the definition of the partition function when evaluated for fermionic states. The path integral is thus performed over all Grassmann field configurations that satisfy this condition.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is given by:\n`Z = ∫Dψ̄Dψ exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])`\nwhere the integral is a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields `ψ` and `ψ̄`. These fields must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time `τ` over the interval `[0, β]`, such that `ψ(τ+β) = -ψ(τ)`. `S_E` is the Euclidean action for the fermionic system, typically of the form `S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ̄(∂_τ + H)ψ`, where `H` is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator.>>>"
