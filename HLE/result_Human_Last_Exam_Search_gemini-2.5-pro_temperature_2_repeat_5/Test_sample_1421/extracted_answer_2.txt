The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is given by:
`Z = ∫Dψ̄Dψ exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])`
where the integral is a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields `ψ` and `ψ̄`. These fields must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time `τ` over the interval `[0, β]`, such that `ψ(τ+β) = -ψ(τ)`. `S_E` is the Euclidean action for the fermionic system, typically of the form `S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ̄(∂_τ + H)ψ`, where `H` is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator.
