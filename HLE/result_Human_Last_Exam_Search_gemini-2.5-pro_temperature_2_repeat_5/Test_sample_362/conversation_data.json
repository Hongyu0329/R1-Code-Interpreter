    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts a carbonyl group (from an aldehyde or ketone) into a C=C double bond (an alkene) using a phosphorus ylide. The reaction involves a nucleophilic addition of the ylide to the aldehyde, forming a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane, which then decomposes to the final alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nThe reactants in this specific case are:\n*   **Aldehyde**: Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO. It is a sterically hindered aldehyde.\n*   **Wittig Reagent**: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This IUPAC name describes a triphenylphosphine group attached via a double bond to an ethylidene group that is substituted on its second carbon with a 2-chlorophenyl group. The structure of this ylide is (C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\nThe reaction joins the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde with the ylidic carbon (the one bonded to phosphorus) to form a new carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nThe structure of the resulting product is:\n(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\nThe IUPAC name for this alkene is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nRegarding stereochemistry, the ylide used, (C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), is classified as a non-stabilized ylide because the ylidic carbon is not attached to an electron-withdrawing group like an ester or ketone. Reactions of non-stabilized ylides with aldehydes typically lead to the formation of the (Z)-alkene as the major product. For the product 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, the Z-isomer would have the two larger substituent groups, the tert-butyl group [-C(CH₃)₃] and the 2-chlorobenzyl group [-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl)], on the same side of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nTherefore, the principal product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**, along with the byproduct triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene"
