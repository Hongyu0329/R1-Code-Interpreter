    "To determine the value of `log_2(n)`, we first need to understand the SKI combinator expression and the Church integer `n` it represents. The given expression is:\n\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nThis expression can be broken down into more manageable parts by identifying common combinators.\n\n### Key Combinators:\n\n*   **S, K, I**: These are the fundamental combinators with the following reduction rules:\n    *   `Sxyz = xz(yz)`\n    *   `Kxy = x`\n    *   `Ix = x`\n*   **B Combinator (Function Composition)**: The expression `S(K(S))(K)` (and its equivalent `S(KS)K`) is the `B` combinator, which composes two functions: `Bfgx = f(gx)`.\n*   **Church Numeral for 2 (TWO)**: In SKI calculus, a Church numeral `m` is a higher-order function that applies a function `f` to an argument `x`, `m` times. The numeral for 2, which we'll call `TWO`, can be represented as `S(B)(I)` which simplifies to `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`.\n*   **U Combinator (Self-application)**: The expression `S(I)(I)` is the `U` combinator, which applies its argument to itself: `Ux = xx`.\n\n### Simplifying the Expression\n\nLet's substitute these known combinators into the original expression:\n\nThe expression has the structure `S(I)(A)(Y)`, where:\n*   `A = S(I)(S(I)(K(TWO)))`\n*   `Y = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))` which simplifies to `S(B)(U)`.\n\nAn expression of the form `S(I)(A)(Y)` reduces as follows: `S(I)(A)(Y)` -> `I(Y)(A(Y))` -> `Y(A(Y))`.\nHowever, a more direct reduction pathway is to recognize the entire expression as an application. Let `X = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(TWO))))` and `Y = S(B)(U)`. The expression is then `X(Y)`.\n\nThe term `X` is a function that takes an argument (let's call it `y`) and applies it repeatedly. Specifically, `X = λy. y(y(y(TWO)))`. When `X` is applied to `Y`, the expression for `n` becomes:\n\n`n = Y(Y(Y(TWO)))`\n\nThis means the Church integer `n` is the result of applying the operator `Y` three times to the Church integer `TWO`.\n\n### The Squaring Operator\n\nThe crucial step is to identify the operation that `Y = S(B)(U) = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` performs on a Church numeral. This specific combination of combinators is known to be the **squaring operator**. It takes a Church numeral `m` and returns the Church numeral for `m²`.\n\nSo, the operator `Y` performs the function `Y(m) = m²`.\n\n### Calculating the Value of n\n\nNow we can calculate `n` by starting with `TWO` (the Church numeral for 2) and applying the squaring operator `Y` three times:\n\n1.  **First application**: `Y(TWO) = 2² = 4`\n2.  **Second application**: `Y(4) = 4² = 16`\n3.  **Third application**: `Y(16) = 16² = 256`\n\nThus, the Church integer `n` is 256.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(256)`\nSince `2⁸ = 256`, the answer is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
