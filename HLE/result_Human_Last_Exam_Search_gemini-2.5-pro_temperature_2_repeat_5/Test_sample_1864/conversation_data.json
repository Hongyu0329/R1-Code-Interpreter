    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with detection in the AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 channels, preparing a comprehensive set of controls is critical for obtaining reliable and pure sorted populations. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls you should prepare, which amounts to a total of 14 control samples.\n\n### I. Foundational Controls\n\nThese controls are fundamental for any flow cytometry experiment.\n\n1.  **Unstained Control (1 sample):** This sample contains only the cells, without any fluorescent labels. It is essential for determining the baseline level of autofluorescence and for setting the initial forward and side scatter (FSC/SSC) parameters to identify your cell population of interest.\n\n2.  **Viability Control (requires 1 compensation tube):** It is crucial to distinguish between live and dead cells. Dead cells can exhibit high autofluorescence and bind non-specifically to antibodies, leading to false-positive results and contamination of your sorted populations. You should incorporate a viability dye into your staining panel, which will require its own single-stain compensation control. This effectively makes your experiment a 6-color panel.\n\n### II. Multicolor Staining Controls\n\nThese controls are necessary to address the complexities of using multiple fluorochromes simultaneously.\n\n3.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (6 samples):** When using multiple fluorophores, their emission spectra can overlap, a phenomenon known as spillover. Compensation is a mathematical correction for this spillover. To perform it correctly, you need to prepare a separate sample stained with only one fluorophore for each one in your panel. Since you have 5 detection channels plus an essential viability dye, you will need **6** single-stain controls:\n    *   A sample for AF350\n    *   A sample for GFP\n    *   A sample for PE\n    *   A sample for AF647\n    *   A sample for AF750\n    *   A sample for your chosen Viability Dye\n\n4.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):** FMO controls are critical for accurate gate setting in a multicolor experiment, especially for identifying dim populations or when marker expression is continuous. An FMO control contains cells stained with all the fluorophores in your panel *except* for one. This allows you to see the spread of fluorescence from other channels into the channel of the missing fluorophore, ensuring your sort gates are set correctly. You will need an FMO control for each of your five main markers.\n\n### III. Reagent-Specific Controls\n\nThese controls are specific to the reagents used in your staining protocol.\n\n5.  **Streptavidin Only Control (1 sample):** Since your experiment involves streptavidin, it is important to check for any non-specific binding of the streptavidin conjugate itself. This sample should contain cells stained only with the fluorescently-labeled streptavidin (without the corresponding biotinylated primary antibody). This helps ensure that the signal you detect is due to the specific primary antibody-antigen interaction.\n\n6.  **Beads Only Control (Optional but Recommended):** If the streptavidin beads are physical particles being used in the sort, it is good practice to run a sample of cells mixed with the unconjugated beads to check for any intrinsic fluorescence of the beads or non-specific cell-bead interactions.\n\n### IV. Biological Controls\n\nThese validate the biological relevance and specificity of your staining.\n\n7.  **Biological Controls (1 sample, minimum):** You should include at least one biological control. This could be a sample of cells known *not* to express the target antigen (negative control) or a sample known to be positive. This control confirms that your antibody staining is specific to the target of interest.\n\nIn summary, for a robust and reliable 5-channel sorting experiment, you should prepare the following number of essential control tubes:\n*   1 Unstained control\n*   6 Compensation controls\n*   5 FMO controls\n*   1 Streptavidin-only control\n*   1 Biological negative control\n\nThis results in a total of 14 essential control tubes to ensure the accuracy and purity of your sort.\n\n<<<14>>>"
