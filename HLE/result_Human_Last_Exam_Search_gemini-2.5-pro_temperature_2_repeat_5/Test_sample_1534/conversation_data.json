    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes. The entire brain is encased on its posterior side by rigid cartilage.\n\nThe dwarf cuttlefish brain is a complex structure with numerous lobes. The palliovisceral lobe is part of the posterior subesophageal mass. This mass also includes the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes, which are situated posteriorly.\n\nA three-dimensional brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish reveals the spatial relationship of these lobes. In a posterior view of the brain, the palliovisceral lobe is centrally located. The posterior chromatophore lobes are positioned superior and lateral to the palliovisceral lobe, while the fin lobes are located inferior and lateral to it. Functionally, the palliovisceral lobe controls escape movements and inking. The posterior chromatophore lobes are involved in controlling the chromatophores (color-changing cells) of the mantle, and the fin lobes control the movement of the fins.\n\nFrom the posterior side of the brain, the large pallial nerves exit, carrying motor fibers that innervate the mantle skin, as well as the muscles of the mantle and fin.\n\n<<<In the dwarf cuttlefish, the brain regions that are situated adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe include the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes. The brain is also posteriorly enclosed by cranial cartilage.>>>"
