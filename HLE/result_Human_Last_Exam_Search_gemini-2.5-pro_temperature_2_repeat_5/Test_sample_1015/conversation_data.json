    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips. While both techniques involve a backward bend of the torso, their approaches to hip alignment create a noticeable difference in the execution and aesthetic of the movement.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining square hips throughout the cambré derrière. The bend is initiated from the upper back, with the spine lengthening upwards before arching backward. This technique requires significant core and back strength to prevent the dancer from sinking into the lower back and to keep the hips stable and aligned. The head is typically turned to the side, following the line of the arm, which helps to support the neck and maintain a clean line.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is known for allowing the hip of the working leg to open, particularly in movements to the back like an arabesque. This creates a more dynamic and extended line. This principle of an open hip would also apply to a cambré derrière, fundamentally altering its shape compared to the Vaganova style. Balanchine's technique often prioritizes speed, a lengthened look, and a different relationship with musicality. The overall aesthetic of a Balanchine cambré derrière is therefore shaped by this less restricted hip placement, which contrasts with the Vaganova focus on a stable, square foundation.\n\nWhile other elements such as arm styling, speed, and the precise degree of the backbend can also vary between the two methods, the fundamental difference in the accepted placement of the hips is a defining characteristic.\n\n<<<B>>>"
