    "The most commonly used name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range of North America is \"fairy bee\". This name is frequently used in recent scientific and popular literature. The term \"miner bee\" is also used for this genus, though often more broadly for ground-nesting bees.\n\nWhile the genus was scientifically described in 1853, the exact year the common name \"fairy bee\" was coined is not well-documented in available sources. Its usage is noted in various publications, but a definitive origin date could not be determined. One anecdotal source suggests the name may have gained popularity recently through social media, but this is unconfirmed.\n\n<<<Fairy bee, not documented>>>"
