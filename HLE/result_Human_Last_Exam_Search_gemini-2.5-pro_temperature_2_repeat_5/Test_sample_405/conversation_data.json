    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least four distinct colors: white (which can also appear colorless or yellowish), red, violet (which can also appear as red-purple), and black (which can also appear grey).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the colors of the most common allotropes of phosphorus:\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This is the most common and reactive allotrope. It is a translucent, waxy solid that can appear white, colorless, or have a yellowish tint. The yellowing is often due to exposure to light, which causes a slow transformation to red phosphorus. It is toxic and can glow a greenish color in the dark when exposed to oxygen.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is more stable and less reactive than white phosphorus. It typically has a deep red, reddish-violet, or iron-grey luster.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus. It has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite, and can also look grey.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a crystalline form. Its color is described as violet or red/purple. It can also appear as brown transparent plates.\n\nWhile other allotropes like diphosphorus (gaseous) and blue phosphorus (a 2D material) exist, their observation in a \"pure\" bulk, colored form at standard conditions is less common. Diphosphorus is described as colorless. Therefore, based on the well-established, observable solid allotropes, we can identify four main colors.\n\n<<<4>>>"
