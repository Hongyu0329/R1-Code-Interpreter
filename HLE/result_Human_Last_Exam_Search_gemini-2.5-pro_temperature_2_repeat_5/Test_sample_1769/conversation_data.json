    "Had the Norse never invaded England and influenced the Anglo-Saxon language, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **\"swester\"** or possibly **\"suster\"**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is a blend of the Old English word *sweostor* and the Old Norse *systir*. The crucial influence from Old Norse was the introduction of the \"i\" vowel sound, which replaced the native Old English vowels. Without this interaction, the word's development would have followed a different path.\n\nOld English had several forms of the word, most commonly *sweostor* and *swuster*. Following the known patterns of English phonological change:\n*   The form ***sweostor***, containing the diphthong \"eo,\" would likely have evolved into \"swester.\" The Old English \"eo\" sound typically smoothed into an \"e\" sound in Middle English, as seen in words like *heorte* becoming *herte* (heart). This is analogous to how the German cognate, *Schwester*, developed from similar roots.\n*   The variant ***swuster*** could have evolved into \"suster,\" similar to how Old English *sunne* became \"sun.\" This form was also present in Middle English. A complete loss of the \"w\" sound is also possible, which would have led to a form like \"soster\" and then likely leveled to \"sester\" in modern pronunciation.\n\nBetween the likely candidates, \"swester\" represents a very direct and regular phonological evolution from the common Old English form *sweostor*.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
