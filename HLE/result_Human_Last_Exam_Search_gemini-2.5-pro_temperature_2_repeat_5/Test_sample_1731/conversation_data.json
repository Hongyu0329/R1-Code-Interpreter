    "Using large deviation theorems to derive the equilibrium properties of a photon gas provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics. The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem allows for the determination of the most probable distribution of particles, which corresponds to the equilibrium state, while the Cramer-Chernoff theorem explains the probability of fluctuations away from this equilibrium.\n\n### Framework for the Bose Case of Light Quanta\n\nA gas of photons (light quanta) is a system of bosons. In the context of black-body radiation, these photons are confined to a cavity of volume V and are in thermal equilibrium with the walls at temperature T. Key characteristics of this system are:\n*   **Indistinguishable Particles**: Photons are bosons and are indistinguishable from one another, obeying Bose-Einstein statistics.\n*   **Non-conserved Particle Number**: Photons can be absorbed and emitted by the walls of the container, meaning their total number is not fixed. This leads to the chemical potential being zero (µ=0) at equilibrium.\n*   **Energy States**: The photons can occupy a set of discrete energy levels εᵢ. The state of the system is defined by the occupation numbers {nᵢ}, which specify how many photons occupy each energy level.\n\n### Derivation via the Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem provides the mathematical justification for Boltzmann's principle, which states that the equilibrium state of a system is the one with the highest number of microscopic realizations (maximum entropy).\n\n1.  **The Most Probable Distribution**: Sanov's theorem states that the probability of an empirical distribution of states deviating from the true underlying distribution is exponentially small, with the rate of decay given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence). The equilibrium state is the most probable configuration of occupation numbers {nᵢ} that corresponds to a given total average energy U. In statistical mechanics, this is found by maximizing the entropy S subject to the constraint of fixed mean energy.\n\n2.  **Entropy of a Bose Gas**: For a set of occupation numbers {nᵢ} for bosons distributed among gᵢ states at energy level εᵢ, the number of microstates (multiplicity) is given by:\n    W = Πᵢ (nᵢ + gᵢ - 1)! / (nᵢ! * (gᵢ - 1)!)\n    Using the Boltzmann entropy formula, S = k ln(W), and applying Stirling's approximation for large nᵢ and gᵢ, the entropy is:\n    S/k ≈ Σᵢ [ (nᵢ + gᵢ)ln(nᵢ + gᵢ) - nᵢln(nᵢ) - gᵢln(gᵢ) ]\n\n3.  **Maximizing Entropy**: To find the equilibrium distribution, we maximize this entropy under the constraint that the total energy is U = Σᵢ nᵢεᵢ. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers with a multiplier β = 1/(kT), we find the distribution that maximizes S. This procedure yields the mean occupation number `<nᵢ>` for energy level εᵢ:\n    <nᵢ> = gᵢ / (e^(βεᵢ) - 1)\n    This is the **Bose-Einstein distribution**. For a continuous spectrum of energies, gᵢ is replaced by the density of states.\n\n4.  **Application to Photons**: A crucial feature of a photon gas is that the number of photons is not conserved, which corresponds to a chemical potential µ=0. The distribution function for photons is therefore a specific case of the Bose-Einstein distribution:\n    <n(ε)> = 1 / (e^(ε/kT) - 1)\n    This is known as the **Planck distribution**.\n\n### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe mean energy U of the photon gas is found by integrating the energy of each state multiplied by the number of photons in that state over all possible energies. To do this, we need the density of states g(ε) for photons in a volume V. For a 3D box, the number of electromagnetic modes (including two polarization states) in an energy interval dε is:\ng(ε)dε = (8πV / (hc)³) * ε² dε\n\nThe total mean energy U is then:\nU = ∫₀^∞ ε * <n(ε)> * g(ε) dε = ∫₀^∞ ε * [1 / (e^(ε/kT) - 1)] * [(8πV / (hc)³) * ε²] dε\n\nTo solve this integral, we substitute x = ε/kT:\nU = (8πV(kT)⁴ / (hc)³) ∫₀^∞ x³ / (eˣ - 1) dx\n\nThe definite integral evaluates to π⁴/15. This yields the equilibrium mean energy:\nU = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15(hc)³) * V * T⁴\n\nThis is the famous **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**, showing that the energy density (U/V) of black-body radiation is proportional to T⁴.\n\n### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe entropy of the photon gas can be calculated using the thermodynamic relation U = F + TS, where F is the Helmholtz free energy. The pressure of the photon gas is P = U / (3V), and the free energy is F = -U/3. Therefore, U = -U/3 + TS, which simplifies to S = (4/3) * (U/T).\n\nSubstituting the expression for the mean energy U:\nS = (4/3T) * (8π⁵k⁴ / 15(hc)³) * V * T⁴\n\nThis gives the equilibrium value for the entropy of a photon gas:\nS = (32π⁵k⁴ / 45(hc)³) * V * T³\n\nThe entropy of the photon gas is proportional to the volume and the cube of the temperature. The entropy per photon is approximately 3.60k, where k is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nIn the context of the **Cramer-Chernoff theorem**, any deviation of the mean energy from this calculated value U is a large deviation event. The theorem states that the probability of observing a mean energy u ≠ U/N (for a fixed number of N conceptual particles) decays exponentially, with the rate function determined by the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the cumulant generating function of the energy distribution. The equilibrium value U derived above is precisely the value for which this large deviation probability is minimized, reaffirming its status as the most probable macroscopic state."
