For a Hecke-Maass cusp form on the modular surface $\Gamma_0(N)\backslash\mathbb{H}$ with $N$ being a squarefree integer, the upper bound for the maximum norm ($\|f\|_\infty$) in relation to the covolume ($V$) is expressed as $\|f\|_\infty \ll V^{1/3+\epsilon}$, assuming the eigenvalue of the form is fixed.
