    "An upper bound for the maximum norm, in the context of Hecke-Maass cusp forms for squarefree natural numbers, can be established in relation to the covolume. The relevant setting is the study of automorphic forms on modular surfaces.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the relationship:\n\n*   **N**: A squarefree natural number, which represents the level of the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$.\n*   **V**: The covolume of the group, which corresponds to the hyperbolic volume of the modular surface $Y_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$. The volume is proportional to the level, with the asymptotic relationship $V \\approx N^{1+o(1)}$.\n*   **$k_{k,\\infty}$**: This notation is interpreted as the maximum norm (or sup-norm), denoted $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, of a Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$ on the modular surface $Y_0(N)$. Such a form is an eigenfunction of the hyperbolic Laplacian with eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\n\nFor a Heckeâ€“Maass cusp form $f$ of eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and square-free level $N$, an established upper bound on its maximum norm is given by:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} N^{1/3+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nThis inequality shows how the maximum norm is bounded in terms of both the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and the level $N$. The user's query focuses on the relationship between the maximum norm and the covolume $V$. Since the covolume $V$ is directly related to the level $N$ by $V \\asymp N$, we can express the bound in terms of $V$.\n\nBy substituting $N \\asymp V$ into the inequality, the upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume $V$ is:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} V^{1/3+\\epsilon}$\n\nThis indicates that for a fixed eigenvalue, the maximum norm grows at most as the cube root of the covolume.\n\n<<<For a Hecke-Maass cusp form on the modular surface $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$ with $N$ being a squarefree integer, the upper bound for the maximum norm ($\\|f\\|_\\infty$) in relation to the covolume ($V$) is expressed as $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll V^{1/3+\\epsilon}$, assuming the eigenvalue of the form is fixed.>>>"
