    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is given in terms of the parameter ϵ = 4 - d, where d is the number of spatial dimensions.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling constant g is given by:\nβ(g) = -ϵg + (3/(16π²))g² + O(g³)\n\nA fixed point g* is found by setting the beta function to zero, β(g*) = 0. For a non-trivial fixed point (g* ≠ 0), we have:\n-ϵg* + (3/(16π²))(g*)² = 0\n\nSolving for g* at the leading order in ϵ, we find:\ng* = (16π²/3)ϵ\n\nIt is common to define a rescaled coupling u = g / (16π²). In terms of this rescaled coupling, the beta function is:\nβ(u) = -ϵu + 3u²\n\nSetting β(u*) = 0 gives the leading order fixed point coupling:\nu* = ϵ/3\n\n<<<u* = (16π²/3)ϵ>>>"
