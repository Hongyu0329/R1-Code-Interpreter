    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ refers to the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of such tori. This number is a fundamental invariant of the group.\n\nThe key result for determining this number is that the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational conjugacy classes of maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the so-called $F$-conjugacy classes of its Weyl group $W$. An $F$-conjugacy class is a class of the form $\\{w' \\cdot w \\cdot F(w')^{-1} \\mid w' \\in W\\}$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure.\n\nA critical simplification occurs in the case of $E_8$:\n1.  **Any group of type $E_8$ over a field is split.** This is a consequence of the fact that the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms. The outer automorphism group of $E_8$ is trivial, which implies that any action of the Galois group Gal($\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q$/$\\mathbb{F}_q$) on the Dynkin diagram must be trivial. Therefore, the group cannot be \"twisted\" and is always of the split form.\n\n2.  **For a split group, F-conjugacy classes are ordinary conjugacy classes.** In the split case, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. The definition of an $F$-conjugacy class then simplifies to $\\{w' \\cdot w \\cdot w'^{-1} \\mid w' \\in W\\}$, which is the standard definition of a conjugacy class in $W$.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a large finite group of order 696,729,600. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed and is a well-established result in group theory.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$ is 112.\n\nSince any group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is split, and for a split group the number of rational maximal tori (up to conjugacy) equals the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group, the number is 112, regardless of the choice of $q$.\n\n<<<112>>>"
