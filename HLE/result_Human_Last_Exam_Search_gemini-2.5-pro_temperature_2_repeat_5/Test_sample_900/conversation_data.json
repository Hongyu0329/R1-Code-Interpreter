    "Due to the unavailability of the video footage of Svetlana Gileva's performance in the Jete Woman solo from the Forsythe production \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for Semperoper Ballett in 2015, it is not possible to provide a definitive count of the number of pas de Balanchines performed.\n\nWhile archival information confirms that Svetlana Gileva performed this role with the Semperoper Ballett, and that a video of the \"Jete Woman solo\" dated November 9, 2015, was officially released, the video is no longer accessible online. Reviews and company information from that period acknowledge her performance but do not offer a detailed choreographic analysis that would allow for counting a specific step. Without visual access to the performance, any attempt to quantify the number of \"pas de Balanchines\" would be speculative.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to your question as the specific video of the performance required for analysis is not publicly available.>>>"
