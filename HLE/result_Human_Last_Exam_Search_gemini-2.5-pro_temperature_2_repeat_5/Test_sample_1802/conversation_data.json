    "To determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a qudit density matrix, we must first understand the structure of both the Pauli channel and its complementary channel.\n\n### Pauli Channel for a Qudit\n\nA qudit is a $d$-dimensional quantum system. A Pauli channel, $\\Lambda$, acting on a $d$-dimensional density matrix $\\rho$ is a quantum channel that can be expressed as a convex combination of unitary operations involving generalized Pauli operators. For a $d$-dimensional system, there are $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (also known as discrete Weyl operators), which we can denote as $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$. These operators form an orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n\nThe action of a Pauli channel is given by:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\nwhere the coefficients $p_k$ are probabilities, satisfying $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_k p_k = 1$.\n\n### The Complementary Channel and its Rank\n\nEvery quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be described by a Stinespring dilation. This involves representing the channel as a unitary evolution on a larger system, comprising the original system and an ancillary \"environment\" system, followed by tracing out the environment. The complementary channel, denoted $\\Lambda^c$, results from the same unitary evolution but instead tracing out the original system.\n\nThe \"rank of a channel\" typically refers to the rank of its Choi matrix, which is known as the Choi rank. The Choi rank determines the minimum number of Kraus operators needed to represent the channel. The dimension of the environment in the Stinespring dilation is equal to the Choi rank of the original channel.\n\n1.  **Choi Rank of the Pauli Channel:** The Kraus operators for the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ can be written as $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. Since the generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$ form a basis, they are linearly independent. The rank of the Choi matrix of $\\Lambda$ is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$. To maximize this rank, we can choose a Pauli channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero (for example, the qudit depolarizing channel for certain noise parameters). In this case, the Choi rank of $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n2.  **Dimension of the Complementary Channel's Output:** The output of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ lives in the environment space. The dimension of this environment is determined by the Choi rank of the original channel $\\Lambda$. To maximize the rank of the complementary channel, we should first maximize the Choi rank of $\\Lambda$. As established, the maximal Choi rank of $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n3.  **Maximal Rank:** When the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is chosen such that its Choi rank is $d^2$, the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ maps density matrices of the $d$-dimensional system to density matrices on a $d^2$-dimensional environment. The maximal possible rank for an output density matrix is the dimension of the space it lives in. Therefore, the maximal rank of an output state of the complementary channel is $d^2$. This also corresponds to the Choi rank of the complementary channel itself.\n\n<<<dÂ²>>>"
