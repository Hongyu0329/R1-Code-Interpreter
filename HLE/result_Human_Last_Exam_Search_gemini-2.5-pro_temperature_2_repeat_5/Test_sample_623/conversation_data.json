    "When a molecule of glucose labeled with ¹³C at positions 1 and 4 undergoes glycolysis and subsequent cellular respiration, the fate of these labeled carbons determines the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules produced.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n\n1.  **Glycolysis:** The six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The carbons C1, C2, and C3 of glucose form one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The carbons C4, C5, and C6 form the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n2.  **Fate of the ¹³C Labels in Pyruvate:**\n    *   The ¹³C label at position 1 of glucose (C1) becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of the first pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C label at position 4 of glucose (C4) becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n3.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (The Link Reaction):** Before entering the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA. This process involves the removal of the carboxyl group (C1) of pyruvate as a molecule of CO₂.\n    *   The first pyruvate molecule is labeled at its methyl carbon (C3). It loses its unlabeled carboxyl carbon (C1) as CO₂. The resulting acetyl-CoA molecule is ¹³C-labeled.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule is labeled at its carboxyl carbon (C1). This labeled carbon is removed and released as **one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂**. The resulting acetyl-CoA is not labeled.\n\n4.  **The Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):** For each molecule of glucose, two molecules of acetyl-CoA enter the Krebs cycle. In this cycle, the remaining carbons are oxidized to CO₂.\n    *   The unlabeled acetyl-CoA produces two unlabeled CO₂ molecules.\n    *   The ¹³C-labeled acetyl-CoA (which originated from C1 of glucose) enters the cycle. Although the carbons from acetyl-CoA are not released in the first turn of the cycle, the complete oxidation of glucose during cellular respiration means that all of its carbon atoms are eventually released as CO₂. Therefore, the ¹³C atom from the C1 position of glucose will also be released as a **second molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂** in subsequent turns of the Krebs cycle.\n\nConclusion: The complete oxidation of a single molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose results in the release of two ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules. One is released during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, and the second is released during the Krebs cycle.\n\n<<<2>>>"
