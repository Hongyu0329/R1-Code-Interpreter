    "I'm sorry, I cannot give a good answer to this question, as my knowledge is limited to that of a language model. The provided search results discuss asymptotic bounds (how the maximum size of a cap set grows with the dimension `n`), often expressed as c^n, but do not provide an exact value for the best-known lower bound for the specific dimension of 8.\n\nThe OEIS sequence A090245, mentioned in the Wikipedia article, might contain the answer, but the search result doesn't show the entry for n=8. I can tell you that the sequence starts 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, 112, corresponding to dimensions 1 through 7, but I don't know the value for dimension 8.\nAs the question asks for a specific value and the search results provide only asymptotic information and values for other dimensions, I cannot definitively answer the question with the given search results.\n\n<<<I cannot answer this question.>>>"
