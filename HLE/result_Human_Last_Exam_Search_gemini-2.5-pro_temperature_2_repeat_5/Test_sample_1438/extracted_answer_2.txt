The "value" of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is not a numerical constant but is defined by the rules of Berezin integration. The key property, arising from the anti-commuting nature of Grassmann variables, is that the integral of a function is non-zero only for the term that is linear in each Grassmann variable. This ensures that any term corresponding to two fermions in the same state, which would be represented by the square of a Grassmann variable, integrates to zero, thereby enforcing the Pauli exclusion principle.
