    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** and economist **Amartya Sen**.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, was identified in multiple sources as having appeared in one of the commercials. A YouTube video titled \"Enron Commercial\" explicitly features him. In another video, Gell-Mann himself discusses being asked by a company to appear in a television commercial where he was just supposed to discuss the importance of questioning things, which aligns with Enron's \"Ask Why\" campaign.\n\nThe second Nobel laureate was Amartya Sen, an Indian economist and philosopher who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics and social choice theory. While direct video evidence of his commercial is less accessible, multiple contemporaneous accounts and discussions refer to an \"Indian commentator\" being featured in the campaign, a description that fits Sen, a prominent public intellectual at the time.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign ironically preceded the company's massive corporate fraud scandal and collapse in 2001. The slogan and the commercials featuring these esteemed intellectuals were intended to portray Enron as an innovative and forward-thinking company that challenged conventional wisdom.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
