    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat), Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures. In fact, a notable characteristic of this paper, as well as his other works from his \"miraculous year,\" is the absence of references to the contemporary scientific literature on the subject.\n\nWhile Einstein's work on Brownian motion was a continuation of the research he conducted for his doctoral thesis, which was submitted just weeks before the Brownian motion paper, the paper itself does not contain citations to lectures or any other publications.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
