    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain a number of fluorine atoms equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar molecule. The term \"perfluoro\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms on the carbon framework have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Since \"nanocar\" describes a class of molecular machines rather than a single specific molecule, the exact number of fluorine atoms depends on the chemical structure of the particular nanocar in question.\n\nSeveral different nanocars have been synthesized, each with a unique molecular formula:\n\n*   One of the earliest nanocars has the chemical formula C430H274O12. If this molecule were to be perfluorinated, it would contain **274 fluorine atoms**.\n*   A different nanocar, designed for the Nanocar Race, has the formula C85H59N5Zn. A perfluorinated version of this molecule would contain **59 fluorine atoms**.\n\nTherefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar is not a single value but is determined by the specific molecular structure of the nanocar being considered.\n\n<<<274>>>"
