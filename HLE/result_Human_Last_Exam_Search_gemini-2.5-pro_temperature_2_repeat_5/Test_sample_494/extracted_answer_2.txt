Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would exhibit tunneling. The tunneling phenomenon in ammonia is due to the nitrogen atom passing through the potential energy barrier created by the plane of the three hydrogen atoms. This potential barrier arises from electrostatic interactions and is independent of the nuclear spin of the hydrogen atoms. While the nuclear spin determines the symmetry requirements for the total molecular wavefunction (antisymmetric for fermions like normal protons, symmetric for bosons like the proposed spin-zero protons), and thus influences which rotational states are allowed, it does not eliminate the potential barrier itself. As long as the double-well potential exists, tunneling is possible for the allowed energy states.
