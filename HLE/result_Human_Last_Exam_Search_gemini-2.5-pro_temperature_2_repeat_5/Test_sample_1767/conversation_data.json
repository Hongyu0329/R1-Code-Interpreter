    "When two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the junction itself is not a well-defined concept in the same way as the Chern number of the bulk materials. Instead, the physically meaningful quantity is the number of conducting chiral edge states that form at the interface between the two insulators.\n\nThe number of these interface states is determined by the difference between the Chern numbers of the two connecting materials. In this case, both Chern insulators have a Chern number (C) of 1.\n\nTherefore, the difference in the Chern numbers is:\nΔC = C₁ - C₂ = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nThis means there are zero net chiral edge states at the junction. The number of topological gapless states along the interface is determined by the difference in the Chern numbers of the two domains. Since the Chern numbers are equal, there are no topologically protected conducting states at the interface.\n\nEach Chern insulator with C=1 has one chiral edge state on its outer boundaries. When the two are joined, these edge states continue along the outer edges of the combined system. The interface, however, does not host any additional chiral modes because there is no change in the topological invariant across the junction.\n\n<<<0>>>"
