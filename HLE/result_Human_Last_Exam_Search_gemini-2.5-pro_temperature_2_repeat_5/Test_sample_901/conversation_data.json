    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide, a strong and sterically bulky base, proceeds via an E2 elimination mechanism. The product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this product is formed:\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, and the reagent is potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, bulky base, which strongly favors the E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction pathway.\n\n2.  **Stereochemical Requirement for E2**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (in this case, the bromine atom) and the hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an *anti-periplanar* arrangement. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to a *trans-diaxial* orientation, meaning both the leaving group and the hydrogen must be in axial positions, pointing in opposite directions.\n\n3.  **Conformation of the Starting Material**: The stereoisomer (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane has the bromine and methyl groups *cis* to each other. For the E2 reaction to occur, the bromine atom must be in an axial position. In a chair conformation, if the bromine is axial (e.g., pointing up), the cis-oriented methyl group at the adjacent carbon must be equatorial (also pointing up). This conformation, with the bulkier methyl group in the more stable equatorial position, is the preferred arrangement for the molecule to be in for the reaction to proceed.\n\n4.  **Identifying Possible Elimination Pathways**: With the bromine atom in an axial position, we look for axial β-hydrogens on the two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2**: There is an axial hydrogen that is trans-diaxial to the bromine. Eliminating this hydrogen would lead to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted alkene, known as the Zaitsev product.\n    *   **At C6**: There is also an axial hydrogen that is trans-diaxial to the bromine. Eliminating this hydrogen would result in a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n\n5.  **Hofmann's Rule with a Bulky Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide is a sterically hindered (bulky) base. Due to its size, it has difficulty accessing the more sterically hindered β-hydrogen at C2, which is located near the equatorial methyl group. Instead, the bulky base preferentially abstracts the more sterically accessible β-hydrogen at C6. This preference for the less hindered hydrogen leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene as the major product. This is known as the Hofmann rule.\n\nTherefore, the reaction favors the abstraction of a proton from C6, leading to the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene as the major product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
