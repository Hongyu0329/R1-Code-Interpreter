    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are predatory insects that primarily feed on soft-bodied arthropods like aphids. In addition to their predatory diet, they have also been recorded consuming pollen and nectar.\n\nNotably, snakeflies are native to the Northern Hemisphere and are not found in New Zealand, except for a failed introduction in the early 20th century for pest control. This geographical distribution makes it impossible for them to naturally feed on endemic New Zealand species such as Māhoe pollen, Karamū leaf tissue, or Totara aphids.\n\nBased on recorded dietary habits:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Snakefly adults have been observed feeding on nectar.\n*   **E. Aphids:** Adult snakeflies are well-documented predators of aphids.\n\nTherefore, the diet of adult snakeflies includes both nectar and aphids.\n\n<<<F>>>"
