    "### Connectivity of the Map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$\n\nTo determine the connectivity of the map $\\Phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will analyze the connectivity of the source and target spaces and then consider the effect of the map on their lowest-dimensional non-trivial homotopy groups.\n\nA map $f: X \\to Y$ is defined as being **k-connected** if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i = k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of the map being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\n#### 1. Connectivity of the Source Space\n\nThe source space is $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. We determine its connectivity step-by-step:\n*   The sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected. Thus, $S^4$ is 3-connected and $S^6$ is 5-connected.\n*   The loop space functor $\\Omega$ reduces connectivity by 1. Therefore, $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected, and $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected.\n*   For two connected CW-complexes $X$ and $Y$ that are $n$-connected and $m$-connected respectively, their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(n+m+1)$-connected.\n    *   For $X = \\Omega S^4$ ($n=2$) and $Y = \\Omega S^6$ ($m=4$), the smash product $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n*   The suspension functor $\\Sigma$ increases connectivity by 1. Thus, the source space $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is **8-connected**. This means $\\pi_i(A) = 0$ for all $i \\leq 8$.\n\n#### 2. Connectivity of the Target Space\n\nThe target space is $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n*   The smash product of spheres $S^m \\wedge S^n$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{m+n}$. Thus, $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$.\n*   The target space is therefore $B \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   The sphere $S^{10}$ is 9-connected.\n*   As the loop space functor reduces connectivity by 1, the target space $B = \\Omega S^{10}$ is **8-connected**. This means $\\pi_i(B) = 0$ for all $i \\leq 8$.\n\n#### 3. The Map on the First Non-Trivial Homotopy Group\n\nSince both the source and target spaces are 8-connected, the map $\\Phi$ is trivially an isomorphism on $\\pi_i$ for $i < 9$ (as it is a map between trivial groups). The connectivity of $\\Phi$ is therefore at least 8. To determine if it is higher, we must examine the induced map on $\\pi_9$:\n$\\Phi_*: \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\to \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10})$.\n\n*   **For the source space:** The Freudenthal Suspension Theorem implies $\\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. By the Hurewicz theorem and the KÃ¼nneth formula for smash products in the lowest dimension, this group is isomorphic to $H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong H_4(S^4) \\otimes H_6(S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **For the target space:** The homotopy group is $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe specific map in question, in the context of homotopy theory (often related to James-Hopf invariants or Whitehead products), is known to induce an isomorphism on this first non-trivial homotopy group. This means $\\Phi_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is an isomorphism.\n\nFrom the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration $F \\to A \\to B$, where $F$ is the homotopy fiber of $\\Phi$:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_9(F) \\to \\pi_9(A) \\xrightarrow{\\Phi_*} \\pi_9(B) \\to \\pi_8(F) \\to \\pi_8(A) \\to \\dots $$\nSince $\\pi_8(A) = 0$ and $\\Phi_*$ on $\\pi_9$ is an isomorphism, the exactness of the sequence implies that $\\pi_8(F)=0$.\nThis establishes that the homotopy fiber $F$ is at least 8-connected.\n\nTherefore, by definition, the map $\\Phi$ is $(8+1) = 9$-connected. To check if it is 10-connected, we would look at $\\pi_9(F)$. From the same long exact sequence, $\\pi_9(F) \\cong \\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. Since $\\pi_9(F)$ is not trivial, the fiber is not 9-connected, and the map is not 10-connected.\n\nThe connectivity of the map is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
