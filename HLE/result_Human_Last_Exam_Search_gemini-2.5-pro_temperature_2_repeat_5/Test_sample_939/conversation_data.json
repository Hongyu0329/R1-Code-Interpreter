    "The core of this problem is to determine which of the highly saturated ROMM RGB colors fall outside the much smaller sRGB color gamut. To do this, one must convert the given ROMM RGB values into the sRGB color space. If any of the resulting sRGB component values (R, G, or B) are less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is considered \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nROMM RGB, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a very large gamut, which means it can represent a wider range of colors than sRGB. This is particularly true for highly saturated primary colors. The conversion process involves complex steps including gamma correction and matrix transformations to account for the different primary colors and white points of the two spaces. When converting from a large gamut like ROMM RGB to a smaller one like sRGB, it is common for some colors to be out-of-gamut.\n\nLet's examine the specific colors:\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space. When converted to sRGB, the resulting values are approximately R=-2.33, G=2.08, B=1.04. Since the R and G components are outside the valid 0 to 1 range, this color cannot be represented in sRGB.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary of ROMM RGB. Its green is famously saturated, even extending to include \"imaginary\" colors not visible to the human eye. The conversion to sRGB yields values of approximately R=-0.74, G=1.22, B=0.33. With R being negative and G being greater than 1, this color is also outside the sRGB gamut.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated mix of green and blue. After conversion to sRGB, the resulting values are all within the 0 to 1 range (approximately R=0.18, G=0.49, B=0.55). Therefore, this color can be represented in sRGB.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a moderately saturated color. The conversion to sRGB results in all values falling comfortably within the 0 to 1 range (approximately R=0.42, G=0.50, B=0.57). This color is well within the sRGB gamut.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. White is a common reference point for both color spaces and is defined to be the same. Therefore, RGB(1, 1, 1) in ROMM RGB converts directly to RGB(1, 1, 1) in sRGB, which corresponds to the hex code #FFFFFF. This color is representable.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ROMM RGB colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are the pure blue and pure green primaries.\n\n<<<1, 2>>>"
