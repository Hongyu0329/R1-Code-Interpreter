    "A 10-node barbell graph consists of two complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge, referred to as the bottleneck edge or bridge. With a total of 10 nodes, the most common and standard structure is to have two cliques of 5 nodes each (K5).\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping implies that each edge in the graph has an equal probability of being selected. This process is akin to sampling an edge uniformly at random from the set of all edges in the graph.\n\nTo determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge, we first need to calculate the total number of edges in the graph. The number of edges in a complete graph with 'n' nodes is given by the formula n * (n-1) / 2.\n\nFor each of the two K5 cliques:\n*   Number of edges = 5 * (5-1) / 2 = 10 edges.\n\nThe total number of edges in the barbell graph is the sum of the edges in both cliques plus the single bottleneck edge connecting them.\n\n*   Total edges = (Edges in first K5) + (Edges in second K5) + (Bottleneck edge)\n*   Total edges = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21 edges.\n\nThere is only one bottleneck edge in this graph structure. Therefore, the probability of sampling this specific edge in a uniform gossiping process is the ratio of the number of bottleneck edges to the total number of edges.\n\n*   Probability = (Number of bottleneck edges) / (Total number of edges)\n*   Probability = 1 / 21\n\nThis results in a probability of approximately 0.0476.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
