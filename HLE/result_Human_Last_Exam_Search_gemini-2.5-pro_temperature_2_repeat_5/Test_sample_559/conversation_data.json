    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. The separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that divides regions of different long-term behavior. Such curves are typically the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe restrict our attention to the upper half-plane, $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find the u-nullclines are the lines $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d=0$. So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, so $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, which gives $2d(d+1)=0$. This yields two equilibrium points: $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\nTo determine the stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At $(0, 1)$:**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, $(0, 1)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   **At $(-1, 1)$:**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n*   **At $(0, 0)$:**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The linearization is inconclusive. A direct analysis shows that for $u>0$ and near zero, $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) < 0$, so trajectories move towards the line $u=0$. On the line $u=0$, the system simplifies to $d'(t) = 2d^2$, so trajectories move to the right (increasing d). This makes the origin a degenerate equilibrium point.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(-1, 1)$. The unstable manifold of the saddle point is a curve that separates the phase plane into regions of qualitatively different behavior. We seek to find the equation of this manifold.\n\nWe can express the relationship between $d$ and $u$ along a trajectory by the equation:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4-u^3}{u^2(u-1)}$\nThis is a Riccati differential equation for $d$ as a function of $u$. Generally, these are hard to solve unless a particular solution is known. Let's test if a simple polynomial relationship of the form $d(u) = -u^2$ is a solution.\n\nIf we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the trajectory equation:\nThe left side is $\\frac{d(d)}{du} = -2u$.\nThe right side becomes:\n$\\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) + u^4-u^3}{u^3-u^2} = \\frac{2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3}{u^3-u^2} = \\frac{-2u^4+2u^3}{u^3-u^2}$\nFactoring the numerator and denominator gives:\n$\\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u$\n\nSince both sides are equal, $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution curve for a trajectory. Let's verify if this trajectory corresponds to the separatrix. A separatrix often connects equilibrium points.\n*   For $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. This corresponds to the saddle point $(-1, 1)$.\n*   For $u=0$, $d = -(0)^2 = 0$. This corresponds to the degenerate node $(0, 0)$.\n\nThe curve $d = -u^2$ is a trajectory that connects the saddle point $(-1, 1)$ to the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$. This curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point for $u \\in$. It divides the phase plane for $0<u<1$ into two regions:\n1.  Trajectories starting \"above\" the curve (where $d > -u^2$) will approach the line $u=0$ at a point where $d>0$ and will then escape towards $d \\to \\infty$.\n2.  Trajectories starting \"below\" the curve (where $d < -u^2$) will approach the line $u=0$ at a point where $d<0$ and will then be attracted towards the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$.\n\nThus, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the separatrix that determines the boundary of the basin of attraction for the origin.\n\n<<<The separatrix is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
