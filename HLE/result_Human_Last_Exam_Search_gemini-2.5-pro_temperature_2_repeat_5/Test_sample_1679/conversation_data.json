    "The first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to feature a depiction of the Luxor Obelisk was the 1951 musical *An American in Paris*.\n\nThe film, which was primarily shot on meticulously crafted sets at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios in Hollywood, includes an elaborate 17-minute ballet sequence that serves as its climax. This celebrated dance number, set to George Gershwin's \"An American in Paris,\" takes the audience on a dreamlike journey through the French capital.\n\nOne of the Parisian landmarks recreated for this sequence is the Place de la Concorde, the public square where the Luxor Obelisk stands. The set was designed in the artistic style of French painter Raoul Dufy. In a scene from the ballet, Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron dance around a fountain modeled after those in the actual Place de la Concorde.\n\nVisual evidence from the film, including production stills, confirms that a representation of the Luxor Obelisk is visible in the background during this sequence, firmly establishing *An American in Paris* as the first Best Picture Oscar winner to depict the ancient monument on-screen. Though not filmed on location, the artistic interpretation of the Place de la Concorde within the movie's fantasy ballet prominently features the obelisk as a key element of the Parisian landscape.\n\nEarlier Best Picture winners, including those set in Paris like *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), were filmed on studio sets that recreated other parts of the city, but there is no evidence to suggest they featured the Place de la Concorde or the Luxor Obelisk. *An American in Paris* stands as the first to visually incorporate this iconic landmark into its narrative.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
