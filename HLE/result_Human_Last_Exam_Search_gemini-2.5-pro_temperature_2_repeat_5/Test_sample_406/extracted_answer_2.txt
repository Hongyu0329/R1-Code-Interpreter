The conditions for the functions F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, and H:Z*Y*X→Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are:
1.  The spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) are complete partially ordered metric spaces.
2.  The mappings F, G, and H satisfy a mixed monotone property.
3.  The mappings F, G, and H satisfy a contractive condition, which limits the distance between the images of points.
4.  There exists an initial point (x_0, y_0, z_0) that satisfies certain inequalities with respect to the functions F, G, and H and the partial orderings.
5.  Either the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the partially ordered metric spaces satisfy a regularity condition regarding the convergence of monotone sequences.
