    "Yes, it does follow that $f=0$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning presented in the form of a Python script. This script explains the mathematical proof.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will start with the definition of the Fourier transform of the function $f(x)$. Let's denote it by $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$.\n2.  I will then show how the condition that all moments of $f(x)$ are zero translates into a condition on the derivatives of its Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, at the point $\\xi=0$.\n3.  A crucial property of Schwartz functions is that their Fourier transforms are not just smooth, but analytic. An analytic function is one that is equal to its Taylor series in a neighborhood of every point.\n4.  I will use the fact that if an analytic function and all its derivatives are zero at a single point, the function must be identically zero everywhere.\n5.  This implies that $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must be the zero function.\n6.  Finally, since the Fourier transform is an invertible operation, if $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$, then the original function $f(x)$ must also be zero.\n\n```python\ndef solve_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains why a Schwartz function f(x) with all moments equal\n    to zero must be the zero function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The Fourier Transform and its Derivatives\")\n    print(\"Let f(x) be a Schwartz class function.
