# Step 1: Display financial facts
print("Financial Summary:")
print(f"Total Purchase Price: ${int(purchase_price)}")
print(f"Agreed Payment Amount: ${int(payment_amount)}")
print(f"Number of payments made by Jack: {payments_made_count}")

# Step 2: Show the calculation for the amount paid
# Build the equation string as requested
equation_parts = [str(int(payment_amount))] * payments_made_count
equation_string = " + ".join(equation_parts)
print(f"Calculation of total paid: {equation_string} = ${int(total_paid)}")
print(f"Remaining Balance: ${int(remaining_balance)}")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 3: Outline the critical contract terms for default
print("Contract's Default Procedure:")
print("1. A missed payment triggers a default.")
print("2. Gary must give Jack 'written notice of default'.")
print("3. Jack has a three-day grace period to pay after receiving the notice.")
print("4. Only after the three-day period lapses can Gary retake the vehicle.")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 4: Evaluate the events against the contract terms
print("Timeline and Analysis:")
print("Event: Jack missed the February 1, 2023 payment. This constitutes a default.")
print("Event: Gary sent a text on February 2, 2023, 'letting him know that he missed a payment.'")
print("\nConclusion:")
print("The core issue is whether a text message saying a payment was 'missed' qualifies as a formal 'written notice of default' as required by the contract.")
print("A formal notice of default typically needs to be unambiguous, clearly state that the contract is in default, and inform the recipient of their right to cure the default. Gary's text message is arguably too informal and ambiguous to meet this legal standard.")
print("Because a proper 'written notice of default' was likely not issued, the three-day cure period was never officially triggered.")
print("Therefore, Gary's attempt to retake the vehicle on February 6 was premature and not in accordance with the contract's specified procedure.")
print("\nThis aligns with answer choice C.")
