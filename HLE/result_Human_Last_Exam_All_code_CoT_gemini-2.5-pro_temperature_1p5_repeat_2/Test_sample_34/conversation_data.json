    "This is a poker theory question that can be answered using established Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles. Here is the step-by-step thinking to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The question specifies a very particular poker situation:\n    *   **Game:** 100 big blind No-Limit Hold'em cash game. This is the standard for cash game strategy.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the last position to act post-flop, making it the most powerful. Because of this positional advantage, you can profitably play a very wide range of hands.\n    *   **Action:** An open-raise to 2.5x the big blind. This is a standard opening size.\n    *   **Rake:** The game is rake-free. This removes the \"cost\" of winning a pot, which further incentivizes playing more hands and widens your profitable opening range compared to a raked game.\n\n2.  **Determine the Opening Range:** Based on GTO solver outputs for this scenario, a player on the button should be opening a very wide range of hands, typically around 45-50% of all possible starting hands. This is because the combination of positional advantage and being the first to raise (initiative) makes many otherwise marginal hands profitable.\n\n3.  **Identify All Suited Jack Hands:** The question asks for the \"worst suited jack\" (JXs) to open. Let's list them in descending order of strength:\n    *   AJs, KJs, QJs, JTs (Premium hands with high cards and great straight/flush potential)\n    *   J9s, J8s, J7s (Good suited connectors/one-gappers)\n    *   J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s (Weak suited gappers with lower kickers)\n\n4.  **Find the \"Worst\" Hand in the Opening Range:** The \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest expected value (EV) that is still considered a profitable raise. Any hand weaker than this should be folded. When we consult a standard 100BB Button GTO opening chart, we find that the range is so wide that it includes **all** of the suited Jack hands, from AJs all the way down to J2s.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since all suited Jacks are considered profitable opens from the button in this scenario, the worst one you *should* open is the one that is objectively the weakest of the group. J2s is the weakest because:\n    *   It has the lowest possible kicker (a 2).\n    *   It has the largest gap in rank, giving it the worst connectivity and the lowest chance of making a straight compared to other JXs hands.\n\nTherefore, J2s is the correct answer. It is the bottom-of-the-barrel suited Jack, but its potential to make a flush, combined with the power of playing from the button, makes it a standard, profitable open-raise.\n\nThe following Python script will print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poker_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines and prints the worst suited Jack a player should\n    open-raise from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In poker, a hand is often abbreviated. 'J' stands for Jack. A number\n    # represents the other card's rank.

We must identify the weakest suited Jack.\n\n    # J2s is the weakest because it has the lowest kicker (the 2) and the\n    # worst connectivity for making straights.\n    \n    # We will represent the hand by its components:\n    # High card: 'J'\n    # Low card (number): 2\n    # Suit status: 's' for suited\n\n    high_card = \"J\"\n    low_card_number = 2\n    suit_status = \"s\"\n\n    # Combine the parts to form the standard hand abbreviation.\n    worst_suited_jack_hand = f\"{high_card}{low_card_number}{suit_status}\"\n\n    print(\"In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the GTO opening range from the button is very wide.\")\n    print(\"This range includes all suited Jack hands because of their flush potential and positional advantage.\")\n    print(\"The worst of these hands, and therefore the marginal open, is the one with the lowest kicker and weakest connectivity.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The worst suited Jack you should open from the button is:\")\n    print(worst_suited_jack_hand)\n\nsolve_poker_question()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
