    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Noble Gases**: The noble gases are a group of chemical elements in the periodic table. They are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n2.  **Gather Abundance Data**: I will look up the typical abundance of each of these gases in Earth's composition. For this task, atmospheric abundance is the most common and relevant measure, as the atmosphere is the primary reservoir for these elements. The data from 2002 is not significantly different from today's accepted values for this purpose.\n3.  **Account for Special Cases**: Radon (Rn) is radioactive with a very short half-life (its most stable isotope lasts about 3.8 days). This means it does not accumulate and exists only in extremely small, transient amounts as a product of the radioactive decay of radium. This makes it inherently rarer than the stable noble gases.\n4.  **Create a Script for Comparison**: I will write a Python script that stores these abundance values in a dictionary. The script will then programmatically identify the gas with the minimum abundance value.\n5.  **Output the Result**: The script will print the name of the rarest gas and its approximate abundance as a percentage.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the rarest noble gas on Earth based on its\n    abundance in the atmosphere, which serves as a proxy for its overall rarity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data representing the abundance of noble gases in Earth's atmosphere as a percentage.\n    # The values from 2002 are not materially different from these standard figures.\n    noble_gas_abundance_percent = {\n        'Argon': 0.934,\n        'Neon': 0.001818,\n        'Helium': 0.000524,\n        'Krypton': 0.000114,\n        'Xenon': 0.0000087,\n        # Radon is radioactive and decays quickly, so it exists only in trace amounts.\n        # Its average concentration is orders of magnitude smaller than Xenon's.\n        # A value of 1e-19 percent is a representative, extremely small figure.\n        'Radon': 1e-19\n    }\n\n    # Find the gas with the minimum abundance\n    # The min() function's key argument is used to specify a function to be called on each\n    # list element prior to making comparisons. Here, it gets the value from the dictionary.\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundance_percent, key=noble_gas_abundance_percent.get)\n\n    # Retrieve the abundance value for the rarest gas\n    rarest_gas_percentage = noble_gas_abundance_percent[rarest_gas_name]\n\n    # Print the final result, showing the \"equation\" of which gas and percentage is the answer.\n    # The f-string formats the very small number into scientific notation for readability.\n    print(f\"To find the rarest noble gas, we compare their abundances:\")\n    for gas, percent in noble_gas_abundance_percent.items():\n        print(f\"- {gas}: {percent}%\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAfter comparison, the conclusion is:\")\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas = {rarest_gas_name}\")\n    print(f\"Its percentage = {rarest_gas_percentage:.1e}%\")\n\n\nfind_rarest_noble_gas()\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"
