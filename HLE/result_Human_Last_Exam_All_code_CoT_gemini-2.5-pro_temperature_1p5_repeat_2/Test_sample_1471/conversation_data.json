    "To solve the equation `X / C - CMXCIX`, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Translate the Roman numerals to modern numbers:**\n    *   `X` is 10.\n    *   `C` is 100.\n    *   `CMXCIX` is 999 (since `CM` is 900, `XC` is 90, and `IX` is 9).\n2.  **Rewrite the equation with these numbers:**\n    *   10 / 100 - 999\n3.  **Calculate the result following the order of operations (division first, then subtraction):**\n    *   First, divide 10 by 100 to get 0.1.\n    *   Then, subtract 999 from 0.1 to get -998.9.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\n# The equation is X / C - CMXCIX = ?\n# First, let's define the values of the Roman numerals in modern numbers.\nx = 10\nc = 100\ncmxcix = 999\n\n# Now, let's perform the calculation following the order of operations (division then subtraction).\nresult = (x / c) - cmxcix\n\n# Finally, let's print the full equation with the solution.\nprint(f\"The equation {x} / {c} - {cmxcix} results in:\")\nprint(result)\n```\n<<<-998.9>>>"
