    "Of course. Here is the formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation.\n\nMy plan is to provide the general formula using the path integral formalism. This involves a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields. The core of the formula is the exponential of the Euclidean action for the fermionic system. I will write a Python script that prints this complete formula along with a clear definition of each term and the required boundary conditions for the fields.\n\n```python\ndef print_fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the\n    imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    formula_string = \"\"\"\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation is given by a functional integral over Grassmann fields:\n\nZ = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ exp(-S[ψ̄, ψ])\n\nWhere:\n\n  - Z: The grand canonical partition function.\n\n  - ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ: The functional integral (Feynman path integral) over all possible configurations of the fermionic Grassmann fields ψ̄ and ψ.\n\n  - exp(...): The exponential function.\n\n  - S[ψ̄, ψ]: The Euclidean action for the fermions in imaginary time.
