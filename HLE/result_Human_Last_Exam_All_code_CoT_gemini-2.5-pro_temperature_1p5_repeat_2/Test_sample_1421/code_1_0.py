The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation is given by a functional integral over Grassmann fields:

Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ exp(-S[ψ̄, ψ])

Where:

  - Z: The grand canonical partition function.

  - ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ: The functional integral (Feynman path integral) over all possible configurations of the fermionic Grassmann fields ψ̄ and ψ.

  - exp(...): The exponential function.

  - S[ψ̄, ψ]: The Euclidean action for the fermions in imaginary time. It is defined as:

    S[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x  ψ̄(x, τ) [ ∂_τ + H_0 - μ ] ψ(x, τ)

    Let's break down the action 'S':

    - ∫_0^β dτ: Integration over imaginary time 'τ' from 0 to β.

    - ∫ d^d x: Integration over all 'd' spatial dimensions.

    - ψ(x, τ), ψ̄(x, τ): The anti-commuting Grassmann fields, which are functions of position 'x' and imaginary time 'τ'.

    - ∂_τ: The partial derivative with respect to imaginary time, ∂/∂τ.

    - H_0: The single-particle Hamiltonian, which typically includes the kinetic energy. For example, for free fermions, H_0 = - (ħ² / (2m)) ∇².

    - μ: The chemical potential.

    - β: The inverse temperature, defined as β = 1 / (k_B * T), where k_B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

Important Boundary Condition:
The trace operation in the definition of the partition function imposes anti-periodic boundary conditions on the fermionic fields in the imaginary time direction:

  ψ(x, τ) = -ψ(x, τ + β)

This anti-periodicity is a direct consequence of the fermionic statistics.
