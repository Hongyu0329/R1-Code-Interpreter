    # Patient's symptoms and negative test results are highly suggestive of Fibromyalgia.
    # Key symptoms to target: Widespread pain, fatigue, anxiety/depression, sleep issues,
    # restless leg syndrome, and paresthesia.

    explanation = """
    Based on the clinical presentation, the patient's symptoms are classic for Fibromyalgia. This condition is characterized by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction ("fibro fog"), and is often accompanied by mood disorders like anxiety and depression. The negative lab results effectively rule out common mimics like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

    The ideal treatment for Fibromyalgia often involves a multi-modal approach targeting various symptoms. Let's analyze the best option:

    - Duloxetine: This is an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) that is FDA-approved for treating Fibromyalgia. It helps manage both the chronic pain and the accompanying anxiety and depression.

    - Gabapentin: This medication is very effective for neuropathic pain symptoms, which would help with the patient's reported paresthesia (numbness and tingling). It is also a primary treatment for restless leg syndrome and can help improve sleep quality.

    - The Combination (Duloxetine + Gabapentin): This combination provides the most comprehensive approach for this specific patient. It addresses the central pain, the mood disorder, the sleep issues, the restless leg syndrome, and the paresthesia. The other options are less complete, as monotherapy may not be sufficient, and the other combinations do not target the patient's full range of symptoms as effectively.
