    print("\nHere's a breakdown of how each component would work together:\n")

    # 1. The Domain
    print("1. The Domain:")
    print("   - Role: This is the most crucial object. It defines the space where the simulation takes place.")
    print("   - Function: You've correctly identified its dual purpose. It not only contains the simulation but also acts as a default barrier on all sides (bottom, top, and walls). Fluid will be prevented from leaving these boundaries. This is standard behavior in solvers like Blender's FLIP Fluids or Mantaflow.\n")

    # 2. The Fluid Emitter (Inflow Object)
    print("2. The Fluid Emitter (Sphere):")
    print("   - Role: This object is the source of the fluid.")
    print("   - Function: By setting a mesh (like a sphere) to be an 'Inflow' or 'Source', you are telling the solver to continuously generate new fluid particles within that shape during the simulation. These particles will then be influenced by forces like gravity.\n")

    # 3. The Obstacle
    print("3. The Obstacle (Plane):")
    print("   - Role: This object interacts with the fluid.")
    print("   - Function: When the fluid falls from the inflow sphere, it will hit the plane. The solver calculates the collision, causing the fluid to splash and spread out across the plane's surface. Eventually, it will spill over the edges and continue falling towards the bottom of the domain.\n")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("All three components are fundamental to a standard fluid simulation and are described correctly for their intended roles. The combination will result in a perfectly valid and functioning simulation where fluid is generated, collides with an object, and is contained within the scene.")
