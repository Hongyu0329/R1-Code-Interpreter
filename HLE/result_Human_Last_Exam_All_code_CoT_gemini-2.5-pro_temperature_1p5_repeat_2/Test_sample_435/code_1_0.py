Scientific Prediction on IL-15's Effect on CAR T Cell Cytokine Release:

Given the body of evidence, one would predict that CAR T cells manufactured in the presence of interleukin-15 will exhibit **enhanced and more potent cytokine release** upon encountering their target antigen, compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15.

Rationale:
1.  **Promotion of a Memory Phenotype:** IL-15 is a cytokine critical for the survival and maintenance of memory T cells, particularly central memory (Tcm) and stem cell memory (Tscm) phenotypes. Manufacturing CAR T cells with IL-15 enriches for these less-differentiated, more persistent cell populations.

2.  **Robust Recall Response:** Memory T cells are characterized by their ability to mount a rapid and powerful response upon re-exposure to an antigen. This "recall response" includes robust proliferation and the vigorous execution of effector functions.

3.  **Enhanced Effector Function:** Cytokine release is a primary effector function of T cells. Therefore, the IL-15-cultured CAR T cells, being enriched in potent memory subsets, are primed for a stronger activation signal. This leads to a greater capacity to produce and secrete key effector cytokines like Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), and Interleukin-2 (IL-2), which are crucial for orchestrating the anti-tumor immune response.

In summary, the use of IL-15 during manufacturing results in a CAR T cell product with superior fitness and a heightened capacity for effector functions, including cytokine release.
