**Step 1: Analyze the connectivity of the base space X**

The space is X = A U B, where A = Q x D and B = (K \\ Q) x ([0,1] \\ D).
Let's determine if X is connected. Consider any connected subset `C` of X.
 - The projection of `C` onto the x-axis, `pi_1(C)`, is a connected subset of the Cantor set K.
 - The Cantor set K is famously *totally disconnected*, which means its only connected subsets are single points.
 - Therefore, `pi_1(C)` must be a single point, let's call it `x₀`. This implies that the entire set `C` must lie on the single vertical line `{x₀} x [0,1]`.

Now we look at the points of X on this vertical line:
 - If `x₀ ∈ Q`, the points are `{x₀} x D`.
 - If `x₀ ∈ K \\ Q`, the points are `{x₀} x ([0,1] \\ D)`.

In both cases, the set of y-coordinates (either D or [0,1] \\ D) is a totally disconnected subset of `[0,1]`. Therefore, any connected subset `C` on this vertical line must also be a single point. This proves that **the space X is totally disconnected**. Every individual point in X is its own connected component.

**Step 2: Analyze the quotient space Y**

The space Y is created by identifying all points in the set `S = Q x {{1}}` to a single new point, let's call it `p*`.
 - The connected components of Y are its maximal connected subsets.
 - Let's see which points are connected. A path between two points in Y would correspond to ("lift to") a path between corresponding points in X.
 - Since X is totally disconnected, no path can exist between any two distinct points in X.
 - This means no path can exist between `p*` and any other point `[p]` in Y (where `p` was not in `S`). Similarly, no path can exist between any two distinct points `[p₁]` and `[p₂]` in Y.
 - Therefore, every single point in the quotient space Y is its own connected component.

**Step 3: Count the components**

Since every point in Y is a component, the number of components is simply the total number of points in Y.
 - The space Y is composed of the special point `p*` and all the points from X that were not identified.
 - The set of points not identified is `X \\ S`.
 - So, the total number of components is `1 + |X \\ S|`.

We now calculate the cardinality (the "size") of `X \\ S`:
 - `X \\ S = (Q x (D \\ {{1}})) U ((K \\ Q) x ([0,1] \\ D))`
 - The cardinality of `Q x (D \\ {{1}})` is `|Q| * |D \\ {{1}}|`. Since Q and D are countable, this is `{aleph_0} * {aleph_0} = {aleph_0}`.
 - The cardinality of `(K \\ Q) x ([0,1] \\ D)` is `|K \\ Q| * |[0,1] \\ D|`.
   - The Cantor set K has `c` points. `|K \\ Q| = c - {aleph_0} = {c}`.
   - The set `[0,1] \\ D` has `c` points. `|[0,1] \\ D| = c - {aleph_0} = {c}`.
   - The cardinality of their product is `{c} * {c} = {c}`.
 - The total cardinality `|X \\ S|` is `{aleph_0} + {c} = {c}`.

**Step 4: Final Conclusion**

The number of components is given by the final equation using cardinal arithmetic:
1 + {c} = {c}

The space has {c} connected components, where {c} is the cardinality of the continuum.
