    print("Step 1: Analyze the properties of the space X.")
    print("X is a metric space, locally compact, and satisfies Property P1:")
    print("P1: For each pair of distinct points x,y in X, there exists a closed connected set K such that x is in the interior of K and y is not in K.")
    print("Crucially, there exists a continuous bijection (one-to-one and onto map) f from the real line R to X.\n")

    print("Step 2: Prove that X cannot contain any simple closed curve (a 'loop').")
    print("  - Assume X contains a loop C, which is homeomorphic to a circle S^1.")
    print("  - Let A be the preimage of C in R, i.e., A = f^{-1}(C).")
    print("  - The map f restricted to A is a continuous bijection from A to C.")
    print("  - Since C is connected, its preimage A under a continuous map must also be connected (if we consider the map from A to C). So, A must be an interval in R.")
    print("  - Since C is compact and f is continuous, for the inverse f^{-1} to be continuous on C, A must be compact. Thus, A must be a closed interval [a, b].")
    print("  - So, we would need a continuous bijection from a closed interval [a, b] to a circle C. This is impossible.")
    print("  - A simple proof: Removing two distinct points from [a, b] (that are not a,b) disconnects it into 3 parts. Removing two distinct points from a circle C leaves it connected.")
    print("  - Since a homeomorphism must preserve the connectivity properties upon removal of points, [a, b] and C are not homeomorphic. A continuous bijection between compact Hausdorff spaces implies they are homeomorphic.")
    print("  - Therefore, our assumption is false. X cannot contain any simple closed curve.\n")

    print("Step 3: Prove that X cannot have complex branch points.")
    print("  - Let p be any point in X. Let t_0 = f^{-1}(p) be its unique preimage in R.")
    print("  - The set R \\ {t_0} consists of two connected components: (-infinity, t_0) and (t_0, infinity).")
    print("  - Since f is continuous, it maps connected sets to connected sets.")
    print("  - The image of R \\ {t_0} is X \\ {p}. Specifically, f(R \\ {t_0}) = f((-infinity, t_0)) U f((t_0, infinity)).")
    print("  - This means X \\ {p} is the union of two connected sets. Therefore, X \\ {p} can have at most two connected components.")
    print("  - This must hold for every point p in X. This rules out spaces with junctions where 3 or more paths meet (like a 'Y' shape or a cross), as removing the junction point would create 3 or more connected components.\n")

    print("Step 4: Determine the overall structure of X.")
    print("  - From steps 2 and 3, X is a connected space that contains no loops, and no point disconnects it into more than two components.")
    print("  - A topological space with these properties must be homeomorphic to an interval of the real line R.\n")

    print("Step 5: Identify the specific type of interval.")
    print("  - The possible interval types (up to homeomorphism) are:")
    print("    a) The closed interval [0, 1]")
    print("    b) The half-open interval [0, 1)")
    print("    c) The open interval (0, 1) (which is homeomorphic to R)")
    print("  - We check which of these can be a one-to-one continuous image of R:")
    print("    a) X cannot be homeomorphic to [0, 1] because [0, 1] is compact, but R is not. A continuous map from a compact space (like X=[0,1]) to a Hausdorff space (like R) must have a compact image. f^{-1}([0,1])=R, which is not compact. Contradiction.")
    print("    b) X cannot be homeomorphic to [0, 1). A non-compact space has one or more 'ends'. R has two ends (at +infinity and -infinity). [0, 1) has only one end (at 1). The number of ends is a topological property that must be preserved by a homeomorphism, and a continuous bijection between such spaces would have to be a homeomorphism.")
    print("    c) X can be homeomorphic to (0, 1), as (0, 1) is homeomorphic to R itself. A homeomorphism is a valid continuous bijection.\n")

    print("Step 6: Final Conclusion.")
    print("  - From the steps above, X must be homeomorphic to the real line R.")
    print("  - We must verify that R satisfies the given properties. It is a metric space, locally compact, and is its own one-to-one continuous image (via the identity map).")
    print("  - Does R satisfy Property P1? Yes. For any two distinct points x, y in R, we can choose the closed interval K = [x-1, x+1]. The interior of K is (x-1, x+1), which contains x. We can always choose this interval to be small enough to not include y.")
    print("  - Therefore, only one homeomorphism class satisfies all the given conditions: the class of the real line R.\n")

    print("Final Answer: How many different homeomorphism classes are there for such X?")
