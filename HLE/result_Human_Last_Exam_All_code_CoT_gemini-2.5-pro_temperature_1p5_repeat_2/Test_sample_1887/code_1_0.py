    # Step 1: Analyze the given information
    print("\n1. Let kappa = 2^omega. We are given the following conditions:")
    print("   - The continuum hypothesis fails. This means kappa > aleph_1.")
    print("   - kappa is a singular cardinal. By definition, this means its cofinality, cf(kappa), is strictly less than kappa (cf(kappa) < kappa).")
    print(f"   - kappa < aleph_(omega_(omega + 5)).")

    # Step 2: Apply König's Theorem
    print("\n2. According to König's Theorem, for any infinite cardinal lambda, we have cf(2^lambda) > lambda.")
    print("   In our case, lambda = omega (or aleph_0). Therefore, we have cf(kappa) > omega.")
    print("   This implies that cf(kappa) must be an uncountable cardinal.")

    # Step 3: Characterize the cofinality
    print("\n3. A fundamental property of cofinality is that cf(kappa) must itself be a regular cardinal.")

    # Step 4: Combine the conditions to identify the set X
    print("\n4. We can now combine all these facts. Let theta = cf(kappa). Theta must satisfy:")
    print("   - theta is a regular cardinal.")
    print("   - theta is uncountable (i.e., theta > omega).")
    print("   - theta < kappa < aleph_(omega_(omega + 5)).")
    print("\n   The set X is the set of *possible* values for theta. Standard results in set theory (derived from forcing methods) show that the value of 2^omega is very flexible. It can be a singular cardinal with any cofinality that is not ruled out by the basic constraints.")
    print("   Therefore, X consists of all uncountable regular cardinals that are smaller than the upper bound aleph_(omega_(omega + 5)).")
    print("   X = {theta | theta is an uncountable regular cardinal and theta < aleph_(omega_(omega + 5))}")

    # Step 5: Determine the order type of X
    print("\n5. The order type of X (a set of cardinals) is the order type of the set of their indices when arranged in increasing order.")
    print("   The uncountable regular cardinals are of the form aleph_alpha, where alpha > 0 and aleph_alpha is a regular cardinal.")
    print("   Let I be the set of these indices: I = {alpha | 0 < alpha < omega_(omega + 5) and aleph_alpha is regular}.")
    print("   We need to find the order type of I.")

    # Step 6: Use a sandwich/squeeze argument
    print("\n6. To find the order type of I, we can bound it between two other sets.")
    print("   - Let S be the set of all successor ordinals less than omega_(omega + 5).")
    print(f"     S = {{beta + 1 | beta < omega_(omega + 5)}}.")
    print("     A cardinal of the form aleph_{beta+1} is always regular. Thus, S is a subset of I.")
    print("   - Let A be the set of all ordinals between 0 and omega_(omega + 5) (exclusive).")
    print(f"     A = {{alpha | 0 < alpha < omega_(omega + 5)}}.")
    print("     The set of regular indices I is a subset of all indices A.")
    print("\n   This gives us the relationship: S is a subset of I, which is a subset of A.")
    print("   Therefore, their order types must satisfy: order_type(S) <= order_type(I) <= order_type(A).")

    # Step 7: Calculate the order types of the bounding sets
    print("\n7. Now, we determine the order types of S and A.")
    print(f"   - The set A is the set of all ordinals less than omega_(omega + 5), excluding 0. This set is well-ordered and its order type is omega_(omega + 5).")
    print(f"   - The set S, the set of successor ordinals, is also order-isomorphic to omega_(omega + 5). The map f(beta) = beta + 1 demonstrates this isomorphism.")
    print(f"   - So, we have order_type(A) = omega_(omega + 5) and order_type(S) = omega_(omega + 5).")

    # Step 8: Conclude the result
    print("\n8. From the inequality in Step 6, we have:")
    print(f"   omega_(omega + 5) <= order_type(I) <= omega_(omega + 5)")
    print("   This forces the conclusion that the order type of I must be exactly omega_(omega + 5).")
