    "This problem asks for the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) which is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\). Here's a step-by-step plan to solve this:\n\n1.  **Interpret the \"Sum of Graphs\"**: The term \"sum of graphs\" typically refers to the **graph join** operation, denoted by \\( G_1 + G_2 \\). The join of two graphs is formed by taking their disjoint union and adding all possible edges between the vertices of the two graphs.\n\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Graph Join**: A fundamental theorem in graph theory states that the chromatic number of a join of two graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). This principle extends to the join of multiple graphs. For our graph \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\), the chromatic number will be \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n3.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( C_n \\))**: We need to determine the chromatic number of a single cycle of length \\( n \\). This value depends on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd:\n    *   If \\( n \\) is even (\\( n \\ge 4 \\)), the cycle is bipartite, meaning it can be colored with just **2** colors.\n    *   If \\( n \\) is odd (\\( n \\ge 3 \\)), the cycle is not bipartite and requires **3** colors.\n\n4.  **Maximize the Chromatic Number**: To find the *maximal* chromatic number of \\( G \\), we must choose the case for \\( n \\) (even or odd) that maximizes \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). The maximum value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when \\( n \\) is odd.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Substitute the maximal value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) back into the formula for \\( \\chi(G) \\) to find the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, explains each step, and calculates the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the maximal chromatic number of a graph\n    that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G, where G is the sum of three cycles of length n.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the formula for the chromatic number of the graph sum\n    print(\"Step 1: The Chromatic Number of a Graph Sum\")\n    print(\"The 'sum' of graphs (G1 + G2) refers to the graph join operation.\")\n    print(\"A key property is that the chromatic number of a join of graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers:\")\n    print(\"χ(G1 + G2) = χ(G1) + χ(G2)\")\n    print(\"For our graph G = C_n + C_n + C_n, this means:\")\n    print(\"χ(G) = χ(C_n) + χ(C_n) + χ(C_n) = 3 * χ(C_n)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the chromatic number of a cycle\n    print(\"Step 2: The Chromatic Number of a Cycle (C_n)\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a cycle C_n depends on its length n (for n ≥ 3):\")\n    chi_cn_even = 2\n    chi_cn_odd = 3\n    print(f\"- If n is even, χ(C_n) = {chi_cn_even} (since it's a bipartite graph).\")\n    print(f\"- If n is odd, χ(C_n) = {chi_cn_odd} (since it requires a third color).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Maximize the chromatic number\n    print(\"Step 3: Finding the Maximal Chromatic Number\")\n    print(\"To find the maximal chromatic number of G, we must use the maximal possible value for χ(C_n).\")\n    max_chi_cn = max(chi_cn_even, chi_cn_odd)\n    print(f\"Comparing the two cases, the maximum value for χ(C_n) is {max_chi_cn}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Final calculation\n    print(\"Step 4: Final Calculation\")\n    print(\"We substitute this maximal value back into our formula for χ(G):\")\n    print(\"Maximal χ(G) = 3 * max(χ(C_n))\")\n    final_result = 3 * max_chi_cn\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation with the numbers is:\")\n    print(f\"{max_chi_cn} + {max_chi_cn} + {max_chi_cn} = {final_result}\")\n\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution steps and the result.\nsolve_maximal_chromatic_number()\n\nprint(\"\\n<<<9>>>\")\n```"
