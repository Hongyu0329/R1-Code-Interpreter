    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the number of atoms of each element:** Toluene has 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine the number of basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The 1s orbital is represented by two contracted functions (a split-valence description: '31'). So, there are **2** functions per H atom.\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n        *   The core 1s orbital is represented by one contracted function (the '6').\n        *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are split. Each is represented by two functions (the '31'). This means one set of s and p functions (1s + 3p = 4 functions) for the inner valence part, and another set for the outer valence part (1s + 3p = 4 functions).\n        *   Total per C atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9** functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions:** Sum the functions from all atoms in the molecule.\n    *   Total = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_C = 7\nnum_H = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom with the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C):\n# 1 core function (1s)\n# 4 inner valence functions (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz)\n# 4 outer valence functions (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz)\n# Total = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9\nfunctions_per_C = 9\n\n# For Hydrogen (H):\n# No core electrons\n# 1 inner valence function (1s)\n# 1 outer valence function (1s)\n# Total = 1 + 1 = 2\nfunctions_per_H = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Carbon atoms\ntotal_C_functions = num_C * functions_per_C\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Hydrogen atoms\ntotal_H_functions = num_H * functions_per_H\n\n# Calculate the total for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_C_functions + total_H_functions\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result\nprint(f\"Molecule: Toluene (C{num_C}H{num_H})\")\nprint(f\"Basis Set: 6-31G\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Functions per Carbon (C) atom: {functions_per_C}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Hydrogen (H) atom: {functions_per_H}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"Total number of contracted Gaussian functions:\")\nprint(f\"({num_C} * {functions_per_C}) + ({num_H} * {functions_per_H}) = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
