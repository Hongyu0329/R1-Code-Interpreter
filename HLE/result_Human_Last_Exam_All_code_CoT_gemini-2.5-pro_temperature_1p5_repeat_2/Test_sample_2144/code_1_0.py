# The problem is to find the position x0 where y = -3 for a particle whose
# trajectory is governed by (dy/dx)^3 + y^2 = xy(dy/dx) with y(0) = -1.

# Through analysis of the differential equation, we determined that
# at the point where y = -3, the slope p = dy/dx must satisfy the
# equation: p^4 - 18p - 27 = 0.
# One of the real roots of this equation is p = 3.

# The position x can be expressed in terms of y and p as:
# x = p^2/y + y/p

# We can now compute x0 for y = -3 and p = 3.
y = -3
p = 3

# Calculate x0
x0 = (p**2 / y) + (y / p)
