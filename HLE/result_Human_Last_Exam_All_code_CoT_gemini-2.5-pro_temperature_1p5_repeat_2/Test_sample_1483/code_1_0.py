# The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the collection
# of regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

# Our analysis shows that such a continuum can be constructed by joining
# two indecomposable continua, say M1 and M2, at a single point.

# In this construction, the first indecomposable continuum (M1) becomes
# one regular proper subcontinuum.
num_from_M1 = 1

# The second indecomposable continuum (M2) becomes another regular
# proper subcontinuum.
num_from_M2 = 1

# The total number of regular proper subcontinua in this minimal
# construction is the sum of those contributed by each piece.
# A theorem by Rogers confirms that this number cannot be less than 2.
total_cardinality = num_from_M1 + num_from_M2

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
