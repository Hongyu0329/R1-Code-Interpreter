    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Known Values**:\n    *   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m.\n    *   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit (n=1).\n\n2.  **Determine Necessary Formulas**:\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: The minimum uncertainty is given by the relation Δx ⋅ Δp = ħ / 2, where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. From this, we can express the uncertainty in momentum as Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx).\n    *   **Momentum in a Bohr Orbit**: The angular momentum (L) in a Bohr orbit is quantized as L = n ⋅ ħ. For the first orbit (n=1), L = ħ. We also know that L = p ⋅ r, where p is the momentum and r is the radius of the orbit. Therefore, for the first Bohr orbit, ħ = p₁ ⋅ r₁, which means the momentum is p₁ = ħ / r₁.\n    *   **Radius of the First Bohr Orbit (a₀)**: The radius of the first Bohr orbit (n=1) is a constant, r₁ = a₀ ≈ 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio**:\n    *   We need to find the ratio Δp / p₁.\n    *   Substitute the expressions for Δp and p₁:\n        Ratio = (ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)) / (ħ / r₁)\n    *   The reduced Planck constant (ħ) cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, simplifying the equation to:\n        Ratio = r₁ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    *   Substitute the known values for r₁ and Δx into the simplified equation.\n    *   r₁ = 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n    *   Δx = 10 x 10⁻¹² m\n    *   Calculate the final numerical value.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values and constants.\n# Uncertainty in position in meters (10 pm = 10e-12 m)\ndelta_x = 10e-12\n\n# Radius of the first Bohr orbit in meters (Bohr radius, a0)\nr1 = 5.29177e-11\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the ratio using the simplified formula: ratio = r1 / (2 * delta_x)\n# The uncertainty in momentum (delta_p) is h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n# The momentum in the first Bohr orbit (p1) is h_bar / r1\n# The ratio delta_p / p1 simplifies to r1 / (2 * delta_x) as h_bar cancels out.\nratio = r1 / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 3: Print the final equation with the numbers and the result.\nprint(\"The ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum is given by:\")\nprint(\"Ratio = (Radius of first Bohr orbit) / (2 * Uncertainty of position)\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {r1} m / (2 * {delta_x} m)\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {ratio}\")\n\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"
