The key consideration for a patient post-heart valve surgery is the prevention of thromboembolic events (blood clots).
Prosthetic heart valves, particularly mechanical ones, are foreign surfaces that can trigger the body's clotting cascade.
Without preventive measures, there is a high risk of clot formation on the valve, which can lead to life-threatening complications like a stroke or valve malfunction.
Therefore, the standard of care and the most crucial action to prevent major adverse complications is to start the patient on anticoagulation therapy.
While other options like physical therapy, dietary instructions, and follow-up are important for long-term recovery, preventing thrombosis is the most immediate priority.
