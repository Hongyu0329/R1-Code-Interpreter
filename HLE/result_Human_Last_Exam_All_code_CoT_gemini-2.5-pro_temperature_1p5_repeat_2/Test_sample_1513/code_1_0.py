# The riddle asks for a very specific island town based on four clues.

# 1. Remoteness: "> 500 km from another inhabited island"
# This points to one of the most isolated islands in the world.
# Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands
# and over 3,500 km from the coast of Chile. This fits the clue.

# 2. Geography: "sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera"
# Easter Island is of volcanic origin, made up of three main extinct volcanoes.
# The landscape, including the coastline, is shaped by this volcanic history.

# 3. Naming: "shares the town's name"
# 4. Location: "island town ... sits on a bay"
# The main town on Easter Island is Hanga Roa. It is situated on the coast
# in a bay that is also called Hanga Roa.

# Conclusion: Hanga Roa is the only place that fits all the descriptions.

solution = "Hanga Roa"
