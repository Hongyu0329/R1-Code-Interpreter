Residue hotspots for human calcium channel beta-1 subunit (CACNB1)

------------------------------------------------------------
1) Hotspots for Interaction with alpha-1 subunit (Cav2.3):
------------------------------------------------------------
Residue: Tyrosine at Position: 215
   Role: Forms part of the hydrophobic binding pocket for the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID).

Residue: Lysine at Position: 254
   Role: Forms key hydrogen bonds with the AID.

Residue: Tyrosine at Position: 256
   Role: Makes critical hydrophobic contact with the AID.

Residue: Tyrosine at Position: 259
   Role: Another critical residue for hydrophobic interaction in the binding groove.

Residue: Tryptophan at Position: 326
   Role: Contributes to the hydrophobic core of the binding interface.

Residue: Valine at Position: 337
   Role: Participates in hydrophobic interactions within the binding pocket.

Residue: Leucine at Position: 340
   Role: Also contributes to the hydrophobic binding interface.


------------------------------------------------------------
2) Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties of alpha-1 subunit:
------------------------------------------------------------
Region: N-terminus at Positions: 1-30
   Role: This entire region is a major modulator of voltage-dependent inactivation kinetics.

Residue: Cysteine at Position: 39
   Role: A specific N-terminal residue shown to be critical for modulating channel inactivation.

Residue: Serine at Position: 162
   Role: Located in the SH3 domain; its phosphorylation state can alter channel modulation.

Region: Hook/V-loop at Positions: 178-209
   Role: A variable region between domains that significantly influences gating and is a key determinant of isoform-specific effects.
