    "This is a classic poker tournament problem that involves understanding position, stack size, and the impact of Independent Chip Model (ICM) pressure near the money bubble.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:**\n    *   **Position: UTG+1.** This is an early position, meaning we need a strong hand to go all-in because many players are left to act behind us.\n    *   **Stack Size: 16bb.** This is a \"shove/fold\" stack. We don't have enough chips to raise and then fold, so our only moves are to go all-in or fold.\n    *   **Situation: Money Bubble.** This is the crucial detail. ICM pressure is very high. Busting out now is a disaster, so we must be more risk-averse than in a normal tournament phase. This means we should shove a tighter, stronger range of hands.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   Our shoving range must be strong enough to have good equity even when we get called.\n    *   Opponents on the bubble will also be playing cautiously and will likely only call an all-in from an early position player with a very strong range of hands (e.g., big pairs and premium Ace-x hands).\n    *   I will estimate a typical tight calling range for our opponents (e.g., TT+, AQs+, AKo) and calculate the equity of each hand option against that range.\n    *   Hands with low equity against this calling range are bad shoves because the risk of getting eliminated is too high for the potential reward.\n\n3.  **Execute the Plan:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to present the analysis. The script will outline the scenario, calculate the equity of each potential hand against the estimated calling range, and use this data to draw a conclusion. The equity represents the percentage of the time our hand will win at showdown if called.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker hand scenario to determine the correct all-in shove.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
