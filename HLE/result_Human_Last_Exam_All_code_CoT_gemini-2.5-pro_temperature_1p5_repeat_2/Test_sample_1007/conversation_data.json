    "This task requires analyzing the starting and ending positions of several classical ballet steps to find which one concludes in the exact same position it began. I will model this using Python.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will represent the dancer's starting leg position in 5th position. For simplicity, let's define this as a tuple `('Left Foot', 'Right Foot')`, where the first element is the back foot and the second is the front foot.\n2.  For each ballet step listed in the answer choices, I will create a function that simulates the movement and returns the resulting end position.\n3.  I will then systematically call each function with the same starting position.\n4.  By comparing the starting position to the ending position for each step, the code will identify and print the name of the step where the two positions are identical.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ballet_steps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same\n    starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let's define the 5th position: (back_foot, front_foot)\n    start_position = ('Left Foot', 'Right Foot')\n    \n    print(f\"The analysis will start from the 5th position: {start_position[0]} back, {start_position[1]} front.\\n\")\n\n    # Dictionary to hold the analysis results\n    results = {}\n\n    # A.
