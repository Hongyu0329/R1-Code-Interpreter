    # Option A: Aboriginal masks
    print("\n1. Analyzing 'A. Aboriginal masks'...")
    print("   - In Friedkin's 'The Exorcist', Father Merrin finds an amulet of the demon Pazuzu, which is ancient Mesopotamian, not Aboriginal.")
    print("   - There is no significant use of Aboriginal masks in Lang's major films.")
    print("   - Verdict: Incorrect.")

    # Option B: Magic wands
    print("\n2. Analyzing 'B. Magic wands'...")
    print("   - The works of both directors (crime, horror, sci-fi, noir) do not belong to the fantasy subgenre where magic wands would appear.")
    print("   - Verdict: Incorrect.")

    # Option C: The first ever cyborgs on screen
    print("\n3. Analyzing 'C. The first ever cyborgs on screen'...")
    print("   - Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927) features the Maschinenmensch, an iconic automaton (robot), not a cyborg (a being with both organic and biomechatronic parts).")
    print("   - Cyborgs are not a feature in William Friedkin's filmography.")
    print("   - Since the element is not common to both, this is incorrect.")
    print("   - Verdict: Incorrect.")

    # Option D: Bugs
    print("\n4. Analyzing 'D. Bugs'...")
    print("   - William Friedkin directed the film 'Bug' (2006), which is centered on a delusion of insect infestation.")
    print("   - Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' features the demon Pazuzu, a bringer of locust swarms, and the infamous 'spider-walk' scene (spiders are colloquially known as bugs).")
    print("   - Fritz Lang's films, like 'M' and 'The Testament of Dr. Mabuse,' are masterworks of paranoia, exploring themes of societal decay and psychological 'infestation' that Friedkin's work echoes and makes literal with the imagery of bugs.")
    print("   - Verdict: Correct. 'Bugs' serve as a literal image in Friedkin's work that connects directly to core themes in Lang's.")

    print("\n---")
    print("Final Conclusion: 'Bugs' represent a powerful point of connection, encompassing literal imagery and shared themes of paranoia and infestation between the two directors.")
