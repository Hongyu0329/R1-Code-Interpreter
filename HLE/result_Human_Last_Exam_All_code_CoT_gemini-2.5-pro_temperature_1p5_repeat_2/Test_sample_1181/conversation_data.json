    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, the character Dr. Snaut delivers a poignant monologue where he discusses humanity's true desires, concluding that \"man needs man.\" During this speech, he reflects on the simple, earthly things he longs for, expressing a sense of shame for missing details like the rustling of leaves. This feeling stems from the vast, sterile, and alien environment of the space station, which puts his human needs and nostalgia into sharp, painful focus.\n\nTherefore, the correct character is Snaut. I will now generate a Python script to present this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_solaris_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the character from the 1972 movie \"Solaris\"\n    who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The list of characters from the movie provided in the options.\n    characters = {\n        \"A\": \"Kris\",\n        \"B\": \"Hari\",\n        \"C\": \"Snaut\",\n        \"D\": \"Sartorius\",\n        \"E\": \"Gibarian\"\n    }\n    \n    # The correct character is Dr. Snaut.\n    correct_option = \"C\"\n    character_name = characters[correct_option]\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the answer.\n    print(f\"In the 1972 film 'Solaris', the character who expresses shame for missing earthly sounds like rustling leaves is Dr. {character_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The correct answer choice is: {correct_option}\")\n\nfind_solaris_character()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
