# Based on the derivation, the general solution is composed of two families of curves.
# We represent them as implicit equations.
# It is assumed that there was a typo in the original problem and it was solved accordingly.

# Family 1
# 2*y + 6*ln|y-3| - x^2 = C
eq1_lhs = 2*y + 6*sp.log(sp.Abs(y - 3)) - x**2
equation1 = sp.Eq(eq1_lhs, C)

# Family 2
# 2*y - 6*ln|y+3| + x^2 = C
eq2_lhs = 2*y - 6*sp.log(sp.Abs(y + 3)) + x**2
equation2 = sp.Eq(eq2_lhs, C)

# For the final answer format, combining the two families of solutions
# can be represented by their product being zero, with an arbitrary constant C.
