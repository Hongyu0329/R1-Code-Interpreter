    Calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.
    
    The solution is derived by a case-by-case analysis based on the distribution of the
    four morphisms among the four hom-sets. Let the objects be A and B. The morphisms
    must include the identities id_A and id_B. Let the other two be f and g.
    
    The number of non-identity morphisms in each hom-set (n_AA', n_AB, n_BA, n_BB') must sum to 2.
    n_AA' = |Hom(A,A)|-1, n_AB = |Hom(A,B)|, etc.
    This gives 10 possible distributions of (n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB). These fall into 6
    isomorphism classes when swapping objects A and B is considered.
