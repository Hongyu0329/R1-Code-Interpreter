    "This is a problem of classifying finite categories. To solve it, we need to perform a careful case-by-case analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify constraints:** A category with 2 objects, say A and B, must have two identity morphisms, `id_A` and `id_B`. With a total of 4 morphisms, this leaves 2 other non-identity morphisms to distribute, let's call them `f` and `g`.\n2.  **Distribute morphisms:** The two non-identity morphisms `f` and `g` must be placed into the four possible hom-sets: `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`, `Hom(B,B)`. I'll enumerate all possible ways to distribute `f` and `g`.\n3.  **Handle isomorphisms:** Two categories are isomorphic if they are structurally the same. This means we must account for two types of isomorphisms:\n    a.  **Object isomorphism:** Swapping the objects A and B. This transforms a category with hom-set sizes `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)` into one with sizes `(n_BB, n_BA, n_AB, n_AA)`. I will group distributions that are isomorphic in this way.\n    b.  **Morphism isomorphism:** Relabeling the morphisms `f` and `g`.\n4.  **Analyze composition laws:** For each non-isomorphic distribution of morphisms, I'll determine the possible composition laws that satisfy the category axioms (associativity and identity). The number of valid, distinct composition structures gives the number of categories for that distribution.\n5.  **Sum the results:** The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from each non-isomorphic case.\n\nI will implement a python script to lay out this case analysis and calculate the final sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n    \n    The solution is derived by a case-by-case analysis based on the distribution of the\n    four morphisms among the four hom-sets. Let the objects be A and B. The morphisms\n    must include the identities id_A and id_B. Let the other two be f and g.\n    \n    The number of non-identity morphisms in each hom-set (n_AA', n_AB, n_BA, n_BB') must sum to 2.\n    n_AA' = |Hom(A,A)|-1, n_AB = |Hom(A,B)|, etc.\n    This gives 10 possible distributions of (n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB). These fall into 6\n    isomorphism classes when swapping objects A and B is considered.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Case 1: Hom-set sizes are (3, 0, 0, 1) or (1, 0, 0, 3)\n    # The two non-identity morphisms are in Hom(A,A) (or Hom(B,B)).\n    # Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f, g} must form a monoid of order 3.\n    # We need to count the number of monoids of order 3, up to isomorphism\n    # that includes relabeling of the non-identity elements.\n    # The non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are 7.
