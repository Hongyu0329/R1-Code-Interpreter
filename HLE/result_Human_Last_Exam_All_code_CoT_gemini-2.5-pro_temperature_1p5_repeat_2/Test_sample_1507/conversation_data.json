    "The user wants to determine the number of triangles that make up the visible surface of a great icosahedron.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I need to identify what the \"outer-hull\" or the visible surface of a great icosahedron is. The great icosahedron is a complex, non-convex shape, but its convex hull (the smallest convex shape that encloses it) is a standard, regular icosahedron. The \"visible triangles from the outside\" corresponds to the faces of this convex hull.\n2.  A regular icosahedron is one of the five Platonic solids. Its faces are all equilateral triangles. I need to find the number of faces it has.\n3.  I can find the number of faces (F) using Euler's formula for polyhedra, which states `V - E + F = 2`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.\n4.  For a regular icosahedron, the number of vertices (V) is 12, and the number of edges (E) is 30.\n5.  I will use these values in the formula to calculate F: `F = 2 - V + E`.\n6.  The Python script will define `V` and `E`, calculate `F`, and print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron.
