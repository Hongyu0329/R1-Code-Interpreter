    This script analyzes four sets of natural numbers to determine for which of them
    a power series can exist that converges everywhere on the closed unit disk,
    but does not converge absolutely on the unit circle.

    The mathematical background is that such a power series can be constructed if and only if
    the set of indices of its non-zero coefficients is NOT a "Sidon set".
    A Sidon set has strong restrictions on its additive properties, and lacunary (gappy)
    sets are typically Sidon sets. We will investigate each set for properties that
    would classify it as Sidon or not.
