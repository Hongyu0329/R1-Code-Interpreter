    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  I will first identify the key clues from the provided text.\n2.  The first clue, \"the prohibition against representation,\" is a clear reference to the Second Commandment from the Bible, which forbids the creation of graven images.\n3.  The second clue, addressing \"the issue of another's material possessions\" at \"the end of HIS work,\" points to the Tenth Commandment, which warns against coveting a neighbor's property and is the last of the commandments.\n4.  The historical and religious figure who, according to Abrahamic religions, received these commandments from God on Mount Sinai is Moses. The \"work\" refers to the Decalogue, or the Ten Commandments.\n5.  Based on these clues, the full name of \"HE\" is Moses.\n6.  I will write a Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\n# The clues in the problem point to a famous historical and religious figure.\n# \"the prohibition against representation\" refers to the Second Commandment (against graven images).\n# The rule about \"another's material possessions\" at the end of the work refers to the Tenth Commandment (against coveting).\n# The work containing these commandments is the Ten Commandments, and the person who delivered them is Moses.\n\nhis_full_name = \"Moses\"\nprint(his_full_name)\n```\n<<<Moses>>>"
