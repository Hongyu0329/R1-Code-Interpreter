    "Answering this question requires referencing pharmaceutical compounding standards, specifically the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> on Sterile Compounding. The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) depends on the type of container and the environment in which it is handled.\n\nHere is my plan to provide the answer using a Python script:\n1.  Create a Python dictionary to store the specific BUD rules for different single-dose containers as defined by USP <797>.\n2.  The script will look up the rule for an \"ampule,\" which is a single-dose container that cannot be resealed after being opened.\n3.  The script will print the BUD for an ampule opened in a sterile environment (ISO Class 5 or cleaner).\n4.  For clarity and to prevent common confusion, the script will also print the contrasting rule for a single-dose *vial*, which has a resealable stopper.\n5.  The final output will be presented in a clear, easy-to-read format.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides Beyond-Use Date (BUD) information for single-dose containers\n    based on USP <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    bud_rules = {\n        \"ampule\": {\n            \"name\": \"Single-Dose Ampule\",\n            \"environment\": \"Any (including sterile ISO Class 5)\",\n            \"bud\": \"Immediate use\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Once an ampule is opened, it cannot be resealed. It is an open system exposed to the environment, so its contents must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded.\"\n        },\n        \"single_dose_vial_iso5\": {\n            \"name\": \"Single-Dose Vial\",\n            \"environment\": \"Sterile (ISO Class 5 or cleaner)\",\n            \"bud_hours\": 12,\n            \"explanation\": \"A single-dose vial punctured in a sterile environment can be used for up to 12 hours, as its rubber stopper can be disinfected and reseals after puncture.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Answer the specific question about the ampule\n    ampule_info = bud_rules[\"ampule\"]\n    print(\"--- BUD for a Single-Dose Ampule ---\")\n    print(f\"Container Type: {ampule_info['name']}\")\n    print(f\"Punctured in Environment: {ampule_info['environment']}\")\n    print(f\"Beyond-Use Date (BUD): {ampule_info['bud']}\")\n    print(f\"Reason: {ampule_info['explanation']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    # Provide context by showing the rule for a single-dose vial\n    vial_info = bud_rules[\"single_dose_vial_iso5\"]\n    print(\"\\n--- For Comparison: BUD for a Single-Dose Vial ---\")\n    print(f\"Container Type: {vial_info['name']}\")\n    print(f\"Punctured in Environment: {vial_info['environment']}\")\n    # Output the number from the rule as requested\n    bud_duration_hours = vial_info['bud_hours']\n    print(f\"Beyond-Use Date (BUD): Up to {bud_duration_hours} hours after initial puncture.\")\n    print(f\"Reason: {vial_info['explanation']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_bud_information()\n```\n<<<Immediate use>>>"
