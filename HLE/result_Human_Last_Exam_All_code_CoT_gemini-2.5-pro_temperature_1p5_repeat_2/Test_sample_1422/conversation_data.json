    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the general topological relations that govern these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Formulas:** We'll use two fundamental formulas that relate the number of loops (L), internal propagators (I), vertices (V), external lines (E), and the number of lines per vertex (n).\n    *   `L = I - V + 1`\n    *   `n * V = 2 * I + E`\n2.  **Select the Simplest Case:** To find the *minimum* number of vertices, we should consider the simplest possible scenario:\n    *   **Theory:** The most common interacting scalar field theory is $\\phi^4$ theory, where each vertex connects four lines (so, `n = 4`).\n    *   **Process:** The simplest process is a vacuum diagram, which describes the vacuum energy and has no incoming or outgoing particles (so, `E = 0`).\n3.  **Set up and Solve Equations:** With the number of loops `L = 2`, `n = 4`, and `E = 0`, we will have a system of two equations with two unknowns (I and V). We can solve this system to find the value of V.\n4.  **Present the Calculation:** The Python code will walk through these steps, state the formulas, substitute the values, and solve the resulting equation to find the minimum number of vertices.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in an interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
