    # the impossibility of an actual, completed infinite).

    # B) He directly rejected Aristotle's position.
    # C) He saw a beginning of time as a necessary consequence of creation.
    # E) He believed strong philosophical arguments, not just faith, showed time must have a beginning.
    # G) He argued an infinite past implies an 'actual infinite' number of past events, which is impossible.
    # H) He argued it's impossible to 'traverse' an infinite number of days to get to the present.
    # J) His arguments presuppose that time is sequential.
