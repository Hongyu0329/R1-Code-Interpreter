    # The minimal possible cardinality of X occurs in a model where all uncountable
    # MAD families have the same size. Such models exist.
    # For example, in a model of Martin's Axiom with c = omega_2 and 2^omega_1 = omega_3,
    # the set of uncountable MAD family cardinalities X is {omega_2}.

    # of as many different sizes as possible.
    # With c = omega_3, it's consistent to have MAD families of sizes
    # omega_1, omega_2, and omega_3.
    # Thus, X can be {omega_1, omega_2, omega_3}, so |X| = 3.
