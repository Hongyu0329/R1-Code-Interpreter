    "The user's question contains a fundamental contradiction. Let's break it down:\n\n1.  **Optical Activity**: This is the property of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. For a crystal to exhibit natural optical activity, it must be chiral.\n2.  **Chiral Crystal Classes**: A crystal class is chiral if it does not possess any rotoinversion axes, which include a center of inversion (symolized by -1) or a mirror plane (m). There are 11 such chiral (and thus optically active) crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432.\n3.  **Achiral Crystal Classes**: These are all the other 21 crystal classes that are *not* chiral. By definition, they possess symmetry elements (like a mirror plane or inversion center) that make them superimposable on their mirror image.\n4.  **The Contradiction**: The question asks for crystal classes that are **achiral** but also have the symmetry for **optical activity**. This is impossible, as the necessary symmetry for optical activity is chirality. Therefore, an achiral class cannot be optically active.\n\nGiven this is a multiple-choice question, it is highly likely that the question is flawed and intends to ask something else. The most probable intended question is: \"Which of the following answer choices lists crystal classes that are all **achiral and non-polar**?\". The phrase \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" should be disregarded as it creates a logical impossibility.\n\nI will write a Python script to solve this re-interpreted question. The script will:\n1.  Define the properties (chiral/achiral, polar/non-polar) for all crystal classes mentioned in the options.\n2.  Check each option to see if all the crystal classes listed within it satisfy the conditions of being **achiral** and **non-polar**.\n3.  Print the analysis for each option to identify the correct choice(s) based on this corrected interpretation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystallography_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes crystal classes based on their properties to answer a flawed question.\n\n    The question asks for crystal classes that are \"achiral\", \"non-polar\",\n    and \"optically active\".
