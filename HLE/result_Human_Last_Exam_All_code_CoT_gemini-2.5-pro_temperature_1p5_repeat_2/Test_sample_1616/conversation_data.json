    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the word that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing:\n\n1.  **Understand the Rule:** First, I need to understand the phonological rule known as \"Trisyllabic Laxing\" (or Trisyllabic Shortening). This rule states that a tense or long vowel in a root word (like the /eɪ/ in *sane*) becomes lax or short (like the /æ/ in *sanity*) when that vowel ends up in the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable of a derived word.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Word:** I will analyze each word in the list by comparing it to its base form or a closely related word to check for this vowel change.\n    *   **southern:** Derived from `south`. The diphthong /aʊ/ in `south` shortens to the lax vowel /ʌ/ in `southern`. This is vowel shortening, although the word is only two syllables long.\n    *   **derivative:** Derived from `derive`. The diphthong /aɪ/ in `derive` shortens to the lax vowel /ɪ/ in `derivative`. The affected syllable (`-riv-`) is the third from the end, so this is a classic case of trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **serenity:** Derived from `serene`. The long vowel /iː/ in `serene` shortens to the lax vowel /ɛ/ in `serenity`. The affected syllable (`-ren-`) is the third from the end, a clear example of the rule.\n    *   **pleasant:** Derived from `please`. The long vowel /iː/ in `please` shortens to the lax vowel /ɛ/ in `pleasant`. This is another case of vowel shortening, though not strictly \"trisyllabic\".\n    *   **gratitude:** Related to `grateful`. The tense vowel /eɪ/ in the root of `grateful` is a lax vowel /æ/ in `gratitude`. The affected syllable (`grat-`) is the third from the end. This fits the pattern.\n    *   **shadow:** Etymologically related to `shade`. The word pair `shade` (/ʃeɪd/) and `shadow` (/'ʃædoʊ/) appears to fit the pattern. However, historical linguistics shows that `shadow` comes from the Old English word *sceadu*, which already had a short /æ/ vowel. It did not undergo a shortening process from a long-vowel ancestor. The word `shade` evolved from a different, though related, Old English form.\n\n3.  **Identify the Exception:** Based on the historical analysis, all words except `shadow` have undergone a vowel laxing/shortening process from their corresponding base form. `shadow` is the exception because its short vowel is original to its historical root and is not the result of phonological shortening.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that stores this linguistic analysis in a dictionary. The code will then iterate through the data to programmatically identify and print the word that did not undergo laxing, along with the detailed reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_non_laxed_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to find the one that did not undergo historical vowel laxing.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This dictionary stores the linguistic analysis for each word.\n    # The 'undergone_laxing' key is True if the word's current vowel sound\n    # is the result of a historical shortening process from a related word.\n    word_analysis = {\n        'southern': {\n            'base': 'south',\n            'vowel_change': '/aʊ/ -> /ʌ/',\n            'explanation': \"The vowel was shortened from the base word 'south'.
