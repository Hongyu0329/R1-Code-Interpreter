    "The problem asks for the steady-state value of $P_0(t) + P_1(t)$ as $t \\to +\\infty$. These steady-state probabilities, which we can denote as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, are found by setting the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ to zero.\n\nFirst, it is important to check the consistency of the provided system of equations. For a system describing probabilities of a closed set of states, the sum of probabilities must be constant (i.e., $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$), which implies that the sum of their derivatives must be zero ($\\sum P_i'(t) = 0$).\n\nLet's sum the right-hand sides of the given equations:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i'(t) = [-\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)] + [-\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)] + [\\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)] + [\\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)]\n$$\nGrouping terms by $P_i(t)$:\n- For $P_0(t)$: $-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01} = -2\\lambda_{01}$\n- For $P_1(t)$: $\\lambda_{10} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12}) + \\lambda_{12} = 0$\n- For $P_2(t)$: $\\lambda_{21} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}) + \\lambda_{23} = 0$\n- For $P_3(t)$: $\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31} = 0$\n\nThe sum is $\\sum P_i'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. For this sum to be zero, since $\\lambda_{01}=0.019 \\neq 0$, we must have $P_0(t)=0$ for all time. This, however, leads to inconsistencies with the rest of the system and the normalization condition $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, it is highly likely that there is a typo in the second equation. A standard Kolmogorov-Chapman system for the described state transitions would have a positive sign for the first term:\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = \\mathbf{+}\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\nWith this correction, the sum of derivatives becomes zero, and the system is consistent. I will proceed assuming this correction has been made.\n\nMy plan to solve the corrected problem is as follows:\n1.  Set all derivatives $P_i'(t)$ to zero to obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$.\n2.  From these equations, express $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n3.  Use the normalization condition $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$ to find the numerical value of $\\pi_1$.\n4.  Calculate the numerical value of $\\pi_0$.\n5.  Compute the final desired sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# These are the transition rates given in the problem description.\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state (t -> +inf), the probabilities P_i are constant, so P_i'(t) = 0.\n# This converts the system of differential equations into a system of linear equations.\n# We solve for the steady-state probabilities pi_0, pi_1, pi_2, pi_3.\n#\n# The linear equations are:\n# 1) 0 = -lambda_01 * pi_0 + lambda_10 * pi_1\n# 2) 0 = lambda_12 * pi_1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23) * pi_2\n# 3) 0 = lambda_23 * pi_2 - lambda_31 * pi_3\n# 4) 1 = pi_0 + pi_1 + pi_2 + pi_3  (Normalization condition)\n\n# From equation (1), we can express pi_0 in terms of pi_1:\n# pi_0 = (lambda_10 / lambda_01) * pi_1\nratio_pi0_pi1 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\n\n# From equation (2), we express pi_2 in terms of pi_1:\n# pi_2 = (lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)) * pi_1\nratio_pi2_pi1 = lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)\n\n# From equation (3), we express pi_3 in terms of pi_2, and then in terms of pi_1:\n# pi_3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * pi_2\n# pi_3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * ratio_pi2_pi1 * pi_1\nratio_pi3_pi1 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * ratio_pi2_pi1\n\n# Now we substitute these into the normalization equation (4):\n# (ratio_pi0_pi1 * pi_1) + pi_1 + (ratio_pi2_pi1 * pi_1) + (ratio_pi3_pi1 * pi_1) = 1\n# pi_1 * (ratio_pi0_pi1 + 1 + ratio_pi2_pi1 + ratio_pi3_pi1) = 1\n# pi_1 = 1 / (ratio_pi0_pi1 + 1 + ratio_pi2_pi1 + ratio_pi3_pi1)\n\ndenominator_for_pi1 = ratio_pi0_pi1 + 1 + ratio_pi2_pi1 + ratio_pi3_pi1\npi_1 = 1 / denominator_for_pi1\n\n# Now we can calculate pi_0:\npi_0 = ratio_pi0_pi1 * pi_1\n\n# The problem asks for the sum of P_0(+inf) and P_1(+inf), which is pi_0 + pi_1.\nresult = pi_0 + pi_1\n\nprint(f\"Based on the corrected system of equations, the steady-state probabilities P_0(+inf) and P_1(+inf) are calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"P_0(+inf) = {pi_0}\")\nprint(f\"P_1(+inf) = {pi_1}\")\nprint(f\"The final sum is P_0(+inf) + P_1(+inf) = {pi_0} + {pi_1} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339462>>>"
