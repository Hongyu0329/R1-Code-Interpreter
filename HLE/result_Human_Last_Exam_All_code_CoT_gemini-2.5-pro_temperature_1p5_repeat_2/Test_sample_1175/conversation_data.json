    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Solve the Differential Equation:** The provided equation, $x_{3}'(t) + \\tanh(t) x_{3}(t) = e^{-\\frac{t}{3}}$, is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. I will solve it using the integrating factor method. The integrating factor $\\mu(t)$ is calculated as $e^{\\int \\tanh(t) dt}$, which simplifies to $\\cosh(t)$. Multiplying the ODE by $\\mu(t)$ makes the left side the derivative of a product, $(\\mu(t)x_3(t))'$. I will then integrate both sides to find a general solution for $x_3(t)$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Initial Condition:** I will use the initial condition $x_3(0) = 5$ to determine the constant of integration, $C$, from the general solution, yielding the particular solution for the problem.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Target Expression:** I will analyze the expression to be evaluated: $(10^{5} + 10^{-5})x_{3}(\\ln10^{5}) + \\frac{3}{4}10^{\\frac{-20}{3}}$. Letting $t_0 = \\ln(10^5)$, I will use the identity $10^5 + 10^{-5} = 2\\cosh(t_0)$ to simplify the first term. This allows me to use the expression for $\\cosh(t)x_3(t)$ found in the previous steps directly.\n\n4.  **Evaluate and Calculate:** I will substitute $t_0 = \\ln(10^5)$ into the simplified expression. The exponential terms will be converted into powers of 10. After algebraic simplification, a final numerical expression will emerge. The provided Python code will then calculate this value, displaying the components of the final calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# After solving the differential equation and substituting the values, the expression simplifies to the following form:\n# (3/2) * 10^(10/3) + 37/4\n# The Python code below calculates this value.\n\n# We define each number from the simplified final equation\nterm1_coeff_num = 3\nterm1_coeff_den = 2\nbase = 10\nexponent_num = 10\nexponent_den = 3\nterm2_num = 37\nterm2_den = 4\n\n# Perform the calculation\nterm1_coeff = term1_coeff_num / term1_coeff_den\nexponent = exponent_num / exponent_den\nterm2 = term2_num / term2_den\n\nresult = term1_coeff * (base ** exponent) + term2\n\n# Print the final equation with its numerical components and the final result\nprint(f\"The final simplified equation is: ({term1_coeff_num}/{term1_coeff_den}) * {base}**({exponent_num}/{exponent_den}) + ({term2_num}/{term2_den})\")\nprint(f\"The calculated value is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<3240.902035492344>>>"
