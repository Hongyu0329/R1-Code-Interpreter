    "Based on the physical principles of nonlinear optics, I can determine the likelihood of boron nanosheets exhibiting Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC). Here is my plan to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the physical requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC. SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process, which is governed by the material's second-order susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  A fundamental requirement for a material to have a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is that its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  Therefore, the problem is reduced to checking the crystal symmetry of common boron nanosheet structures (also known as borophene).\n4.  The most commonly synthesized borophene phases are $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_{3}$. Their crystal structures correspond to the space groups *pmmn* and *cmm*, respectively.\n5.  I will write a Python script to check if these space groups are centrosymmetric. The script will act as a simple database and print out the conclusion based on this symmetry analysis.\n6.  The script's output will show that these structures are indeed centrosymmetric, meaning their bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero. This forbids the SPDC process. The code will explicitly state the value of the relevant coefficient (`chi^(2) = 0`) in the physical equation for nonlinear polarization.\n\n```python\ndef check_spdc_in_borophene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes whether boron nanosheets (borophene) would exhibit\n    Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) based on crystal symmetry.\n\n    SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect, characterized by the\n    second-order susceptibility tensor chi^(2).
