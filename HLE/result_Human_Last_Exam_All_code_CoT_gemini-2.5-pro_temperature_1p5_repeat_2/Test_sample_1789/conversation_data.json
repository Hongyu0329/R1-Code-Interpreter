    "An elegant theorem by Erdös states that the largest subset of integers in `[1, N]` that can be expressed as a union of `k` antichains (in the divisor poset) is the set of integers having one of the `k` most frequent numbers of prime factors (counted with multiplicity, denoted by `Ω(n)`). Such a set is called a `k`-antichain.\n\nThe problem asks for the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in the set `S = [1, 823564528378596]`. This means we need to find the size of the largest 20-antichain in `S`.\n\nBased on the theorem, our plan is as follows:\n1.  For each possible rank `r`, we define an antichain `A_r = {n in S | Ω(n) = r}`.\n2.  We need to find the sizes of these antichains, `|A_r|`, which we denote as `π_r(N)`.\n3.  We then identify the 20 ranks `r` for which `π_r(N)` is largest.\n4.  The final answer is the sum of these 20 largest `π_r(N)` values.\n\nThe distribution of `Ω(n)` for `n <= N` is known to be approximately a Poisson distribution with mean `λ = ln(ln(N))`.\nFor `N = 823564528378596`, `ln(N) ≈ 34.35` and `λ = ln(ln(N)) ≈ 3.53`.\nThe sizes `π_r(N)` will be maximal for `r` close to `λ`. The values of `π_r(N)` are expected to be ordered according to a bell-shaped curve centered at `r=3` or `r=4`. A detailed analysis shows that the ranks with the largest corresponding antichain sizes are `4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 8, 1`, followed by `9, 10, ...`.\nThe 20 ranks that correspond to the 20 largest antichains are therefore `{1, 2, 3, ..., 20}`.\n\nSo, the problem simplifies to calculating the total number of integers `n` from 1 to `N` such that `1 <= Ω(n) <= 20`.\nThis is equivalent to `(N - 1)` (all numbers from 2 to N) minus the count of numbers `n` for which `Ω(n) >= 21`.\nLet's call the set of these \"high omega\" numbers `H = {n in S | Ω(n) >= 21}`. The answer is `N - 1 - |H|`.\n\nThe numbers in `H` are relatively rare. The smallest such number is `2^21`, which is much smaller than `N`. We can count these numbers using a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n\nThe Python code below implements this logic. It counts the number of integers `n <= N` with `Ω(n) >= 21`. Due to the scale of `N`, this computation is intensive and may take a few minutes to complete. The core of the logic is a recursive function `count_le(omega, limit, prime_idx)` that counts numbers up to `limit` having exactly `omega` prime factors, with all factors being greater than or equal to the prime at `prime_idx`. We sum these counts for `omega` from 21 up to `floor(log2(N))`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generate_primes(n):\n    \"\"\"Generates a list of primes up to n using a sieve.\"\"\"\n    primes = []\n    is_prime = [True] * (n + 1)\n    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False\n    for p in range(2, n + 1):\n        if is_prime[p]:\n            primes.append(p)\n            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):\n                is_prime[i] = False\n    return primes\n\nN = 823564528378596\nMIN_OMEGA = 21\nMAX_OMEGA = int(math.log2(N))\n\n# The largest prime factor p to consider for a number with MIN_OMEGA factors\n# can be at most N / (2^(MIN_OMEGA-1)).\nMAX_PRIME_TO_CHECK = N // (2**(MIN_OMEGA - 1))\n\n# For a practical implementation, generating primes up to this limit is challenging.\n# However, the recursive search will implicitly only use primes up to a much smaller\n# effective limit for most branches, making the calculation feasible.
