    # (a) True or false: The energy J_t becomes unbounded from below as t -> +infinity
    #     if p > 2(1 + 3s) / (1 + s).

    # Reasoning for (a):
    # We analyze the behavior of J(u_t, v_t) for the scaling u_t(x,y) = t^((1+s)/2) u(t^s x, t y).
    # The L^p norm part scales as t^((s+1)(p/2-1)).
    # Assuming s >= 1, the dominant part of the kinetic energy term scales as t^(2s).
    # The condition p > 2(1 + 3s) / (1 + s) is equivalent to the exponent of the negative L^p term
    # being larger than the exponent of the positive kinetic energy term: (s+1)(p/2 - 1) > 2s.
    # Thus, for a suitable choice of u (and v=0), J(u_t, v_t) can be made arbitrarily
    # negative as t -> infinity. This implies the functional is unbounded below.
    answer_a = "True"

    # (b) Given J_t(u, v) has a mountain pass geometry, does the existence of a critical point
    #     imply the existence of a positive ground state solution?

    # Reasoning for (b):
    # The existence of a critical point, often established by the Mountain Pass Theorem, does not
    # by itself guarantee the existence of a ground state solution (a solution minimizing the
    # energy J among all non-trivial solutions). Proving the existence of a ground state requires
    # further compactness arguments to show that a minimizing sequence of solutions converges
    # to a solution, which is a major technical step not guaranteed by the premises.
    answer_b = "No"

    # (c) If r_1 + r_2 lies in the range (2, 2s), does the minimisation of J_t over P(a,b)
    #     yield a unique solution?

    # Reasoning for (c):
    # Uniqueness of solutions for such nonlinear variational problems is rare.
    # 1. Translational invariance implies that if a solution exists, an entire family of
    #    translated solutions also exists.
    # 2. Even up to translation, uniqueness is not guaranteed as the functional is not convex.
    # The condition on r_1 + r_2 is a technical condition likely for existence, not uniqueness.
    answer_c = "No"
