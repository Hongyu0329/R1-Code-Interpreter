    # The "Caramel Sauce" recipe is a recursive function without a base case.
    # A function like `def f(): return f() + f()` will run forever.
    # The recipe calls "Serve with caramel sauce" twice, which represents the two
    # recursive calls in a Fibonacci function. Because there is no condition to
    # stop these calls, it creates an infinite recursion (a fatal bug).
    
    # We must find the option that fixes the infinite recursion.
    # Option F: "Remove the line 'Serve with caramel sauce.' from the 'Caramel Sauce' recipe"
    # is the only choice that addresses this issue. By removing the recursive calls,
    # the function is made to terminate, which is the first step in fixing it.

    # The chosen answer is F.
