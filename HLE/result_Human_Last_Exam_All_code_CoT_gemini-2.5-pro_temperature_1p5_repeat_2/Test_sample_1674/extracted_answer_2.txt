Yes, the theory you described can fail. It holds for reciprocal optical systems but breaks down if a **non-reciprocal** element, such as a **Faraday rotator**, is introduced. Standard birefringent media (like wave plates) are reciprocal and would not violate the theory, but the presence of a magnetic field in a Faraday rotator makes it non-reciprocal, meaning it behaves differently for light traveling forward versus backward. This breaks the time-reversal symmetry that the theory relies upon.
