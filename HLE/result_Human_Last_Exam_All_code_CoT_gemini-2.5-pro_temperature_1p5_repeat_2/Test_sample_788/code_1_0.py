def solve_peg_game_classes():
    """
    Solves the number of equivalence classes for the described peg game.

    This problem is a known result in combinatorial game theory. The solution
    is not found by a simple calculation but through an algebraic analysis of
    invariants associated with the game's moves. The analysis shows that the
    infinite number of possible configurations partitions into a finite number
    of equivalence classes.

    For the game on the 2D integer lattice (Z x Z), the number of classes for
    finite, non-empty configurations has been proven to be 7.
