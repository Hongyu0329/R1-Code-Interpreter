    "For a peptide of this length (100 amino acids) that also includes a non-standard residue like azido phenylalanine, the most helpful and practical synthesis technique is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nDirectly synthesizing a 100-mer peptide using standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is extremely challenging. With each amino acid addition, the yield of the full-length product decreases cumulatively. This not only results in a very low overall yield but also creates a complex mixture of deletion sequences (99-mer, 98-mer, etc.) that are nearly impossible to separate from the desired 100-mer product.\n\nNative Chemical Ligation elegantly solves this problem. The strategy involves:\n1.  **Splitting** the 100-mer sequence into two or more smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two 50-mer peptides).\n2.  **Synthesizing** these shorter fragments individually using SPPS. This is far more efficient, and the unnatural amino acid can be easily incorporated into its respective fragment. The purity of these smaller fragments is much higher and they are easier to purify.\n3.  **Ligating** (joining) the purified fragments together in solution using a highly specific chemical reaction to form the final, full-length 100-mer peptide.\n\nThis approach dramatically improves both the final yield and, more importantly, the purity of the target peptide.\n\nThe following Python script models and compares the theoretical yields of direct SPPS versus the NCL approach, quantitatively demonstrating why NCL is the superior strategy. It calculates the expected yield based on a realistic per-step coupling efficiency.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_peptide_synthesis_yields():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and compares the theoretical yields for synthesizing a long peptide\n    using Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) vs. Native Chemical Ligation (NCL).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    peptide_length = 100\n    # Average coupling efficiency for each amino acid addition in SPPS.\n    # 99.0% is a realistic efficiency for a well-optimized synthesis.\n    spps_coupling_efficiency = 0.99\n    \n    # For NCL, we split the peptide into two fragments.\n    fragment_1_length = 50\n    fragment_2_length = 50 # Must sum to peptide_length\n    \n    # Efficiency of the ligation reaction itself. 70% is a reasonable estimate.\n    ncl_ligation_efficiency = 0.70\n\n    print(\"--- Comparing Peptide Synthesis Strategies ---\")\n    print(f\"Target: A {peptide_length} amino acid peptide.\")\n    print(f\"Assumption: A per-step coupling efficiency of {spps_coupling_efficiency:.1%} for SPPS.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Calculation for Direct SPPS ---\n    print(\"--- Method 1: Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) ---\")\n    direct_spps_steps = peptide_length - 1\n    # The final yield is the efficiency multiplied by itself for each coupling step.\n    direct_spps_yield = spps_coupling_efficiency ** direct_spps_steps\n    \n    print(f\"This method requires {direct_spps_steps} sequential coupling steps.\")\n    print(\"The final theoretical yield is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"Yield = (Coupling Efficiency) ^ (Number of Steps)\")\n    print(f\"      = {spps_coupling_efficiency} ^ {direct_spps_steps}\")\n    print(f\"      = {direct_spps_yield:.3f}\")\n    print(f\"\\nResult: The theoretical yield for direct SPPS is {direct_spps_yield:.1%}.\")\n    print(\"The primary issue is the ~{:.1%} of impurities that are very difficult to remove.\\n\".format(100 - direct_spps_yield * 100))\n\n    # --- Calculation for Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) ---\n    print(\"--- Method 2: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) ---\")\n    print(f\"This method uses two shorter fragments ({fragment_1_length}aa and {fragment_2_length}aa) that are synthesized separately and then joined.\")\n    \n    # Calculate yield for fragment 1\n    frag1_spps_steps = fragment_1_length - 1\n    frag1_spps_yield = spps_coupling_efficiency ** frag1_spps_steps\n    print(\"\\nFirst, calculate the SPPS yield for Fragment 1:\")\n    print(f\"Yield = {spps_coupling_efficiency} ^ {frag1_spps_steps}\")\n    print(f\"      = {frag1_spps_yield:.3f}  (or {frag1_spps_yield:.1%})\")\n\n    # The overall yield of the NCL process is the yield of the limiting purified fragment \n    # multiplied by the ligation efficiency.
