    "The protein that, when broken down, creates a fragment that suppresses macrophage/microglial engulfment of amyloid is **Complement component 3 (C3)**. The breakdown fragment, C3a, binds to the C3a receptor on microglia, which inhibits their ability to clear amyloid-beta plaques. Therefore, blocking the C3/C3aR pathway can restore this engulfment function.\n\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
