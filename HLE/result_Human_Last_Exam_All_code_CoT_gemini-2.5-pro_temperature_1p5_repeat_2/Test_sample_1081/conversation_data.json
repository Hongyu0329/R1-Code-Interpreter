    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Request:** The user wants to find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori for a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The user is asking for a Python script or a shell script to accomplish this task.\n\n2.  **Connect Tori to Weyl Groups:** I will use the fundamental result from the theory of reductive groups over finite fields. This result establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ (up to conjugacy by the rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$) and the $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$. The Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts on $W$.\n\n3.  **Address the Specifics of Type $E_8$:** For a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram is fixed. It has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be of the \"split\" form. In this case, the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ is trivial.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Counting Problem:** A trivial action of $F$ means that the notion of $F$-conjugacy simplifies to that of ordinary conjugacy in the Weyl group $W$. Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n5.  **State the Known Result:** The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a very large and complex group. The computation of its conjugacy classes is a non-trivial task that has been solved using specialized computer algebra systems. The result is a known constant in group theory. I will state this established result.\n\n6.  **Develop the Python Script:** I will create a Python script that carries out the following steps:\n    *   It will explain the theoretical reasoning that transforms the problem from counting tori to counting conjugacy classes.\n    *   It will state the known value for the number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$.\n    *   It will print the final answer in a clear, step-by-step format, as if it were an equation being solved, to satisfy the user's prompt.\n\nThis approach provides a complete answer, explains the underlying mathematics, and delivers the requested Python code, which, while not performing a complex computation, correctly uses programming to present the solution and the logic behind it.\n\n```python\ndef solve_e8_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the number of Fq-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G of type E8.\n\n    The theoretical foundation for this solution is as follows:\n    1.  The number of Fq-rational maximal tori in a reductive group G over a finite field Fq (up to G(Fq)-conjugacy)\n        is equal to the number of F-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group W.\n        The Frobenius endomorphism F acts on W. An F-conjugacy class containing an element w from W is the set\n        {x * w * F(x)^(-1) for all x in W}.\n\n    2.  For a group G of type E8, the Dynkin diagram has a trivial automorphism group. A key consequence is that\n        any such group over a finite field is 'split', and the associated Frobenius endomorphism F acts trivially on\n        the Weyl group W.\n\n    3.  When the action of F is trivial, F(x) = x for all x in W. The formula for an F-conjugacy class simplifies to\n        {x * w * x^(-1) for all x in W}, which is the standard definition of a conjugacy class.\n\n    4.  Thus, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type E8, denoted W(E8).\n\n    5.  The group W(E8) is a large finite group of order 696,729,600. The number of its conjugacy classes has been\n        determined using computational group theory and is a well-known result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W(E8) is a known value.\n    num_tori = 112\n\n    # We present the logic as a series of equalities.\n    print(\"Let N be the number of Fq-rational maximal tori of a group of type E8.\")\n    print(\"N = (Number of F-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group W(E8))\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFor E8, the Frobenius action F is trivial, so F-conjugacy is the same as ordinary conjugacy.\")\n    print(\"N = (Number of conjugacy classes in W(E8))\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThis number has been computed and is a known result in group theory.\")\n    print(f\"Number of conjugacy classes in W(E8) = {num_tori}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the exact number of Fq-rational maximal tori is:\")\n    print(f\"N = {num_tori}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_e8_tori_count()\n\n```\n<<<112>>>"
