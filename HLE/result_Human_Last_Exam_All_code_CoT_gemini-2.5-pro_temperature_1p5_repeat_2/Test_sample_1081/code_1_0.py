def solve_e8_tori_count():
    """
    This function determines the number of Fq-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G of type E8.

    The theoretical foundation for this solution is as follows:
    1.  The number of Fq-rational maximal tori in a reductive group G over a finite field Fq (up to G(Fq)-conjugacy)
        is equal to the number of F-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group W.
        The Frobenius endomorphism F acts on W. An F-conjugacy class containing an element w from W is the set
        {x * w * F(x)^(-1) for all x in W}.

    2.  For a group G of type E8, the Dynkin diagram has a trivial automorphism group. A key consequence is that
        any such group over a finite field is 'split', and the associated Frobenius endomorphism F acts trivially on
        the Weyl group W.

    3.  When the action of F is trivial, F(x) = x for all x in W. The formula for an F-conjugacy class simplifies to
        {x * w * x^(-1) for all x in W}, which is the standard definition of a conjugacy class.

    4.  Thus, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type E8, denoted W(E8).

    5.  The group W(E8) is a large finite group of order 696,729,600. The number of its conjugacy classes has been
        determined using computational group theory and is a well-known result.
