    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization of N**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n2.  **Structure of Primitive Characters**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N = p_1^{k_1} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character with conductor $p_i^{k_i}$.\n    In our case, $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a primitive character modulo $p^k$.\n\n3.  **Order of the Character**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n    We require this order to be 6.\n\n4.  **Counting Primitive Characters of Specific Order**: For the lcm to be 6, the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^k})$, must be a divisor of 6. We need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime power conductor $p^k$ for orders $d$ that divide 6. The number of primitive characters of conductor $m$ and order $d$ is denoted by $N_m(d)$.\n\n    *   **Conductor $4 = 2^2$**: Primitive characters have orders that divide $\\phi(4)=2$ but not $\\phi(2)=1$. So the only possible order is 2. The number of such characters is $N_4(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   **Conductor $9 = 3^2$**: Primitive characters have orders that divide $\\phi(9)=6$ but not $\\phi(3)=2$. The possible orders are 3 and 6. The number of characters are $N_9(3) = \\phi(3)=2$ and $N_9(6) = \\phi(6)=2$.\n    *   **Conductor $7$**: All non-principal characters are primitive. Their orders must divide $\\phi(7)=6$. The possible orders are 2, 3, 6. The numbers are $N_7(2)=\\phi(2)=1$, $N_7(3)=\\phi(3)=2$, $N_7(6)=\\phi(6)=2$.\n    *   **Conductor $11$**: Orders must divide $\\phi(11)=10$ and also 6. Thus, orders must divide $\\text{gcd}(10,6)=2$. The only possible primitive order is 2. $N_{11}(2)=\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   **Conductor $13$**: Orders must divide $\\phi(13)=12$ and also 6. Thus, orders must divide $\\text{gcd}(12,6)=6$. The possible primitive orders are 2, 3, 6. The numbers are $N_{13}(2)=\\phi(2)=1$, $N_{13}(3)=\\phi(3)=2$, $N_{13}(6)=\\phi(6)=2$.\n\n5.  **Combining the Counts**: Let $d_{p^k} = \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^k})$. We need $\\text{lcm}(d_4, d_9, d_7, d_{11}, d_{13}) = 6$.\n    From our analysis, $d_4=2$ (1 choice) and $d_{11}=2$ (1 choice). The lcm is thus $\\text{lcm}(2, d_9, d_7, 2, d_{13}) = \\text{lcm}(d_9, d_7, d_{13})$.\n    We need to count the number of combinations of characters $(\\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{13})$ such that $\\text{lcm}(d_9, d_7, d_{13}) = 6$. The allowed orders are $d_9 \\in \\{3,6\\}$, $d_7 \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$, $d_{13} \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$.\n\n    We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of combinations where all orders divide 6 is subtracted by the combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., lcm divides 2 or 3).\n\n    *   Total choices for $(\\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{13})$ with orders dividing 6:\n        *   Choices for $\\chi_9$: $N_9(3) + N_9(6) = 2+2=4$.\n        *   Choices for $\\chi_7$: $N_7(2) + N_7(3) + N_7(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\n        *   Choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $N_{13}(2) + N_{13}(3) + N_{13}(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\n        *   Total = $4 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n    *   Choices where lcm divides 3 (all orders must divide 3):\n        *   Choices for $\\chi_9$ (order 3): $N_9(3)=2$.\n        *   Choices for $\\chi_7$ (order 3): $N_7(3)=2$.\n        *   Choices for $\\chi_{13}$ (order 3): $N_{13}(3)=2$.\n        *   Total = $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\n    *   Choices where lcm divides 2 (all orders must divide 2):\n        *   Choices for $\\chi_9$: order must divide 2, but possible orders are {3, 6}. So, 0 choices.\n        *   Total = 0.\n\n    The number of combinations for $(\\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{13})$ giving an lcm of 6 is $100 - 8 - 0 = 92$.\n    The final answer is the product of the number of choices for each component: $N_4(2) \\times N_{11}(2) \\times 92 = 1 \\times 1 \\times 92 = 92$.\n\nThe Python code below implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    print(f\"The conductor is N = {N}.\")\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of N is 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13.\\n\")\n\n    # Number of primitive characters for each component conductor and relevant order d\n    # N_m(d) = phi(d) under the right conditions\n    n4_2 = phi(2)\n    \n    n9_3 = phi(3)\n    n9_6 = phi(6)\n    \n    n7_2 = phi(2)\n    n7_3 = phi(3)\n    n7_6 = phi(6)\n    \n    n11_2 = phi(2)\n    \n    n13_2 = phi(2)\n    n13_3 = phi(3)\n    n13_6 = phi(6)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the number of choices for each primitive character component.\")\n    print(f\"For conductor 4, ord=2: N_4(2) = phi(2) = {n4_2}\")\n    print(f\"For conductor 11, ord=2: N_11(2) = phi(2) = {n11_2}\\n\")\n\n    # Total number of choices for characters from conductors 9, 7, 13 whose orders divide 6\n    c9_div6 = n9_3 + n9_6\n    c7_div6 = n7_2 + n7_3 + n7_6\n    c13_div6 = n13_2 + n13_3 + n13_6\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate combinations for conductors 9, 7, and 13 where the order divides 6.\")\n    print(f\"Choices for mod 9 (ord in {{3,6}}): N_9(3) + N_9(6) = {n9_3} + {n9_6} = {c9_div6}\")\n    print(f\"Choices for mod 7 (ord in {{2,3,6}}): N_7(2) + N_7(3) + N_7(6) = {n7_2} + {n7_3} + {n7_6} = {c7_div6}\")\n    print(f\"Choices for mod 13 (ord in {{2,3,6}}): N_13(2) + N_13(3) + N_13(6) = {n13_2} + {n13_3} + {n13_6} = {c13_div6}\")\n\n    total_div6 = c9_div6 * c7_div6 * c13_div6\n    print(f\"Total combinations where individual orders divide 6: {c9_div6} * {c7_div6} * {c13_div6} = {total_div6}\\n\")\n    \n    # Number of combinations where the lcm divides 3\n    lcm3_count = n9_3 * n7_3 * n13_3\n    print(\"Step 3: Subtract combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 3).\")\n    print(f\"Combinations where lcm divides 3 (all orders are 3): N_9(3)*N_7(3)*N_13(3) = {n9_3}*{n7_3}*{n13_3} = {lcm3_count}\")\n    print(\"(Combinations where lcm divides 2 is 0 as there are no primitive characters mod 9 of order 2.)\\n\")\n    \n    # Using inclusion-exclusion for the (9, 7, 13) part\n    count_9_7_13 = total_div6 - lcm3_count\n    \n    # Final total\n    final_result = n4_2 * n11_2 * count_9_7_13\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Final calculation.\")\n    final_equation = f\"Total = N_4(2) * N_11(2) * ( (N_9(3)+N_9(6)) * (N_7(2)+N_7(3)+N_7(6)) * (N_13(2)+N_13(3)+N_13(6)) - (N_9(3)*N_7(3)*N_13(3)) )\"\n    print(final_equation)\n    final_values = f\"Total = {n4_2} * {n11_2} * ( ({n9_3}+{n9_6}) * ({n7_2}+{n7_3}+{n7_6}) * ({n13_2}+{n13_3}+{n13_6}) - ({n9_3}*{n7_3}*{n13_3}) )\"\n    print(final_values)\n    intermediate1 = f\"Total = {n4_2} * {n11_2} * ( {c9_div6} * {c7_div6} * {c13_div6} - {lcm3_count} )\"\n    print(intermediate1)\n    intermediate2 = f\"Total = {n4_2} * {n11_2} * ( {total_div6} - {lcm3_count} )\"\n    print(intermediate2)\n    intermediate3 = f\"Total = {n4_2} * {n11_2} * {count_9_7_13}\"\n    print(intermediate3)\n    final_line = f\"Total = {final_result}\"\n    print(final_line)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<92>>>"
