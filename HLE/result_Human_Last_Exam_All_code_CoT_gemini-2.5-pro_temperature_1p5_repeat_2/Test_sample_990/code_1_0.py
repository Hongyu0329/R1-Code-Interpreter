def solve_raindrop_fall():
    """
    Calculates the time it takes for a raindrop accumulating mass to fall.
    
    The solution is based on the following derivation:
    1.  The equation of motion for the raindrop with variable mass m(t) is F = d(p)/dt.
        The net force is gravity, F = m*g.
        The change in momentum is d(m*v)/dt = m*(dv/dt) + v*(dm/dt).
        This gives m*g = m*a + v*(dm/dt), or a = g - (v/m)*(dm/dt).

    2.  The mass increases as it sweeps through a cloud of density Rho.
        dm/dt = Rho * Area * v = Rho * pi * r^2 * v.
        The mass of the spherical drop is m = rho * (4/3) * pi * r^3.

    3.  Assuming the drop starts with negligible initial mass (m0 -> 0), the acceleration
        can be shown to be constant. The dependencies on v, r, rho, and Rho cancel out,
        yielding a = g / 7.

    4.  With constant acceleration, we use the kinematic equation H = (1/2)*a*t^2.
        Solving for time t gives: t = sqrt(2*H/a).
