    print("Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH): When a cell that has two different alleles (is heterozygous, e.g., 'Aa') for a gene loses one of the alleles, becoming homozygous (e.g., 'AA' or 'aa').")
    print("Copy-Neutral: The total number of chromosomes or chromosomal segments remains the same. For a diploid organism, this means retaining two copies of the relevant chromosome.")
    print("Goal: Find the mechanism that causes LOH *without* changing the total chromosome copy number (i.e., it is copy-neutral).\n")

    print("--- Evaluating Options ---")

    # Option A
    print("A. Mitotic recombination:")
    print("   - This event can cause daughter cells to become homozygous for genes that were heterozygous in the parent cell.")
    print("   - The cells remain diploid (e.g., have two copies of the chromosome).")
    print("   - Result: This is a mechanism for copy-neutral LOH. It is a plausible answer.")

    # Option B
    print("\nB. A deletion of a chromosomal region:")
    print("   - Deleting the part of the chromosome containing one allele causes LOH.")
    print("   - However, this results in a net loss of genetic material.")
    print("   - Result: This is NOT copy-neutral. Incorrect.")

    # Option C
    print("\nC. Trisomy:")
    print("   - This is the presence of an extra chromosome (e.g., three copies instead of two).")
    print("   - This is a copy number GAIN.")
    print("   - Result: This is NOT copy-neutral. Incorrect.")

    # Option D
    print("\nD. Uniparental disomy (UPD):")
    print("   - This is a state where an individual inherits two copies of a chromosome from one parent and no copy from the other.")
    print("   - The total copy number is two (disomy), so the cell is copy-neutral.")
    print("   - If the parent was heterozygous for a gene on that chromosome, inheriting two copies of the same parental chromosome results in LOH.")
    print("   - Result: This perfectly fits the definition of copy-neutral LOH. It is the best and most direct answer.")

    # Option E
    print("\nE. Duplication of a chromosomal region:")
    print("   - This results in extra copies of a gene or chromosomal segment.")
    print("   - This is a copy number GAIN.")
    print("   - Result: This is NOT copy-neutral. Incorrect.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Both Mitotic Recombination (A) and Uniparental Disomy (D) can cause copy-neutral LOH. However, Uniparental Disomy is the term that most precisely describes the state of having a normal number of chromosomes (copy-neutral) that originate from a single parent, which is a classic mechanism for LOH across an entire chromosome. Therefore, it is the most fitting answer.")
