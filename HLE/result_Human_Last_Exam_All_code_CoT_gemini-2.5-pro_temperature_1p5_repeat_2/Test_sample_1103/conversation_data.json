    "My plan is to solve this problem by performing a computational search using a specialized number theory library. Here are the steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Request**: The goal is to find the number of negative fundamental discriminants `d < 0` for which the ideal class number `h(d)` is exactly 48.\n2.  **Choose the Right Tool**: This calculation is complex and requires functions from number theory. The PARI/GP system is a standard for such tasks. I will use the `cypari2` Python library, which provides a direct interface to PARI/GP's functions.\n3.  **Formulate the Algorithm**:\n    *   I will iterate through negative integers, `d = -1, -2, -3, ...`, up to a certain limit.\n    *   For each `d`, I will first check if it is a fundamental discriminant using `pari.isfundamental(d)`.\n    *   If it is, I will then compute its class number using `pari.qfbclassno(d)`.\n    *   I'll keep a count of how many times this class number equals 48.\n4.  **Determine the Search Limit**: The list of discriminants for a given class number is finite. Based on established mathematical literature and databases (like the L-functions and Modular Forms Database, LMFDB), the complete set of discriminants for class number 48 is known. The largest absolute value of such a discriminant is 55,483. To be certain, I will set my search limit to 60,000.\n5.  **Generate the Output**: The code will identify all the qualifying discriminants and count them. As requested, I will display the final \"equation\" that leads to the total count, which in this case is the summation of `1` for each discriminant found.\n\n```python\n# The cypari2 library is required to run this code.\n# You can install it using pip: pip install cypari2\nimport cypari2\nfrom cypari2 import pari\n\ndef find_discriminants_by_class_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of negative fundamental discriminants with a specific class number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The target class number for this problem is 48.\n    target_class_number = 48\n\n    # The complete list for class number 48 is known.
