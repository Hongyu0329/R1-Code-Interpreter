    "To determine the rule activation level of a fuzzy rule, we need to combine the membership degrees of its antecedent parts (the \"IF\" part of the rule) using a t-norm operation, which is a form of fuzzy `AND`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Inputs:** The problem provides two values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. We will treat these as two membership values from the antecedent of a fuzzy rule.\n2.  **Choose a T-Norm:** A t-norm is a function that models a fuzzy `AND`. There are several types of t-norms, such as the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm. Since the specific t-norm is not specified, I will use the most common one: the **minimum t-norm**.\n3.  **Calculate the Activation Level:** I will apply the minimum function to the two input values. The activation level will be `min(0.7, 0.9)`.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the full equation along with the result, as requested.\n\n```python\n# Define the given membership values from the problem statement.\nphi_val = 0.7\nmu_val = 0.9\n\n# The rule activation level is calculated by applying a t-norm to the antecedent\n# membership values. We will use the minimum t-norm, which is the most common choice.\n# The calculation is the minimum of the two provided values.\nactivation_level = min(phi_val, mu_val)\n\n# Print the final result, showing the full equation as requested.\nprint(f\"The problem is to find the rule activation level using a t-norm on {phi_val} and {mu_val}.\")\nprint(f\"Using the minimum t-norm, the calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"min({phi_val}, {mu_val}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
