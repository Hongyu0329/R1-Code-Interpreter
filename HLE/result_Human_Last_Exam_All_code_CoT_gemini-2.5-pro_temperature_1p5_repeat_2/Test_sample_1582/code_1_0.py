    print("The question is whether we can conclude that the Markov chain is not positive recurrent given the following properties:")
    print("1. It's an irreducible Markov chain on a countable state space Sigma.")
    print("2. There is a finite set A, and a non-negative function f such that:")
    print("   a) For all x not in A, Sum_y(p(x,y)*f(y)) - f(x) >= 0.")
    print("   b) f(x) -> infinity as x -> infinity.")
    print("\nThe final answer is YES, one can conclude from this that the Markov chain is not positive recurrent.")
    print("\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning (a proof by contradiction):\n")

    print("Step 1: Assume for the sake of contradiction that the chain IS positive recurrent.")
    print("An irreducible and positive recurrent Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution, let's call it pi, such that pi(x) > 0 for all states x and Sum_x(pi(x)) = 1.")

    print("\nStep 2: Use a fundamental property of the stationary distribution.")
    print("If a chain is in its stationary distribution, the expected value of any function of its state does not change from one step to the next.")
    print("Let's define the transition operator P acting on a function g as (Pg)(x) = Sum_y(p(x,y)*g(y)).")
    print("The stationarity of pi implies: Sum_x(pi(x) * (Pf)(x)) = Sum_x(pi(x) * f(x)).")
    print("This can be rewritten into the following final equation:")
    print("    Sum_{x in Sigma} pi(x) * [ (Sum_{y in Sigma} p(x,y)f(y)) - f(x) ] = 0")
    print("This identity holds because all terms are non-negative, by Tonelli's theorem.")


    print("\nStep 3: Split the sum over the set A and its complement A^c (all states not in A).")
    print("Sum_{x in A} pi(x) * [(Pf)(x) - f(x)] + Sum_{x not in A} pi(x) * [(Pf)(x) - f(x)] = 0.")

    print("\nStep 4: Apply the condition given in the problem statement.")
    print("The problem states that for all x not in A, (Pf)(x) - f(x) >= 0.")
    print("Since pi(x) is also positive, each term in the second sum, Sum_{x not in A} pi(x) * [(Pf)(x) - f(x)], is non-negative.")
    print("Therefore, the entire second sum must be greater than or equal to 0.")

    print("\nStep 5: Deduce necessary consequences for both parts of the sum.")
    print("For the total sum to be 0, and with the second part being non-negative, two conditions must be met:")
    print("  a) The first sum, over A, must be non-positive.")
    print("  b) In fact, both sums must be exactly zero. This is because a non-positive part plus a non-negative part can only sum to zero if both are zero.")

    print("\nStep 6: Analyze the implication of the sums being zero.")
    print("Let's focus on the sum over states not in A: Sum_{x not in A} pi(x) * [(Pf)(x) - f(x)] = 0.")
    print("This is a sum of non-negative terms that equals zero. This is only possible if every single term is zero.")
    print("Since pi(x) > 0 for all x (due to irreducibility), it must be that [(Pf)(x) - f(x)] = 0 for all x not in A.")
    print("This means the function f is a 'harmonic' function on the set of states outside the finite set A.")

    print("\nStep 7: The Contradiction.")
    print("We have now established that if the chain is positive recurrent, f must be a non-negative harmonic function outside the finite set A.")
    print("However, a fundamental result in the theory of Markov chains (a Liouville-type theorem for recurrent chains) states that any non-negative function that is harmonic everywhere except for a finite set of states must be a bounded function.")
    print("This directly contradicts the second given condition, which is that f(x) -> infinity as x -> infinity. This condition explicitly states that f is an unbounded function.")

    print("\nStep 8: Final Conclusion.")
    print("The deduction in Step 7 is a logical contradiction. Therefore, the initial assumption made in Step 1 must be false.")
    print("The conclusion is that the Markov chain cannot be positive recurrent.")
