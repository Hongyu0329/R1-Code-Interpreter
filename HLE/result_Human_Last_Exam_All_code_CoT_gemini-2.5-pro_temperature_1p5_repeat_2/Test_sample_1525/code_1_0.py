    This function analyzes the five statements provided in the problem description
    and counts how many of them are correct.

    Statement Analysis:
    A. Correct. The "order of appearance" for constants in a Datalog program (which is a set of rules) is not well-defined, making the segregation process ambiguous.
    B. Incorrect. It misrepresents the central claim and its reasoning about the non-uniqueness of recovering the original program via aggregation is flawed. By definition, γ reverses the substitutions made by γ⁻¹.
    C. Correct. Aggregation (γ) can be a lossy operation. If γ(b) = a and γ(d) = a, then for P = {p(b).}, γ[P] = {p(a).}. Segregating this, γ⁻¹[γ[P]], could result in {p(b)., p(d).}, which is not identical to the original P.
    D. Correct. Similar to statement A, it correctly points out that the recursive definition for segregation (γ⁻¹) is ambiguous, which affects the overall claim's interpretation.
    E. Correct. This is an accurate high-level interpretation of the mathematical claim. It correctly frames the claim as a statement about the equivalence of computation at a coarse-grained level versus a "refine-compute-coarsen" path.

    The correct statements are A, C, D, and E.
    The total count of correct statements is 4.
