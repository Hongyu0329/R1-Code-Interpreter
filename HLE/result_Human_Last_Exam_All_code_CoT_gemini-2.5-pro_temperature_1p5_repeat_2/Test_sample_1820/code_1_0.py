# Let's calculate this value.
# The term ln(b) represents the information content at each branching point in the hierarchy.
# Dividing by the depth 'd' normalizes this measure, representing the average
# information preserved per level when mapping from a structure with mergeable siblings
# to a strict categorical one.
completeness_bound = math.log(b) / d
