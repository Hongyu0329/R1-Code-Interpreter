    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, the character who has lived among the Romans and describes their foundation myth is **Otter**.\n\nIn Chapter IV, \"They Talk of the Romans,\" Otter, a man who was once enslaved by them, recounts their origin story to the other Goths. He describes the Romans as a \"people of the city\" and explains their myth in a way that clearly refers to Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf:\n\n\"...they have a tale that their first fathers, who built their first wall, were not men-suckled, but wolf-suckled: and it is a token of their lives; for they are not as men, but as wolves devouring the world...\"\n\nThis question is about literary analysis and does not require a code solution.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
