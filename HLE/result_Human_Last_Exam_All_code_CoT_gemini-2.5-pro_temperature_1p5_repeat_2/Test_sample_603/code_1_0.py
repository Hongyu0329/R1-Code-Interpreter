    explanation = """
    The question asks for a fundamental limitation of studying nucleic acid (NA) thermodynamics using bulk melting experiments. The key is understanding what a "bulk" experiment entails and how it affects the data obtained.

    Step-by-Step Analysis:
    1.  A bulk experiment, such as calorimetry or UV-spectroscopy on an NA solution, measures the average properties of a massive population of molecules (an ensemble). The resulting data, like a melting curve, represents the collective behavior of all molecules.

    2.  The term "heterogeneity" refers to the differences in structure or behavior among individual molecules within that population. For instance, at a given temperature, some DNA duplexes might be fully intact, some might be frayed at the ends, and others might have internal "bubbles." These different states and the pathways between them are masked in a bulk experiment.

    3.  The experiment measures the total signal (e.g., total heat absorbed), which averages out all these individual molecular differences into one smooth transition. It is therefore impossible to distinguish or "capture" the underlying molecular heterogeneity. This is a fundamental limitation of the technique.

    4.  Other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
        *   (A) and (B) describe simplifications or assumptions of the thermodynamic *model* used to interpret the data, not a limitation of the experimental *method* itself. Advanced models can incorporate these effects.
        *   (D) and (E) are factually incorrect claims about the capabilities of modern scientific instruments, which allow for very precise temperature control and measurement.

    Therefore, the primary limitation inherent to the bulk method is its inability to resolve the behavior of individual molecules within the population.
