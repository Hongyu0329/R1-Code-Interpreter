    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we will use the Schwarzschild metric in spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the Metric:** The metric is the Schwarzschild metric, which is diagonal. Its non-zero components are $g_{00}$, $g_{11}$, $g_{22}$, and $g_{33}$.\n2.  **Analyze Dependencies:** The components of the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ depend only on the coordinates $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$).\n    *   $g_{00}$ and $g_{11}$ depend only on $r$.\n    *   $g_{22}$ depends only on $r$.\n    *   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ and $\\theta$.\n    *   No component depends on $t$ ($x^0$) or $\\phi$ ($x^3$).\n3.  **Christoffel Symbol Formula:** The Christoffel symbols are calculated using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n4.  **Simplification:** Since the metric is diagonal, $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is only non-zero if $\\rho = \\sigma$. Also, a derivative of a metric component $\\frac{\\partial g_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial x^\\gamma}$ can only be non-zero if $g_{\\alpha\\beta}$ depends on $x^\\gamma$. For our diagonal metric, this means $\\alpha=\\beta$ and $x^\\gamma$ is one of the dependencies for $g_{\\alpha\\alpha}$.\n5.  **Coding Approach:** We can write a Python script to systematically check all 64 possible Christoffel symbols ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ for $\\rho,\\mu,\\nu \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$). The script will determine if a symbol is non-zero based on the dependencies of the metric components, without needing their exact functional form. The script will then print the list of all non-zero symbols and their total count.\n\nThis method avoids complex symbolic algebra by reducing the problem to a logical check of indices and dependencies.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for a Schwarzschild metric.\n\n    The coordinates are indexed as 0:t, 1:r, 2:theta, 3:phi.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define which coordinates the diagonal metric components g_ii depend on.\n    # g_00(r), g_11(r), g_22(r), g_33(r, theta)\n    g_dependencies = {\n        0: {1},  # g_00 depends on r (index 1)\n        1: {1},  # g_11 depends on r (index 1)\n        2: {1},  # g_22 depends on r (index 1)\n        3: {1, 2}  # g_33 depends on r (index 1) and theta (index 2)\n    }\n\n    def is_derivative_nonzero(mu, nu, k):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if the derivative of g_mu,nu with respect to x^k is non-zero.\n        For a diagonal metric, this requires mu == nu.\n        \"\"\"\n        if mu != nu:\n            return False\n        return k in g_dependencies.get(mu, set())\n\n    non_zero_symbols = []\n    \n    # Iterate through all 4*4*4 = 64 possible Christoffel symbols\n    indices = range(4)\n    for rho, mu, nu in itertools.product(indices, repeat=3):\n        # Christoffel symbol formula for a diagonal metric:\n        # Gamma^rho_mu,nu = 0.5 * g^rho,rho * (d_nu(g_rho,mu) + d_mu(g_rho,nu) - d_rho(g_mu,nu))\n        # For the parenthesis term to be non-zero, at least one derivative must be non-zero.\n        \n        # We model the sum of derivatives.
