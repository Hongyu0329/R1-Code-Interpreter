    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression and then calculate `log_2(n)`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Expression**: The expression is complex. We will parse it into its constituent parts. The standard syntax for SKI combinators is that application is left-associative, so `A(B)(C)` is parsed as `((A B) C)`.\n2.  **Evaluate Sub-Expressions**: We'll identify and evaluate the key sub-expressions, which are Church numerals or operations on them. The fundamental Church numerals are represented by functions `c_n = λf.λx. f^n(x)`.\n    *   `B = S(KS)K` is the function composition combinator.\n    *   `succ = S B` is the successor function, where `succ(n) = n+1`.\n    *   `I` is the identity combinator, representing Church numeral `1`.\n    *   We will evaluate the sub-expressions `X` and `Y`.\n3.  **Reduce the Main Expression**: We will reduce the full expression by applying it to a generic function `f` and argument `x`. This will show how the different parts combine to form the final Church numeral `n`.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**: Once `n` is found, we will calculate `log_2(n)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Expression**\n\n    Let the entire expression be `E`.\n    `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(X)))(Y)))`\n\n    Where:\n    *   `X = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n    *   `Y = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\n    The structure of `E` is nested application. Let's analyze its reduction when applied to `f` and `x`.\n    `E f x = (S I (...)) f x = I f ((...) f) x = f ((...) f x)`\n    Applying this repeatedly, we get:\n    `E f x = f(f(((S I (K X)) Y) f x))`\n    Let's analyze the inner part `E_2 = (S I (K X)) Y`.\n    `S I (K X)` applied to an argument `g` gives `I g ((K X) g) = g(X)`.\n    So, `E_2 = (S I (K X)) Y = Y(X)`, which means Church numeral `Y` applied to Church numeral `X`.\n    Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n    `E f x = f(f((Y X) f x))`\n\n2.  **Evaluating X and Y**\n\n    *   First, let's identify the combinators:\n        *   The composition combinator `B` is `S(KS)K`. `B g h z = g(h z)`.\n        *   The successor combinator `succ` is `S(B)`. `succ(n) f x = f(n f x)`, so `succ(n) = n+1`.\n        *   The expression contains `S(S(K(S))(K))`, which is `S(B)` or `succ`.\n\n    *   **Evaluate X**:\n        `X = S(B)(I) = succ(I)`\n        The identity combinator `I` is equivalent to the Church numeral `1` (`I f x = f x = f^1 x`).\n        So, `X = succ(1) = 2`.\n\n    *   **Evaluate Y**:\n        `Y = S(B)(S(I)(I)) = succ(S(I)(I))`\n        The sub-expression `M = S(I)(I)` is the mockingbird combinator. Let's see what numeral it represents:\n        `M f x = S I I f x = I f (I f) x = f(f x) = f^2 x`.\n        So, `M` is the Church numeral `2`.\n        Therefore, `Y = succ(M) = succ(2) = 3`.\n\n3.  **Reducing the Main Expression**\n\n    *   Now we evaluate `E_2 = Y(X)`. This is the application of Church numeral `Y=3` to `X=2`. In lambda calculus, `m n` represents exponentiation `n^m`. So `Y(X)` represents `X^Y`.\n    *   `E_2 = X^Y = 2^3 = 8`.\n\n    *   We substitute this back into the expression for `E`:\n        `E f x = f(f((E_2) f x)) = f(f((8) f x))`\n        `E f x = f(f(f^8 x)) = f^{1+1+8} x = f^{10} x`.\n\n    *   So, the expression `E` represents the Church numeral `n=10`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**\n\n    *   The problem asks for `log_2(n)`.\n    *   `n = 10`.\n    *   `log_2(10)`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the components based on the derivation.\n# X represents the Church numeral 2.\nX = 2\nprint(f\"The sub-expression X evaluates to the Church numeral: {X}\")\n\n# Y represents the Church numeral 3.\nY = 3\nprint(f\"The sub-expression Y evaluates to the Church numeral: {Y}\")\n\n# Step 2: Evaluate the inner part of the expression E_2 = Y(X).\n# Application of Church numeral Y to X (written Y(X)) corresponds to exponentiation X^Y.\n# In our case, this is 2^3.\nE_2 = X**Y\nprint(f\"The inner expression E_2 = Y(X) evaluates to X^Y = {X}^{Y} = {E_2}\")\n\n# Step 3: Evaluate the full expression n.\n# The structure of the full expression corresponds to addition: n = 2 + E_2.\nn = 2 + E_2\nprint(f\"The full expression represents the Church numeral n = 2 + {E_2} = {n}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final result, log_2(n).\nresult = math.log2(n)\nprint(f\"The problem asks for log_2(n).\")\nprint(f\"log_2({n}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<3.3219280948873626>>>"
