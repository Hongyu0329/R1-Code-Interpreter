# Step 1: Define the components based on the derivation.
# X represents the Church numeral 2.
X = 2
print(f"The sub-expression X evaluates to the Church numeral: {X}")

# Y represents the Church numeral 3.
Y = 3
print(f"The sub-expression Y evaluates to the Church numeral: {Y}")

# Step 2: Evaluate the inner part of the expression E_2 = Y(X).
# Application of Church numeral Y to X (written Y(X)) corresponds to exponentiation X^Y.
# In our case, this is 2^3.
E_2 = X**Y
print(f"The inner expression E_2 = Y(X) evaluates to X^Y = {X}^{Y} = {E_2}")

# Step 3: Evaluate the full expression n.
# The structure of the full expression corresponds to addition: n = 2 + E_2.
n = 2 + E_2
print(f"The full expression represents the Church numeral n = 2 + {E_2} = {n}")

# Step 4: Calculate the final result, log_2(n).
result = math.log2(n)
print(f"The problem asks for log_2(n).")
print(f"log_2({n}) = {result}")
