    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  I will first acknowledge the provided 3x3 matrix `A`. The term `m_{1/2} = 13` appears to be contextual information that is not required for the direct calculation of the determinant of the matrix `A` as it is explicitly given.\n2.  I will use Python and its `NumPy` library to perform the matrix operations.\n3.  The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be found using the expansion formula:\n    `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)` for a matrix `[[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]`.\n4.  My Python script will show the step-by-step process of this calculation as requested. It will:\n    *   Define the matrix `A`.\n    *   Print the formula for the determinant.\n    *   Substitute each element of `A` into the formula and print this expanded equation.\n    *   Print the intermediate steps of the calculation.\n    *   Finally, print the computed determinant.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_determinant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the step-by-step determinant calculation \n    for the given 3x3 matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The matrix A is the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver.\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    # Extract elements to display them in the formula for clarity.\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    print(f\"The given matrix A is:\\n{A}\\n\")\n\n    # The user wants to see the numbers in the final equation. We will build it step-by-step.\n    print(\"The determinant is calculated using the standard formula for a 3x3 matrix:\")\n    print(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Substitute the numbers into the formula.\n    print(\"Step 1: Substitute the values from matrix A into the formula.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses (the minors).\n    minor1 = e * i - f * h\n    minor2 = d * i - f * g\n    minor3 = d * h - e * g\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({a})*({minor1}) - ({b})*({minor2}) + ({c})*({minor3})\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Perform the multiplications.\n    term1 = a * minor1\n    # Note the formula has -b, so we apply the sign here.\n    term2 = -b * minor2\n    term3 = c * minor3\n    print(\"Step 3: Perform the multiplications to get the terms of the sum.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {term1} + ({term2}) + ({term3})\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Sum the terms to find the final determinant.\n    determinant = term1 + term2 + term3\n    print(\"Step 4: Sum the terms to find the final result.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {determinant}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Thus, the determinant of the adjacency matrix is {determinant}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    compute_determinant()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
