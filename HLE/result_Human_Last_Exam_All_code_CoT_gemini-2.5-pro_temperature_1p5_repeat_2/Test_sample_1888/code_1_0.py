# This script formalizes the solution to the set theory problem.

# Step 1: Determine gamma (γ).
# γ is the cofinality of the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers, let's call it c.
# The problem states that c = 2^ω is singular and c < Aleph_{omega_2}.
# As c is a cardinal, we can write c = Aleph_α for some ordinal α.
# The condition c < Aleph_{omega_2} means α < ω₂.
# The cofinality of c is then γ = cf(c) = cf(Aleph_α) = cf(α).
# Since α < ω₂, its cardinality is at most Aleph_1, which means cf(α) must be an ordinal less than or equal to ω₁.
# The regular ordinals less than or equal to ω₁ are ω and ω₁. So, γ must be ω or ω₁.
# However, a key theorem of ZFC states that the cofinality of 2^ω must be strictly greater than ω (i.e., cf(2^ω) > ω).
# Combining these facts, γ must be ω₁.
gamma_str = "omega_1"

# Step 2: Determine delta (δ).
# δ is the order type of X, the set of possible cardinalities for c.
# The problem statement begins by "supposing" a scenario with specific conditions on c.
# Within this supposed scenario, c is treated as a single, fixed cardinal.
# Therefore, the "set of possible cardinalities" for c in this context is just the set containing that single value, X = {c}.
# A set with a single element is well-ordered and has an order type of 1.
# Thus, δ = 1.
delta_val = 1

# Step 3: Calculate the ordinal sum δ + γ.
# We need to compute 1 + ω₁.
# In ordinal arithmetic, adding a finite ordinal 'n' to a left-infinite limit ordinal 'λ' results in λ.
# Formally, n + λ = λ.
# Since ω₁ is an infinite limit ordinal, we have 1 + ω₁ = ω₁.
result_str = "omega_1"

# Step 4: Print the final equation with each number.

print(f"delta = {delta_val}")
print(f"gamma = {gamma_str}")
print(f"The ordinal sum is: {delta_val} + {gamma_str} = {result_str}")
