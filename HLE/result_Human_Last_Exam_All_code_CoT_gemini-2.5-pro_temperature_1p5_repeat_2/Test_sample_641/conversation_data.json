    "This problem requires finding the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997). An involution is an element of order 2.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties**: The group is G = PSU(n, q) with n = 4 and q = 997. Since q is an odd prime, the characteristic of the underlying field is not 2.\n2.  **Relate Involutions in PSU to SU**: The group PSU(n, q) is the quotient of the special unitary group SU(n, q) by its center, Z(SU(n, q)). An element `gZ` in PSU is an involution if `(gZ)^2` is the identity element, which means `g^2` must be in the center Z.\n3.  **Characterize the Center**: For SU(n, q), the center Z consists of scalar matrices `ωI` such that `ω^n = 1` and `ω^(q+1) = 1`. For our case (n=4, q=997), the size of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. Thus, the center is `Z = {I, -I}`.\n4.  **Identify Preimages of Involutions**: We need to count the elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`. These elements form the preimages of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n5.  **Count Conjugacy Classes**: The elements `g` satisfying the conditions fall into distinct conjugacy classes in SU(4, 997). We will find the sizes of these classes.\n    *   **Case 1: `g^2 = I` (Involutions in SU)**. For n=4, the non-identity involutions are all conjugate to a matrix with eigenvalues {1, 1, -1, -1}. The centralizer of such an element allows us to calculate the size of this conjugacy class.\n    *   **Case 2: `g^2 = -I`**. For n=4, these elements are all conjugate to a block-diagonal matrix `diag(J, J)` where `J = [[0, -1], [1, 0]]`. The centralizer of such an element is isomorphic to the symplectic group `Sp(4, q)`. This allows calculating the size of this conjugacy class.\n6.  **Count Involutions in PSU**: The images of these conjugacy classes in PSU are the conjugacy classes of involutions. The total number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these classes.\n    *   The size of the class from Case 1 is `q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`.\n    *   The size of the class from Case 2 is `q^2 * (q^3 + 1)`.\n7.  **Final Calculation**: The total number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is the sum of these two quantities. We will compute this value for q = 997 using a Python script.\n\nThe final formula for the number of involutions is:\n`N = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1) + q^2 * (q^3 + 1)`\n\nNow, let's implement the calculation in Python.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # Calculate powers of q\n    q2 = q**2\n    q3 = q**3\n    q4 = q**4\n\n    # Calculate factors for the first term\n    term1_factor1 = q2 - q + 1\n    term1_factor2 = q2 + 1\n    \n    # Calculate the first term\n    term1 = q4 * term1_factor1 * term1_factor2\n\n    # Calculate factors for the second term\n    term2_factor1 = q3 + 1\n    \n    # Calculate the second term\n    term2 = q2 * term2_factor1\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of involutions\n    total_involutions = term1 + term2\n\n    # Print the step-by-step evaluation of the formula\n    print(\"The formula for the number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is:\")\n    print(\"N = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1) + q^2 * (q^3 + 1)\")\n    print(\"\\nFor q = 997:\")\n    print(f\"N = {q}^4 * ({q}^2 - {q} + 1) * ({q}^2 + 1) + {q}^2 * ({q}^3 + 1)\")\n    print(\"\\nEvaluating the powers of q:\")\n    print(f\"q^2 = {q2}\")\n    print(f\"q^3 = {q3}\")\n    print(f\"q^4 = {q4}\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"N = {q4} * ({q2} - {q} + 1) * ({q2} + 1) + {q2} * ({q3} + 1)\")\n    print(\"\\nEvaluating the expressions in parentheses:\")\n    print(f\"N = {q4} * ({term1_factor1}) * ({term1_factor2}) + {q2} * ({term2_factor1})\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the two main terms:\")\n    print(f\"First term  = {q4} * {term1_factor1} * {term1_factor2} = {term1}\")\n    print(f\"Second term = {q2} * {term2_factor1} = {term2}\")\n    print(\"\\nAdding the two terms to get the final result:\")\n    print(f\"Total number of involutions = {term1} + {term2} = {total_involutions}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<976295286469291874187036>>>"
