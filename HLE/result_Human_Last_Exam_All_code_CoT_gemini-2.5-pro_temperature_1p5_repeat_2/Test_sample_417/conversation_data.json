    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify the number of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n**Our plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core with three identical, large substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5. This arrangement gives the molecule C3 rotational symmetry.\n2.  **Utilize Symmetry:** Because of this symmetry, the three large substituents are chemically equivalent. This simplifies the problem significantly, as we only need to count the unique proton signals from the central core and from *one* of the substituent \"arms.\"\n3.  **Count Signals in Sub-parts:** We will count the unique proton environments for each distinct part of the molecule:\n    *   The central trimethylbenzene core.\n    *   The `-CH2-` linker group.\n    *   The heterocyclic substituent, which we'll break down further into the pyrazole ring and the chiral camphor-derived bicyclic system.\n4.  **Sum the Signals:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the signals from each unique part.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan by assigning the number of unique signals for each part of the molecule and summing them up to find the total.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule.\n    \n    The molecule is: 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n    The overall molecule has C3 symmetry. We count the signals from the central core\n    and one of the three identical arms.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
