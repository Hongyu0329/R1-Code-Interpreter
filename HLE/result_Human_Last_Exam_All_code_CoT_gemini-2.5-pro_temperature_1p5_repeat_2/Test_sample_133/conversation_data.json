    "This task requires finding the optimal move for player 'O' in a Connect 4 game, where \"optimal\" means winning as fast as possible.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board**: I will first represent the given Connect 4 board state in a data structure, like a 2D list or array. The player to move is 'O'.\n2.  **Check for Immediate Wins**: The fastest win is an immediate one ('Win in 1'). I will check if 'O' has any moves that complete a line of four pieces. My manual analysis indicates there are no immediate wins for 'O'.\n3.  **Check for Forced Wins**: If there's no immediate win, the next fastest way to win is to set up an unstoppable threat. In Connect 4, this usually means creating two threats simultaneously (a \"fork\"). The opponent can only block one, allowing 'O' to win on the next turn. This is a \"Win in 3 moves\" (O plays, X blocks, O wins).\n4.  **Simulate and Evaluate**: I will write a script to simulate each possible move for 'O'. For each simulated move, the script will then analyze all of the opponent's possible responses. If, after every one of the opponent's moves, 'O' still has a winning move available, the initial move is a forced win.\n5.  **Identify All Optimal Moves**: The script will identify all moves that lead to such a forced win.\n6.  **Format the Output**: The final output will be a comma-separated list of the optimal moves, like `c4, f4`.\n\nThe provided Python script will execute this plan to determine all optimal moves for 'O'.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connect4():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the optimal move(s) for player 'O' in the given Connect 4 game state.\n    An optimal move is one that leads to a win in the fastest possible way.\n    \n    The strategy is as follows:\n    1.  The board state is loaded into a 2D list.\n    2.  The script checks for any moves that would result in an immediate win for 'O' (a \"Win in 1\").\n    3.  If no immediate win is found, it searches for moves that create a forced win. A forced win occurs\n        when a player makes a move that creates at least two separate winning threats simultaneously.\n        The opponent can only block one of these threats, so the player is guaranteed to win on their next turn.\n    4.  To check for a forced win, the script simulates each of O's possible moves.\n    5.  For each simulated move, it then considers all of the opponent's (X's) possible counter-moves.\n    6.  If after every one of X's counter-moves, O still has a path to victory on the next turn, the initial move by O is\n        a guaranteed winning move.\n    7.  All such optimal moves are collected and printed in the specified format.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Board representation: 6 rows, 7 columns.\n    # Index [0][0] corresponds to cell a1 (top-left).\n    # Index [5][6] corresponds to cell g6 (bottom-right).\n    board = [['.' for _ in range(7)] for _ in range(6)]\n    rows, cols = 6, 7\n    player = 'O'\n    opponent = 'X'\n\n    # Populate the board based on the provided game state.\n    # Row 6 (board index 5)\n    board[5][0] = 'X'; board[5][1] = 'O'; board[5][2] = 'O'; board[5][3] = 'X'; board[5][4] = 'X'; board[5][5] = 'O'; board[5][6] = 'X'\n    # Row 5 (board index 4)\n    board[4][0] = 'O'; board[4][2] = 'X'; board[4][3] = 'O'; board[4][4] = 'X'; board[4][5] = 'X'; board[4][6] = 'X'\n    # Row 4 (board index 3)\n    board[3][3] = 'O'; board[3][4] = 'O'\n\n    def get_landing_row(current_board, col):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the row a piece will land in for a given column, accounting for gravity.\"\"\"\n        for r in range(rows - 1, -1, -1): # Start from the bottom row\n            if current_board[r][col] == '.':\n                return r\n        return -1 # Column is full\n\n    def check_win(current_board, p):\n        \"\"\"Checks if player 'p' has four in a row on the current board.\"\"\"\n        # Horizontal check\n        for r in range(rows):\n            for c in range(cols - 3):\n                if all(current_board[r][c+i] == p for i in range(4)): return True\n        # Vertical check\n        for r in range(rows - 3):\n            for c in range(cols):\n                if all(current_board[r+i][c] == p for i in range(4)): return True\n        # Diagonal (top-left to bottom-right, \\)\n        for r in range(rows - 3):\n            for c in range(cols - 3):\n                if all(current_board[r+i][c+i] == p for i in range(4)): return True\n        # Diagonal (bottom-left to top-right, /)\n        for r in range(3, rows):\n            for c in range(cols - 3):\n                if all(current_board[r-i][c+i] == p for i in range(4)): return True\n        return False\n\n    def find_winning_moves(current_board, p):\n        \"\"\"Returns a list of column indices that would result in a win for player 'p'.\"\"\"\n        winning_cols = []\n        for c in range(cols):\n            r = get_landing_row(current_board, c)\n            if r != -1:\n                temp_board = [row[:] for row in current_board]\n                temp_board[r][c] = p\n                if check_win(temp_board, p):\n                    winning_cols.append(c)\n        return winning_cols\n\n    optimal_moves = []\n    \n    # Check for \"Win in 1\" - this is the fastest win possible.\n    win_in_1_cols = find_winning_moves(board, player)\n\n    if win_in_1_cols:\n        for c in sorted(win_in_1_cols):\n            r = get_landing_row(board, c)\n            move_str = f\"{chr(ord('a') + c)}{r + 1}\"\n            optimal_moves.append(move_str)\n    else:\n        # Check for \"Win in 3\" (a forced win).\n        for o_move_col in range(cols):\n            o_move_row = get_landing_row(board, o_move_col)\n            if o_move_row == -1: continue\n\n            board_after_o = [row[:] for row in board]\n            board_after_o[o_move_row][o_move_col] = player\n\n            # A move is a forced win if the opponent cannot stop the win on their turn.\n            is_stoppable = False\n            \n            if find_winning_moves(board_after_o, opponent):\n                # O's move allows the opponent to win.
