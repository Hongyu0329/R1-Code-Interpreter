    Analyzes which types of functions are necessarily Lebesgue integrable and prints the result.

    Definition of Lebesgue Integrability:
    A real-valued function f defined on a measure space is Lebesgue integrable if it satisfies two conditions:
    1. f is a measurable function.
    2. The integral of the absolute value of f is finite (i.e., ∫|f|dμ < ∞).

    The analysis below will check each provided option against these two conditions. We assume the
    underlying space is the real line with the standard Lebesgue measure unless a specific interval
    like [a,b] or (a,b) is mentioned.
