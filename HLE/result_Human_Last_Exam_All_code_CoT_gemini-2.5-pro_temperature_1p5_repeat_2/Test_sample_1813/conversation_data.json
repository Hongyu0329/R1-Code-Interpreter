    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  The problem asks for the \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$\". In the context of number theory, this refers to a specific quadratic irrational number whose continued fraction is periodic.\n2.  The procedure to find this number is to first compute the simple continued fraction of the rational number $p/q = 4/7$. This results in a sequence of partial quotients, $p/q = [0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n]$.\n3.  The associated quadratic irrational, let's call it $x$, has a purely periodic continued fraction where the period is the *reverse* of the sequence of quotients from the previous step. That is, $x = [\\overline{a_n, a_{n-1}, \\ldots, a_1}]$.\n4.  This number $x$ is the solution to a quadratic equation $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$. The prompt specifically asks to \"output each number in the final equation\", which strongly suggests that finding this equation is the goal.\n5.  I will write a Python script to perform these steps:\n    a. Compute the continued fraction quotients for $4/7$.\n    b. Reverse this sequence of quotients.\n    c. Use the reversed sequence to determine the coefficients $A, B, C$ of the quadratic equation. A standard method for this involves matrix multiplication. For a period $(c_1, \\ldots, c_k)$, we compute the matrix product $K = M_{c_1} \\cdots M_{c_k}$, where $M_c = \\begin{pmatrix} c & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. If the resulting matrix is $K = \\begin{pmatrix} P & S \\\\ Q & R \\end{pmatrix}$, the equation for $x$ is $Qx^2 + (R-P)x - S = 0$.\n    d. Simplify the equation by dividing the coefficients by their greatest common divisor.\n    e. Print the final simplified equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_continued_fraction_coeffs(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the partial quotients of the continued fraction of p/q.\n    p/q is a positive rational number less than 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    coeffs = []\n    # Using the Euclidean algorithm to find the quotients\n    # for q/p, which will be [a1, a2, ..., an]\n    num, den = q, p\n    while den != 0:\n        quotient = num // den\n        remainder = num % den\n        coeffs.append(quotient)\n        num = den\n        den = remainder\n    return coeffs\n\ndef format_equation(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Formats the coefficients a, b, c into a standard quadratic equation string.\n    e.g., Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0\n    \"\"\"\n    parts = []\n    # Term Ax^2\n    if a != 0:\n        if a == 1:\n            parts.append(\"x^2\")\n        elif a == -1:\n            parts.append(\"-x^2\")\n        else:\n            parts.append(f\"{a}x^2\")\n    \n    # Term Bx\n    if b != 0:\n        # Add a sign if it's not the first term\n        if parts:\n            if b > 0:\n                parts.append(\" + \")\n            else:\n                parts.append(\" - \")\n        # If it is the first term and negative\n        elif b < 0:\n            parts.append(\"-\")\n            \n        b_abs = abs(b)\n        if b_abs == 1:\n            parts.append(\"x\")\n        else:\n            parts.append(f\"{b_abs}x\")\n\n    # Term C\n    if c != 0:\n        if parts:\n            if c > 0:\n                parts.append(\" + \")\n            else:\n                parts.append(\" - \")\n        elif c < 0:\n             parts.append(\"-\")\n\n        c_abs = abs(c)\n        parts.append(f\"{c_abs}\")\n\n    parts.append(\" = 0\")\n    return \"\".join(parts)\n    \ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the rational number\n    p, q = 4, 7\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the continued fraction of p/q\n    # 4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]\n    # The partial quotients are [1, 1, 3]\n    coeffs = get_continued_fraction_coeffs(p, q)\n    \n    # Step 3: Reverse the sequence of quotients\n    # The period of the associated continued fraction is the reverse\n    reversed_coeffs = list(reversed(coeffs))\n    \n    # Step 4: Compute the matrix K for the reversed sequence\n    # K = M_{a_n} * ... * M_{a_1}\n    # For period [3, 1, 1]\n    K = np.identity(2, dtype=object) # Use object to handle large integers if necessary\n    \n    # Initialize with the first matrix in the sequence\n    if reversed_coeffs:\n        a = reversed_coeffs[0]\n        K = np.array([[a, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=object)\n        \n        # Multiply by the rest\n        for i in range(1, len(reversed_coeffs)):\n            a = reversed_coeffs[i]\n            M_a = np.array([[a, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=object)\n            K = np.dot(K, M_a)\n\n    # Step 5: Derive the quadratic equation coefficients\n    # K = [[P, S], [Q, R]]\n    # The equation is Qx^2 + (R-P)x - S = 0\n    P, S = K[0, 0], K[0, 1]\n    Q, R = K[1, 0], K[1, 1]\n    \n    A = int(Q)\n    B = int(R - P)\n    C = int(-S)\n    \n    # Step 6: Simplify the coefficients\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(math.gcd(A, B), C)\n    A //= common_divisor\n    B //= common_divisor\n    C //= common_divisor\n    \n    # Step 7: Print the final equation, which represents the continued fraction\n    equation_str = format_equation(A, B, C)\n    \n    print(f\"The continued fraction of {p}/{q} gives the quotients: {coeffs}\")\n    print(f\"The associated periodic continued fraction has the reversed period: {reversed_coeffs}\")\n    print(\"The quadratic irrational number x with this continued fraction satisfies the equation:\")\n    print(equation_str)\n    print(f\"The numbers in the final equation are: A={A}, B={B}, C={C}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<$x^2 - 3x - 2 = 0$>>>"
