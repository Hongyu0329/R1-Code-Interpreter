    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the number sequence puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the primary sequence:** Look for a simple relationship between consecutive terms in the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119. A common pattern is `next_term = a * previous_term + b`. Testing with `a=2`, we find that the relationship can be expressed as `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + c`, where `c` is a constant that changes with each step.\n2.  **Derive the sequence of constants (c):** By applying the formula from step 1, we can calculate the sequence of these constants.\n    *   11 = 2 * 2 + **7**\n    *   23 = 2 * 11 + **1**\n    *   51 = 2 * 23 + **5**\n    *   119 = 2 * 51 + **17**\n    This gives us a new sequence `c` = [7, 1, 5, 17].\n3.  **Analyze the constants sequence (c):** Now, we find the pattern within the sequence `c`. We can do this by looking at the differences between its consecutive terms.\n    *   1 - 7 = **-6**\n    *   5 - 1 = **4**\n    *   17 - 5 = **12**\n    This gives us a third sequence, the sequence of differences, `d` = [-6, 4, 12].\n4.  **Find the pattern in the differences (d):** By examining the sequence `d`, we can spot a multiplicative pattern.\n    *   4 / -6 â‰  3\n    *   12 / 4 = 3\n    It appears that starting from the second term, each term is 3 times the previous one.\n5.  **Predict the next terms:**\n    *   The next term in the `d` sequence will be 12 * 3 = **36**.\n    *   The next term in the `c` sequence will be the last term (17) plus the new difference (36), which is 17 + 36 = **53**.\n    *   Finally, the next term in the original sequence is `2 * last_term + next_c`, which is `2 * 119 + 53`.\n6.  **Calculate the final answer:** `2 * 119 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the number sequence puzzle by finding the nested patterns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the initial sequence\n    s = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"The initial sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, s))}\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Find the pattern x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + c_n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Derive the sequence of constants 'c'\n    c = []\n    for i in range(len(s) - 1):\n        constant = s[i+1] - 2 * s[i]\n        c.append(constant)\n        print(f\"{s[i+1]} = 2 * {s[i]} + {constant}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe sequence of constants 'c' is:\", ', '.join(map(str, c)))\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Find the pattern in the constants 'c' by looking at the differences 'd'.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Derive the sequence of differences 'd'\n    d = []\n    for i in range(len(c) - 1):\n        diff = c[i+1] - c[i]\n        d.append(diff)\n        print(f\"{c[i+1]} - {c[i]} = {diff}\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nThe sequence of differences 'd' is:\", ', '.join(map(str, d)))\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Find the pattern in the differences 'd'.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Establish the pattern in 'd' and predict the next term\n    # d[1] * 3 = d[2] -> 4 * 3 = 12\n    ratio = d[2] // d[1]\n    print(f\"The pattern in 'd' is multiplication by {ratio} (from the 2nd term onwards): {d[1]} * {ratio} = {d[2]}\")\n    next_d = d[-1] * ratio\n    print(f\"The next difference is: {d[-1]} * {ratio} = {next_d}\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Predict the next constant 'c'\n    next_c = c[-1] + next_d\n    print(f\"The next constant 'c' is: {c[-1]} + {next_d} = {next_c}\")\n    \n    # Step 6: Calculate the final answer\n    next_s = 2 * s[-1] + next_c\n    print(f\"\\nFinally, the next term in the sequence is calculated:\")\n    print(f\"Next Term = 2 * {s[-1]} + {next_c} = {next_s}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
