    print("--- The Role of LIG1 and Somatic Instability in Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1) ---")

    print("\n1. Myotonic Dystrophy and CTG Repeats:")
    print("   - Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) is caused by an expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene.")
    print("   - In affected individuals, this repeat tract is unstable in somatic (non-reproductive) cells and tends to expand further over a person's lifetime. This is called 'somatic instability'.")

    print("\n2. The Role of DNA Ligase I (LIG1):")
    print("   - LIG1 is a crucial enzyme in DNA replication and repair.")
    print("   - Its primary job is to seal 'nicks' (breaks in one strand of the DNA backbone), particularly joining Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand during DNA replication.")

    print("\n3. Mechanism of Expansion and LIG1's Role:")
    print("   - During the replication of the CTG repeat tract, the new DNA strand can slip and form a hairpin-like secondary structure.")
    print("   - If this hairpin is not removed and the DNA synthesis is completed and sealed by LIG1, it results in an increase in the number of repeats (an expansion).")
    print("   - Scientific studies using cell and mouse models have shown that when LIG1 is deficient or 'knocked out', the final ligation step is delayed or impaired.")
    print("   - This delay provides a longer opportunity for other DNA repair pathways to detect and remove the slipped hairpin structure before it gets permanently incorporated into the genome.")

    print("\n4. Conclusion on Impact:")
    print("   - By preventing the permanent incorporation of the slipped strand, LIG1 deficiency leads to a significant decrease in the rate of repeat expansions.")
    print("   - Therefore, the impact of knocking out or reducing LIG1 is the stabilization of the repeat tract.")
    print("\nBased on this biological mechanism, the correct answer is 'Reduced instability'.")
    print("\nFinal Answer Choice: C. Reduced instability")
