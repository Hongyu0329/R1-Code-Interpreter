def solve_fibonacci_heap_chain_problem():
    """
    Calculates the smallest number of operations to transform a Fibonacci heap
    with a k-chain to one with a (k+1)-chain.

    The transformation from a single k-chain to a single (k+1)-chain is complex.
    A simple analysis shows that any attempt to use the `Delete-Min` operation to link
    the existing k-chain (a degree-1 tree) with a new node (a degree-0 tree)
    will fail because their degrees do not match.

    A successful transformation requires a sequence of operations to carefully
    rearrange the nodes. A minimal sequence consists of these conceptual steps:

    1. Insert the new node for the (k+1)-chain.
    2. Insert a temporary "dummy" node with the overall minimum key, which will be sacrificed.
    3. Use Decrease-Key to break the original k-chain, placing its constituent parts into the root list.
    4. Use Delete-Min to remove the dummy node, triggering a consolidation that builds the new (k+1)-chain.

    This sequence requires four operations.
