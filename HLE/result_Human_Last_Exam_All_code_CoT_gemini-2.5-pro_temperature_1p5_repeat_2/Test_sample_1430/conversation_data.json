    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the mathematical objects involved: the genus 3 curve `C`, its 15th symmetric power `X`, and the Néron-Severi group `NS(X)`. The rank of this group is also known as the Picard number, `ρ(X)`.\n2.  Next, I'll use the fundamental formula that connects the Picard number of a symmetric power of a curve, `ρ(C^(d))`, to the Picard number of its Jacobian variety, `ρ(Jac(C))`. This formula is `ρ(C^(d)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1`.\n3.  To find the **smallest** possible rank of `NS(X)`, I will determine the minimum possible value for `ρ(Jac(C))`. This occurs when `C` is a \"very general\" curve, meaning its Jacobian has the simplest possible structure.\n4.  To find the **largest** possible rank of `NS(X)`, I will determine the maximum possible value for `ρ(Jac(C))`. This is achieved for special curves `C` whose Jacobians have a richer structure, specifically Complex Multiplication (CM). The maximum value is bounded by a well-known theorem related to the genus of the curve.\n5.  Finally, I will substitute these minimum and maximum values of `ρ(Jac(C))` into the formula from step 2 to compute the smallest and largest ranks for `NS(X)`. The entire reasoning and calculation will be encapsulated in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riemann_surface_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The genus of the Riemann surface C\n    g = 3\n    # The degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n    d = 15\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group for X = C^({d}), where C is a genus g={g} Riemann surface.\")\n    print(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group is denoted by ρ.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: State the key mathematical relationship.\n    print(\"--- Step 1: The Key Formula ---\")\n    print(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of the d-th symmetric power of a curve, ρ(C^(d)), is related to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian variety, ρ(Jac(C)).\")\n    print(\"The formula is: ρ(C^(d)) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the smallest possible rank.\n    print(\"--- Step 2: The Smallest Rank ---\")\n    print(\"The smallest rank occurs for a 'very general' curve C.
