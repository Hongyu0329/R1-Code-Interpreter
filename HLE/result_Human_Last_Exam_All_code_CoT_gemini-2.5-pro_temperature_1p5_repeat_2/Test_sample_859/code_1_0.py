# Step 1: Determine the minimal possible value for d.
# The graph G has edge connectivity 2, so the minimum degree of G must be at least 2.
# The degrees of the three vertices are d, d+1, and d+1.
# So, d must be at least 2.
# Since d is given to be even, the minimal possible value for d is 2.
d = 2

# Step 2: Calculate the degrees of the three removed vertices.
v1_degree = d
v2_degree = d + 1
v3_degree = d + 1

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of edges removed.
# These edges are the connections from v1, v2, v3 to the rest of the graph G'.
total_edges_removed = v1_degree + v2_degree + v3_degree

# Step 4: Determine the maximum number of leaf blocks in G'.
# In the worst-case scenario, each edge removed could correspond to a
# connection that holds a leaf block to the graph.
# The maximum number of leaf blocks, p_max, is equal to the total_edges_removed.
p_max = total_edges_removed

# Step 5: Calculate the minimal number of new edges needed to make G' 2-edge-connected.
# This is given by the formula ceil(p / 2). We use p_max for the worst case.
min_new_edges = math.ceil(p_max / 2)

# Step 6: Print the results and the final equation.
