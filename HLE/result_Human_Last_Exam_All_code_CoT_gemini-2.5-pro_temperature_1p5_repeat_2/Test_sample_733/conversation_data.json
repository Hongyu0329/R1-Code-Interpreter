    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the definitions and then apply them to find the groups that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking\n\n1.  **Product-Free Set**: A subset `S` of a group `G` is called \"product-free\" if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (including the case `x=y`), their product `x*y` is not in `S`. This can be stated as `S ∩ S*S = ∅`. A direct consequence is that a product-free set cannot contain the identity element `e`, because `e*e = e`.\n\n2.  **Maximal by Inclusion**: A product-free set `S` is \"maximal by inclusion\" (or simply maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g` in `G` that is not already in `S`, the new set `S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n3.  **The Task**: We are looking for the number of distinct (non-isomorphic) finite groups `G` that contain a maximal product-free set `S = {a, b}` of size 2.\n\n4.  **Analysis**:\n    *   For `S = {a, b}` to be product-free, the products `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b` must not be in `{a, b}`. Also, `a` and `b` cannot be the identity element `e`.\n    *   For `S = {a, b}` to be maximal, for any element `g` chosen from `G \\ {a, b}`, the set `{a, b, g}` must not be product-free.\n        *   If we choose `g = e`, the set `{a, b, e}` is not product-free because `e*e = e`, so this condition holds for the identity element.\n        *   For any other `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`, there must be a product of two elements from `{a, b, g}` that results in an element within `{a, b, g}`. Since `{a, b}` is already product-free, this product must involve `g`. Examples: `a*g = b`, `g*g = a`, `a*b = g`, etc.\n\n5.  **Result from Group Theory**: The complete classification of such groups is a known result in combinatorial group theory. The analysis, which is quite involved, reveals that only five finite groups have this property. They are:\n    *   The cyclic group of order 4, `C₄`\n    *   The cyclic group of order 5, `C₅`\n    *   The Klein four-group, `C₂ × C₂`\n    *   The cyclic group of order 6, `C₆`\n    *   The symmetric group on 3 elements (or dihedral group of order 6), `S₃`\n\n6.  **Coding Approach**: To answer the user's request with code, I will write a Python script that programmatically verifies which of several small, common finite groups possess this property. The script will define the groups using their Cayley (operation) tables, search for a maximal product-free set of size 2 in each, and count how many such groups it finds from the list. This provides a computational verification of the theoretical result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this verification process.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef has_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_2(group_name, elements, op_table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a group has a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    identity = elements[0]\n    non_identity_elements = [el for el in elements if el != identity]\n    n = len(elements)\n    element_to_idx = {el: i for i, el in enumerate(elements)}\n\n    def is_product_free(s_subset):\n        \"\"\"Helper function to check if a given subset is product-free.\"\"\"\n        if identity in s_subset:\n            return False\n        for e1 in s_subset:\n            for e2 in s_subset:\n                idx1 = element_to_idx[e1]\n                idx2 = element_to_idx[e2]\n                product_idx = op_table[idx1][idx2]\n                product = elements[product_idx]\n                if product in s_subset:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    # Iterate over all subsets of size 2 of non-identity elements\n    for s_tuple in itertools.combinations(non_identity_elements, 2):\n        s = set(s_tuple)\n\n        # 1.
