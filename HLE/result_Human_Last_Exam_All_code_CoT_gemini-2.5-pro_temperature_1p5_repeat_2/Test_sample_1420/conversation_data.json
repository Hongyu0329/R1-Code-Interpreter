    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat using the epsilon expansion.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Concepts:** The problem involves the epsilon (ε) expansion, a method from renormalization group theory used to calculate critical exponents.\n2.  **Define Epsilon (ε):** The expansion parameter ε is defined as the difference between the upper critical dimension, `d_c`, and the spatial dimension of interest, `d`. For the common n-vector model (which includes the Ising model), the upper critical dimension `d_c` is 4.\n3.  **State the Formula:** I will use the established formula for the specific heat exponent, α, calculated to the first order in ε. The formula depends on `n`, the number of components of the order parameter. We'll use the Ising model (n=1) as the canonical example. The formula is:\n    α ≈ (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) \\* ε\n4.  **Perform Calculation:** I will substitute the values `d=3`, `d_c=4` (so `ε=1`), and `n=1` into the formula to calculate α.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** The Python script will perform these calculations and print out each step of the process, showing how the values are substituted into the formula to arrive at the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Step 1: Define the parameters for the epsilon expansion.\n# The upper critical dimension (d_c) for the n-vector model is 4.\nd_c = 4\n# The spatial dimension (d) of the system is 3.\nd = 3\n# We will use the Ising model as the canonical example, where the order\n# parameter has n=1 component (spin up or spin down).\nn = 1\n\nprint(f\"Calculating the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in d={d} dimensions.\")\nprint(\"This will be done using the epsilon expansion to first order.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the expansion parameter, epsilon.\nprint(f\"The expansion parameter is ε = d_c - d, where d_c = {d_c} is the upper critical dimension.\")\nepsilon = d_c - d\nprint(f\"ε = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\n# Step 3: Use the first-order epsilon expansion formula for alpha.\nprint(\"The first-order formula for α for the n-vector model is:\")\nprint(\"α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\")\nprint(f\"\\nFor the Ising model (n={n}), we substitute the values into the formula:\")\n\n# Show the substitution of each number into the equation\nprint(f\"α ≈ ({4} - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the intermediate and final values.\nnumerator = 4 - n\ndenominator_intermediate = n + 8\ndenominator_final = 2 * denominator_intermediate\n\nprint(f\"α ≈ {numerator} / (2 * {denominator_intermediate}) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α ≈ {numerator} / {denominator_final} * {epsilon}\")\n\n# Calculate the final result for alpha\nalpha = numerator / denominator_final * epsilon\n\n# Use fractions module for a more precise representation of 1/6 if needed\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nalpha_fraction = Fraction(numerator, denominator_final) * epsilon\n\nprint(f\"α ≈ {alpha_fraction.numerator}/{alpha_fraction.denominator}\")\nprint(f\"As a decimal, the scaling exponent is α ≈ {alpha:.4f}\")\n\n# The final answer in the required format will be based on this calculation\n# For this script's purpose, we'll store it to be presented at the end.\nfinal_answer = alpha\n\n# This part is just to show how to format the final answer for the platform\n# In a real scenario, you wouldn't print the '<<<' characters like this.\n# print(f\"\\nFinal answer in required format: <<<{final_answer}>>>\", file=sys.stderr)\n\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
