# This script solves the riddle by identifying a person who fits both the
# physical description of looking like a porcupine and the naming constraint
# of having two words that start with the same letter.

# The solution is the German playwright Bertolt Brecht.

# Define the two parts of the name.
word_1 = "Bertolt"
word_2 = "Brecht"

# The prompt mentions an "equation" but provides no numbers.
# We will interpret this by printing the components of the name.
print("The first part of the name is:")
print(word_1)
print("The second part of the name is:")
print(word_2)
print("The full name is:")
print(word_1, word_2)
