The primary conditions are that the functions F, G, H have a mixed monotone property and satisfy a set of contractive inequalities like `d(F(x,y,z), F(u,v,w)) <= j*d(x,u) + k*d(y,v) + l*d(z,w)` for non-negative constants j, k, l where the crucial requirement is `j + k + l < 1`. These conditions are set within a complete partially ordered metric space and require a valid initial point.
