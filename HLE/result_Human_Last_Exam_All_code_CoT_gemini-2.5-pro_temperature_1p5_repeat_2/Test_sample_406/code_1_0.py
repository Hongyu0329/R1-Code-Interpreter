The conditions for the existence of a tripled fixed point are established by theorems in partially ordered metric spaces.

*** NOTE: The function signatures you provided (F:X*Y*Z→X, G:Y*X*Y→Y, G:Z*Y*X→Z) appear to contain typos. The standard, and more symmetric, definitions for which these theorems are proven are:
- F: X × Y × Z → X
- G: Y × X × Z → Y
- H: Z × X × Y → Z
The following conditions are based on these standard definitions.

**1. Definition of a Tripled Fixed Point**
An element (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z is a tripled fixed point of F, G, and H if it satisfies the following system of equations:
- F(x, y, z) = x
- G(y, x, z) = y
- H(z, x, y) = z

**2. Conditions for Existence**

Let (X, ≤) be a partially ordered set equipped with a metric 'd' such that (X, d) is a complete metric space. The mappings F, G, and H must satisfy the following conditions:

**(A) Mixed Monotone Property:**
The functions must have a mixed monotone property. For F, this means F(x, y, z) is non-decreasing in 'x' and 'z' and non-increasing in 'y'. Similar properties must hold for G and H with respect to their arguments.

**(B) Contractive Condition:**
There must exist three non-negative constants, which we'll call '{j}', '{k}', and '{l}', that satisfy the main inequality:
- Equation 1: {j} + {k} + {l} < {one}

These constants must satisfy the following contractive inequalities for all x, u, y, v, z, w ∈ X such that x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w:

- Equation 2: d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ {j}*d(x, u) + {k}*d(y, v) + {l}*d(z, w)
- Equation 3: d(G(y, x, z), G(v, u, w)) ≤ {j}*d(y, v) + {k}*d(x, u) + {l}*d(z, w)
- Equation 4: d(H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v)) ≤ {j}*d(z, w) + {k}*d(x, u) + {l}*d(y, v)

**(C) Initial Point Condition:**
There must exist at least one point (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × X × X such that:
- x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)
- y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, z₀)
- z₀ ≤ H(z₀, x₀, y₀)

**(D) Continuity or Regularity:**
An additional condition is required:
- EITHER F, G, and H are continuous functions.
- OR the space (X, ≤, d) is 'regular', which ensures that limits of monotone sequences maintain the order relation.

If all these conditions (A, B, C, and D) are met, then F, G, and H have a tripled fixed point.
