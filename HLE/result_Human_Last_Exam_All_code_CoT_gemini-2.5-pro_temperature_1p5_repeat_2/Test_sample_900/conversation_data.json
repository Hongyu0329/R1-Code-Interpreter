    "This is a fascinating and very specific question about a dance performance. Answering it requires visually analyzing the choreography and counting the occurrences of a specific dance step, the \"pas de Balanchine\".\n\nThis task falls outside the realm of what can be accomplished with a Python or shell script. Code can process text, perform calculations, and automate digital tasks, but it cannot watch a video and identify nuanced human movements from a specific choreographic vocabulary. Therefore, I cannot generate a script to solve this problem.\n\nFurthermore, this level of detailed analysis (a specific move count for a single performance) is not typically found in written reviews or databases that I can access. To find the answer, one would need to be a dance expert, watch a recording of the performance, and manually count each instance of the step.\n\nFor these reasons, I cannot provide a numerical answer.\n\n<<<Information not available>>>"
