    "For a multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is critical to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure the instrument is set up correctly, the data is properly compensated, and the sorting gates are accurately defined. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls you will need.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Control Categories:** The essential controls can be grouped into three main categories for this experiment:\n    *   **Unstained Control:** To establish the baseline autofluorescence of the streptavidin beads.\n    *   **Single-Color Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap between the five different fluorophores.\n    *   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** To accurately set the gates for identifying positive populations, which is crucial for achieving high purity in a sort.\n2.  **Calculate the Number for Each Category:**\n    *   There is always one **unstained control**.\n    *   The number of **compensation controls** is equal to the number of fluorophores used (five in this case).\n    *   For a high-stakes sorting experiment, the number of **FMO controls** is also equal to the number of fluorophores, as an FMO is needed to properly gate each color.\n3.  **Sum the Totals:** Add the numbers from each category to get the final count of essential controls. The code will perform this calculation and print the detailed explanation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_cytometry_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the fluorophores from the user's query\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_fluorophores = len(fluorophores)\n\n    # 1.
