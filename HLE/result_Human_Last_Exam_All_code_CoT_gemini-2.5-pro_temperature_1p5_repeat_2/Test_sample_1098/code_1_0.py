    1.  The apparatus described is a physical model of the "Maxwell's demon" thought experiment, often explained using the concept of a Brownian ratchet. The goal is to make all gas molecules end up in one compartment, which represents a decrease in entropy (an increase in order).

    2.  According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, in an isolated system at a single, uniform temperature (i.e., in thermal equilibrium), entropy cannot spontaneously decrease.

    3.  If the gas and the one-way door are at the same temperature, the door itself will be subject to random thermal energy (Brownian motion). This means the door will be randomly kicked open from the "trapping" side by gas molecules just as often as it is pushed open from the "filling" side.

    4.  Because the door opens randomly in both directions, there will be no net flow of gas to one side. The gas will remain evenly distributed, which is the state of maximum entropy.

    5.  To make the door function as a true one-way gate, a temperature difference is required. Specifically, the door mechanism must be colder than the gas. A colder door will not be kicked open by the random collisions from the trapped gas, allowing it to rectify the thermal motion and trap molecules that pass through from the hotter side.

    6.  Therefore, the critical experimental parameter that must be introduced to break the thermal equilibrium and allow the demon to function is Temperature.
