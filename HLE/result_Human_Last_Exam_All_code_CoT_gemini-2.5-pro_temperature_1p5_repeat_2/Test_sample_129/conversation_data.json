    "To find the number of true boolean expressions of length 5, I will write a Python script to perform an exhaustive search.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Generate Candidates:** I will systematically generate every possible string of exactly 5 characters using the allowed symbols `T, F, !, &, |, (, )`. Since there are 7 symbols, this results in 7^5 = 16,807 possible strings.\n2.  **Translate to Python:** For each generated string, I will translate it into a Python-evaluatable format. For instance, `T&!F` will be converted to `True and not False`. This translation respects the required operator precedence, as Python's `not`, `and`, and `or` have the same precedence order as `!`, `&`, and `|`.\n3.  **Validate and Evaluate:** I will use a `try...except` block to attempt to evaluate the translated string. If the string is not a syntactically valid expression (e.g., `(T&&F)`), Python's `eval()` function will raise an error, and my script will discard it.\n4.  **Count True Results:** If an expression is valid, the script will check if its result is `True`.\n5.  **Final Output:** I will maintain a list of all expressions that evaluate to `True`. Finally, the script will print each of these true expressions. To satisfy the requirement of showing the \"final equation,\" I will then print an equation that sums `1` for each found expression to arrive at the total count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_true_boolean_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all true boolean expressions of a given length using a specific\n    set of symbols and prints them, along with a final count.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbols = ['T', 'F', '!', '&', '|', '(', ')']\n    expression_length = 5\n    \n    # Mapping from problem symbols to Python's boolean syntax.\n    # Spaces are added to ensure tokens are evaluated correctly.\n    mapping = {\n        'T': ' True ',\n        'F': ' False ',\n        '|': ' or ',\n        '&': ' and ',\n        '!': ' not ',\n        '(': ' ( ',\n        ')': ' ) '\n    }\n\n    true_expressions = []\n    \n    # 1.
