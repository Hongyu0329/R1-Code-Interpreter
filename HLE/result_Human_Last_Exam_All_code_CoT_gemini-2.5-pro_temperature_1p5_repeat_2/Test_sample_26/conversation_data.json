    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$, for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of its free part, which is equivalent to the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring the group with the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nHere is a plan to determine the structure of $\\pi_3(X)$ and its rank:\n\n1.  We will use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair $(Y, X)$, where $Y = \\mathbb{CP}^3$. This sequence connects the homotopy groups of $X$, the ambient space $Y$, and the relative homotopy groups $\\pi_k(Y,X)$.\n2.  We will compute the required homotopy groups of $Y = \\mathbb{CP}^3$ by relating them to the homotopy groups of the 7-sphere $S^7$ via the Hopf fibration.\n3.  The relative homotopy groups $\\pi_k(Y,X)$ will be determined using the Relative Hurewicz Theorem, which connects homotopy to homology. This requires first establishing the connectivity of the pair $(Y,X)$.\n4.  The necessary relative homology groups $H_k(Y,X)$ are calculated from the long exact sequence of homology for the pair, where the degree of the hypersurface, $d=5$, plays a crucial role.\n5.  By assembling these pieces, we will identify the group $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank of this group is then straightforward to determine.\n\nThe following Python code implements this chain of reasoning to calculate the rank.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic\n    hypersurface in CP^3 by following a standard argument in algebraic topology.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let X be a smooth quintic hypersurface in Y = CP^3.\n    # The degree of the hypersurface.\n    d = 5\n    # The dimension of the ambient complex projective space.\n    n = 3\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the relevant homotopy groups of the ambient space Y = CP^3.\")\n    # The homotopy groups of CP^n are related to those of a sphere S^(2n+1)\n    # via the Hopf fibration S^1 -> S^(2n+1) -> CP^n.\n    # The long exact sequence of this fibration implies pi_k(CP^n) is isomorphic\n    # to pi_k(S^(2n+1)) for k >= 3.
