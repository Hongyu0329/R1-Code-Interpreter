    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I will identify the distinct types of symmetries that leave the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions invariant. These symmetries form a Lie group, and the dimension of this group is the total number of independent parameters required to specify a transformation.\n\nThe symmetries are:\n1.  **Time translations:** The laws of physics don't change over time. This adds 1 dimension.\n2.  **Space translations:** The laws of physics are the same everywhere in space. Since we are in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this adds 3 dimensions.\n3.  **Spatial rotations:** The laws of physics are isotropic (the same in all directions). The rotation group in 3D, SO(3), has 3 dimensions.\n4.  **Galilean boosts:** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity. This is a 3-dimensional transformation for the velocity vector.\n5.  **Scaling (or dilation):** The equations possess a scaling symmetry that transforms space, time, velocity, and pressure in a coordinated way. This is a single-parameter transformation, adding 1 dimension.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script that defines a variable for the dimension of each symmetry type, calculates their sum, and prints the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3 have a well-known symmetry group.\n# We calculate its dimension by summing the number of generators for each independent symmetry.\n\n# 1. Time translation: t -> t + a_0 (1 parameter)\ntime_translations = 1\n\n# 2. Space translations: x -> x + a (3 parameters for the vector a in R^3)\nspace_translations = 3\n\n# 3. Spatial rotations: x -> Rx (3 parameters for the rotation matrix R in SO(3))\nspatial_rotations = 3\n\n# 4. Galilean boosts: x -> x + vt, u -> u + v (3 parameters for the velocity vector v)\ngalilean_boosts = 3\n\n# 5. Scaling transformations: t -> a^2*t, x -> a*x, u -> a^-1*u, p -> a^-2*p (1 parameter a)\nscaling_symmetries = 1\n\n# The total dimension is the sum of these individual dimensions.\ntotal_dimension = time_translations + space_translations + spatial_rotations + galilean_boosts + scaling_symmetries\n\nprint(\"The dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the dimensions from each symmetry type:\")\nprint(f\"Time Translations: {time_translations}\")\nprint(f\"Space Translations: {space_translations}\")\nprint(f\"Spatial Rotations: {spatial_rotations}\")\nprint(f\"Galilean Boosts: {galilean_boosts}\")\nprint(f\"Scaling Symmetries: {scaling_symmetries}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{time_translations} + {space_translations} + {spatial_rotations} + {galilean_boosts} + {scaling_symmetries} = {total_dimension}\")\n```\n<<<11>>>"
