    # The disconnection number of a space X, D(X), is the smallest integer 'n'
    # such that any set of 'n' points, when removed, disconnects X.

    # A key theorem in continuum theory states that (with some caveats not relevant here)
    # a space has a disconnection number of 'n' if and only if it is
    # homeomorphic to an 'n-od'.

    # An 'n-od' is a space formed by joining 'n' arcs at a single common endpoint.
    # For n=4, this is a '4-od', which looks like a '+' or 'X' shape.

    # The question asks for the number of homeomorphism classes for which D(X) = 4.
    n = 4

    # According to the theorem, D(X) = 4 if and only if X is a 4-od.

    # All 4-ods are homeomorphic to each other. This means they all belong to
    # a single, unique homeomorphism class.

    # Therefore, the number of such classes is 1.
