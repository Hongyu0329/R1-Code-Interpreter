    "To determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the primary allotropes of phosphorus:** I will list the well-established structural forms of phosphorus.\n2.  **Associate each allotrope with its color:** I will identify the distinct color of each allotrope. The main allotropes are White Phosphorus, Red Phosphorus, Violet Phosphorus, and Black Phosphorus. More recently, Blue Phosphorus has also been synthesized.\n3.  **Count the unique colors:** I will count the number of distinct colors from the list.\n4.  **Present the result in code:** The Python code will store these colors, print each one, and then display the total count in a simple equation format as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the number of distinct colors\n    of phosphorus allotropes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The primary allotropes of phosphorus and their distinct colors\n    colors = [\n        \"White\",  # White Phosphorus (can also appear yellowish)\n        \"Red\",    # Red Phosphorus\n        \"Violet\", # Violet (Hittorf's) Phosphorus\n        \"Black\",  # Black Phosphorus\n        \"Blue\"    # Blue Phosphorus (a 2D allotrope)\n    ]\n    \n    # Get the unique set of colors and count them\n    unique_colors = sorted(list(set(colors)))\n    count = len(unique_colors)\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are:\")\n    for color in unique_colors:\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n\n    # Displaying the count as a simple addition equation\n    # 1 (White) + 1 (Red) + 1 (Violet) + 1 (Black) + 1 (Blue)\n    equation_parts = [\"1\" for _ in unique_colors]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of colors is based on this count:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {count}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n<<<5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
