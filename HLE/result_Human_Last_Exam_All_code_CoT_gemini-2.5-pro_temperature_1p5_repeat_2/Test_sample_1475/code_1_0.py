    """
    Solves the mathematical problem about the cardinality of a residual set in a hyperspace.

    The analysis based on the Baire Category Theorem and descriptive set theory
    shows that the set in question, which is an intersection of countably many
    open dense subsets of P(X), is a dense G_delta subset of P(X).

    The space P(X) is a perfect, topologically complete metric space. Any such
    residual set in P(X) must have the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by 'c'.

    The cardinality 'c' is equal to 2 to the power of aleph-null (the cardinality
    of the natural numbers). This can be written as the equation:
    
    Cardinality = 2 ^ Aleph_0

    This script will print this conclusion and the numbers present in this final equation.
