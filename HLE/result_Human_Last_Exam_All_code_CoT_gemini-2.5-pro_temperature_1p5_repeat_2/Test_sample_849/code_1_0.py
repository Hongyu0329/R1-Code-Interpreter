# The problem describes a model, M, facing irreducible uncertainty because the set
# of successful predictors is uncomputable. This means M cannot know a priori which
# predictor to trust. A "safe goal" must be a strategy that is robust to this
# fundamental limitation.
#
# The learning strategy:
# Given that M can generate multiple predictors but cannot identify the single best one,
# a robust and safe strategy is to combine all of them. This is known as "Ensemble learning".
# It mitigates risk by not depending on a single, potentially flawed, hypothesis.
#
# The source of learning:
# The model M learns by generating and observing the entire set of predictors available to it.
# The prompt explicitly calls these "computable predictors". This is the pool of resources
# from which the ensemble is built and refined.
#
# Therefore, the safe goal is to engage in Ensemble learning using the set of all
# available computable predictors.
