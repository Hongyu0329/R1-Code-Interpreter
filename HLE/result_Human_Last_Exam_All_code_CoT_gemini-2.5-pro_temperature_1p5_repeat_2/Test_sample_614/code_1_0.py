# This script solves the riddle by deducing the numbers' values and then their positions.

# Step 1: Assign values to the labels from the riddle.
# Based on clues like "best", "strongest", "weakest", and "never had a thing",
# we can deduce the values for the five natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
value_for_label_1 = 1  # The "weakest" (smallest positive)
value_for_label_2 = 4  # The "best" (largest)
value_for_label_3 = 3  # The "strongest" (second largest)
value_for_label_4 = 2  # The remaining number
value_for_label_5 = 0  # The "fifth, who never had a thing"

# Step 2: Use positional clues to arrange the numbers.
# "Number 1 is the first..."
pos1 = value_for_label_1

# "...the fifth, who never had a thing and lastly follows."
pos5 = value_for_label_5

# "Number three is the strongest and it protects the last;"
pos4 = value_for_label_3

# "Number 4 ... always goes behind [Number 2]."
# This means the pair (value_for_label_2, value_for_label_4) which is (4, 2)
# must occupy the remaining second and third positions.
pos2 = value_for_label_2
pos3 = value_for_label_4

# The final ordered sequence is constructed from these positions.
print("The final ordered sequence is:")
print(f"{pos1}, {pos2}, {pos3}, {pos4}, {pos5}")
<<<1, 4, 2, 3, 0>>>
