    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic calculation in the study of critical phenomena using the Renormalization Group. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **State the Beta Function:** The starting point is the one-loop beta function, `β(u)`, for the dimensionless coupling `u` in the `phi^4` theory. This function describes how the coupling changes with the energy scale. In `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, this function is known.\n2.  **Find the Fixed Point:** A fixed point, denoted `u*`, represents a scale-invariant point where the coupling `u` ceases to change. Mathematically, this corresponds to a zero of the beta function, i.e., `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **Solve for u\\*:** I will set up the equation `β(u*) = 0` and solve for `u*`. This equation has two solutions: a trivial one (`u* = 0`, the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial one (`u* ≠ 0`, the Wilson-Fisher fixed point). The question is asking for the latter.\n4.  **Present the Code:** I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to perform this symbolic calculation and print the resulting expression for `u*` in terms of `ϵ`. The script will clearly show the equation being solved and its solution, highlighting each numerical component as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# This script calculates the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point\n# in phi^4 theory using the epsilon expansion.\n\n# 1. Define symbolic variables for the coupling (u), the expansion parameter (epsilon), and pi.\nu, epsilon, pi = sympy.symbols('u epsilon pi')\n\n# 2. Define the one-loop beta function in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions.\n# The term -epsilon*u arises from the canonical dimension of the coupling.\n# The term +3*u**2/(16*pi**2) is the one-loop quantum correction.\nbeta_function = -epsilon * u + (3 * u**2) / (16 * pi**2)\n\nprint(\"The one-loop beta function is: beta(u) = -epsilon*u + 3*u**2 / (16*pi**2)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\n# 3. Find the fixed points u* by solving the equation beta(u*) = 0.\nfixed_points = sympy.solve(beta_function, u)\n\n# 4. The solver returns a list of solutions. We are interested in the non-trivial one.\n# We filter out the trivial solution u=0.\nu_star_nontrivial = None\nfor sol in fixed_points:\n    if sol != 0:\n        u_star_nontrivial = sol\n        break\n\nprint(\"A fixed point u* is a value where beta(u*) = 0.\")\nprint(f\"Solving the equation '{beta_function} = 0' for u gives two solutions:\")\nprint(f\"1. Trivial (Gaussian) fixed point: u* = 0\")\nprint(f\"2. Non-trivial (Wilson-Fisher) fixed point: u* = {u_star_nontrivial}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\n# 5. Extract the components of the non-trivial solution to display the final equation clearly.\n# The expression is of the form: (numerator/denominator) * pi**power * epsilon\ncoeff = u_star_nontrivial / (pi**2 * epsilon)\nnumerator, denominator = coeff.as_numer_denom()\npower = sympy.degree(u_star_nontrivial, pi) # This will be 2\n\nprint(\"The leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling u* is:\")\n# Final print statement showing the equation with numbers.\nprint(f\"u* = ({numerator} * pi^{power} / {denominator}) * epsilon\")\n```\n<<<(16 * pi**2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
