# Explanation of the final equation for clarity.
# Let N be the number of components of F that are nondegenerate and locally connected.
# Our analysis shows that N can be 0.
# For example, if F is the empty set, F satisfies the relation and has N=0 components.
# If F is the non-empty attractor, F is not locally connected, which implies no component meets the criteria under a strict interpretation.
# This also results in N=0.
# Therefore, the smallest possible value for N is 0.
