def solve_cohomology_dimension():
    """
    Computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T.

    This function applies the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology to the
    direct product of Thompson's group T with itself.

    Key mathematical facts used:
    1.  Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology (with real coefficients):
        For groups G1 and G2, and degree n,
        dim(H_b^n(G1 x G2; R)) = sum_{p+q=n} dim(H_b^p(G1; R)) * dim(H_b^q(G2; R)).

    2.  Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T:
        Thompson's group T is "b-acyclic", which means its bounded cohomology
        groups with trivial real coefficients (H_b^k(T; R)) are trivial for
        positive degrees.
        - dim(H_b^0(T; R)) = 1 (This is true for any group).
        - dim(H_b^k(T; R)) = 0 for all k >= 1.
