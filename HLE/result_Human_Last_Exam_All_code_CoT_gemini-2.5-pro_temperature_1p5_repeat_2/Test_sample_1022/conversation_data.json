    "To solve this problem, I will use established theorems from the field of geometric group theory, specifically concerning the bounded cohomology of groups.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology, which relates the cohomology of a direct product of groups, like $T \\times T$, to the cohomology of the individual groups.\n2.  I will use a key property of Thompson's group $T$: it is known to be **b-acyclic**. This property determines the dimensions of its bounded cohomology groups with real coefficients.\n3.  I will translate these mathematical facts into the specific dimension values for the bounded cohomology groups of $T$, i.e., the values of $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$ for the required degrees $k$.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script to perform the calculation based on the Künneth formula. The script will explicitly show the formula, substitute the dimension values, and compute the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_cohomology_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T.\n\n    This function applies the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology to the\n    direct product of Thompson's group T with itself.\n\n    Key mathematical facts used:\n    1.
