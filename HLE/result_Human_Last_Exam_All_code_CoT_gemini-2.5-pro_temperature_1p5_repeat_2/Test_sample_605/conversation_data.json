    "To determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical object:** The problem describes a Calabi-Yau threefold, which is a hypersurface in a 4-dimensional weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$.\n2.  **Extract the weights:** The weights of the ambient space are given as $w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n3.  **Determine the degree of the hypersurface:** For a hypersurface to be a Calabi-Yau manifold, the degree of its defining polynomial, denoted by `d`, must equal the sum of the weights of the projective space. The given polynomial $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$ is not perfectly quasi-homogeneous; most of its terms have a weighted degree of 225, but one term ($z_1^4z_2^3z_3$) has a degree of 224. The sum of the weights is $22+29+49+50+75 = 225$. Based on the standard construction of these manifolds, we will assume the term with degree 224 is a typo in the problem statement and that the correct degree is $d = 225$.\n4.  **State the formula for the invariant:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant is the intersection number of the second Chern class of the manifold with the hyperplane class, denoted $c_2 \\cdot H$. For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, ..., w_5)$, this is given by the formula:\n    $$ N_{CN} = \\frac{d \\cdot \\sigma_2}{\\prod_{i=1}^5 w_i} $$\n    where $d = \\sum w_i$ is the degree (also the first elementary symmetric polynomial, $\\sigma_1$), and $\\sigma_2 = \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le 5} w_i w_j$ is the second elementary symmetric polynomial of the weights.\n5.  **Compute the components and the final value:** I will write a Python script to calculate $d$, $\\sigma_2$, the product of the weights, and then combine them using the formula to find the invariant. The script will print the values at each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# This script calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau\n# hypersurface in a weighted projective space.\n\n# Step 1: Define the weights of the ambient space.\nweights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n# Step 2: Determine the degree 'd' of the hypersurface.\n# For a Calabi-Yau manifold, the degree equals the sum of the weights. We assume\n# the given polynomial has a typo and its degree 'd' is the sum of the weights.\n# This sum is also the first elementary symmetric polynomial, sigma_1.\nd = sum(weights)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the second elementary symmetric polynomial of the weights, sigma_2.\nsigma_2 = sum(i * j for i, j in itertools.combinations(weights, 2))\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the product of the weights.\nprod_w = 1\nfor w in weights:\n    prod_w *= w\n\n# Step 5: Apply the formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n# N_CN = (d * sigma_2) / (product of weights)\nnumerator = d * sigma_2\ndenominator = prod_w\n\n# Simplify the resulting fraction for the final answer.\nfinal_fraction = Fraction(numerator, denominator)\n\n# Print out all the numbers involved in the final equation.\nprint(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant N_CN is calculated using the formula:\")\nprint(\"N_CN = (d * sigma_2) / (w1 * w2 * w3 * w4 * w5)\\n\")\nprint(f\"The weights are: {weights}\")\nprint(f\"The degree d = sigma_1 = {weights[0]} + {weights[1]} + {weights[2]} + {weights[3]} + {weights[4]} = {d}\")\nprint(f\"The second symmetric polynomial sigma_2 is {sigma_2}\")\nprint(f\"The product of the weights is {weights[0]} * {weights[1]} * {weights[2]} * {weights[3]} * {weights[4]} = {denominator}\\n\")\nprint(\"The final equation with these values is:\")\nprint(f\"N_CN = ({d} * {sigma_2}) / {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"     = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"     = {final_fraction.numerator}/{final_fraction.denominator}\")\n<<<58161/1563100>>>"
