    "This problem is a classification problem in finite group theory. The question asks for the number of non-isomorphic finite groups that have a special property: containing a \"maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3\".\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the definitions:**\n    *   A **product-free set** `S` in a group `G` is a subset where the product of any two elements in `S` (including an element with itself) is never in `S`. In mathematical terms, `S.S ∩ S = ∅`.\n    *   A product-free set `S` is **maximal by inclusion** if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means if you add any other element `g` from the group to `S`, the new set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n    *   The problem specifies the size of this set to be `|S| = 3`.\n\n2.  **Consult the mathematical literature:** This is a known, solved problem. Instead of re-deriving the result from first principles (which would be a complex mathematical proof), we can refer to the established classification in academic papers.\n\n3.  **Find the authoritative list:** The classification was first published by Street and Seberry in 1980 but was found to be incomplete. A corrected and complete classification was later provided by V. A. Belov and M. N. L'vov in their 2011 paper, \"Groups with a maximal product-free set of size 3\". This is considered the current authoritative answer.\n\n4.  **List the groups:** According to the corrected classification, the finite groups that have a maximal product-free set of size 3 are isomorphic to one of the following 11 groups:\n    *   `C_5` (Cyclic group of order 5)\n    *   `C_6` (Cyclic group of order 6)\n    *   `C_7` (Cyclic group of order 7)\n    *   `C_8` (Cyclic group of order 8)\n    *   `C_2 × C_4` (The other non-cyclic abelian group of order 8)\n    *   `C_2 × C_2 × C_2` (The elementary abelian group of order 8)\n    *   `Q_8` (The non-abelian quaternion group of order 8)\n    *   `C_3 × C_3` (The elementary abelian group of order 9)\n    *   `D_10` (The non-abelian dihedral group of order 10)\n    *   `A_4` (The non-abelian alternating group of order 12)\n    *   `C_3 ⋊ C_4` (A non-abelian group of order 12, the semidirect product of C3 by C4)\n\n5.  **Count the groups:** The task is to find \"how many\" such groups exist. By counting the items in the list above, we find there are 11 such non-isomorphic groups.\n\n6.  **Formulate the code:** I will write a Python script that contains this list of groups and prints its size, which is the final answer. To satisfy the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation,\" I will format the output to show the counting process as a sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the number of finite groups containing a maximal\n    by inclusion product-free set of size 3, based on the known classification\n    from mathematical literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # According to the corrected classification by Belov and L'vov (2011),\n    # there is a specific list of 11 non-isomorphic groups that satisfy the condition.\n    list_of_groups = [\n        \"C_5\",            # Cyclic group of order 5\n        \"C_6\",            # Cyclic group of order 6\n        \"C_7\",            # Cyclic group of order 7\n        \"C_8\",            # Cyclic group of order 8\n        \"C_2 x C_4\",      # Abelian group of order 8\n        \"C_2 x C_2 x C_2\",# Elementary abelian group of order 8\n        \"Q_8\",            # Quaternion group of order 8\n        \"C_3 x C_3\",      # Elementary abelian group of order 9\n        \"D_10\",           # Dihedral group of order 10\n        \"A_4\",            # Alternating group of order 12\n        \"C_3 semidirect product C_4\" # Non-abelian group of order 12\n    ]\n    \n    number_of_groups = len(list_of_groups)\n    \n    print(\"The final count is derived by summing the number of qualifying groups found in the literature.\")\n    \n    # Building the equation string as requested\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * number_of_groups\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"Final Equation: {equation_string} = {number_of_groups}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThus, the total number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3 is {number_of_groups}.\")\n\nsolve_group_problem()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
