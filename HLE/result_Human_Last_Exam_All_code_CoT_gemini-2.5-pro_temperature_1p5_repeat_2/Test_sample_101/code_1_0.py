    Hidi and Renninger's Four-Phase Interest Model describes the development of interest from fleeting attention to a deep, self-driven passion. The question asks who benefits most long-term from concrete, next-step-oriented feedback.

    Let's analyze the options:

    *   A. Triggered Situational Interest: A student in this phase has a fleeting interest. While feedback might be helpful in the moment, it's unlikely to have a significant long-term impact because the initial interest itself is not stable.

    *   B. Maintained Situational Interest: This student's interest is dependent on external factors like the teacher or task design. Concrete feedback helps them succeed in the current situation, which is positive, but the key to long-term interest development is shifting the motivation from external to internal.

    *   C. Emerging Individual Interest: This is the most critical phase for the type of feedback described. The student is beginning to engage voluntarily and value the topic for themselves but may not yet have the skills or knowledge to pursue this interest effectively. They are actively seeking ways to get better. Concrete feedback that provides "immediate next steps" gives them a clear, actionable pathway. This builds their competence and self-efficacy, directly fostering the transition from a situational interest to a stable, individual one. This empowerment is what leads to a significant long-term impact.

    *   D. Well-Developed Individual Interest: A student at this stage is already largely self-directed and can sustain their own engagement. While they still benefit from feedback, it's often more about nuanced, higher-level challenges rather than basic next steps. Their interest is already well-developed, so the feedback has less of an impact on its fundamental development.

    *   E. "Good for every student": While true to an extent, this option misses the nuance of the question, which asks who is *most likely* to experience a *significant long-term impact*. The model suggests different stages have different needs, making this a less precise answer.

    Therefore, the student with an emerging individual interest is at the perfect junction to internalize and use this specific type of feedback for significant long-term growth.
