# The problem asks for the value of a limit, which can be determined by the theoretical arguments above.
# Let C be the limiting density of the sausage.
# C = lim_{n->inf} V_n
# Based on the reasoning, the process X_t is locally approximated by a neighborhood-recurrent
# 2D Brownian motion with drift. This implies that the sausage will eventually cover
# any region far from the origin.
# Thus, the limiting density C is 1.

C = 1

# We need to find lim_{n->inf} P(V_n > 2/3).
# Since V_n converges in probability to C=1, for any epsilon > 0,
# P(|V_n - 1| < epsilon) approaches 1 as n -> inf.
# Let's choose epsilon = 1/3.
# P(|V_n - 1| < 1/3) -> 1
# This is equivalent to P(2/3 < V_n < 4/3) -> 1.
# Since V_n is a ratio of areas, V_n <= 1, so this is P(2/3 < V_n <= 1) -> 1.
# This implies P(V_n > 2/3) -> 1.
