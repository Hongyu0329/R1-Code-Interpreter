# Final Answer Calculation
# 1. Unique Implication Points (UIPs): The UIPs are the nodes at the conflict level (3)
#    that dominate the conflict node. These are not x6@3 and the decision literal x2@3.
#    To avoid ambiguity with the comma separator, we use a semicolon.
uips = "not x6@3; x2@3"

# 2. First UIP: The UIP closest to the conflict node is not x6@3.
first_uip = "not x6@3"

# 3. Learned Clause: The 1UIP scheme produces the clause x1 or x6.
learned_clause = "x1 or x6"

# 4. Backtracking Level: The backtrack level is the second highest decision level
#    in the learned clause {x1 (level 1), x6 (level 3)}, which is 1.
backtrack_level = 1

# Final output string as per the requested format
final_answer = f"{uips}, {first_uip}, {learned_clause}, {backtrack_level}"
