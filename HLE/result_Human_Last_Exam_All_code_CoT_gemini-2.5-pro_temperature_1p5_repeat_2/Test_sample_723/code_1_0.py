    print("Conclusion 1: The host's 'xy' gene product is part of a defense mechanism that is effective only when pathogen factors A and B are both absent.")
    print("Conclusion 2: Therefore, virulence factors A and B must act to deactivate the host's 'xy' protein. Both A and B are involved in this function.\n")

    # Step 3: Analyze the role of pathogen factor C
    print("--- Analysis of Virulence Factor C ---")
    print(f"Observation: In wild-type mice (wtL), deleting pathogen factor C (ΔC) reduces the bacterial count to {data['wtL']['ΔC']}.")

    print("Conclusion 3: The virulence function of factor C is independent of the host's 'xy' gene pathway, as its removal reduces bacterial count regardless of whether 'xy' is present or not.\n")

    print(f"This is TRUE. As concluded from the ΔAΔB experiment (counts {data['wtL']['ΔAΔB']} in wtL vs {data['-xyL']['ΔAΔB']} in -xyL), both A and B are responsible for deactivating the 'xy' defense pathway.")

    # Evaluate the second part of Choice F
    print(f"\nPart 2: 'virulence factor C does not target the same host proteins as virulence factor A'")
    print(f"This is TRUE. We deduced that A targets the 'xy' pathway. We also deduced that C's function is independent of the 'xy' pathway (counts are {data['wtL']['ΔC']} in wtL and {data['-xyL']['ΔC']} in -xyL). Therefore, A and C target different host pathways/proteins.")
