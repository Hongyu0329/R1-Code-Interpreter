    "Answering this question involves understanding the different evolutionary fates a gene can have after a duplication event. The question specifically asks for a mechanism that accounts for both the **retention** of the duplicate gene and its **divergence** from the original copy.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that evaluates each of the given answer choices against these two criteria (retention and divergence).\n\n1.  **Analyze the options:** I will assess each option's role in gene evolution.\n2.  **Eliminate incorrect options:** I will filter out choices that do not lead to the retention of two functional, divergent genes.\n    *   **Gene conversion** leads to homogenization, which is the opposite of divergence.\n    *   **Pseudogenization** leads to the loss of function, which is the opposite of retention.\n    *   **Adaptive radiation** is a macroevolutionary concept concerning species, not a molecular mechanism for genes.\n3.  **Compare the plausible options:** This will leave two main models: **Neofunctionalization** and **Subfunctionalization**. I will explain both.\n4.  **Justify the final choice:** I will argue which of the two is \"most likely\". Subfunctionalization relies on common degenerative mutations to make both gene copies necessary, providing a high-probability path to retention. Neofunctionalization relies on rare beneficial mutations. Therefore, subfunctionalization can be argued as a more frequent or likely mechanism for initially preserving duplicate genes from being lost.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the potential fates of duplicated genes to determine the most likely mechanism\n    for their retention and divergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the mechanisms for duplicate gene retention and divergence:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe question asks for the most likely mechanism that explains how duplicate genes are both kept (retention) and become different (divergence) in a genome.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Evaluating the Answer Choices ---\")\n    \n    # Analysis of each option\n    print(\"\\nA.

Neofunctionalization: In this model, one copy retains its original function, while the second copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function.

Subfunctionalization: In this model, the original ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns. After duplication, each copy loses complementary functions through mutation, such that both copies become required to carry out the full original repertoire.

Adaptive radiation: This is a macroevolutionary pattern describing the rapid diversification of species into new ecological niches. It is not a molecular mechanism acting on genes.

This can be interpreted in terms of the probability of the events required for each model.\")\n    print(\"Subfunctionalization is driven by degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations, which are relatively common. Once complementary functions are lost in each copy, selection immediately acts to preserve both genes.\")\n    print(\"Neofunctionalization, on the other hand, requires a specific and rare beneficial (gain-of-function) mutation to occur in the redundant copy before it succumbs to pseudogenization.\")\n    print(\"Because the underlying mutations are more frequent, subfunctionalization provides a more probable and immediate pathway for locking in both gene copies. For this reason, it is often considered a very likely mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes.\")\n\nsolve_gene_duplication_question()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
