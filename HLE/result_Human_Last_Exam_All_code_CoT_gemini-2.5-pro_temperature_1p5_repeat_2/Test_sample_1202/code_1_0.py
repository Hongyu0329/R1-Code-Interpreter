    print("\nA. Gene conversion: This process makes homologous sequences more similar or identical. It actively works AGAINST divergence. Thus, it is incorrect.")
    
    print("\nB. Pseudogenization: This is the process where a duplicate gene accumulates mutations that make it non-functional. While this is a very common fate and the sequence does diverge, it does not result in the RETENTION of a functional gene pair. Thus, it is incorrect.")

    print("\nC. Neofunctionalization: In this model, one copy retains its original function, while the second copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. This explains both retention and divergence. It is a plausible answer.")

    print("\nD. Subfunctionalization: In this model, the original ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns. After duplication, each copy loses complementary functions through mutation, such that both copies become required to carry out the full original repertoire. This also explains both retention and divergence. It is a plausible answer.")

    print("\nE. Adaptive radiation: This is a macroevolutionary pattern describing the rapid diversification of species into new ecological niches. It is not a molecular mechanism acting on genes. Thus, it is incorrect.")

    print("Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes.")
    print("However, the question asks for the 'most likely' mechanism. This can be interpreted in terms of the probability of the events required for each model.")
    print("Subfunctionalization is driven by degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations, which are relatively common. Once complementary functions are lost in each copy, selection immediately acts to preserve both genes.")
    print("Neofunctionalization, on the other hand, requires a specific and rare beneficial (gain-of-function) mutation to occur in the redundant copy before it succumbs to pseudogenization.")
    print("Because the underlying mutations are more frequent, subfunctionalization provides a more probable and immediate pathway for locking in both gene copies. For this reason, it is often considered a very likely mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes.")
