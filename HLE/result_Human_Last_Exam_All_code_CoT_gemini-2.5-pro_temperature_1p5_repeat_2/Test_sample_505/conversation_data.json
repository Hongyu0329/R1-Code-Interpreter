    "For a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is equal to the number of holes (or boundaries, excluding the outer boundary) created within the patch. Since we have two separate patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define a variable for the number of holes in each patch.\n2.  The number of logical qubits in one patch is equal to the number of holes.\n3.  Calculate the total number of logical qubits by summing the qubits from the two identical patches.\n4.  Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_qubit_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for the given surface code configuration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of holes in each of the two patches\n    holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # For a single planar patch of surface code, the number of logical qubits\n    # is equal to the number of holes.\n    qubits_in_patch_1 = holes_per_patch\n    qubits_in_patch_2 = holes_per_patch\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum from the two separate patches.\n    total_logical_qubits = qubits_in_patch_1 + qubits_in_patch_2\n\n    print(\"The number of logical qubits in a single surface code patch is equal to the number of holes.\")\n    print(f\"Number of qubits in the first patch = {qubits_in_patch_1}\")\n    print(f\"Number of qubits in the second patch = {qubits_in_patch_2}\")\n    print(\"\\nTotal logical qubits are the sum from both patches:\")\n    print(f\"{qubits_in_patch_1} + {qubits_in_patch_2} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n\nsolve_qubit_count()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
