    explanation = """The best move for White is a8=Q.

**Analysis:**

1.  **The Core Idea:** The central theme of this position is White's powerful passed pawn on a7. Black's knight on b6 is the only piece that can prevent this pawn from promoting. White's most effective strategy is to eliminate this key defender.

2.  **The Winning Sacrifice:** The move `a8=Q` forces the issue. It promotes the pawn, and Black has no choice but to capture it with `1...Nxa8`. Allowing a queen on the board would be instantly losing.

3.  **Transition to a Winning Endgame:** After the sequence `1. a8=Q Nxa8`, the position simplifies into a King and Knight endgame. Although the material is roughly equal in terms of points, White's position is completely dominant. Black's knight is gone, and White's knight is now free to become a major attacking piece.

4.  **The Follow-up:** White's winning continuation is `2. Nc5`. This single move cripples Black's position by:
    *   Attacking the weak pawn on e6.
    *   Controlling key squares.
    *   Restricting the movement of the black king.

Black has no good defense, and White's king can then join the attack to secure the win. This line is the most direct and forceful way to convert White's advantage.

The principal variation is:
