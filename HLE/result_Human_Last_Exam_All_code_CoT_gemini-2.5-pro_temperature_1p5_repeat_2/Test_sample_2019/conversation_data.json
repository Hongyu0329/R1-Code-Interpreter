    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to place 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal (wrap-around) board such that no two queens attack each other.\n\n### My thinking process\n\n1.  **Define \"non-attacking\" on a toroidal board:**\n    Let the positions of the 4 queens be `(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)`. For any two queens at `(ri, ci)` and `(rj, cj)`, the non-attacking conditions are:\n    *   **Row:** `ri ≠ rj`\n    *   **Column:** `ci ≠ cj`\n    *   **Diagonals:** The wrap-around nature of the board means diagonal attacks occur when `(ri - ci) % 5 == (rj - cj) % 5` or `(ri + ci) % 5 == (rj + cj) % 5`.\n\n2.  **Devise a counting strategy:**\n    Instead of checking every possible placement of 4 queens on the 25 squares (which is C(25, 4) = 12,650), we can use a more structured, combinatorial approach.\n    *   Since the 4 queens must be in different rows and columns, our first step is to choose which 4 rows and which 4 columns they will occupy.\n    *   The number of ways to choose 4 rows from 5 is `C(5, 4) = 5`.\n    *   The number of ways to choose 4 columns from 5 is `C(5, 4) = 5`.\n    *   For a fixed set of 4 rows and 4 columns, we need to determine how many ways we can assign a unique column to each row to form a valid placement. This is equivalent to finding the number of \"valid permutations\".\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the toroidal board, the number of valid permutations is the same regardless of which 4 rows and 4 columns we choose. For example, the number of solutions on rows {0,1,2,3} and columns {0,1,2,3} is the same as on rows {1,2,3,4} and columns {0,1,2,3}.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of ways is:\n        `(Ways to choose 4 rows) * (Ways to choose 4 columns) * (Number of valid permutations)`\n\n3.  **Implement the plan:**\n    I will write a Python script to calculate the number of valid permutations for a canonical choice of rows and columns (e.g., rows `(0, 1, 2, 3)` and columns `(0, 1, 2, 3)`). Then, I'll multiply this by the number of ways to choose the rows and columns to get the final answer. The script will print out each component of the final multiplication.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nfrom math import comb\n\ndef count_valid_permutations(rows, cols, board_size=5):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of valid queen placements for a fixed set of rows and columns.\n    A placement is valid if no two queens attack each other on the diagonals.\n    \n    Args:\n        rows (tuple): A tuple of row indices.\n        cols (tuple): A tuple of column indices.\n        board_size (int): The size of the board (N for an NxN board).\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The number of valid permutations.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_queens = len(rows)\n    valid_perms_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through all possible assignments of columns to the fixed rows\n    for p_cols in itertools.permutations(cols):\n        # A placement is a list of (row, column) coordinates\n        placement = list(zip(rows, p_cols))\n        \n        # Check for main diagonal attacks\n        main_diags = set((r - c) % board_size for r, c in placement)\n        if len(main_diags) < num_queens:\n            continue\n            \n        # Check for anti-diagonal attacks\n        anti_diags = set((r + c) % board_size for r, c in placement)\n        if len(anti_diags) < num_queens:\n            continue\n            \n        # If no diagonal attacks, this is a valid permutation\n        valid_perms_count += 1\n        \n    return valid_perms_count\n\n# Define board parameters\nBOARD_SIZE = 5\nNUM_QUEENS = 4\n\n# 1.
