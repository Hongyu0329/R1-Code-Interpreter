def solve_billet_cutting():
    """
    Calculates the maximum value from cutting a steel billet based on a
    literal interpretation of the provided problem formulation.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Analyze the constraints. A key finding is that B2 balls and T1 cubes cannot coexist
       in a valid solution due to a conflicting non-overlapping constraint.
    2. This splits the problem into two scenarios:
        a) Packing B2 and B1 pieces.
        b) Packing T1 and B1 pieces.
    3. Calculate the maximum value for each scenario.
        a) For B2+B1, prioritize the high-value B2s. A packing of 8 B2s is possible.
           The remaining volume is calculated, and it can fit 64 B1s.
        b) For T1+B1, the constraints on T1 are so restrictive that packing the billet
           with only B1s yields a much higher value than any T1 combination.
    4. Compare the total values from both scenarios and select the maximum.
