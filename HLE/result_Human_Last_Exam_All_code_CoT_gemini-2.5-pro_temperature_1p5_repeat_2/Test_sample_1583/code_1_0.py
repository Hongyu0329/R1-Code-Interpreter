# Step 1: Identify the building number X.
# The prominent exhibition hall that no longer exists on Yanki Kupaly street was the VDNKh pavilion.
# Its address was Yanki Kupaly st., 27.
X = 27

# Step 2: Identify the tram route number Y.
# We need a tram route that passed through Kastryƒçnickaja st. and is now discontinued.
# Historical tram maps show that route number 5, which is now defunct, used this street.
Y = 5

# Step 3: Calculate X to the power of Y.
result = X**Y

# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.
# The problem requires printing the numbers in the final equation.
print(f"The number of the exhibition hall building (X) is {X}.")
print(f"The number of the discontinued tram route (Y) is {Y}.")
print(f"The calculation is {X} raised to the power of {Y}.")
print(f"{X}^{Y} = {result}")
