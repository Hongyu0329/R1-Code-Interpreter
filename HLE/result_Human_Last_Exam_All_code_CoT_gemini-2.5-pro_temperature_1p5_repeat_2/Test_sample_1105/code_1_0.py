    # Step 1: Define the symbolic variables for the problem.

    # Step 2: Use the Work-Energy Theorem to set up the governing equation.
    # The change in total energy is equal to the work done by the non-conservative force F.

    # Rearranging this gives a quadratic equation for l_max:
    # F*l_max**2 - (F*l_0 + G*m*M/l_0 - 1/2*M*v_0**2)*l_max + G*m*M = 0

    # Step 3: Define the coefficients of the quadratic equation a*x**2 + b*x + c = 0,
