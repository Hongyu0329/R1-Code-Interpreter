    "This is a linguistic and historical question rather than a coding problem. The name \"Odobeccus\" is a Latinized form of a Germanic (likely Frankish) name, not a purely Gaulish one. The historical figure Odobeccus (also known as Edobichus) was a 5th-century military commander.\n\nTo find the French equivalent, we look at how French historical texts refer to this individual. The name is typically Francized directly. I will provide a simple Python script that prints this equivalent.\n\n```python\ndef find_french_equivalent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the French equivalent for the historical name 'Odobeccus'.\n    \"\"\"\n    gaulish_name = \"Odobeccus\"\n    # The name is often rendered as Edobichus in Latin, and its direct\n    # Francization used by historians is \"Édobic\".\n    french_equivalent = \"Édobic\"\n\n    print(f\"The historical French equivalent of the name '{gaulish_name}' is '{french_equivalent}'.\")\n\nfind_french_equivalent()\n```\n<<<Édobic>>>"
