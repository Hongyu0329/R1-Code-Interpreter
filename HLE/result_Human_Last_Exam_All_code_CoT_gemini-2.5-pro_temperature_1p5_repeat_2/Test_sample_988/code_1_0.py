    # Reasoning for the correct choice:
    # 1. Enzymatic antioxidants like Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) are proteins
    #    that catalytically neutralize ROS with very high efficiency.
    # 2. These enzymes form a rapid-response system. SOD converts the highly reactive superoxide radical
    #    into hydrogen peroxide, and CAT then quickly breaks down hydrogen peroxide into harmless water and oxygen.
    # 3. This enzymatic cascade is the cell's most direct and immediate defense against a sudden
    #    burst of ROS, which is characteristic of acute stress like high temperature exposure.
    # 4. Other responses, like synthesizing new antioxidant molecules (liposoluble or hydrosoluble) or
    #    altering pigment concentrations, are slower acclimation processes.
