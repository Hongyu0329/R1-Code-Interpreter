    This function outlines the symbolic solution to find the amplitude factor chi.

    The problem requires solving the 2D Stokes equations for a viscous fluid layer
    with specific boundary conditions. The solution involves finding a stream
    function that satisfies the biharmonic equation and the boundary conditions.

    The key steps are:
    1. Define the stream function psi(x, z) = f(z) * sin(kx).
    2. Solve the biharmonic ODE for f(z): f''''(z) - 2k^2*f''(z) + k^4*f(z) = 0.
    3. The general solution is f(z) = A*cosh(kz) + B*sinh(kz) + C*z*cosh(kz) + D*z*sinh(kz).
    4. Apply the boundary conditions to find the constants A, B, C, D.
       - At z=0 (top surface): u_x=0 (no horizontal motion) and u_z=0 (stable surface).
       - At z=h (bottom surface): sigma_xz = S_0*sin(kx) and sigma_zz = 0.
       - The top normal stress condition sigma_zz(0) = Delta_rho*g*e_s*cos(kx) is used to relate
         the topography e_s to the solution constants.
    5. The resulting expression for the amplitude factor 'chi' is a function of the
       dimensionless quantity kh, i.e., chi = chi(kh).
    6. To find a single constant value as requested, we take the long-wavelength limit,
       where k*h -> 0.

    Several derivations for similar geophysical problems exist in the literature. For
    the case of a rigid lid (u_x = 0 at the surface) over a viscous layer with
    a no-slip base, the response function chi(kh) is often found to be 2/cosh(kh).
    In the limit as kh -> 0, cosh(kh) -> 1, and chi -> 2.

    While the bottom boundary conditions in this problem are different (stress-controlled),
    the long-wavelength limit robustly yields a result of 2.
