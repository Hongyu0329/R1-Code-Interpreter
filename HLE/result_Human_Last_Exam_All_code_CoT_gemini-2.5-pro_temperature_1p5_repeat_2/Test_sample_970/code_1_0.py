def solve_bayesian_assumptions():
    """
    This function determines the necessary assumptions for a Bayesian agent's
    expected information gain to converge to zero and formats the answer
    in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The proof of convergence can follow two main paths:
       a) Information-Theoretic Bound: If the prior distribution over models has finite entropy,
          the total amount of information that can be gained is finite. A finite sum of
          non-negative expected information gains implies the terms must go to zero.
          Thus, (a) is a sufficient condition.
       c) Stability of Observation Process: If the agent's policy leads to a convergent
          state occupancy distribution, the agent is essentially learning from a stationary
          source. In this case, the posterior distribution will converge, which in turn
          implies the information gain between subsequent steps will go to zero.
          Thus, (c) is a sufficient condition.
          
    2. Necessity: Since either (a) or (c) is sufficient for a proof, neither is
       individually necessary. A scenario where convergence might fail is when *both* are
       false: an agent with infinite prior uncertainty exploring a perpetually novel
       environment. To guarantee convergence, one must assume that at least one of
       these conditions holds.
       
    3. CNF Formulation: The necessary assumption is therefore the logical disjunction (a OR c).
       In CNF, this is represented as a single clause. The literals are ordered alphabetically.
    """
    
    # Define the literals involved
    literal_a = "a"
    literal_c = "c"
    
    # Build the clause in alphabetical order
    clause = f"({literal_a} OR {literal_c})"
    
    # Build the final CNF expression
    cnf_expression = f"[{clause}]"
    
    print(cnf_expression)
