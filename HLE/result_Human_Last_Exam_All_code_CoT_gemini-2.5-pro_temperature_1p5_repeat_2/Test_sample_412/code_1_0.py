    print("   - Option B is the direct nonstandard definition of continuity. It states that for every standard point x₀, f maps the monad of x₀ into the monad of f(x₀). This is equivalent to f being continuous on X.")
    print("   - Option C is the property of S-continuity (or microcontinuity). A fundamental theorem of nonstandard analysis states that a standard function f is continuous if and only if its extension is S-continuous.")
