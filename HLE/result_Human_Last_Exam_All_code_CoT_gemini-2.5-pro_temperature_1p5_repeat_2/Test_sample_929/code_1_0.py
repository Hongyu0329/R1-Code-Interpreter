    """
    Analyzes different insect behavioral patterns to determine which has the
    greatest positive effect on plant fitness, explained through a quantitative model.

    Plant fitness in this context is primarily driven by pollination, which requires
    frequent and effective feeding visits by insects.

    We can model fitness with the following conceptual equation:
    Fitness = (Rate of Feeding Events) * (Efficiency of Pollen Transfer per Visit)

    Let's break this down:
    1.  Rate of Feeding Events: How many times an insect feeds per hour (n(5)/hour).
        This is crucial for cross-pollination between different plants.
    2.  Efficiency of Visit: For each visit (interaction), how much time is spent
        productively feeding? We can model this as (time_feeding / time_interaction).

    Let's assign some baseline values to create a quantitative model:
    - Baseline interaction rate (n(3)/hour) = 10 interactions/hour
    - Baseline investigation rate (n(1)/hour) = 20 investigations/hour (insect is cautious)
    - Probability of feeding during an interaction, p(5|3) = 0.8 (80% of contacts lead to feeding)
    - Baseline rate of feeding (n(5)/hour) = 10 * 0.8 = 8 feeds/hour
    - Baseline interaction duration (4-3) = 2 time units
    - Baseline feeding duration (6-5) = 1 time unit (half the interaction is feeding)

    Baseline Visit Efficiency = (6-5) / (4-3) = 1 / 2 = 0.5
    Baseline Fitness Score = (n(5)/hour) * Efficiency = 8 * 0.5 = 4.0
