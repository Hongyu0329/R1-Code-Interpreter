# The problem is to determine the number of distinct homeomorphism classes
# for a compact space X with specific properties related to the long ray R.

# The properties given are:
# 1. X is a compactification of the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
# 2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends uniquely to a
#    continuous function on X.

# This second property is the universal mapping property that defines the
# Stone-Čech compactification of R, denoted as βR.

# A fundamental theorem in topology states that the Stone-Čech compactification
# of a Tychonoff space (which R is) is unique up to homeomorphism.

# This means that any space X satisfying the given conditions must be
# homeomorphic to βR. Consequently, all such spaces belong to the
# same, single homeomorphism class.

# The equation for the number of classes is simply:
# Number of classes = 1
# because of this uniqueness.

number_of_homeomorphism_classes = 1

# Print the final answer as requested.
print("The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is determined by the uniqueness of the Stone-Čech compactification.")
print(f"Final Answer: {number_of_homeomorphism_classes}")
