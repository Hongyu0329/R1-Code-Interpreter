    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the start and end points of the war according to the lore.\n*   The Second Great War begins with the events of the Brood War expansion, which starts in the year 2500.\n*   The war concludes at the end of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign, with the Battle of Char, which takes place in the year 2504.\n\nNext, I will write a Python script to calculate the difference between the end year (2504) and the start year (2500). The result will be rounded up as requested, even though in this case the duration is a whole number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore starts with the Brood War and ends with Wings of Liberty.\nstart_year = 2500\nend_year = 2504\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# Round up the result as requested\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\nprint(\"Calculating the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\")\nprint(f\"The war began in {start_year} and ended in {end_year}.\")\nprint(\"The calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\nprint(f\"The total duration rounded up is {final_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
