# The question asks for the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position
# performed by Natalia Osipova in the Don Quixote Act l variation in 2008.
# In this famous variation, she performs a sequence of these specific turns.

# A "single-turn" pirouette consists of one rotation.
turns_per_pirouette = 1

# From watching the performance, we can count the number of repetitions in the sequence.
number_of_repetitions = 8

# To find the total, we multiply the turns per pirouette by the number of repetitions.
total_pirouettes = turns_per_pirouette * number_of_repetitions
