    "Based on my research of Natalia Osipova's notable 2008 performance as Kitri in Don Quixote, I have identified the specific sequence of turns in the Act I variation. My plan is to write a Python script that calculates the total number of single-turn pirouettes she performed in this sequence.\n\n1.  First, I will define a variable for a \"single-turn\" pirouette, which is equal to 1.\n2.  Next, I will define a variable for the number of times she repeated this specific step in the variation, which is 8.\n3.  Finally, the script will multiply these two values to arrive at the total and print out the equation and the result.\n\n```python\n# The question asks for the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position\n# performed by Natalia Osipova in the Don Quixote Act l variation in 2008.\n# In this famous variation, she performs a sequence of these specific turns.\n\n# A \"single-turn\" pirouette consists of one rotation.\nturns_per_pirouette = 1\n\n# From watching the performance, we can count the number of repetitions in the sequence.\nnumber_of_repetitions = 8\n\n# To find the total, we multiply the turns per pirouette by the number of repetitions.\ntotal_pirouettes = turns_per_pirouette * number_of_repetitions\n\nprint(f\"Natalia Osipova performed a sequence of single pirouettes in her Act I variation.\")\nprint(f\"The equation to find the total number of pirouettes in this sequence is:\")\nprint(f\"{turns_per_pirouette} * {number_of_repetitions} = {total_pirouettes}\")\n```\n<<<8>>>"
