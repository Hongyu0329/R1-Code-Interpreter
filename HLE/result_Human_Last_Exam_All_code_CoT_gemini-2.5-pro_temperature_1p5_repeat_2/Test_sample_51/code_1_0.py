    print("The problem defines a non-standard subterm relation. The critical clause is:")
    print("  'a lambda (λ x. f) is a subterm of X whenever X is a subterm of X.'")
    print("Since any term X is considered a subterm of itself (reflexivity), this rule implies that any lambda abstraction is a subterm of any term X.")
    print("This rule breaks the well-foundedness requirement of structural recursion. It allows a recursive function to call itself on an argument that is not structurally smaller.")
    print("This enables the definition of general non-terminating functions, which is equivalent to having a general recursion operator (like the Y-combinator).\n")

    print("Step 3: Identify the Source of the Inconsistency")
    print("In the context of a logical framework like dependent type theory, the ability to define general recursive functions is known to be dangerous.")
    print("Girard's Paradox demonstrates that a system containing both general recursion and impredicativity is logically inconsistent.")
    print("Impredicativity is, broadly, the ability to define an object by quantifying over a collection that contains the object being defined.")
    print("An inconsistent system is one where a proof for any proposition can be constructed, including a proof of False (`⊥`), which makes the logic useless.\n")

    print("Step 4: Evaluate the Axioms")
    print("We must find the axiom that introduces a form of impredicativity, which then combines with general recursion to cause inconsistency.")

    print("- Axioms concerning equality (A, B, D, E) or classical logic (F, H, I) are not the typical ingredients for a Girard-style paradox.")
    print("- The key is the hierarchy of type universes. An axiom that allows universes to be mixed in a non-hierarchical way introduces impredicativity.")
    print("- (C) Propositional resizing is an axiom that explicitly governs the relationship between different type universes, specifically `Prop` (the universe of propositions) and `Type` (a universe of larger types).")
    print("  This axiom allows propositions to be 'resized' or embedded into `Type`. This enables the formation of new types by quantifying over *all* propositions, a powerful form of impredicativity.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The non-standard subterm rule provides the power of general recursion. The axiom of Propositional Resizing provides the power of impredicativity.")
    print("The combination of these two principles is famously known to be inconsistent with the foundations of type theory. Therefore, Propositional Resizing is the axiom that leads to inconsistency in this context.")
