def solve_group_theory_problem():
    """
    This function solves the given group theory problem and prints the answer.

    The problem's constraints on the subnormal series G = G_1 ◁ G_2 ◁ ... ◁ G_{n+1} = {1}
    imply that G must be the trivial group {1}. This is because "H ◁ K" means H is a normal
    subgroup of K, which requires H to be a subset of K. This leads to an ascending
    chain of subgroups G_1 ⊆ G_2 ⊆ ... ⊆ G_{n+1}. Since G_{n+1} = {1}, all groups in the
    chain, including G = G_1, must be the trivial group.

    (a) For G = {1}, the minimal group G_hat where all p-nonsingular systems have
    solutions is G itself. This minimal group {1} is unique. So the answer is Yes.

    (b) The derived length of G_hat = {1} is 0. Since this is the only possible value,
    it is also the maximum possible value.
