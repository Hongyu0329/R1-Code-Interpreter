    # --- Introduction ---
    # We want to find the change in mutual inductance, ΔM = M₂ - M₁, where:
    # M₁ is the mutual inductance between the two bare circuits.
    # M₂ is the mutual inductance with the concentrator shell present.
    # The change ΔM is the mutual inductance contribution from the shell itself.
    # Since the wires are very long, we calculate the inductance per unit length (ΔM/L).

    # --- The Concentrator and the Method of Images ---
    # The concentrator shell (μ_r -> ∞, μ_φ -> 0) creates a boundary condition
    # where the radial component of the magnetic field is zero (B_r = 0) at its
    # inner radius, r = R₁.
    # This effect can be modeled by replacing the shell with an "image" of the source circuit.

    # Circuit 1 (source) consists of:
    #   - Wire A: Current +I at position x = -h/2
    #   - Wire B: Current -I at position x = +h/2

    # For a B_r=0 boundary, the image of a source wire with current J at position x₀ is
    # a wire with current -J at position R₁²/x₀.
    # Therefore, the image of Circuit 1 is:
    #   - Image of A: Current -I at x = -R₁²/(h/2) = -2*R₁²/h
    #   - Image of B: Current +I at x = +R₁²/(h/2) = +2*R₁²/h

    # Let's define H_img = 2*R₁²/h, the separation of the image wires.
    # The image circuit has current +I at x = +H_img and -I at x = -H_img.

    # --- Calculating ΔM ---
    # ΔM is the mutual inductance between Circuit 2 and the image of Circuit 1.
    # We can calculate this by finding the magnetic flux from the image circuit that
    # passes through Circuit 2 and dividing by the current I.
    # Using the magnetic vector potential A_z and applying the approximation for when
    # the shell radius R₁ is much larger than the circuit separation d (R₁ >> d),
    # and d is much larger than the wire separation h (d >> h), we can derive the result.

    # The detailed calculation involves integrating the magnetic field of the image circuit
    # over the area of the second circuit, which simplifies under the given approximations.
    # The result of this calculation is:
    # ΔM/L ≈ (μ₀ * h) / (π * H_img)

    # Substituting H_img = 2*R₁²/h back into the expression gives the final formula.
    # ΔM/L = (μ₀ * h) / (π * (2*R₁²/h))
    # ΔM/L = (μ₀ * h²) / (2 * π * R₁²)
