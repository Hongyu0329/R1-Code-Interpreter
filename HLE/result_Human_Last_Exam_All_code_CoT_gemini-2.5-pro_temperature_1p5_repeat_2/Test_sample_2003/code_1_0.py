def solve_key_signature_formula():
    """
    This script calculates the coefficients for the formula describing the total
    number of sharps in the key signatures of a list of 12 notes, after those
    notes have been sharped 'n' times.

    The derivation follows two key rules from the problem description:
    1. Flat-based key signatures are converted to their sharp-based enharmonic
       equivalents (e.g., F major with 1 flat is treated as E# major with 11 sharps).
    2. Theoretical keys are not simplified (e.g., C## major is not D major). The number
       of sharps for a key X-sharp is the number of sharps for X major plus 7.

    # Step 1: Establish the number of sharps for the 7 natural-note major keys,
    # applying the flat-to-sharp conversion rule.
