    This function provides the IUPAC name for the major product of the described reaction.
    
    The reaction sequence is:
    1. A sulfoxide elimination on ((2-((2-methylbut-3-en-2-yl)oxy)ethyl)sulfinyl)benzene
       to form an allyl vinyl ether intermediate.
    2. A [3,3]-sigmatropic Claisen rearrangement of the intermediate to yield the final product.
    
    The final product is an aldehyde with the structure: O=CH-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2
    Its IUPAC name is derived as follows:
    - Principal functional group: Aldehyde -> suffix "-al"
    - Longest carbon chain including the aldehyde: 5 carbons -> "pent"
    - Location of the double bond: Starts at carbon 4 -> "pent-4-enal"
    - Substituents: Two methyl groups at carbon 3 -> "3,3-dimethyl"
    """
    
    # The numbers in the final name are 3, 3, and 4.
    final_iupac_name = "3,3-dimethylpent-4-enal"
