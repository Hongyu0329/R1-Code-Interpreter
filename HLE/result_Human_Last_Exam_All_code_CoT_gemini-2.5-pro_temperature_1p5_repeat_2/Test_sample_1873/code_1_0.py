    # the variance of estimators is much higher than in simple random samples.
    # This increased variance is captured by a design effect (deff).
    # A plausible model for the design effect incorporates the network's structural properties.
    # The term 1/(gamma - 2) captures the high heterogeneity from the power-law degree distribution.
    # The term (alpha - 1) relates to the localization of neighborhood similarity.
    # The combined structural complexity factor V can be modeled as:
    # V = (alpha - 1) / (gamma - 2)

    # Standard sample size for a proportion (n_srs) is proportional to (Z/epsilon)^2.

    # to the base statistical requirement.
