    "This problem asks for the number of integer values for side `AC` of a triangle `ABC` that result in two possible values for side `AB`. This is a classic \"ambiguous case\" problem in trigonometry.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve it:\n1.  **Analyze the geometry:** We are given a side-side-angle (SSA) configuration: side `BC` (let's call it `a`), angle `B`, and side `AC` (let's call it `b`). The ambiguous case, which yields two possible triangles, occurs under specific conditions.\n2.  **Apply the Law of Sines:** The Law of Sines states `a / sin(A) = b / sin(B)`. We can use this to find an expression for `sin(A)`.\n    *   Given `a = BC = S`, `B = 30°`, and `b = AC`.\n    *   `S / sin(A) = b / sin(30°)`\n    *   Since `sin(30°) = 0.5`, we get `sin(A) = (S * 0.5) / b`.\n3.  **Determine the condition for two triangles:** For two possible triangles to exist, two conditions must be met:\n    a. The value of `sin(A)` must be between 0 and 1, which allows for two possible angles for `A` (an acute angle `A₁` and an obtuse angle `A₂ = 180° - A₁`). This gives the inequality `S * 0.5 / b < 1`, which simplifies to `b > S * 0.5`.\n    b. The obtuse angle `A₂` must be a valid angle in the triangle. That is, `A₂ + B < 180°`. Substituting the values: `(180° - A₁) + 30° < 180°`, which simplifies to `A₁ > 30°`. Since `A₁` is acute, this means `sin(A₁) > sin(30°)`. This gives the inequality `S * 0.5 / b > 0.5`, which simplifies to `b < S`.\n4.  **Combine the conditions:** For two triangles to exist, the length of side `AC` (or `b`) must be in the range `S * 0.5 < b < S`.\n5.  **Calculate the final count:**\n    *   The problem uses `S = SNYWR`. This appears to be a placeholder. A common interpretation for such letter puzzles is the phone keypad mapping: S=7, N=6, Y=9, W=9, R=7. So, we'll assume `S = 76997`.\n    *   The range for `AC` is `76997 * 0.5 < AC < 76997`, which is `38498.5 < AC < 76997`.\n    *   We need to count the number of integers in this interval. The smallest integer is 38499, and the largest is 76996.\n    *   The total number of integers is `76996 - 38499 + 1`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_triangle_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the number of integer values of AC for which there are\n    two possible values for side length AB.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let S = SNYWR.
