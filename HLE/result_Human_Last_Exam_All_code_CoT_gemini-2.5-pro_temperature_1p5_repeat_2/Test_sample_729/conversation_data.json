    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct power subgroups of the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Group $Q_{128}$**: The generalized quaternion group $Q_{4n}$ has the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. For $Q_{128}$, we have $4n = 128$, so $n=32$. The group is $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. The elements of this group are of the form $x^i$ and $yx^i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups**: A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H = G^k$, where $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct sets $G^k$ that are subgroups.\n\n3.  **Analyze Powers of Elements**: We'll compute the set $G^k$ by considering the two types of elements in $Q_{128}$.\n    *   **Type 1: $g = x^i$**: The powers are $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$. For all possible values of $i$, this generates the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n    *   **Type 2: $g = yx^i$**: The powers $(yx^i)^k$ depend on whether $k$ is even or odd.\n        *   If **$k$ is odd**, it can be shown that $G^k = Q_{128}$. Since this is the same subgroup for any odd $k$, this case contributes exactly one power subgroup, which is $Q_{128}$ itself.\n        *   If **$k$ is even**, say $k=2m$, then $(yx^i)^k = x^{32m}$. The set of all $k$-th powers is $G^k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{32m}\\}$. It can be proven that $x^{32m}$ is always an element of the cyclic group $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$. Therefore, for any even $k$, the power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups**:\n    *   From the odd powers, we get one subgroup: $Q_{128}$.\n    *   From the even powers, we get subgroups of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ for some even integer $k$. The set of all possible values for $d$ is the set of all even divisors of 64.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We need to count the number of even divisors of 64.\n    *   The divisors of 64 are $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n    *   The even divisors are $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$, of which there are 6. These correspond to 6 distinct cyclic subgroups.\n    *   The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases: $1$ (from odd powers) + $6$ (from even powers) = $7$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef count_even_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of even positive divisors of an integer n.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate from 1 to n to find all divisors\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # Check if the divisor is even\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\n# For the generalized quaternion group Q_128, the maximal cyclic subgroup <x> has order 64.\norder_of_cyclic_subgroup = 64\n\n# The number of power subgroups coming from even exponents is equal to the\n# number of even divisors of the order of the maximal cyclic subgroup.\nnum_even_power_subgroups = count_even_divisors(order_of_cyclic_subgroup)\n\n# The number of power subgroups coming from odd exponents is 1 (the group Q_128 itself).\nnum_odd_power_subgroups = 1\n\n# The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the two cases.\ntotal_power_subgroups = num_odd_power_subgroups + num_even_power_subgroups\n\nprint(\"The number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 can be calculated as follows:\")\nprint(\"1. From odd powers k, we get one subgroup (the group itself).\")\nprint(f\"2. From even powers k, we get a number of subgroups equal to the number of even divisors of {order_of_cyclic_subgroup}.\")\nprint(f\"The number of even divisors of {order_of_cyclic_subgroup} is {num_even_power_subgroups}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe total number of power subgroups is the sum from these two cases:\")\nprint(f\"{num_odd_power_subgroups} + {num_even_power_subgroups} = {total_power_subgroups}\")\n```\n<<<7>>>"
