    Analyzes common alignment loss functions to determine if they are HALOs.

    According to Ethayarajh et al. (2024), a function f is a human-aware loss (HALO) for a value function v
    if it can be written as:
        f(pi_theta, pi_ref) = E_{x,y ~ D} [a_{x,y} * v(r_theta(x,y) - E_Q[r_theta(x, y')])] + C_D
    
    where:
    - r_theta(x,y) is the implied reward, proportional to log(pi_theta(y|x) / pi_ref(y|x)).
    - v is a non-decreasing and concave function on (0, infinity).
    - a_{x,y} is +1 or -1, indicating feedback valence (e.g., for preferred vs. dispreferred responses).
    - Q is a reference point distribution.
