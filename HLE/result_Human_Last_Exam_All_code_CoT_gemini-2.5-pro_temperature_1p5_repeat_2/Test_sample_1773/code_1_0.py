    print("Acetazolamide is a medication that inhibits an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. This has two key effects relevant to the question:")
    print("  - Effect A: It decreases the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, which lowers intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull).")
    print("  - Effect B: It also decreases the production of aqueous humor in the eye, which lowers intraocular pressure (IOP, pressure inside the eye).")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the patient's change in condition.")
    print("The patient was taking acetazolamide for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (high pressure in the skull).")
    print("The patient then experiences a 'sudden remission,' meaning the condition causing the high intracranial pressure has resolved on its own.")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("Step 3: Evaluate the impact of continued medication.")
    print("Even though the intracranial pressure has normalized due to remission, the patient continues to take acetazolamide.")
    print("The medication's effect on the eye (Effect B) is still active.")
    print("It continues to suppress the production of aqueous humor.")

    print("Step 4: Conclude the observable result.")
    print("Since the drug is still reducing the fluid pressure in the eye in a now physiologically normal patient, the result on an intraocular pressure test will be an abnormally low pressure reading.")
