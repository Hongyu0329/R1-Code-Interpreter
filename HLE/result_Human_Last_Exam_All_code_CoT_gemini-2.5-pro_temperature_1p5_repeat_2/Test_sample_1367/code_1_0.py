  # Answer to (a): Is V(p) simple for all p in Z_>=1?
  # The vertex algebra V(p) is simple if and only if p=1. For p >= 2, it is not simple.
  # Thus, it is not simple for all p.
  answer_a = "No"

  # Answer to (b): If there exists a non-trivial ideal in V(p), what condition must be met?
  # The existence of a non-trivial ideal in a highest-weight representation of the Virasoro algebra
  # (which V(p) is) is equivalent to the existence of a singular vector. Any such ideal is generated
  # by at least one singular vector.
  answer_b = "must contain a singular vector"
  
  # Answer to (c): Does the simplicity of V(p) imply that it is also irreducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module?
  # Simplicity only occurs for p=1, where k=-1. The vertex algebra V(1) is the simple Weyl VOA.
  # However, as a module for the affine Lie algebra L_{-1}(sl_2), the Weyl VOA is reducible;
  # it decomposes into a direct sum of two irreducible submodules.
  # Therefore, simplicity of V(p) does not imply irreducibility as an L_k(sl_2)-module.
  answer_c = "No"
  
  # Format the final answer as requested.
