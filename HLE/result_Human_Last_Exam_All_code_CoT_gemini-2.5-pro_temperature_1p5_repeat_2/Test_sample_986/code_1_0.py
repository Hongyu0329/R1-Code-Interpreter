    # Step 1: Define the objects from the problem statement.
    # Let D be the poset (R, <=), the set of real numbers with the natural order.
    # Let P be the nerve of D. The nerve of a poset is a simplicial complex whose simplices
    # are the finite totally ordered subsets (chains). Since D is a total order, any finite
    # subset of R is a chain.
    # The 1-skeleton of P consists of all 0-simplices (vertices) and 1-simplices (edges).
    # The vertices are the elements of R. The edges are all pairs {u, v} of distinct elements of R.
    # Thus, the 1-skeleton is the complete graph K_R on the vertex set R.
    
    # The phrase "as a directed graph" means we must orient the edges of this complete graph.
    # The natural orientation comes from the poset D. We direct an edge from u to v if u < v.
    # Let's call this directed graph G. So, G = (V, E) where V = R and E = {(u,v) | u,v in R, u < v}.
    # This graph G is a tournament on the vertex set R.

    # Step 2: Define the graph X.
    # X is the line graph of G.
    # The vertices of a line graph L(G) are the edges of G.
    # So, the set of vertices of X is V(X) = {(u,v) | u,v in R, u < v}.
    # In a directed line graph, there is an edge from edge e1 to edge e2 if the head of e1 is the tail of e2.
    # So, there's a directed edge in X from v1=(u,v) to v2=(v,w). For v1 and v2 to be valid vertices,
    # this requires the ordering u < v < w.

    # Step 3: Define the clique number problem.
    # The clique number of a directed graph is the clique number of its underlying undirected graph.
    # Let X_undirected be the underlying undirected graph of X.
    # Two vertices in X, v1 = (x1, y1) and v2 = (x2, y2), are adjacent in X_undirected
    # if there is a directed edge between them in X in either direction.
    # An edge v1 -> v2 in X exists if y1 = x2.
    # An edge v2 -> v1 in X exists if y2 = x1.
    # So, v1 and v2 are adjacent if (y1 = x2) or (y2 = x1).
    # We want to find the size of the largest clique in X_undirected, denoted omega(X).

    # Step 4: Find a lower bound for omega(X).
    # A clique of size 2 exists if there is at least one edge in X_undirected.
    # Let's try to find two adjacent vertices.
    # Let v1 = (1, 2). This is a valid vertex since 1 < 2.
    # Let v2 = (2, 3). This is a valid vertex since 2 < 3.
    # To check if they are adjacent, we check the condition: (y1 = x2) or (y2 = x1)?
    # For v1, y1 = 2. For v2, x2 = 2. The condition y1 = x2 holds.
    # So, the set {(1, 2), (2, 3)} is a clique of size 2.
    # This establishes a lower bound: omega(X) >= 2.

    # Step 5: Find an upper bound for omega(X) by attempting to construct a clique of size 3.
    # Assume for contradiction that a clique C = {v1, v2, v3} of size 3 exists.
    # Let v1 = (x1, y1), v2 = (x2, y2), v3 = (x3, y3). Each must satisfy xi < yi.
    # The adjacency condition must hold for all three pairs:
    # 1. {v1, v2}: y1 = x2 or y2 = x1
    # 2. {v1, v3}: y1 = x3 or y3 = x1
    # 3. {v2, v3}: y2 = x3 or y3 = x2
    
    # In the directed graph X, the subgraph induced by the clique C must be a tournament on 3 vertices.
    # Any tournament on 3 vertices is either a directed 3-cycle or a transitive tournament.

    # Case A: The tournament on C is a 3-cycle, e.g., v1 -> v2 -> v3 -> v1.
    # v1 -> v2 means y1 = x2. So v1=(x1,y1) and v2=(y1,y2).
    # v2 -> v3 means y2 = x3. So v3=(y2,y3).
    # v3 -> v1 means y3 = x1. So we can write v3=(y2,x1).
    # For these vertices to be valid in X, their components must be ordered:
    # From v1=(x1, y1): x1 < y1
    # From v2=(y1, y2): y1 < y2
    # From v3=(y2, x1): y2 < x1
    # Chaining these inequalities gives: x1 < y1 < y2 < x1. This is a contradiction.
    # Therefore, a 3-cycle is impossible.

    # Case B: The tournament on C is transitive. Let's assume v1 is a source, so v1->v2 and v1->v3.
    # v1 -> v2 means y1 = x2. So v1=(x1,y1) and v2=(y1,y2). This requires x1 < y1 < y2.
    # v1 -> v3 means y1 = x3. So v3=(y1,y3). This requires x1 < y1 < y3.
    # Since v2 and v3 are distinct vertices, y2 != y3.
    # For C to be a clique, v2 and v3 must also be adjacent. This means (y2 = x3) or (y3 = x2).
    # From our setup, we know x2 = y1 and x3 = y1.
    # So the adjacency condition becomes (y2 = y1) or (y3 = y1).
    # However, for v2 and v3 to be valid vertices, we must have y1 < y2 and y1 < y3.
    # This leads to a contradiction, as y2 cannot be equal to y1.
    # A symmetric argument shows that a sink (e.g., v2->v1, v3->v1) is also impossible.

    # Since all possible structures for a 3-clique lead to a contradiction, no clique of size 3 exists.
    # This establishes an upper bound: omega(X) < 3.

    # Step 6: Conclude the clique number.
    # From Step 4, we have omega(X) >= 2.
    # From Step 5, we have omega(X) < 3.
    # Since the clique number must be an integer, the only value satisfying these bounds is 2.
    clique_number = 2

    # Final output
    print("The final computation leads to the equation:")
