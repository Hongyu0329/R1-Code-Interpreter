# Step 1: Analyze Question 1: "What animal's coat color changed as a baby?"
# Doc 1 states the change happened "at a few months old".
# Doc 2 states the change happened "as they reached puberty".
# The phrase "at a few months old" is a better match for "as a baby".
# Therefore, for Question 1, the top document is 1.
q1_rank = 1

# Step 2: Analyze Question 2: "What animal's coat color did not change as a baby?"
# Both Doc 1 and Doc 2 contain the identical sentence answering this: "Cows retained the reddish-brown colour."
# Since the information is identical, they are equally relevant.
# However, the answer format requires selecting a single best document. As we established Doc 1 is more precise for Question 1,
# we can use this as a tie-breaker, making it the preferred document overall.
# Therefore, for Question 2, the top document is 1.
q2_rank = 1

# Step 3: Combine the rankings
# The combined ranking is 1-1, which corresponds to option A.
final_answer = 'A'

# Step 4: Print the final answer
print(f"Ranking for Question 1: {q1_rank}")
print(f"Ranking for Question 2: {q2_rank}")
print(f"The final combined answer is {q1_rank}-{q2_rank}, which is choice {final_answer}.")
# This is a dummy python code to demonstrate the logic and print the final result.
# No real computation is needed as this is a logic puzzle.

# The final result is 'A' based on the reasoning.
# The question requires printing the result, which is what this block does.
# This code doesn't need to be run, it just formalizes the thinking process.

# A simple print statement to output the answer.
print("A")
