    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a specific region within a 1D box. The probability is found by integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that region.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' for a given quantum state 'n' is ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a).\n2.  **Determine the Probability Density:** The probability density is the square of the wavefunction's magnitude: P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a).\n3.  **Set up the Integral:** The probability of finding the particle in the interval from x₁ to x₂ is the definite integral of the probability density function over this interval:\n    Probability = ∫ [from x₁ to x₂] (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) dx.\n4.  **Define Parameters:** For this specific problem:\n    *   Quantum state, n = 2\n    *   Interval start, x₁ = 0.495a\n    *   Interval end, x₂ = 0.505a\n5.  **Calculate the Integral:** We will use Python with the `scipy` library to perform the numerical integration, as it provides an accurate result for this type of integral. The length of the box 'a' can be set to 1.0 for the calculation, as it cancels out in the final dimensionless probability.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n    within a specific interval for n=2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the parameters for the problem.\n    # The quantum state is n.\n    n = 2\n    # The interval is from 0.495a to 0.505a.\n    # For calculation, we can set the box length 'a' to 1, as it cancels out.\n    a = 1.0\n    x1 = 0.495 * a\n    x2 = 0.505 * a\n\n    # 2. Define the probability density function, |ψ(x)|².\n    def probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n        \"\"\"\n        The probability density for a particle in a 1D box: (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a).\n        \"\"\"\n        return (2.0 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n    # 3. Integrate the probability density over the interval [x1, x2] to find the probability.\n    # The quad function returns the integral result and an error estimate.\n    probability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n    # 4. Print the final equation and the result.\n    # The prompt requires showing the numbers in the final equation.\n    print(\"The probability (P) is calculated by integrating the probability density function |ψ(x)|².\")\n    print(\"The equation with the given values is:\")\n    print(f\"P = Integral from {x1:.3f}a to {x2:.3f}a of (2/a) * sin^2({n}*pi*x/a) dx\")\n    print(\"\\nAfter performing the integration, the result is:\")\n    print(f\"Probability = {probability:.9f}\")\n\nsolve_probability()\n```\n<<<0.000006662>>>"
