# Define the physical constants and parameters of the rope.
# We will use example values for mass, length, and speed.
m = 10.0  # mass of the rope in kg
l = 5.0   # length of the rope in meters
v = 2.0   # speed at the final moment in m/s
g = 9.8   # acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2

# The formula for the force F is F = m*g + (m * v^2) / l.

# Calculate the component of the force needed to counteract gravity.
force_gravity = m * g

# Calculate the component of the force needed to give momentum to the rope.
force_kinetic = (m * v**2) / l

# Calculate the total force F.
total_force = force_gravity + force_kinetic

# Print the final equation with the numerical values.
print(f"The equation for the total force F is:")
print(f"F = (mass * gravity) + (mass * speed^2) / length")
print(f"F = ({m} kg * {g} m/s^2) + ({m} kg * {v}^2 m^2/s^2) / {l} m")
print(f"F = {force_gravity:.2f} N + {force_kinetic:.2f} N")

# Print the final calculated force.
print(f"\nThe exact force F required is: {total_force:.2f} Newtons")
