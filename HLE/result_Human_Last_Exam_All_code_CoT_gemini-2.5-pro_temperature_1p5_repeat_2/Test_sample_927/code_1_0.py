1.  **Analyze the Language and Structure:** The language is $\mathcal{L} = \{+, -, \cdot, P\}$, and the structure is the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. The symbols $+, -, \cdot$ have their usual meaning in $\mathbb{R}$. The crucial part is the predicate $P(x)$, which is true if and only if $x \in \mathbb{N}$ (the natural numbers).

2.  **Understand the Goal:** We need to characterize the subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ that are definable by an *existential* $\mathcal{L}$-formula. An existential formula has the form $\exists y_1, \dots, \exists y_k \, \psi(x, y_1, \dots, y_k, \bar{a})$, where $\psi$ is quantifier-free and $\bar{a}$ are parameters from $\mathbb{R}$. A set $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is definable if $S = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} \mid \mathbb{R} \models \exists \bar{y} \, \psi(n, \bar{y}, \bar{a}) \}$.

3.  **Connect to Hilbert's Tenth Problem and the DPRM Theorem:** This problem is deeply related to Hilbert's tenth problem and its solution, the DPRM (Davis-Putnam-Robinson-Matiyasevich) theorem. The DPRM theorem states that a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is **recursively enumerable (R.E.)** if and only if it is **Diophantine**. A set is Diophantine if there exists a polynomial with integer coefficients, $Q(x, z_1, \dots, z_k)$, such that:
    $n \in S \iff \exists z_1, \dots, z_k \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } Q(n, z_1, \dots, z_k) = 0$.

4.  **Show that R.E. sets are definable (R.E. $\subseteq$ Definable):**
    Let $S$ be any R.E. set. By the DPRM theorem, we have a Diophantine representation for it. We can translate this directly into an existential formula in our language $\mathcal{L}$:
    $n \in S \iff \exists z_1, \dots, z_k \in \mathbb{R} \text{ such that } (P(z_1) \land \dots \land P(z_k) \land Q(n, z_1, \dots, z_k) = 0)$.
    The quantifier-free part is $\psi := P(z_1) \land \dots \land P(z_k) \land Q(n, \bar{z}) = 0$. The quantifiers are over $\mathbb{R}$, but the predicates $P(z_i)$ force the witnesses to be natural numbers. This is a valid existential $\mathcal{L}$-formula. Therefore, every R.E. set is definable.

5.  **Show that definable sets are R.E. (Definable $\subseteq$ R.E.):**
    This is the more profound direction. Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be a set defined by an existential formula $\exists \bar{y} \, \psi(x, \bar{y}, \bar{a})$. The quantifier-free formula $\psi$ is a Boolean combination of polynomial equalities ($t_1=t_2$) and predicate applications ($P(t)$).
    It is a known, non-trivial result in logic (a consequence of work by Julia Robinson, Martin Davis, and others on Hilbert's Tenth Problem over different rings and fields) that such a formula, even with real number parameters and quantifiers over the reals, can only define recursively enumerable sets of natural numbers.
    The intuition is that any such formula can be transformed into a question about the existence of integer solutions to a system of polynomial equations. An algorithm can search for these integer solutions. If a solution exists, the algorithm will eventually find it and halt. This "halting on success" behavior is the defining characteristic of a semi-algorithm, which recognizes an R.E. set.

6.  **Conclusion:** Since the definable sets contain all R.E. sets and are contained within the R.E. sets, the two classes must be identical. The correct answer is the set of recursively enumerable subsets of $\mathbb{N}$.

Now, let's provide a concrete example as requested.
A classic example of an R.E. set is the set of composite numbers.
A number $n$ is composite if $n = a \cdot b$ for integers $a, b > 1$.
We can write this as $n = (x+2)(y+2)$ for some natural numbers $x, y \in \mathbb{N}$.
The defining Diophantine equation is: $n - (x+2)(y+2) = 0$.

Let's test for $n=9$. We seek $x,y \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $9 - (x+2)(y+2) = 0$.
A solution is $x=1, y=1$. This gives $9 - (1+2)(1+2) = 9 - 3 \cdot 3 = 9 - 9 = 0$.
The final solved equation for $n=9$ is $9 - (1+2)(1+2) = 0$.

The numbers present in this specific instantiation of the equation are:"""
