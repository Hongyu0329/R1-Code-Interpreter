    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a known result from the theory of Lie algebras. The terms of order `n` in the BCH formula for `log(exp(X)exp(Y))` form a basis for the `n`-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators (`X` and `Y`).\n\nThe number of these basis elements is given by the Witt formula for the dimension of this component.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  I will use the Witt formula:\n    `L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} (μ(d) * k^(n/d))`\n    where:\n    *   `n` is the order of the coefficients.\n    *   `k` is the number of generators.\n    *   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n    *   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  For this specific problem:\n    *   The order `n` is 10.\n    *   The number of generators `k` is 2 (the non-commuting variables `X` and `Y`).\n\n3.  My Python script will execute the following steps:\n    *   Define `n = 10` and `k = 2`.\n    *   Find all positive divisors `d` of 10 (which are 1, 2, 5, 10).\n    *   Implement the Möbius function `μ(d)` to determine the sign and value of each term.\n    *   Calculate each term `μ(d) * 2^(10/d)` in the sum.\n    *   Sum these terms together.\n    *   Divide the total sum by `n=10` to get the final count.\n    *   The script will print out the calculation step-by-step, including the fully expanded final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef moebius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Möbius function mu(n).\n    - mu(1) = 1\n    - mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    - mu(n) = (-1)^k if n is a product of k distinct primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = []\n    temp_n = n\n    d = 2\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            temp_n //= d\n            # Check for squared prime factor\n            if temp_n % d == 0:\n                return 0\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        factors.append(temp_n)\n\n    return -1 if len(factors) % 2 != 0 else 1\n\ndef solve_bch_nonzero_coefficients():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of a specific order\n    in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion using the Witt formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The order of the coefficients in the expansion\n    n = 10\n    # The number of generators (e.g., X and Y)\n    k = 2\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero BCH coefficients of order {n}.\")\n    print(\"This is equivalent to the dimension of the n-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on k generators, L_n(k).\")\n    print(\"Using the Witt formula: L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} (μ(d) * k^(n/d))\\n\")\n\n    # Find all positive divisors of n\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n            if i * i != n:\n                divisors.append(n // i)\n    divisors.sort()\n\n    print(f\"For n={n}, k={k}, the divisors 'd' of {n} are: {divisors}\")\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    sum_str_parts = []\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = moebius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        k_power_d = k ** power\n        term = mu_d * k_power_d\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        sum_str_parts.append(f\"(μ({d}) * {k}^({n}/{d}))\")\n\n    print(\"\\nExpanded formula:\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * [ {' + '.join(sum_str_parts)} ]\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting values:\")\n    eval_sum_str_parts = []\n    # Build the string for the final equation showing each calculated term\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = moebius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        k_power_d = k ** power\n        term = mu_d * k_power_d\n        \n        # For the first term, just add the number.
