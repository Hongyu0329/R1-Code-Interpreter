# A continuum is a compact connected metric space.
# A point p in a continuum X is a non-block point if X \ {p} contains a continuum-connected dense subset.
# We want to find the number of positive integers n for which the n-cube, [0,1]^n,
# cannot be the set of all non-block points of any continuum.

# Let's analyze the problem based on established theorems in continuum theory.

# Fact 1: For n >= 2
# A theorem by J. Krasinkiewicz (1980) shows that for any integer n >= 2,
# there exists a continuum whose set of non-block points is the n-cube [0,1]^n.
# This means that the property does NOT fail for n = 2, 3, 4, ...
successful_n_values = "n=2, 3, 4, ..."

# Fact 2: For n = 1
# The 1-cube is the interval [0,1], which is an arc.
# A different theorem by Krasinkiewicz states that if the set of non-block points
# of a continuum X is an arc, that arc must be an open subset of X.

# Logical deduction for n = 1:
# 1. Assume a continuum X exists where its set of non-block points is [0,1].
# 2. By Fact 2, [0,1] must be an open set in X.
# 3. As a compact set, [0,1] is also a closed set in the metric space X.
# 4. Since X is a continuum (and therefore connected), it cannot have a non-empty
#    proper subset that is both open and closed. This forces X to be equal to [0,1].
# 5. So, if a solution exists, the continuum X must be [0,1] itself.
# 6. Let's check this: What is the set of non-block points of the continuum X = [0,1]?
#    - Take any point p in the open interval (0,1).
#    - Removing p disconnects [0,1] into [0,p) and (p,1]. Such a point is a "cut point".
#    - A cut point is always a block point because the space minus the point is disconnected,
#      making it not continuum-connected.
#    - Therefore, the points in (0,1) are block points, not non-block points.
# 7. This means the set of non-block points of [0,1] is NOT equal to [0,1].
# 8. This is a contradiction. The initial assumption in step 1 must be false.

# Conclusion:
# The n-cube [0,1]^n fails to occur as the set of non-block points only for the case n=1.

failing_n_value = 1
list_of_failing_n = [failing_n_value]

# The question asks for "how many" such values of n exist.
# We found only one such value.
number_of_failing_cases = len(list_of_failing_n)

# Printing the final equation and the result
