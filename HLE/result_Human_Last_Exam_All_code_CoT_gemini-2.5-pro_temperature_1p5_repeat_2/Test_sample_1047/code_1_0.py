    Analyzes the legal scenario about a conflict of interest and determines the correct answer.

    The key points of the scenario are:
    1.  NC LLP (the firm) previously represented Advanced Tech Inc. (ATI) in litigation and obtained significant confidential information (financials, contracts, etc.).
    2.  Now, a different partner (Norman) in the same firm is representing Six Wings Inc. (SWI) in the acquisition of ATI.
    3.  The confidential information the firm holds about ATI is directly relevant and useful to SWI in the acquisition, creating a clear conflict of interest.
    4.  ATI, the former client, explicitly refuses to consent to NC LLP representing SWI.

    Analysis of options:
    A. Incorrect. The matters are related because the confidential information from the first is relevant to the second.
    B. Incorrect. While ethical walls are important, they do not override the prejudiced former client's right to refuse consent, which is the decisive factor here.
    C. Incorrect. This relies on a weak assumption about partners. The conflict exists due to firm-wide imputed knowledge and the relevance of the information, not the specific status of the lawyers.
    D. Correct. This identifies the central legal principle. A conflict of interest exists that prejudices the former client (ATI). For the firm to act in such a situation, the prejudiced party must provide informed consent. Since ATI refuses to consent, NC LLP is prohibited from acting.
    E. Incorrect. This is an overstatement. Consent is a valid way to waive many types of conflicts.

    The most accurate explanation is that the lack of consent from the prejudiced former client (ATI) prevents the law firm from taking on the new representation.

    # The final answer is determined by the legal principle that in a conflict of interest situation,
    # the prejudiced party (the former client, Advanced Tech Inc.) must consent for the representation to continue.
    # Since they do not consent, NC LLP cannot represent Six Wings Inc.
    final_answer = "D"
    print(f"The correct choice is D. The reasoning is as follows:")
    print("1. A law firm owes a continuing duty of confidentiality to its former clients.")
    print("2. NC LLP possesses confidential information about its former client, Advanced Tech Inc., that is highly relevant to the new matter (the acquisition).")
    print("3. Representing Six Wings Inc. in this acquisition creates a conflict of interest because the firm could use this confidential information to the detriment of its former client.")
    print("4. In such a situation, the conflict can typically be waived only with the informed consent of the prejudiced party (the former client).")
    print("5. The scenario explicitly states that Advanced Tech Inc. will not consent.")
    print("6. Therefore, the absence of consent from the prejudiced party is the reason Norman and NC LLP are not allowed to continue the representation.")
