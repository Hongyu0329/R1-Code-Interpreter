# Final Answer generation based on the reasoning above.

# Question A: Is every boopable function Turing-computable?
# Answer: Yes. The architecture is Turing-complete, so any function it computes
# (a "boopable" function) must be Turing-computable.

# Question B: Does a program exist to compute f(x)=x in <= x+50 steps?
# Answer: Yes. A self-modifying program can achieve this.
# The program's design is as follows:
# 1. Pre-fill memory with a large number of BOOP instructions (~2^32).
# 2. Add a HALT instruction at the end, say at address H.
# 3. A small dispatcher at the start calculates a target address T = H - x.
# 4. The dispatcher creates and executes a jump to T.
# The total steps follow the equation:
# Total Steps = Steps_for_dispatcher + Steps_for_boops + Steps_for_halt
# Total Steps = C + x + 1
# Since the dispatcher is small and has a constant runtime (e.g., C=35),
# the condition C + 1 <= 50 can be met.
# The program length is also within the specified bounds.
