    "This task requires scanning a line of Latin poetry, which involves identifying each syllable as long or short and grouping them into metrical feet. The provided line is from the Roman playwright Plautus, and its meter is not the common Dactylic Hexameter, but an Iambic Senarius. Scanning this meter, especially in early Latin, can be complex due to frequent substitutions and sound changes like elision.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to scan the line:\n1.  **Identify the Meter**: The line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" is an Iambic Senarius, which consists of six iambic feet (an iamb is a short syllable followed by a long one: S L). Plautine meter allows for frequent substitutions, where other foot types like a Dactyl (L S S), Spondee (L L), or Anapest (S S L) can replace an iamb.\n2.  **Handle Elision**: When a word ending in a vowel is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, the first vowel is dropped. In our line, `bene esse` becomes `ben' esse`, so the syllable `-ne` is elided.\n3.  **Determine Syllable Quantities**: I will determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on standard rules:\n    *   A syllable is long by nature if it has a long vowel (e.g., `ō`) or a diphthong.\n    *   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants.\n    *   Otherwise, the syllable is short.\n4.  **Parse into Feet**: I will group the sequence of long and short syllables into six metrical feet, consistent with the rules of the Iambic Senarius meter and its allowed substitutions.\n\n**Line Analysis**:\n`et tibi ben(e) esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n\n*   **Foot 1: `et tibi`**:\n    *   `et`: Long by position (followed by `t` and the `t` of `tibi`). -> **L**\n    *   `ti-bi`: Both vowels are short by nature. -> **S S**\n    *   Result: `L S S` (A Dactyl, a valid substitution for an Iamb in the first foot).\n*   **Foot 2: `ben(e) es-`**:\n    *   `be-`: The syllable `be` from `bene` is short. -> **S**\n    *   `es-`: The syllable `es` from `esse` is long by position (followed by `ss`). -> **L**\n    *   Result: `S L` (A perfect Iamb).\n*   **Foot 3: `-se so-`**:\n    *   `-se`: The second syllable of `esse` is long by position (the `e` is followed by `s` and the `s` of `soli`). -> **L**\n    *   `so-`: The first syllable of `soli` (`sōlī`) is long by nature. -> **L**\n    *   Result: `L L` (A Spondee, a valid substitution).\n*   **Foot 4: `-li quom`**:\n    *   `-li`: The second syllable of `soli` (`sōlī`) is long by nature. -> **L**\n    *   `quom`: Long by position (followed by the `s` of `sibi`). -> **L**\n    *   Result: `L L` (A Spondee, a valid substitution).\n*   **Foot 5: `sibi sit`**:\n    *   `si-bi`: Both syllables are short by nature. -> **S S**\n    *   `sit`: Long by position (followed by `t` and the `m` of `male`). -> **L**\n    *   Result: `S S L` (An Anapest, a valid substitution).\n*   **Foot 6: `male`**:\n    *   `ma-le`: Both syllables are short by nature. -> **S S**\n    *   Result: `S S` (A Pyrrhic, acceptable for the final foot).\n\nThe code below will print the final scansion based on this analysis.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the scansion of the provided Latin line.\n# The analysis and breakdown into feet are explained above.\n# L = Long syllable, S = Short syllable\n\nfoot_1 = \"L S S\"\nfoot_2 = \"S L\"\nfoot_3 = \"L L\"\nfoot_4 = \"L L\"\nfoot_5 = \"S S L\"\nfoot_6 = \"S S\"\n\n# The final scansion is formed by joining the patterns of the six feet.\n# Each part of the final scansion string is printed explicitly.\nprint(foot_1, foot_2, foot_3, foot_4, foot_5, foot_6)\n```\n<<<L S S S L L L L L S S L S S>>>"
