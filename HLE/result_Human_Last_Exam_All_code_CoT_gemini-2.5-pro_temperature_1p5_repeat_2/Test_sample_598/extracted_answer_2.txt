Yes, a combination of parameters with two SRGs having different numbers of 5-cycles exists.
The parameters are (n, d, lambda, mu) = (16, 6, 2, 2).
--------------------
The two graphs are the 4x4 Rook's graph (G1) and the Shrikhande graph (G2).
The number of 5-cycles in the 4x4 Rook's graph is 240.
The number of 5-cycles in the Shrikhande graph is 384.
--------------------
Final Equation: Number of 5-cycles in G1 = 240 != 384 = Number of 5-cycles in G2.
