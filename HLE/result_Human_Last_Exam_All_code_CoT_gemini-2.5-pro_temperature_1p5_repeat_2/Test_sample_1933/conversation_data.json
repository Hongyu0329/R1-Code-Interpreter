    "The problem asks for the VC dimension of the fragment of first-order logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where the schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Logic:** First, I'll analyze the structure of the formulas $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable in this logic. These formulas define the concepts whose complexity we want to measure. I will show that any such formula is equivalent to the conjunction of a sentence (a formula with no free variables) and a monomial (a pure conjunction of atomic formulas like $P_i(x)$). This means that for any given model, the expressible concepts are limited to those defined by monomials.\n2.  **Relate to a Known Problem:** The problem thus reduces to finding the VC dimension of the concept class of monomials over 4 boolean features. The features correspond to the 4 unary predicates.\n3.  **Calculate the VC Dimension:** The VC dimension of monomials over $k$ features is a known result, which is $k$. I will demonstrate this for $k=4$.\n    *   **Lower Bound (VC-dim $\\ge 4$):** I will show that a set of size 4 can be shattered. The Python code below will provide a constructive proof of this by defining a specific model and iterating through all $2^4 = 16$ subsets of a 4-element set, showing that a formula exists for each one.\n    *   **Upper Bound (VC-dim $< 5$):** I will explain, using a well-known combinatorial argument (related to Sauer's Lemma), why no set of size 5 can be shattered. This part will be included in the comments of the code.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Combining the lower and upper bounds, we find that the VC dimension is exactly 4.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It programmatically demonstrates that a set of size 4 can be shattered and includes a detailed explanation for the final result.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_vc_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the VC dimension for the given logic fragment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The schema S has 4 unary predicates.
