    # The Pohozaev identity P=0 is a necessary condition for a critical point, but it is not sufficient.
    # The set of functions satisfying P=0 (the Pohozaev manifold) is larger than the set of critical points.

    # (b) Is it true that for any (u, v) in H^{1,s}(R^2), there exists a unique t > 0 such that (u_t, v_t) is in P?
    # Yes, under standard assumptions on the nonlinearity (e.g., homogeneity), the equation for the scaling
    # factor t, which places the scaled function on the Pohozaev manifold, typically takes the form t^k = C,
    # which has a unique positive solution for t, provided C > 0.

    # (c) Must the minimiser of J on P(a,b) satisfy the condition phi''(u,v)(1) < 0?
    # Yes, a minimizer of J on the Pohozaev manifold is a ground state solution. Such solutions lie on the
    # Nehari manifold as well, which implies phi'(1) = 0. The condition phi''(1) < 0 is a stability
    # condition characteristic of these ground states in focusing problems (where nonlinearity exponent p > 2),
    # indicating the solution is a saddle point of the energy functional.
