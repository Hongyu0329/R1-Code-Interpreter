    "Of course. My plan is to first compile a list of notable battle paintings by Lady Butler and the historical years of the battles they depict. I will store this information in a Python list. Then, the script will process this list to find the one with the highest year.\n\nTo satisfy the request to \"output each number in the final equation,\" the code will first print out each painting and its corresponding battle year from the list. This shows all the data points being considered. Finally, it will identify and print the details of the painting that depicts the latest historical battle.\n\n```python\ndef find_latest_battle_painting():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of Lady Butler's paintings to find which one\n    depicts the latest historical battle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Create a list of tuples containing the painting's title,\n    # the battle's name, and the year of the battle.\n    paintings_data = [\n        (\"The Roll Call\", \"Battle of Inkerman\", 1854),\n        (\"The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras\", \"Battle of Quatre Bras\", 1815),\n        (\"Scotland Forever!\", \"Battle of Waterloo\", 1815),\n        (\"The Defence of Rorke's Drift\", \"Battle of Rorke's Drift\", 1879),\n        (\"The Remnants of an Army\", \"1842 retreat from Kabul\", 1842),\n        (\"Floreat Etona!\", \"Battle of Laing's Nek\", 1881)\n    ]\n\n    # Step 2: Print each painting and its battle year to show the data being analyzed.\n    print(\"Finding the latest battle from the following paintings by Lady Butler:\")\n    for title, battle, year in paintings_data:\n        # This fulfills the requirement to show each number in the 'equation'.\n        print(f\"- '{title}', depicts event from year: {year}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Use the max() function to find the entry with the highest year.\n    # The 'key' argument specifies that the comparison should be based on the\n    # third element (index 2) of each tuple, which is the year.\n    if not paintings_data:\n        print(\"\\nNo painting data available to analyze.\")\n        return\n\n    latest_battle_info = max(paintings_data, key=lambda item: item[2])\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final result.\n    final_title, final_battle, final_year = latest_battle_info\n    print(\"\\n--- Result ---\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation identifies the latest year as {final_year}.\")\n    print(f\"The latest battle depicted is the '{final_battle}' from the painting '{final_title}'.\")\n\n\nfind_latest_battle_painting()\n<<<Battle of Laing's Nek>>>\n```"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
