    This function solves the lateral thinking puzzle.

    The puzzle connects Pope Paul II with Paul McCartney of The Beatles.
    The clue "'X' was written in the 1960s" refers to the "Paul is dead"
    conspiracy theory that became popular in 1969.

    For a pope, being secretly dead and replaced by an imposter would be
    a shameful scandal. Thus, the word "X" is "dead".
