    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Read Inputs:** The program needs to read two strings from the standard input.\n2.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** To compare the strings lexicographically without considering the case of the letters, the simplest approach is to convert both strings to a common case, either all uppercase or all lowercase. Lowercase is a common convention.\n3.  **Lexicographical Comparison:** After converting both strings to lowercase, I will perform a standard lexicographical comparison on them.\n    *   If the modified first string is lexicographically smaller than the second, the result is -1.\n    *   If the modified first string is lexicographically greater than the second, the result is 1.\n    *   If the strings are identical, the result is 0.\n4.  **Output the Result:** The program will print the resulting integer (-1, 1, or 0) to the standard output.\n\nFor the memory analysis requested, I will consider the most memory-efficient C program. Such a program would declare two character arrays to hold the strings (maximum length 100 + 1 for the null terminator) and an integer for the loop index.\n*   String 1 buffer: `char s1[101];` -> 101 bytes\n*   String 2 buffer: `char s2[101];` -> 101 bytes\n*   Loop counter: `int i;` -> 4 bytes (on a typical system)\n*   Total memory (m) = 101 + 101 + 4 = 206 bytes.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the first string from input\n        first_string = input()\n\n        # Read the second string from input\n        second_string = input()\n\n        # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n        s1_lower = first_string.lower()\n        s2_lower = second_string.lower()\n\n        # Compare the two lowercase strings and determine the output\n        if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n            print(\"-1\")\n        elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n            print(\"1\")\n        else:\n            print(\"0\")\n\n    except EOFError:\n        # Handle case where there is no input\n        pass\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<206>>>"
