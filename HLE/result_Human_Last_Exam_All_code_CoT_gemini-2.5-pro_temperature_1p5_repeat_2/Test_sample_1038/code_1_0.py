print(f"Applying an on-chip body bias of ~{body_bias_voltage}V directly addresses the core headroom problem. By lowering the effective Vt from {vt}V, it becomes much easier to bias the transistor in subthreshold while accommodating the +/-{sensor_offset}V input offset, all within the {v_supply}V supply. This is the most direct way to solve the fundamental low-voltage constraint.")

print("\n[Analysis of Option D]: Fundamentally flawed.")
print("Replacing the bootstrapped capacitor with a fixed current-mirror bias destroys the circuit's ability to handle signal swings and offsets, as the resistance would change exponentially with the input signal.")
