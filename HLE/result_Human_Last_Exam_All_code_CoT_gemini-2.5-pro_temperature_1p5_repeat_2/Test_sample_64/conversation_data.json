    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent of 「弟」 (otouto), I will use the `pyopenjtalk` library. This library is a Python wrapper for the Open JTalk text-to-speech system, which contains detailed dictionary information about Japanese phonology, including pitch accent.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Import the `pyopenjtalk` library.\n2.  Use the `pyopenjtalk.extract_fullcontext()` function to get the detailed linguistic information for the word 「弟」.\n3.  From the full context label, I will extract two key pieces of information:\n    *   The total number of moras (rhythmic units) in the word.\n    *   The position of the accent kernel, which is the mora after which the pitch drops. A value of 0 indicates there is no pitch drop.\n4.  Based on these two numbers, I will classify the accent pattern:\n    *   If the accent kernel position is 0, the pattern is **Heiban** (平板型), as the pitch is flat until a following particle.\n    *   If the accent kernel position is 1, the pattern is **Atamadaka** (頭高型).\n    *   If the accent kernel position is equal to the number of moras, the pattern is **Odaka** (尾高型).\n    *   If the accent kernel position is greater than 1 but less than the number of moras, the pattern is **Nakadaka** (中高型).\n5.  Finally, I will print the analysis and the resulting pitch accent pattern.\n\n```python\nimport pyopenjtalk\nimport re\n\ndef get_pitch_accent_info(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a Japanese word to determine its pitch accent pattern using pyopenjtalk.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Get the detailed linguistic context label for the word.\n        # It's a list, but for a single word, we only need the first element.\n        full_context_label = pyopenjtalk.extract_fullcontext(word)[0]\n\n        # Use regular expressions to find the accent position and mora count.\n        # The accent position 'p3' is in the format /A:xx-xx+p3\n        accent_match = re.search(r\"/A:\\d+-\\d+\\+(\\d+)\", full_context_label)\n        # The mora count 'p5' is in the format /F:xx_p5\n        mora_match = re.search(r\"/F:\\d+_(\\d+)\", full_context_label)\n\n        if not accent_match or not mora_match:\n            print(f\"Could not parse accent information for '{word}'.\")\n            return\n\n        accent_pos = int(accent_match.group(1))\n        mora_count = int(mora_match.group(1))\n        pronunciation = pyopenjtalk.g2p(word, kana=True)\n\n        # Determine the accent pattern name based on the rules.\n        accent_pattern = \"Unknown\"\n        if accent_pos == 0:\n            accent_pattern = \"Heiban (A)\"\n        elif accent_pos == 1:\n            accent_pattern = \"Atamadaka (B)\"\n        elif accent_pos == mora_count:\n            accent_pattern = \"Odaka (D)\"\n        elif 1 < accent_pos < mora_count:\n            accent_pattern = \"Nakadaka (C)\"\n\n        # Print the detailed breakdown.\n        print(f\"Analysis for: 「{word}」\")\n        print(f\"Pronunciation: {pronunciation}\")\n        print(f\"Mora Count: {mora_count}\")\n        print(f\"Accent Kernel Position: {accent_pos} (A value of 0 means there is no pitch drop within the word)\")\n        print(f\"Resulting Pitch Accent Pattern: {accent_pattern}\")\n\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"Please install pyopenjtalk: pip install pyopenjtalk\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# The word we want to analyze\ntarget_word = \"弟\"\nget_pitch_accent_info(target_word)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
