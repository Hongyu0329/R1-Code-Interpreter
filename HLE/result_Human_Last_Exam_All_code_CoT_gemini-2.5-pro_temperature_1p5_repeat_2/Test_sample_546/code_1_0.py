# As derived from the mathematical simplification of the problem, the function f(p)
# evaluates to a constant value, 2^81, for any p satisfying the given primality conditions.
# The specific large value of p is not needed for the final computation.

# The final, simplified equation is f(p) = 2^81.
base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result
result = base**exponent

# Print the numbers from the final equation and the result.
print(f"The equation simplifies to {base}^{exponent}.")
print(f"The calculated value is: {result}")
