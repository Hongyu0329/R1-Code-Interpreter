    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Factorize the conductor `d`**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo the prime power factors of $d$. A character is primitive modulo $d$ if and only if each of its components is primitive. First, we find the prime factorization of $d = 53599$.\n2.  **Character properties**: The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its component characters. We need this LCM to be 6.\n3.  **Count component characters**: For each prime factor $p$ of $d$, we need to count the number of primitive characters modulo $p$ for each possible order $g$. For a prime conductor $p$, a character is primitive if it's not the trivial character (which has order 1). The number of primitive characters of order $g>1$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(g)$, provided that $g$ divides $p-1$.\n4.  **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: To find the number of characters whose component orders have an LCM of exactly 6, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let $A(k)$ be the number of primitive characters whose order divides $k$. The number of characters with order exactly 6 is:\n    $N_6 = A(6) - A(3) - A(2) + A(1)$.\n5.  **Calculate A(k)**: The number of characters with order dividing $k$, $A(k)$, is the product of the number of choices for each component character. For each prime factor $p_i$ of $d$, we sum the counts of primitive characters whose orders $g$ divide $k$.\n    $A(k) = \\prod_{p_i|d} \\left( \\sum_{g | k} \\text{count of primitive chars mod } p_i \\text{ of order } g \\right)$\n6.  **Final Calculation**: We will compute $A(6), A(3), A(2), A(1)$ and combine them to get the final answer.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the following Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the unique prime factors of an integer n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = set()\n    d = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % d == 0:\n            factors.add(d)\n            while temp_n % d == 0:\n                temp_n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        factors.add(temp_n)\n    return list(factors)\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef num_primitive_chars_prime_conductor(p, g):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive characters of conductor p and order g.\n    For a prime conductor p, this is phi(g) if g > 1 and g divides p-1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if g == 1:\n        return 0\n    if (p - 1) % g == 0:\n        return phi(g)\n    return 0\n\ndef calculate_A(k, primes):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates A(k), the number of primitive characters with conductor d\n    whose order divides k.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_prod = 1\n    for p in primes:\n        # Sum of primitive characters for a single prime factor p,\n        # for orders g that divide k.\n        current_sum = 0\n        # Iterate through all divisors of k\n        for g in range(1, k + 1):\n            if k % g == 0:\n                current_sum += num_primitive_chars_prime_conductor(p, g)\n        total_prod *= current_sum\n    return total_prod\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    order = 6\n\n    # Step 1: Factorize the conductor\n    primes = get_prime_factorization(d)\n\n    # Step 4 & 5: Calculate A(k) for divisors of the order\n    # The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    A6 = calculate_A(6, primes)\n    A3 = calculate_A(3, primes)\n    A2 = calculate_A(2, primes)\n    A1 = calculate_A(1, primes)\n\n    # Step 6: Final calculation using inclusion-exclusion\n    result = A6 - A3 - A2 + A1\n\n    print(f\"The conductor is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of d is: {' * '.join(map(str, sorted(primes)))}\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the number of characters of order exactly 6, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\")\n    print(\"Let A(k) be the number of characters whose order divides k.\")\n    print(\"The total number of characters of order 6 is A(6) - A(3) - A(2) + A(1).\\n\")\n    print(f\"Number of characters with order dividing 6, A(6) = {A6}\")\n    print(f\"Number of characters with order dividing 3, A(3) = {A3}\")\n    print(f\"Number of characters with order dividing 2, A(2) = {A2}\")\n    print(f\"Number of characters with order dividing 1, A(1) = {A1}\\n\")\n    print(\"The final number of primitive Dirichlet characters is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"{A6} - {A3} - {A2} + {A1} = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<608>>>"
