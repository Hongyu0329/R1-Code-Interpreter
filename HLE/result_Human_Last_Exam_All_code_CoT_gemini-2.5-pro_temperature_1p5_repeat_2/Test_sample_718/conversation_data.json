    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Translate the problem into the language of module theory.** We will establish the equivalence between the category of functors from the poset $J$ to vector spaces, $\\text{Func}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, and the category of modules over the poset algebra $K[J]$. This allows us to rephrase the question in terms of homological dimensions of modules.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of the algebra $K[J]$ for an upper semilattice $J$.** We will show that the specific condition of $J$ being an upper semilattice implies that the associated poset algebra $K[J]$ is a hereditary algebra. This is a crucial simplification.\n\n3.  **Use the classification of tame hereditary algebras.** A well-known result in representation theory classifies hereditary algebras into finite, tame, and wild representation types. We know our algebra $K[J]$ is tame and hereditary. We will use the known properties of tame hereditary algebras, specifically their global homological dimension.\n\n4.  **Determine the value of $n$.** The global dimension of an algebra provides the upper bound for the projective dimension of any module. The question's \"$n$-resolvable\" corresponds to having a projective dimension of at most $n$. By finding the maximum possible global dimension for a tame hereditary algebra, we will find the value of $n$.\n\nThis plan allows us to connect the poset-theoretic and categorical language of the question to the powerful machinery of the representation theory of algebras to find a precise answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_representation_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning to determine the value of n for which\n    a tame functor from an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"This is a theoretical problem from the representation theory of algebras.\")\n    print(\"The goal is to find the integer 'n' mentioned in the problem statement.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Translate the problem into module theory\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Rephrasing the Problem ---\")\n    print(\"A functor f: J -> Vect_K can be viewed as a representation of the poset J.\")\n    print(\"The category of all such functors is equivalent to the category of modules over the 'poset algebra' K[J].\")\n    print(\"The term 'n-resolvable' for a functor f means that f has a projective resolution of length at most n.\")\n    print(\"This is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of the corresponding module is at most n, i.e., proj.dim(f) <= n.\")\n    print(\"The condition that the functor is 'tame' means that the algebra K[J] is of tame representation type.\")\n    print(\"So, the question is: What is the maximum projective dimension for any module over a tame algebra K[J], where J is an upper semilattice?\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Use the property of the upper semilattice J\n    print(\"--- Step 2: The Structure of the Poset Algebra K[J] ---\")\n    print(\"A key property of a poset algebra K[P] is that it is 'hereditary' if and only if for any two elements x, y in P,\")\n    print(\"the set of their common upper bounds {z in P | z >= x and z >= y} either is empty or has a unique minimal element.\")\n    print(\"An upper semilattice J is a poset where any two elements x, y have a least upper bound (a join), denoted x v y.\")\n    print(\"This join 'x v y' is the unique minimal element in the set of common upper bounds of x and y.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, for any upper semilattice J, the associated poset algebra K[J] is a hereditary algebra.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Use the properties of tame hereditary algebras\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Global Dimension of Tame Hereditary Algebras ---\")\n    print(\"From the previous steps, we know K[J] is a 'tame hereditary algebra'.\")\n    print(\"The representation theory of hereditary algebras is well-understood.
