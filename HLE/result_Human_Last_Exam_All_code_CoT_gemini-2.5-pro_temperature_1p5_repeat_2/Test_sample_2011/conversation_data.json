    "This problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph with n=128 vertices.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, let's understand the terminology. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. A clique of size `k` is denoted as `K_k`. An induced subgraph on a set of vertices `S` contains all edges from the original graph between vertices in `S`.\n2.  The core insight is to determine the structure of the set of possible induced clique sizes. If a graph `G` contains a `K_k` as an induced subgraph, it means there is a set of `k` vertices in `G` that are all mutually connected.\n3.  Let's consider any subset of `j` vertices (where `j < k`) from this `k`-vertex clique. These `j` vertices are also all mutually connected. The subgraph induced by these `j` vertices is therefore a `K_j`.\n4.  This means that if a graph can form an induced clique of size `k`, it can also form induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to `k`. Therefore, the set of all possible induced clique sizes for any graph must be of the form `{1, 2, ..., K}`, where `K` is the size of the largest clique in the graph.\n5.  The number of different clique sizes is thus equal to `K`, the size of the largest clique (also known as the clique number, `omega(G)`).\n6.  The problem is now simplified to finding the maximum possible clique number for a graph with `n=128` vertices.\n7.  By definition, the size of a clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. So, the maximum possible clique number `K` is `n`.\n8.  This maximum is achieved by the complete graph `K_n`. For `n=128`, the complete graph `K_128` has a clique of size 128 (the graph itself). This graph contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n9.  Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\nThe following Python code explains this logic and provides the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single\n    graph on n = 128 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    print(f\"The number of vertices in the graph is n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the set of induced clique sizes.\")\n    print(\"If a graph has an induced clique of size K (a K_K), then any subset of j < K vertices from that clique will form an induced clique of size j (a K_j).\")\n    print(\"This means the set of possible induced clique sizes is always of the form {1, 2, ..., K_max}, where K_max is the size of the largest clique in the graph.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Reframing the problem.\")\n    print(\"The number of different clique sizes is equal to K_max.\")\n    print(\"So, the problem is to find the maximum possible value of K_max for a graph with n vertices.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Finding the maximum K_max.\")\n    print(\"The size of any clique in a graph cannot be larger than the total number of vertices.\")\n    print(f\"So, K_max must be less than or equal to n.
