    "The problem asks for the next number in a given sequence. The sequence does not appear to follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. The numbers are also too specific to be random. A common type of puzzle for this format involves the numbers being the ASCII ordinal values of a hidden piece of text. However, without knowing the text, this is not solvable.\n\nAnother approach is to look for local patterns within the sequence itself, especially near the end. This is a more direct method that relies only on the information provided.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the tail end of the sequence for repeating patterns.\n2.  The sequence ends with: `... 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124`.\n3.  Let's assign variables to the two dominant numbers at the end: let `a = 36` and `b = 124`.\n4.  The tail of the sequence can be written as: `..., a, a, a, b, b, b, a, b`.\n5.  This shows a block of three `a`'s, followed by a block of three `b`'s, and then the beginning of a new pattern `a, b`.\n6.  The simplest and most logical continuation for the alternating `a, b` pattern is to repeat it. After `a, b`, the next term would be `a`.\n7.  Therefore, the next number in the sequence should be 36.\n8.  I will write a Python script that takes the original sequence, appends the next calculated number (36), and prints the full resulting sequence as the \"final equation\" requested by the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the next number in the sequence based on\n    pattern analysis of its tail end and prints the final sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124]\n    \n    # The tail of the sequence shows a pattern of ...a,a,a,b,b,b,a,b\n    # where a = 36 and b = 124.\n    # The simplest continuation of the new pattern \"a, b\" is \"a\".\n    # Therefore, the next number is 36.\n    next_number = 36\n    \n    # The \"final equation\" is the original sequence with the next number appended.\n    final_equation = sequence + [next_number]\n\n    # Print each number in the final equation, as requested.\n    # The use of map(str, ...) and join is to format the output nicely.\n    print(\", \".join(map(str, final_equation)))\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
