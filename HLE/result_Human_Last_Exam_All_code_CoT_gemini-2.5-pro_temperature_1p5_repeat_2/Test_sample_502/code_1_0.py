    # 1. We are given a group G with order |G|.
    order_G = 10000

    # 2. The group G acts on the polynomial ring R = C[x_1, ..., x_10]
    # via a homomorphism rho: G -> GL_10(C).
    # The group that effectively acts on R is the image H = rho(G).

    # 3. A fundamental theorem in invariant theory states that the dimension
    # of the coinvariant algebra R/I is equal to the order of the acting group, |H|.
    #  dim(R/I) = |H|

    # 4. From the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, we know that |H| = |G| / |ker(rho)|.
    # Therefore, dim(R/I) = |G| / |ker(rho)|.

    # 5. To find the largest possible dimension, we must maximize |H|.
    # This is equivalent to minimizing the order of the kernel, |ker(rho)|.

    # 6. The kernel is a subgroup, so its smallest possible size is 1. This corresponds
    # to a faithful representation, where rho is injective.
    min_kernel_size = 1

    # 7. We must verify that such a case is possible. We need a group G of order 10000
    # that has a faithful 10-dimensional representation. The cyclic group G = C_10000
    # is an example. Its generator can be mapped to the 10x10 diagonal matrix
    # diag(exp(2*pi*i/10000), 1, 1, ..., 1), which defines a faithful representation.
    # Thus, a kernel of size 1 is achievable.

    # 8. The largest possible dimension is calculated using the minimal kernel size.
    max_dim = order_G / min_kernel_size

    # As requested, we print the final equation.
    print("The largest possible dimension for R/I is found by maximizing the order of the acting group H.")
    print("This is achieved when the kernel of the representation rho is trivial (size 1).")
