    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Extract the Numbers:** I will analyze the haiku line by line to pull out the numerical values it contains.\n    *   \"An August tempest\": August is the 8th month of the year, so this line gives us the number **8**.\n    *   \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\": This phrase directly translates to the calculation 2 * 15, which equals **30**.\n    *   \"A divine one yields\": This points to the number **1**.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** The language of the haiku suggests the mathematical operations.\n    *   I'll start with **30**, the number from the middle line.\n    *   The word \"tempest\" implies a chaotic or destructive event, which I will interpret as a subtraction of **8**.\n    *   The word \"yields\" suggests surrendering or giving something up, which I'll also interpret as a subtraction of **1**.\n    *   This gives the final equation: `30 - 8 - 1`.\n\n3.  **Solve and Interpret:** I will calculate the result of the equation.\n    *   The result is **21**.\n    *   The riddle asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order,\" which hints that the numerical result should be converted to a letter of the alphabet. The 21st letter is **U**.\n    *   The final piece of the puzzle is the title, \"The Bays,\" which is posed as a question. The letter **U** is the answer because many geographical bays are characteristically **U-shaped**.\n\n4.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script that performs the calculation and prints the complete equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_haiku_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle presented in the haiku.\n    1. Extracts numbers from the haiku's text.\n    2. Forms an equation based on the haiku's wording.\n    3. Calculates the result and prints the full equation.\n    The final answer is derived by interpreting this result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # \"An August tempest\" -> August is the 8th month.\n    num_august = 8\n\n    # \"Twice fifteen\" -> 2 * 15\n    num_twice_fifteen = 30\n\n    # \"A divine one\" -> 1\n    num_one = 1\n\n    # The words suggest the equation:\n    # \"tempest\" (destruction/loss) and \"yields\" (gives up) imply subtraction\n    # from the main number, 30.\n    # The equation is 30 - 8 - 1.\n    result = num_twice_fifteen - num_august - num_one\n\n    # The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.\n    # The result, 21, corresponds to the 21st letter of the alphabet: U.\n    # The title \"The Bays\" is the question, and the answer is \"U\"\n    # because bays are often U-shaped.\n    print(f\"The equation from the haiku is: {num_twice_fifteen} - {num_august} - {num_one} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_haiku_riddle()\n```\n<<<U>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
