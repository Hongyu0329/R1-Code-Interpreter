# --- Step 1: Determine the Shape ---
# The shapes are grouped in threes: Cells 1-3 are Circles, 4-6 are Squares.
# Cells 7 and 8 are Triangles, so Cell 9 must complete the set.
shape = "Triangle"

# --- Step 2: Determine the number of Dots ---
# The number of dots for each shape group forms an arithmetic progression starting with 0.
# For the Triangle group (Cells 7, 8, 9), the known dot counts are:
dots_cell_7 = 0
dots_cell_8 = 3

# The common difference of the arithmetic progression is found by subtracting the first term from the second.
common_difference = dots_cell_8 - dots_cell_7

# The number of dots for Cell 9 is the third term in the series (the second term plus the common difference).
dots_cell_9 = dots_cell_8 + common_difference

# --- Step 3: Determine the Arrow Position ---
# The rule for arrow position is: position_in_radians = (π/3) * number_of_dots.
# A resulting angle of 0 or any multiple of 2π is described as "straight up".
# For Cell 9, with 6 dots, the position is (π/3) * 6 = 2π.
# This position corresponds to "straight up".
arrow_position = "straight up"

# --- Step 4: Assemble and print the final description ---
# The request to "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as
# showing the calculation for the number of dots.

print("Calculation for the number of dots:")
# Show the equation using the numbers from the known cells.
print(f"Dots for Cell 9 = Dots for Cell 8 + (Dots for Cell 8 - Dots for Cell 7)")
print(f"Dots for Cell 9 = {dots_cell_8} + ({dots_cell_8} - {dots_cell_7}) = {dots_cell_9}")
print("") # An empty line for better formatting.

print("Final description for Cell 9:")
# Construct and print the final descriptive string.
final_description = f"{shape}. {dots_cell_9} dots. Arrow is {arrow_position}."
print(final_description)
