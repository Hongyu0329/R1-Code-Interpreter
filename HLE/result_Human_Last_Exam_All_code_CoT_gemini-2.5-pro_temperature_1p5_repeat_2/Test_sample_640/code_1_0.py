def solve_scattering_statements():
    """
    Analyzes statements about two-channel quantum scattering and identifies the correct ones.

    The analysis is based on the following logical relationships:
    1. V(r) is trivially coupled if and only if F(E) is trivially coupled.
       This establishes an equivalence between the potential's and the Jost matrix's coupling structure.
    2. If F(E) is trivially coupled, then S(E) is trivially coupled.
       The converse is false; a nontrivially coupled F(E) can produce a trivially coupled S(E).
