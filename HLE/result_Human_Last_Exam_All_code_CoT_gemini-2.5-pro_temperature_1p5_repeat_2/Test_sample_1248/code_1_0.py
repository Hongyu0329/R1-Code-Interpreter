    # Part (a): Analyze the symmetry question.
    # The question is whether g^2 . 1_R = 1_R and x^2 . 1_R in Z(R) implies that
    # x^j . r is symmetric for all j >= 2 and any r in R.
    # The given conditions apply only to the action on the specific element 1_R.
    # A property holding for 1_R does not necessarily generalize to all elements r in R.
    # For instance, a potential interpretation of "symmetric" might require w^2 r = (g^2 . r) w^2
    # (where w = x . 1_R), which holds for r = 1_R due to the given condition, but there's no
    # reason for it to hold for an arbitrary r.
    # Thus, the implication is not generally true.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): Calculate x^2 a . 1_R for q = -1.
    # We use the formula for j=2, r=1_R, q=-1. Let w = x . 1_R.
    # The general term in the sum is:
    # C_k = (-1)^k * q^(-k(k-1)/2) * q_binom(j,k,q^-1) * w^(j-k) * (g^k a . 1_R) * w^k
    # For q=-1, q^-1 = -1.

    #      q_binom(2,0,-1) = 1.
    #      Term is w^2 * (a . 1_R).

    # k=1: j=2. C_1 = (-1)^1 * (-1)^0 * q_binom(2,1,-1) * w * (g a . 1_R) * w

    #      Term is 1 * (-1) * 1 * (g^2 a . 1_R) * w^2 = -(g^2 a . 1_R) w^2.
