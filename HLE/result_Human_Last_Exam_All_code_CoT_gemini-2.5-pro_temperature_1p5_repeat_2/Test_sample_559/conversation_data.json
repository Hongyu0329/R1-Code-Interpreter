    "My plan to solve this problem involves the following steps:\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points** of the system by setting both derivatives, $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$, to zero.\n2.  **Analyze the stability** of these equilibrium points by computing the Jacobian matrix and its eigenvalues for each point. This will help identify saddle points, which are crucial for finding separatrices.\n3.  **Identify the separatrices**. Separatrices are curves in the phase plane that separate regions of different long-term behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices.\n4.  **Search for an invariant manifold**. An invariant manifold is a curve $d=f(u)$ such that any solution starting on the curve stays on it for all time. I will look for a simple polynomial solution that passes through the saddle point.\n5.  **Verify the solution**. Once a candidate equation for the separatrix is found, I will provide a Python script using the `sympy` library to symbolically verify that this curve is indeed an invariant manifold of the system.\n6.  **Present the final equation**. The Python code will print the final equation for the separatrix, highlighting the numerical coefficients as requested.\n\nHere is the step-by-step mathematical derivation:\n\nThe system of equations is:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$\n$u' = u^2(u-1)$\n\n1.  **Equilibrium points** ($d'=0, u'=0$):\n    From $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n    If $u=0$, the first equation gives $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. Point: $(0,0)$.\n    If $u=1$, the first equation gives $2d^2 + (5-3)d - 0 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\Rightarrow 2d(d+1)=0$, so $d=0$ or $d=-1$. Points: $(0,1)$ and $(-1,1)$.\n\n2.  **Stability analysis**:\n    The Jacobian matrix is $J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d + 5u^2 - 3u & (10u - 3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    -   At $(0,1)$: $J(0,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are 2 and 1. This is an unstable node.\n    -   At $(-1,1)$: $J(-1,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are -2 and 1. This is a saddle point.\n    -   At $(0,0)$: $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Linearization is inconclusive.\n\n3.  **Separatrices**: The stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(-1,1)$ are the separatrices.\n    - The stable manifold corresponds to eigenvalue -2 and eigenvector $(1,0)^T$. It is the line $u=1$.\n    - The unstable manifold corresponds to eigenvalue 1 and eigenvector $(-2,1)^T$. The manifold is a curve tangent to this vector at $(-1,1)$.\n\n4.  **Finding the unstable manifold**: I will test for a simple solution of the form $d=f(u)$. The equation for phase plane trajectories is $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$.\n    Let's hypothesize a solution of the form $d = -u^2$. This curve passes through the equilibrium points $(0,0)$ and $(-1,1)$. The slope at $u=1$ is $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2)|_{u=1} = -2$, which matches the slope of the unstable eigenvector $(-2,1)^T$ (since $\\frac{\\Delta d}{\\Delta u} = \\frac{-2}{1}=-2$).\n    This suggests that $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold.\n\n5.  **Verification**: The following Python code will verify that $d=-u^2$ is indeed a solution to the system (an invariant manifold).\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef verify_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function verifies that the curve d = -u**2 is a separatrix (an invariant manifold)\n    for the given system of differential equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Verifying the proposed separatrix equation: d = -u**2\\n\")\n\n    # Define t as a symbol and u as a function of t\n    t = sp.Symbol('t')\n    u = sp.Function('u')(t)\n\n    # 1.
