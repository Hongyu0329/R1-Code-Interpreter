    "To find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the space**: The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. In general, this is $Gr_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $k=3$ and $n=5$.\n\n2.  **Understand the question**: The question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. For any real Grassmannian, the torsion subgroup is known to be a direct sum of some number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The term \"rank of the torsion subgroup\" in this context refers to the number of these $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ summands, which is also known as the 2-rank of the group. (Note that the standard definition of rank for any finite group, including this torsion subgroup, is 0, but this would make the question trivial. We assume the more insightful interpretation is intended.)\n\n3.  **Use the appropriate formula**: There is a known formula to calculate this 2-rank. The number of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ summands in the integral cohomology of $Gr_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the number of integers $i$ in the range $1 \\le i \\le k$ for which the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n-k-1+i}{i}$ is odd.\n\n4.  **Apply the formula to the specific case**: For $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, we have $n=5$ and $k=3$. We need to count the number of integers $i$ in $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ for which $\\binom{5-3-1+i}{i} = \\binom{1+i}{i}$ is odd.\n    *   For $i=1$: Check the parity of $\\binom{1+1}{1} = \\binom{2}{1}$.\n    *   For $i=2$: Check the parity of $\\binom{1+2}{2} = \\binom{3}{2}$.\n    *   For $i=3$: Check the parity of $\\binom{1+3}{3} = \\binom{4}{3}$.\n\n5.  **Execute the calculation**: We can write a Python script to perform these calculations. For each $i$, we'll determine if the corresponding binomial coefficient is odd. If it is, it contributes 1 to our sum; otherwise, it contributes 0. The total sum will be the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_grassmannian_torsion_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 2-rank of the integral cohomology of the real Grassmannian Gr_k(R^n).\n    This corresponds to the rank of the torsion subgroup.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters for the Grassmannian Gr_k(R^n) from the problem\n    # space of 3-subspaces of R^5 means k=3, n=5.\n    k = 3\n    n = 5\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the 2-rank of the torsion subgroup for the integral cohomology of Gr_({k})(R^{n}).\")\n    print(f\"This is the number of integers i (from 1 to {k}) for which the binomial coefficient C(n-k-1+i, i) is odd.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    rank_count = 0\n    summands = []\n\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        # Formula for the binomial coefficient's parameters\n        N = n - k - 1 + i\n        K = i\n        \n        # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(N, K)\n        try:\n            # math.comb requires Python 3.8+\n            c_val = math.comb(N, K)\n            # Check if the result is odd\n            is_odd = (c_val % 2 != 0)\n        except ValueError:\n            # This can happen if K > N, in which case C(N,K)=0\n            c_val = 0\n            is_odd = False\n            \n        term_contribution = 1 if is_odd else 0\n        summands.append(str(term_contribution))\n        rank_count += term_contribution\n        \n        parity_string = \"odd\" if is_odd else \"even\"\n        \n        print(f\"For i = {i}:\")\n        print(f\"  N = {n}-{k}-1+{i} = {N}\")\n        print(f\"  K = {i}\")\n        print(f\"  C({N}, {K}) = {c_val}, which is {parity_string}.\")\n        print(f\"  This contributes {term_contribution} to the total rank.\")\n        print()\n\n    # Create the final equation string like \"0 + 1 + 0\"\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(summands)\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The total rank is the sum of these contributions:\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {equation_string} = {rank_count}\")\n\nsolve_grassmannian_torsion_rank()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
