    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this task.\n\nThis is a knowledge-based question about ballroom dancing technique. I will analyze the fundamental characteristics of each dance style listed in the options. The key is to identify the dance where the core technique (e.g., footwork, body action, rise and fall, sway) is so rigid for a reverse turn that adding extra rotation (overturning) would fundamentally violate that technique.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Swing Dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep):** These dances are characterized by continuous, flowing movement, body sway, and rise and fall. This flowing nature allows for flexibility in the amount of turn, and overturned figures are common, recognized variations that can be executed without breaking the fundamental technique.\n2.  **Analyze the Viennese Waltz:** While very rotational, the technique is strict. However, the core concept is continuous rotation, and minor variations in turn are possible, even if not standard in basic figures.\n3.  **Analyze the European Tango:** Tango is distinct from the swing dances. It has no rise and fall and no body sway. Its technique is based on staccato actions, a \"prowling\" walk with feet kept close to the floor, and sharp head turns. The Reverse Turn in Tango is constructed with specific, clipped actions that do not lend themselves to the continuous, momentum-driven rotation needed to overturn. Attempting to add more rotation would require introducing elements like sway or momentum, which are contrary to Tango technique.\n\nBased on this analysis, the European Tango is the dance where overturning a reverse turn is technically impossible without disregarding the core principles of the dance.\n\nI will now create a Python script to present this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a dance technique question and prints the reasoned answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"In which dance is it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique?\"\n\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrott',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    analysis = \"\"\"\nThe key to answering this question lies in the fundamental technique of each dance.\n\n1.  **Swing Dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep):** These dances utilize body sway, rise and fall, and continuous, flowing momentum. This technique allows for flexibility in the amount of rotation in turns. Overturned figures are common and accepted variations that can be performed while upholding the core dance technique.\n\n2.  **European Tango:** Tango is fundamentally different. Its technique is characterized by:\n    *   No rise and fall.\n    *   No body sway.\n    *   Staccato (sharp, clipped) movements.\n    *   Feet kept in close contact with the floor.\n\nThe Reverse Turn in Tango is executed with a specific, staccato action that is incompatible with the continuous, momentum-based rotation required to 'overturn' it. Attempting to add more rotation would force the dancers to introduce sway or a flowing momentum, which fundamentally disregards and violates the core technique of Tango. Therefore, in Tango, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without breaking the established technique.\n\"\"\"\n\n    correct_option = 'C'\n    final_answer = options[correct_option]\n\n    print(\"Analysis of the Dance Technique Question:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(analysis)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The correct answer is {correct_option}, {final_answer}.\")\n\nsolve_dance_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
