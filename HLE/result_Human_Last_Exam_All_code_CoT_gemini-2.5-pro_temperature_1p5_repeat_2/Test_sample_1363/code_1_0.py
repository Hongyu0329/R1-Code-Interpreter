The key to answering this question lies in the fundamental technique of each dance.

1.  **Swing Dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep):** These dances utilize body sway, rise and fall, and continuous, flowing momentum. This technique allows for flexibility in the amount of rotation in turns. Overturned figures are common and accepted variations that can be performed while upholding the core dance technique.

2.  **European Tango:** Tango is fundamentally different. Its technique is characterized by:
    *   No rise and fall.
    *   No body sway.
    *   Staccato (sharp, clipped) movements.
    *   Feet kept in close contact with the floor.

The Reverse Turn in Tango is executed with a specific, staccato action that is incompatible with the continuous, momentum-based rotation required to 'overturn' it. Attempting to add more rotation would force the dancers to introduce sway or a flowing momentum, which fundamentally disregards and violates the core technique of Tango. Therefore, in Tango, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without breaking the established technique.
