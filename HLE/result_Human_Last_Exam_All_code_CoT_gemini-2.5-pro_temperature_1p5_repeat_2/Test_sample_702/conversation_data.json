    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a question from algebraic topology. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical objects**: The problem asks for the connectivity of a map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. This map is a specific instance of a general construction in homotopy theory.\n2.  **Recall the relevant theorem**: The connectivity of the map $\\Sigma(\\Omega A \\wedge \\Omega B) \\to \\Omega(A \\wedge B)$ is given by a standard formula, provided $A$ and $B$ are suspensions. The formula is: connectivity = conn($A$) + conn($B$) + 1, where conn($X$) is the connectivity of the space $X$.\n3.  **Determine the connectivity of the input spaces**:\n    *   The spaces are $A = S^4$ and $B = S^6$. Both are suspensions ($S^4 \\simeq \\Sigma S^3$ and $S^6 \\simeq \\Sigma S^5$), so the formula applies.\n    *   The connectivity of an $n$-dimensional sphere, $S^n$, is $n-1$. This means all its homotopy groups $\\pi_i(S^n)$ are trivial for $i < n$.\n    *   Therefore, conn($S^4$) = $4 - 1 = 3$.\n    *   And conn($S^6$) = $6 - 1 = 5$.\n4.  **Calculate the final result**: Substitute these values into the formula to find the connectivity of the given map.\n5.  **Implement in Python**: Write a simple Python script to perform these calculations and print the result in the format of the final equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes the plan:\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map\n    Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem asks for the connectivity of the map\n    # f: Sigma(Omega A wedge Omega B) -> Omega(A wedge B)\n    # where A = S^4 and B = S^6.\n\n    # Step 1: Define the dimensions of the spheres A and B.\n    sphere_dim_A = 4\n    sphere_dim_B = 6\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the connectivity of spaces A and B.\n    # The connectivity of a sphere S^n is (n-1).\n    # This means pi_i(S^n) = 0 for all i < n.\n    conn_A = sphere_dim_A - 1\n    conn_B = sphere_dim_B - 1\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the standard formula for the connectivity of the map.\n    # The formula is conn(A) + conn(B) + 1.\n    # This formula is valid because A and B are suspensions.\n    final_connectivity = conn_A + conn_B + 1\n\n    # Step 4: Output the result as a full equation, showing all numbers.\n    print(\"The connectivity of the map is given by the formula conn(S^4) + conn(S^6) + 1.\")\n    print(\"conn(S^4) = 4 - 1 = 3\")\n    print(\"conn(S^6) = 6 - 1 = 5\")\n    print(\"So, the final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{conn_A} + {conn_B} + 1 = {final_connectivity}\")\n\nsolve_connectivity()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
