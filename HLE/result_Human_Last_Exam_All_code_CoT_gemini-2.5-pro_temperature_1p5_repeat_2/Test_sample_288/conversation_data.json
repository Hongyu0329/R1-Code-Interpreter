    "To identify the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans based on synapse number, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Load the C. elegans connectome data**: I will use the `c-elegans-connectome` library, which provides access to the latest adult hermaphrodite connectome data.\n2.  **Identify ASJ neurons**: The ASJ neuron class consists of a left/right pair, ASJL and ASJR. I will consider outgoing connections from both.\n3.  **Query for synaptic connections**: I will retrieve all synaptic connections originating from ASJL and ASJR. In this context, these outgoing synapses are from the axon terminals of ASJ.\n4.  **Aggregate synapse counts**: I'll group the connections by their target (postsynaptic) neuron and sum the number of synapses for each target.\n5.  **Identify the main target**: I will find the target neuron that receives the highest total number of synapses from the ASJ neuron pair.\n6.  **Print the result**: The final output will be the name of the target cell.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ntry:\n    import c_elegans_connectome as c\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the required library first by running: pip install c-elegans-connectome\")\n    exit()\n\ndef find_main_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main synaptic target of ASJ neurons in the adult C. elegans connectome.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Load the connectome data for the adult hermaphrodite\n    print(\"Loading C. elegans connectome data...\")\n    con = c.Connectome()\n\n    # Define the presynaptic neurons of interest (ASJ left and right)\n    source_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n\n    # Get the connectivity matrix, which includes all connections\n    # This returns a pandas DataFrame\n    all_connections = con.get_connectivity()\n\n    # Filter for connections originating from ASJ neurons\n    asj_outputs = all_connections[all_connections['pre_cell'].isin(source_neurons)]\n\n    # Group by the target neuron ('post_cell') and sum the number of synapses ('N')\n    # This aggregates the synapses from both ASJL and ASJR to each target cell\n    target_synapse_counts = asj_outputs.groupby('post_cell')['N'].sum()\n\n    # Find the target cell with the maximum number of synapses\n    main_target_cell = target_synapse_counts.idxmax()\n    max_synapses = target_synapse_counts.max()\n\n    # Display the result\n    print(f\"\\nAnalysis of ASJ ('{source_neurons[0]}' and '{source_neurons[1]}') axonal targets:\")\n    print(f\"Total synapses from ASJL to {main_target_cell}: {asj_outputs[(asj_outputs['pre_cell'] == 'ASJL') & (asj_outputs['post_cell'] == main_target_cell)]['N'].sum()}\")\n    print(f\"Total synapses from ASJR to {main_target_cell}: {asj_outputs[(asj_outputs['pre_cell'] == 'ASJR') & (asj_outputs['post_cell'] == main_target_cell)]['N'].sum()}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe main synaptic target of ASJ is the neuron pair {main_target_cell}, receiving a total of {int(max_synapses)} synapses.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: ASJ -> {main_target_cell} ({int(max_synapses)} synapses)\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_main_target()\n\n<<<AIA>>>\n```"
