    "To find the exact value of the A($\\alpha$)-stability angle for the BDF4 method, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Stability Function**: The stability of a linear multistep method is analyzed by applying it to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$. This leads to a stability polynomial $\\pi(\\xi, z) = \\rho(\\xi) - z\\sigma(\\xi) = 0$, where $z = h\\lambda$. For the BDF4 method, the characteristic polynomials are:\n    *   $\\rho(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   $\\sigma(\\xi) = \\xi^4$\n\n2.  **Stability Boundary**: The boundary of the stability region is the set of complex numbers $z(\\xi) = \\rho(\\xi)/\\sigma(\\xi)$ for $|\\xi|=1$. Let $\\xi=e^{i\\theta}$, so the boundary is $z(\\theta) = \\rho(e^{i\\theta})/e^{i4\\theta}$.\n\n3.  **A($\\alpha$)-stability Angle**: The method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the angular sector $S_\\alpha = \\{ z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha \\}$. The maximum angle $\\alpha$ is found where the boundary of the stability region, $z(\\theta)$, is tangent to the lines forming the sector's boundary.\n\n4.  **Tangency Condition**: The point of tangency from the origin to a curve $z(\\theta)$ occurs when the derivative of its argument with respect to $\\theta$ is zero. This leads to the condition:\n    $\\text{Re}\\left( \\frac{\\xi \\rho'(\\xi)}{\\rho(\\xi)} \\right) = 4$\n    where $\\xi = e^{i\\theta}$ and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to $\\xi$.\n\n5.  **Polynomial Equation**: This condition can be transformed into a polynomial equation for $c = 2\\cos(\\theta)$. After significant algebraic manipulation, we arrive at the following cubic equation for $c$:\n    $15c^3 - 159c^2 + 462c - 404 = 0$\n\n6.  **Solving for the Angle**: By solving this cubic equation, we can find the value of $\\cos(\\theta)$ at the point of tangency. This allows us to calculate the corresponding complex number $z_0$ on the stability boundary. The angle $\\alpha$ is then determined by the argument of this point $z_0$. Specifically, $\\tan(\\alpha) = -\\text{Im}(z_0)/\\text{Re}(z_0)$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this procedure to find the numerical value of $\\tan(\\alpha)$ and $\\alpha$ itself.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.polynomial import Polynomial\n\n# The A(alpha)-stability angle for BDF4 is determined by the point of tangency\n# on its stability boundary.
