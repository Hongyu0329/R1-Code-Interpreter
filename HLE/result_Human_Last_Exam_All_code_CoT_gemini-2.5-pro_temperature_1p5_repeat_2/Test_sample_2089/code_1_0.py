    The character is Yasujiro Wataya (played by K≈çji Yakusho).
    At the end of his storyline, after a tense interview with police detectives,
    he boards a bus. One detective calls out to him, and he simply turns and
    says "Arigatou gozaimasu" ("Thank you"). This poignant moment ends the interaction,
    cementing his return to a life of isolation. The film was nominated for
    seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.
