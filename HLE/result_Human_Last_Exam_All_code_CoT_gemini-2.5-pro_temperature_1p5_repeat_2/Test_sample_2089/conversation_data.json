    "This is a film trivia question. My plan is to search my knowledge base for an Oscar-nominated movie that matches the specific scene described: a character says \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus, which serves as a pivotal moment for their story arc. After identifying the film, I will provide a simple Python script to print the title as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_by_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the movie based on a specific scene description.\n    The scene involves a character boarding a bus and saying \"Thank you,\" which\n    metaphorically seals their fate.\n    \n    The film is Babel (2006).\n    The character is Yasujiro Wataya (played by K≈çji Yakusho).\n    At the end of his storyline, after a tense interview with police detectives,\n    he boards a bus. One detective calls out to him, and he simply turns and\n    says \"Arigatou gozaimasu\" (\"Thank you\"). This poignant moment ends the interaction,\n    cementing his return to a life of isolation. The film was nominated for\n    seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"Babel\"\n    print(f\"The Oscar-nominated film where a character seals his fate by saying 'Thank you' while boarding a bus is: {movie_title}\")\n\nfind_movie_by_scene()\n```\n<<<Babel>>>"
