    This script explains the reasoning for choosing the correct plot and prints the answer.

    The goal is to find the plot whose color palette is interpretable for someone with
    full monochromatic vision (achromatopsia). People with this condition see only in
    shades of gray, so the different colors in the plot must be distinguishable
    by their lightness or brightness.

    Here is a step-by-step analysis of each palette's design:

    1.  **Plot 1 and Plot 6 (Default ggplot2 Palette)**:
        -   These plots use `scales::hue_pal()`, the default in ggplot2.
        -   This palette is designed to have colors with a constant lightness and chroma,
            while varying the hue.
        -   Since the lightness is constant, the colors will appear as nearly the same
            shade of gray, making them very difficult or impossible to distinguish.
        -   Conclusion: NOT suitable.

    2.  **Plot 2 (Diverging Palette `pals::ocean.balance`)**:
        -   This plot uses a diverging color palette.
        -   Diverging palettes are designed to have significant variation in lightness. They
            typically move from a dark color, to a light neutral color in the center, and
            then to another dark color.
        -   This large and systematic variation in lightness makes the colors easily
            distinguishable even when converted to grayscale.
        -   Conclusion: SUITABLE.

    3.  **Plot 3 and Plot 4 (HSLuv Palettes with Constant Lightness)**:
        -   These palettes are generated using the HSLuv color space, which is designed
            so that the 'L' value corresponds directly to perceived lightness.
        -   In the R code, `pal3` and `pal4` are both created with a constant lightness
            value (`L=60`).
        -   Because the perceived lightness is the same for all colors, they will be
            indistinguishable to a person with monochromatic vision.
        -   Conclusion: NOT suitable.

    4.  **Plot 5 (HSLuv Palette with Sampled Lightness)**:
        -   This palette also uses HSLuv, but the lightness values are sampled from the list
            `c(20, 50, 70, 20, 90)`.
        -   Crucially, the lightness value `20` appears twice in this list.
        -   This means that two of the five colors in the palette will have the exact
            same perceived lightness. These two categories will be impossible to tell
            apart on the plot for someone with monochromatic vision, making the plot not
            fully interpretable.
        -   Conclusion: NOT suitable.

    Based on this analysis, only Plot 2 uses a color palette that is correctly designed
    to be interpretable by someone with full monochromatic vision.
