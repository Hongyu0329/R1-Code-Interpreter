    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices, we can use an approach based on the Euclidean algorithm. This method involves stacking the matrices and then using elementary row operations to reduce them.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  We will represent the given polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, using the `sympy` library in Python, which allows for symbolic mathematics.\n2.  We will construct an augmented matrix `M` by stacking P1 on top of P2.\n3.  We will apply a series of elementary row operations to `M`. These operations are equivalent to left-multiplying by unimodular matrices and do not change the GCRD. The goal is to transform `M` into a block matrix form `[G; 0]`, where `G` is a 2x2 matrix and `0` is a 2x2 zero matrix.\n4.  The resulting non-zero matrix `G` is a GCRD of P1 and P2. We will simplify `G` to its simplest form, which is typically an upper triangular matrix with monic diagonal entries (the identity matrix, if the matrices are right coprime).\n5.  The Python code below will carry out these steps and print the final GCRD matrix.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two\n    polynomial matrices P1 and P2 using the extended Euclidean algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sp.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sp.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sp.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"Original Matrix P1:\")\n    sp.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nOriginal Matrix P2:\")\n    sp.pprint(P2)\n\n    # Step 1: Form the augmented matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n    print(\"\\nAugmented Matrix M = [P1; P2]:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n\n    # Step 2: Perform elementary row operations to reduce M.\n    # The goal is to get a matrix of the form [G; 0].\n    # To simplify, we'll swap rows to get the simpler matrix P2 on top.\n    # This is equivalent to finding GCRD(P2, P1), which is the same as GCRD(P1, P2).\n    M_reduced = M.copy()\n    M_reduced.row_swap(0, 2)\n    M_reduced.row_swap(1, 3)\n    # M_reduced is now [P2; P1]\n\n    # R3_new = R3 - (s+1)*R1\n    # R4_new = R4 + s*R1\n    # Note: Matrix rows are 0-indexed.\n    M_reduced[2, :] = M_reduced.row(2) - (s + 1) * M_reduced.row(0)\n    M_reduced[3, :] = M_reduced.row(3) + s * M_reduced.row(0)\n    # This zeroes out the top-left element of the bottom block.\n\n    # R2_new = R2 + R1\n    M_reduced[1, :] = M_reduced.row(1) + M_reduced.row(0)\n    # This simplifies row 1 to [-1, 1]\n\n    # Now we have a very simple row [-1, 1].
