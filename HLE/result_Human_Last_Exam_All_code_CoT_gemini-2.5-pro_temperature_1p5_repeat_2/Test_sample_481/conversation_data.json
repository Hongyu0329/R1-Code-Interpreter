    "My plan is to identify the numerical imprints on Teva brand 10mg and 20mg fluoxetine capsules and then present them in a Python script.\n\n1.  **Identify the imprints**: I will find the standard imprints for Teva's 10mg and 20mg fluoxetine capsules. The 10mg capsule is marked with \"3105\" and the 20mg capsule is marked with \"3106\".\n2.  **Create a Python script**: The script will store these two numbers as strings.\n3.  **Print the output**: The script will then print sentences clearly stating which number is on which capsule, highlighting the difference between them as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_imprint_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the different numerical imprints on\n    Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules.\n    \"\"\"\n    imprint_10mg = \"3105\"\n    imprint_20mg = \"3106\"\n\n    print(\"The number imprinted on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is:\")\n    for digit in imprint_10mg:\n        print(digit, end=\"\")\n    print(\"\\n\") # Newline for better formatting\n\n    print(\"The number imprinted on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is:\")\n    for digit in imprint_20mg:\n        print(digit, end=\"\")\n    print(\"\\n\") # Newline for better formatting\n\n    print(\"The different numbers are 3105 and 3106.\")\n\n\nfind_imprint_differences()\n```\n<<<3105 and 3106>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
