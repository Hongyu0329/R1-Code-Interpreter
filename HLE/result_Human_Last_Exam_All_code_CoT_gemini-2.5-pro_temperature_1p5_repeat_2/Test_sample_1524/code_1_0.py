    print("Step-by-step reasoning for the limit on the chemical potential in BEC:\n")

    # Step 1: The Bose-Einstein Distribution
    print("1. The average number of bosons, n(ϵ), in a single-particle state with energy ϵ is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution function:")
    print("   n(ϵ) = 1 / [exp((ϵ - μ) / (k_B*T)) - 1]")
    print("   where μ is the chemical potential and T is the temperature.\n")

    # Step 2: The Physical Constraint
    print("2. For the occupation number n(ϵ) to be positive, the denominator must be greater than zero:")
    print("   exp((ϵ - μ) / (k_B*T)) - 1 > 0")
    print("   This implies that exp((ϵ - μ) / (k_B*T)) > 1.\n")

    # Step 3: The Fundamental Limit
    print("3. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality gives (ϵ - μ) / (k_B*T) > 0.")
    print("   Since temperature T is positive, this simplifies to the fundamental constraint: ϵ - μ > 0, or:")
    print("   μ < ϵ")
    print("   This must be true for all energy states ϵ. Therefore, the chemical potential μ must be less than the lowest possible energy, the ground state energy ϵ₀. So, μ < ϵ₀.\n")

    # Step 4: The Onset of Condensation
    print("4. As a Bose gas is cooled towards the critical temperature (T_c), the chemical potential μ increases and gets closer and closer to the ground state energy ϵ₀ from below.")
    print("   For a macroscopic number of particles to occupy the ground state (the condensate), the chemical potential must become equal to the ground state energy. The final equation for the potential in the condensate is:")
    print("   μ = ϵ₀  (for T ≤ T_c)\n")

    # Step 5: Interpretation of the Limit
    print("5. Thus, the maximum value, or the fundamental upper limit, that the chemical potential can attain is the ground state energy, ϵ₀.")
    print("   At absolute zero temperature (T=0), a non-interacting Bose gas has all particles in the ground state, and its chemical potential is exactly the ground state energy: μ(T=0) = ϵ₀.\n")

    # Step 6: Conclusion
    print("6. Therefore, the fundamental limit on the chemical potential is equal to the chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at zero temperature. This corresponds to answer choice C.")
