    "My plan to answer this question is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to identify the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks. One remains in Luxor, Egypt, while the other is in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  Next, I will go through the list of Academy Award winners for Best Picture chronologically, starting from the first award in 1928.\n3.  For each film, I will determine its setting and check if it depicts either Luxor, Egypt, or Paris's Place de la Concorde.\n4.  The first film on the list that meets this criterion will be the answer. Based on my research, the key candidates set in Paris are *An American in Paris* (1951), *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), and *Gigi* (1958).\n5.  *An American in Paris* is the earliest of these films. It prominently features the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk during the film's famous climactic ballet sequence.\n6.  Therefore, *An American in Paris* (1951) is the first Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n7.  I will now generate a Python script to present this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_best_picture_with_luxor_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the first Academy Award Best Picture winner\n    to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n    The logic is based on historical research of Best Picture winners and their filming locations.\n    - The two Luxor Obelisks are in Luxor, Egypt, and Paris, France (Place de la Concorde).\n    - Reviewing Best Picture winners chronologically, 'An American in Paris' is identified as the first.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Information about the winning film\n    movie_title = \"An American in Paris\"\n    award_year = 1951\n    obelisk_location_in_film = \"Place de la Concorde, Paris\"\n\n    # Print the final answer detailing the film and the year.\n    print(f\"The first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk was:\")\n    print(f\"Film: {movie_title}\")\n    print(f\"Year of Award: {award_year}\")\n    print(f\"The film shows the obelisk located in the {obelisk_location_in_film}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result.\nfind_first_best_picture_with_luxor_obelisk()\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
