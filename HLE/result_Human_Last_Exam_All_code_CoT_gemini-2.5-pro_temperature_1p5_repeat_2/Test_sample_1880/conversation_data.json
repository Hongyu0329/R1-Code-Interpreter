    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, I will follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, I will check if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. I will use Eisenstein's criterion for this purpose. An irreducible quartic polynomial has a transitive Galois group.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant of the polynomial is a key tool. The Galois group of the polynomial is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. For a polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the formula for the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic**: I will construct the resolvent cubic polynomial. The nature of its roots (whether they are rational or not) helps to distinguish between the possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ ($S_4, A_4, D_4, C_4, V_4$). For a polynomial $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is $g(t) = t^3 - 4qt - p^2$.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent and Determine the Group**: By analyzing whether the discriminant is a perfect square and counting the number of rational roots of the resolvent cubic, I can identify the specific Galois group.\n5.  **State the Order**: Once the Galois group is identified, its order is known.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan, showing the calculations at each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_galois_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the polynomial coefficients for the form x^4 + px + q\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    print(f\"Analyzing the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility using Eisenstein's Criterion\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Check for Irreducibility ---\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2:\")\n    print(\"1.
