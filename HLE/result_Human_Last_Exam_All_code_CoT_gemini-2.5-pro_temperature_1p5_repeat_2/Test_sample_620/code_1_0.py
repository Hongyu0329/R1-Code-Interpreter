Hypothesis: The non-linear curve is a 'lag phase' caused by cold-induced dissociation.
    1. Chilling on ice causes the active enzyme dimer to separate into inactive monomers (a phenomenon known as cold lability).
    2. When the assay is warmed for measurement, these inactive monomers slowly re-associate to form the active dimer.
    3. As more active dimer is formed over time, the reaction rate increases, resulting in an upward-curving, non-linear plot.
