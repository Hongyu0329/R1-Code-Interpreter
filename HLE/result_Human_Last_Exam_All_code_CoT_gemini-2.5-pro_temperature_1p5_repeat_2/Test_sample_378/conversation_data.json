    "Based on my research, the premise of your question is incorrect. Goodluck Jonathan did not adopt the name \"Azikiwe\" at a later date; it has been part of his name since birth. Therefore, there is no specific year in which he began to publicly identify with it in the way your question implies.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that prints out a clear explanation of this fact.\n\n```python\ndef get_name_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan's name.\n    It addresses the user's question by clarifying the facts.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThe question of which year Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe' is based on a mistaken premise. Here are the facts:\n\n1. His full birth name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n\n2. 'Azikiwe' is not a name he adopted later in life; it is one of his given names. It was reportedly given to him at birth.\n\n3. He is publicly and officially known by the name Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. He has not made a specific public announcement to begin using 'Azikiwe' as a primary identifier.\n\nTherefore, since 'Azikiwe' has always been a part of his legal name and was not adopted at a specific point in time, there is no specific year to provide as an answer.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\n# Execute the function to print the information\nget_name_information()\n```\n<<<There is no record of a specific year when Goodluck Jonathan started to publicly identify as 'Azikiwe' because it has been part of his official name since birth."
