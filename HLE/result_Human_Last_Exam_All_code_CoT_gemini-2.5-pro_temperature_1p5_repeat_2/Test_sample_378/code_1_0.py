The question of which year Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe' is based on a mistaken premise. Here are the facts:

1. His full birth name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.

2. 'Azikiwe' is not a name he adopted later in life; it is one of his given names. It was reportedly given to him at birth.

3. He is publicly and officially known by the name Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. He has not made a specific public announcement to begin using 'Azikiwe' as a primary identifier.

Therefore, since 'Azikiwe' has always been a part of his legal name and was not adopted at a specific point in time, there is no specific year to provide as an answer.
