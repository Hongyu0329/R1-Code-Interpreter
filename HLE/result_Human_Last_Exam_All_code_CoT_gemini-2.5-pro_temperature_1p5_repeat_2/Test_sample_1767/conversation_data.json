    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script to solve the problem.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Chern Numbers:** Assign the given Chern numbers (C=1 for each insulator) to two variables, `c1` and `c2`.\n2.  **Explain the Physics:** The Chern number is an additive topological invariant. When two Chern insulators are joined to form a single system (with negligible interaction at the boundary), the Chern number of the new, larger system is simply the sum of the individual Chern numbers. This is because the total number of chiral edge states at the outer boundary is the sum of those from each subsystem.\n3.  **Calculate the Total:** Sum the variables `c1` and `c2` to find the total Chern number, `c_total`.\n4.  **Display the Result:** Print the explanation, the full equation showing the individual numbers being added, and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the Chern number for each insulator.\nc1 = 1\nc2 = 1\n\n# Step 2: Explain the principle.\n# The Chern number is an additive topological quantum number.\n# When two systems are combined, the total Chern number is the sum\n# of the individual Chern numbers.\nprint(\"Principle: The Chern number of a composite system is the sum of the Chern numbers of its parts.\")\nprint(f\"Chern number of the first insulator (C1): {c1}\")\nprint(f\"Chern number of the second insulator (C2): {c2}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total Chern number of the junction.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Step 4: Display the final equation and the result.\n# The user requested to see each number in the final equation.\nprint(\"The calculation for the total Chern number (C_total) of the junction is:\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2 = {c1} + {c2}\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the Chern number of the junction is: {c_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 that connects laterally and have negligible tunneling barrier, what is the Chern number of this junction. \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
