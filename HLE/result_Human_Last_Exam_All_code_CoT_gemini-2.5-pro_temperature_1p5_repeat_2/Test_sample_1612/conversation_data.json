    "Here is my plan to solve this request:\n1.  First, I will identify the two types of Triple Crowns in MLB: one for batters and one for pitchers.\n2.  I will determine the number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n3.  I will determine the number of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that adds these two numbers together to find the total number of Triple Crown winners and prints the final equation and result.\n\n```python\n# The Triple Crown can be won by either a batter or a pitcher.\n# We need to count the unique players for each category and add them together.\n\n# Number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n# This includes players from both the American League and National League.\n# Players like Ted Williams and Rogers Hornsby who won multiple times are only counted once.\nnum_batting_winners = 16\n\n# Number of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown.\n# This includes players from both leagues.\n# Players like Walter Johnson, Sandy Koufax, and Lefty Grove are only counted once.\nnum_pitching_winners = 19\n\n# Calculate the total number of unique Triple Crown winners.\ntotal_winners = num_batting_winners + num_pitching_winners\n\n# Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(f\"Total Triple Crown Winners = Batting Winners + Pitching Winners\")\nprint(f\"Total Triple Crown Winners = {num_batting_winners} + {num_pitching_winners}\")\nprint(f\"Total = {total_winners}\")\n```\n<<<35>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
