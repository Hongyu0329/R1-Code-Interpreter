    "Here is a plan to determine the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`, and as it is an electron, its spin quantum number is `s=1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number `j` results from the coupling of `l` and `s`. The possible values for `j` are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series, which ranges from `|l-s|` to `l+s` in integer steps. In this case, `j` can be `|1 - 1/2| = 1/2` and `1 + 1/2 = 3/2`.\n3.  **Calculate Eigenvalues of J²:** The eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula `j(j+1)ħ²`. We will compute this value for each possible `j`.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues of Jz:** For each value of `j`, the associated magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps. The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by `m_j * ħ`. We will list all possible `m_j` values and the corresponding `J_z` eigenvalues for each `j`.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will create a Python script to perform these calculations. The script will use the `fractions` module to handle the half-integer values accurately and print the final results, showing the formulas and the plugged-in numbers for each calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z\n    for a p-electron (l=1, s=1/2).\n    \"\"\"\n    l = 1\n    s = Fraction(1, 2)\n    hbar_sq = \"ħ²\"\n    hbar = \"ħ\"\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with orbital quantum number l = {l} and spin s = {s}.\\n\")\n\n    # Determine the possible values of j\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    # Generate j values from j_min to j_max in steps of 1\n    j_values = [Fraction(j) for j in np.arange(j_min, j_max + 1, 1)]\n\n    print(f\"The possible total angular momentum quantum numbers (j) range from |l-s| to l+s:\")\n    print(f\"j = {', '.join(map(str, j_values))}\\n\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Iterate through each j value to find the eigenvalues\n    for j in j_values:\n        print(f\"For the case where j = {j}:\")\n\n        # Calculate eigenvalue of J^2\n        j_plus_1 = j + 1\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * j_plus_1\n        print(\"  1.
