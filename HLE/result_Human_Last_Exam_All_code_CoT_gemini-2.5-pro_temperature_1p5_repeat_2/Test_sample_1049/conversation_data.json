    "This is a complex summation problem. A direct calculation or a generating function approach can be very tedious and prone to errors. A more practical approach is to calculate the first few terms of the sum, guess the general form of the closed-form solution, and then determine the unknown coefficients.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Define the sum:**\n    Let the sum be denoted by $S_n$:\n    $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$\n    The term $\\binom{2k}{k}$ is the central binomial coefficient. The sum is a convolution of the sequence $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ with $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. It's known that sums of this type, which are convolutions involving central binomial coefficients, often result in a polynomial in $n$ multiplied by $4^n$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the first few terms of the sum:**\n    *   For $n=0$:\n        $S_0 = (2(0)+1)^5 \\binom{0}{0} \\binom{0}{0} = 1^5 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n    *   For $n=1$:\n        $S_1 = (2(0)+1)^5 \\binom{0}{0} \\binom{2}{1} + (2(1)+1)^5 \\binom{2}{1} \\binom{0}{0}$\n        $S_1 = 1^5 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 + 3^5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 2 + 243 \\cdot 2 = 2 + 486 = 488$.\n    *   For $n=2$:\n        $S_2 = (2(0)+1)^5 \\binom{0}{0} \\binom{4}{2} + (2(1)+1)^5 \\binom{2}{1} \\binom{2}{1} + (2(2)+1)^5 \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{0}{0}$\n        $S_2 = 1^5 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6 + 3^5 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 + 5^5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1 = 6 + 243 \\cdot 4 + 3125 \\cdot 6 = 6 + 972 + 18750 = 19728$.\n\n3.  **Hypothesize the form of the closed-form solution:**\n    Based on the calculated values and the structure of the sum, we assume the closed form is $S_n = P(n) \\cdot 4^n$, where $P(n)$ is a polynomial in $n$. Let's test for a common pattern where $P(n)$ has a factor of $(n+1)$. Let's assume $P(n) = (n+1)(an^2 + bn + c)$ for some coefficients $a, b, c$.\n\n4.  **Solve for the coefficients:**\n    We use the computed values of $S_n$ to find the values of $P(n)$:\n    *   For $n=0$: $P(0) = S_0 / 4^0 = 1 / 1 = 1$.\n        Using the formula for $P(n)$: $P(0) = (0+1)(a(0)^2 + b(0) + c) = c$. So, $c=1$.\n    *   For $n=1$: $P(1) = S_1 / 4^1 = 488 / 4 = 122$.\n        Using the formula: $P(1) = (1+1)(a(1)^2 + b(1) + 1) = 2(a+b+1)$.\n        So, $2(a+b+1) = 122 \\implies a+b+1=61 \\implies a+b=60$.\n    *   For $n=2$: $P(2) = S_2 / 4^2 = 19728 / 16 = 1233$.\n        Using the formula: $P(2) = (2+1)(a(2)^2 + b(2) + 1) = 3(4a+2b+1)$.\n        So, $3(4a+2b+1) = 1233 \\implies 4a+2b+1=411 \\implies 4a+2b=410 \\implies 2a+b=205$.\n\n5.  **Solve the system of linear equations:**\n    We have a system of two equations for $a$ and $b$:\n    1) $a + b = 60$\n    2) $2a + b = 205$\n    Subtracting equation (1) from (2) gives: $(2a+b) - (a+b) = 205 - 60 \\implies a = 145$.\n    Substituting $a=145$ back into equation (1): $145 + b = 60 \\implies b = 60 - 145 = -85$.\n\n6.  **State the final closed form:**\n    The coefficients are $a=145$, $b=-85$, and $c=1$.\n    The polynomial is $P(n) = (n+1)(145n^2 - 85n + 1)$.\n    Thus, the closed form for the sum is $S_n = (n+1)(145n^2 - 85n + 1)4^n$.\n\nThe following python code will print the coefficients of the final formula.\n\n```python\n# The closed form for the sum S_n is a polynomial in n multiplied by 4^n.\n# The formula is S_n = (n + 1) * (a*n^2 + b*n + c) * d^n\n\n# Coefficients of the polynomial part\na = 145\nb = -85\nc = 1\n\n# Base of the exponential part\nd = 4\n\nprint(\"The closed form for the sum is:\")\nprint(f\"(n + 1) * ({a}*n^2 + {b}*n + {c}) * {d}^n\")\n```\n<<<$(n+1)(145n^2 - 85n + 1)4^n$>>>"
