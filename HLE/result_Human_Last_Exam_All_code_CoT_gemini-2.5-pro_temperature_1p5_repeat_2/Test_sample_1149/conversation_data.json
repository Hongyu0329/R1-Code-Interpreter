    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the answer and present it as requested.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*. This is a specific paleontological fact that is not discoverable through calculation but through information retrieval from scientific literature.\n\n1.  I will access my knowledge base for information on the anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*, specifically focusing on the skull description.\n2.  The key scientific paper describing this feature is \"Irritator challengeri, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott (2002).\n3.  According to the description in that paper, the lacrimal recess (a cavity on the lacrimal bone) contains two large depressions or fossae.\n4.  I will then create a Python script. To fulfill the requirement of showing an equation, the script will represent the number '2' as the sum of '1 + 1'.\n5.  The script will then print a sentence that includes this equation to present the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The number of depressions is based on the paleontological description\n# of the Irritator challengeri skull by Sues et al. (2002).\n# The paper states there are two large depressions in the lacrimal recess.\n\n# We will represent the number 2 as a simple sum for the equation format.\npart1 = 1\npart2 = 1\ntotal_depressions = part1 + part2\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format, showing the full equation.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains a number of depressions calculated as: {part1} + {part2} = {total_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
