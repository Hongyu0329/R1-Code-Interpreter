    "This problem asks for the minimum number of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$. The standard interpretation of the problem, despite the slightly ambiguous phrasing \"minimum number of vertices in a family,\" is to find the minimum number of graphs in such a family. This is a classic problem in extremal graph theory.\n\nHere's my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Re-framing the Problem**: The core task is to find the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs, let's call this number `k`, whose edge sets together cover all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$.\n2.  **Applying the Theoretical Result**: This problem can be solved by assigning a binary vector to each vertex. If we use vectors of length `k`, we have $2^k$ possible unique vectors. To cover all edges of $K_n$, we must be able to assign a unique binary vector to each of the `n` vertices. For any pair of vertices, their connecting edge is guaranteed to be in one of the bipartite graphs if their assigned vectors differ in at least one position.\n3.  **Formulating the Equation**: The condition that `n` vertices can be assigned unique `k`-bit vectors requires that the number of available unique vectors, $2^k$, must be at least as large as the number of vertices, `n`. This gives us the inequality $2^k \\ge n$.\n4.  **Solving for k**: To find the minimum integer `k` that satisfies this inequality, we can take the base-2 logarithm of both sides, which gives $k \\ge \\log_2(n)$. Since `k` must be an integer, we take the ceiling of the result: $k = \\lceil \\log_2(n) \\rceil$.\n5.  **Executing with Python**: I will now provide a Python script that calculates this value for $n=35$ and prints the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_bipartite_covering(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the minimum number of bipartite graphs \n    needed to cover the edges of K_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum number of bipartite graphs, k.\n    # k is the smallest integer such that 2^k >= n.\n    # This is equivalent to k = ceil(log2(n)).\n    k = math.ceil(math.log2(n))\n\n    print(f\"For a complete graph K_n with n = {n} vertices:\")\n    print(\"We need to find the minimum number of bipartite graphs, k, to cover all its edges.\")\n    print(f\"This number is the smallest integer k satisfying 2^k >= {n}.\")\n    \n    # We can also find this by checking powers of 2.\n    power = 0\n    result = 1\n    while result < n:\n        power += 1\n        result *= 2\n    \n    print(\"\\nChecking powers of 2:\")\n    print(f\"2^({power - 1}) = {result // 2} (which is less than {n})\")\n    print(f\"2^{power} = {result} (which is greater than or equal to {n})\")\n    print(f\"So, the smallest integer power required is {power}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe formal calculation is k = ceil(log2(n)).\")\n    log_val = math.log2(n)\n    print(f\"log2({n}) is approximately {log_val:.4f}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"ceil(log2({n})) = {k}\")\n\n# Run the solution for n=35\nsolve_bipartite_covering(35)\n```\n<<<6>>>"
