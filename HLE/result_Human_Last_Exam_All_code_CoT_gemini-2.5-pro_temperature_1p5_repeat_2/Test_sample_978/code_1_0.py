    # --- Principles ---
    # Vicarious Liability: An employer is liable for the negligent acts of an employee
    # if the act was committed within the scope of their employment.
    # Joint and Several Liability: When multiple parties are liable, the injured party
    # can sue any one of them for the full amount of damages.
    # Proximate Cause: The primary or direct cause of an injury or damage. A cause that is
    # legally sufficient to result in liability.

    # --- Evaluate Answer Choices ---
    # Choice A: Incorrect. Neighbours are not liable, and Evergreen is liable for Lincoln's actions.
    # Choice B: Incorrect. Liability for the two events is separate. Mark is not liable for Lincoln's actions.
    # Choice C: Incorrect. Evergreen is also liable for Lincoln's actions due to vicarious liability.
    # Choice D: Incorrect. Minimal damage does not negate the existence of liability.
    # Choice E: Correct. Matches the conclusions for both events.
