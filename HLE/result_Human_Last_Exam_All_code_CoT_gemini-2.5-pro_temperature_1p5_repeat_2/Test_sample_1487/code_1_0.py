# The problem simplifies to a direct calculation after the mathematical derivation.
# The original expression to evaluate is:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / ((pi^2 / 6) - 1) + 10^15
#
# From the derivation, we found that:
# ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * ((pi^2 / 6) - 1)
#
# Substituting this into the expression gives:
# (2 * (1/2) * ((pi^2 / 6) - 1)) / ((pi^2 / 6) - 1) + 10^15
#
# This simplifies to:
# 1 + 10^15

# We will now compute this value and print the numbers in the final equation.
# For precision with large numbers, we use Python's arbitrary-precision integers.
