    Step 1: Analyze the patient's primary risk factors. The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of smoking 2 packs of cigarettes daily for over 20 years and alcohol use disorder. These are the two most significant risk factors for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC).

    Step 2: Evaluate the clinical presentation. The patient presents with substernal chest pain and odynophagia (pain with swallowing). These are hallmark symptoms of esophageal pathology, including malignancy. The elevated CRP and leukocytosis are non-specific inflammatory markers that can be associated with cancer.

    Step 3: Interpret the diagnostic findings. The imaging studies show esophageal lumen narrowing and wall thickening, which is highly suggestive of an infiltrative process within the esophageal wall. However, the endoscopy is negative for erythema, ulcers, or plaques.

    Step 4: Synthesize the findings and eliminate other options.
    - GERD (D), Herpes esophagitis (E), and Streptococcal esophagitis (A) are unlikely because the endoscopy did not show the characteristic mucosal changes (inflammation, ulcers, plaques) associated with these conditions.
    - Esophageal adenocarcinoma (B) is less likely. Its main risk factor is chronic GERD and Barrett's esophagus, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Her risk factors strongly favor SCC.
    - Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (C) is the most likely diagnosis. It can present as an infiltrative, submucosal tumor that causes wall thickening and narrowing (seen on imaging) without necessarily showing a visible lesion on the mucosal surface during endoscopy. This presentation perfectly reconciles the imaging and endoscopic findings in a patient with a classic risk profile for SCC.
