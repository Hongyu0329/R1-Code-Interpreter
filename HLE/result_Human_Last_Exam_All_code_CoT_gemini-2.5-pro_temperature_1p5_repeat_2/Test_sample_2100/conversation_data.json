    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** The riddle provides several key pieces of information:\n    *   The person was called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky.\n    *   Voznesensky wrote a poem wondering where the man's grave was.\n    *   The location of the grave was discovered in the late 1980s.\n\n2.  **Identify the Poem and its Subject:** The famous quote comes from Voznesensky's poem \"Saga,\" which forms the basis for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\" The poem is about the Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\n3.  **Verify the Grave's History:** Nikolai Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. The cathedral was demolished in the 1930s by the Soviet government, and his grave was thought to be lost. In the late 1980s, following renewed interest in his story (partly due to the success of \"Juno and Avos\"), a presumptive grave site was identified, and a monument was erected. This timeline matches the clue perfectly.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Answer:** The man described in the riddle is Nikolai Rezanov. His last name is Rezanov.\n\n5.  **Create the Python Script:** I will now write a simple Python script to store and print the last name.\n\n```python\ndef find_last_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle based on the provided clues.\n    \n    Clues:\n    1. Called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by Andrei Voznesensky.\n    2. Voznesensky wondered about the location of his grave.\n    3. The grave's location was discovered in the late 1980s.\n    \n    The clues point to the Russian explorer Nikolai Rezanov, the subject of\n    Voznesensky's poem \"Saga,\" which later became the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The last name of the historical figure is Rezanov.\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n    \n    print(f\"The last name of the man is: {last_name}\")\n\nfind_last_name()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
