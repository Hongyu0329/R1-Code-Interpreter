# This script identifies the product of a two-step organic reaction.

# Step 1: Directed ortho-metalation of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.
# The reagents sec-BuLi and TMEDA are a strong base system.
# The reaction is directed by the two existing groups on the benzene ring:
# - The N,N-diethylamide group at position 1.
# - The dimethylamino group at position 3.
# The most acidic proton is at position 2, which is ortho to both groups.
# This results in the formation of a 2-lithio intermediate.

# Step 2: Electrophilic quench with methyl iodide.
# The 2-lithio intermediate is a strong nucleophile.
# It reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH3I).
# A methyl group (-CH3) replaces the lithium at position 2.

# The resulting compound has the original structure with an added methyl group at position 2.
# The position numbers in the name are 2 and 3.
