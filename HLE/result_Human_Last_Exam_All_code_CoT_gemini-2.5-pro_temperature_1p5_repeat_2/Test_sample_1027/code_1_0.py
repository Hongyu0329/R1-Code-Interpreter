# Step 1 & 2: Structural analysis of G and its homology.
# The group G is isomorphic to an amalgamated product F *_F F, where F is Thompson's group.
# Using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for group homology for the amalgamated product G = A *_C B,
# where A, B, and C are all isomorphic to F, we get a long exact sequence:
# ... -> H_n(C) -> H_n(A) + H_n(B) -> H_n(G) -> H_{n-1}(C) -> ...
# Since the inclusions C -> A and C -> B are isomorphisms for F, the maps on homology are isomorphisms.
# The sequence implies that H_n(G, R) is isomorphic to H_n(F, R) for n >= 1.
# So, dim(H_31(G, R)) = dim(H_31(F, R)).

# Step 3: Compute the dimension of the homology group of F.
# The homology of Thompson's group F is a subject of active research.
# H_1(F, Z) is Z^2.
# H_2(F, Z) is 0.
# It is a well-known conjecture in mathematics that H_n(F, Z) = 0 for all n >= 3.
# If this conjecture holds, the dimension of the homology with real coefficients is also zero.
# We will proceed assuming this conjecture is correct.

# The dimension of the 31st homology group of F with real coefficients.
# Let dim_H31_F be this dimension.
dim_H31_F = 0

# The dimension of the 31st homology group of G is equal to that of F.
dim_H31_G = dim_H31_F

# Final equation: dim(H_31(G)) = dim(H_31(F))
# We print the numbers in the final equation.
print(f"dim(H_31(G)) = {dim_H31_G}")
print(f"Based on the reasoning that dim(H_31(G)) = dim(H_31(F)), and the conjecture that dim(H_31(F)) = 0.")

# The final result is the dimension of the homology of G.
final_dimension = dim_H31_G
print(f"The computed dimension is: {final_dimension}")
