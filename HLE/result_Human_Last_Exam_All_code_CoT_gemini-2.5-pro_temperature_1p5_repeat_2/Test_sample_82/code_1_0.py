    # Va: Additive genetic variance
    # Vd: Dominance genetic variance (non-linear effects at the same locus)
    # Vi: Epistatic genetic variance (non-linear gene-gene interactions)
    # The fundamental equation is: Vg = Va + Vd + Vi
    
    # Narrow-sense heritability (h2) is the proportion of variance from additive effects:
    # h2 = Va / Vp

    # the effects of individual SNPs. Therefore, the variance it explains (R2_PGS)
    # is a measure of the additive genetic variance. In the best-case scenario
    # (e.g., an infinitely large GWAS), R2_PGS approaches h2.

    print("Conclusion: Statement B is NOT necessarily true.")
    
    # --- Statement C ---
    print("\n[C] Given an arbitrarily large GWAS, the polygenic score constructed via linearly summing GWAS effect sizes will not approach a variance explained of 50% due to gene-gene interactions and other non-linear effects such as dominance.")
    print("This statement asserts that non-additive effects (Vd or Vi) MUST exist (i.e., Vd + Vi > 0), causing h² to be strictly less than 0.5.")
