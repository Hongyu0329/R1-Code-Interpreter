# This script calculates the finite blow-up time for the linearized version
# of the given Cauchy problem.

# Plan:
# 1. The linearized equation in Fourier space is: d(u_hat)/dt = |k|^2 * (1+t) * u_hat
# 2. The solution is u_hat(k,t) = u_hat_0(k) * exp(|k|^2 * (t + t^2/2)).
# 3. We assume a smooth initial condition u_0, whose Fourier transform u_hat_0(k)
#    has a Gaussian decay: |u_hat_0(k)| ~ exp(-a * |k|^2). For this example, we set a = 0.5.
# 4. The L^2 norm of the solution u(t) involves integrating |u_hat(k,t)|^2.
#    The integrand behaves like: exp(-|k|^2) * exp(2 * |k|^2 * (t + t^2/2)) = exp(|k|^2 * (t^2 + 2t - 1)).
# 5. The integral converges only if the exponent's prefactor is negative, i.e., t^2 + 2t - 1 < 0.
# 6. The blow-up time T is the point where this condition is first violated, i.e., when t^2 + 2t - 1 = 0.
