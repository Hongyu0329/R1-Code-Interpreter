    This function solves the mathematical problem regarding topological groups on the integers.

    The problem asks for the number of totally bounded group topologies on the integers (Z)
    that have no nontrivial convergent sequences.

    A rigorous mathematical proof demonstrates that no such topologies exist.
    The proof is structured in two cases:

    1.  The topology is Hausdorff: In this case, we can show that the sequence
        of factorials, x_k = k!, is a nontrivial sequence that converges to 0.
        This is because for any open subgroup mZ (which must exist by the totally
        bounded property), k! is a multiple of m for all k >= m.

    2.  The topology is not Hausdorff: In this case, the intersection of all
        open neighborhoods of 0 is a nontrivial subgroup, nZ, for some n > 1.
        The sequence x_k = k*n is a nontrivial sequence whose terms all lie
        within nZ, and therefore within every open neighborhood of 0. Thus,
        this sequence converges to 0.

    Since any totally bounded group topology on Z must have a nontrivial
    convergent sequence, the number of topologies satisfying the given
    conditions is 0.
