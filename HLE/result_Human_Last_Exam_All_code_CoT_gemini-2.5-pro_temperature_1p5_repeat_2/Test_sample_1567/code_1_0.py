# The problem is to find the maximal integer k such that for any choice of k
# d-dimensional probability measures (d >= 3), a controlled random walk is
# guaranteed to be transient.

# Based on known results in the theory of random walks, the threshold for being able
# to construct a recurrent walk with k measures in d dimensions is k > 2d - 2.
# This means for k <= 2d - 2, any choice of k measures results in a transient walk.

# The question asks for a single value of k that works for all d >= 3.
# So, k must be less than or equal to 2d - 2 for all d >= 3.
# k <= min_{d>=3} (2d - 2)

# The function f(d) = 2d - 2 is increasing with d, so its minimum
# for d >= 3 is at d = 3.
d_min = 3

# Calculate the value of 2d - 2 for this minimal d.
k_max = 2 * d_min - 2

# Outputting the numbers involved in the final calculation and the result.
# The calculation is 2 * 3 - 2.
num1 = 2
num2 = d_min
num3 = 2
result = k_max
