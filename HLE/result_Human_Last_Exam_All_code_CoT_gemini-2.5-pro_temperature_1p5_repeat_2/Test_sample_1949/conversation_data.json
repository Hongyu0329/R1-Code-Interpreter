    "To identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Compile a list:** I will create a list of the major terrestrial rivers mentioned by Virgil in the Aeneid.\n2.  **Gather Data:** For each river, I will find its approximate modern length in kilometers.\n3.  **Analyze and Rank:** I will then sort this list of rivers from longest to shortest.\n4.  **Present the Result:** Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this data, performs the sorting, and prints the top three longest rivers along with their lengths.\n\n```python\nimport operator\n\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n\n    The script contains a dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their\n    approximate real-world lengths in kilometers. It then sorts these rivers\n    to find the top three longest and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of prominent rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their lengths (km)\n    # References can be found in various books, e.g., Aeneid VI.799 (Ganges),\n    # VI.800 (Nile), VIII.726 (Euphrates), VIII.727 (Danube/Hister).\n    rivers = {\n        'Nile': 6650,\n        'Danube (Hister)': 2850,\n        'Euphrates': 2800,\n        'Ganges': 2525,\n        'Rhine': 1233,\n        'Po (Eridanus)': 652,\n        'Tiber': 406\n    }\n\n    # Sort the dictionary by length in descending order\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three_rivers):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {river}: {length} km\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile (6650 km), the Danube (2850 km), and the Euphrates (2800 km).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
