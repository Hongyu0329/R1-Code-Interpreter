    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  First, I will research the history of the town of Bártfa (modern-day Bardejov) to identify its leadership structure in the 15th century.\n2.  I will then search historical records and academic sources for the specific name of the judge (known as 'bíró' in Hungarian or 'Richter' in German, a role equivalent to a mayor) for the year 1461.\n3.  Finally, I will write a simple Python script that stores this information in variables and prints the answer in a clear, formatted sentence, fulfilling the request for a coded solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides historical information about the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n    The information is based on historical records for the medieval Kingdom of Hungary.\n    \"\"\"\n    year = 1461\n    town_name_historical = \"Bártfa\"\n    town_name_modern = \"Bardejov\"\n    \n    # Historical records indicate Alexius Gábel was the judge (Richter/bíró) in this year.\n    judge_name = \"Alexius Gábel\"\n    \n    # In Hungarian, his name was Gábel Elek.\n    judge_name_hungarian = \"Gábel Elek\"\n\n    print(f\"The judge of {town_name_historical} (now {town_name_modern}) in {year} was {judge_name}.\")\n    print(f\"His name in Hungarian records is often listed as {judge_name_hungarian}.\")\n    print(\"The role of a 'judge' in a royal free town during this period was the chief administrative and judicial officer, similar to a mayor.\")\n\nfind_judge_of_bartfa()\n```\n<<<Alexius Gábel>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Who was the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
