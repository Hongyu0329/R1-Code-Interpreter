    "Of course. The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts is not a single universal value but depends on the synthesis method and specific reaction conditions. However, many experimental studies in scientific literature point to an optimal range. A frequently reported optimal composition for reactions like Water-Gas Shift is around 10% Nickel by weight (wt%) loaded onto a Ceria (CeO₂) support.\n\nTo answer your question, I will provide a Python script that calculates the atomic (molar) ratio of Ni to Ce for such a 10 wt% catalyst. This calculation converts the macroscopic weight percentages into the fundamental atomic ratio you're asking about. The script will show each step of the calculation.\n\nHere is the plan for the script:\n1.  Define the atomic masses of Nickel (Ni), Cerium (Ce), and Oxygen (O).\n2.  Set the weight percentage of Ni, using 10 wt% as a representative optimal value from research.\n3.  Assume a 100g sample of the catalyst. From this, determine the mass of Ni and the mass of the Ceria (CeO₂) support.\n4.  Calculate the mass of just the Cerium within the Ceria support.\n5.  Convert the mass of Ni and Ce into moles.\n6.  Calculate the final Ni/Ce atomic ratio and print the entire calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Ni/Ce atomic ratio for a Ni-Ceria catalyst\n    based on a given weight percentage of Nickel.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define constants ---\n    # Atomic mass in g/mol\n    ATOMIC_MASS_NI = 58.69\n    ATOMIC_MASS_CE = 140.12\n    ATOMIC_MASS_O = 16.00\n\n    # Molar mass of Ceria (CeO2)\n    MOLAR_MASS_CEO2 = ATOMIC_MASS_CE + 2 * ATOMIC_MASS_O\n\n    # --- Step 2: Define catalyst composition from literature ---\n    # A common optimal value is 10 wt% Ni on CeO2.\n    ni_weight_percent = 10.0\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the atomic Ni/Ce ratio for a catalyst with {ni_weight_percent} wt% Ni on CeO2.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Assume a 100g sample and find component masses ---\n    total_catalyst_mass = 100.0  # grams\n    mass_ni = ni_weight_percent # In a 100g sample, wt% equals mass in g.\n    mass_ceo2 = total_catalyst_mass - mass_ni\n\n    print(f\"Basis: {total_catalyst_mass}g of catalyst.\")\n    print(f\"Mass of Ni = {mass_ni}g\")\n    print(f\"Mass of CeO2 = {mass_ceo2}g\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Calculate mass of Ce in CeO2 ---\n    mass_ce = mass_ceo2 * (ATOMIC_MASS_CE / MOLAR_MASS_CEO2)\n\n    # --- Step 5: Convert mass to moles for both Ni and Ce ---\n    moles_ni = mass_ni / ATOMIC_MASS_NI\n    moles_ce = mass_ce / ATOMIC_MASS_CE\n    \n    print(\"--- Moles Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Equation for Ni moles: Mass / Atomic Mass\")\n    print(f\"Moles Ni = {mass_ni}g / {ATOMIC_MASS_NI} g/mol = {moles_ni:.4f} mol\")\n    print(f\"\\nEquation for Ce moles: (Mass CeO2 * (Atomic Mass Ce / Molar Mass CeO2)) / Atomic Mass Ce\")\n    print(f\"Moles Ce = ({mass_ceo2}g * ({ATOMIC_MASS_CE} / {MOLAR_MASS_CEO2:.2f})) / {ATOMIC_MASS_CE} g/mol = {moles_ce:.4f} mol\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 6: Calculate the final atomic ratio ---\n    atomic_ratio = moles_ni / moles_ce\n\n    print(\"--- Final Atomic Ratio Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Equation: Ni/Ce Ratio = Moles Ni / Moles Ce\")\n    print(f\"Ni/Ce Ratio = {moles_ni:.4f} / {moles_ce:.4f} = {atomic_ratio:.2f}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_ni_ce_ratio()\n<<<0.33>>>"
