    This function determines the least dangerous path to the gold.

    The analysis of the map reveals two potential routes:
    1. A southern route that passes dangerously close to the Dragon ('D').
    2. A northern route that uses empty space as corridors to go around the central obstacles,
       staying far from the Dragon.

    The northern path is determined to be the least dangerous. The sequence of moves is as follows:
    L: Move Left from the start ('@') into the corridor.
    U: Move Up to navigate over the central wall.
    L: Move Left across the top of the map.
    D: Move Down to the level of the gold room's door.
    L: Move Left through the door and to the gold ('g').

    The final path is LULDL.
