    "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal way to pack smaller 9x1x1 blocks into a larger 15x15x15 cube. A simple volume division (`(15*15*15) / (9*1*1) = 375`) gives a theoretical maximum, but it doesn't account for the wasted space that occurs due to the shapes not fitting together perfectly.\n\nMy plan is to use a greedy approach, which is very effective for this type of packing problem. I will systematically fill the large cube with blocks in stages:\n\n1.  **First, I will pack the largest possible rectangular slab** within the cube, aligning the blocks' long dimension (9) with one of the cube's dimensions (15).\n2.  **Next, I will take the remaining volume** and repeat the process, packing as many blocks as possible into this new, smaller space. This may require changing the orientation of the blocks.\n3.  **I will continue this process recursively**, calculating the number of blocks that fit in each new leftover space, until no more blocks can be placed.\n4.  **Finally, I will sum the number of blocks** from each stage to get the total.\n\nThis method ensures that we account for the geometry of the problem and the wasted space in a structured way.\n\n```python\ndef solve_packing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit in a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    cube_edge = 15\n    block_long = 9\n    block_short = 1\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Initial Packing ---\n    # We start with the 15x15x15 cube.
