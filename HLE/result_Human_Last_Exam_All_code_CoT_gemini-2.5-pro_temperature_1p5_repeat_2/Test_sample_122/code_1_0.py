    # The final observed color is orange, which is a mix of red and yellow pigments.
    # Our goal is to find a scenario that results in this specific mix.

    # Step 1: How can red pigment be present?
    # The first metabolic pathway is:
    # yellow --(enzyme A)--> red --(enzyme B)--> blue_intermediate --(enzyme C)--> colorless
    # For the 'red' intermediate to accumulate, enzyme A must be present,
    # but enzyme B must be absent to block the next step.
    # This leads to the primary deduction:
    missing_enzyme = 'B'

    # Step 2: With enzyme B missing, how can yellow also be present?
    # If enzyme B is missing, any yellow pigment will be converted to red via enzyme A.
    # To get an orange color (red + yellow), there must be a persistent source of yellow.
    # A simple patch of original yellow pigment would just turn completely red.

    # Step 3: Consider the other pathway as a source of yellow.
    # The second pathway is:
    # blue --(enzyme D)--> yellow
    # If the original patch was blue, enzyme D (which is present) would create yellow.
    
    # Step 4: Combine the deductions into a complete scenario.
    # If the original patch was blue and the microbe is missing enzyme B:
    # 1. The original 'blue' pigment is converted to 'yellow' by enzyme D.
    # 2. This 'yellow' product is then converted to 'red' by enzyme A.
    # 3. The process stops here because enzyme B is missing.
    # The overall chain is: blue -> yellow -> red.
    # In a blocked metabolic chain like this, both the intermediate (yellow) and the
    # final product (red) will be present, resulting in an orange color.
    original_color = 'blue'
