    "This problem requires designing a secure (t, n) threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol. The ideal choice for this is a scheme based on BLS (Boneh–Lynn–Shacham) signatures due to their deterministic nature and algebraic properties that allow for non-interactive aggregation. A two-round protocol enhances security and coordination.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Scheme Foundation**: The design will be based on the BLS signature scheme over a pairing-friendly elliptic curve (specifically, BLS12-381).\n2.  **Key Generation (Distributed Key Generation - DKG)**:\n    *   A trusted dealer (or a DKG protocol) will define a secret polynomial `f(x)` of degree `t-1`.\n    *   The master secret key will be `msk = f(0)`. The master public key will be `mpk = g * msk`, where `g` is a generator point on the curve.\n    *   Each of the `n` participants receives a secret share `sk_i = f(i)` and the corresponding public verification key `pk_i = g * sk_i`.\n3.  **Two-Round Signing Protocol**: To sign a message `m`, a group of `t` or more participants must collaborate.\n    *   **Round 1 (Commitment)**: Each participating signer `i` publicly announces their commitment to sign the message `m`. This ensures all participants agree on the message to be signed before revealing their partial signatures, preventing certain attacks. In a simple implementation, this is an \"intent to sign\" broadcast.\n    *   **Round 2 (Partial Signature Generation)**: After receiving `t-1` commitments from other participants, each signer `i` computes their partial signature `sigma_i = H(m) * sk_i`, where `H(m)` is the hash of the message mapped to an elliptic curve point. They then broadcast `sigma_i`.\n4.  **Signature Aggregation**:\n    *   An aggregator (who can be one of the signers) collects at least `t` valid partial signatures.\n    *   The aggregator calculates the Lagrange coefficient `L_i` for each signer `i`.\n    *   The final signature `sigma` is computed by taking a linear combination of the partial signatures: `sigma = Σ (L_i * sigma_i)`.\n5.  **Verification**: Anyone can verify the final signature `sigma` using the master public key `mpk` by checking if the pairing equation `e(g, sigma) == e(mpk, H(m))` holds.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this entire process, from key generation to verification, and clearly prints out the mathematical components of the final signature equation.\n\n```python\nimport secrets\n# This code requires the py_ecc library.
