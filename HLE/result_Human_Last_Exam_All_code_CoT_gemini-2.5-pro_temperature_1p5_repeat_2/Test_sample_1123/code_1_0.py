# The problem asks to identify the molecule responsible for the difference in reactivity
# between two photoaffinity probes.

# Probe 1: Contains a 4-hydroxyphenyl group (a phenol).
# Reaction with Probe 1 and light gives a strong fluorescent signal.

# Probe 2: Contains a 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl group (a benzyl alcohol).
# Reaction with Probe 2 and light gives a much weaker fluorescent signal.

# The key difference is the functional group: phenol vs. benzyl alcohol.
# The reaction is initiated by a photosensitizer and light.

# In the presence of an excited photosensitizer, the phenol group of Probe 1
# can undergo hydrogen atom abstraction from its hydroxyl (-OH) group.
# This event generates a highly reactive species.

# Let's analyze the species generated:
species_from_probe1 = 'Phenoxyl radical'
species_from_probe2 = 'No phenoxyl radical formed efficiently'

# This difference in the ability to form a phenoxyl radical directly explains
# the observed difference in protein labeling and, consequently, the fluorescent signal.
# The phenoxyl radical is the key intermediate that makes Probe 1 much more reactive.

print("Analysis of the reaction:")
print("1. The experiment uses photoaffinity labeling, where light activates a probe to react with proteins.")
print("2. The key difference between the highly reactive probe and the less reactive probe is a phenol group versus a benzyl alcohol group.")
print("3. Under light irradiation with a photosensitizer, the phenol group of the first probe is oxidized.")
print("4. This oxidation step forms a highly reactive 'phenoxyl radical'.")
print("5. This radical intermediate is responsible for the efficient labeling of proteins, leading to a strong fluorescent signal.")
print("6. The second probe lacks a phenol group and cannot form this radical, which explains its much lower reactivity.")
print("7. Therefore, the phenoxyl radical is the molecule that directly leads to the observed fluorescent difference.")
