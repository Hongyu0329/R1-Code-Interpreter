    "This is a classic E2 elimination problem involving stereochemistry in a cyclohexane ring. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants**:\n    *   **Substrate**: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The specific stereochemistry (1S, 2R) indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are *trans* to each other.\n    *   **Reagent**: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. This strongly favors the E2 (bimolecular elimination) mechanism.\n\n2.  **Understand the Mechanism**:\n    *   The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Br) and the proton (H) to be removed must be in an **anti-periplanar** arrangement.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the proton must be **trans-diaxial** (one axial-up, the other axial-down).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Chair Conformations**:\n    *   We need to draw the two possible chair conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n    *   **Conformer A**: Places the bulky methyl group in the more stable equatorial position. Because the bromo and methyl groups are trans, the bromo group must be in the axial position. So, we have **axial-Br** and **equatorial-Me**.\n    *   **Conformer B (after ring flip)**: Places the methyl group in the axial position and the bromo group in the equatorial position. So, we have **equatorial-Br** and **axial-Me**.\n    *   Conformer A is more stable because the very bulky methyl group is equatorial.\n\n4.  **Apply the E2 Rule**:\n    *   The E2 reaction *must* proceed from a conformation where the leaving group (Br) is **axial**. Therefore, the reaction occurs via **Conformer A**.\n    *   Now, we look for protons on carbons adjacent to the carbon with the bromine (C1). These are C2 and C6. The proton must be axial to be anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n    *   **On C2**: The methyl group is equatorial. Therefore, the hydrogen on C2 is axial. However, it is on the same side as the axial bromine (syn-periplanar), not on the opposite side. Elimination cannot occur here.\n    *   **On C6**: There is an axial hydrogen which is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will attack this available axial hydrogen on C6.\n\n5.  **Identify the Product**:\n    *   Since the proton is removed from C6 and the bromine is removed from C1, the double bond forms between C1 and C6.\n    *   The resulting product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the explanation and the final product name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the E2 reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)\"\n\n    print(\"--- Reaction Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Substrate: {substrate}\")\n    print(f\"Reagent: {reagent}\")\n    print(\"This is an E2 elimination reaction.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Stereochemical Requirement ---\")\n    print(\"The E2 mechanism requires an anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) arrangement\")\n    print(\"between the leaving group (Br) and the proton (H) to be eliminated.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Conformation Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"For {substrate}, the bromo and methyl groups are trans.\")\n    print(\"The reaction must proceed from the chair conformation where the leaving group (Br) is axial.\")\n    print(\"This conformer has an axial Bromine and an equatorial Methyl group.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Identifying the Proton for Elimination ---\")\n    print(\"We check the protons on the carbons adjacent to the one bearing the Bromine (C1).\")\n    print(\"Proton on C2: This proton is axial, but it is *syn* to the axial Br.
