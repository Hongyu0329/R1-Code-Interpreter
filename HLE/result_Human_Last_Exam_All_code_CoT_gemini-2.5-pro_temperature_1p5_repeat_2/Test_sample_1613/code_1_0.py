# Let's find the number of ways to choose two distinct trees from this set,
# one to block E and one to block F. This is an ordered selection, which is a permutation.

# Number of choices for the tree that blocks E (T_E).
choices_for_TE = num_possible_blocking_trees

# So, the number of choices for T_F is one less than the initial set.
choices_for_TF = num_possible_blocking_trees - 1
print(f"The number of choices for the tree blocking F must be different, so it is: {choices_for_TF}")

# The total number of possible locations for the children is the product of the choices.
# This is equivalent to the number of 2-permutations of 4 items, P(4, 2).
max_children = choices_for_TE * choices_for_TF

# Final equation output
