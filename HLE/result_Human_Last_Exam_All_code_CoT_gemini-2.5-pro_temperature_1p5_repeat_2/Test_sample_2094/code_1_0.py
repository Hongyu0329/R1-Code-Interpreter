def find_hook_flash_champions():
    """
    Identifies which champions can perform a hook-flash, which involves
    hooking in one direction and flashing in the opposite direction to
    increase the hook's effective range.

    The check is based on known game mechanics as of Season 14 (2024).
    - Thresh: Can flash during the Q cast animation, which updates the hook's
      origin point, effectively extending its range. This is the classic example.
    - Blitzcrank/Nautilus: Their hooks are simple projectiles. Flashing after
      the cast does not affect the projectile's path.
    - Pyke: Can flash during his Q channel, but this repositions him before the
      throw; it doesn't extend the hook projectile's travel distance in the
      same way Thresh's mechanic does.
