    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the structure of the unknown hydrocarbon:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula $C_7H_{14}$ has a degree of unsaturation of 1, indicating either one double bond or one ring.\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**: The chemical shifts (especially >100 ppm) suggest the presence of a C=C double bond. We will analyze the multiplicity (s, t, d, q) of each signal to determine the type of carbon (C, CH, CH2, CH3).\n3.  **Count Carbons and Hydrogens**: The molecular formula has 7 carbons, but there are only 6 NMR signals. This implies that one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbons. By counting the hydrogens indicated by the multiplicities and comparing to the molecular formula, we can deduce which signal represents the two equivalent carbons.\n4.  **Identify Structural Fragments**: Based on the NMR data, we will identify the key pieces of the molecule.\n5.  **Assemble the Structure**: We will connect the identified fragments to form a complete, valid chemical structure. The correct structure must be consistent with all the data, including the requirement for two equivalent carbons.\n6.  **Verify and Name the Compound**: We will check if the proposed structure's predicted NMR spectrum matches the given data and then determine its correct IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the IUPAC name of C7H14 from its 13C NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Analyze Formula and NMR Data ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing Molecular Formula and 13C NMR Data\")\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    degree_of_unsaturation = 1  # From CnH2n formula\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n    print(f\"Molecular Formula: {molecular_formula} (Degree of Unsaturation = {degree_of_unsaturation})\")\n    print(\"This indicates one double bond or one ring.\")\n    print(\"\\nNMR Data Breakdown:\")\n    print(\"145 ppm (s): Quaternary C (no H), likely part of a C=C bond.\")\n    print(\"112 ppm (t): CH2 group (2H), likely a terminal =CH2 of a C=C bond.\")\n    print(\"48 ppm (t):  CH2 group (2H), sp3 hybridized.\")\n    print(\"27 ppm (d):  CH group (1H), sp3 hybridized.\")\n    print(\"22 ppm (q):  CH3 group (3H), sp3 hybridized.\")\n    print(\"21 ppm (q):  CH3 group (3H), sp3 hybridized.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Count Carbons and Hydrogens ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Counting Carbons and Hydrogens\")\n    num_signals = len(nmr_signals)\n    num_carbons_in_formula = 7\n    print(f\"There are {num_signals} signals for {num_carbons_in_formula} carbons, so one signal must represent two equivalent carbons.\")\n    \n    h_from_signals = 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3\n    h_in_formula = 14\n    h_difference = h_in_formula - h_from_signals\n    print(f\"The sum of hydrogens from multiplicities (s=0, t=2, d=1, q=3) is {h_from_signals}.\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula requires {h_in_formula} hydrogens.\")\n    print(f\"The difference is {h_difference} hydrogens, which corresponds to one CH3 group.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: One of the quartet (q) signals must represent two equivalent CH3 groups.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Step 4 & 5: Assemble Fragments ---\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Assembling the Structure\")\n    print(\"From the data, we can identify the following fragments:\")\n    print(\" - A >C=CH2 group (from 145(s) and 112(t))\")\n    print(\" - A -CH2- group (from 48(t))\")\n    print(\" - A -CH- group (from 27(d))\")\n    print(\" - A unique -CH3 group (from one q signal, e.g., 21(q))\")\n    print(\" - Two equivalent -CH3 groups (from the other q signal, e.g., 22(q))\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nLet's assemble these pieces.
