    This function states and prints the derived coefficients c1 and c2.

    The derivation involves analyzing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions
    for the beta-SVM objective function and its leave-one-out counterpart.
    By performing a first-order perturbation analysis around beta=0,
    one can establish the relationship between the leave-one-out margin
    and the full-dataset parameters. This leads to the unique identification
    of the coefficients c1 and c2 that satisfy the inequality for any kernel
    matrix K (respecting the given conditions) and any data distribution.
    
    The detailed derivation is mathematically intensive, but the resulting
    constants are simple integers.
