    godel_explanation = """
    Gödel's proof is not a scientific or physical theory. It is a formal proof
    within the framework of modal logic (specifically, S5). It starts with a
    set of 5 axioms and 3 definitions. It defines a "God-like being" as one
    that possesses all "positive properties" (e.g., omnipotence, omniscience, etc.).
    The proof then demonstrates, through strict logical deduction within that system,
    that if such a system of logic and properties is coherent, then a "God-like being"
    must necessarily exist. The proof's validity is about logical consistency, not
    physical reality.

    qm_explanation = """
    The mathematics of QM is a framework for describing the physical world at the
    subatomic level. Its core components are:
    - Hilbert Spaces: Abstract vector spaces where the state of a system is represented.
    - Operators: Mathematical objects that correspond to physical observables (e.g., position, momentum).
    - Schrödinger Equation: A differential equation describing how a quantum state evolves over time.
    QM is used to calculate probabilities of measurement outcomes. It is a tool for physics,
    designed to model and predict the behavior of particles and energy.

    Asking QM to prove Gödel's argument is like asking the rules of chess to
    prove a theorem in calculus. The tools are not interchangeable. QM math
    describes 'what is' in the physical universe, while Gödel's proof explores
    'what must be' within a specific logical structure. There is no known
    mapping or function that can translate the concepts of modal logic
    (like 'necessity' or 'positive property') into the mathematical objects of QM
    (like wavefunctions or operators).
