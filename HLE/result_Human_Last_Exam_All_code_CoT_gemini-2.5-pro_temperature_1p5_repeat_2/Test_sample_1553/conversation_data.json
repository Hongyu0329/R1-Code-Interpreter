    "Here is my plan to answer your question. First, I need to access my knowledge base to identify the main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\". Then, I will determine the name of the character with whom the main character has a relationship equivalent to marriage. Finally, I will write a simple Python script to store this name in a variable and print it as the answer, fulfilling the request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_novel_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the character that the protagonist of\n    Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" marries.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The protagonist of the novel is Adam Zamoyski.\n    # While the concept of marriage is complex in the book's post-human setting,\n    # his primary partner and the character he forms the deepest bond with is Angelina.\n    character_name = \"Angelina\"\n\n    print(f\"The main character of 'Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość' marries a character named: {character_name}\")\n\nsolve_novel_question()\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"
