    "Based on Terraria's game mechanics, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players. Here is the step-by-step plan to calculate the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu:\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode. This value is 3640 HP.\n2.  **Understand the Scaling Formula:** Boss health increases by 35% for each player in the world after the first one. The formula is: `Total Health = Base Health * (1 + 0.35 * (Number of Players - 1))`.\n3.  **Find the Scaling Cap:** The \"infinite number of players\" condition is limited by the game's code. Terraria stops increasing boss health when the player count reaches 255. Therefore, we will use 255 as the effective player count for the calculation.\n4.  **Calculate the Maximum Health:** We will plug the base health (3640) and the maximum effective player count (255) into the scaling formula to determine the final health value.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan and prints the full equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_terraria_boss_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the constants based on game mechanics.\n    base_health = 3640  # Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Expert Mode.\n    health_increase_per_player = 0.35  # 35% health increase per additional player.\n    max_players_for_scaling = 255  # The game caps health scaling at 255 players.\n\n    # Step 2: The number of players that contribute to the health increase\n    # is the total number of players minus the first one.\n    extra_players = max_players_for_scaling - 1\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total health multiplier.\n    total_multiplier = 1 + (health_increase_per_player * extra_players)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final maximum health.\n    max_health = base_health * total_multiplier\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers.\n    print(\"The formula for boss health scaling in Expert Mode is:\")\n    print(\"Max Health = Base Health * (1 + Health Increase * (Max Players - 1))\")\n    print(\"\\nApplying the values for the Eye of Cthulhu:\")\n    print(f\"Max Health = {base_health} * (1 + {health_increase_per_player} * ({max_players_for_scaling} - 1))\")\n    print(f\"Max Health = {base_health} * ({1 + health_increase_per_player * extra_players})\")\n    print(f\"Max Health = {base_health} * {total_multiplier}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is: {int(max_health)}\")\n\ncalculate_terraria_boss_health()\n<<<327236>>>\n```"
