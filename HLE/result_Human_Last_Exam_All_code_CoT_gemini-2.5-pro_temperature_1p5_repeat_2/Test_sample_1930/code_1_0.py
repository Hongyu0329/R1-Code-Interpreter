    This problem asks for the dimension of a vector space of functions. The analysis involves
    constructing linearly independent functions that satisfy the given properties.

    1.  **Constant functions**: f(x) = c. These form a 1-dimensional space.
    2.  **Identity function**: f(x) = x. This function is digitary.
    3.  **Digit-dependent functions**: For each integer k >= 0, we can construct a set of functions that depend only on the k-th and (k+1)-th digits, f(x) = g_k(A_k, A_{k+1}). The constraints on g_k to make f a well-defined function leave a vector space of dimension 11 for g_k. One of these dimensions corresponds to constant functions. Thus, for each k, we get 10 new linearly independent non-constant functions.

    Since we have an infinite number of such sets of functions (one for each k), we have:
    - 1 dimension for the constant functions.
    - 1 dimension for the identity function f(x) = x (which is shown to be linearly independent of the others).
    - For k=0, 1, 2, ... we get 10 new functions each.

    The total number of linearly independent functions is 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + ... which is countably infinite.
    Therefore, the dimension of the vector space is countably infinite.

    In the problem, 'N' denotes countably infinite.
