    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:** First, I'll parse the names of the reactants to determine their chemical structures.\n    *   **Pivalaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde with a tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl. Its structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n    *   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane:** This is the Wittig reagent (a phosphorus ylide). I'll break down the name to build its structure: a triphenylphosphine group (PPh₃) is double-bonded to an ethylidene group (=CH-CH₃) which is substituted at the second carbon with a 2-chlorophenyl group. This gives the structure Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\n2.  **Apply Wittig Reaction Logic:** The Wittig reaction forms an alkene by combining the carbonyl carbon from the aldehyde with the ylide carbon. The aldehyde's `=O` and the ylide's `=PPh₃` are removed and replaced with a new `C=C` double bond.\n\n3.  **Construct Product:** I will combine the corresponding parts of the reactants:\n    *   From pivalaldehyde, we take the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part.\n    *   From the ylide, we take the `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)` part.\n    *   Joining them gives the alkene: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`.\n\n4.  **Determine IUPAC Name:** I will determine the systematic IUPAC name for the resulting structure.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that codifies this logic. The script will define the reactant structures as components, combine them according to the Wittig reaction rule, and print the complete reaction equation, including the structure and name of the final product.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef get_wittig_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the product of a Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and a specific phosphonium ylide.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the reactants by their functional components.\n    # Pivalaldehyde: (CH3)3C-CHO\n    aldehyde_alkyl_part = \"(CH3)3C-CH\" # The part that remains from the aldehyde\n    aldehyde_carbonyl = \"O\"           # The oxygen that is replaced\n\n    # Ylide: Ph3P=CH-CH2-(2-Cl-phenyl)\n    ylide_alkylidene_part = \"CH-CH2-(2-Cl-phenyl)\" # The carbon part that replaces the oxygen\n    ylide_phosphorus_part = \"P(Ph)3\"             # The phosphorus part that is eliminated\n\n    # Step 2: Assemble the products based on the Wittig reaction mechanism.\n    # The reaction forms an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n    # Product: (CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(2-Cl-phenyl)\n    product_alkene_structure = f\"{aldehyde_alkyl_part}={ylide_alkylidene_part}\"\n\n    # Byproduct: Ph3P=O\n    byproduct_structure = \"O=P(Ph)3\"\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the IUPAC name for the product.\n    # Structure: (CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(C6H4Cl)\n    # The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a 5-carbon chain (pentene).\n    # C1 is part of the CH2 group attached to the ring.
