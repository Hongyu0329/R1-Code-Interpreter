    print("\n--- PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE SYSTEMIC AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT ---\n")
    print("1. Medical Stabilization: The patient's uncontrolled diabetes is the highest priority. Immediate consultation with an internist or endocrinologist is required to manage hyperglycemia and begin treatment to lower the HbA1c level.")
    print("2. Infection Prophylaxis: Administer a Tetanus booster and broad-spectrum antibiotics due to the traumatic nature of the injury and the patient's compromised immune response from diabetes.")
    print("3. Pain Management: Administer appropriate analgesics for pain control.")

    print("\n--- PHASE 2: ACUTE DENTAL WOUND MANAGEMENT ---\n")
    print(f"1. Non-Viable Replantation: With a {time_to_hospital}-hour delay, the periodontal ligament cells on the avulsed teeth are necrotic. Replantation is not an option.")
    print("2. Wound Debridement: Gently irrigate the sockets and surrounding tissues with sterile saline to remove debris.")
    print("3. Closure: Suture the gingival tissues over the sockets to protect the blood clot, control bleeding, and promote primary healing.")
    print("4. Follow-up: Provide instructions for a soft diet and meticulous oral hygiene to prevent infection during the healing phase.")

    print("\n--- PHASE 3: DEFINITIVE PROSTHETIC REPLACEMENT (Delayed) ---\n")
    print("This phase should only begin after the extraction sites have fully healed (3-6 months) and the patient's diabetes is well-controlled (target HbA1c < 7.0%).\n")
    print("The recommended prosthetic solution is a Removable Partial Denture (RPD).\n")
    print("   - Type: Removable Partial Denture (RPD).")
    print("   - Rationale: An RPD is the most conservative, cost-effective, and practical option in this case. It does not require invasive surgery (like implants, which are risky with uncontrolled diabetes) or aggressive preparation of adjacent healthy teeth (like a bridge). It also allows for easier cleaning and can better accommodate the challenging bite relationship from the skeletal Class III profile (SNB 88°).")
    print("   - Material: An Acrylic base is a functional and economical choice. A Chrome-Cobalt framework would offer superior durability and hygiene if resources permit.")
    print("   - Abutment Teeth: The primary abutment teeth would be the Left Central Incisor and the Left Second Premolar.")
    print("   - Reason for Abutments: These teeth are directly adjacent to the edentulous span. They will be used for support and retention (via clasps) to stabilize the denture during function.")

    print("\n--- CELLS OF INTEREST ---\n")
    print("1. For Wound Healing: Fibroblasts (collagen production for tissue repair), Osteoblasts (new bone formation in the sockets), Osteoclasts (remodeling of the alveolar bone), Neutrophils, and Macrophages (initial immune response and clearing of debris).")
