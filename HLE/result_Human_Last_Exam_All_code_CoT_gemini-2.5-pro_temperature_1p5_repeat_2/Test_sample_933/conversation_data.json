    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1. I will research the common industrial and laboratory methods for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄).\n2. I will identify the reaction conditions for these methods, specifically focusing on the temperature required for an efficient yield. The term \"efficiently\" typically refers to the standard, high-yield method used in practice.\n3. I will determine the lowest temperature among these standard, efficient methods.\n4. I will compare this temperature to the given answer choices (A-F).\n5. I will write a Python script that explains the synthesis process, prints the relevant chemical equation, identifies the correct temperature, and outputs the final answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) to determine the\n    coldest efficient production temperature from the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The primary and most efficient method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\n    # is the direct reaction of xenon gas (Xe) and fluorine gas (F2).\n    #\n    # The reaction is: Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n    #\n    # This reaction is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine\n    # in a specific molar ratio (usually around 1:5) in a sealed nickel vessel.\n    # While the reaction can proceed at lower temperatures, it requires a temperature\n    # of 400°C for the reaction rate and yield to be considered efficient for\n    # practical synthesis.\n    #\n    # Let's review the options based on established chemical knowledge:\n    # A. 600 C: This temperature, especially with excess fluorine, favors the production of XeF6.\n    # B. 400 C: This is the well-established, standard temperature for efficient XeF4 synthesis.\n    # C. 200 C: At this temperature, the reaction rate is too slow to be considered efficient.\n    # D. 78 C: Not a standard temperature for this synthesis.\n    # E. 0 C: Not a standard temperature for this synthesis.\n    # F. -78 C: Reaction does not proceed efficiently at this temperature via direct synthesis.\n    #         (While other low-temperature pathways exist, they use highly unstable reagents like O2F2\n    #         and are not considered standard or \"efficient\" in a general context).\n    #\n    # Therefore, the coldest temperature listed at which XeF4 can be produced efficiently\n    # through its standard synthesis route is 400 C.\n\n    reaction_temperature = 400  # in Celsius\n    equation_reactants = \"Xe + 2F₂\"\n    equation_product = \"XeF₄\"\n\n    print(\"The primary synthesis reaction for Xenon tetrafluoride is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_reactants} → {equation_product}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis reaction is carried out efficiently at a specific temperature.\")\n    print(f\"The coldest temperature from the choices that allows for efficient production is: {reaction_temperature} C\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to answer choice B.\")\n\nfind_synthesis_temperature()\n<<<B>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Using any method of synthesis, which of the following is the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can still be produced efficiently?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. 600 C\nB. 400 C\nC. 200 C\nD. 78 C\nE. 0 C\nF. -78 C\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
