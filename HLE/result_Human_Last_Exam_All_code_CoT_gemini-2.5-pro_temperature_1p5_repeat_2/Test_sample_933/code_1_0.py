    # The primary and most efficient method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)
    # is the direct reaction of xenon gas (Xe) and fluorine gas (F2).
    #
    # The reaction is: Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)
    #
    # This reaction is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine
    # in a specific molar ratio (usually around 1:5) in a sealed nickel vessel.
    # While the reaction can proceed at lower temperatures, it requires a temperature
    # of 400°C for the reaction rate and yield to be considered efficient for
    # practical synthesis.
    #
    # Let's review the options based on established chemical knowledge:
    # A. 600 C: This temperature, especially with excess fluorine, favors the production of XeF6.
    # B. 400 C: This is the well-established, standard temperature for efficient XeF4 synthesis.
    # C. 200 C: At this temperature, the reaction rate is too slow to be considered efficient.
    # D. 78 C: Not a standard temperature for this synthesis.
    # E. 0 C: Not a standard temperature for this synthesis.
    # F. -78 C: Reaction does not proceed efficiently at this temperature via direct synthesis.
    #         (While other low-temperature pathways exist, they use highly unstable reagents like O2F2
    #         and are not considered standard or "efficient" in a general context).
    #
    # Therefore, the coldest temperature listed at which XeF4 can be produced efficiently
    # through its standard synthesis route is 400 C.
