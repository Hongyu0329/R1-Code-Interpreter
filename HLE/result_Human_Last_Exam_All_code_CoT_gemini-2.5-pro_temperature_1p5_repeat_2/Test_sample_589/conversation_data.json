    "My plan is to first identify the movie based on the very specific scene described. The key elements are: a major Hollywood film, a teenager, a pink bicycle, and the action of pedaling directly toward an oncoming car. This is a very memorable scene from a specific film. I will recall or search for this scene in my knowledge base. The scene described occurs in the 1995 coming-of-age film \"Now and Then\". In the film, the character Samantha, distraught over her parents' separation, takes her friend Chrissy's new pink Schwinn bike and recklessly rides it down the middle of the street, swerving away from an oncoming car at the last second.\n\nTo fulfill the request of providing a code-based answer, I will create a simple Python script that stores the movie title in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the movie based on a specific scene description.\n    The scene involves a teenager on a pink bike riding towards an oncoming car.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The film is \"Now and Then\" (1995), a feature film produced by New Line Cinema.\n    # The character is Samantha Albertson (played by Gaby Hoffmann).\n    # The bike belongs to her friend, Chrissy DeWitt.\n    # The act is a moment of emotional distress and recklessness.\n    movie_title = \"Now and Then\"\n    \n    print(\"The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager rides a pink bike directly toward an oncoming car is:\")\n    print(movie_title)\n\nfind_movie_scene()\n```\n<<<Now and Then>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
