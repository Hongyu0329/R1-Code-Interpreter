    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Function `F₃(x)`**: First, we'll write out the full expression for `F₃(x)` by substituting the definitions of `F₀`, `F₁`, and `F₂`.\n    *   `F₀(x) = x`\n    *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n    *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n2.  **Simplify the Integral**: The core of the problem is to evaluate the definite integral `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`. This is a standard integral form. The integral of `u'(x)/u(x)` with respect to `x` is `ln|u(x)|`.\n    *   In our case, `u(x) = F₃(x)`.\n    *   So, `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = ln|F₃(x)|`.\n    *   To evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we compute `[ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1, which is `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`. Since `F₃(x)` is always positive, we can remove the absolute value signs: `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Values**: We will calculate the numerical values for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`.\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(2)`\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: We'll substitute these values back into our integral result to find `V`, and then calculate the final answer, which is the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the values of F₃(1) and F₃(0)\n# F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\nf3_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\nf3_0 = math.log(2)\n\nprint(f\"The equation for F₃(x) is ln(1 + e^sin(x))\")\nprint(f\"The value of F₃(1) is: {f3_1}\")\nprint(f\"The value of F₃(0) is: {f3_0}\")\n\n# Step 2: Evaluate the integral V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = math.log(f3_1) - math.log(f3_0)\n\n# The numbers in the final equation\nln_f3_1 = math.log(f3_1)\nln_f3_0 = math.log(f3_0)\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe definite integral from 0 to 1 of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(f\"ln({f3_1}) - ln({f3_0})\")\nprint(f\"= {ln_f3_1} - ({ln_f3_0})\")\nprint(f\"= {V}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate 10000 * V and find the closest integer\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe value V is {V}\")\nprint(f\"We need to find the closest integer to 10000 * V, which is {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The final answer is: {closest_integer}\")\n```\n<<<5487>>>"
