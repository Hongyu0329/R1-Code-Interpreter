    This function explains the proof for finding the maximum number of

    print("--- The Proof ---")
    print("Let X be a compact connected metric space.")
    print("Let D be the set of dispersion points of X.")
    print("A point p in X is a dispersion point if X \\ {p} is totally disconnected.")
    print("We want to find the maximum possible cardinality of D.\n")

    print("Part 1: Proving the number of dispersion points is at most 1.")
    print("We will use proof by contradiction. Assume there are at least two dispersion points.")
    print("Let p and q be two distinct dispersion points in D.\n")

    print("Step A: Finding an irreducible continuum.")
    print("Since X is a compact connected space (a continuum), there must exist a subcontinuum K within X that contains both p and q, but no proper subcontinuum of K contains both p and q. This is called a continuum 'irreducible' between p and q.\n")

    print("Step B: p and q as dispersion points of K.")
    print("Because p is a dispersion point of X, X \\ {p} is totally disconnected.")
    print("The set K \\ {p} is a subset of X \\ {p}, so K \\ {p} must also be totally disconnected.")
    print("This means p is a dispersion point of K. The same logic applies to q, so q is also a dispersion point of K.\n")

    print("Step C: Using a property of irreducible continua.")
    print("A key theorem in continuum theory states that if K is irreducible between p and q, then the 'composant' of p in K, denoted Comp(p), is dense in K.")
    print("Comp(p) is the set of all points x in K such that there is a proper subcontinuum of K containing both p and x. Comp(p) is a connected set.\n")

    print("Step D: Reaching the contradiction.")
    print(f"Since q is a dispersion point of K, the space K \\ {{q}} is totally disconnected.")
    print(f"The composant Comp(p) is a connected set. By the definition of irreducibility, q is not in Comp(p), so Comp(p) is a subset of K \\ {{q}}.")
    print("A connected subset of a totally disconnected space must contain at most one point.")
    print(f"Since p is in Comp(p), we must conclude that Comp(p) = {{p}}.")
    print(f"However, we also know that Comp(p) must be dense in K. If Comp(p) = {{p}}, this means the single point p is dense in K, which implies K = {{p}}.")
    print("This contradicts the fact that K contains both p and q, where p != q.\n")

    print("Conclusion of Part 1:")
    print("The assumption that there are two or more dispersion points leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the number of dispersion points can be at most 1.\n")

    print("Part 2: Showing that 1 is an achievable number.")
    print("There exist well-known examples of compact connected metric spaces with exactly one dispersion point.")
    print("One such example is the Brouwer-Janiszewski-Knaster (BJK) continuum.")
    print("This space has a special point 'p' such that removing it shatters the space into a totally disconnected set, but removing any other point leaves the space connected.")
    print("This confirms that it is possible for a space to have exactly one dispersion point.\n")

    print("--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("Since the number of dispersion points is at most 1, and there exists a space with exactly 1, the maximum cardinality is 1.")
