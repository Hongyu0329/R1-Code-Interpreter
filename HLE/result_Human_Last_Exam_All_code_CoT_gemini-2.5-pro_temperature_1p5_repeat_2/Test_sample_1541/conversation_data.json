  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school.

To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board.

    "Of course, I can help you with this task.\n\nFirst, I will provide the Python code to solve the problem as requested. Then, I will explain the memory calculation for the most memory-efficient C program.\n\n### Plan for the Python Code\n\n1.  **Read the Input**: I will read the entire line of input, which is a string representing the sum (e.g., \"3+2+1\").\n2.  **Extract the Numbers**: The sum is composed of numbers separated by '+' signs. I will split the input string by the '+' character to get a list of the numbers as strings (e.g., `['3', '2', '1']`).\n3.  **Sort the Numbers**: I will sort this list of numbers. Since the numbers are single digits, alphabetical sorting works correctly and places them in non-decreasing order (e.g., `['1', '2', '3']`).\n4.  **Reconstruct the Sum**: Finally, I will join the sorted list of numbers back into a single string, using '+' as the separator (e.g., \"1+2+3\").\n5.  **Print the Result**: The new, sorted sum string will be printed to the console.\n\nHere is the Python code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\n# Read the sum from the input as a string\ns = input()\n\n# Split the string by the '+' character to get a list of numbers (as strings)\nnumbers = s.split('+')\n\n# Sort the list of numbers. For single-digit numbers, default string sort is sufficient.\nnumbers.sort()\n\n# Join the sorted numbers back into a string with '+' as the separator\nsorted_sum = \"+\".join(numbers)\n\n# Print the final rearranged sum\nprint(sorted_sum)\n```\n\n### Memory Calculation for the C program\n\nNow, let's analyze the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem and calculate `m`, the total memory in bytes used for its variables.\n\nTo be most memory-efficient, the C program should not store the entire input string if it can be avoided. A better approach is to read the input character by character and simply count the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n\nThe variables needed for this approach would be:\n1.  **Counters for numbers**: We need four integer variables to store the counts of '1', '2', '3', and '4'. Let's call them `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, and `count4`.\n    *   `4 * sizeof(int)`\n2.  **Character variable**: A variable to hold the current character being read from the input, for example, using `getchar()`. `getchar()` returns an `int`.\n    *   `1 * sizeof(int)`\n3.  **Loop counter**: An integer variable `i` for the loops used during the printing phase.\n    *   `1 * sizeof(int)`\n4.  **Printing flag**: An integer variable, say `is_first`, to correctly handle placing the '+' signs between numbers. This avoids printing a '+' before the first number or after the last one.\n    *   `1 * sizeof(int)`\n\nTotal variables: `4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7` integer variables.\nAssuming a standard system where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes, the total memory `m` used for variables is:\n`m = 7 * 4 = 28` bytes.\n\n<<<28>>>"
