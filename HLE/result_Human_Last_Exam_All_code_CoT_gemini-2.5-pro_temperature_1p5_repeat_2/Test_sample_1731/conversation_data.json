    "Of course. Here is a Python script to solve for the equilibrium entropy and mean energy of a photon gas.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Framework**: We will model the light quanta (photons) as a Bose gas where the number of particles is not conserved (chemical potential $\\mu=0$). According to the principles of statistical mechanics, which are underpinned by large deviation theorems like Boltzmann-Sanov, the system at equilibrium will occupy the macrostate that has the maximum entropy ($S$) for a given total mean energy ($\\langle E \\rangle$).\n2.  **Derivation**:\n    *   We first find the equilibrium distribution of photons over energy states, which is the Planck distribution. This is achieved by maximizing the Boltzmann entropy $S = k_B \\ln W$ (where $W$ is the number of microstates for bosons) subject to a constant total energy.\n    *   Using this distribution and the density of states for photons in a 3D volume, we integrate over all energy levels to find the total mean energy $\\langle E \\rangle$. This yields the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n    *   Finally, we use the thermodynamic relation for a photon gas, $\\langle E \\rangle - TS = \\Omega = -PV$, and the fact that for an ultra-relativistic gas $P = \\langle E \\rangle / (3V)$, to find a simple relation between entropy $S$ and mean energy $\\langle E \\rangle$.\n3.  **Implementation**: The Python code will present the final derived equations for $\\langle E \\rangle$ and $S$. It will use the `scipy` and `numpy` libraries to calculate the physical constants that appear in these equations and display them, breaking down the numerical components of the formulas as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import constants\n\ndef solve_photon_gas_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the equilibrium equations for mean energy and\n    entropy of a photon gas based on Bose-Einstein statistics and large\n    deviation principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script derives the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas (light quanta).\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium state is the most probable one, found by maximizing entropy for a given mean energy.\\n\")\n\n    # Define fundamental physical constants\n    k_B = constants.k      # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    h = constants.h        # Planck constant in J*s\n    c = constants.c        # Speed of light in m/s\n\n    # --- Part 1: Equilibrium Mean Energy <E> ---\n    print(\"--- 1.
