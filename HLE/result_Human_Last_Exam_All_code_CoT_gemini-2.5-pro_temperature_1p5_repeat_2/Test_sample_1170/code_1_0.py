def solve_tt_ideals():
    """
    This function encapsulates the solution to the tensor-triangulated geometry problem.

    The problem asks to identify which of 20 specified objects in a tensor-triangulated category K generate a prime tt-ideal, and how many prime tt-ideals are not generated by any of these objects.

    A prime tt-ideal is generated by an object X if and only if its support, supp(X), is a non-empty, irreducible, closed subset of the Balmer spectrum Spc(K), which is isomorphic to the projective line P^1_k. The irreducible closed subsets are the entire space P^1_k (generating the zero ideal) and single points {z} for z in P^1_k (generating maximal ideals).

    Based on a detailed analysis of the support of each object:
    - Objects are considered generators if their support can be a single point or the whole space, allowing for parameter choices (like the non-zero map τ).
    - Objects with empty support or support on multiple, distinct points are excluded.

    The list of objects that can generate a prime ideal is determined as:
    1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20.

    The prime ideals that can be generated by this list are:
    - The zero ideal (P_gen), generated by object 4.
    - The ideal at infinity (P_inf), generated by objects like 1 and 3.
    - Ideals P_z for any z in k* (the non-zero elements of the field k), generated by varying τ in objects like 7.
    - The ideal P_1, generated by objects 13 and 14.

    The only prime ideal that cannot be generated is P_0, corresponding to the point 0 on the affine line. The map τ for cone(τ) must be non-zero, and none of the other objects have support at {0}.
