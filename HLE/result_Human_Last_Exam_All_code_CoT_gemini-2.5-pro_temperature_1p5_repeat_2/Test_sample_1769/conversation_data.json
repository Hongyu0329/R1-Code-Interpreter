    "To figure out what the word for \"sister\" would be in Modern English without Norse influence, we need to go back to the original Old English word and trace its natural evolution through the sound changes that shaped the English language.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Identify the native word:** The current word \"sister\" comes from Old Norse \"systir.\" The original, native Old English word was \"sweostor.\"\n2.  **Trace its evolution:** We'll track how \"sweostor\" would have changed over time.\n    *   **Old English to Middle English:** The initial complex sound \"sweo-\" often simplified. \"Sweostor\" became \"suster\" in many dialects. This is a plausible development, as it parallels the evolution in other Germanic languages like Dutch (\"zuster\").\n    *   **Middle English to Modern English:** The key change is the \"foot-strut split.\" The vowel sound 'u' (as in \"put\") in words like \"suster\" typically changed to the 'u' sound we hear in \"cup\" or \"strut\" today.\n3.  **Construct the final word:** Applying this vowel change to the Middle English \"suster\" gives us our final hypothesized word.\n\nThe following Python code will print this step-by-step linguistic derivation.\n\n```python\ndef find_alternate_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the hypothesized Modern English word for 'sister'\n    if the Norse had never influenced the language.\n    \"\"\"\n    old_english = \"sweostor\"\n    middle_english = \"suster\"\n    modern_english = \"suster\"\n\n    print(\"This script traces the linguistic evolution of the Old English word for 'sister' to its potential modern form without Norse influence.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"1. The current word 'sister' comes from Old Norse 'systir', which replaced the native Old English word: '{old_english}'.\")\n    print(f\"2. Without that influence, '{old_english}' would have evolved naturally. It was often simplified in Middle English to '{middle_english}'.\")\n    print(f\"3. The vowel 'u' in '{middle_english}' would likely have undergone the 'foot-strut split' sound change (like in 'sunne' -> 'sun'), leading to the modern form.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"The final derivation path (the 'equation') is:\")\n    # The prompt requests that we \"output each number in the final equation\",\n    # which is interpreted here as showing each word in the evolution chain.\n    print(f\"'{old_english}' -> '{middle_english}' -> '{modern_english}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    final_word = modern_english\n    print(f\"Therefore, the Modern English word would likely be '{final_word}' (pronounced to rhyme with 'duster').\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_alternate_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
