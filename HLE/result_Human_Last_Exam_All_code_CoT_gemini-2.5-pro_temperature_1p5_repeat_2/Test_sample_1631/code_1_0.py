    print("When stamping parts with deep sections, small radii, or sharp corners, the sheet metal must flow into the die cavity. If this flow is uneven or restricted, it can lead to defects like tearing, splitting, or excessive thinning.")

    print("\nStep 3: Connect 'bypass notches' to the challenge.")
    print("Bypass notches are intentionally designed cutouts in the initial blank, typically in the flange or binder area. They act as localized reservoirs of material or as stress concentrators that encourage material to flow preferentially into an adjacent, complex feature. They help 'bypass' a geometrically locked area, ensuring the die cavity fills correctly.")
