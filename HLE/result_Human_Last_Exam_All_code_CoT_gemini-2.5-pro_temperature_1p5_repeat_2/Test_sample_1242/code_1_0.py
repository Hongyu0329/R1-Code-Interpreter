    The question asks for features that predict the complexity of individual 'words', not an entire 'text'.

    1.  Let's identify features that describe a text, not a single word:
        - 'number of unique words': Measures lexical diversity in a text.
        - 'number of word categories': Measures syntactic variety in a text.

    2.  Now, let's evaluate the choices:
        - Choice A contains 'number of unique words'. Incorrect.
        - Choice B contains 'number of word categories'. Incorrect.
        - Choice C contains 'number of unique words'. Incorrect.
        - Choice E contains 'number of word categories'. Incorrect.

    3.  Choice D contains 'word length', 'word familiarity rating', 'syllable count', and 'concreteness rating'. All of these are well-established, standard features used to measure the complexity of a single word.
