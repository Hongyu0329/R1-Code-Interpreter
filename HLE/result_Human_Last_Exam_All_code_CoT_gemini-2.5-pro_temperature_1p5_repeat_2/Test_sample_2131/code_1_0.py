# Step 1: Define the value of y'(0), denoted as p_at_0.
# From solving the differential equation, we found that p_at_0 must satisfy
# p_at_0^(5/2) = 9/4.
# So, p_at_0 can be calculated as:
p_at_0 = (9/4)**(2/5)

# Step 2: Use the original DE at x=0 to find y(0).
# The relation is y(0) = (y'(0))^4 / 3.

# Step 3: Calculate y(0) and print the equation with its numerical values.
y_at_0 = (p_at_0**4) / 3

# The final equation is y(0) = (y'(0))^4 / 3.
# The numbers involved are y'(0), the exponent 4, and the divisor 3.
