    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThis is a historical knowledge question. To answer it, I will first find the information regarding Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion and its citations. Then, I will write a simple Python script to store this information in a variable and print it out as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lecturer():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the name of the scientist whose work and lectures \n  were a major influence on Einstein's 1905 Brownian motion paper.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The question asks whose lectures were cited.
