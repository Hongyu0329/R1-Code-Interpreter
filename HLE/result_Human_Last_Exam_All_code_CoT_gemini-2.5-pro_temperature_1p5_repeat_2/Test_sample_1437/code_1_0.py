    The Lindhard polarization function Pi_0(q, w=0) can be written as:
    Pi_0(q, 0) = -g(e_F) * F(q/2k_F)
    where g(e_F) is the density of states at the Fermi level and F(x) is the
    dimensionless static Lindhard function. The question asks for the numerical
    value of this function at q=0, which corresponds to the limit of F(x) as x->0.

    Analytically, the limit of F(x) as x -> 0 is 1.
    We can show this by considering the Taylor expansion of the logarithmic term.
    ln|(1+x)/(1-x)| approx 2x for small x.
    So, (1-x^2)/(4x) * ln|(1+x)/(1-x)| approx (1)/(4x) * (2x) = 1/2.
    The total function is then F(x->0) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

    This script will demonstrate the calculation.
