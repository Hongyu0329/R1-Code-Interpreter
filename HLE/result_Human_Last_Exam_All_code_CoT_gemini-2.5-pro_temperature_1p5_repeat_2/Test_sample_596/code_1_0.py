# The problem asks for the number of higher dimensional rooted forests on the standard
# triangulation of the Möbius band that do not simplicially collapse onto their root.
#
# This quantity is a topological invariant. Advanced results in algebraic combinatorics
# relate this number to the homology of the space. Specifically, for a 2-dimensional
# manifold M with boundary ∂M, the number is given by the square of the order of
# the torsion subgroup of the first relative homology group, i.e., |Tors(H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ))|².
#
# We compute this as follows:
# 1. The Möbius band M is homotopy equivalent to a circle S¹, so its first homology
#    group H₁(M; ℤ) is the group of integers, ℤ.
# 2. The boundary of the Möbius band, ∂M, is also a circle S¹, so H₁(∂M; ℤ) = ℤ.
# 3. The inclusion of the boundary ∂M into M wraps the boundary circle twice around
#    the core circle of M. The induced map on the first homology groups,
#    H₁(∂M; ℤ) -> H₁(M; ℤ), is therefore multiplication by 2.
# 4. From the long exact sequence of homology for the pair (M, ∂M), we have:
#    ... -> H₁(∂M; ℤ) -> H₁(M; ℤ) -> H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ) -> ...
#    which becomes:
#    ... -> ℤ --(x2)--> ℤ -> H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ) -> ...
# 5. By exactness of the sequence, H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ) is the cokernel of the
#    multiplication-by-2 map, which is ℤ / 2ℤ, also known as the cyclic
#    group of order 2, ℤ₂.
# 6. The group H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ) = ℤ₂ is entirely torsion, and its order is 2.
# 7. The final number of non-collapsing rooted forests is the square of this order.

order_of_torsion_group = 2
number_of_forests = order_of_torsion_group ** 2

# The problem requires printing the final equation.
# The equation shows the order of the group being squared to get the final answer.
print(f"{order_of_torsion_group} ** 2 = {number_of_forests}")
