    "The problem asks for the number of higher dimensional rooted forests on the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to simplicially collapse onto their root. This quantity is a known topological invariant. I will calculate it using results from algebraic topology that connect this combinatorial count to the homology of the space.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  The number of non-collapsing rooted forests is given by a formula involving the homology groups of the space. For a 2-dimensional manifold `M` with boundary `∂M`, like the Möbius band, this number is the square of the order of the torsion subgroup of its first relative homology group, i.e., `|Tors(H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ))|²`.\n2.  I will calculate the homology group `H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ)` using the long exact sequence of the pair `(M, ∂M)`.\n3.  The calculation involves identifying the groups `H₁(M; ℤ)` and `H₁(∂M; ℤ)` and the homomorphism between them induced by the inclusion of the boundary into the manifold.\n4.  For the Möbius band, the boundary circle wraps twice around the core circle, which translates to a specific homomorphism (multiplication by 2) in the long exact sequence.\n5.  This will allow me to determine `H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ)` and its order.\n6.  Finally, I will square this order to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code outlines these steps in the comments and performs the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the number of higher dimensional rooted forests on the standard\n# triangulation of the Möbius band that do not simplicially collapse onto their root.\n#\n# This quantity is a topological invariant. Advanced results in algebraic combinatorics\n# relate this number to the homology of the space. Specifically, for a 2-dimensional\n# manifold M with boundary ∂M, the number is given by the square of the order of\n# the torsion subgroup of the first relative homology group, i.e., |Tors(H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ))|².\n#\n# We compute this as follows:\n# 1. The Möbius band M is homotopy equivalent to a circle S¹, so its first homology\n#    group H₁(M; ℤ) is the group of integers, ℤ.\n# 2. The boundary of the Möbius band, ∂M, is also a circle S¹, so H₁(∂M; ℤ) = ℤ.\n# 3. The inclusion of the boundary ∂M into M wraps the boundary circle twice around\n#    the core circle of M. The induced map on the first homology groups,\n#    H₁(∂M; ℤ) -> H₁(M; ℤ), is therefore multiplication by 2.\n# 4. From the long exact sequence of homology for the pair (M, ∂M), we have:\n#    ... -> H₁(∂M; ℤ) -> H₁(M; ℤ) -> H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ) -> ...\n#    which becomes:\n#    ... -> ℤ --(x2)--> ℤ -> H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ) -> ...\n# 5. By exactness of the sequence, H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ) is the cokernel of the\n#    multiplication-by-2 map, which is ℤ / 2ℤ, also known as the cyclic\n#    group of order 2, ℤ₂.\n# 6. The group H₁(M, ∂M; ℤ) = ℤ₂ is entirely torsion, and its order is 2.\n# 7. The final number of non-collapsing rooted forests is the square of this order.\n\norder_of_torsion_group = 2\nnumber_of_forests = order_of_torsion_group ** 2\n\n# The problem requires printing the final equation.\n# The equation shows the order of the group being squared to get the final answer.\nprint(f\"{order_of_torsion_group} ** 2 = {number_of_forests}\")\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"
