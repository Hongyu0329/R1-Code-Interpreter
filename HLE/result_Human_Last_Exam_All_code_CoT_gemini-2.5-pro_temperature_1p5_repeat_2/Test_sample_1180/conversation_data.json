    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the Polynomial**: The curve is defined by $z^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\n2.  **Determine the Valuation**: The problem specifies a valuation $v$ normalized by $v(2) = 1$. This is the standard 2-adic valuation.\n3.  **Construct the Newton Polygon**: The stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$. These valuations can be found from the slopes of the Newton polygon of $f(x)$. The Newton polygon is the lower convex hull of the points $(i, v(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$ in $f(x)$.\n    *   The non-zero coefficients of $f(x)$ are $a_5=2$, $a_3=2$, $a_0=1$.\n    *   Their 2-adic valuations are $v(a_5)=v(2)=1$, $v(a_3)=v(2)=1$, $v(a_0)=v(1)=0$.\n    *   The points for the Newton polygon are $(5, 1)$, $(3, 1)$, and $(0, 0)$.\n4.  **Calculate the Slopes**: We will compute the slopes of the segments of the lower convex hull of these points.\n    *   Starting from the rightmost point $(5, 1)$, we find the next vertex of the hull by choosing the point that makes the steepest line (largest slope, since we move left).\n    *   The slope from $(5,1)$ to $(3,1)$ is $(1-1)/(5-3) = 0$.\n    *   The slope from $(5,1)$ to $(0,0)$ is $(1-0)/(5-0) = 1/5$.\n    *   The point $(3,1)$ is above the line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(5,1)$, so the hull is not just one segment. It consists of two segments. The first (from right to left) connects $(5,1)$ to $(3,1)$ with slope 0. The second connects $(3,1)$ to $(0,0)$ with slope $(1-0)/(3-0) = 1/3$.\n5.  **Interpret the \"Thickness\"**: The \"thickness\" of a double point in the stable reduction is a measure of its arithmetic singularity. In this context, the fractional slope $1/3$ of the Newton polygon indicates that to resolve the singularity and understand the geometry, we need to work in a field extension of degree 3 (e.g., by adjoining $\\sqrt[3]{2}$). The ramification index of this extension is 3. This value is a common interpretation of the thickness of a node arising from such a configuration of roots. Therefore, the thickness corresponds to the denominator of the non-trivial rational slope of the Newton polygon.\n6.  **Write the Code**: The Python code will implement these steps. It will identify the points for the Newton polygon, calculate the relevant slope, and extract its denominator, which is the thickness. To meet the output requirement, the code will print the numbers used in the final slope calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_valuation(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the 2-adic valuation of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return 0\n    return (n & -n).bit_length() - 1\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve\n    z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The curve is z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\n    # The coefficients of the polynomial f(x) are a_5=2, a_3=2, a_0=1.\n    coeffs = {5: 2, 3: 2, 0: 1}\n\n    # The points for the Newton polygon are (i, v(a_i)).\n    # v(2)=1, v(1)=0.\n    points = sorted([(i, get_valuation(coeffs[i])) for i in coeffs])\n\n    # The points are [(0, 0), (3, 1), (5, 1)].\n    # We compute the lower convex hull and its slopes.\n    # The vertices of the lower convex hull are (0,0), (3,1), and (5,1).\n    p1 = points[0]  # (0, 0)\n    p2 = points[1]  # (3, 1)\n    p3 = points[2]  # (5, 1)\n\n    # Slope between p2 and p1\n    dy = p2[1] - p1[1]\n    dx = p2[0] - p1[0]\n    \n    # The denominator of this slope is interpreted as the thickness.\n    # The fraction is dy/dx.
