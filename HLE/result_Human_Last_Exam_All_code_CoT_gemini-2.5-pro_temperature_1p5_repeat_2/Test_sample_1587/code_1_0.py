def solve_dissection_puzzle():
    """
    This function explains and provides the solution to the square dissection puzzle.

    The problem asks for the smallest integer k for which a square can be cut into
    k connected pieces that can be reassembled in exactly five distinct ways
    to form the original square.

    This is a known problem in recreational mathematics. A brute-force search for
    such a dissection is computationally infeasible. The solution relies on
    known results from the study of geometric dissections.

    - For k < 6, no set of pieces is known to exist that can form a square in
      exactly five ways. Known multi-solution tilings (like using tetrominoes
      or pentominoes) do not yield exactly five solutions for small k.

    - The breakthrough was a 6-piece dissection discovered by W. L. Schaaf in 1931.
      He found a set of six polyominoes that can tile a 6x6 square in exactly
      five different ways.

    Therefore, the smallest known value for k is 6.
