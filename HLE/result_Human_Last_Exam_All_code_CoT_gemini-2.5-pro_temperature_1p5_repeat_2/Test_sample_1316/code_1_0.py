# The problem describes a specific case of genetic non-disjunction observed by Calvin Bridges.
# Let's break down the logic to arrive at the correct answer.

# 1. Define the parents based on the classic Bridges experiment.
#    The experiment typically involved a white-eyed female and a red-eyed male.
#    The traits mentioned (red eyes, miniature wings) are X-linked.
#    Let W = red eyes (dominant), w = white eyes (recessive).
#    Let m = miniature wings (recessive), + = wild-type wings (dominant).
#    Paternal Male Genotype: X^(W,m) / Y  (Phenotype: red eyes, miniature wings)
#    Maternal Female Genotype: X^(w,+) / X^(w,+) (Phenotype: white eyes, normal wings)

# 2. Define the exceptional offspring.
#    Phenotype: male, red eyes, miniature wings
#    Chromosomal Makeup: X0
#    Inferred Genotype: X^(W,m) / 0

# 3. Determine the origin of the gametes that formed the offspring.
#    The offspring has one X chromosome, which carries the alleles for red eyes (W) and miniature wings (m).
#    The father (X^(W,m) / Y) is the only parent who carries the X^(W,m) chromosome.
#    Therefore, the father must have contributed a normal X^(W,m) sperm.
gamete_from_father = "X^(W,m)"

#    The offspring has a '0' where the second sex chromosome should be.
#    This '0' must have come from the mother's gamete (egg).
#    A gamete with no sex chromosome is called a "nullo-X" or "nullisomic" gamete.
gamete_from_mother = "0 (nullo-X)"

print(f"To produce an X^(W,m)/0 offspring:")
print(f"The sperm from the father must be: {gamete_from_father}")
print(f"The egg from the mother must be: {gamete_from_mother}")
print("-" * 20)

# 4. Identify the genetic event that produces a nullo-X egg.
#    A female (X/X) produces nullo-X (0) eggs when her two X chromosomes fail to separate during meiosis.
#    This failure to separate is called non-disjunction.
#    The non-disjunction event occurred in the female during egg formation (oogenesis).
event_location = "Female Meiosis"

# 5. Evaluate the answer choices based on this conclusion.
#    A. Non-disjunction of the X chromosome in female meiosis I -> This produces nullo-X eggs. CORRECT.
#    B. Non-disjunction of the X chromosome in female meiosis II -> This also produces nullo-X eggs. CORRECT.
#    C. Non-disjunction ... during male meiosis -> INCORRECT. The event was in the female.
#    D. Non-disjunction involving autosomes -> INCORRECT. The event involved sex chromosomes (X).
#    E. A de novo mutation -> INCORRECT. The event was a chromosomal number abnormality.

# 6. Choose the best answer between A and B.
#    Non-disjunction in Meiosis I is the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate.
#    This event leads to the creation of both XX gametes and nullo-X (0) gametes.
#    These are the two types of abnormal gametes needed to explain both of Bridges' exceptional finds:
#    - nullo-X egg + X^W sperm -> X^W0 (exceptional red-eyed male)
#    - X^wX^w egg + Y sperm -> X^wX^wY (exceptional white-eyed female)
#    Therefore, non-disjunction in Meiosis I is a complete and fundamental explanation for the observations.
final_conclusion = "The event is non-disjunction of the X chromosome during female meiosis. Meiosis I non-disjunction is the fundamental event where homologous chromosomes fail to separate, accounting for all of Bridges' findings."

print(f"The cause is non-disjunction of the X-chromosome in the female parent.")
print(f"This could happen in Meiosis I or Meiosis II.")
print(f"The failure of homologous chromosomes to separate in Meiosis I is the primary mechanism for this type of event.")
print(f"This corresponds to Choice A.")
