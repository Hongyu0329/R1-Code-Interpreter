    "To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we can follow a systematic approach based on the classification of finite Weyl groups.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Classification:** Finite Weyl groups are classified by their associated root systems. A Weyl group of a given rank can be either *irreducible* (corresponding to a connected Dynkin diagram) or *reducible*. A reducible Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, where the sum of the ranks of the components equals the total rank.\n2.  **List Irreducible Weyl Groups:** We need to know the types of irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4. The standard classification gives us:\n    *   Rank 1: $A_1$\n    *   Rank 2: $A_2$, $B_2$ (note: $W(B_2) \\cong W(C_2)$), $G_2$\n    *   Rank 3: $A_3$, $B_3$ (note: $W(B_3) \\cong W(C_3)$)\n    *   Rank 4: $A_4$, $B_4$ (note: $W(B_4) \\cong W(C_4)$), $D_4$, $F_4$\n3.  **Partitions of Rank 4:** We will consider all the ways the integer 4 can be written as a sum of positive integers (partitions of 4). Each partition corresponds to a way of combining irreducible Weyl groups to form a rank 4 group. The partitions are:\n    *   4\n    *   3 + 1\n    *   2 + 2\n    *   2 + 1 + 1\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n4.  **Count Combinations for Each Partition:** For each partition, we'll count how many distinct combinations of irreducible Weyl groups we can form. For rank 4, it turns out that each unique combination of irreducible types results in a non-isomorphic group.\n    *   **Partition 4:** We count the irreducible groups of rank 4.\n    *   **Partition 3+1:** We combine one rank 3 group with one rank 1 group.\n    *   **Partition 2+2:** We combine two rank 2 groups (they can be of the same type).\n    *   **Partition 2+1+1:** We combine one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   **Partition 1+1+1+1:** We combine four rank 1 groups.\n5.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the counts from each partition.\n\nThe following Python code implements this counting plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the number of irreducible Weyl group types for each rank.\n    # W(B_n) is isomorphic to W(C_n), so we only count one of them.\n    # W(D_n) is irreducible only for n >= 4.\n    # A_n (n>=1), B_n (n>=2), D_n (n>=4), E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2\n    \n    num_irreducible_types = {\n        1: 1,  # A1\n        2: 3,  # A2, B2, G2\n        3: 2,  # A3, B3\n        4: 4,  # A4, B4, D4, F4\n    }\n\n    total_groups = 0\n    results = []\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the number of groups for each partition of 4.\n\n    # Partition: 4\n    # These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    count_4 = num_irreducible_types[4]\n    total_groups += count_4\n    results.append(str(count_4))\n    print(f\"For partition [4]: {count_4} groups (A4, B4, D4, F4)\")\n\n    # Partition: 3 + 1\n    # Combinations of one rank 3 group and one rank 1 group.\n    count_3_1 = num_irreducible_types[3] * num_irreducible_types[1]\n    total_groups += count_3_1\n    results.append(str(count_3_1))\n    print(f\"For partition [3, 1]: {count_3_1} groups (A3xA1, B3xA1)\")\n\n    # Partition: 2 + 2\n    # Combinations with replacement of 2 groups from rank 2 types.\n    # Formula for combinations with replacement: n*(n+1)/2\n    n = num_irreducible_types[2]\n    count_2_2 = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    total_groups += count_2_2\n    results.append(str(count_2_2))\n    print(f\"For partition [2, 2]: {count_2_2} groups (e.g., A2xA2, A2xB2, B2xG2, etc.)\")\n    \n    # Partition: 2 + 1 + 1\n    # One rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.
