    # Premise Summary:
    # 1. CA biotype (watermelon-adapted) thrives on raffinose-rich diet. Implies watermelon is rich in raffinose.
    # 2. MA biotype (cotton-adapted) thrives on sucrose-only diet. Implies cotton is rich in sucrose and poor in raffinose.
    # 3. Galactosidase is the enzyme needed to metabolize raffinose.

    # Statement A: CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.
    # Reasoning: True. This is a direct consequence of their adaptation to a raffinose-rich host.
    statement_A_is_true = True

    # Statement B: CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.
    # Reasoning: True. The text explicitly states what each biotype "did well on".
    statement_B_is_true = True
    
    # Statement C: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.
    # Reasoning: True. CA moves to a low-raffinose environment (cotton). Reduced substrate (raffinose) leads to reduced enzyme (galactosidase) activity. This is a direct and logical biological principle.
    statement_C_is_true = True

    # Statement D: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.
    # Reasoning: False. While the outcome (decreased activity) is plausible, the cause is incorrect. The most direct cause is the lack of the specific substrate, raffinose (as in C), not the presence of a different sugar (glucose/sucrose). The text provides no evidence for this specific causal link.
    statement_D_is_true = False

    # Statement E: Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.
    # Reasoning: True. MA moves to a high-raffinose environment (watermelon). Increased substrate (raffinose) would logically induce higher enzyme (galactosidase) activity to utilize the new food source.
