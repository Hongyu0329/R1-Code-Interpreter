    "This integral equation is a Fredholm equation of the second kind with a separable kernel. The values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are related to the eigenvalues of the integral operator.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to find these values:\n1.  **Simplify the Kernel**: The kernel of the integral is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, this simplifies to a polynomial: `K(x, y) = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n2.  **Formulate the Equation**: Substituting the simplified kernel back into the equation, we can see that the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. By assuming a polynomial form for `u(x)`, we can transform the integral equation into a system of `n` linear algebraic equations.\n3.  **Matrix Representation**: This system can be written in the matrix form `(I - λA)c = b`, where `c` is a vector of coefficients related to `u(x)`. This system fails to have a unique solution when the determinant `det(I - λA) = 0`, which means `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n4.  **Eigenvalue Problem**: This problem can be transformed into finding the eigenvalues `μ` of a related `n x n` matrix `B`, where `B_jl = 1/(n+l-j)` for `j,l` from 0 to `n-1`. The critical values of `λ` are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues `μ`.\n5.  **Solvability Condition (Fredholm Alternative)**: When `1/λ` is an eigenvalue, the equation has no solution if the function on the right-hand side (which is `f(x) = 1`) is not orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of the adjoint operator. This condition can be checked for each eigenvalue. For this specific problem, it turns out that the condition for having a solution is not met for any of the eigenvalues.\n6.  **Conclusion**: Therefore, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `B`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this method. It uses the `sympy` library for accurate symbolic calculations, as numerical methods can be unstable for the matrices involved. The code will prompt you to enter a value for `n`, and then it will compute and display the corresponding values of `λ`.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    For a given integer n, this function calculates the values of λ for which\n    the integral equation u(x) = 1 + λ ∫[0,1] dy (xⁿ - yⁿ)/(x - y) u(y)\n    has no solutions.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        n = int(n)\n        if n < 1:\n            raise ValueError\n    except (ValueError, TypeError):\n        print(\"Error: Please enter a positive integer for n.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"\\nAnalyzing the integral equation for n = {n}:\")\n    \n    # The problem reduces to finding λ = 1/μ, where μ are the eigenvalues of an n x n matrix B.\n    # B[j, l] = 1 / (n + l - j) for j, l in {0, ..., n-1}.\n    # We use sympy for precision as this matrix can be ill-conditioned.\n\n    mu = sympy.Symbol('μ')\n    \n    # Construct the matrix B using rational numbers\n    B = sympy.Matrix(n, n, lambda j, l: sympy.Rational(1, n + l - j))\n\n    # The eigenvalues μ are the roots of the characteristic polynomial det(B - μ*I) = 0\n    try:\n        char_poly = B.charpoly(mu)\n        # This part fulfills the requirement: \"output each number in the final equation!\"\n        # by printing the characteristic equation for μ.\n        equation_str = str(sympy.expand(char_poly.as_expr())).replace('**', '^')\n        print(\"\\nThe values of λ are the reciprocals of μ, which are the roots of the characteristic equation:\")\n        print(f\"{equation_str} = 0\\n\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not compute the characteristic polynomial: {e}\")\n\n    # Find eigenvalues (μ) and eigenvectors (d) of B\n    try:\n        eigen_data = B.eigenvects()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not compute eigenvalues.
