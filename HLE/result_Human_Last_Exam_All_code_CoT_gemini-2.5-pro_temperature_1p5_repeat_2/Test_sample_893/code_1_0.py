  # Case A: H-free graphs. For any connected H, the set of H-free graphs
  # is non-empty. For any G in this set, the sequence G, 2G, 3G,... (disjoint unions)
  # forms an infinite ascending chain with no maximal element. So, N.

  # Case B: Finite discrete subset of R. Any finite non-empty subset of R
  # has a maximum, which is a maximal element. So, Y.

  # Case C: Countable discrete subset of R. Depends on the set.
  # S = {1, 2, 3, ...} has no maximal element.
  # S = {-1, -2, -3, ...} has -1 as a maximal element. So, D.

  # Case D: Uncountable discrete subset of R. Such a set cannot exist because
  # any discrete subset of R must be countable. The statement is vacuously true
  # for the empty class of sets. So, Y.
  answer_D = 'Y'

  # Case E: Sequences with a <= b if b is a subsequence of a.
  # A constant sequence m = (c, c, c, ...) is a maximal element.
  # Any of its infinite subsequences is m itself, so the condition
  # (m <= x implies x <= m) holds. The set has a maximal element. So, Y.
  answer_E = 'Y'

  # Case F: Sequences with a <= b if a is a subsequence of b.
  # For any sequence m, we can construct a sequence x such that m is a proper
  # subsequence of x (e.g., by prepending a new element).
  # This means for any m, there is an x such that m < x.
  # Therefore, no maximal element exists. So, N.
