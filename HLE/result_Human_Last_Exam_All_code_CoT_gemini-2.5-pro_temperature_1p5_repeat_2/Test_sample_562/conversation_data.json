    "My plan is to identify the radical (bushu) for the Japanese character 謄 and provide its name in Hepburn transcription.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Character**: I will first break down the character 謄 into its components. It consists of 月 on the left and 朕 on the right. In a left-right character structure, the left part is typically the radical.\n2.  **Identify the Radical**: The radical is the component on the left, which has the shape of 月. However, this shape can represent two different radicals: 月 (tsuki, moon) or a variant form of 肉 (niku, flesh).\n3.  **Determine the Specific Radical Name**: By consulting Kanji dictionaries, I can confirm that the radical for 謄 is the 'flesh' radical, not the 'moon' radical. When the 'flesh' radical (肉) appears on the left side of a character with the shape of 'moon' (月), it has a specific name to distinguish it.\n4.  **Find the Hepburn Transcription**: The Japanese name for this specific radical is にくづき. I will transcribe this into Hepburn romanization, which is \"Nikuzuki\".\n5.  **Generate Code**: I will write a simple Python script to print the final answer as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the radical for the kanji 謄.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Japanese character in question.\n    kanji = '謄'\n\n    # The radical (bushu) for 謄 is the left-side component, 月.\n    # This is a variant of the radical 肉 (niku, meaning 'flesh').\n    # When it appears on the left side, it is known as Nikuzuki (にくづき)\n    # to distinguish it from the 'moon' radical (tsukihen).\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Nikuzuki\"\n\n    print(f\"The bushu / radical in the Japanese character '{kanji}' is: {radical_name_hepburn}\")\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
