    # (a) True or False: In the doubling construction, each element of Q x {0, 1}
    # is contained in exactly v - 1 ND-pairs.
    # This refers to the weighted degree of a point in the graph of ND-pairs.
    # Let's analyze the weighted degree for a generic point, say (x, 0).
    # Its degree is the sum of multiplicities of all pairs containing it.
    # Pairs containing (x,0) are of the form {(x,0), (y,0)} or {(x,0), (z,1)}.
    #
    # 1. Multiplicity of {(x,0), (y,0)}: These ND-pairs only come from Type 1 blocks.
    #    This happens once for each time {x,y} is an ND-pair in the original system.
    #    So, mu'({(x,0), (y,0)}) = mu({x,y}).
    #
    # 2. Multiplicity of {(x,0), (y,1)}:
    #    - If y != x: These pairs are not formed by the standard construction. So mu'({(x,0),(y,1)}) = 0.
    #    - If y = x: The pair is {(x,0), (x,1)}. These "vertical" pairs come from Type 2
    #      blocks. A 1-factorization of K_v has v-1 factors. For each factor, point x
    #      is in exactly one pair {x,z}. This pair generates one ND-pair {(x,0),(x,1)}.
    #      So, mu'({(x,0), (x,1)}) = v - 1.
    #
    # The total weighted degree of (x,0) is:
    # Sum(mu'({(x,0),(y,0)})) for all y!=x  +  mu'({(x,0),(x,1)})
    # = Sum(mu({x,y})) for all y!=x  +  (v-1)
    # = deg_N(x) + v - 1

    # for a non-trivial nested SQS(v). Thus, the statement is false.

    # (b) What is the multiplicity of an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} if the pair
    # {x, y} had multiplicity mu in the original SQS(v)?
    # As determined in the analysis for (a), an ND-pair of the form {(x,0), (y,0)} is

    # in the original system.

    # (c) Must there exist ND-pairs with multiplicity exactly v in the constructed nested SQS(2v)?
    # Let's examine the possible multiplicities in the new system SQS(2v):
    # - mu'({(x,0), (y,0)}) = mu({x,y})
    # - mu'({(x,1), (y,1)}) = mu({x,y})
    # - mu'({(x,0), (x,1)}) = v - 1
    # - mu'({(x,0), (y,1)}) for x!=y is 0
    #
    # Can any of these be equal to v?
    # 1. Can mu({x,y}) = v? The pair {x,y} is contained in (v-2)/2 blocks.
    #    mu({x,y}) is the number of these blocks where {x,y} is chosen as the nested pair.
    #    So, mu({x,y}) <= (v-2)/2.
    #    (v-2)/2 = v  => v-2 = 2v => v = -2, which is impossible.
    #    In fact, (v-2)/2 < v for v > -2. So mu({x,y}) can never be v.
    # 2. Can v-1 = v? Clearly impossible.
    # Therefore, no ND-pair can have multiplicity exactly v.
    answer_c = "No"
