    "To find a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles of the $9_{23}$ knot, we can use a property derived from its HOMFLY polynomial, denoted as $P(a, z)$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the relevant mathematical inequality:** There is a known result in knot theory that relates the minimum number of Seifert circles of a knot, $S(K)$, to its HOMFLY polynomial. The inequality is:\n    $S(K) \\ge \\frac{\\text{span}_a(P(a, z))}{2} + 1$\n    where $\\text{span}_a(P(a, z))$ is the difference between the maximum and minimum degrees of the variable 'a' in the polynomial.\n\n2.  **Find the HOMFLY polynomial for the $9_{23}$ knot:** We will use the known HOMFLY polynomial for the $9_{23}$ knot. Its polynomial is:\n    $P(a, z) = a^{-6}(2z^2 - 1) + a^{-4}(-2z^4 + 5z^2 - 2) + a^{-2}(-z^4 + 3z^2 - 1) + a^2(z^2)$\n\n3.  **Calculate the span:** From the polynomial, we will identify the highest and lowest powers of the variable 'a'.\n    *   Maximum degree of 'a' = 2\n    *   Minimum degree of 'a' = -6\n    The span is the difference between these two values.\n\n4.  **Compute the lower bound:** We will substitute the calculated span into the inequality to find the lower bound for $S(9_{23})$.\n\n5.  **Python Implementation:** The python code will perform the calculation from steps 3 and 4 and print the reasoning and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_seifert_circle_lower_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles for the 9_23 knot.\n    This is based on the span of its HOMFLY polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    knot_name = \"9_23\"\n\n    # The HOMFLY polynomial for the 9_23 knot, P(a, z), has terms with powers of 'a'\n    # ranging from -6 to 2.
