    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that calculates the number of elements with the specified properties in the reflection group H3.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Properties:** I will start by defining the key properties of the reflection group H3: its total number of elements (group order) and its Coxeter number.\n2.  **Translate the Condition:** The problem asks for elements with a \"regular eigenvector\" whose corresponding eigenvalue has an order equal to the Coxeter number (10). According to a fundamental theorem by T. Springer, an element satisfies this condition if and only if it is conjugate to `c^k`, where `c` is a Coxeter element and `k` is an integer coprime to the Coxeter number `h=10`.\n3.  **Find Relevant Powers `k`:** I'll find all integers `k` between 1 and 9 that are coprime to 10. These are the powers we need to consider.\n4.  **Identify Distinct Conjugacy Classes:** In a reflection group, any element `g` is conjugate to its inverse `g⁻¹`. This means the conjugacy class of `c^k` is the same as the class of `c⁻ᵏ` (or `c^(h-k)`). I'll use this fact to group the powers `k` and find the number of unique conjugacy classes we need to sum up. For H3, we'll find there are two distinct classes.\n5.  **Calculate Class Size:** The size of each conjugacy class `Cl(g)` is calculated by the formula `|H3| / |C(g)|`, where `|H3|` is the group order and `|C(g)|` is the order of the centralizer of `g`. For the elements we are considering (`c^k` with `k` coprime to `h`), the centralizer's order is simply the Coxeter number, `h`.\n6.  **Sum and Final Answer:** Finally, I will sum the sizes of the distinct conjugacy classes to get the total number of elements. The script will print the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements in the H3 reflection group with a regular\n    eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue has an order of 10.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define key properties of the H3 group\n    group_order = 120  # The order of the group H3 is 120\n    coxeter_number = 10 # The Coxeter number of H3 is 10\n\n    print(\"The problem is to find the number of elements in the reflection group H3\")\n    print(\"with a regular eigenvector and an eigenvalue of order 10.\\n\")\n    print(f\"For the H3 group, the total number of elements is |H3| = {group_order}.\")\n    print(f\"The Coxeter number is h = {coxeter_number}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Use Springer's theorem to relate the problem to conjugacy classes.\n    # An element has a regular eigenvalue of order 10 if and only if it is conjugate\n    # to c^k, where c is a Coxeter element and k is coprime to h=10.\n    print(\"An element has the desired property if it is conjugate to c^k,\")\n    print(f\"where c is a Coxeter element and k is coprime to h = {coxeter_number}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find all values of k coprime to the Coxeter number.\n    coprime_k = [k for k in range(1, coxeter_number) if math.gcd(k, coxeter_number) == 1]\n    print(f\"\\nThe integers k (1 <= k < 10) that are coprime to 10 are: {coprime_k}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Identify the distinct conjugacy classes.\n    # In a reflection group, c^k is conjugate to its inverse, c^(-k).\n    # c^(-k) is equivalent to c^(h-k).\n    # So, Cl(c^k) = Cl(c^(h-k)).
