    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ (viewed as a 2-category) from an object $[n]$ to an object $[m]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and $g: [m] \\to [n]$, that form a Galois connection. This means they must satisfy the following conditions for all $i \\in [n]$ and $j \\in [m]$:\n1.  $i \\le g(f(i))$\n2.  $f(g(j)) \\le j$\n\nThese two conditions are equivalent to the more common formulation of a Galois connection: $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$.\n\nFrom this equivalence, we can deduce necessary properties of the maps $f$ and $g$.\nLet's test the condition with the bottom element of $[n]$, which is $0$.\nThe property $f(0) \\le j \\iff 0 \\le g(j)$ must hold for all $j \\in [m]$.\nThe right-hand side, $0 \\le g(j)$, is always true because the codomain of $g$ is $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, and all its elements are non-negative.\nSince the right-hand side is always true, the left-hand side must also be true for all $j \\in [m]$. That is, $f(0) \\le j$ for all $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$. This forces $f(0)$ to be the smallest element in $[m]$, so $f(0) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, any such map $f$ must be an order-preserving map from $[n]$ to $[m]$ that preserves the bottom element. Conversely, for any order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ with $f(0)=0$, a right adjoint $g$ can be constructed, and it is unique. This means the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of such maps $f$.\n\nSo, our task is to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [n] \\to [m]$ such that $f(0)=0$. An order-preserving map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values:\n$f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(n)$.\nWith the condition $f(0)=0$, we are looking for the number of sequences:\n$0 \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(n) \\le m$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using the \"stars and bars\" method. We are choosing $n$ values ($f(1), \\dots, f(n)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$ (which has $m+1$ elements) with replacement, and order does not matter (as they will be sorted into a non-decreasing sequence).\nThe formula for choosing $k$ items from a set of size $N$ with replacement is $\\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\nIn our case, we are choosing $k=n$ values from a set of size $N=m+1$.\nThe number of such maps is $\\binom{(m+1)+n-1}{n} = \\binom{n+m}{n}$.\n\nFor the given problem, we have $n=23$ and $m=37$.\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{23+37}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find the number of internal adjunctions from [n] to [m].\n# n and m are the parameters of the objects in the simplex category.\nn = 23\nm = 37\n\n# The number of such adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, n).\n# This is derived from counting the number of order-preserving maps f: [n] -> [m]\n# with the property f(0) = 0.\n# For n=23 and m=37, we need to calculate C(23+37, 23) = C(60, 23).\nN = n + m\nK = n\n\n# Calculate the binomial coefficient C(N, K)\nresult = math.comb(N, K)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result.\n# The user prompt requested to output the equation with each number.\n# The equation is C(n+m, n) = result.\nprint(f\"C({n} + {m}, {n}) = C({N}, {K}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<33372243431411160>>>"
