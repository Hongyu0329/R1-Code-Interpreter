    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar,\" we first need to define a \"nanocar\" and then understand what \"perfluoro-\" means in this context.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Identify a standard nanocar structure:** We will base our calculation on a well-documented nanocar molecule, such as the one developed by Professor James Tour's research group at Rice University. A common model for the chassis and axles of this nanocar has the chemical formula C₄₄H₂₄. The four \"wheels\" are made of fullerene (C₆₀), which contain no hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Understand \"perfluoro-\":** The prefix \"perfluoro-\" in chemistry means that all of the hydrogen (H) atoms in an organic compound have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n3.  **Calculate the number of fluorine atoms:** By replacing all 24 hydrogen atoms in the nanocar's hydrocarbon framework with fluorine atoms, we can find the number of fluorine atoms in the resulting \"perfluoronanocar.\"\n\nThe following Python code will define the number of hydrogen atoms based on the nanocar's formula and then determine the corresponding number of fluorine atoms.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fluorine_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \n    A representative nanocar chassis has the chemical formula C44H24.\n    The \"perfluoro-\" prefix means all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the number of hydrogen atoms in the chosen nanocar model (C44H24).\n    # The fullerene wheels (C60) have no hydrogens.\n    num_hydrogen_atoms = 24\n    \n    # Step 2: In a perfluorinated compound, the number of fluorine atoms\n    # equals the number of hydrogen atoms in the original molecule.\n    num_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms\n    \n    # Step 3: Print the logic and the final result, showing the substitution.\n    print(f\"The chemical formula for the hydrocarbon framework (chassis) of a representative nanocar is C44H24.\")\n    print(f\"This molecule contains {num_hydrogen_atoms} hydrogen atoms.\")\n    print(\"A 'perfluoronanocar' is a version where all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the number of fluorine atoms is:\")\n    print(f\"{num_hydrogen_atoms} (hydrogen atoms) -> {num_fluorine_atoms} (fluorine atoms)\")\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_fluorine_atoms()\n\n```\n<<<24>>>"
