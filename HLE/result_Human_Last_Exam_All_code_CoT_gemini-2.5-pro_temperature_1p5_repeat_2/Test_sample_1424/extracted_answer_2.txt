The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to a term that is linear in the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The relationship is expressed as: $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - (\epsilon_k - \mu) + i\delta}$, where $\omega$ is the frequency, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $i\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term.
