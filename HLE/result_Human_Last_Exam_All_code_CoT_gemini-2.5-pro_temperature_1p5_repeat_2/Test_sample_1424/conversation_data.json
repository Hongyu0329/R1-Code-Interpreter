    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the Green's function is derived from the generating functional, which is built upon the action of the system. For a non-interacting (bare) system of fermions, the procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the Action:** We start with the action for a non-interacting system in momentum ($k$) and Matsubara frequency ($i\\omega_n$) space. This action, $S_0$, is quadratic in the fermionic Grassmann fields ($\\psi, \\psi^*$):\n    $S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\sum_{k, n} \\psi^*(k, i\\omega_n) (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi(k, i\\omega_n)$\n    where $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for momentum state $k$, and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n\n2.  **Invert the Kernel:** The bare Green's function, $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$, is defined as the propagator of the theory. For a simple quadratic action like this, the propagator is the inverse of the term sandwiched between $\\psi^*$ and $\\psi$.\n    $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)^{-1} = -i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu$\n\n3.  **Find the Green's Function:** Inverting this expression gives the bare Green's function in Matsubara frequency space:\n    $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu}$\n\n4.  **Analytic Continuation:** To obtain the more physically intuitive real-frequency retarded Green's function, we perform an analytic continuation from the discrete Matsubara frequencies to the real frequency axis: $i\\omega_n \\rightarrow \\omega + i\\delta$, where $\\omega$ is a real frequency and $\\delta$ is a positive infinitesimal.\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{-(\\omega + i\\delta) + \\epsilon_k - \\mu} = \\frac{1}{(\\epsilon_k - \\mu) - \\omega - i\\delta}$\n\nThe functional dependence is therefore an inverse relationship. Specifically, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to a term that is linear in the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$. The following Python code prints this fundamental equation.\n\n```python\ndef display_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the symbolic formula for the bare Green's function G_0,\n    showing its dependence on the single-particle energy epsilon_k.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the symbols in the equation for clarity.\n    # These are not computational variables but labels for the printed output.\n    numerator = \"1\"\n    real_frequency = \"ω\"\n    single_particle_energy = \"ϵ_k\"\n    chemical_potential = \"μ\"\n    infinitesimal = \"iδ\" # 'i' is the imaginary unit, 'δ' is a positive infinitesimal\n    \n    # Construct the components of the equation string\n    G_0 = f\"G_0(k, {real_frequency})\"\n    denominator = f\"{real_frequency} - ({single_particle_energy} - {chemical_potential}) + {infinitesimal}\"\n    \n    # The standard form for the time-ordered Green's function is often written as:\n    # G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ sgn(ϵ_k - μ))\n    # A more common and general form for the retarded Green's function is shown below.\n    # For simplicity, we will display the general relationship which captures the core dependence.\n    denominator_standard = f\"({real_frequency} - {single_particle_energy} + {infinitesimal})\"\n    \n    # To be precise, let's represent the dependence for the retarded Green's function,\n    # obtained via analytic continuation iω_n -> ω + iδ, which results in:\n    # G_0(k, ω) = 1 / ( (ϵ_k - μ) - ω - iδ ) which is equivalent to 1 / ( ω - (ϵ_k - μ) + iδ' )\n    # Let's print the most common form found in textbooks.\n    final_denominator = f\"{real_frequency} - {single_particle_energy} + {infinitesimal.replace('δ', 'δ * sgn(ϵ_k - μ)')}\"\n    # However, for showing the fundamental dependence on ϵ_k, the simplest form is clearest.\n    \n    print(\"The bare Green's function G_0 has the following dependence on the single-particle energy ϵ_k:\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(f\"         {numerator}\")\n    print(f\"{G_0} = {'-' * (len(denominator) + 2)}\")\n    print(f\"         {denominator}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(f\"  G_0: The bare Green's function for momentum k and frequency {real_frequency}\")\n    print(f\"  {real_frequency}: The frequency (energy) of the particle\")\n    print(f\"  {single_particle_energy}: The single-particle energy eigenvalue\")\n    print(f\"  {chemical_potential}: The chemical potential\")\n    print(f\"  {infinitesimal}: An infinitesimal term that defines the pole structure\")\n\ndisplay_bare_greens_function()\n```\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to a term that is linear in the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.
