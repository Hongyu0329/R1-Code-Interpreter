    # Part (a) Reasoning:
    # If a multiset F from F and a multiset G from G have disjoint supports,
    # it means they share no common elements. This implies their intersection
    # is empty, so |F intersect G| = 0. This violates the cross 1-intersecting
    # condition which requires |F intersect G| >= 1.

    # Part (c) Reasoning:
    # For m > k+t (5 > 2+1), the only way for the sum |F| + |G| to be maximal
    # is if both families are identical and consist of all k-multisets containing
    # a fixed element x, i.e., F = G = {A inbinom([m], k) : x is in A}.
    # Therefore, F must necessarily contain all k-multisets that include a fixed element.
    ans_c = "Yes"

    # Part (b) Calculation:
    # According to Hilton's theorem for cross-intersecting multiset families,
    # for m >= k+t, the maximum sum |F| + |G| is 2 * C(m+k-t-1, k-t).
    # For t=1, the formula is 2 * C(m+k-2, k-1).

    # The size of a single maximal family (all k-multisets containing a fixed element)
    # is C(m + (k-1) - 1, k-1) = C(m+k-2, k-1).
    comb_n = m + k - 2
    comb_k = k - 1
    size_one_family = math.comb(comb_n, comb_k)

    # The sum maximal size is twice this value for cross-intersecting families.
