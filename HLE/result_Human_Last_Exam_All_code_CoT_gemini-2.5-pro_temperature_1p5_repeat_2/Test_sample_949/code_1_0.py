def solve():

    Solves the parenthetical equation problem.

    Based on the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of L(x) and D(x)
    for different families of parenthesis strings (e.g., deeply nested, broadly parallel, and binary-tree like), we determine the truth value of each statement.

    1. False. Consider a structure where L grows exponentially in D, like L~2^D. Then log L ~ D. The sum over all pairs does not cancel this gap with log D.
    2. True. loglog L ~ log D. The functions are closer, and the summation structure ensures the O-notation holds.
    3. False. Same logic as 1, the gap between D^5 and (log D)^5 is even larger.
    4. False. Same logic as 1, the gap between 2^sqrt(D) and 2^sqrt(log D) is very large.
    5. True. The exponent on D is larger than on L. Although L^0.1 grows faster than D^0.11 for a single pair in an exponential family (L~2^D), the summation over the whole string structure is dominated by "well-behaved" pairs, making the relation hold.
    6. True. Similar to 5, the exponent on D (0.5) is larger than on L (0.25), ensuring the relation holds over the sum.
