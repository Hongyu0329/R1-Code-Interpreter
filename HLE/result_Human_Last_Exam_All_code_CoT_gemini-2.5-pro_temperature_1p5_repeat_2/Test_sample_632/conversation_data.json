    "My plan is to identify the prominent architectural feature associated with the Pantheon in the Piazza della Rotonda that was famously removed. While the date provided (1950) seems to be a point of historical inaccuracy for the most well-known removal, I will focus on the most famous architectural change. I will create a Python script to present the history of this feature, including its popular nickname and the correct timeline of its existence and demolition.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pantheon_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the architectural feature removed from the Pantheon\n    in Piazza della Rotonda.\n    \"\"\"\n    feature_description = \"a pair of twin bell towers\"\n    nickname = \"le orecchie d'asino\" # Italian for \"the ass's ears\"\n    artist = \"Gian Lorenzo Bernini\"\n    year_removed = 1883\n    incorrect_year = 1950\n\n    print(f\"The unique architectural feature added to the Pantheon was {feature_description}.\")\n    print(f\"They were erected in the 17th century and are often, though perhaps incorrectly, attributed to the famous sculptor {artist}.\")\n    print(f\"The towers were highly unpopular with the citizens of Rome, who gave them the unflattering nickname '{nickname}' ('the ass\\'s ears').\")\n    print(f\"Although the prompt mentions the year {incorrect_year}, these towers were actually demolished much earlier, in the year {year_removed}, to restore the Pantheon to its earlier, classical appearance.\")\n\nsolve_pantheon_mystery()\n```\n<<<A pair of bell towers, widely known by the nickname \"the ass's ears\".>>>"
