    Analysis of Sintering Effects with a Coarsening Gas:

    A "coarsening gas" evolves from impurities during heating and becomes trapped in pores, creating internal pressure that opposes densification.

    *   A. Higher heating rates to isothermal holds resulting in lower sintered densities: LIKELY. Faster heating traps gas more effectively before it can escape, hindering densification.

    *   B. De-densification when sintering under some atmospheres, but not others: LIKELY. The chemical reaction that evolves the gas can be dependent on the sintering atmosphere (e.g., presence of oxygen).

    *   C. Large, randomly distributed voids in the sintered part: LIKELY. Gas trapped in randomly located pores will cause those pores to grow into large voids.

    *   D. Larger grain sizes in the interior of the part than near the part's surface: UNLIKELY. Trapped gas in interior pores will "pin" grain boundaries, *inhibiting* grain growth. Gas can escape near the surface, allowing for more normal, larger grain growth. Therefore, smaller grains are expected in the interior, not larger ones.

    *   E. Cracking: LIKELY. High internal gas pressure can exceed the material's strength, causing cracks.

    *   F. Higher green densities resulting in lower sintered densities: LIKELY. Higher initial density leads to earlier pore closure, which traps more gas, resulting in greater de-densification and thus lower final density.

    Conclusion: The effect described in D is the opposite of what is physically expected.
