    "The problem asks for the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. The GSD is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **General Formula:** The number of logical qubits `k` depends on the genus `g` of the surface and the number and type of boundaries (holes). For a surface with genus `g`, `n` smooth boundaries, and `m` rough boundaries, the number of logical qubits is given by the formula:\n    *   `k = 2g + n + m - 2`, if both `n > 0` and `m > 0`.\n    *   `k = 2g + n - 1`, if `m = 0` and `n > 0`.\n    *   `k = 2g + m - 1`, if `n = 0` and `m > 0`.\n    *   `k = 2g`, if `n = 0` and `m = 0`.\n\n2.  **Interpreting the Question:** The question is ambiguous regarding the genus `g` of the underlying surface. There are two standard choices:\n    *   A sphere or a plane, which has genus `g=0`.\n    *   A torus, which has genus `g=1`.\n\n3.  **The \"Toric Code\" Clue:** The name \"toric code\" itself strongly suggests that the intended geometry is a torus, which is the canonical manifold for this code. Therefore, we will assume `g=1`.\n\n4.  **Assuming General Case for Holes:** The question mentions both `n` smooth and `m` rough holes, which implies the most general case where `n > 0` and `m > 0`. In this case, we use the formula `k = 2g + n + m - 2`.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** Substituting `g=1` into the formula:\n    `k = 2 * 1 + n + m - 2`\n    `k = 2 + n + m - 2`\n    `k = n + m`\n\n6.  **Final Degeneracy:** The ground space degeneracy is `GSD = 2^k`. With `k = n + m`, we get:\n    `GSD = 2^(n + m)`\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice A. The following Python code uses symbolic variables to represent `n` and `m` and prints the final derived formula.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_toric_code_degeneracy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy of the toric code\n    with n smooth and m rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables for the number of holes\n    n = sympy.Symbol('n')\n    m = sympy.Symbol('m')\n\n    # The genus 'g' of the surface is assumed to be 1, as the name \"toric code\"\n    # suggests a torus.\n    g = 1\n    \n    # The number of logical qubits 'k' on a genus-g surface with n smooth and m rough holes\n    # (assuming n > 0 and m > 0) is given by the formula: k = 2*g + n + m - 2.\n    k = 2*g + n + m - 2\n    \n    # The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is 2^k.\n    # The final equation is GSD = 2^(n+m). We will print this result.\n    \n    print(\"The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is determined by the number of logical qubits, k.\")\n    print(\"Assuming the surface is a torus (genus g=1) with n smooth and m rough holes (n>0, m>0):\")\n    print(f\"The number of logical qubits k = 2*g + n + m - 2 = 2*1 + n + m - 2 = n + m.\")\n    print(\"The final formula for the GSD is:\")\n    # Using python's print capabilities to show the final equation with its components\n    base = 2\n    exponent = \"n + m\"\n    print(f\"GSD = {base}^({exponent})\")\n\nsolve_toric_code_degeneracy()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
