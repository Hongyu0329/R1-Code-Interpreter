    "The problem asks for the maximum generalised hypertreewidth (g-htw) of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, where the rank (maximum size of a hyperedge) is not bounded.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the concept of generalised hypertreewidth (g-htw).** The g-htw is determined by the size of the largest \"bag\" in an optimal tree decomposition. The width is `max(|Bag|) - 1`. To maximize the width, we need to construct a hypergraph that forces any decomposition to have a very large bag.\n2.  **Construct a \"worst-case\" hypergraph.** A hypergraph with a cyclic structure of intersections among its hyperedges is known to produce high treewidth. We will use this structure for our 3 hyperedges, `e1`, `e2`, and `e3`.\n    *   Let A, B, and C be three disjoint sets of vertices.\n    *   Define the hyperedges as:\n        *   `e1 = A ∪ B`\n        *   `e2 = B ∪ C`\n        *   `e3 = C ∪ A`\n3.  **Calculate the g-htw of this constructed hypergraph.** For any tree decomposition of this hypergraph, there must be a central bag that contains vertices from all three pairwise intersections (`e1 ∩ e2 = B`, `e2 ∩ e3 = C`, `e3 ∩ e1 = A`). This forces the bag to contain `A ∪ B ∪ C`. Therefore, the minimum possible size for the largest bag is `|A| + |B| + |C|`, and the g-htw is `|A| + |B| + |C| - 1`.\n4.  **Show that the g-htw is unbounded.** The problem states that the rank of the hypergraph is not bounded. In our construction, the rank is `max(|A|+|B|, |B|+|C|, |C|+|A|)`. Since we can choose the sizes of sets A, B, and C to be arbitrarily large (e.g., `|A|=|B|=|C|=K` for any integer `K`), the g-htw (`3K - 1`) can also be made arbitrarily large. This means there is no finite maximum value.\n5.  **Provide a Python script as a demonstration.** The script will implement the g-htw calculation for our constructed hypergraph for a given size `K`, illustrating that the g-htw can be increased simply by increasing `K`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_ghtw_for_cyclic_hypergraph(K):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the generalised hypertreewidth (g-htw) for a constructed\n    3-edge hypergraph to demonstrate its unbounded nature.\n\n    The hypergraph is constructed from three disjoint sets of vertices A, B, and C.\n    We assume |A| = |B| = |C| = K.\n    The hyperedges are e1 = A U B, e2 = B U C, e3 = C U A.\n    The g-htw of this hypergraph is |A| + |B| + |C| - 1.\n\n    Args:\n        K (int): The size for each of the disjoint vertex sets A, B, and C.\n                 A larger K demonstrates how the g-htw can grow without bound.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(K, int) or K <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: K must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    size_A = K\n    size_B = K\n    size_C = K\n\n    # The g-htw for this construction is the sum of the sizes of the\n    # disjoint sets minus one.\n    result = size_A + size_B + size_C - 1\n\n    print(\"For a constructed hypergraph with 3 hyperedges and component sets of size K:\")\n    print(f\"K = {K}\")\n    print(f\"The size of set A, |A| = {size_A}\")\n    print(f\"The size of set B, |B| = {size_B}\")\n    print(f\"The size of set C, |C| = {size_C}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe g-htw is calculated using the formula: |A| + |B| + |C| - 1\")\n    # Final output showing the numbers in the equation\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {size_A} + {size_B} + {size_C} - 1 = {result}\")\n    print(f\"\\nBy choosing a larger K, we can make the g-htw arbitrarily large.\")\n\n# Demonstrate with an example value for K.\n# The user can change this value to see the g-htw change.\nexample_K = 100\ncalculate_ghtw_for_cyclic_hypergraph(example_K)\n\n```\n<<<unbounded>>>"
