    "This is a fascinating sequence. After analyzing its properties, it's clear that it isn't based on a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. The rule governing the sequence is based on a specific property of number theory.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Pattern**: The sequence consists of **Zumkeller numbers**. A number `n` is a Zumkeller number if its divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets that have the same sum.\n2.  **Formulate a Test**: For a number `n` to be a Zumkeller number:\n    a. The sum of all its positive divisors, σ(n), must be an even number.\n    b. There must be a subset of its divisors that sums up to exactly half of the total sum, i.e., `σ(n) / 2`.\n3.  **Find the Next Number**: The last number provided in the sequence is 2352. My goal is to find the first Zumkeller number greater than 2352.\n4.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script to:\n    a. Start checking integers sequentially, beginning from `2352 + 1 = 2353`.\n    b. For each integer, test if it is a Zumkeller number using the conditions described above. This involves finding all divisors, calculating their sum, and then solving a subset sum problem.\n    c. Once the next Zumkeller number is found, the script will print the result along with the calculation that confirms its property, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to find the next number in the sequence.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef find_subset_sum(numbers, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a subset of 'numbers' can sum to 'target' and returns the subset.\n    Uses a dynamic programming approach with backtracking to find the actual numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    dp = {0: []}\n    for num in numbers:\n        # Create new sums by adding the current number to existing sums\n        new_sums = {}\n        for s, subset in dp.items():\n            if s + num <= target:\n                new_sums[s + num] = subset + [num]\n        \n        # Add the new sums to the dp table\n        for s, subset in new_sums.items():\n            # Only update if the key is new, to keep the first found subset\n            if s not in dp:\n                dp[s] = subset\n\n        if target in dp:\n            return dp[target]\n            \n    return None if target not in dp else dp[target]\n\ndef is_zumkeller(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number n is a Zumkeller number.\n    Returns a tuple (is_zumkeller, details_dictionary).\n    \"\"\"\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    sigma = sum(divisors)\n\n    # Sum of divisors must be even\n    if sigma % 2 != 0:\n        return False, {}\n\n    target_partition_sum = sigma // 2\n\n    # n itself must be a divisor.
