    "To find the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma, we will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. This protocol involves entangling the players' initial states and allowing them to apply quantum strategies (unitary operators) to their respective qubits.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Game Setup**: The game uses the given payoff matrix:\n    *   `R = 5` (Cooperate, Cooperate)\n    *   `S = 0` (Cooperate, Defect)\n    *   `T = 7` (Defect, Cooperate)\n    *   `P = 1` (Defect, Defect)\n    The initial state is created by an entangling operator `J(γ) = exp(iγ/2 * σ_x ⊗ σ_x)`, where `γ` represents the degree of entanglement. We can design this initial state by choosing `γ`.\n\n2.  **Identify Strategies**: In the quantum game, the classical strategies 'Cooperate' (C) and 'Defect' (D) are extended to a larger set of quantum strategies. A key quantum strategy, often called 'Q' (for Quantum), is `Q = iσ_z`. The classical Nash Equilibrium is (D, D) with a payoff of (1, 1). We are looking for a new, potentially better, equilibrium.\n\n3.  **Find the Quantum Equilibrium**: We will investigate if a new Nash Equilibrium `(Q, Q)` exists. An equilibrium occurs when no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\n4.  **Formulate Payoff Equations**: The expected payoffs depend on the players' strategies and the entanglement `γ`. Let `s_g^2 = sin^2(γ/2)` and `c_g^2 = cos^2(γ/2)`. The payoffs for Player 1 (Alice) under different scenarios are:\n    *   Alice plays Q, Bob plays Q: `$A(Q, Q) = R*c_g^2 + P*s_g^2 = 5*c_g^2 + 1*s_g^2`\n    *   Alice deviates to D, Bob plays Q: `$A(D, Q) = T*s_g^2 + S*c_g^2 = 7*s_g^2 + 0*c_g^2`\n\n5.  **Establish Equilibrium Condition**: For `(Q, Q)` to be a Nash Equilibrium, the payoff for playing Q must be greater than or equal to the payoff for deviating to D.\n    `$A(Q, Q) >= $A(D, Q)`\n    `5*c_g^2 + 1*s_g^2 >= 7*s_g^2`\n\n6.  **Solve for Optimal Entanglement**: We will solve this inequality for the entanglement parameter `γ`. Using the identity `c_g^2 = 1 - s_g^2`, we can find the maximum value of `s_g^2` (and thus the maximum entanglement `γ`) that sustains the `(Q, Q)` equilibrium. The problem states we should design an optimal initial state, so we will choose the entanglement that maximizes the payoff at this equilibrium.\n\n7.  **Calculate Equilibrium Payoff**: Using the optimal entanglement value, we will calculate the final numerical payoff at the `(Q, Q)` equilibrium point. The final output will present this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the optimal equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma.\n\n    This function follows the EWL protocol to find the condition for a new\n    Nash Equilibrium (Q, Q) to exist and calculates the payoff at the optimal\n    point of that equilibrium.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define payoffs from the matrix\n    # R: (Cooperate, Cooperate), S: (Cooperate, Defect)\n    # T: (Defect, Cooperate), P: (Defect, Defect)\n    R, S, T, P = 5, 0, 7, 1\n\n    # Step 2: Define symbolic variables for entanglement\n    # sg2 represents sin^2(gamma/2)\n    # cg2 represents cos^2(gamma/2)\n    sg2, cg2 = sympy.symbols('sg2 cg2')\n\n    # Step 3: Formulate payoff equations based on the EWL protocol\n    # Payoff for player A if both play the quantum strategy 'Q'\n    payoff_QQ = R * cg2 + P * sg2\n    \n    # Payoff for player A if she defects ('D') while player B plays 'Q'\n    payoff_DQ = T * sg2 + S * cg2\n\n    # Step 4: Establish the Nash Equilibrium condition\n    # The payoff for playing Q must be at least as good as defecting\n    # A(Q, Q) >= A(D, Q)\n    equilibrium_condition = sympy.Ge(payoff_QQ, payoff_DQ)\n\n    # Step 5: Solve for the optimal entanglement\n    # Substitute cg2 = 1 - sg2 to solve in terms of sg2\n    condition_in_sg2 = equilibrium_condition.subs(cg2, 1 - sg2)\n    \n    # The inequality becomes: 5*(1-sg2) + 1*sg2 >= 7*sg2\n    # 5 - 5*sg2 + sg2 >= 7*sg2\n    # 5 - 4*sg2 >= 7*sg2\n    # 5 >= 11*sg2  => sg2 <= 5/11\n    \n    # We choose the boundary condition to maximize the equilibrium payoff\n    optimal_sg2 = sympy.Rational(5, 11)\n    optimal_cg2 = 1 - optimal_sg2\n\n    # Step 6: Calculate the final equilibrium payoff\n    # Substitute the optimal entanglement value back into the payoff equation for (Q, Q)\n    equilibrium_payoff_expr = R * cg2 + P * sg2\n    equilibrium_payoff = equilibrium_payoff_expr.subs({cg2: optimal_cg2, sg2: optimal_sg2})\n\n    # Display the final calculation steps\n    # The payoff formula simplifies to 4*cg2 + 1\n    # Payoff = 4 * (6/11) + 1 = 24/11 + 11/11 = 35/11\n    p1 = 4\n    p2 = optimal_cg2.p\n    p3 = optimal_cg2.q\n    p4 = 1\n    \n    print(\"The equilibrium is found by choosing an optimal level of entanglement.\")\n    print(\"The condition for the quantum strategy (Q,Q) to be a Nash Equilibrium is sin^2(gamma/2) <= 5/11.\")\n    print(\"Choosing the maximum allowed entanglement, sin^2(gamma/2) = 5/11, we get cos^2(gamma/2) = 6/11.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe payoff at this equilibrium point is calculated using the formula: R*cos^2(gamma/2) + P*sin^2(gamma/2)\")\n    print(\"Which simplifies to: 4*cos^2(gamma/2) + 1\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{p1} * ({p2}/{p3}) + {p4} = {equilibrium_payoff}\")\n\nsolve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma()\n<<<35/11>>>\n```"
