    "Here is a plan to determine the correct answer:\n1.  **Analyze the organism:** The question is about the diet of adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies.\n2.  **Research the diet:** I will access entomological knowledge about snakeflies. Key information is that both larvae and adults are predatory, feeding on other small insects and arthropods. This makes option 'E' (Totara Aphids) a strong possibility, as aphids are a classic prey item.\n3.  **Investigate secondary food sources:** I will check if they consume other food types. Research indicates that while being predators, adult snakeflies also supplement their diet with nectar and pollen, which are sources of carbohydrates for energy. This makes option 'A' (Nectar) also correct.\n4.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   A. Nectar: Correct, but potentially incomplete.\n    *   B. Māhoe pollen: Plausible since they eat pollen, but 'Nectar' is a broader, more commonly cited food source.\n    *   C. Fungus: Incorrect. Not a known food source.\n    *   D. Karamū leaf tissue: Incorrect. They are not herbivorous.\n    *   E. Totara Aphids: Correct, but potentially incomplete.\n    *   F. A and E: This option combines both known food types (nectar for energy, aphids for protein/lipids). This is the most comprehensive and accurate choice.\n    *   G. D and E: Incorrect because D is incorrect.\n5.  **Construct the code:** The Python script will print out this chain of reasoning, explaining why A and E are correct individually, and therefore why F is the best final answer. It will present the conclusion in a format that resembles combining two correct facts, satisfying the \"final equation\" constraint.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)\n    to determine the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans...\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 1: Evaluate predatory behavior.\n    fact_1 = \"Adult Raphidiopterans are known predators of small, soft-bodied insects like aphids.\"\n    option_e_text = \"E.
