    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral is of the form $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)} dx$, where $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. We need to find an approximation for small $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Dominant Behavior:** As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the value of the integral is dominated by the contribution from the region where the denominator is smallest. This occurs near $x=0$, where $f(x)=0$.\n\n3.  **Approximate the Function:** For $x$ near $0$, the function $f(x)$ is best approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$. Thus, we can write $f(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$.\n\n4.  **Approximate the Integral:** We can now substitute this approximation into the integral. The contribution from the part of the interval away from $x=0$ is negligible compared to the diverging part. Therefore, we can simplify the calculation by extending the upper integration limit to infinity. This is a standard technique in asymptotic analysis.\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n5.  **Solve the Approximate Integral:** This integral can be solved using the substitution $x = (\\epsilon/9.0)^{1/5.0} u$. This leads to:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\epsilon^{1/5.0 - 1} \\cdot 9.0^{-1/5.0} \\cdot \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^{5.0}} du$\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Standard Integral:** The definite integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^n} du$ has a known solution: $\\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$. For our case, $n=5.0$.\n\n7.  **Final Formula:** Combining these steps, we arrive at the analytical approximation of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^{\\alpha}$, where:\n    *   $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{5.0} - 1 = -0.8$\n    *   $C = 9.0^{-1/5.0} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi/5.0}{\\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$\n\nI will now provide a Python script that calculates the numerical values for $C$ and $\\alpha$ and prints the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the parameters from the integral's denominator polynomial:\n# 9.0 * x**5.0 + 5.0 * x**6.0 + 9.0 * x**8.0\n# The approximation for small x is dominated by the term with the lowest exponent, p0 * x**n0.\np0 = 9.0\nn0 = 5.0\n\n# The analytical approximation for the integral I(epsilon) for small epsilon has the form:\n# I(epsilon) ~= C * epsilon**alpha\n\n# The exponent alpha is determined by the dominant power n0.\n# alpha = 1/n0 - 1\nalpha = 1.0 / n0 - 1.0\n\n# The coefficient C is derived from the parameters and a standard integral result.\n# C = p0**(-1/n0) * integral_0^inf(1/(1+u**n0)) du\n# The standard integral is equal to (pi/n0) / sin(pi/n0).\nintegral_val = (math.pi / n0) / math.sin(math.pi / n0)\nC = (p0**(-1.0 / n0)) * integral_val\n\n# Output the results, showing how the formula is constructed.\nprint(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is derived from its dominant behavior near x=0.\")\nprint(\"The derived formula structure is: I(epsilon) ~= C * epsilon**alpha\")\nprint(\"\\nBased on the specific integral provided, the detailed formula is:\")\nprint(f\"I(epsilon) ~= ( {p0}**(-1.0/{n0}) * (pi/{n0}) / sin(pi/{n0}) ) * epsilon**(1.0/{n0} - 1.0)\")\n\nprint(\"\\nEvaluating the numerical constants:\")\nprint(f\"The exponent alpha = 1.0/{n0} - 1.0 = {alpha}\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient C = {p0}**(-1.0/{n0}) * (math.pi/{n0}) / math.sin(math.pi/{n0}) = {C}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThus, the final numerical approximation is:\")\nprint(f\"I(epsilon) ~= {C:.4f} * epsilon**({alpha})\")\n\n```\n<<<0.6888>>>"
