    print("--- Question 1: Complexity of Constant Precision Transformers ---")
    explanation1 = """
    We are asked for the complexity class of constant-depth, polynomial-width transformers with constant-precision arithmetic.

    Reasoning:
    1.  The starting point is the known result that transformers with similar properties but logarithmic (log n) precision are in TC0. TC0 is the class of problems solvable by constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits with threshold gates.

    2.  The fundamental operations within a transformer layer are matrix multiplications and attention calculations, which boil down to computing weighted sums of many inputs. Since the transformer width is polynomial in the input size 'n', each neuron or attention score is a sum over poly(n) terms.

    3.  Let's analyze this summation. The operation is 'SUM(w_i * x_i)' for i=1 to poly(n). If weights 'w_i' and inputs 'x_i' have constant precision (e.g., a fixed 'b' bits), their product 'w_i * x_i' also has constant precision ('2b' bits).

    4.  The core task is to sum poly(n) constant-bit numbers. This is equivalent to counting, as the sum can be constructed by counting the number of set bits at each bit position and then combining them. The 'COUNTING' problem for poly(n) bits is not solvable by AC0 circuits (constant-depth, AND/OR gates). It provably requires the power of threshold gates, which can count their inputs.

    5.  Since the summation over a polynomial number of inputs requires threshold gates to be performed in constant depth, the model's complexity is defined by these gates. Therefore, the overall complexity class remains TC0. Reducing precision from log(n) to constant does not remove this fundamental requirement.

    Conclusion: The complexity class for constant-precision transformers is TC0.

    # --- Part 2: Transformers with Polynomial Chain-of-Thought ---
    print("\n--- Question 2: Complexity of Transformers with Polynomial CoT ---")
    explanation2 = """
    We are asked for the complexity class of a transformer that performs a polynomial number of autoregressive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) steps.

    Reasoning:
    1.  A single pass of the transformer (the base function for each step) is a computation within TC0, as established. Since TC0 is a subset of P (Polynomial Time), each step can be computed in polynomial time.

    2.  Chain-of-Thought is an iterative process. The model computes an output (a "thought"), appends it to its input, and repeats this process. Let P(n) be the number of steps, where P is a polynomial.

    3.  This is an inherently sequential computation: Step 'i' cannot begin until Step 'i-1' is complete. The total computation is a sequence of P(n) calls to the base transformer function.

    4.  The total running time is the number of steps multiplied by the time for each step. Since the input size grows polynomially and each step takes polynomial time, the total time is poly(n) * poly(n), which is still polynomial in 'n'.

    5.  A process that completes in a polynomial number of steps on a deterministic Turing machine defines the complexity class P.

    6.  Furthermore, this model of iterating a simple function is known to be very powerful. Iterating a TC0 function polynomially is sufficient to simulate any polynomial-time Turing machine. This means the model is not only in P but is likely P-complete, representing the full power of sequential polynomial-time computation.

    Conclusion: The complexity class for transformers with polynomial CoT is P.
