    "My plan to solve this problem is to use a known mathematical identity for an infinite product and adapt it to the specific indices given in the problem.\n\n1.  **Factorization**: The term inside the product, $(1 - z^3/n^3)$, can be factorized using the cube roots of unity. If $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$ is the principal cube root of unity, the factorization is $(1 - z/n)(1 - z\\omega/n)(1 - z\\omega^2/n)$.\n2.  **Gamma Function Identity**: This factorization allows the infinite product to be related to the Gamma function. There is a standard identity for a product starting from $n=1$:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n3.  **Adjusting the Starting Index**: The product in the question starts from $n=3$, not $n=1$. To find the value, I will take the result of the product starting from $n=1$ and divide it by the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n    *   Term for $n=1$: $(1 - z^3/1^3) = 1 - z^3$\n    *   Term for $n=2$: $(1 - z^3/2^3) = 1 - z^3/8$\n4.  **Final Expression**: By combining these pieces, I can construct the final symbolic expression for the given infinite product.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to present this final result. The script will use the `print` function to output the formula in a clear, formatted way, ensuring all numbers and mathematical symbols involved ($\\Gamma$, $\\omega$) are explicitly defined as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs and prints the symbolic expression for the infinite product\n    from n=3 to infinity of (1 - z^3/n^3).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the numbers that appear in the equation for clarity and to meet the user's request.\n    start_index = 3\n    power = 3\n    num_1 = 1\n    num_2 = 2\n    num_2_cubed = num_2**power\n\n    # Build the string representing the final expression.\n    # The numerator of the final expression is 1.\n    numerator = f\"{num_1}\"\n\n    # The denominator consists of the terms for n=1 and n=2, and the Gamma function product.\n    term_n1 = f\"(1 - z^{power})\"\n    term_n2 = f\"(1 - z^{power}/{num_2_cubed})\"\n    gamma_product_str = f\"Gamma({num_1} - z) * Gamma({num_1} - z*w) * Gamma({num_1} - z*w^2)\"\n\n    # Combine the parts into the final equation string.\n    final_equation = f\"{numerator} / ({term_n1} * {term_n2} * {gamma_product_str})\"\n\n    # Print the full explanation and the resulting formula.\n    print(f\"The value of the infinite product Product_{{n={start_index} to inf}}(1 - z^{power}/n^{power}) is given by the following expression:\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + final_equation + \"\\n\")\n    print(\"where:\")\n    print(\"  Gamma(x) is the Gamma function.\")\n    print(f\"  w = exp(2*pi*i/{power}), which is the principal cube root of unity.\")\n    print(f\"  w^2 = exp(4*pi*i/{power}), which is the other complex cube root of unity.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the solution.\nsolve_infinite_product()\n```\n<<<1 / ((1 - z^3) * (1 - z^3/8) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(2*pi*i/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(4*pi*i/3)))>>>"
