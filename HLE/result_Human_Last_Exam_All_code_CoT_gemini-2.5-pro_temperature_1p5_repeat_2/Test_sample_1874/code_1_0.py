    Solves the set theory problem about the length of a tower of subsets of omega_2.

    # In set theory, omega_n (or aleph_n) represents the n-th infinite cardinal.
    # omega_2 is the second uncountable cardinal.

    # Step 1: Understand the structure.
    # The problem describes an increasing chain of subsets of omega_2, ordered by "almost inclusion".
    # A set A is "almost a subset" of B if the size of the difference |A \ B| is "small".
    # In this problem, "small" means size < omega_2.
    # The chain <x_alpha : alpha in delta> is "cofinal", meaning there is no single set
    # that is an "almost superset" to all sets in the chain.
    # The length of this chain is delta.

    # Step 2: Determine the smallest possible delta.
    # The minimal length of such a cofinal chain on P(kappa)/I_{<kappa} for a regular
    # cardinal kappa > omega is a standard result in cardinal characteristics.
    # This minimal length is denoted by t(kappa) or b(kappa) and is equal to kappa^+.
    # In our case, kappa = omega_2.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible cardinal delta is (omega_2)^+.
    
    smallest_delta = {
        "symbol": "omega_3",
        "relation": "(omega_2)^+"
    }

    # Step 3: Determine the properties of delta.
    # The length 'delta' of any such cofinal tower must be a regular cardinal.
    # If delta were a singular cardinal, a shorter chain of length cf(delta) < delta could be found
    # which would also be cofinal, contradicting the tower's properties with respect to delta.
    # So, any possible delta must be a regular cardinal.

    # Step 4: Find the second smallest delta.
    # We are looking for the second smallest cardinal delta that meets these conditions:
    # a) delta must be greater than or equal to the minimum possible length, omega_3.
    # b) delta must be a regular cardinal.

    # The sequence of regular cardinals beginning from omega_3 is:
    # omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, ...
    # Note: For any ordinal n, omega_{n+1} is a regular cardinal.

    # The smallest cardinal satisfying the conditions is the first in the list.
    # The second smallest cardinal satisfying the conditions is the second in the list.
    
    second_smallest_delta = {
        "symbol": "omega_4",
        "relation": "(omega_3)^+"
    }
    
    # Step 5: Print the final result, showing the equation as requested.
    print("The smallest possible cardinal delta is the successor of omega_2.")

    print("\nAny possible delta must be a regular cardinal.")
    print("The next regular cardinal after omega_3 is omega_4.")
