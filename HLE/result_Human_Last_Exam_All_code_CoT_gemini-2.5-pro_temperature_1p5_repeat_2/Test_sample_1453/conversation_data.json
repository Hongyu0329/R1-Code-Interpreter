    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence, we need to analyze its coiled-coil structure. The oligomeric state is primarily dictated by the packing of amino acid side chains at the core of the coiled-coil, a principle known as \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** Coiled-coil proteins have a characteristic 7-residue (heptad) repeat, conventionally labeled `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the `a` and `d` positions form the hydrophobic core that holds the helices together. The first step is to find the correct \"phasing\" (or rotational register) of this repeat along the given sequence. I will write a script to test all 7 possible starting frames.\n2.  **Find the Best Phasing:** For each of the 7 possible phasings, the script will calculate a score based on the combined hydrophobicity of the residues assigned to the core `a` and `d` positions. The most likely phasing is the one that maximizes the hydrophobicity of the core. I will use the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale for this scoring.\n3.  **Analyze the Core Residues:** Once the optimal phasing is identified, the script will list the specific amino acids that occupy the `a` and `d` positions.\n4.  **Predict the Oligomeric State:** The final oligomeric state is predicted based on the identity of these core residues. The relative size of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions is a strong determinant:\n    *   **Trimer (3-helix bundle):** Favored by a pattern where `a` positions are occupied by small hydrophobic residues (like Alanine) and `d` positions are occupied by large hydrophobic residues (like Leucine or Isoleucine).\n    *   **Dimer (2-helix bundle):** Favored when both `a` and `d` positions contain large hydrophobic residues.\n    *   **Tetramer (4-helix bundle):** Often favored by the reverse pattern of a trimer, with large residues at `a` and small residues at `d`.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this analysis and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = \"GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG\"\n    \n    # Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale.
