    Let's review the findings from the step-by-step derivation:
    1.  Φ(k) = 0: False.
    2.  l.Φ(m) = 0: True.
    3.  (km).Φ(l) = 0: True.
    4.  (klm).Φ(k) = 0: True (always).
    5.  Φ²(k;l) = 0: False.

    7.  (lm).Φ²(k;m) = 0: True (always).
    8.  (klm).Φ²(k;l) = 0: True.
    9.  Φ³(k;l;m) = 0: False.
    10. k.Φ³(k;l;m) = 0: True (always).
    11. (lm).Φ³(k;l;m) = 0: True (always).
    12. (lmk).Φ³(k;l;m) = 0: True (always).

    The true identities are represented by the numbers: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12.
