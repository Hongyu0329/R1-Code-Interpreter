    This function computes the symbolic expression for the limit based on k.
    
    The problem asks for the limit: lim_{m -> infinity} (ln f(m)) / (ln m).
    
    Based on established results in extremal combinatorics, the asymptotic behavior of f(m) is:
    f(m) = Theta(m**(k / (2*k - 1)))
    
    This leads to the limit being the exponent of m in the asymptotic formula.
