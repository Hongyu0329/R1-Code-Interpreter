    "To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus, we can use a powerful result from differential topology called Morse Theory.\n\n### My plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the topology of the space**: The space is the 2-torus, $T^2$. We need to know its Betti numbers, which describe its fundamental topological features (connected components, holes, voids, etc.).\n2.  **Apply the Morse Inequalities**: Morse theory provides a fundamental relationship between the number of critical points of a function and the Betti numbers of the space. Specifically, for a Morse function (a type of \"nice\" smooth function), the number of critical points of a given index must be at least the corresponding Betti number.\n3.  **Calculate the lower bound**: By summing the Betti numbers, we can find the minimum possible total number of critical points for any Morse function on the torus. It turns out that this lower bound holds for any smooth function.\n4.  **Confirm the minimum**: I will confirm that this theoretical minimum can be achieved by providing an example of a function on the torus that has exactly this number of critical points.\n5.  **Write a Python script**: The script will codify this logic, state the Betti numbers, apply the inequalities, and calculate the final result, printing out the final equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points_on_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus using Morse Theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"This problem can be solved using Morse Theory, which relates the topology of a manifold to the critical points of a smooth function on it.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2).\n    # b_k = rank of the k-th homology group.\n    # b_0: number of connected components.\n    # b_1: number of 1-dimensional \"circular\" holes.\n    # b_2: number of 2-dimensional \"voids\".\n    b_0 = 1  # The torus is connected.\n    b_1 = 2  # The torus has two independent loops (one \"around\" and one \"through\" the hole).\n    b_2 = 1  # The torus encloses one surface.\n    \n    betti_numbers = [b_0, b_1, b_2]\n    \n    print(f\"The Betti numbers of the 2-torus (T^2) are:\")\n    print(f\"b_0 = {b_0}\")\n    print(f\"b_1 = {b_1}\")\n    print(f\"b_2 = {b_2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Step 2: Apply the Morse inequalities.\n    # For a Morse function, the number of critical points of index k (c_k)\n    # is at least the k-th Betti number (b_k).\n    # c_k >= b_k\n    # c_0: number of local minima\n    # c_1: number of saddle points (index 1)\n    # c_2: number of local maxima\n    \n    print(\"According to the weak Morse inequalities, the number of critical points of index k (c_k)\")\n    print(\"for any Morse function f on T^2 is bounded by the Betti numbers (b_k):\")\n    print(f\"c_0 >= b_0 = {b_0}\")\n    print(f\"c_1 >= b_1 = {b_1}\")\n    print(f\"c_2 >= b_2 = {b_2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the minimal total number of critical points.\n    # The total number of critical points C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2.\n    # Therefore, C >= b_0 + b_1 + b_2.\n    \n    min_critical_points = sum(betti_numbers)\n    \n    print(\"The total number of critical points (C) must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers.\")\n    print(\"C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 >= b_0 + b_1 + b_2\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation with the numbers.\n    equation_str = f\"{b_0} + {b_1} + {b_2} = {min_critical_points}\"\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the minimum required number of points:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Step 4: Confirm that this minimum is achievable.\n    print(\"This minimum is indeed achievable.
