    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform calculations with very high precision because 10^100 (a googol) is an astronomically large number. Standard floating-point arithmetic is insufficient.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Leverage Periodicity**: The tangent function has a period of π (pi). This means that `tan(x) = tan(x - k*π)` for any integer `k`. We can use this property to reduce the huge number `10^100` to a small number between 0 and π. The problem then becomes `tan(10^100 mod π)`.\n2.  **High-Precision Arithmetic**: To calculate `10^100 mod π` accurately, we need a high-precision value of π and a library capable of handling arithmetic with many digits of precision. We will use Python's built-in `decimal` module for this task. The precision needs to be greater than 100 digits to handle `10^100`. We'll use a precision of 120 digits to be safe.\n3.  **Implement `tan` function**: The `decimal` module does not have a built-in `tan` function. We will implement our own by using the identity `tan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x)`. The `sin(x)` and `cos(x)` functions will be implemented using their well-known Taylor series expansions, which allow for computation to any desired precision.\n4.  **Calculation**:\n    *   Set the precision for the `decimal` context.\n    *   Define `x = 10^100`.\n    *   Calculate the remainder `r = x mod π`.\n    *   Compute `tan(r)` using our custom high-precision functions.\n5.  **Extract Digits**: Once we have the final value, we will convert it to a string and extract the first three digits that appear after the decimal point.\n\nThis approach will give us the accurate result required by the problem.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef sin(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes sin(x) for a Decimal object x using its Taylor series.\n    sin(x) = x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - ...\n    \"\"\"\n    # Temporarily increase precision for intermediate calculations\n    decimal.getcontext().prec += 2\n    i, lasts, s, fact, num, sign = 1, 0, x, 1, x, 1\n    # Series evaluation continues until the sum stops changing\n    while s != lasts:\n        lasts = s\n        i += 2\n        fact *= i * (i-1)\n        num *= x * x\n        sign *= -1\n        s += num / fact * sign\n    # Restore original precision\n    decimal.getcontext().prec -= 2\n    return +s\n\ndef cos(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes cos(x) for a Decimal object x using its Taylor series.\n    cos(x) = 1 - x^2/2! + x^4/4! - ...\n    \"\"\"\n    decimal.getcontext().prec += 2\n    i, lasts, s, fact, num, sign = 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n    while s != lasts:\n        lasts = s\n        i += 2\n        fact *= i * (i-1)\n        num *= x * x\n        sign *= -1\n        s += num / fact * sign\n    decimal.getcontext().prec -= 2\n    return +s\n\ndef tan(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes tan(x) for a Decimal object x.\n    tan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x)\n    \"\"\"\n    return sin(x) / cos(x)\n\ndef find_tan_googol_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates tan(10^100) and finds the first 3 digits after the decimal point.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.
