# Step 1: Define the two words derived from the clues.
# The word from "CAPES" (sleeveless garments) is "SPACE".
word1 = "SPACE"

# The word from "MENTORS" (trusted guides) is "STORM".
word2 = "STORM"

# Step 2: Combine them to form the final ship name.
ship_name = word1 + word2

# Step 3: Print the result in an equation format as requested.
# The parts of the final name are shown clearly.
