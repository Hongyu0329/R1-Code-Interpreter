# The user is asking for the value of the critical exponent nu (ν) in a
# "G₄-theoretical framework".
# This is interpreted as a standard phi-four (φ⁴) model in d dimensions,
# a fundamental model in the study of critical phenomena.

# The value of nu depends on the spatial dimensionality 'd'.
# For d greater than or equal to the upper critical dimension (d_ucd = 4),
# mean-field theory becomes exact.

# In mean-field theory, the critical exponent nu is given by the precise
# rational number 1/2. We will provide this value.

# Define the numerator and denominator for the mean-field value of nu.
numerator = 1
denominator = 2

# Calculate the value of nu
nu_value = numerator / denominator

# Print the result, showing the full equation as requested.
# This value is exact for a G₄ (φ⁴) theory in d >= 4 spatial dimensions.
