    "My plan to answer this question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the key elements of the question: a specific Christian theologian, a specialized terminology, the concept of changing natural laws, and the two key examples of the virgin birth and the Fall.\n2.  I will research major theologians known for their work on creation, miracles, and natural philosophy, such as Augustine, Aquinas, and others.\n3.  I will pinpoint the theologian who developed a unique conceptual framework and terminology to explain how miracles are not so much a violation of nature, but a manifestation of a deeper potential within it, a framework that could be applied to both the virgin birth and the effects of the Fall.\n4.  This research points to Augustine of Hippo and his concept of *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons or causal principles).\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that prints the name of the theologian and a brief explanation of the concept, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_theology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the user's question about a specific theologian.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The Christian theologian who first developed a specialized terminology for these concepts was Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD).\\n\\n\"\n        \"He used the concept of 'seminal reasons' (Latin: rationes seminales), which he adapted from Stoic philosophy. \"\n        \"Augustine argued that God embedded these hidden potentialities or 'seeds' into creation from the very beginning. The 'laws of nature' represent the normal, predictable unfolding of these seeds.\\n\\n\"\n        \"- The virgin birth was not a violation of nature, but God's direct activation of a unique seminal reason that was always present as a potentiality.\\n\"\n        \"- The changes at the Fall could be understood as a shift in the conditions under which these seminal reasons operate, leading to negative outcomes like mortality and decay, which were latent possibilities released through sin.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"Theologian: {theologian_name}\\n\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_theology_question()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
