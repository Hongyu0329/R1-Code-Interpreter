    # Step 1: Analyze the molecule from its name.
    # The central atom is Copper (Cu).
    # The ligand is 2,5-dithiahexane (CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3).
    # 'bis' indicates there are two of these ligands.
    
    # Step 2: Determine the coordination.
    # The ligand is bidentate, coordinating through its two sulfur atoms.
    # Two bidentate ligands result in a coordination number of 4 for the copper atom.
    
    # Step 3: Determine the geometry.
    # For a d9 metal ion like Copper(II), a 4-coordinate complex is typically square planar.
    # We will assume this common geometry, which places the Cu and four S atoms in a plane.
    
    # Step 4: Analyze the 3D structure and conformers.
    # Each ligand forms a 5-membered chelate ring (Cu-S-C-C-S).
    # Due to the sp3-hybridized carbons, these rings are puckered, not flat.
    # The two puckered rings can be arranged in a "meso" form, where one ring puckers "up"
    # and the other puckers "down" relative to the CuS4 plane.
    
    # Step 5: Identify symmetry elements of the most stable conformer.
    # This "up/down" meso conformer is the most stable because it minimizes steric repulsion.
    # Let's check its symmetry elements:
    # - It does NOT have any proper rotation axes (Cn, n>1).
    # - It does NOT have any mirror planes (sigma).
    # - It DOES have a center of inversion (i) at the position of the Cu atom. Every atom at (x, y, z)
    #   has an identical atom at (-x, -y, -z).
    # The only symmetry elements are the identity (E) and the center of inversion (i).
    
    # Step 6: Conclude the point group.
    # A point group defined by the symmetry elements {E, i} is the Ci point group.
