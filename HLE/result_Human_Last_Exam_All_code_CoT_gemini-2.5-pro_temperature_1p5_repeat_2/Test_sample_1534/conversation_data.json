    "This is a neuroanatomical question rather than a coding task. However, I can fulfill your request by providing the answer within a Python script that prints the information.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the key anatomical structures from your question: \"palliovisceral lobe\" and its \"posterior\" neighbors in the \"dwarf cuttlefish\" (*Sepia bandensis*).\n2.  Consult established neuroanatomical knowledge about cephalopods. The palliovisceral lobe is a major part of the subesophageal mass of the brain, controlling many of the body's organs and the mantle.\n3.  Based on anatomical atlases and descriptions of the cephalopod brain, the structures lying directly behind (posterior to) the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior pedal lobe and the posterior chromatophore lobes.\n4.  I will create a Python script that uses the `print()` function to display this answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides information about the brain regions posterior\n  to the palliovisceral lobe in a dwarf cuttlefish.\n  \"\"\"\n  lobe_in_question = \"palliovisceral lobe\"\n  adjacent_region_1 = \"posterior pedal lobe\"\n  adjacent_region_2 = \"posterior chromatophore lobes\"\n  \n  answer_text = (\n      f\"In the dwarf cuttlefish, the brain regions lying adjacent \"\n      f\"posteriorly to the {lobe_in_question} are the \"\n      f\"{adjacent_region_1} and the {adjacent_region_2}.\"\n  )\n  \n  print(answer_text)\n\nget_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<In the dwarf cuttlefish, the brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior pedal lobe and the posterior chromatophore lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
