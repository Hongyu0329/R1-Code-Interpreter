# The problem statement describes a scenario from the representation theory of
# posets, an advanced field of abstract algebra. A solution cannot be computed
# directly but can be inferred from the properties described.
#
# The key terms are:
# - "tame functor": This implies the representation theory of the poset P is
#   neither finite nor "wild," but has a structured, classifiable infinite
#   set of indecomposable representations.
# - "exact functor f^k": The existence of such a functor from representations
#   of a finite poset I to representations of P is a very strong constraint.
#   It implies that the homological properties of representations of P are
#   controlled by those of I.
# - "discretizes": This suggests that the functor F, despite being part of a
#   potentially continuous family (a hallmark of tameness), can be constructed
#   from the representations of the finite (hence, discrete) poset I.
# - "n-resolvable": This refers to the homological dimension of F.
#
# A central concept in modern representation theory used to study tame algebras
# is the cluster category. For tame hereditary algebras (a major class of tame
# objects), the associated cluster category is a 2-Calabi-Yau category. This
# property means that Ext^1(X, Y) is dual to Ext^1(Y, X), and it imposes
# significant structure on the category. In such a context, homological
# dimensions are often related to the number 2. For an object in a
# 2-Calabi-Yau category, there often exist resolutions of length 2 by other
# important objects.
#
# Given that the setup links a tame functor to a finite (discrete) world via an
# exact functor, it is plausible that this framework forces the situation to
# have homological properties analogous to those found in a 2-Calabi-Yau category.
# This makes n=2 a very likely answer.

# The final equation is n = 2.
# As requested, the following code will output each number in this equation.
# Since the only number is 2, the code simply prints 2.
n = 2
