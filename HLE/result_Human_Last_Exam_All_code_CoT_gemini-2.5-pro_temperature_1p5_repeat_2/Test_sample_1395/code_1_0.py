# Step 1: Analyze the change in planarity to find beta.
# A political map of countries can always be represented as a planar graph, where countries are nodes and shared borders are edges.
# The dissolution of the Soviet Union was a partitioning of one large node into several smaller ones.
# This action refines the map but does not change its fundamental nature as a planar graph.
# Therefore, the planarity of the Asian country graph did not change.
# According to the problem, if planarity does not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The planarity of the graph was unchanged, thus beta = {beta}.")

# Step 2: Analyze the change in the chromatic number to find delta_soviet.
# Before its dissolution, the USSR was a single, highly connected node in the Asian graph, creating significant coloring constraints.
# We assume the complexity of this graph required 4 colors, which is the maximum for any planar graph.
chromatic_number_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number before the dissolution is assumed to be {chromatic_number_before}.")

# After the dissolution, this large, constraining node was broken up, simplifying the overall graph structure.
# The new, simpler graph is assumed to be 3-colorable.
chromatic_number_after = 3
print(f"The chromatic number after the dissolution is assumed to be {chromatic_number_after}.")

# The incremental change is the 'after' value minus the 'before' value.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The change in chromatic number (delta_soviet) is {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before}, which equals {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 3: Calculate the final answer.
# The final answer is the product of beta and delta_soviet.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final result is {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
