    "To find the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the number of embeddings**: An isometric embedding is a distance-preserving map $f: X \\to B$. If a Banach space $B$ is the target, its metric is translation-invariant. This means that if a single isometric embedding $f$ exists, we can create a whole family of embeddings $f_v(x) = f(x) + v$ for any vector $v \\in B$. The number of such embeddings would be equal to the number of vectors in $B$, which is its cardinality $K$. Therefore, the number of isometric embeddings is either 0 (if no such mapping exists) or at least $K$.\n\n2.  **Minimize the number**: To find the smallest *possible* number, we are allowed to choose the space $X$ and the space $B$ (of cardinality $K$). The smallest possible value for a non-negative count is 0. So, the question is equivalent to asking: \"Can we find a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ such that there are zero isometric embeddings between them?\"\n\n3.  **Construct a counterexample**: I will demonstrate that the number of embeddings can indeed be 0. To do this, I need to pick a specific $X$ and a specific $B$ for which an isometric embedding is impossible.\n    *   For the **finite ultrametric space $X$**, I will choose a simple but illustrative example: a 3-point space where all points are equidistant, forming an equilateral triangle. Let $X = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3\\}$ with the distances $d(p_1, p_2) = d(p_2, p_3) = d(p_1, p_3) = 1$. This space is ultrametric because the strong triangle inequality $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ is satisfied (i.e., $1 \\le \\max(1, 1)$).\n    *   For the **Banach space $B$**, I will choose the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard absolute value as the norm, i.e., $B = (\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|)$. This is a complete normed vector space, so it is a Banach space.\n\n4.  **Show the impossibility**: I will show that it is impossible to find three points in $\\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the distance conditions required by the isometric embedding. This contradiction proves that no such embedding exists. The python code below will programmatically lay out this argument. It will set up the problem and then demonstrate the contradiction that arises from the properties of distances in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n```python\n# The goal is to find the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings\n# of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.\n# This number is either 0 or K (the cardinality of B), assuming K > 0.\n# We find the minimum by checking if it's possible for the number to be 0.\n\n# We will construct a counterexample.\n# Let's choose a specific finite ultrametric space X and a Banach space B.\n\n# Let X be a 3-point space {p1, p2, p3} with all pairwise distances equal to 1.\n# d(p1, p2) = 1\n# d(p2, p3) = 1\n# d(p1, p3) = 1\n# This is an ultrametric space since for any three points, d(x,z) <= max(d(x,y), d(y,z)),\n# which means 1 <= max(1, 1), which is true.\n\n# Let B be the Banach space of real numbers (R) with the absolute value as the norm.\n\n# An isometric embedding f: X -> B would require finding three points\n# a, b, c in R such that the distances between them match the distances in X.\ndist_ab = 1\ndist_bc = 1\ndist_ac = 1\n\nprint(\"Chosen finite ultrametric space X: A 3-point space with all pairwise distances equal to 1.\")\nprint(\"Chosen Banach space B: The real numbers R with the standard absolute value norm.\")\nprint(\"\\nAn isometric embedding would require finding three points a, b, c in R such that:\")\nprint(f\"|a - b| = {dist_ab}\")\nprint(f\"|b - c| = {dist_bc}\")\nprint(f\"|a - c| = {dist_ac}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nLet's analyze the implications of these conditions in the space R.\")\n# In R, for any three points a, b, c, the triangle inequality holds: |a - c| <= |a - b| + |b - c|.\n# A crucial property of distances on the real line is that for any three points,\n# one must lie between the other two (or they are collinear).\n# Let's assume without loss of generality that the points are ordered as a <= b <= c.\n# If such points existed, then:\n# |a - b| would be b - a.\n# |b - c| would be c - b.\n# |a - c| would be c - a.\n#\n# The relationship between these distances is fixed: c - a = (b - a) + (c - b).\n# This means the distances must satisfy the equation:\n# |a - c| = |a - b| + |b - c|\n\n# Now, we check if our required distances can satisfy this necessary equation.\nprint(\"A necessary condition for three points on the real line is that the largest distance is the sum of the other two.\")\nprint(\"In our case, all distances must be equal, so let's check the required equality:\")\n\nrequired_dist_ac = dist_ac\ncalculated_sum = dist_ab + dist_bc\n\n# The final equation reveals the contradiction.\n# We output each number in this final equation as requested.\nprint(f\"The equation that must be satisfied is: {required_dist_ac} = {dist_ab} + {dist_bc}\")\nprint(f\"Plugging in the values: {required_dist_ac} = {calculated_sum}\")\n\nis_possible = (required_dist_ac == calculated_sum)\nprint(f\"Is this equation true? {is_possible}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe equation 1 = 2 is false.
