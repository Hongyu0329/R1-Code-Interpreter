# The goal is to find the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings
# of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.
# This number is either 0 or K (the cardinality of B), assuming K > 0.
# We find the minimum by checking if it's possible for the number to be 0.

# We will construct a counterexample.
# Let's choose a specific finite ultrametric space X and a Banach space B.

# Let X be a 3-point space {p1, p2, p3} with all pairwise distances equal to 1.
# d(p1, p2) = 1
# d(p2, p3) = 1
# d(p1, p3) = 1
# This is an ultrametric space since for any three points, d(x,z) <= max(d(x,y), d(y,z)),
# which means 1 <= max(1, 1), which is true.

# Let B be the Banach space of real numbers (R) with the absolute value as the norm.

# An isometric embedding f: X -> B would require finding three points
# a, b, c in R such that the distances between them match the distances in X.
dist_ab = 1
dist_bc = 1
dist_ac = 1

print("\nLet's analyze the implications of these conditions in the space R.")
# In R, for any three points a, b, c, the triangle inequality holds: |a - c| <= |a - b| + |b - c|.
# A crucial property of distances on the real line is that for any three points,
# one must lie between the other two (or they are collinear).
# Let's assume without loss of generality that the points are ordered as a <= b <= c.
# If such points existed, then:
# |a - b| would be b - a.
# |b - c| would be c - b.
# |a - c| would be c - a.
#
# The relationship between these distances is fixed: c - a = (b - a) + (c - b).
# This means the distances must satisfy the equation:
# |a - c| = |a - b| + |b - c|

# Now, we check if our required distances can satisfy this necessary equation.
print("A necessary condition for three points on the real line is that the largest distance is the sum of the other two.")

# The final equation reveals the contradiction.
# We output each number in this final equation as requested.

print("\nThe equation 1 = 2 is false. This is a contradiction.")
print("This contradiction proves that no three points in R can satisfy the required distance conditions.")
print("Therefore, no isometric embedding of our chosen X into our chosen B exists.")
print("The number of such embeddings is 0.")

# Since we have found a valid case where the number of embeddings is 0,
# and the number cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.
