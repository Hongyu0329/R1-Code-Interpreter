    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph Structure**: First, we need to understand what a \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" means. This graph is constructed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge, known as the \"bottleneck\" or \"bridge\". For a total of 10 nodes, the most symmetric configuration is two 5-node cliques.\n2.  **Count the Edges**: Next, we'll calculate the total number of edges in this graph.\n    *   A complete graph with `m` nodes has `m * (m - 1) / 2` edges. We'll use this formula for our 5-node cliques.\n    *   The total number of edges in the barbell graph is the sum of edges in both cliques plus the one bottleneck edge connecting them.\n3.  **Calculate the Probability**: Randomized uniform gossiping means that at each step, an edge is chosen uniformly at random from the set of all edges. Therefore, the probability of selecting the specific bottleneck edge is `1 / (Total Number of Edges)`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_barbell_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph.\n\n    The problem considers a barbell graph with 10 nodes and uniform weights.\n    This graph is formed by two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each,\n    connected by a single 'bottleneck' edge.\n\n    In randomized uniform gossiping, an edge is selected uniformly at random.\n    The probability of picking the bottleneck edge is therefore\n    1 divided by the total number of edges in the graph.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
