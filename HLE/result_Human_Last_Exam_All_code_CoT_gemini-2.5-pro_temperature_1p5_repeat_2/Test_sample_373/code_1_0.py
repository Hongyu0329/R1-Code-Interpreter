    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph.

    The problem considers a barbell graph with 10 nodes and uniform weights.
    This graph is formed by two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each,
    connected by a single 'bottleneck' edge.

    In randomized uniform gossiping, an edge is selected uniformly at random.
    The probability of picking the bottleneck edge is therefore
    1 divided by the total number of edges in the graph.
