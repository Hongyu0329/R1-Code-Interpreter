# Step 1: Solve the first equation for the first coordinates of X1.
# Equation is A1 * X1^2 + X1^2 * B1 = C1
# Because A1, B1, C1 are diagonal, X1^2 must be diagonal. Let's call it Y1.
# The (1,1) element of Y1, denoted y11, can be calculated from the (1,1) elements of the coefficient matrices.
a1_11 = 5
b1_11 = 6
c1_11 = -53/12
# a1_11 * y11 + y11 * b1_11 = c1_11
y11 = c1_11 / (a1_11 + b1_11)

# Now, find the first coordinate of X1, let's call it x1_11.
# Since X1^2 is diagonal with distinct eigenvalues, X1 must also be diagonal.
# So, (x1_11)^2 = y11.
# The solutions are the positive and negative square roots.
x1_coord_1 = np.sqrt(complex(y11))
x1_coord_2 = -np.sqrt(complex(y11))

# Step 2: Solve the second equation for the first coordinates of X2.
# Equation is A2 * X2^2 + X2^2 * B2 = C2
a2_11 = 4
b2_11 = 6
c2_11 = -3/11
# a2_11 * y22 + y22 * b2_11 = c2_11
y22 = c2_11 / (a2_11 + b2_11)

# Find the first coordinate of X2, let's call it x2_11.
# (x2_11)^2 = y22.
x2_coord_1 = np.sqrt(complex(y22))
x2_coord_2 = -np.sqrt(complex(y22))

# Step 3: Sum the first coordinates of all solutions.
# The set of solutions for the first coordinate of X1 is {x1_coord_1, x1_coord_2}.
# The set of solutions for the first coordinate of X2 is {x2_coord_1, x2_coord_2}.
# The question asks for the sum of the first coordinate of solutions.
# We sum the first coordinates of all possible solution matrices.
total_sum = x1_coord_1 + x1_coord_2 + x2_coord_1 + x2_coord_2

# Step 4: Output the result, showing each number in the final equation.
# We use .real for the final sum because 0j is mathematically equivalent to 0.
print("The sum of the first coordinates of all possible solution matrices is:")
print(f"({x1_coord_1}) + ({x1_coord_2}) + ({x2_coord_1}) + ({x2_coord_2}) = {total_sum.real}")
