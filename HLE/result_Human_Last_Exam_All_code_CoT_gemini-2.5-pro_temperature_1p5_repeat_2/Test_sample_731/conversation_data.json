    "A \"power subgroup\" of a group is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element. This is the definition of a **cyclic subgroup**. So, the task is to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. Its order is $2^n=512$, which means $n=9$. The group is defined by the presentation $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$. For $n=9$, this is $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Categorize Elements:** The elements of this group can be divided into three types based on the cyclic subgroups they generate:\n    *   **Type 1:** Elements within the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$, which has order $2^{n-1} = 256$.\n    *   **Type 2:** Elements of the form $sr^i$ where the index $i$ is even.\n    *   **Type 3:** Elements of the form $sr^i$ where the index $i$ is odd.\n\n3.  **Count Subgroups in Each Category:**\n    *   **Type 1:** The number of subgroups in a cyclic group of order $m$ is equal to the number of divisors of $m$. The group $\\langle r \\rangle$ has order $2^{n-1}$, which has $n$ divisors ($2^0, 2^1, \\dots, 2^{n-1}$). So, there are $n$ distinct cyclic subgroups within $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n    *   **Type 2:** It can be shown that elements $sr^i$ with an even $i$ all have order 2. There are $2^{n-1}/2 = 2^{n-2}$ such elements, and each generates a unique subgroup of order 2.\n    *   **Type 3:** Elements $sr^i$ with an odd $i$ all have order 4. There are $2^{n-2}$ such elements. Since every cyclic group of order 4 has two generators, these elements form $2^{n-2}/2 = 2^{n-3}$ distinct subgroups of order 4.\n\n4.  **Sum the Counts:** The total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of the counts from these three disjoint categories. The formula is: Total = $n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate for n=9:**\n    *   Number from Type 1: $n = 9$\n    *   Number from Type 2: $2^{9-2} = 2^7 = 128$\n    *   Number from Type 3: $2^{9-3} = 2^6 = 64$\n    *   Total = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups)\n    in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 512\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_2^n, the order is 2^n.\n    # We find n = log2(group_order).\n    if group_order <= 0 or (group_order & (group_order - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Group order must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n    \n    # A \"power subgroup\" is another name for a cyclic subgroup.\n    # The number of cyclic subgroups in SD_{2^n} is given by the formula:\n    # n + 2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3)\n\n    # 1.

There are 2^(n-3) such subgroups.\n    count_from_sr_odd = 2**(n - 3)\n\n    # The total is the sum of these three counts.\n    total_subgroups = count_from_r + count_from_sr_even + count_from_sr_odd\n\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_order} is SD_{{2^{n}}}, so n={n}.\")\n    print(\"The total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is the sum of:\")\n    print(f\" - Subgroups from the cyclic part <r>: {count_from_r}\")\n    print(f\" - Subgroups from elements sr^i (i is even): {count_from_sr_even}\")\n    print(f\" - Subgroups from elements sr^i (i is odd): {count_from_sr_odd}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{count_from_r} + {count_from_sr_even} + {count_from_sr_odd} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<201>>>\n```"
