    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this chess puzzle:\n\n1.  First, I'll determine the total number of squares on the edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n2.  Next, I'll figure out the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these edge squares without any of them attacking each other. This is achieved by placing them all on squares of the same color.\n3.  Finally, I'll subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares to find out how many edge squares are empty.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares on a chessboard after placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.\n    \"\"\"\n    # An 8x8 board has 28 edge squares (8 on top + 8 on bottom + 6 on left + 6 on right).\n    total_edge_squares = 28\n\n    # To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, you must place them\n    # on squares of the same color. The edge squares are evenly split between\n    # white and black.\n    # So, we can place a bishop on every white edge square, or every black one.\n    max_bishops_on_edge = total_edge_squares / 2\n    \n    # The number of empty squares is the total minus the placed bishops.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops_on_edge\n\n    print(f\"A standard 8x8 chessboard has {total_edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge is {int(max_bishops_on_edge)}.\")\n    print(\"This leaves the other squares empty.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of edge squares that would lack bishops is:\")\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} - {int(max_bishops_on_edge)} = {int(empty_edge_squares)}\")\n\nsolve_bishops_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
