    Identifies the inappropriate implementations based on Domain-Driven Design principles.
    
    A. Describe all the order processing logic in the Controller.
    - This is an Anemic Domain Model anti-pattern. Logic should be in the domain layer, not the application/controller layer. This is inappropriate.

    B. Put all the order processing logic in the Order class.
    - This creates a "God Object" anti-pattern. Responsibilities like customer discount calculation and book inventory management do not belong to the Order class. This is inappropriate.

    C. Put the discount rate calculation logic in the Customer class, the inventory check logic in the Book class, and the order confirmation logic in the Order class.
    - This represents a proper Rich Domain Model, where logic is placed with the data it operates on. This is a correct implementation.

    D. Describe the order processing logic in a domain service such as OrderService.
    - If ALL logic is in a service, this results in an Anemic Domain Model where entities are just data bags. This is inappropriate.

    E. Order processing logic is divided and described in the Order class and domain services such as OrderService.
    - This is a valid and often practical approach. Entity-specific logic is in the entity, and logic that coordinates multiple entities is in a domain service. This is a correct implementation.
