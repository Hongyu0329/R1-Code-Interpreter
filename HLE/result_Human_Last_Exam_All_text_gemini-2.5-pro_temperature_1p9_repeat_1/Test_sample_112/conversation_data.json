    "To answer the question of which book of manners was preserved alongside *Sir Launfal*, we must identify the specific manuscript containing the poem and then examine its other contents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct \"Sir Launfal\"**: The question refers to the Middle English romance poem *Sir Launfal*, written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century. It should not be confused with the 19th-century poem \"The Vision of Sir Launfal\" by James Russell Lowell, which would not be found in a medieval manuscript.\n\n2.  **Identify the Manuscript**: Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal* survives in only one manuscript. This unique source is **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, a famous collection of Middle English texts held in the British Library.\n\n3.  **Examine the Manuscript's Contents**: The Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is a miscellany, meaning it is a collection of different, unrelated works bound together. It contains several important Middle English romances, such as *Emar√©*, *Sir Isumbras*, and *Sir Gowther*, in addition to *Sir Launfal*.\n\n4.  **Locate the \"Book of Manners\"**: Within this same collection (Cotton Caligula A.ii), there is a text that is a prime example of a medieval \"book of manners\" or \"courtesy book.\" These books were guides to etiquette, social conduct, and household management for the aristocracy. The specific text in this manuscript is titled **_The Boke of Curtasye_** (The Book of Courtesy). This poem outlines proper behavior, particularly table manners, and details the specific duties of servants within a great lord's household.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since both Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal* and *The Boke of Curtasye* are contained within the single manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii, *The Boke of Curtasye* is the book of manners that was preserved alongside *Sir Launfal*.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Poem Specificity**: It is crucial to distinguish between the medieval *Sir Launfal* and the much later poem by Lowell. The context of a medieval \"book of manners\" confirms we are dealing with the former.\n*   **Manuscript Uniqueness**: The fact that the poem exists in only one manuscript makes the answer definitive. The contents of that specific manuscript, Cotton Caligula A.ii, provide the complete answer.\n*   **Genre Definition**: Understanding what constitutes a \"book of manners\" (also called a courtesy book) in a medieval context is key to identifying the correct text from the manuscript's table of contents.\n*   **Spelling Variation**: Medieval texts have variant spellings. The book is known as _The Boke of Curtasye_, _The Book of Courtesy_, or _The Book of Curtesye_. All refer to the same work.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
