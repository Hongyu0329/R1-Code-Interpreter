    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks us to analyze the autonomous differential equation $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$. First, we need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, which is denoted by $m$. Then, we need to compute the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n**2. Find the Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points are the constant solutions to the differential equation. They are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n*   **Set the derivative to zero:**\n    $-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\n\n*   **Factor the polynomial:**\n    We can factor out a $-x$ from each term:\n    $-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\n*   **Recognize the perfect square:**\n    The quadratic term $x^2 - 2x + 1$ is a perfect square, equal to $(x-1)^2$.\n    So the equation becomes:\n    $-x(x-1)^2 = 0$\n\n*   **Solve for x:**\n    The solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor zero:\n    *   $-x = 0 \\implies x = 0$\n    *   $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n\n    Thus, the equilibrium points are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\n**3. Determine the Stability of Each Equilibrium Point**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ around $x^*$, or by using the derivative of $f(x)$. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if solutions starting near $x^*$ tend toward $x^*$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\n**Method 1: The First Derivative Test**\nWe compute the derivative of $f(x)$, which is $f'(x)$.\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nThe stability rules are:\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point $x^*$ is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive.\n\n*   **Stability of x = 0:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **Stability of x = 1:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, this test is inconclusive. We must use another method for this point.\n\n**Method 2: Analysis of the Sign of f(x) (Phase Line Analysis)**\nWe analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the intervals around the equilibrium points.\n\n*   **For $x < 0$ (e.g., $x=-1$):**\n    $f(-1) = -(-1)(-1-1)^2 = 1(-2)^2 = 4 > 0$.\n    Since $f(x)>0$, $x(t)$ is increasing. Solutions move towards $x=0$.\n\n*   **For $0 < x < 1$ (e.g., $x=0.5$):**\n    $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.125 < 0$.\n    Since $f(x)<0$, $x(t)$ is decreasing. Solutions move towards $x=0$ and away from $x=1$.\n\n*   **For $x > 1$ (e.g., $x=2$):**\n    $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2 < 0$.\n    Since $f(x)<0$, $x(t)$ is decreasing. Solutions move towards $x=1$.\n\n**Summary of Stability:**\n*   For the equilibrium point $x=0$: Solutions from both the left ($x<0$) and the right ($0<x<1$) move towards $x=0$. Therefore, $x=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium point.\n*   For the equilibrium point $x=1$: Solutions from the right ($x>1$) move towards $x=1$, but solutions from the left ($0<x<1$) move away from $x=1$. This type of point is called **semi-stable**. In the context of stability, semi-stable points are not considered stable because they do not attract all nearby solutions. Therefore, $x=1$ is an unstable equilibrium point.\n\n**4. Determine the value of m**\nThe variable $m$ is defined as the number of stable equilibrium points. Based on our analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nTherefore, $m=1$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Expression**\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThis is the final result.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
