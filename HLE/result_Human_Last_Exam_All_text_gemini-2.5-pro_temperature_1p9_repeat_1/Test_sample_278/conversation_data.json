    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Parametric Curve:**\n    The curve is defined piecewise based on the parameter `t`. We need to analyze each piece separately.\n\n    *   **Case 1: `t` is in the interval `[0, π]`**\n        In this interval, `b = 1`. The parametric equations are:\n        $x = \\cos t$\n        $y = \\sin t$\n        These are the standard parametric equations for a unit circle. Since `t` ranges from 0 to $\\pi$, `sin(t)` is always non-negative ($y \\ge 0$). This traces the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin, starting from point (1, 0), going through (0, 1), and ending at (-1, 0).\n        -   The x-values range from -1 to 1.\n        -   The y-values range from 0 to 1.\n\n    *   **Case 2: `t` is in the interval `(π, 2π)`**\n        In this interval, `b = 5`. The parametric equations are:\n        $x = \\cos t$\n        $y = 5 \\sin t$\n        From these equations, we can derive the Cartesian equation: $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of length 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of length 5 along the y-axis.\n        Since `t` ranges from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, `sin(t)` is always non-positive ($y \\le 0$). This traces the lower half of the ellipse, starting from (-1, 0), going through (0, -5), and ending at (1, 0).\n        -   The x-values range from -1 to 1.\n        -   The y-values range from -5 to 0.\n\n2.  **Determine the Bounding Box of the Entire Figure:**\n    To find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the entire shape. This gives us the dimensions of the smallest enclosing rectangle (the bounding box).\n\n    *   **X-range:** Combining both cases, the x-values range from the minimum of -1 to the maximum of 1.\n        -   $x_{min} = -1$\n        -   $x_{max} = 1$\n        -   The width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n    *   **Y-range:** Combining both cases:\n        -   From the first part (semi-circle), the maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n        -   From the second part (semi-ellipse), the minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\n        -   The overall y-values range from -5 to 1.\n        -   The height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Enclosing Square:**\n    The figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. A square that encloses this figure must have a side length that is at least as large as the larger of these two dimensions.\n    *   Side length of the square, `s` = `max(width, height)`.\n    *   `s` = `max(2, 6) = 6`.\n    So, the smallest square that can outcircle (enclose) the figure has a side length of 6.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Area of the Square:**\n    The area of a square is given by the formula `Area = side * side = s^2`.\n    *   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   Pay close attention to the piecewise definition of the parameter `b`. The shape of the curve changes based on the interval of `t`.\n*   Recognize the standard parametric forms for a circle ($x=r\\cos t, y=r\\sin t$) and an ellipse ($x=a\\cos t, y=b\\sin t$).\n*   Correctly determine the range of x and y for each segment of the curve by considering the range of `t`.\n*   The side length of the smallest enclosing square is determined by the *maximum* dimension (either width or height) of the figure's bounding box.\n*   The term \"outcircles\" in this context means \"encloses\" or \"circumscribes\".\n\n<<<36>>>"
