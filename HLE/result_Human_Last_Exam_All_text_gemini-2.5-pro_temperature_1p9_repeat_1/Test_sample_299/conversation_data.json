    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of such functions. We want to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the fundamental properties of `f`**\n\nFirst, we deduce some basic properties that any function $f \\in S$ must have.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. Using the given equation, this implies $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function $g(x)=e^x$ is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** The function $f$ is given as continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. A continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. We analyze these two cases separately.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n1.  **Range of `f`:** A strictly decreasing continuous function defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$ must be a bijection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. This means its range (or image) is the entire set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$.\n2.  **Range of the composition `f(f(x))`:** The range of the composite function $f(f(x))$ is the image of the range of the inner function $f$ under the outer function $f$.\n    *   Range of inner $f$: $\\text{range}(f) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   Range of $f(f(x))$ is $f(\\text{range}(f)) = f(\\mathbb{R})$.\n    *   Since the range of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$, the range of the composition $f(f(x))$ is also $\\mathbb{R}$.\n3.  **Contradiction:** The original equation is $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n    *   The range of the left-hand side, $f(f(x))$, is $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   The range of the right-hand side, $e^x$, is the set of positive real numbers, $(0, \\infty)$.\n    *   Equating the ranges leads to $\\mathbb{R} = (0, \\infty)$, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions that satisfy the given equation. The set of decreasing solutions is empty.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly increasing**\n\nNow, let's assume $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n1.  **Fixed Points:** A fixed point of $f$ is a value $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. If such a point exists, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This would mean $e^{x_0} = x_0$. The function $h(x) = e^x - x$ has derivative $h'(x) = e^x - 1$, which is zero only at $x=0$. The minimum value is $h(0) = e^0 - 0 = 1$. Since $h(x) \\ge 1$ for all $x$, there is no real solution to $e^x = x$. Thus, $f$ has no fixed points.\n\n2.  **Behavior relative to y=x:** Since $f$ is continuous and has no fixed points, its graph must lie entirely above or entirely below the line $y=x$. That is, either $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, or $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then since $f$ is increasing, applying $f$ to both sides yields $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining the inequalities, we get $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would mean $e^x < x$, which we already know is false for all real $x$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n3.  **Construction of Solutions:** We can construct solutions by defining $f$ on a specific interval and then extending the definition to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the functional equation.\n    *   Let $f(0) = c$. Since $f(x)>x$, we have $c=f(0)>0$.\n    *   From the original equation, $f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$. Substituting $f(0)=c$, we get $f(c)=1$.\n    *   Since $f$ is strictly increasing and $c>0$, we have $f(c)>f(0)$, which implies $1>c$. So, the constant $c$ must be in the interval $(0, 1)$.\n    *   Now, let's consider the equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$. This implies $f$ commutes with $e^x$:\n        $f(e^x) = f(f(f(x))) = e^{f(x)}$. So $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$.\n    *   Let $a$ be such that $f(a)=0$. Then $f(0)=f(f(a)) = e^a$. So, $c=e^a$, which gives $a=\\ln c$. Since $c \\in (0,1)$, $a = \\ln c$ is negative, which is consistent with $f(a)=0$ and $f(0)=c>0$ for an increasing function.\n    *   This gives us a sequence of points on the graph of $f$: $(\\ln c, 0), (0, c), (c, 1), (1, e^c), \\dots$\n    *   The function $f$ is fully determined if we define it on any interval $[x_0, f(x_0)]$. Let's define $f$ on the interval $[\\ln c, 0]$. Let $\\phi(x)$ be the restriction of $f$ to this interval.\n    *   $\\phi: [\\ln c, 0] \\to [0, c]$ must be a strictly increasing, continuous function, satisfying the boundary conditions $\\phi(\\ln c) = 0$, $\\phi(0) = c$, and the condition $\\phi(x) > x$ for all $x \\in [\\ln c, 0]$.\n    *   Any such choice of $\\phi$ uniquely determines the function $f$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}$. For instance, for any $y \\in [0,c]$, $f(y)$ must equal $e^{\\phi^{-1}(y)}$. This process can be continued to cover all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n4.  **Counting the Solutions:** The number of solutions is the number of possible valid choices we can make during the construction.\n    *   First, we can choose the constant $c$ to be any real number in $(0, 1)$. There is a continuum of choices for $c$, so there are $|\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathfrak{c}$ choices.\n    *   For a fixed $c$ (e.g., $c=1/e$), we need to choose a valid function $\\phi: [\\ln c, 0] \\to [0, c]$. There is also a continuum of choices for such a function. To see this, pick any point $x_0 \\in (\\ln c, 0)$. Let $y_0 = \\phi(x_0)$. The only constraints on $y_0$ are that $y_0 > x_0$ and $\\phi$ is increasing, i.e., $\\phi(\\ln c) < y_0 < \\phi(0)$, which means $0 < y_0 < c$. For any such choice of $y_0$, we can construct a valid $\\phi$ (e.g., by using two line segments). Since there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $y_0$, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for the function $\\phi$.\n    *   The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for $c$ and the number of choices for $\\phi$ for each $c$. This gives $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$ increasing solutions.\n\n**Step 4: Final Cardinality**\n\nThe set of all solutions $S$ is the union of the set of increasing solutions ($S_{inc}$) and the set of decreasing solutions ($S_{dec}$).\n*   We found $|S_{dec}| = 0$.\n*   We found $|S_{inc}| \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   The total number of continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$. Since $S$ is a subset of these functions, $|S| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   Combining these, we have $\\mathfrak{c} \\le |S| = |S_{inc}| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThis implies that the cardinality of the set is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum (the \"size\" of the set of real numbers).\n\nFinal Answer: The cardinality of the set is $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$."
