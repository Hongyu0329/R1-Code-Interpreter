    "Step by step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific count: \"How many times did Chekov describe the coat?\" in his short story \"The Chameleon.\" The preface to the question establishes the context: the descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat are symbolic of his \"fearful mentality and its shifts.\" This context is keyâ€”it tells us to look for the instances where the coat is mentioned as part of a symbolic action, not just a simple word count.\n\n2.  **Initial Scan of the Story's Plot:** The story follows Police Superintendent Otchumyelov as he investigates a dog bite. His judgment changes repeatedly based on who he believes owns the dog. The coat is a physical object he interacts with that reflects these internal changes. He takes it off when he's \"hot\" (flustered by a superior's potential involvement) and puts it on when he feels \"cold\" (reasserting his authority when he thinks the dog has no important owner).\n\n3.  **Careful Point 1: What Constitutes a \"Description\"?** In this literary context, a \"description\" refers to each distinct action or state involving the coat that Chekhov uses to reflect a shift in Otchumyelov's character. This includes his initial state, the actions of taking it off and putting it on, and his final action with it.\n\n4.  **Chronological Tally of the Descriptions:**\n\n    *   **Description 1:** The Initial State. Otchumyelov is first introduced walking across the market square \"in a new greatcoat.\" This establishes the coat as a symbol of his authority before the conflict begins.\n    *   **Description 2:** The First Shift. Upon hearing the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov feels hot and orders his subordinate, Yeldyrin, to take his coat off. This is the first symbolic act of him shedding his authority in fear.\n    *   **Description 3:** The Second Shift. When he is told the dog is *not* the General's, Otchumyelov feels a \"chill\" and regains his confidence. He orders Yeldyrin to put his coat back on, symbolically reassuming his authority.\n    *   **Description 4:** The Third Shift. Another person in the crowd insists the dog *is* the General's, throwing Otchumyelov back into a panic. He complains of the heat again and has his coat taken off for a second time.\n    *   **Description 5:** The Final Action. After learning the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother, Otchumyelov's demeanor changes to fawning respect. As he leaves the scene, he is described as \"wrapping his greatcoat about him.\" This final description shows him retreating back into his official persona, the social order now clear to him.\n\n5.  **Final Count and Verification:** Each of these five instances represents a distinct point in the narrative where Chekhov uses the coat to visually manifest Otchumyelov's vacillating mentality. The count is not about the number of times the word \"coat\" is written (which is six), but the number of symbolic actions or states described.\n\nFinal Answer: By tracking each symbolic event involving the coat from the beginning of the story to the end, we can identify five distinct times that Chekhov describes it to mirror Otchumyelov's psychological shifts.\n\n<<<5>>>"
