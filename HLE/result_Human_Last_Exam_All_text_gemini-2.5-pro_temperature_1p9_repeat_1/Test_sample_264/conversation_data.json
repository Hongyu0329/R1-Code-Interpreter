    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Coordinate System and the First Cube\nLet's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a standard 3D Cartesian coordinate system. We can define its boundaries by placing one vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) and aligning its edges with the x, y, and z axes. Since the side length is 1, Cube A occupies the region defined by:\n*   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Translation (The Shift)\nThe second cube, Cube B, is shifted relative to Cube A. The description of the shift is \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identifying the Main Diagonal.** For the cube we've defined, the \"main diagonal\" connects the vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is `d = (1, 1, 1)`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Interpreting the Shift Vector.** The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is the most crucial part of the problem. There are two common interpretations:\n    1.  The magnitude (distance) of the shift is 1/2. The shift vector would have a length of 1/2 and be in the direction of (1, 1, 1). This would result in a shift vector of `(1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3))`.\n    2.  The shift is composed of a movement of 1/2 unit along each coordinate axis, corresponding to the components of the diagonal vector. The shift vector is `S = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n\n    For geometry puzzles of this nature, the second interpretation is far more common and leads to a cleaner, more elegant solution. It also corresponds to a very specific geometric arrangement: the corner of the shifted cube is placed at the center of the original cube. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Define the Position of the Second Cube\nWith the shift vector `S = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`, we can find the coordinates for Cube B by adding this vector to the coordinates of Cube A.\nCube B occupies the region defined by:\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Region of Intersection\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the geometric shape that lies within *both* Cube A and Cube B. To find this region, we find the intersection of the coordinate ranges for both cubes.\n\n*   **x-coordinate:** The overlapping range for `x` is the intersection of `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]`, which is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **y-coordinate:** The overlapping range for `y` is the intersection of `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]`, which is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **z-coordinate:** The overlapping range for `z` is the intersection of `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]`, which is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\nThe resulting intersection is a new rectangular prism (specifically, a cube) defined by:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection\nThe shape of the intersection is a cube. We can find its side length by calculating the length of each range found in Step 4.\n\n*   Side length in x-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in y-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in z-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume of this smaller cube is the product of its side lengths:\nVolume = (Side Length)³ = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2)` = `1/8`.\n\nThe volume of the intersection is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
