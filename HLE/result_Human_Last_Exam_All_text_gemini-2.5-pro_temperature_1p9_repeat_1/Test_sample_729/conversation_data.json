    "Answering the question: \"How many power subgroups are there in the generalized quaternion group of size 128?\"\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, has the presentation:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor our question, the size is 128. So, $4n = 128$, which implies $n = 32$.\nThe group is $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Elements:** The group has 128 elements, which can be written in the form $x^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$ and $yx^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$.\n*   **Subgroup structure:** There is a unique cyclic subgroup of order 64, which is $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n### **Step 2: Define \"Power Subgroup\"**\n\nA \"power subgroup\" of a group $G$ is a subgroup of the form $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** For a general group, the set $G^k$ is not always a subgroup because it might not be closed under the group operation. However, for a special class of groups called nilpotent groups, $G^k$ is always a normal subgroup of $G$.\n*   **$Q_{128}$ is a p-group:** Since the order of $Q_{128}$ is $128 = 2^7$, it is a 2-group (a p-group with p=2). All p-groups are nilpotent.\n*   **Conclusion:** For $G = Q_{128}$, the set $G^k$ is a subgroup for any integer $k$. Our task is to find how many *distinct* such subgroups exist.\n\n### **Step 3: Relate Power Subgroups to the Group Exponent**\n\nThe set of distinct power subgroups is related to the exponent of the group. The exponent of a group $G$, denoted $\\exp(G)$, is the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $g^m = 1$ for all $g \\in G$.\n\n*   It can be shown that for any integer $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is identical to the subgroup $G^d$, where $d = \\gcd(k, \\exp(G))$.\n*   Therefore, the set of all distinct power subgroups is $\\{G^d \\mid d \\text{ is a positive divisor of } \\exp(G)\\}$.\n*   The problem is now reduced to finding the exponent of $Q_{128}$ and counting its divisors.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Exponent of Q_128**\n\nThe exponent is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of all elements in the group.\n\n*   **Order of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$:** The element $x$ has order 64. The orders of elements $x^i$ are divisors of 64.\n*   **Order of elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$:** Let's find the order of an element of the form $yx^i$.\n    *   $(yx^i)^2 = yx^i yx^i = y(x^i y)x^i = y(y x^{-i})x^i = y^2 x^{-i}x^i = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    *   Since $(yx^i)^2 = x^{32}$ (which is not the identity), the order is greater than 2.\n    *   $(yx^i)^4 = ((yx^i)^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n    *   So, every element of the form $yx^i$ has order 4.\n*   The set of all possible orders of elements in $Q_{128}$ is $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n*   The exponent is the maximum of these orders, which is 64. So, $\\exp(Q_{128}) = 64$.\n\n### **Step 5: Count the Number of Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nThe number of distinct power subgroups is equal to the number of positive divisors of the exponent, which is 64.\n\n*   The prime factorization of 64 is $2^6$.\n*   The divisors are of the form $2^j$ where $j$ can be $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.\n*   The divisors are: $2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64$.\n*   There are $6+1=7$ divisors.\n\nEach of these divisors will correspond to a distinct power subgroup. To be certain, we can list them:\n1.  $d=1$: $G^1 = Q_{128}$ (order 128)\n2.  $d=2$: $G^2 = \\{g^2 \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n3.  $d=4$: $G^4 = \\{g^4 \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n4.  $d=8$: $G^8 = \\{g^8 \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n5.  $d=16$: $G^{16} = \\{g^{16} \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n6.  $d=32$: $G^{32} = \\{g^{32} \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle = Z(G)$ (order 2)\n7.  $d=64$: $G^{64} = \\{g^{64} \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\nSince all these subgroups have different orders, they are all distinct.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 is equal to the number of divisors of its exponent (64). The number of divisors of 64 is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
