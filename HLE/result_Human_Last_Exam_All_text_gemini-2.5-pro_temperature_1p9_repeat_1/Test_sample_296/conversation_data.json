    "An analysis of the question about the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is performed step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Connection between Subgroups and Homomorphisms**\n    A fundamental result in group theory states that there is a correspondence between subgroups of index `n` in a group `G` and transitive group actions of `G` on a set of `n` elements. Each such action is defined by a homomorphism `φ: G → S_n`, where `S_n` is the symmetric group on `n` letters, and the image of the homomorphism, `Im(φ)`, must be a transitive subgroup of `S_n`.\n    For this problem, `n=4`, so we are looking for subgroups of index 4. This means we need to consider homomorphisms `φ: G → S_4` such that `Im(φ)` is a transitive subgroup of `S_4`.\n\n2.  **Properties of the Grigorchuk Group (G)**\n    The Grigorchuk group `G` has several key properties that are crucial for this problem:\n    *   `G` is a finitely generated group (by 4 elements `a, b, c, d`).\n    *   `G` is an infinite 2-group. This means every element in `G` has an order that is a power of 2.\n    *   A critical property of `G` is that any finite quotient of `G` is an elementary abelian 2-group. An elementary abelian 2-group is a group isomorphic to `(C_2)^k` for some integer `k`, where `C_2` is the cyclic group of order 2. In such groups, every non-identity element has order 2.\n    *   The abelianization of `G`, denoted `G_ab` or `G/[G,G]`, is `G/[G,G] ≅ C_2 × C_2 × C_2 ≅ (C_2)^3`.\n\n3.  **Identifying Possible Homomorphic Images in S_4**\n    We need to find the possible transitive subgroups of `S_4` that can be a homomorphic image of `G`.\n    *   The transitive subgroups of `S_4` are:\n        *   `C_4`, the cyclic group of order 4.\n        *   `V_4`, the Klein four-group (isomorphic to `C_2 × C_2`).\n        *   `D_8` (or `D_4`), the dihedral group of order 8.\n        *   `A_4`, the alternating group of order 12.\n        *   `S_4`, the symmetric group of order 24.\n    *   Since `G` is a 2-group, its homomorphic images must also be 2-groups. This eliminates `A_4` and `S_4`, which contain elements of order 3.\n    *   We are left with `C_4`, `V_4`, and `D_8`.\n    *   Now we use the property that any finite quotient of `G` must be an elementary abelian 2-group.\n        *   `C_4` is not elementary abelian because it has an element of order 4. So `C_4` cannot be a quotient of `G`.\n        *   `D_8` is not abelian, so it cannot be an elementary abelian 2-group. So `D_8` cannot be a quotient of `G`.\n        *   `V_4` is isomorphic to `C_2 × C_2`, which is an elementary abelian 2-group. `V_4` is a possible quotient.\n    *   Therefore, if `H` is a subgroup of index 4 in `G`, the corresponding homomorphism `φ: G → S_4` must have `Im(φ) ≅ V_4`.\n\n4.  **Characterizing the Subgroups of Index 4**\n    Let `H` be a subgroup of index 4. The action of `G` on the set of left cosets `G/H` gives `φ: G → S_4` with `Im(φ) ≅ V_4`. The subgroup `H` is the stabilizer of a point (e.g., the coset `1H`). The image `Im(φ) ≅ V_4` is a transitive subgroup of `S_4` of order 4. Any such group acts regularly on the 4 elements. A regular action means that the stabilizer of any point is the trivial subgroup.\n    *   So, `Stab_{Im(φ)}(1H) = {e}`.\n    *   The stabilizer in `G` is `H = {g ∈ G | φ(g) ∈ Stab_{Im(φ)}(1H)} = {g ∈ G | φ(g) = e} = Ker(φ)`.\n    *   This shows that any subgroup `H` of index 4 must be the kernel of a homomorphism from `G` to `V_4`. Since kernels of homomorphisms are always normal subgroups, all subgroups of index 4 in `G` are normal.\n    *   The problem is now reduced to counting the number of normal subgroups `N` in `G` such that `G/N ≅ V_4`.\n\n5.  **Counting the Normal Subgroups**\n    The number of such normal subgroups is equal to the number of distinct kernels of surjective homomorphisms (epimorphisms) from `G` to `V_4`.\n    *   Any homomorphism from `G` to an abelian group like `V_4` factors through the abelianization `G_{ab} = G/[G,G]`.\n    *   We know `G_{ab} ≅ C_2 × C_2 × C_2`. Let's denote this by `(C_2)^3`.\n    *   So, we need to count the number of epimorphisms from `(C_2)^3` to `V_4 ≅ (C_2)^2`.\n    *   Let's think in terms of linear algebra over the field with two elements, `F_2`. We are counting surjective linear maps `L: F_2^3 → F_2^2`.\n    *   The total number of linear maps from `F_2^3` to `F_2^2` is `|F_2^2|^3 = 4^3 = 64`.\n    *   A map is not surjective if its image is a proper subspace of `F_2^2`. The proper subspaces are the zero space (`{0}`) and three distinct 1-dimensional subspaces.\n        *   The number of maps with image `{0}` is 1 (the zero map).\n        *   For each of the 3 one-dimensional subspaces `W` of `F_2^2`, the number of linear maps from `F_2^3` to `W ≅ F_2` is `|F_2|^3 = 2^3 = 8`. One of these is the zero map, so there are `8-1=7` maps whose image is exactly `W`. This gives `3 × 7 = 21` maps whose image is 1-dimensional.\n    *   The total number of non-surjective maps is `1 + 21 = 22`.\n    *   The number of surjective maps (epimorphisms) is `64 - 22 = 42`.\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Distinct Kernels**\n    We have 42 epimorphisms, but several of them can have the same kernel. If `φ_1` and `φ_2` are two epimorphisms from `G` to `V_4`, they have the same kernel if and only if `φ_2 = α ∘ φ_1` for some automorphism `α ∈ Aut(V_4)`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of distinct kernels is the total number of epimorphisms divided by the number of automorphisms of `V_4`.\n    *   `Aut(V_4) = Aut(C_2 × C_2) ≅ GL(2, F_2)`.\n    *   The number of elements in `GL(2, F_2)` is `(2^2 - 1)(2^2 - 2^1) = 3 × 2 = 6`.\n    *   The number of normal subgroups `N` with `G/N ≅ V_4` is `42 / 6 = 7`.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is the number of normal subgroups `N` such that `G/N ≅ V_4`. By counting the epimorphisms from `G` to `V_4` and dividing by the size of `Aut(V_4)`, we found this number to be 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
