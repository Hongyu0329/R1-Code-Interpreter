    "An analysis of the question follows.\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\nThe question asks for the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\). This requires understanding the definition of these numbers and their connection to continued fractions.\n\n1.  **Understanding Generalized Markov Numbers:** The classical Markov numbers are integers \\(m\\) appearing in the Diophantine equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\). They are linked to the Lagrange spectrum, which describes how well irrational numbers can be approximated by rationals. The values in the Lagrange spectrum below 3 are discrete and correspond to quadratic irrationals whose continued fractions are eventually periodic.\n    Generalized Markov numbers, as described by Aigner and others, extend this theory by associating a value in the Lagrange spectrum to *every* rational number \\(p/q\\). The notation \\(m_{p/q}\\) refers to this generalization. The \"continued fraction associated with \\(m_{p/q}\\)\" is the continued fraction of the specific quadratic irrational number \\( \\theta \\) that defines this spectral value.\n\n2.  **The Algorithm:** There is a standard construction for finding the associated quadratic irrational \\( \\theta_{p/q} \\) for a given rational \\(p/q\\). Let's assume \\( p/q \\in (0, 1) \\).\n    a. First, compute the simple continued fraction of \\(p/q\\). It will be of the form \\( [0; a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n] \\).\n    b. Let \\( u = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\) be the sequence of these coefficients.\n    c. Let \\( v = (a_n, a_{n-1}, \\ldots, a_1) \\) be the reverse of the sequence \\(u\\).\n    d. The continued fraction of the associated quadratic irrational \\( \\theta_{p/q} \\) is then given by concatenating \\(v\\) and \\(u\\) to form a periodic block: \\( \\theta_{p/q} = [\\overline{v, u}] = [\\overline{a_n, a_{n-1}, \\ldots, a_1, a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n}] \\).\n\n3.  **Applying the Algorithm to \\(m_{4/7}\\):**\n    a. **Compute the continued fraction of 4/7:**\n       We use the Euclidean algorithm.\n       \\( x_0 = 4/7 \\), so \\( a_0 = \\lfloor 4/7 \\rfloor = 0 \\).\n       \\( x_1 = 1 / (4/7 - 0) = 7/4 = 1 + 3/4 \\), so \\( a_1 = \\lfloor 7/4 \\rfloor = 1 \\).\n       \\( x_2 = 1 / (7/4 - 1) = 1 / (3/4) = 4/3 = 1 + 1/3 \\), so \\( a_2 = \\lfloor 4/3 \\rfloor = 1 \\).\n       \\( x_3 = 1 / (4/3 - 1) = 1 / (1/3) = 3 \\), so \\( a_3 = \\lfloor 3 \\rfloor = 3 \\).\n       The algorithm terminates. So, the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n\n    b. **Identify the coefficient sequence \\(u\\):**\n       The coefficients after \\(a_0\\) are \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3) \\). So, the word is \\( u = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n\n    c. **Find the reversed sequence \\(v\\):**\n       Reversing the sequence \\(u\\) gives \\( v = (3, 1, 1) \\).\n\n    d. **Construct the periodic continued fraction:**\n       The associated continued fraction is \\( [\\overline{v, u}] \\). Concatenating \\(v\\) and \\(u\\), we get the periodic block \\( (3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3) \\).\n       Thus, the final continued fraction is \\( [\\overline{3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3}] \\).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   The \"generalized Markov numbers\" \\(m_{p/q}\\) as defined in modern literature (e.g., by Aigner) form a set of points in the Lagrange spectrum indexed by rationals. This set is largely distinct from the classical Markov spectrum values (\\( \\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{8}, \\sqrt{221}/5, \\dots \\)). One should not expect the irrational associated with, say, \\(m_{1/3}\\) to be the one corresponding to the classical Markov number \\(m=5\\).\n*   The order of concatenation, \\( [\\overline{v, u}] \\), is specified by convention in major texts like Aigner's. Using the reverse order, \\( [\\overline{u, v}] \\), would result in a different quadratic irrational and potentially a different Markov value. The chosen convention must be followed.\n*   The process results in a continued fraction whose periodic part \\( (v,u) \\) is always a palindrome. This can serve as a quick sanity check. In our case, \\( (3,1,1,1,1,3) \\) is indeed a palindrome.\n\nThe final answer is the purely periodic continued fraction derived from this procedure.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n1.  **Input rational:** \\( p/q = 4/7 \\).\n2.  **Continued Fraction:** \\( 4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n3.  **Coefficient Sequence:** \\( u = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n4.  **Reversed Sequence:** \\( v = (3, 1, 1) \\).\n5.  **Associated Continued Fraction:** \\( [\\overline{v, u}] = [\\overline{3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3}] \\)."
