    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe goal is to determine the total number of distinct members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in the human genome to date.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"let-7 family member\".**\nA \"member\" of a miRNA family refers to a unique mature miRNA molecule. These members share a highly similar sequence, particularly in the critical \"seed region\" (nucleotides 2-8), which determines their target genes. While some members are encoded by multiple different genes (paralogs), they produce the exact same mature miRNA sequence and are therefore counted as a single member.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the authoritative source for miRNA data.**\nThe most reliable and universally accepted database for miRNA sequences and annotation is miRBase. Any count of miRNA members should be based on the data provided by miRBase.\n\n**Step 4: List the canonical let-7 members in humans.**\nBy querying miRBase for human (`Homo sapiens`, prefix `hsa-`) let-7 miRNAs, we can identify the members that are named with the \"let-7\" prefix. These are:\n1.  let-7a\n2.  let-7b\n3.  let-7c\n4.  let-7d\n5.  let-7e\n6.  let-7f\n7.  let-7g\n8.  let-7i\n*(Note: There is no let-7h identified in humans.)*\n\nThis gives an initial count of 8 members.\n\n**Step 5: Identify other miRNAs belonging to the let-7 family.**\nDue to high sequence homology, particularly in the seed sequence, miR-98 is also considered a bona fide member of the let-7 family in mammals, including humans. Its function and targets largely overlap with the other let-7 members.\n9.  miR-98\n\n**Step 6: Combine the lists and calculate the final count.**\nCombining the canonical let-7 members with miR-98 gives a complete list of the human let-7 family:\n1.  let-7a\n2.  let-7b\n3.  let-7c\n4.  let-7d\n5.  let-7e\n6.  let-7f\n7.  let-7g\n8.  let-7i\n9.  miR-98\n\nThe total count is 9 distinct members.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Mature miRNAs vs. Precursor Genes:** It is crucial to distinguish between the number of unique mature miRNAs and the number of genes that encode them. For example, the mature `let-7a` miRNA is encoded by three different genes (`hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, `hsa-let-7a-3`). Similarly, `let-7f` is encoded by two genes. In total, these 9 members are encoded by 12 different precursor genes. The question asks for the number of \"members,\" which refers to the 9 distinct mature miRNA types.\n2.  **Inclusion of miR-98:** A common mistake is to only count miRNAs with \"let-7\" in their name. However, based on sequence and function, `miR-98` is an established member of the family.\n3.  **No `let-7h` in Humans:** The lettering of miRNA families is not always sequential. The absence of `let-7h` in the human genome is a known fact and should not be considered a missing item.\n4.  **Data Source:** Always refer to an updated, authoritative database like miRBase for the most accurate information, as miRNA discoveries and annotations can change over time. As of the latest miRBase releases, this count remains stable.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBy systematically identifying all officially recognized members of the human let-7 family from the primary miRNA database, including those with canonical `let-7` names and those added based on sequence homology (`miR-98`), we arrive at a total count.\n\n-   Let-7 miRNAs (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i): 8 members\n-   Related members (miR-98): 1 member\n-   Total: 8 + 1 = 9 members.\n\n<<<9>>>"
