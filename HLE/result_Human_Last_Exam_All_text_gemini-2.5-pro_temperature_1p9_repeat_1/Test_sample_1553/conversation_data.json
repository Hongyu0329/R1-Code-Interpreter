    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Novel and Main Character:** The novel is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Jacek Dukaj. The main character is Adam Zamoyski, an astronaut from the 21st century who is resurrected in the distant future.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Central Relationship:** Upon his revival, Adam Zamoyski struggles to adapt to the posthuman civilization he finds himself in. A key figure who helps him navigate this new reality is a powerful, shape-shifting posthuman entity known as an *inkluza*.\n\n3.  **Identify the Name of the Character:** This *inkluza*, with whom Adam forms the deepest and most significant bond throughout the novel, is named Angelina.\n\n4.  **Interpret the Concept of \"Marriage\":** The term \"marriage\" in the context of the novel's far-future setting isn't a traditional human ceremony. Instead, it represents a profound and permanent union. The relationship between Adam and Angelina evolves into a complete merger of their goals, existence, and consciousness. At the end of the novel, they effectively become a single, unified entity or an inseparable pair, embarking on a journey together. This profound bond is the story's equivalent of a marriage.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the plot, Adam Zamoyski's primary partner, with whom he forms a union analogous to marriage, is Angelina.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Main Character:** It is crucial to correctly identify the protagonist as Adam Zamoyski.\n*   **Definition of \"Marriage\":** The question uses a conventional term for a highly unconventional, futuristic concept. The \"marriage\" is a metaphysical and technological union, not a traditional social one.\n*   **Character's Nature:** Angelina is not a human in the traditional sense. She is an *inkluza*, a vastly more advanced being, which is central to the nature of their relationship.\n*   **Plot Culmination:** The answer hinges on remembering the end of the novel, where their partnership is irrevocably solidified.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the name of the character Adam Zamoyski \"marries\".\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
