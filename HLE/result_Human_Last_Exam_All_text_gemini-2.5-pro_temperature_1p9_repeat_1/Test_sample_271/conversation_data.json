    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial and identify its irreducible factors.**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We try to find a pattern to factor it.\nNotice that we can group terms as follows:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$.\nThe polynomial $h(x) = x^2 - 2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ as its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$, which are not rational.\nFor the polynomial $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The prime $3$ divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient ($1$). The constant term is $3$, which is not divisible by $3^2=9$. Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe roots of $f(x)$ are the union of the roots of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\n\nLet $K$ be the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. $K$ is the smallest field containing all roots of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\nLet $K_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThen $K$ is the composite field $K_g K_h$.\n\nThe splitting field of $h(x) = x^2 - 2$ is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow let's find the Galois group of $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. Since $g(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, its Galois group $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_5$.\nTo determine which subgroup it is, we find the number of real roots of $g(x)$.\nThe derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The real roots of $g'(x)$ are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. These are the two real critical points of $g(x)$.\nLet's evaluate $g(x)$ at these points. Let $x_0 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n$g(x_0) = (\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 - 9\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = (9/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} - 9\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = 3 - (36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} \\approx 3 - 7.2 \\times 1.15 < 0$.\n$g(-x_0) = -(\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 + 9\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = 3 + (36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 0$.\nSince the local maximum value is positive and the local minimum value is negative, $g(x)$ has 3 real roots. The other two roots are a complex conjugate pair.\nAn irreducible polynomial of degree 5 over $\\mathbb{Q}$ having exactly 3 real roots has a Galois group isomorphic to $S_5$. So, $G_g = S_5$.\n\nThe Galois group of the splitting field $K=K_g K_h$ is $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Its structure is given by $G \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$ if $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since it's a subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, it can be either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subset K_g$.\nA quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is contained in the splitting field of an irreducible polynomial with Galois group $S_n$ if and only if it is the fixed field of the alternating group $A_n$. This field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, where $\\Delta$ is the discriminant of the polynomial.\nSo, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subseteq K_g$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$, which implies $\\Delta_g = 2m^2$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n + ax + b$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}((1-n)^{n-1}a^n+n^n b^{n-1})$.\nFor $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$\\Delta_g = (-1)^{10}((-4)^4(-9)^5 + 5^5 \\cdot 3^4) = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\nSince $\\Delta_g$ is negative, it cannot be of the form $2m^2$ for a rational number $m$.\nThus, $K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong G_g \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe order of the Galois group is $|G| = |S_5| \\times |\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$. So $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240$.\n\n**Step 3: Find all relevant normal subgroups and their indices.**\n\nWe are looking for the degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these fields $L$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the normal subgroups $H$ of $G=\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G:H| = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{e\\}, \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNormal subgroups of $G$ include the products of normal subgroups of the factors:\n1. $H_1 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_1|=120$.\n2. $H_2 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_2|=60$.\n3. $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: $|H_3|=2$.\n4. $H_4 = A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: $|H_4|=120$.\n\nWe must also check for \"diagonal\" subgroups, which exist if there is an isomorphism between quotient groups of normal subgroups of the factors. The only possibility is an isomorphism between $S_5/A_5 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ and $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})/\\{e\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Let $\\phi: S_5/A_5 \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ be this isomorphism. This gives rise to one additional normal subgroup:\n5. $H_5 = \\{ (g,h) \\in S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\mid \\phi(gA_5) = h \\}$. Let sgn be the sign map on $S_5$, which has kernel $A_5$. We identify its image $\\{-1,1\\}$ with $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}=\\{e,c\\}$. Then $H_5 = \\{ (g, \\text{sgn}(g)) \\mid g \\in S_5 \\}$. This subgroup consists of pairs $(g,e)$ where $g$ is an even permutation and $(g,c)$ where $g$ is an odd permutation.\nIts size is $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n\nThese five subgroups are all the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the degrees of the corresponding normal extensions.**\n\nThe degree of the normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the index of the corresponding normal subgroup $H$.\n$[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H| = 240/|H|$.\n\n1. For $H_1 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $[L_1:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/120 = 2$. (This field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.)\n2. For $H_2 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $[L_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/60 = 4$. (This field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g}, \\sqrt{2})$.)\n3. For $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: $[L_3:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/2 = 120$. (This field is $K_g$.)\n4. For $H_4 = A_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$: $[L_4:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/120 = 2$. (This field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$.)\n5. For $H_5$: $[L_5:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/120 = 2$. (This field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2\\Delta_g})$.)\n\nThe distinct values for the degrees are collected from the list of indices {2, 4, 120, 2, 2}.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
