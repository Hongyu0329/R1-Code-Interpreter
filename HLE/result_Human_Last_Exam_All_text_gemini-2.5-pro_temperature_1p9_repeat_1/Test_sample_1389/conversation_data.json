    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the definitions of an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine, \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy,\" and \"1 - incidence rate ratio.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define an \"All-or-Nothing\" Vaccine Model**\n*   An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine (also known as a \"perfect\" or \"take\" model) operates on a simple principle.\n*   Upon vaccination, a certain proportion of the vaccinated individuals, let's call this proportion `s` (for \"successful\" or \"take\"), become perfectly immune. They have a 0% chance of getting infected, no matter how many times they are exposed.\n*   The remaining proportion, `1-s`, receives no benefit from the vaccine at all. Their susceptibility to infection is identical to that of an unvaccinated person.\n*   So, the vaccinated population is a mixture of two groups: `s` proportion are perfectly protected, and `(1-s)` proportion are completely unprotected.\n\n**Step 2: Define Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_p)**\n*   This is the estimand, the true quantity we want to measure. It is the percentage reduction in the probability of infection *given a single exposure to the pathogen*.\n*   Let `P_u` be the probability of infection per exposure for an unvaccinated person.\n*   For a successfully vaccinated person (the `s` group), the probability of infection per exposure is 0.\n*   For an unsuccessfully vaccinated person (the `1-s` group), the probability of infection per exposure is `P_u`.\n*   The *average* probability of infection per exposure for a randomly selected vaccinated person (`P_v`) is the weighted average: `P_v = (s * 0) + ((1-s) * P_u) = (1-s)P_u`.\n*   The formula for per-exposure vaccine efficacy is:\n    `VE_p = (P_u - P_v) / P_u`\n*   Substituting our value for `P_v`:\n    `VE_p = (P_u - (1-s)P_u) / P_u`\n    `VE_p = P_u * (1 - (1-s)) / P_u`\n    `VE_p = P_u * s / P_u`\n    `VE_p = s`\n*   **Careful Point 1:** For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy is exactly equal to `s`, the proportion of individuals who are successfully immunized.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Estimator: 1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (VE_IRR)**\n*   This is the value we calculate from observational data (like a clinical trial).\n*   The Incidence Rate (IR) is the number of new cases per unit of person-time at risk.\n*   Let `IR_u` be the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n*   Let `IR_v` be the incidence rate in the vaccinated group.\n*   The estimator is `VE_IRR = 1 - (IR_v / IR_u)`.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Incidence Rates to the All-or-Nothing Model**\n*   The incidence rate is a function of the exposure rate (force of infection) and the probability of infection upon exposure. We assume the exposure rate is the same for both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups (a standard assumption in randomized trials).\n*   The incidence rate in the `s` proportion of successfully vaccinated individuals is 0.\n*   The incidence rate in the `1-s` proportion of unsuccessfully vaccinated individuals is the same as the unvaccinated group, `IR_u`.\n*   The overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) is the weighted average of the rates in its sub-groups:\n    `IR_v = (s * 0) + ((1-s) * IR_u) = (1-s)IR_u`.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The incidence rate in the vaccinated group as a whole is lower than the unvaccinated group's rate by a factor of `(1-s)`.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Estimator (VE_IRR) to the Estimand (VE_p)**\n*   Now we calculate the value of our estimator using the result from Step 4.\n    `VE_IRR = 1 - (IR_v / IR_u)`\n*   Substitute our expression for `IR_v`:\n    `VE_IRR = 1 - ((1-s)IR_u / IR_u)`\n    `VE_IRR = 1 - (1-s)`\n    `VE_IRR = s`\n*   We found in Step 2 that the true per-exposure efficacy, `VE_p`, is equal to `s`.\n*   We just calculated that the estimator, `VE_IRR`, is also equal to `s`.\n*   Since `VE_IRR = VE_p`, the estimator is unbiased.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor an all-or-nothing vaccine, the 1-incidence rate ratio formula calculates a value `s`. The true per-exposure vaccine efficacy is also `s`. Therefore, the 1-incidence rate ratio **correctly estimates** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
