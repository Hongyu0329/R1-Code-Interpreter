    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables, denoted as a(4).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Boolean Function of n variables**: A function `f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)` that takes binary inputs and produces a binary output.\n*   **Implicant**: A product term (a conjunction of literals like `x_1x_2'`, `x_3`, etc.) that implies the function `f`. This means that for any input that makes the product term true (evaluates to 1), the function `f` must also be true.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI)**: An implicant `P` such that if any literal is removed from `P`, the resulting product term is no longer an implicant of `f`. In essence, it's a \"minimal\" implicant in terms of the literals it contains.\n*   **`a(n)`**: The maximal number of prime implicants that any Boolean function of `n` variables can have. We are asked to find `a(4)`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Problem to Combinatorial Structures\n\nThe set of all prime implicants for any given Boolean function `f`, `PI(f)`, has a specific property: no prime implicant can be a sub-term of another. For example, if `x_1x_2` is a prime implicant, then `x_1` cannot be an implicant (and thus cannot be a prime implicant). This property means that the set of prime implicants forms an **antichain** in the partially ordered set (poset) of all possible product terms.\n\nThe partial order is defined by implication: a term `P1` is \"greater\" than `P2` if `P2` implies `P1`. For example, `x_1x_2` implies `x_1`, so `x_1 > x_1x_2`. An antichain is a set of elements where no two are comparable under this order. A set of product terms of the same length (i.e., same number of literals) is a clear example of an antichain.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Size of the Largest Antichain\n\nThe problem of finding `a(n)` is equivalent to finding the size of the largest possible antichain in the poset of product terms. Due to a result in combinatorics known as Sperner's property for this specific poset, the maximum size of an antichain is equal to the size of the largest \"rank\" in the poset. A rank is simply the set of all product terms with the same number of literals.\n\nLet's calculate the number of possible product terms with `m` literals for a function of `n=4` variables.\nTo form a product term with `m` literals:\n1.  Choose which `m` variables out of `n` to use. This can be done in `C(n, m)` ways, where `C` is the binomial coefficient \"n choose m\".\n2.  For each of the `m` chosen variables, decide whether to use it in its complemented (`x'`) or uncomplemented (`x`) form. There are `2^m` ways to do this.\n\nSo, the total number of product terms with `m` literals is `C(n, m) * 2^m`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Maximum Value for n=4\n\nWe need to find the value of `m` (from 0 to 4) that maximizes `C(4, m) * 2^m`.\n\n*   For `m=0`: The only term is the constant '1'. Number of terms = `C(4, 0) * 2^0 = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n*   For `m=1`: Terms like `x_1`, `x_1'`, `x_2`, etc. Number of terms = `C(4, 1) * 2^1 = 4 * 2 = 8`.\n*   For `m=2`: Terms like `x_1x_2`, `x_1'x_2`, etc. Number of terms = `C(4, 2) * 2^2 = 6 * 4 = 24`.\n*   For `m=3`: Terms like `x_1x_2x_3`, `x_1'x_2x_3`, etc. Number of terms = `C(4, 3) * 2^3 = 4 * 8 = 32`.\n*   For `m=4`: Terms like `x_1x_2x_3x_4`, etc. Number of terms = `C(4, 4) * 2^4 = 1 * 16 = 16`.\n\nComparing these values: 1, 8, 24, 32, 16.\n\nThe maximum value is 32, which occurs when the prime implicants are all the possible 3-literal terms.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of 4 variables, `a(4)`, is 32. It has been proven that there indeed exists a Boolean function of `n` variables whose set of prime implicants corresponds to the largest rank of the poset, thus achieving this maximum bound.\n\n<<<32>>>"
