    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the group structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Group Structure**\n\n*   The question asks about the semidihedral group of size 512.\n*   The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ is denoted by $SD_{2^n}$.\n*   Given the size is 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which implies $n=9$. So, the group in question is $G = SD_{2^9}$.\n*   The standard presentation of the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ for $n \\ge 3$ is:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n*   For our specific group, $n=9$, the presentation is:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^8} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^7-1} \\rangle$, which is\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n*   The elements of this group are of the form $r^i$ (for $0 \\le i < 256$) and $sr^i$ (for $0 \\le i < 256$). The total number of elements is $256 + 256 = 512$.\n\n**Step 2: Defining Power Subgroups**\n\n*   A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a **power subgroup** if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is equal to the set of the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$. This set is denoted by $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n*   It's important to note that for a general non-abelian group, the set $G^k$ is not always a subgroup. The term \"power subgroup\" specifically refers to those sets $G^k$ that do form a subgroup.\n*   The group $G=SD_{512}$ is a finite 2-group (a group of prime power order, with $p=2$). There is a theorem for such groups (from Y. Berkovich, *Groups of Prime Power Order*, Vol 1, Section 13, Lemma 13.9(b)):\n    *   **Theorem:** Let $G$ be a finite p-group. The set $G^k$ is a subgroup if and only if $k$ is a power of $p$.\n*   Applying this theorem to our case where $G$ is a 2-group, the power subgroups of $G$ are precisely the subgroups of the form $G^{2^m}$ for non-negative integers $m$ ($m=0, 1, 2, ...$).\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nWe now need to calculate the subgroups $G^{2^m}$ for $m = 0, 1, 2, ...$ and count how many of them are distinct.\n\n*   The **exponent** of a group is the smallest positive integer $e$ such that $g^e=1$ for all $g \\in G$. For $SD_{2^n}$, the exponent is $2^{n-1}$. For our group $SD_{512}$ ($n=9$), the exponent is $2^{9-1}=2^8=256$.\n*   This means that for any $g \\in G$, $g^{256} = 1$. Consequently, for any $m \\ge 8$, $2^m$ is a multiple of 256, so $g^{2^m} = (g^{256})^{2^{m-8}} = 1^{2^{m-8}} = 1$.\n*   Therefore, $G^{2^m} = \\{1\\}$ for all $m \\ge 8$. This means we only need to check the cases $m = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$. This gives us at most 9 distinct subgroups.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating $G^{2^m}$ for $m=0, 1, ..., 8$**\n\nWe calculate the set of $k$-th powers for $k=2^m$. An element $g$ can be $r^i$ or $sr^i$.\n*   $(r^i)^k = r^{ik}$.\n*   For elements of the form $sr^i$, we first find $(sr^i)^2$:\n    From the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we can derive $sr^i s = r^{127i}$.\n    $(sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i = (r^{127i})r^i = r^{128i} = r^{i \\cdot 2^7}$.\n    Then $(sr^i)^4 = ((sr^i)^2)^2 = (r^{i \\cdot 2^7})^2 = r^{i \\cdot 2^8} = r^{256i} = (r^{256})^i = 1^i = 1$.\n    So, for any $i$, the element $sr^i$ has order dividing 4.\n\nLet's now compute $G^{2^m}$:\n*   **For m = 0 (k=1):** $G^1 = G = SD_{512}$. This is a non-abelian group of order 512.\n*   **For m = 1 (k=2):**\n    $G^2 = \\{g^2 \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{(r^i)^2\\} \\cup \\{(sr^i)^2\\} = \\{r^{2i}\\} \\cup \\{r^{128i}\\}$.\n    The set $\\{r^{2i} \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$ forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    The set $\\{r^{128i} \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$ forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$.\n    Since $r^{128} = (r^2)^{64}$, the subgroup $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ is contained within $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    Thus, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $o(r^2)=256/2 = 128$.\n*   **For m $\\ge$ 2 (k=$2^m \\ge 4$):**\n    Since $(sr^i)^4 = 1$, for any $m \\ge 2$, $(sr^i)^{2^m} = 1$.\n    Therefore, $G^{2^m} = \\{(r^i)^{2^m}\\} \\cup \\{(sr^i)^{2^m}\\} = \\{r^{i \\cdot 2^m}\\} \\cup \\{1\\}$.\n    This is simply the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{2^m} \\rangle$. The order of this subgroup is $o(r^{2^m}) = 256 / 2^m = 2^{8-m}$.\n    Let's list these for $m=2, ..., 8$:\n    *   m=2: $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$, order $2^{8-2}=64$.\n    *   m=3: $G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$, order $2^{8-3}=32$.\n    *   m=4: $G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$, order $2^{8-4}=16$.\n    *   m=5: $G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$, order $2^{8-5}=8$.\n    *   m=6: $G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$, order $2^{8-6}=4$.\n    *   m=7: $G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$, order $2^{8-7}=2$.\n    *   m=8: $G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$, order $2^{8-8}=1$.\n\n**Step 5: Counting the Distinct Subgroups**\n\nWe have found the following set of power subgroups:\n1.  $G^1 = SD_{512}$ (order 512)\n2.  $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (order 128)\n3.  $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$ (order 64)\n4.  $G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n5.  $G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$ (order 16)\n6.  $G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$ (order 8)\n7.  $G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n8.  $G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n9.  $G^{256} = \\{1\\}$ (order 1)\n\nSince all these subgroups have different orders, they are all distinct. There are 9 distinct subgroups in this list. As established in Step 3, this list is complete.\n\nThus, there are 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512."
