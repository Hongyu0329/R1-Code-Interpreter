    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (more specifically, buta-1,3-diene). Its structure is CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene, which acts as the 4π-electron component in a Diels-Alder reaction. For the reaction to occur, it must adopt the *s-cis* conformation.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This is an alkene, which acts as the dienophile (the 2π-electron component). The four electron-withdrawing halogen atoms make it an excellent dienophile.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Product's Basic Structure:**\n    *   The Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted process where three π bonds are broken and two new σ (single) bonds and one new π (double) bond are formed.\n    *   The four carbons of the diene and the two carbons of the dienophile combine to form a cyclohexene ring.\n    *   The double bond in the product ring is located between the central carbons of the original diene (C2 and C3).\n    *   The substituents originally on the dienophile (two Cl atoms on one carbon, two F atoms on the other) will be attached to adjacent carbons in the newly formed saturated part of the cyclohexene ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze Regiochemistry:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must consider the orientation of the addition because the diene is symmetrical (H₂C=CH-CH=CH₂) but the dienophile is unsymmetrical (CCl₂ vs CF₂). This means two different constitutional isomers (regioisomers) are possible.\n    *   **Possibility 1:** C1 of butadiene bonds to the CCl₂ carbon, and C4 of butadiene bonds to the CF₂ carbon.\n    *   **Possibility 2:** C1 of butadiene bonds to the CF₂ carbon, and C4 of butadiene bonds to the CCl₂ carbon.\n    *   The regiochemical outcome of a Diels-Alder reaction is governed by electronic factors, explained by Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory. The reaction occurs through the overlap of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile. The major product arises from the orientation that maximizes this orbital overlap, which corresponds to matching the atoms with the largest orbital coefficients.\n    *   For the electron-rich diene (butadiene), the HOMO coefficients are largest at the terminal carbons (C1 and C4).\n    *   For the electron-poor dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂), the LUMO must be considered. Although fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, theoretical calculations and experimental evidence from similar reactions (e.g., with substituted butadienes) indicate that the LUMO has a larger coefficient on the dichlorinated carbon (CCl₂). This is likely due to a combination of factors including polarizability and the energy levels of the orbitals.\n    *   **Conclusion on Regioselectivity:** The preferred orientation involves the formation of a bond between a terminal carbon of the diene (C1 or C4) and the CCl₂ carbon of the dienophile. Since the diene is symmetrical, both C1 and C4 are equivalent. Let's assume C1 of the diene bonds to CCl₂. Then, C4 of the diene must bond to CF₂. This orientation will lead to the major product.\n\n4.  **Draw and Name the Major Product:**\n    *   Let's construct the product from the preferred regiochemical pathway: C1(diene)-C(Cl₂) and C4(diene)-C(F₂) bonds are formed.\n    *   The resulting six-membered ring has the following connectivity: -CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-CF₂-CCl₂- (where the final CCl₂ group is bonded back to the first CH₂ group to close the ring).\n    *   **Naming (IUPAC Rules):**\n        a.  The parent structure is a **cyclohexene**.\n        b.  We number the ring to give the double bond carbons the lowest possible numbers, C1 and C2.\n        c.  We then number the rest of the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants.\n        d.  Let's number the ring starting from the double bond. There are two ways to do this:\n            *   **Path A:** Numbering clockwise gives the CCl₂ group position 4 and the CF₂ group position 5.\n            *   **Path B:** Numbering counter-clockwise gives the CF₂ group position 4 and the CCl₂ group position 5.\n        e.  **Careful Point:** Both paths result in the same locant set: {4,4,5,5}. When there is a tie in locant sets, we assign the lower number to the substituent group that comes first alphabetically.\n        f.  The substituent names are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\". \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically.\n        g.  Therefore, we must choose the numbering path that gives the \"dichloro\" group the lower number. This is Path B from the previous step.\n        h. The final name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The symmetrical diene (butadiene) reacts with the unsymmetrical dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene). Although two regioisomers are possible, electronic effects favor the formation of one major product where a terminal carbon of butadiene bonds to the dichlorinated carbon of the dienophile. Constructing this product and naming it according to IUPAC rules gives the final answer.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
