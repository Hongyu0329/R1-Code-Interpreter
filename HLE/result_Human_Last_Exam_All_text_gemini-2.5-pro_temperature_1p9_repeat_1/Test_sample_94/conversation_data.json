    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **\"Which physicist...\"**: The subject is a person, specifically a physicist.\n2.  **\"...better known for work in the microscopy field...\"**: This is a key constraint. The person's primary fame or contribution lies in the field of microscopy, even if they were a physicist by training. This points away from general-purpose physicists like Newton or Einstein and towards specialists.\n3.  **\"...discovered an optical effect...\"**: The discovery is related to the behavior of light (optics).\n4.  **\"...in real imagery...\"**: The effect pertains to real images, which are formed where light rays actually converge. Concave mirrors and convex lenses can form real images.\n5.  **\"...after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\"**: This is the most specific and crucial detail of the story. The initial observation was an accident made by a non-scientist while cleaning a specific type of optical component (a concave mirror).\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   The term \"custodial worker\" might be a modern retelling; historical accounts might use terms like \"lab assistant,\" \"charwoman,\" or \"cleaner.\" The core idea is a non-scientist making the initial chance observation.\n*   The setup involves a concave mirror, which is often used as a reflector to condense or focus light. In early microscopes, a concave mirror was frequently used to illuminate the specimen.\n*   The \"optical effect\" is the key discovery. The physicist didn't just see what the worker saw; they understood the underlying physical principle and generalized it into a useful technique or theory.\n\n**Acquiring the final answer with step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the event**: The story described is a well-known, albeit sometimes embellished, anecdote in the history of microscopy. It describes the origin of a fundamental illumination technique.\n2.  **Recall/Research the story**: The story concerns the German physicist **August Köhler** (1866-1948).\n3.  **Connect the story to the details**:\n    *   In the late 19th century, microscopists struggled to achieve even, bright, and glare-free illumination of their specimens. The light sources of the time (like gas lamps) had uneven structures (the filament or mantle) that would be superimposed on the image of the specimen.\n    *   The story goes that a lab assistant (sometimes identified as \"Seibert\" and often retold as a janitor or cleaner) was tasked with cleaning a dusty concave mirror used as a reflector for the microscope's light source.\n    *   While cleaning, the assistant mentioned to Köhler that he could see a very sharp image of his dusty rag in the same focus as the specimen.\n    *   **The Insight**: Köhler, a trained physicist, immediately realized the significance. The concave mirror was forming a real image of the light source (the lamp) at the specimen plane. His assistant's rag, being at the same position as the lamp, was also being perfectly imaged. He understood that to get rid of the distracting image of the light source, he needed to create two separate sets of conjugate focal planes: one for illumination and one for the image.\n    *   **The Discovery/Effect**: This led him to develop the technique known as **Köhler illumination** (published in 1893). In this method, the image of the light source is focused onto the condenser diaphragm, and the condenser then projects controlled, parallel rays of light onto the specimen. This results in incredibly even illumination without imposing the light source's structure onto the final image.\n4.  **Verify against the question**:\n    *   **Physicist?** Yes, August Köhler was a physicist.\n    *   **Known for microscopy?** Yes, he is almost exclusively famous for developing Köhler illumination.\n    *   **Discovered an optical effect?** Yes, the principle of Köhler illumination.\n    *   **Real imagery?** Yes, the concave mirror was creating a real image.\n    *   **Accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?** Yes, the core of the well-known origin story matches perfectly.\n\nThe physicist who fits all parts of the description is August Köhler.\n\n<<<August Köhler>>>"
