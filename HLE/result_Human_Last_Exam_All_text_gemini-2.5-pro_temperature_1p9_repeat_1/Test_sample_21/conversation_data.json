    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the polynomial:**\n    The polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n    The structure of the polynomial, particularly the part $g(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$, resembles certain classical polynomials. Let's try to rescale the variable $x$. Let $x = cy$.\n    Then $g(cy) = c^7y^7 - 14c^5y^5 + 56c^3y^3 - 56cy$.\n    We compare this with the polynomial $P_n(y)$ defined by $P_n(u+u^{-1}) = u^n+u^{-n}$. For $n=7$, we have $P_7(y) = y^7 - 7y^5 + 14y^3 - 7y$.\n    For $g(cy)$ to be a multiple of $P_7(y)$, the ratios of the coefficients must match.\n    Let $g(cy) = K \\cdot P_7(y)$.\n    $c^7 = K$\n    $-14c^5 = -7K \\implies 14c^5 = 7c^7 \\implies c^2 = 2$.\n    $56c^3 = 14K \\implies 56c^3 = 14c^7 \\implies 4 = c^4 \\implies c^2 = 2$.\n    $-56c = -7K \\implies 56c = 7c^7 \\implies 8 = c^6 \\implies c^2 = \\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$.\n    All conditions consistently give $c^2=2$. Let's choose $c=\\sqrt{2}$. So we perform the substitution $x = \\sqrt{2}y$.\n    $f(\\sqrt{2}y) = (\\sqrt{2}y)^7 - 14(\\sqrt{2}y)^5 + 56(\\sqrt{2}y)^3 - 56(\\sqrt{2}y) + 22 = 0$\n    $8\\sqrt{2}y^7 - 14(4\\sqrt{2})y^5 + 56(2\\sqrt{2})y^3 - 56\\sqrt{2}y + 22 = 0$\n    $8\\sqrt{2}(y^7 - 7y^5 + 14y^3 - 7y) + 22 = 0$\n    $8\\sqrt{2}P_7(y) + 22 = 0$.\n    So the roots of $f(x)=0$ are $x_i = \\sqrt{2}y_i$, where $y_i$ are the roots of $P_7(y) = -\\frac{22}{8\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{11}{4\\sqrt{2}} = -\\frac{11\\sqrt{2}}{8}$.\n\n2.  **Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$:**\n    We need to confirm $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion on a shifted polynomial. Consider $f(x+2)$. The constant term is $f(2) = 2^7 - 14(2^5) + 56(2^3) - 56(2) + 22 = 128 - 14(32) + 56(8) - 112 + 22 = 128 - 448 + 448 - 112 + 22 = 38$.\n    Since $38=2 \\cdot 19$, it is divisible by $p=2$ but not by $p^2=4$. The leading coefficient of $f(x+2)$ is 1, which is not divisible by 2. We need to check that all other coefficients are divisible by 2.\n    The coefficients of $f(x+2)$ are given by Taylor's formula $a_k = \\frac{f^{(k)}(2)}{k!}$. We calculated $a_0 = 38$. $a_7 = 1$. The calculations in the thought process showed all intermediate coefficients are even.\n    Thus, $f(x+2)$ is an Eisenstein polynomial for the prime $p=2$. This proves that $f(x+2)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which implies $f(x)$ is also irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Galois Group:**\n    The roots of $f(x)$ are $x_k = \\sqrt{2} y_k$. The problem of finding the roots $y_k$ of $P_7(y) = -\\frac{11\\sqrt{2}}{8}$ can be solved by setting $y=u+u^{-1}$.\n    The equation becomes $u^7+u^{-7} = -\\frac{11\\sqrt{2}}{8}$. Multiplying by $u^7$ gives a quadratic equation for $z=u^7$:\n    $z^2 + \\frac{11\\sqrt{2}}{8} z + 1 = 0$.\n    The roots are $z_{1,2} = \\frac{-11\\sqrt{2}/8 \\pm \\sqrt{(11\\sqrt{2}/8)^2 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{-11\\sqrt{2} \\pm \\sqrt{121\\cdot2/16 - 64}}{16} = \\frac{-11\\sqrt{2} \\pm \\sqrt{121/8 - 64}}{16}$. No, my previous calc was $\\frac{121\\cdot2}{64}-4 = \\frac{121}{32}-4 = \\frac{121-128}{32} = \\frac{-7}{32}$.\n    So, $z_{1,2} = \\frac{-11\\sqrt{2}/8 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}/(4\\sqrt{2})}{2} = \\frac{-11\\sqrt{2} \\pm i\\sqrt{14}/2}{16}$. Let's call one root $z_0$.\n    The roots of $u^7=z_0$ are $u_k = u_0 \\zeta_7^k$ for $k=0,\\dots,6$, where $u_0 = \\sqrt[7]{z_0}$ and $\\zeta_7=e^{2\\pi i/7}$. The roots of $u^7=z_0^{-1}$ gives the inverses.\n    The 7 distinct roots of $P_7(y) = c$ are $y_k=u_0\\zeta_7^k + u_0^{-1}\\zeta_7^{-k}$.\n    The roots of $f(x)$ are $x_k = \\sqrt{2} y_k = \\sqrt{2}(u_0\\zeta_7^k + u_0^{-1}\\zeta_7^{-k})$ for $k=0, ..., 6$.\n    The splitting field of $f(x)$ is $L=\\mathbb{Q}(x_0, \\dots, x_6)$. To generate all roots, we need $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\zeta_7$, and $u_0$.\n    $z_0$ lies in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, i\\sqrt{14}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-14})$.\n    The splitting field is $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\zeta_7, u_0)$.\n    We know $\\sqrt{-7} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$. Also, $\\sqrt{-14}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{-7}$, so $\\sqrt{-14} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\zeta_7)$.\n    Let $F=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\zeta_7)$. $z_0 \\in F$. $L=F(u_0)=F(\\sqrt[7]{z_0})$.\n    The field extension $F/\\mathbb{Q}$ has Galois group $\\mathrm{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathrm{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\mathrm{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_6$. The order is 12.\n    The extension $L/F$ is a Kummer extension. Since $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, $z_0$ cannot be a 7th power in $F$. Thus, $[L:F]=7$ and $\\mathrm{Gal}(L/F) \\cong C_7$.\n    The Galois group $G=\\mathrm{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a semidirect product $G = C_7 \\rtimes (C_2 \\times C_6)$. The order is $|G|=7 \\cdot 12=84$.\n    The action $\\phi: C_2 \\times C_6 \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(C_7) \\cong C_6$ determines the structure. An element $\\sigma \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$ acts on $\\tau \\in \\mathrm{Gal}(L/F)$ (where $\\tau(u_0)=\\zeta_7 u_0$) via $\\sigma\\tau\\sigma^{-1} = \\tau^k$, where $\\sigma(\\zeta_7)=\\zeta_7^k$.\n    The action only depends on the action on $\\zeta_7$, so the $C_2=\\mathrm{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q})$ part is in the kernel of $\\phi$.\n    Hence, $G \\cong (C_7 \\rtimes C_6) \\times C_2$. This is isomorphic to the group of affine transformations on $\\mathbb{F}_7$ times $C_2$, i.e., $\\mathrm{Aff}(\\mathbb{F}_7) \\times C_2$.\n\n4.  **Apply Chebotarev Density Theorem:**\n    The natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is given by the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ that act as a single cycle of length 7 on the roots of $f(x)$.\n    Let's find the elements of order 7 in $G \\cong \\mathrm{Aff}(\\mathbb{F}_7) \\times C_2$.\n    An element $(g,h)$ has order $\\mathrm{lcm}(\\mathrm{ord}(g), \\mathrm{ord}(h))$. For this to be 7, we need $\\mathrm{ord}(g)=7$ and $\\mathrm{ord}(h)=1$.\n    The elements of order 7 in $\\mathrm{Aff}(\\mathbb{F}_7)$ are the non-identity translations $x \\mapsto x+b$ where $b\\in\\mathbb{F}_7, b\\ne 0$. There are 6 such elements.\n    The only element of order 1 in $C_2$ is the identity.\n    So, there are $6 \\times 1 = 6$ elements of order 7 in $G$.\n    Any element of order 7 in $S_7$ must be a 7-cycle. So these 6 elements act as 7-cycles on the roots.\n    These 6 elements form a single conjugacy class in $G$. Let's call it $C$.\n    By the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the required density is $|C|/|G|$.\n    Density = $\\frac{6}{84} = \\frac{1}{14}$.\n\nFinal check: The steps are logical, computations standard. The irreducibility of $f(x)$ is key and established. The Galois group structure is derived from the structure of the roots. The counting of relevant elements within the Galois group is straightforward from the group structure. The result is a direct application of the Chebotarev Density Theorem."
