    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical model.** The problem presents a system of linear first-order ordinary differential equations known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman forward equations for a continuous-time Markov chain. The variables $P_i(t)$ represent the probability of the system being in state $i$ at time $t$. The system has four states: 0, 1, 2, 3. The coefficients $\\lambda_{ij}$ are the transition rates from state $i$ to state $j$.\n\n2.  **Verify the consistency of the equations.** The sum of probabilities over all states must be equal to 1, i.e., $P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$. Differentiating this with respect to time $t$ gives $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i'(t) = 0$. Let's check if the given system of equations satisfies this condition.\n    Summing the given equations:\n    $P_0'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)$\n    $P_1'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n    $P_2'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)$\n    $P_3'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n    \n    Summing the right-hand sides:\n    - For $P_0(t)$: $(-\\lambda_{01}) + (-\\lambda_{01}) = -2\\lambda_{01}$\n    - For $P_1(t)$: $(\\lambda_{10}) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12}) + (\\lambda_{12}) = 0$\n    - For $P_2(t)$: $(\\lambda_{21}) - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}) + (\\lambda_{23}) = 0$\n    - For $P_3(t)$: $(\\lambda_{31}) - (\\lambda_{31}) = 0$\n    \n    The sum of the derivatives is $\\sum P_i'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$.\n    For this sum to be zero for all $t$, and given $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019 \\neq 0$, it must be that $P_0(t)=0$. This would lead to a cascade of all probabilities being zero, contradicting $\\sum P_i=1$.\n    This indicates a likely typo in the equation for $P_1'(t)$. The standard form for this equation, which ensures conservation of probability, is:\n    $P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n    With this correction, the sum of the derivatives becomes zero, and the model is consistent. We will proceed with this corrected form.\n\n3.  **Find the steady-state probabilities.** The question asks for $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$. These are the steady-state (or limiting) probabilities. Let's denote them by $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. In the steady state, the probabilities are constant, so $P_i'(t)=0$ for all $i$. The system becomes a set of linear algebraic equations called the balance equations:\n    (i)   $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n    (ii)  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n    (iii) $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n    (iv)  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n    And the normalization condition:\n    (v)   $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n4.  **Solve the system of equations.** We can express $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_2$, and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n    First, substitute the given numerical values:\n    $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\n    From equation (iii):\n    $\\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 = (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n    $0.4 \\pi_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_2$\n    $0.4 \\pi_1 = 0.4 \\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\pi_2$\n\n    From equation (iv):\n    $\\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 = \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n    $0.008 \\pi_2 = 0.008 \\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$\n\n    Therefore, we have the simple relationship: $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\n    From equation (i):\n    $\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 = \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n    $0.019 \\pi_0 = 0.65 \\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1$\n\n5.  **Use the normalization condition.** Substitute the relationships found into equation (v):\n    $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n    $\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n    $\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n    $\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n    $\\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n    $\\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n    This gives $\\pi_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the required value.** We need to find the sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n    First, we find an expression for $\\pi_0$ in terms of our known numbers:\n    $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\left(\\frac{0.019}{0.707}\\right) = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$.\n\n    Now, compute the sum:\n    $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n    $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\n7.  **Final Calculation.**\n    $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of significant figures (e.g., 5), the answer is 0.94625.\n\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
