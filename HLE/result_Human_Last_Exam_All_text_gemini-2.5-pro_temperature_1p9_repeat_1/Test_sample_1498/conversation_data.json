    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the precise range of couplets (bayts) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that mention the names of the Prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Poem's Structure:** 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi is a didactic poem that explains the fundamentals of Islamic creed in a sequential manner. It covers topics like the attributes of Allah, followed by the attributes of the Prophets, and then it lists the 25 Prophets whose names are mentioned in the Qur'an.\n\n2.  **Locate the Introductory Couplet:** Before listing the names, the author provides an introductory couplet indicating that the following verses will detail the names of the 25 obligatory-to-know Prophets. This is **Bayt 28**:\n    > **تفصيلُ خمسةٍ وعشرينَ لَزِمْ *** كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ**\n    > *(The details of twenty-five [Prophets] are necessary /// For every accountable person, so verify and seize [this knowledge].)*\n    **Careful Point:** While this couplet introduces the topic, it does not contain any of the Prophets' names itself. The question asks for the bayts where the *names* are mentioned.\n\n3.  **Identify the Start of the List:** The actual enumeration of the Prophets' names begins in the very next couplet, **Bayt 29**:\n    > **هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ *** صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ**\n    > *(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with /// Salih and Ibrahim; each is to be followed.)*\n    This is the starting point of the list.\n\n4.  **Trace the Continuation of the List:** The names continue over the next several couplets.\n    *   **Bayt 30** lists: Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 31** lists: Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n5.  **Identify the End of the List:** The final couplet that contains names of the Prophets is **Bayt 32**:\n    > **إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى *** عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا**\n    > *(Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, /// 'Isa and Taha [Muhammad], the Seal; leave misguidance.)*\n    **Careful Point:** The name \"Taha\" (طه) is used here to refer to the final Prophet, Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), as is common in devotional poetry. This verse concludes the list of the 25 Prophets.\n\n6.  **Analyze the Concluding Couplet:** The couplet immediately following the list, **Bayt 33**, sends blessings upon them but does not list any more names:\n    > **عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ *** وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ**\n    > *(Upon them be prayers and peace, /// And upon their families, as long as the days endure.)*\n    This confirms that the enumeration of names has finished in the previous couplet.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the explicit mention of the names of the 25 Prophets in Islam begins in Bayt 29 and concludes in Bayt 32.\n\nThe names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam are mentioned from **Bayt 29 to Bayt 32**.\n\n<<<From Bayt 29 to Bayt 32>>>"
