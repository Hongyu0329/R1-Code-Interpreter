    "Answering this question requires finding the value of `a(10)`, where `a(n)` represents the number of distinct `n`-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice, often called a Manhattan lattice.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Definition of a Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):**\n    A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice starting at a fixed origin (e.g., (0,0)) that does not visit the same point (vertex) more than once. The length of the walk is measured by the number of steps (edges) it contains.\n\n2.  **Definition of the Lattice:**\n    A Manhattan lattice is the standard 2D square grid, where points have integer coordinates `(x,y)`, and steps can only be taken to adjacent points (horizontally or vertically).\n\n3.  **Calculation for small `n`:**\n    We can calculate the first few terms of the sequence `a(n)` by direct enumeration.\n\n    *   **a(0):** A 0-step walk simply consists of the starting point. There is only one such walk. So, `a(0) = 1`.\n\n    *   **a(1):** From the origin (0,0), we can take one step in 4 possible directions (North, South, East, West). All are valid.\n        `a(1) = 4`.\n\n    *   **a(2):** We extend each of the 4 1-step walks. From the endpoint of a 1-step walk, we can move in any of the 4 directions. One direction is backward, returning to the origin, which is not allowed in a SAW. The other 3 directions are valid as they lead to new points. For each of the 4 initial walks, there are 3 possible extensions.\n        `a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12`.\n\n    *   **a(3):** We extend the 12 2-step walks. A walk is `p0 -> p1 -> p2`. We need to choose a new point `p3`. The move to `p3` cannot be a reversal (to `p1`) and `p3` cannot be `p0`.\n        - For any 2-step walk, the endpoint `p2` cannot be adjacent to the starting point `p0` (e.g., if `p0=(0,0)`, `p2` can be `(2,0)` or `(1,1)`, neither of which is adjacent to `(0,0)`).\n        - This means none of the 3 non-reversing moves from `p2` can lead back to `p0`.\n        - Therefore, every 2-step walk has 3 valid extensions.\n        `a(3) = 12 * 3 = 36`.\n\n    *   **a(4):** We extend the 36 3-step walks (`p0 -> p1 -> p2 -> p3`). The next point `p4` cannot be `p2`. We must also check if `p4` could be `p0` or `p1`.\n        - On a square lattice, it's impossible for three points `p1, p2, p3` to form a triangle where each is a neighbor of the others. So `p1` and `p3` cannot be neighbors. Thus, a non-reversing move from `p3` can never land on `p1`.\n        - However, `p3` can be a neighbor of `p0`. This occurs for paths that turn back on themselves, like `(0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1)`. The endpoint `p3=(0,1)` is a neighbor of `p0=(0,0)`. There are exactly 8 such 3-step walks. For these 8 walks, one of the 3 non-reversing moves is forbidden (because it leads to `p0`). So, they have only 2 valid extensions.\n        - The other `36 - 8 = 28` walks do not have an endpoint adjacent to the origin and thus have 3 valid extensions.\n        - `a(4) = (8 walks * 2 extensions) + (28 walks * 3 extensions) = 16 + 84 = 100`.\n\n4.  **Complexity for larger `n`:**\n    As `n` increases, this manual enumeration becomes extremely complex. The number of path configurations to consider grows exponentially. Finding a simple closed-form formula for `a(n)` is a famous unsolved problem in combinatorics and statistical physics. Therefore, values for larger `n` are determined by sophisticated computer algorithms that perform exhaustive enumeration.\n\n5.  **Finding a(10):**\n    The question asks for a known, albeit hard to compute, number. This sequence is well-documented in mathematical literature and databases such as the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. Using these established results is the standard approach for finding such values beyond the first few terms.\n\nThe known values for `a(n)` are:\n*   `a(1)` = 4\n*   `a(2)` = 12\n*   `a(3)` = 36\n*   `a(4)` = 100\n*   `a(5)` = 284\n*   `a(6)` = 780\n*   `a(7)` = 2,172\n*   `a(8)` = 5,916\n*   `a(9)` = 16,268\n*   **`a(10)` = 44,100**\n\n<<<44100>>>"
