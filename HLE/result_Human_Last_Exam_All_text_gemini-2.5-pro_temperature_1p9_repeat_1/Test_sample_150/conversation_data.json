    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided program.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Initial State:** A single integer variable `x` is initialized to `0`.\n2.  **Input:**\n    *   An integer `n` on the first line, representing the number of statements to follow (`1 <= n <= 150`).\n    *   `n` subsequent lines, each containing one statement.\n3.  **Statements:** There are four possible statement strings:\n    *   `\"X++\"`: Increments `x` by 1.\n    *   `\"++X\"`: Increments `x` by 1.\n    *   `\"X--\"`: Decrements `x` by 1.\n    *   `\"--X\"`: Decrements `x` by 1.\n4.  **Goal:** Execute all `n` statements and print the final value of `x`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **All four statement variations must be handled.** The operation can be prefix (`++X`, `--X`) or postfix (`X++`, `X--`). Any solution must correctly identify the operation regardless of the position of the `X`.\n2.  **The core logic is simple counting.** The problem reduces to counting the number of increment operations and the number of decrement operations. The final value is `(initial value) + (number of increments) - (number of decrements)`. Since the initial value is 0, it's just `(increments) - (decrements)`.\n3.  **Efficiency:** An optimal solution should be fast and use minimal memory. It should avoid complex string parsing if a simpler method exists. A key observation is that all increment statements contain a `\"+\"` character, and all decrement statements contain a `\"-\"` character. Checking for the presence of just one of these characters is sufficient to determine the operation.\n\n### Analysis of the Submitted Java Program\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Bit\n{\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n    {\n        Scanner inpt = new Scanner(System.in);\n        int t = inpt.nextInt(); // Reads n\n        int tresult = 0; // Our 'x', initialized correctly\n        while (t-- > 0)\n        {\n            String test = inpt.next(); // Reads one statement\n            \n            // This is the logical error\n            if (test.contains(\"++X\"))\n            {\n                tresult++;\n            }\n            if (test.contains(\"--X\"))\n            {\n                tresult--;\n            }  \n        }\n        System.out.println(tresult);\n        inpt.close();\n    }    \n}\n```\n\n*   **Correctness:** The program is **incorrect**.\n*   **Reasoning:** The `if` conditions only check for the presence of the substrings `\"++X\"` and `\"--X\"`.\n    *   If the input statement is `\"X++\"`, `test.contains(\"++X\")` will be false, and `test.contains(\"--X\")` will also be false. No operation is performed, which is wrong.\n    *   If the input statement is `\"X--\"`, similarly, no operation is performed.\n    *   The code only works for the prefix versions (`\"++X\"` and `\"--X\"`) and fails for the two postfix versions (`\"X++\"` and `\"X--\"`). Therefore, it does not solve the problem.\n\n### Efficient C Implementation and Analysis\n\nSince the provided program is incorrect (N), we will design the most efficient C program to solve it and calculate the required metrics `x` and `y`.\n\nAn efficient approach only needs to check one character of the input string to decide whether to increment or decrement. The character at index 1 is always part of the operation (`+` or `-`).\n\n*   For `\"++X\"`, the character at index 1 is `'+'`.\n*   For `\"X++\"`, the character at index 1 is `'+'`.\n*   For `\"--X\"`, the character at index 1 is `'-'`.\n*   For `\"X--`, the character at index 1 is `'-'`.\n\nThis check is sufficient and extremely fast.\n\n#### Calculation of `x` (Smallest Character Comparisons for n=100)\n\nUsing the logic above, for each of the 100 input statements, we only need to perform one character comparison (e.g., `if (statement[1] == '+')`). This is the minimum possible number of comparisons to distinguish the operation type.\nTotal comparisons = `100 statements * 1 comparison/statement` = `100`.\n**Therefore, x = 100.**\n\n#### Calculation of `y` (Smallest Memory Size in Bytes)\n\nTo achieve the minimum memory footprint, we should avoid allocating unnecessary space like a string buffer. We can read from the input stream character by character using `getchar()`.\n\nA C program implementing this would require the following variables:\n1.  `int n;`: To store the number of statements (typically 4 bytes).\n2.  `int x;`: To store the final result (typically 4 bytes).\n3.  `char op;`: A temporary variable inside the loop to store the relevant character (`'+'` or `'-'`) from the input stream (1 byte).\n\nTotal memory for variables = `sizeof(int)` + `sizeof(int)` + `sizeof(char)` = `4 + 4 + 1` = `9` bytes.\nThis represents the smallest possible memory allocation for the program's state.\n**Therefore, y = 9.**\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   The program is incorrect: **N**\n*   `x` = smallest number of character comparisons for n=100: **100**\n*   `y` = smallest memory size in bytes: **9**\n*   The final answer format is `Nx+y`.\n\nCombining these parts gives `N100+9`.\n\n<<<N100+9>>>"
