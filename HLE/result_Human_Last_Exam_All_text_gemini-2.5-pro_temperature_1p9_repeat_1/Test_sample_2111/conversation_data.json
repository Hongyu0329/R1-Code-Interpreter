    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Protagonist:** Fernand Braudel, a historian known for his global perspective.\n*   **Source:** Braudel is quoting another figure, Paul Morand.\n*   **Central Metaphor:** A \"conceptual entity\" must be \"inscribed within a sphere.\" The sphere symbolizes the globe or the world.\n*   **Example:** This entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\"\n*   **The Goal:** Identify this \"conceptual entity.\"\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Source of the Quote**\nThe passage in question comes from the Introduction of Fernand Braudel's book, *The Wheels of Commerce*, which is Volume II of his magnum opus, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*. In this introduction, Braudel is laying out his framework for understanding economic history on a global scale, introducing his concept of the \"world-economy\" (*Ã©conomie-monde*).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Quote and its Context**\nTo argue that historical and economic phenomena must be viewed globally, Braudel invokes a statement by the French writer and diplomat Paul Morand. Braudel paraphrases and expands on Morand's idea:\n\n*   The original French quote from Morand is: \"*Une politique n'a de valeur que mondiale.*\"\n*   This translates to: \"**A policy** is of value only on a world scale.\"\n\nBraudel then elaborates on this point, effectively paraphrasing Morand:\n\"'**A policy** which is not conceived on a world scale,' said Paul Morand, 'and which is not, as it were, inscribed within the terrestrial sphere, is an anachronism destined to collapse, having become as obsolete and ridiculous as the foreign policy of a land-locked state or a ghetto.'\"\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information to Answer the Question**\n*   The \"conceptual entity\" that Morand asserts must be inscribed within a sphere is explicitly identified as \"**a policy**\" (*une politique*).\n*   The question states that this entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This fits perfectly, as a nation carries out various actions through its policies (e.g., foreign policy, economic policy). Morand and Braudel's point is that a nation's policy is meaningless or anachronistic if it is not conceived within a global context.\n*   Therefore, the entity Braudel is referring to, via Morand, is \"a policy.\"\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on a direct analysis of the text where Fernand Braudel quotes Paul Morand, the specific conceptual entity that must be \"inscribed within a sphere\" to have value is **a policy**.\n\n<<<A policy>>>"
