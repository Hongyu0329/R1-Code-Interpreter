    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in its native writing system.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for four key things:\n1.  An **\"earliest known date\"**, implying a specific point in time.\n2.  That was **\"recorded\"**, meaning physically inscribed on an artifact.\n3.  By a **\"pre-Columbian civilization\"** in the Americas.\n4.  Using an **\"aboriginal writing system\"**, not one introduced by Europeans.\n\nThis means we are looking for a specific artifact with a date written in a native script, and that date must be earlier than any other discovered so far.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates and Their Dating Systems**\n\nSeveral Mesoamerican civilizations developed sophisticated writing and calendar systems. The most important system for recording specific, non-repeating dates is the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. This system counts days linearly from a mythical starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar), allowing for the precise dating of historical events.\n\n*   **Maya Civilization:** Famous for their Long Count inscriptions. A very early *Maya* example is **Tikal Stela 29**, which bears the Long Count date 8.12.14.8.15. This correlates to **292 AD**. While old, we must check if there are earlier non-Maya examples.\n*   **Zapotec Civilization:** The Zapotecs developed one of the earliest writing systems. **Monument 3 at San Jos√© Mogote**, an early Zapotec center, contains a carved glyph for the day name \"1 Earthquake.\" It is dated stylistically to around **600 BC**.\n*   **Isthmian or Epi-Olmec Civilization:** This culture, which existed in the former Olmec heartland, also used a version of the Long Count calendar. Several artifacts provide very early dates:\n    *   **La Mojarra Stela 1:** This monument has a Long Count date of 8.5.3.3.5, which corresponds to **143 AD**.\n    *   **The Tuxtla Statuette:** This small artifact is inscribed with the Long Count date 8.6.2.4.17, corresponding to **162 AD**.\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** This is the most crucial artifact for this question. It was discovered in the late 1930s. The monument is broken, but the remaining portion shows a Long Count date that begins with the number **7** for the first and highest-order place value (the *b'ak'tun*).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze and Compare the Candidates**\n\nNow we compare the earliest dates from each candidate.\n\n1.  **Zapotec \"1 Earthquake\" (c. 600 BC):** This is the oldest *calendarial inscription*. However, a key point of careful analysis is what \"a date\" means. \"1 Earthquake\" is a day name within a repeating 260-day cycle. The inscription doesn't specify *which* 260-day cycle it occurred in. Therefore, it's not a unique, historical date in the way a Long Count date is.\n2.  **Long Count Dates (Maya and Epi-Olmec):** These provide unique, absolute dates in a linear count.\n    *   Maya, Tikal Stela 29: **292 AD**\n    *   Epi-Olmec, Tuxtla Statuette: **162 AD**\n    *   Epi-Olmec, La Mojarra Stela 1: **143 AD**\n    *   Epi-Olmec, Tres Zapotes Stela C: The date reads **7.16.6.16.18**. Because the *b'ak'tun* (the first digit) is a \"7,\" it is much older than the other examples, which are all from *b'ak'tun* \"8.\"\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Final Answer**\n\nThe Long Count date on **Tres Zapotes Stela C** (7.16.6.16.18) is the earliest known unambiguous, non-repeating date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system. Using the standard GMT correlation to convert this Long Count date to our calendar, the result is:\n\n**September 3, 32 BC**\n\nThis date predates all other known Long Count inscriptions by over 150 years and is widely accepted by archaeologists and epigraphers as the earliest secure date from the ancient Americas.\n\n<<<September 3, 32 BC"
