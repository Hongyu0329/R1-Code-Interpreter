    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find an approximate analytical solution for the given differential equation in the large $x$ regime.\n\n**1. Analyze the Differential Equation and its Terms**\nThe given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\nwith initial conditions at $x = 0$:\n$y(0) = 0.00$\n$y'(0) = 3.00$\n$y''(0) = 2.00$\n\nThe question asks for an approximate solution in the \"large $x$ regime\". The initial conditions show that the function starts with positive first and second derivatives, suggesting rapid growth. This type of growth in a non-linear ODE often leads to a singularity, where the function goes to infinity at a finite value of $x$, say $x_0$. In this context, the \"large $x$ regime\" refers to the behavior of the solution as $x$ approaches this singularity point $x_0$.\n\n**2. Simplify the ODE for the Large $x$ Regime (near singularity)**\nAs $x$ approaches the singularity at $x_0$, we expect $y(x)$ and its derivatives to become very large. We need to identify the dominant terms in the ODE.\n*   $y^4$ and $y'^4$: These terms will grow rapidly if $y$ and $y'$ grow.\n*   $-\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$: As $x$ approaches a finite $x_0$, the denominator $(3x^2+2)$ remains finite. This term's magnitude is determined by how fast $y''$ grows.\n*   $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$: This term is oscillatory and has its own singularities. However, as $y$ and its derivatives diverge, this bounded (away from its poles) term will become negligible in comparison.\n\nLet's hypothesize a solution of the form $y(x) \\approx A(x_0 - x)^\\alpha$, which is common for solutions with movable singularities. The derivatives are:\n*   $y' \\sim (x_0 - x)^{\\alpha - 1}$\n*   $y'' \\sim (x_0 - x)^{\\alpha - 2}$\n*   $y''' \\sim (x_0 - x)^{\\alpha - 3}$\n\nFor the solution to blow up, we must have $\\alpha < 0$. But here we have $y(0)=0$ and $y'(0)=3$, so $y$ is increasing and becomes positive. A singularity at $x_0>0$ with $y\\to\\infty$ needs $y$ to be defined for $x<x_0$. This power-law ansatz would require $\\alpha$ to be non-integer, for example, to represent this. The analysis below finds $\\alpha=1/3$, which gives a real solution for $x<x_0$. Let's balance the powers.\n*   $y''' \\to (x_0-x)^{\\alpha-3}$\n*   $y^4 \\to (x_0-x)^{4\\alpha}$\n*   $y'^4 \\to (x_0-x)^{4(\\alpha-1)}$\n\nNear the singularity ($x \\to x_0$), the term with the most negative exponent will dominate.\nLet's find a self-consistent balance.\n*   Balance $y'''$ and $y^4$: $\\alpha-3 = 4\\alpha \\implies 3\\alpha = -3 \\implies \\alpha=-1$. Then the exponent for $y'^4$ is $4(-1-1)=-8$. Since $-8 < -4$, the $y'^4$ term would be more dominant, so this balance is inconsistent.\n*   Balance $y'''$ and $y'^4$: $\\alpha-3 = 4(\\alpha-1) \\implies \\alpha-3 = 4\\alpha-4 \\implies 3\\alpha = 1 \\implies \\alpha=1/3$. The exponent for $y^4$ is $4(1/3) = 4/3$. The exponent for $y'''$ and $y'^4$ is $1/3 - 3 = -8/3$. Since $4/3 > -8/3$, the $y^4$ term is less singular (sub-dominant) and can be neglected.\n\nThis leads to a simplified ODE valid near the singularity:\n$y''' \\approx y'^4$\n\n**3. Solve the Simplified ODE**\nTo determine the constant of proportionality $A$ in our ansatz $y(x) \\approx A(x_0 - x)^{1/3}$, we substitute it into $y''' = y'^4$.\n*   $y'(x) \\approx -\\frac{1}{3} A (x_0 - x)^{-2/3}$\n*   $y'''(x) \\approx -\\frac{10}{27} A (x_0 - x)^{-8/3}$\n*   $y'^4(x) \\approx \\left(-\\frac{1}{3} A (x_0 - x)^{-2/3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{A^4}{81} (x_0 - x)^{-8/3}$\n\nEquating the expressions for $y'''$ and $y'^4$:\n$-\\frac{10A}{27} (x_0 - x)^{-8/3} = \\frac{A^4}{81} (x_0 - x)^{-8/3}$\n$A^3 = -\\frac{10 \\times 81}{27} = -30$\n$A = (-30)^{1/3} \\approx -3.1072$\n\nSo, the form of the solution near the singularity is $y(x) \\approx (-30)^{1/3} (x_0 - x)^{1/3}$.\n\n**4. Determine the Singularity Location $x_0$ using Initial Conditions**\nThe location of the singularity, $x_0$, is determined by the initial conditions. A special feature of this problem is revealed by calculating $y'''(0)$ from the full ODE:\n$y'''(0) = y(0)^{4} + y'(0)^{4} - \\frac{y''(0)}{3 (0)^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan(0) + 1}$\n$y'''(0) = (0)^4 + (3)^4 - \\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{1}{0 + 1} = 0 + 81 - 1 + 1 = 81$\n\nNow, let's check the dominant term $y'^4$ at $x=0$:\n$y'(0)^4 = 3^4 = 81$.\nThis means that at $x=0$, $y'''(0) = y'(0)^4$. The simplified model $y'''=y'^4$ is exact at the initial point. We can therefore use it to model the evolution of the function from $x=0$.\n\nLet $u = y'$. The simplified ODE is $u'' = u^4$. We can integrate this once with respect to $x$ after multiplying by $u'$:\n$\\int u'' u' dx = \\int u^4 u' dx \\implies \\frac{1}{2} (u')^2 = \\frac{1}{5} u^5 + C$\nIn terms of $y$, this is $\\frac{1}{2} (y'')^2 = \\frac{1}{5} (y')^5 + C$.\nWe use the initial conditions $y'(0) = 3$ and $y''(0) = 2$ to find the constant $C$:\n$\\frac{1}{2} (2)^2 = \\frac{1}{5} (3)^5 + C \\implies 2 = \\frac{243}{5} + C \\implies 2 = 48.6 + C \\implies C = -46.6$.\n\nThe evolution of $y'$ is thus governed by:\n$(y'')^2 = \\frac{2}{5} (y')^5 - 93.2$.\nSince $y''(0)=2 > 0$, we take the positive root: $y'' = \\frac{dy'}{dx} = \\sqrt{0.4 (y')^5 - 93.2}$.\n\nThe singularity occurs when $y' \\to \\infty$. The time $x_0$ to reach this singularity is found by integrating:\n$dx = \\frac{dy'}{\\sqrt{0.4 (y')^5 - 93.2}}$\n$x_0 = \\int_0^{x_0} dx = \\int_{y'(0)}^{\\infty} \\frac{dy'}{\\sqrt{0.4 (y')^5 - 93.2}} = \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{0.4 u^5 - 93.2}}$\n\n**5. Numerically Evaluate the Integral and State the Final Expression**\nThe integral for $x_0$ does not have a simple closed form and must be evaluated numerically.\n$x_0 = \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{du}{\\sqrt{0.4 u^5 - 93.2}} \\approx 0.2366$\n\nNow, we assemble the complete approximate solution and round the constants to two decimal places as requested.\n$A = (-30)^{1/3} \\approx -3.1072 \\implies A \\approx -3.11$\n$x_0 \\approx 0.2366 \\implies x_0 \\approx 0.24$\n$\\alpha = 1/3$\n\nThe final analytical expression that approximates the solution in the large $x$ regime (approaching the singularity) is:\n$y(x) \\approx -3.11(0.24 - x)^{1/3}$\n\n<<<$y(x) = -3.11(0.24 - x)^{1/3}$>>>"
