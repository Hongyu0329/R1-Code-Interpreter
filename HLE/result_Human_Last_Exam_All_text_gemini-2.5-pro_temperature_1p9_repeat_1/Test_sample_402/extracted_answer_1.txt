A filtering strategy that leverages the distinct signature of the contamination in the differential expression results. First, perform a paired differential expression analysis comparing the CAR-T-IL15 group against the contaminated CAR-T group. Then, using a command-line tool like `awk` on the resulting statistics file, filter for genes that show both a large negative log2 fold change (e.g., L2FC < -5) and a high statistical significance (e.g., FDR < 0.01). This identifies genes highly expressed in the CAR-T group but absent in the CAR-T-IL15 group, consistent with cancer cell contamination. The resulting list of gene IDs should then be used to remove these contaminating genes from the count matrix before conducting any downstream biological analysis. A representative command-line implementation to generate this gene list is: `awk -F'\t' 'NR > 1 && $2 < -5 && $6 < 0.01 {print $1}' de_results.tsv > contaminating_gene_list.txt`, assuming L2FC is in column 2 and FDR is in column 6 of a tab-separated results file.
