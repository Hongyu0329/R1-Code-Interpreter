    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely determined, up to isomorphism, by a partition of $n$. A partition of an integer $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, where the order of the summands does not matter. Partitions are typically written with the summands in non-increasing order, e.g., $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$ and $\\sum_i \\lambda_i = n$. We denote this by $\\lambda \\vdash n$.\n\nFor the symmetric group $S_{25}$, we need to find the number of partitions $\\lambda \\vdash 25$ for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep, denoted $d_\\lambda$, is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is calculated using the Hook-Length Formula:\n$$ d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{i,j}} $$\nwhere the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{i,j}$ is the hook length of that box. The hook length $h_{i,j}$ is the number of boxes to its right in the same row, plus the number of boxes below it in the same column, plus 1 (for the box itself).\n\nA crucial property is that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ (obtained by reflecting the Young diagram across its main diagonal) correspond to irreps of the same dimension, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. Unless a partition is self-conjugate ($\\lambda = \\lambda'$), this means irreps with small dimensions come in pairs. For $n=25$, a self-conjugate partition must have a first part $\\lambda_1$ equal to its number of parts. All the partitions we will find with small dimensions are very \"unbalanced\" and not self-conjugate.\n\nThe dimensions of irreps are smallest for partitions that are \"long and thin\", meaning those with a very large first part $\\lambda_1$ or a very large number of parts (which corresponds to a small $\\lambda_1$ for the conjugate partition). We will systematically search for partitions $\\lambda \\vdash 25$ of the form $(25-k, \\mu)$ where $\\mu \\vdash k$ for small values of $k$.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **k=0: Remove 0 boxes**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$. This corresponds to the trivial representation. $d_{(25)} = 1$.\n    *   $1 < 500,000$. This one counts. Its conjugate is $\\lambda'=(1^{25})$, the sign representation, with $d_{(1^{25})} = 1$.\n    *   **2 irreps found.**\n\n2.  **k=1: Remove 1 box**\n    *   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$. This corresponds to the standard representation of dimension $n-1$. $d_{(24,1)} = 25 - 1 = 24$.\n    *   $24 < 500,000$. This partition and its conjugate $(2, 1^{23})$ count.\n    *   **2 irreps found.**\n\n3.  **k=2: Remove 2 boxes** ($\\mu \\vdash 2$: partitions are (2) and (1,1))\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$. Counts.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1, 1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. Counts.\n    *   Both partitions and their conjugates have dimensions < 500,000.\n    *   **4 irreps found.**\n\n4.  **k=3: Remove 3 boxes** ($\\mu \\vdash 3$: partitions are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1))\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = 2,000$. Counts.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4,025$. Counts.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 1, 1, 1)$: $d_{(22,1,1,1)} = 2,024$. Counts.\n    *   All 3 partitions and their conjugates count.\n    *   **6 irreps found.**\n\n5.  **k=4: Remove 4 boxes** ($p(4)=5$ partitions)\n    *   All 5 partitions $\\lambda=(21, \\mu)$ where $\\mu \\vdash 4$ yield dimensions less than 500,000.\n    *   The dimensions are: 10350, 29900, 23751, 48576, 10626.\n    *   **10 irreps found.** (5 partitions and their conjugates).\n\n6.  **k=5: Remove 5 boxes** ($p(5)=7$ partitions)\n    *   All 7 partitions $\\lambda=(20, \\mu)$ where $\\mu \\vdash 5$ yield dimensions less than 500,000.\n    *   The dimensions are: 40480, 156475, 211876, 168300, 230230, 126500, 42504.\n    *   **14 irreps found.** (7 partitions and their conjugates).\n\n7.  **k=6: Remove 6 boxes** ($p(6)=11$ partitions)\n    *   We test partitions $\\lambda=(19, \\mu)$ where $\\mu \\vdash 6$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,6)$: $d_{(19,6)} = 123,970$. Counts.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,5,1)$: $d_{(19,5,1)} = 560,560$. (> 500,000).\n    *   Checking all 11 partitions reveals that only 3 have dimensions less than 500,000:\n        *   $(19,6)$: dimension 123,970.\n        *   $(19,2,1,1,1,1)$: dimension 480,700.\n        *   $(19,1,1,1,1,1,1)$: dimension 134,596.\n    *   **6 irreps found.** (3 partitions and their conjugates).\n\n8.  **k=7: Remove 7 boxes** ($p(7)=15$ partitions)\n    *   We test partitions $\\lambda=(18, \\mu)$ where $\\mu \\vdash 7$.\n    *   The two \"extreme\" partitions are $(18,7)$ and the hook shape $(18, 1^7)$.\n    *   $d_{(18,7)} = 303,600$. Counts.\n    *   $d_{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. Counts.\n    *   All other 13 partitions of the form $(18, \\mu)$ yield dimensions greater than 500,000. For example, $d_{(18,6,1)} = 1,520,175$.\n    *   **4 irreps found.** (2 partitions and their conjugates).\n\n9.  **k=8: Remove 8 boxes** ($p(8)=22$ partitions)\n    *   We test partitions $\\lambda=(17, \\mu)$ where $\\mu \\vdash 8$.\n    *   $d_{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1,081,575 - 480,700 = 600,875$. This is > 500,000.\n    *   $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471$. This is > 500,000.\n    *   Since the partitions that are most likely to have small dimensions already exceed the threshold, we can safely conclude that no partition with $k=8$ works. The same logic applies for any $k>8$.\n\n10. **Other Partitions**\n    *   The partitions we have not considered are those where the largest part $\\lambda_1 \\le 17$ and the number of parts is also $\\le 17$. These \"squarer\" or more \"balanced\" partitions correspond to irreps with much larger dimensions. For example, the dimension of the irrep corresponding to the \"most square\" partition of 25, $\\lambda=(5,5,5,5,5)$, is enormous ($\\sim 10^{11}$). Therefore, no other partitions will satisfy the condition.\n\n**Final Count:**\nSumming up the number of irreps found in each step:\n*   k=0: 2 irreps\n*   k=1: 2 irreps\n*   k=2: 4 irreps\n*   k=3: 6 irreps\n*   k=4: 10 irreps\n*   k=5: 14 irreps\n*   k=6: 6 irreps\n*   k=7: 4 irreps\n*   kâ‰¥8: 0 irreps\n\nTotal number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 6 + 4 = 48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
