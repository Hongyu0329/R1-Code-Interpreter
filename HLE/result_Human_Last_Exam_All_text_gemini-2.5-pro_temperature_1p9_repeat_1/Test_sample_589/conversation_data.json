    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Query**\nThe question asks for a specific scene with several key elements:\n1.  **A Hollywood feature film:** It must be a full-length movie, not a TV show, short, or independent film.\n2.  **Produced by a major film studio:** This narrows the search to films from producers like Warner Bros., Universal, Disney, Paramount, Sony, etc.\n3.  **A teenager:** The character performing the action is in their teen years.\n4.  **Rides a pink bike:** This is a very specific and memorable visual detail.\n5.  **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car:** This is the central, dramatic action of the scene.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Keyword Association**\nThe combination of \"teenagers,\" \"bikes,\" and \"facing danger\" often brings to mind films like *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* or the Stephen King adaptation *It*.\n*   *E.T.* features an iconic bike scene, but the bike isn't pink and the climax involves flying over the authorities, not riding toward them.\n*   The *It* films (2017 and 2019) feature the \"Losers' Club,\" a group of teenagers who frequently use bicycles and are often pursued by a car driven by the bully Henry Bowers. This makes it a strong candidate.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the 'It' Film Series**\nLet's examine the two recent *It* films to see if they match all the criteria.\n*   The films were produced by New Line Cinema and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, fulfilling the \"major film studio\" requirement.\n*   The characters in the flashbacks are teenagers.\n\nNow, let's look for the specific scene.\n*   In *It Chapter One* (2017), there are bike scenes and confrontations with cars, but none that precisely match the description.\n*   Let's consider ***It Chapter Two*** (2019). While the main plot follows the adult characters, the film contains numerous, extensive flashback scenes to their teenage years.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpointing the Exact Scene**\nIn *It Chapter Two*, there is a specific flashback sequence focusing on the character **Beverly Marsh** (played by Sophia Lillis as a teenager).\n*   **The Context:** Beverly is trying to escape from her abusive father.\n*   **The Bike:** She gets on her bicycle to flee. The bike is a distinct shade of **pink**.\n*   **The Action:** Her father gets into his car and chases her down the street. In a moment of defiance and to ensure her escape, Beverly turns her bike around and pedals **directly toward her father's oncoming car**. Her father is forced to swerve violently to avoid hitting her, causing him to crash.\n\n**Step 5: Verifying All Points**\nLet's check the scene from *It Chapter Two* against the query's checklist:\n*   **Hollywood feature film?** Yes, *It Chapter Two*.\n*   **Major film studio?** Yes, New Line Cinema / Warner Bros.\n*   **Teenager?** Yes, it is teenage Beverly Marsh in a flashback.\n*   **Rides a pink bike?** Yes, her bike is pink.\n*   **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes, this is exactly what she does to her father's car.\n\nThe analysis confirms that all criteria are met by this specific scene.\n\n<<<It Chapter Two>>>"
