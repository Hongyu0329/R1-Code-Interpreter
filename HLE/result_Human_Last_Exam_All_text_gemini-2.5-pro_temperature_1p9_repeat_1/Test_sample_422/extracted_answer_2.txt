The two problems that the JTB definition runs into under these constraints are:

1.  **The Problem of Epistemic Regress/Circularity.** The "Justification" condition is foundational to the JTB definition, but the definition itself offers no way to ground it. To know that a belief is properly justified, one would seem to need a further justification for the validity of that justification. This leads to an infinite regress (a justification for a justification, ad infinitum) or circular reasoning (using an epistemic standard to justify itself), making the justification condition unstable and unworkable as a practical criterion.

2.  **The Devaluation of Justification.** By restricting the available epistemic states to only "Knowledge" and "Belief," the framework is forced to categorize a justified-but-false belief in the exact same state as a completely unjustified belief (a guess or superstition). Both are simply "Beliefs." This is a problem because it fails to recognize the epistemic value of being rational. It implies that justification is worthless unless the belief also happens to be true, which undermines the entire motivation for seeking evidence and forming rational beliefs.
