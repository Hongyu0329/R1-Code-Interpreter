    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify Key Constraints\nThe core of the question is to find two problems with the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge, given a specific and unusual set of constraints.\n\n*   **Core Premise:** Knowledge is defined as Justified True Belief (K = JTB). This means for a subject S to know a proposition p, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  p is true (The Truth condition).\n    2.  S believes p (The Belief condition).\n    3.  S is justified in believing p (The Justification condition).\n*   **Constraint 1:** The *only* available epistemic states are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. This is a highly restrictive and artificial constraint. It means any epistemic stance a person has toward a proposition is categorized as one or the other, with no intermediate states like \"justified belief\" being recognized as a distinct category.\n*   **Constraint 2:** **Ignore Gettier problems.** Gettier problems are scenarios where a person has a justified true belief that is only true by luck, and thus intuitively shouldn't count as knowledge. We must find problems that are not of this specific type.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze for the First Problem – The Unstable Foundation of \"Justification\"\n\nThe JTB definition hinges on the concept of \"justification.\" Let's examine this condition.\n\n1.  To know `p`, my belief in `p` must be justified.\n2.  But how do I know that my justification is a *good* or *valid* justification?\n3.  To ascertain that my justification is valid, I would seemingly need to hold a *justified belief* about the quality of my justification.\n4.  This creates a dilemma:\n    *   **Infinite Regress:** I need a justification (J1) for my belief, a justification (J2) for J1, a justification (J3) for J2, and so on, ad infinitum. An infinite chain of justifications provides no solid ground.\n    *   **Circularity:** I could try to justify my standard of justification by using that very same standard. For example: \"I know my senses are reliable because I have seen that they work.\" This argument is circular because it presupposes the reliability of the senses to prove their reliability.\n    *   **Axiomatic/Dogmatic Stopping Point:** I could simply declare that a certain justification needs no further justification. However, this is an arbitrary, dogmatic assertion that fails to provide a rational basis.\n\nThis fundamental issue, often called the **Problem of the Criterion** or the Agrippan Trilemma, shows that the \"J\" in JTB is not as straightforward as it seems. The JTB definition requires justification but provides no non-problematic account of how justification itself is grounded.\n\n**Conclusion for Problem 1:** The JTB definition relies on a concept of \"justification\" that it cannot self-support without leading to an infinite regress or circular reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze for the Second Problem – The Consequence of the Two-State Constraint\n\nThis problem arises directly from the specific constraint that the only epistemic states are **Knowledge (K)** and **Belief (B)**.\n\n1.  Let's categorize all possible beliefs using the JTB components:\n    *   Case A: Justified True Belief -> This is **Knowledge**.\n    *   Case B: Justified False Belief -> This is not Knowledge (fails the 'T' condition). Per the constraint, it must be categorized as **Belief**.\n    *   Case C: Unjustified True Belief -> This is not Knowledge (fails the 'J' condition). Per the constraint, it must be categorized as **Belief**.\n    *   Case D: Unjustified False Belief -> This is not Knowledge (fails 'J' and 'T'). Per the constraint, it must be categorized as **Belief**.\n\n2.  Notice the consequence: Cases B, C, and D are all collapsed into the single epistemic state of \"Belief.\"\n\n3.  Let's compare Case B (Justified False Belief) with Case D (Unjustified False Belief).\n    *   An example of Case B: A meticulous 18th-century astronomer's belief that planets move in perfect circles, based on all available evidence and rational calculation at the time. This belief is strongly justified but false.\n    *   An example of Case D: A person's belief that a specific lottery ticket will win because the numbers \"feel lucky.\" This belief is unjustified and (almost certainly) false.\n\n4.  Under the given constraints, both the rational astronomer and the superstitious lottery player are in the *exact same epistemic state*: **Belief**. The model fails to recognize any epistemic difference between a rationally held, evidence-based belief and a completely irrational guess, unless the belief happens to be true.\n\n**Conclusion for Problem 2:** The JTB framework, when limited to only the states of Knowledge and Belief, devalues rationality itself. It implies that justification has no epistemic worth on its own; it only matters as a tie-breaker that elevates a true belief to knowledge. This contradicts the strong intuition that having good reasons for a belief is epistemically superior to having no reasons, regardless of whether the belief is ultimately true.\n\n### Final Answer Synthesis\n\nThe two identified problems are distinct, adhere to the constraints of the question, and are not Gettier problems. They target fundamental weaknesses in the JTB definition, with the second problem being a direct consequence of the specific limitations imposed in the prompt.\n\n<<<The two problems that the JTB definition runs into under these constraints are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Epistemic Regress/Circularity.** The \"Justification\" condition is foundational to the JTB definition, but the definition itself offers no way to ground it. To know that a belief is properly justified, one would seem to need a further justification for the validity of that justification. This leads to an infinite regress (a justification for a justification, ad infinitum) or circular reasoning (using an epistemic standard to justify itself), making the justification condition unstable and unworkable as a practical criterion.\n\n2.  **The Devaluation of Justification.** By restricting the available epistemic states to only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" the framework is forced to categorize a justified-but-false belief in the exact same state as a completely unjustified belief (a guess or superstition). Both are simply \"Beliefs.\" This is a problem because it fails to recognize the epistemic value of being rational. It implies that justification is worthless unless the belief also happens to be true, which undermines the entire motivation for seeking evidence and forming rational beliefs.>>>"
