    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\nThe prime power factors of $N$ are $q_1=4$, $q_2=9$, $q_3=7$, $q_4=11$, and $q_5=13$.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$$ \\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13} $$\nwhere $\\chi_q$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $q$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_q$ must be a primitive character of conductor $q$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$$ \\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) $$\n\nWe need this order to be 6. This imposes conditions on the orders of the component characters, which we denote as $o_q = \\text{ord}(\\chi_q)$:\n1.  Each $o_q$ must divide 6.\n2.  The lcm of the orders must contain a factor of 2 and a factor of 3. That is, at least one $o_q$ must be a multiple of 2, and at least one $o_q$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Count Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nWe now count the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor $q$ whose order divides 6. Let $n_d(q)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $q$ of order $d$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=4=2^2$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 4, $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$, is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. It has a principal character (order 1, conductor 1) and a non-principal character of order 2. This second character is primitive with conductor 4.\n    The possible order for a primitive character is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this character is a valid choice.\n    Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: $n_2(4) = 1$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=9=3^2$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. The non-primitive characters are those induced from characters modulo 3. The group of characters modulo 3 has order $\\phi(3)=2$ (orders 1 and 2). Thus, there are $6-2=4$ primitive characters modulo 9.\n    The orders of primitive characters must be divisors of 6 but not 1 or 2. So the possible orders are 3 and 6. Both divide 6.\n    - Number of characters of order 3 in a cyclic group of order 6 is $\\phi(3)=2$. So, $n_3(9)=2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6 is $\\phi(6)=2$. So, $n_6(9)=2$.\n    Total number of choices for $\\chi_9$: $n_3(9) + n_6(9) = 2+2=4$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=7$**:\n    The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. We need to find those with orders dividing 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    - $n_2(7) = \\phi(2)=1$.\n    - $n_3(7) = \\phi(3)=2$.\n    - $n_6(7) = \\phi(6)=2$.\n    Total number of choices for $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=11$**:\n    The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. Primitive characters can have orders 2, 5, 10. We need the order to divide 6. The only possibility is order 2.\n    - $n_2(11) = \\phi(2)=1$.\n    Total number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: $1$.\n\n*   **Conductor $q=13$**:\n    The character group is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. Primitive characters can have orders 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. We need the order to divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    - $n_2(13) = \\phi(2)=1$.\n    - $n_3(13) = \\phi(3)=2$.\n    - $n_6(13) = \\phi(6)=2$.\n    Total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results\nWe need to find the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n\nLet the tuple of orders be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$. From our analysis above:\n- $o_4 \\in \\{2\\}$\n- $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n- $o_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n- $o_{11} \\in \\{2\\}$\n- $o_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nLet's check the lcm condition:\n- Since we must choose a primitive character $\\chi_4$, its order $o_4$ must be 2. This guarantees that the lcm of the orders is a multiple of 2.\n- Similarly, we must choose a primitive character $\\chi_9$. Its order $o_9$ must be 3 or 6. In both cases, $o_9$ is a multiple of 3. This guarantees that the lcm of the orders is a multiple of 3.\n- Therefore, the lcm of the orders is always a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\n\nAlso, every character we are considering has an order that divides 6. Thus, their lcm must also divide 6.\n\nCombining these two facts, the lcm of the orders must be exactly 6 for any valid choice of component characters.\n\nSo, the total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal number = $100$."
