    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the letter formed by the two high school buildings in Pisa.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Schools and Location:** The question specifies two high schools: \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\" and \"Istituto Ulisse Dini\". Both are located in Pisa, Italy, and are next to each other.\n\n2.  **Use a Mapping Tool:** To see the buildings from above, we need to use a satellite imaging tool like Google Maps, Apple Maps, or Bing Maps.\n\n3.  **Locate the Schools:**\n    *   A search for \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti, Pisa\" and \"Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini, Pisa\" on a map reveals they are located in the same building complex at the corner of Via Benedetto Croce and Via Filippo Corridoni.\n    *   This confirms they are indeed \"next to each other\" as stated in the question.\n\n4.  **Switch to Satellite/Aerial View:** By changing the map view from the standard road map to the satellite or aerial imagery layer, we can see the actual shape and layout of the physical buildings.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Shape:**\n    *   Observing the combined structure of the two schools from above, you can see two long, main wings.\n    *   One wing runs roughly north-south (along Via Filippo Corridoni).\n    *   The other wing runs roughly east-west (along Via Benedetto Croce).\n    *   These two long wings meet at a right angle at the corner of the streets.\n\n6.  **Identify the Letter:** This arrangement of two straight lines meeting at a right angle forms a clear and distinct shape of the letter **L**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Perspective is Key:** The question explicitly states \"if seen from above\". A street-level view would not reveal this shape.\n*   **Combined Shape:** The letter is formed by the *combination* of the two school buildings, not just one of them.\n*   **Verification:** This observation can be easily verified by anyone using publicly available online maps.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy locating the two specified schools in Pisa on a satellite map, it is clear that their conjoined buildings form the distinct shape of a capital letter. The two long wings of the complex meet at a right angle.\n\n<<<L>>>"
