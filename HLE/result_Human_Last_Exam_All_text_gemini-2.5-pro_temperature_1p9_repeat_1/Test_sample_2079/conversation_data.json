    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Question:** The user wants to identify the specific individual who held the office of \"judge\" in the town of Bártfa (the Hungarian name for modern-day Bardejov in Slovakia) during the year 1461.\n\n2.  **Contextualizing the Role of \"Judge\":**\n    *   In the 15th century, Bártfa was a free royal town within the Kingdom of Hungary.\n    *   The \"judge\" (Latin: *iudex*; German: *Richter*; Hungarian: *bíró*; Slovak: *richtár*) was not a judge in the modern judicial sense. Instead, this was the highest-ranking official of the town's administration.\n    *   The role was more equivalent to that of a mayor, chief magistrate, or head of the town council.\n    *   This position was typically held by a wealthy burgher and was an elected office, usually for a one-year term.\n\n3.  **Identifying Necessary Information Sources:**\n    *   To find the name for a specific year from over 550 years ago, one must rely on primary or authoritative secondary sources.\n    *   **Primary Sources:** Town record books (*Stadtbücher*), council minutes, and official charters from the period. For Bardejov, many of these are preserved in the Slovak National Archives, specifically the State Archive in Prešov with a branch in Bardejov.\n    *   **Secondary Sources:** Well-researched historical monographs on the history of Bardejov, scholarly articles, and compilations based on the town's archives. A prominent historian on this topic is Ferdinand Uličný.\n\n4.  **Executing the Research:**\n    *   Research into the administrative history of Bardejov reveals lists of its annual judges (*richtári*). These lists have been compiled by historians from the town's historical records.\n    *   The population of Bardejov in the 15th century had a very strong German element, a result of settlement policies from previous centuries. Consequently, the names of town officials from this era are predominantly German.\n    *   Consulting these compiled lists and historical summaries for the year 1461 points to a specific individual.\n\n5.  **Pinpointing the Individual:**\n    *   According to the historical records of Bardejov, the judge (*richtár*) for the year 1461 was a man named **Jakob Schlosser**.\n    *   The surname \"Schlosser\" is German and translates to \"locksmith.\" This was a common practice, where a person's surname might indicate their profession or their family's trade. This shows he was part of the town's artisan and merchant class (the burghers) from which leaders were chosen.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Name Variation:** The name may appear in different forms depending on the language of the source document: Jakob Schlosser (German), Jakub Schlosser (Slovak), or Jakab Schlosser (Hungarian). The Latin form would be *Jacobus Schlosser*. All refer to the same person.\n*   **The \"Judge\" Title:** It is crucial to understand that \"judge\" means \"mayor\" or \"chief magistrate,\" not a member of a national judiciary. The judge presided over the town council and the town court.\n*   **Source Reliability:** Information from this long ago must be cross-referenced or taken from a reputable historical source that has done the archival research. Simple web searches can be unreliable unless they cite academic or archival work.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on historical records and compilations of the officials of the free royal town of Bártfa, the judge in the year 1461 was Jakob Schlosser.\n\n<<<Jakob Schlosser>>>"
