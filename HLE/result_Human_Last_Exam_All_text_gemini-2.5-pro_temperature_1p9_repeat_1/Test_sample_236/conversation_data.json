    "Answering this question requires analyzing the 3-manifolds generated by integral surgery on specific knots and determining which distinct elements they represent in the integral homology cobordism group, $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$):** This is a group whose elements are integral homology 3-spheres (3-manifolds $Y$ with $H_*(Y; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_*(S^3; \\mathbb{Z})$). Two such spheres, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, are equivalent if they are homology cobordant, meaning there exists a 4-manifold $W$ with boundary $\\partial W = Y_1 \\sqcup (-Y_2)$ such that the inclusions $Y_i \\hookrightarrow W$ induce isomorphisms on integer homology. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** Given a knot $K \\subset S^3$, we can perform $p/q$ Dehn surgery. The resulting 3-manifold $S^3_{p/q}(K)$ is an integral homology sphere if and only if the first homology group $H_1(S^3_{p/q}(K);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{|p|}$ is trivial. This requires $|p|=1$. Standard \"integral surgery\" corresponds to $q=1$. Thus, we are looking for the homology spheres generated by $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on the specified knots.\n\n**Step 2: List the knots with at most four crossings**\n\nWe need to consider all distinct knots (including chiral pairs) with crossing numbers $c \\le 4$.\n*   $c=0$: The unknot ($0_1$).\n*   $c=1, 2$: No knots.\n*   $c=3$: The trefoil knot ($3_1$). It is chiral, meaning it exists as a right-handed trefoil ($T_R$) and a left-handed trefoil ($T_L$), which are mirror images of each other.\n*   $c=4$: The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). It is amphicheiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\nSo, the list of knots to analyze is: the unknot, the right-handed trefoil, the left-handed trefoil, and the figure-eight knot.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the homology spheres from each knot**\n\nFor each knot $K$, we form $S^3_1(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$ and find their classes in $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$. We use the identity $S^3_p(K^*) = -S^3_{-p}(K)$, where $K^*$ is the mirror image of $K$ and $-M$ is the manifold $M$ with opposite orientation.\n\n1.  **The Unknot ($U$)**\n    *   $\\pm 1$ surgery on the unknot both yield the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $S^3$ is the identity element in $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$.\n    *   **Elements generated: 1 (the identity).**\n\n2.  **The Trefoil Knots ($T_R$ and $T_L$)**\n    *   For the right-handed trefoil ($T_R$), we get two homology spheres: $S^3_1(T_R)$ and $S^3_{-1}(T_R)$. Let their classes in $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ be $P$ and $Q$, respectively.\n    *   The left-handed trefoil ($T_L$) is the mirror of the right-handed one ($T_L = T_R^*$). Using the identity, we have:\n        *   $[S^3_1(T_L)] = [S^3_1(T_R^*)] = [-S^3_{-1}(T_R)] = -Q$.\n        *   $[S^3_{-1}(T_L)] = [S^3_{-1}(T_R^*)] = [-S^3_1(T_R)] = -P$.\n    *   The set of elements generated by the trefoils is $\\{P, -P, Q, -Q\\}$. We need to check if they are distinct and non-trivial.\n    *   A knot invariant, the Alexander polynomial $\\Delta_K(t)$, can help. If $\\Delta_K(-1) \\ne \\pm 1$, then $S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)$ is not homology cobordant to $S^3$. For the trefoil, $\\Delta_{3_1}(t) = t^{-1}-1+t$, so $\\Delta_{3_1}(-1) = -3 \\ne \\pm 1$. Thus, $P$ and $Q$ (and their inverses) are non-trivial.\n    *   To distinguish them, we use homology cobordism invariants: the Rokhlin invariant $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$ and the Casson invariant $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        *   $P = [S^3_1(T_R)]$ (the Poincare sphere): $\\mu(P)=1, \\lambda(P)=1$.\n        *   $Q = [S^3_{-1}(T_R)]$: $\\mu(Q)=0, \\lambda(Q)=-1$.\n    *   Using the rules $\\mu(-M)=\\mu(M)$ and $\\lambda(-M)=-\\lambda(M)$:\n        *   $-P$: $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (1, -1)$.\n        *   $-Q$: $(\\mu, \\lambda) = (0, 1)$.\n    *   Since all four pairs of $(\\mu, \\lambda)$ invariants—$(1,1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (0,1)$—are distinct, the four elements $P, -P, Q, -Q$ are all distinct.\n    *   **Elements generated: 4 distinct, non-trivial elements.**\n\n3.  **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n    *   This knot is amphicheiral, so $K=K^*$. The identity becomes $S^3_p(K) = -S^3_{-p}(K)$.\n    *   For $p=1$, we get $[S^3_1(4_1)] = -[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$.\n    *   Let $M = [S^3_1(4_1)]$. The surgeries generate the pair of elements $\\{M, -M\\}$.\n    *   For the figure-eight knot, $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = t^{-1}-3+t$, so $\\Delta_{4_1}(-1) = -5 \\ne \\pm 1$. Thus, $M$ is non-trivial.\n    *   Since $\\lambda(M) = -1 \\ne 0$, $M$ cannot be of order 2, so $M \\ne -M$.\n    *   **Elements generated: 2 distinct, non-trivial elements.**\n\n**Step 4: Combine results and check for overlaps**\n\nSo far, we have:\n*   The identity element: $\\{[S^3]\\}$.\n*   From trefoils: $\\{P, -P, Q, -Q\\}$.\n*   From figure-eight: $\\{M, -M\\}$.\n\nWe need to check if any elements from the trefoils are the same as those from the figure-eight. Let's compare their invariants:\n*   $M = [S^3_1(4_1)]$: $\\mu(M)=0, \\lambda(M)=-1$.\n*   $-M = [S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$: $\\mu(-M)=0, \\lambda(-M)=1$.\nComparing these with the trefoil results:\n*   The $(\\mu, \\lambda)$ pair for $M$ is $(0,-1)$, which is the same as for $Q=[S^3_{-1}(T_R)]$.\n*   The $(\\mu, \\lambda)$ pair for $-M$ is $(0,1)$, which is the same as for $-Q=[S^3_1(T_L)]$.\n\nWhile these basic invariants do not distinguish them, finer invariants from Heegaard Floer homology do. The set of d-invariants is a homology cobordism invariant. For $Q=S^3_{-1}(T_R)$, all d-invariants are zero. For $M=S^3_1(4_1)$, the d-invariants are non-zero (the set is $\\{0, -2, -2, \\dots\\}$). Because their sets of d-invariants differ, $Q$ and $M$ represent distinct elements in $\\Theta^3_{\\mathbb{Z}}$. Consequently, $-Q$ and $-M$ are also distinct.\n\n**Step 5: Final count**\n\nThe elements are:\n1.  The identity: $[S^3]$ (from the unknot).\n2.  From the trefoils: $[S^3_1(T_R)]$, $[S^3_{-1}(T_R)]$, $[S^3_1(T_L)]$, and $[S^3_{-1}(T_L)]$. These are 4 distinct non-trivial elements.\n3.  From the figure-eight knot: $[S^3_1(4_1)]$ and $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$. These are 2 distinct non-trivial elements.\n\nAll the non-trivial elements are distinct from each other.\nTotal count = 1 (identity) + 4 (from trefoils) + 2 (from figure-eight) = 7.\n\nFinal Answer: There are 7 distinct elements in the homology cobordism group that can be represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n<<<7>>>"
