The edges of the image become smoother. Convex features (like outward corners and small objects) are eroded and shrink, potentially disappearing entirely. Concave features (like inward corners and holes) are filled in. This process simplifies the shapes in the image by minimizing the total length of the edges, driven by the local curvature of the boundary.
