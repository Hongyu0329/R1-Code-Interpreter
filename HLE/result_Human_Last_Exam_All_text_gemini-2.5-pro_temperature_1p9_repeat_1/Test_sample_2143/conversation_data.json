    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **\"According to Veronika Campan's interpretation...\"**: This suggests the answer is rooted in a specific academic or scholarly analysis. Veronika Campan is a scholar known for her work on the Ten Commandments, particularly in relation to visual culture and interpretation. This directs our focus to the Decalogue (Ten Commandments).\n\n2.  **\"...at the end of HIS work...\"**: We are looking for a male figure. The \"work\" in question is the text or law code that contains the commandments. The \"end\" of this work refers to the concluding parts.\n\n3.  **\"...HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions.\"**: This is a direct reference to the final commandments in the Decalogue. Depending on the religious tradition's numbering, the Ninth and/or Tenth Commandments are \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house\" and \"You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This explicitly deals with \"another's material possessions.\"\n\n4.  **\"And HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"**: This is the crucial clue.\n    *   The \"prohibition against representation\" is the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.\"\n    *   The phrase \"naturally ignoring\" suggests an act that seems to contradict the rule but is considered permissible or necessary within its own context.\n    *   The figure who delivered the Law is **Moses**. According to the biblical narrative, Moses also performed an act that involved creating a representation. In the Book of Numbers (21:8-9), God commands Moses to make a bronze serpent (the Nehushtan) and put it on a pole so that anyone bitten by a venomous snake could look at it and be healed.\n    *   This act of creating an image, done by the lawgiver himself at God's command, is a perfect example of \"naturally ignoring the prohibition.\" It was not for idol worship but for a divine purpose, thus creating a complex exception to the very rule Moses delivered.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The figure described is the lawgiver who delivered the Ten Commandments (which end with rules about possessions) and who also created the bronze serpent (an act of representation). This individual is unequivocally identified in Abrahamic traditions as Moses. His \"full name\" as commonly known is Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
