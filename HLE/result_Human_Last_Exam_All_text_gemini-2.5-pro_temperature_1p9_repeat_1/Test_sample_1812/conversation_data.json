    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks for the determinant of the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". It then explicitly provides a matrix A:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe problem can be broken down into three parts:\n1.  The primary instruction: \"Compute the determinant\".\n2.  The object of the computation: A specific 3x3 matrix `A`.\n3.  Contextual information: \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Question and Identify Careful Points\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the determinant of the matrix `A` that is given. The phrase \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" can be seen as contextual information explaining the origin of matrix `A`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Is the context relevant to the calculation?** The matrix `A` is explicitly defined and has no variables. The term \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) (where 13 is a Markov number) does not appear in the matrix. Therefore, this information identifies the mathematical domain from which the matrix comes but does not alter the matrix itself. The problem is a straightforward determinant calculation.\n*   **What is the matrix `A`?** This matrix is known in mathematics as the Cartan matrix for the affine Lie algebra of type \\( \\tilde{A}_2 \\). This algebraic structure is indeed related to the Markov equation \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz \\), whose integer solutions are related to Markov numbers. A key property of all affine Cartan matrices is that they are singular, meaning their determinant is zero. This provides a good way to check our result.\n*   **Avoid over-complication:** One could get lost trying to construct a matrix based on the term \"Markov quiver\" or the value 13. However, since the matrix is explicitly provided, we should assume the question wants us to work with that specific matrix.\n\nSo, the task simplifies to: Compute \\( \\det(A) \\) for the given matrix `A`.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Determinant\nWe can compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix in several ways. We will use two methods for verification.\n\n**Method 1: Cofactor Expansion**\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:\n\\[\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{pmatrix} = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\\]\nFor our matrix `A`:\n*   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n*   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n*   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nNow, calculate the 2x2 determinants:\n*   \\( \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n\nSubstitute these back into the main equation:\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3) = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0\n\\]\n\n**Method 2: Row/Column Operations**\nThis method is often simpler and less prone to arithmetic error. A property of determinants is that adding a multiple of one row (or column) to another does not change the determinant's value.\nLet's add the second and third rows to the first row (R1' = R1 + R2 + R3).\n\\[\n\\text{Row 1'} = [2 + (-1) + (-1), -1 + 2 + (-1), -1 + (-1) + 2] = [0, 0, 0]\n\\]\nThis gives us a new matrix `A'`:\n\\[\nA' = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant of a matrix with a row of all zeros is always 0. Since row operations do not change the determinant, \\( \\det(A) = \\det(A') = 0 \\). This confirms the result from the first method.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nBoth methods of calculation show that the determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
