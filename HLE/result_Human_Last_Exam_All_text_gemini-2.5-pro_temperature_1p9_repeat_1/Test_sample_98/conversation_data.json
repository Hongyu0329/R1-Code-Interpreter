    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Shape of the Tank**\nThe tank is in the shape of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with the following properties:\n*   It has 20 faces, and all faces are identical equilateral triangles.\n*   It has 30 edges of equal length.\n*   It has 12 vertices.\n*   It is highly symmetrical. A key property is that it has a center of symmetry (or point of inversion). This means for any point on the surface of the icosahedron, there is an identical point on the opposite side, exactly the same distance from the center.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Orientation of the Tank**\nThe tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the 20 equilateral triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, the face directly opposite the base face will also be an equilateral triangle, and it will be perfectly parallel to the base.\n*   The vertical axis of the tank is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry, passing through the centers of the base and top faces.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the \"Half-Filled\" Condition**\nThe tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   The water surface will be a horizontal plane.\n*   We need to find the height of this water level.\n\n**Step 4: Use Symmetry to Find the Water Level**\nAs established in Step 1, the icosahedron possesses a center of symmetry. Any plane that passes through the center of symmetry of a solid object will divide the object's volume into two equal halves.\n*   In the given orientation (standing on a face), the center of symmetry is located exactly halfway up the total height of the icosahedron (i.e., halfway between the plane of the base face and the plane of the top face).\n*   Therefore, a horizontal plane at this mid-height level will pass through the center of symmetry.\n*   This horizontal plane at the mid-height level will bisect the volume of the icosahedron.\n*   This means that when the tank is half-filled, the water surface corresponds to this specific horizontal plane.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Shape of the Water Surface**\nThe shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section of the icosahedron created by this mid-height horizontal plane.\n*   Let's analyze the vertices of the icosahedron. There are 12 vertices in total.\n    *   3 vertices form the triangular base.\n    *   3 vertices form the parallel triangular top.\n    *   The remaining 12 - 3 - 3 = 6 vertices are located between the top and bottom faces.\n*   Because the mid-height plane passes through the center of symmetry and is parallel to the base and top, these 6 intermediate vertices all lie exactly on this plane.\n*   These 6 vertices form the corners of the cross-section.\n*   Due to the 3-fold rotational symmetry of the icosahedron around the vertical axis, these 6 vertices are arranged symmetrically around the center. They form a regular polygon.\n*   A six-sided regular polygon is a regular hexagon. The sides of this hexagon are formed by the intersection of the water-surface plane with the triangular faces of the icosahedron.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhen the icosahedron tank is resting on a face and is half-filled, the water surface is a horizontal plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron. This cross-section is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\\boxed{A regular hexagon}$."
