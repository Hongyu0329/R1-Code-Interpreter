    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide.\n*   **Reagent and Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu or t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Type of Reaction**\nThe reaction of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base leads to an elimination reaction. Given the strong base, the mechanism will be E2 (bimolecular elimination).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Substrate and Its Chair Conformations**\nFor an E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring, there is a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed (a β-proton) must be **anti-periplanar**. This means they must be in a **trans-diaxial** arrangement (one axial-up, the other axial-down).\n\n*   **Relative Stereochemistry:** First, we determine the relative positions of the bromine and methyl groups. For (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, the Br and CH₃ groups are **cis** to each other (both are either pointing 'up' or 'down' relative to the plane of the ring).\n*   **Chair Conformations:** We need to draw the two chair conformations for this *cis* isomer and determine which is more stable.\n    *   **Conformation A:** The bulky methyl group (CH₃) occupies the more stable **equatorial** position. Because the substituents are cis, the bromine (Br) atom must be in the **axial** position.\n    *   **Conformation B (after ring flip):** The methyl group (CH₃) is in the **axial** position, and the bromine (Br) is in the **equatorial** position.\n*   **Stability:** Conformations are more stable when larger groups are in the equatorial position to minimize steric strain. Since the methyl group is bulkier than the bromine atom, **Conformation A is the more stable and predominant conformer.**\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Reactive Conformer and Possible Products**\nThe E2 reaction can only proceed from a conformation where the leaving group (Br) is axial.\n\n*   Conformation B has Br in an equatorial position, so it is unreactive in an E2 elimination.\n*   Conformation A has Br in an axial position, so this is the **reactive conformer**.\n\nNow, we identify the β-protons (protons on carbons adjacent to the carbon bearing the Br) that are anti-periplanar (i.e., axial) to the axial bromine in Conformation A.\n*   **β-Proton on C2:** This carbon has a methyl group in the equatorial position, which means it has a proton in the **axial** position. This proton is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination of this proton leads to a double bond between C1 and C2, forming **1-methylcyclohexene** (the Zaitsev product, a trisubstituted alkene).\n*   **β-Proton on C6:** This carbon has two protons, one equatorial and one **axial**. The axial proton is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination of this proton leads to a double bond between C1 and C6, forming **3-methylcyclohexene** (the Hofmann product, a disubstituted alkene).\n\n**Step 5: Apply Regioselectivity Rules to Determine the Major Product**\nThe choice between the Zaitsev (more substituted) and Hofmann (less substituted) product depends on the base.\n\n*   **Zaitsev's Rule** (favored by small bases) states the more stable alkene is the major product.\n*   **Hofmann's Rule** (favored by bulky bases) states the less sterically hindered alkene is the major product. This is because a bulky base has difficulty accessing the more hindered β-proton.\n\nIn this reaction, the base is potassium tert-butoxide, which is **large and bulky**. It will preferentially abstract the most accessible proton. The β-proton on C2 is sterically hindered by the adjacent methyl group. The β-proton on C6 is much less hindered.\nTherefore, the reaction will favor the removal of the proton from C6, following Hofmann's rule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe major product of the reaction is the less substituted alkene, which is formed by removing the proton from C6.\n\nThe name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
