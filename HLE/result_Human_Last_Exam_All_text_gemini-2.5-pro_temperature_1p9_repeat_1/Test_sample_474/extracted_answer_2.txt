No, this approach is not valid when considering the ecological function of mimicry syndromes.

The core function of a mimicry syndrome is to present a recognizable warning signal to a specific audienceâ€”the community of local predators. The validity of the researcher's method hinges on whether untrained human undergraduates are a suitable proxy for these predators, which they are not for two main reasons:

1.  **Different Visual Systems:** The primary visual predators of bumblebees are birds, which have tetrachromatic vision and can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light. Humans have trichromatic vision and cannot see UV light. Many bumblebee color patterns have significant UV reflectance components. Therefore, two species that appear identical to a human may look very different to a bird, and vice versa. By using human observers, the study ignores an entire visual dimension that is critical for the intended recipient of the mimicry signal.

2.  **"Untrained" Perception vs. Learned Avoidance:** Predators are "trained" by negative experiences (e.g., getting stung) to associate specific patterns with a threat. This learning process determines which visual cues are most salient. Untrained humans have no such ecological training or context. Their judgment of "similarity" is a general aesthetic one and may be influenced by factors that are irrelevant to a predator, such as minor differences in size, posture, or even the background of the photograph, while ignoring the key features that constitute the warning signal.

In summary, the method fails because the chosen observers (humans) are a poor substitute for the actual signal receivers (predators). The resulting clusters would be based on human visual perception, not on the predator perception that drives the evolution and maintenance of mimicry in nature.
