    "Answering this question involves concepts from convex geometry and the geometry of numbers. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Translating the condition\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane `R^2`.\nThe given condition is that `K` intersects every line with equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. Let `u = (p,q)` be a vector of coprime integers. We call such vectors primitive integer vectors. Let `S` be the set of all primitive integer vectors. The line equation is `u · x = 1`.\n\nThe intersection of `K` with the line `u · x = 1` is non-empty. This means that the value `1` must lie within the range of values of `u · x` as `x` varies in `K`. This range is the interval `[inf_{x ∈ K} (u · x), sup_{x ∈ K} (u · x)]`.\nSo, for every `u ∈ S`, we must have:\n`inf_{x ∈ K} (u · x) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_{x ∈ K} (u · x)`\n\nLet `h_K(u) = sup_{x ∈ K} (u · x)` be the support function of `K`. The support function is a key tool in convex geometry. The infimum can be expressed as `inf_{x ∈ K} (u · x) = -sup_{x ∈ K} (-u · x) = -h_K(-u)`.\n\nSo the condition on `K` becomes:\n`-h_K(-u) ≤ 1` and `h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ S`.\n\nThe set `S` of primitive integer vectors is centrally symmetric. If `u = (p,q)` is in `S`, then `-u = (-p,-q)` is also in `S`.\nSo, if we take `u' = -u`, the first inequality `-h_K(-u) ≤ 1` can be written as `-h_K(u') ≤ 1`. But `u'` is also in `S`, so we must also satisfy `h_K(u') ≥ 1`. So, `1 ≤ h_K(u')` and `-h_K(u') ≤ 1` must hold.\nThe condition simplifies. For any `v ∈ S`, we apply the condition for `u=v` and `u=-v`:\n1. `h_K(v) ≥ 1`\n2. `-h_K(-(-v)) ≤ 1` which is `-h_K(v) ≤ 1` or `h_K(v) ≥ -1`.\nThis is always true if `h_K(v) ≥ 1`.\nSo the full condition on `K` is that its support function `h_K(u)` must be greater than or equal to 1 for all primitive integer vectors `u ∈ S`.\n`h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ S`.\n\n### Step 2: The polar body and the dual problem\nTo find the minimum area of `K`, we can analyze the problem in terms of its polar body, `K^*`.\nThe polar body `K^*` of a convex set `K` containing the origin is defined as:\n`K^* = {v ∈ R^2 | v · x ≤ 1 for all x ∈ K}`.\nA fundamental property linking `K` and `K^*` is that `h_K(u) ≤ 1` if and only if `u ∈ K^*`.\nOur condition is `h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ S`. This means that for any `u ∈ S`, `u` cannot be in the interior of `K^*`. If `u` were in `int(K^*)`, then `h_K(u)` would be strictly less than 1.\nSo, the condition on `K` is equivalent to the condition that its polar body `K^*` must not contain any primitive integer vector in its interior: `S ∩ int(K^*) = ∅`.\n\nThe problem is now transformed into: Find a convex set `K` of minimal area, whose polar `K^*` is a convex set containing the origin, such that `int(K^*)` is free of primitive integer points.\n\n### Step 3: Assuming central symmetry\nSuch optimization problems in convex geometry often have a centrally symmetric solution. Let's assume for now that the optimal `K` (and thus `K^*`) is centrally symmetric about the origin.\nThere is a known relation between the areas of a centrally symmetric convex body `K` and its polar `K^*`, the Mahler inequality:\n`Area(K) * Area(K^*) ≥ 8`.\nEquality holds if and only if `K` (and `K^*`) is a parallelogram.\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we should try to maximize `Area(K^*)`.\n`Area(K) ≥ 8 / Area(K^*)`.\n\nSo our problem becomes: Find the maximum possible area of a centrally symmetric convex body `K^*` whose interior does not contain any primitive integer points.\n\n### Step 4: Maximizing the area of the polar body\nThis is a classic problem in the geometry of numbers.\nAccording to Minkowski's convex body theorem, any centrally symmetric convex set `C` with `Area(C) > 4` must contain a non-zero integer point `z = (m,n)`.\nIf `z` is such a point, let `d = gcd(m,n)`. Then `u = z/d = (m/d, n/d)` is a primitive integer point. Since `C` is convex and contains the origin, the line segment `[0, z]` lies in `C`. The point `u` lies on this segment, so `u` is also in `C`.\nTherefore, if `Area(C) > 4`, it must contain a primitive integer point. If `C` is open, it will contain a primitive integer point.\nThis implies that if `int(K^*)` is to contain no primitive integer points, we must have `Area(K^*) ≤ 4`.\n\nThe maximum possible area is `Area(K^*) = 4`. This maximum is achieved, for instance, by the square `Q = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`. The interior of `Q` is the open square `(-1, 1) × (-1, 1)`, which contains only the integer point `(0,0)`, which is not a primitive vector.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the minimal area\nWe have found that `max Area(K^*) = 4`. Plugging this into the inequality:\n`min Area(K) ≥ 8 / 4 = 2`.\n\nThis lower bound of 2 is achievable if we can find a body `K` such that `K^*` has area 4 and the equality `Area(K)Area(K^*) = 8` holds. As mentioned, this equality holds for parallelograms. The square `K^* = Q = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]` is a parallelogram.\nSo, let's find the polar dual of this square.\n`K = Q^* = {x ∈ R^2 | u · x ≤ 1 for all u ∈ Q}`.\n`sup_{u ∈ Q} (u_x x + u_y y) = sup_{|u_x|≤1, |u_y|≤1} (u_x x + u_y y) = |x| + |y|`.\nSo, `K` is the set of points `x` such that `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\nThis is a square (often called a diamond) with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\n\nThe area of this diamond `K` is `2`.\nThe area of `K^*=Q` is `4`.\n`Area(K) * Area(K^*) = 2 * 4 = 8`, so the equality condition is met.\n\n### Step 6: Final check and conclusion\nWe have established a lower bound of 2 for the area of any such centrally symmetric convex body. We have also constructed a specific body, the diamond `|x|+|y|≤1`, that has an area of exactly 2 and satisfies the given conditions.\nLet's double-check that the diamond works. For `K = {|x|+|y|≤1}`, the support function is `h_K(p,q) = max(|p|,|q|)`. The condition for it to be a solution is `-h_K(-p,-q) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(p,q)`.\n`h_K(-p,-q) = max(|-p|,|-q|) = max(|p|,|q|)`.\nSo the condition is `-max(|p|,|q|) ≤ 1 ≤ max(|p|,|q|)`. This simplifies to `max(|p|,|q|) ≥ 1`.\nFor any pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`, they cannot both be zero. So at least one of `p` or `q` is a non-zero integer, meaning `|p|≥1` or `|q|≥1`. Thus `max(|p|,|q|) ≥ 1` is always true for `(p,q) ∈ S`.\nThe diamond `|x|+|y|≤1` is indeed a valid domain.\n\nAlthough we assumed central symmetry, it can be proven (using the Brunn-Minkowski inequality) that the minimal domain must be centrally symmetric. Therefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$."
