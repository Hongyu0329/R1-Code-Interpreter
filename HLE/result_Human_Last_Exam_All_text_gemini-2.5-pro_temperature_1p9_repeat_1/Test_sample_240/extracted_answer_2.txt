The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance when probed is due to active decoupling circuits. These circuits, typically using PIN diodes, intentionally detune the coil or spoil its Q-factor to prevent damage and patient burns during the MRI's high-power transmit pulse. When testing on a bench, the coil does not receive the necessary DC bias from the scanner to switch off these decoupling circuits. Therefore, the coil remains in its safe, non-resonant default state. A secondary reason is the presence of integrated preamplifiers that must be powered on to provide the correct impedance termination for the coil to resonate properly, a condition also not met in a simple bench test.
