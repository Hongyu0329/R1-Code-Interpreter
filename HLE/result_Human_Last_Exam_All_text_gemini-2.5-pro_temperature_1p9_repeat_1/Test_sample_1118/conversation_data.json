    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the subject, artwork, and context:** The question concerns a self-portrait by the German painter Curt Querner, painted in 1933. The crucial context provided is that he painted it after escaping from the Gestapo (or more accurately, the SA, the Nazi paramilitary force at the time).\n\n2.  **Locate and examine the specific painting:** The painting in question is Querner's \"Self-Portrait with Pipe\" (Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife) from 1933. It is one of his most famous works.\n\n3.  **Analyze the visual details of the portrait:**\n    *   The portrait shows Querner looking directly and defiantly at the viewer. His expression is stern and intense.\n    *   His face appears worn, reflecting the hardship and torture he endured during his imprisonment.\n    *   He has two hands visible in the portrait. In his right hand, raised towards his mouth, he is holding a pipe.\n    *   His left hand, resting on his leg, is tightly clenched into a fist.\n\n4.  **Interpret the symbolism, especially in relation to \"resistance\":**\n    *   **The Pipe:** While he is physically holding a pipe, this is generally seen as a symbol of a more personal, everyday life—perhaps an attempt to reclaim a sense of normalcy and individual identity in the face of persecution. It's not typically considered a direct symbol of political resistance.\n    *   **The Clenched Fist:** This is the critical element. The clenched fist was, and still is, a powerful and widely recognized international symbol of solidarity, strength, and defiance. In the 1930s, it was specifically associated with socialist, communist, and anti-fascist movements, such as the German Communist Party's (KPD) \"Roter Frontkämpferbund\" (Red Front Fighters' League), to which Querner belonged. By painting his hand in this manner, he was making a clear and dangerous political statement of continued opposition to the Nazi regime.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the findings to answer the question:** The question asks what he holds in his hand \"as a symbol of resistance.\" While he literally holds a pipe in one hand, the intended and unmistakable symbol of resistance in the painting is the clenched fist he forms with his other hand. It is this gesture, not the pipe, that communicates his unbroken spirit and political defiance.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<A clenched fist>>>"
