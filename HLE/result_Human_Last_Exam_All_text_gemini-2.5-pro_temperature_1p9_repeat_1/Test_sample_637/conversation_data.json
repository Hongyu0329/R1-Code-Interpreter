    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to design an observer for the given discrete-time system such that the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` becomes zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is known as designing a **deadbeat observer**.\n\nThe standard form of a discrete-time observer is:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - Cx_hat(k))`\nwhere `L` is the observer gain matrix we need to find.\n\nThe dynamics of the observation error `e(k)` are given by:\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nFor the error to become identically zero in a finite number of steps, the error dynamics matrix `(A - LC)` must be nilpotent, meaning `(A - LC)^N = 0` for some integer `N`. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues (poles) of the matrix `(A - LC)` at the origin (`λ=0`).\n\n### **2. Check for Observability**\n\nBefore designing an observer, we must confirm that the system is observable. The system is observable if its observability matrix `O` has full rank, which is `n=4` (the dimension of the state vector `x`).\nThe observability matrix is: `O = [C; CA; CA^2; CA^3]`\n\n*   `A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`\n*   `C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\nCalculating `CA`:\n`CA = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\n\nA sub-matrix of `O` is `[C; CA]`:\n`[C; CA] = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\nThe rank of this 4x4 matrix can be shown to be less than 4 (e.g., Row 1 is the same as Row 3). To check for full system observability, we would need to continue calculating `CA^2`, `CA^3`. However, we will use a simpler approach that bypasses the need for the full observability matrix. The successful design of the deadbeat observer will itself prove that the system is observable.\n\n### **3. Problem Simplification via Output Transformation**\n\nA direct calculation of `L` is algebraically complex. We can simplify the problem by noticing the structure of the output matrix `C`.\nThe outputs are:\n`y1(k) = x1(k)`\n`y2(k) = x1(k) + x4(k)`\n\nFrom these equations, we can directly solve for two of the state variables:\n`x1(k) = y1(k)`\n`x4(k) = y2(k) - y1(k)`\n\nThis suggests we can define a new output vector `y_new(k)` that consists of the directly \"measured\" states:\n`y_new(k) = [x1(k); x4(k)]`\n\nWe can relate `y_new` to `y` with a linear transformation matrix `T`:\n`y_new = T*y = [1 0; -1 1] * [y1; y2] = [y1; y2-y1] = [x1; x4]`\nSo, `T = [1 0; -1 1]`.\n\nThe new output matrix `C_new` is then:\n`C_new = T*C = [1 0; -1 1] * [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] = [1 0 0 0; 0 0 0 1]`\n\nNow, we will design an observer with gain `L_new` for the system `(A, B, C_new)`. The gain `L` for the original system can then be found from the relationship `L = L_new * T`.\n\n### **4. Design the Deadbeat Observer for the Simplified System**\n\nWe need to find a 4x2 matrix `L_new` such that `F_new = A - L_new*C_new` has all its eigenvalues at 0.\n`L_new = [l'_11 l'_12; l'_21 l'_22; l'_31 l'_32; l'_41 l'_42]`\n`C_new = [1 0 0 0; 0 0 0 1]`\n\nThe product `L_new*C_new` is:\n`L_new*C_new = [l'_11 0 0 l'_12; l'_21 0 0 l'_22; l'_31 0 0 l'_32; l'_41 0 0 l'_42]`\n\nNow we compute `F_new = A - L_new*C_new`:\n`F_new = [-1-l'_11   0       0       1-l'_12;`\n        `1-l'_21    0       0       2-l'_22;`\n        `-l'_31     1       0       -1-l'_32;`\n        `-1-l'_41   0       1       -1-l'_42]`\n\nFor `F_new` to have all eigenvalues at 0, a simple approach is to choose `L_new` to make `F_new` a lower triangular matrix with all zeros on its diagonal.\n\n*   **Set upper-off-diagonal elements to zero:**\n    *   `F_new(1,4) = 1 - l'_12 = 0`  =>  `l'_12 = 1`\n    *   `F_new(2,4) = 2 - l'_22 = 0`  =>  `l'_22 = 2`\n    *   `F_new(3,4) = -1 - l'_32 = 0` =>  `l'_32 = -1`\n    (The other upper-off-diagonal elements are already zero).\n\n*   **Set diagonal elements to zero:**\n    *   `F_new(1,1) = -1 - l'_11 = 0` =>  `l'_11 = -1`\n    *   `F_new(2,2) = 0` (already zero)\n    *   `F_new(3,3) = 0` (already zero)\n    *   `F_new(4,4) = -1 - l'_42 = 0` =>  `l'_42 = -1`\n\nThe remaining elements of `L_new` (`l'_21`, `l'_31`, `l'_41`) can be chosen arbitrarily. For simplicity, we set them to zero.\n\nThis gives the gain matrix for the simplified system:\n`L_new = [-1  1;`\n         ` 0  2;`\n         ` 0 -1;`\n         ` 0 -1]`\n\nWith this `L_new`, the observer error matrix `F_new` becomes:\n`F_new = [0 0 0 0; 1 0 0 0; 0 1 0 0; -1 0 1 0]`\nThis is a lower triangular matrix with zeros on the diagonal. Its characteristic polynomial is `det(λI - F_new) = λ^4`, confirming all eigenvalues are at the origin.\n\n### **5. Transform the Gain Back to the Original System**\n\nFinally, we compute the required gain matrix `L` using the transformation `L = L_new * T`.\n`L = [-1  1; 0  2; 0 -1; 0 -1] * [1 0; -1 1]`\n\n*   Row 1: `[-1*1 + 1*(-1), -1*0 + 1*1] = [-2, 1]`\n*   Row 2: `[ 0*1 + 2*(-1),  0*0 + 2*1] = [-2, 2]`\n*   Row 3: `[ 0*1 + (-1)*(-1),  0*0 + (-1)*1] = [1, -1]`\n*   Row 4: `[ 0*1 + (-1)*(-1),  0*0 + (-1)*1] = [1, -1]`\n\nSo, the observer gain matrix is:\n`L = [-2 1; -2 2; 1 -1; 1 -1]`\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\n<<<[-2 1; -2 2; 1 -1; 1 -1]>>>"
