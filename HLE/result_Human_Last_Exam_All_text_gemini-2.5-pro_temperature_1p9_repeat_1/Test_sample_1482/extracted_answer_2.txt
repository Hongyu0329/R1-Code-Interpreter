The mathematical formulation for the lower bound (`underline{f}_{x'}(u)`) and upper bound (`overline{f}_{x'}(u)`) of the vertical cross-section of a Gaussian-based Interval Type-3 Membership Function at a fixed primary input `x'` is given by the following pair of equations:

`overline{f}_{x'}(u) = u^{α_u} * exp( - (x' - c)² / (2 * σ_{upper}²) )`
`underline{f}_{x'}(u) = u^{α_l} * exp( - (x' - c)² / (2 * σ_{lower}²) )`

where:
*   `x'` is the fixed value of the primary input variable.
*   `u ∈ [0, 1]` is the secondary variable parameterizing the uncertainty level.
*   `c` is the center of the Gaussian functions.
*   `σ_{upper}` and `σ_{lower}` are the standard deviations for the upper and lower membership functions, respectively, with the constraint that `σ_{lower} ≥ σ_{upper}`.
*   `α_u > 0` and `α_l > 0` are parameters that control the shape of the scaling with respect to `u`.
