    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\n*   **Graph:** We are considering a mathematical structure G = (V, E) where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges connecting pairs of vertices.\n*   **Number of vertices:** The size of the set V is fixed at n = 128.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size *k* is a complete graph, denoted *K_k*.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** An induced subgraph on a subset of vertices S ⊆ V consists of the vertices in S and *all* the edges from the original graph G that connect vertices in S. By definition, if a set of *k* vertices forms a clique in G, it automatically forms an induced subgraph that is a *K_k*.\n*   **The Goal:** We want to find the maximum possible count of *different* integers *k* (where *k* is a clique size) that can exist simultaneously in a single graph with 128 vertices.\n\n**2. Identifying Key Concepts and Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: What is the set of possible clique sizes?**\n    Let's denote the set of clique sizes that appear in a graph G as *C(G)*. For example, if a graph has cliques of size 3 and 5 (and nothing larger), *C(G)* would contain 3 and 5.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The structure of the set of clique sizes.**\n    Let *ω(G)* be the clique number of the graph G, which is the size of the largest clique in G.\n    *   If a graph G contains a clique of size *ω(G)*, let's call the set of vertices in this clique *S_max*.\n    *   Any subset of *S_max* also forms a clique. If we take any subset of *S_max* with size *k* (where 1 ≤ *k* ≤ *ω(G)*), these *k* vertices are all connected to each other and thus form a clique of size *k*.\n    *   This means that if a graph has a maximum clique of size *ω(G)*, it is guaranteed to also have cliques of all sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., *ω(G)*.\n*   **Careful Point 3: The implication for our problem.**\n    From the previous point, the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph G is always of the form {1, 2, 3, ..., *ω(G)*}. There are no \"gaps\" in the set of sizes. For instance, it's impossible for a graph to have a clique of size 5 but no clique of size 4.\n    Therefore, the number of different clique sizes that appear in G is simply equal to its clique number, *ω(G)*.\n\n**3. Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\n*   **Step 1: Reformulating the problem.**\n    Based on the analysis above, the problem \"Determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\" is equivalent to the simpler problem \"Determine the maximum possible clique number, *ω(G)*, for a graph G on n = 128 vertices.\"\n\n*   **Step 2: Finding the maximum clique number.**\n    The clique number *ω(G)* of a graph G on *n* vertices is the size of its largest clique. A clique is a subset of the vertices. Therefore, the size of a clique cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph.\n    So, for any graph G with n = 128 vertices, the clique number *ω(G)* must be less than or equal to 128.\n    *ω(G)* ≤ 128.\n\n*   **Step 3: Constructing a graph that achieves the maximum.**\n    We need to show that this maximum value of 128 is actually achievable. Consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted *K_128*. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    *   The entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique of size 128.\n    *   Thus, the clique number of *K_128* is *ω(K_128)* = 128.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\n    Since the maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices is 128, and the number of different clique sizes is equal to the clique number, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128. This is achieved by the complete graph *K_128*, which contains induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., all the way up to 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
