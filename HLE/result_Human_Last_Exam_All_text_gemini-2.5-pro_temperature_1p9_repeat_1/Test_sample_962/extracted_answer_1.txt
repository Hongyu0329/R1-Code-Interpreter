The design consists of using a Schnorr-like signature scheme on a cryptographic group, with a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol based on Verifiable Secret Sharing to establish a shared public key and individual secret shares. The two-round signing protocol, based on the FROST scheme, proceeds as follows:
**Round 1 (Commitment):** Each of the `t` signing parties generates nonce components `(d_i, e_i)` and broadcasts public commitments to them, `(D_i, E_i)`.
**Round 2 (Response):** After receiving all commitments, each party computes a common binding factor `b` by hashing the message and all commitments, computes the group nonce `R`, the challenge `c`, and then calculates and broadcasts its signature share `z_i = d_i + (e_i * b) + (c * L_i * sk_i)`, where `L_i` is the party's Lagrange coefficient and `sk_i` is its secret share.
A signature aggregator verifies each share, then computes the final signature `(R, s)` where `s` is the sum of the shares.
This design is tightly secure because, while traditional proofs offer loose reductions, modern analyses using the Algebraic Group Model (AGM) have demonstrated that this protocol structure admits a tight security reduction to the discrete logarithm problem.
