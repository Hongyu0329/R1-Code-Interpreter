    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know whose lectures Albert Einstein cited or referenced in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Paper:** The paper in question is one of Einstein's 1905 *Annus Mirabilis* (Miracle Year) papers, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n3.  **Analyze the Phrasing:** The term \"lectures\" is crucial. This could mean either:\n    a) Lectures that Einstein personally attended.\n    b) A published work with \"Lectures\" in its title.\n\n4.  **Investigate the Paper's Theoretical Foundation:** Einstein's paper on Brownian motion is a landmark work in statistical mechanics. It aimed to provide a theoretical explanation for the random, jittery movement of particles suspended in a fluid, thereby providing strong evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules. The intellectual framework for this field was primarily established by James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n5.  **Examine the Citations and Influences:**\n    *   Einstein's early papers are famous for having very few citations. He often built his arguments from fundamental principles.\n    *   Historians of science have established that Einstein's work in statistical mechanics was profoundly influenced by the work of **Ludwig Boltzmann**.\n    *   While Einstein did not personally attend lectures given by Boltzmann, he meticulously studied Boltzmann's published works.\n\n6.  **Connect the Influence to the term \"Lectures\":**\n    *   One of Ludwig Boltzmann's most important and influential works was his two-volume book, ***Vorlesungen über Gastheorie***, published in 1896 and 1898.\n    *   The title of this book translates directly to ***Lectures on Gas Theory***.\n    *   Einstein's paper on Brownian motion is a direct application and development of the principles of statistical mechanics that Boltzmann laid out in his *Lectures on Gas Theory*. The methods and concepts Einstein used are deeply rooted in Boltzmann's work.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Direct vs. Indirect Citation:** While there may not be a formal citation in the modern sense (e.g., \"Boltzmann, L. (1896)...\"), the intellectual debt is clear and acknowledged by historians. The theoretical framework of Einstein's paper is Boltzmanian.\n*   **The Meaning of \"Lectures\":** The question is elegantly answered by the fact that Boltzmann's seminal text on the subject is literally titled \"Lectures,\" making it the most accurate answer for whose \"lectures\" were foundational to Einstein's paper.\n*   **Excluding Other Possibilities:** While Einstein was influenced by others like Maxwell, Kirchhoff, and Helmholtz, the specific connection to a work titled \"Lectures\" that is directly relevant to the topic of statistical mechanics points uniquely to Boltzmann. Einstein famously claimed he was unaware of Robert Brown's original observations when he wrote the paper.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nBy applying the molecular-kinetic theory of heat to Brownian motion, Einstein drew heavily upon the statistical framework developed by Ludwig Boltzmann. This framework was most famously articulated in Boltzmann's published book, *Lectures on Gas Theory*. Therefore, the lectures Einstein cited were those of Ludwig Boltzmann, in the form of his published work.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
