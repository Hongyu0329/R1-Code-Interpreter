    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph Structure (Barbell Graph):**\n    *   A barbell graph is constructed from two identical complete graphs (cliques) that are connected by a single edge (a bridge).\n    *   The total number of nodes is 10.\n    *   This means the graph consists of two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (let's call them K5-A and K5-B).\n    *   A single edge, known as the \"bottleneck edge,\" connects one node from K5-A to one node from K5-B.\n    *   Let's label the nodes. Nodes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are in K5-A and nodes {6, 7, 8, 9, 10} are in K5-B.\n    *   Without loss of generality, let the bottleneck edge connect node 5 and node 6. So, the edge is (5, 6).\n\n2.  **Calculate Node Degrees:**\n    The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. This is a critical piece of information because the gossiping protocol depends on it.\n    *   **Nodes at the ends of the bottleneck edge (nodes 5 and 6):**\n        *   Consider node 5. It is in the complete graph K5-A, so it's connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique ({1, 2, 3, 4}).\n        *   It is also connected to node 6 via the bottleneck edge.\n        *   Therefore, the degree of node 5, `d(5)`, is 4 + 1 = 5.\n        *   By symmetry, the degree of node 6, `d(6)`, is also 5.\n    *   **All other nodes (nodes {1,2,3,4} and {7,8,9,10}):**\n        *   Consider node 1. It is in the complete graph K5-A. It is connected only to the other 4 nodes within its own clique.\n        *   Therefore, the degree of node 1, `d(1)`, is 4.\n        *   This is true for all 8 nodes that are not endpoints of the bottleneck edge.\n\n3.  **Understand the Randomized Uniform Gossiping Protocol:**\n    A single step of this protocol consists of two actions:\n    *   **Action 1:** A node is chosen uniformly at random from all `N` nodes. Since `N = 10`, the probability of picking any specific node is `1/10`.\n    *   **Action 2:** The chosen node then selects one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random. The probability of it choosing a specific neighbor is `1 / (degree of the chosen node)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge (5, 6):**\n    The bottleneck edge (5, 6) is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n    *   **Event A:** Node 5 is chosen first, and then it chooses its neighbor, node 6.\n    *   **Event B:** Node 6 is chosen first, and then it chooses its neighbor, node 5.\n\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events: `P(sample edge) = P(Event A) + P(Event B)`.\n\n    *   **Calculate P(Event A):**\n        *   Probability of choosing node 5 = `1/10`.\n        *   Given node 5 is chosen, the probability it chooses node 6 is `1 / d(5) = 1/5`.\n        *   `P(Event A) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n    *   **Calculate P(Event B):**\n        *   Probability of choosing node 6 = `1/10`.\n        *   Given node 6 is chosen, the probability it chooses node 5 is `1 / d(6) = 1/5`.\n        *   `P(Event B) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n    *   **Calculate Total Probability:**\n        *   `P(sampling the bottleneck edge) = P(Event A) + P(Event B) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50`.\n        *   Simplifying the fraction gives `1/25`.\n\n### **Summary of Careful Points**\n*   **Graph Construction:** Correctly identifying that a 10-node barbell graph means two K5 cliques is the first crucial step.\n*   **Degree Calculation:** The degrees are not uniform across the graph. The two nodes on the bottleneck edge have a higher degree (5) than the other eight nodes (degree 4). A miscalculation here would lead to an incorrect final answer.\n*   **Sampling Process:** It's important to remember the two-step nature of the gossiping protocol: first pick a node from the whole graph, then pick a neighbor of that node. The probability of sampling an edge (u, v) is not simply `1/|E|` (where |E| is the number of edges).\n*   **Symmetry:** Recognizing that the problem is symmetric (i.e., picking node 5 then 6 is one possibility, and picking 6 then 5 is another) is key to a complete calculation. Both scenarios must be included.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is `2/50`, which simplifies to `1/25`. As a decimal, this is 0.04.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
