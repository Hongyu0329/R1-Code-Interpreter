    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Task:** Identify a specific character.\n    *   **Condition 1:** The character must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Condition 2:** The character describes Roman religious practices or iconography.\n    *   **Condition 3:** This description must be a clear reference to the foundation myth of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Contextualize the Novel:**\n    *   *The House of the Wolfings* is set during the late Roman Empire and tells the story of a Gothic tribe (the Wolfings) resisting a Roman invasion.\n    *   A central element of the Wolfings' identity is their reverence for wolves; they believe they are descended from a divine wolf ancestor. This makes any encounter with the Roman wolf myth particularly significant, as it would be viewed through their own cultural lens.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Scene:**\n    *   The logical place to find such a discussion would be where the characters are talking about their enemies, the Romans.\n    *   This occurs early in the book, specifically in **Chapter IV: \"They talk of the Romans.\"** In this chapter, the elders and warriors of the Wolfings gather to discuss the approaching Roman threat and share what they know about them.\n\n4.  **Identify the Character and their Testimony:**\n    *   During the discussion in Chapter IV, several characters speak. One of them is an elder named **Otter**.\n    *   Otter is established as a character who has travelled widely and has been within the borders of the Roman Empire, giving him firsthand knowledge that others lack.\n    *   He speaks about Roman culture, their skills in building, but also their perceived decadence and cruelty.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Specific Description:**\n    *   To illustrate the Romans' nature, Otter describes something he saw in one of their cities. He says he has seen an image of **\"a she-wolf giving suck to two man-babes.\"**\n    *   This description is a direct and unmistakable reference to the *Lupa Capitolina* (Capitoline Wolf), the iconic bronze sculpture depicting the she-wolf nursing the infant twins, Romulus and Remus.\n    *   Otter interprets this image negatively, from his perspective as a \"true\" child of the wolf. He suggests it shows the Romans are not noble descendants of the Wolf, but rather lowly \"cubs of the she-wolf,\" implying a base and unnatural origin.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The character who visited a Roman city and describes their iconography in a way that refers to Romulus and Remus is the elder, Otter. He does so in Chapter IV of the novel.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Allusion, Not Direct Naming:** The character Otter does not use the names \"Romulus\" or \"Remus.\" The question correctly states that the description allows readers to *recognize* the story. The power of the passage comes from this allusion.\n*   **Cultural Contrast:** The entire point of Otter's story is to contrast the Wolfings' \"noble\" divine wolf ancestry with the Romans' \"base\" beast-nursed origins. This is a key theme in the book.\n*   **Character Identification:** While Thiodolf is the protagonist, he is not the one who provides this specific piece of intelligence. The information comes from the traveled elder, Otter, lending his words the authority of an eyewitness.\n\nThe character who fulfills all the conditions of the question is Otter.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
