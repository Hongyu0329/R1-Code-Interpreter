    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the common name for the genus *Perdita* and when it was coined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Scientific Name and Key Characteristics:** The question concerns the bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*. These bees belong to the family Andrenidae. A defining characteristic of the genus is their extremely small size; many species are less than 3 mm long, making them some of the smallest bees in North America and the world. Their native range is North and Central America, with the highest diversity in the desert regions of the southwestern United States and Mexico.\n\n2.  **Determine the Currently Used Common Name:** To find the common name, we consult modern entomological resources, field guides, and conservation websites focused on their native range.\n    *   Popular field guides such as \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" (Wilson & Carril, 2016) refer to the genus *Perdita* as \"Fairy Bees.\"\n    *   Authoritative online databases like BugGuide.net list \"Fairy Bees\" as the common name for the genus.\n    *   Conservation organizations focused on North American pollinators, like the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, also use the name \"Fairy Bees.\"\n    *   This name is a direct reference to their diminutive size, which makes them appear delicate and otherworldly, like fairies. Based on these sources, the currently used and widely accepted common name is **Fairy Bees**.\n\n3.  **Determine When the Name Was Coined:** Finding the exact moment a common name was \"coined\" can be difficult, as they often emerge organically in conversation before being formally published. The goal is to find the earliest significant publication that established or popularized the name for a wider audience.\n    *   We can trace the popularization of the name \"Fairy Bees\" to the influential 1996 book, **\"The Forgotten Pollinators,\"** written by bee experts Stephen L. Buchmann and Gary Paul Nabhan.\n    *   In this book, they explicitly write: \"Then there are the fairy bees, among the smallest of all bees, the species of the genus *Perdita*.\"\n    *   While the term might have been used informally by specialists before this date, this highly regarded and widely read book is the first major work to introduce and cement \"Fairy Bees\" as the common name for *Perdita* in the public and scientific lexicon. Therefore, **1996** is the most appropriate year to mark its coining or widespread popularization.\n\n4.  **Format the Final Answer:** The question requires the answer in the format \"<name>, <year>\". Combining the findings from the steps above gives us the common name and the year it was established.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Name:** Fairy Bees\n*   **Year:** 1996\n\nPutting these together in the specified format leads to the final answer.\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 1996>>>"
