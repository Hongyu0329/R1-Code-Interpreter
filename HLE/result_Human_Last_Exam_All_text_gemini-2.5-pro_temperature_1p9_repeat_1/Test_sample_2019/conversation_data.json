    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Constraints**\n\n1.  **Board:** A 5x5 grid. The term \"toroidal\" means the board wraps around on its edges. If a queen moves off the top edge, it reappears on the bottom edge in the same column, and similarly for the left and right edges.\n2.  **Pieces:** 4 Queens.\n3.  **Constraint:** The queens must be \"non-attacking\".\n4.  **Goal:** Find the total number of distinct arrangements of these 4 queens on the board.\n\n### **Step 2: Defining \"Non-Attacking\" on a Toroidal Board**\n\nWe can represent the squares of the board using coordinates `(x, y)` where `x` (column) and `y` (row) are integers from 0 to 4.\nTwo queens, one at `(x1, y1)` and another at `(x2, y2)`, attack each other if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, this is defined using modular arithmetic:\n*   **Same Row:** `y1 = y2`\n*   **Same Column:** `x1 = x2`\n*   **Same Sum-Diagonal (anti-diagonals):** `x1 + y1 ≡ x2 + y2 (mod 5)`\n*   **Same Difference-Diagonal (main diagonals):** `x1 - y1 ≡ x2 - y2 (mod 5)`\n\nA valid placement of 4 queens means we must choose 4 squares such that no two squares satisfy any of these conditions. This implies that the 4 queens must be placed in 4 different rows, 4 different columns, 4 different sum-diagonals, and 4 different difference-diagonals.\n\n### **Step 3: Strategic Approach - The Extension Theorem**\n\nDirectly counting the placements of 4 queens is very complex. A more elegant method is to relate this problem to the simpler problem of placing 5 queens (the N-Queens problem on an N x N board).\n\nThis problem is a specific case of the `(N-1)`-Queens Problem on an `N x N` toroidal board, with `N=5`. A famous result, often attributed to George Pólya, provides a powerful theorem for this scenario:\n\n**Pólya's Extension Theorem (for toroidal boards):** For an `N x N` board where `N` is not divisible by 2 or 3, any non-attacking configuration of `N-1` queens can be extended to a non-attacking configuration of `N` queens by adding a single queen, and this extension is unique.\n\nSince `N=5` is a prime number (and thus not divisible by 2 or 3), this theorem applies.\n\nThis theorem establishes a direct relationship between the set of 4-queen solutions and the set of 5-queen solutions:\n1.  Every valid 4-queen arrangement can be created by taking a valid 5-queen arrangement and removing one queen.\n2.  Removing two different queens from the same 5-queen arrangement will result in two different 4-queen arrangements.\n3.  Removing one queen from two different 5-queen arrangements cannot result in the same 4-queen arrangement (due to the uniqueness of the extension).\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4-queen arrangements is simply the total number of 5-queen arrangements multiplied by the number of queens we can choose to remove from each arrangement (which is 5).\n\n**Number of 4-Queen Solutions = (Number of 5-Queen Solutions) × 5**\n\n### **Step 4: Finding the Number of 5-Queen Solutions**\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding how many ways there are to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. A valid 5-queen solution must place exactly one queen in each row and each column. We can represent such a solution as a set of 5 coordinates `{(i, p(i)) | i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`, where `p` is a permutation of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nFor `N` being a prime number `≥ 5`, all solutions to the N-Queens problem on a toroidal board are known to be \"linear\". This means the permutation `p` must be of the form:\n`p(i) = a*i + b (mod 5)`\n\nFor this to be a valid solution, the diagonal constraints must also be met:\n1.  **Sum-Diagonals:** The values `i + p(i) = i + (a*i + b) = (a+1)*i + b` must be distinct for `i = 0..4`. This is true if and only if `a+1` is not zero `(mod 5)`, so `a ≠ -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`.\n2.  **Difference-Diagonals:** The values `i - p(i) = i - (a*i + b) = (1-a)*i - b` must be distinct for `i = 0..4`. This is true if and only if `1-a` is not zero `(mod 5)`, so `a ≠ 1 (mod 5)`.\n3.  **Columns:** The values `p(i) = a*i + b` must be distinct. This is true if and only if `a` is not zero `(mod 5)`.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of possible values for `a` and `b` that satisfy these conditions:\n*   `a ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}` (since `a ≠ 0`)\n*   `a ≠ 1`\n*   `a ≠ 4`\n\nThe only possible values for `a` are **2** and **3**. So there are **2** choices for `a`.\nThe value `b` represents a simple shift of the entire configuration along the columns. It can be any value from 0 to 4 without affecting the non-attacking property. So there are **5** choices for `b`.\n\nTotal number of 5-queen solutions = (choices for `a`) × (choices for `b`) = `2 × 5 = 10`.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nUsing the formula derived in Step 3:\nNumber of 4-Queen Solutions = (Number of 5-Queen Solutions) × 5\nNumber of 4-Queen Solutions = 10 × 5 = 50.\n\nThus, there are 50 distinct ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
