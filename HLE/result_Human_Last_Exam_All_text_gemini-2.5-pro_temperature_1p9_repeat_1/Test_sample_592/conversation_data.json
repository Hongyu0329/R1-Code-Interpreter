    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific piece of information from a film. The key elements are:\n*   **Film Title:** *Ovosodo* (Hard Boiled Egg)\n*   **Year of Release:** 1997\n*   **Character Name:** Tommaso\n*   **Actor's Name:** Marco Cocci\n*   **Action:** Moves to the United States\n*   **Information to find:** The specific US city he moves to.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the character's role in the film.**\nIn *Ovosodo*, the protagonist is Piero Mansani. Tommaso is his best and most charismatic friend. A crucial point of analysis is to not confuse the actions of the protagonist with those of his friend. Tommaso comes from a wealthy family and has different aspirations than Piero. While Piero's story is rooted in his hometown of Livorno, Tommaso's journey involves leaving.\n\n**Step 3: Recall or research the plot detail concerning Tommaso's move.**\nThe plot follows the two friends after they finish their final school exams (the *maturità*). Tommaso, who is adventurous and eager to see the world beyond their hometown, decides to pursue his \"American dream.\" He leaves Italy for the United States.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the exact city mentioned in the film's narrative.**\nThe film shows that Tommaso is successful in the United States. He communicates with Piero via postcards. The specific city he moves to and builds a successful career as a neuropsychiatrist in is mentioned in the narrative. Detailed plot summaries and reviews of the film confirm that this city is San Francisco.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Character Distinction:** The primary protagonist, Piero, stays in Livorno. It is his friend, Tommaso, who moves. It's easy to mix up the characters if one is not familiar with the film.\n*   **Source Verification:** The specific city might be a detail missed in brief English-language summaries. It is often confirmed in more detailed Italian plot descriptions or full reviews of the movie.\n*   **Narrative Device:** Tommaso's move to San Francisco serves as a narrative counterpoint to Piero's life, highlighting the different paths their lives take after their youth.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nBased on the plot of the movie *Ovosodo*, the character Tommaso leaves Livorno, Italy, and moves to the United States to start a new life and career. The city he moves to is San Francisco.\n\n<<<San Francisco>>>"
