    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A fundamental figure in ballroom dancing that involves turning to the left. The specific steps and technique vary between dances.\n*   **Overturn:** To rotate more than the standard amount prescribed for a figure in the technique book. For example, turning 1/2 instead of the standard 3/8 of a turn. Overturning is a common variation used by dancers for choreography or to change alignment on the dance floor.\n*   **Disregarding the Technique:** This is the most critical part of the question. It means we are looking for a dance where overturning the Reverse Turn is not just difficult, but fundamentally breaks the rules of how that figure is supposed to be executed (e.g., its footwork, timing, body action, or character).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reverse Turn in Each Dance**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz & B. English Waltz:** Both waltzes are characterized by flowing movement, body sway, and rise and fall. The Reverse Turn in the waltz is driven by powerful CBM (Contra Body Movement) and the swing of the body. These technical elements actually make it relatively easy to add more rotation (overturn). Dancers can control the amount of turn to navigate the floor. Therefore, it is possible to overturn a Waltz Reverse Turn without disregarding the core technique of swing and rotation.\n\n*   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** This dance is known for its long, smooth, gliding movements and continuous flow. The Reverse Turn in Foxtrot is a flowing figure that often progresses down the floor. Like the waltz, it uses CBM and continuous body rotation. Overturning the Reverse Turn is a standard variation used to change direction and is fully compatible with the dance's technique.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:** While faster and more energetic, Quickstep shares many technical principles with Waltz and Foxtrot, including the use of CBM, sway, and body rotation to execute turns. The Reverse Turn can be and often is overturned for choreographic purposes, and this does not violate the fundamental technique of the dance.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is the unique dance in this group. Its technique is fundamentally different.\n    *   **No Rise and Fall, No Sway:** Tango is performed on a level plane with bent knees. It lacks the rise and sway that help generate and sustain rotation in the swing dances.\n    *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, deliberate, and checked, not continuous and flowing.\n    *   **Specific Figure: The Reverse Turn (Lady Outside)**: The typical Tango Reverse Turn is often taught with the timing Quick, Quick, Slow (QQS).\n        *   Man's Steps: Forward LF (S), Side & Slightly Back RF (Q), **Close** LF to RF (Q).\n        *   Lady's Steps: Back RF (S), Side LF (Q), **Close** RF to LF (Q).\n    *   **The Critical Point:** The third step is a **close**, where the feet are brought together. This action mechanically and deliberately **stops** the rotation. To \"overturn\" the figure, you would need to add more rotation *within* those three steps. This is impossible without changing the final step; you cannot \"overturn\" a step where the feet close together. Changing that step to something else (e.g., a forward or back step to allow for more turn) would mean you are no longer dancing a Tango Reverse Turn; you are dancing a different figure entirely and thus disregarding the prescribed technique.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nIn Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, the technique of continuous movement, swing, and sway allows for the amount of rotation in a turn to be varied (i.e., overturned). In European Tango, the specific construction of the Reverse Turn, with its staccato nature and concluding with the feet closing together, makes overturning the figure technically impossible. Doing so would fundamentally violate the definition of the step.\n\n<<<C>>>"
