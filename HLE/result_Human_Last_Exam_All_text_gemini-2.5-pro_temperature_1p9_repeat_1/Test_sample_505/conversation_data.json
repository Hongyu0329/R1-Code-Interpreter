    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the basics of the Surface Code**\n\nThe surface code is a type of topological quantum error-correcting code. In this code, physical qubits are arranged on a 2D lattice. The key feature is that logical qubits are not stored in individual physical qubits but are encoded in the global, topological properties of the entire lattice. This provides robustness against local errors.\n\n**Step 2: How Logical Qubits are Encoded in a Surface Code**\n\nFor a simple, flat patch of surface code (topologically a disk), no logical qubits are encoded. It can act as a quantum memory but cannot perform computation on its own. To encode logical qubits, we must change the topology of the surface. This is typically done in one of two ways:\n\n1.  **Changing the underlying manifold:** For example, defining the code on a torus instead of a plane. A torus has a genus of 1 and can encode 2 logical qubits.\n2.  **Creating holes or defects:** By modifying the stabilizer measurements in certain regions, we can create \"holes\" in the fabric of the code. Each hole created within a planar patch adds the capacity to encode one logical qubit.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze a Single Patch**\n\nThe problem states that we have a patch of surface code with **two holes**.\n*   A planar patch with no holes encodes `k=0` logical qubits.\n*   The number of logical qubits `k` that can be encoded in a single planar patch is equal to the number of holes `h`.\n*   The formula is: `k_patch = h`\n*   In this case, for one patch, the number of holes `h = 2`.\n*   Therefore, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode **2 logical qubits**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Entire System**\n\nThe question specifies that the system consists of **two patches** of surface code. These patches are independent, separate quantum codes.\n*   **Patch 1:** Has two holes, so it encodes `k_1 = 2` logical qubits.\n*   **Patch 2:** Also has two holes, so it encodes `k_2 = 2` logical qubits.\n\nSince the patches are distinct, the total number of logical qubits that can be encoded in the entire system is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n\n*   **Total Logical Qubits (`k_total`) = `k_1` + `k_2`**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   `k_total` = 2 (from Patch 1) + 2 (from Patch 2)\n*   `k_total` = 4\n\nThe system of two separate surface code patches, each with two holes, can encode a maximum of 4 logical qubits.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Independence of Patches:** The term \"two patches\" implies two separate, non-connected code instances. If the patches were connected, they would form a single larger code with a different topology, and the calculation would change.\n2.  **Holes as the Source of Logical Qubits:** In planar surface codes, the logical qubits are a direct consequence of creating holes. Each hole effectively adds a boundary and introduces a pair of non-trivial logical operators needed to define one qubit.\n3.  **Meaning of \"At Most\":** In this context, the number of logical qubits is fixed by the described topology. Therefore, \"at most\" is equivalent to the exact number. The specified topology (two patches, two holes each) has a fixed encoding capacity.\n\n<<<4>>>"
