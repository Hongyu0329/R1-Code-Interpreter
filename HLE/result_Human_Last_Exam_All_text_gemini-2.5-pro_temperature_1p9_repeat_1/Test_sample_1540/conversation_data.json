    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory used.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to compare two strings lexicographically.\n2.  **Input**: Two strings of equal length are provided. The length of each string is between 1 and 100 characters. The strings contain only uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n3.  **Comparison Rule**: The comparison must be case-insensitive. This means 'a' should be treated as equal to 'A', 'b' to 'B', and so on.\n4.  **Output**:\n    *   Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   Print \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Memory Efficiency**: The main requirement is to write the *most memory-efficient* program. This means we should use the minimum possible memory for our variables. We must carefully choose data types and avoid any unnecessary variables.\n2.  **Input Handling**: We need to read two strings. Since the maximum length is 100, we need buffers of size at least 101 to accommodate the string characters plus the null terminator (`\\0`). `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` is suitable here since the buffer size is determined and safe.\n3.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison**: To compare characters regardless of case, we should convert them to a common case (either both to lowercase or both to uppercase) before comparing. The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is perfect for this.\n4.  **Comparison Logic**: The comparison should proceed character by character from the beginning of the strings. As soon as a pair of characters at the same position are found to be different (after case conversion), the result is determined, and the program can terminate. If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are equal.\n5.  **Variable Sizing**: To minimize memory, we should choose the smallest possible data type for each variable that can still hold the required range of values.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nLet's design the C program with a focus on memory efficiency.\n\n**1. Storing the Strings**\n\n*   We must read the two strings from the input before we can compare them. Standard input typically buffers lines, so reading character-by-character from both strings in an interleaved fashion is not practical.\n*   Therefore, we need two separate buffers (character arrays) to store the strings.\n*   Given the maximum length is 100, we need arrays of size 101 to hold the 100 characters plus the null terminator.\n*   `char s1[101];`\n*   `char s2[101];`\n*   The memory consumed by these two buffers is `101 * sizeof(char) + 101 * sizeof(char)`. Since `sizeof(char)` is defined to be 1 byte in C, this totals `101 + 101 = 202` bytes. This memory is essential and cannot be reduced.\n\n**2. Iterating through the Strings**\n\n*   We need to loop through the strings from the first character to the last. We can do this using an index variable.\n*   The index will range from 0 up to the length of the strings (at most 100).\n*   Let's analyze the memory cost of different types for this index variable:\n    *   **Using `int i;`**: `sizeof(int)` is typically 4 bytes on modern systems. Total memory: `202 (buffers) + 4 (index) = 206` bytes.\n    *   **Using `char i;`**: The range of a `signed char` (-128 to 127) or `unsigned char` (0 to 255) is sufficient to hold an index from 0 to 100. `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte. Total memory: `202 (buffers) + 1 (index) = 203` bytes.\n    *   **Using pointers `char *p1, *p2;`**: This would require two pointer variables. On a 32-bit system, each pointer is 4 bytes (`2 * 4 = 8` bytes total). On a 64-bit system, each is 8 bytes (`2 * 8 = 16` bytes total). This would result in `202 + 8 = 210` or `202 + 16 = 218` bytes, which is less efficient than using a single `char` index.\n\n*   Conclusion: Using a `char` for the loop index is the most memory-efficient choice.\n\n**3. Final Program Structure and Memory Calculation**\n\nBased on the analysis, the most memory-efficient C program would look like this:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    // Variable 1: Buffer for the first string.\n    char s1[101]; // Size: 101 bytes\n\n    // Variable 2: Buffer for the second string.\n    char s2[101]; // Size: 101 bytes\n\n    scanf(\"%s%s\", s1, s2);\n\n    // Variable 3: Loop counter. 'char' is the smallest integer type.\n    char i = 0; // Size: 1 byte\n\n    while (s1[(unsigned char)i]) { // Loop until the end of the string.\n        char char1_lower = tolower(s1[(unsigned char)i]);\n        char char2_lower = tolower(s2[(unsigned char)i]);\n\n        if (char1_lower < char2_lower) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (char1_lower > char2_lower) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop finishes, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe problem asks for `m`, the total memory in bytes used for the variables. Let's sum the sizes of all variables declared:\n\n1.  `s1`: `sizeof(char[101])` = 101 bytes.\n2.  `s2`: `sizeof(char[101])` = 101 bytes.\n3.  `i`: `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n4.  The temporary variables `char1_lower` and `char2_lower` inside the loop also occupy memory (`1+1=2` bytes), but this memory on the stack is reused in each iteration and can be optimized away by the compiler. However, even considering them as distinct variables within the loop's scope, the version with `char i` is still the most efficient overall design. To be precise, let's consider the most optimized version of the loop which would not declare these extra variables: `if (tolower(...) < tolower(...))`. In that case, the only declared variables are `s1`, `s2`, and `i`.\n\nTotal memory `m` = `sizeof(s1)` + `sizeof(s2)` + `sizeof(i)`\n`m = 101 + 101 + 1`\n`m = 203` bytes.\n\n<<<203>>>"
