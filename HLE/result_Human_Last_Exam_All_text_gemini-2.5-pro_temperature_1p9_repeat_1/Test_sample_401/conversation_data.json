    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, we need to precisely define the key terms used in the question.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected, non-empty Hausdorff topological space. The question specifies it is not necessarily metric, so we must consider this general definition.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continuum:**\n    *   A continuum $X$ is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A proper subcontinuum is a subspace that is a continuum itself but is not equal to the whole space $X$.\n    *   An continuum $X$ is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable. That is, if $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are subcontinua of $X$, then it must be that either $A=X$ or $B=X$.\n*   **Composant:** Let $X$ be a continuum and let $p$ be a point in $X$. The composant of $p$, denoted $C(p)$, is the set of all points $x$ in $X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ that contains both $p$ and $x$. Formally:\n    $C(p) = \\bigcup \\{K \\mid p \\in K \\text{ and } K \\text{ is a proper subcontinuum of } X\\}$\n\n### Step 2: Properties of Composants in an Indecomposable Continuum\n\nA crucial property of indecomposable continua is how their composants behave.\n\n1.  **Partition Property:** In an indecomposable continuum, the relation \"$x$ and $y$ belong to the same composant\" is an equivalence relation. This means that the composants are pairwise disjoint and their union is the entire space. They form a partition of the continuum.\n2.  **Dense Property:** Each composant of an indecomposable continuum is a dense subset of the continuum.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Minimum Number of Composants\n\nThe question asks for the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have. Let's analyze the possibilities.\n\n**Can the number be 1?**\n\n*   If an indecomposable continuum $X$ had only one composant, then according to the partition property, that single composant must be the entire space $X$.\n*   This would mean that for any two points $p, q \\in X$, there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $p$ and $q$.\n*   However, there is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory: **Any continuum that has only one composant is decomposable.**\n*   Since an indecomposable continuum is, by definition, not decomposable, it cannot have only one composant.\n*   Therefore, the number of composants in an indecomposable continuum must be greater than 1. The smallest possible number must be at least 2.\n\n**Can the number be 2 (or any integer greater than 1)?**\n\n*   We have established that the number must be at least 2. The next question is whether a number like 2 is actually possible. Does there exist an indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants?\n*   Initial intuition, based on a sometimes-misstated theorem by Mazurkiewicz, might suggest that the number of composants is either 1 or uncountably many ($c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$). If this were true, the minimum for an indecomposable continuum would be $c$.\n*   This dichotomy, however, is not universally true. The standard Baire category argument, which \"proves\" that the number of composants must be uncountable, relies on the premise that every composant is a meager set (a set of the first category). This premise is not always true. While it holds for many classical examples like the Knaster U-continuum or the pseudo-arc, it fails for others.\n*   The definitive answer comes from the work of the mathematician R. H. Bing. In his 1951 paper \"Snake-like continua,\" Bing provided constructions for indecomposable continua with a specific number of composants.\n*   **Bing's Result:** For any integer $n \\geq 2$, there exists an indecomposable (metric, snake-like) continuum that has exactly $n$ composants. He also constructed examples with a countably infinite number ($\\aleph_0$) and an uncountable number ($c$) of composants.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\n1.  An indecomposable continuum cannot have only one composant. This means the number of composants must be at least 2.\n2.  R. H. Bing's work demonstrates that for any integer $n \\ge 2$, it is possible to construct an indecomposable continuum with exactly $n$ composants.\n3.  Therefore, an indecomposable continuum with 2 composants exists.\n4.  Combining these points, the smallest possible number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is 2."
