    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, including careful points to consider, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe two-point Green's function $G(x,t; x',t')$ is defined as the time-ordered expectation value of the field operators. In the Feynman path integral formalism, this is expressed as an integral over all possible field configurations $\\psi(x,t)$. For a non-interacting system, we consider the \"bare\" Green's function, denoted by $G_0$.\n\nUsing the imaginary time formalism ($\\tau = it$, where $t$ is real time), which is often more convenient for path integral calculations, the bare Green's function is:\n$G_0(\\mathbf{x},\\tau; \\mathbf{x}',\\tau') = -\\langle T_\\tau \\psi(\\mathbf{x},\\tau) \\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{x}',\\tau') \\rangle_0$\n\nHere, $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0$ denotes the expectation value with respect to the non-interacting action $S_0$. This expectation value is computed via the path integral:\n$G_0(\\mathbf{x},\\tau; \\mathbf{x}',\\tau') = -\\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\psi(\\mathbf{x},\\tau) \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}',\\tau') e^{-S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}$\nwhere $\\psi$ and $\\psi^*$ are Grassmann fields (for fermions).\n\n**Step 2: Express the Action in the Energy Eigenbasis**\n\nThe question specifically asks about the dependence on single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$. This suggests we should work in the basis of single-particle states $\\{\\phi_k(\\mathbf{x})\\}$ that diagonalize the non-interacting single-particle Hamiltonian, $\\hat{h}_0$.\n$\\hat{h}_0 \\phi_k(\\mathbf{x}) = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k(\\mathbf{x})$\n\nThe quantum number `k` could represent momentum for a translationally invariant system, or any other appropriate quantum number.\n\nThe field operator (and the corresponding Grassmann field in the path integral) can be expanded in this basis:\n$\\psi(\\mathbf{x},\\tau) = \\sum_k \\phi_k(\\mathbf{x}) c_k(\\tau)$\n\nThe non-interacting action $S_0$ in the original real-space representation is $S_0 = \\int d\\tau d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x},\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\hat{h}_0 - \\mu) \\psi(\\mathbf{x},\\tau)$, where $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. Substituting the basis expansion and using the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(\\mathbf{x})$, the action simplifies and becomes diagonal in the `k`-basis:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int d\\tau \\, c_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) c_k(\\tau)$\n\n**Step 3: Transform to Frequency Space**\n\nThe path integral is most easily solved in frequency space. We perform a Fourier transform from imaginary time $\\tau$ to Matsubara frequency $i\\omega_n$. For fermions, $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$, where $\\beta = 1/k_B T$.\n$c_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_{n} e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} c_k(i\\omega_n)$\n\nIn frequency space, the derivative operator $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$. The action becomes:\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} c_k^*(i\\omega_n) (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) c_k(i\\omega_n)$\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Green's Function from the Action**\n\nThe path integral for the Green's function in this basis, $G_0(k, \\tau-\\tau') = -\\langle T_\\tau c_k(\\tau) c_k^\\dagger(\\tau') \\rangle_0$, can now be evaluated. The action is quadratic in the fields $c_k(i\\omega_n)$. A fundamental result from Gaussian path integration is that for an action of the form $S = \\sum_{j} \\phi_j^* A_j \\phi_j$, the propagator (Green's function) in that basis is simply the inverse of the kernel, $A_j^{-1}$.\n\nIn our case, the action is diagonal in both the state index `k` and the Matsubara frequency index `n`. The kernel is the term multiplying the fields $c_k^*$ and $c_k$:\n$G_0^{-1}(k, i\\omega_n) = -i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu$\n\n(Note: Depending on the Fourier transform convention, the kernel might be $i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)$. This only changes an overall sign and does not affect the functional dependence.)\n\nInverting this kernel gives the final expression for the bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu}$\nOr, using the more common convention:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Functional Dependence**\n\nThe expression $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$ explicitly shows the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n1.  **Reciprocal Relationship:** $G_0$ is the reciprocal of a linear function of $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  **Pole Structure:** The poles of the Green's function in the complex frequency plane are the central physical feature. Setting the denominator to zero, $i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) = 0$, shows that the poles are located at energies equal to the single-particle energies (measured relative to the chemical potential).\n3.  **Physical Meaning:** A pole in the Green's function at a specific energy signifies a stable excitation of the system at that energy. For the non-interacting system, these excitations correspond to adding or removing a single particle with energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Bare vs. Interacting:** This entire analysis is for the *bare* Green's function ($G_0$), where interactions are ignored. For an interacting system, the Green's function $G$ has a similar structure, $G(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) - \\Sigma(k, \\omega)}$, but the denominator is modified by the self-energy $\\Sigma(k, \\omega)$, which captures all interaction effects.\n*   **Energy Scale:** The relevant energy is the energy measured relative to the chemical potential, $\\xi_k = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$.\n*   **Frequency Domain:** The simple algebraic relationship is manifest in the frequency-momentum $(i\\omega_n, k)$ domain. In the time domain, the relationship involves a Fourier transform (an integral), making it less direct.\n*   **Real Frequencies:** To obtain the Green's function for real frequencies $\\omega$, one performs an analytic continuation $i\\omega_n \\to \\omega + i\\eta$, where $\\eta$ is an infinitesimal that enforces causality. This gives the retarded Green's function $G_0^R(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta}$, where the pole is slightly displaced from the real axis.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe bare Green's function $G_0$ is a function of both the state label `k` (e.g., momentum) and a frequency variable ($\\omega$ or $i\\omega_n$). Its dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is found in the denominator of its expression in frequency space. Specifically, the Green's function is the reciprocal of the difference between the frequency variable and the particle's energy (relative to the chemical potential).\n\nThe functional form is:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\nMore precisely, including the chemical potential $\\mu$ and in Matsubara frequency notation, the expression is:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nThis means the poles of the bare Green's function are located exactly at the single-particle energy levels.\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is most clearly seen in the frequency-momentum representation. In this space, the Green's function is given by the expression:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nHere, $i\\omega_n$ is the Matsubara frequency and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\nTherefore, the functional dependence is that $G_0$ is the reciprocal of a linear function of $\\epsilon_k$. The single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ appears in the denominator, defining the location of the pole of the Green's function in the complex frequency plane.>>>"
