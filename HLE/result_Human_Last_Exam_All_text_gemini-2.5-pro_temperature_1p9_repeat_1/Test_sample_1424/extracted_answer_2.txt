The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\epsilon_k$ is most clearly seen in the frequency-momentum representation. In this space, the Green's function is given by the expression:
$G_0(k, i\omega_n) = \frac{1}{i\omega_n - (\epsilon_k - \mu)}$
Here, $i\omega_n$ is the Matsubara frequency and $\mu$ is the chemical potential.
Therefore, the functional dependence is that $G_0$ is the reciprocal of a linear function of $\epsilon_k$. The single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ appears in the denominator, defining the location of the pole of the Green's function in the complex frequency plane.
