The final product C is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**. This molecule is **achiral** because it does not possess any chiral centers; every carbon atom in the alkyl chain is bonded to at least two identical hydrogen atoms, and the molecule has planes of symmetry. The original stereocenter was destroyed in the first elimination step of the synthesis.
