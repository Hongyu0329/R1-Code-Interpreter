    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group of `X = Sym^15(C)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Objects**\n\n*   **C**: A smooth, projective complex curve (Riemann surface) of genus `g = 3`.\n*   **X = Sym^15(C)**: The 15th symmetric power of C. This is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on C. It is a smooth, projective variety of dimension `d = 15`.\n*   **Neron-Severi Group NS(V)**: For a projective variety `V`, `NS(V)` is the group of divisors on `V` modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, denoted `ρ(V)`, is a fundamental invariant called the Picard number. It measures the number of independent \"algebraic\" curves on `V`.\n\n**2. The Key Formula**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in relating the Neron-Severi group of the symmetric power `X = Sym^d(C)` to the properties of the curve `C`. There is a fundamental result in algebraic geometry (due to Beauville, based on earlier work by MacDonald) that describes the Picard group of a symmetric power. For a curve `C` of genus `g` and an integer `d ≥ g`, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of `Sym^d(C)` is given by:\n\n`ρ(Sym^d(C)) = ρ(C) + ρ(J(C))`\n\nHere:\n*   `J(C)` is the Jacobian variety of `C`, which is an abelian variety of dimension `g`.\n*   In our specific problem, `g = 3` and `d = 15`. Since `15 ≥ 3`, this formula applies.\n*   So, `ρ(X) = ρ(Sym^15(C)) = ρ(C) + ρ(J(C))`.\n\nOur task now reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values for `ρ(C)` and `ρ(J(C))`.\n\n**3. Analyze `ρ(C)`**\n\n*   `C` is a curve. The Neron-Severi group of any smooth projective curve is isomorphic to the integers, `Z`. A basis for this group is given by the class of a single point.\n*   Therefore, the rank `ρ(C)` is always 1, regardless of the specific choice of the genus 3 curve `C`.\n*   `ρ(C) = 1` (This is a constant part of our formula).\n\n**4. Analyze `ρ(J(C))`**\n\n*   This is the variable part. The rank `ρ(J(C))` depends on the specific complex structure of the curve `C`. `J(C)` is a `g=3` dimensional abelian variety.\n*   The Picard number `ρ(A)` of an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g` is bounded by the Hodge number `h^{1,1}(A)`. For any `g`-dimensional complex torus, `h^{1,1}(A) = g^2`.\n*   Thus, for `J(C)`, we have `1 ≤ ρ(J(C)) ≤ g^2 = 3^2 = 9`.\n*   We need to determine if these bounds, 1 and 9, are actually achieved by Jacobians of genus 3 curves.\n\n**a) Smallest Possible Rank for `ρ(J(C))`**\n\n*   The smallest possible rank `ρ(J(C)) = 1` is achieved for a \"very general\" curve `C`.\n*   A general curve has a Jacobian `J(C)` which is a *simple* abelian variety (it does not contain any smaller-dimensional abelian subvarieties).\n*   Furthermore, its endomorphism ring is as small as possible: `End(J(C)) ≅ Z`. Such Jacobians are said to have no complex multiplication.\n*   In this case, `NS(J(C))` is generated by a single ample class (the polarization given by the Theta divisor), and thus `ρ(J(C)) = 1`.\n*   This case corresponds to the minimal value.\n\n**b) Largest Possible Rank for `ρ(J(C))`**\n\n*   The largest possible rank `ρ(J(C)) = g^2 = 9` is achieved when `J(C)` has the maximum possible number of independent endomorphisms, a situation known as **maximal complex multiplication (CM)**.\n*   This maximum is achieved if `J(C)` is isogenous to a product of `g=3` elliptic curves, each of which has complex multiplication. For example, `J(C) \\sim E_1 × E_2 × E_3`, where each `E_i` is a CM elliptic curve.\n*   The existence of such genus 3 curves is well-established. For instance, the Fermat quartic curve `x^4 + y^4 = z^4`, which has genus 3, has a Jacobian that is isogenous to the cube of a single CM elliptic curve. Other examples (like certain cyclic covers of `P^1`) can provide Jacobians isogenous to products of non-isogenous CM elliptic curves.\n*   Therefore, the maximum value `ρ(J(C)) = 9` is indeed achievable.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we can combine these results using our formula `ρ(X) = ρ(C) + ρ(J(C))`.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank of NS(X):**\n    This occurs when `C` is a generic curve, so `ρ(J(C)) = 1`.\n    `ρ_min(X) = ρ(C) + ρ_min(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n*   **Largest possible rank of NS(X):**\n    This occurs when `C` is a special curve with maximal CM, so `ρ(J(C)) = 9`.\n    `ρ_max(X) = ρ(C) + ρ_max(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10`\n\n### Careful Points Checklist\n\n*   **Applicability of the formula:** We checked that `d ≥ g` (`15 ≥ 3`), so the formula `ρ(Sym^d(C)) = ρ(C) + ρ(J(C))` is valid.\n*   **Constancy of `ρ(C)`:** The rank for the curve itself is always 1, independent of its geometry.\n*   **Variability of `ρ(J(C))`:** The rank for the Jacobian depends on the arithmetic and geometric properties of the curve, specifically its endomorphism ring.\n*   **Achievability of Bounds:** We confirmed that both the theoretical minimum (`1`) and maximum (`g^2=9`) for `ρ(J(C))` are actually attained for some choice of genus 3 curve `C`. This is crucial; otherwise, our result would just be an upper/lower bound, not the true min/max.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest rank is 2 and the largest rank is 10.>>>"
