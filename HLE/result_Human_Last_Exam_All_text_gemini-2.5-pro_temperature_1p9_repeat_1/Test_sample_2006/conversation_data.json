    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Title and Instructions**\n*   The title of the haiku is \"The Bays\".\n*   We are explicitly told that the title is a question.\n*   We are also told that the final answer is a word, and its letters must be presented in alphabetical order. This is a critical instruction.\n\n**Step 2: Decode the Title's Pun**\n*   Since the title \"The Bays\" is a question, it's likely a pun or a phonetic riddle.\n*   The phrase \"The Bays\" sounds very similar to the question \"The Base?\". This is the most probable interpretation of the title as a question.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Haiku's Content for Clues**\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   \"August\" can mean majestic or venerable. \"Tempest\" means a violent storm or upheaval. This line describes a great and terrible upheaval.\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is a straightforward calculation: 2 * 15 = 30.\n    *   This number, 30, is associated with \"winds of change,\" a major transformation.\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   \"A divine one\" refers to a god or a god-like figure.\n    *   \"Yields\" can mean to surrender, give way, or die.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Theme**\n*   Putting the clues together: We have a majestic upheaval, the number 30 bringing great change, and a divine figure yielding or dying.\n*   These elements strongly allude to the biblical story of Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus. Judas was paid 30 pieces of silver (the number from line 2) to betray Jesus (the \"divine one\" who \"yields\" his life in line 3). This act led to the crucifixion, a \"tempest\" that brought about a fundamental \"wind of change\" in Christianity.\n*   The act of betrayal for money is considered a profoundly immoral, vile, or **base** act.\n\n**Step 5: Connect the Theme back to the Title/Question**\n*   The haiku's theme is a famously \"base\" act. This confirms our initial hypothesis from Step 2 that the title \"The Bays\" is a pun for the question \"The Base?\".\n*   The riddle is essentially asking: \"The subject of this poem is a base act. What is the key word?\". The most direct answer, suggested by the pun itself, is the word \"BASE\".\n\n**Step 6: Form the Final Answer**\n*   The answer to the question \"The Base?\" is the word **BASE**.\n*   The final instruction states that the answer must be in alphabetical order.\n*   The letters in \"BASE\" are B, A, S, E.\n*   Arranging these letters in alphabetical order gives us **A, B, E, S**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \"ABES\".\n\n<<<ABES>>>"
