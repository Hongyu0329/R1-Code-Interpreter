    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** The question asks for a specific person.\n    *   **Which Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher:** This narrows the search to a particular group of Polish analytic philosophers and logicians active primarily between the World Wars. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   **decomposes the notion of hallmark:** This indicates a conceptual analysis. The term \"hallmark\" (in Polish, *znamię*) refers to a sign or an indicator from which one can infer the presence of something else.\n    *   **into symptoms and signals:** This gives the specific terms of the decomposition. The task is to find which philosopher within the specified school made this particular distinction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Lviv-Warsaw School:** Known for its rigorous analytical methods, clarity of thought, and significant contributions to logic, semiotics (the theory of signs), and epistemology. The nature of signs and inference would be a central topic for this school.\n    *   **Hallmark (*znamię*):** A general term for an indicator. When we see a hallmark of X, we infer that X is present, exists, or has occurred.\n    *   **Symptom (*objaw*):** This term implies a natural, causal connection. A phenomenon is a symptom of another if it is its cause or its effect. For example, a fever is a symptom of an infection. There is no human convention involved; it is a relationship in nature.\n    *   **Signal (*sygnał*):** This term implies a conventional, arbitrary, and often intentional connection. A signal is created by someone to communicate something to someone else. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop. The relationship between the red light and stopping is established by rules (convention), not by a law of nature.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidates from the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   While many members of the school dealt with logic and language, the philosopher most renowned for his systematic work in epistemology and semiotics, particularly the classification of signs, is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n    *   His work, especially in books like *Pragmatic Logic* and various essays, delves deeply into the ways we reason and infer knowledge from signs.\n    *   It is a well-established fact in the study of Polish philosophy that Ajdukiewicz introduced this precise and influential distinction.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:**\n    *   Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School, undertook a detailed analysis of inferential reasoning.\n    *   In his analysis of signs (*znamiona*), he distinguished between those based on natural, causal links and those based on man-made conventions.\n    *   He termed the first kind **symptoms** (*objawy*) and the second kind **signals** (*sygnały*). This distinction was fundamental to his theory of knowledge and language.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is arrived at by identifying Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz as the Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who is famous for his work in semiotics and for specifically distinguishing between signs based on causal connections (symptoms) and signs based on conventional rules (signals).\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
