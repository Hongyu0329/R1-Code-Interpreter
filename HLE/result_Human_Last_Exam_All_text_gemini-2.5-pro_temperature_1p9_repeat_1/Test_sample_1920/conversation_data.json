    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Conductor**\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We can test small prime divisors. $53599$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Dividing by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Next, we factorize 7657. Testing small prime divisors: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Finally, we factorize 589. Testing small prime divisors: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n*   Both 7, 13, 19, and 31 are prime numbers.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. The conductor is a product of four distinct odd primes.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Structure of Dirichlet Characters**\n\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo $d$ can be decomposed based on its prime factors. Any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p$.\n\n**Step 3: Condition for a Primitive Character**\n\nA character $\\chi = \\prod_{p|d} \\chi_p$ is primitive with a square-free conductor $d$ if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_p$ is non-trivial.\n*   A trivial character $\\chi_p^0$ modulo $p$ has a conductor of 1.\n*   Any non-trivial character $\\chi_p$ modulo a prime $p$ has conductor $p$.\n*   The conductor of the product character $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its components: $\\text{cond}(\\chi) = \\prod_{p|d} \\text{cond}(\\chi_p)$.\nFor $\\text{cond}(\\chi)$ to be $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$, we must have $\\text{cond}(\\chi_p) = p$ for each prime $p$. This requires each $\\chi_p$ to be a non-trivial character. This also means the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be greater than 1.\n\n**Step 4: Condition on the Order of the Character**\n\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n$\\operatorname{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\nThis implies two conditions:\n1.  The order of each component, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_p$ must be non-trivial, the possible orders are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n2.  For the lcm to be 6, there must be at least one component whose order is a multiple of 2, and at least one component whose order is a multiple of 3.\n\n**Step 5: Counting the Component Characters**\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of a specific order $k$, where $k$ divides $p-1$, is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n\nLet's check the orders of the character groups for our primes:\n*   mod 7: $\\phi(7) = 6$\n*   mod 13: $\\phi(13) = 12$\n*   mod 19: $\\phi(19) = 18$\n*   mod 31: $\\phi(31) = 30$\n\nFor each prime factor $p$ of $d$, $\\phi(p)$ is a multiple of 6. This means that for each $p$, characters of order 2, 3, and 6 exist. Let's count them:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 2$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculating the Total Number of Characters**\n\nWe will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. Let $N$ be the number of primitive characters of order 6.\nLet $S_k$ be the set of primitive characters whose order divides $k$. Then $N = |S_6| - |S_3| - |S_2| + |S_1|$.\n\n*   **Number of characters whose order divides 6 ($|S_6|$):**\n    For the order to divide 6, the order of each component $\\chi_p$ must divide 6. Since components must be non-trivial, their orders can be 2, 3, or 6. For each of the four primes, the number of available characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Thus, $|S_6| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n*   **Number of characters whose order divides 3 ($|S_3|$):**\n    For the order to divide 3, the order of each non-trivial component $\\chi_p$ must be 3. For each of the four primes, the number of characters of order 3 is $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    Thus, $|S_3| = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n    (Note: These 16 characters all have order exactly 3, since the only other divisor of 3 is 1, which is excluded).\n\n*   **Number of characters whose order divides 2 ($|S_2|$):**\n    For the order to divide 2, the order of each non-trivial component $\\chi_p$ must be 2. For each of the four primes, the number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    Thus, $|S_2| = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n    (This character has order exactly 2).\n\n*   **Number of characters whose order divides 1 ($|S_1|$):**\n    An order of 1 means the character is trivial. For a primitive character with a conductor $d>1$, the order cannot be 1. Thus, $|S_1|=0$.\n\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    The number of characters with order exactly 6 is:\n    $N = |S_6| - (\\text{orders only dividing 3}) - (\\text{orders only dividing 2})$\n    $N = |S_6| - |S_3| - |S_2|$\n    $N = 625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\nFinal Answer: There are 608 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6.\n\n<<<608>>>"
