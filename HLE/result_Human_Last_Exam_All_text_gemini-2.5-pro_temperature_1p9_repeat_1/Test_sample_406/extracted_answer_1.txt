The conditions are: 1. The sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces. 2. There must exist a constant k, with 0 ≤ k < 1, such that for any two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) in X × Y × Z, the following inequality is satisfied: d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)).
