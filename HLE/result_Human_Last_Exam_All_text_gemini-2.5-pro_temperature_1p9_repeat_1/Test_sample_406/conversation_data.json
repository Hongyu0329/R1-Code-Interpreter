    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a point `(x, y, z)` that simultaneously satisfies the fixed point conditions for three functions `F`, `G`, and `H` with specific interdependencies. The existence of such a point is typically guaranteed by extending the principles of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to a product space.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the conditions required.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nFirst, we must precisely define what an FGH-tripled fixed point is, based on the provided function signatures:\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triple `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Careful Point:** Note the specific order and choice of variables passed as arguments to each function, as this is crucial. For instance, the second argument to `G` is `x`, not `y`, and the third argument to `H` is `x`.\n\n### Step 2: Transforming into a Standard Fixed-Point Problem\n\nThe problem of finding a tripled fixed point can be converted into a standard fixed-point problem for a single operator on a product space. This allows us to use established theorems like the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\n1.  **Construct the Product Space:** Let `S = X × Y × Z` be the Cartesian product of the sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z`. An element `s ∈ S` is an ordered triple `s = (x, y, z)`.\n2.  **Define the Operator:** Define a single operator `T: S → S` that combines the functions `F`, `G`, and `H`:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n3.  **Relate Fixed Points:** A point `s_0 = (x_0, y_0, z_0)` is a fixed point of `T` if and only if `T(s_0) = s_0`. Writing this equation out, we get:\n    `(F(x_0, y_0, z_0), G(y_0, x_0, y_0), H(z_0, y_0, x_0)) = (x_0, y_0, z_0)`\n    This is precisely the system of equations defining an FGH-tripled fixed point. Therefore, finding an FGH-tripled fixed point is equivalent to finding a fixed point of the operator `T`.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem provides sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point. It requires two main conditions: the space must be a complete metric space, and the operator must be a contraction mapping.\n\n**Condition 1: The Space**\nThe domain `S` of the operator `T` must be a complete metric space.\n*   Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be metric spaces.\n*   We can define a metric `d_S` on the product space `S = X × Y × Z`. A common choice is the sum metric:\n    `d_S((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)) = d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)`\n*   For `(S, d_S)` to be a complete metric space, each of its component spaces must be complete.\n*   **First condition:** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **complete metric spaces**.\n\n**Careful Point:** Completeness is essential. Without it, a sequence of points `T^n(s)` might converge towards a limit that is not in the space, meaning no fixed point exists within the space.\n\n**Condition 2: The Contraction Mapping**\nThe operator `T: S → S` must be a contraction mapping. This means there exists a constant `k` such that `0 ≤ k < 1` (the contraction constant) for which the following inequality holds for any two points `s1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `s2 = (x2, y2, z2)` in `S`:\n`d_S(T(s1), T(s2)) ≤ k * d_S(s1, s2)`\n\nLet's expand this inequality using the definitions of `T` and `d_S`:\n`d_S(T(x1, y1, z1), T(x2, y2, z2))`\n`= d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2))`\n\nSo, the full contraction condition is:\n`d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`\n\n**Careful Point:** This single inequality combines the behavior of all three functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. It doesn't require each function to be a contraction individually, but rather that their combined effect on the total distance is a contraction.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe conditions for the functions `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `H:Z*Y*X→Z` to have an FGH-tripled fixed point, based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, are as follows:\n\n1.  **Conditions on the Spaces**: The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **complete metric spaces** with respective metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n\n2.  **Condition on the Functions (Contraction)**: The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must collectively satisfy a contraction condition. Specifically, there must exist a constant `k` such that `0 ≤ k < 1`, where for any two points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)` in `X × Y × Z`, the following inequality holds:\n\n    `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2))`\n\nIf these two conditions are satisfied, there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)`.\n\n<<<The conditions are: 1. The sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces. 2. There must exist a constant k, with 0 ≤ k < 1, such that for any two points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) in X × Y × Z, the following inequality is satisfied: d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) + d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) + d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k * (d_X(x1, x2) + d_Y(y1, y2) + d_Z(z1, z2)).>>>"
