    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the upper bound for the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ for squarefree natural numbers $(N)$.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand the terms involved:\n\n*   **Squarefree natural numbers (N):** These are positive integers that are not divisible by any perfect square other than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10). In this context, `N` typically serves as a \"level\" or \"discriminant\" that defines a family of arithmetic objects.\n*   **Covolume (V):** This is the volume of a quotient space `X = Γ\\H^n`, where `Γ` is a discrete group of isometries of a symmetric space `H^n`. For this problem, the relevant space is the hyperbolic plane `H^2`, and `Γ` is an arithmetic Fuchsian group defined by `N`. The covolume `V` of `Γ` is the area of the resulting hyperbolic surface `X`.\n*   **Maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$:** This notation is not standard. We must interpret it based on the context of arithmetic geometry and number theory.\n    *   The subscript `∞` often denotes the `L^∞`-norm, also known as the sup-norm (supremum norm), which gives the maximum value of a function.\n    *   The phrase \"maximum norm\" reinforces the interpretation as a sup-norm.\n    *   The `k_k` part is ambiguous. It could refer to the weight `k` of a modular form, an index `k` in a sequence of eigenfunctions, or it might be a typo.\n\nGiven these clues, the most plausible interpretation is that **`k_{k,∞}` refers to the `L^∞`-norm of an automorphic form `φ` on the arithmetic surface `X`**. Specifically, we consider `L^2`-normalized Hecke eigenforms, which are the fundamental building blocks in the spectral theory of these surfaces.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Mathematical Setting\n\nThe problem is set in the context of arithmetic surfaces, which are defined using the squarefree integer `N`. Two main families are relevant:\n\n1.  **Modular Curves:** `X_0(N) = Γ_0(N)\\H^2`, where `Γ_0(N)` is the Hecke congruence subgroup of `SL_2(Z)`. For a squarefree `N`, the covolume is `V = Area(X_0(N)) = (π/3) * N * Π_{p|N} (1 + 1/p)`.\n2.  **Shimura Curves:** `X_N = Γ_N\\H^2`, where `Γ_N` is an arithmetic group derived from a quaternion algebra over `Q` with discriminant `N`. For a squarefree `N`, the covolume is `V = Area(X_N) ∝ Π_{p|N} (p-1)`.\n\nIn both cases, the covolume `V` grows roughly linearly with `N`. Therefore, a bound in terms of `N` can be translated into a bound in terms of `V`.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Bound (The Sup-Norm Problem)\n\nWe are seeking an upper bound for `||φ||_∞`, where `φ` is an `L^2`-normalized Hecke-Maass eigenform on the surface `X_N` (this represents the case of weight `k=0` modular forms). The normalization condition is `∫_{X_N} |φ(z)|^2 dμ(z) = 1`, where `dμ` is the hyperbolic area element.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in modern analytic number theory called the **sup-norm problem**. The goal is to find bounds for `||φ||_∞` in terms of the parameters of the surface (like `V`) and the Laplace eigenvalue `λ` of the form `φ`. The question here focuses on the dependence on `V` (the \"level aspect\").\n\nThe \"trivial bound\" that follows from the mean value property and the `L^2`-normalization gives a bound that grows with `λ`, but doesn't show the decay with `V` that is expected from the principle of quantum unique ergodicity.\n\nDeep results have been established providing non-trivial bounds that show a decay as `V` increases. For Hecke-Maass newforms on `X_0(N)`, the state-of-the-art result is due to Valentin Blomer.\n\n**Theorem (Blomer, 2013):** Let `φ` be an `L^2`-normalized Hecke-Maass newform of level `N`. Then for any `ε > 0`, its sup-norm is bounded by:\n`||φ||_∞ <<_ε N^{-1/6+ε}`\nThe constant in `<<_ε` depends only on `ε`. This bound is uniform in the eigenvalue `λ`. Similar bounds exist for holomorphic modular forms.\n\n### Step 4: Expressing the Bound in Terms of Covolume `V`\n\nNow we translate this result into a bound in terms of the covolume `V`.\n\n1.  As established in Step 2, `V` is of the order of `N`. More precisely, `V = c_N * N`, where `c_N` is a factor that varies slowly with `N` (for `X_0(N)`, `c_N = (π/3) Π_{p|N} (1+1/p)`, which is bounded between `π/3` and `O(log log N)`).\n2.  Therefore, `N` is of the order of `V`. We can write `N ≈ V/c_N`.\n3.  Substituting this into the bound:\n    `||φ||_∞ <<_ε (V/c_N)^{-1/6+ε} = V^{-1/6+ε} * (c_N)^{1/6-ε}`\n4.  Since `c_N` grows very slowly (sub-polynomially in `V`), for any `δ > 0`, we can absorb the `c_N` factor into the `ε` by choosing a slightly larger exponent, leading to the simplified asymptotic bound:\n    `||φ||_∞ = O_ε(V^{-1/6+ε})`\n\nThis provides an upper bound for the `L^∞`-norm of the automorphic form in terms of the covolume `V`.\n\n### Careful Points and Alternative Interpretations\n\n*   **Systole:** Another important invariant of a hyperbolic surface is its **systole**, the length of the shortest closed geodesic. The systole `l_X` can be bounded above by `l_X ≤ C log(V)` for some constant `C`. While this is a valid upper bound relating a geometric quantity to the covolume, the phrasing \"maximum norm\" and the notation `k_{k,∞}` make it a less likely interpretation.\n*   **The Power of the Bound:** The bound `O(V^{-1/6+ε})` is a very strong statement, indicating that as the surface becomes larger (i.e., `V → ∞`), the maximum amplitude of a normalized wave form on it actually *decreases*. This is a profound consequence of the underlying arithmetic structure. The conjectured optimal bound is `O_ε(V^{-1/2+ε})`.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe most reasonable interpretation of the question, given the terminology and notation, points to the sup-norm problem for automorphic forms. The upper bound is derived from major results in analytic number theory. The final answer is an expression showing a power-law decay with the covolume.\n\n<<<O(V^{-1/6+ε})>>>"
