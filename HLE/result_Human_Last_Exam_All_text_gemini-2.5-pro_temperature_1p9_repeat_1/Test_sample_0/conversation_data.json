    "An analysis of which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nCritical-level views in population ethics evaluate the goodness of a population based on the sum of individual utilities, but with a twist. They propose a \"critical level\" of welfare, let's call it `c`, where `c > 0`.\n\n*   The value of a population is calculated as the sum of (`utility of person i` - `c`) for every person `i`.\n*   Value = Σ(uᵢ - c)\n*   Adding a person with utility `u` is considered good only if `u > c`.\n*   Adding a person with utility `u` is considered bad if `u < c`. This is true even if the person has a life worth living (i.e., `u > 0`).\n*   Adding a person with utility `u = c` has a neutral effect on the total value.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Conditions of Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's theorem states that no population axiology can simultaneously satisfy five seemingly plausible conditions. To find which one critical-level views violate, we must test them against each condition.\n\n1.  **Weak Quality Addition (WQA):** For any population, it's possible to make it better by adding some number of people with a very high quality of life.\n    *   *Analysis:* In a critical-level view, no matter how high the critical level `c` is, we can always imagine a \"very high quality of life\" `u` such that `u > c`. Adding people with this utility `u` would increase the total value (since `u - c` is positive). Thus, **critical-level views satisfy WQA.**\n\n2.  **Weak Non-Sadism (WNS):** Adding people whose lives are not worth living (i.e., they have negative welfare, `u < 0`) can never make a population better.\n    *   *Analysis:* A critical-level `c` is positive (`c > 0`). If a new person has negative welfare (`u < 0`), then `u` is definitely less than `c`. Therefore, the contribution of this person to the total value is `u - c`, which is a negative number. This addition will always decrease the total value of the population. Thus, **critical-level views satisfy WNS.**\n\n3.  **Non-Elitism (NE):** For a fixed number of people, a population where everyone is better off is a better population. More formally, a population of `n` people at welfare `y` is better than a population of `n` people at welfare `x`, provided `y > x`.\n    *   *Analysis:* Let Population A have `n` people at welfare `x`, and Population B have `n` people at welfare `y`, with `y > x`.\n        *   Value(A) = n * (x - c)\n        *   Value(B) = n * (y - c)\n    *   Since `y > x`, it follows that `(y - c) > (x - c)`. Therefore, Value(B) > Value(A). **Critical-level views satisfy Non-Elitism.**\n\n4.  **Egalitarian Dominance (ED):** This condition is designed to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion. It states that a population of `n` people at a very high welfare level is better than a population consisting of those same `n` people at a slightly lower level, plus a very large number of extra people living lives at a low but positive welfare level.\n    *   *Analysis:* This is precisely where critical-level views shine. Let the \"low but positive welfare level\" be `u_low`. A critical-level view can set its critical level `c` such that `c > u_low`. In this case, adding the very large number of extra people is a bad thing, as each person contributes a negative value (`u_low - c`). This negative value can easily outweigh the small welfare loss of the original `n` people, making the original population better. Thus, **critical-level views satisfy Egalitarian Dominance.**\n\n5.  **General Non-Extreme Priority (GNEP):** For *any* positive welfare level `x`, there is a scenario where a welfare loss for one person can be compensated for by adding a sufficient number of new people at that level `x`.\n    *   *Analysis:* This is the crucial point of failure. The condition states this must hold for *any* positive welfare level `x > 0`. Let's pick a level `x` that is positive but *below the critical level*, i.e., `0 < x < c`.\n    *   According to a critical-level view, adding a person at level `x` makes the world worse, because their contribution to total value (`x - c`) is negative.\n    *   The GNEP condition asks if we can compensate for a welfare loss (which is a bad thing) by adding a sufficient number of people at level `x`.\n    *   But since adding people at level `x` is *also a bad thing* (it reduces total value), we are being asked if one bad thing can be compensated for by adding more of another bad thing. This is impossible. The more people we add at level `x < c`, the worse the population becomes, making it impossible to compensate for any other loss.\n    *   Therefore, critical-level views fail this condition for any chosen welfare level `x` that falls below the critical level `c`. **Critical-level views violate General Non-Extreme Priority.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCritical-level views satisfy WQA, WNS, NE, and ED. They fail to satisfy GNEP because they claim that adding people with lives worth living but below a certain critical level is a bad thing, which directly contradicts the GNEP's premise that adding people at *any* positive level can be used as a form of compensation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
