    "This question asks us to trace the descendants of a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verbal root into several ancient Germanic languages. This involves applying a series of historical sound changes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form:**\n    *   The root is `*seh₂g-`, with the meaning 'to track, perceive, seek out'.\n    *   The example `*seh₂gieti` is a present tense verb form.\n    *   The Latin `sāgīre` and Hittite `sākizzi` are cognates that confirm the reconstruction. In Latin, the sequence `*eh₂` became `ā`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While Latin and Hittite show an \"e-grade\" vowel (`e`) in the root, Germanic languages often generalize a different vowel grade (ablaut form). We must look at the Germanic descendants to determine which grade they inherited. Forms like Gothic `sōkjan` and Old High German `suohhen` point to a root vowel `*ō` in Proto-Germanic. This derives from the PIE \"o-grade\" form of the root, `*soh₂g-`. It is common for one branch of Indo-European to generalize one ablaut grade of a root while another branch generalizes a different one. Therefore, we will trace the PIE o-grade `*soh₂g-` into Germanic.\n\n2.  **Derivation in Proto-Germanic (PGmc.):**\n    *   **Vowel Change:** In the PIE o-grade `*soh₂g-`, the sequence of a short vowel (`o`) plus a laryngeal (`h₂`) lengthens the vowel. The `*h₂` laryngeal has no coloring effect on an `o`. The result is `*sōg-`.\n    *   **Grimm's Law:** This is a series of consonant shifts from PIE to PGmc. The relevant change here affects the PIE voiced stop `*g`, which becomes the PGmc. voiceless stop `*k`. So, `*sōg-` becomes `*sōk-`.\n    *   **Verb Formation:** The PIE present tense suffix `*-ie-` corresponds to the Proto-Germanic suffix for Class I weak verbs, `*-janą`.\n    *   **Final PGmc. Form:** Combining the root `*sōk-` with the suffix gives the infinitive **`*sōkjaną`**.\n\n3.  **Derivation in Old Norse (ON):**\n    *   Start with PGmc. `*sōkjaną`.\n    *   **i-Umlaut:** The `/j/` sound (written `j`) in the suffix causes the preceding back vowel `*ō` to be fronted. The fronted equivalent of `*ō` in Old Norse is `œ` (a long, rounded front vowel, phonetically /øː/).\n    *   **Loss of /j/:** The `/j/` is lost after a heavy syllable (one with a long vowel or a vowel plus more than one consonant). `sōk-` is a heavy syllable.\n    *   **Final ON Form:** The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-a`. This results in **`sœkja`** (often also written `sækja`).\n\n4.  **Derivation in Old English (OE):**\n    *   Start with PGmc. `*sōkjaną`.\n    *   **i-Umlaut:** As in Old Norse, the `/j/` in the suffix triggers the fronting of the root vowel `*ō`. In Old English, the i-umlaut of `*ō` is `ē`.\n    *   **Palatalization:** The consonant `*k` (spelled `c` in OE) was palatalized to /tʃ/ when it came before a front vowel. The new vowel `ē` created by umlaut caused this change.\n    *   **Loss of /j/ and Final Syllable:** The `/j/` is lost, and the infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an`.\n    *   **Final OE Form:** The result is **`sēcan`** (pronounced roughly as \"seh-chan\").\n\n5.  **Derivation in Old High German (OHG):**\n    *   Start with PGmc. `*sōkjaną`.\n    *   **High German Consonant Shift:** This shift is characteristic of High German dialects. PGmc. `*k` shifts to the long voiceless fricative `hh` (written `hh` or `ch`) when it follows a vowel. So, `*sōkjaną` becomes `*sōhhjaną`.\n    *   **OHG Diphthongization:** The PGmc. long vowel `*ō` becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German. So, `*sōhhjaną` becomes `*suohhjaną`.\n    *   **Blocking of i-Umlaut:** In Old High German, i-umlaut was often blocked from affecting back vowels across a heavy syllable. Therefore, the `uo` does not change to `üe`. The `/j/` is subsequently lost.\n    *   **Final Syllable:** The infinitive ending becomes `-en`.\n    *   **Final OHG Form:** The result is **`suohhen`**.\n\n### Summary of Results:\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkjaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkja` (or `sækja`)\n*   **Old English:** `sēcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkjaną\nOld Norse: sœkja\nOld English: sēcan\nOld High German: suohhen>>>"
