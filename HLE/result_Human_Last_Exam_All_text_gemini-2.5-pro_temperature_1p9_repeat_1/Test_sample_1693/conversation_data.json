    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for a specific ship based on four key criteria:\n1.  **Nationality:** The ship must be French.\n2.  **Cause of Sinking:** It must have been sunk by a German U-boat.\n3.  **Timeframe:** The sinking must have occurred *before* the Franco-German armistice, which was signed on 22 June 1940. This means the relevant period is from the start of the war on 1 September 1939 until 21 June 1940, inclusive.\n4.  **Size Metric:** The ship must be the largest measured by displacement.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Criteria and Identifying Potential Candidates\n\n**Careful Point 1: French Naval Losses**\nFirst, we must examine major French warships (which are typically measured in displacement) sunk during this period. Research shows that no French battleships, aircraft carriers, or cruisers were sunk by U-boats before the June 1940 armistice. The only French warship confirmed to have been sunk by a U-boat in this timeframe was the submarine **Doris (Q135)**, sunk by *U-9* on 9 May 1940. With a displacement of only about 600 tons, it was not a large vessel. Other major warships were lost to aircraft, mines (not laid by U-boats), accidents, or were sunk by the British at Mers-el-KÃ©bir *after* the armistice. Therefore, the answer must be a large merchant ship.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Merchant Ships and \"Displacement\"**\nMerchant ships are usually measured by Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a measure of volume, not by displacement, which is a measure of weight. However, displacement figures can be found or reasonably estimated for large vessels. A ship's full load displacement (its actual weight when fully loaded) is typically higher than its GRT, especially for dense cargo ships like tankers.\n\n**Careful Point 3: What does \"sunk by a U-boat\" mean?**\nThis can mean a direct attack by torpedo or gunfire from a U-boat. It can also be interpreted to include sinking by a mine that was laid by a U-boat. Naval records and historical sources generally credit the U-boat that laid the mine with the sinking. This is a crucial distinction.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Top Candidates\n\nWith the above points in mind, we can identify the largest French merchant ships sunk by German U-boats within the specified timeframe. Two primary candidates emerge:\n\n1.  **The Tanker *Emile Miguet***\n    *   **Sinking:** Torpedoed and sunk by the U-boat *U-48* on 12 October 1939.\n    *   **Size:** At 14,115 GRT, it was one of the largest tankers in the world at the time. Its full load displacement is estimated to have been around **27,400 tons**.\n    *   **Analysis:** This sinking fits all criteria perfectly: French, sunk by a U-boat (direct attack), before the armistice. Its displacement makes it a very strong candidate.\n\n2.  **The Passenger Liner *Champlain***\n    *   **Sinking:** Struck a mine and sank off the coast of La Pallice on 17 June 1940. The mine was part of a field laid by the German U-boat *U-65*.\n    *   **Size:** A very large passenger liner of 28,124 GRT. Her displacement is recorded as approximately **33,700 tons**.\n    *   **Analysis:** The sinking date (17 June 1940) is just before the armistice. As the sinking was caused by a mine laid by a U-boat, it qualifies as being \"sunk by a U-boat\". Comparing its displacement (~33,700 tons) to the *Emile Miguet*'s (~27,400 tons), the *Champlain* was significantly larger.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBy comparing the two strongest candidates, the passenger liner **SS *Champlain*** was larger by displacement than the tanker *Emile Miguet*. Both ships were French and were sunk by U-boats (one by direct attack, one by a U-boat-laid mine) before the 22 June 1940 armistice. Since the *Champlain* had a higher displacement, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<The SS Champlain"
