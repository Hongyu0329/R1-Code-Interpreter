    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the word and its reading:** The word is 「弟」, which is read as 「おとうと」 (otouto) in standard Japanese when referring to one's own younger brother.\n\n2.  **Count the morae:** The word 「おとうと」 is composed of four morae (sound units):\n    *   お (o)\n    *   と (to)\n    *   う (u) - This mora lengthens the vowel of the preceding 'to'\n    *   と (to)\n\n3.  **Understand the pitch accent patterns:**\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. In pitch accent notation, this is type [0]. Example pronunciation for a 4-mora word with a particle 「が」 (ga): L-H-H-H-H.\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops for all subsequent morae. In notation, this is type [1]. Example: H-L-L-L-L.\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *within* the word. For a 4-mora word, the accent nucleus could be on the 2nd or 3rd mora (types [2] or [3]). Example for type [3]: L-H-H-L-L.\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高):** The pitch starts low, rises, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the particle that follows. For a 4-mora word, this is type [4]. Example: L-H-H-H-L.\n\n4.  **Determine the specific pitch accent of 「弟」 (おとうと):**\n    *   The standard pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is type [0].\n    *   Let's apply the type [0] pattern, which is Heiban, to the word.\n    *   The first mora, 「お」, is pronounced with a low pitch.\n    *   The pitch rises on the second mora, 「と」, and stays high for the remaining morae, 「う」 and 「と」.\n    *   The resulting pitch contour is: お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H).\n    *   If a particle like 「が」 is attached, it also remains high: お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(H).\n    *   This perfectly matches the description of the **Heiban** pattern.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the standard rules of Japanese pitch accent, 「弟」 (おとうと) follows the Heiban pattern.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Do not confuse morae with syllables. 「とう」 is one syllable but two morae (to-u). Pitch accent applies to morae.\n    *   The pitch accent number (e.g., [0], [1]) indicates the mora *before* the pitch drops. A [0] means there is no drop within the word or after it, hence the Heiban pattern.\n    *   Standard Japanese (Hyojungo/Tokyo dialect) pitch accent is being considered, as is typical for such questions unless specified otherwise.\n\nThe final answer is **A**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
