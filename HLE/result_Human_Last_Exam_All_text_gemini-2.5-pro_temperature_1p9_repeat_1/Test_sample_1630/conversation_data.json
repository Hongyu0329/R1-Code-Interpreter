    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe need to find the maximum number of fixed points for the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a value of $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Functions**\n*   **$f(x)$ and $g(x)$:** Both are polynomials of degree 3.\n    *   Let $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n    *   Let $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   **Derivatives $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$:**\n    *   $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$.\n    *   $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$.\n*   **Conditions $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$:**\n    *   The derivatives are quadratic polynomials. For a quadratic to be always positive, it must open upwards and have no real roots.\n    *   For $f'(x) > 0$: The leading coefficient $3a_3$ must be positive (so $a_3 > 0$), and the discriminant must be negative ($(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0$).\n    *   For $g'(x) > 0$: Similarly, $b_3 > 0$ and $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0$.\n    *   A key consequence of these conditions is that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all real numbers $x$.\n\n**3. Determine the Degree of the Fixed-Point Equation**\n*   Let's analyze the equation for the fixed points: $f(g(x)) = x$.\n*   This can be written as $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n*   The function $f(g(x))$ is a composition of two degree-3 polynomials. The degree of the composition is the product of their degrees.\n*   Degree of $f(g(x)) = (\\text{Degree of } f) \\times (\\text{Degree of } g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The equation $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$ involves a polynomial of degree 9.\n*   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots.\n*   Therefore, the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ can have at most 9 real solutions. This means there can be at most 9 fixed points.\n\n**4. Verify if 9 Fixed Points is Achievable**\nThe maximum possible number of fixed points is 9. We now need to determine if this maximum can actually be achieved under the given constraints ($f'>0, g'>0$).\n\n*   A common misconception is that because $f(g(x))$ is strictly increasing (its derivative $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a product of two positive functions, hence positive), it can only cross the line $y=x$ once. This is incorrect. A function can be strictly increasing and still cross a strictly increasing line multiple times. For example, $h(x) = x^3 + 0.5x$ is strictly increasing, but $h(x)=x$ has three solutions ($x=0, \\pm\\sqrt{0.5}$).\n*   To have 9 distinct real roots for the degree-9 polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$, its derivative, $P'(x)$, must have 8 distinct real roots according to Rolle's Theorem. This would create 8 local extrema (4 maxima and 4 minima), allowing the graph of $P(x)$ to cross the x-axis 9 times.\n*   Let's examine the derivative: $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n*   The roots of $P'(x)$ occur where $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$.\n*   Let's determine the degree of the polynomial $Q(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$:\n    *   $g(x)$ is degree 3.\n    *   $f'(x)$ is degree 2. So, $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times (\\text{degree of } g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is degree 2.\n    *   Therefore, $Q(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   The equation for the roots of $P'(x)$ is $Q(x) = 1$, which is an 8th-degree polynomial equation. This equation can have up to 8 real roots.\n*   An 8th-degree polynomial with a positive leading coefficient (which $Q(x)$ has, since $a_3>0, b_3>0$) can be constructed to have 4 local minima and 3 local maxima. By choosing the parameters of $f$ and $g$ appropriately, it is possible to make these minima fall below $y=1$ and the maxima rise above $y=1$. This would create 8 intersections with the line $y=1$, meaning $P'(x)$ can have 8 real roots.\n*   If $P'(x)$ has 8 real roots, $P(x)$ has 8 local extrema. By adjusting the constant term of $f(x)$ (which does not affect $f'(x)$), we can shift the graph of $P(x)$ vertically to ensure all 4 local maxima are positive and all 4 local minima are negative. This guarantees 9 distinct real roots for $P(x)=0$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe problem reduces to finding the maximum number of real roots of a degree-9 polynomial. Algebraically, this maximum is 9. The analysis shows that the constraints on the derivatives, while ensuring the functions are strictly increasing, do not impose any further restrictions that would lower this maximum number. The function $f(g(x))-x$ is not necessarily monotonic, and its polynomial nature allows for up to 9 roots. This maximum is achievable by a suitable choice of polynomials $f$ and $g$.\n\nThe maximum number of fixed points is 9."
