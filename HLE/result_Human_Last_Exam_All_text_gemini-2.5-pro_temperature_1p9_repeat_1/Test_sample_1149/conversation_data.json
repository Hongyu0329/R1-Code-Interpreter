    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the subject and anatomical feature:** The question is about the dinosaur species *Irritator challengeri* and a specific feature on its skull called the \"lacrimal recess\". The lacrimal is a bone that is part of the skull, typically located in front of the eye socket. A recess is a depression or cavity. The question asks how many smaller depressions are contained within this main lacrimal recess.\n\n2.  **Consult scientific sources:** To answer a specific anatomical question about a dinosaur, we must refer to the paleontological literature that describes its fossils. The primary scientific paper describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri* in detail is \"Irritator challengeri, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott (2002). This paper provides a thorough re-description of the holotype specimen (SMNS 58022).\n\n3.  **Locate the relevant description:** Within the Sues et al. (2002) paper, the section on the \"Lacrimal\" bone describes the feature in question. It notes the presence of a \"large, deep, triangular recess\" on the external surface of the lacrimal bone.\n\n4.  **Analyze the detailed anatomy:** The paper goes on to describe the internal structure of this lacrimal recess. It explicitly states that the recess is \"subdivided by a thin vertical ridge\".\n\n5.  **Determine the number of depressions:** The subdivision by this ridge creates distinct compartments within the main recess. The authors describe these compartments as:\n    *   A large, deep, subtriangular anterior depression.\n    *   A much smaller and shallower, subcircular posterior depression.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The presence of this dividing ridge results in two separate depressions within the larger lacrimal recess. Therefore, the lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains two depressions.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the main \"lacrimal recess\" and the smaller \"depressions\" contained *within* it. The question is asking for the number of these smaller, subdivided depressions.\n*   Relying on primary, peer-reviewed scientific literature is essential for accuracy in paleontological questions, as this is where the original descriptions and analyses are found.\n*   The specific terminology used in the scientific paper (e.g., \"subdivided,\" \"anterior depression,\" \"posterior depression\") is key to reaching the correct count.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the detailed anatomical description of the holotype skull of *Irritator challengeri*, the lacrimal recess is subdivided by a ridge into two smaller depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
