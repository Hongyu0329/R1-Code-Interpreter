    "This request requires the scansion of a line of Latin poetry, which involves analyzing each syllable to determine if it is long or short and then grouping these syllables into metrical feet.\n\n**The Line:**\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Meter:** The line is from the Roman playwright Plautus. The structure and length (15 syllables, as will be shown) are characteristic of a **Trochaic Septenarius**. This meter consists of seven trochaic feet (— ∪, or L S) followed by a final, catalectic syllable (a syllable that completes the final foot). The pattern is:\n    `L S | L S | L S | L S || L S | L S | L S | x`\n    (where L=Long, S=Short, | = foot division, || = caesura/main pause, x = final syllable, either L or S)\n\n2.  **Syllabification and Basic Quantities:** First, we determine the natural length of each syllable.\n    *   A syllable is **long by position** if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (x and z count as two).\n    *   A syllable is **long by nature** if its vowel is inherently long (e.g., vowels in diphthongs like `ae`, `au`, `oe` or those marked with a macron like `ā`).\n    *   Otherwise, a syllable is generally **short**.\n\n3.  **Applying Special Rules for Comic Verse (Plautus):**\n    *   **Hiatus:** Plautus often allows a word ending in a vowel to be followed by a word starting with a vowel without elision (dropping the first vowel). In this line, to achieve the 15 syllables required for the meter, we assume a hiatus between `bene` and `esse`.\n        `...be-ne | es-se...` (Two separate words are pronounced) instead of `...benesse...` (elision).\n    *   **Archaic Quantities:** In early Latin poetry, the final `-i` in dative singulars like `tibi` and `sibi` could be treated as long. This is a crucial feature for making the line scan correctly. We will scan them as `tibī` and `sibī`.\n\n4.  **Detailed Scansion (Foot by Foot):**\n\n    *   Line syllabified with hiatus: `et / ti / bi / be / ne / es / se / so / li / quom / si / bi / sit / ma / le`\n\n    *   **Foot 1: `et ti`**\n        *   `et`: **L** (Long by position; it's a closed syllable ending in 't').\n        *   `ti-`: **S** (The 'i' in `tibi` is short by nature).\n        *   Result: `L S` (A perfect trochee).\n\n    *   **Foot 2: `bī be`**\n        *   `-bī`: **L** (The second syllable of `tibi` is scanned as long, `tibī`, a feature of early Latin verse).\n        *   `be-`: **S** (The first syllable of `bene` is short by nature).\n        *   Result: `L S` (A perfect trochee).\n\n    *   **Foot 3: `ne es`**\n        *   `ne`: **S** (The second syllable of `bene` is short by nature).\n        *   `es-`: **L** (The first syllable of `esse` is long by position, followed by 'ss').\n        *   Result: `S L` (An iamb, which is a common substitution for a trochee).\n\n    *   **Foot 4: `se sō`** (This is the location of the main caesura)\n        *   `-se`: **S** (The second syllable of `esse` is short by nature).\n        *   `sō-`: **L** (The first syllable of `sōlī` is long by nature).\n        *   Result: `S L` (An iamb, a valid substitution).\n\n    *   **Foot 5: `lī quom`**\n        *   `-lī`: **L** (The second syllable of `sōlī` is long by nature).\n        *   `quom`: **L** (Archaic form of `cum`, long because it ends in 'm').\n        *   Result: `L L` (A spondee, a common substitution for a trochee).\n\n    *   **Foot 6: `si bī`**\n        *   `si-`: **S** (The first syllable of `sibi` is short by nature).\n        *   `-bī`: **L** (The second syllable of `sibi` is scanned as long, `sibī`, like `tibi`).\n        *   Result: `S L` (An iamb, a valid substitution).\n\n    *   **Foot 7: `sit ma`**\n        *   `sit`: **L** (Long by position, ending in 't').\n        *   `ma-`: **S** (The first syllable of `male` is short by nature).\n        *   Result: `L S` (A perfect trochee).\n\n    *   **Final Syllable (Catalexis): `le`**\n        *   `-le`: **S** (The final syllable of `male` is short). This fits the metrical scheme, where the final position is anceps (can be long or short).\n\n**Final Result:**\nCombining the feet with spaces in between gives the final scansion.\n\n<<<L S L S S L S L L L S L L S S>>>"
