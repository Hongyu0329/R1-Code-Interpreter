    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theologian in question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Who:** A Christian theologian.\n*   **What:** Developed \"specialized terminology.\"\n*   **Purpose of terminology:** To describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\"\n*   **Two specific applications:**\n    1.  The virgin birth of Jesus (a miracle, or suspension of natural law).\n    2.  Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall of Man (a systemic change in how nature operates).\n\nThe key is to find a single theologian whose specific vocabulary addresses both a unique, singular event like a miracle and a permanent, systemic alteration of the natural order.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Theological Problems**\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** This is a classic example of a miracle. The challenge for theologians is to explain how God can act in a way that supersedes the normal, observable processes of nature (in this case, biological reproduction) without being illogical or making God seem arbitrary. The explanation needs to account for God's power over the nature He created.\n*   **The Fall's Effect on Nature:** This is a more complex doctrine. It posits that Adam and Eve's sin did not just have spiritual and moral consequences but also fundamentally changed the physical world. This could include the introduction of human mortality, pain in childbirth, the ground yielding thorns and thistles, and carnivorous behavior among animals. This requires a framework that allows for the \"laws of nature\" themselves to be altered from one state (pre-Fall) to another (post-Fall).\n\n**Step 3: Consider Potential Candidates**\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas:** A major candidate. He developed the concepts of Primary and Secondary Causality. God is the Primary Cause of everything, while natural laws and processes are Secondary Causes. A miracle occurs when God (the Primary Cause) acts directly, bypassing the ordinary chain of Secondary Causes. This masterfully explains miracles, but it is less focused on a permanent *alteration* of the secondary causes themselves, as required by the Fall doctrine.\n*   **John Calvin:** He emphasized God's meticulous providence and absolute sovereignty. For Calvin, everything that happens, normal or miraculous, is a direct result of God's decree. While he certainly affirmed the virgin birth and the corruption of nature after the Fall, he is less known for developing a specific *metaphysical terminology* for the mechanism of this change, focusing more on the theological reality of God's will.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo:** This is the strongest candidate. He engaged deeply with the nature of creation, time, and causality, particularly in his commentaries on Genesis and in *The City of God*. He was forced to explain how God could create \"all things at once\" (as some Scripture passages suggest) while things also develop over time.\n\n**Step 4: Examine Augustine's Specialized Terminology**\n\nTo solve this problem, Augustine developed the concept of ***rationes seminales***, which translates to **\"seminal reasons\"** or **\"causal principles.\"**\n\n*   **What are they?** Augustine theorized that in the initial act of creation, God embedded all the latent potentialities for everything that would ever develop naturally into the fabric of the world. A tree is not created fully formed from nothing; rather, the \"seminal reason\" for the tree is placed in the seed, which then develops over time according to this built-in principle. This network of principles constitutes the normal \"course of nature.\"\n\n**Step 5: Apply Augustine's Terminology to the Two Cases**\n\n1.  **The Virgin Birth:** According to Augustine's framework, the virgin birth did not arise from a created *ratio seminalis* (i.e., the natural principle of sexual reproduction). Instead, it was caused directly by God, who is the author of all *rationes seminales*. Therefore, the event is not *contrary to nature* (since God is nature's creator) but it is *beyond the usual course of nature* (praeter usitatum cursum naturae). The terminology provides a clear distinction.\n\n2.  **Alterations at the Fall:** The concept of *rationes seminales* is uniquely suited to explain a systemic change in nature. Augustine could argue that before the Fall, the created order and humanity operated according to one set of principles—those for harmony, immortality, and easy sustenance. The act of sin corrupted the created order, causing a different set of latent \"seminal reasons\" to become active—those for death, decay, pain, and toil (\"thorns and thistles\"). Thus, the \"laws of nature\" as humanity experiences them were fundamentally altered, a change made possible within the potentiality of the original creation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAugustine of Hippo is the theologian who developed the specialized terminology of ***rationes seminales*** (seminal reasons), which he used to explain how the natural order functions, how miracles like the virgin birth can occur outside that normal order, and how the entire system of natural laws could have been altered as a consequence of the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
