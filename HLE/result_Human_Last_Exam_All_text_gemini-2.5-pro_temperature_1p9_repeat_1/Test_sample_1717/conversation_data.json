    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.**\nFirst, we need the boss's starting health value before any multiplayer scaling is applied.\n*   In Normal Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 2,800.\n*   The game's source code for Expert Mode applies a health multiplier to bosses. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its health is multiplied by 2.0 when an Expert Mode world is generated.\n*   Therefore, the base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in single-player Expert Mode is `2800 * 2.0 = 5600 HP`. This is the value upon which multiplayer scaling will be based.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the multiplayer health scaling formula.**\nIn Terraria, boss health increases as more players are active on the server. This scaling is different for Normal, Expert, and Master modes.\n*   For Expert Mode, boss health is increased by 35% for each active player. The generally accepted formula reflecting the game's behavior is:\n    `Total Health = BaseExpertHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))`\n*   For one player, the multiplier is `(1 + 0.35 * 0) = 1`, resulting in 5600 health.\n*   For two players, the multiplier is `(1 + 0.35 * 1) = 1.35`, resulting in `5600 * 1.35 = 7560` health.\n*   As the number of players (`N`) approaches infinity, this scaling factor `(1 + 0.35 * (N-1))` also approaches infinity.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the cap on health scaling.**\nWhile the formula suggests health could scale infinitely, the game's source code imposes a hard limit on the total multiplayer health multiplier to prevent absurdly high values.\n*   In the `NPC.ScaleStats_Main` function, which handles this scaling, the final health multiplier (`healthScale`) is clamped to a maximum value.\n*   For Expert Mode, this clamp sets the maximum possible value for the `healthScale` multiplier to **30**.\n*   This means that no matter how many players are in the game (even an infinite number), the health of the Eye of Cthulhu cannot be scaled by a factor greater than 30.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the theoretical maximum health.**\nWith the base Expert Mode health and the maximum scaling multiplier identified, we can now calculate the theoretical maximum health.\n*   Base Expert Health: 5600 HP\n*   Maximum Health Scale Multiplier: 30\n*   Theoretical Maximum Health = `BaseExpertHealth * MaxHealthMultiplier`\n*   Calculation: `5600 * 30 = 168,000 HP`.\n\n**Step 5: Consider the effect of the second phase.**\nIn Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu transforms into its second phase at 65% health. During this transition, it is possible for its health to be set to a minimum floor of 65% of its maximum HP if it was dropped lower by burst damage. However, this mechanic does not add health to its total health pool (`lifeMax`). It merely prevents players from skipping the second phase. The total amount of damage required to defeat the boss from start to finish remains its scaled `lifeMax`. Therefore, this behavior does not alter the theoretical maximum health value.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Expert Mode Modifier vs. Multiplayer Scaling:** It is crucial to distinguish between the initial 2x health multiplier for creating an Expert Mode boss and the separate, dynamic health scaling based on player count.\n2.  **Health Scaling Cap:** The single most important factor for this question is the hard-coded cap on the multiplayer health multiplier. Without this clamp, the theoretical health would be infinite.\n3.  **Theoretical vs. Practical:** The question asks for the *theoretical* maximum, assuming an infinite number of players. In a real game, the maximum number of players is 255, but the scaling cap is reached with far fewer players than that.\n4.  **Phase Transition Mechanics:** Boss phase transitions in Expert Mode can have unique mechanics (like setting a health floor). It's important to analyze whether these mechanics add to the total health pool or simply alter the flow of the fight. For the Eye of Cthulhu, it does not add to the total health.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   Base Health (Normal Mode): 2,800\n*   Base Health (Expert Mode, 1 Player): 2,800 * 2.0 = 5,600\n*   Maximum Multiplayer Health Scale Factor (Expert Mode): 30x\n*   Theoretical Maximum Health: 5,600 * 30 = 168,000\n\n<<<168000>>>"
