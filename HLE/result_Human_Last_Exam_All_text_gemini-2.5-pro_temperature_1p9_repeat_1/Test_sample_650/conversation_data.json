    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the given algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal of the Algorithm**\nThe algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and a base `c` (where `c ≥ 2`) and computes the representation of `n` in base `c`. For example, `IMAG(13, 2)` would produce the binary representation (1, 1, 0, 1), because 13 = 1*2³ + 1*2² + 0*2¹ + 1*2⁰. The algorithm essentially performs repeated division and modulus operations to find the digits `a_i`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Cost of Individual Operations**\nTo determine the time complexity, we will assume a standard computational model (like the Random Access Machine or RAM model) where basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor) and assignments take a constant amount of time, denoted as `O(1)`. This is a common assumption for analyzing algorithms when the input numbers `n` are not arbitrarily large (or when we are primarily interested in the number of high-level algorithmic steps).\n\n**3. Analyze the Initialization Phase (Step 1)**\nLet's break down the first step of the algorithm:\n*   `i := 0`: This is a single assignment operation. Cost: `O(1)`.\n*   `x := n`: Another single assignment operation. Cost: `O(1)`.\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: This involves one division and one floor operation. Cost: `O(1)`.\n*   `a_{0} := x — qc`: This involves one multiplication, one subtraction, and one assignment. Note that `x - ⌊x/c⌋*c` is the definition of `x mod c`. Cost: `O(1)`.\n\nThe total time for the initialization phase is the sum of these constant-time operations, which is `O(1)`.\n\n**4. Analyze the Loop Body (Step 2.1)**\nNow let's analyze the cost of a single pass through the `while` loop:\n*   `i := i + 1`: An increment operation. Cost: `O(1)`.\n*   `x := q`: An assignment operation. Cost: `O(1)`.\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: One division and one floor operation. Cost: `O(1)`.\n*   `a_{i} := x — qc`: One multiplication, one subtraction, and one assignment. Cost: `O(1)`.\n\nThe total cost for a single iteration of the `while` loop is the sum of these constant-time operations, which is `O(1)`.\n\n**5. Determine the Number of Loop Iterations**\nThe overall complexity of the algorithm is determined by how many times the `while` loop executes. The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. We need to find the number of iterations as a function of the input `n` and `c`.\n\n*   **Before the loop starts:** `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n*   **After the 1st iteration:** The old value of `q` (let's call it `q_0 = ⌊n/c⌋`) becomes the new `x`. The new `q` (let's call it `q_1`) becomes `⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊q_0/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`. Using the property `⌊⌊a/b⌋/d⌋ = ⌊a/(bd)⌋`, this simplifies to `q_1 = ⌊n/c^2⌋`.\n*   **After the 2nd iteration:** The new `q` will be `q_2 = ⌊n/c^3⌋`.\n*   **After `k` iterations:** The value of `q` will be `q_k = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n\nThe loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. We need to find the number of iterations `k` for which `q_k` becomes 0 for the first time.\n`q_k = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`\nThis equality holds if and only if:\n`n/c^(k+1) < 1`\n`n < c^(k+1)`\n\nTo find `k`, we can take the logarithm base `c` of both sides:\n`log_c(n) < k+1`\n`k > log_c(n) - 1`\n\nThe number of iterations is the number of times `q` is greater than 0. This is approximately `log_c(n)`. More formally, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋` if `n ≥ c` and 0 if `n < c`. Therefore, the number of loop iterations is bounded by a function proportional to `log_c(n)`.\nSo, the number of iterations is `O(log_c n)`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Computational Time Complexity**\nThe total time complexity is the sum of the time for initialization and the time for the loop.\n\nTotal Time = (Initialization Time) + (Number of Loop Iterations) × (Time per Iteration)\nTotal Time = `O(1)` + `O(log_c n) × O(1)`\nTotal Time = `O(1) + O(log_c n)`\nTotal Time = `O(log_c n)`\n\n**7. Simplify the Final Expression**\nIn Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm does not affect the complexity class. This is because of the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c` is a constant `(c ≥ 2)`, `log_b(c)` is also a constant. As Big-O notation ignores constant factors, `O(log_c n)` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Model of Computation:** The analysis relies on the assumption that basic arithmetic operations on integers take constant `O(1)` time. For very large numbers `n` (that exceed the computer's word size), this is not true, and the cost of division/multiplication depends on the number of bits in `n` (which is `O(log n)`). In such a \"logarithmic cost model\", the complexity would be `O((log n)^2)`. However, for standard algorithm analysis, the `O(1)` assumption for arithmetic is typical unless specified otherwise.\n*   **Input Parameters:** The complexity is a function of `n`. The base `c` is treated as a constant that affects the constant factors hidden by the Big-O notation but not the overall complexity class.\n*   **Return Step:** The final step returns the resulting sequence of digits. The length of this sequence is `i+1`, where `i` is the final value from the loop, which is `O(log_c n)`. Creating and returning this sequence would take `O(log_c n)` time, which is consistent with the overall complexity derived from the loop.\n\nBased on the standard analysis, the computational time complexity is determined by the number of loop iterations, which is logarithmic in `n`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
