    "To answer this question, we must carefully analyze the score for Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4,\" specifically focusing on the first violin part at the conclusion of the final (fourth) movement.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Ambiguity**\nThe phrase \"ends on three notes\" is potentially ambiguous. A symphony does not typically end on a sequence of three distinct melodic notes. More often, it concludes with a powerful, sustained chord held by the entire orchestra. The first violins often play one of the higher notes of this final chord. A literal interpretation would suggest the last three notes in the score for the first violin part are identical (three high D's). Therefore, the question likely refers to a prominent and distinct three-note musical phrase played by the first violins very close to the end of the piece.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Relevant Passage in the Score**\nWe need to examine the end of the 4th Movement (Finale: Allegro con fuoco). Looking at the score a few measures before the final, triumphant D major chords, there is a section marked *Poco meno mosso* (a little less motion). In this section, the tempo briefly slows, drawing attention to a melodic line in the violins.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Specific Three-Note Phrase**\nIn the third measure of this *Poco meno mosso* section (which is about 12 bars from the very end of the symphony), the first violins play a highly distinctive and exposed passage. It consists of exactly three quarter notes, played staccato. This phrase serves as a final thematic statement before the concluding section.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Pitches of the Three Notes**\nThe three notes in this specific phrase are, in order:\n1.  **A#** (A-sharp)\n2.  **B** (B-natural)\n3.  **C#** (C-sharp)\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Lowest Note**\nComparing the three pitches—A#, B, and C#—the lowest one is the first note of the phrase.\n\nThe lowest note is **A#** (A-sharp).\n\n<<<A#>>>"
