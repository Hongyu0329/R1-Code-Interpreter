    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal of the Question\nThe question asks to find the \"rule activation level\" for a given fuzzy rule, which is part of an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Logic System (IT3 FLS).\n\n### Step 2: Define \"Rule Activation Level\"\nIn fuzzy logic, a rule is typically in an \"IF-THEN\" format.\n*   The \"IF\" part is called the **antecedent**.\n*   The \"THEN\" part is called the **consequent**.\n\nThe **rule activation level** (also known as the firing strength or firing level) is a measure of the degree to which the antecedent part of the rule is satisfied by the current input. This value is calculated based *only* on the inputs and the antecedent fuzzy sets.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Provided Information\nLet's break down each piece of information given in the question:\n\n1.  **System Type: Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS)**\n    This tells us the fuzzy system is of a very high order of complexity, designed to handle extreme levels of uncertainty. In an IT3 FLS, the membership grades themselves are interval type-2 fuzzy sets. However, for this specific question, this information primarily provides context.\n\n2.  **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`**\n    *   `k` is the index of the fuzzy rule.\n    *   `x′` represents the input vector to the system.\n    *   The notation `Φ` (Phi) is standard in fuzzy systems literature to denote the final firing strength or activation level of a rule's antecedent.\n    *   Therefore, `Phi_k(x′)` represents the activation level of rule `k` for the input `x'`. The problem states this value is 0.7.\n\n3.  **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`**\n    *   `G_k_j` refers to the fuzzy set in the **consequent** (the \"THEN\" part) of rule `k`.\n    *   `y_j` is an output variable.\n    *   `μG_k_j(y_j)` is the membership degree of the output `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j`.\n    *   This value is part of the rule's output definition, not its activation level. The activation level is determined *before* considering the consequent.\n\n4.  **\"using a t-norm operation\"**\n    *   A t-norm (e.g., minimum, product) is a type of fuzzy logic operation used to implement the logical \"AND\" connector.\n    *   It is used to combine the membership grades of the input in multiple antecedent clauses (e.g., `IF x is A1 AND y is A2`). The result of this t-norm operation is the overall rule activation level.\n    *   Since the question provides `Phi_k(x′)`, which represents the final activation level, we can infer that the t-norm operation has already been performed to arrive at this value.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Analysis to Find the Answer\n\n1.  The core of the question is to find the **rule activation level**.\n2.  By definition, the rule activation level is the result of evaluating the rule's **antecedent** (\"IF\" part).\n3.  The value `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` is given, and this notation directly represents the activation level of the antecedent for rule `k`.\n4.  The value `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9` relates to the **consequent** (\"THEN\" part) and is therefore irrelevant for calculating the activation level. It is extraneous information.\n5.  The mention of \"t-norm\" and \"IT3 FS\" provides context on how this activation level would be calculated in a complete system, but the final value for the antecedent evaluation is explicitly provided.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe rule activation level is determined solely by the degree to which the rule's antecedent is satisfied. This value is explicitly given as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. The other information is not needed to answer the question.\n\nFinal Answer: The rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
