    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and atom count.**\nThe molecule is toluene, which has the chemical formula C7H8.\nThis means the molecule consists of:\n*   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The notation tells us how many basis functions are used for core and valence atomic orbitals.\n\n*   **For a Carbon (C) atom (a second-row element):**\n    *   **Core (1s orbital):** The number `6` before the hyphen indicates that the core 1s orbital is represented by **1 contracted Gaussian function**, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The `31G` after the hyphen indicates that the valence orbitals are split into two parts: an inner and an outer part.\n        *   **Inner Valence (`3`):** This part consists of one contracted function for the 2s orbital and three contracted functions for the 2p orbitals (px, py, pz). This gives a total of 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 contracted functions**.\n        *   **Outer Valence (`1G`):** This part also consists of one contracted function for the 2s orbital and three for the 2p orbitals (px, py, pz). This gives another 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 contracted functions**.\n    *   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n*   **For a Hydrogen (H) atom (a first-row element):**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital.\n    *   **Valence (1s orbital):** The `31G` means the 1s orbital is split into two parts.\n        *   **Inner Valence (`3`):** **1 contracted function** for the inner part of the 1s orbital.\n        *   **Outer Valence (`1G`):** **1 contracted function** for the outer part of the 1s orbital.\n    *   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of functions for the entire toluene molecule.**\nNow, we multiply the number of functions per atom by the number of atoms of that type in the molecule.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:**\n    *   7 C atoms × 9 functions/C atom = 63 functions\n\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:**\n    *   8 H atoms × 2 functions/H atom = 16 functions\n\n*   **Total for Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   Total functions = (Functions from Carbon) + (Functions from Hydrogen)\n    *   Total functions = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguish between Primitive and Contracted Gaussians:** The question asks for *contracted* functions. The numbers in the basis set name (6, 3, 1) refer to the number of *primitive* Gaussians used to build the contracted functions.\n*   **Split-Valence Correct Interpretation:** The `31` in 6-31G means the valence shell is described by two basis functions for each atomic orbital (e.g., 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz for Carbon), not two functions in total for the whole shell.\n*   **P-orbitals:** Remember that a \"p\" shell always consists of three individual orbitals (px, py, pz), and each one gets its own set of basis functions.\n*   **Atom Count:** Double-check the number of atoms for the given molecule (C7H8 for toluene).\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **Number of basis functions per Carbon (C):** 9\n*   **Number of basis functions per Hydrogen (H):** 2\n*   **Total basis functions for Toluene (C7H8):** (7 × 9) + (8 × 2) = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
