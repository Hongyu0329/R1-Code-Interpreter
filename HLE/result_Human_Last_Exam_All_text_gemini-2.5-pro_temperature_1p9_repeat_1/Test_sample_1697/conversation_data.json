    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material\n\nThe starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to a C(=O)N moiety.\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: The nitrogen atom of the amide is substituted with two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). This is a tertiary amide: -CON(Et)₂.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: At position 3 of the benzene ring (meta to the amide group), there is a dimethylamino group: -N(CH₃)₂.\n\nThe structure is a benzene ring with two substituents meta to each other: a -CON(Et)₂ group at C1 and a -N(CH₃)₂ group at C3.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step (Metalation)\n\nThe reagents are **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium)** and **TMEDA (tetramethylethylenediamine)** in THF.\n*   **sec-BuLi** is a very strong and sterically hindered base. Its primary function is to abstract a proton (deprotonation).\n*   **TMEDA** is a chelating agent for the lithium cation (Li⁺). It breaks down the aggregates of sec-BuLi and complexes with the lithium ion, significantly increasing the basicity of the reagent.\n*   The combination of an organolithium reagent like sec-BuLi with TMEDA is characteristic of a **Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In this reaction, a directing group on the aromatic ring coordinates to the lithium ion and directs the deprotonation to a nearby (ortho) position.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Site of Deprotonation\n\nWe need to identify the most acidic proton on the starting material, which will be the one removed by sec-BuLi. This is determined by the directing groups on the aromatic ring.\n*   **-CON(Et)₂ (amide group)**: This is one of the most powerful directing groups. The carbonyl oxygen has lone pairs that can chelate the lithium ion, directing the base to deprotonate the protons at the ortho positions (C2 and C6).\n*   **-N(CH₃)₂ (amino group)**: This is also a good directing group. The nitrogen lone pair can coordinate with the lithium ion, directing deprotonation to its ortho positions (C2 and C4).\n\nLet's evaluate the acidity of the aromatic protons:\n*   **Proton at C2**: This position is *ortho to both* the powerful -CON(Et)₂ group and the -N(CH₃)₂ group. Deprotonation at this site is synergistically activated by both groups. The resulting aryllithium intermediate is highly stabilized by the formation of a six-membered chelate ring involving the lithium ion, the amide's oxygen, and the amine's nitrogen. This makes the C2 proton by far the most acidic.\n*   **Proton at C4**: This position is ortho to the -N(CH₃)₂ group but para to the -CON(Et)₂ group. It is only directed by one group.\n*   **Proton at C6**: This position is ortho to the -CON(Et)₂ group but meta to the -N(CH₃)₂ group. It is only directed by one group.\n*   **Proton at C5**: This position is meta to both groups and is the least acidic.\n\n**Conclusion for Step 3**: The deprotonation occurs selectively at the C2 position, which is doubly activated. This forms a 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide intermediate.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Electrophilic Quench)\n\nThe reagent added is **methyl iodide (CH₃I)**.\n*   Methyl iodide is an electrophile. The methyl carbon is electrophilic due to the polar C-I bond.\n*   The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile. The negatively charged carbon at the C2 position attacks the electrophilic methyl group of CH₃I in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n*   This reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond between the C2 position of the benzene ring and the methyl group, with lithium iodide (LiI) as a byproduct.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Final Product\n\nThe starting material was N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. The reaction sequence results in the substitution of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group.\n\nThe final product structure has:\n*   The N,N-diethylbenzamide backbone.\n*   The dimethylamino group at C3.\n*   A newly introduced methyl group at C2.\n\nThe IUPAC name of this compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
