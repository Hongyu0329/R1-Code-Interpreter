    "This question asks for the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a specific Calabi-Yau link. Let's break down the problem into clear, manageable steps.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Calabi-Yau Link:** This is the intersection of a Calabi-Yau manifold (hypersurface) with a small sphere around the origin in the ambient space. It is a type of Sasaki-Einstein manifold.\n*   **Ambient Space:** The ambient space is a 5-dimensional complex space `C^5` with a specific `C*` action, leading to the weighted projective space `P(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`. The numbers `w = (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)` are the weights of the coordinates `(z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5)`.\n*   **Defining Polynomial:** The Calabi-Yau hypersurface is defined by the zero set of a weighted homogeneous polynomial `f(z_1, ..., z_5) = 0`. For `f` to be well-defined in the weighted projective space, all its monomials must have the same weighted degree `d`.\n*   **Calabi-Yau Condition:** For a hypersurface in a weighted projective space `P(w_1, ..., w_{n+1})` to be Calabi-Yau, its degree `d` must be equal to the sum of the weights: `d = Σ w_i`.\n*   **Crawley-Nordström Invariant:** This is a rational number, which is an integer for quasi-regular Sasaki manifolds like the links of weighted homogeneous polynomials, that characterizes the rational homotopy type of the manifold.\n\n**2. Verify the Parameters**\n\n*   **Weights:** `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n*   **Degree (d):** According to the Calabi-Yau condition, the degree `d` should be the sum of the weights.\n    `d = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`.\n*   **Check Polynomial Consistency:** Let's verify if all monomials in the given polynomial have this degree `d = 225`. The weighted degree of a monomial `z_1^{a_1} z_2^{a_2} z_3^{a_3} z_4^{a_4} z_5^{a_5}` is `a_1w_1 + a_2w_2 + a_3w_3 + a_4w_4 + a_5w_5`.\n    *   `z_1^8 z_3`: `8 * 22 + 1 * 49 = 176 + 49 = 225`. **(Correct)**\n    *   `z_1^4 z_2^3 z_3`: `4 * 22 + 3 * 29 + 1 * 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224`. **(Incorrect)**\n    *   `z_1 z_2^7`: `1 * 22 + 7 * 29 = 22 + 203 = 225`. **(Correct)**\n    *   `z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4 z_5`: `1 * 22 + 1 * 29 + 1 * 49 + 1 * 50 + 1 * 75 = 225`. **(Correct)**\n    *   `z_2 z_3^4`: `1 * 29 + 4 * 49 = 29 + 196 = 225`. **(Correct)**\n    *   `z_4^3 z_5`: `3 * 50 + 1 * 75 = 150 + 75 = 225`. **(Correct)**\n    *   `z_5^3`: `3 * 75 = 225`. **(Correct)**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** There is a typo in the provided polynomial, as one monomial has a different degree. However, since the problem specifies a \"Calabi-Yau Link\" and all other terms match the degree required by the Calabi-Yau condition (`d = Σw_i`), we will proceed with `d = 225`. The invariant only depends on the weights `w` and the degree `d`, not the specific coefficients of the polynomial.\n\n**3. State the Formula**\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant `inv(K)` for a Calabi-Yau link `K` (which is a quasi-regular Sasaki-Einstein manifold) is given by the formula:\n`inv(K) = d / I`\nwhere `I` is the index of the associated Reeb vector field. The index `I` can be calculated from the weights and the degree using the following formula:\n`I = lcm( d/gcd(w_1, d), d/gcd(w_2, d), ..., d/gcd(w_5, d) )`\nHere `lcm` is the least common multiple and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.\n\n**4. Perform the Calculation**\n\nWe have `d = 225` and `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n\n*   **Step 4.1: Calculate `gcd(w_i, d)` for each weight `w_i`**.\n    *   The prime factorization of the degree is `d = 225 = 3^2 * 5^2`.\n    *   `gcd(w_1, d) = gcd(22, 225) = gcd(2 * 11, 3^2 * 5^2) = 1`\n    *   `gcd(w_2, d) = gcd(29, 225) = 1` (since 29 is prime and not 3 or 5)\n    *   `gcd(w_3, d) = gcd(49, 225) = gcd(7^2, 3^2 * 5^2) = 1`\n    *   `gcd(w_4, d) = gcd(50, 225) = gcd(2 * 5^2, 3^2 * 5^2) = 5^2 = 25`\n    *   `gcd(w_5, d) = gcd(75, 225) = gcd(3 * 5^2, 3^2 * 5^2) = 3 * 5^2 = 75`\n\n*   **Step 4.2: Calculate the ratios `d/gcd(w_i, d)`**.\n    *   `d/gcd(w_1, d) = 225 / 1 = 225`\n    *   `d/gcd(w_2, d) = 225 / 1 = 225`\n    *   `d/gcd(w_3, d) = 225 / 1 = 225`\n    *   `d/gcd(w_4, d) = 225 / 25 = 9`\n    *   `d/gcd(w_5, d) = 225 / 75 = 3`\n\n*   **Step 4.3: Calculate the index `I`**.\n    *   `I = lcm(225, 225, 225, 9, 3)`\n    *   To find the `lcm` of this set, we only need to consider `lcm(225, 9, 3)`.\n    *   Since `225` is divisible by `9` (225 = 25 * 9) and by `3` (225 = 75 * 3), `225` is the least common multiple.\n    *   Therefore, `I = 225`.\n\n*   **Step 4.4: Calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant**.\n    *   `inv(K) = d / I = 225 / 225 = 1`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final calculated value for the Crawley-Nordström invariant is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
