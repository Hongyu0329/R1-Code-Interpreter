    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and their locations.**\nThere are two Luxor Obelisks, originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   One obelisk remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The second obelisk was moved to France in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\nTherefore, a film could depict a Luxor Obelisk by showing scenes in either Luxor, Egypt, or Paris, France.\n\n**Step 2: Create a chronological list of early Best Picture winners and analyze their settings.**\nWe must check the winners in order, starting from the first Academy Awards, to find the *first* film that meets the criteria.\n\n*   **1st (1927/1928): *Wings*** - This World War I drama features scenes in France, including Paris. However, its depiction of Paris focuses on wartime action, crowds celebrating the armistice, and cafe scenes, without a clear, deliberate shot of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk.\n*   **2nd (1928/1929): *The Broadway Melody*** - Set in New York City.\n*   **3rd (1929/1930): *All Quiet on the Western Front*** - Set on the German front during WWI.\n*   **4th (1930/1931): *Cimarron*** - A Western set in Oklahoma.\n*   **5th (1931/1932): *Grand Hotel*** - Set in Berlin, Germany.\n*   **6th (1932/1933): *Cavalcade*** - Set in London, England.\n*   **7th (1934): *It Happened One Night*** - A road movie set across the northeastern United States.\n*   **8th (1935): *Mutiny on the Bounty*** - Set primarily at sea and on Pacific islands.\n*   **9th (1936): *The Great Ziegfeld*** - A biopic set mainly in New York City.\n*   **10th (1937): *The Life of Emile Zola*** - This film is a biographical drama about the famous French writer Ã‰mile Zola. A significant portion of the film is set in Paris during the late 19th century, covering the events of the Dreyfus Affair. The film uses establishing shots of prominent Parisian landmarks to set the scene. One of these scenes clearly depicts the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk visible in the square.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the findings.**\nBy reviewing the Best Picture winners chronologically, we can determine that none of the winners from the 1st to the 9th Academy Awards feature a definitive on-screen depiction of a Luxor Obelisk in either Paris or Luxor. The 10th winner, *The Life of Emile Zola*, is set in Paris and includes a clear shot of the Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde. Therefore, it is the first Best Picture winner to do so. Any subsequent winners that might also feature the obelisk, such as *An American in Paris* (1951) or *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), came much later.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
