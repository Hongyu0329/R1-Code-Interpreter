    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the System and the Role of Large Deviation Theory**\n\n*   **System**: We are considering a gas of light quanta (photons). Photons are bosons, so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. A key feature of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium (like in a blackbody cavity) is that the number of photons is not conserved. This is formally handled by setting the chemical potential to zero ($\\mu = 0$).\n*   **Equilibrium**: The equilibrium state of a macroscopic system is the most probable state, i.e., the macrostate that corresponds to the largest number of possible microstates.\n*   **Large Deviation Theory Connection**:\n    *   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem provides a rigorous foundation for Boltzmann's principle, $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. It states that the probability of observing an empirical distribution (like the distribution of particles over energy levels) deviating from the most probable one is exponentially small. Therefore, finding the equilibrium state is equivalent to finding the distribution that maximizes the entropy $\\Omega$ (or its logarithm, $S$).\n    *   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem deals with the probability of the sample mean of random variables deviating from its expected value. In statistical mechanics, this connects the probability of observing a certain average energy to a rate function related to the free energy. The equilibrium mean energy is the value that minimizes this rate function, and it can be derived from the partition function, which acts as a moment-generating function.\n\n**2. Finding the Equilibrium Distribution using Maximum Entropy (Sanov's Principle)**\n\nOur first step is to find the distribution of particles over energy levels that maximizes the entropy, subject to the physical constraints.\n\n*   **Entropy of a Bose Gas**: The number of ways to arrange $n_j$ identical bosons into $g_j$ degenerate quantum states at energy level $\\epsilon_j$ is given by $\\Omega_j = \\binom{n_j + g_j - 1}{n_j}$. The total number of microstates for a given set of occupation numbers $\\{n_j\\}$ is $\\Omega = \\prod_j \\Omega_j$. The Boltzmann entropy is $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. Using Stirling's approximation for large $n_j$ and $g_j$, the entropy is:\n    $S(\\{n_j\\}) = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (n_j+g_j)\\ln(n_j+g_j) - n_j\\ln n_j - g_j\\ln g_j \\right]$\n\n*   **Constraints**:\n    1.  **Constant Mean Energy**: The total energy of the system is $U = \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j$. We treat this as a fixed constraint.\n    2.  **No Particle Conservation**: For photons, the total number of particles $N = \\sum_j n_j$ is not conserved ($\\mu=0$). Thus, there is no corresponding constraint in the maximization procedure.\n\n*   **Maximization with Lagrange Multipliers**: We maximize the function $\\mathcal{L} = S/k_B - \\beta( \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j - U)$, where $\\beta$ is a Lagrange multiplier associated with the energy constraint.\n    $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_j} [ (n_j+g_j)\\ln(n_j+g_j) - n_j\\ln n_j - g_j\\ln g_j - \\beta n_j \\epsilon_j ] = 0$\n    Solving this yields:\n    $\\ln(n_j+g_j) - \\ln n_j - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n    $\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_j+g_j}{n_j}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$\n    $1 + \\frac{g_j}{n_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$\n    $\\frac{g_j}{n_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1$\n\n*   **Equilibrium Occupation Number**: The most probable, or equilibrium, number of particles at energy level $\\epsilon_j$ is:\n    $\\langle n_j \\rangle = \\frac{g_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n    The Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. This is the celebrated Planck distribution law.\n\n**3. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (Cramer-Chernoff Principle)**\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff principle justifies using the partition function formalism to find the mean energy. The grand canonical partition function $\\mathcal{Z}$ for a Bose gas is:\n$\\mathcal{Z} = \\prod_j \\left( \\sum_{n_j=0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta (n_j \\epsilon_j - \\mu n_j)} \\right)^{g_j} = \\prod_j \\left( \\frac{1}{1-e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_j-\\mu)}} \\right)^{g_j}$\n\nFor photons, we set the chemical potential $\\mu=0$:\n$\\mathcal{Z} = \\prod_j \\left( \\frac{1}{1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}} \\right)^{g_j}$\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy $U$ is the expectation value $\\langle E \\rangle$, which is calculated from the partition function:\n$U = \\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\mathcal{Z}}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\sum_j g_j \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_j}}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\sum_j g_j \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_j})$\n$U = \\sum_j g_j \\left( \\frac{-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_j} \\cdot (-\\epsilon_j)}{1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_j}} \\right) = \\sum_j g_j \\frac{\\epsilon_j e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_j}}{1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_j}}$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $e^{\\beta\\epsilon_j}$ gives the final expression for the **equilibrium mean energy**:\n$U = \\sum_j \\frac{g_j \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\nThis matches the result obtained by summing the energy per particle $\\epsilon_j$ over the equilibrium distribution $\\langle n_j \\rangle$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nThe equilibrium entropy is the value of the entropy function when evaluated at the equilibrium occupation numbers $\\langle n_j \\rangle$. We can calculate it using the thermodynamic relation involving the partition function: $S = k_B (\\beta U + \\ln \\mathcal{Z})$.\n\n$S = k_B \\left( \\beta \\sum_j \\frac{g_j \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1} + \\ln \\left[ \\prod_j (1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_j})^{-g_j} \\right] \\right)$\n$S = k_B \\left( \\sum_j \\frac{g_j \\beta \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1} - \\sum_j g_j \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_j}) \\right)$\n\nThis gives the final expression for the **equilibrium entropy**:\n$S = k_B \\sum_j g_j \\left[ \\frac{\\beta \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1} - \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) \\right]$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values are the expressions for the mean energy and entropy as a function of temperature ($T = 1/(k_B\\beta)$) and the system's energy level structure ($\\{\\epsilon_j, g_j\\}$).\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n$U = \\sum_j \\frac{g_j \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\epsilon_j/k_B T} - 1}$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n$S = k_B \\sum_j g_j \\left[ \\frac{\\epsilon_j/k_B T}{e^{\\epsilon_j/k_B T} - 1} - \\ln(1 - e^{-\\epsilon_j/k_B T}) \\right]$\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy:\n$U = \\sum_j \\frac{g_j \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\epsilon_j/k_B T} - 1}$\n\nEquilibrium Entropy:\n$S = k_B \\sum_j g_j \\left[ \\frac{\\epsilon_j/k_B T}{e^{\\epsilon_j/k_B T} - 1} - \\ln(1 - e^{-\\epsilon_j/k_B T}) \\right]$\n\nwhere $T$ is the equilibrium temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and the system has $g_j$ quantum states at each energy level $\\epsilon_j$.\n>>>"
