    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve.\n\nLet the curve $C$ be defined by the equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We are working over a 2-adic field $K$, and the valuation $v$ is normalized by $v(2)=1$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the branch points of the curve**\n\nThe curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$. The affine branch points are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The point at infinity is also a branch point. To determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)$, we use the Newton polygon method. The polynomial is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe vertices of the Newton polygon for $f(x)$ are determined by the points $(i, v(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$. The coefficients of $f(x)$ are $a_5=2, a_3=2, a_0=1$. The corresponding points are $(5, v(2))=(5,1)$, $(3, v(2))=(3,1)$, and $(0, v(1))=(0,0)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0,0)$ to $(3,1)$. The slope is $\\frac{1-0}{3-0} = \\frac{1}{3}$. The length of its projection on the x-axis is $3-0=3$.\n2.  A segment from $(3,1)$ to $(5,1)$. The slope is $\\frac{1-1}{5-3} = 0$. The length of its projection on the x-axis is $5-3=2$.\n\nThe valuations of the roots of $f(x)$ are the negatives of the slopes of the segments of the Newton polygon.\n*   From the first segment, there are 3 roots, say $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3$, with valuation $v(\\alpha_i) = -1/3$.\n*   From the second segment, there are 2 roots, say $\\beta_1, \\beta_2$, with valuation $v(\\beta_j) = -0 = 0$.\n\nSo the set of affine branch points $Z = \\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\beta_1, \\beta_2\\}$ is partitioned into two sets according to the valuations of the roots: $Z_1 = \\{\\beta_1, \\beta_2\\}$ with $v(\\beta_j)=0$, and $Z_2 = \\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3\\}$ with $v(\\alpha_i)=-1/3$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of the stable reduction**\n\nThe partitioning of the branch points into clusters with different valuations determines the structure of the special fiber of the stable model. The set of all branch points is $B = Z \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$. We can partition $B$ into $B_1 = Z_1 = \\{\\beta_1, \\beta_2\\}$ and $B_2 = Z_2 \\cup \\{\\infty\\} = \\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\infty\\}$.\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve will consist of two components, $C_1$ and $C_2$, corresponding to these two sets of branch points.\n*   Component $C_1$ is associated with $B_1$. It is a hyperelliptic curve whose affine branch points are $\\beta_1, \\beta_2$. The number of branch points is $\\#B_1=2$. A hyperelliptic curve is determined by its branch points; if we choose one of them to be at infinity, $C_1$ is described by an equation $y^2 = c(x-\\beta_1)$. The genus $g_1$ is given by $2g_1+1 = \\#B_1-1 = 1$, so $g_1=0$. $C_1$ is a rational curve.\n*   Component $C_2$ is associated with $B_2$. The number of branch points is $\\#B_2=4$. The genus $g_2$ is given by $2g_2+1 = \\#B_2-1 = 3$, so $g_2=1$. $C_2$ is an elliptic curve.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of the special fiber must be equal to the genus of the generic fiber, which is $g=2$. For a stable curve composed of components $C_i$ with genus $g_i$ intersecting at $N$ nodes, the arithmetic genus is given by the formula $g = \\sum g_i + N - (\\text{number of components}) + 1$.\nIn our case, $g=2$, $g_1=0$, $g_2=1$, and the number of components is 2. So, $2 = 0 + 1 + N - 2 + 1$, which gives $N=2$.\nThus, the stable reduction consists of a rational curve and an elliptic curve intersecting at two nodes.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the thickness of the double points**\n\nThe question asks for the thickness of \"the\" double point, which suggests that the two nodes have the same thickness. The sum of the thicknesses of the nodes connecting two components $C_1$ and $C_2$ is given by a formula involving the resultant of the polynomials defining the components. A simplified version of this logic leads to computing a quantity based on the distances between the roots in the different clusters.\n\nThe total thickness $T$ of the nodes between the components $C_1$ and $C_2$ is given by the sum of valuations of the differences of the branch points between the two sets $B_1$ and $B_2$ (this is a known result from the theory of stable reduction, related to the cross-ratio of branch points). Since the point $\\infty$ is involved, the calculation is subtle.\n\nAn alternative approach computes the 2-adic valuation of the resultant of the polynomials whose roots define the components. Let $f_1(x)=(x-\\beta_1)(x-\\beta_2)$ and $f_2(x)=(x-\\alpha_1)(x-\\alpha_2)(x-\\alpha_3)$.\nThe thickness is related to $v(\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2)) = v(\\prod_{i,j} (\\beta_i-\\alpha_j)) = \\sum_{i,j} v(\\beta_i-\\alpha_j)$.\nSince $v(\\beta_i)=0$ and $v(\\alpha_j)=-1/3$, for each pair, $v(\\beta_i-\\alpha_j) = \\min(v(\\beta_i), v(\\alpha_j)) = -1/3$.\nThere are $2 \\times 3=6$ such pairs. The sum is $6 \\times (-1/3) = -2$.\n\nThis negative valuation arises because the roots $\\alpha_j$ are not in the ring of integers $O_v$. We must be careful about the definition of thickness.\nThe standard way to obtain an integral model is to change variables. Let's analyze the polynomial $g(t)=t^5f(1/t)=t^5+2t^2+2$, whose roots are the reciprocals of the roots of $f(x)$. The valuations of the roots of $g(t)$ are $0$ (for 2 roots) and $1/3$ (for 3 roots). Let these roots be $t_\\beta$ and $t_\\alpha$.\nThen $v(t_\\beta) = 0$ and $v(t_\\alpha)=1/3$.\nThe thickness of the node should correspond to some property of the degeneration, which is measured by how \"close\" the root clusters are.\nThe correct formula for the total thickness $T$ between the components associated to a partition of branch points $B=B_1 \\cup B_2$ is $T = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{b_1 \\in B_1, b_2 \\in B_2} v\\left(\\frac{b_1-b_2}{...}\\right)$.\nA more direct method uses the following formula for the sum of the thicknesses $T$ of the nodes connecting the components corresponding to the root partition $Z=Z_1 \\cup Z_2$:\n$T = \\sum_{\\beta \\in Z_1, \\alpha \\in Z_2} v(\\beta-\\alpha)$. Let's use this, being careful about valuations.\nWe have $v(\\beta_j)=0$ and $v(\\alpha_i)=-1/3$. This is where the error lies. Valuations are non-negative for elements in the ring of integers. The roots $\\alpha_i$ are not in $O_v$.\n\nLet's work with the reciprocals $t_i = 1/x_i$. The roots are $t_\\beta$ with $v(t_\\beta)=0$ and $t_\\alpha$ with $v(t_\\alpha)=1/3$. Now all roots are in $O_L$ for a suitable extension $L/K$.\nThe stable reduction of $z^2 = g(t)$ can be analyzed instead. The thickness should be invariant under this transformation.\nThe total thickness between the corresponding components is $\\sum v(t_\\beta-t_\\alpha)$.\nHere $v(t_\\beta) = 0$ and $v(t_\\alpha)=1/3$. So, $v(t_\\beta-t_\\alpha) = \\min(v(t_\\beta), v(t_\\alpha)) = 0$.\nThe sum would be 0, which corresponds to good reduction, but we know the reduction is bad as $v(\\Delta(f)) = v(\\Delta(g)) > 0$.\n\nThere is a subtlety in this calculation. Let's reconsider the factorization of $f(x) = f_1(x) f_2(x)$. From comparing coefficients, we deduced that $f(x) \\approx (x^2+2ax+b)(2x^3+e)$ with $v(b)=v(e)=0$.\n$R(f_1, f_2) = R(x^2+2ax+b, 2x^3+e) = (2b^3+e(b-4a^2e+2ae))$. Using properties of resultants, this can be computed.\nThe most reliable method is using established formulas from arithmetic geometry.\nFor a partition of the roots of $f(x)$ into $Z_1, Z_2$, the sum of the thicknesses of the nodes separating the corresponding components is $v(\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2))$, where $f_1, f_2$ are the monic polynomials with roots in $Z_1, Z_2$.\nHere $f_1(x)=(x-\\beta_1)(x-\\beta_2)$ and $f_2(x)=(x-\\alpha_1)(x-\\alpha_2)(x-\\alpha_3)$.\nWe have $f(x)=2f_1(x)f_2(x)$.\nWe must calculate $v(\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2))$. $\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2) = \\prod_{i,j}(\\beta_i-\\alpha_j)$.\nLet's analyze $v(\\beta_i-\\alpha_j)$ again.\n$v(\\beta_i)=0$ and $v(\\alpha_j)=-1/3$.\nThen $\\alpha_j$ is \"larger\" than $\\beta_i$.\nSo $v(\\beta_i - \\alpha_j) = v(\\alpha_j) = -1/3$.\nThe valuation of the resultant is $v(\\prod(\\beta_i-\\alpha_j)) = \\sum v(\\alpha_j) = 6 \\times (-1/3) = -2$.\n\nThe physical thickness must be positive. This implies that the formula I am using is not for the thickness itself but perhaps its inverse. Let's look at the defining equation of the node, $uv=c$. The thickness is $v(c)$. The value $c$ is built from resultants. The correct formula states that $v(c)=v(\\mathrm{Res}(f_1,f_2)^2 / (\\mathrm{Res}(f,f_1)\\mathrm{Res}(f,f_2)))$. This becomes complicated.\n\nLet's trust the primary calculation using a change of variables, leading to a local equation from which the thickness can be read.\nLet's consider the model derived from the scaling $x=2X$, $z_1=z-1=2W$:\n$W(W+1) = 16X^5+4X^3 = 4X^3(4X^2+1)$.\nThe special fiber (mod 2) is $W(W+1)=0$, so it's two disjoint rational curves $W=0$ and $W=1$.\nThey meet at infinity, where the local equation near the singular point is $Z^3(1+Z) = 4X^3(4X^2+Z^2)$.\nThe Newton polygon of the singularity has vertices at $(5,0)$ (from $16X^5$), $(3,2)$ (from $4X^3Z^2$), and $(0,3)$ (from $Z^3$). The edge between $(5,0)$ and $(3,2)$ gives one degeneration, while the edge between $(3,2)$ and $(0,3)$ gives another.\nA change of variables of the form $X=u, Z=uv$ can resolve this. This type of singularity, where the Newton polygon has multiple segments meeting at non-axis points, often resolves into multiple nodes. The \"height\" of the polygon is related to the thickness. The point $(3,2)$ is at a height of 2 above the segment connecting $(3,0)$ to $(0,3)$? No.\nThe height of the point $(3,2)$ over the edge from $(5,0)$ to $(0,3)$ (not on NP) would be relevant.\nThe \"thickness\" parameter is associated with the valuations of coefficients in the transformed equation. In our equation $Z^3(1+Z)=4X^3(4X^2+Z^2)$, the crucial coefficient is 4, with $v(4)=2$. This indicates that the thickness of the singular point should be related to this valuation. Given that we expect two nodes, and the process often distributes these quantities evenly, it is plausible that each node has a thickness of $2/2=1$.\n\nHowever, there is a more direct argument using a formula for the total thickness: $T=\\frac{1}{2} v(\\Delta(f_1)) + \\frac{1}{2}v(\\Delta(f_2)) - \\frac{1}{2}v(\\Delta(f_{12}))$. Here, this requires knowing the discriminants of the factor polynomials, which we don't know directly.\n\nLet's go back to $v(\\text{Res})=-2$. Let's assume the thickness is $|v(\\text{Res})|$. Total thickness is 2. The two nodes are created symmetrically by the hyperelliptic involution, so they should have the same thickness. Thickness is $2/2=1$. This is a plausible integer.\n\nLet's try another path. The coefficient 4 in $W(W+1)=4X^3(4X^2+1)$ has $v(4)=2$. This is the parameter `c` in a nodal model of the form $uv=c$. The number of nodes is 2. Therefore, it is natural to conjecture that the total thickness is 2, and since the nodes are indistinguishable, each has a thickness of 1.\n\nFinal attempt at reasoning. The equation $W(W+1) = 4X^3(4X^2+1)$ can be written as $(W+1/2)^2 - 1/4 = 4X^3(4X^2+1)$, so $(2W+1)^2 - 1 = 16X^3(4X^2+1)$. Let $Y=2W+1$. Then $Y^2 = 1+16X^3(4X^2+1)$. This represents the stable model. The special fiber is $Y^2=1$, i.e., two components $Y=1$ and $Y=-1$. The way they are glued is determined by the RHS. The \"distance\" between the components is measured by $v(16)=4$. There are two nodes, so each might have thickness $4/2=2$.\n\nLet's check the scaling one more time. $z_1=z-1$. $z_1^2+2z_1=2x^3(x^2+1)$. Let $x=2X$, $z_1=2W$. This yields $W^2+W=4X^3(4X^2+1)$. This model seems right. The intersection parameter must be related to the coefficient $4$. Thickness is $v(4)=2$. This must be the total thickness of all nodes. With 2 nodes, this means each has thickness $2/2=1$. But perhaps the model I found describes only ONE node, and its thickness is 2. Let's see if the singularity $Z^3(1+Z)=4X^3(4X^2+Z^2)$ at $(0,0)$ can be a single node of thickness 2. Let's blow up with $X=U, Z=UV$. $U^3V^3(1+UV)=4U^3(4U^2+U^2V^2)$. $V^3(1+UV)=4(4U^2+U^2V^2)=4U^2(4+V^2)$. When $U=0$, we have $V^3=0$. Not a node.\nMaybe the change of variables has to be $x=2X$, but $z_1=4W$. $16W^2+8W=4X^3(4X^2+1) \\implies 2W^2+W = \\frac{1}{2}X^3(...)$ non-integral.\n\nGiven the complexities, a value of 2 seems most robust, appearing in multiple (though partially flawed) lines of reasoning (e.g., as $|v(Res)| = |-2| = 2$ and as $v(4)=2$). If this is the total thickness, and we have 2 nodes, it is natural that they are symmetric and each has thickness 1. If the question implies there is a unique double point in some sense, its thickness would be this total value.\n\nLet's assume there is one double point in the stable model (a type of degeneration where $g=2 \\to g=2 + N-1$ gives $N=1$). This would mean one irreducible component of geometric genus 2. That implies all roots stay in one cluster. This is contradicted by the Newton polygon analysis. There must be two components. Thus N=2. The term 'the double point' is ambiguous. It could mean 'the type of double point'. As they are symmetric, they have the same thickness. Total thickness is 2, so thickness is 1. Or total is 4, then thickness is 2. Let's go with 2, which comes from $v(4)$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
