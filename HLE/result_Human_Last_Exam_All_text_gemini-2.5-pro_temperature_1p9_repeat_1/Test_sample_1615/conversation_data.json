    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of colours needed.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Terminology**\nThe question asks for the maximum number of colours required for a proper vertex colouring of a graph $G$. This quantity is the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, denoted $\\chi(G)$, over all graphs that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nA **proper vertex colouring** assigns a colour to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same colour.\nThe **chromatic number**, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colours needed for a proper colouring of $G$.\nThe given conditions for the graph $G$ are:\n1.  It has $n = 12345$ vertices.\n2.  It is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n3.  It has some maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$.\n\nWe need to find the value of $\\max \\{ \\chi(G) \\mid |V(G)|=12345 \\text{ and } G \\neq K_{12345} \\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Establish a General Upper Bound**\nFor any simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, a basic and fundamental result in graph theory is that its chromatic number is at most the number of its vertices:\n$\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n\nFurthermore, the equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph $G$ is a **complete graph** ($K_n$), where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Problem's Specific Constraint**\nThe problem explicitly states that the graph $G$ is **not a complete graph**.\n*   $n = 12345$.\n*   $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n\nBecause $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number cannot be $n$. It must be strictly less than $n$.\n$\\chi(G) < n$\nSince the chromatic number must be an integer, this implies:\n$\\chi(G) \\le n - 1$.\n\nFor our specific case, this means $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\nThis establishes an upper bound. The maximum number of colours needed is at most 12344.\n\n**Step 4: Verify if This Upper Bound is Achievable**\nTo confirm that 12344 is the maximum possible value, we must show that there exists at least one graph $G$ that satisfies the conditions ($n=12345$, $G \\neq K_{12345}$) and has a chromatic number of exactly 12344.\n\nLet's construct such a graph. Consider the graph $G_0$ formed by taking the complete graph on $12344$ vertices, $K_{12344}$, and adding one extra vertex, $v$, which is not connected to any of the other vertices (an isolated vertex).\n\n*   **Number of vertices:** The graph $G_0$ has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n*   **Is it a complete graph?** No. For $G_0$ to be a complete graph, every vertex must be connected to every other vertex. The isolated vertex $v$ is not connected to any other vertex. Thus, $G_0 \\neq K_{12345}$.\n*   **What is its chromatic number, $\\chi(G_0)$?** The graph consists of two disconnected components: the clique $K_{12344}$ and the single vertex $v$. To colour $G_0$, we need to colour each component. The $K_{12344}$ component requires 12344 distinct colours. The isolated vertex $v$ can be coloured with any of those 12344 colours (or a new one). Since we want the minimum number of colours for a proper colouring, $\\chi(G_0)$ is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n    $\\chi(G_0) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nWe have successfully constructed a graph $G_0$ that satisfies the conditions of the problem and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nWe have shown two things:\n1.  For any graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number must be less than 12345, so $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n2.  There exists at least one such graph that requires exactly 12344 colours.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colours that we could possibly need is 12344.\n\n***\n### Careful Points\n*   **Interpreting the Question:** The key is to understand \"maximum number of colours that we need\" as the maximum possible chromatic number ($\\chi(G)$) over the class of all graphs that fit the description.\n*   **The Crucial Constraint:** The condition \"other than the complete graph\" is the most important piece of information. Without it, the answer would be 12345.\n*   **Proving the Maximum:** It is not enough to establish an upper bound (like 12344). You must also show that this bound can be reached by providing a valid example. The graph $K_{12344} \\cup K_1$ is a simple and clear example. Another common example is $K_{12345} - e$ (the complete graph with one edge removed), which is connected and also has a chromatic number of 12344.\n*   **Role of $\\Delta(G)$:** The mention of maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ might seem like a hint to use Brooks' Theorem ($\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$ for most connected graphs). While the result is consistent with the theorem, a more direct line of reasoning based on the definition of a complete graph and its relation to the chromatic number is simpler and more robust here.\n\n***\nThe final answer is $12345 - 1$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
