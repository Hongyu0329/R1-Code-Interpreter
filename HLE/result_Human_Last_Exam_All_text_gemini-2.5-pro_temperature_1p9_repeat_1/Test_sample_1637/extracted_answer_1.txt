Yes, changing the amide group (and its associated side-chain) to a PEG group is a very effective and common strategy that would likely solve the precipitation problem. The original probe's poor aqueous solubility is caused by the large, hydrophobic thioxanthenone core and the long, non-polar chlorohexyl chain. Replacing the existing linker, which contains the hydrophobic chain and the potentially aggregating amide bond, with a hydrophilic and flexible PEG chain would significantly increase the molecule's overall polarity and favorable interactions with the aqueous cell culture medium, thus preventing it from precipitating out of solution.
