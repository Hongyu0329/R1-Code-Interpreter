    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet & Role:** Kitri in *Don Quixote*\n*   **Specific Choreography:** Act I variation\n*   **Specific Step to Count:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Performance and Choreography**\nThe question refers to a specific performance era. Natalia Osipova's interpretation of Kitri with the Bolshoi Ballet during the late 2000s is well-documented, most famously in the 2011 HD broadcast recording, which features choreography consistent with what she would have performed in 2008. The Act I variation is Kitri's iconic solo with the fan in the marketplace scene.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Act I Variation**\nWe must watch a performance of Osipova in this role from that period and isolate the specific step requested. The Act I variation contains several distinct sections of turning and jumping. We are looking for a specific sequence.\n*   **Piqué Turns:** The variation includes a diagonal of piqué turns, but these are not pirouettes from the fifth position.\n*   **Fouetté Turns:** The finale of the variation often includes a circle of fouetté-style turns or traveling turns, which also do not match the description.\n*   **The Pirouette Sequence:** There is a distinct section in the variation where Kitri performs a series of repeating steps. The step consists of a preparation (plié) in the fifth position, a rise (relevé) to an attitude balance on pointe, a brief hold of the balance, and then the execution of a pirouette.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Specific Turns**\nLet's analyze the characteristics of this pirouette sequence to ensure it matches the question's criteria.\n*   **Starting Position:** The dancer begins each combination from a clear fifth position plié.\n*   **Turn Direction:** The turn is executed \"en dehors,\" meaning outwards, away from the supporting leg.\n*   **Number of Rotations:** For each turn in this specific sequence, she completes exactly one rotation, making it a \"single-turn\".\n*   **Execution:** The combination is performed consecutively. The dancer executes the balance and single turn, closes in fifth position, and immediately begins the preparation for the next one.\n\nBy carefully watching Osipova's performance of this variation, we can count the number of times this specific combination is repeated. In the standard Bolshoi choreography she performs, this sequence is executed a total of **eight** times before she moves on to the next phrase of the variation.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   It is crucial to differentiate this specific sequence from other turning steps in the same variation. The question's detail (\"single-turn,\" \"en dehors,\" \"from the fifth position\") is key to isolating the correct steps.\n*   The number of repetitions for a set choreographic piece like this is generally standardized within a specific production, so performances from 2008 and 2011 would feature the same count for this sequence.\n*   One must watch the performance carefully, as the speed and brilliance of the execution can make it difficult to count accurately without focusing on the specific combination. The sequence is: plié in fifth, relevé attitude, hold, single pirouette, close in fifth. This entire combination is one unit, and it is repeated 8 times.\n\n<<<8>>>"
