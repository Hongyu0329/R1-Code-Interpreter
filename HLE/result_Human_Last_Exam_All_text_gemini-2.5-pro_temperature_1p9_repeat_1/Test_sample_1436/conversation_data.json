    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Topology of the Feynman Diagram\n\nThe question describes a Feynman diagram with the following properties:\n*   **Two vertices:** Let's label them V1 and V2.\n*   **Four field contractions:** A field contraction corresponds to an internal line or propagator. So, there are four propagators in the diagram.\n\nTo determine the structure, we need to know the type of interaction vertex. The problem is general, but the combination of two vertices and four propagators strongly implies a theory with a four-point interaction vertex, such as the $\\lambda\\phi^4$ theory, where the interaction term is $\\mathcal{L}_{int} \\propto \\phi^4$. Let's proceed with this standard and well-motivated assumption.\n\n*   In a $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex has four field lines attached to it.\n*   With two vertices (V1 and V2), we have a total of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ field \"stubs\" to be connected.\n*   The problem states there are four propagators. Each propagator connects two stubs. Thus, the four propagators account for all $4 \\times 2 = 8$ stubs.\n*   Since all stubs are used for internal propagators, there are no external lines. The diagram is a vacuum bubble diagram.\n*   The only possible way to connect two vertices using four propagators is for all four propagators to run from V1 to V2.\n\nThis uniquely describes the \"figure-eight\" or \"spectacles\" diagram, where two vertices are connected by four parallel lines.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Symmetry Factor (S)\n\nThe symmetry factor, S, is a combinatorial number that arises in the perturbative expansion of Green's functions. It corrects for the overcounting of topologically identical diagrams that can be formed during Wick contractions. S is equal to the order of the automorphism group of the diagram, which means it is the number of permutations of its internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram's structure unchanged.\n\nWe can calculate S by considering the different types of symmetries in the diagram. The total symmetry factor is the product of the number of permutations for each symmetry.\n\n### Step 3: Identify and Quantify the Symmetries of the Diagram\n\nWe look for two main types of symmetries in this diagram: permutation of vertices and permutation of propagators.\n\n**1. Permutation of Vertices:**\n*   The diagram consists of two vertices, V1 and V2.\n*   These vertices are of the same type (both are $\\phi^4$ interaction vertices).\n*   They are connected to each other in an identical fashion (each is an endpoint for the same four propagators).\n*   Therefore, the two vertices are indistinguishable. We can swap their labels ($V1 \\leftrightarrow V2$) and the diagram remains topologically identical.\n*   The number of ways to permute these two identical vertices is $2! = 2$.\n*   **Symmetry contribution from vertices = 2.**\n\n**2. Permutation of Propagators (Internal Lines):**\n*   The diagram has four propagators connecting vertex V1 to vertex V2.\n*   In a simple scalar theory, these four propagators are identical.\n*   We can exchange any of these four lines with any other, and the diagram remains unchanged. For example, swapping the \"top\" line with the \"bottom\" line results in the same diagram.\n*   The number of ways to permute these four identical propagators is $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n*   **Symmetry contribution from propagators = 24.**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor\n\nThe total symmetry factor S is the product of the individual symmetry contributions.\n\n*   S = (Number of vertex permutations) Ã— (Number of propagator permutations)\n*   S = $2 \\times 24$\n*   S = 48\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThe Feynman diagram described, having two vertices and four field contractions (in a typical four-point interaction theory), corresponds to a figure-eight vacuum bubble. Its symmetry factor arises from the ability to swap the two identical vertices (a factor of 2) and to permute the four identical propagators connecting them (a factor of 4!). The total symmetry factor is the product of these contributions.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation: S = $2! \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
