    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of `log_2(n)`.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Building Blocks (SKI Combinators and Church Numerals)\n\nFirst, we need to understand the definitions of the SKI combinators and Church numerals.\n\n**SKI Combinators:**\n*   `S x y z = x z (y z)` (Substitution)\n*   `K x y = x` (Kestrel or Constant)\n*   `I x = x` (Identity)\nFunction application is left-associative, meaning `f x y` is parsed as `(f x) y`.\n\n**Church Numerals:**\nA Church numeral `n` is a higher-order function that applies a given function `f` to an argument `x`, `n` times. `n = λf.λx. f^n(x)`. In SKI logic, we have the following important representations and operations:\n*   **Numeral `2`:** The expression `S(I)(I)` reduces to the Church numeral `2`.\n    *   `S I I f = I f (I f) = f f`.\n    *   So, `(S I I) f x = (f f) x = f(f(x)) = f^2(x)`. This corresponds to `2`.\n*   **Successor Function (`SUCC`):** The combinator `S(S(K S)(K))` is the `B` (composition) combinator. The successor function, which takes `n` to `n+1`, is `SUCC = S(B) = S(S(S(K S)(K)))`.\n    *   `(SUCC n) f x = f((n f) x) = f(f^n x) = f^(n+1) x`.\n*   **Exponentiation:** The application of one Church numeral `m` to another `n`, written as `m n`, results in the Church numeral for `n^m`.\n    *   `m n = (λf.λx. f^m x) n = λx. n^m x`. When this resulting function is applied to a function `g`, it yields `n^m g`, which is `g` composed with itself `n^m` times. This is the numeral `n^m`.\n\n### Step 2: Parse the Expression\n\nThe expression is `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`.\nFollowing standard left-associativity for function application, we parse `A(B)(C)` as `((A)(B))(C)`.\nLet's break down the expression `E` into this form:\n*   `A = S(I)`\n*   `B = S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))))`\n*   `C = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\nSo, the expression is evaluated as `E = ((S I) B) C`.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate C\n\nLet's evaluate the term `C` first.\n`C = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\nWe identify the parts:\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the `SUCC` function.\n*   `S(I)(I)` is the Church numeral `2`.\nSo, `C = SUCC(2)`, which evaluates to the Church numeral `3`.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate ((S I) B) C\n\nNow we substitute `C=3` back into the expression for `E`:\n`E = ((S I) B) 3`\nLet's apply the rule for `S`: `S x y z = x z (y z)`.\nHere, `x=I`, `y=B`, `z=3`.\n`E = S I B 3 = I 3 (B 3) = 3 (B 3)`\nSo, `n` is the result of applying the Church numeral `3` to the result of `B 3`. This means `n = (result of B 3)^3`.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate B\n\nNow we need to evaluate `B`.\n`B = S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))))`\nLet's analyze the inner part: `K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))`.\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))` is `SUCC`.\n*   `I` can represent the Church numeral `1`. (`I f x = f x`).\n*   So, `SUCC(I)` is `SUCC(1)`, which is the Church numeral `2`.\n*   The inner part becomes `K(2)`.\n\nNow, let's substitute this back into `B`.\n`B = S(I) (S(I) (K(2)))`.\nLet's define `Ψ = S(I)`. So `B = Ψ(Ψ(K(2)))`.\n`Ψ` is a function defined as `Ψ x y = S I x y = I y (x y) = y(x y)`.\nLet's evaluate `B` as a function by seeing what it does when applied to an argument, say `f`.\n*   First, `Ψ(K(2)) = λy. y((K 2) y) = λy. y(2)`.\n*   Next, `B = Ψ(λy. y(2)) = λf. f((λy. y(2)) f) = λf. f(f(2))`.\nSo, `B` is a function that takes an argument `f` and returns `f(f(2))`.\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate B 3\n\nNow we can compute `B 3`. We apply the function `B` to the argument `3`.\n`B 3 = (λf. f(f(2))) 3 = 3(3(2))`\nWe use the rule that `m n` equals `n^m`.\n*   `3(2)`: exponent is `3`, base is `2`. `2^3 = 8`.\n*   `3(3(2)) = 3(8)`: exponent is `3`, base is `8`. `8^3 = (2^3)^3 = 2^9 = 512`.\nSo, the result of `B 3` is the Church numeral `512`.\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\n\nWe substitute this result back into our expression for `n`.\n`n = 3 (B 3) = 3(512)`\nThis means the exponent is `3` and the base is `512`.\n`n = 512^3 = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9 * 3) = 2^{27}`.\n\nWait, let me retrace the calculation carefully.\n`E = 3 (B 3)`\nAnd `B = λf. f(f(2))`. Whoops, let's look at B again.\n`B = S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))`. My application of Ψ was wrong. Let's trace it.\nLet `x_0 = K(2)`.\n`x_1 = Ψ(x_0) = λy. y(x_0 y) = λy. y(2)`.\n`x_2 = Ψ(x_1) = λy. y(x_1 y) = λy. y(y(2))`.\nLet me re-check my definition of `B`. It was `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K...))))`. There were **three** `S(I)`s.\n`B = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))) = Ψ(Ψ(Ψ(K(2))))`.\nLet's re-calculate `B`'s functional form:\n*   `x_0 = K(2)`\n*   `x_1 = Ψ(x_0) = λy. y(2)`\n*   `x_2 = Ψ(x_1) = λy. y(y(2))`\n*   `B = x_3 = Ψ(x_2) = λy. y(x_2 y) = λy. y(y(y(2)))`.\nSo, `B = λf. f(f(f(2)))`.\n\nNow let's re-calculate `B 3`:\n`B 3 = (λf. f(f(f(2)))) 3 = 3(3(3(2)))`.\nLet's evaluate this power tower:\n1.  `3(2)` -> base `2`, exponent `3`. `2^3 = 8`.\n2.  `3(8)` -> base `8`, exponent `3`. `8^3 = 512`.\n3.  `3(512)` -> base `512`, exponent `3`. `512^3 = (2^9)^3 = 2^{27}`.\nSo, the result of `B 3` is the Church numeral `2^{27}`.\n\nNow we can compute the final `n`:\n`n = 3 (B 3) = 3 (2^{27})`.\nThis means the exponent is `3` and the base is `2^{27}`.\n`n = (2^{27})^3 = 2^{27 * 3} = 2^{81}`.\n\n### Step 8: Find log_2(n)\n\nThe Church numeral represented by the expression is `n = 2^{81}`.\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^{81}) = 81`.\n\n<<<81>>>"
