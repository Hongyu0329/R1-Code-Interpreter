    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Noble Gases:** The noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn). Oganesson (Og) is a synthetic element first created in 2005, so it was not present on Earth in 2002 and is not naturally occurring.\n\n2.  **Define \"Terrestrial Matter\":** \"All terrestrial matter\" refers to the entire mass of the Earth, including its atmosphere, hydrosphere (oceans), crust, mantle, and core. We are looking for the element with the smallest mass fraction relative to the total mass of the Earth (~5.97 x 10^24 kg).\n\n3.  **Analyze Abundances of Stable Noble Gases:**\n    *   **Argon (Ar):** Is the most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.93% of the Earth's atmosphere. A significant portion of this is Argon-40, produced from the radioactive decay of Potassium-40 in the Earth's crust.\n    *   **Neon (Ne), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe):** These are primarily primordial gases, meaning they were present when the Earth formed. Being relatively inert and volatile, much of their original inventory was lost to space.\n    *   When comparing their atmospheric abundances (where they are most concentrated), the order from most to least abundant is: Argon > Neon > Krypton > Xenon.\n    *   Xenon is exceptionally rare, even more so than expected when compared to the other noble gases. This is sometimes called the \"missing xenon problem.\" By mass, there are roughly 2.1 x 10^12 kg of Xenon in the atmosphere.\n    *   **Helium (He):** Although the second most abundant element in the universe, it is much less common on Earth. This is because its low mass allows it to escape Earth's gravitational pull. It is continuously produced by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the crust, but it is also continuously lost to space. Its abundance is greater than that of Xenon.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Abundance of Radon (Rn):**\n    *   The crucial factor for Radon is its radioactivity. All isotopes of Radon are highly unstable.\n    *   The longest-lived isotope is Radon-222, with a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n    *   Radon is not a primordial element. It exists on Earth only because it is continuously generated as a part of the decay chain of uranium and thorium, which are found in rocks and soil.\n    *   Because of its extremely short half-life, Radon cannot accumulate. It decays almost as quickly as it is formed. This means that at any given moment, the total amount of Radon present across the entire planet (the \"steady-state\" amount) is minuscule.\n    *   Scientific estimates place the total mass of Radon in the entire Earth's atmosphere at any given time at only a few kilograms.\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    *   We need to find the noble gas with the smallest total mass on Earth.\n    *   The rarest *stable* noble gas is Xenon, with a total mass on the order of trillions of kilograms (10^12 kg).\n    *   The total mass of the *unstable* noble gas Radon is on the order of a few kilograms.\n    *   Clearly, the mass of Radon is many, many orders of magnitude smaller than the mass of Xenon.\n    *   Therefore, as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, Radon is by far the rarest noble gas. The specific year 2002 does not alter this fundamental fact of nuclear physics and geochemistry.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important to distinguish between stable gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and the radioactive gas (Rn).\n*   The rarity of a radioactive element with a short half-life is determined by its steady-state quantity (rate of formation vs. rate of decay), not by any primordial abundance.\n*   The term \"terrestrial matter\" implies the whole Earth, but the conclusion would be the same even if we only considered the atmosphere, as both Xenon and Radon are found there, with Radon being far rarer.\n*   The year 2002 is relevant mainly to exclude the synthetic element Oganesson.\n\nFinal Answer: Based on its extreme radioactivity and very short half-life, the total amount of Radon on Earth at any given time is incredibly small, making it the rarest of the naturally occurring noble gases.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
