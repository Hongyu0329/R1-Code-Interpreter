    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Question and Define \"Triple Crown\"**\n\nThe question asks for the total number of players who have won a \"Triple Crown\" in MLB baseball. This is an important distinction, as there are two types of Triple Crowns: one for batters and one for pitchers. The question asks for the number of *winners* (unique players), not the number of times the feat has been accomplished.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead their league (American League or National League) in Batting Average (BA), Home Runs (HR), and Runs Batted In (RBI) in the same season.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A player must lead their league (American League or National League) in Wins (W), Strikeouts (K), and Earned Run Average (ERA) in the same season.\n\nTo find the total number of winners, we must count the unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown and the unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown, and then combine them.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Batting Triple Crown Winners**\n\nWe will list every player who has won the batting Triple Crown and count the number of unique individuals.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Some players have won it more than once. They should only be counted once in the final tally of \"winners\".\n\n**List of Batting Triple Crown Winners by League and Year:**\n\n*   **National League (NL):**\n    1.  Paul Hines (1878)\n    2.  Hugh Duffy (1894)\n    3.  Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925) - *1 player, 2 wins*\n    4.  Chuck Klein (1933)\n    5.  Joe Medwick (1937)\n*   **American League (AL):**\n    1.  Nap Lajoie (1901)\n    2.  Ty Cobb (1909)\n    3.  Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n    4.  Lou Gehrig (1934)\n    5.  Ted Williams (1942, 1947) - *1 player, 2 wins*\n    6.  Mickey Mantle (1956)\n    7.  Frank Robinson (1966)\n    8.  Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n    9.  Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n*   **American Association (AA) - *Recognized as a Major League at the time*:**\n    1.  Tip O'Neill (1887)\n\n**Counting the Unique Batting Winners:**\nCounting each unique name from the lists above: there are **15 unique batting Triple Crown winners**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Pitching Triple Crown Winners**\n\nNext, we list every player who has won the pitching Triple Crown and count the number of unique individuals.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Similar to batters, several pitchers have won it multiple times but are only counted once. Also, some wins occurred in the 19th century, while one occurred in the COVID-shortened 2020 season, but all are officially recognized.\n\n**List of Unique Pitching Triple Crown Winners:**\n\n1.  Tommy Bond (1877)\n2.  Old Hoss Radbourn (1884)\n3.  Tim Keefe (1888)\n4.  John Clarkson (1889)\n5.  Amos Rusie (1894)\n6.  Cy Young (1901)\n7.  Rube Waddell (1905)\n8.  Christy Mathewson (1905, 1908)\n9.  Walter Johnson (1913, 1918, 1924)\n10. Pete Alexander (1915, 1916, 1920)\n11. Dazzy Vance (1924)\n12. Lefty Grove (1930, 1931)\n13. Lefty Gomez (1934, 1937)\n14. Bucky Walters (1939)\n15. Hal Newhouser (1945)\n16. Sandy Koufax (1963, 1965, 1966)\n17. Steve Carlton (1972)\n18. Roger Clemens (1997, 1998)\n19. Pedro Martinez (1999)\n20. Randy Johnson (2002)\n21. Johan Santana (2006)\n22. Clayton Kershaw (2011)\n23. Justin Verlander (2011)\n24. Shane Bieber (2020)\n\n**Counting the Unique Pitching Winners:**\nCounting the unique names in this list gives us **24 unique pitching Triple Crown winners**.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculate the Final Total**\n\nTo get the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we sum the number of unique batting winners and unique pitching winners.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must ensure no player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown. A review of the lists confirms there is no overlap between the two groups.\n\nTotal Unique Winners = (Unique Batting Winners) + (Unique Pitching Winners)\nTotal Unique Winners = 15 + 24 = 39\n\nSo, there are **39** individual players who have won a Triple Crown (either batting or pitching) in MLB history.\n\n<<<39>>>"
