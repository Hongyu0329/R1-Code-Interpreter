    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific character from the 1972 film *Solaris* based on a particular sentiment they express.\n*   **Film:** *Solaris* (1972), directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. This is a critical detail, as dialogue and characterization can differ from the original novel by Stanis≈Çaw Lem or the 2002 film adaptation.\n*   **Character:** The person must be one of the listed options: Kris, Hari, Snaut, Sartorius, or Gibarian.\n*   **Sentiment:** The character feels \"ashamed to miss\" a specific earthly experience.\n*   **Experience:** The \"sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\"\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points and Character Analysis**\n\nWe need to consider each character's role, personality, and relationship with Earth within the context of the film.\n\n*   **Kris Kelvin (A):** He is the protagonist sent from Earth to the Solaris station. The film's opening sequence extensively features his home, a dacha surrounded by nature. The sounds of rain, water, and rustling leaves are central to his connection to Earth. He actively and openly misses Earth; he does not express shame about this feeling. His longing is a driving force of the narrative.\n*   **Hari (B):** She is a \"visitor\" or \"guest,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memories of his deceased wife. She has no independent memories of Earth herself. Her entire existence is confined to the station and her knowledge of the world comes through Kris. Therefore, she cannot miss something she never experienced firsthand.\n*   **Snaut (C):** He is one of the two scientists who have been on the station for a long time before Kris arrives. He is world-weary, cynical, but also deeply philosophical. He often acts as an expositor, reflecting on humanity's purpose and the psychological toll of their mission. Being away from Earth for so long could lead to a sense of detachment, and his reflective nature makes him a likely candidate to feel shame about this loss of connection.\n*   **Sartorius (D):** The other long-term scientist on the station. He is portrayed as rigid, dogmatically scientific, and emotionally repressed. He is focused on studying the Solaris ocean and dismisses emotional and philosophical concerns as distractions. While he may be detached from Earth, he is unlikely to express \"shame\" about it; it would be more in character for him to see it as a necessary part of his scientific work.\n*   **Gibarian (E):** He is the scientist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. He appears only in a video recording he left for Kris. In this message, he is desperate and frantic, trying to warn Kris. His emotional state is one of fear and confusion, not reflective shame about missing Earth.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\n\nThe key is to recall or identify the specific scene where this line is spoken.\n*   There is a pivotal conversation between the newly arrived Kris Kelvin and the veteran scientist, Dr. Snaut.\n*   In this dialogue, Snaut confesses the extent of their alienation and the psychological breakdown occurring on the station.\n*   He reflects on how long they have been away from normal human experiences. He admits he has become so detached that he doesn't even miss women anymore. He then expresses his shame over losing touch with something even more fundamental.\n*   The specific line, delivered by Snaut to Kris, is: \"Forgive me, but I am ashamed... ashamed to say I miss... the sound of rustling leaves.\"\n*   This confession highlights Snaut's profound sense of loss and his awareness of his own dehumanization after years in space, a central theme of Tarkovsky's film.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the direct dialogue from the 1972 film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
