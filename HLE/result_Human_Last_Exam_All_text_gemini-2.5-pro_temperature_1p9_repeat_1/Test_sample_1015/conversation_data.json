    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n*   **Cambré:** A ballet term meaning \"arched.\" It refers to a bend of the body from the waist, either forward, backward, or to the side.\n*   **Derrière:** A ballet term meaning \"to the back.\"\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A bend of the upper body backward, with the back arching.\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A method of ballet training developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia. It is known for its precise, logical progression, strength, and focus on clean lines and core stability.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** A method developed by choreographer George Balanchine in the United States. It is characterized by speed, musicality, dynamic energy, and an extended, neoclassical aesthetic.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Execution:** The bend is initiated from the upper spine (thoracic region).\n*   **Key Principle:** The core is engaged, and the hips must remain stable and square, directly over the supporting leg(s). The dancer lifts up and out of the waist before bending back.\n*   **Goal:** To develop upper back flexibility and strength while maintaining a strong, stable pelvic alignment. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault as it breaks the clean line and relies on pelvic instability rather than true spinal flexibility.\n*   **Appearance:** A pure, controlled arch of the upper back.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Execution:** The movement is often larger, more dynamic, and integrated with the musical phrasing.\n*   **Key Principle:** The dancer is often encouraged to press the hips forward. This action is sometimes described as a \"hip-led\" backbend.\n*   **Goal:** To create a long, sweeping, and visually dramatic line that extends the classical form. This forward hip placement allows for what appears to be a much deeper and more extreme backbend.\n*   **Appearance:** A very deep, open C-curve shape throughout the entire body, from the knees through the torso.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Methods and Evaluate Answer Choices**\nThe most significant and fundamental point of difference lies in how the pelvis is used.\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there might be subtle stylistic differences, the basic arm positions (e.g., fifth en haut) are often the same. This is not the primary distinction.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the crucial difference. Vaganova demands stable, square hips. Balanchine encourages a forward press of the hips. This is a foundational technical distinction between the two approaches to this step.\n*   **C. Speed:** Balanchine's style is generally known for its speed, but a cambré can be performed at various speeds in either method depending on the context of the exercise. The underlying mechanics are the more critical difference than the tempo.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique used. The forward placement of the hip in the Balanchine method *allows* for a deeper bend. Therefore, hip placement is the *cause* of the difference in degree, making it the more fundamental answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head follows the line of the spine and completes the arch. While stylistic flair might differ, the basic principle is similar. This is not the main technical differentiator.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe core technical difference that defines the execution and appearance of a cambré derrière in the Vaganova versus the Balanchine method is the action and placement of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
