    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Game Scenario\n\n*   **Game:** 100BB rake-free cash game.\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most profitable position in poker because you act last post-flop. This advantage allows you to play the widest range of hands compared to any other position.\n*   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x the big blind. This is a standard opening size.\n*   **The \"Rake-Free\" Condition:** This is a crucial detail. In a standard game, the house takes a small percentage of most pots (the rake). This rake slightly reduces the expected value (EV) of playing any hand. In a rake-free game, that penalty is gone. This means that marginal hands that might be break-even or slightly unprofitable in a raked game become profitable. Consequently, your opening range on the button should be even wider than the standard GTO charts for raked games.\n\n### Step 2: Define \"Worst Suited Jack\"\n\nA \"suited jack\" is a hand containing a Jack and another card of the same suit. The possible hands, from best to worst, are generally considered to be JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n\n\"Worst\" in this context refers to the hand with the lowest expected value (EV) that is still considered a standard, profitable open-raise. The question asks for the worst hand you *should* open, not a hand you should fold.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Suited Jack Hands\n\nWe need to find the weakest hand in the JXs (Jack-X suited) category that is still a profitable open from the button. Let's evaluate them based on their strength.\n\n1.  **Premium/Strong (JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs):** These are monster hands from the button and are always opened. They have high card value, flush potential, and straight potential.\n2.  **Good/Playable (J9s, J8s, J7s):** These hands are still very strong opens from the button. They make good flushes and have reasonable straight potential (J9s is a one-gapper, J8s is a two-gapper, etc.). These are easily profitable opens.\n3.  **Marginal/Weak (J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s):** This is where we will find our answer. We need to determine which of these is the weakest. The weakness of a hand is determined by:\n    *   **Kicker Strength:** When you make a pair of Jacks, having a higher second card (kicker) is better. In this regard, J6s > J5s > J4s > J3s > J2s.\n    *   **Straight Potential (Connectivity):** The closer the two cards are, the easier it is to make a straight. For example, JTs is much better at making straights than J2s. The hand J5s has unique \"wheel\" straight potential (A-2-3-4-5) that J6s lacks, which often makes J5s slightly more valuable than J6s. However, when comparing the lowest part of the range (J4s, J3s, J2s), both kicker strength and connectivity decrease as the second card gets lower.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion based on GTO Principles\n\nAccording to Game Theory Optimal (GTO) play, a button opening range in a 100BB cash game is very wide, typically around 45-50% of hands even in a raked environment. In such a range, **all suited Jacks are considered standard opens.**\n\nSince all suited Jacks should be opened from the button, the \"worst\" one you should open is simply the weakest one on the absolute hand ranking scale.\n\n*   **J2s** has the lowest kicker (a 2).\n*   **J2s** has the worst connectivity for making straights (a 9-rank gap).\n\nEven though it is the weakest, its suit-potential combined with the supreme positional advantage of the button and the rake-free environment makes it a clearly profitable open-raise. Any other suited Jack (like J3s, J4s, etc.) is objectively stronger because it has a better kicker and/or better connectivity.\n\nTherefore, J2s is the weakest hand in the \"suited jack\" category, and since it *should* be opened in this scenario, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
