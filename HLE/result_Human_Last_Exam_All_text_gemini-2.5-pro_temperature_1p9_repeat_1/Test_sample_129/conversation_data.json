    "This problem asks for the number of true boolean expressions that can be formed using exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}. We must consider all valid syntactic structures of length 5 and then evaluate them. The operator precedence is ! > & > |.\n\nLet's break down the problem by classifying the possible structures of a valid 5-symbol expression. Any such expression must fall into one of the following top-level categories:\n1.  An expression enclosed in parentheses: `(A)`\n2.  A negated expression: `!A`\n3.  An expression with a central binary operator: `A op B`\n\nWe will analyze each category, count the number of true expressions within it, and ensure there is no overlap between categories.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze expressions of the form `(A)`\n\nFor the expression `(A)` to have a length of 5, the inner expression `A` must have a length of 3. We need to find all valid, true expressions `A` of length 3.\nThe possible structures for a length-3 expression `A` are:\n*   `L op L` (where `L` is a literal T or F, `op` is & or |):\n    *   `T & T` -> True\n    *   `T | T` -> True\n    *   `T | F` -> True\n    *   `F | T` -> True\n    There are 4 such true expressions. Enclosing them in parentheses gives 4 true expressions of length 5: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`.\n*   `!!L`:\n    *   `!!T` -> True\n    *   `!!F` -> False\n    This gives 1 true expression. Enclosing it gives `(!!T)`.\n*   `(L)`:\n    *   `(T)` -> True\n    *   `(F)` -> False\n    This gives 1 true expression. Enclosing it gives `((T))`.\n\n**Total for Category 1: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6**\n\n### Step 2: Analyze expressions of the form `!A`\n\nFor `!A` to have length 5, expression `A` must have length 4. For `!A` to be true, `A` must be false. We need to find all valid, false expressions `A` of length 4.\nThe possible structures for a length-4 expression `A` are:\n*   `L op !L` (parsed as `L op (!L)`): There are 2*2*2 = 8 such expressions. The ones that evaluate to False are:\n    *   `T & !T` (is F), `F & !T` (is F), `F & !F` (is F), `F | !T` (is F).\n    Negating these 4 false expressions gives 4 true length-5 expressions: `!(T&!T)`, `!(F&!T)`, `!(F&!F)`, `!(F|!T)`.\n*   `!L op L` (parsed as `(!L) op L`): Symmetrically, there are 4 such expressions that are false.\n    *   `!T & T` (is F), `!T & F` (is F), `!F & F` (is F), `!T | F` (is F).\n    Negating these gives another 4 true expressions.\n*   `!(L)`:\n    *   `!(T)` is False. Negating this gives `!!(T)`, which is a true length-5 expression.\n*   `(!L)`:\n    *   `(!T)` is False. Negating this gives `!(!T)`, which is a true length-5 expression.\n*   `!!!L` (parsed as `!(!(!L))`):\n    *   `!!!T` is False. Negating this gives `!!!!T`, which is a true length-5 expression.\n\n**Total for Category 2: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze expressions of the form `A op B`\n\nThis category includes expressions where the top-level operator is binary, without outer parentheses. We must be careful about operator precedence.\n\n*   **Structure `L op1 L op2 L`**: 3 literals and 2 operators. Length is 1+1+1+1+1=5.\n    *   `L & L & L`: Only `T&T&T` is true. (1)\n    *   `L | L | L`: All are true except `F|F|F`. (7)\n    *   `L & L | L` (parsed `(L&L)|L`): True if the last literal is T (4 cases), or if the first two are T and the last is F (1 case). Total 5 true expressions.\n    *   `L | L & L` (parsed `L|(L&L)`): True if the first literal is T (4 cases), or if the last two are T and the first is F (1 case). Total 5 true expressions.\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18.\n\n*   **Structure `!L op !L`**: 2 literals, 3 operators. Length is 2+1+2=5. Parsed as `(!L) op (!L)`.\n    *   `!L & !L`: True only for `!F & !F`. (1)\n    *   `!L | !L`: True for all except `!T | !T`. (3)\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n*   **Structure with parentheses and mixed operators**:\n    *   `L op (L)` and `(L) op L`: Each structure has `&` (1 true case) and `|` (3 true cases). So 4 true expressions for each. (e.g., `T&(T)` and `T|(T), T|(F), F|(T)`). Total 4 + 4 = 8.\n    *   `L op !!L` and `!!L op L`: Each structure has `&` (1 true case) and `|` (3 true cases). Total 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nLet's re-organize the counting for `A op B` structures to ensure no overlaps with the `L op1 L op2 L` cases. A clearer method is to break down by operands.\n1.  `L op L op L` cases: Total 18 true expressions, as calculated above.\n2.  `L op (L)`: 4 true expressions.\n3.  `(L) op L`: 4 true expressions.\n4.  `!L op !L`: 4 true expressions.\n5.  `L op !!L`: 4 true expressions.\n6.  `!!L op L`: 4 true expressions.\n\nThese structures are mutually exclusive. For example, `L op (L)` is distinct from `L op L op L` because of the parentheses.\n\n**Total for Category 3: 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 38**\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSumming the counts from all categories:\n*   Category 1 `(A)`: 6\n*   Category 2 `!A`: 11\n*   Category 3 `A op B`: 38\n\nGrand Total = 6 + 11 + 38 = 55.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n- Group 1: (A). `(T&T), (T|T), (T|F), (F|T)` (4), `(!!T)` (1), `((T))` (1). Total 6. Correct.\n- Group 2: !A. `!(T&!T)`, `!(F&!T)`, `!(F&!F)`, `!(F|!T)` (4). `!(!T&T)`, `!(!T&F)`, `!(!F&F)`, `!(!T|F)` (4). `!!(T)` (1). `!(!T)` (1). `!!!!T` (1). Total 11. Correct.\n- Group 3: A op B.\n  - `L op L op L`: 1+7+5+5 = 18.\n  - `!L op !L`: `!F&!F`(1), `|` has 3 true. (4 total).\n  - `L op (L)`: `T&(T)`(1), `|` has 3 true. (4 total).\n  - `(L) op L`: symmetric. (4 total).\n  - `L op !!L`: `T&!!T`(1), `|` has 3 true. (4 total).\n  - `!!L op L`: symmetric. (4 total).\n  Total: 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 38. Correct.\nTotal = 6 + 11 + 38 = 55.\n\n<<<55>>>"
