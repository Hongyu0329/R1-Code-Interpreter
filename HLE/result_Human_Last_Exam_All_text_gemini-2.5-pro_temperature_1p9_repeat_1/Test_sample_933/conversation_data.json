    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be produced efficiently.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Synthesis of Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF4)**\nXenon tetrafluoride is a chemical compound synthesized from its constituent elements, xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2). The balanced chemical equation for its primary synthesis method is:\nXe(g) + 2 F2(g) → XeF4(s)\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Efficiently Produced\"**\nIn the context of chemical synthesis, \"efficiently\" implies a method that produces the desired compound with a reasonably high yield and at a practical rate. This usually refers to well-established, standard laboratory or industrial procedures.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reaction Conditions for XeF4 Synthesis**\nThe formation of xenon fluorides is highly dependent on the reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants.\n*   **Reactant Ratio:** To specifically produce XeF4, a stoichiometric excess of fluorine is required. A typical molar ratio of Xe to F2 is about 1:5. If xenon is in excess, Xenon difluoride (XeF2) is the main product. If fluorine is in large excess (e.g., 1:20 ratio), Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) is favored.\n*   **Temperature:** Temperature is a critical factor. The reaction requires a significant amount of energy, known as activation energy, primarily to break the strong F-F bond in the fluorine molecule. Therefore, heating is necessary for the reaction to proceed at a reasonable speed.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Different Synthesis Methods and their Temperatures**\nThere are several methods to synthesize XeF4, but the most common and well-documented one for efficient, large-scale preparation is the thermal method.\n\n*   **Thermal Method:** This involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas in a sealed, inert container (typically made of nickel or Monel).\n    *   According to extensive chemical literature (e.g., advanced inorganic chemistry textbooks like Greenwood and Earnshaw's \"Chemistry of the Elements\" or Holleman-Wiberg's \"Inorganic Chemistry\"), the standard and optimal temperature for efficiently producing XeF4 is **400 °C**.\n    *   At this temperature, with a 1:5 molar ratio of Xe:F2 and a pressure of about 6 atmospheres, the reaction proceeds for several hours to give a high yield of pure, crystalline XeF4.\n\n*   **Alternative Methods:**\n    *   **Photochemical Method (UV light):** Can produce XeF4 at lower temperatures (even room temperature), but the process can be slow and often yields a mixture of products (XeF2 and XeF4), making it less \"efficient\" for isolating pure XeF4.\n    *   **Electrical Discharge Method:** Also operates at lower temperatures but shares the same disadvantages as the photochemical method regarding product purity and control.\n\nGiven that the question asks for the temperature for *efficient* production, the thermal method is the most relevant one to consider as it is the standard for high-yield synthesis.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Provided Temperature Choices based on the Thermal Method**\n\n*   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is too high for the efficient production of XeF4. At temperatures above ~500°C, the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) becomes more favorable. Also, the rate of decomposition of XeF4 increases.\n*   **B. 400 °C:** This is the widely cited optimal temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF4, balancing the need for sufficient activation energy with the need to avoid the formation of XeF6.\n*   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate is very slow. Furthermore, lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of the lower fluoride, XeF2, even when fluorine is in excess. This temperature is therefore not efficient for producing XeF4.\n*   **D. 78 °C, E. 0 °C, F. -78 °C:** These temperatures are far too low to provide the necessary activation energy for the thermal reaction between xenon and fluorine. No significant amount of product would be formed via this method.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the *coldest* temperature at which XeF4 can *still* be produced *efficiently*. Based on the standard thermal synthesis method, 400°C is the well-established temperature for achieving a good yield at a practical rate. While reactions can be initiated at lower temperatures using other energy sources (like UV light), these methods are generally not considered as \"efficient\" for producing pure XeF4 in good yield. Among the given choices, 400°C represents the lowest temperature that allows for efficient production using the most common and reliable method. Temperatures below this, such as 200°C, are considered inefficient due to extremely slow kinetics and the favored formation of a different product (XeF2). Therefore, 400 °C is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
