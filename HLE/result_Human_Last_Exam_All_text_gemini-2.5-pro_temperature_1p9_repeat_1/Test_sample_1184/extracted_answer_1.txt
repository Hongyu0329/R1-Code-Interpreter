Based on the analysis of the human voltage-gated calcium channel beta-1 subunit (CACNB1, UniProt Q02641-1) in complex with the alpha-1 subunit (Cav2.3):

**1) The exact residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit are located in the Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) of the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain. The most critical residues are:**

*   **Tyr222 (Tyrosine at position 222):** Forms a key part of the hydrophobic binding pocket.
*   **Asp263 (Aspartate at position 263):** Forms a crucial salt bridge with the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit.
*   **Trp267 (Tryptophan at position 267):** Together with Tyr222, anchors the AID via hydrophobic interactions.
*   **Glu322 (Glutamate at position 322):** Forms a stabilizing hydrogen bond with the AID.

**2) The exact residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning the gating properties (gating modulation) of the alpha-1 subunit are located in the N-terminal domain. Key residues responsible for modulating steady-state inactivation are:**

*   **Lys2 (Lysine at position 2):** A basic residue at the start of the N-terminus.
*   **Lys3 (Lysine at position 3):** An adjacent basic residue at the start of the N-terminus.
