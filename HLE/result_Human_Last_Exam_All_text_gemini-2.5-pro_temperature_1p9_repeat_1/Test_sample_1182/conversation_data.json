    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the genus of the curve.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $\\deg(f) = 5$.\nThe genus $g$ of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ is given by $g = \\lfloor (\\deg(f) - 1)/2 \\rfloor$.\nFor our curve, $g = \\lfloor (5 - 1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$. So, $C$ is a genus 2 curve.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the branch points of the hyperelliptic map.**\nThe hyperelliptic map is the projection $(x,y) \\mapsto x$. The branch points of this map are the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ and the point at infinity, $\\infty$.\nLet's find the roots of $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nWe can factor out $x$:\n$f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x + 8)$. Let $P(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\nSo, one root is $r_0 = 0$. The other four roots, let's call them $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$, are the roots of $P(x)=0$.\nThe set of branch points is $B = \\{0, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$. There are $2g+2 = 2(2)+2 = 6$ branch points, as expected.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots.**\nTo understand the reduction of the curve, we need to find the 2-adic valuations $v_2(r_i)$ of the roots. For the root $r_0=0$, the valuation is formally infinite. For the other roots, we use the Newton polygon of the polynomial $P(x)$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation.\nThe polynomial is $P(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + 1x^1 + 8x^0$.\nThe valuations of the coefficients are:\n$v_2(a_4) = v_2(8) = 3$\n$v_2(a_3) = v_2(4) = 2$\n$v_2(a_2) = v_2(4) = 2$\n$v_2(a_1) = v_2(1) = 0$\n$v_2(a_0) = v_2(8) = 3$\nWe plot the points $(i, v_2(a_i))$ for $i=0, \\dots, 4$:\n$(0, 3)$, $(1, 0)$, $(2, 2)$, $(3, 2)$, $(4, 3)$.\nThe lower convex hull of these points forms the Newton polygon. The vertices of the polygon are the points that lie on the hull and are not strictly between two other such points on a line segment.\nLet's list the points: $P_0=(0,3), P_1=(1,0), P_2=(2,2), P_3=(3,2), P_4=(4,3)$.\nThe lower convex hull connects $P_0 \\to P_1 \\to P_4$.\n*   The point $P_2=(2,2)$ is above the line segment $P_1P_4$ (which has equation $y = x-1$).\n*   The point $P_3=(3,2)$ lies exactly on the line segment $P_1P_4$.\nThe vertices of the Newton polygon are $P_0(0,3)$, $P_1(1,0)$, and $P_4(4,3)$.\nThe slopes of the edges of the Newton polygon determine the valuations of the roots. The valuation is the negative of the slope.\n1.  **Edge from $P_0(0,3)$ to $P_1(1,0)$:**\n    Slope = $(0-3)/(1-0) = -3$.\n    Length of x-projection = $1-0=1$.\n    This corresponds to one root, say $\\alpha_1$, with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_1) = -(\\text{slope}) = -(-3) = 3$.\n2.  **Edge from $P_1(1,0)$ to $P_4(4,3)$:**\n    Slope = $(3-0)/(4-1) = 3/3 = 1$.\n    Length of x-projection = $4-1=3$.\n    This corresponds to three roots, say $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$, each with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_i) = -(\\text{slope}) = -1$.\n\nSo, the valuations of the roots of $f(x)$ are:\n$v_2(0) = \\infty$\n$v_2(\\alpha_1) = 3$\n$v_2(\\alpha_2) = -1$\n$v_2(\\alpha_3) = -1$\n$v_2(\\alpha_4) = -1$\n\n**Step 4: Cluster the branch points.**\nThe structure of the stable reduction is determined by how the branch points cluster together in the 2-adic metric. Branch points $r_i, r_j$ are \"close\" if their 2-adic distance $|r_i-r_j|_2 = 2^{-v_2(r_i-r_j)}$ is small, i.e., $v_2(r_i-r_j)$ is large.\nWe can form clusters of roots that are in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (non-negative valuation) and those that are not.\n*   Roots in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$: $0$ (with $v_2=\\infty$) and $\\alpha_1$ (with $v_2=3 > 0$).\n*   Roots not in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$: $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$ (with $v_2=-1 < 0$). These are grouped with the point at infinity.\n\nThis gives us two clusters of branch points:\n*   Cluster 1: $S_1 = \\{0, \\alpha_1\\}$. These are the two branch points inside the open disk of radius 1.\n*   Cluster 2: $S_2 = \\{\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$. These are the four branch points outside the closed disk of radius 1.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the components of the stable reduction.**\nThe stable reduction of the curve will consist of a component for each cluster of branch points.\n*   **Component 1 ($C_1$)**, corresponding to cluster $S_1$: It is a hyperelliptic curve whose branch points are the 2 points in $S_1$. The genus of this component, $g_1$, is $\\lfloor (\\#S_1 - 1)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (2-1)/2 \\rfloor = 0$. So, $C_1$ is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n*   **Component 2 ($C_2$)**, corresponding to cluster $S_2$: It is a hyperelliptic curve whose branch points are the 4 points in $S_2$. The genus of this component, $g_2$, is $\\lfloor (\\#S_2 - 1)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (4-1)/2 \\rfloor = 1$. So, $C_2$ is an elliptic curve.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the number of intersection points (double points).**\nThe stable reduction is a reducible curve formed by the components $C_1$ and $C_2$ intersecting at a certain number of points. These intersection points are the double points (nodes) of the stable reduction. The total number of double points is equal to the number of intersection points, since the components themselves are smooth.\nWe use the genus formula for a stable curve which relates the genus of the original curve to the genera of the components and the topology of their intersection graph:\n$g = \\delta - (N-1) + \\sum_{i=1}^N g_i$\nwhere:\n*   $g$ is the genus of the original curve ($g=2$).\n*   $\\delta$ is the number of double points.\n*   $N$ is the number of components ($N=2$).\n*   $g_i$ are the genera of the components ($g_1=0, g_2=1$).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$2 = \\delta - (2-1) + (0 + 1)$\n$2 = \\delta - 1 + 1$\n$2 = \\delta$\n\nThus, the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve is 2. The stable reduction consists of a rational curve and an elliptic curve intersecting transversally at two points."
