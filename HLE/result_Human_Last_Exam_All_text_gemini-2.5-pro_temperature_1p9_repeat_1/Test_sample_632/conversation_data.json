    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Landmark:** Pantheon.\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n    *   **Timeline:** Until 1950. The removal happened in or around this year.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Features in the Piazza:**\n    *   The Pantheon itself.\n    *   The Fontana del Pantheon (the fountain in the center of the square).\n    *   The obelisk on top of the fountain.\n    *   The buildings surrounding the square.\n    *   Urban infrastructure like paving, lighting, or transportation systems.\n    *   A market.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Potential Feature Against the Question's Criteria:**\n    *   **The Pantheon, the Fountain, and the Obelisk:** These are all still present, so they cannot be the answer.\n    *   **Buildings surrounding the square:** There were indeed major demolitions of buildings that had been built up against the Pantheon over the centuries. This was done to \"isolate\" the monument and restore what was believed to be its original context. However, this large-scale project was primarily carried out during the Fascist era, mostly in the 1920s and 1930s, not in 1950. So, the timing is incorrect.\n    *   **The Market:** The Piazza della Rotonda was famous for its bustling fish and vegetable market for centuries. While the city did clear it out to improve the \"decorum\" of the square, the main efforts to remove it took place in the late 19th century (around 1880). It doesn't fit the 1950 timeline.\n    *   **Urban Infrastructure (Transportation):** This is the most promising lead. Rome had an extensive network of trams in the first half of the 20th century. Historical photos clearly show tram tracks running directly through the Piazza della Rotonda, passing between the Pantheon and the central fountain. The period after WWII, particularly the 1950s, was a time when Rome's administration began systematically dismantling tram lines in the historic center to make way for the increasing number of buses and private cars.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Specificity of the Date:** The year 1950 is a critical clue. It points away from the more famous 19th-century and Fascist-era changes and toward post-war modernization efforts.\n*   **The Definition of \"Architectural Feature\":** The term is not limited to buildings. It can encompass any significant man-made structure that defines the character of a space, including infrastructure like railway or tramway tracks.\n*   **The \"Uniqueness\" of the Feature:** Having a modern, industrial transportation system like a tram, with its tracks and overhead power lines, run directly through one of the most ancient and artistically significant squares in the world was a very distinct and characteristic feature of that era, making it \"unique\" in its juxtaposition of old and new.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe feature in question was the **tramway line**. The tracks ran right through the middle of the piazza. This line, part of Rome's older public transport network, was removed around 1950 as part of a city-wide plan to decommission trams in the historic center in favor of buses and cars.\n\n<<<The tramway line>>>"
