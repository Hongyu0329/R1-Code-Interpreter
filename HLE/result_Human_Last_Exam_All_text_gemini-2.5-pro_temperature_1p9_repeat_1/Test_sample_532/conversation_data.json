    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of `G` is product-free if for any elements `a, b` in `S` (including the case where `a=b`), their product `ab` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S \\cdot S \\cap S = \\emptyset`.\n    *   An immediate consequence is that the identity element `e` can never be in a product-free set, because if `e \\in S`, then `e \\cdot e = e \\in S`, violating the condition.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` that is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. In other words, if you add any element `g \\in G \\setminus S` to `S`, the new set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called a \"filled group\" if the union of all its maximal product-free sets equals `G \\setminus \\{e\\}`. This means that every non-identity element of `G` must belong to at least one maximal product-free set. An element that does not belong to any maximal product-free set is called a *transient element*. A group is filled if its only transient element is the identity `e`.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. So, if `|G| = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}`, then `G \\cong P_1 \\times P_2 \\times \\cdots \\times P_k`, where `P_i` is the unique Sylow `p_i`-subgroup of `G`.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the problem for nilpotent groups\n\nThe question is to find all finite nilpotent groups that are filled. A crucial theorem simplifies this problem:\n\n**Theorem:** Let `G = H \\times K` where `gcd(|H|, |K|) = 1`. Then `G` is a filled group if and only if both `H` and `K` are filled groups.\n\nSince a finite nilpotent group `G` is the direct product of its Sylow `p`-subgroups (which have coprime orders), we can apply this theorem repeatedly. It follows that **a finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if each of its Sylow p-subgroups is a filled group.**\n\nThis reduces the original problem to a more specific one: for each prime `p`, which finite `p`-groups are filled?\n\n### Step 3: Analyze `p`-groups for odd `p`\n\nA key result in the study of filled groups is:\n\n**Theorem:** Any finite group of odd order is a filled group.\n\nSince a `p`-group for an odd prime `p` has order `p^k` (which is odd), it follows that **all finite p-groups for odd primes p are filled groups.**\n\nThis part of the analysis is therefore complete. The Sylow `p`-subgroups for all odd primes `p` in a nilpotent group are always filled.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze `p`-groups for `p=2` (2-groups)\n\nThe remaining task is to identify which finite 2-groups are filled. This is the most complex part of the classification, and we rely on known results from the literature on this topic.\n\n*   **Abelian 2-groups:** An abelian group `A` is filled if and only if `|A|` is odd or `|A|=2`. For an abelian 2-group, its order is `2^k`. So, it is filled only if `2^k=2`, which means `k=1`. Thus, the only filled abelian 2-group is the cyclic group of order 2, `C_2`. Other examples like `C_4` and `C_2 \\times C_2` are known not to be filled groups. For example, in `C_4 = \\langle a \\mid a^4=e \\rangle`, the element `a^2` is transient.\n\n*   **Non-Abelian 2-groups:** The classification is non-trivial.\n    *   The smallest non-abelian 2-group is the quaternion group of order 8, `Q_8 = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}`. It has been proven that `Q_8` **is a filled group**. Every non-identity element of `Q_8` belongs to some maximal product-free set.\n    *   The other non-abelian group of order 8, the dihedral group `D_8`, has been proven to be **not a filled group**. It contains transient elements besides the identity.\n    *   In fact, the classification of filled 2-groups is remarkably simple. It has been shown that the only finite 2-groups that are filled are `C_2` and `Q_8`.\n\nSo, for a nilpotent group `G` to be filled, its Sylow 2-subgroup must be a filled 2-group. This means the Sylow 2-subgroup must be `C_2` or `Q_8`, or trivial (if the order of `G` is odd).\n\n### Step 5: Synthesize the final answer\n\nCombining the results from the previous steps, we can now state the full classification for finite nilpotent filled groups.\n\nA finite nilpotent group `G` has a Sylow 2-subgroup `P_2` (which is trivial if `|G|` is odd) and Sylow `p`-subgroups `P_p` for odd primes `p`.\n*   `G` is filled if and only if all its Sylow subgroups `P_p` are filled.\n*   For any odd prime `p`, the Sylow `p`-subgroup `P_p` is a `p`-group of odd order, and is therefore always filled.\n*   Thus, `G` is filled if and only if its Sylow 2-subgroup, `P_2`, is filled.\n*   The only filled 2-groups are the trivial group `{e}`, `C_2`, and `Q_8`.\n\nSo, a finite nilpotent group `G` is a filled group if and only if its Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to `{e}`, `C_2`, or `Q_8`.\n\nWe can rephrase this as a final conclusion.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nA finite nilpotent group `G` is a filled group if and only if it satisfies one of the following two conditions:\n1.  The order of `G` is odd. (This is equivalent to its Sylow 2-subgroup being the trivial group).\n2.  The Sylow 2-subgroup of `G` is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2 (`C_2`) or the quaternion group of order 8 (`Q_8`).\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if its Sylow 2-subgroup is trivial, the cyclic group of order 2 ($C_2$), or the quaternion group of order 8 ($Q_8$).>>>"
