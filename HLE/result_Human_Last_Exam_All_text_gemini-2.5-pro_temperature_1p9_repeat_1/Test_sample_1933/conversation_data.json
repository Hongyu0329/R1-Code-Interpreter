    "Answering this question involves determining the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a class of first-order logic formulas.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Schema and the Logic\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, let's denote them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A structure over this schema consists of a universe of elements and an interpretation for each predicate, i.e., a subset of the universe for each $P_i$.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This fragment of First-Order Logic allows formulas to be built using:\n    *   Atomic formulas: $P_i(x)$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    *   Logical connectives: Conjunction ($\\land$), Truth ($\\top$), and Falsity ($\\bot$).\n    *   Quantifiers: Existential quantification ($\\exists$).\n    *   It does **not** allow negation ($\\neg$), disjunction ($\\lor$), or universal quantification ($\\forall$).\n\nThe question asks for the VC dimension of this set of formulas. In this context, we consider sentences (formulas with no free variables). Each sentence $\\phi$ defines a concept, which is the set of all structures that model $\\phi$. The concept class is the set of all such concepts.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing the Formulas\nAny sentence $\\phi$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is built by conjunction and existential quantification. Since the predicates are unary and there are no equality atoms, variables quantified by different existential quantifiers are independent unless they appear in the same atomic formula (which is not possible for different variables in a unary predicate). A general formula can be rearranged and simplified. For example, $\\exists x \\exists y (P_1(x) \\land P_2(y))$ is equivalent to $(\\exists x P_1(x)) \\land (\\exists y P_2(y))$.\n\nAny sentence in this fragment is equivalent to a conjunction of sentences of the form $\\exists x . \\psi(x)$, where $\\psi(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving only the variable $x$.\nLet's define a **basic sentence** $C_K$ for any non-empty subset $K \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ as:\n$C_K := \\exists x . \\bigwedge_{i \\in K} P_i(x)$\n\nThis sentence is true in a structure $D$ (written $D \\models C_K$) if and only if there exists an element in the universe of $D$ that satisfies all predicates $P_i$ for $i \\in K$.\nAny sentence in our fragment is equivalent to a conjunction of these basic sentences: $\\phi \\equiv \\bigwedge_{j=1}^m C_{K_j}$. (We can also have the formulas $\\top$ and $\\bot$).\n\n### Step 3: Understanding VC Dimension in this Context\nThe VC dimension is the maximum size $d$ of a set of structures $\\{D_1, \\ldots, D_d\\}$ that can be **shattered** by the concept class. A set of structures is shattered if for every subset of these structures, there is a formula in the fragment that is true for exactly those structures in the subset.\n\n### Step 4: Deriving an Upper Bound for the VC Dimension\nLet's analyze the properties of a structure $D$ that our logic can detect. The truth of any sentence $\\phi$ in $D$ depends on which sets of predicates have non-empty intersections. Specifically, for any sentence $\\phi$, its truth in $D$ is determined by the set of all $K$ for which $D \\models C_K$.\n\nLet's consider a special class of structures. For each non-empty subset $K \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, let $D_K$ be a structure with a single element, let's call it $a_K$, whose \"positive type\" is exactly $K$. This means that $a_K$ is in the interpretation of $P_i$ if and only if $i \\in K$. There are $2^4 - 1 = 15$ such distinct structures.\n\nLet's analyze which subsets of this set of 15 structures, $S = \\{D_K \\mid K \\ne \\emptyset\\}$, are definable by our logic.\nA formula is of the form $\\phi_L = \\bigwedge_{L_j \\in L} C_{L_j}$ for a collection of sets $L$. Let's test when $D_K \\models \\phi_L$.\n$D_K \\models C_{L_j} \\iff$ there is an element in $D_K$ satisfying $\\bigwedge_{i \\in L_j} P_i(x)$.\nThe only element is $a_K$. $a_K$ satisfies this condition iff $L_j$ is a subset of the predicates true for $a_K$, which is $K$. So, $L_j \\subseteq K$.\nTherefore, $D_K \\models \\phi_L \\iff \\forall L_j \\in L, L_j \\subseteq K \\iff \\bigcup_{L_j \\in L} L_j \\subseteq K$.\n\nLet $L_{eff} = \\bigcup_{L_j \\in L} L_j$. $L_{eff}$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nAny formula $\\phi$ corresponds to an effective set $L_{eff} \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$, and it defines the subset of $S$ given by $\\{D_K \\in S \\mid L_{eff} \\subseteq K\\}$.\nThe subsets of $S$ we can define are determined by the choice of $L_{eff}$. Since there are $2^4=16$ possible subsets of $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, we can define at most 16 distinct subsets of $S$. These correspond to $L_{eff}$ ranging over all subsets of $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n\nTo shatter a set of size $d$, we must be able to define all $2^d$ of its subsets. If we try to shatter any subset of $S$ of size $d$, we can define at most 16 of its subsets. So, we must have $2^d \\le 16$, which implies $d \\le 4$.\nThis does not prove that the VC dimension is at most 4 for *any* set of structures, but it gives a strong indication that it might be 4. It proves that no set of more than 4 structures *of this particular kind* can be shattered.\n\n### Step 5: Deriving a Lower Bound for the VC Dimension\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must construct a set of 4 structures that can be shattered. Let the number of predicates be $n=4$.\n\nLet $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ be four distinct elements. Define the \"positive type\" of $a_i$ to be $\\{i\\}$, meaning $a_i$ satisfies predicate $P_i$ and no other predicate $P_j$ for $j \\neq i$.\nConstruct the following four structures:\n*   $D_1$: Universe $\\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\}$. Positive types realized: $\\{\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}\\}$.\n*   $D_2$: Universe $\\{a_1, a_2, a_4\\}$. Positive types realized: $\\{\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{4\\}\\}$.\n*   $D_3$: Universe $\\{a_1, a_3, a_4\\}$. Positive types realized: $\\{\\{1\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{4\\}\\}$.\n*   $D_4$: Universe $\\{a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$. Positive types realized: $\\{\\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{4\\}\\}$.\n\nLet $X = \\{D_1, D_2, D_3, D_4\\}$. We will show $X$ can be shattered. A formula $\\phi$ is built from basic sentences $C_K$. As our structures only contain elements with singleton positive types, any $C_K$ where $|K|>1$ will be false in all of them. So we only need to consider $C_{\\{i\\}}$, which we abbreviate as $\\phi_i := \\exists x . P_i(x)$.\n\nA structure $D_j$ models $\\phi_i$ iff it contains an element that satisfies $P_i$, which in our case means iff it contains element $a_i$.\n*   $D_1 \\models \\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_3$.\n*   $D_2 \\models \\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_4$.\n*   $D_3 \\models \\phi_1, \\phi_3, \\phi_4$.\n*   $D_4 \\models \\phi_2, \\phi_3, \\phi_4$.\n\nWe need to show that for any subset of $X$, there is a formula that selects it. By symmetry, we only need to check for subsets of size 0, 1, and 2. The others follow from taking complements (though we don't have negation, the logic for construction will be similar).\n*   **Empty set $\\emptyset$**: The formula $\\phi_1 \\land \\phi_2 \\land \\phi_3 \\land \\phi_4$ is not satisfied by any $D_j$ since none of them contains all four elements.\n*   **Singleton $\\{D_1\\}$**: The formula $\\phi_1 \\land \\phi_2 \\land \\phi_3$ is true for $D_1$. It is false for $D_2$ (lacks $a_3$), for $D_3$ (lacks $a_2$), and for $D_4$ (lacks $a_1$). So this works.\n*   **Pair $\\{D_1, D_2\\}$**: The formula $\\phi_1 \\land \\phi_2$ is true for $D_1$ and $D_2$ as both contain $a_1$ and $a_2$. It is false for $D_3$ (lacks $a_2$) and for $D_4$ (lacks $a_1$). So this works.\nAll other singletons and pairs can be selected by symmetry. For example, to select $\\{D_1,D_3\\}$, we use $\\phi_1 \\land \\phi_3$.\n*   **Size 3, e.g. $\\{D_1, D_2, D_3\\}$**: The formula $\\phi_1$ is true for $D_1, D_2, D_3$ but false for $D_4$. This works.\n*   **Whole set $X$**: The formula $\\top$ works.\n\nSince we can construct formulas to select any subset of $X$, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nThe upper bound argument suggests that the VC dimension is at most 4. The lower bound argument proves that the VC dimension is at least 4. Therefore, the VC dimension is exactly 4. This matches the number of unary predicates in the schema."
