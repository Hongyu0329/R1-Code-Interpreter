    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n    The BCH formula provides an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables (like matrices). The result $Z$ is expressed as an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$.\n    $$ Z(X, Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty Z_n(X, Y) $$\n    Here, $Z_n(X, Y)$ is the sum of all terms of total degree $n$. For example:\n    *   $Z_1 = X + Y$\n    *   $Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$\n    *   $Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] + \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [Y, X]]$\n\n2.  **Relate the BCH expansion to Free Lie Algebras**\n    The terms in the BCH expansion are Lie polynomials. The set of all linear combinations of such terms forms a vector space, which is known as the free Lie algebra generated by $X$ and $Y$, denoted $L(X, Y)$. The terms of a specific degree $n$, like $Z_n$, belong to the $n$-th graded component of this algebra, denoted $L_n(X,Y)$.\n\n    The number of \"nonzero coefficients\" refers to the number of linearly independent Lie polynomials of degree 10. A fundamental result in the theory of Lie algebras (due to Dynkin, Specht, and Wever) states that when $Z_n$ is expressed in terms of a basis for $L_n(X,Y)$ (such as a Hall or Lyndon-Shirshov basis), all the coefficients are non-zero.\n\n    Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the dimension of the vector space $L_{10}(X,Y)$.\n\n3.  **Use Witt's Formula to Find the Dimension**\n    The dimension of the $n$-th graded component of a free Lie algebra on $k$ generators is given by Witt's formula:\n    $$ \\dim(L_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d} $$\n    In our problem:\n    *   The order (degree) is $n=10$.\n    *   The number of generators is $k=2$ (the variables $X$ and $Y$).\n    *   $d$ represents the positive divisors of $n$.\n    *   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n4.  **Apply Witt's Formula for n=10 and k=2**\n    We need to calculate:\n    $$ \\text{Number of coefficients} = \\dim(L_{10}(X,Y)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d} $$\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Find all divisors of n=10.**\n        The divisors of 10 are $d = \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor.**\n        The Möbius function is defined as:\n        - $\\mu(1) = 1$.\n        - $\\mu(d) = (-1)^k$ if $d$ is a product of $k$ distinct primes.\n        - $\\mu(d) = 0$ if $d$ has a squared prime factor.\n\n        For our divisors:\n        - $\\mu(1) = 1$\n        - $\\mu(2) = -1$ (since 2 is a single prime)\n        - $\\mu(5) = -1$ (since 5 is a single prime)\n        - $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\times 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (since 10 is the product of two distinct primes)\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Compute each term in the summation.**\n        The sum is $\\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$.\n        - For $d=1$: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = 1 \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$\n        - For $d=2$: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} = -32$\n        - For $d=5$: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} = -4$\n        - For $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = 1 \\cdot 2^{1} = 2$\n\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Sum the terms and finalize the calculation.**\n        Sum = $1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990$.\n        Now, divide by $n=10$:\n        Dimension = $\\frac{1}{10} \\times 990 = 99$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the BCH expansion is the dimension of the 10th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators. Using Witt's formula with $n=10$ and $k=2$, we have calculated this dimension to be 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
