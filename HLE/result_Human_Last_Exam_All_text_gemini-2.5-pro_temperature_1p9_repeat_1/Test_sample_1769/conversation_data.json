    "This is a hypothetical question rooted in historical linguistics. To answer it, we must trace the development of the native Old English word for \"sister\" and determine how it would have evolved without the influence of Old Norse.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the original words in Old English and Old Norse.**\n*   The current Modern English word \"sister\" derives from the Old English word **sweostor**.\n*   In Old Norse, the language of the Viking invaders, the word was **systir**.\n*   Both words come from the same ancient source, the Proto-Germanic word **\\*swestēr**. This means they are cognates—linguistic cousins.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the specific influence of Old Norse.**\n*   When two very similar words from closely related languages exist side-by-side, one of three things usually happens: one replaces the other, they both survive with different meanings, or they blend together.\n*   In the case of \"sister\", the words blended. The Old Norse form *systir* did not completely replace *sweostor*, but it heavily influenced its pronunciation. The key change was the vowel sound. The /i/ (or /y/) sound in Old Norse *systir* replaced the \"eo\" diphthong in Old English *sweostor*. This linguistic shortcut was common in the Danelaw, where both languages were spoken.\n*   Essentially, the English adopted the simpler, harder-sounding Scandinavian pronunciation of their own word. We see this with other words like \"skirt\" (from Norse *skyrta*) vs. its native English cognate \"shirt\" (from Old English *scyrte*).\n\n**Step 3: Trace the likely evolution of Old English *sweostor* without Norse influence.**\n*   If Old Norse had never influenced the language, *sweostor* would have followed the natural sound change patterns of English.\n*   In Middle English (the period after Old English), *sweostor* was already evolving into forms like **suster** and **swester**. These forms are widely found in texts from areas with less Norse influence, including in the influential works of Chaucer, who often used \"suster\".\n*   The change from *sweostor* to *suster* involves a simplification of the vowel sound and the common dropping of the /w/ sound after an initial /s/ (a change that also happened in words like *so* from Old English *swā*, and *sword* where the 'w' is now silent, from *sweord*).\n\n**Step 4: Use comparative evidence from other related languages.**\n*   We can look at other West Germanic languages that evolved from the same root but were not influenced by Old Norse in the same way.\n    *   In Dutch, the word is **zuster**.\n    *   In German, the word is **Schwester**.\n*   The Dutch form *zuster* is almost identical to the Middle English form *suster*. This provides strong evidence that *suster* represents a natural, non-Norse-influenced evolutionary path for the word.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final form.**\n*   Following the internal sound changes of English and looking at the parallel evolution in a language like Dutch, the Middle English word would have most likely been **suster**.\n*   As English transitioned from Middle to Modern English, this form would have been preserved. The pronunciation would change slightly, but the spelling would remain.\n\nTherefore, if the Norse had never interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **suster**.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
