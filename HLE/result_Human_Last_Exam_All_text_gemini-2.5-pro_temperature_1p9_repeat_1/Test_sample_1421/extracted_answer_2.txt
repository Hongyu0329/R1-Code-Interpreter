The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over Grassmann fields $\psi(\tau)$ and $\bar{\psi}(\tau)$:

$Z = \int_{\text{APBC}} \mathcal{D}[\bar{\psi}, \psi] \, e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$

where:
1.  The integral is a functional integral over all possible paths of the Grassmann fields.
2.  $\mathcal{D}[\bar{\psi}, \psi]$ is the integration measure for the Grassmann fields.
3.  $S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]$ is the Euclidean action, defined as:
    $S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left[ \sum_i \bar{\psi}_i(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi_i(\tau) + H(\bar{\psi}(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right]$
    Here, $H(\bar{\psi}, \psi)$ is the classical Hamiltonian with fermionic operators replaced by their corresponding Grassmann fields, and $\tau$ is the imaginary time.
4.  APBC denotes that the integral is taken over fields that satisfy Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions in imaginary time:
    $\psi_i(\beta) = -\psi_i(0)$
    where $\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature.
