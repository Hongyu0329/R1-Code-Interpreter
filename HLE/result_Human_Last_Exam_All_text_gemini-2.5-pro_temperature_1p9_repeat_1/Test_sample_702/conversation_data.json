    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the spaces and the map.**\n    *   The source space is $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   The target space is $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    *   We use the standard identifications $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$ and $\\Omega S^k * \\Omega S^l \\simeq \\Sigma(\\Omega S^k \\wedge \\Omega S^l)$, where $*$ denotes the join of spaces.\n    *   The map in question, $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, is a well-known map in homotopy theory. The phrasing \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" suggests its construction. Consider the path space fibrations $p_4: PS^4 \\to S^4$ and $p_6: PS^6 \\to S^6$, whose fibers are $\\Omega S^4$ and $\\Omega S^6$ respectively. The spaces $PS^4$ and $PS^6$ are contractible.\n    *   The map $\\phi$ can be constructed from the homotopy fibration associated with the smash product of these maps, $p_4 \\wedge p_6: PS^4 \\wedge PS^6 \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$. Since the total space $PS^4 \\wedge PS^6$ is contractible, the homotopy fiber of $p_4 \\wedge p_6$ is homotopically equivalent to $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. A general theorem on fibers of smash product maps provides a map from the join of the fibers, $\\Omega S^4 * \\Omega S^6$, to the fiber of the smash product map. This constructs the required map $\\phi: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain.**\n    *   **Connectivity of the source space A:**\n        *   The sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected. So its loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected.\n        *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected.\n        *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected.\n        *   For CW complexes $X$ and $Y$ that are $m$- and $n$-connected respectively, their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(m+n+1)$-connected.\n        *   So, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n        *   The suspension $\\Sigma Z$ of an $k$-connected space $Z$ is $(k+1)$-connected.\n        *   Therefore, the source space $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n    *   **Connectivity of the target space B:**\n        *   $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n        *   The sphere $S^{10}$ is $(10-1)=9$-connected.\n        *   The loop space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(9-1)=8$-connected.\n\n3.  **Initial assessment of the map's connectivity.**\n    *   The map $\\phi$ is between two 8-connected spaces.\n    *   The connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced maps on homotopy groups $\\pi_i(f)$ are isomorphisms for $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$.\n    *   Since $\\pi_i(A)=0$ and $\\pi_i(B)=0$ for $i \\leq 8$, the map $\\pi_i(\\phi): 0 \\to 0$ is an isomorphism for $i \\leq 8$.\n    *   This implies that the connectivity of $\\phi$ is at least 9. To determine if it is 9 or higher, we must analyze the map on the first non-trivial homotopy groups, which are in dimension 9.\n\n4.  **Analyze the map on the 9th homotopy groups.**\n    *   We need to compute $\\pi_9(A)$ and $\\pi_9(B)$.\n    *   **For the source A:** By the Freudenthal suspension theorem, the suspension homomorphism $\\pi_k(Z) \\to \\pi_{k+1}(\\Sigma Z)$ is an isomorphism for $k < 2\\text{conn}(Z)+1$. Here $Z = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected. The range is $k < 2(7)+1=15$. Since $k=8 < 15$, we have $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma Z) \\cong \\pi_8(Z)$.\n    *   By the Hurewicz theorem, for a simply connected space $Z$ that is $n$-connected ($n \\ge 2$), $\\pi_{n+1}(Z) \\cong H_{n+1}(Z)$. Since $Z$ is 7-connected, we have $\\pi_8(Z) \\cong H_8(Z)$.\n    *   Using the KÃ¼nneth formula for homology, $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=8} H_p(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_q(\\Omega S^6) \\oplus \\dots$. The lowest degree non-trivial homology group of $\\Omega S^n$ is $H_{n-1}(\\Omega S^n) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. So, the lowest degree term in $H_*(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6)$, which occurs in total degree 8. All other possible summands for $H_8$ are zero. Thus, $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   So, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   **For the target B:** $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The map on the 9th homotopy groups is $\\pi_9(\\phi): \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   A map $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form $n \\mapsto kn$ for some integer $k$. For the connectivity to be 9, this map must be a surjection. A surjective homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$ must be an isomorphism ($k = \\pm 1$).\n    *   Therefore, if the connectivity is 9, it must also be at least 10, because $\\pi_9(\\phi)$ is an isomorphism. This means the connectivity is strictly greater than 9.\n\n5.  **Citing a known result.**\n    *   The connectivity of this specific map has been studied extensively. It is known to be a rational homotopy equivalence, which supports the conclusion that $\\pi_9(\\phi)$ is an isomorphism.\n    *   A precise result is given by S. Theriault in \"The Ganea conjecture for bibasic spaces\" (2007). Theorem 1.3 states that for $m,n \\ge 2$, the map $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\to \\Omega(S^m \\wedge S^n)$ is $(m+n)$-connected.\n    *   This theorem applies directly to our case with $m=4$ and $n=6$.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion.**\n    *   According to the theorem by Theriault, the connectivity of the map $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is $m+n = 4+6 = 10$.\n    *   This means $\\pi_i(\\phi)$ is an isomorphism for $i<10$ and an epimorphism for $i=10$. This is consistent with our finding that $\\pi_9(\\phi)$ is an isomorphism."
