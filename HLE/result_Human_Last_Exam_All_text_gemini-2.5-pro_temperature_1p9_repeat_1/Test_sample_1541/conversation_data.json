    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the most memory-efficient C program and calculate its variable memory usage.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Task**\nThe problem requires us to take a string representing a sum, like \"3+2+1\", and reorder the numbers (summands) in non-decreasing order to produce a new sum string, like \"1+2+3\". The numbers involved are only 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Constraints and Goals**\n1.  **Input:** A string containing digits ('1', '2', '3', '4') and '+' signs. The length is at most 1000 characters.\n2.  **Output:** The rearranged sum, with numbers sorted non-decreasingly and separated by '+'.\n3.  **Primary Goal:** Find the solution that is the *most memory-efficient*. This means using the minimum possible amount of memory for variables.\n4.  **Secondary Goal:** Calculate the total memory (`m`) in bytes used by the variables in this optimal program.\n\n**Step 3: Brainstorm Solution Approaches**\n\n*   **Approach A: Naive Method (High Memory Usage)**\n    1.  Read the entire input string into a character array (e.g., `char s[1001];`).\n    2.  Create an integer array (e.g., `int numbers[501];`).\n    3.  Iterate through the input string, parse the numbers, and store them in the integer array.\n    4.  Sort the integer array using a standard sorting algorithm like `qsort`.\n    5.  Iterate through the sorted integer array and print the numbers, adding a '+' between them.\n    *   *Memory Analysis:* This uses a large character array (~1001 bytes) and a large integer array (~501 * 4 = 2004 bytes). This is not memory-efficient.\n\n*   **Approach B: Counting Sort (Better Memory Usage)**\n    Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we don't need a general-purpose sort. We can just count the occurrences of each number.\n    1.  Read the entire input string into `char s[1001];`.\n    2.  Create a small integer array, `int counts[4] = {0};`, to store the counts of '1's, '2's, '3's, and '4's.\n    3.  Iterate through the input string. When you encounter a digit, increment the corresponding counter (e.g., if you see '3', increment `counts[2]`).\n    4.  Print the result by iterating through the `counts` array. Print `counts[0]` ones, then `counts[1]` twos, etc., adding '+' appropriately.\n    *   *Memory Analysis:* This is much better. It still uses the ~1001 byte input buffer, but replaces the large integer array with a small 16-byte count array.\n\n*   **Approach C: The Most Memory-Efficient Method**\n    We can optimize Approach B further by not storing the input string at all. We can process the input character by character.\n    1.  Declare a small integer array `int counts[4] = {0};` to store counts.\n    2.  Read the input one character at a time in a loop (using `getchar()`).\n    3.  If the character is a digit, increment the appropriate counter in `counts`. If it's '+', ignore it. Continue until you read a newline character (`\\n`) or end-of-file.\n    4.  After the input loop finishes, you have the counts of all numbers.\n    5.  Print the final sum directly from the counts, handling the '+' separators correctly.\n\n**Step 4: Detailing the Most Efficient Algorithm and Calculating Memory (`m`)**\n\nThis approach minimizes memory by avoiding any large arrays to store the input or the parsed numbers. It only requires variables for the counts and loop control.\n\n**Variables Needed:**\n1.  `int counts[4];`: An array to store the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. `counts[0]` for 1s, `counts[1]` for 2s, etc.\n    *   Memory: `4 * sizeof(int)` = `4 * 4` = **16 bytes**.\n2.  `char c;`: A variable to store the single character being read from input via `getchar()`.\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n3.  `int total_count;`: A counter to keep track of the total number of summands. This is crucial for knowing when to print the last number without a trailing '+'.\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n4.  `int i, j;`: Loop variables for iterating through the `counts` array and for printing each number the required number of times.\n    *   Memory: `2 * sizeof(int)` = `2 * 4` = **8 bytes**.\n\n**Printing Logic:**\nTo print the '+' correctly, we can use our `total_count` variable. We print a number, decrement `total_count`, and then print a '+' if `total_count` is still greater than 0.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation (`m`):**\nWe sum the memory used by all the necessary variables. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\nm = (memory for `counts`) + (memory for `c`) + (memory for `total_count`) + (memory for `i` and `j`)\nm = 16 + 1 + 4 + 8\nm = **29 bytes**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Input Reading:** Using `getchar()` is the most memory-efficient way to process input character-by-character without buffering the entire line.\n2.  **Character to Integer Conversion:** When reading a digit character like `'2'`, we can get its corresponding array index by subtracting the character `'1'` (i.e., `'2' - '1' = 1`).\n3.  **Correctly Placing '+':** A common mistake is printing an extra '+' at the end of the line (e.g., \"1+2+3+\"). The logic of decrementing a total counter and checking if it's greater than zero is a robust way to avoid this.\n4.  **Variable Scope:** We assume all variables are declared once within the main function's scope. Declaring variables inside loops (C99 and later) does not change the total memory allocation on the stack for the function's lifetime.\n5.  **Data Type Sizes:** The calculation of `m` relies on `sizeof(int) == 4`. While this is extremely common in competitive programming platforms (32-bit and 64-bit systems), it's technically platform-dependent. However, for this problem, it's the standard assumption.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe most memory-efficient C program uses the character-by-character processing and counting sort method. The total memory required for its variables is the sum of the sizes of `counts[4]`, a character for input, a total count integer, and two loop counter integers.\n\n`m` = 16 (for `counts`) + 1 (for `c`) + 4 (for `total_count`) + 8 (for `i`, `j`) = 29.\n\n<<<29>>>"
