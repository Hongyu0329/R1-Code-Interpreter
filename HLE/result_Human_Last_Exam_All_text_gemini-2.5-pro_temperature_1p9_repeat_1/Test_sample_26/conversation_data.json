    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Object and the Goal**\n\n*   **The object:** $X$ is a smooth quintic hypersurface in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n    *   Being a hypersurface in a 3-dimensional space means $X$ has a complex dimension of $3-1=2$. This makes it a complex surface.\n    *   As a real manifold, its dimension is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(X) = 2 \\times \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 4$.\n    *   Since $X$ is a closed subset of the compact space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, it is a compact manifold.\n    *   As a complex manifold, $X$ is orientable.\n*   **The goal:** We need to find the **rank** of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank of an abelian group is the size of the maximal subset of linearly independent elements, or equivalently, the number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in its free part.\n\n**2. Relate Homotopy Rank to Homology**\n\nThe most direct way to compute the rank of a homotopy group is via the **Rational Hurewicz Theorem**.\n\n*   **Rational Hurewicz Theorem:** For any simply connected space $Y$ (i.e., $\\pi_1(Y) = 0$), the Hurewicz map induces an isomorphism between the rationalized homotopy groups and rational homology groups for all degrees $k \\geq 1$:\n    $$ \\pi_k(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Q}) $$\n*   The dimension of the vector space $\\pi_k(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is precisely the rank of the group $\\pi_k(Y)$. The dimension of the vector space $H_k(Y; \\mathbb{Q})$ is the $k$-th Betti number, $b_k(Y)$.\n*   Therefore, if we can show $X$ is simply connected, we will have:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X) $$\n\n**3. Show that X is Simply Connected**\n\nTo use the Rational Hurewicz Theorem, we must first verify that $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. We use the **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem**.\n\n*   **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem (Homotopy Version):** Let $Y \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$ be a smooth complex submanifold of complex dimension $n-1$. The inclusion map $i: Y \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(Y) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $k < n-1$.\n*   **Applying it to our case:**\n    *   Our space $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, so $n=3$.\n    *   The theorem implies that the inclusion map induces isomorphisms for $k < 3-1=2$.\n    *   For $k=1$, we get an isomorphism $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n*   **The Fundamental Group of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$:** For any $n \\geq 1$, the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is simply connected, i.e., $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^n) = 0$.\n*   **Conclusion:** It follows that $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. Thus, $X$ is simply connected.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The smoothness of $X$ is a critical assumption for this theorem to hold.\n\n**4. Compute the Betti Number $b_3(X)$**\n\nNow that we have established that rank$(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$, the problem is reduced to calculating the third Betti number of $X$. We can use **Poincaré Duality**.\n\n*   **Poincaré Duality:** For any compact, orientable $d$-dimensional manifold $M$, there is an isomorphism between its homology groups: $H_k(M) \\cong H^{d-k}(M)$. This implies that the Betti numbers satisfy $b_k(M) = b_{d-k}(M)$.\n*   **Applying it to our case:**\n    *   As established in Step 1, $X$ is a compact, orientable 4-dimensional manifold ($d=4$).\n    *   Applying Poincaré Duality, we get $b_3(X) = b_{4-3}(X) = b_1(X)$.\n\n**5. Determine $b_1(X)$**\n\nThe final step is to find the first Betti number, $b_1(X)$.\n\n*   The first homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$.\n    $$ H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(X)_{ab} $$\n*   In Step 3, we showed that $\\pi_1(X) = 0$ (the trivial group).\n*   The abelianization of the trivial group is still the trivial group, so $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n*   The first Betti number, $b_1(X)$, is the rank of $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, which is 0.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nWe assemble the pieces of our argument:\n\n1.  $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$ (by Rational Hurewicz, since $X$ is simply connected).\n2.  $b_3(X) = b_1(X)$ (by Poincaré Duality, since $X$ is a compact, orientable 4-manifold).\n3.  $b_1(X) = 0$ (since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, which in turn follows from the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem).\n\nCombining these facts, we find that the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0. This means that the group $\\pi_3(X)$ is a purely torsion group.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   The smoothness of the hypersurface is crucial for applying the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem.\n*   The compactness and orientability of the hypersurface are necessary for applying Poincaré Duality. A complex manifold is always orientable.\n*   The simple connectivity of the space is the key condition for the Rational Hurewicz Theorem to relate the rank of homotopy groups to Betti numbers.\n*   The question asks for the rank, not the full group structure. Our result implies $\\pi_3(X)$ has no free part ($\\mathbb{Z}$ summands), but it does not rule out the existence of a non-trivial torsion part.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
