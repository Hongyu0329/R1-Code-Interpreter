    "This problem asks for the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, denoted as $u^*$, in the $\\phi^4$ theory near four spatial dimensions. This fixed point is known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We will use the Wilsonian Renormalization Group (RG) approach to solve this.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. The Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Action and Dimensionless Coupling**\n\nThe Euclidean action for the scalar $\\phi^4$ theory in $d$ dimensions is given by:\n$S = \\int d^d x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{r_0}{2}\\phi^2 + \\frac{\\lambda_0}{4!}\\phi^4 \\right]$\nwhere $\\lambda_0$ is the bare coupling constant.\n\nFrom dimensional analysis, the kinetic term implies that the field $\\phi$ has mass dimension of $(d-2)/2$. For the action to be dimensionless, the coupling $\\lambda_0$ must have mass dimension of $4-d$.\nIn the context of the $\\epsilon$-expansion, we set $d=4-\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small parameter. The dimension of $\\lambda_0$ is then $\\epsilon$.\nTo work with a dimensionless coupling constant, we introduce a momentum scale, which is naturally the UV cutoff $\\Lambda$ in the Wilsonian approach. We define the dimensionless coupling $u$ as:\n$u = \\lambda_0 \\Lambda^{d-4} = \\lambda_0 \\Lambda^{-\\epsilon}$\n\n**2. The Renormalization Group (RG) Transformation**\n\nThe RG transformation consists of two steps:\na) **Coarse-graining**: Integrate out the \"fast\" modes of the field $\\phi$ with momenta in the shell $\\Lambda/b < |k| < \\Lambda$, where $b > 1$ is a scaling factor. This generates corrections to the parameters of the effective theory for the \"slow\" modes ($|k| < \\Lambda/b$).\nb) **Rescaling**: Rescale momenta, lengths, and fields to restore the original cutoff $\\Lambda$ and the canonical form of the kinetic term.\n\nLet's consider an infinitesimal transformation with $b=e^{dl}$, where $dl \\ll 1$.\n\n**3. The Beta Function**\n\nThe RG flow describes how the dimensionless coupling $u$ changes with the length scale. This is captured by the beta function, $\\beta(u) = \\frac{du}{dl}$. The change in $u$ comes from both the rescaling step and the loop corrections from integration.\n\na) **Tree-level scaling (from rescaling)**: The rescaling of momenta ($k \\to k' = bk$) and fields leads to a change in the coupling constant. The interaction term $\\int d^dx \\frac{\\lambda_0}{4!}\\phi^4$ transforms such that the new coupling is $\\lambda_{new} = \\lambda_{old} b^{4-d} = \\lambda_{old} b^\\epsilon$. This leads to a positive term in the beta function: $\\epsilon u$.\n\nb) **One-loop correction (from integration)**: The primary correction to the four-point vertex at one loop comes from a loop of the fast modes that are being integrated out.\nThe diagrammatic calculation gives the correction to the dimensionful coupling $\\lambda_0$:\n$\\delta\\lambda_0 = - \\frac{3\\lambda_0^2}{2} \\int_{\\Lambda/b < |q| < \\Lambda} \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{(q^2)^2}$\nFor an infinitesimal transformation ($b=e^{dl}$), the momentum shell is $[\\Lambda(1-dl), \\Lambda]$. The integral becomes:\n$\\int_{\\Lambda(1-dl)}^{\\Lambda} \\frac{S_d q^{d-1} dq}{(2\\pi)^d q^4} \\approx \\frac{S_d}{(2\\pi)^d} \\Lambda^{d-5} (\\Lambda dl) = \\frac{S_d \\Lambda^{d-4}}{(2\\pi)^d} dl$\nwhere $S_d = \\frac{2\\pi^{d/2}}{\\Gamma(d/2)}$ is the surface area of a unit $d$-sphere.\nSo, the change in the dimensionful coupling is $\\delta\\lambda_0 = -\\frac{3\\lambda_0^2}{2} \\frac{S_d \\Lambda^{-\\epsilon}}{(2\\pi)^d} dl$.\nThis translates to a change in the dimensionless coupling $u=\\lambda_0\\Lambda^{-\\epsilon}$ by\n$\\delta u_{loop} = \\delta\\lambda_0 \\Lambda^{-\\epsilon} = -\\frac{3(\\lambda_0\\Lambda^{-\\epsilon})^2}{2} \\frac{S_d}{(2\\pi)^d} dl = -C u^2 dl$, with $C = \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{S_d}{(2\\pi)^d}$.\n\nCombining both contributions, the flow equation for the dimensionless coupling $u$ is:\n$\\frac{du}{dl} = \\epsilon u - C u^2$\nThis is the beta function $\\beta(u)$ to one-loop order.\n\n**4. The Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point**\n\nA fixed point $u^*$ is a value of the coupling where the RG flow stops, i.e., $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n$\\epsilon u^* - C (u^*)^2 = 0$\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  $u^* = 0$: The Gaussian fixed point, which is unstable for $\\epsilon > 0$.\n2.  $\\epsilon - C u^* = 0 \\implies u^* = \\frac{\\epsilon}{C}$: The Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which is stable.\n\n**5. Calculation of the Coefficient C**\n\nWe need to evaluate the constant $C$ to leading order in $\\epsilon$. This means we can set $d=4$.\n$C = \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{S_d}{(2\\pi)^d} \\bigg|_{d=4}$\nThe surface area of a 4-dimensional unit sphere is $S_4 = \\frac{2\\pi^{4/2}}{\\Gamma(4/2)} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{\\Gamma(2)} = 2\\pi^2$.\nSo, the constant is:\n$C = \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{2\\pi^2}{(2\\pi)^4} = \\frac{3\\pi^2}{16\\pi^4} = \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2}$\n\n**6. The Final Answer**\n\nSubstituting the value of $C$ into the expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point $u^*$:\n$u^* = \\frac{\\epsilon}{C} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{3 / (16\\pi^2)} = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon$\n\nThis is the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of $\\epsilon=4-d$.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon}$.\n\n<<<16*pi**2/3 * epsilon>>>"
