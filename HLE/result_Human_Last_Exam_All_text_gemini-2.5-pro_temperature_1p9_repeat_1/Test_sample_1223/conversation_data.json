    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Define the terms and the object of study.**\n*   A **metric continuum** is a compact, connected metric space.\n*   An **indecomposable continuum** is one that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   A **hereditary indecomposable continuum** is a continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is a classic example.\n*   A **composant** of a point $p$ in a continuum $K$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$.\n*   The **Stone-Cech compactification** $\\beta Y$ of a Tychonoff space $Y$ is the largest compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   The **Stone-Cech remainder** is the set $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n\nWe are given $X$, a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum, and a point $x \\in X$. We are asked to find the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Let's denote the remainder by $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n\n**2. Determine the topological structure of the remainder $Y^*$.**\nThe key to this problem is to identify the topological properties of the remainder $Y^*$.\nFirst, consider the inclusion map $i: Y \\hookrightarrow X$. Since $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, the universal property of the Stone-Cech compactification guarantees a unique continuous surjective map $f: \\beta Y \\to X$ that extends the inclusion map. The remainder $Y^*$ is precisely the fiber $f^{-1}(x)$. Since preimages of closed sets under continuous maps are closed, and $\\{x\\}$ is closed in $X$, $Y^* = f^{-1}(x)$ is a closed subset of the compact space $\\beta Y$, and thus $Y^*$ is itself a compact Hausdorff space.\n\nA significant theorem by D. P. Bellamy provides more information. It states that for a continuum $K$ and a point $p \\in K$, the remainder $\\beta(K \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (K \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum if and only if $p$ is not a cut point of any subcontinuum of $K$ containing $p$.\n\nLet's check if this condition holds in our case. We have $K=X$ and $p=x$. We need to verify that $x$ is not a cut point of any subcontinuum of $X$ that contains $x$.\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $x$ is a cut point of some subcontinuum $L \\subseteq X$ with $x \\in L$. By definition of a cut point, $L \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is disconnected. So, we can write $L \\setminus \\{x\\} = A \\cup B$, where $A$ and $B$ are non-empty, disjoint, and open in $L \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Let $L_A = \\overline{A}^L = A \\cup \\{x\\}$ and $L_B = \\overline{B}^L = B \\cup \\{x\\}$. Both $L_A$ and $L_B$ are proper subcontinua of $L$, and their union is $L$, i.e., $L = L_A \\cup L_B$.\nHowever, $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum, which means every subcontinuum of $X$ is indecomposable. In particular, $L$ must be indecomposable. An indecomposable continuum cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the assumption that $x$ is a cut point of some subcontinuum containing it must be false. The condition of Bellamy's theorem is satisfied.\nThis proves that the remainder $Y^*$ is an **indecomposable continuum**.\n\n**3. Determine if the remainder $Y^*$ is degenerate.**\nAn indecomposable continuum can be a single point (degenerate) or a more complex space (non-degenerate). The number of composants depends on this.\nThe remainder $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$ is a single point if and only if the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is pseudocompact. (This is because $Y$ is a locally compact, Tychonoff, and realcompact space, and for such spaces, pseudocompactness is equivalent to its one-point compactification and Stone-Cech compactification being homeomorphic).\nA space is pseudocompact if every continuous real-valued function on it is bounded. Let's see if this is true for $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\nSince $X$ is a metric continuum with metric $d$, we can define a function $g: Y \\to \\mathbb{R}$ by the formula $g(y) = 1/d(y, x)$.\nThis function is well-defined and continuous on $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\nSince $X$ is a continuum, it is not a single point, so $x$ cannot be an isolated point. This means there is a sequence of points $\\{y_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ in $Y$ such that $y_n \\to x$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\nFor this sequence, $d(y_n, x) \\to 0$, which implies that $g(y_n) = 1/d(y_n, x) \\to \\infty$.\nThis shows that the function $g$ is unbounded.\nTherefore, the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is not pseudocompact.\nThis implies that its Stone-Cech remainder $Y^*$ is not a single point. So, $Y^*$ is a **non-degenerate indecomposable continuum**.\n\n**4. Calculate the number of composants.**\nA fundamental theorem of continuum theory (due to S. Mazurkiewicz) states that any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has uncountably many ($2^{\\aleph_0}$) pairwise disjoint composants, each of which is dense in the continuum.\nSince we have established that $Y^*$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, it must have $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n\n**5. Final conclusion.**\nThe analysis above holds for *any* hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and *any* point $x \\in X$. In all such cases, the number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of composants is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThe cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$ is also denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum."
