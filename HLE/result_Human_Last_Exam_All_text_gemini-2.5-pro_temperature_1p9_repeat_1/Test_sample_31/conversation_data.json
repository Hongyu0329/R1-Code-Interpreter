    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required to identify any PLL case.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n*   **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer):** The final step in the CFOP method. At this stage, the top layer's orientation is solved (all stickers on the top face are the correct color), but the pieces themselves (4 corners, 4 edges) are not yet in their correct positions.\n*   **Goal:** To determine the minimum number of side stickers one must observe to uniquely identify which of the 21 possible PLL cases is present.\n*   **Non-top-facing stickers:** These are the 12 stickers on the side faces of the top layer pieces (1 sticker for each of the 4 edges, 2 for each of the 4 corners).\n*   **\"Must be seen\":** This implies the worst-case scenario. We need to find the pair of PLL cases that are most similar and determine the minimum number of stickers needed to tell them apart. If we can distinguish the hardest pair, we can distinguish any pair.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Recognition by Features\nSolvers typically recognize PLLs by looking for patterns on the side faces of the cube. Common patterns on a single face (which has 3 stickers from the top layer: corner-edge-corner) include:\n*   **Bar:** All three stickers are the same color (`C-C-C`).\n*   **Headlights:** The two corner stickers are the same color, but the edge is different (`C-X-C`).\n*   **Block:** An adjacent corner and edge sticker are the same color (`C-C-X` or `X-C-C`).\n*   **None (XYZ):** All three stickers are different colors.\n\n### Step 3: Searching for Ambiguity (Hard-to-Distinguish Cases)\n\nWe need to find if looking at a certain number of stickers can lead to ambiguity, where two different PLL cases show the exact same pattern.\n\n*   **Can 1 or 2 stickers be enough?** No. A single sticker's color (e.g., \"red\") or even two stickers (e.g., \"red-green\") can be a part of many different PLL cases. This provides insufficient information to uniquely identify a case.\n\n*   **Can 3 stickers (one full face) be enough?** Let's test this by looking for two different PLLs that can present the exact same 3-sticker pattern on one face, even after rotation (AUF - Adjust Upper Face).\n\n    Let's analyze the **U-perms (Ua and Ub)**. These perms cycle three pieces while leaving the rest of the layer untouched. Depending on the algorithm used, the solved \"bar\" can end up on different faces.\n\n    1.  **Common Case (Bar on the back):** Most standard U-perm algorithms leave a solved bar on the back face.\n        *   **Ua-perm:** Looking at the front face, the pattern is `Color1 - ColorF - Color2`.\n        *   **Ub-perm:** Looking at the front face, the pattern is `Color2 - ColorF - Color1`.\n        In this orientation, the two cases are distinguishable by looking at the 3 stickers on the front face.\n\n    2.  **The Ambiguous Case (Bar on the side):** It is possible to use algorithms or orientations for U-perms that place the solved bar on a side face (e.g., the Right face). Let's analyze the Front face pattern in this scenario.\n        *   **Ua-perm (with bar on Right face):** This permutation cycles the three non-bar edges (UF, UL, UB). The corners on the front face are in their correct positions. The edge piece in the UF slot will be from one of the other positions (e.g., from the UL slot). The resulting sticker pattern on the Front face is `FrontColor - OtherColor - FrontColor`. This is a \"Headlights\" pattern.\n        *   **Ub-perm (with bar on Right face):** This also cycles the three non-bar edges, just in the opposite direction. The corners on the front face are also correct. The UF edge slot also contains a piece from another position. It turns out that this case *also* results in the pattern `FrontColor - OtherColor - FrontColor` on the front face. The specific \"OtherColor\" might be different, but by applying a U2 turn to one of the cases, it's possible to have them match.\n\n    Let's be more specific. Let F=Green, R=Red, L=Orange.\n    *   For Ua (with bar on Right), the Front pattern can be `Green - Orange - Green`.\n    *   For Ub (with bar on Right), the Front pattern can also be `Green - Orange - Green`.\n\n    Therefore, there exists an orientation where **Ua-perm and Ub-perm are indistinguishable when looking only at the 3 stickers of one face.** This means 3 stickers are not sufficient in the worst-case scenario.\n\n### Step 4: Resolving the Ambiguity\nSince looking at 3 stickers on the front face is not enough, we must look at more stickers.\n\n*   **Initial state of knowledge:** We have identified a \"Bar\" on the Right face (`R-R-R`) and \"Headlights\" on the Front face (`G-O-G`). This has cost us a view of 3 stickers, but we are still unsure if it is Ua or Ub.\n*   **The deciding sticker:** We need to look at another sticker to break the tie. A simple one to check is the edge sticker on the Back face (`Sticker(UB, B)`).\n    *   In the **Ua-perm** orientation described, the sticker on the back edge will have one color (e.g., Green, the color of the front face).\n    *   In the **Ub-perm** orientation, the sticker on the back edge will have a different color (e.g., Orange, the color of the left face).\n*   By observing this single additional sticker, we can resolve the ambiguity.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Minimum Number of Stickers\nTo resolve the most difficult case (the ambiguity between Ua and Ub described above), we needed to see:\n1.  The three stickers on the Front face to identify the \"Headlights\" pattern.\n2.  The one differentiating sticker on the Back face's edge piece.\n\nThis amounts to seeing **4 stickers** (`s1`, `s2`, `s3` on the Front, and `s4` on the Back). It is not strictly necessary to see the entire bar on the side, as the Front-face headlight pattern in combination with the back-edge sticker is enough to deduce the case. While other ambiguities exist, none requires more than 4 stickers to resolve. For instance, many difficult pairs like some G-perms can be distinguished by seeing the 3 stickers on one face and 1 on an adjacent face (total 4).\n\nThus, in the worst-case scenario, 4 non-top-facing stickers must be seen to fully identify the PLL case.\n\n<<<4>>>"
