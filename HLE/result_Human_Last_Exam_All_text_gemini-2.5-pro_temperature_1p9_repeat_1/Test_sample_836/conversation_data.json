    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the starting quantity: \"Generalized Pair Correlation Function\"**\n\n*   In physics, a pair correlation function, $g(\\vec{r})$, describes the probability of finding a particle at a position $\\vec{r}$ relative to a reference particle at the origin.\n*   The term \"generalized\" in this context extends this concept to include time. The \"generalized pair correlation function\", which we can denote as $G(\\vec{r}, t)$, describes the correlation between events (in this case, neutron detections or the presence of neutrons) separated by a spatial vector $\\vec{r}$ and a time interval $t$.\n*   In the nuclear criticality community, the \"particles\" are neutrons. So, $G(\\vec{r}, t)$ quantifies how the detection of a neutron at a certain position and time influences the probability of detecting another neutron at a different location and time. This function is fundamental to describing the stochastic fluctuations, or \"noise,\" in a neutron population. It is essentially the space-time autocorrelation function of the neutron flux fluctuations, assuming the system is statistically stationary in time and homogeneous in space.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the operation: \"Space-Time, Double Fourier Transform\"**\n\n*   A Fourier transform is a mathematical tool that decomposes a function into its constituent frequencies.\n*   A \"space-time, double Fourier transform\" means applying this operation to both the spatial variable ($\\vec{r}$) and the temporal variable ($t$) of the function $G(\\vec{r}, t)$.\n*   The spatial Fourier transform converts the position vector $\\vec{r}$ into a wave vector $\\vec{k}$. The wave vector describes spatial frequency or mode shape.\n*   The temporal Fourier transform converts the time variable $t$ into an angular frequency $\\omega$.\n*   The result of this double transform is a new function that depends on wave vector and frequency, let's call it $P(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$. This function describes the same physical phenomenon as $G(\\vec{r}, t)$ but in the frequency-wave vector domain instead of the time-space domain.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the function and the operation using a fundamental principle**\n\n*   The **Wiener-Khinchin Theorem** is a cornerstone of signal processing and statistical mechanics. It states that the power spectral density of a wide-sense-stationary random process is the Fourier transform of its autocorrelation function.\n*   Our problem is a direct application of this theorem. The \"generalized pair correlation function\" of neutron flux is the system's space-time autocorrelation function. Applying a space-time Fourier transform to it will yield the system's power spectral density as a function of both frequency and spatial wave vector.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the common name in the specified community**\n\n*   The result of the transform, $P(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$, represents the density of the fluctuation power (or variance) in the frequency and wave vector domains.\n*   In the nuclear criticality and reactor physics communities, the study of these fluctuations is called **Neutron Noise Analysis**.\n*   The quantity $P(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$ is therefore referred to as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** of the neutron noise.\n*   Because it describes the noise inherent to the neutron population, it is most accurately and commonly called the **Neutron Noise Power Spectral Density**. While often abbreviated to PSD, this full name clarifies that it pertains specifically to neutron fluctuations. Experimental measurements often focus on the purely frequency-dependent version, $P(\\omega)$, by integrating over space or using point detectors, but the full theoretical quantity is the space-and-frequency-dependent function $P(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinguishing from Experimental Quantities:** The theoretical Neutron Noise Power Spectral Density, $P(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$, is a property of the neutron field itself. Experimentally, one measures related quantities like the Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD) from a single detector or the Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD) between two detectors. These experimental measurements are directly predicted by the underlying theoretical $P(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$.\n2.  **Context is Key:** The name for this function is specific to the community. In condensed matter physics, the exact same mathematical entity (Fourier transform of the space-time pair correlation function) is called the **Dynamic Structure Factor**, $S(k, \\omega)$. While there are strong analogies, \"Neutron Noise Power Spectral Density\" is the standard term in nuclear engineering.\n3.  **The \"Noise\" in the Name:** The term \"noise\" is crucial. It refers to the inherent statistical fluctuations in the neutron population due to the probabilistic nature of nuclear processes like fission, scattering, and absorption. The analysis of this \"noise\" provides valuable information about the subcriticality, kinetics, and other physical properties of the system.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe question asks for the name of a specific mathematical entity in a specific field.\n*   Entity: Double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function.\n*   Field: Nuclear criticality community.\n*   Analysis: The Wiener-Khinchin theorem states that the Fourier transform of a correlation function is a power spectral density. Since the correlation function is for the neutron population (\"neutron noise\"), the result is the Neutron Noise Power Spectral Density. This is the standard terminology used in textbooks and papers on nuclear reactor noise analysis.\n\n<<<Neutron Noise Power Spectral Density>>>"
