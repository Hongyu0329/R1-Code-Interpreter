    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The question is about determining a topological property (the Chern number) of a combined system. The key concept here is the additivity of the Chern number, which is a fundamental property of topological invariants in condensed matter physics.\n\n2.  **Define the System Components:**\n    *   We have two individual systems:\n        *   System 1: A Chern insulator with Chern number C₁ = 1.\n        *   System 2: A Chern insulator with Chern number C₂ = 1.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Connection:**\n    *   The two systems are connected \"laterally\", meaning they are placed side-by-side, sharing a common boundary or interface.\n    *   The condition \"negligible tunneling barrier\" is crucial. This means that electrons can move freely between the two materials at the interface. From a topological standpoint, this implies that the two systems merge into a single, larger Hamiltonian system. We are no longer considering two isolated insulators, but one composite system.\n\n4.  **Apply the Additivity Rule of Chern Numbers:**\n    *   For gapped topological systems that are brought into contact, the Chern number of the combined system is simply the sum of the individual Chern numbers of the constituent parts.\n    *   Let C_junction be the Chern number of the combined system.\n    *   The formula is: C_junction = C₁ + C₂.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    *   Substituting the given values: C_junction = 1 + 1.\n    *   Therefore, C_junction = 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** This principle provides a physical intuition that validates the mathematical additivity.\n    *   A system with Chern number C has |C| net chiral edge states at its boundary.\n    *   System 1 (C=1) has one chiral edge state. System 2 (C=1) also has one chiral edge state.\n    *   When placed side-by-side, consider the interface between them. The edge of System 1 at this interface and the edge of System 2 at this interface will host states propagating in *opposite* directions (e.g., one right-mover and one left-mover).\n    *   Because the tunneling barrier is negligible, these two counter-propagating edge states can interact, hybridize, and \"gap out\". This means the internal boundary becomes trivial (gapped and non-conducting).\n    *   However, on the *outer* edges of the combined junction, the edge states from System 1 and System 2 are co-propagating (moving in the same direction). They do not cancel out. Instead, they coexist.\n    *   As a result, the outer boundary of the composite system hosts a total of two chiral edge states.\n    *   According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with two net chiral edge states must have a bulk Chern number of 2. This physical picture confirms the result from the additivity rule.\n\n2.  **Importance of the \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\":** If the barrier were infinite, the two systems would remain isolated. In that case, one could not speak of a single Chern number for the \"junction,\" as they would still be two separate topological systems. The negligible barrier is what allows them to form a single, larger topological phase.\n\n3.  **What if Chern Numbers were Opposite?**: As a point of consideration, if we had C₁ = 1 and C₂ = -1, the total Chern number would be C_junction = 1 + (-1) = 0. In this case, the resulting system would be a topologically trivial insulator.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nBased on the principle of additivity of the Chern number for composite systems:\n*   Chern number of the first insulator, C₁ = 1.\n*   Chern number of the second insulator, C₂ = 1.\n*   Chern number of the junction, C_junction = C₁ + C₂ = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThe Chern number of the junction is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
