    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Physics and Define the System**\n\n*   **System:** A particle confined to a one-dimensional box.\n*   **Box Dimensions:** The box has a length of `a` and extends from `x=0` to `x=a`.\n*   **Quantum State:** The particle is in the `n=2` energy state.\n*   **Objective:** Find the probability of locating the particle in the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Formulas**\n\n*   **Wave Function:** The normalized wave function `ψ_n(x)` for a particle in a 1D box is:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n*   **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is given by the probability density `P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|²`. Since the wave function is real, this is `ψ_n(x)²`.\n    `P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)`\n*   **Probability over an Interval:** The probability of finding the particle between `x₁` and `x₂` is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    `Probability = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx`\n\n**3. Apply the Formulas to the Specific Problem**\n\n*   For `n = 2`, the probability density function is:\n    `P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n*   The probability integral is:\n    `Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n**4. Perform the Integration**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Integration Identity.** To integrate `sin²(θ)`, we use the trigonometric identity: `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ)) / 2`.\n    In our case, `θ = 2πx / a`, so `2θ = 4πx / a`.\n*   Substituting the identity into the integral:\n    `Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * [ (1 - cos(4πx / a)) / 2 ] dx`\n    `Probability = (1/a) * ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx`\n*   Now, we perform the integration:\n    `∫ (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx = x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a)`\n*   Evaluating the definite integral:\n    `Probability = (1/a) * [ x - (a / 4π) * sin(4πx / a) ] |_[from 0.495a to 0.505a]`\n    `Probability = [ x/a - (1 / 4π) * sin(4πx / a) ] |_[from 0.495a to 0.505a]`\n\n**5. Evaluate at the Limits and Simplify**\n\n*   **Upper Limit (`x = 0.505a`):**\n    `0.505a / a - (1 / 4π) * sin(4π * 0.505a / a) = 0.505 - (1 / 4π) * sin(2.02π)`\n*   **Lower Limit (`x = 0.495a`):**\n    `0.495a / a - (1 / 4π) * sin(4π * 0.495a / a) = 0.495 - (1 / 4π) * sin(1.98π)`\n*   Subtracting the lower limit from the upper limit:\n    `Probability = [0.505 - (1/4π)sin(2.02π)] - [0.495 - (1/4π)sin(1.98π)]`\n    `Probability = (0.505 - 0.495) - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]`\n    `Probability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]`\n*   **Careful Point 2: Trigonometric Simplification.** We use the identities `sin(2π + ε) = sin(ε)` and `sin(2π - ε) = -sin(ε)`. Let `ε = 0.02π`.\n    `sin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)`\n    `sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)`\n*   Substituting back into the probability expression:\n    `Probability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]`\n    `Probability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [2sin(0.02π)]`\n    `Probability = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)`\n\n**6. Use Approximation for the Final Calculation**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Approximation for small angles.** The interval is centered on `x=0.5a`, which is a node for `n=2` (`ψ₂(0.5a) = 0`). The probability will be very small. The expression `0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)` involves subtracting two nearly identical numbers. To evaluate it accurately, we must use a Taylor series expansion for `sin(ε)` where `ε = 0.02π`. The expansion is `sin(ε) ≈ ε - ε³/6 + ...`\n*   Substituting the expansion:\n    `Probability ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * [ (0.02π) - (0.02π)³ / 6 ]`\n*   Distribute the `(1/2π)` term:\n    `Probability ≈ 0.01 - [ (0.02π)/(2π) - (1/2π) * (0.02π)³ / 6 ]`\n    `Probability ≈ 0.01 - [ 0.01 - (1/12π) * (0.02π)³ ]`\n*   Simplify the expression:\n    `Probability ≈ 0.01 - 0.01 + (1/12π) * (0.02π)³`\n    `Probability ≈ (1/12π) * (0.000008 * π³)`\n    `Probability ≈ (8 × 10⁻⁶ / 12) * (π³ / π)`\n    `Probability ≈ (2/3) × 10⁻⁶ * π²`\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Numerical Answer**\n\n*   Using `π ≈ 3.14159`, we get `π² ≈ 9.8696`.\n*   `Probability ≈ (2/3) × 9.8696 × 10⁻⁶`\n*   `Probability ≈ 6.5797 × 10⁻⁶`\n*   Rounding to three significant figures, the final answer is `6.58 × 10⁻⁶`.\n\nThe probability that the particle is located in an interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately **`6.58 × 10⁻⁶`** or **`0.00000658`**.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
