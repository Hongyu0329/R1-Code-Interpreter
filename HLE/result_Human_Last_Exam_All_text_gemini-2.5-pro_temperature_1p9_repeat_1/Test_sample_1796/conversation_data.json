    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the target word and sentence:** The question asks for the part of speech of the first word in the sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates.\" The first word is \"Fat\".\n2.  **Analyze the word in its immediate context:** The word \"Fat\" comes directly before the word \"people\". The word \"people\" is a noun, as it refers to a group of persons.\n3.  **Determine the function of the target word:** The word \"Fat\" is describing or modifying the noun \"people\". It tells us what kind of people are being discussed.\n4.  **Recall the definition of parts of speech:**\n    *   A **Verb** expresses an action or a state of being (e.g., run, is, eat).\n    *   A **Noun** is a word for a person, place, thing, or idea (e.g., man, city, book).\n    *   An **Adjective** is a word that modifies or describes a noun or pronoun (e.g., big, red, happy).\n    *   An **Adverb** modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb (e.g., quickly, very, well).\n    *   A **Conjunction** connects words, phrases, or clauses (e.g., and, but, or).\n5.  **Apply the definition to the word in context:** Since \"Fat\" is describing the noun \"people\", it is functioning as an adjective.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   The overall sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is grammatically awkward. A more correct version might be \"The fat that people eat accumulates\" or \"What fat people eat accumulates.\" However, the grammatical error in the later part of the sentence does not change the role of the first word, \"Fat,\" as a descriptor for \"people.\"\n*   The word \"fat\" can be a noun in other sentences (e.g., \"The meat has too much fat.\"). It is crucial to determine its function within the specific sentence provided. In this case, it is not being used as a noun; it is modifying a noun.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the word \"Fat\" is modifying the noun \"people.\" Therefore, its part of speech is an adjective. This corresponds to option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
