    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key components of the question.**\n*   **Source Media:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Event within the episode:** The Junior prom.\n*   **Object in question:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Function of the object:** \"Performs\" as a singer.\n*   **Information to find:** The name of this fictional singer.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the plot of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".**\n*   This episode is the finale of the original Teen Girl Squad series.\n*   The main plot point is the girls (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attending their Junior Prom.\n*   A key scene involves the announcement of the musical entertainment for the prom.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the specific scene with the performance.**\n*   On the prom stage, Cheerleader (acting as emcee) introduces the musical guest.\n*   She announces, \"For your half-hearted listening pleasure, a cardboard cutout of...\"\n*   A cardboard cutout of a female pop star then rises onto the stage.\n*   Cheerleader finishes the introduction by stating the singer's name.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the name of the fictional singer.**\n*   As Cheerleader introduces the cutout, she says the name \"Kassie K\".\n*   The other girls react with excitement, with What's Her Face exclaiming, \"OMG, you guys! It's really her! I mean, a picture of her!\"\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Fictional vs. Real:** The question specifically asks for a *fictional* singer. Kassie K is a character created solely for this gag within the Homestar Runner universe; she is not a real-world artist.\n*   **Spelling:** The name is spelled \"Kassie K\", which is a parody of pop star names from the era.\n*   **The \"Performance\":** The humor comes from the fact that it's an inanimate object \"performing,\" highlighting the low budget and general disappointment of the event.\n\nBy following these steps, we can definitively identify the name of the fictional singer.\n\n<<<Kassie K>>>"
