    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Structure of the Data**\nThe inputs and outputs are strings representing 2D grids of digits. Commas (`,`) are used to separate the rows of the grid. The grids consist of three types of digits: '0', '1', and '2'.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Transformation Pattern**\nBy comparing each input with its corresponding output, we can deduce the rule of transformation.\n*   **In A:** `Input_A` has a `2` at coordinates (row 1, column 1) and a `0` at (row 0, column 0). In `Output_A`, these two values are swapped: the `2` moves to (0,0) and the original position of the `2` becomes a `0`.\n    *   `Input_A`:\n        ```\n        001111\n        121111\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   `Output_A`:\n        ```\n        201111\n        101111\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   Change: The `2` at `(1,1)` swapped with the `0` at `(0,0)`.\n\n*   **In B:** `Input_B` has a `2` at (row 3, column 6) and a `0` at (row 2, column 7). In `Output_B`, these two values are also swapped.\n    *   `Input_B`:\n        ```\n        ...\n        ...1111000011110... // Row 2\n        ...1111002111111... // Row 3\n        ...\n        ```\n    *   `Output_B`:\n        ```\n        ...\n        ...1111000211110... // Row 2\n        ...1111000111111... // Row 3\n        ...\n        ```\n    *   Change: The `2` at `(3,6)` swapped with the `0` at `(2,7)`.\n\nThe core operation is a `2` moving into the location of a `0`, and its original location becoming a `0`. The puzzle is to determine the rule that governs which `0` the `2` moves to.\n\n**Step 3: Deduce the Movement Rule for the '2'**\nLet's analyze the movement of the `2`. We can think of the grid as a physical space where `1`s are walls, `0`s are empty spaces, and `2` is a mobile object.\n*   In example A, the `2` at `(1,1)` moves to `(0,0)`. This is a move one row up and one column to the left (Up-Left).\n*   In example B, the `2` at `(3,6)` moves to `(2,7)`. This is a move one row up and one column to the right (Up-Right).\n\nThis suggests the `2` is a \"bubble\" that tries to move upwards. It appears to have a preferred order of movement. Let the position of the `2` be `(r, c)`. It tries to move to the row above, `r-1`. Let's test a priority order for its move.\n\nConsider the priority: **1st: Up-Right, 2nd: Up-Left, 3rd: Straight-Up**.\n1.  Check the Up-Right position: `(r-1, c+1)`. If it contains a `0`, move there.\n2.  If not, check the Up-Left position: `(r-1, c-1)`. If it contains a `0`, move there.\n3.  If not, check the Straight-Up position: `(r-1, c)`. If it contains a `0`, move there.\n4.  If none of these moves are possible, the `2` stays put.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Rule with the Examples**\n*   **Applying the rule to A:**\n    *   `2` is at `(1,1)`.\n    *   1. Check Up-Right `(0,2)`: The value is `1` (wall). Cannot move.\n    *   2. Check Up-Left `(0,0)`: The value is `0` (empty). **Move here.**\n    *   The `2` moves from `(1,1)` to `(0,0)`. This exactly matches `Output_A`.\n\n*   **Applying the rule to B:**\n    *   `2` is at `(3,6)`.\n    *   1. Check Up-Right `(2,7)`: The value is `0` (empty). **Move here.**\n    *   The `2` moves from `(3,6)` to `(2,7)`. This exactly matches `Output_B`.\n\nThe rule is consistent and explains both provided examples.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Rule to Input_C to Find the Missing Output**\n*   `Input_C`:\n    ```\n    000000  // Row 0\n    011120  // Row 1\n    111111  // Row 2\n    ```\n*   The `2` is at position `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n*   Let's apply the movement rule:\n    1.  Check Up-Right `(r-1, c+1)` which is `(0, 5)`. The value at `(0,5)` is `0`. This is a valid move.\n*   The `2` will move from `(1,4)` to `(0,5)`. The original location `(1,4)` will become a `0`.\n*   The resulting grid will be:\n    *   Row 0: The `0` at index 5 becomes a `2`. New Row 0: `000002`\n    *   Row 1: The `2` at index 4 becomes a `0`. New Row 1: `011100`\n    *   Row 2: Unchanged. New Row 2: `111111`\n*   Combining these rows with commas gives the final output string.\n\nFinal Answer: The value of `MISSING` is `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
