    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which Beatles song fits the description.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\n\nThe question asks for a Beatles song with a very specific opening chord progression. Let's break down the musical theory terms:\n\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It is the chord built on the first note of the scale. In a minor key, it is referred to as the \"i\" chord (e.g., C minor in the key of C minor). In a major key, it is the \"I\" chord (e.g., C major in the key of C major).\n*   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord:** This is the crucial part. It means the fifth chord must be a *minor* chord.\n    *   In a minor key, the chord built on the fifth degree of the natural minor scale is naturally a minor chord (the \"v\" chord). For example, in the key of A minor, the fifth chord is E minor.\n    *   In a major key, the fifth chord is naturally a major chord (the \"V\" chord, or dominant). For example, in C major, the fifth chord is G major. To get a *minor* fifth chord, you would have to borrow it from the parallel minor key, resulting in a I -> v progression (e.g., C major to G minor).\n*   **Starts with a chord jump:** This implies that the transition from the tonic to the minor fifth is one of the very first harmonic movements in the song, happening in the introduction or the first line of the verse.\n\nBased on this, we are looking for a Beatles song that starts with either a **i -> v** progression (in a minor key) or a **I -> v** progression (in a major key). The **i -> v** progression is more common and has a very distinct, moody sound.\n\n### **Step 2: Listing Careful Points for Analysis**\n\nTo find the correct song, we need to be careful about the following:\n\n1.  **Correctly identify the song's key.** Without the correct key, identifying the tonic and fifth chords is impossible.\n2.  **Analyze the very beginning of the song.** The intro or the first few seconds are what matter here, not a progression that appears later in the verse or chorus.\n3.  **Distinguish between a major V chord and a minor v chord.** Many, many songs go from the tonic to the major fifth (I -> V or i -> V). The question specifically asks for the *minor* fifth. For example, \"Let It Be\" goes C -> G (I -> V), which does not fit.\n4.  **Listen to the harmony, not just the melody.** The chords played by the rhythm instruments (guitar, piano) define the progression.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing Beatles' Songs to Find the Match**\n\nLet's examine some candidates, focusing on songs in minor keys or those with unusual harmony.\n\n*   **\"Michelle\"**: This song is in F minor. The tonic chord is Fm (i). The fifth chord would be built on C. A *minor* fifth chord would be C minor (v). The song does feature this chord prominently in the turnaround (\"...my Michelle\" has a Cm -> Fm, or v -> i, progression). However, the song does *not start* with this jump. The intro and the first line (\"Michelle, ma belle\") are built over the tonic Fm chord.\n*   **\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"**: This is in A minor. The tonic is Am (i). The fifth chord is E. A minor fifth would be Em (v). The song's iconic intro progression is Am -> G -> D -> F. This does not contain the i -> v jump at the start.\n*   **\"Eleanor Rigby\"**: This song is in E minor. The tonic is Em (i). The fifth chord would be B minor (v). The song's stark opening alternates between an E minor chord and a C major chord (i -> VI). This is not the progression we are looking for.\n\nNow, let's consider the song **\"Girl\"** from the album *Rubber Soul*.\n\n1.  **Key Identification:** The song is in the key of C minor.\n2.  **Tonic Chord:** The tonic chord (i) is **C minor (Cm)**.\n3.  **Minor Fifth Chord:** The fifth note of the C minor scale is G. The chord built on this note in the natural minor scale is a minor chord, specifically **G minor (Gm)**. This is our target v chord.\n4.  **Opening Progression:** The song starts with a solo acoustic guitar playing the introduction. The very first chord is C minor (Cm). After one measure, the chord changes directly to G minor (Gm). The intro consists of this two-chord pattern (Cm -> Gm) repeated.\n\nThis **Cm -> Gm** progression is a perfect example of a jump from the tonic (i) to the minor fifth (v) at the very start of the song.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nThe song \"Girl\" begins with its key signature chord (the tonic), C minor, and immediately jumps to the minor fifth chord, G minor. This perfectly matches the criteria described in the question.\n\n<<<Girl"
