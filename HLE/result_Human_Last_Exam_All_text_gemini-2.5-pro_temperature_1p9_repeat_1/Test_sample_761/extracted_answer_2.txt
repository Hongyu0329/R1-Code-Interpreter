No. Polynucleotides and polysaccharides are fundamentally different types of macromolecules. The key structural differences are:
1.  **Monomer:** The monomer of a polynucleotide is a nucleotide (sugar + phosphate + base), while the monomer of a polysaccharide is a monosaccharide (a simple sugar).
2.  **Backbone:** A polynucleotide has a sugar-phosphate backbone, whereas a polysaccharide has a backbone made only of linked sugars.
3.  **Bond:** The monomers in a polynucleotide are joined by phosphodiester bonds, while monomers in a polysaccharide are joined by glycosidic bonds.
These differences place them in separate chemical classes: nucleic acids and carbohydrates, respectively.
