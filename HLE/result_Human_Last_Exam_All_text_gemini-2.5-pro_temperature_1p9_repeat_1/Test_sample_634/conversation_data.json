    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Concept of GCRD**\n\nA polynomial matrix `G(s)` is the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` if:\n*   `G(s)` is a common right divisor of both `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`. This means there exist polynomial matrices `Q1(s)` and `Q2(s)` such that `P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s)` and `P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s)`.\n*   Any other common right divisor `D(s)` of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` is also a right divisor of `G(s)`. This means there exists a polynomial matrix `L(s)` such that `G(s) = L(s)D(s)`.\n\nThe GCRD is not unique. If `G(s)` is a GCRD, then any matrix `U(s)G(s)` is also a GCRD, where `U(s)` is a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant).\n\n**2. State the Matrices**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `P1(s) = [ s^2 + s,  -s     ;\n               -s^2 - 1, s^2    ]`\n*   `P2(s) = [ s,       0      ;\n               -s - 1,  1      ]`\n\n**3. Set up the Euclidean Algorithm**\n\nTo find the GCRD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This involves performing elementary row operations on a composite matrix `M(s)` formed by stacking `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`.\n\n`M(s) = [ P1(s) ; P2(s) ] = [ s^2 + s,  -s     ;  (R1)\n                            -s^2 - 1, s^2    ;  (R2)\n                            s,       0      ;  (R3)\n                            -s - 1,  1      ]`  (R4)\n\nThe elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\nOur goal is to reduce `M(s)` to the form `[ G(s) ; 0 ]`, where `G(s)` is a 2x2 matrix and `0` is the 2x2 zero matrix. The resulting `G(s)` will be a GCRD.\n\n**4. Perform Row Reduction**\n\nIt is generally easier to use rows with lower polynomial degrees to eliminate rows with higher degrees. Rows R3 and R4 have lower degrees than R1 and R2.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Perform arithmetic with polynomials carefully to avoid errors.\n\n*   **Operation 1:** Add R3 to R4 to simplify R4.\n    `R4_new = R4 + R3 = [-s - 1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-1, 1]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    `[ s^2 + s,  -s     ;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2    ;\n      s,       0      ;\n      -1,      1      ]` (R4_new)\n\n*   **Operation 2:** Use the new R4 (which is `[-1, 1]`) to eliminate the first column entries of the other rows.\n    *   `R1_new = R1 + (s^2 + s) * R4_new = [s^2 + s, -s] + (s^2 + s)[-1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s^2 + s] = [0, s^2]`\n    *   `R2_new = R2 + (-s^2 - 1) * R4_new = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - (s^2 + 1)[-1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2 + 1, s^2 - s^2 - 1] = [0, -1]`\n    *   `R3_new = R3 + s * R4_new = [s, 0] + s[-1, 1] = [s - s, s] = [0, s]`\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Keep track of which rows have been replaced. After these operations, the system of rows is equivalent to:\n    `[ 0,  s^2  ; (R1_new)\n      0,  -1   ; (R2_new)\n      0,  s    ; (R3_new)\n     -1,  1    ]` (R4_new)\n\n*   **Operation 3:** We now have a very simple row, `[0, -1]` (R2_new). We can use this to eliminate the second column entries in R1_new and R3_new.\n    *   `R1_final = R1_new + s^2 * R2_new = [0, s^2] + s^2[0, -1] = [0, s^2 - s^2] = [0, 0]`\n    *   `R3_final = R3_new + s * R2_new = [0, s] + s[0, -1] = [0, s - s] = [0, 0]`\n\n*   **Final Result of Reduction:** After these operations, two rows become zero. We are left with two non-zero rows, which form our GCRD. The order of rows can be changed as it is an elementary operation.\n    The remaining independent non-zero rows are `[-1, 1]` and `[0, -1]`.\n\n**5. Extract the GCRD**\n\nWe assemble the remaining non-zero rows into a 2x2 matrix. This matrix is a GCRD.\n`G_raw(s) = [ -1, 1 ;\n             0, -1 ]`\n\n**6. Normalize the GCRD (Optional but Recommended)**\n\nIt is standard practice to present the GCRD in a canonical form, such as the row Hermite form. We can achieve this by ensuring the leading non-zero element of each row (the pivot) is 1.\n\n*   Multiply the first row by -1: `R1' = -1 * [-1, 1] = [1, -1]`\n*   Multiply the second row by -1: `R2' = -1 * [0, -1] = [0, 1]`\n\nThis gives the normalized GCRD:\n`G(s) = [ 1, -1 ;\n         0,  1 ]`\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This normalized matrix `G(s)` is a GCRD because it was obtained from `G_raw(s)` by left-multiplying with the unimodular matrix `U = [-1, 0; 0, -1]`.\n\n**7. Verification (Optional)**\n\nWe can verify the result by checking if `P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s)` and `P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s)` for some polynomial matrices `Q1` and `Q2`. This is equivalent to checking if `Q1 = P1 * G^-1` and `Q2 = P2 * G^-1` are polynomial matrices.\n\nFirst, find `G(s)^-1`:\n`det(G(s)) = (1)(1) - (-1)(0) = 1`\n`G(s)^-1 = (1/1) * [1, 1; 0, 1] = [1, 1; 0, 1]`\n\nNow, compute the products:\n*   `Q1(s) = P1(s) * G(s)^-1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2] * [1, 1; 0, 1] = [s^2 + s, s^2; -s^2 - 1, -1]`\n*   `Q2(s) = P2(s) * G(s)^-1 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1] * [1, 1; 0, 1] = [s, s; -s - 1, -s]`\n\nSince both `Q1(s)` and `Q2(s)` are polynomial matrices, our calculated `G(s)` is indeed a common right divisor. Because it was found using the Euclidean algorithm, it is a greatest common right divisor.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the 2x2 matrix `G(s)` derived above.\n\n```\n<<<[1, -1;\n   0, 1]>>>\n```"
