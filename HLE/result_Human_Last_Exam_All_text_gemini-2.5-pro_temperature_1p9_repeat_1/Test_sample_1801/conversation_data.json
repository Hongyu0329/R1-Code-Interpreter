    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What:** A commercial for a specific company.\n    *   **Who:** Enron.\n    *   **When:** The year 2000.\n    *   **Key Feature:** The tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n    *   **Subjects:** The question asks for two specific individuals who were featured.\n    *   **Qualifier:** Both individuals must be Nobel laureates.\n\n2.  **Identify the Advertising Campaign:**\n    Enron's \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major corporate image-building effort launched in 2000. The goal was to portray Enron not just as an energy company, but as a revolutionary \"new economy\" corporation, an innovator, and a market-maker. The commercials were high-concept and featured prominent thinkers.\n\n3.  **Identify the Individuals:**\n    Research into this specific, well-known ad campaign reveals that two highly prominent economists were featured in separate spots under the \"Ask Why\" banner. Their names are:\n    *   **Paul Krugman**\n    *   **Myron Scholes**\n\n4.  **Verify Their Nobel Laureate Status (A Careful Point):**\n    This is the most crucial part of the analysis, as the timing is important. The question asks for two \"Nobel laureates.\"\n    *   **Myron Scholes:** He, along with Robert C. Merton, was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1997** for developing a new method to determine the value of derivatives (the famous Black-Scholes formula). Therefore, at the time the commercial aired in 2000, he was already a Nobel laureate.\n    *   **Paul Krugman:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008** for his work on New Trade Theory and New Economic Geography. This means that in 2000, when he appeared in the Enron commercial, he was a very distinguished and influential economist but was **not yet** a Nobel laureate.\n\n5.  **Reconcile the Nuance with the Question:**\n    The question refers to them as \"two Nobel laureates.\" This is how they are almost always described in retrospective articles and discussions about this infamous commercial, as both men eventually held the title. The ad's notoriety grew immensely after Enron's fraudulent collapse in 2001 and was further amplified when Krugman won his Nobel in 2008, adding another layer of irony to his appearance. Therefore, while technically only one was a laureate at the time, the correct answer in the common understanding of the question includes both men, as both now hold the prize.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe two individuals featured in the 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" campaign who are Nobel laureates are Myron Scholes (who won in 1997) and Paul Krugman (who would later win in 2008).\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
