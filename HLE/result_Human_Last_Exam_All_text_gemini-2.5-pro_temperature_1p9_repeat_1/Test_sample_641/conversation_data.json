    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand Involutions in PSU(n, q^2)**\n*   The group is the Projective Special Unitary group, `PSU(n, q^2) = SU(n, q^2) / Z(SU(n, q^2))`, where `Z` is the center of the Special Unitary group `SU(n, q^2)`.\n*   An involution in a group is a non-identity element `g` such that `g^2 = 1`.\n*   Let `g = A * Z` be an element of `PSU(n, q^2)`, where `A` is a matrix in `SU(n, q^2)`. For `g` to be an involution, we must have `(A * Z)^2 = A^2 * Z` equal to the identity element in PSU, which is `Z` itself.\n*   This means `A^2` must be an element of the center `Z`. So, we need to count the number of elements `A \\in SU(4, 997^2)` such that `A^2 \\in Z(SU(4, 997^2))` and `A \\notin Z(SU(4, 997^2))`.\n\n**2. Determine the Center of SU(4, 997^2)**\n*   The group in question is `PSU(4, 997)`, which is standard notation for `PSU(4, 997^2)`. So we have `n=4` and `q=997`. The characteristic `p=997` is odd.\n*   The center `Z(SU(n, q^2))` consists of scalar matrices `λI` such that `λ^n = 1` and `λ^{q+1} = 1`. Its order is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n*   In our case, `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\n*   Since `998 = 2 * 499` and `4 = 2^2`, the greatest common divisor is `gcd(2^2, 2 * 499) = 2`.\n*   So, the center `Z` has order 2. The elements of order 2 in `GF(997^2)` are `1` and `-1`. The center is `Z = {I, -I}`.\n\n**3. Find Projective Involutions in SU(4, 997^2)**\n*   We are looking for matrices `A \\in SU(4, 997^2)` such that `A^2 = I` or `A^2 = -I`, and `A \\neq I, -I`.\n*   **Case a: `A^2 = -I`**. Let `μ` be an eigenvalue of `A`. Then `μ^2 = -1`. Since `A` is a unitary matrix, its eigenvalues must satisfy the condition `μ^{q+1} = 1`.\n    *   Here `q+1 = 998`. So we need `μ^998 = 1`.\n    *   However, if `μ^2 = -1`, then `μ^998 = (μ^2)^499 = (-1)^499 = -1`.\n    *   This leads to the contradiction `-1 = 1`, which is false as the field characteristic is not 2.\n    *   Therefore, there are no solutions to `A^2 = -I` in `U(4, 997^2)`, and thus no solutions in `SU(4, 997^2)`.\n*   **Case b: `A^2 = I`**. These are the involutions within the group `SU(4, 997^2)`. The elements we seek are the non-central involutions.\n\n**4. Count Non-Central Involutions in SU(4, 997^2)**\n*   An involution `A` is diagonalizable, and its eigenvalues must be `+1` or `-1`.\n*   Since `A \\in SU(4, 997^2)`, we must have `det(A) = 1`. If `k` is the number of `-1` eigenvalues, then `det(A) = (-1)^k = 1`, which means `k` must be even.\n*   The dimension of the space is `n=4`.\n    *   If `k=0`, eigenvalues are `{1,1,1,1}`, so `A=I` (central).\n    *   If `k=2`, eigenvalues are `{1,1,-1,-1}`. This gives `det(A)=1`. `A` is not `I` or `-I`, so it's a non-central involution.\n    *   If `k=4`, eigenvalues are `{-1,-1,-1,-1}`, so `A=-I` (central).\n*   Thus, we need to count the number of matrices `A` in `SU(4, 997^2)` with eigenvalues `{1,1,-1,-1}`. These form a single conjugacy class.\n\n**5. Use the Centralizer Method to Count**\n*   The number of such involutions is given by the size of the conjugacy class: `|SU(4, q^2)| / |C_{SU(4, q^2)}(A)|`, where `A` is a representative of the class.\n*   We can choose a diagonal representative `A = diag(1, 1, -1, -1)`, which is unitary with respect to the standard identity hermitian form.\n*   The centralizer of `A` in `SU(4, q^2)` consists of block-diagonal matrices `B = diag(B_1, B_2)` where `B_1, B_2` are 2x2 matrices.\n*   For `B` to be in `SU(4, q^2)`, `B_1` and `B_2` must be in `U(2, q^2)`, and `det(B) = det(B_1)det(B_2) = 1`.\n*   The size of this centralizer is `|C_{SU(4, q^2)}(A)| = |SU(2, q^2)|^2 * (q+1)`.\n*   The orders of the groups are given by the formulas:\n    *   `|SU(n, q^2)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} * Π_{i=2 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`\n    *   `|SU(4, q^2)| = q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n    *   `|SU(2, q^2)| = q(q^2-1)`\n*   `|C_{SU(4, q^2)}(A)| = (q(q^2-1))^2 (q+1) = q^2(q^2-1)^2(q+1)`.\n*   The number of non-central involutions in `SU(4, q^2)` is:\n    `N_{SU,inv} = |SU(4, q^2)| / |C| = [q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q^2(q^2-1)^2(q+1)]`\n    `N_{SU,inv} = q^4 * [(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [(q^2-1)(q+1)]`\n    `N_{SU,inv} = q^4 * [(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)] / [(q^2-1)(q+1)]`\n    `N_{SU,inv} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`\n\n**6. Final Count for PSU(4, 997^2)**\n*   The set of projective involutions in `SU` is the set `S` of non-central involutions, of size `N_{SU,inv}`.\n*   The map from `SU` to `PSU` sends `A` to `A*Z`.\n*   `A*Z = B*Z` if and only if `B = A*z` for some `z` in the center `Z={I, -I}`. So `B=A` or `B=-A`.\n*   If `A` is a non-central involution, then so is `-A`, and `A \\neq -A`.\n*   Therefore, each pair of involutions `{A, -A}` in `SU` corresponds to a single involution `A*Z` in `PSU`.\n*   The number of involutions in `PSU(4, q^2)` is `N_{PSU,inv} = N_{SU,inv} / |Z| = N_{SU,inv} / 2`.\n*   `N_{PSU,inv} = (1/2) * q^4 (q^2+1) (q^2-q+1)`\n\n**7. Calculation for q=997**\n*   Substitute `q = 997` into the formula:\n    `N = (1/2) * 997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1)`\n*   `997^2 = 994,009`\n*   `997^4 = (994,009)^2 = 988,053,848,081`\n*   `997^2 + 1 = 994,010`\n*   `997^2 - 997 + 1 = 994,009 - 997 + 1 = 993,013`\n*   `N = (1/2) * 988,053,848,081 * 994,010 * 993,013`\n*   `N = 988,053,848,081 * 497,005 * 993,013`\n*   `N = 491,079,815,033,405,005 * 993,013`\n*   `N = 487,652,787,836,371,813,083,665`\n\n<<<487652787836371813083665>>>"
