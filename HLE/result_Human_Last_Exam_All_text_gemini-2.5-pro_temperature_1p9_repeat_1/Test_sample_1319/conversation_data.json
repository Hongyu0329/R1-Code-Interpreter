    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question requires us to identify a specific geographical feature based on four criteria:\n*   It must be a **historical mountain** (a real geographical place).\n*   It must be **mentioned in the text of the *Iliad***.\n*   It must be the **tallest** among the mountains that fit the criteria.\n*   It must **not be Mount Olympus**.\n\n**2. Identify Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\nFirst, we must compile a list of all named mountains that appear in Homer's epic. Mount Olympus is the most famous, serving as the home of the gods, and is the benchmark for height.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, frequently mentioned throughout the epic. Its highest peak is Mytikas. (Elevation: ~2,918 m / 9,573 ft). This mountain is excluded by the question.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This is the second most prominent mountain in the epic's narrative. Zeus often observes the Trojan War from its summit, Gargarus. It is crucial to distinguish this from the taller Mount Ida on Crete; the *Iliad* refers to the one near Troy in the region of the Troad. (Highest peak elevation: ~1,774 m / 5,820 ft).\n*   **Mount Athos:** This mountain is mentioned during Hera's journey from Olympus to Lemnos in Book 14. She leaps \"from the peak of Athos\" over the sea. (Elevation: ~2,033 m / 6,670 ft).\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned in relation to the Centaurs and as the source of the wood for Achilles's mighty ash spear, a gift from his father Peleus. It is located in Thessaly, Greece. (Elevation: ~1,624 m / 5,328 ft).\n*   **The Mountain of Samothrace (Mount Fengari/Saos):** In Book 13, Poseidon sits atop the highest peak of \"wooded Samothrace\" to get a clear view of the battlefield at Troy and Mount Ida. (Elevation: ~1,611 m / 5,285 ft).\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** This mountain is mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2). The Maeonians (later Lydians), led by Antiphos and Mesthles, are described as having been \"born in the land of Tmolus.\" (Highest peak of the Bozdağlar range, the ancient Tmolus: ~2,159 m / 7,083 ft).\n\n**3. Compare the Elevations of the Mentioned Mountains**\nNow, we arrange the identified mountains (excluding Olympus) in descending order of their modern recorded elevations.\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus** (modern Bozdağlar range): **~2,159 m (7,083 ft)**\n2.  **Mount Athos**: **~2,033 m (6,670 ft)**\n3.  **Mount Ida** (in the Troad): **~1,774 m (5,820 ft)**\n4.  **Mount Pelion**: **~1,624 m (5,328 ft)**\n5.  **Mountain of Samothrace** (Mount Fengari): **~1,611 m (5,285 ft)**\n\n**4. Conclude the Answer**\nBased on this comparison, Mount Tmolus is the tallest among the historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, after Mount Olympus itself.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **\"Mentioned\" vs. \"Narratively Important\":** The question asks for the tallest mountain that is *mentioned*, not the one that is most important to the story. While Mount Ida is far more central to the plot than Mount Tmolus, it is significantly shorter.\n*   **Identifying the Correct \"Mount Ida\":** It is essential to correctly identify the *Iliad's* Mount Ida as the one in the Troad (modern Turkey), not the taller Mount Ida located on Crete which is more central to myths about Zeus's birth.\n*   **Relying on Modern Elevation Data:** The analysis relies on precise modern geographical data, which provides an objective measure for \"tallest.\"\n*   **Checking the Text:** The inclusion of Mount Tmolus is confirmed by its explicit mention in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2, line 866 in most translations), which solidifies its position on our list.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
