No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect that requires the material to have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure (a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾` susceptibility). The common, stable polymorphs of ideal borophene are centrosymmetric, which forbids this process.
