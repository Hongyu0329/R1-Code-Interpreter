    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Phenomenon - Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\n\n*   **Definition:** SPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In SPDC, a high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) from an incident light beam passes through a suitable nonlinear medium and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons).\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The process must obey the laws of conservation of energy (`E_pump = E_signal + E_idler`) and conservation of momentum.\n*   **Material Requirement:** For SPDC to occur, the material must exhibit a second-order nonlinear optical response. This is quantified by the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as `χ⁽²⁾`. If `χ⁽²⁾` is zero, SPDC cannot occur.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Material Requirement to Crystal Symmetry**\n\n*   **The Role of Inversion Symmetry:** A fundamental principle in nonlinear optics states that for a material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (`χ⁽²⁾`), it must lack a center of inversion symmetry. Such materials are called non-centrosymmetric.\n*   **Centrosymmetric Materials:** In materials that are centrosymmetric (possessing inversion symmetry), applying an electric field `E` results in a polarization response `P` that must be an odd function of `E` (`P(-E) = -P(E)`). The second-order nonlinear response relates polarization to the square of the electric field (`P⁽²⁾ ∝ χ⁽²⁾E²`), which is an even function. To satisfy the symmetry requirement, the proportionality constant, `χ⁽²⁾`, must be zero for centrosymmetric materials.\n*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, SPDC, being a `χ⁽²⁾` process, is forbidden in materials with inversion symmetry.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Material in Question - Free-standing Boron Nanosheets**\n\n*   **Definition:** Boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are two-dimensional (2D) single-atom-thick sheets of boron atoms. \"Free-standing\" implies they are not supported by a substrate.\n*   **Crystal Structure:** Borophene can exist in several different atomic arrangements, called polymorphs. The most commonly studied and theoretically stable free-standing structures are the β₁₂ and χ₃ polymorphs.\n*   **Symmetry of Borophene:** The ideal, perfectly flat structures of these common borophene polymorphs (β₁₂ and χ₃) are centrosymmetric. They possess a center of inversion.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Analysis to Answer the Question**\n\n*   Based on the principles outlined above, since the ideal crystal structure of free-standing boron nanosheets is centrosymmetric, their second-order nonlinear susceptibility `χ⁽²⁾` should be zero.\n*   As SPDC is a `χ⁽²⁾` process, it is fundamentally forbidden in an ideal, perfectly structured boron nanosheet.\n*   Therefore, from a fundamental material property standpoint, free-standing boron nanosheets would **not** be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real Structures:** The conclusion above is based on the *ideal*, perfectly flat structure of borophene. Real-world free-standing 2D materials are never perfectly flat. They possess ripples, buckling, structural defects, vacancies, and edges.\n2.  **Symmetry Breaking:** These imperfections can break the local inversion symmetry of the material. For instance, a buckle or a defect does not have the same symmetry as the perfect lattice.\n3.  **Possibility of a Weak Signal:** This breaking of symmetry could potentially induce a small, non-zero local `χ⁽²⁾`. This might allow for a very weak SPDC signal to be generated from these specific symmetry-broken regions. However, this would not be an intrinsic property of the material's \"bulk\" 2D lattice, and the signal would likely be extremely weak and difficult to distinguish from other noise and competing nonlinear effects.\n4.  **Dominant Nonlinear Effects:** In centrosymmetric materials like ideal borophene, the third-order nonlinear susceptibility (`χ⁽³⁾`) is non-zero. This allows for processes like third-harmonic generation and four-wave mixing. These third-order effects would be the dominant nonlinear optical response and would be far more probable than any weak SPDC arising from imperfections.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWhen asked if a material is \"expected\" to exhibit a property, the answer is typically based on the intrinsic properties of its ideal crystal structure. The ideal structures of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric. A centrosymmetric material has zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (`χ⁽²⁾`), which is a necessary condition for SPDC. Therefore, boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit this phenomenon. While real-world imperfections could theoretically induce a weak effect, it is not the primary or expected behavior of the material.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect that requires the material to have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure (a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾` susceptibility). The common, stable polymorphs of ideal borophene are centrosymmetric, which forbids this process.>>>"
