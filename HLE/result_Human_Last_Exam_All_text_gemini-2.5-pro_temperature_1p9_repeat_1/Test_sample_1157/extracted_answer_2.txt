**Systemic Management:** The first and most critical step is an urgent referral to a physician to manage her uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%) with medication and counseling.
**Emergency Dental Care:** Procedures include antibiotic prescription to prevent infection due to the 28-hour delay, pain management, and gentle debridement and suturing of the traumatic wound.
**Definitive Treatment:** After systemic control and healing, the most appropriate treatment is a **Cobalt-Chrome cast metal Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**. A fixed bridge is contraindicated due to the long span and weak anterior abutment, and implants are high-risk due to her diabetes.
**Cells of Interest:** Key cells are **neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts**, whose functions in fighting infection and healing tissue are all impaired by uncontrolled diabetes.
**RPD Abutments:** The abutment teeth for the RPD should be the **Left Second Premolar (#25)** and the **Right First Molar (#16)**. This provides cross-arch stabilization, distributing forces across strong posterior teeth and avoiding damaging the weaker left central incisor, which is crucial given her Class III skeletal occlusion (SNB 88‚Å∞).
