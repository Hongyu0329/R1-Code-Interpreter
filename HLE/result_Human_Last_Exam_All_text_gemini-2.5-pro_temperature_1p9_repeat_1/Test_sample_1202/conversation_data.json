    "This question asks to identify the most likely mechanism responsible for keeping two copies of a gene after a duplication event and allowing them to diverge in sequence and/or function. Let's analyze each option step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the starting point: Gene Duplication.**\nGene duplication creates two identical copies of a gene. Initially, one copy is redundant because the other copy is still performing the original function. Without selective pressure to maintain it, the redundant copy is likely to accumulate random mutations.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the possible fates of the duplicate gene.**\n*   **Loss:** The most common fate is that the redundant copy accumulates deleterious mutations that render it non-functional. This non-functional copy is called a pseudogene. This process is known as **pseudogenization**.\n*   **Retention:** For both copies to be kept in the genome over evolutionary time, there must be a selective advantage to having both. The question is about the mechanisms that lead to this retention and subsequent divergence.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate each answer choice as a mechanism for retention and divergence.**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicate genes, it tends to make the two copies more similar or identical. Therefore, gene conversion actively works *against* divergence and is not a mechanism for retaining two *different* genes.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one of the duplicate genes becomes non-functional. While it involves divergence (the pseudogene's sequence will diverge from the functional gene), it does not result in the *retention* of two functional genes. It's the most common fate, representing a failure to retain the duplicate in a functional state.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original ancestral function, while the second copy is free from selective pressure and accumulates mutations. Occasionally, one of these mutations will give rise to a completely new, beneficial function. Natural selection will then preserve this second copy. This is a valid mechanism for both retention and divergence, as it results in two functional but different genes.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also called the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (e.g., it was active in multiple tissues). After duplication, each copy can accumulate mutations that inactivate *different* sub-functions. For example, one copy might lose the ability to function in the liver, while the other loses the ability to function in the brain. Now, both copies are required to perform the full range of the original gene's functions. They complement each other, and there is selective pressure to retain both. This is also a valid mechanism for both retention and divergence.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a lineage into many new species that fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a *molecular mechanism* for retaining individual duplicate genes within a genome. It describes a pattern at the species level, not the gene level.\n\n**Step 4: Compare Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization to determine the \"most likely\" mechanism.**\nBoth C and D are accepted models for the retention of duplicate genes. However, there's a key difference in their probability.\n*   **Neofunctionalization** requires a *gain-of-function* mutation, which is a rare event. The duplicate gene must survive the period of relaxed selection (where it's at high risk of becoming a pseudogene) long enough for such a rare beneficial mutation to occur.\n*   **Subfunctionalization** is driven by *loss-of-function* mutations in different parts of the gene's original function. Such degenerative mutations are much more common than beneficial gain-of-function mutations. This provides a more immediate and common pathway for preserving both copies, as each becomes essential by losing a complementary part of the original function.\n\nBecause it relies on more frequent mutational events (loss of sub-function), subfunctionalization is considered by many evolutionary biologists to be a more likely and common mechanism for the *initial* retention of duplicate genes, rescuing them from the fate of pseudogenization. Neofunctionalization can still occur later, but subfunctionalization provides a more probable first step for preservation. Therefore, it is arguably the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
