    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI calculation of the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)\nFirst, we identify the atoms in the molecule and sum their atomic numbers to find the total number of electrons.\n-   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n-   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron per atom. There are 2 H atoms, so $2 \\times 1 = 2$ electrons.\n-   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n-   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons (N) = 6 (C) + 2 (H) + 14 (Si) + 9 (F) = 31 electrons.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the spin state (S)\nThe total number of electrons is 31, which is an odd number. Molecules with an odd number of electrons are open-shell radicals. The ground state will have the minimum possible total spin, which corresponds to a single unpaired electron.\n-   Total spin (S) = 1/2\n-   The spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2(1/2) + 1 = 2$. This is a doublet state.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the total number of basis functions (K)\nThe number of basis functions (which corresponds to the number of spatial orbitals, K) is determined by the chosen basis set, 6-31G**. This notation is equivalent to 6-31G(d,p), which means:\n-   Heavy atoms (non-hydrogen) are described by the 6-31G basis plus a set of d-type polarization functions.\n-   Hydrogen atoms are described by the 6-31G basis plus a set of p-type polarization functions.\n-   By convention, we use 5 spherical d-functions and 3 p-functions for polarization.\n\nLet's calculate the number of basis functions for each atom:\n-   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    -   The 6-31G basis splits the 1s valence orbital into two functions (1s' and 1s''). This gives 2 basis functions.\n    -   The `(p)` polarization adds one set of p-functions (px, py, pz), which is 3 basis functions.\n    -   Total for one H atom = 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n\n-   **Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (2nd-row atoms):**\n    -   The 6-31G basis provides 9 functions ([3s, 2p] contracted functions): 1 function for the 1s core, and a split valence of 2s(s',s''), 2p(p',p''), resulting in 1+2+2*3=9 incorrect logic. The standard count is: 1 function for 1s core + 2 functions for 2s valence + 2x3 functions for 2p valence = 9 functions.\n    -   The `(d)` polarization adds one set of spherical d-functions, which is 5 basis functions.\n    -   Total for C or F atom = 9 + 5 = 14 basis functions.\n\n-   **Silicon (Si) (3rd-row atom):**\n    -   For a third-row atom, the 6-31G basis provides 13 functions ([4s, 3p] contracted functions).\n    -   The `(d)` polarization adds one set of spherical d-functions, which is 5 basis functions.\n    -   Total for Si atom = 13 + 5 = 18 basis functions.\n\nNow, we sum the basis functions for all atoms in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$:\n-   K = (1 x K_C) + (2 x K_H) + (1 x K_Si) + (1 x K_F)\n-   K = 14 + (2 x 5) + 18 + 14\n-   K = 14 + 10 + 18 + 14 = 56 basis functions.\n\nSo, the number of spatial orbitals is K = 56.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the number of CSFs\nThe number of CSFs for a system with N electrons, K spatial orbitals, and a total spin S is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula:\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{2S+1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N/2 - S} \\binom{K+1}{N/2 + S + 1}$\n\nWe plug in the values we found:\n-   N = 31\n-   K = 56\n-   S = 1/2\n\nFirst, let's calculate the terms in the formula:\n-   $2S+1 = 2(1/2) + 1 = 2$\n-   $K+1 = 56 + 1 = 57$\n-   $N/2 - S = 31/2 - 1/2 = 15.5 - 0.5 = 15$\n-   $N/2 + S + 1 = 31/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 15.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 17$\n\nNow substitute these into the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{2}{57} \\binom{57}{15} \\binom{57}{17}$\n\nWe need to compute the binomial coefficients:\n-   $\\binom{57}{15} = \\frac{57!}{15!(57-15)!} = \\frac{57!}{15!42!} = 24,550,742,581,600$\n-   $\\binom{57}{17} = \\frac{57!}{17!(57-17)!} = \\frac{57!}{17!40!} = 987,679,803,126,400$\n\nNow, multiply these values:\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{2}{57} \\times (2.45507425816 \\times 10^{13}) \\times (9.876798031264 \\times 10^{14})$\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{2}{57} \\times (2.4249103980153835 \\times 10^{28})$\n$N_{CSF} = 8.507199965182168... \\times 10^{26}$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the number of CSFs is $8.507 \\times 10^{26}$.\n\nFinal answer in scientific E notation:\n$8.507 \\times 10^{26}$\n\n<<<8.507e+26>>>"
