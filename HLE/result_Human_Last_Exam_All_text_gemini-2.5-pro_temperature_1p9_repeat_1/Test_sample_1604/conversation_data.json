    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\nThe question asks to identify the historical battle that occurred at the latest date among all the battles painted by the artist Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler. The key is to focus on the date of the battle itself, not the date the painting was created.\n\n### Step 2: List Major Battle Paintings by Lady Butler and their Historical Dates\nWe need to create a list of Lady Butler's significant works that depict specific historical battles and find the date each battle took place.\n\n1.  ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (Painted in 1875)\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** Battle of Quatre Bras\n    *   **Historical Date:** June 16, **1815**\n\n2.  ***Scotland for Ever!*** (Painted in 1881)\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** Battle of Waterloo\n    *   **Historical Date:** June 18, **1815**\n\n3.  ***Remnants of an Army*** (Painted in 1879)\n    *   **Event Depicted:** The end of the 1842 retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n    *   **Historical Date:** January **1842**\n\n4.  ***The Roll Call*** (Painted in 1874) and ***Balaclava*** (Painted in 1876)\n    *   **Conflict Depicted:** Crimean War. *The Roll Call* is generally associated with the Battle of Inkerman or the general Siege of Sevastopol, while *Balaclava* depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade.\n    *   **Historical Dates:** Battle of Balaclava: October 25, **1854**; Battle of Inkerman: November 5, **1854**.\n\n5.  ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (Painted in 1880)\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** Battle of Rorke's Drift\n    *   **Historical Date:** January 22â€“23, **1879**\n\n6.  ***Floreat Etona!*** (Painted in 1882)\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** Battle of Laing's Nek (during the First Boer War).\n    *   **Historical Date:** January 28, **1881**\n\n7.  ***The Battle of Tel-el-Kebir*** (Painted in 1885)\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** Battle of Tel-el-Kebir (during the Anglo-Egyptian War).\n    *   **Historical Date:** September 13, **1882**\n\n8.  ***The Camel Corps*** (Painted in 1893)\n    *   **Event Depicted:** The Gordon Relief Expedition during the Mahdist War.\n    *   **Historical Date:** Late **1884** to early **1885**\n\n9.  ***Charge of the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, Battle of Mons*** (Painted post-1914)\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** Battle of Mons (during World War I).\n    *   **Historical Date:** August 23, **1914**\n\n10. ***A patrol of the 15th Hussars captured during the battle of the Aisne, September 1914*** (Painted post-1914)\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** First Battle of the Aisne (during World War I).\n    *   **Historical Date:** September **1914**\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Historical Dates\nNow, let's list the dates of the events in chronological order to find the latest one.\n\n*   1815 (Battle of Waterloo / Quatre Bras)\n*   1842 (Retreat from Kabul)\n*   1854 (Crimean War Battles)\n*   1879 (Battle of Rorke's Drift)\n*   1881 (Battle of Laing's Nek)\n*   1882 (Battle of Tel-el-Kebir)\n*   1884-1885 (Gordon Relief Expedition)\n*   August 1914 (Battle of Mons)\n*   September 1914 (First Battle of the Aisne)\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Latest Battle\nComparing the dates, the battles from World War I in 1914 are the latest historical events depicted by Lady Butler. Between the Battle of Mons (August 1914) and the First Battle of the Aisne (September 1914), the Battle of the Aisne is the latest.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   The analysis correctly distinguishes between the painting's creation date and the historical event's date.\n*   The list includes a representative sample of her works, including her later paintings of World War I, which are crucial for finding the correct answer.\n*   Specific dates are used where possible (e.g., distinguishing between August and September 1914) to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the First Battle of the Aisne.\n\n<<<First Battle of the Aisne>>>"
