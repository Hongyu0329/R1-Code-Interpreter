    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral**\n\nThe problem asks us to evaluate the definite integral `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\nThe integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is a specific form. Let `u = F₃(x)`. Then `du = F₃'(x) dx`.\nThe integral becomes `∫ (1/u) du`, which is `ln|u| + C`.\nSo, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n\nTo evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n`∫ (from a to b) f(x) dx = G(b) - G(a)`, where `G'(x) = f(x)`.\nIn our case, `f(x) = F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`, `G(x) = ln|F₃(x)|`, `a=0`, and `b=1`.\nSo, `V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1.\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 3: Define the function F₃(x)**\n\nWe are given a sequence of functions:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate F₃(0)**\n\nWe substitute `x = 0` into the expression for `F₃(x)`:\n*   `sin(0) = 0`\n*   `e^(sin(0)) = e^0 = 1`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(1)**\n\nWe substitute `x = 1` into the expression for `F₃(x)`. Note that the argument of the sine function is in radians.\n*   `sin(1)`\n*   `e^(sin(1))`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the Expression for V**\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` back into our formula for `V`.\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)| = ln|ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))| - ln|ln(2)|`\n\n*   **Careful Point: Check the signs.** We need to determine if `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` are positive to remove the absolute value signs.\n    *   `ln(2) ≈ 0.693 > 0`, so `|ln(2)| = ln(2)`.\n    *   For `x=1` (radian), `sin(1)` is positive (`1` radian is approx `57.3°`).\n    *   `e^(sin(1)) > e^0 = 1`.\n    *   `1 + e^(sin(1)) > 2`.\n    *   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) > ln(2) > 0`.\n    *   Therefore, `F₃(1)` is also positive, and we can remove the absolute value sign.\n\nThe expression simplifies to:\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we get:\n`V = ln[ ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) ]`\n\n**Step 7: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe need to compute the value of V using a calculator.\n1.  `sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098`\n2.  `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.31978716`\n3.  `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 1 + 2.31978716 = 3.31978716`\n4.  `F₃(1) = ln(3.31978716) ≈ 1.2000003`\n5.  `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718`\n6.  `V = ln[ 1.2000003 / 0.69314718 ] = ln[1.731274]`\n7.  `V ≈ 0.548839`\n\n**Step 8: Final Value Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n*   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548839 = 5488.39`\nThe closest integer to `5488.39` is `5488`, since the decimal part (0.39) is less than 0.5."
