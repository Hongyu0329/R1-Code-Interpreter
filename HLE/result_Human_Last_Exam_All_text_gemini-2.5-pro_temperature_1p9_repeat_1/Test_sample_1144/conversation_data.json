    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n**Objective:** The goal is to determine the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum (Δp) to the momentum (p) of an electron in the first Bohr orbit. This can be expressed as the fraction Δp / p.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   The particle is an electron.\n*   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit (n=1).\n*   The uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx) is 10 pm.\n\n**Key Physical Principles and Constants:**\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and momentum (Δp). The mathematical relation is Δx ⋅ Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. For calculating the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality: Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx).\n2.  **Bohr's Model of the Atom:** This model describes the momentum of an electron in a quantized orbit. The angular momentum (L) is given by L = p ⋅ r = nħ, where p is the linear momentum, r is the orbital radius, and n is the principal quantum number.\n3.  **Necessary Constants:**\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Bohr radius (a₀), which is the radius of the first orbit (n=1), a₀ ≈ 5.29 × 10⁻¹¹ m\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp).**\n\n*   We start with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to find the minimum possible uncertainty in momentum.\n    *   Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n*   First, convert the given uncertainty in position from picometers (pm) to meters (m).\n    *   Δx = 10 pm = 10 × 10⁻¹² m = 1 × 10⁻¹¹ m.\n*   Now, substitute the values of ħ and Δx into the equation.\n    *   Δp = (1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 × 1 × 10⁻¹¹ m)\n    *   Δp = 5.27 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the momentum (p) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.**\n\n*   According to the Bohr model, the momentum (p) of an electron in an orbit is given by the relation p = nħ / r.\n*   For the first Bohr orbit, the principal quantum number is n=1, and the radius (r) is the Bohr radius (a₀).\n    *   n = 1\n    *   r = a₀ ≈ 5.29 × 10⁻¹¹ m\n*   Substitute these values into the momentum formula.\n    *   p = (1 × 1.054 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (5.29 × 10⁻¹¹ m)\n    *   p ≈ 1.992 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum (Δp / p).**\n\n*   Now we take the values calculated in the previous two steps and find their ratio.\n    *   Δp ≈ 5.27 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n    *   p ≈ 1.992 × 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n*   Calculate the ratio:\n    *   Ratio = Δp / p = (5.27 × 10⁻²⁴) / (1.992 × 10⁻²⁴)\n    *   Ratio ≈ 2.645\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the ratio is 2.65.\n\n*   **Alternative check:**\n    We can derive a symbolic relationship first:\n    *   Δp / p = [ħ / (2Δx)] / [ħ / a₀]\n    *   Δp / p = (ħ / 2Δx) * (a₀ / ħ)\n    *   Δp / p = a₀ / (2Δx)\n    *   Plugging in the values: Δp / p = (5.29 × 10⁻¹¹ m) / (2 × 1 × 10⁻¹¹ m) = 5.29 / 2 = 2.645.\n    This confirms our step-by-step numerical calculation.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
