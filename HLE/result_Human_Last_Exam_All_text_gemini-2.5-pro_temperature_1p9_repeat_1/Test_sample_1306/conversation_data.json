    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Algebra and its Representations**\n\nThe question is about the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. We can choose $q = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$.\n\nThe algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is generated by $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ with certain relations. The representation theory of this algebra drastically changes when $q$ is a root of unity compared to the generic case (where $q$ is not a root of unity).\n\nWhen $q$ is a root of unity, the representation theory is not semisimple. This means that there exist representations that are indecomposable but not irreducible. An irreducible representation has no proper non-trivial subrepresentations. An indecomposable representation cannot be written as a direct sum of two non-trivial subrepresentations. Every irreducible representation is indecomposable, but the converse is not always true.\n\nLet $e$ be the smallest positive integer such that $q^{2e}=1$. Since $q=e^{2\\pi i / 3}$, we have $q^2 = e^{4\\pi i / 3}$. The order of $q^2$ is 3. Thus, $e=3$. This value $e=3$ is crucial for the structure of the representations.\n\n**Step 2: Interpreting the Category C**\n\nThe question asks for a percentage, which implies we are comparing the sizes of two sets, presumably finite. The category of all finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ actually contains infinite families of indecomposable modules (it is of \"tame\" representation type). If we consider all of them, the number of irreducibles is finite while the number of indecomposables is infinite, leading to a percentage of 0.\n\nHowever, a standard interpretation in this context is to consider the representations of the **small quantum group**, sometimes denoted $u_q$. This is the finite-dimensional Hopf algebra generated by $E,F,K$ with the additional relations $E^e=0, F^e=0, K^e=1$. For $e=3$, this algebra is known to be of **finite representation type**, meaning it has only a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. This is the only context where the question makes sense with a non-zero finite answer. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Classifying the Irreducible Representations**\n\nThe irreducible (or simple) representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ a primitive third root of unity ($e=3$) are the highest weight modules $L(k)$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, e-1$.\n\nFor $e=3$, the irreducible modules are:\n1.  $L(0)$: The trivial representation, dimension 1.\n2.  $L(1)$: A 2-dimensional representation.\n3.  $L(2)$: A 3-dimensional representation, also known as the Steinberg module.\n\nSo, there are a total of **3** non-isomorphic irreducible representations.\n\n**Step 4: Classifying All Indecomposable Representations**\n\nTo find all indecomposable representations, we use the block decomposition of the category of modules. The modules are partitioned into \"blocks\". For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with $e=3$, the category decomposes into two blocks.\n\n*   **Block 1 (The Principal Block):**\n    This block contains the simple modules $L(0)$ and $L(1)$. For $e=3$, this block is of finite type, and its Auslander-Reiten quiver has the shape of a Dynkin diagram of type $A_3$. This means it contains 6 non-isomorphic indecomposable modules. Let's list them:\n    1.  $L(0)$: The simple module of dimension 1. (Irreducible)\n    2.  $L(1)$: The simple module of dimension 2. (Irreducible)\n    3.  $P(0)$: The projective cover of $L(0)$. It has dimension 4 and its Loewy series is $L(0) | L(1) | L(0)$. (Reducible)\n    4.  $P(1)$: The projective cover of $L(1)$. It has dimension 5 and its Loewy series is $L(1) | L(0) | L(1)$. (Reducible)\n    5.  $M_1 = \\mathrm{rad}(P(0))$: This module has dimension 3 and its Loewy series is $L(1) | L(0)$. (Reducible)\n    6.  $M_2 = \\mathrm{rad}(P(1))$: This module has dimension 3 and its Loewy series is $L(0) | L(1)$. (Reducible)\n\n    In this block, there are 2 irreducibles and 6 indecomposables in total.\n\n*   **Block 2:**\n    This block contains the simple module $L(2)$. The module $L(2)$ is special because it is also projective. A block containing a simple projective module is itself simple, meaning it contains only one indecomposable object, which is that simple projective module itself.\n    1.  $L(2)$: This is the only indecomposable module in this block. It is also irreducible.\n\n    In this block, there is 1 irreducible and 1 indecomposable in total.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Final Percentage**\n\nNow we combine the counts from all blocks to get the total numbers for the category C.\n\n*   **Total number of irreducible objects in C:**\n    This is the sum of irreducible objects from each block.\n    Total Irreducibles = (Irreducibles in Block 1) + (Irreducibles in Block 2) = 2 + 1 = **3**.\n\n*   **Total number of indecomposable objects in C:**\n    This is the sum of indecomposable objects from each block.\n    Total Indecomposables = (Indecomposables in Block 1) + (Indecomposables in Block 2) = 6 + 1 = **7**.\n\nThe percentage of objects of C that are irreducible is the ratio of these two numbers, multiplied by 100.\n\nPercentage = (Total Irreducibles / Total Indecomposables) * 100%\nPercentage = (3 / 7) * 100%\nPercentage â‰ˆ 42.857%\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Root of Unity:** The condition that $q$ is a primitive third root of unity is the most critical piece of information. It makes the representation theory non-semisimple.\n2.  **Irreducible vs. Indecomposable:** Understanding the distinction is key. All irreducibles are indecomposable, but the reverse is not true in this non-semisimple setting.\n3.  **Finiteness of C:** The question implicitly assumes that the category C has a finite number of objects up to isomorphism. This directs the analysis towards the representation theory of the *small quantum group* $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, which for $e=3$ has finite representation type.\n4.  **Block Decomposition:** The classification of indecomposable modules is managed by separating them into blocks. For $e=3$, there are two blocks to consider.\n5.  **The Steinberg Module:** The module $L(e-1) = L(2)$ is special. It is simple, projective, and injective, and it forms a block by itself. This is a common feature in the modular representation theory of related algebraic structures.\n6.  **Counting:** The final step is a careful tally of the modules in each category (irreducible and indecomposable) across all blocks.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   The set of irreducible representations (up to isomorphism) is $\\{L(0), L(1), L(2)\\}$. The size of this set is 3.\n*   The set of indecomposable representations (up to isomorphism) is $\\{L(0), L(1), L(2), P(0), P(1), M_1, M_2\\}$. The size of this set is 7.\n*   The percentage is $\\frac{3}{7} \\times 100$.\n\n$3 \\div 7 \\approx 0.4285714...$\n\nAs a percentage, this is approximately 42.857%.\n\n<<<42.857142857142854>>>"
