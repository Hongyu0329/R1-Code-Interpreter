    "This is an excellent question that touches on the fundamental data point for Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis. Let's break it down.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Premise:** The question states, \"HRV is computed as a value between heartbeats.\" This is a slight simplification. HRV isn't one value found between two heartbeats. Instead, HRV is a set of metrics that measure the *variation* in the time *across a series* of many consecutive heartbeats. The core data point used for this calculation is indeed the time interval *between* each beat.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Measurement:** The \"value between heartbeats\" is a measure of time. Specifically, it is the duration from the peak of one heartbeat wave to the peak of the very next one.\n\n3.  **Introduce the Correct Terminology:** This time duration has a specific name. The most common and general term for this value is the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**. It is also frequently called the **Beat-to-Beat Interval (BBI)**.\n\n4.  **Consider the Measurement Technology (ECG vs. PPG):**\n    *   **ECG (Electrocardiogram):** This is the clinical gold standard. An ECG signal has a distinct pattern called the QRS complex, with the \"R\" wave being the most prominent peak. The time between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** This technology, used in most wearables, detects blood volume changes. The time between consecutive peaks of the PPG pulse wave is technically called a **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI)**.\n    *   **Connection:** In practice, the PPI measured by PPG is used as an estimate of the R-R interval. Therefore, even when data comes from a PPG sensor, the resulting time measurement is very commonly referred to simply as the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\n5.  **Introduce a Refined Term for HRV Calculation:** For a meaningful HRV analysis, it's important to only consider variability from the heart's natural pacemaker. Irregular beats caused by arrhythmias (like premature contractions) or sensor errors (artifacts) should be excluded. The process of filtering these out leads to a refined set of intervals. The time between two consecutive *normal* heartbeats is called a **Normal-to-Normal (NN) Interval**. Most HRV metrics (like RMSSD, SDNN) are calculated from a series of these NN intervals.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **HRV is not the interval itself:** HRV is the *variability of the intervals*. For example, if you have a series of IBIs like 800ms, 820ms, 795ms, 815ms, the HRV metrics would quantify how much these values jump around. A single IBI of 800ms is just a time measurement.\n*   **IBI vs. NN Interval:** IBI is the general term for any beat-to-beat interval. NN Interval is the specific term for an interval confirmed to be between two normal sinus rhythm beats, making it the clean data used for HRV calculations.\n*   **PPG vs. ECG:** While PPG is convenient, it can be less accurate than ECG, especially during movement, which can introduce errors (motion artifacts) into the IBI measurement.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe value measured between heartbeats, which serves as the raw data for all HRV computations, is most accurately and commonly called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\n<<<Inter-beat Interval (IBI)>>>"
