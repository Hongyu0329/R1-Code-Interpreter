    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the \"Second Great War\"\nThe first and most critical step is to define the start and end points of the conflict known as the Second Great War. In StarCraft lore, this war is not a single declared event but rather the overarching term for the series of conflicts depicted in the *StarCraft II* trilogy.\n\n*   **Start Point:** The war begins with the resurgence of the Zerg Swarm and their full-scale invasion of the Terran Dominion. This is the opening event of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign.\n*   **End Point:** The war concludes with the final defeat of the ultimate antagonist, the dark god Amon, by the combined forces of the Terran, Zerg, and Protoss. This happens in the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*, which follows *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void*. The very final scene of the epilogue, set \"two years later,\" is a post-war coda and does not count as part of the war's duration itself.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing the Timeline in Years\nAccording to the official StarCraft lore and timeline:\n\n*   The events of *Wings of Liberty* begin in the year **2504**. This is explicitly stated as being four years after the end of the Brood War (which ended in 2500).\n*   The events of *Heart of the Swarm* follow shortly after, taking place primarily in the year **2505**.\n*   The main campaign of *Legacy of the Void* and its concluding epilogue, *Into the Void*, take place in the year **2506**.\n\nSo, the war started in 2504 and ended in 2506.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Exact Duration and Identifying Careful Points\nNow we must calculate the duration based on the start and end years.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The war does not start on January 1, 2504, and end on December 31, 2506.** The exact start and end dates (day and month) are not specified in the lore. The conflict simply begins *during* 2504 and ends *during* 2506.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Estimating Elapsed Time.** The conflict spans across three separate calendar years. Each of the three main campaigns (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, *Legacy of the Void*) involves significant interstellar travel, resource mobilization, and multiple battles, suggesting that each campaign took several months to unfold. When adding the time gaps between campaigns, the total elapsed time is almost certainly greater than two full years. For example, a plausible timeline might be the war starting in mid-2504 and ending in the latter half of 2506, resulting in a duration of roughly 2.5 years.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Applying the Rounding Rule.** The question specifically asks for the duration in years, **\"rounded up\"**. This means we must use the ceiling function.\n    *   If the duration were exactly 2.0 years, rounding up would result in 2.\n    *   If the duration were anything greater than 2.0 years (e.g., 2.1 years, 2 years and a day), rounding up would result in 3.\n\n### Step 4: Acquiring the Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, the war's duration is greater than 2 years but less than 3 years.\n\n1.  Start Year: 2504\n2.  End Year: 2506\n3.  Estimated Duration: Greater than 2 years (e.g., ~2.5 years).\n4.  Applying the \"rounded up\" rule to a value that is greater than 2 results in 3.\n\nTherefore, the Second Great War in StarCraft lore lasted for 3 years when rounded up.\n\n<<<3>>>"
