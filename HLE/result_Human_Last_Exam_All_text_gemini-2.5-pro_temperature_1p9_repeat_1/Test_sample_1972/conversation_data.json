    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\nThe question asks to identify a specific novel based on two key pieces of information from a review by Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  A metaphorical description of the novel: It possesses \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  A description of the author: He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the First Clue - \"Continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\"\n*   **William Faulkner:** An American writer renowned for his complex narrative structures, non-linear timelines, stream-of-consciousness technique, and creation of the fictional Yoknapatawpha County, which served as the setting for many of his novels. His work is thematically dense, often dealing with the decay of the American South.\n*   **\"Continuator of Faulkner\":** This suggests an author who was deeply influenced by Faulkner, likely adopting similar themes (e.g., family sagas, the weight of history, a mythic sense of place) or stylistic approaches. Many authors of the 20th-century Latin American \"Boom\" were heavily influenced by Faulkner.\n*   **\"(and simplifier)\":** This is the crucial part. The author in question takes Faulkner's notoriously difficult and convoluted style and makes it more accessible. They retain the thematic depth and structural ambition but present it with clearer, more direct prose, moving away from Faulkner's dense, parenthetical sentences and interior monologues. This points strongly toward Gabriel García Márquez, who famously said that reading Faulkner made him want to be a writer. García Márquez's Macondo is widely seen as a Latin American parallel to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha, but his narrative voice in his most famous work is more declarative and fable-like, a \"simplification\" of Faulkner's complex psychological modernism.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Second Clue - \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"\n*   **\"the intensity of a tiger\":** This metaphor suggests a work of immense power, passion, and raw narrative force. It implies a story full of dramatic, violent, and epic events that seize the reader's attention.\n*   **\"the variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This suggests that beneath the raw intensity, the novel has an intricate, intellectual, and carefully planned structure. A chess game involves strategy, a limited set of pieces moving in complex combinations, and a sense of predetermined rules leading to a vast number of possibilities. This points to a novel with a complex plot, a large cast of characters whose lives interlock in a fated, almost mathematical way, and a structure that is both varied and rigidly organized.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Novel\nWhen we combine these two analyses, they point overwhelmingly to one masterpiece of Latin American literature:\n*   The author, a **\"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner,\"** is almost certainly Gabriel García Márquez.\n*   The novel that fits the **\"tiger/chess\"** description is his epic, *One Hundred Years of Solitude* (*Cien años de soledad*).\n    *   **Intensity of a tiger:** The novel is filled with civil wars, incestuous passions, plagues of insomnia, massacres, and biblical floods. It has an untamed, epic energy.\n    *   **Variety of a chess duel:** The novel is meticulously structured around the Buendía family. The recurring names (Aureliano, José Arcadio), cyclical patterns of behavior, and the overarching sense of a predetermined fate controlled by Melquíades's prophecies give the sprawling story the intricate, logical feel of a complex game unfolding over a century.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe quotes are from a short review Borges wrote in 1967 for the Argentine magazine *Hogar*. He was praising the newly published novel by a fellow author, capturing both its untamed, magical energy and its sophisticated, almost deterministic structure, while also perfectly situating its author's relationship to his great North American predecessor.\n\n<<<One Hundred Years of Solitude>>>"
