    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the type of differential equation\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1) x^2 $$\nThis is a first-order non-linear ordinary differential equation. We can see that all terms involving $x$ can be grouped together, and all terms involving $t$ can be grouped together. This means the equation is **separable**.\n\n### Step 2: Separate the variables\nTo separate the variables, we move all terms with $x$ to the left side and all terms with $t$ to the right side.\nWe can divide both sides by $x^2$.\n\n**Careful Point:** We must consider if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If we substitute $x(t)=0$ into the equation, we get $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is $0=0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant (or equilibrium) solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the particular solution we are looking for is not the zero solution, and we can safely divide by $x^2$.\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n\n### Step 3: Integrate both sides of the equation\nNow we integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables.\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   **Left-hand side:**\n    $$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x} $$\n*   **Right-hand side:**\n    $$ \\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t $$\n\nAfter integration, we combine the constants of integration into a single constant, $C$, on the right side.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n### Step 4: Use the initial condition to find the constant C\nThe initial condition is given as $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our integrated equation to solve for $C$.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n### Step 5: Write the particular solution\nNow that we have the value of $C$, we can write the equation for the particular solution that satisfies the initial condition.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n### Step 6: Find the value of x(1)\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We need to substitute $t=1$ into the equation from Step 5. We don't need to explicitly solve for $x(t)$ first, we can just solve for $x$ after plugging in $t=1$.\nSubstitute $t=1$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo combine the fractions on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nNow, we can solve for $x(1)$. Multiply both sides by $-1$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, take the reciprocal of both sides to find $x(1)$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1. The equation was correctly identified as separable.\n2. The separation of variables was done correctly, considering the case $x=0$.\n3. The integration of both sides was performed correctly.\n4. The constant of integration $C$ was found using the initial condition.\n5. The value of $x(1)$ was calculated by substituting $t=1$ into the particular solution. The arithmetic is correct.\n\nThe process is sound and the calculation is verified.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
