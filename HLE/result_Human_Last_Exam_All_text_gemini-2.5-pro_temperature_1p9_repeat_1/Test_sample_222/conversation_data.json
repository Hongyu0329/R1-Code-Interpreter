    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the question and understand the goal\nThe question asks for the **4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** of an **8-point sequence**. Let's denote the 8-point sequence as y(n).\n*   The sequence is constructed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, x(n) and h(n):\n    y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}\n*   We are given the 4-point DFTs of x(n) and h(n), which are X(k) and H(k) respectively.\n    X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]\n    H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]\n*   We need to compute Z(k), the 4-point DFT of the 8-point sequence y(n).\n\n### Step 2: Define the N-point DFT for a sequence of different length L\nThe N-point DFT of an L-point sequence y(n) is defined as:\n`Z(k) = sum_{n=0 to L-1} y(n) * e^(-j*2*pi*nk/N)` for k = 0, 1, ..., N-1.\nIn our case, the sequence length is L=8, and the DFT length is N=4. So we need to calculate:\n`Z(k) = sum_{n=0 to 7} y(n) * e^(-j*2*pi*nk/4) = sum_{n=0 to 7} y(n) * W_4^(nk)` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the DFT calculation using properties of the twiddle factor\nLet's expand the sum and use the property that W_4^(n+4)k = W_4^(nk) * W_4^(4k) = W_4^(nk) * (W_4^4)^k = W_4^(nk) * 1^k = W_4^(nk).\n`Z(k) = y(0)W_4^(0k) + y(1)W_4^(1k) + y(2)W_4^(2k) + y(3)W_4^(3k) + y(4)W_4^(4k) + y(5)W_4^(5k) + y(6)W_4^(6k) + y(7)W_4^(7k)`\n`Z(k) = y(0)W_4^(0k) + y(1)W_4^(1k) + y(2)W_4^(2k) + y(3)W_4^(3k) + y(4)W_4^(0k) + y(5)W_4^(1k) + y(6)W_4^(2k) + y(7)W_4^(3k)`\nGrouping terms with the same twiddle factor:\n`Z(k) = [y(0)+y(4)]W_4^(0k) + [y(1)+y(5)]W_4^(1k) + [y(2)+y(6)]W_4^(2k) + [y(3)+y(7)]W_4^(3k)`\nThis shows that Z(k) is the 4-point DFT of the 4-point sequence formed by aliasing the 8-point sequence y(n) in time. Let this aliased sequence be `z_a(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for n=0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n### Step 4: Relate the desired DFT to the 8-point DFT of y(n)\nThere is a fundamental DFT property that relates time-aliasing to frequency-sampling.\nIf Y(k) is the 8-point DFT of the 8-point sequence y(n), then the even-indexed samples of Y(k) are equal to the 4-point DFT of the time-aliased sequence `y(n) + y(n+4)`.\nTherefore, the desired 4-point DFT, Z(k), is simply the even-indexed samples of Y(k), the 8-point DFT of y(n).\n`Z(k) = Y(2k)` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the 8-point DFT Y(k) using the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) FFT approach\nThe sequence y(n) is formed by interleaving x(n) and h(n).\n*   Even-indexed samples of y(n): y_e(n) = y(2n) = x(n) for n=0,1,2,3.\n*   Odd-indexed samples of y(n): y_o(n) = y(2n+1) = h(n) for n=0,1,2,3.\nThe 4-point DFT of y_e(n) is X(k), and the 4-point DFT of y_o(n) is H(k).\nThe 8-point DFT Y(k) can be computed from X(k) and H(k) using the DIT-FFT butterfly formulas:\nFor k = 0, 1, 2, 3:\n*   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n*   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`\nwhere W_8 = e^(-j*2*pi/8) is the 8-point twiddle factor.\n\n### Step 6: Perform the final calculation for Z(k) = Y(2k)\nWe need to calculate Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), and Z(3).\n*   **Z(0) = Y(2*0) = Y(0)**\n    Using the formula `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` with k=0:\n    `Z(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1) * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **Z(1) = Y(2*1) = Y(2)**\n    Using the formula `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` with k=2:\n    We need W_8^2 = e^(-j*2*pi*2/8) = e^(-j*pi/2) = -j.\n    `Z(1) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n*   **Z(2) = Y(2*2) = Y(4)**\n    Using the formula `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` with k=0:\n    `Z(2) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - (1) * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **Z(3) = Y(2*3) = Y(6)**\n    Using the formula `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` with k=2:\n    `Z(3) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n\n### Final Answer Compilation\nThe resulting 4-point DFT Z(k) is:\n*   Z(0) = 1\n*   Z(1) = -1 - j\n*   Z(2) = 1\n*   Z(3) = -1 + j\n\nSo the final vector is [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j].\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
