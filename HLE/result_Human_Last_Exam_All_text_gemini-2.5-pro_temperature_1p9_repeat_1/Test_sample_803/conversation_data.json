    "This question asks for the identification of all nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset $S$ of a group $G$ is product-free if for all $x, y \\in S$, their product $xy$ is not in $S$. This can be written as $S^2 \\cap S = \\emptyset$. Note that $x$ and $y$ are not necessarily distinct.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPF Set):** A product-free set $S$ is a MIPF set if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means for any element $g \\in G \\setminus S$, the set $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is not product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group $G$ is called \"filled\" if every MIPF set $S$ in $G$ generates $G$ (i.e., $\\langle S \\rangle = G$).\n\n### Step 2: Use a Known Characterization of Filled Groups\n\nThe definition of a filled group is quite abstract. Fortunately, there's a more concrete algebraic characterization which makes the problem tractable.\n\n**Theorem (G.L. Walls):** A finite group $G$ is filled if and only if for each maximal subgroup $M$ of $G$, there exists an element $g \\in G \\setminus M$ such that $g^2 \\notin M$.\n\nThis theorem can be stated in its contrapositive form, which is often more useful for proving a group is *not* filled:\n\n**Criterion for a non-filled group:** A finite group $G$ is *not* filled if there exists at least one maximal subgroup $M$ of $G$ such that for all elements $g \\in G \\setminus M$, we have $g^2 \\in M$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of Groups of Order $2q^m$\n\nLet $G$ be a group of order $|G|=2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The order of $G$ can be written as $2k$, where $k = q^m$. Since $q$ is an odd prime, $k=q^m$ is an odd integer for any natural number $m$.\n\nOur goal is to check if groups of this order can satisfy the condition for being filled. We will use the criterion for being *not* filled. We need to determine if such a group $G$ must have a maximal subgroup $M$ with the property that $g^2 \\in M$ for all $g \\notin M$.\n\n### Step 4: Show that Groups of Order $2k$ (for odd $k$) Always Have a Subgroup of Index 2\n\nLet $|G|=2k$ with $k$ odd.\nWe can prove the existence of a subgroup of index 2 using the concept of the regular representation.\n1.  Let $\\lambda: G \\to S_{2k}$ be the left regular representation of $G$, which maps each element of $G$ to a permutation of the elements of $G$. This is an injective homomorphism.\n2.  Since $|G|=2k$ is even, by Cauchy's theorem, there exists an element $x \\in G$ of order 2.\n3.  The permutation $\\lambda(x)$ has no fixed points. Since $x^2=e$, its cycle decomposition consists only of 2-cycles (transpositions). The number of such 2-cycles must be $|G|/2 = (2k)/2 = k$.\n4.  The signature of a permutation is multiplicative. The signature of a single transposition is -1. Thus, the signature of $\\lambda(x)$ is $(-1)^k$.\n5.  We are given that $k = q^m$ is odd. Therefore, $\\operatorname{sgn}(\\lambda(x)) = (-1)^{\\text{odd}} = -1$.\n6.  Now consider the homomorphism $\\psi: G \\to C_2 \\cong \\{1, -1\\}$ defined by $\\psi = \\operatorname{sgn} \\circ \\lambda$. This is a valid homomorphism because both $\\lambda$ and $\\operatorname{sgn}$ are homomorphisms.\n7.  Since $\\psi(x) = -1$, the homomorphism $\\psi$ is surjective.\n8.  The kernel of a surjective homomorphism from $G$ to $C_2$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of index 2. Let $M = \\ker(\\psi)$. Then $[G:M]=2$.\n\nSo, any group $G$ of order $2k$ with $k$ odd (including our case where $k=q^m$) must have a normal subgroup $M$ of index 2.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Criterion for Non-Filled Groups\n\n1.  **A subgroup of index 2 is always maximal.** If $M$ is a subgroup with $[G:M]=2$ and there exists a subgroup $H$ such that $M \\subset H \\subset G$, then by Lagrange's theorem, $|M|$ must divide $|H|$ and $|H|$ must divide $|G|$. This means $|G|/2$ divides $|H|$ and $|H|$ divides $|G|$. As $|H| \\neq |M|$ and $|H| \\neq |G|$, this is impossible. Thus, $M$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$.\n\n2.  **Check the squaring condition for this maximal subgroup.** Let $M$ be the maximal subgroup of index 2 that we found. Consider any element $g \\in G \\setminus M$. We want to check if $g^2 \\in M$.\n    *   Since $[G:M]=2$, the quotient group $G/M$ is isomorphic to $C_2$. The elements of $G/M$ are the identity coset $M$ and one other coset, $gM$.\n    *   As $gM$ is the non-identity element in a group of order 2, its square must be the identity: $(gM)^2 = M$.\n    *   By the definition of coset multiplication, $(gM)^2 = g^2 M$.\n    *   Therefore, $g^2 M = M$, which by definition implies that $g^2 \\in M$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.** We have found a maximal subgroup $M$ in $G$ such that for all elements $g \\in G \\setminus M$, we have $g^2 \\in M$. According to the criterion from Step 2, this proves that the group $G$ is **not filled**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis above applies to *any* group of order $2q^m$ where $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$, regardless of whether the group is abelian or nonabelian. Every such group possesses a (maximal) subgroup of index 2, which fails the condition required for the group to be filled.\n\nTherefore, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$. The set of such groups is empty.\n\n<<<There are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for odd prime q and natural number m.>>>"
