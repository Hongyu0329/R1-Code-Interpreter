    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel $\\Lambda$**\n\nLet $\\mathcal{H}_S$ be a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space (for a qudit). The space of linear operators on $\\mathcal{H}_S$ is denoted by $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$, which has dimension $d^2$.\n\nA standard basis for $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$ is the set of generalized Pauli operators (or discrete Weyl-Heisenberg operators) $\\{U_a\\}_{a \\in G}$, where $G = \\mathbb{Z}_d \\times \\mathbb{Z}_d$ is an index set of size $d^2$. These operators are unitary and orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, i.e., $\\text{Tr}(U_a^\\dagger U_b) = d \\delta_{ab}$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$ is a quantum channel that takes the form:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a \\in G} p_a U_a \\rho U_a^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_a\\}_{a \\in G}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_a \\ge 0$ for all $a \\in G$ and $\\sum_{a \\in G} p_a = 1$. This form is a Kraus representation of the channel with Kraus operators $K_a = \\sqrt{p_a} U_a$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$**\n\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be realized through a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometry $V$ mapping the system Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S$ to a larger space $\\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$, where $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is the environment's Hilbert space. The original channel is recovered by tracing out the environment: $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n\nThe complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ describes the information that \"leaks\" into the environment. It is obtained by tracing out the system instead:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe Kraus operators $\\{K_a\\}$ for $\\Lambda$ determine the complementary channel. The environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$ must have a dimension at least equal to the number of Kraus operators. We can choose $\\mathcal{H}_E$ to be a $d^2$-dimensional space with an orthonormal basis $\\{|a\\rangle_E\\}_{a \\in G}$.\n\nThe output of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)$ is an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_E$. Its matrix representation in the $\\{|a\\rangle_E\\}$ basis is given by:\n$$ (\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho))_{ab} = \\text{Tr}(K_b^\\dagger K_a \\rho) = \\sqrt{p_a p_b} \\text{Tr}(U_b^\\dagger U_a \\rho) $$\nwhere $(\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho))_{ab} = \\langle a | \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) | b \\rangle$. Let's denote the output operator as $W_\\rho = \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Rank of the Complementary Channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$**\n\nThe rank of a channel is the dimension of its output image space. The map $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is linear, and it maps operators from $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$ to $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(\\text{Im}(\\tilde{\\Lambda})) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) \\mid \\rho \\in \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S) \\}) $$\n\nThe domain of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$, which has dimension $d^2$. The rank of a linear map cannot exceed the dimension of its domain. Therefore, an immediate upper bound for the rank is:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) \\le \\dim(\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)) = d^2 $$\n\n**Step 4: Find the Maximal Rank**\n\nTo find the maximal possible rank, we need to see if the rank can achieve this upper bound of $d^2$ for some choice of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ (i.e., for some choice of the probability distribution $\\{p_a\\}$).\n\nLet's test if the map $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ can be of full rank ($d^2$). This happens if $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is injective, meaning its kernel is trivial. Since the domain is $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$, we can check this by applying $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ to a basis of the domain. Let's use the Pauli operator basis $\\{U_c\\}_{c \\in G}$. The rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the dimension of the space spanned by the output operators $\\{\\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_c)\\}_{c \\in G}$.\n\nLet $W_c = \\tilde{\\Lambda}(U_c)$. The matrix elements of this output operator are:\n$$ (W_c)_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_a p_b} \\text{Tr}(U_b^\\dagger U_a U_c) $$\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose a Pauli channel that \"mixes\" as much as possible. Let's consider the channel where all probabilities are non-zero. A simple choice is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_a = 1/d^2$ for all $a \\in G$. In this case, $\\sqrt{p_a p_b} = 1/d^2$ for all $a, b$.\n\nNow, let's check if the set of output operators $\\{W_c\\}_{c \\in G}$ is linearly independent for this choice. Assume a linear combination is zero:\n$$ \\sum_{c \\in G} \\gamma_c W_c = 0 $$\nThis is an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_E$, so all its matrix elements must be zero:\n$$ \\sum_{c \\in G} \\gamma_c (W_c)_{ab} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } a, b \\in G $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $(W_c)_{ab}$ and $p_a$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d^2} \\sum_{c \\in G} \\gamma_c \\text{Tr}(U_b^\\dagger U_a U_c) = 0 $$\nThe product of Pauli operators is, up to a phase, another Pauli operator: $U_a U_c = \\omega^{\\phi(a,c)} U_{a+c}$. Similarly, $U_b^\\dagger U_a = \\omega^{\\psi(a,b)} U_{a-b}$.\nThe trace property $\\text{Tr}(U_g) = d \\delta_{g,0}$ implies that $\\text{Tr}(U_b^\\dagger U_a U_c)$ is non-zero only if the product $U_b^\\dagger U_a U_c$ is proportional to the identity operator $U_0$. This happens if and only if $b = a+c$ (in the group $G$).\n\nSo, for a fixed pair of indices $(a,b)$, the sum over $c$ has at most one non-zero term, which occurs for $c = b-a$. The linear combination equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\gamma_{b-a} \\text{Tr}(U_b^\\dagger U_a U_{b-a}) = 0 $$\nThe trace term $\\text{Tr}(U_b^\\dagger U_a U_{b-a})$ is proportional to $d$ and is never zero. Therefore, we must have $\\gamma_{b-a} = 0$.\nSince this must hold for any pair $(a,b) \\in G \\times G$, we can choose $a$ and $b$ such that $b-a$ can be any element in $G$. For example, by fixing $a=0$ and letting $b$ iterate through all of $G$, we find that $\\gamma_c=0$ for all $c \\in G$.\n\nThis proves that the set of $d^2$ operators $\\{W_c\\}_{c \\in G}$ is linearly independent. The dimension of their span is $d^2$, which means the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is $d^2$ for this specific Pauli channel.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nWe have established two facts:\n1. The rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is at most $d^2$.\n2. There exists at least one Pauli channel (the completely depolarizing channel) for which the rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is exactly $d^2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
