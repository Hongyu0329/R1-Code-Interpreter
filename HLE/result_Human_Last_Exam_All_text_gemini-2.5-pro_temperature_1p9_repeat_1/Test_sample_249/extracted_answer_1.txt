The minimum possible value for the diameter of G is given by the following piecewise function of $n$ and $m$:
- 2, if $m=n+1$
- 3, if $m=n$
- 4, if $m \le n-1$ and $2m > n+1$
- $n+5-2m$, if $m \le n-1$ and $2m \le n+1$
(Given that $n,m$ are positive integers and a tree with $n+2$ vertices and $m$ leaves can be constructed. For $n \ge 2$, $m=n$ is valid. For any tree with more than 2 vertices, $m \ge 2$.)
