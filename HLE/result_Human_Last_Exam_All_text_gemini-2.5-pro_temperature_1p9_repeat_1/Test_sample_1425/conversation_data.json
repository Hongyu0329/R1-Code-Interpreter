    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### 1. Understanding the Grand Canonical Ensemble and Partition Function\n\nThe grand canonical ensemble describes an open system that can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir at a constant temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$. The probability of the system being in a state $s$ with energy $E_s$ and particle number $N_s$ is proportional to $e^{-\\beta(E_s - \\mu N_s)}$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\nThe grand canonical partition function, denoted by $\\mathcal{Z}$, is the sum over all possible states of these Boltzmann factors. In operator formalism, it is expressed as a trace:\n$ \\mathcal{Z} = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right) $\nHere, $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the system's Hamiltonian operator, and $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n\n#### 2. Identifying the Hamiltonian and the Operator in the Exponent\n\nThe question specifies that the system's Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H}_{sys} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. This is a specific and unusual case where the energy of the system is defined by the chemical potential and the number of particles, rather than kinetic or potential energy terms.\n\nWe need to construct the full operator for the grand canonical ensemble, which is $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N}$. Substituting the given Hamiltonian:\n$ \\hat{K} = (-\\mu \\hat{N}) - \\mu \\hat{N} = -2\\mu \\hat{N} $\nThus, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n$ \\mathcal{Z} = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu \\hat{N})} \\right) = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} \\right) $\n\n#### 3. Using the Path Integral Formalism\n\nThe path integral formalism is a powerful method to compute partition functions. The partition function $\\mathcal{Z}$ can be written as a functional integral over fields $\\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$ (complex-valued for bosons, Grassmann-valued for fermions):\n$ \\mathcal{Z} = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] \\, e^{-S[\\phi^*, \\phi]} $\nThe Euclidean action $S$ is related to the operator $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N}$.\n\nFor a system of non-interacting particles with single-particle energy levels $\\epsilon_j$, the action is given by:\n$ S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_j \\phi_j^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_j - \\mu) \\phi_j(\\tau) $\nThis action corresponds to the operator $\\hat{K} = \\sum_j (\\epsilon_j - \\mu) a_j^\\dagger a_j$.\n\nIn our specific problem, we have $\\hat{K} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$. In the second-quantized form, the number operator is $\\hat{N} = \\sum_j a_j^\\dagger a_j$, where $j$ labels a complete set of single-particle states and $a_j^\\dagger, a_j$ are the creation and annihilation operators for that state.\nSo, $\\hat{K} = \\sum_j (-2\\mu) a_j^\\dagger a_j$.\n\nBy comparing this with the general form $\\hat{K} = \\sum_j (\\epsilon_j' - \\mu') a_j^\\dagger a_j$, we can identify an effective single-particle energy term $E'_j = \\epsilon_j' - \\mu' = -2\\mu$. This implies a system of particles where each particle, regardless of its state $j$, contributes an energy of $-2\\mu$ to the grand canonical operator $\\hat{K}$.\n\n#### 4. Evaluating the Path Integral (using standard results)\n\nEvaluating the path integral for the action with the identified effective energy gives a standard result that depends on the statistics of the particles (Bosons or Fermions). The question does not specify the particle type, so we must provide the answer for both cases.\n\nThe result of the path integral evaluation for the partition function is a product over the contributions from each single-particle state $j$.\n\n**Case A: The particles are Bosons**\nFor bosons, the occupation number of any state can be $n_j = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The path integral over complex fields results in:\n$ \\mathcal{Z}_{\\text{Boson}} = \\prod_j \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta E'_j}} \\right) $\nSubstituting our effective energy $E'_j = -2\\mu$:\n$ \\mathcal{Z}_{\\text{Boson}} = \\prod_j \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)}} \\right) = \\prod_j \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}} \\right) $\n\n*Careful Point*: For the geometric series summed to obtain this result to converge, we must have $|e^{2\\beta\\mu}| < 1$, which implies $2\\beta\\mu < 0$. Since $\\beta > 0$, this requires the chemical potential to be negative, $\\mu < 0$. If $\\mu \\ge 0$, the partition function diverges, indicating a physical instability where the system tends to fill with an infinite number of particles.\n\n**Case B: The particles are Fermions**\nFor fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle restricts the occupation number of any state to be $n_j = 0$ or $1$. The path integral over Grassmann fields results in:\n$ \\mathcal{Z}_{\\text{Fermion}} = \\prod_j \\left( 1 + e^{-\\beta E'_j} \\right) $\nSubstituting our effective energy $E'_j = -2\\mu$:\n$ \\mathcal{Z}_{\\text{Fermion}} = \\prod_j \\left( 1 + e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)} \\right) = \\prod_j \\left( 1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu} \\right) $\nThis result is valid for any value of the chemical potential $\\mu$.\n\n### Summary of Final Answer\n\nThe final answer depends on the statistics of the particles. The product $\\prod_j$ runs over all single-particle quantum states available to the system.\n\n*   For a system of **bosons**, the partition function is $\\mathcal{Z} = \\prod_j (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$, which is valid for $\\mu < 0$.\n*   For a system of **fermions**, the partition function is $\\mathcal{Z} = \\prod_j (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$.\n\nIf the system consists of $M$ identical and independent single-particle states, the expressions become $(1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$ for bosons and $(1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{M}$ for fermions.\n\nSince the question asks for a single expression for \"the partition function Z\", and no particle type is specified, we provide both results as the complete answer.\n\n>>> For Bosons: $Z = \\prod_j \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\nFor Fermions: $Z = \\prod_j (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$"
