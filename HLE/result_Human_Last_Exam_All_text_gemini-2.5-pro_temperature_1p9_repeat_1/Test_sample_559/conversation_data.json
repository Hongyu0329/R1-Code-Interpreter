    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\nWe are given a system of two autonomous ordinary differential equations:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1 - u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u^2(t)$$\nWe need to find the separatrix of this system in the phase plane $(u, d)$, restricted to $u \\geq 0$.\n\nA separatrix is a trajectory (or a set of trajectories) that separates regions of the phase space with qualitatively different behaviors. Typically, the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices.\n\n**2. Find the Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\n\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow, substitute these values into $d'(t)=0$:\n- If $u=0$:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$.\nSo, we have an equilibrium point at **(0, 0)**.\n\n- If $u=1$:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d = 0$.\n$2d(d+1) = 0$, which gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\nSo, we have two more equilibrium points at **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**3. Analyze the Stability of the Equilibrium Points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d)$ of the system:\n$F(u, d) = u^3 - u^2$\n$G(u, d) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3 + u^4$\n\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow evaluate at each equilibrium point:\n- At **(0, 0)**:\n$J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a degenerate point; linearization is inconclusive.\n\n- At **(1, 0)**:\n$J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ 0 - 3 + 4 & 0 + 5 - 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, (1, 0) is an **unstable node (source)**.\n\n- At **(1, -1)**:\n$J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3-2 & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1) - 3 + 4 & 4(-1) + 5 - 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7-3+4 & -4+2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since one is positive and one is negative, (1, -1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n**4. Identify the Separatrix**\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (1, -1) are separatrices. A separatrix can also be a special trajectory that connects equilibrium points (a heteroclinic orbit) or a trajectory that connects a saddle point to itself (a homoclinic orbit).\n\nLet's look for an invariant manifold, a curve $d=f(u)$ on which trajectories lie. If such a curve exists, the equations must be satisfied. That is, if we have a trajectory $(u(t), d(t))$ on the curve, then $d(t) = f(u(t))$. Differentiating this with respect to $t$ gives $d'(t) = f'(u(t))u'(t)$.\nWe can express this as $\\frac{dd}{dt} = \\frac{df}{du} \\frac{du}{dt}$.\nLet's test simple functional forms for $d=f(u)$. The equations contain polynomials, so it's plausible that a polynomial curve is an invariant manifold.\n\nLet's test the curve $d = -u^2$.\nIf this is an invariant manifold, a trajectory starting on this curve stays on it.\nLet's compute the time derivative of $d(t)$ under this assumption:\n$d'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2(t)) = -2u(t) \\cdot u'(t)$.\nSubstitute the given expression for $u'(t)$:\n$d'(t) = -2u(t) \\cdot (u^2(t)(u(t)-1)) = -2u^4(t) + 2u^3(t)$.\n\nNow, let's substitute $d=-u^2$ into the original equation for $d'(t)$:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$\n$d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - (u^3 - u^4)$\n$d'(t) = 2u^4 + (-5u^4 + 3u^3) - u^3 + u^4$\n$d'(t) = (2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3$\n$d'(t) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nThe two expressions for $d'(t)$ are identical. This confirms that the curve $d = -u^2$ is an **invariant manifold**.\n\n**5. Verify if the Invariant Manifold is a Separatrix**\nLet's check if this curve passes through any of the equilibrium points.\n- At (0, 0): $0 = -(0)^2$. Yes.\n- At (1, 0): $0 \\neq -(1)^2 = -1$. No.\n- At (1, -1): $-1 = -(1)^2 = -1$. Yes.\n\nThe invariant curve $d = -u^2$ connects the saddle point (1, -1) to the degenerate point (0, 0).\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (1, -1) are guaranteed to be separatrices. Let's find their directions.\nThe eigenvector for the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$ is $v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe eigenvector for the stable eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -2$ is $v_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe unstable manifold leaves the saddle point (1, -1) tangent to the vector $(1, -2)$, meaning its slope is $d_u' = -2/1 = -2$.\nLet's check the slope of our invariant curve $d = -u^2$ at $u=1$.\n$\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2(1)=-2$.\nThis confirms that the invariant manifold $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1).\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point is a classic example of a separatrix. It partitions the phase plane into regions of different dynamics. Trajectories on this manifold connect the saddle point to another equilibrium point, while trajectories starting off the manifold will flow elsewhere. For this system, trajectories on the branch of $d=-u^2$ for $u\\in[0,1]$ converge to (0,0), whereas trajectories slightly perturbed from this curve will be repelled from it and end up escaping to infinity along the d-axis. Thus, it acts as a separator.\n\nTherefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the separatrix of the system.\n\nFinal answer:\nThe separatrix is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n>>> $d = -u^2$"
