    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine if it has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understand Trisyllabic Laxing**\nTrisyllabic laxing (or trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change in English. It has two main conditions:\n1.  A long vowel...\n2.  ...in the third-to-last (antepenultimate) syllable of a word...\n3.  ...is shortened (or \"laxed\").\n\nThis often occurs in pairs of words, where a base word has a long vowel, and a derived, longer word has a corresponding short vowel. For example, `crime` /kraɪm/ (from a long vowel) vs. `criminal` /ˈkrɪmɪnəl/.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Word**\n\n*   **southern:**\n    *   **Related word:** `south`. In Middle English, `sūth` had a long vowel /uː/ (which becomes /aʊ/ in Modern English).\n    *   **Derived word:** `southern` (from Middle English `sūtherne`).\n    *   **Syllabification:** `south-er-n` (historically `sū-ther-ne`). It is trisyllabic.\n    *   **Analysis:** The long vowel /uː/ was in the antepenultimate (third-to-last) syllable. The rule applied, shortening it to the vowel we now hear as /ʌ/ in `southern`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word *has* undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative:**\n    *   **Related word:** `derive`. The stressed vowel /aɪ/ comes from a Middle English long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Derived word:** `derivative`.\n    *   **Syllabification:** `de-riv-a-tive`. It is polysyllabic. The syllable `-riv-` is the antepenultimate.\n    *   **Analysis:** The long vowel sound from `derive` is shortened to /ɪ/ in `derivative`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word *has* undergone laxing according to the trisyllabic pattern.\n\n*   **serenity:**\n    *   **Related word:** `serene`, which has a long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Derived word:** `serenity`.\n    *   **Syllabification:** `se-ren-i-ty`. The syllable `-ren-` is the antepenultimate.\n    *   **Analysis:** The long vowel /iː/ from `serene` shortens to /ɛ/ in `serenity`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word *has* undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant:**\n    *   **Related word:** `please`, which has a long vowel /iː/. The derivative is `pleasant` with a short vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   **Syllabification:** `pleas-ant`. This word has only two syllables.\n    *   **Analysis:** While there is a vowel shortening relationship between `please` and `pleasant`, the word `pleasant` is not trisyllabic. Therefore, the shortening cannot be due to the *trisyllabic laxing* rule. The rule's structural condition is not met.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word has *not* undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude:**\n    *   **Related root:** Latin `grātus` (with a long `ā`), related to English `grate` /greɪt/.\n    *   **Word:** `gratitude`.\n    *   **Syllabification:** `grat-i-tude`. This word is trisyllabic.\n    *   **Analysis:** The first syllable `grat-` is the antepenultimate syllable. The vowel `a`, which was historically long, is now the short vowel /æ/. Compare `nation` /ˈneɪʃən/ with `national` /ˈnæʃənəl/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word *has* undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow:**\n    *   **Etymology:** From Old English `sceadu`. The first vowel (`æ`) in this word was *already short* in Old English.\n    *   **Syllabification:** `shad-ow`. This word has only two syllables.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word fails the conditions for trisyllabic laxing on two counts. First, its root vowel was never long, so it could not be shortened. Second, the word is disyllabic, not trisyllabic, so the rule would not apply regardless.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This word has *not* undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\n\nBoth `pleasant` and `shadow` did not undergo trisyllabic laxing because they are not trisyllabic. However, `shadow` is the more definitive example. The `please`/`pleasant` pair exhibits vowel shortening (of a different kind), which might be confused with trisyllabic laxing. In contrast, `shadow` has no history of a long vowel in its root at all, making it completely unrelated to any laxing or shortening rule. Therefore, it is the clearest example of a word that has not undergone this process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
