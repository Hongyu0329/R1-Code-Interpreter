    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components are:\n    *   **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay.\n    *   **Location:** The wide boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   **Clue:** The surname of an English poet is mentioned in the description.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Pitfalls and Key Insights (Careful Points):**\n    *   The phrase \"in the Russian translation of an essay\" is a critical clue. It suggests the connection is not obvious in English or German, but arises specifically from the Russian language. This points towards a pun, a homophone, or a specific cultural reference.\n    *   The \"certain essay\" is likely a well-known piece of literature, at least in Russian literary circles, as this is a puzzle-like question.\n    *   The combination of \"Vienna\" and a \"Russian text\" is a strong hint.\n    *   The link must be between a word used to describe a boulevard and the sound of an English poet's name.\n\n3.  **Trace the Connection:**\n    *   The essay in question is the famous \"Journey to Armenia\" («Путешествие в Армению») by the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam. While this is an original Russian essay and not a translation, it fits all other aspects of the question and is the source of this well-known literary puzzle.\n    *   In the essay, Mandelstam contrasts the streets of Yerevan with those of Europe. He recalls the boulevards of Vienna and describes their pavement as being distinctly convex, bulging slightly upwards in the middle.\n    *   To describe this convex shape, he uses the Russian word **«раковина» (rakovina)**, which literally translates to \"shell\" or \"conch.\"\n    *   He then makes a poetic, associative leap—a pun. The sound of the Russian word \"rakovina\" evokes the surname of the English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe **Shelley**. Mandelstam creates a beautiful image of the streets themselves paying homage to the poet.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   The essay is \"Journey to Armenia\" by Osip Mandelstam.\n    *   The location described is a Viennese boulevard.\n    *   The descriptive Russian word is \"раковина\" (rakovina), meaning \"shell.\"\n    *   The pun connects \"rakovina\" to the English surname **Shelley**.\n\nTherefore, the surname of the English poet is Shelley.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
