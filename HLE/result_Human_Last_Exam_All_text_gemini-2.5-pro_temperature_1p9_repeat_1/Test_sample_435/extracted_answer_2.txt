Given that interleukin-15 promotes the development of less differentiated, more potent memory T cell phenotypes (like central memory and stem cell memory T cells), CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to be functionally superior. Therefore, upon encountering their target antigen, they would mount a more robust response, leading to **increased release of effector cytokines** such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15.
