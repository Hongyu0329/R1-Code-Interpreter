No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial; it follows the Parker Spiral, which is typically oriented at about 45 degrees to the radial direction. Your intuition is correct: for Alfv√©n Ion Cyclotron (AIC) waves that propagate along the magnetic field, the normalized magnetic helicity must be calculated using magnetic field components perpendicular to the *local magnetic field direction*, not the radial direction. The rigorous method requires transforming the measurements into a Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system. A calculation using components perpendicular to the radial direction is an approximation that is only valid in the specific and uncommon case where the interplanetary magnetic field happens to be pointing radially. Therefore, the definition you encountered is likely a simplification or refers to this specific circumstance.
