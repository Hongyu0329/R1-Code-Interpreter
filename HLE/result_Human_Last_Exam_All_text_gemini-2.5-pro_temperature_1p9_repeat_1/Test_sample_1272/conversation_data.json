    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical context and key figures.**\nThe question concerns the Ming Dynasty's occupation of Vietnam in the early 15th century (known in Vietnam as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination) and the subsequent Vietnamese rebellion.\n*   **Key Figure:** Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟). He was the Grand Commandant stationed in Yunnan and was one of the primary Ming commanders tasked with controlling Vietnam (then called Giao Chỉ) and suppressing rebellions.\n*   **Key Conflict:** The Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), led by the Vietnamese hero Lê Lợi.\n\n**Step 2: Differentiate between early campaigns and a \"major defeat\".**\nThe Ming Dynasty successfully conquered Vietnam from the Hồ Dynasty in 1407. Mu Sheng was involved in this initial successful invasion. The defeats came later, during the Lam Sơn Uprising. A \"major defeat\" implies a significant battle where Mu Sheng was the commanding general, resulting in substantial losses and a strategic setback for the Ming army. This distinguishes it from minor skirmishes or campaigns where he was not the principal commander.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the chronology of the Lam Sơn Uprising to find Mu Sheng's first major personal defeat.**\n*   **1418–1423:** Lê Lợi's rebellion begins in his mountainous home region of Lam Sơn (modern-day Thanh Hóa Province). During this period, the Ming army launched several campaigns to crush the nascent rebellion. While they failed to destroy Lê Lợi's forces, the Lam Sơn army was largely contained and on the defensive, suffering many hardships. These campaigns, though not fully successful for the Ming, would not be characterized as a major defeat for a top general like Mu Sheng.\n*   **1424:** Following the advice of his strategist Nguyễn Chích, Lê Lợi made a pivotal decision to move his forces south out of the mountains and into the more populous and less-defended province of Nghệ An. This marked a new phase of the war.\n*   **1424–1425: The Nghệ An Campaign and Mu Sheng's Defeat.**\n    *   The Lam Sơn army successfully captured the key Ming citadel of Trà Lân in Nghệ An.\n    *   In response, Mu Sheng personally led a large army from Yunnan to suppress the uprising in Nghệ An and relieve besieged Ming garrisons.\n    *   In early 1425, Mu Sheng's forces engaged with Lê Lợi's army. Lê Lợi utilized ambush tactics effectively. The decisive engagement occurred at **Khả Lưu Pass** (đèo Khả Lưu).\n    *   Mu Sheng's army was caught in the ambush, routed, and suffered a significant defeat. He was forced to abandon the campaign and retreat, effectively ceding control of the entire Nghệ An region to the Lam Sơn forces.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the significance of this battle.**\nThis defeat in early 1425 was the first time that Mu Sheng, personally leading a major expeditionary force during the Lam Sơn war, suffered a clear and decisive loss. This event was a major turning point, allowing Lê Lợi to establish a firm base of operations in Nghệ An and expand his rebellion. It preceded other famous Ming defeats like the Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động (1426, where Wang Tong was the commander) and the Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang (1427, where Liu Sheng was killed and Mu Sheng's relief army subsequently retreated).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the current Vietnamese province.**\nThe battlefields of the 1425 campaign, including the Trà Lân citadel and Khả Lưu Pass, are located within the territory of modern-day **Nghệ An Province** in North Central Vietnam.\n\nTherefore, the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat during the Lam Sơn Uprising is Nghệ An.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
