No. The mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics (based on Hilbert spaces, operators, and differential equations) is designed to model physical systems and predict empirical outcomes. Gödel's ontological proof is a formal argument in modal logic, concerned with abstract concepts like "positive properties" and "necessary existence". There is no mapping between the concepts of Gödel's proof and the mathematical objects of quantum mechanics, making it impossible to use one to prove the other. They are two fundamentally different and non-overlapping intellectual domains.
