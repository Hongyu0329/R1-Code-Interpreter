    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Framework: The Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion**\n\nThe epsilon expansion is a technique within the Renormalization Group (RG) theory used to calculate critical exponents. It works by performing a perturbative expansion around the upper critical dimension, $d_{uc}$. The expansion parameter is $\\epsilon = d_{uc} - d$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension of the system. The technique is powerful because for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$ (i.e., for dimensions $d$ just below $d_{uc}$), the system is close to the exactly solvable mean-field case, and the corrections can be calculated systematically.\n\n**2. Identify Key Parameters**\n\n*   **Spatial Dimension (d):** The problem states the system has a spatial dimension $d=3$.\n*   **Scaling Exponent ($\\alpha$):** We need to find the exponent for the specific heat, which diverges near the critical temperature $T_c$ as $C \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\alpha}$.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_{uc}$):** For the universality class of systems like the Ising model, XY model, and Heisenberg model (which describe common phase transitions), the upper critical dimension is $d_{uc} = 4$. Above this dimension, the critical exponents take on their mean-field values.\n*   **Expansion Parameter ($\\epsilon$):** Using the values above, we can calculate $\\epsilon$:\n    $\\epsilon = d_{uc} - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n**3. Determine the Universality Class**\n\nThe values of the critical exponents depend on the universality class, which is primarily determined by the spatial dimension $d$ and the number of components of the order parameter, $n$. The problem does not specify $n$. In such cases, the standard assumption is the simplest and most common case: the **Ising universality class**, where the order parameter is a scalar.\n*   **Number of order parameter components (n):** For the Ising model, $n=1$.\n\n**4. Recall the Formula for $\\alpha$ from the Epsilon Expansion**\n\nRG calculations provide the critical exponents as a power series in $\\epsilon$. To the first order (the \"one-loop\" approximation), the formula for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ for an $n$-component model is:\n\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to use the correct formula. This formula can be derived from the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu = 2 - (4-\\epsilon)\\nu$ and the one-loop result for the correlation length exponent $\\nu$.\n\n**5. Calculate the First-Order Approximation for $\\alpha$**\n\nNow, we substitute the values of $n$ and $\\epsilon$ into the formula.\n*   Substitute $n=1$ (for the Ising class) into the general formula:\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{18}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n*   This is the expression for $\\alpha$ to the leading order in $\\epsilon$.\n\n**6. Obtain the Final Value for d=3**\n\nTo find the exponent for $d=3$, we substitute $\\epsilon=1$ into our first-order expression:\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The epsilon expansion is an asymptotic series and formally works best for small $\\epsilon$. Setting $\\epsilon=1$ is a significant extrapolation. However, it is the standard procedure for obtaining first-order estimates for 3D systems and surprisingly gives a reasonable approximation. The question asks for the result from this specific method, not necessarily the most accurate known value for $\\alpha$.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correctly identify the upper critical dimension ($d_{uc}=4$)** for the relevant class of models.\n2.  **Assume the correct universality class (Ising, $n=1$)** as it is the standard default when unspecified.\n3.  **Use the correct one-loop formula** for the exponent $\\alpha$.\n4.  **Understand that setting $\\epsilon=1$ is an approximation**, but it is the required step to answer the question for $d=3$ using this method. The question is about the result of the procedure itself.\n\nThe analysis leads to a first-order estimate for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
