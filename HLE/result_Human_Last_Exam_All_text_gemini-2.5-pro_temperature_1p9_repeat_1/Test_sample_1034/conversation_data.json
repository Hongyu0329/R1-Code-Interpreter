    "This problem requires us to find the number of possible integer lengths for the side AC of a triangle ABC, given that there are two possible lengths for the side AB. This is a classic \"ambiguous case\" scenario in trigonometry.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**\n*   We have a triangle ABC.\n*   The side `BC` has a length `S`. The variable `S` is defined as `SNYWR`. This is a placeholder often used in math competitions for the year the competition is held. Based on the origin of this problem (the Shing-Tung Yau High School Mathematics Awards), the value of `S` is 2021. So, `BC = 2021`.\n*   The angle at vertex B is `m∠B = 30°`.\n*   Let `a = BC = 2021`.\n*   Let `b = AC`. We need to find the number of integer values for `b`.\n*   Let `c = AB`. We are told there are two possible values for `c`.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the Problem using the Law of Cosines**\nWe can relate the sides and the known angle using the Law of Cosines with respect to angle B:\n$b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \\cos(B)$\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n$AC^2 = BC^2 + AB^2 - 2(BC)(AB) \\cos(30^{\\circ})$\n$b^2 = 2021^2 + c^2 - 2(2021)(c) (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$\n$b^2 = 2021^2 + c^2 - 2021\\sqrt{3}c$\n\nWe can rearrange this into a quadratic equation where the variable is `c` (the length of side AB):\n$c^2 - (2021\\sqrt{3})c + (2021^2 - b^2) = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Conditions for Two Possible Values of AB**\nFor there to be two possible values for the side length `AB` (which is `c`), the quadratic equation in `c` must have two distinct, positive, real roots.\nLet the quadratic equation be `Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0`, where `x=c`.\nIn our case, `A=1`, `B = -2021\\sqrt{3}`, and `C = 2021^2 - b^2`.\n\n1.  **Condition for two distinct real roots:** The discriminant (`Δ = B^2 - 4AC`) must be greater than zero.\n    $Δ = (-2021\\sqrt{3})^2 - 4(1)(2021^2 - b^2) > 0$\n    $3 \\cdot 2021^2 - 4 \\cdot 2021^2 + 4b^2 > 0$\n    $4b^2 - 2021^2 > 0$\n    $4b^2 > 2021^2$\n    Since `b` is a side length, `b` must be positive. So, we can take the square root of both sides:\n    $2b > 2021$\n    $b > \\frac{2021}{2}$\n\n2.  **Condition for positive roots:** For the side length `c` to be physically possible, the roots must be positive.\n    *   **Sum of roots:** The sum of the roots is `-B/A`.\n        $c_1 + c_2 = -(-2021\\sqrt{3})/1 = 2021\\sqrt{3}$.\n        Since this sum is positive, it's not possible for both roots to be negative.\n    *   **Product of roots:** For both roots to be positive, their product (`C/A`) must also be positive.\n        $c_1 \\cdot c_2 = (2021^2 - b^2)/1 > 0$\n        $2021^2 - b^2 > 0$\n        $2021^2 > b^2$\n        Since `b` is a positive length, we take the square root:\n        $2021 > b$\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Conditions and Find the Range for AC**\nTo satisfy all conditions, the value of `b` (the length of side AC) must be in the interval defined by:\n$\\frac{2021}{2} < b < 2021$\n$1010.5 < b < 2021$\n\n**Step 5: Count the Integer Values in the Range**\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values of `AC`. So we need to count the integers `b` that satisfy `1010.5 < b < 2021`.\n*   The smallest integer greater than 1010.5 is 1011.\n*   The largest integer less than 2021 is 2020.\n\nSo, the possible integer values for `AC` are 1011, 1012, 1013, ..., 2020.\nTo count the number of integers in this range, we use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of values = $2020 - 1011 + 1$\nNumber of values = $1009 + 1$\nNumber of values = $1010$\n\nThus, there are 1010 possible integer values for the side length AC.\n\n<<<1010>>>"
