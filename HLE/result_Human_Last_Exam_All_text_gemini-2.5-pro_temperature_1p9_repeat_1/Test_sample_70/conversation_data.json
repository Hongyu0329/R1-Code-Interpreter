    "This problem requires us to determine which flags of African nations have a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark, under the assumption of maximal rank.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Determine the rank of the flag of Denmark.**\n    *   The Danish flag consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. This means it has two colors, red (R) and white (W).\n    *   To analyze its rank as a matrix, we can imagine it as a grid of pixels, where each pixel has a numerical value corresponding to its color. Let's assign numerical values `r` for red and `w` for white. The condition \"maximal rank\" implies we should choose these values such that `r ≠ w` and they don't cause any accidental linear dependencies.\n    *   The matrix of the Danish flag has rows of two distinct types:\n        1.  \"Red rows\" which are part of the red field but intersected by the vertical white bar of the cross. A typical such row vector would look like `[r, r, ..., r, w, r, ..., r]`. All such rows are identical to each other.\n        2.  The \"White row\" which is the horizontal bar of the cross. This row vector would look like `[w, w, w, ..., w]`.\n    *   The row space of the matrix is the set of all possible linear combinations of its row vectors. Since all the \"red rows\" are identical, the entire set of rows is spanned by just two vectors: the \"red row\" vector and the \"white row\" vector.\n    *   To find the rank, we check if these two spanning vectors are linearly independent. They are linearly independent if one is not a scalar multiple of the other. If `[r, r, ..., w, ..., r] = k * [w, w, ..., w, ..., w]`, this would imply `r = k*w` and `w = k*w`. The second equation gives `k=1` (assuming `w` is not zero). Substituting `k=1` into the first equation gives `r = w`, which contradicts the fact that the flag has two distinct colors. Therefore, the two row types are linearly independent.\n    *   Since the row space is spanned by two linearly independent vectors, the dimension of the row space (the rank of the matrix) is 2.\n\n2.  **Identify the properties of flags with rank 2.**\n    A flag's matrix will have a rank of 2 if its design results in exactly two linearly independent row (or column) vector types, assuming the values for the colors are chosen to maximize the rank. This typically occurs in simple geometric patterns without complex emblems.\n    *   **Simple Bicolors:** Flags with two horizontal or two vertical stripes have two row/column types and thus rank 2.\n    *   **Symmetric Tricolors (A-B-A pattern):** Flags with three horizontal or vertical stripes where the outer stripes are the same color (e.g., green-white-green) have two distinct row/column types (`[G,G,...]` and `[W,W,...]`) and thus rank 2.\n    *   **Hoist-Stripe Flags:** Flags with a vertical stripe at the hoist and two different horizontal stripes filling the rest of the flag will have two distinct row types (e.g., `[C1, C2, C2,...]` and `[C1, C3, C3,...]`, which are linearly independent if `C2 ≠ C3`).\n    *   **Flags with Emblems:** Emblems like stars, shields, or crests almost always introduce additional, unique rows or columns that are linearly independent from the background, increasing the rank to be greater than 2.\n    *   **Multi-color or Complex Patterns:** Flags with three or more stripes of distinct colors (e.g., a vertical tricolor of blue-yellow-red) will have a rank of at least 3. Flags with diagonal lines or complex geometric shapes also typically have a rank greater than 2.\n\n3.  **Analyze the flags of African nations.**\n    We now examine the flags of the 54 African nations based on the criteria above, looking for those that have exactly two types of linearly independent rows/columns and no complex emblems.\n\n    *   **Benin:** The flag has a vertical green stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes, yellow and red, on the fly. This matches the \"Hoist-Stripe\" pattern described above. The two row types are `[Green, Yellow, Yellow,...]` and `[Green, Red, Red,...]`. These are linearly independent, so the rank is 2. It has no emblem.\n    *   **Madagascar:** The flag has a vertical white stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes, red and green, on the fly. This is the same geometric pattern as Benin's flag. The two row types are `[White, Red, Red,...]` and `[White, Green, Green,...]`. These are linearly independent, giving it a rank of 2. It has no emblem.\n    *   **Nigeria:** The flag is a vertical tricolor with the pattern green-white-green. This is a symmetric A-B-A pattern. The column vectors are of only two types: a green column and a white column. These are linearly independent. Therefore, the column rank is 2, and the matrix rank is 2. It has no emblem.\n\n    Other flags are eliminated for the following reasons:\n    *   **Rank > 2:** Flags with 3 or more distinct color stripes (e.g., Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Sierra Leone) have a rank of 3 or more. Flags with complex patterns like diagonals or many stripes (e.g., Republic of the Congo, Seychelles, South Africa) have a rank greater than 2.\n    *   **Emblems:** Most African flags, even those on a simple background, feature an emblem (star, shield, crescent, etc.). These emblems introduce new linearly independent rows/columns, making the rank greater than 2 (e.g., Angola, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mauritania, Somalia).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only African national flags whose designs result in a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2 are those of Benin, Madagascar, and Nigeria.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Nigeria>>>"
