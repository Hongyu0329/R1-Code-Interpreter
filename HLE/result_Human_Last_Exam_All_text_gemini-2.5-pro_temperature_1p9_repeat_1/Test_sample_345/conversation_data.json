The provenance information (\"Herkunft\") listed for the painting in the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden's database explicitly states: \"1967 erworben von Charlotte Günther, geb. Lehmann, Gera\".\n    *   This translates to: \"Acquired in 1967 from Charlotte Günther, née Lehmann, Gera.\"\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the direct evidence from the museum's own records, the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden is the institution that acquired Kurt Günther's 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" in the year 1967.
