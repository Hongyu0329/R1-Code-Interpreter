    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the man's last name.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** \"Andrei Voznesensky called this man 'a joy-discovering sailor'\".\n    This points to a specific poem by the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. The subject of the poem is described as a sailor and an explorer who brought joy through his discoveries. This suggests a famous historical figure known for exploration.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** Voznesensky \"wondered, 'Where is your grave, even a mound?'\"\n    This is a crucial piece of information. It tells us that the man's final resting place was unknown for a very long time. He likely died during an expedition in a remote location, and his grave was lost to history. This clue, combined with the \"sailor\" description, strongly suggests an explorer who perished at sea or in an uncharted territory.\n\n3.  **Combine the first two clues:**\n    Searching for poems by Andrei Voznesensky that contain these themes or direct quotes leads to his poem \"Saga\" (\"Сага\"). This poem contains the lines \"мореход-радостеоткрыватель\" (morekhod-radosteotkryvatel), which translates to \"sailor-joy-discoverer\" or \"joy-discovering sailor,\" and \"Где твоя могила, хотя бы холмик?\" (Gde tvoya mogila, khotya by kholmik?), which means \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". The poem is explicitly dedicated to Captain Commander Vitus **Bering**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the third clue:** \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"\n    This is the final confirmation. We need to check if the mystery of Vitus Bering's grave was solved around this time. Vitus Bering died in 1741 on an island in the North Pacific which was later named after him (Bering Island). He was buried there by the survivors of his expedition, but the exact location of the gravesite was lost over the subsequent centuries.\n\n5.  **Verify the historical event:**\n    In the late 1980s, during the period of *Glasnost* (a Soviet policy of more open discussion), a unique Soviet-Danish collaboration was formed to search for the lost grave. This international expedition, which came to fruition in 1991, successfully located the graves of Bering and five of his crewmen. The remains were exhumed, studied (confirming Bering's identity through forensic facial reconstruction), and then reburied. Therefore, the process that led to the discovery of his grave—the answer to Voznesensky's question—began and \"emerged\" from the political and scientific climate of the late 1980s.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Poet:** The identity of the poet, Andrei Voznesensky, is key as it narrows the search to his body of work.\n*   **The Description:** \"Joy-discovering sailor\" is a very specific poetic phrase that can be traced.\n*   **The Lost Grave:** The detail about the unknown grave is a major filter, ruling out many famous historical figures.\n*   **The Timeframe:** The \"late 1980s\" is a specific historical marker for when the answer started to become clear, pointing to the period of international cooperation that made the archaeological discovery possible.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBy putting all the steps together, the identity of the man is clear. The poem is \"Saga\" by Voznesensky, it is about Vitus Bering, his grave was lost for over 200 years, and the efforts to find it began in the late 1980s, leading to its discovery. The question asks for the man's last name.\n\n<<<Bering>>>"
