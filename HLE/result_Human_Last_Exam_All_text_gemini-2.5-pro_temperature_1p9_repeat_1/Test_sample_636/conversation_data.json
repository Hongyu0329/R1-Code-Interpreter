    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain `F`.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and define the system.**\nWe are given a linear time-invariant system with matrices `A` and `B`.\n`A = [-1, 1; 1, 0]`\n`B = [1, 2; 1, 0]`\n\nWe need to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The system has 2 states (`A` is 2x2) and 2 inputs (`B` is 2x2). This is a multi-input system.\n*   The state feedback gain `F` must be a 2x2 matrix for the dimensions to be compatible in the product `BF`. Let `F = [f11, f12; f21, f22]`.\n*   The closed-loop matrix is defined as `A + BF`, which means the control law is of the form `u = Fx`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the desired characteristic polynomial.**\nThe eigenvalues of a matrix are the roots of its characteristic polynomial. For a system with the desired eigenvalues `lambda_1 = -1 + j` and `lambda_2 = -1 - j`, the characteristic polynomial `p(lambda)` is:\n`p(lambda) = (lambda - lambda_1) * (lambda - lambda_2)`\n`p(lambda) = (lambda - (-1 + j)) * (lambda - (-1 - j))`\n`p(lambda) = ((lambda + 1) - j) * ((lambda + 1) + j)`\nUsing the algebraic identity `(x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2`, where `x = lambda + 1` and `y = j`:\n`p(lambda) = (lambda + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p(lambda) = (lambda^2 + 2*lambda + 1) - (-1)`\n`p(lambda) = lambda^2 + 2*lambda + 2`\nThis is our target characteristic polynomial for the closed-loop system `A + BF`.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the closed-loop matrix `A + BF`.**\nFirst, we calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [1, 2; 1, 0] * [f11, f12; f21, f22]`\n`BF = [1*f11 + 2*f21, 1*f12 + 2*f22; 1*f11 + 0*f21, 1*f12 + 0*f22]`\n`BF = [f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22; f11, f12]`\n\nNext, we add `A` to `BF`:\n`A + BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22; f11, f12]`\n`A + BF = [-1 + f11 + 2*f21, 1 + f12 + 2*f22; 1 + f11, f12]`\n\n**Step 4: Find the characteristic polynomial of `A + BF`.**\nThe characteristic polynomial for a generic 2x2 matrix `M = [a, b; c, d]` is `lambda^2 - trace(M)*lambda + det(M)`.\nFor our closed-loop matrix `A + BF`:\n*   `trace(A + BF) = (-1 + f11 + 2*f21) + (f12) = f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1`\n*   `det(A + BF) = (-1 + f11 + 2*f21)*f12 - (1 + f12 + 2*f22)*(1 + f11)`\n\nSo the characteristic polynomial is:\n`lambda^2 - (f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1)*lambda + [(-1 + f11 + 2*f21)*f12 - (1 + f12 + 2*f22)*(1 + f11)]`\n\n**Step 5: Equate coefficients and solve for the elements of F.**\nWe match the coefficients of this polynomial with our desired polynomial `lambda^2 + 2*lambda + 2`.\n\n*   **Matching the coefficient of `lambda`:**\n    `-(f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1) = 2`\n    `f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1 = -2`\n    `f11 + f12 + 2*f21 = -1`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Matching the constant term:**\n    `(-1 + f11 + 2*f21)*f12 - (1 + f12 + 2*f22)*(1 + f11) = 2` (Equation 2)\n\n**Careful Point:**\nWe have two equations and four unknowns (`f11`, `f12`, `f21`, `f22`). This means there are infinite possible solutions for `F`. This is a common feature of pole placement in multi-input systems. We can find one specific solution by making a simplifying assumption. A common simplification is to set some elements of `F` to zero.\n\n**Step 6: Find a particular solution.**\nLet's assume that we only use the first control input (`u1`) for feedback, which means the second row of `F` is zero.\nSet `f21 = 0` and `f22 = 0`.\n\nNow our equations become:\n*   From Equation 1:\n    `f11 + f12 + 2*(0) = -1`\n    `f11 + f12 = -1`  => `f11 = -1 - f12`\n\n*   From Equation 2:\n    `(-1 + f11 + 2*(0))*f12 - (1 + f12 + 2*(0))*(1 + f11) = 2`\n    `(-1 + f11)*f12 - (1 + f12)*(1 + f11) = 2`\n\nNow substitute `f11 = -1 - f12` into the second simplified equation:\n`(-1 + (-1 - f12))*f12 - (1 + f12)*(1 + (-1 - f12)) = 2`\n`(-2 - f12)*f12 - (1 + f12)*(-f12) = 2`\n`-2*f12 - f12^2 - (-f12 - f12^2) = 2`\n`-2*f12 - f12^2 + f12 + f12^2 = 2`\n`-f12 = 2`\n`f12 = -2`\n\nNow, find `f11` using `f11 = -1 - f12`:\n`f11 = -1 - (-2)`\n`f11 = 1`\n\nSo, one possible solution for the gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [1, -2; 0, 0]`\n\n**Step 7: Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\nLet's check if this `F` gives the desired eigenvalues.\n`A + BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [1, 2; 1, 0]*[1, -2; 0, 0]`\n`A + BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [1, -2; 1, -2]`\n`A + BF = [0, -1; 2, -2]`\nThe characteristic equation is `det(lambda*I - (A+BF)) = 0`.\n`det([lambda, 1; -2, lambda + 2]) = 0`\n`lambda*(lambda + 2) - (1)*(-2) = 0`\n`lambda^2 + 2*lambda + 2 = 0`\nThis matches our desired characteristic polynomial, confirming the eigenvalues are `-1 +/- j`.\n\n<<<[1, -2; 0, 0]>>>"
