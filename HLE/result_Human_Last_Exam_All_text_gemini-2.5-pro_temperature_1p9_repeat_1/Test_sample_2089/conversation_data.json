    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks to identify a specific Oscar-nominated film based on a key scene. The scene's elements are:\n    *   A character performs an action that \"seals his fate.\"\n    *   The action is specifically saying the words \"Thank you.\"\n    *   This action occurs while the character is boarding a bus.\n    *   The film must have been nominated for at least one Academy Award (Oscar).\n\n2.  **Initial Scene Recall and Filtering:** This is a very specific clue, suggesting a well-written moment of revelation in a thriller or drama. The fatal action isn't violent in itself but rather an informational giveaway. The challenge is to recall films with pivotal bus scenes.\n\n3.  **Candidate Film Identification:** The most prominent film that features this exact sequence is ***L.A. Confidential*** **(1997)**. This film was a critical success and received nine Oscar nominations, including for Best Picture, winning for Best Supporting Actress (Kim Basinger) and Best Adapted Screenplay. This fits the \"Oscar-nominated\" criterion perfectly.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Scene in *L.A. Confidential***:\n    *   **The Protagonist:** Detective Lieutenant Ed Exley (played by Guy Pearce) has deduced that his superior, Captain Dudley Smith (played by James Cromwell), is a deeply corrupt officer and the mastermind behind a series of murders.\n    *   **The Antagonist (in this scene):** Exley knows Smith will send men to kill him, but he doesn't know who Smith's enforcers are. He observes Smith from a distance and sees him giving instructions to a plain-clothed man. This man is Detective Ray Collins, one of Smith's corrupt cronies.\n    *   **The Setting and Action:** To follow Exley without being conspicuous, Collins boards a public bus. As he pays his fare and steps onto the bus, he reflexively says, **\"Thank you\"** to the driver.\n    *   **Sealing His Fate:** Exley, who is watching the interaction, has a moment of revelation. He recognizes this small gesture as a professional \"tell.\" His logic is that a regular citizen wouldn't bother to thank a bus driver, but a police officer—a fellow public servant—would do so out of professional courtesy or habit. This act confirms to Exley that the man is a cop and therefore part of Smith's crew.\n    *   **The Consequence:** By revealing his identity, Collins unwittingly gives Exley the crucial piece of information he needs to anticipate Smith's plan and set a trap. This knowledge directly leads Exley to orchestrate the final confrontation at the Victory Motel, where Detective Collins is subsequently killed in the ensuing shootout. Thus, his simple, polite \"Thank you\" directly leads to his death, sealing his fate.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Character Identification:** The character is not a main protagonist or antagonist, but a supporting antagonist, Detective Ray Collins. This can make the scene slightly harder to recall than one involving a main character.\n*   **The Nature of the \"Mistake\":** The fatal error is not a malicious act or a slip-up under pressure, but an ingrained habit of politeness. This is a subtle but key element of the film's sophisticated screenwriting.\n*   **Cause and Effect:** It's important to trace the direct line from the character saying \"Thank you\" to his eventual demise. The phrase leads to his identification, which allows the hero to plan the trap where the character dies.\n*   **Oscar Nominations:** Verifying the film's Oscar nominations is a final check. *L.A. Confidential* was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress (won), Best Adapted Screenplay (won), Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound.\n\nBy combining all these points, the analysis confidently points to one specific film.\n\n***\n\n<<<L.A. Confidential>>>"
