    "This problem asks for the evaluation of an inner product, $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, within the framework of finite-temperature quantum field theory for a neutral scalar field. Let's break down the problem into clear, sequential steps.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Context and Definitions**\n\n*   **Finite-Temperature Field Theory:** We use the imaginary time formalism. Spacetime is Euclidean, with the time coordinate $\\tau$ compactified to the interval $[0, \\beta]$, where $\\beta = 1/T$ (and $k_B=1$). $T$ is the temperature.\n*   **Neutral Scalar Field ($\\phi$):** This is a bosonic field, so it must satisfy periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction: $\\phi(0, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\beta, \\vec{x})$.\n*   **Functional Integral:** The partition function $Z$ is given by a functional integral (or path integral) over all possible field configurations:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n*   **Euclidean Action ($S_E$):** For a free, massive, neutral scalar field, the Euclidean action is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_E$ over Euclidean spacetime:\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\mathcal{L}_E$\n    where, $\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial_\\mu \\phi) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2$.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Inner Product**\n\nIn a function space, the inner product of two real-valued functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ over a domain $\\Omega$ is generally defined as:\n$(f, g) = \\int_{\\Omega} d^{d+1}x \\, f(x) g(x)$\nFor our scalar field $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$, the domain is the $(d+1)$-dimensional Euclidean spacetime. So, the inner product $(\\phi, \\psi)$ is:\n$(\\phi, \\psi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\psi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Operator $D$**\n\nThe notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ suggests that the action can be written in a quadratic form, $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$, which is typical for Gaussian integrals. To find the explicit form of the operator $D$, we rewrite the action using integration by parts.\n\nLet's look at the kinetic term in the action: $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)$.\n1.  **Time derivative term:**\n    $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 = [\\phi \\, \\partial_\\tau \\phi]_0^\\beta - \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi)$\n    Due to the periodic boundary conditions for the bosonic field $\\phi$, the boundary term $[\\phi \\, \\partial_\\tau \\phi]_0^\\beta$ vanishes.\n2.  **Spatial derivative term:**\n    $\\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, (\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi)^2 = - \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\phi (\\vec{\\nabla}^2 \\phi)$\n    Here we assume that the field $\\phi$ vanishes sufficiently fast at spatial infinity, so the boundary terms from the integration by parts are zero.\n\nSubstituting these back into the action $S_E$:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\left[ -\\phi (\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi) - \\phi (\\vec{\\nabla}^2 \\phi) + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\nWe can factor out $\\phi$:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left[ -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\vec{\\nabla}^2) + m^2 \\right] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\nThis is now in the form $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$. By comparison, we identify the operator $D$ (referred to as $D_\\phi$ in the question, likely meaning the operator of the $\\phi$ field theory) as:\n$D = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\vec{\\nabla}^2) + m^2 = -\\partial_E^2 + m^2$\nwhere $\\partial_E^2 = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\vec{\\nabla}^2$ is the Euclidean Laplacian.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Inner Product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$**\n\nThe question asks for the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$. Based on our definitions from Step 2 and Step 3:\n*   $D_\\phi$ means the operator $D$ acting on the field $\\phi$: $D\\phi = (-\\partial_E^2 + m^2)\\phi$.\n*   The inner product is the integral of $\\phi$ times $D\\phi$.\n\nTherefore:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) (D\\phi)(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left[ -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\vec{\\nabla}^2) + m^2 \\right] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The use of integration by parts is justified by the periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time for bosons and the assumption that fields vanish at spatial infinity. These are standard in this context.\n*   **Notation:** The notation $D_\\phi$ is slightly ambiguous but is most naturally interpreted in this context as the kinetic operator $D$ associated with the field $\\phi$.\n*   **Relation to Action:** A key insight is that $(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2 S_E[\\phi]$. The inner product is precisely twice the free Euclidean action. This relation is fundamental for evaluating Gaussian functional integrals.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nFollowing the steps above, the inner product is found by substituting the explicit form of the operator $D$ into the definition of the inner product. This results in the integral expression derived in Step 4.\n\n<<<The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is given by the expression: $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\vec{\\nabla}^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$, which is equal to twice the Euclidean action for the free field, $2S_E[\\phi]$.>>>"
