    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Host Organism:** The organism being engineered is *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, a well-known bacterium used for industrial-scale production of amino acids and other chemicals.\n2.  **Target Product:** The goal is to produce p-coumaric acid (also known as 4-coumaric acid or coumarate).\n3.  **Engineering Strategy:** The necessary biosynthetic genes to produce p-coumaric acid have been introduced. This typically involves genes like tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) or a two-step pathway with Phenylalanine/Tyrosine Ammonia Lyase (PAL) and Cinnamate-4-Hydroxylase (C4H).\n4.  **The Problem:** Despite successful biosynthesis, the final product, p-coumaric acid, is being degraded by the host organism. This is a common issue in metabolic engineering where the host cell has native pathways that consume the target product.\n5.  **The Goal:** Identify the specific native gene in *Corynebacterium glutamicum* that is responsible for the initial step of p-coumaric acid degradation. Knocking out this gene should prevent the product loss.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Pathway Identification:** It is crucial to identify the correct catabolic (degradation) pathway for p-coumaric acid that is active in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*. Aromatic compounds like p-coumaric acid can often serve as carbon sources for bacteria.\n*   **Enzyme Specificity:** We need to find the specific enzyme that acts directly on p-coumaric acid to begin its degradation.\n*   **Gene Name Convention:** Gene names can vary between species. The answer must be the specific gene name used for *C. glutamicum*.\n*   **Targeting the First Step:** The most effective strategy to prevent product loss is to block the very first enzymatic step in the degradation pathway. This prevents both the loss of the target compound and the accumulation of potentially toxic downstream intermediates.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Investigating p-coumaric acid metabolism in bacteria:** In many bacteria, including *C. glutamicum*, phenolic acids like p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid are degraded starting with a decarboxylation reaction. This is a non-oxidative decarboxylation that removes the carboxyl group from the propenoic acid side chain.\n2.  **Identifying the specific reaction:** The first step in the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *C. glutamicum* is its conversion to 4-vinylphenol (also called p-hydroxystyrene). The reaction is:\n    *   p-Coumaric acid → 4-Vinylphenol + CO₂\n3.  **Identifying the responsible enzyme:** The enzyme that catalyzes this specific reaction is called **p-coumarate decarboxylase** or, more broadly, **phenolic acid decarboxylase (PDC)**.\n4.  **Identifying the corresponding gene in *Corynebacterium glutamicum***: Research and genome annotation for *C. glutamicum* have identified the gene that encodes the phenolic acid decarboxylase enzyme. This gene is commonly designated as **`phdC`**. Knocking out the `phdC` gene has been experimentally proven to eliminate the cell's ability to decarboxylate p-coumaric acid, leading to its accumulation.\n\nTherefore, to prevent the degradation of the produced p-coumaric acid, the `phdC` gene should be knocked out.\n\n<<<phdC>>>"
