    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the colours defining the range.**\nThe question specifies a range on Newton's colour circle. We first need to identify the starting and ending colours of this range.\n*   **Starting Colour:** The range begins with \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In subtractive colour theory (like mixing pigments) or when considering the colour spectrum, the colour that lies between yellow and blue is **Green**. This is the context of Newton's wheel, which is derived from the spectrum.\n*   **Ending Colour:** The range ends at **Blue**.\n*   Therefore, the specified range is from **Green to Blue**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Newton's Colour and Music Correspondence.**\nIsaac Newton famously created a colour circle that linked the seven colours of the visible spectrum to the seven notes of a musical scale. He was trying to find mathematical harmony between different natural phenomena. The specific correspondence he proposed was based on the proportions of the Dorian musical mode, which, in modern terms, is often mapped as follows:\n*   Red → D (Re)\n*   Orange → E (Mi)\n*   Yellow → F (Fa)\n*   **Green → G (Sol)**\n*   **Blue → A (La)**\n*   Indigo → B (Ti)\n*   Violet → C (Do)\n\n**Step 3: Map the Colour Range to the Musical Notes.**\nBased on the correspondence established in Step 2, we can map our colour range to the musical scale:\n*   The starting colour, **Green**, corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n*   The ending colour, **Blue**, corresponds to the musical note **A**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Answer.**\nThe question asks for the singular \"musical note\" that corresponds to the range from Green to Blue. Since the range begins with Green, and the note directly corresponding to the colour Green is G, this is the most logical answer. The note G represents the start and the primary identity of the first part of this two-colour range.\n\n<<<G>>>"
