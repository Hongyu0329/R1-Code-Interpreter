    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Key Terms:**\n    *   **Phenotype:** A measurable trait of an organism, such as height, blood pressure, or risk for a disease.\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population-level parameter. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype that can be explained by the additive effects of all single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered, typically all common SNPs on a standard genotyping chip. It is a theoretical ceiling for prediction based on these SNPs. It answers the question: \"If we had perfect knowledge of the true causal effect of every single SNP, what is the maximum proportion of the trait's variance we could explain?\"\n    *   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is an individual-level score calculated for a person. It is constructed by summing up the number of risk-associated alleles an individual carries, with each allele's contribution weighted by its estimated effect size. These effect sizes are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n    *   **Predictive Ability of a PGS (measured by variance explained):** This is the R-squared (R²) value obtained when you test how well the PGS predicts the phenotype in a new set of individuals (a target sample). It answers the practical question: \"How well does our *current*, imperfect genetic predictor actually work?\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Relationship and Careful Points:**\n    *   **Theoretical Maximum vs. Practical Application:** The core of the question lies in the distinction between a theoretical maximum (SNP heritability) and a practical, real-world tool (the polygenic score).\n    *   **Perfect vs. Estimated Information:** SNP heritability (h²_SNP) assumes perfect information about the *true* effect sizes of all SNPs. A polygenic score (PGS) is built using *estimated* effect sizes from a GWAS discovery sample.\n    *   **Sources of Error:** The estimation of SNP effects is inherently imperfect due to several factors:\n        *   **Finite Sample Size:** A GWAS is performed on a finite number of people. This leads to statistical noise and uncertainty in the effect size estimates.\n        *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** Genes are inherited in blocks. This makes it difficult to distinguish the true causal SNP from other nearby SNPs that are highly correlated with it, leading to inaccurate effect size estimation for any single SNP.\n        *   **Winner's Curse:** SNPs that pass a stringent statistical significance threshold in a GWAS often have their effect sizes overestimated.\n    *   **Consequence of Imperfection:** Because the weights used to build the PGS are noisy estimates of the true effects, the resulting score is a \"degraded\" or imperfect version of the true genetic value. Any noise or error in a predictor will reduce its ability to predict an outcome.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Logic to Acquire the Final Answer:**\n    *   **Premise 1:** SNP heritability represents the variance explained by a perfect linear predictor using all specified SNPs. It is the ideal, upper bound of predictability.\n    *   **Premise 2:** A polygenic score is an attempt to build such a linear predictor, but it must rely on estimated, not true, SNP effects.\n    *   **Premise 3:** The process of estimation from finite data (a GWAS) introduces errors and noise into the effect size estimates.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Therefore, the PGS, being an imperfect and noisy predictor, will explain less variance than the ideal, perfect predictor. Its predictive ability (R²) is consequently lower than the theoretical maximum defined by the SNP heritability (h²_SNP). The gap between the two is a direct consequence of the information lost during the estimation process. The term \"necessarily\" is correct in this context because it is a fundamental principle that an estimator based on incomplete or noisy information cannot outperform a theoretical ideal based on perfect information.\n\n<<<True"
