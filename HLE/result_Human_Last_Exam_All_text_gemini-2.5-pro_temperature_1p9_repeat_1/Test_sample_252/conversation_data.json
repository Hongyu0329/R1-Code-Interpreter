    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n*   **Core Task:** Determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings required for a specific imaging task.\n*   **The Imaging Task:** Construct a \"full spectral volume\". In hyperspectral imaging, this typically refers to a data cube of the form (x, y, λ), where (x, y) are the spatial coordinates of a scene and λ is the wavelength of light. The term \"volume\" can be slightly ambiguous, but in this context, it refers to this 3D data set.\n*   **Key Constraint 1:** The reconstruction must be done \"from a single image\". This means the system must be a \"snapshot\" imager, capturing all the necessary information in one exposure on a 2D detector. We cannot rotate the object, the camera, or change filters between shots.\n*   **Key Constraint 2:** The reconstruction method is \"computed tomography\" (CT). This is a crucial clue. CT reconstructs a higher-dimensional object from a series of lower-dimensional projections taken from different angles.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the \"Computed Tomography\" Analogy in Imaging\n1.  **Standard CT (e.g., Medical CAT Scan):** A 3D object (the patient) is reconstructed from a series of 2D X-ray images (projections). These projections are acquired by rotating an X-ray source and detector around the object. The different rotation angles provide the different \"views\" needed for reconstruction.\n2.  **Spectral Imaging CT (as implied by the question):** The \"object\" we want to reconstruct is the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)`. Our \"detector\" is a 2D camera sensor, which captures a 2D image `g(u, v)`. To use CT principles, the single 2D image `g(u, v)` must contain multiple projections of the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)`.\n3.  **How to get multiple projections in one snapshot?** This is achieved by using a dispersive element, like a diffraction grating, in the optical path. The grating splits the incoming light into multiple diffraction orders. Each diffraction order can be thought of as a different \"projection\" of the source data cube onto the detector plane.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Role and Number of Gratings\nLet's consider the number of gratings and the resulting projections.\n\n*   **Case 1: Zero Gratings**\n    *   Without any gratings, the system is just a standard camera. It integrates all wavelengths (λ) at each spatial point (x, y) to produce a 2D intensity image. All spectral information is lost. It is impossible to reconstruct the spectral volume.\n\n*   **Case 2: One Diffraction Grating**\n    *   A single 1D diffraction grating will disperse light along one axis. For instance, a grating with vertical lines will spread the spectrum of each point source (x, y) horizontally.\n    *   The detector would see a central, undispersed image (the 0th order) and a series of dispersed images on either side (the ±1, ±2, ... orders), all lying along a single line.\n    *   **The Problem:** This is analogous to a CT scanner where you only take projections along a single axis (e.g., only from the front and back, but not the sides). This is known as a \"limited angle\" or \"missing wedge\" problem in tomography. You have information to resolve one spatial dimension and the spectral dimension (e.g., `x` and `λ`), but you have collapsed all information along the other spatial dimension (`y`). You cannot uniquely reconstruct the full `f(x, y, λ)` data cube from this degenerate set of projections.\n\n*   **Case 3: Two Diffraction Gratings**\n    *   To solve the problem of degenerate projections, we need to create projections from multiple, non-collinear directions. This can be achieved by dispersing light in two dimensions.\n    *   The standard way to do this is to use a **crossed grating**. A crossed grating can be constructed by placing two 1D diffraction gratings in series, with their grating lines oriented perpendicular to each other (e.g., one with horizontal lines and one with vertical lines).\n    *   This two-grating system functions as a 2D disperser. It creates a 2D grid of diffraction orders on the detector (e.g., orders (0,0), (±1,0), (0,±1), (±1,±1), etc.).\n    *   The 0th order is the undispersed image. The (±1, 0) orders are dispersed horizontally. The (0, ±1) orders are dispersed vertically. The (±1, ±1) orders are dispersed diagonally.\n    *   This 2D pattern of projections provides views of the `f(x, y, λ)` data cube from multiple, distinct \"angles\". This information is sufficient for a tomographic reconstruction algorithm to recover the original data cube. This specific technique is known as a Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS).\n\n### Careful Points Summary\n1.  **\"Spectral Volume\"**: Refers to the (x, y, λ) data cube.\n2.  **\"Single Image\"**: Implies a snapshot technique; all data is captured simultaneously.\n3.  **\"Computed Tomography\"**: The key concept. It requires multiple projections from different viewing angles to work.\n4.  **Role of Gratings**: To create the multiple \"projections\" on a single detector. Each diffraction order is one projection.\n5.  **Minimum Requirement**: To reconstruct a 3D object (`f(x, y, λ)`), the projections must not be degenerate (i.e., not all from the same axis). This requires dispersion in two dimensions.\n6.  **Realization**: 2D dispersion is minimally achieved by using two 1D gratings crossed at a non-zero angle (typically 90 degrees).\n\n### Conclusion\nA single diffraction grating provides only a 1D set of projections, which is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction of the 2D spatial plus spectral data cube. A minimum of two crossed gratings are necessary to create a 2D set of projections, enabling the use of computed tomography algorithms to reconstruct the full spectral volume from a single image.\n\n<<<B>>>"
