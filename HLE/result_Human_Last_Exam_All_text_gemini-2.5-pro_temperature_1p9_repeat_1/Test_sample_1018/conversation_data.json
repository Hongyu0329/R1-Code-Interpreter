    "This problem asks for the computation of the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. We will solve this problem by applying two fundamental results in the theory of simplicial volume, due to Gromov.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand Simplicial Volume and Key Formulas**\n\nThe simplicial volume of a closed, oriented, connected n-manifold $M$, denoted by $\\|M\\|$, is a topological invariant defined as:\n$$ \\|M\\| = \\inf \\left\\{ \\sum_{i} |c_i| \\mid \\sum_{i} c_i \\sigma_i \\text{ is a real singular cycle representing the fundamental class } [M] \\in H_n(M, \\mathbb{R}) \\right\\} $$\nWe will use two key formulas for our computation:\n\n1.  **The Simplicial Volume of a Surface:** For a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$, its simplicial volume is given by:\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 0$ if $g=0$ or $g=1$.\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g - 4$ if $g \\ge 2$.\n    This result is derived from the fact that for $g \\ge 2$, $\\Sigma_g$ admits a hyperbolic metric, and its simplicial volume is proportional to its Riemannian volume. The Euler characteristic is $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$, and $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2(2g-2) = 4g-4$.\n\n2.  **The Product Formula:** For two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$, the simplicial volume of their product $M \\times N$ is given by Gromov's product formula:\n    $$ \\|M \\times N\\| = C_{\\dim M, \\dim N} \\|M\\| \\|N\\| $$\n    where $C_{\\dim M, \\dim N} = \\binom{\\dim M + \\dim N}{\\dim M}$. The equality holds if at least one of the factors has a non-zero simplicial volume (which is true in our case as we will see).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Simplicial Volume of Each Factor Surface**\n\nWe are given the surfaces $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{31}$:**\n    The genus is $g_1 = 31$. Since $31 \\ge 2$, we can use the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g-4$.\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n    The dimension of this surface is $\\dim(\\Sigma_{31}) = 2$.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{17}$:**\n    The genus is $g_2 = 17$. Since $17 \\ge 2$, we again use the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g-4$.\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n    The dimension of this surface is $\\dim(\\Sigma_{17}) = 2$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Product Formula**\n\nNow we can compute the simplicial volume of the product manifold $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$. Let $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$.\nWe have:\n*   $\\|M\\| = \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 120$\n*   $\\|N\\| = \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 64$\n*   $\\dim(M) = 2$\n*   $\\dim(N) = 2$\n\nSince both $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\|$ and $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$ are non-zero, the product formula holds as an equality.\nThe dimension of the product manifold is $\\dim(M \\times N) = \\dim(M) + \\dim(N) = 2+2=4$.\nThe combinatorial coefficient is:\n$$ \\binom{\\dim M + \\dim N}{\\dim M} = \\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6 $$\nNow, we substitute these values into the product formula:\n$$ \\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\binom{4}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| $$\n$$ \\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64 $$\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\n\nWe perform the final multiplication:\n$$ 6 \\times 120 = 720 $$\n$$ 720 \\times 64 = 46080 $$\nTherefore, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 46080.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   Correctly identify the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface. It is non-zero only for genus $g \\ge 2$.\n*   Verify that the conditions for the surface formula apply to both $\\Sigma_{31}$ ($g=31 \\ge 2$) and $\\Sigma_{17}$ ($g=17 \\ge 2$).\n*   Correctly state and apply Gromov's product formula. The equality holds because the factors have non-zero simplicial volumes.\n*   Correctly calculate the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n+m}{n}$. For our case, this is $\\binom{4}{2}=6$.\n*   Perform the arithmetic multiplication carefully to arrive at the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is obtained by combining the calculated values according to the formula.\n\n$Final Answer = 6 \\times (4 \\times 31 - 4) \\times (4 \\times 17 - 4) = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64 = 46080$.\n\n<<<46080>>>"
