    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Location of Waskaganish**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec, Canada. It is situated on the south-east shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate geographic coordinates are 51.19° N latitude, 78.76° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Surrounding Provinces and Territories**\nWe need to consider the provinces and territories that are near this location in Quebec.\n*   **Quebec:** This is the province where Waskaganish is located, so it must be excluded from the final answer as per the question.\n*   **Ontario:** This province borders Quebec to the west and south. The provincial border runs overland south of James Bay and extends northwards into the bay itself.\n*   **Nunavut:** This territory lies to the north of Quebec. Crucially, Nunavut's territory includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay, even those close to the Quebec coast.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** This province borders Quebec to the east, but the border is a significant distance away from Waskaganish.\n*   **New Brunswick:** This province borders Quebec far to the south and is not a contender.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of the Candidates (Ontario and Nunavut)**\nThe two main candidates for the closest province or territory are Ontario and Nunavut.\n\n*   **Proximity to Ontario:** The land border between Quebec and Ontario is located to the southwest of the community of Waskaganish. Using a map, the straight-line distance from the settlement of Waskaganish to the closest point on the Ontario land border is relatively short, approximately 70 to 80 kilometers (about 45 to 50 miles).\n\n*   **Proximity to Nunavut:** The closest part of Nunavut to Waskaganish is Akimiski Island, which is the largest island in James Bay. The island lies to the northwest of Waskaganish. The shortest distance from Waskaganish across the water to the southeastern coast of Akimiski Island is approximately 130 to 140 kilometers (about 80 to 87 miles).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\nComparing the two shortest distances:\n*   Distance to Ontario border: ~70-80 km\n*   Distance to Nunavut (Akimiski Island): ~130-140 km\n\nThe distance to the land border of the province of Ontario is significantly shorter than the distance to the nearest landmass of the territory of Nunavut.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The question specifies \"province or territory,\" so both Ontario and Nunavut are valid possibilities to consider.\n*   One must be aware that the islands in James Bay belong to Nunavut, not Quebec or Ontario. This makes Nunavut a potential candidate.\n*   The proximity must be calculated from the gathering place (the community of Waskaganish) to the *closest point* of another province or territory, which in Ontario's case is the land border.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\nBased on the analysis, the overland distance to the Ontario border is substantially less than the over-water distance to the closest part of Nunavut. Therefore, Ontario is the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
