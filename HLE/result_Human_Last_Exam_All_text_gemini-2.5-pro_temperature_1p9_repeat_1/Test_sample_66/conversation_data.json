    "This problem asks for the maximal possible rank of a matrix derived from the flag of Tonga. We are free to choose the values `a` (for red pixels) and `b` (for white pixels) to maximize this rank.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the geometry of the flag of Tonga\nThe flag of Tonga has two main colors: red and white.\n- The main field of the flag is red.\n- There is a white canton (a rectangular area) in the upper-left corner (the hoist side).\n- Inside this white canton, there is a red \"couped\" cross (a plus symbol that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n\n### Step 2: Represent the flag as a matrix\nLet's model an image of the flag as an `m x n` matrix `M`. We assign the value `a` to every red pixel and `b` to every white pixel.\nThe structure of the matrix `M` can be represented as a block matrix. Let the canton occupy the top `p` rows and the left `q` columns.\n\n`M = [ A | B ]`\n    `[ C | D ]`\n\n-   **Blocks B, C, D:** These represent the main red field of the flag. Therefore, every element in these blocks is `a`.\n-   **Block A:** This represents the canton. It has a white background (value `b`) with a red cross (value `a`). The red cross consists of one or more consecutive rows (the horizontal bar) and one or more consecutive columns (the vertical bar).\n\n### Step 3: Identify the types of rows in the matrix\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's identify the unique types of rows that can exist in the matrix `M`. A row's structure depends on what part of the flag it represents.\n\nThere are three horizontal regions of the flag that a row can pass through:\n1.  **Rows at the level of the horizontal bar of the cross:** A row at this level passes through the red horizontal bar within the canton, and then through the main red field to the right of the canton.\n    - Inside the canton (first `q` columns): All values are `a` (red cross).\n    - Outside the canton (remaining `n-q` columns): All values are `a` (red field).\n    Thus, any such row is an **all-`a` row**: `[a, a, ..., a]`.\n\n2.  **Rows at the level of the canton, but not on the horizontal bar:** A row at this level passes through the white background of the canton (which includes the vertical part of the red cross) and then through the main red field.\n    - Inside the canton (first `q` columns): The row consists mostly of `b`s (white background) but has `a`s where it intersects the vertical red cross.\n    - Outside the canton (remaining `n-q` columns): All values are `a` (red field).\n    The structure of this row type is: `[b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b | a, ..., a]`. It contains both `a`s and `b`s.\n\n3.  **Rows below the canton:** Any row below the canton is entirely within the main red field.\n    - Thus, any such row is an **all-`a` row**: `[a, a, ..., a]`.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see there are only **two distinct types of rows** in the entire matrix `M`:\n-   **Type 1:** The all-`a` row, `R_1 = [a, a, ..., a]`.\n-   **Type 2:** The mixed row, `R_2 = [ ...mixed a's and b's... | ...all a's... ]`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the maximum number of linearly independent rows\nThe rank of matrix `M` is the dimension of the vector space spanned by these two row types, `span(R_1, R_2)`. The dimension of this space can be at most 2. The rank will be exactly 2 if we can choose `a` and `b` such that `R_1` and `R_2` are linearly independent. Otherwise, the rank will be 1 or 0.\n\nTo check for linear independence, we look for non-zero scalars `c_1, c_2` such that `c_1 * R_1 + c_2 * R_2 = 0`.\n`c_1 * [a, a, ..., a] + c_2 * R_2 = 0`\n\nLet's look at a specific column `j` that is outside the canton (i.e., `j > q`). For such a column, the `j`-th element of `R_1` is `a` and the `j`-th element of `R_2` is also `a`. The equation for this component is:\n`c_1 * a + c_2 * a = 0`\n`(c_1 + c_2) * a = 0`\n\nNow let's look at a column `k` inside the canton (`k <= q`) that corresponds to the white background (i.e., the `k`-th element of `R_2` is `b`). The `k`-th element of `R_1` is `a`. The equation for this component is:\n`c_1 * a + c_2 * b = 0`\n\nWe want to find the maximal rank, so we should choose `a` and `b` to make the rows linearly independent. Let's try to do so.\n-   Choose `a ≠ 0`. From the first equation `(c_1 + c_2) * a = 0`, we get `c_1 + c_2 = 0`, which means `c_1 = -c_2`.\n-   Substitute this into the second equation: `(-c_2) * a + c_2 * b = 0`, which simplifies to `c_2 * (b - a) = 0`.\n-   For this to force `c_2 = 0`, we must have `b - a ≠ 0`, which means `b ≠ a`.\n\nSo, if we choose `a` and `b` such that `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b` (for example, `a = 1, b = 2`), then the only solution is `c_2 = 0`, which implies `c_1 = 0`. This proves that `R_1` and `R_2` are linearly independent.\n\nSince there are two linearly independent row types, the dimension of the row space is 2. The rank of the matrix `M` is 2.\n\n### Step 5: Final conclusion\nWe have shown that by choosing appropriate values for `a` and `b` (any values where `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`), we can make the matrix have a rank of 2. It is not possible to have a rank greater than 2 because there are only two unique types of rows in the matrix. Therefore, the maximal possible rank is 2.\n\nFor instance, if we pick `a=b` (and non-zero), both row types become identical all-`a` rows, and the rank is 1. If we pick `a=0` and `b \\neq 0`, the all-`a` row becomes a zero row, and the mixed row becomes non-zero, resulting in a rank of 1. These choices give a rank lower than 2. The maximum is indeed 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
