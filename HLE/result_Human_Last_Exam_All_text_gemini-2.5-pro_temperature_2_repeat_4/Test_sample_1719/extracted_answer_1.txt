The homotopy-theoretic obstructions lie in the following groups:
1.  $\pi_1(SO(2k))$
2.  $\text{Hom}(H_{n-1}(X), \pi_n(SO(2k)))$ (which is isomorphic to $\pi_n(SO(2k))$)
And possibly in other groups of the form $\text{Hom}(H_{k-2}(X), \pi_{k-1}(SO(2k)))$ for $k > n+1$ if $X$ has higher-dimensional homology, but based on the problem statement, we assume only $H_{n-1}(X)$ is non-trivial.
