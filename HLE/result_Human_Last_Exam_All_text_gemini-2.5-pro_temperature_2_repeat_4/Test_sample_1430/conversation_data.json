    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Problem**\n\n*   **C:** A complex projective curve (or compact Riemann surface) of genus $g=3$.\n*   **X:** The 15th symmetric power of C, denoted $C^{(15)}$. This is the variety whose points correspond to effective divisors of degree 15 on C. $X$ is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi Group NS(X):** This is the group of divisor classes on X modulo algebraic equivalence. It is a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   **Rank of NS(X):** We are asked for the rank of this group, also known as the Picard number of X, denoted $\\rho(X)$.\n*   **\"Smallest and largest possible\":** This phrasing implies that $\\rho(X)$ is not a fixed number for all genus 3 curves but depends on the specific choice of the curve C. We need to find the minimum and maximum values that $\\rho(X)$ can take as C varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n#### **Step 1: Relate the Neron-Severi group of $C^{(15)}$ to the Jacobian of C**\n\nThe key to understanding the geometry of symmetric powers of a curve is the **Jacobian variety**.\n*   The Jacobian of C, denoted $J = Jac(C)$, is an abelian variety of dimension $g=3$. It parametrizes divisor classes of degree 0 on C.\n*   There is a canonical map called the **Abel-Jacobi map**, $u_d: C^{(d)} \\to J$, which sends an effective divisor $D$ of degree $d$ to the divisor class $[D - dP_0] \\in J$, where $P_0$ is a chosen base point on C.\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of algebraic curves describes the structure of this map:\n*   **Theorem:** If the degree $d$ is sufficiently large, specifically if $d \\ge 2g-1$, then the Abel-Jacobi map $u_d: C^{(d)} \\to J$ is a fibration whose fibers are projective spaces.\n\nLet's check the condition for our case:\n*   $g = 3$ and $d = 15$.\n*   $2g-1 = 2(3) - 1 = 5$.\n*   Since $15 \\ge 5$, the theorem applies.\n\nThe fiber over a point $\\alpha \\in J$ is the projective space of effective divisors linearly equivalent to any divisor $D$ with $u_d(D) = \\alpha$. By the Riemann-Roch theorem, for a general divisor of degree $d > 2g-2 = 4$, the dimension of this projective space is $d-g$. In our case, the dimension is $15 - 3 = 12$. So, $u_{15}: C^{(15)} \\to J$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over the Jacobian $J$.\n\n#### **Step 2: Use the structure of a projective bundle**\n\nWhen a variety X is a projective bundle over another variety Y (say, $X = \\mathbb{P}_Y(E)$ is the projectivization of a vector bundle E over Y), their Neron-Severi groups are closely related.\n*   **Theorem:** If $f: X \\to Y$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^n$-bundle, then $NS(X) \\cong f^*(NS(Y)) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot \\xi$, where $\\xi$ is the class of the relative hyperplane bundle.\n*   This implies a simple relation between their ranks: $\\rho(X) = \\rho(Y) + 1$.\n\nApplying this to our situation ($X=C^{(15)}$ and $Y=J=Jac(C)$), we get a crucial formula:\n$\\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(Jac(C)) + 1$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, $\\rho(Jac(C))$.\n\n#### **Step 3: Find the smallest possible rank for $\\rho(Jac(C))$**\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of a g-dimensional abelian variety $A$ is bounded by $1 \\le \\rho(A) \\le g^2$.\nFor $J=Jac(C)$ with $g=3$, we have $1 \\le \\rho(J) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n\n*   **Smallest Rank:** The minimum value $\\rho(J) = 1$ is achieved for a *generic* curve C. A generic curve is one that does not have any special properties. For such curves, the Jacobian $J=Jac(C)$ is a *simple* abelian variety (it does not contain any smaller abelian subvarieties) and its ring of endomorphisms is as small as possible: $End(J) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the Neron-Severi group is generated by a single class, the class of the principal polarization (theta divisor), so $\\rho(J)=1$.\n*   Therefore, the smallest possible rank for $NS(C^{(15)})$ is:\n    $\\rho_{min}(C^{(15)}) = \\rho_{min}(Jac(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n#### **Step 4: Find the largest possible rank for $\\rho(Jac(C))$**\n\n*   **Largest Rank:** The rank $\\rho(J)$ is maximized when the curve C is \"special\", meaning its Jacobian has extra endomorphisms. This phenomenon is known as **Complex Multiplication (CM)**. The theoretical upper bound is $\\rho(J) \\le g^2 = 9$.\n*   This maximum is achieved if $Jac(C)$ is of CM-type. For a Jacobian $J$ of a genus 3 curve, the maximum rank of 9 is achieved if, for instance, $J$ is isogenous to a product of three isogenous elliptic curves with complex multiplication.\n*   **Existence:** Such curves exist. A famous example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$. This is a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 3. Its Jacobian is isogenous to $E^3$, where $E$ is the elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. For this Jacobian, $\\rho(J) = g^2 = 9$.\n*   Therefore, the largest possible rank for $NS(C^{(15)})$ is:\n    $\\rho_{max}(C^{(15)}) = \\rho_{max}(Jac(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Correct Identification of X:** $C^{(15)}$ is the *symmetric power*, not the Cartesian product $C^{15}$. Its geometry is much richer.\n2.  **Abel-Jacobi Map as a Fibration:** The key step is recognizing that for high degree ($d \\ge 2g-1$), $C^{(d)}$ is a projective bundle over the Jacobian. One must verify this condition. Here, $d=15, g=3$ satisfies the condition.\n3.  **Picard Number of a Projective Bundle:** The formula $\\rho(X) = \\rho(Y) + 1$ is standard for $\\mathbb{P}^n$-bundles and is crucial to simplify the problem.\n4.  **Range of Picard Numbers for Jacobians:** The Picard number $\\rho(Jac(C))$ is not fixed. It varies between 1 (the generic case) and $g^2$ (the maximum CM case). It is essential to know that both extremes are actually achieved by some curves of genus 3.\n5.  **Generic vs. Special Curves:** The concept of a \"generic\" curve having minimal structures (like $End(J) = \\mathbb{Z}$) and \"special\" curves (like those with CM) having extra structures is central to why the rank can vary.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The smallest possible rank occurs for a generic genus 3 curve, for which $\\rho(Jac(C)) = 1$. The rank is $1+1=2$.\n*   The largest possible rank occurs for a genus 3 curve with maximal complex multiplication (e.g., the Fermat quartic), for which $\\rho(Jac(C)) = 9$. The rank is $9+1=10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest rank is 2 and the largest rank is 10.>>>"
