    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know the name of the fictional singer represented by a cardboard cutout at the Junior prom in a specific episode of \"Homestar Runner\".\n2.  **Pinpoint the Source:** The episode is explicitly identified as \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" from the \"Homestar Runner\" series.\n3.  **Locate the Scene:** The scene in question is the Junior prom that the Teen Girl Squad attends.\n4.  **Analyze the Dialogue:** Early in the prom scene, the character Cheerleader announces the musical entertainment. She exclaims, \"i got us backstage passes to the cardboard cutout of indie-folk-sensation, Kevyn!\"\n5.  **Examine the Visuals:** Shortly after the dialogue, the cartoon shows the stage. On the stage is a life-sized cardboard cutout of a male folk singer holding a guitar. The base of the cutout clearly has the name \"KEVYN\" written on it.\n6.  **Synthesize the Information:** Both the dialogue and the visual evidence confirm that the fictional singer is a cardboard cutout named \"Kevyn\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Fictional Character:** The singer, Kevyn, is a character created for the cartoon and does not exist in real life, fulfilling the \"fictional singer\" part of the question.\n*   **Cardboard Cutout:** The question specifies a cardboard cutout, and the episode's humor revolves around the fact that the \"performer\" is just a static image.\n*   **Spelling:** The name is spelled \"Kevyn,\" not the more common \"Kevin.\" Accuracy is important.\n*   **Performance:** The \"performance\" is satirical, as the cutout is inanimate. However, it is presented as the prom's musical guest.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nBased on the direct dialogue and visual text within the episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the name of the fictional singer is Kevyn.\n\n<<<Kevyn>>>"
