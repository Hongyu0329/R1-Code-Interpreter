    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand and model the space X.**\n\n1.  **Lattices:** A nondegenerate lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. It is generated by two linearly independent vectors $v_1, v_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. We can represent this basis by a matrix $A = (v_1 | v_2) \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n2.  **Area:** The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The \"unit area\" constraint means we consider lattices for which $|\\det(A)| = 1$. Let $S_1 = \\{A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(A)| = 1\\}$. This set is the disjoint union of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (where $\\det(A)=1$) and the set of matrices with determinant -1.\n3.  **Equivalence of Bases:** Two different bases $A_1, A_2$ generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by a change of basis matrix $G \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $A_2 = A_1 G$. Note that $|\\det(G)|=1$ as $G$ is an integer matrix with an integer inverse. So, the area of a lattice is independent of the choice of basis.\n4.  **Space of Unit Area Lattices:** The space of all unit area lattices, which we denote $\\mathcal{L}_1$, is the space of orbits of $S_1$ under the right action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. So, $\\mathcal{L}_1 = S_1 / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n5.  **The Moduli Space X:** The question specifies a moduli space where lattices are considered equivalent if they are rotations of each other. This means we must take the quotient of $\\mathcal{L}_1$ by the action of the rotation group $SO(2)$. A rotation $R \\in SO(2)$ acts on a lattice by acting on its basis vectors, so $A$ becomes $RA$. This is a left action.\n    Therefore, the moduli space is $X = SO(2) \\backslash \\mathcal{L}_1 = SO(2) \\backslash (S_1 / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the expression for X.**\n\n1.  Since the left action of $SO(2)$ and the right action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $S_1$ commute, we can write $X = (SO(2) \\backslash S_1) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n2.  Let's identify the space $SO(2) \\backslash S_1$. Consider the map $\\phi: S_1 \\to \\mathcal{P}_1$, where $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is the space of $2 \\times 2$ symmetric positive-definite matrices with determinant 1, given by $\\phi(A) = A^T A$.\n    *   Let $A \\in S_1$. $P = A^T A$ is symmetric, positive definite, and $\\det(P) = \\det(A^T A) = \\det(A)^2 = (\\pm 1)^2 = 1$. So $P \\in \\mathcal{P}_1$.\n    *   Consider the action of $R \\in SO(2)$ on $A$. $\\phi(RA) = (RA)^T(RA) = A^T R^T R A = A^T I A = A^T A$. So the map $\\phi$ is constant on the orbits of $SO(2)$.\n    *   This map induces a bijection $SO(2) \\backslash S_1 \\cong \\mathcal{P}_1$. A matrix $P \\in \\mathcal{P}_1$ has a unique positive-definite symmetric square root $A = P^{1/2}$, which has determinant 1, establishing the inverse map. Any other matrix in $S_1$ mapping to $P$ is of the form $RA$. Thus, we have the identification $X = \\mathcal{P}_1 / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n3.  The right action of $G \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $S_1$ induces an action on $\\mathcal{P}_1$. If a point in $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is represented by $P=A^TA$, its image under $G$ is $(AG)^T(AG) = G^T A^T A G = G^T P G$.\n    So, $X \\cong \\mathcal{P}_1 / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, with the action $P \\sim G^T P G$ for $G \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the homology of X.**\n\n1.  **Topology of $\\mathcal{P}_1$:** A matrix $P \\in \\mathcal{P}_1$ has the form $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ b & c \\end{pmatrix}$ with $ac-b^2=1$ and $a>0$. This space is homeomorphic to the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$, which is in turn homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is contractible and, in particular, simply connected.\n2.  **Orbifold structure:** The space $X$ is the quotient of a simply connected space $\\mathcal{P}_1$ by the discrete group action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This gives $X$ the structure of an orbifold. The action is not free (e.g., the identity matrix $I \\in \\mathcal{P}_1$ is fixed by all orthogonal matrices in $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$), so $X$ is not a manifold.\n3.  **Homology of Orbifolds:** For a good orbifold of the form $M/G$ where $M$ is simply connected, the first homology group is the abelianization of the acting group $G$.\n    $$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(\\mathcal{P}_1 / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})^{ab}$$\n    where $G^{ab} = G/[G, G]$ is the abelianization of the group $G$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the abelianization of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.**\n\nWe can compute $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})^{ab}$ using its group structure.\n\n1.  **Semidirect Product Structure:** $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ can be described by the short exact sequence:\n    $$1 \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\xrightarrow{\\det} \\{ \\pm 1 \\} \\to 1$$\n    This sequence splits. A section is given by mapping the generator of $\\{\\pm 1\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ to a matrix with determinant -1, for example, $J = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This shows that $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a semidirect product:\n    $$GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$$\n2.  **Abelianization of a Semidirect Product:** For a semidirect product $G = N \\rtimes H$, its abelianization is given by $G^{ab} \\cong (N^{ab})_H \\oplus H^{ab}$, where $(N^{ab})_H$ are the coinvariants of the action of $H$ on $N^{ab}$. The coinvariants are the quotient of $N^{ab}$ by the subgroup generated by elements of the form $h\\cdot x - x$ for $h\\in H, x\\in N^{ab}$.\n3.  **Applying the formula:**\n    *   $N = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ and $H = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   The abelianization of $N$ is well-known: $N^{ab} = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n    *   The abelianization of $H$ is $H^{ab} = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{ab} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   The action of the non-trivial element of $H$ on $N$ is by conjugation with $J = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This conjugation is an outer automorphism of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ that sends the standard generators $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ to their inverses, $S^{-1}$ and $T^{-1}$.\n    *   This induces an automorphism on $N^{ab} = \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ that maps every element to its inverse. In additive notation, this is the map $k \\mapsto -k$.\n    *   The coinvariants group is $(\\mathbb{Z}_{12})_H = \\mathbb{Z}_{12} / \\langle k - (-k) \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\rangle = \\mathbb{Z}_{12} / \\langle 2k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\rangle = \\mathbb{Z}_{12} / 2\\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n4.  **Final Result:** Putting it all together, we get:\n    $$GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})^{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_{12})_H \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$$\n\nTherefore, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$."
