    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the War and its In-Game Representation\nThe \"Second Great War\" is the official designation in StarCraft lore for the galaxy-wide conflict depicted in the *StarCraft II* trilogy. This includes the events of *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void* (including its epilogue, *Into the Void*).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Start Date of the War\nThe war begins at the start of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to official lore and timelines (such as the one provided in the *StarCraft: Field Manual*), this is four years after the conclusion of the Brood War. The Brood War ended in the year 2500, so the Second Great War began in **2504**.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the End Date of the War\nThe war officially concludes with the final defeat of the dark god Amon, which occurs in the *Into the Void* epilogue of *Legacy of the Void*. To pinpoint the year, we can reference subsequent material. The *Nova Covert Ops* mission pack, released after *Legacy of the Void*, explicitly states that its story begins in the year 2508, two years after Amon's final defeat. Working backward, this places the end of the Second Great War in the year **2506**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Precise Duration and Address In-Lore Inconsistencies\nWith a start year of 2504 and an end year of 2506, we need to calculate the elapsed time.\n\n*   **Start Point:** The war begins in 2504, specifically four years after the end of the Brood War (which ended mid-2500), placing the start around mid-2504.\n*   **End Point:** The war ends sometime in 2506.\n*   **Structure:** The campaigns of *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and the main *Legacy of the Void* campaign happen in relatively quick succession from 2504 into 2505. Then, there is a notable time gap before the final epilogue missions. In the opening narration of the epilogue, Kerrigan states, \"Two years have passed since his fall, since he was driven from Aiur,\" referring to the end of the main *Legacy of the Void* campaign.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  The initial campaigns (WoL, HotS, LotV Main) took roughly a year, running from approximately mid-2504 to mid-2505.\n    2.  Kerrigan's narration implies a two-year gap after that before the epilogue. This would place the end of the war in mid-2507, which contradicts the established end date of 2506.\n    3.  To resolve this common lore inconsistency, we must assume Kerrigan's \"two years\" is an approximation or slight exaggeration for narrative effect, and we rely on the more concrete timeline established by later content (2506 end date).\n    4.  Therefore, the actual timeline is: War starts mid-2504. The main campaigns end around mid-2505. A time gap of over a year passes. The final epilogue missions take place, concluding the war sometime in 2506.\n    5.  Let's calculate the duration from a start of mid-2504 to an end point of mid-2506 (as an example). This duration would be exactly 2 years. However, if the war ended in late 2506, the duration would be approximately 2.5 years.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Rounding Instruction\nThe question asks for the length \"in years, rounded up\". This means we must use the ceiling function; any fraction of a year pushes the total up to the next whole number.\n\n*   Based on the analysis, the war started in 2504 and ended in 2506.\n*   The total duration is certainly more than one year.\n*   Given the time for the initial campaigns (~1 year) and the subsequent time gap before the final missions, the total elapsed time from the start of *Wings of Liberty* to the end of the *Into the Void* epilogue is greater than two full years. For example, a start in July 2504 and an end in August 2506 is a duration of 2 years and 1 month (~2.08 years).\n*   Rounding any duration greater than 2.0 years up to the nearest whole number results in 3.\n\nThe conflict spanned parts of three calendar years (2504, 2505, 2506), and its total duration was just over two years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
