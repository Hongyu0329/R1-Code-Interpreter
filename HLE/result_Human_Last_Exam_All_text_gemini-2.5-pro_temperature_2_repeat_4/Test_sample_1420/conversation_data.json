    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Theoretical Framework\nThe question is about calculating a critical exponent, specifically the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$, within the framework of the Renormalization Group (RG) theory. The method to be used is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. This technique is designed to study critical phenomena in dimensions ($d$) below the upper critical dimension ($d_c$) by performing a perturbative expansion in the small parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the System Parameters\n1.  **Physical System:** The problem does not explicitly state the universality class (e.g., Ising, XY, Heisenberg). In the absence of this information, the standard convention is to consider the simplest and most common case, the Ising universality class. In the context of the O(n) model (or n-vector model), the Ising model corresponds to $n=1$.\n2.  **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** For the Ising model (and the general n-vector model), the upper critical dimension, above which mean-field theory is exact, is $d_c = 4$.\n3.  **Spatial Dimension ($d$):** The question specifies a spatial dimension of $d=3$.\n4.  **Expansion Parameter ($\\epsilon$):** The epsilon expansion parameter is defined as $\\epsilon = d_c - d$. For this problem, $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n### Step 3: The Epsilon Expansion Formula for $\\alpha$\nIn the RG treatment of the n-vector model (using the $\\phi^4$ theory), the critical exponents can be calculated as a power series in $\\epsilon$. The first-order result for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ is given by the well-known formula:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** This formula is derived from a direct RG analysis of the operator whose scaling determines the specific heat (the energy operator, $\\phi^2$). It is crucial to use the correct formula for the specific exponent requested.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This result is consistent with hyperscaling relations (e.g., $\\alpha = 2 - \\nu d$) order by order in the $\\epsilon$ expansion, provided one treats $d$ as $4-\\epsilon$. However, simply calculating another exponent like $\\nu$ to first order and plugging it into the $d=3$ hyperscaling relation ($\\alpha = 2 - 3\\nu$) will yield a different numerical estimate because of the truncation of the series expansion. The standard method is to use the direct expansion for the exponent in question.\n\n### Step 4: Substitute the Parameters and Calculate the Result\nNow, we substitute the parameters for our specific problem into the formula.\n1.  **Substitute n:** For the Ising model, we set $n=1$.\n    $$ \\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) = \\frac{3}{2(9)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) = \\frac{3}{18}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n    Simplifying the fraction gives:\n    $$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) $$\n\n2.  **Substitute $\\epsilon$:** To get the first-order approximation for the exponent in $d=3$, we set $\\epsilon = 1$.\n    $$ \\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6} $$\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** It is important to recognize that setting $\\epsilon=1$ is a significant extrapolation, as the expansion is formally valid only for small $\\epsilon$. Nevertheless, this procedure provides a first reasonable estimate beyond mean-field theory and is the standard answer expected for this type of problem. The first-order epsilon expansion gives an approximate value of $\\alpha=1/6 \\approx 0.167$, which is a decent improvement over the mean-field value of $\\alpha=0$ and compares reasonably with the more accurate modern value of $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$ for the 3D Ising model.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Formulation\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat in a 3D system of the Ising universality class, calculated using the first order of the epsilon expansion, is $1/6$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
