    "Answering this question requires performing a Lie symmetry analysis of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations**\n\nThe motion of an incompressible fluid with constant density $\\rho$ and kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ is described by the Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Let the independent variables be time $t$ and spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$, and the dependent variables be the velocity field $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and the pressure $p$. The equations are:\n\n*   **Momentum Equation:**\n    $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n    (We've set density $\\rho=1$ by rescaling the pressure)\n*   **Incompressibility Condition:**\n    $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\n**2. Lie Group of Symmetries**\n\nA Lie group of symmetries is a group of transformations of the independent and dependent variables that maps any solution of the system of equations to another solution. The analysis is performed by finding the Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators of this group. The general form of an infinitesimal generator is a vector field:\n$X = \\tau \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\xi_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\eta_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} + \\pi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$\nwhere the coefficients $\\tau, \\xi_i, \\eta_i, \\pi$ are functions of $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p)$.\n\n**3. Determining the Symmetry Algebra**\n\nThe core of the method is to apply the invariance condition. This means that the form of the Navier-Stokes equations must be preserved under the infinitesimal transformations generated by $X$. This procedure leads to a large, overdetermined system of linear partial differential equations for the coefficients $\\tau, \\xi_i, \\eta_i, \\pi$, known as the *determining equations*.\n\n**4. Solving the Determining Equations and the Structure of the Algebra**\n\nSolving this system is a standard but lengthy procedure in symmetry analysis. The key findings from this procedure are:\n\n*   **Infinite-Dimensional Symmetry:** The maximal Lie algebra of point symmetries admitted by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is actually infinite-dimensional.\n*   **Source of the Infinite Dimension:** The infinite part arises from the invariance of the equations under the transformation $p \\mapsto p + f(t)$, where $f(t)$ is an arbitrary smooth function of time. This is because only the gradient of the pressure, $\\nabla p$, appears in the momentum equation, so adding a function of time to $p$ does not change this term. The generators for this infinite-dimensional part can be written as $f(t)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\n*   **The Principal Lie Algebra:** Despite the algebra being infinite-dimensional, there is a well-defined finite-dimensional subalgebra that represents the \"geometrical\" and physical symmetries of the system. This is known as the *principal Lie algebra*. The full symmetry algebra is a semidirect sum of this finite-dimensional part and the infinite-dimensional ideal described above. When asked for \"the dimension\", it is conventional to provide the dimension of this principal finite-dimensional algebra.\n\n**5. Basis of the Finite-Dimensional Lie Algebra**\n\nThe basis for the principal Lie algebra consists of generators corresponding to the following physical transformations:\n\n1.  **Time Translation (1 generator):** The equations are autonomous (time-independent coefficients).\n    *   $T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$\n\n2.  **Spatial Translations (3 generators):** The equations are homogeneous (space-independent coefficients).\n    *   $P_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}$ for $i = 1, 2, 3$.\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations (3 generators):** The equations are covariant under rotations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (isotropic).\n    *   $J_i = \\sum_{j,k} \\epsilon_{ijk} \\left( x_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} + u_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_k} \\right)$ for $i=1, 2, 3$. These generate the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$.\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts (3 generators):** The equations are invariant under a change of inertial reference frame.\n    *   $G_i = t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n\n5.  **Scaling (or Dilation) (1 generator):** The equations possess a scaling symmetry.\n    *   $D = 2t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_i x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} - \\sum_i u_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} - 2p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\n\n6.  **Constant Pressure Shift (1 generator):** This corresponds to the $f(t) = \\text{constant}$ case from the infinite-dimensional family.\n    *   $P_p = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\n\n**6. Calculating the Dimension**\n\nTo find the dimension of this Lie group (or more accurately, its Lie algebra), we simply count the number of independent basis generators identified above:\n*   Time Translation: 1\n*   Spatial Translations: 3\n*   Spatial Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean Boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n*   Constant Pressure Shift: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe maximal Lie algebra of point symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional. However, it contains a finite-dimensional principal Lie algebra, and the dimension of this algebra is conventionally taken as the answer. By counting the basis generators for time translation, space translations, rotations, Galilean boosts, scaling, and constant pressure shift, we find the dimension of this algebra.\n\nThe dimension is $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\n<<<12>>>"
