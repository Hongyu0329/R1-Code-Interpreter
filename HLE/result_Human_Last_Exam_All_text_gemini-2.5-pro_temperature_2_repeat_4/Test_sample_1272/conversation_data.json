    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure and Context:** The question focuses on Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and his \"first major defeat\" in Vietnam. This places the event during the Ming Dynasty's occupation of Vietnam (1407-1427) and the subsequent Lam Sơn Uprising led by Lê Lợi.\n\n2.  **Examine Mu Sheng's Campaigns in Vietnam:**\n    *   **Initial Invasion (1406-1407):** Mu Sheng was one of the commanders of the Ming army that successfully invaded Vietnam and overthrew the Hồ Dynasty. This campaign was a victory, not a defeat.\n    *   **Lam Sơn Uprising (1418-1427):** The critical period is the later stage of the war. In 1427, the Ming Emperor dispatched two massive reinforcement armies to crush the Lam Sơn rebellion, which had besieged the main Ming force under Wang Tong in Đông Quan (modern Hanoi).\n    *   One army, under Liu Sheng (柳升), advanced from Guangxi.\n    *   The second army, commanded by Mu Sheng, advanced from Yunnan.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the \"First Major Defeat\":**\n    *   The Vietnamese strategy, devised by Lê Lợi and Nguyễn Trãi, was to focus on and destroy Liu Sheng's more aggressive army first, and then turn to face Mu Sheng.\n    *   Liu Sheng's army was catastrophically defeated and he was killed at the Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang (in modern-day Lạng Sơn and Bắc Giang provinces) in October 1427.\n    *   Upon receiving news of Liu Sheng's complete annihilation, Mu Sheng's army, which had advanced from Yunnan and was waiting for Liu Sheng's progress, lost its morale and began a panicked retreat back to China.\n    *   This retreat marks the occasion of Mu Sheng's major defeat. It wasn't a single pitched battle that he chose to fight, but rather a routing during a retreat. This was his first significant and personal failure as a field commander during this conflict.\n\n4.  **Identify the Location of the Defeat:**\n    *   The Vietnamese forces, under the command of generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, had anticipated this move. They had set up ambushes along Mu Sheng's retreat route.\n    *   Historical sources, such as the *Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư* (Complete Annals of Dai Viet), record that the Vietnamese forces attacked and routed Mu Sheng's army at **Khả Lưu Pass (ải Khả Lưu)** and in the valleys of **Lãnh Câu (Lãnh Câu)** and **Đan Xá (Đan Xá)**.\n    *   During the pursuit, the Ming army was shattered. Mu Sheng himself abandoned his official seal, military flags, and heavy equipment, fleeing with a small contingent back to Yunnan.\n\n5.  **Map the Historical Location to a Current Province:**\n    *   The historical locations of Khả Lưu, Lãnh Câu, and Đan Xá were situated on the main route from Yunnan (China) into northern Vietnam, primarily along the Red River (Sông Hồng) valley.\n    *   This border area, where Mu Sheng's army entered and was subsequently routed upon its retreat, corresponds to the territory of the modern-day **Lào Cai Province**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing Defeats:** It's important to distinguish Mu Sheng's defeat from others. The earlier Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động (1426) was a massive Ming defeat, but the commander was Wang Tong, not Mu Sheng. The most famous battle of 1427, Chi Lăng - Xương Giang, was the defeat of Liu Sheng. Mu Sheng's defeat was a direct consequence of Liu Sheng's fate.\n*   **Nature of Defeat:** His \"defeat\" was a catastrophic rout during a retreat, where his army was ambushed and disintegrated, rather than a single set-piece battle he lost. However, it was a total military failure and is considered his major defeat of the campaign.\n*   **Historical vs. Modern Geography:** Historical place names must be carefully cross-referenced with modern administrative divisions. Khả Lưu Pass, on the route from Yunnan, is unequivocally located in what is now Lào Cai Province.\n\nBased on this analysis, the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat during the Lam Sơn War is Lào Cai.\n\n<<<Lào Cai Province>>>"
