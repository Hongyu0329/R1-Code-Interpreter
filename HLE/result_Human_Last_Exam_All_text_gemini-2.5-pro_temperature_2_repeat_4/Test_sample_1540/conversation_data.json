    "This problem requires us to compare two strings of the same length case-insensitively and determine their lexicographical order. The main challenge is to find a solution that is as memory-efficient as possible and to calculate the total memory in bytes used by the program's variables.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the problem\n\n1.  **Input:** Two lines, each containing a string.\n2.  **Strings properties:**\n    *   They consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n    *   Their lengths are equal and range from 1 to 100 characters.\n3.  **Comparison Logic:**\n    *   The comparison must be lexicographical (character by character from left to right).\n    *   The comparison is case-insensitive, meaning 'a' is treated as equal to 'A'.\n    *   The comparison stops at the first pair of differing characters (after converting them to a common case).\n4.  **Output:**\n    *   \"-1\" if the first string is less than the second.\n    *   \"1\" if the first string is greater than the second.\n    *   \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n5.  **Primary Constraint:** The solution must be the *most memory-efficient* C program. We need to find the total memory `m` used by its variables.\n\n### Careful points and optimization strategy\n\n1.  **Memory Usage:** The most direct approach is to declare two character arrays, for instance `char s1[101]` and `char s2[101]`, read both strings, and then compare them. This would use `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the strings. To achieve maximum memory efficiency, we should try to avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously if possible.\n2.  **Input Reading:** In C, input from standard input is read sequentially. We must read the first line (the first string) completely before we can access the second line (the second string). This means we cannot avoid storing the first string in a buffer.\n3.  **Optimized Strategy:** We can store the first string in a buffer. Then, we can process the second string character by character without storing it entirely. We will loop through our stored first string, and in each iteration, we'll read a single character from the input stream (which will be a character from the second string) and perform the comparison on the fly.\n4.  **Variable Sizing:** To minimize memory, we should choose the smallest possible data type for each variable.\n    *   The buffer for the first string must be `100 + 1 = 101` characters long to accommodate the maximum length plus the null terminator (`\\0`). This will require `char str1[101];`, which is 101 bytes.\n    *   For the loop counter that indexes into the string, the maximum value will be 99. A `char` type (1 byte) can easily hold values from 0 to 127 (or more), making it a more memory-efficient choice than an `int` (typically 4 bytes). So we can use `char i;`.\n    *   The variable to hold the current character from the second string only needs to store one character at a time. A `char` variable (1 byte) is sufficient. So we use `char c2;`.\n5.  **Input Handling:** A robust way to read the input in this character-by-character fashion is to first read the entire first string using `scanf(\"%s\", str1)`. Then, inside a loop, use `scanf(\" %c\", &c2)`. The leading space in the format string `\" %c\"` is crucial; it instructs `scanf` to skip any preceding whitespace characters (including the newline character left after the first `scanf`).\n6.  **Character Comparison:** The `tolower()` function from `<ctype.h>` can be used to convert characters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n\n### Step-by-step acquisition of the final answer\n\nFollowing the most memory-efficient strategy identified above, let's list the necessary variables and calculate their total memory usage.\n\n1.  **Buffer for the first string:** `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory usage: 101 characters * 1 byte/char = **101 bytes**.\n2.  **Loop counter:** `char i;`\n    *   Memory usage: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n3.  **Variable for the second string's character:** `char c2;`\n    *   Memory usage: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nThese are all the variables that need to be declared in the most memory-efficient C program for this problem. Internal buffers used by library functions like `scanf` or temporary values held in CPU registers are not typically counted as \"variables of the problem\" in this context.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these declared variables.\n\n`m` = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `c2`)\n`m` = 101 + 1 + 1\n`m` = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
