    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to a carboxamide group (-C(=O)NH2). By convention, the carbon atom of the ring attached to the amide group is C1.\n    *   **N,N-diethyl**: The two hydrogen atoms on the amide nitrogen are replaced by two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3). The group at C1 is therefore -C(=O)N(C2H5)2.\n    *   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) is attached to the C3 position (meta position) of the benzene ring.\n\n    The structure is a benzene ring with an N,N-diethylcarboxamide group at C1 and a dimethylamino group at C3.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step:**\n    The first step involves reacting the starting material with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in THF.\n    *   **sec-BuLi**: A very strong organolithium base. Its primary role here is to deprotonate the most acidic proton on the molecule.\n    *   **TMEDA**: A chelating ligand that complexes with the lithium ion (Li+). This complexation increases the basicity of the butyl anion, making the reagent more reactive. Crucially, it helps facilitate and direct the deprotonation.\n    *   **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)**: This set of reagents is standard for a process called Directed Ortho-Metalation. In this reaction, the lithium atom of the sec-BuLi coordinates to a Lewis basic group on the aromatic ring, called a Directing Metalating Group (DMG). The butyl anion then deprotonates a proton from a carbon atom *ortho* (adjacent) to this DMG. This is a kinetically controlled reaction.\n    *   **Identifying Directing Groups**: Our starting material has two potential DMGs:\n        1.  The **N,N-diethylcarboxamide group** (-CONEt2) at C1. The carbonyl oxygen is a powerful Lewis base and an excellent DMG. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions: C2 and C6.\n        2.  The **dimethylamino group** (-NMe2) at C3. The lone pair on the nitrogen makes it a good DMG, but it is known to be weaker than the amide group. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions: C2 and C4.\n    *   **Determining the Site of Deprotonation**: We need to compare the different possible sites for deprotonation (metalation).\n        *   **C6**: Ortho only to the strong amide DMG.\n        *   **C4**: Ortho only to the weaker dimethylamino DMG.\n        *   **C2**: This position is special because it is ortho to *both* the amide group and the dimethylamino group. The lithiation at C2 is favored by a cooperative or synergistic effect. The lithium ion can be chelated by both the carbonyl oxygen (at C1) and the amino nitrogen (at C3), forming a stable six-membered ring intermediate. This synergistic direction makes the proton at C2 the most acidic and the most kinetically favorable site for removal.\n    *   **Conclusion of Step 1**: Lithiation occurs regioselectively at the C2 position. The product of this step is an aryllithium intermediate: N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step:**\n    The aryllithium intermediate is then treated with methyl iodide (CH3I).\n    *   **Methyl Iodide (CH3I)**: This is a classic electrophile. The carbon atom is electrophilic due to the polar C-I bond.\n    *   **Reaction**: The aryllithium species contains a highly nucleophilic carbanion at the C2 position. This nucleophile will attack the electrophilic carbon of methyl iodide. This is a standard nucleophilic substitution reaction (specifically, SN2 on the methyl group), where the C-Li bond is replaced by a C-CH3 bond, and lithium iodide (LiI) is formed as a byproduct.\n\n4.  **Identify the Final Product:**\n    The overall transformation is the replacement of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group.\n    *   Starting material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n    *   Product: The parent structure is the same, but with a new methyl substituent at the C2 position.\n    *   The name of the final compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Reagent Identity**: Recognize that sec-BuLi/TMEDA is a specific tool for directed ortho-metalation, not just a generic strong base.\n*   **Relative Strength of Directing Groups**: The amide (-CONR2) is a much stronger directing group than the amine (-NR2).\n*   **Synergy**: The key to solving this problem is recognizing the synergistic effect of the two directing groups on the C2 position, which lies between them. This leads to exceptional regioselectivity.\n*   **Electrophilic Quench**: Understand that the aryllithium formed is a potent nucleophile that reacts readily with electrophiles like methyl iodide.\n*   **IUPAC Nomenclature**: Be careful to name the final product correctly, assigning the numbers to the substituents based on the principal functional group (the benzamide).\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
