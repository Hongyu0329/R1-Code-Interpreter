The leading-order behavior of the generating function `H(s, s')` in the limit as the arc-length separation `|s' - s|` approaches zero is given by the asymptotic expansion:

`H(s, s') = |s' - s| - (κ(s)² / 24)|s' - s|³ + O(|s' - s|⁵)`

where `κ(s)` is the local curvature of the boundary at the point specified by the arc-length parameter `s`. This expression shows that the primary deviation from the flat-space scenario (`H = |s' - s|`) is a cubic term whose magnitude depends on the square of the local curvature.
