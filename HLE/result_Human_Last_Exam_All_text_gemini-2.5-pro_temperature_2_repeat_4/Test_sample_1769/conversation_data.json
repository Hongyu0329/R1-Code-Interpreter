    "This is a fascinating question of alternate linguistic history. To determine the answer, we must trace the etymology of the word \"sister\" and isolate the influence of Old Norse.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Current Word \"Sister\"**: The Modern English word \"sister\" comes from Middle English, where two competing forms existed: *sister* and *suster*. The form *sister* eventually became dominant.\n\n2.  **Trace the Etymological Roots**:\n    *   The ultimate root for both forms is the Proto-Germanic word *\\*swestēr*, which itself comes from the Proto-Indo-European *\\*swésōr*.\n    *   This root word evolved into different, but related, forms in the various Germanic languages.\n    *   In **Old English** (the language of the Anglo-Saxons), the word was **sweostor** (with dialectal variants like *swustor*).\n    *   In **Old Norse** (the language of the Viking invaders), the word was **systir**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Point of Norse Influence**: When the Norse settled in England (the Danelaw), their language, Old Norse, heavily influenced Old English. The native Old English word was *sweostor*. The Old Norse word was *systir*. Notice the similarity. Linguists have concluded that the modern form \"sister,\" with its \"-i-\" vowel sound, is not a direct, natural evolution of the Old English *sweostor*. Instead, the Old Norse *systir* influenced the native word, changing its vowel sound from \"eo\" (or \"u\") to \"i\" and reinforcing the hard /k/-like sound (spelled with 's' but derived from a Scandinavian 'k' sound in some older spellings like 'syster', before the /k/ sound was softened). The form with the \"i\" became dominant, likely because of the significant Norse presence and prestige in the North of England.\n\n4.  **Hypothesize the Evolution Without Norse Influence**: If the Norse invasions had never happened, there would have been no *systir* to influence the native word. We must therefore track the most likely path for the Old English word **sweostor** or its variant **swustor** to evolve into Modern English on its own.\n    *   The most common native (non-Norse-influenced) form in Middle English was **suster**. This word arose naturally from the Old English *swustor* form, through a common linguistic process where the initial \"sw-\" sound simplified to \"s-\" before the vowel \"u\".\n    *   So, we need to project how Middle English *suster* would have evolved. In Middle English, this was pronounced roughly as \"sooster\" (with the vowel sound of \"put\" or \"foot\").\n    *   In the development from Middle to Modern English, the short 'u' vowel sound (as in *suster*, *sunne*, *cumen*) typically unrounded and lowered to become the /ʌ/ vowel sound (the \"STRUT\" vowel), which we hear in Modern English words like **\"sun\"** and **\"come\"**.\n    *   Applying this sound change to *suster* would change the pronunciation from /'sʊstər/ to /'sʌstər/.\n    *   The spelling would most likely have remained **suster**. English spelling often retains older forms even after pronunciation changes (e.g., \"son\" from \"sune\", \"love\" from \"lufu\").\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Not a direct replacement:** The Norse did not give the English a new word for sister; they gave them a new *pronunciation* for their existing word.\n*   **The survival of the native form:** The word \"suster\" was not invented for this hypothetical scenario. It was a very real and common word in Middle English and survived in regional dialects for centuries, which strongly supports the conclusion that it was the natural native development.\n*   **Sound change rules:** The prediction is based on consistent and well-documented sound changes that affected hundreds of other words in the English language between the Middle and Modern periods (e.g., the development of the STRUT vowel).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWithout the influence of the Old Norse word *systir*, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have naturally evolved through its Middle English form, *suster*. Following the standard sound changes of the English language, this would have resulted in a word pronounced with the vowel of \"cup\" or \"fun\". The spelling would have likely remained the same as its Middle English form.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
