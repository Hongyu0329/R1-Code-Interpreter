    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the clues provided in the question.**\n*   **Clue 1:** The man was called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. This is a poetic description, suggesting a person involved in exploration, travel (likely by sea), and perhaps a famous romantic or positive story associated with his travels.\n*   **Clue 2:** Voznesensky also wrote about this man, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" This indicates that for a long time, the location of this man's grave was unknown or lost.\n*   **Clue 3:** \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" This is a critical time marker. It means the grave's location was discovered or identified in the late 1980s.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the man's last name.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the clues.**\n*   The quotes from Voznesensky are from his 1970 poem \"Saga\". This poem later formed the basis for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (Юнона и Авось).\n*   The central figure of both the poem and the rock opera is a real historical person: Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n*   Rezanov was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. His voyages fit the description of a \"sailor.\" His famous love story with Concepción Argüello in Spanish California is the \"joy\" the poem refers to.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the clues against the life of Nikolai Rezanov.**\n*   **\"Joy-discovering sailor\":** This aligns perfectly with the romanticized story of Rezanov's expedition to California in 1806 and his engagement to the daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco.\n*   **\"Where is your grave?\":** Rezanov died prematurely in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807, while returning to St. Petersburg. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky (Resurrection) Cathedral.\n*   **Loss of the grave:** In the 1930s, during the Soviet anti-religious campaigns, the cathedral and its cemetery were destroyed. The exact location of Rezanov's grave was lost for over 50 years. This makes Voznesensky's question literally true.\n*   **Discovery in the late 1980s:** Fueled by the immense popularity of the \"Juno and Avos\" rock opera, there was renewed interest in finding Rezanov's lost grave. Archaeological research was conducted, and in the mid-to-late 1980s, the presumed location of his burial site was rediscovered. This discovery provided the \"answer\" to Voznesensky's question within the specified timeframe.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\nThe man described is Nikolai Rezanov. His story matches all the details provided in the question. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
