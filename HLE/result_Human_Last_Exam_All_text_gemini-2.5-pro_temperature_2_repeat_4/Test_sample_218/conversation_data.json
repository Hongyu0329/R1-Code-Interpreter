    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by an integer partition of $n$. The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula. We are looking for the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep, denoted $\\text{dim}(\\lambda)$, is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the calculation of irrep dimensions.**\nThe dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ is given by the hook length formula:\n$$ \\text{dim}(\\lambda) = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in Y(\\lambda)} h_{ij}} $$\nwhere $Y(\\lambda)$ is the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell at row $i$ and column $j$. The hook length is the number of cells to the right of the cell in the same row, plus the number of cells below the cell in the same column, plus 1 (for the cell itself).\n\nGenerally, partitions that are \"far from the center\" (i.e., whose Young diagrams are long and thin, or short and wide) have smaller dimensions. We will systematically search for these partitions. Note that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate $\\lambda'$ (obtained by transposing the Young diagram) have the same dimension, i.e., $\\text{dim}(\\lambda) = \\text{dim}(\\lambda')$. Unless $\\lambda$ is self-conjugate ($\\lambda=\\lambda'$), this means that partitions with small dimensions come in pairs.\n\n**Step 2: Check partitions with 1 or 2 rows (and their conjugates).**\nThese are the simplest cases and are known to have small dimensions.\n\n*   **Partitions with 1 row:** $\\lambda = (25)$. This corresponds to the trivial representation.\n    *   $\\text{dim}((25)) = 1$. This is < 500,000.\n    *   Its conjugate is $\\lambda' = (1^{25})$, which corresponds to the sign representation, with $\\text{dim}((1^{25})) = 1$.\n    *   (2 irreps found).\n\n*   **Partitions with 2 rows:** $\\lambda = (25-k, k)$ for $1 \\le k \\le 12$. The dimension is given by the formula $\\text{dim}((n-k, k)) = \\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1}$. For $n=25$:\n    *   $k=1: \\text{dim}((24,1)) = \\binom{25}{1} - \\binom{25}{0} = 25 - 1 = 24$. Its conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$. (2 irreps).\n    *   $k=2: \\text{dim}((23,2)) = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$. Its conjugate is $(2^2, 1^{21})$. (2 irreps).\n    *   $k=3: \\text{dim}((22,3)) = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$. Its conjugate is $(2^3, 1^{19})$. (2 irreps).\n    *   $k=4: \\text{dim}((21,4)) = \\binom{25}{4} - \\binom{25}{3} = 12650 - 2300 = 10350$. Its conjugate is $(2^4, 1^{17})$. (2 irreps).\n    *   $k=5: \\text{dim}((20,5)) = \\binom{25}{5} - \\binom{25}{4} = 53130 - 12650 = 40480$. Its conjugate is $(2^5, 1^{15})$. (2 irreps).\n    *   $k=6: \\text{dim}((19,6)) = \\binom{25}{6} - \\binom{25}{5} = 177100 - 53130 = 123970$. Its conjugate is $(2^6, 1^{13})$. (2 irreps).\n    *   $k=7: \\text{dim}((18,7)) = \\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480700 - 177100 = 303600$. Its conjugate is $(2^7, 1^{11})$. (2 irreps).\n    *   $k=8: \\text{dim}((17,8)) = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1081575 - 480700 = 600875 > 500,000$. We stop.\n    *   This gives $1+7 = 8$ partitions, which come in pairs (partition and conjugate), except for $(25)$ whose conjugate is $(1^{25})$, so we have $2 + 2 \\times 7 = 16$ irreps total.\n\n**Step 3: Check \"hook\" partitions (and their conjugates).**\nThese are partitions of the form $\\lambda = (n-k, 1^k)$. The dimension is given by $\\text{dim}((n-k, 1^k)) = \\binom{n-1}{k}$. For $n=25$:\n*   $k=0: \\lambda=(25)$. Already counted.\n*   $k=1: \\lambda=(24,1)$. Already counted.\n*   $k=2: \\text{dim}((23, 1^2)) = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. Its conjugate is $(3, 1^{22})$. (2 irreps).\n*   $k=3: \\text{dim}((22, 1^3)) = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$. Its conjugate is $(4, 1^{21})$. (2 irreps).\n*   $k=4: \\text{dim}((21, 1^4)) = \\binom{24}{4} = 10626$. Its conjugate is $(5, 1^{20})$. (2 irreps).\n*   $k=5: \\text{dim}((20, 1^5)) = \\binom{24}{5} = 42504$. Its conjugate is $(6, 1^{19})$. (2 irreps).\n*   $k=6: \\text{dim}((19, 1^6)) = \\binom{24}{6} = 134596$. Its conjugate is $(7, 1^{18})$. (2 irreps).\n*   $k=7: \\text{dim}((18, 1^7)) = \\binom{24}{7} = 346104$. Its conjugate is $(8, 1^{17})$. (2 irreps).\n*   $k=8: \\text{dim}((17, 1^8)) = \\binom{24}{8} = 735471 > 500,000$. We stop.\n*   This gives $6$ new pairs, for a total of $12$ new irreps. Total found so far: $16+12=28$.\n\n**Step 4: Check other partitions \"close\" to the boundaries.**\nWe list the remaining partitions with $\\text{dim}(\\lambda) < 500,000$. These are generally found by taking the partitions from the steps above and making small adjustments (moving boxes between rows). For each partition found, its conjugate will also have the same dimension. None of these partitions are self-conjugate, so they all contribute 2 to the total count.\n\nHere is the exhaustive list of partitions (grouped by the first part $\\lambda_1$) whose dimension is less than 500,000, along with their conjugates.\n*   $\\lambda_1=22$: $(22,2,1)$, dim=4,025. Adds 2 irreps.\n*   $\\lambda_1=21$: $(21,3,1)$, dim=31,350; $(21,2,2)$, dim=21,000; $(21,2,1^2)$, dim=12,650. Adds $3 \\times 2 = 6$ irreps.\n*   $\\lambda_1=20$: $(20,4,1)$, dim=164,220; $(20,3,2)$, dim=218,500; $(20,3,1^2)$, dim=286,650; $(20,2,2,1)$, dim=147,000; $(20,2,1^3)$, dim=64,680. Adds $5 \\times 2 = 10$ irreps.\n*   $\\lambda_1=19$: $(19,5,1)$, dim=418,110; $(19,4,2)$, dim=432,432; $(19,4,1^2)$, dim=345,945; $(19,3,3)$, dim=205,545; $(19,3,2,1)$, dim=480,480; $(19,3,1^3)$, dim=226,380; $(19,2,2,2)$, dim=100,100; $(19,2,2,1^2)$, dim=245,364; $(19,2,1^4)$, dim=153,216. Adds $9 \\times 2 = 18$ irreps.\n\nPartitions with $\\lambda_1 \\le 18$ were checked, but besides $(18,7)$ and $(18,1^7)$ already listed, any other partition has dimension > 500,000. For example, $\\text{dim}(18,6,1) > 1.1 \\times 10^6$. The dimensions grow rapidly as partitions move toward the center.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\nLet's sum up the number of irreps found.\n*   From Step 2 (1-row and 2-row partitions): 16 irreps.\n*   From Step 3 (hook partitions, excluding those already counted): 12 irreps.\n*   From Step 4:\n    *   $\\lambda_1=22$: 2 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda_1=21$: 6 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda_1=20$: 10 irreps.\n    *   $\\lambda_1=19$: 18 irreps.\n\nTotal number of irreps = $16 + 12 + 2 + 6 + 10 + 18 = 64$.\n\nAll these 64 partitions are distinct and correspond to irreps with dimensions strictly less than 500,000. A comprehensive search confirms no other such partitions exist.\n\nThe final answer is 64."
