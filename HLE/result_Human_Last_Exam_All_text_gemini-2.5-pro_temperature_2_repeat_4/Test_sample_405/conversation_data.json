    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The question asks for the number of distinct colors that can be observed in the *pure allotropes* of phosphorus. The key terms are \"colors\", \"observed\", and \"pure allotropes\". \"Allotropes\" are different structural forms of the same element. \"Observed\" implies colors that are seen in practice, not just theoretical ones. \"Pure\" means we are considering only the element phosphorus, not its compounds.\n\n2.  **Identify the Main Allotropes of Phosphorus**: Phosphorus has several well-known allotropes, each with unique physical and chemical properties, including color. The most common and well-established allotropes are:\n    *   White Phosphorus\n    *   Red Phosphorus\n    *   Violet Phosphorus (also known as Hittorf's Phosphorus)\n    *   Black Phosphorus\n\n3.  **Analyze the Color of Each Allotrope**:\n\n    *   **White Phosphorus (P₄)**:\n        *   **Careful Point 1**: In its absolutely pure state, white phosphorus is a colorless or **white** translucent, waxy solid.\n        *   **Careful Point 2**: It is highly unstable and reactive. Upon exposure to light or gentle heating, it undergoes a slow transformation to the more stable red phosphorus allotrope. This surface conversion gives the substance a very common and characteristic **yellow** appearance. Therefore, \"white phosphorus\" can be observed as both white (when extremely pure and fresh) and yellow (its typical appearance). Since the question asks for colors that can be *observed*, we must count both.\n        *   *Colors contributed: White, Yellow.*\n\n    *   **Red Phosphorus (Pₙ)**:\n        *   **Careful Point 3**: This is an amorphous (non-crystalline) polymeric form. As its name explicitly states, its color is **red**.\n        *   **Careful Point 4**: The exact shade can vary depending on its preparation method and particle size, ranging from scarlet to a dark, purplish-red. However, these are all considered shades of the fundamental color \"red\".\n        *   *Color contributed: Red.*\n\n    *   **Violet Phosphorus**:\n        *   **Careful Point 5**: Also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus, this is a crystalline, polymeric allotrope. It is structurally distinct from the amorphous red phosphorus and is more stable.\n        *   **Careful Point 6**: Its name describes its color. It forms monoclinic crystals that are deep **violet** or purple. This color is distinct from that of red phosphorus.\n        *   *Color contributed: Violet.*\n\n    *   **Black Phosphorus**:\n        *   **Careful Point 7**: This is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of phosphorus at room temperature and pressure. It has a layered crystalline structure similar to graphite.\n        *   **Careful Point 8**: It is a semiconductor and has a **black**, flaky appearance with a metallic luster.\n        *   *Color contributed: Black.*\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Count the Unique Colors**: By combining the observable colors from all the major allotropes, we get the following list of unique colors:\n    1.  White (from pure white phosphorus)\n    2.  Yellow (from white phosphorus exposed to light)\n    3.  Red (from red phosphorus)\n    4.  Violet (from violet phosphorus)\n    5.  Black (from black phosphorus)\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**: There are a total of five distinct colors that can be observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors: white, yellow, red, violet, and black.\n\n<<<5>>>"
