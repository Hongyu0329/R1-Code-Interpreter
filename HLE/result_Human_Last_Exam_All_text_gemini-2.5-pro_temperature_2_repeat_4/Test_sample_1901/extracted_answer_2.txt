D. The proposed modification from the well-known 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) to the single-ring 4-pentylcyanobenzene fails to account for the drastic reduction in molecular anisotropy. This change results in a molecule that is not a stable liquid crystal at room temperature; its transition temperature is far below 0Â°C. This makes the example and subsequent recommendations based on it fundamentally flawed. F. The advice on tuning the transition temperature is incorrect. For this type of molecule, increasing the alkyl chain length generally increases the clearing point (the transition from liquid crystal to isotropic liquid), and decreasing it lowers the clearing point. The provided advice states the opposite, which is a critical error in understanding basic liquid crystal chemistry.
