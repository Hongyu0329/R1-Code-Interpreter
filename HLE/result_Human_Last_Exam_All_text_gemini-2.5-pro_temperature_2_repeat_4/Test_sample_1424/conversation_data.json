    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$) in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nIn the imaginary-time Feynman path integral formalism, the single-particle Green's function is defined as the expectation value of a time-ordered product of field operators. For a non-interacting (\"bare\") system, this is:\n$G_0(x, \\tau; x', \\tau') = -\\langle T_\\tau [\\psi(x, \\tau) \\bar{\\psi}(x', \\tau')] \\rangle_{S_0}$\n\nThis expectation value is calculated via a functional integral over Grassmann fields $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$:\n$G_0(x, \\tau; x', \\tau') = - \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x, \\tau) \\bar{\\psi}(x', \\tau') \\, e^{-S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, e^{-S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}$\nwhere $S_0$ is the action of the non-interacting system and $T_\\tau$ is the imaginary-time ordering operator.\n\n**Step 2: Express the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe action $S_0$ is derived from the non-interacting single-particle Hamiltonian, $\\hat{h}$. This Hamiltonian has a set of orthonormal eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x)$ and corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n$\\hat{h} \\phi_k(x) = \\epsilon_k \\phi_k(x)$\n\nThe action is given by:\n$S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\bar{\\psi}(x, \\tau) \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} + \\hat{h} - \\mu \\right) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. The operator in the parentheses, $ \\mathcal{G}_0^{-1} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} + \\hat{h} - \\mu \\right) $, is the inverse of the Green's function operator.\n\n**Step 3: Diagonalize the Action**\n\nTo see the explicit dependence on $\\epsilon_k$, we must switch to a basis where the operator $\\hat{h}$ is diagonal. This is the basis of its eigenstates, indexed by $k$. We also perform a Fourier transform from imaginary time $\\tau$ to Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n$.\n\n1.  **Eigenstate Basis:** We expand the fields $\\psi(x, \\tau)$ in terms of the eigenfunctions $\\phi_k(x)$:\n    $\\psi(x, \\tau) = \\sum_k \\phi_k(x) c_k(\\tau)$\n    Substituting this into the action and using the orthonormality of the $\\phi_k(x)$, the action simplifies to a sum over the modes $k$:\n    $S_0 = \\sum_k \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\bar{c}_k(\\tau) \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} + \\epsilon_k - \\mu \\right) c_k(\\tau)$\n\n2.  **Frequency Basis (Fourier Transform):** We now expand the time-dependent coefficients $c_k(\\tau)$ in a Fourier series with fermionic Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$:\n    $c_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_n e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} c_{k,n}$\n    The time derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}$ acting on this brings down a factor of $-i\\omega_n$.\n\nAfter both transformations, the action becomes completely diagonal in both indices $k$ and $n$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{c}_{k,n} (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) c_{k,n}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Green's Function in the Diagonal Basis**\n\nIn this diagonal $(k, i\\omega_n)$ basis, the Green's function $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$ is the inverse of the coefficient of the $\\bar{c}_{k,n} c_{k,n}$ term in the action.\nThe functional integral for the correlation function $\\langle c_{k,n} \\bar{c}_{k',n'} \\rangle$ is a standard Gaussian integral for Grassmann variables, which yields:\n$\\langle c_{k,n} \\bar{c}_{k',n'} \\rangle = \\delta_{k,k'} \\delta_{n,n'} \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu}$\n\nThe Green's function in this basis is defined as $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = - \\langle c_{k,n} \\bar{c}_{k,n} \\rangle$.\nTherefore:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = - \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu} = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n### Final Analysis and Careful Points\n\n*   **Choice of Representation:** The functional dependence is clearest in the energy-frequency representation, i.e., $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$, where $k$ labels the energy eigenstate and $i\\omega_n$ is the Matsubara frequency.\n*   **Structure:** The expression shows that $G_0$ has the structure of a simple pole. In the complex frequency plane, the pole is located at $\\omega = -i(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)$.\n*   **Functional Dependence:** The dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is that of an **inverse function**. Specifically, $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the complex frequency $i\\omega_n$ and the energy $\\epsilon_k$ (shifted by the chemical potential $\\mu$).\n*   **Generality:** This result is fundamental and holds for any non-interacting fermionic system, regardless of the specific form of the single-particle potential encoded in $\\hat{h}$. The details of the potential determine the set of eigenvalues $\\{\\epsilon_k\\}$, but the functional relationship between $G_0$ and any given $\\epsilon_k$ remains the same.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe bare Green's function in the frequency-eigenstate representation, $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$, is inversely proportional to a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. Its explicit form is:\n\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nThis means that for a fixed frequency $i\\omega_n$ and chemical potential $\\mu$, the functional dependence is of the form $f(\\epsilon_k) = \\frac{1}{C - \\epsilon_k}$, where $C$ is a constant given by $i\\omega_n + \\mu$. The pole of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency domain occurs precisely at the single-particle energy.\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship, given by the expression $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$, where $i\\omega_n$ is the Matsubara frequency and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.>>>"
