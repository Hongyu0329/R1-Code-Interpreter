The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship, given by the expression $G_0(k, i\omega_n) = \frac{1}{i\omega_n - (\epsilon_k - \mu)}$, where $i\omega_n$ is the Matsubara frequency and $\mu$ is the chemical potential.
