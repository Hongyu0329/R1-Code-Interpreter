    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that fit inside a cube of edge length 15.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal and Basic Constraints\n\nWe want to pack as many bricks of size 9x1x1 into a large cube of size 15x15x15.\n\n*   **Volume of the cube:** 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375 cubic units.\n*   **Volume of one brick:** 9 * 1 * 1 = 9 cubic units.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Theoretical Maximum (Upper Bound)\n\nA simple division of volumes gives us an absolute upper limit on the number of bricks. No packing can exceed this number.\n\n*   **Theoretical Maximum = (Volume of Cube) / (Volume of Brick)**\n*   Theoretical Maximum = 3375 / 9 = 375 bricks.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** This is only a theoretical maximum. It assumes that the bricks could be melted down and poured into the cube, filling the space perfectly. In reality, the rigid shapes of the bricks mean that some space will almost certainly be wasted. The actual answer must be less than or equal to 375.\n\n### Step 3: Develop a Concrete Packing Strategy\n\nThe most straightforward way to pack the cube is a \"greedy\" approach, where we fill a section of the cube as densely as possible in one orientation, and then try to pack the remaining space. The key dimensions are 15 and 9. Notice that `15 = 1 * 9 + 6`. This means if we align the 9-unit length of the bricks along a 15-unit edge of the cube, we can only fit one brick, leaving a 6-unit gap.\n\nLet's use a coordinate system (x, y, z) for the 15x15x15 cube.\n\n**Layer 1: Orient bricks along the z-axis.**\n\n*   We can place the 9x1x1 bricks standing up, so their 9-unit length is parallel to the z-axis.\n*   The base of each brick is 1x1. On the 15x15 base of the cube (the xy-plane), we can place a grid of 15 * 15 = 225 bricks.\n*   These 225 bricks will all have a height of 9. They perfectly fill a rectangular slab of **15x15x9**.\n*   **Bricks placed so far: 225.**\n*   The remaining space is a slab on top, with dimensions **15x15x6**. No more bricks can be placed vertically, as the remaining height is 6, which is less than 9.\n\n**Layer 2: Pack the remaining 15x15x6 space. Orient bricks along the x-axis.**\n\n*   We now have a space of 15(x) by 15(y) by 6(z).\n*   We must orient the bricks with their 9-unit length along the x or y axis. Let's choose the x-axis.\n*   We can create a slab of bricks where their 9-unit length goes along the x-axis. This slab will have dimensions **9x15x6**.\n*   The number of bricks that fit in this slab is determined by the y and z dimensions: 15 * 6 = 90 bricks.\n*   **Bricks placed in this layer: 90.**\n*   This uses up a 9x15x6 portion of the 15x15x6 space. The remaining space is (15-9)x15x6, which is a **6x15x6** slab.\n\n**Layer 3: Pack the remaining 6x15x6 space. Orient bricks along the y-axis.**\n\n*   We now have a space of 6(x) by 15(y) by 6(z).\n*   The only available dimension long enough to fit the 9-unit bricks is the y-axis.\n*   We can create a slab of bricks with their 9-unit length along the y-axis. This slab will have dimensions **6x9x6**.\n*   The number of bricks that fit in this slab is determined by the x and z dimensions: 6 * 6 = 36 bricks.\n*   **Bricks placed in this layer: 36.**\n*   This uses up a 6x9x6 portion of the 6x15x6 space. The remaining space is 6x(15-9)x6, which is a **6x6x6** cube.\n\n**Final Leftover Space**\n\n*   The final remaining space is a **6x6x6** cube.\n*   Since all dimensions of this cube (6, 6, 6) are smaller than the longest dimension of the brick (9), no more bricks can be packed.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Bricks\n\nWe sum the number of bricks from each stage of the packing strategy:\n\n*   Total Bricks = (Bricks from Layer 1) + (Bricks from Layer 2) + (Bricks from Layer 3)\n*   Total Bricks = 225 + 90 + 36 = **351**.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Solution and Consider Optimality\n\n*   **Volume Check:** The total volume of 351 bricks is 351 * 9 = 3159 cubic units. The volume of the wasted space in our packing is 6*6*6 = 216 cubic units. The total volume accounted for is 3159 + 216 = 3375, which matches the cube's volume. This confirms our packing geometry is sound.\n*   **Symmetry:** If we had chosen a different axis order for our greedy strategy (e.g., start with x-axis, then z-axis, then y-axis), the result would be the same. This symmetry suggests the strategy is robust.\n*   **Gap to Theoretical Maximum:** The gap between the theoretical max (375) and our result (351) is 24 bricks. The volume of 24 bricks is 24 * 9 = 216 cubic units, which is exactly the volume of the 6x6x6 leftover cube. This indicates that our strategy is highly efficient, and the wasted space comes directly from the dimensional mismatch (`15 mod 9 = 6`).\n*   **Conclusion on Optimality:** While proving optimality for 3D packing problems can be extremely complex, the constructive method shown here is simple, leaves a single contiguous block of unusable space, and fully accounts for the volume. Any other packing method would have to be more efficient in its use of space, which is very unlikely given the constraints. Therefore, 351 is the largest possible number."
