    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step 1: Locate Waskaganish\n*   **Identify Waskaganish:** Waskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec, Canada.\n*   **Geographical Position:** It is situated on the southern shore of Rupert Bay, which is a large inlet on the eastern side of James Bay. The community lies at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n*   **Reference Point:** The \"Waskaganish gathering place\" is understood to be the community of Waskaganish itself. Its approximate coordinates are 51.48° N latitude, 78.76° W longitude.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories\n*   **Exclude Quebec:** The question requires us to find the closest province or territory *outside* of Quebec.\n*   **Geographical Neighbors:** We need to consider the provinces and territories that are geographically near Waskaganish. Looking at a map of Canada:\n    *   **Ontario:** Borders Quebec to the west and southwest. Its coast forms the western and southern shore of James Bay.\n    *   **Nunavut:** This territory includes the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay, and the mainland far to the north.\n    *   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** Borders Quebec to the east, but this border is very far from Waskaganish.\n    *   **New Brunswick:** Borders Quebec to the southeast, also very far from Waskaganish.\n*   **Primary Candidates:** Based on Waskaganish's location on James Bay, the closest neighbors are clearly Ontario and Nunavut.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Proximity to Ontario\n*   **Border Location:** The border between Quebec and Ontario is both a land border and a maritime border in James Bay.\n*   **Land Border:** The land border runs north-south and meets the southern coast of James Bay at a point west-southwest of Waskaganish. The official terminus of the land border is near the mouth of the Harricana River, at approximately 79.52° W longitude on the same latitude as Waskaganish.\n*   **Distance Calculation:**\n    *   Waskaganish's longitude: ~78.76° W\n    *   Ontario border's longitude on the coast: ~79.52° W\n    *   The shortest distance to Ontario is a straight line to the land border along the coast. The distance overland to the southwest is very short. A direct line westward across the water to the Ontario mainland coast is another option. However, the land border meeting the coast is the absolute closest point of Ontario.\n    *   Calculating the distance to the border along the coastline: The distance is approximately 55-60 kilometers (about 35 miles).\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Proximity to Nunavut\n*   **Territorial Boundary:** Nunavut's territory includes most of the islands within James Bay. The closest landmass belonging to Nunavut is a set of these islands.\n*   **Closest Island:** The largest and one of the closest islands in James Bay is Akimiski Island. It lies to the northwest of Waskaganish.\n*   **Distance Estimation:** The distance from Waskaganish to the southeastern tip of Akimiski Island is over 200 kilometers (about 125 miles). Other smaller islands of Nunavut, like the Twin Islands, are also to the northwest and are significantly farther away than the Ontario border.\n\n### Step 5: Compare Distances and Conclude\n*   **Distance to Ontario Border:** Approximately 55-60 kilometers.\n*   **Distance to Nunavut (Akimiski Island):** Over 200 kilometers.\n*   **Conclusion:** The distance to the land border of Ontario is significantly shorter than the distance to the nearest part of Nunavut. Therefore, Ontario is the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
