    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concept: Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (also known as trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change in English. The rule states that a long vowel or diphthong becomes a short (lax) vowel if it is in the third-to-last (antepenultimate) syllable of a word.\n\n*   **Required Conditions:**\n    1.  The word must have at least three syllables.\n    2.  The vowel in question must be in the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable.\n    3.  This vowel must have been historically long in the root word.\n    4.  The sound change is the shortening/laxing of that vowel.\n*   **Example:** The word `sane` has a long vowel /eɪ/. When we add the suffix `-ity`, we get `sanity` (`SAN-i-ty`). The vowel is now in the third-to-last syllable, so the long /eɪ/ shortens to a lax /æ/.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Word**\n\nLet's examine each word in the list by comparing it to its simpler root word.\n\n*   **southern**\n    *   **Root Word:** `south`\n    *   **Pronunciation Change:** `south` /saʊθ/ (with a long diphthong) -> `southern` /ˈsʌðərn/ (with a short, lax vowel /ʌ/).\n    *   **Syllable Count:** `southern` has two syllables (`south-ern`).\n    *   **Analysis:** Although vowel shortening has occurred, the word is only two syllables long. The rule for *trisyllabic* (three-syllable) laxing does not apply here because the environment is not met. So, this word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**\n    *   **Root Word:** `derive`\n    *   **Pronunciation Change:** `derive` /dɪˈraɪv/ (with a long diphthong /aɪ/) -> `derivative` /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/ (with a short, lax vowel /ɪ/).\n    *   **Syllable Count:** `derivative` has four syllables (`de-RIV-a-tive`). The vowel change occurs in the `-riv-` syllable, which is the third from the end (ante penultimate).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a textbook example of trisyllabic laxing. The conditions are met, and the vowel change occurred as predicted.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    *   **Root Word:** `serene`\n    *   **Pronunciation Change:** `serene` /səˈriːn/ (with a long vowel /iː/) -> `serenity` /səˈrɛnəti/ (with a short, lax vowel /ɛ/).\n    *   **Syllable Count:** `serenity` has four syllables (`se-REN-i-ty`). The vowel change occurs in the `-ren-` syllable, which is the third from the end.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is another clear example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    *   **Root Word:** `please`\n    *   **Pronunciation Change:** `please` /pliːz/ (with a long vowel /iː/) -> `pleasant` /ˈplɛzənt/ (with a short, lax vowel /ɛ/).\n    *   **Syllable Count:** `pleasant` has two syllables (`pleas-ant`).\n    *   **Analysis:** Like `southern`, this word shows vowel shortening, but it is not trisyllabic laxing because the word is only two syllables long.\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    *   **Root Connection:** Related to Latin `grātus` (\"grateful,\" with a long `ā`) and English `grace`.\n    *   **Pronunciation:** `gratitude` /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/. The first vowel is /æ/, which is a short, lax vowel.\n    *   **Syllable Count:** `gratitude` has three syllables (`GRA-ti-tude`). The vowel in question is in the first syllable, which is the antepenultimate.\n    *   **Analysis:** The short /æ/ in `gratitude` where related forms have a long vowel shows that the word has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**\n    *   **Root Word:** From Old English `sceaduwe`.\n    *   **Pronunciation:** `shadow` /ˈʃædoʊ/. The first vowel is /æ/, which is a short, lax vowel.\n    *   **Syllable Count:** `shadow` has two syllables (`shad-ow`).\n    *   **Analysis:** There are two reasons this word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing. First, it is only two syllables long. Second, and more importantly, its root in Old English (`sceadu`) already had a short vowel. There was never a long vowel in this position to be shortened. The vowel has always been short.\n\n**3. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` **HAVE** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` have not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing because they are only two syllables long, although they do exhibit a different type of vowel shortening.\n*   `shadow` has not undergone trisyllabic laxing because it is only two syllables long AND its root vowel was never long to begin with. It was never a candidate for this sound change.\n\nTherefore, `shadow` is the most definitive answer, as it fails to meet the conditions for trisyllabic laxing on multiple fundamental levels.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
