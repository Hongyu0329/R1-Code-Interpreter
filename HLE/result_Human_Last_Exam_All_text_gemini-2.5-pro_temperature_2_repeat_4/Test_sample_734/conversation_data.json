    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for a specific **Christian theologian**. This narrows the field to prominent figures within the history of Christian thought.\n2.  **Identify the Key Action:** The theologian must have **\"developed specialized terminology.\"** This implies not just discussing a topic, but coining specific, technical terms or phrases to describe a concept. It suggests a philosophical or systematic approach.\n3.  **Identify the Concept:** The terminology must describe **\"changes in the laws of nature.\"** This means the theologian's framework must allow for the idea that the regular, observable patterns of the universe can be altered, suspended, or were once different.\n4.  **Identify the Specific Applications:** The framework and its terminology must be applicable to two distinct theological points:\n    *   **The virgin birth of Jesus:** A unique miracle that runs contrary to the known laws of biology.\n    *   **Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall:** The theological concept that Adam and Eve's sin had cosmic consequences, changing the physical world itself (e.g., introducing death, entropy, and hardship into nature).\n\n**Analysis of Potential Candidates and Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** Aquinas developed extensive terminology for miracles, such as describing them as happening *praeter naturam* (outside the order of nature). He classified them based on their relationship to natural processes. While he dealt with the topic, his framework focuses more on God acting *outside* or *beyond* the existing natural law, rather than developing a specific vocabulary for how the law *itself* could be fundamentally altered by an event like the Fall.\n*   **The Protestant Reformers (16th Century):** Figures like John Calvin discussed divine providence and miracles extensively. They affirmed both the virgin birth and the cosmic effects of the Fall. However, their primary focus was not on developing new metaphysical terminology for the mechanics of natural law but on biblical exegesis and soteriology.\n*   **Francis Schaeffer (20th Century):** Schaeffer developed the very specific apologetic terminology of a **\"uniformity of natural causes in an open system\"** versus a \"closed system.\" This framework perfectly addresses both the virgin birth (an act by God in the \"open system\") and the effects of the Fall (an alteration of the system by its creator). However, the question asks who was the **\"first\"** to develop such terminology, and Schaeffer is a very recent figure, building on centuries of thought.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (4th-5th Century):** Augustine is a foundational figure who dealt directly and systematically with these issues.\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** He developed a crucial distinction. He argued that miracles are not *contra naturam* (against nature) because that would imply God contradicts himself. Instead, they are ***contra quam est nota natura*** (against nature *as it is known to us*). This is a highly specific terminological distinction that forms the basis for much of later Western thought on the subject. He also wrote about the *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons), potentials God placed in creation that could unfold later in unexpected ways.\n    *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** He frequently used miracles, including the virgin birth, as examples of events that are contrary to our limited experience of nature but perfectly in line with God's higher, though hidden, will for nature.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** Augustine's doctrine of Original Sin is central to his theology, and he explicitly taught in works like *The City of God* that death and corruption entered the created order as a direct consequence of the Fall. This implies a change in the functioning of nature from its original \"very good\" state. His framework, distinguishing God's will from the known course of nature, provides the vocabulary to describe how God could ordain a change in nature's laws as a judgment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile others, like Schaeffer, developed more modern-sounding terms, Augustine of Hippo was the first major Christian theologian to create a sophisticated and specific vocabulary (notably, *contra quam est nota natura*) to provide a coherent explanation for both unique divine interventions like the virgin birth and for a fundamental alteration in the fabric of natural law resulting from the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
