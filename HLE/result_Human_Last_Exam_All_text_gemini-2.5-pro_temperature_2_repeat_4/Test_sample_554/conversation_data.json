    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the terminology**\n*   **\"perfluoro-\"**: This is a chemical prefix from IUPAC nomenclature. It signifies that all hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms in the parent compound have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n*   **\"nanocar\"**: This refers to a specific type of molecule designed to function like a car on a molecular scale, possessing a chassis, axles, and wheels. To answer the question, we must identify the chemical structure of a standard nanocar's parent hydrocarbon framework.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the parent structure of a \"nanocar\"**\n*   The most widely recognized nanocar is the first one synthesized by Professor James Tour's group at Rice University, as described in their 2005 publication in *Organic Letters*.\n*   This nanocar consists of a central chassis with four axles to which \"wheels\" (C60 fullerene molecules) are attached. The question is about the number of fluorine atoms, which depends on the number of hydrogen atoms in the organic framework (chassis and axles).\n*   The parent hydrocarbon structure for the chassis and axles of this original nanocar is **1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-ethynylphenylethynyl)benzene**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the parent structure and count its hydrogen atoms**\nLet's break down the structure of 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-ethynylphenylethynyl)benzene to count the total number of hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Central Core (\"benzene\")**: The core is a benzene ring. The \"1,2,4,5-tetrakis\" part indicates that it is substituted at four positions. A benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms and 6 hydrogen atoms (C6H6). When it is substituted at four positions, four hydrogen atoms are removed.\n    *   Number of hydrogens on the central ring = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\n*   **Arms/Axles (\"4-ethynylphenylethynyl\" groups)**: There are four identical groups attached to the central ring. Let's analyze one group.\n    *   The group is -(C≡C)-(p-C6H4)-(C≡C-H).\n    *   **Phenylene ring (p-C6H4)**: This is a benzene ring that is part of a chain, substituted at two positions (1 and 4, or para). It has 4 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Terminal Ethynyl group (-C≡C-H)**: This is an alkyne group at the end of the arm. It has 1 hydrogen atom.\n    *   The ethynyl group linking the arm to the core (-C≡C-) has no hydrogens.\n    *   Total hydrogens per arm = 4 (on phenylene) + 1 (on terminal ethynyl) = 5.\n\n*   **Total Hydrogen Count**:\n    *   Hydrogens on the four arms = 4 arms × 5 hydrogens/arm = 20.\n    *   Total hydrogens in the molecule = 2 (on core) + 20 (on arms) = 22.\n\nThe molecular formula of the parent hydrocarbon is C46H22.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version**\n*   According to the definition of \"perfluoro-\", to create a perfluoronanocar, all 22 hydrogen atoms in the parent structure must be replaced by 22 fluorine atoms.\n*   The wheels, typically C60 fullerenes, are pure carbon allotropes and contain no hydrogen atoms. Therefore, they are not involved in the perfluorination process of the hydrocarbon chassis.\n\n**Step 5: Final conclusion**\nA hypothetical perfluoronanocar, based on the standard and most well-defined nanocar structure, would contain a number of fluorine atoms equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in its parent hydrocarbon framework. Therefore, it would contain **22** fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<22>>>"
