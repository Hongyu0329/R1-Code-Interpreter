    "This question requires scanning a line from Plautus, which often involves special rules beyond classical Latin poetry. The meter is an Iambic Senarius, which consists of six iambic feet (`x L`), where the odd-numbered feet (1, 3, 5) can be substituted with a spondee (`L L`) or be \"resolved\" into feet of three or four syllables.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Write out the line:**\n    `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n\n2.  **Syllabify and identify elisions:**\n    - The line has 15 syllables as written: `et ti-bi be-ne es-se so-li quom si-bi sit ma-le`.\n    - This is too long for a 12-syllable iambic senarius base. We must look for elisions or other shortenings.\n    - There is one standard elision: the final `-e` of `bene` is dropped before the initial `e-` of `esse`. The line is read as `et tibi ben'esse...`. This reduces the syllable count to 14, which is still long but plausible for a heavily resolved Plautine line.\n\n3.  **Determine syllable quantity:**\n    - `et`: Long by position. The short vowel `e` is followed by two consonants (`t` from `et` and `t` from `tibi`). (**L**)\n    - `tibi`: Both vowels are short. (**S S**)\n    - `ben(e) esse` becomes `benesse`, syllabified as `be-nes-se`. `be-` is short. `-nes-` is long by position because the vowel is followed by the `ss` cluster. `-se` is short. (**S L S**)\n    - `soli`: from `sōlus`, the `o` is naturally long. The final `i` is short. (**L S**)\n    - `quom`: Long by position, as its vowel `o(u)` is followed by the `s` of `sibi`. (**L**)\n    - `sibi`: Both vowels are short. (**S S**)\n    - `sit`: Long by position, as its short vowel `i` is followed by the `m` of `male`. (**L**)\n    - `male`: Both vowels are short. (**S S**)\n\n4.  **Assemble the quantitative pattern (14 syllables):**\n    `L S S S L S L S L S S L S S`\n\n5.  **Divide into 6 feet (Iambic Senarius):**\n    This is where the line becomes notoriously difficult, as the 14-syllable string does not easily break into six valid feet. To make the line scan properly as an iambic senarius, scholars often propose textual changes or multiple, simultaneous metrical licenses.\n\n    A plausible scansion can be achieved by assuming several Plautine licenses to reach a 12-syllable line that fits the meter perfectly. This involves:\n    - **Syncope** (dropping a vowel from the middle of a word) in `tib(i)` and `sib(i)`.\n    - **Elision** in `ben(e) esse`.\n    - Assuming the resulting `benesse` can be divided by a caesura.\n    - **Metrical Lengthening** of the final syllable of `male` to `malē` to fit the required `S L` pattern of the final foot.\n\n    Applying these produces a line that can be scanned as follows:\n\n    - **Foot 1:** `et tib(i)` becomes `et tib`. This is a spondee (`L L`). Valid in the first foot.\n    - **Foot 2:** `ben(e) esse` has `be-nes...`. The syllables `be nes` form an iamb (`S L`). Valid.\n    - **Foot 3:** The remainder of `esse` and start of `soli` form `-se sō...`. This forms an iamb (`S L`). Valid.\n    - **Foot 4:** The remainder of `soli` and `quom` form `-li quom`. This forms an iamb (`S L`). Valid.\n    - **Foot 5:** `sib(i) sit` becomes `sib sit`. This is a spondee (`L L`). Valid in the fifth foot.\n    - **Foot 6:** `male` is treated as `malē` (`S L`) by metrical license. This forms a perfect iamb for the final foot.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   This line is famously difficult and debated among scholars. Any scansion requires assuming multiple, sometimes strong, metrical licenses typical of early Latin comedy.\n*   The determination of `et` as long is due to \"position,\" where its vowel is followed by the consonant cluster `t-t`.\n*   Final syllables ending in a short vowel are normally short (like in `male`), but can be lengthened to fit the meter at the end of a line.\n*   The line cannot be scanned easily without assuming contractions like syncope, which are characteristic of Plautus's rapid, conversational style.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the analysis that yields a valid iambic senarius structure:\n\nL L S L S L S L L L S L\n\nThis is grouped into feet as:\n\n<<<L L | S L | S L | S L | L L | S L>>>"
