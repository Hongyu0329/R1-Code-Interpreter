    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants, Reagent, and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu). This is a strong and sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH). This is the conjugate acid of the base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide and a strong, bulky base strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Starting Material**\n*   The naming (1S,2R) defines the specific stereoisomer. To analyze the reaction on a cyclohexane chair, we first need to determine the relative orientation (cis/trans) of the bromine and methyl groups.\n*   Drawing the molecule and assigning R/S configurations reveals that for the (1S,2R) isomer, the bromine atom and the methyl group are on the same side of the ring. They are in a **cis** relationship.\n\n**Step 3: Draw and Analyze the Chair Conformations**\nA cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations.\n*   **Conformation A:** Bromine (Br) is axial, and the methyl group (CH₃) is equatorial.\n*   **Conformation B:** Bromine (Br) is equatorial, and the methyl group (CH₃) is axial.\n\nTo determine which conformation is more stable, we compare the steric strain. Bulky groups prefer the equatorial position to avoid 1,3-diaxial interactions. The methyl group is significantly bulkier than the bromine atom. Therefore, **Conformation A (axial Br, equatorial CH₃) is the more stable conformer** and will be present in a higher concentration at equilibrium.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\n*   The E2 mechanism requires a specific geometry: the leaving group (Br) and the proton being removed (a β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** position. In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must both be in axial positions and on opposite sides of the ring (**trans-diaxial**).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Reactive Conformation and Possible Products**\n*   **Conformation B (equatorial Br)** cannot undergo an E2 reaction because the bromine leaving group is not in an axial position.\n*   **Conformation A (axial Br)** is the only conformation that can undergo E2 elimination. We must now look at the β-hydrogens (hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to the one with the bromine, which are C2 and C6).\n    *   **Elimination path 1 (Zaitsev pathway):** At C2, the methyl group is equatorial, which means the hydrogen atom is **axial**. This axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Removing this hydrogen would lead to the formation of **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted (trisubstituted) alkene, known as the Zaitsev product.\n    *   **Elimination path 2 (Hofmann pathway):** At C6, there is also an **axial** hydrogen that is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Removing this hydrogen would lead to the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted (disubstituted) alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n\n**Step 6: Predict the Major Product**\n*   The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann products depends on the nature of the base.\n*   Small, strong bases (like ethoxide) favor the more stable, more substituted Zaitsev product.\n*   Large, bulky bases, like the **potassium tert-butoxide** used in this reaction, have difficulty accessing the sterically hindered β-hydrogen.\n*   In this case, the β-hydrogen at C2 is sterically hindered by the adjacent equatorial methyl group. The β-hydrogen at C6 is much more sterically accessible.\n*   Therefore, the bulky tert-butoxide base will preferentially remove the less hindered proton from C6, leading to the formation of the Hofmann product as the major product.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\nThe major product of the reaction between (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide is the less substituted alkene, which is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
