    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n*   **Critical-Level Views:** These are a class of theories in population ethics. They evaluate the goodness of a population by summing the welfare of each individual after subtracting a \"critical level\" (c). The value of a population is typically calculated as Σ(uᵢ - c), where uᵢ is the welfare of person i. A key feature is that the critical level `c` is positive. This means that adding a person with a life worth living (uᵢ > 0) can actually make the population worse if their welfare is below the critical level (0 < uᵢ < c), because their contribution (uᵢ - c) would be negative.\n*   **Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem:** This is a theorem in population ethics formulated by Gustaf Arrhenius. It demonstrates that a specific set of five plausible-sounding ethical principles cannot all be true simultaneously—they are mutually inconsistent. To answer the question, we need to know what these principles are and determine which one is violated by critical-level views.\n\n**2. List and Define the Conditions (The Answer Choices)**\nThe answer choices are the conditions we need to analyze. Not all of them are necessarily part of the Sixth Theorem, but we will evaluate the critical-level view against each.\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This principle favors equality under certain conditions. It states that if population A is perfectly equal, has the same size and a higher average welfare than population B, and no one in B is better off than anyone in A, then A is better than B.\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** This is a prioritarian principle. It states that benefiting a worse-off person has greater moral value than providing the same benefit to a sufficiently large number of well-off people. It prioritizes helping those with lower welfare.\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This principle states that a vast population of people with low but positive welfare cannot be judged as worse than a very small population of people enjoying extremely high welfare (a utopia). Quality of life cannot completely trump quantity of lives worth living.\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This is a very basic humanitarian principle. It states that adding a person with positive welfare (a life worth living) to a population can never make that population worse.\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:** This principle states that there is at least one positive welfare level such that adding a person with that level of welfare makes the population better.\n\n**3. Identify the Axioms of the *Sixth* Theorem**\nThe question is very specific about \"Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\" According to academic sources on Arrhenius's work (e.g., his book *Population Ethics: The Challenge of Future Generations*), the five axioms for this theorem are:\n1.  The Dominance Condition\n2.  **Non-Elitism**\n3.  The Minimal Addition Principle (related to, but weaker than, Weak Quality Addition)\n4.  **The General Non-Extreme Priority Condition**\n5.  **Egalitarian Dominance**\n\nNotice that **Weak Non-Sadism (D)** is *not* one of the axioms in the Sixth Theorem. Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer to the question as stated, even though critical-level views famously violate it.\n\n**4. Analyze Which Condition is Violated by Critical-Level Views**\nWe now check the critical-level view (Σ(uᵢ - c) where c > 0) against the relevant conditions from the Sixth Theorem that are also in the answer choices (A, B, C).\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** Critical-level views *satisfy* this. If A and B have the same size (N), average welfare in A (avg_A) is higher than in B (avg_B), then N * avg_A > N * avg_B. The value of population A is N*(avg_A - c) and for B is N*(avg_B - c). Since avg_A > avg_B, it follows that N*(avg_A - c) > N*(avg_B - c). So A is better than B.\n\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:** Standard critical-level views *violate* this. As an aggregative theory, it gives equal weight to a unit of welfare increase for anyone, regardless of their starting welfare level. It does not prioritize the worse-off. However, this violation is a feature of its simple aggregative (utilitarian) structure, not of the critical-level concept itself. One could construct a *prioritarian* critical-level view that satisfies this condition.\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** Critical-level views *violate* this in a fundamental way.\n    *   Consider a small utopian population of one person with very high welfare, U_high > c. Its value is (U_high - c), which is positive.\n    *   Now consider a vast population of M people, all with a low but positive welfare level, U_low, where 0 < U_low < c.\n    *   The value of this vast population is M * (U_low - c). Since U_low < c, the term (U_low - c) is negative. As the population size M grows, the total value becomes an ever-larger negative number.\n    *   Therefore, the small utopia (with a positive value) is judged as better than the vast population of people with lives worth living (with a large negative value), no matter how large M is. This is a direct violation of Non-Elitism.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nA standard critical-level view violates both General Non-Extreme Priority (B) and Non-Elitism (C). However, the violation of Non-Elitism is a more direct and unavoidable consequence of having a positive critical level (`c > 0`). The violation of priority stems from its aggregative nature, which it shares with theories like classical utilitarianism and is not essential to the \"critical-level\" idea itself (as shown by the possibility of a prioritarian version). The most essential violation for this class of theories among the actual axioms of the Sixth Theorem is Non-Elitism.\n\n<<<C>>>"
