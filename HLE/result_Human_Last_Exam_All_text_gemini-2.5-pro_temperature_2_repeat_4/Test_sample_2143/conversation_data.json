    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the identity of \"HE\".\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the core clues in the question.**\n*   **\"HIS work\"**: The person in question is a male who produced a significant work.\n*   **\"the issue of another's material possessions\"**: This strongly alludes to the Tenth Commandment from the Judeo-Christian tradition: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This commandment specifically deals with the desire for things that belong to others.\n*   **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: The Tenth Commandment is the final commandment in the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments). This positions the clue at the end of a specific, famous list.\n*   **\"the prohibition against representation\"**: This is a direct reference to the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.\" This commandment forbids the creation of graven images or physical representations for worship.\n*   **\"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: This is the most complex part of the puzzle. It links the two commandments mentioned above. The Tenth Commandment (on coveting) doesn't deal with physical, external representations (like the Second), but with internal, mental ones. To covet is to form a desire, a mental picture or *representation*, of owning what is not yours. Therefore, by addressing the internal mental image of desire, the text shifts focus from the external physical image (idol), thus \"naturally ignoring\" the original context of the prohibition against physical representation.\n*   **\"According to Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: This points us to a specific scholar whose analysis confirms this connection. Veronika Campan is a German theologian who has written about the Decalogue. Her analysis highlights this very shift from the external prohibition of images (2nd Commandment) to the internal prohibition of desirous mental images (10th Commandment).\n\n**Step 2: Synthesize the clues.**\nThe puzzle describes the Ten Commandments. The central figure who, according to biblical tradition, received and delivered these commandments from God on Mount Sinai is Moses. The work referred to is the Torah (or the first five books of the Old Testament), which contains the story and the laws, including the Decalogue.\n\n*   **HE** = Moses\n*   **HIS work** = The Decalogue / The Law in the Torah\n*   **End of work** = The Tenth Commandment\n*   **Material Possessions** = The content of the Tenth Commandment\n*   **Prohibition on representation** = The Second Commandment\n*   **Interpretation** = The scholarly link provided by Veronika Campan between the two commandments.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the identity.**\nAll clues point unequivocally to the prophet who is central to the story of the Ten Commandments. His name is universally known. The question asks for \"HIS full name\". In this context, \"Moses\" is his complete and recognized name.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
