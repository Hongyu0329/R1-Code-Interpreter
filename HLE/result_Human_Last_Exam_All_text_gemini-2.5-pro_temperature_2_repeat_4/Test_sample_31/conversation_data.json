    "On a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, to fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case, we need to gather enough information from the side stickers of the top layer to distinguish between all 21 possible permutations (including the solved state).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the task**\nThe goal is to determine the single permutation of the last layer's pieces. The top-facing stickers are all correctly oriented (e.g., all yellow), so they provide no information about permutation. We must use the stickers on the vertical sides of the top layer's four corner pieces and four edge pieces. There are a total of 12 such stickers (2 on each of the 4 corners, and 1 on each of the 4 edges). We want to find the smallest number of these stickers we need to look at to know the PLL case for certain.\n\n**Step 2: Can it be done with fewer than 4 stickers?**\nNo. Looking at 1, 2, or 3 stickers is not enough. For example, seeing a \"block\" (an adjacent corner and edge sticker matching on one face) requires seeing two stickers, but many different PLL cases can have a block (T, F, R, J, G, Y perms). Adding a third sticker doesn't resolve the ambiguities between all of them. For instance, a T-perm and an F-perm can present the exact same three stickers on one face, making them indistinguishable with only that information.\n\n**Step 3: Test if 4 stickers are sufficient.**\nTo test if 4 stickers are enough, we must find if there are two different PLL cases that can look identical from the perspective of any chosen 4 stickers. The G-permutations are famously difficult to distinguish and serve as a good test case.\n*   **The G-Perms:** There are four G-perms (Ga, Gb, Gc, Gd). They are often recognized by having headlights on two adjacent faces.\n*   **Gc vs. Gd Perms:** Let's focus on Gc and Gd. Both of these cases can be oriented so they have \"headlights\" on the front face AND \"headlights\" on the right face.\n    *   \"Headlights\" are when the two corner pieces on a face have the same side-sticker color.\n*   **Information Cost:**\n    1.  To confirm headlights on the front face, you must see the two corner stickers on that face. That's **2 stickers**.\n    2.  To confirm headlights on the right face, you must see the two corner stickers on that face. That's another **2 stickers**.\n*   **The Ambiguity:** After observing these 4 stickers and confirming the (Headlights_Front, Headlights_Right) pattern, you have successfully narrowed the possibilities down to two cases: Gc or Gd. However, you have not *fully identified* the single case. The information from these 4 stickers alone is insufficient to tell them apart.\n*   **Conclusion for 4 stickers:** Since there is a situation where viewing 4 stickers leaves ambiguity, 4 is not a sufficient number to identify all PLL cases. The minimum must be greater than 4.\n\n**Step 4: Test if 5 stickers are sufficient.**\nSince 4 stickers are not enough, let's see if adding one more sticker can resolve all ambiguities.\n*   **Resolving the Gc vs. Gd Case:** We established that seeing the 4 corner stickers that form the front and right headlights leaves us stuck between Gc and Gd. We must look at a 5th sticker.\n    *   A key difference between the Gc and Gd perms (when oriented with front/right headlights) is the location of their 2x1 solved block. In Gc, the block is on the back face. In Gd, the block is on the left face.\n    *   Alternatively, the permutation of the edge pieces is different. Let's look at the sticker on the front face of the front edge piece. Its color will be different in the Gc case compared to the Gd case. For one case, the sticker will be the color of the right face's center, and for the other, it will be the color of the back face's center.\n    *   Therefore, by viewing the 4 corner stickers plus this 5th edge sticker, we can differentiate between Gc and Gd.\n*   **Sufficiency for all cases:** This set of 5 stickers—the two corner stickers on the front, the two corner stickers on the right, and the edge sticker on the front—provides a high amount of information. It tells you about:\n    1.  Headlight patterns on two adjacent faces.\n    2.  Block patterns on the front face.\n    3.  The specific identity of several pieces and their locations.\n    This much information is sufficient to uniquely distinguish between all 21 PLL cases from a single viewpoint without needing to turn the cube. While different recognition methods might look at different sets of 5 stickers, the fact that a 5-sticker set exists that can resolve the hardest cases proves that 5 is a sufficient number.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nWe have shown that 4 stickers are not enough to distinguish all cases, and that 5 stickers are enough. Therefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
