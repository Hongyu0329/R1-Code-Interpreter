    "An analysis of the question is as follows, with step-by-step reasoning and careful points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$. This can be rewritten as $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means they do not share any non-unimodular common left factors. A practical way to check for left coprimeness is to verify that the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$. Another strong indicator of coprimeness is if the degree of the determinant of $D(s)$ is equal to the McMillan degree (the order) of the system $H(s)$.\n\n**2. Setting up the Equations**\n\nLet the denominator matrix be $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. The equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$ must yield a polynomial matrix $N(s)$. Let's consider the rows of $D(s)$ one by one.\n\nLet a generic row of $D(s)$ be $[d_1(s) \\quad d_2(s)]$. The corresponding row of $N(s)$ would be $[d_1(s) \\quad d_2(s)]H(s)$.\n\\[\n[d_1(s) \\quad d_2(s)] \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\left[ d_1(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_2(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1}, \\quad d_1(s) \\right]\n\\]\nFor this row to be a polynomial vector, its components must be polynomials.\n*   The second component, $d_1(s)$, must be a polynomial.\n*   The first component, which can be written with a common denominator $s^2-1=(s-1)(s+1)$, must also be a polynomial:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{d_1(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_2(s)}{s^2-1} \\in \\mathbb{C}[s]\n    \\]\n    (where $\\mathbb{C}[s]$ is the set of polynomials in $s$).\n\n**3. Finding Conditions for the Rows of D(s)**\n\nFor the fraction to be a polynomial, its numerator must be divisible by its denominator. Let $P(s) = d_1(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_2(s)$. We require $P(s)$ to be divisible by $s^2-1$. This means the roots of the denominator, $s=1$ and $s=-1$, must also be roots of the numerator.\n\n*   **Condition at s = 1:**\n    $P(1) = d_1(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_2(1) = 2d_2(1) = 0$.\n    This implies that $d_2(1)=0$, which means $d_2(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$. Let's write $d_2(s) = (s-1)q_2(s)$ for some polynomial $q_2(s)$.\n\n*   **Condition at s = -1:**\n    $P(-1) = d_1(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_2(-1) = 4d_1(-1) + 2d_2(-1) = 0$.\n    This simplifies to $2d_1(-1) + d_2(-1) = 0$.\n    Substituting $d_2(-1) = (-1-1)q_2(-1) = -2q_2(-1)$, we get:\n    $2d_1(-1) + (-2q_2(-1)) = 0 \\implies d_1(-1) = q_2(-1)$.\n\nSo, any valid row $[d_1(s), d_2(s)]$ of $D(s)$ must satisfy these conditions:\n1.  $d_1(s)$ is a polynomial.\n2.  $d_2(s)$ has the form $(s-1)q_2(s)$ where $q_2(s)$ is a polynomial.\n3.  $d_1(-1) = q_2(-1)$.\n\n**4. Constructing a Basis for D(s)**\n\nWe need to find two linearly independent polynomial vectors $[d_1(s), d_2(s)]$ that satisfy these conditions. These vectors will form the rows of $D(s)$.\n\n*   **First Basis Vector (Row 1):**\n    Let's choose the simplest possible non-zero polynomial for $q_2(s)$, which is $q_2(s) = 1$.\n    From condition (2), this gives $d_2(s) = (s-1) \\cdot 1 = s-1$.\n    From condition (3), we must have $d_1(-1) = q_2(-1) = 1$. The simplest polynomial for $d_1(s)$ satisfying this is the constant polynomial $d_1(s)=1$.\n    So, the first row of $D(s)$ is $[1, \\quad s-1]$.\n\n*   **Second Basis Vector (Row 2):**\n    We need a second vector that is linearly independent of the first one. Let's try the next simplest choice for $q_2(s)$, which is $q_2(s) = s$.\n    From condition (2), this gives $d_2(s) = (s-1)s = s^2-s$.\n    From condition (3), we must have $d_1(-1) = q_2(-1) = -1$. The simplest polynomial for $d_1(s)$ is the constant polynomial $d_1(s) = -1$.\n    So, the second row of $D(s)$ is $[-1, \\quad s^2-s]$.\n    These two rows, $[1, s-1]$ and $[-1, s^2-s]$, are linearly independent over the field of rational functions.\n\nThis gives us the denominator matrix:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ -1 & s^2-s \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**5. Calculating the Numerator Matrix N(s)**\n\nNow we calculate the corresponding rows of $N(s)$ using $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$.\n\n*   **First Row of N(s):**\n    The second component is $d_1(s)=1$.\n    The first component is $\\frac{P(s)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{d_1(s)(s-1)^2+2d_2(s)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{1 \\cdot (s-1)^2 + 2(s-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s-1+2)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{s^2-1} = 1$.\n    So the first row of $N(s)$ is $[1, \\quad 1]$.\n\n*   **Second Row of N(s):**\n    The second component is $d_1(s)=-1$.\n    The first component is $\\frac{P(s)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{d_1(s)(s-1)^2+2d_2(s)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{-1 \\cdot (s-1)^2 + 2(s^2-s)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)[-(s-1)+2s]}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{s^2-1} = 1$.\n    So the second row of $N(s)$ is $[1, \\quad -1]$.\n\nThis gives us the numerator matrix:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**6. Verifying Coprimeness**\n\nWe have the factorization $H(s)=D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ with:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ -1 & s^2-s \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nTo verify left coprimeness, we check the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ for all $s$.\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & s^2-s & 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rank drops below 2 if and only if the two rows are linearly dependent. Suppose Row 2 = $c \\cdot$ Row 1 for some constant $c$.\nComparing the first elements: $-1 = c \\cdot 1 \\implies c = -1$.\nComparing the third elements: $1 = c \\cdot 1 \\implies c = 1$.\nSince we get a contradiction ($c=-1$ and $c=1$), the rows can never be linearly dependent for any complex value of $s$. Therefore, the matrix has full rank (2) for all $s$, and the factorization is left coprime.\n\nAlternatively, we can check the degree of the determinant of $D(s)$.\n$\\det(D(s)) = 1 \\cdot (s^2-s) - (s-1) \\cdot (-1) = s(s-1) + (s-1) = (s+1)(s-1) = s^2-1$.\nThe degree of $\\det(D(s))$ is 2. The McMillan degree of $H(s)$ can be shown to be 2. Since the degrees match, the factorization is minimal, which implies it is coprime.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nA left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ -1 & s^2-s \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ -1 & s^2-s \\end{bmatrix}$, $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
