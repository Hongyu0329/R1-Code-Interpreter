    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** Graphs with different structures. We count each unique structure once.\n*   **n-vertex-connected:** A graph is n-vertex-connected if it has more than `n` vertices and remains connected after removing any `n-1` vertices.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A graph with at least 3 vertices is 2-vertex-connected if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This is equivalent to stating that the graph has no **cut vertices** (or articulation points).\n\n**2. Necessary Conditions**\n\nFor a graph `G` with `n` vertices to be 2-vertex-connected:\n*   `n` must be at least 3. Our case is `n=5`.\n*   The minimum degree of any vertex, `Î´(G)`, must be at least 2.\n*   From the minimum degree condition, the sum of degrees is `2e >= 2n`. For `n=5`, this means `2e >= 10`, so the number of edges `e` must be at least 5.\n*   The graph must be connected.\n\nThe total number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is at most `C(5,2) = 10`. So, we only need to consider graphs with the number of edges `e` from 5 to 10.\n\n**Step-by-Step Enumeration by Number of Edges (e)**\n\n**Case e = 5:**\n*   A connected graph with `n` vertices and `n` edges is called a unicyclic graph.\n*   For a unicyclic graph to have no cut vertices, it must not have any \"tree-like\" parts branching off the cycle. This means the graph must be a simple cycle itself.\n*   For `n=5` and `e=5`, the only 2-vertex-connected graph is the cycle graph `C5`.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**Case e = 6:**\n*   We need to examine the non-isomorphic connected graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges. There are 5 such graphs. We check each for cut vertices.\n    1.  **Butterfly graph:** Two triangles sharing a single vertex. The shared vertex is a cut vertex. Not 2-connected.\n    2.  **C4 with a pendant edge:** A cycle of 4 vertices with a fifth vertex attached to one vertex of the cycle. The attachment point is a cut vertex. Not 2-connected.\n    3.  **C3 with a path of length 2:** A triangle where one vertex is also the start of a two-edge path. The vertex connecting the cycle and the path is a cut vertex. Not 2-connected.\n    4.  **The House Graph:** A `C4` (the house) with a `K3` (the roof) sharing one edge. This graph is 2-connected (removing any vertex leaves a connected graph).\n    5.  **The complete bipartite graph K_{2,3}:** This graph is 2-connected.\n*   Thus, there are 2 non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 6 edges.\n*   **Count: 2**\n\n**Case e = 7:**\n*   Let's analyze if a connected graph `G` with `n=5` and `e=7` can have a cut vertex `v`.\n*   If `v` is a cut vertex, then `G-v` (the graph with `v` removed) is disconnected. `G-v` has 4 vertices. The only way to partition 4 vertices into two or more components is `3+1` or `2+2`.\n    *   **Partition 2+2:** Let the components be `H1` and `H2`. The maximum number of edges in `G-v` is `e(H1) + e(H2) = 1 + 1 = 2`. The maximum number of edges from `v` to `V(G-v)` is 4. Total edges in `G` would be at most `2 + 4 = 6`. Since `e=7`, this case is impossible.\n    *   **Partition 3+1:** Let the components be `H1` (3 vertices) and `H2` (1 vertex). The maximum edges in `G-v` is `e(H1) + e(H2) = C(3,2) + 0 = 3`. The maximum edges from `v` to `V(G-v)` is 4. The total number of edges would be at most `3 + 4 = 7`.\n*   For the edge count to be exactly 7, all maximums must be met. This means: `H1` must be a complete graph `K3`, and `v` must be connected to all other 4 vertices. This structure is a `K4` (formed by `v` and the vertices of `H1`) with a pendant vertex attached (the vertex from `H2`). This is a unique graph, let's call it \"K4 with a tail\". This graph has a cut vertex.\n*   The number of non-isomorphic connected graphs with 5 vertices and 7 edges is known to be 6.\n*   Since only one of these six graphs (`K4` with a tail) has a cut vertex, the remaining 5 must be 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count: 5**\n\n**Case e = 8:**\n*   Following the logic from `e=7`, the maximum number of edges in a graph with `n=5` and a cut vertex is 7. Therefore, any connected graph with `e=8` must be 2-vertex-connected.\n*   The number of non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 8 edges is equal to the number of graphs with 5 vertices and `C(5,2) - 8 = 2` edges (by taking complements).\n*   There are two non-isomorphic graphs with 2 edges:\n    1.  Two disjoint edges (`2K2`).\n    2.  A path of length 2 (`P3`).\n*   The complements of these graphs, `K5 - 2K2` and `K5 - P3`, are the two graphs with 8 edges. Both are connected.\n*   Thus, there are 2 2-vertex-connected graphs with 8 edges.\n*   **Count: 2**\n\n**Case e = 9:**\n*   Any connected graph with `e=9` must be 2-vertex-connected.\n*   The number of graphs with 9 edges is the same as the number of graphs with `10 - 9 = 1` edge. There is only one such graph.\n*   The graph is `K5` with one edge removed (`K5-e`). It is connected and 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**Case e = 10:**\n*   The only graph is the complete graph `K5`.\n*   `K5` is 4-vertex-connected, and therefore 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   e=5: 1\n*   e=6: 2\n*   e=7: 5\n*   e=8: 2\n*   e=9: 1\n*   e=10: 1\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 12."
