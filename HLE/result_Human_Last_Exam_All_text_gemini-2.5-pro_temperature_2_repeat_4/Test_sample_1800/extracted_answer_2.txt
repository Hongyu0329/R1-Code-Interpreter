The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value but depends on the target reaction due to different catalytic mechanisms.
*   **For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction,** a higher molar ratio of approximately **0.2 to 0.5** (corresponding to 10-20 wt.% Ni) is optimal. This ratio maximizes the number of active Ni sites interfaced with the ceria support while maintaining high dispersion and avoiding particle aggregation.
*   **For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS),** a lower molar ratio of approximately **0.05 to 0.18** (corresponding to 5-15 mol% Ni doping) is ideal. In this application, Ni acts as a dopant to enhance the bulk redox properties (oxygen storage and release) of the ceria material itself.
