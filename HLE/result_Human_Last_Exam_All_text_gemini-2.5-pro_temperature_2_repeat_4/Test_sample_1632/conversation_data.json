    "This problem asks for the value of a(10), where a(n) is the number of n-step self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on a Manhattan lattice (a 2D square grid).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** A grid of points (x, y) where x and y are integers. A walk proceeds from one point to an adjacent one, either horizontally or vertically.\n*   **n-step Walk:** A sequence of n+1 vertices (v₀, v₁, ..., vₙ) where v₀ is the starting point and each subsequent vertex vᵢ is a neighbor of the previous vertex vᵢ₋₁.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk where all vertices (v₀, v₁, ..., vₙ) are distinct. The path cannot cross or touch itself at any point.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of n-step SAWs. By convention, we count the number of walks starting from a fixed origin, say (0,0), since the lattice is uniform.\n\n**2. Calculating for Small Values of n**\n\nThis helps to understand the process and its growing complexity.\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    *   Start at (0,0).\n    *   There are 4 possible first steps: to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1).\n    *   All are valid 1-step SAWs.\n    *   So, **a(1) = 4**.\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    *   Consider any of the 4 walks of length 1, e.g., (0,0) → (1,0).\n    *   From the endpoint (1,0), there are 4 possible moves: to (0,0), (2,0), (1,1), (1,-1).\n    *   The move back to (0,0) is forbidden because the walk must be self-avoiding.\n    *   This leaves 3 valid choices for the second step.\n    *   By symmetry, this applies to all 4 starting moves.\n    *   So, a(2) = (choices for 1st step) × (choices for 2nd step) = 4 × 3 = **12**.\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    *   We extend the 12 walks of length 2.\n    *   Consider a 2-step walk, e.g., (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0). The endpoint is (2,0). The vertices visited are {(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)}. From (2,0), we cannot move back to (1,0). The other three neighbors of (2,0) are new to the path. So, there are 3 valid moves.\n    *   Consider another type of 2-step walk, e.g., (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1). The endpoint is (1,1). The vertices visited are {(0,0), (1,0), (1,1)}. From (1,1), we cannot move back to (1,0). The other three neighbors of (1,1) are (0,1), (2,1), (1,2). None of these have been visited. So, there are 3 valid moves.\n    *   For any 2-step SAW, the third step has 3 valid choices because it's not long enough to risk non-local intersections.\n    *   So, a(3) = a(2) × 3 = 12 × 3 = **36**.\n\n**3. The Complication at n=4**\n\n*   For the 4th step, the walk can be long enough to have its endpoint be adjacent to a previously visited point other than the immediately preceding one.\n*   Let's analyze the 36 walks of length 3. We must count how many valid extensions each one has.\n    *   **\"Open\" paths:** Most 3-step paths do not have their endpoint adjacent to the starting point. For these paths, the 4th step still has 3 valid choices.\n    *   **\"Closing\" paths:** Some 3-step paths form a \"C\" shape, where the endpoint is a neighbor of the starting point. Example: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (0,1). The endpoint v₃=(0,1) is adjacent to the start point v₀=(0,0).\n        *   How many such paths? First step has 4 choices. The second must be a turn (2 choices). The third must be a turn in the \"closing\" direction (1 choice). Total = 4 × 2 × 1 = 8 paths.\n        *   For these 8 paths, let's look at the possible 4th steps from the endpoint v₃. The neighbors of v₃ are v₂, v₀, and two new points. The moves to v₂ (reversing) and v₀ (visiting the start) are both forbidden. This leaves only 2 valid choices.\n    *   **Calculating a(4):**\n        *   Number of \"closing\" 3-step paths = 8. They have 2 extensions each. (8 × 2 = 16 walks)\n        *   Number of \"open\" 3-step paths = 36 - 8 = 28. They have 3 extensions each. (28 × 3 = 84 walks)\n        *   a(4) = 16 + 84 = **100**.\n\n**4. The Problem for n=10**\n\n*   The method of classifying all (n-1)-step walks and their possible extensions becomes exponentially more difficult as n increases. A manual calculation for a(10) is practically impossible and highly prone to error.\n*   This is a famous and unsolved problem in mathematics for finding a simple closed-form formula for a(n). The values of a(n) are known due to extensive computer enumeration. This problem effectively tests the knowledge of these computed values or the method to obtain them programmatically.\n\n**5. Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\nThe sequence for a(n) is a well-known sequence in combinatorics, listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411. We can retrieve the value from this established resource.\n\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\n<<<44100>>>"
