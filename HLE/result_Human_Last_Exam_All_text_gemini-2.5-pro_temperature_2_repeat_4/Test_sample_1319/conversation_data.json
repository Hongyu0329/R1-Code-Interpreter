    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify all mountains mentioned by name in the Iliad.**\nThe first step is to comb through the text of the Iliad and list every mountain that is explicitly named.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, frequently mentioned throughout the epic. It is the tallest mountain in Greece (2,918 m / 9,573 ft) and serves as our starting point, which must be excluded from the final answer.\n*   **Mount Ida:** Mentioned many times as a place from which the gods, especially Zeus, watch the Trojan War.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (now called Saos or Fengari):** In Book 13, Poseidon climbs to its summit to watch the battle on the Trojan plain.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, Hera passes over Mount Athos during her flight from Olympus to Ida.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** In Book 16, Achilles' formidable spear is described as having come from the summit of Mount Pelion.\n*   **Mount Tmolus (now called Bozdağ):** In the Catalogue of Ships in Book 2, the warriors from Maeonia are described as living \"under snowy Tmolus.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific \"historical\" location and height of each mountain.**\nNow we must find the real-world location and elevation for each mountain mentioned to make a valid comparison.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** Height: 2,918 m (9,573 ft).\n*   **Mount Ida:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** There are two famous Mount Idas in Greek geography. One is on the island of Crete (2,456 m), revered as the birthplace of Zeus. The other is in Anatolia near Troy (now Kaz Dağı, 1,774 m). The context of the *Iliad* makes it clear that the mountain being referred to is the one near Troy. For example, Zeus watches the battle at Troy from its peaks, and Hera's flight path in Book 14 (over Athos and Lemnos) leads directly to the Anatolian Ida. Therefore, we use the height of the Trojan Mount Ida: **1,774 m (5,820 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Saos/Fengari):** The highest point on the island of Samothrace. Height: **1,611 m (5,285 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Athos:** A mountain on the Chalcidice peninsula in Greece. Height: **2,033 m (6,670 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** A mountain in Thessaly, Greece. Height: **1,624 m (5,328 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ):** A mountain in Lydia, Anatolia (modern Turkey). Height: **2,157 m (7,077 ft)**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the heights of the identified mountains (excluding Olympus).**\nLet's list the mountains mentioned in the Iliad, besides Olympus, in descending order of their real-world height.\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ):** 2,157 m\n2.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n3.  **Mount Ida (near Troy/Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n5.  **Mount Samothrace (Saos/Fengari):** 1,611 m\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the final answer.**\nBased on the comparative list, the tallest mountain among this group is Mount Tmolus. Although less central to the plot than Mount Ida, it is explicitly mentioned in the text and is demonstrably taller than all other contenders apart from Olympus.\n\n***\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
