    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Topic:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   **Measurement Method:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **Key Phrase:** \"HRV is computed as a value between heartbeats.\"\n    *   **The Question:** What is that value called?\n\n2.  **Analyze the Process:**\n    *   A device, likely a wearable, uses PPG to detect the pulse wave in the blood vessels. Each peak in this wave corresponds to a heartbeat.\n    *   The system measures the time that elapses between one peak (one heartbeat) and the very next peak (the next heartbeat).\n    *   This measurement is a time duration, typically expressed in milliseconds (ms).\n    *   A series of these time durations is collected. For example: 800 ms, 820 ms, 790 ms, 815 ms, etc.\n    *   HRV is not one of these single values, but rather a statistical analysis *of the variation* within this series of values. For example, standard deviation (SDNN) or root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) are common HRV metrics.\n    *   The question, however, is asking for the name of the foundational measurement â€“ the time *between* two consecutive beats.\n\n3.  **Identify the Terminology (Careful Points):**\n    *   **R-R Interval:** This is the gold-standard term. It specifically refers to the time interval between the peaks of the \"R wave\" on an Electrocardiogram (ECG). While this is the most common term in clinical literature, the question specifies the use of PPG, not ECG.\n    *   **Peak-to-Peak (P-P) Interval or Inter-Pulse Interval (IPI):** Since PPG measures the pulse wave, the time between consecutive pulse peaks is technically called the P-P Interval or IPI. This is a more precise term for data derived from PPG.\n    *   **Inter-beat Interval (IBI):** This is the most general and widely understood term. It refers to the time interval between consecutive heartbeats, regardless of the measurement technology (ECG, PPG, etc.). It serves as an umbrella term for both R-R intervals and P-P intervals.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The value measured between heartbeats, which forms the basis for all HRV calculations, is the time duration of that interval. While specific terms like \"R-R Interval\" (for ECG) or \"P-P Interval\" (for PPG) exist, the most accurate and common general term is the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\n***\n\nThe value representing the time between consecutive heartbeats, used to compute HRV, is called the **Inter-beat Interval**, often abbreviated as **IBI**.\n\n<<<Inter-beat Interval>>>"
