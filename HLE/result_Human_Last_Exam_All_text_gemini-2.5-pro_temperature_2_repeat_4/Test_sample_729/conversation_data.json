    "This problem asks for the number of \"power subgroups\" in the generalized quaternion group of order 128.\n\n### Step 1: Interpret the Question\nThe term \"power subgroup\" is not a standard term in group theory. The most reasonable interpretation in the context of such a question is a **cyclic subgroup**. A cyclic subgroup is a subgroup generated by taking all the integer powers of a single element of the group. Let $g$ be an element of a group $G$. The set $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{g^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ forms a cyclic subgroup. We will proceed by counting the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of order 128.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Generalized Quaternion Group $Q_{128}$\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, has the presentation:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\nFor the group of order 128, we have $4n = 128$, so $n=32$.\nThus, our group is $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Structure of $Q_{128}$\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be divided into two disjoint sets:\n1.  The elements that are powers of $x$. This set is the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n2.  The elements of the form $yx^i$. This set is the coset $y\\langle x \\rangle = \\{yx^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$. This set has 64 elements.\n\nWe can count the cyclic subgroups by considering the subgroups generated by elements from each of these two sets.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Powers of $x$\nThe subgroups generated by elements of $\\langle x \\rangle$ are simply the subgroups of the cyclic group $\\langle x \\rangle$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_{64}$.\nA fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that a cyclic group of order $N$ has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $N$.\nHere, the order is $N=64=2^6$. The divisors of 64 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\nThe number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1=7$.\nThese 7 subgroups are all cyclic and are:\n*   $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{e\\}$ (order 1)\n*   $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n*   $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n*   $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n*   $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n*   $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n*   $\\langle x^1 \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$ (order 64)\n\nThis gives us **7** distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$\nLet's consider an element $g$ of the form $yx^i$ from the coset $y\\langle x \\rangle$. We first determine the order of this element.\n$g^2 = (yx^i)^2 = yx^iyx^i$.\nFrom the relation $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}$, we can derive $xy=yx^{-1}$, and by induction, $x^iy = yx^{-i}$.\nSo, $g^2 = y(x^iy)x^i = y(yx^{-i})x^i = y^2x^{-i}x^i = y^2$.\nUsing the group relation $y^2 = x^{32}$, we have $g^2 = x^{32}$.\nThe order of $x^{32}$ is $64/\\text{gcd}(32,64) = 64/32=2$. So $g^2 \\ne e$.\nLet's compute $g^4$:\n$g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = e$.\nSince $g^2 \\ne e$ and $g^4=e$, the order of any element $g = yx^i$ is 4.\nThis means all 64 elements in the coset $y\\langle x \\rangle$ are of order 4, and each generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n\nWe need to determine how many of these 64 subgroups are distinct.\nLet $H_i = \\langle yx^i \\rangle$. The elements of this subgroup are $\\{e, yx^i, (yx^i)^2, (yx^i)^3\\}$.\n$H_i = \\{e, yx^i, x^{32}, (yx^i)^3\\}$.\n$(yx^i)^3 = g^3 = g \\cdot g^2 = (yx^i)(x^{32}) = yx^{i+32}$.\nSo, $H_i = \\{e, yx^i, x^{32}, yx^{i+32}\\}$.\nA cyclic group of order 4 has two generators (the elements of order 4). The elements of order 4 in $H_i$ are $yx^i$ and $yx^{i+32}$.\nThis means that $\\langle yx^i \\rangle = \\langle yx^{i+32} \\rangle$.\nSo, the 64 elements of the form $yx^i$ form pairs $\\{yx^i, yx^{i+32}\\}$ that generate the same subgroup. The number of distinct subgroups is therefore half the number of elements: $64 / 2 = 32$.\n\nThese 32 subgroups are all of order 4. We must ensure they are distinct from the subgroups counted in Step 4. The only subgroup of order 4 from Step 4 is $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle = \\{e, x^{16}, x^{32}, x^{48}\\}$. All its elements are powers of $x$. The 32 new subgroups all contain elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ (e.g., $yx^i$). Therefore, they are all distinct from the subgroups of $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\nThis gives us **32** new cyclic subgroups.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Total\nThe total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of the counts from the two disjoint collections of subgroups.\nTotal number = (Subgroups within $\\langle x \\rangle$) + (Subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$)\nTotal number = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nThere are 39 power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<39>>>"
