    "This problem requires finding a state feedback gain matrix `F` for a linear system defined by matrices `A` and `B`, such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system `A + BF` are at specific locations in the complex plane.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\n*   The state matrix is `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`.\n*   The input matrix is `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`.\n*   We need to find a 2x2 feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has eigenvalues at `λ = -1 + j` and `λ = -1 - j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair. The characteristic polynomial `p(λ)` for a system with these eigenvalues is:\n`p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the identity `(x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2`, we get:\n`p(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\nSo, the desired characteristic equation for the closed-loop system is `λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n**3. Check for Controllability and Simplify the Problem**\n*   Pole placement is possible if the system `(A, B)` is controllable. The controllability matrix is `C = [B, AB]`. Since the input matrix `B` itself is a 2x2 matrix with `det(B) = 1*0 - 2*1 = -2 ≠ 0`, `B` is full rank. This means the system is controllable.\n*   Because the system is controllable, there are infinite solutions for the 2x2 matrix `F`. We can simplify the problem by finding a solution where the feedback is applied through only one of the inputs.\n*   Let's see if the system is controllable using only the first input channel (`b1 = [1; 1]`). The controllability matrix for this case would be `C1 = [b1, Ab1]`.\n    `Ab1 = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] * [1, 1]' = [0, 1]'`\n    `C1 = [[1, 0], [1, 1]]`\n    `det(C1) = 1*1 - 0*1 = 1 ≠ 0`.\n*   Since `det(C1) ≠ 0`, the system is controllable using only the first input. This means we can set the feedback for the second input to zero. We can achieve this by setting the second row of `F` to zero.\n    Let `F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`.\n\n**4. Formulate the Closed-Loop System's Characteristic Polynomial**\nNow, we calculate the closed-loop matrix `A + BF` using our simplified `F`.\n*   `BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [0, 0]] = [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]]`\n*   `A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]] = [[f1 - 1, f2 + 1], [f1 + 1, f2]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A + BF` is `det(λI - (A + BF))`:\n`det([[λ - (f1 - 1), -(f2 + 1)], [-(f1 + 1), λ - f2]])`\n`= (λ - f1 + 1)(λ - f2) - (-(f2 + 1))(-(f1 + 1))`\n`= (λ^2 - f2λ - f1λ + f1f2 + λ - f2) - (f1f2 + f1 + f2 + 1)`\n`= λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2)λ + (f1f2 - f2 - f1f2 - f1 - f2 - 1)`\n`= λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2)λ + (-f1 - 2f2 - 1)`\n\n**5. Solve for the Elements of F**\nWe now equate the coefficients of our calculated polynomial with the desired polynomial, `λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n*   **Coefficient of λ:**\n    `1 - f1 - f2 = 2  =>  f1 + f2 = -1` (Equation 1)\n*   **Constant term:**\n    `-f1 - 2f2 - 1 = 2  =>  -f1 - 2f2 = 3  =>  f1 + 2f2 = -3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations:\n1) `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2) `f1 + 2f2 = -3`\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(f1 + 2f2) - (f1 + f2) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` back into Equation 1:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nTherefore, `f1 = 1` and `f2 = -2`.\n\n**6. State the Final Answer**\nThe calculated state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\nThis is one possible solution. Other solutions exist, for instance, by setting the first row of F to zero instead.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
