    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The defining characteristic is a specific, nuanced emotion: not just missing Earth, but feeling *ashamed* for missing something as simple and mundane as the sound of rustling leaves. This detail is crucial as it points to a character's internal conflict and psychological state.\n\n**2. List the Careful Points**\n\n*   **Film Specificity:** The question is explicitly about the 1972 Tarkovsky version, not the original Stanis≈Çaw Lem novel or the 2002 American remake. Dialogue and character interpretations differ significantly between these works.\n*   **Character Psychology:** Tarkovsky's films are known for their deep philosophical and psychological explorations. The line in question is not just a passing comment but reveals a character's profound sense of alienation and nostalgia.\n*   **Process of Elimination:** We need to consider the personality and circumstances of each character listed in the answer choices.\n    *   **Kris Kelvin:** He is the protagonist and certainly misses Earth, as shown in the extensive opening sequence at his dacha. However, his primary struggle on the station is his guilt and relationship with the replica of his dead wife, Hari. His nostalgia is more direct and less defined by \"shame.\"\n    *   **Hari:** She is a \"Visitor,\" a creation of the Solaris ocean based on Kris's memories. She has no actual memories of Earth and therefore cannot miss it. Her journey is one of gaining self-awareness.\n    *   **Snaut:** A cyberneticist who has been on the station for a long time. He is portrayed as weary, cynical, yet highly intelligent and philosophical. He often serves as an expositor, explaining the strange phenomena to Kris and reflecting on the human condition in space. A feeling of shame over a \"sentimental\" longing for Earth fits his jaded, intellectual character.\n    *   **Sartorius:** A cold, rational, and somewhat ruthless scientist. He is focused on studying and controlling the Solaris phenomenon. He actively suppresses emotion and would see missing rustling leaves as a contemptible weakness, not something he would confess, even with shame.\n    *   **Gibarian:** He is dead before Kris arrives. We only see him in a disturbing video message he left behind. His message conveys despair and fear, not a reflective sense of nostalgia or shame.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer**\n\n1.  The key phrase is \"ashamed to miss.\" This implies a conflict between a character's professional, scientific self and their fundamental human needs. They feel their longing for Earth is a weakness they should have overcome.\n2.  Sartorius is immediately unlikely, as he prides himself on his lack of sentimentality. Hari and Gibarian can be ruled out for the reasons stated above.\n3.  The choice is between Kris and Snaut. While Kris is homesick, the film frames his journey around the personal tragedy of Hari.\n4.  Snaut, on the other hand, frequently engages in long, philosophical monologues about humanity's purpose in space and their detachment from Earth. In one of his conversations with Kris, he muses on their predicament.\n5.  Specifically, it is Snaut who says something to the effect of: \"Sometimes I get so homesick for Earth, I'm ashamed to admit it... For the rustling of the leaves.\" (The exact wording can vary slightly by translation). This line perfectly encapsulates his character: a brilliant scientist who has spent years in the cold void of space, only to realize that what he truly craves is the simplest sensory experience of his home world, and he feels shame at this \"unscientific\" human feeling.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of character roles and specific dialogue from the film, the character who expresses shame at missing the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
