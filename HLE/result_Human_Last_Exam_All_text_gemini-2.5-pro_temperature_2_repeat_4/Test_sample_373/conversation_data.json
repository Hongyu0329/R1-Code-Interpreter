    "This problem requires us to calculate the probability of sampling a specific edge (the bottleneck edge) in a particular type of graph (a barbell graph) under a specific sampling process (randomized uniform gossiping).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure\n*   **Graph Type:** A \"barbell graph\". A standard barbell graph consists of two identical complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single edge.\n*   **Number of Nodes (N):** The graph has 10 nodes. To make the two cliques identical, we divide the nodes evenly. Thus, the graph consists of two 5-node complete graphs (K5).\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   Let's call the first clique **Clique A** and the second **Clique B**.\n    *   Clique A has 5 nodes. Let's label them {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Since it's a complete graph, every node is connected to every other node within this set.\n    *   Clique B has 5 nodes. Let's label them {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. This is also a complete graph.\n*   **The Bottleneck Edge:** This is the single edge that connects the two cliques. Let's assume this edge connects node 5 from Clique A to node 6 from Clique B. So, the bottleneck edge is (5, 6).\n*   **Weights:** The problem states \"uniform weights\". For this sampling algorithm, this means all existing edges are treated equally, which is the standard unweighted assumption.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Node Degrees\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. We need to find the degrees of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge, which are node 5 and node 6.\n*   **Degree of Node 5:** Node 5 is in Clique A. It is connected to the other 4 nodes in Clique A ({1, 2, 3, 4}) and to node 6 in Clique B via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   `degree(5) = 4 (internal connections) + 1 (bottleneck connection) = 5`.\n*   **Degree of Node 6:** Node 6 is in Clique B. It is connected to the other 4 nodes in Clique B ({7, 8, 9, 10}) and to node 5 in Clique A.\n    *   `degree(6) = 4 (internal connections) + 1 (bottleneck connection) = 5`.\n*   **(For completeness) Degree of other nodes:** Any other node (e.g., node 1 in Clique A) is only connected to the 4 other nodes in its own clique. So, `degree(1) = 4`.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Sampling Process\n*   **Randomized Uniform Gossiping:** This is a node-centric sampling process. A single sampling event occurs as follows:\n    1.  A node, let's call it `u`, is selected uniformly at random from all `N=10` nodes in the graph. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/N = 1/10`.\n    2.  The chosen node `u` then selects one of its neighbors, let's call it `v`, uniformly at random from its set of neighbors. The probability of selecting a specific neighbor `v` is `1/degree(u)`.\n*   The edge sampled by this process is the edge `(u, v)`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability\nWe want to find the total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (5, 6). This can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  We select node 5 first, and it then selects its neighbor node 6.\n2.  We select node 6 first, and it then selects its neighbor node 5.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of each case:\n*   **Case 1: Select node 5, then node 6.**\n    *   The probability of selecting node 5 from the 10 nodes is `P(select 5) = 1/10`.\n    *   Given we've selected node 5, the probability of it selecting node 6 from its 5 neighbors is `P(5 selects 6) = 1/degree(5) = 1/5`.\n    *   The probability of this entire event is `P(Case 1) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **Case 2: Select node 6, then node 5.**\n    *   The probability of selecting node 6 from the 10 nodes is `P(select 6) = 1/10`.\n    *   Given we've selected node 6, the probability of it selecting node 5 from its 5 neighbors is `P(6 selects 5) = 1/degree(6) = 1/5`.\n    *   The probability of this entire event is `P(Case 2) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (5, 6) is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases:\n*   `P(sample edge (5,6)) = P(Case 1) + P(Case 2) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50`.\n\nSimplifying the fraction gives `1/25`.\n\nIn decimal form, this is `0.04`."
