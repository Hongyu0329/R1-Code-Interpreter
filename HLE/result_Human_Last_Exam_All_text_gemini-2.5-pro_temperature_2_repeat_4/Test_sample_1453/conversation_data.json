    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Protein Sequence and Identify the Heptad Repeat:**\n    The provided sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. Coiled-coils are characterized by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern, known as a heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the coiled-coil structure, mediating the interactions between the helices.\n\n2.  **Determine the Register of the Heptad Repeat:**\n    We need to align the sequence to the `(abcdefg)` pattern. We look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues separated by two or three other residues, corresponding to the `a-b-c-d` or `d-e-f-g-a` spacing.\n    Let's test potential alignments. A very successful alignment is achieved by assigning the first major hydrophobic residue, Isoleucine (I) at position 3, as the `d` position.\n\n    Let's apply this register to the sequence (ignoring the flanking N-terminal `GE` and C-terminal `G`):\n    *   **Repeat 1:** `I A Q S L K E` -> Heptad positions: `d e f g a b c`\n    *   **Repeat 2:** `I A K S L K E` -> Heptad positions: `d e f g a b c`\n    *   **Repeat 3:** `I A W S L K E` -> Heptad positions: `d e f g a b c`\n    *   **Repeat 4:** `I A Q S L K`  -> Heptad positions: `d e f g a b c`\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Residues at Positions `a` and `d`:**\n    Based on the alignment above, we can list the amino acids occupying the crucial core `a` and `d` positions for each of the four repeats:\n    *   **`a` positions:** Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L)\n    *   **`d` positions:** Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I)\n\n    The consistent hydrophobic core pattern is `(a=L, d=I)n`. This specific, regular pattern is a strong determinant of the protein's oligomeric state.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Packing Efficiency (\"Knobs-into-Holes\") for the `(a=L, d=I)n` Motif:**\n    The final oligomeric state is determined by which structure (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) allows for the most efficient packing of the `a` and `d` side chains (\"knobs\") into the spaces on the opposing helices (\"holes\"). The geometry and steric properties of the amino acid side chains are critical.\n    *   **Isoleucine (I)** is a β-branched amino acid, meaning the side chain branches at the carbon closest to the backbone. This makes it sterically bulky and conformationally restricted.\n    *   **Leucine (L)** is a γ-branched amino acid. The branching is further from the backbone, making it more flexible.\n\n    Now let's consider the common oligomeric states:\n    *   **Dimer (2-stranded):** Can accommodate many hydrophobic combinations but doesn't specifically require this alternating `L`/`I` pattern. Leucine zippers, for instance, are often dimers with Leucine at all `d` positions.\n    *   **Tetramer (4-stranded):** A well-known rule for tetramer formation is the presence of a β-branched amino acid (like Isoleucine) at the `a` position and a non-β-branched one (like Leucine) at the `d` position, i.e., `(a=I, d=L)n`. The reason is that the `a` position in a trimer is sterically hindered and disfavors the bulky Isoleucine. This \"negative constraint\" against forming a trimer promotes tetramer formation, where the packing environment can better accommodate the Isoleucine at the `a` position. The sequence in this question is the *reverse*: `(a=L, d=I)n`.\n    *   **Trimer (3-stranded):** In a parallel trimer, the three `a` positions from the different helices pack together, and the three `d` positions pack together.\n        *   **`a` position packing:** The `a` position can easily accommodate the flexible Leucine (L) side chain. There is no steric hindrance preventing the formation of a trimer.\n        *   **`d` position packing:** The `d` position also readily accommodates Isoleucine (I).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The `(a=L, d=I)n` pattern fits perfectly into the packing model of a trimeric coiled-coil. Since the feature that forces tetramerization (`I` at the `a` position) is absent, and the pattern is highly favorable for a trimer, this is the most likely oligomeric state.\n\n5.  **Final Decision:**\n    The sequence has a clear `(a=L, d=I)n` core repeat. This pattern is highly characteristic of a trimeric coiled-coil because Leucine is well-tolerated at the `a` positions and Isoleucine is well-tolerated at the `d` positions of a three-stranded structure.\n\nThe predicted oligomeric state is 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
