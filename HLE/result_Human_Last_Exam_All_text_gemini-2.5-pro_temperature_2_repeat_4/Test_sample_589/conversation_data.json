    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's key elements.**\nThe question asks for a specific Hollywood feature film with the following distinct components:\n1.  **Produced by a major film studio:** This rules out independent films with limited distribution or foreign films.\n2.  **A teenager:** The character performing the action is in their teen years.\n3.  **Rides a pink bike:** This is a very specific and memorable visual detail. The color is crucial.\n4.  **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car:** This describes a specific, confrontational, or intercepting action.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"Pink Bike\" element.**\nThis is the most unique identifier. While many films feature teenagers on bikes (e.g., *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *The Goonies*), the bike's color is rarely pink. Pee-wee Herman's iconic bike in *Pee-wee's Big Adventure* is famously red, not pink. This specificity significantly narrows the search.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the elements.**\nWe need to find a film that combines a teenager, a pink bike, and a scene involving an oncoming vehicle. Let's consider the film *Napoleon Dynamite* (2004).\n\n**Step 4: Verify *Napoleon Dynamite* against the criteria.**\n*   **Major Film Studio Production:** *Napoleon Dynamite* was co-produced by Fox Searchlight Pictures and MTV Films, with distribution assistance from Paramount Pictures. Fox Searchlight (now Searchlight Pictures) and Paramount are considered major studios, so this criterion is met.\n*   **A Teenager:** The character Deb Bradshaw is a student at Preston High School with the other main characters and is therefore a teenager.\n*   **Rides a pink bike:** Deb famously rides a light pink, 10-speed bicycle.\n*   **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car:** There is a specific scene where Napoleon is trying to get a ride from his brother, Kip. Kip refuses and starts to pull away in his orange 1975 Dodge Tradesman van. To stop the vehicle and offer Napoleon a ride to the school dance, Deb pedals her pink bike directly into the van's path, forcing Kip to stop. This action perfectly matches the description of a teenager on a pink bike pedaling toward an oncoming vehicle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll the specific conditions described in the question are met in a memorable scene from the movie *Napoleon Dynamite*.\n\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
