    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to find the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position performed by Natalia Osipova in her Act I variation as Kitri in the 2008 Bolshoi Ballet production of *Don Quixote*.\n\n2.  **Identify the Specific Performance and Choreography:**\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Role:** Kitri\n    *   **Ballet:** *Don Quixote*\n    *   **Act:** Act I, Kitri's solo variation (often performed with castanets).\n    *   **Company/Year:** Bolshoi Ballet, 2008. This specifies the Alexei Fadeyechev production, which was standard for the Bolshoi at that time. While video from the exact year 2008 may be scarce, her iconic performance in this role from that era is well-documented, most famously in the 2011 Bolshoi cinema broadcast which features the same established choreography.\n\n3.  **Break Down the Ballet Step:**\n    *   **Pirouette:** A turn on one leg.\n    *   **Single-turn:** The dancer completes exactly one rotation.\n    *   **En dehors:** An outward turn, away from the supporting leg. This is the standard direction for this particular sequence.\n    *   **From the fifth position:** The turn is initiated from a fifth position plié, and the dancer lands back in the fifth position to prepare for the next turn.\n\n4.  **Locate the Sequence in the Variation:** Kitri's Act I variation is a signature part of the ballet. Towards the end of this solo, after sequences with castanets and traveling steps (like piqué turns), there is a climactic series of stationary turns performed at the center of the stage. This is the sequence in question.\n\n5.  **Analyze and Count the Turns:**\n    *   In this specific choreographic sequence, Osipova stands center stage.\n    *   She prepares in fifth position.\n    *   She executes a rapid succession of single pirouettes en dehors.\n    *   Each turn begins from and concludes in a clean fifth position before immediately launching into the next.\n    *   By carefully observing recordings of her performance in this production, we can count the number of turns in this continuous series. She performs a set of **eight** of these specific single turns. After these eight turns, the choreography transitions to the final few bars, which typically include a set of faster multiple pirouettes to conclude the variation.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Consistency of Choreography:** Set solos (variations) in major classical productions have standardized choreography. A principal dancer would perform the same number of turns in this sequence for every performance within that production's run.\n*   **Specificity of the Question:** The query is very precise (\"single-turn,\" \"from the fifth position\"), distinguishing this sequence from other turns in the ballet (like the fouetté turns in Act III or the piqué turns in the Act I manège).\n*   **Verification:** The number can be verified by watching widely available recordings of Osipova's performance with the Bolshoi Ballet during that period. The count is consistently eight for this specific sequence.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the standard choreography for the Bolshoi Ballet's production of *Don Quixote* during the period Natalia Osipova was starring, she performed a sequence of 8 single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position in her Act I variation.\n\n<<<8>>>"
