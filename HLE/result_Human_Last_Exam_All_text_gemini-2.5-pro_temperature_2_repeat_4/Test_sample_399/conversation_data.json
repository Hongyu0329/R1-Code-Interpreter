    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1) \\cdot x^2 $$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation. We can see that the variables $x$ and $t$ can be separated.\n\n**2. Separate the variables**\n\nTo separate the variables, we group all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other side. We can divide by $x^2$ and multiply by $dt$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt $$\n**Careful point:** We have divided by $x^2$. This is permissible only if $x^2 \\neq 0$, which means $x(t)$ is not the constant zero function. We are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$, so our solution is not $x(t)=0$. Therefore, this step is valid.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides**\n\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   The left side: $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n*   The right side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$\n\nAfter integrating, we get the general solution, including a constant of integration, C:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C**\n\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = -8$. This means that when $t=0$, the value of $x$ is $-8$. We substitute these values into our general solution to find the specific value of C for this problem.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**5. Write the particular solution**\n\nNow we substitute the value of C back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1)**\n\nThe goal is to find $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nFirst, combine the terms on the right side.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2} $$\nSo the equation becomes:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 8.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{4}{8} $$\nSo we have:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8} $$\n**Careful point:** Be careful with the negative signs. We can multiply both sides by -1.\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\n\n**7. Solve for x(1)**\n\nTo find $x(1)$, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n<<<$8/3$>>>"
