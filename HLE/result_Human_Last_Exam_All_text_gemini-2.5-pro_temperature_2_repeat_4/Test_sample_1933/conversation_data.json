    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate is a property that an element in the domain can either have or not have.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This denotes a fragment of First-Order Logic. The formulas in this fragment are constructed using:\n    *   The predicates from $S$, i.e., atomic formulas of the form $P_i(x)$.\n    *   The logical connectives: conjunction ($\\land$), truth ($\\top$), and falsity ($\\bot$).\n    *   The existential quantifier ($\\exists$).\n    *   Negation ($\\neg$), disjunction ($\\lor$), universal quantification ($\\forall$), and implication ($\\to$) are not allowed.\n*   **VC Dimension**: We need to find the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the concept class defined by this logic.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Concept Class\nThe question asks for the VC dimension of a logic fragment. This is typically interpreted in the \"definable sets\" setting. We consider formulas with one free variable, say $x$. For any given model (or structure) $M$ for the schema $S$, a formula $\\phi(x)$ defines a *concept*, which is the set of elements in the universe of $M$ that satisfy the formula.\n\n*   A model $M$ consists of a universe of elements $U^M$ and an interpretation for each predicate, $P_i^M \\subseteq U^M$.\n*   A formula $\\phi(x)$ in the logic defines a concept $C_M(\\phi) = \\{ a \\in U^M \\mid M \\models \\phi(a) \\}$.\n*   The concept class for a fixed model $M$ is $\\mathcal{C}_M = \\{ C_M(\\phi) \\mid \\phi(x) \\in \\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S] \\text{ with free variable } x\\}$.\n*   The VC dimension of the logic fragment is the maximum possible VC dimension of $\\mathcal{C}_M$, taken over all possible models $M$.\n    $VC(\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]) = \\sup_{M} VC(\\mathcal{C}_M)$.\n\n### Step 3: Characterizing the Formulas and Definable Sets\nLet's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in our logic fragment.\nA general formula in this logic can involve existential quantifiers and conjunctions. By standard logical equivalences, we can transform any formula into prenex normal form. Since we only have $\\exists$, the prefixes will consist only of existential quantifiers.\nLet $\\phi(x)$ be such a formula. It is logically equivalent to a formula of the form:\n$\\exists y_1 \\exists y_2 \\dots \\exists y_m \\Psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\Psi$ is quantifier-free.\nSince the only allowed quantifier-free connectives are $\\land, \\top, \\bot$, $\\Psi$ must be a conjunction of atomic formulas. We can separate the atoms involving $x$ from those that do not:\n$\\Psi(x, \\vec{y}) = \\Psi_x(x) \\land \\Psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})$\nSo, $\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists \\vec{y} (\\Psi_x(x) \\land \\Psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y}))$.\nSince $x$ is not a free variable in $\\Psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})$, we can pull $\\Psi_x(x)$ out of the scope of the quantifiers:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\Psi_x(x) \\land (\\exists \\vec{y} \\Psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y}))$\nHere:\n*   $\\Psi_x(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving only the variable $x$, i.e., $\\Psi_x(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n*   $C = \\exists \\vec{y} \\Psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})$ is a *sentence* (a formula with no free variables).\n\nNow, let's look at the set defined by $\\phi(x)$ in a given model $M$:\n*   The sentence $C$ is either true or false in $M$.\n*   If $M \\not\\models C$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\Psi_x(x) \\land \\bot$, which is $\\bot$. The definable set is $\\emptyset$.\n*   If $M \\models C$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\Psi_x(x) \\land \\top$, which is $\\Psi_x(x)$. The definable set is $\\{ a \\in U^M \\mid M \\models \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(a) \\} = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$.\n\nSo, for any model $M$, the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$ is a subset of the class of all possible intersections of the base predicate interpretations $\\{P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M\\}$, plus the empty set.\nLet $k=4$ be the number of predicates. The set of concepts in any model is a subset of:\n$\\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\} \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nWe will establish an upper bound and a lower bound for the VC dimension.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nLet $k=4$. The concept class for any model $M$, $\\mathcal{C}_M$, is formed by taking intersections of $k$ base sets ($P_1^M, \\dots, P_k^M$). The number of distinct concepts that can be formed this way is at most $2^k$ (one for each subset $I \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$). Including the empty set (if it's not already generated) gives at most $2^k+1$ concepts.\nLet $d$ be the VC dimension. This means there exists a set $S$ of size $d$ that can be shattered. To shatter $S$, the concept class must be able to generate all $2^d$ subsets of $S$. The number of subsets generated, $|\\Pi_{\\mathcal{C}_M}(S)|$, is at most the total number of concepts, $|\\mathcal{C}_M|$.\nSo, we must have $2^d \\le |\\mathcal{C}_M| \\le 2^k + 1$.\nFor $k=4$, this gives $2^d \\le 2^4 + 1 = 17$. This implies $d \\le 4$.\nTherefore, the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we need to find a specific model $M$ and a set of 4 points $S$ that can be shattered by the corresponding concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$.\nLet $k=4$. Let's construct a model:\n*   Let the universe be $S = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\n*   For each predicate $P_i$ ($i=1,2,3,4$), define its interpretation as $P_i^M = S \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$.\n\nNow we show that any subset $A \\subseteq S$ can be generated by a concept in $\\mathcal{C}_M$. A concept is an intersection of some of the base sets $P_i^M$.\nLet $A$ be an arbitrary subset of $S$.\nConsider the set of indices $I_A = \\{ i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\mid x_i \\notin A \\}$.\nLet's form the concept $C_A = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_A} P_i^M$.\nBy our definition of the model:\n$C_A = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_A} (S \\setminus \\{x_i\\}) = S \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I_A} \\{x_i\\}$\nThe union $\\bigcup_{i \\in I_A} \\{x_i\\}$ is the set of all elements that are *not* in $A$. This is exactly the set complement of $A$ in $S$, i.e., $S \\setminus A$.\nSo, $C_A = S \\setminus (S \\setminus A) = A$.\nThis shows that for any subset $A \\subseteq S$, we can find a formula (defining the concept $C_A$) that picks out exactly $A$.\nThus, the set $S$ of size 4 is shattered. This implies that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nWe have shown:\n1.  VCdim $\\le 4$\n2.  VCdim $\\ge 4$\n\nCombining these two results, the VC dimension of the logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is exactly 4."
