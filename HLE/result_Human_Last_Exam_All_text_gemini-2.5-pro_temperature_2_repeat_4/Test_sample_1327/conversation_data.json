    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sequence to find the missing number.\n\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the relationship between consecutive terms.**\nLet's try to find a pattern by looking at simple arithmetic or geometric operations.\n- **Arithmetic Difference:**\n  - 11 - 2 = 9\n  - 23 - 11 = 12\n  - 51 - 23 = 28\n  - 119 - 51 = 68\n  The first differences are {9, 12, 28, 68}. There is no obvious simple pattern here.\n\n- **Geometric Ratio:**\n  - 11 / 2 = 5.5\n  - 23 / 11 ≈ 2.09\n  - 51 / 23 ≈ 2.21\n  - 119 / 51 ≈ 2.33\n  There is no simple geometric pattern.\n\n**Step 2: Explore a mixed pattern.**\nA very common pattern in number sequence puzzles is `a_{n+1} = k * a_n + C_n`, where `k` is a constant and `C_n` is a sequence. Let's test this with `k=2`, as the numbers are roughly doubling.\nLet the original sequence be `a_n`.\n- `a_1` = 2\n- `a_2` = 11. `2 * a_1 = 2 * 2 = 4`. The difference is `11 - 4 = 7`. So, `a_2 = 2 * a_1 + 7`.\n- `a_3` = 23. `2 * a_2 = 2 * 11 = 22`. The difference is `23 - 22 = 1`. So, `a_3 = 2 * a_2 + 1`.\n- `a_4` = 51. `2 * a_3 = 2 * 23 = 46`. The difference is `51 - 46 = 5`. So, `a_4 = 2 * a_3 + 5`.\n- `a_5` = 119. `2 * a_4 = 2 * 51 = 102`. The difference is `119 - 102 = 17`. So, `a_5 = 2 * a_4 + 17`.\n\nThe rule is `a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + c_n`, where `c_n` is the additive sequence {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the additive sequence `c_n`.**\nThe sequence `c_n` is {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}. We need to find the next term to calculate the missing number in the original sequence. Let's find the differences within this new sequence.\n- **First Differences of `c_n` (let's call it `d_n`):**\n  - 1 - 7 = -6\n  - 5 - 1 = 4\n  - 17 - 5 = 12\n  The sequence `d_n` is {-6, 4, 12, ...}. Still no simple pattern.\n\n- **Second Differences of `c_n` (let's call it `e_n`):**\n  This is the difference of the `d_n` sequence.\n  - 4 - (-6) = 10\n  - 12 - 4 = 8\n  The sequence `e_n` is {10, 8, ...}.\n\n**Step 4: Find the pattern in the second difference sequence `e_n`.**\nThe sequence `e_n` = {10, 8, ...} has a clear pattern. Let's examine a few possibilities.\n- An arithmetic progression: The next term would be 6 (common difference of -2).\n- A Fibonacci-like progression: The next term is the sum of the previous two terms. Let's check this. `e_3 = e_1 + e_2 = 10 + 8 = 18`. This is a plausible pattern for this kind of puzzle.\n\nLet's assume the Fibonacci-like pattern is correct and work our way back up to find the missing term.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the next terms of the sequences.**\n1.  **Find the next term of `e_n`:**\n    `e_3 = 10 + 8 = 18`.\n\n2.  **Find the next term of `d_n`:**\n    The next term `d_4` is the previous term `d_3` plus `e_3`.\n    `d_4 = 12 + 18 = 30`.\n\n3.  **Find the next term of `c_n`:**\n    The next term `c_5` is the previous term `c_4` plus `d_4`.\n    `c_5 = 17 + 30 = 47`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the missing term in the original sequence.**\nThe rule is `a_6 = 2 * a_5 + c_5`.\n- `a_5` = 119\n- `c_5` = 47\n- `a_6 = 2 * 119 + 47`\n- `a_6 = 238 + 47`\n- `a_6 = 285`\n\nThe missing number in the parentheses is 285. This matches option B.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n- **Original Sequence (a_n):** 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ?\n- **Recurrence Relation:** `a_{n+1} = 2 * a_n + c_n`\n- **Additive Sequence (c_n):** 7, 1, 5, 17, 47\n- **First Differences of c_n (d_n):** -6, 4, 12, 30\n- **Second Differences of c_n (e_n):** 10, 8, 18 (This sequence follows a Fibonacci-like pattern: 10 + 8 = 18)\n\nFinal calculation: 2 * 119 + 47 = 238 + 47 = 285.\n\n<<<B>>>"
