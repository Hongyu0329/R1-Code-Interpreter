    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Jacek Dukaj.\n\n2.  **Identify the Main Character:** The first step is to correctly identify the protagonist of the novel. The main character is Adam Zamoyski, a human from the 21st century who has been resurrected in a far-future, post-human reality.\n\n3.  **Identify the Action:** The question asks about the character whom Adam Zamoyski \"marries\".\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Marriage\" in Context:** This is a crucial point. In the highly advanced, post-human setting of the novel, traditional human concepts like marriage do not exist in the same way. The \"marriage\" in question is not a conventional ceremony but a deep, permanent, and formalized bond between beings.\n\n5.  **Identify the Relevant Character:** Throughout the novel, Adam Zamoyski's primary companion, guide, and protector is a powerful post-human entity (a \"stahs\" - Standard Angel). Her name is Angelina.\n\n6.  **Trace the Relationship Arc:** The relationship between Adam and Angelina evolves significantly. Initially, she is his guardian, but they develop a profound emotional connection. This culminates in Adam proposing a permanent union with her, which she accepts. From Adam's 21st-century perspective, and for the narrative's purpose, this permanent bonding is equivalent to marriage.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Based on the events of the novel, the character that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms a marriage-like, permanent union with is Angelina.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Protagonist's Name:** Ensure the main character is correctly identified as Adam Zamoyski.\n*   **Context of \"Marriage\":** It's important to understand that the term \"marries\" is used as an analogy for the unique type of bond formed in the novel's setting. It is not a traditional human marriage.\n*   **Character's Name:** The name of the character he unites with is Angelina.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe main character of Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\", Adam Zamoyski, marries a post-human entity named Angelina. Their union is a permanent bond that functions as a marriage within the context of the story.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
