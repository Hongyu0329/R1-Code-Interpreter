    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Attacks\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid, where coordinates can be represented as `(r, c)` with `r, c` in `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   **Toroidal:** The board wraps around. This means all arithmetic on row and column indices is performed modulo 5. For example, the square to the right of `(r, 4)` is `(r, 0)`, and the square below `(4, c)` is `(0, c)`.\n*   **Queen Attacks:** A queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks a square `(r2, c2)` if they are in the same:\n    1.  **Row:** `r1 = r2`.\n    2.  **Column:** `c1 = c2`.\n    3.  **Main Diagonal:** The condition for a standard board is `r1 - c1 = r2 - c2`. On a toroidal board, this becomes `r1 - c1 ≡ r2 - c2 (mod 5)`. There are 5 such diagonals.\n    4.  **Anti-Diagonal:** The condition for a standard board is `r1 + c1 = r2 + c2`. On a toroidal board, this becomes `r1 + c1 ≡ r2 + c2 (mod 5)`. There are 5 such diagonals.\n\n*   **Non-Attacking Condition:** For a set of queens to be non-attacking, any two queens `(ri, ci)` and `(rj, cj)` must have `ri ≠ rj`, `ci ≠ cj`, `ri - ci ≢ rj - cj (mod 5)`, and `ri + ci ≢ rj + cj (mod 5)`.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the `k=4` problem to the `k=5` problem\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens. Let's call this number `N_4`. This is an example of an `(n-1)`-queens problem on an `n x n` board, where `n=5`. It is often easier to analyze the full `n`-queens problem and relate it back. Let `N_5` be the number of ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on the 5x5 toroidal board.\n\n### Step 3: From a 5-queen solution to a 4-queen solution\n\nConsider a valid placement of 5 non-attacking queens (a 5-configuration). If we remove any one of the 5 queens, the remaining 4 queens will still be non-attacking. This is because removing a piece cannot create a new attack. Since there are 5 queens to choose from, every 5-configuration can generate 5 different 4-configurations.\n\nThis gives us a mapping: from the set of all 5-configurations, we can generate `5 * N_5` potential 4-configurations. Now we must determine if this covers all possible 4-configurations and if any duplicates are generated.\n\n### Step 4: From a 4-queen solution to a 5-queen solution (Completeness)\n\nThis is the most critical step. Let's analyze an arbitrary 4-configuration `Q_4`.\nA 4-configuration consists of 4 queens at positions `{(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)}`.\n*   **Rows:** The 4 queens must be in 4 different rows. There is exactly one row, `r_u`, that is unoccupied.\n*   **Columns:** The 4 queens must be in 4 different columns. There is exactly one column, `c_u`, that is unoccupied.\n*   **Main Diagonals:** The 4 queens must occupy 4 different main diagonals (defined by `r - c mod 5`). There is one unused main diagonal value, `d₁_u`.\n*   **Anti-Diagonals:** The 4 queens must occupy 4 different anti-diagonals (defined by `r + c mod 5`). There is one unused anti-diagonal value, `d₂_u`.\n\nIf we want to add a 5th queen `(r, c)` to this 4-configuration to form a 5-configuration, it must not attack any of the existing queens. This means it must be placed in the unused row, column, and diagonals.\n*   The position must be `(r, c) = (r_u, c_u)`.\n*   The diagonals of this position must be the unused ones:\n    *   `r_u - c_u ≡ d₁_u (mod 5)`\n    *   `r_u + c_u ≡ d₂_u (mod 5)`\n\nA key mathematical property of this board (specifically, for any `n x n` board where `n` is odd) guarantees that these conditions are always met. The sum of all indices from 0 to 4 is `0+1+2+3+4 = 10`, which is `0 (mod 5)`.\nLet the set of all rows be `R = {0,1,2,3,4}`.\nThe unoccupied row is `r_u = (Σ R) - (r1+r2+r3+r4) ≡ 0 - Σ r_i (mod 5)`.\nSimilarly, `c_u ≡ -Σ c_i (mod 5)`.\nAnd `d₁_u ≡ -Σ (r_i - c_i) (mod 5)`, and `d₂_u ≡ -Σ (r_i + c_i) (mod 5)`.\n\nChecking the conditions:\n1.  `r_u - c_u ≡ (-Σ r_i) - (-Σ c_i) = Σ (c_i - r_i) = -Σ (r_i - c_i) ≡ d₁_u (mod 5)`. This is always true.\n2.  `r_u + c_u ≡ (-Σ r_i) + (-Σ c_i) = -Σ (r_i + c_i) ≡ d₂_u (mod 5)`. This is also always true.\n\nThis proves that **any valid 4-configuration can be extended to a valid 5-configuration by adding a queen to the uniquely determined empty row and column.** Furthermore, this extension is unique.\n\n### Step 5: Establishing a Bijection\n\nThe conclusion from Steps 3 and 4 is that there exists a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between:\n1.  The set of all valid 4-configurations.\n2.  The set of all pairs `(S, q)`, where `S` is a valid 5-configuration and `q` is one of the 5 queens in `S`.\n\nThe mapping from set 2 to set 1 is simply removing queen `q` from `S`. The mapping from set 1 to set 2 is finding the unique completion of a 4-configuration. Because this is a bijection, the number of elements in both sets must be equal.\n\nNumber of 4-configurations = Number of pairs `(S, q)`\n`N_4 = N_5 * 5`\n\n### Step 6: Finding the number of 5-queen solutions (`N_5`)\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding `N_5`, the number of ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. This is a known result in recreational mathematics and combinatorial theory. The number is:\n`N_5 = 300`\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\n\nUsing the formula from Step 5, we can calculate `N_4`:\n`N_4 = 5 * N_5 = 5 * 300 = 1500`\n\nTherefore, there are 1500 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<1500>>>"
