    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, along with the careful points to consider.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the explicit mathematical form of the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` as it appears in the functional integral for the partition function of a neutral scalar field at finite temperature. This involves:\n1.  Understanding the framework of finite-temperature field theory (the imaginary time formalism).\n2.  Defining the Euclidean action `S_E` for a free scalar field.\n3.  Identifying the operator `D` by writing the action as a quadratic form.\n4.  Defining the inner product `(f, g)` in this context.\n5.  Combining these elements to write down the final expression for `(ϕ, Dϕ)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Framework:** The setting is finite-temperature quantum field theory. This means we use the imaginary time formalism, where time `t` is Wick-rotated to Euclidean time `τ = it`. The domain of `τ` is compact, `τ ∈ [0, β)`, where `β = 1/T` and `T` is the temperature.\n2.  **Field and Boundary Conditions:** The field `ϕ` is a neutral (real) scalar field. As a boson, it must satisfy periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction: `ϕ(τ, **x**) = ϕ(τ + β, **x**)`. These boundary conditions are crucial, as they ensure that boundary terms vanish during integration by parts.\n3.  **The Partition Function:** The thermal partition function `Z` is given by a functional integral over all field configurations `ϕ` that satisfy the boundary conditions: `Z = ∫ D[ϕ] exp(-S_E[ϕ])`, where `S_E` is the Euclidean action.\n4.  **Inner Product Notation:** The notation `(f, g)` represents the `L²` inner product of the functions `f` and `g` over their domain, which is Euclidean spacetime. It is defined as `(f, g) = ∫ dτ d³x f(τ, **x**)g(τ, **x**)`.\n5.  **Identifying the Operator `D`:** The operator `D` arises when we consider the Gaussian (free) part of the action. The action `S_E` for a free field is a quadratic functional of `ϕ`. It is conventionally written as `S_E = (1/2)(ϕ, Dϕ)`, which defines the operator `D`.\n6.  **Relation to the Action:** A key result of the analysis will be the direct relationship between the inner product `(ϕ, Dϕ)` and the Euclidean action `S_E`.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Euclidean Action `S_E`**\n\nFor a free, massive, neutral scalar field, the Euclidean action `S_E` is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density `L_E` over the Euclidean spacetime (`(d+1)` dimensions, usually `3+1`):\n`S_E[ϕ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x L_E`\nwhere\n`L_E = (1/2)(∂_τ ϕ)² + (1/2)(∇ϕ)² + (1/2)m²ϕ²`\nThe term `(∂_μϕ)²` here means `(∂_τϕ)² + (∇ϕ)²`. So we can write:\n`S_E[ϕ] = (1/2) ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ (∂_τϕ)² + (∇ϕ)² + m²ϕ² ]`\n\n**Step 2: Rewriting the Action via Integration by Parts**\n\nTo identify the operator `D`, we rewrite the action `S_E` by performing integration by parts on the kinetic (derivative) terms. We want to isolate a `ϕ(...)ϕ` structure inside the integral.\n\n*   Consider the time derivative term: `∫₀^β dτ (∂_τ ϕ)²`. Integrating by parts gives `[ϕ(∂_τ ϕ)]_0^β - ∫₀^β dτ ϕ(∂_τ² ϕ)`. The boundary term `ϕ(β)∂_τϕ(β) - ϕ(0)∂_τϕ(0)` is zero because the periodic boundary conditions imply `ϕ(β) = ϕ(0)` and `∂_τϕ(β) = ∂_τϕ(0)`.\n*   Consider the spatial derivative term: `∫ d³x (∇ϕ)²`. Using Green's first identity (the multidimensional equivalent of integration by parts), this becomes `∫_∂V ϕ(∇ϕ)·dS - ∫ d³x ϕ(∇²ϕ)`. The surface integral at spatial infinity is assumed to be zero for field configurations with finite action.\n\nApplying these results to the action `S_E`:\n`S_E[ϕ] = (1/2) ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ ϕ(-∂_τ² ϕ) + ϕ(-∇² ϕ) + m²ϕ² ]`\n\nCombining the terms, we get:\n`S_E[ϕ] = (1/2) ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ϕ(τ, **x**) [ -∂_τ² - ∇² + m² ] ϕ(τ, **x**) `\n\n**Step 3: Defining the Inner Product and Identifying `(ϕ, Dϕ)`**\n\nThe standard `L²` inner product in this function space is:\n`(f, g) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x f(τ, **x**) g(τ, **x**)`\n\nThe action from Step 2 is in the form `S_E[ϕ] = (1/2)(ϕ, Dϕ)`. By comparing this with our derived expression for `S_E`, we can directly identify the action of the operator `D` on `ϕ`, which we call `Dϕ`:\n`Dϕ = [ -∂_τ² - ∇² + m² ] ϕ(τ, **x**)`\nThe operator `D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.\n\nThe inner product `(ϕ, Dϕ)` is therefore given by substituting `f = ϕ` and `g = Dϕ` into the inner product definition:\n`(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ϕ(τ, **x**) [ (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**) ]`\n\n**Step 4: Final Expression and Relation to Action**\n\nFrom the derivation in Step 2, we know that after integrating by parts, this expression is equivalent to the original form of the action (without the factor of `1/2`):\n`(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ (∂_τϕ)² + (∇ϕ)² + m²ϕ² ]`\n\nBoth of these forms are valid representations of the inner product. We can also see the direct relationship to the free Euclidean action:\n`(ϕ, Dϕ) = 2 S_E[ϕ]`\n\nThe most explicit answer gives the form of the integral.\n\nThe inner product of `(ϕ, Dϕ)` is the full quadratic term that appears in the argument of the exponential in the partition function's path integral representation, which after integration by parts defines the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator `D`.\n\n<<<The inner product `(ϕ, Dϕ)` is given by the integral over Euclidean spacetime:\n`(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ϕ(τ, **x**) [ -∂_τ² - ∇² + m² ] ϕ(τ, **x**)`\nwhere `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature, `m` is the mass of the scalar field, `∂_τ` is the derivative with respect to imaginary time, and `∇` is the spatial gradient. By performing an integration by parts, this is equivalent to:\n`(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ (∂_τϕ)² + (∇ϕ)² + m²ϕ² ]`\nwhich is equal to twice the free Euclidean action, `2S_E`.>>>"
