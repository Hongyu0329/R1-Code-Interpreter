    "Answering this question requires understanding the fundamental properties of unitary quantum gate operations on a single qubit.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of Unitary Operations\n\nA quantum gate acting on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. Unitary matrices have several key properties, but the most critical ones for this problem are:\n\n1.  **Linearity:** For any states `|ψ₁⟩`, `|ψ₂⟩` and complex numbers `α`, `β`, a unitary operation `U` satisfies `U(α|ψ₁⟩ + β|ψ₂⟩) = α(U|ψ₁⟩) + β(U|ψ₂⟩)`.\n2.  **Invertibility (Reversibility):** Every unitary operation `U` has an inverse `U⁻¹`, which is its conjugate transpose `U†`. This means that if `U|ψ⟩ = |φ⟩`, then `|ψ⟩ = U†|φ⟩`. A direct consequence of this is that a unitary operation must be a one-to-one mapping. It cannot map two different input states to the same output state. If it did, the reverse operation would not know which input state to return to, violating the principle of reversibility.\n3.  **Preservation of Inner Product:** Unitary operations preserve the inner product between states. This means `⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩ = ⟨Uψ₁|Uψ₂⟩`. Geometrically, on the Bloch sphere, this means unitary operations are rotations. They preserve the angles and distances between states. This also means if two states are orthogonal, their transformations must also be orthogonal.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Strategy to Test the Options\n\nThe most straightforward property to check is invertibility. A unitary operation must be an invertible (or bijective) function. This means that for any two distinct input states `|ψ₁⟩ ≠ |ψ₂⟩`, their outputs must also be distinct: `U|ψ₁⟩ ≠ U|ψ₂⟩`.\n\nIf we look at the given transformations as a function mapping the set of six basis states `{∣0⟩, ∣1⟩, ∣+⟩, ∣-⟩, ∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩}` to another set of states, we can check if this function is one-to-one. That is, we must check if any two distinct basis states from the input list are mapped to the very same output state. If they are, that transformation is not invertible and therefore cannot be implemented by a unitary gate.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Answer Choice using the Invertibility Test\n\nLet's examine the mapping provided in each option and check if any output state appears more than once for different input states.\n\n*   **A:** `{|1⟩, |0⟩, |-⟩, |+⟩, |i⟩, |-i⟩}` - All outputs are unique.\n*   **B:** `{|0⟩, |1⟩, |-⟩, |+⟩, |-i⟩, |i⟩}` - All outputs are unique.\n*   **C:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩, |0⟩, |1⟩, |-i⟩, |i⟩}` - All outputs are unique.\n*   ... (We could check all options this way, but we are looking for the one that is NOT possible, so we seek a failure of this test.)\n\nLet's analyze option **Q**:\n*   `∣0⟩ -> ∣-⟩`\n*   `∣1⟩ -> ∣+⟩`\n*   `∣+⟩ -> ∣-⟩`\n*   `∣-⟩ -> ∣i⟩`\n*   `∣i⟩ -> ∣1⟩`\n*   `∣-i⟩ -> ∣0⟩`\n\nIn this transformation, we see that the input state `∣0⟩` is mapped to `∣-⟩`.\nWe also see that the input state `∣+⟩` is mapped to `∣-⟩`.\n\nWe have two distinct input states, `∣0⟩` and `|+⟩`, being mapped to the exact same output state `∣-⟩`.\nAs explained in Step 2, this violates the invertibility (reversibility) property required for any unitary quantum gate. A unitary transformation must be a one-to-one mapping.\n\nTo prove this mathematically:\nAssume a unitary gate `U` exists for transformation Q. Then we would have:\n1.  `U|0⟩ = |-⟩` (up to a global phase, which we can ignore for this argument)\n2.  `U|+⟩ = |-⟩`\n\nFrom these two equations, we can say `U|0⟩ = U|+⟩`.\nSince `U` is invertible, we can apply its inverse `U†` to both sides:\n`U†U|0⟩ = U†U|+⟩`\n`I|0⟩ = I|+⟩` (where `I` is the identity operator)\n`|0⟩ = |+⟩`\n\nThis is a contradiction, as `|0⟩` and `|+⟩` are known to be different quantum states. Therefore, no such unitary gate `U` can exist.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe transformation described in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate operation because it is not an invertible (one-to-one) mapping. It maps two distinct states, `|0⟩` and `|+⟩`, to a single output state `|-⟩`. A quick check reveals that the other options describe permutations of the basis states, which is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for a valid unitary transformation."
