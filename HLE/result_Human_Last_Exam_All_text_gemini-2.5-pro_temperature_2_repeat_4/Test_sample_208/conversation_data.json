    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the radius of the circle.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nThe problem asks for the radius of a large circle that can \"tightly pack\" fourteen smaller circles, each with a radius of one. This is a classic mathematical problem known as the \"circle packing in a circle\" problem. \"Tightly packed\" implies finding the smallest possible large circle that can contain the fourteen smaller circles without any overlap.\n\n**Step 2: Recognize the Nature of the Solution**\nFor most numbers of circles (N), the optimal packing arrangement is not a simple, symmetrical pattern like concentric layers of a hexagon. The arrangement for N=14 is a known, specific, and somewhat irregular configuration. The solution is not something that can be easily derived from basic geometric principles (like for N=7, which is a perfect hexagon with a center). It is a result found through complex geometrical analysis and computational optimization. Therefore, solving this problem involves referencing the established results for optimal circle packing.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Optimal Arrangement for N=14**\nThe established optimal arrangement for packing 14 circles has been determined by mathematicians.\n*   The small circles have a radius `r = 1`.\n*   We need to find the radius of the large circle, `R`.\n*   The solution is expressed as the ratio `R/r`.\n*   The arrangement for N=14 is not a simple concentric ring structure. It consists of a central cluster of four circles surrounded by a containing ring of ten circles. The entire formation has a two-fold rotational symmetry (C2 symmetry).\n\n**Step 4: Use the Known Result for the Radius Ratio**\nFor N=14, the minimal radius `R` of the enclosing circle is given by a known ratio `R/r`. According to the widely accepted results from the field of packing problems (pioneered by mathematicians like Udo Pirl and later confirmed computationally):\n*   The optimal ratio for N=14 is `R/r ≈ 3.4839818...`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Radius**\nThe problem states that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`. We can use this to calculate the radius `R` of the large circle.\n*   `R = r * (R/r)`\n*   `R = 1 * 3.4839818...`\n*   `R ≈ 3.4839818...`\n\n**Step 6: Round to the Required Number of Significant Digits**\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits.\n*   The calculated value is `3.4839818...`\n*   The first four significant digits are 3, 4, 8, and 3.\n*   The fifth significant digit is 9.\n*   Since the fifth digit (9) is 5 or greater, we must round up the fourth digit.\n*   So, the digit 3 is rounded up to 4.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to 4 significant digits, is 3.484.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  **\"Tightly packed\" implies optimality:** This isn't just any arrangement, but the one that results in the smallest possible containing circle.\n2.  **Non-intuitive geometry:** One should not assume a simple hexagonal or square packing structure. The actual optimal layout for N=14 is complex.\n3.  **Reliance on known results:** This is a knowledge-based problem. The key step is to identify it as a standard circle-packing problem and use the established solution for N=14.\n4.  **Significant figures:** Careful rounding is required as per the question's instructions. The fifth digit determines whether the fourth digit is rounded up or stays the same.\n\n<<<3.484>>>"
