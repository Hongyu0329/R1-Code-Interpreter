    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to create a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\". A spectral volume, also known as a data cube, is a three-dimensional dataset with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). This means for every pixel (x, y) in a scene, we want to know its entire spectrum of light. The constraint of using a \"single image\" means we have to capture all the necessary information in one snapshot on a 2D sensor.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Method**\nThe method specified is \"computed tomography\" (CT). Standard medical CT works by taking many 2D X-ray images (projections) of a 3D object from different angles. An algorithm then reconstructs the 3D internal structure from these projections. The key principle is that multiple views are required to solve for the 3D structure.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Role of Diffraction Gratings**\nIn this optical context, we are not rotating a camera. Instead, we use diffraction gratings to generate the different \"views\" or \"projections\" simultaneously on a single 2D sensor. A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits and diffracts light into several beams traveling in different directions. This splitting is dependent on the wavelength of the light. The undispersed light is the \"0th order,\" while the dispersed light forms the \"1st order,\" \"2nd order,\" etc. Each diffraction order can be thought of as a projection of the spectral volume onto the 2D sensor.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the case of a Single (1D) Diffraction Grating**\nIf we use just one standard diffraction grating, it will disperse light along a single axis (e.g., horizontally). We would see a central, undispersed 0th-order image. We would also see multiple dispersed images (the +/- 1st orders, +/- 2nd orders, etc.) spread out along that single horizontal line.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** In the language of computed tomography, all these projections are taken at the same \"angle\" or along the same axis. Imagine trying to reconstruct a 3D model of a building by only taking pictures from the front (at different zoom levels). You would have no information about the sides or back of the building. Similarly, projections along a single axis are insufficient to fully reconstruct the 3D (x, y, λ) data cube. This is a fundamental limitation known as the \"missing cone\" problem in tomography, where information about spatial variations perpendicular to the dispersion axis is lost or ambiguous. Therefore, a single 1D grating is not sufficient.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the case of Two Diffraction Gratings**\nTo solve the missing information problem, we need projections from a different \"angle\". This can be achieved by adding a second diffraction grating, oriented perpendicularly to the first one (e.g., one dispersing horizontally and one dispersing vertically).\n\n*   This setup generates a 2D grid of diffraction orders on the sensor. For example:\n    *   A 0th-order (undispersed) image at the center.\n    *   Orders dispersed purely horizontally.\n    *   Orders dispersed purely vertically.\n    *   Orders dispersed diagonally (affected by both gratings).\n*   **Careful Point:** This set of projections provides views along multiple, non-collinear axes. This is analogous to taking pictures of the building from the front AND from the side. This additional information allows the tomographic reconstruction algorithm to resolve ambiguities and construct the full 3D data cube. Two gratings provide the *minimum* required information to make the problem solvable.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the Conclusion**\nSince one grating is insufficient and two gratings are sufficient for the reconstruction, the minimum number necessary is two.\n*   **Final Careful Point:** It's worth noting that these two gratings are often combined into a single physical component called a 2D (or crossed) diffraction grating. However, the question asks for the minimum *number of gratings necessary*, referring to the fundamental number of independent dispersion axes required for the tomographic principle to work. That number is two. Using more than two (e.g., gratings at 0, 60, and 120 degrees) can improve the quality of reconstruction but is not the minimum requirement.\n\n<<<B>>>"
