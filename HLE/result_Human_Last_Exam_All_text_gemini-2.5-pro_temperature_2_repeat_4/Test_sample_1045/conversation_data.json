    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecule\n*   The molecule is toluene.\n*   The chemical formula for toluene is C7H8.\n*   This means we have 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set\nThe name \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). We need to break down the meaning for each type of atom.\n\n*   **For second-row atoms (like Carbon):**\n    *   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The \"**6**\" indicates that the core electrons are represented by a single CGF, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). So, we have **1 CGF** for the core.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals (2s, 2p):** The \"**31**\" indicates that the valence orbitals are \"split\" into two sets of basis functions: an inner and an outer set.\n        *   **Inner Valence (\"3\"):** This part is described by one CGF for the 2s orbital and three CGFs for the 2p orbitals (px, py, pz). Each of these CGFs is a combination of 3 PGFs. This gives us 1(s) + 3(p) = **4 CGFs**.\n        *   **Outer Valence (\"1\"):** This part is described by one CGF for the 2s orbital and three CGFs for the 2p orbitals (px, py, pz). Each of these CGFs consists of a single PGF. This gives us 1(s) + 3(p) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   **Core Orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n    *   **Valence Orbitals (1s):** The basis set is split according to \"**31**\".\n        *   **Inner Valence (\"3\"):** Represented by **1 CGF**.\n        *   **Outer Valence (\"1\"):** Represented by **1 CGF**.\n    *   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Contracted Gaussian Functions\nNow we combine the counts for all the atoms in toluene (C7H8).\n\n*   **Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms:**\n    *   7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = **63 CGFs**\n*   **Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = **16 CGFs**\n*   **Total for the molecule:**\n    *   63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = **79 CGFs**\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question asks for the number of *contracted* Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are the basis functions used in the calculation. This is different from the number of *primitive* Gaussian functions (PGFs), which would be a much larger number.\n2.  **p-Orbitals:** Remember that for a second-row element, the \"p\" notation refers to three separate orbitals (px, py, pz), and thus three separate basis functions are needed for each p-shell representation.\n3.  **Atom-Specific Definitions:** The definition of the basis set is different for hydrogen (a first-row element) and carbon (a second-row element). The \"6-\" part describing the core applies only to atoms that have core electrons, like carbon.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
