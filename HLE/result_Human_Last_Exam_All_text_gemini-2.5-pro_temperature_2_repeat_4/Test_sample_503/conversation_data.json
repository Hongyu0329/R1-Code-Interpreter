    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Categorical Structure\n\n1.  **The Simplex Category $\\Delta$:** The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite, non-empty, totally ordered sets $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. A morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ in $\\Delta$ is an order-preserving (or non-decreasing) map, meaning if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n\n2.  **The 2-Categorical Structure:** We are told to view $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$.\n    *   $\\mathsf{Pos}$ is the category of partially ordered sets and order-preserving maps. It can be made into a 2-category by considering the hom-sets $\\mathsf{Pos}(P, Q)$ themselves as posets. For two maps $f, g: P \\to Q$, we say $f \\le g$ if $f(x) \\le g(x)$ for all $x \\in P$. This relation defines the 2-morphisms.\n    *   As a subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, the hom-sets $\\Delta([m], [n])$ inherit this pointwise order. A 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ (where $f,g: [m] \\to [n]$) exists if and only if $f \\le g$.\n\n### Step 2: Defining an Internal Adjunction in $\\Delta$\n\n1.  **General Definition:** An internal adjunction from an object $A$ to an object $B$ in a 2-category is a pair of 1-morphisms $L: A \\to B$ and $R: B \\to A$ together with a unit 2-morphism $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\to R \\circ L$ and a counit 2-morphism $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_B$ that satisfy the triangle identities.\n\n2.  **Application to $\\Delta$:** In our case, we are looking for an adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$, where $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n    *   The 1-morphisms are order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n    *   The unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\to R \\circ L$ translates to the inequality $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\le R \\circ L$. Pointwise, this means $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(k) \\le (R \\circ L)(k)$ for all $k \\in [23]$, which is $k \\le R(L(k))$.\n    *   The counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$ translates to the inequality $L \\circ R \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$. Pointwise, this means $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$, which is $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n    *   In a poset-enriched setting, the triangle identities for adjunctions hold automatically whenever a unit and counit exist.\n\n### Step 3: Characterizing Adjunctions as Galois Connections\n\nThe pair of conditions on the order-preserving maps $L$ and $R$:\n1.  $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [37]$\n2.  $k \\le R(L(k))$ for all $k \\in [23]$\n\nThese conditions are precisely the definition of a **Galois connection** between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$. This definition is equivalent to the single, more symmetric condition:\n$L(k) \\le j \\iff k \\le R(j)$ for all $k \\in [23]$ and $j \\in [37]$.\n\nAn adjunction between two posets is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint $L$ or the right adjoint $R$. Thus, the number of adjunctions is the number of possible left adjoints (or right adjoints).\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Left Adjoints\n\nLet's find the condition for an order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ to be a left adjoint. If $L$ is a left adjoint, it must have a corresponding right adjoint $R$. This right adjoint can be constructed from $L$ by the formula:\n$R(j) = \\max \\{ k \\in [23] \\mid L(k) \\le j \\}$\nFor $R(j)$ to be well-defined for all $j \\in [37]$, the set $\\{ k \\in [23] \\mid L(k) \\le j \\}$ must be non-empty for every $j \\in [37]$.\nLet's consider the most restrictive case for $j$. Since $L$ maps to non-negative integers, the condition is hardest to satisfy for the smallest value, $j=0$. The set $\\{k \\in [23] \\mid L(k) \\le 0\\}$ must be non-empty. This means there must be some $k$ for which $L(k)=0$. As $L$ is order-preserving, if $L(k)=0$ for some $k$, then $L(0)$ must also be 0. Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition is $L(0) = 0$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ that satisfy $L(0)=0$. Such a map is determined by the sequence of values $L(1), L(2), \\dots, L(23)$, which must satisfy:\n$L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\nWith $L(0)=0$, this becomes:\n$0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a combinatorial problem of choosing 23 numbers (the values of $L(i)$ for $i=1,\\dots,23$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which has $38$ elements), with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter (as the non-decreasing condition fixes the order). This is a classic \"stars and bars\" problem.\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from $N$ types with repetition allowed is given by the multiset coefficient $\\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\n*   Number of items to choose, $k=23$.\n*   Number of types to choose from, $N = 37-0+1=38$.\n\nThe total number of such maps is $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n### Step 5: Verification by Counting Right Adjoints\n\nAs a check, we can count the number of right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\nFrom $R$, we can construct its left adjoint $L$ via:\n$L(k) = \\min \\{ j \\in [37] \\mid k \\le R(j) \\}$.\nFor $L(k)$ to be well-defined, the set must be non-empty for all $k \\in [23]$. The most restrictive case is for the largest value, $k=23$. The set $\\{j \\in [37] \\mid 23 \\le R(j) \\}$ must be non-empty. As $R$ is order-preserving, its maximum value is $R(37)$. So, we need $23 \\le R(37)$. Since the codomain of $R$ is $[23]$, this forces $R(37)=23$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ satisfying $R(37)=23$. Such a map is determined by the values $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$, which must satisfy:\n$0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le R(37) = 23$.\n\nThis is equivalent to choosing 37 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$ (which has 24 elements) with replacement, arranged in non-decreasing order.\n*   Number of items to choose, $k = 37$.\n*   Number of types to choose from, $N = 23-0+1=24$.\n\nThe number is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nWe can verify that this is the same number:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$\n$\\binom{60}{37} = \\frac{60!}{37!(60-37)!} = \\frac{60!}{37!23!}$\nThe results match, which confirms our analysis.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial(60, 23)>>>"
