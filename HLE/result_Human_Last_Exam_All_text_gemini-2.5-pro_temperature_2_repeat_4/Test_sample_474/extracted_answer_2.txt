The approach is not valid. The ecological function of a mimicry syndrome depends on the perception of natural predators (primarily birds), not humans. Birds have tetrachromatic vision and can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Two bee species that appear identical to a human may have different UV patterns, making them easily distinguishable to a bird. Therefore, using human similarity rankings ignores a critical component of the visual signal and cannot be considered a valid proxy for defining ecologically functional mimicry rings.
