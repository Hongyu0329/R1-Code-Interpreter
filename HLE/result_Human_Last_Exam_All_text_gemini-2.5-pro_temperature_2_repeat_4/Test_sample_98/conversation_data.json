    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Setup**\n*   **The Object:** The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   **The Orientation:** The tank is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of the 20 triangular faces is horizontal and forms the base of the tank.\n*   **The Filling Level:** The tank is \"half-filled with water\". This means the volume of the water is exactly half of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Concept of Symmetry**\n*   A key property of a regular icosahedron (like all Platonic solids) is that it possesses **central symmetry** (or point symmetry). This means that for any point on the surface or in the interior of the icosahedron, there is an antipodal point exactly opposite it, such that the line connecting these two points passes through the geometric center of the solid.\n*   Because of this symmetry, any plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron will divide its volume into two perfectly equal halves.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Water Level**\n*   Since the tank is half-filled by volume, the water must fill up exactly to the halfway mark in terms of volume.\n*   Combining this with the principle of central symmetry, the surface of the water must be a horizontal plane that passes precisely through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Shape of the Water Surface**\n*   The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created when the icosahedron is sliced by this central, horizontal plane.\n*   We know the orientation: the icosahedron is standing on a face. Due to central symmetry, there is another identical triangular face parallel to the base at the very top of the tank.\n*   The water surface is therefore the shape of the cross-section created by a plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron and is parallel to a pair of its opposite faces.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Geometric Shape of the Cross-Section**\n*   It is a well-known property of the geometry of the icosahedron that a cross-section taken through its center and parallel to one of its faces is a **regular hexagon**.\n*   **Visualizing this:** When the icosahedron rests on a face, there is a \"belt\" of 6 edges that zig-zag around its equator (midway between the top and bottom faces). The central cutting plane intersects each of these 6 edges at their midpoint. These 6 intersection points form the vertices of a regular hexagon.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Half-Volume vs. Half-Height:** \"Half-filled\" refers to volume, not height. The center of volume is at the geometric center. If it were filled to half its height, the volume would be much less than half the total volume.\n2.  **Central Symmetry is Key:** The central symmetry of the icosahedron is the critical property that allows us to determine the water level without complex calculations.\n3.  **Orientation Matters:** The shape of a cross-section depends on the orientation of the cutting plane. A plane parallel to a face gives a hexagon. A plane cutting through opposite vertices would give a decagon (10-sided polygon).\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the water surface, which is the central cross-section parallel to the base face, will be a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<a regular hexagon>>>"
