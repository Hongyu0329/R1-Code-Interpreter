    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most helpful synthesis technique.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:**\n    *   **Size:** The molecule is a 100-amino acid (100aa) peptide. This is a significant length.\n    *   **Composition:** It contains standard amino acids and one specific unnatural amino acid (UAA), azido phenylalanine (AzF), denoted as 'X'.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Standard Synthesis Techniques and Their Limitations:**\n    *   **Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** This is the workhorse method for creating peptides chemically.\n        *   **Careful Point:** SPPS proceeds by adding one amino acid at a time to a growing chain attached to a solid support. Each addition (coupling) step has an efficiency slightly less than 100% (e.g., 99.5%). For a short peptide (e.g., 20aa), the cumulative yield is acceptable. However, for a 100aa peptide, the cumulative losses become immense. The final yield of the correct full-length product would be extremely low (0.995^99 â‰ˆ 61%), and the crude product would be a very complex mixture of shorter, \"failed\" sequences, making purification nearly impossible.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Direct SPPS is not a practical or helpful method for a peptide of this length.\n\n    *   **Standard Recombinant Protein Expression (e.g., in *E. coli*):** This biological method uses the cellular machinery to produce proteins from a DNA template.\n        *   **Careful Point:** The cell's translational machinery is limited to the 20 canonical amino acids encoded by the standard genetic code. It has no mechanism to incorporate AzF into the growing peptide chain.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Standard recombinant expression cannot be used to produce this specific peptide containing a UAA.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Advanced Techniques Suitable for the Task:**\n\n    *   **Genetic Code Expansion:** This is an advanced biological technique. It involves engineering a host organism (*E. coli*, yeast, etc.) with a new, \"orthogonal\" pair of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and its corresponding tRNA. The engineered synthetase specifically recognizes the UAA (AzF) and attaches it to the engineered tRNA. This tRNA is designed to recognize a non-standard codon (usually the amber stop codon, UAG) that has been placed in the gene sequence at the desired position 'X'.\n        *   **Careful Point:** While very powerful, this method requires significant molecular biology expertise to set up the system. Furthermore, the efficiency of UAA incorporation is often less than 100%, leading to a mixture of the desired protein and a truncated version where translation stopped at the UAG codon.\n        *   **Suitability:** This is a viable but complex option.\n\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This is a powerful *chemo-selective* chemical technique designed specifically to overcome the size limitations of SPPS.\n        *   **How it Works:**\n            1.  The target 100aa peptide sequence is strategically divided into two (or more) smaller fragments. For a 100aa peptide, a split into two ~50aa fragments is ideal.\n            2.  Each smaller fragment is synthesized independently using SPPS. This is highly efficient and feasible since the fragments are of manageable length. The UAA (AzF) is incorporated into its fragment during this SPPS step just like any other amino acid.\n            3.  One fragment is prepared with a C-terminal thioester, and the next fragment is prepared with an N-terminal Cysteine.\n            4.  These two purified fragments are then mixed in solution, where they selectively react (ligate) at the junction to form a native peptide bond, yielding the final, full-length 100aa peptide.\n        *   **Careful Point:** NCL combines the best of both worlds. It uses the power and flexibility of SPPS to easily incorporate unnatural amino acids, but overcomes the length limitation by breaking the problem into smaller parts. It provides absolute control over the sequence and guarantees 100% incorporation of the UAA at the specified position.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This technique is perfectly suited for synthesizing a peptide of this size containing a specific modification like a UAA. It is the gold-standard chemical method for this class of molecules.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** is the most helpful and robust technique for this specific challenge. It directly addresses both key difficulties: the large size (100aa) and the site-specific incorporation of an unnatural amino acid (AzF).\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
