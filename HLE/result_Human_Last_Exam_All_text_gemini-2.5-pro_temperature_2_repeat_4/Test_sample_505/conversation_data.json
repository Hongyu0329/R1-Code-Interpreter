    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Basics of Surface Code Encoding\n\nA surface code encodes logical qubits by defining logical operators on a 2D lattice of physical qubits. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topology of this 2D surface. Key topological features are:\n\n*   **Patches:** These are separate, disconnected 2D lattices. The total number of logical qubits in a system of multiple patches is the sum of the logical qubits in each individual patch.\n*   **Boundaries:** The edges of a finite patch of surface code. A standard rectangular patch has four boundaries (e.g., top, bottom, left, right). Logical operators can be defined as strings of Pauli operators connecting these boundaries. A single standard patch with no holes can encode one logical qubit.\n*   **Holes:** These are regions within the patch where stabilizer measurements are turned off. A hole effectively creates a new, internal boundary on the surface. These new boundaries can be used to define additional logical operators.\n\n### Step 2: Deriving the Formula for Qubits in a Single Patch\n\nLet's determine how many logical qubits `k` can be encoded in a single standard patch with `h` holes.\n\n1.  **Baseline (No Holes, h=0):** A standard rectangular surface code patch has distinct \"smooth\" and \"rough\" boundaries. A logical X operator can be a string of Pauli-X operators connecting the two rough boundaries, and a logical Z operator can be a string of Pauli-Z operators connecting the two smooth boundaries. These two operators anti-commute, forming one logical qubit. So, for `h=0`, we have `k=1`.\n\n2.  **Adding Holes (h > 0):** Each hole introduces a new boundary. A new logical qubit can be associated with each hole. For a given hole, one can define a logical Z operator as a loop of Pauli-Z's encircling that hole, and a logical X operator as a string of Pauli-X's connecting the hole's boundary to the patch's outer boundary.\n    It can be rigorously shown that for each hole added to a standard planar patch, we gain the capacity to encode one additional, independent logical qubit.\n\n3.  **The Formula:** Combining the baseline qubit from the outer boundary and the additional qubits from the holes, the number of logical qubits `k` in a single planar patch with `h` holes is:\n    `k = 1 + h`\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Specific Configuration\n\nThe question specifies:\n*   Two patches of surface code (let's call them Patch 1 and Patch 2).\n*   A total of two holes to be distributed between these patches.\n\nLet `h_1` be the number of holes in Patch 1 and `h_2` be the number of holes in Patch 2.\nWe are given: `h_1 + h_2 = 2` (where `h_1` and `h_2` are non-negative integers).\n\nThe number of logical qubits in each patch is given by our formula `k = 1 + h`:\n*   Qubits in Patch 1: `k_1 = 1 + h_1`\n*   Qubits in Patch 2: `k_2 = 1 + h_2`\n\nThe total number of logical qubits `k_total` is the sum of the qubits from each patch:\n`k_total = k_1 + k_2 = (1 + h_1) + (1 + h_2) = 2 + h_1 + h_2`\n\nSince we know `h_1 + h_2 = 2`, we can substitute this into the equation:\n`k_total = 2 + (2) = 4`\n\n### Step 4: Verifying with All Possible Distributions\n\nLet's check the possible ways to distribute the two holes and confirm the total is always the same.\n\n*   **Case A: One patch has two holes, the other has zero.**\n    *   `h_1 = 2`, `h_2 = 0`\n    *   Qubits in Patch 1: `k_1 = 1 + 2 = 3`\n    *   Qubits in Patch 2: `k_2 = 1 + 0 = 1`\n    *   Total Qubits: `k_total = 3 + 1 = 4`\n\n*   **Case B: Each patch has one hole.**\n    *   `h_1 = 1`, `h_2 = 1`\n    *   Qubits in Patch 1: `k_1 = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Qubits in Patch 2: `k_2 = 1 + 1 = 2`\n    *   Total Qubits: `k_total = 2 + 2 = 4`\n\nIn both possible configurations, the total number of logical qubits is 4. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits is 4.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$.\n<<<4>>>"
