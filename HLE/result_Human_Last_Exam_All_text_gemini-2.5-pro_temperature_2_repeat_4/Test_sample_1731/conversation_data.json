    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for a gas of photons (light quanta), which are bosons. We will use the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the ideas behind the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems, to find these values.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Connecting Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics**\n\nLarge deviation theory quantifies the probability of rare events. In statistical mechanics, the equilibrium state is the overwhelmingly most probable macroscopic state of a system. Fluctuations away from this equilibrium state are rare events.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem deals with the probability that the *empirical distribution* of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables deviates from the true underlying probability distribution. The probability of observing an empirical distribution `Q` when the true distribution is `P` is approximately $e^{-N \\cdot D_{KL}(Q||P)}$, where `N` is the number of samples and $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The most probable empirical distribution is the one that minimizes the rate function $D_{KL}(Q||P)$, which occurs when `Q=P`. In a physical context, this is analogous to the **Principle of Maximum Entropy**. The equilibrium macrostate (defined by quantities like occupation numbers of energy levels) is the one with the largest number of corresponding microstates (`W`). The entropy, given by the Boltzmann formula $S = k_B \\ln W$, is maximized at equilibrium. Any other macrostate has a probability proportional to $e^{(S' - S_{max})/k_B}$, which shows an exponential decay for states with lower entropy, in direct correspondence with the Sanov theorem's form.\n\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem deals with the probability that the *sample mean* of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables deviates from the true mean. The probability that the sample mean is `x` when the true mean is $\\mu$ is approximately $e^{-N \\cdot I(x)}$, where `I(x)` is the rate function. The rate function `I(x)` is zero only at $x = \\mu$ and is positive otherwise. This means the most probable value for the sample mean is the true mean. For our physical system, the equilibrium mean energy is the expectation value of the energy calculated with respect to the most probable (equilibrium) distribution.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to:\n1.  Finding the most probable distribution of photons over the available energy levels by maximizing the entropy.\n2.  Using this distribution to calculate the mean energy and the value of the entropy itself at equilibrium.\n\n**2. Finding the Equilibrium Distribution (Bose-Einstein Statistics)**\n\nWe need to find the set of occupation numbers $\\{n_i\\}$ for energy levels $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}$ that maximizes the entropy.\n\n*   **System**: A gas of photons (bosons). The total number of photons is not conserved ($\\sum n_i \\neq N$), but the total average energy is constrained by the temperature of the reservoir, $\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum n_i \\epsilon_i$.\n*   **Entropy**: The number of ways to distribute $n_i$ identical bosons among $g_i$ degenerate states at energy level $\\epsilon_i$ is $W_i = \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!}$. The total number of microstates for a macrostate $\\{n_i\\}$ is $W = \\prod_i W_i$. The entropy is $S = k_B \\ln W$.\n*   **Maximization**: Using Stirling's approximation and the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize $S$ subject to the constraint $\\sum n_i \\epsilon_i = \\langle E \\rangle$ (with $\\beta=1/(k_BT)$ as the multiplier for the energy constraint and no multiplier for particle number), we arrive at the equilibrium distribution for the mean occupation number per state, $\\bar{n}_i = n_i/g_i$:\n\n    $$ \\bar{n}_i = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_i} - 1} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\epsilon_i / (k_B T)} - 1} $$\n\nThis is the celebrated **Bose-Einstein distribution** for particles with zero chemical potential, like photons.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Nature of Photons**: They are indistinguishable bosons, and their total number is not conserved. This is why the chemical potential is zero, and we do not apply a constraint on the total number of particles during the entropy maximization.\n2.  **Degeneracy**: The term $g_i$ represents the number of states with the same energy $\\epsilon_i$. It must be included in the calculations for total energy and entropy.\n3.  **Equilibrium**: The equilibrium state is not a single microstate but the macrostate corresponding to the largest number of microstates. The derived values are averages over all microstates in the canonical ensemble.\n4.  **Connection to LDT**: The procedure of maximizing Boltzmann entropy is the physical application of the large deviation principle. The resulting Bose-Einstein distribution is the \"most probable\" distribution that minimizes the rate function. The resulting mean energy is the value for which the Chernoff rate function is zero.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nNow we use the derived equilibrium distribution $\\bar{n}_i$ to compute the equilibrium mean energy and entropy.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy, $\\langle E \\rangle$**\n\nThe total mean energy is the sum of the energy of each level multiplied by the average number of photons occupying that level.\n\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i (n_i \\epsilon_i) = \\sum_i (\\bar{n}_i g_i \\epsilon_i)$\n\nSubstituting the Bose-Einstein distribution for $\\bar{n}_i$:\n\n$$ \\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\epsilon_i}{e^{\\epsilon_i / (k_B T)} - 1} $$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy, S**\n\nThe entropy is calculated using the formula $S=k_B \\ln W$ with the equilibrium occupation numbers $n_i = g_i \\bar{n}_i$. A standard calculation for the entropy of a Bose gas yields:\n\n$S = k_B \\sum_i g_i \\left[ (\\bar{n}_i + 1)\\ln(\\bar{n}_i + 1) - \\bar{n}_i \\ln \\bar{n}_i \\right]$\n\nwhere $\\bar{n}_i$ is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution as above. This can also be written in a form that explicitly shows its relation to energy and free energy:\n\n$S = k_B \\sum_i g_i \\left[ \\frac{\\epsilon_i / (k_B T)}{e^{\\epsilon_i / (k_B T)} - 1} - \\ln\\left(1 - e^{-\\epsilon_i / (k_B T)}\\right) \\right]$\n\nBoth expressions are equivalent.\n\nThese two formulas give the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy for a gas of light quanta.\n\n***\n\n<<<\nThe equilibrium values for a system of light quanta (photons) following Bose-Einstein statistics are derived by maximizing the system's entropy subject to a constant average energy. This procedure is the physical manifestation of the large deviation principles mentioned in the question. The resulting equilibrium mean occupation number for a state with energy $\\epsilon_i$ is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution $\\bar{n}_i = (e^{\\epsilon_i/k_BT} - 1)^{-1}$.\n\nThe equilibrium values are:\n\n**1. Mean Energy $\\langle E \\rangle$:**\nThe total mean energy is the sum of energies of all occupied states, weighted by their average occupation number.\n$$ \\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\epsilon_i}{e^{\\epsilon_i / (k_B T)} - 1} $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_i$ is the energy of the $i$-th level, $g_i$ is its degeneracy (number of states with that energy), $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\n**2. Entropy S:**\nThe equilibrium entropy is the value of the statistical (Boltzmann) entropy for the most probable macrostate.\n$$ S = k_B \\sum_i g_i \\left[ (\\bar{n}_i + 1)\\ln(\\bar{n}_i + 1) - \\bar{n}_i \\ln \\bar{n}_i \\right] $$\nwhere the mean occupation number $\\bar{n}_i$ is:\n$$ \\bar{n}_i = \\frac{1}{e^{\\epsilon_i / (k_B T)} - 1} $$\n>>>"
