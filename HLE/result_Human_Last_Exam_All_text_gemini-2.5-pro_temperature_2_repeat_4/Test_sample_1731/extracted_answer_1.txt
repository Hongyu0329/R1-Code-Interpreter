The equilibrium values for a system of light quanta (photons) following Bose-Einstein statistics are derived by maximizing the system's entropy subject to a constant average energy. This procedure is the physical manifestation of the large deviation principles mentioned in the question. The resulting equilibrium mean occupation number for a state with energy $\epsilon_i$ is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution $\bar{n}_i = (e^{\epsilon_i/k_BT} - 1)^{-1}$.

The equilibrium values are:

**1. Mean Energy $\langle E \rangle$:**
The total mean energy is the sum of energies of all occupied states, weighted by their average occupation number.
$$ \langle E \rangle = \sum_i \frac{g_i \epsilon_i}{e^{\epsilon_i / (k_B T)} - 1} $$
where $\epsilon_i$ is the energy of the $i$-th level, $g_i$ is its degeneracy (number of states with that energy), $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

**2. Entropy S:**
The equilibrium entropy is the value of the statistical (Boltzmann) entropy for the most probable macrostate.
$$ S = k_B \sum_i g_i \left[ (\bar{n}_i + 1)\ln(\bar{n}_i + 1) - \bar{n}_i \ln \bar{n}_i \right] $$
where the mean occupation number $\bar{n}_i$ is:
$$ \bar{n}_i = \frac{1}{e^{\epsilon_i / (k_B T)} - 1} $$
