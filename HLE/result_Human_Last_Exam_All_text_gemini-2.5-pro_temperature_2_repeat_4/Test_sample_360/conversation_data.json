    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Analyze the Ligand: 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (let's call it L)**\n\n*   **Structure:** The ligand consists of a central `thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole` fused ring system. This core is substituted at its 2- and 5-positions with 2-pyridyl groups.\n*   **Donating Sites:** Each half of the molecule consists of a 2-pyridyl group and a thiazole ring. The nitrogen atom of the pyridyl ring and the nearby nitrogen atom of the thiazole ring can form a stable 5-membered chelate ring with a metal ion. This is a common bidentate `N,N'`-chelating motif.\n*   **Functionality:** The central `thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole` core is rigid and planar. It holds the two bidentate chelating units apart and in a `trans`-like arrangement. This geometry makes it impossible for all four nitrogen donors to coordinate to a single metal center simultaneously to act as a tetradentate ligand. Instead, the ligand `L` functions either as a **bridging ligand** (using both bidentate sites to link two metal centers) or as a simple **bidentate ligand** (using only one of its two chelating sites).\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The most crucial point is correctly identifying that this ligand `L` cannot be a tetradentate chelating ligand for one metal, but will act as a bidentate ligand in a 1:1 reaction with a mononuclear complex.\n\n**2. Analyze the Reactant: cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2])**\n\n*   **Structure:** This is an octahedral Ruthenium(II) complex. It has two bidentate bipyridine (`bpy`) ligands and two monodentate chloride (`Cl⁻`) ligands.\n*   **Geometry:** The `cis` designation means the two chloride ligands are adjacent to each other (90° apart).\n*   **Chirality:** A `cis-M(AA)2X2` type complex (where AA is a symmetric bidentate ligand like `bpy`) lacks any improper axis of rotation (e.g., a mirror plane or center of inversion). Therefore, it is chiral.\n*   **Symmetry within an enantiomer:** Each enantiomer (let's call them Δ and Λ) possesses a C2 axis of rotation. This axis passes through the Ru atom and bisects the Cl-Ru-Cl angle. An important consequence of this C2 axis is that the two chloride ligands are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The starting complex is chiral and is assumed to be a racemic mixture (50% Δ, 50% Λ). The two chloride sites to be substituted are equivalent in each enantiomer.\n\n**3. Analyze the Reaction and Identify the Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` + L → Product(s)\n*   **Plausible Pathway:** Given the components, the most plausible reaction is the substitution of the two labile chloride ligands by a chelating ligand. Ligand `L` can provide one of its bidentate pyridyl-thiazole arms for this. This pathway is much more favorable than breaking the stable Ru-N bonds of the bpy ligands.\n*   **Product:** The reaction produces `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+` and two free `Cl⁻` ions. In the product, `L` is acting as an unsymmetrical bidentate ligand (let's denote its chelating arm as `BC`), and the complex has a tris(bidentate) structure: `[Ru(AA)2(BC)]^2+`.\n\n**4. Determine the Number of Isomers Formed**\n\n*   **Stereochemistry of Substitution:** We start with a racemic mixture of `Δ-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` and `Λ-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`. Let's consider what happens to one enantiomer, for example, the `Δ` form.\n*   **Role of Symmetry:** The two `Cl⁻` ligands in `Δ-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]` are in equivalent positions, related by the C2 axis of the molecule.\n*   **Unsymmetrical Ligand:** The chelating arm of `L` is unsymmetrical, as the pyridine nitrogen and the thiazole nitrogen are in different chemical environments.\n*   **Formation of Isomers:** When an unsymmetrical bidentate ligand (`BC`) replaces two equivalent monodentate ligands on a chiral frame, only **one** stereochemical outcome is possible for that frame.\n    *   Attaching the ligand as `B-Ru-C` (in sites 1 and 2) or as `C-Ru-B` (in sites 1 and 2) does not create different isomers because the two initial sites are interchangeable by a 180° rotation about the molecule's C2 axis. The resulting molecules would be identical, not diastereomers.\n*   **Conclusion of Isomer Count:**\n    1.  The `Δ` enantiomer of the reactant produces a single product isomer: `Δ-[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`.\n    2.  The `Λ` enantiomer of the reactant produces a single product isomer: `Λ-[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`.\n    3.  These two products, the `Δ` and `Λ` forms, are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. They constitute an enantiomeric pair.\n*   **Final Result:** The reaction forms a total of **two** isomers, which are one pair of enantiomers."
