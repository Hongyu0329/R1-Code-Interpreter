    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the \"let-7 family\"**: The let-7 family is a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are highly conserved across many species. A miRNA family is defined by its \"seed sequence,\" a specific sequence of 6-8 nucleotides at the 5' end of the miRNA that is critical for binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). For the let-7 family, the canonical seed sequence is **GAGGTAG**. All members of the family share this seed.\n\n2.  **Scope of the question**: The question is specific to \"humans\" (*Homo sapiens*). This means we should not count let-7 members that are found in other species but not in humans (e.g., let-7h is found in other primates but has been lost in the human lineage).\n\n3.  **Identify the members based on nomenclature**: We can start by listing the miRNAs that are explicitly named \"let-7\" in humans. Consulting the authoritative miRNA database, miRBase, we find the following:\n    *   let-7a\n    *   let-7b\n    *   let-7c\n    *   let-7d\n    *   let-7e\n    *   let-7f\n    *   let-7g\n    *   let-7i\n\n4.  **Identify other family members**: Some miRNAs may belong to a family based on their seed sequence but have a different name. This is often because they were discovered and named before their relationship to the family was established. In the case of the let-7 family, **miR-98** shares the same GAGGTAG seed sequence and is functionally and evolutionarily considered a member of the human let-7 family.\n\n5.  **Compile the final list**: Combining the lists from the previous steps, we get the complete set of human let-7 family members:\n    *   let-7a\n    *   let-7b\n    *   let-7c\n    *   let-7d\n    *   let-7e\n    *   let-7f\n    *   let-7g\n    *   let-7i\n    *   miR-98\n\n6.  **Count the members**: Counting the items in the final list gives a total of **9** members.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Members vs. Genes (Loci)**: This is a crucial distinction. The question asks for the number of \"members,\" which in the context of miRNA families, refers to the number of unique mature miRNA sequences. Several of these members are encoded by more than one gene (paralogs) in the human genome. For instance:\n    *   `let-7a` is encoded by three genes (`let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, `let-7a-3`).\n    *   `let-7f` is encoded by two genes (`let-7f-1`, `let-7f-2`).\n    *   The other seven members are each encoded by a single gene.\n    *   Therefore, there are 9 unique mature miRNA members, but they are encoded by a total of 12 distinct genes (loci). The question asks for members, so the answer is 9, not 12.\n\n2.  **Mature miRNA vs. Precursor miRNA**: Each miRNA gene is first transcribed into a precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is a hairpin-like structure. This pre-miRNA is then processed to produce the shorter, mature miRNA. The question is about the final, functional mature miRNAs.\n\n3.  **-5p vs. -3p Strands**: A pre-miRNA hairpin is processed into a duplex, and often one strand (e.g., from the 5' arm, called -5p) becomes the predominant mature miRNA, while the other strand (from the 3' arm, called -3p) is degraded. Both `hsa-let-7a-5p` and `hsa-let-7a-3p` exist, but only the one with the `GAGGTAG` seed (the -5p strand in this case) is considered part of the \"let-7 family.\" The passenger strand (-3p) has a different seed sequence and is thus not a member.\n\n4.  **\"To date\"**: The number of identified miRNAs can change as sequencing technology and annotation improve. However, the let-7 family is one of the most well-studied, and the number of human members has been stable at 9 for many years and is widely accepted in the scientific community.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBased on the analysis, the number of distinct mature miRNAs belonging to the let-7 family in humans is the sum of the explicitly named let-7 members plus any other miRNAs sharing the same seed sequence.\n\n*   let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i (8 members)\n*   + miR-98 (1 member)\n*   **Total = 9 members**\n\n<<<9>>>"
