    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the conceptual entity.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** The historian Fernand Braudel is the central figure, but he is quoting someone else.\n    *   **Source of the Assertion:** The poet and writer Paul Morand.\n    *   **Core Concept:** A specific \"conceptual entity\" should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\" This \"sphere\" metaphorically represents a global or worldwide context.\n    *   **Clue/Example:** This entity is exemplified by \"the symbol of a nation.\" This suggests we are talking about something that is often viewed from a national perspective but, according to Braudel and Morand, should be viewed globally.\n    *   **Braudel's Emphasis:** The question mentions Braudel's focus on a \"global historical perspective,\" which strongly reinforces the interpretation of the \"sphere\" as the globe or the world system.\n\n2.  **Locate the Quote:** The quote is found in Fernand Braudel's collection of essays, *On History* (originally *Écrits sur l'histoire*), in a piece from 1950. Braudel writes: \"To see a 'problem' on a world scale is a must for any intelligent contemporary mind. As Paul Morand noted with amusement and a touch of the prophetic around 1930, **'Our history, like a simple point, has to be inscribed on the surface of a sphere.'**\"\n\n3.  **Identify the Entity:**\n    *   In the direct quote from Paul Morand, the subject of the sentence—the thing that needs to be inscribed on the sphere—is explicitly stated.\n    *   The quote is: \"**Our history**...\"\n    *   Therefore, the conceptual entity is **history**.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Clues:**\n    *   **Is \"history\" a conceptual entity?** Yes, it is a complex concept, not a physical object.\n    *   **Is it \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation\"?** Yes. Traditional historical studies often focus on the history of a single nation (e.g., French History, American History). Braudel, a leader of the Annales School, argued against this narrow, nation-centric view. He believed the history of a single nation is just one point that can only be understood in the context of global interactions and long-term structures—placing it on the \"sphere\" of world history.\n    *   **Does this align with Braudel's perspective?** Perfectly. His life's work was dedicated to writing \"global history\" or *histoire totale*, which transcends national boundaries.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis clearly points to one specific conceptual entity. Paul Morand stated that \"Our history\" must be inscribed on a sphere, and Fernand Braudel used this quote to champion his own school of thought, which demanded that history (particularly national history) be studied from a global perspective.\n\n<<<history>>>"
