    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Vector Field:**\n    The problem asks for the Hopf charge of a 3D vector field $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$. Let's analyze the components:\n    *   $n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f)$\n    *   $n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f)$\n    *   $n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\n    This is the standard spherical coordinate representation of a unit vector, where $G$ is the polar angle (angle from the z-axis) and $f$ is the azimuthal angle (angle in the xy-plane). Indeed, $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = \\sin^2(G) + \\cos^2(G) = 1$. This means that for every point $(x,y,z)$ in space, the vector $\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z)$ corresponds to a point on the unit sphere $S^2$. The problem defines a map from $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to $S^2$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Auxiliary Functions $f$ and $G$:**\n    The angles $f$ and $G$ depend on the spatial coordinates $(x,y,z)$:\n    *   `f = atan2(y,x)`: This is the azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates. It represents a rotation around the z-axis. For any path that circles the z-axis once counter-clockwise, $f$ increases by $2\\pi$.\n    *   `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`: Let $r_c = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ be the cylindrical radius. Then $r_2 = \\sqrt{(r_c^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2}$. This term, $r_2$, measures the distance from the point $(x,y,z)$ to the nearest point on the circle defined by $z=0$ and $r_c^2=0.5$ (i.e., $x^2+y^2=0.5$). Let's call this circle $C_{core}$.\n    *   `G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))`: This function defines the polar angle $G$ of our vector field. Let's analyze its behavior:\n        *   If a point $(x,y,z)$ lies on the circle $C_{core}$, then $r_2=0$, which gives $G = \\pi e^0 = \\pi$. In this case, $\\mathbf{n} = (\\sin(\\pi)\\cos(f), \\sin(\\pi)\\sin(f), \\cos(\\pi)) = (0, 0, -1)$. So, all points on the circle $C_{core}$ are mapped to the \"south pole\" of the sphere $S^2$.\n        *   If a point $(x,y,z)$ is very far from the circle $C_{core}$, i.e., $r_2 \\to \\infty$, then $G = \\pi e^{-\\infty} = 0$. In this case, $\\mathbf{n} = (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)$. This includes all points at spatial infinity ($\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} \\to \\infty$). Thus, the field is constant at infinity, which is a requirement for a well-defined Hopf charge.\n\n3.  **Understanding the Hopf Charge:**\n    The Hopf charge is a topological invariant that characterizes how the preimages of points on the target sphere $S^2$ are linked in the domain space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. For a map $\\mathbf{n}: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\cup \\{\\infty\\} \\cong S^3 \\to S^2$, the Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular values (points) on $S^2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Linking Number of Two Preimages:**\n    Let's find the preimages of two convenient points on the sphere $S^2$.\n    *   **Point 1: The South Pole, $P_S = (0, 0, -1)$**\n        The preimage of $P_S$ is the set of points $(x,y,z)$ where $\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z) = (0,0,-1)$. As we found in step 2, this occurs when $G=\\pi$, which corresponds to $r_2=0$. This is precisely the circle $C_{core}$: $x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0$. Let's call this preimage curve $C_1$.\n\n    *   **Point 2: An Equatorial Point, $P_E = (1, 0, 0)$**\n        The preimage of $P_E$ is the set of points where $\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z)=(1,0,0)$. This requires:\n        *   $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G = \\pi/2$ (since $G \\in [0, \\pi]$).\n        *   $n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f) = \\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin(f) = \\sin(f) = 0$.\n        *   $n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f) = \\sin(\\pi/2)\\cos(f) = \\cos(f) = 1$.\n        These two angle conditions imply $f = 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.\n        Now we translate the condition on $G$ into a condition on the spatial coordinates:\n        $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2 \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2 \\implies -10 r_2 = -\\ln(2) \\implies r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$.\n        And the condition on $f$ means `atan2(y,x)=0`, which corresponds to the half-plane $y=0, x>0$.\n        So the preimage curve is defined by the intersection of this half-plane and the surface $r_2 = \\ln(2)/10$:\n        $\\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2} = \\ln(2)/10$.\n        Substituting $y=0$, we get the equation for the preimage curve $C_2$:\n        $(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2$, with $y=0$ and $x>0$.\n        This is the equation of a closed loop in the positive xz-half-plane.\n\n5.  **Determine if the Curves are Linked:**\n    The Hopf charge is the linking number of the two curves, $Q_H = \\text{Link}(C_1, C_2)$.\n    *   $C_1$ is the circle $x^2+y^2=0.5$ in the $z=0$ (xy) plane.\n    *   $C_2$ is a closed loop in the $y=0$ (xz) plane.\n\n    To find if they are linked, we can check if $C_2$ pierces the disk bounded by $C_1$. The disk bounded by $C_1$ is $D_1 = \\{(x,y,z) | x^2+y^2 \\leq 0.5, z=0\\}$.\n    The curve $C_2$ intersects the plane of the disk ($z=0$) where its equation satisfies $z=0$:\n    $(x^2 - 0.5)^2 = (\\ln(2)/10)^2 \\implies x^2 - 0.5 = \\pm \\ln(2)/10 \\implies x^2 = 0.5 \\pm \\ln(2)/10$.\n    Since $\\ln(2)/10 \\approx 0.0693$, which is less than 0.5, both values for $x^2$ are positive. As $C_2$ is in the $x>0$ half-plane, we have two intersection points:\n    *   $P_a = (\\sqrt{0.5 + \\ln(2)/10}, 0, 0)$. Here, $x^2 > 0.5$, so this point is *outside* the disk $D_1$.\n    *   $P_b = (\\sqrt{0.5 - \\ln(2)/10}, 0, 0)$. Here, $x^2 < 0.5$, so this point is *inside* the disk $D_1$.\n\n    The curve $C_2$ is a single continuous loop in the xz-plane. It intersects the xy-plane (the plane of the disk) at two points, one inside the disk and one outside. This geometric arrangement means that the loop $C_2$ must pass through the surface of the disk $D_1$ exactly once. Therefore, the two curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ are linked. The magnitude of the linking number is 1.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the Hopf Charge:**\n    The field configuration described is a canonical example of a \"Hopfion\" or a topological soliton characterized by the Hopf invariant. The calculation of the linking number of preimages shows that this number is $\\pm 1$. By standard physics conventions for such field configurations, the sign is taken to be positive. Therefore, the Hopf charge is 1. The specific constants like `0.5`, `10`, and `PI` define the specific shape and size of the field configuration but do not change its fundamental topology."
