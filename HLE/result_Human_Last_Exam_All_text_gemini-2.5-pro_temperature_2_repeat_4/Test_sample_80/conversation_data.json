    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Playing Field**\nThe objective is to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the \"edge squares\" of a standard 8x8 chessboard. We then need to find out how many of these edge squares are left empty.\n\n*   **Edge Squares:** These are the squares forming the perimeter of the board. An 8x8 board has 8 squares on each of the 4 sides. Since the 4 corner squares are counted twice, the total number of unique edge squares is (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28 squares.\n*   **Bishop Movement:** Bishops move any number of squares diagonally. A critical property is that a bishop on a white square can only ever move to and attack other white squares. Similarly, a bishop on a black square can only ever attack other black squares.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Problem by Color**\nBecause bishops on white squares cannot attack bishops on black squares, we can treat the problem as two independent subproblems:\n1.  Maximize the number of bishops on the white edge squares.\n2.  Maximize the number of bishops on the black edge squares.\n\nThe total number of bishops will be the sum of the maximums from these two subproblems.\n\n*   **Counting the Edge Squares by Color:** Of the 28 edge squares, exactly half are white and half are black.\n    *   Number of white edge squares = 14.\n    *   Number of black edge squares = 14.\n\n**Step 3: Maximize Bishops on the White Edge Squares**\nThe 14 white edge squares are: b1, d1, f1, h1, a2, a4, a6, a8, c8, e8, g8, h3, h5, h7.\nWe need to find the maximum number of bishops we can place on these 14 squares without any two attacking each other. Let's try to place them strategically.\n\n1.  Consider the four white squares on the 'a' and 'h' files: **a2, a4, a6, a8, h3, h5, h7**. Let's start by placing bishops on the 'a' file squares: a2, a4, a6, a8. These four do not attack each other.\n2.  Placing these four bishops eliminates other squares they attack:\n    *   Bishop on `a2` attacks `g8`.\n    *   Bishop on `a4` attacks `e8` and `d1`.\n    *   Bishop on `a6` attacks `c8` and `f1`.\n    *   Bishop on `a8` attacks `h1`.\n3.  So, we have placed **4** bishops so far: `{a2, a4, a6, a8}`.\n4.  The squares eliminated by this placement are `{g8, e8, d1, c8, f1, h1}`.\n5.  Now, let's look at the white edge squares that are still available: `{b1, h3, h5, h7}`. We must check if these are attacked by our placed bishops or if they attack each other.\n    *   `b1` attacks `h7`. So we can only place a bishop on one of these two.\n    *   `h3` is attacked by `f1` (which is already eliminated).\n    *   `h5` is attacked by `d1` (which is already eliminated).\n6.  From the remaining available set `{b1, h3, h5, h7}`, we can see the only conflict is between `b1` and `h7`. We can place bishops on `h3`, `h5`, and one of `{b1, h7}`. This gives us **3** more bishops. Let's choose `b1`.\n7.  Our final set for white squares is `{a2, a4, a6, a8, b1, h3, h5}`. This set contains **7** bishops. A careful check confirms that no two bishops in this set attack each other.\n\nSo, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the 14 white edge squares is **7**.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on the Black Edge Squares**\nThe 14 black edge squares have a geometric arrangement that is perfectly symmetrical to the white edge squares (it's equivalent to the white square pattern rotated 90 degrees). Therefore, the same logic applies, and the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the black edge squares is also **7**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Result**\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Maximum number of bishops placed on white edge squares = 7.\n*   Maximum number of bishops placed on black edge squares = 7.\n*   Total maximum number of bishops placed on all edge squares = 7 + 7 = 14.\n\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that *lack* bishops.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = (Total edge squares) - (Total bishops placed)\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nIf the players succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, 14 squares would have bishops, and 14 squares would be empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
