    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the key difference in the execution of a *cambré derrière* (a backward bend) between two major ballet methodologies: the Vaganova method (Russian) and the Balanchine method (American, developed by George Balanchine).\n\n2.  **Define Cambré Derrière:** This is a fundamental ballet movement involving an arch of the upper body backward from the waist. It requires flexibility in the upper and middle back, core strength, and proper alignment.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method's Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Emphasis:** The Vaganova method places a strong emphasis on a solid, stable core and correct anatomical alignment. The principle of \"opposition\" is key.\n    *   **Execution:** When executing a cambré derrière, the Vaganova technique strictly requires the dancer to keep their hips square and directly over their supporting leg(s). The torso lifts up and out of the waist before bending backward, initiated from the upper spine. The hips provide a stable base and actively resist pulling backward with the torso, creating a powerful sense of opposition and control. The goal is to isolate the bend in the thoracic (upper) and lumbar (lower) spine while maintaining pelvic stability.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method's Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Emphasis:** The Balanchine method is known for its speed, musicality, and creating dynamic, elongated lines. The aesthetic often pushes the boundaries of classical technique to create a more extreme visual effect.\n    *   **Execution:** In a Balanchine-style cambré derrière, the dancer is encouraged to press the hips *forward* as the upper body arches back. This action breaks the strict vertical alignment of the Vaganova style. By pushing the hips forward, the dancer can create a deeper, more sweeping curve and a visually dramatic line. This is a stylistic choice that sacrifices the Vaganova principle of hip stability for a different aesthetic quality.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there can be stylistic differences in how arms are used (*port de bras*) in both methods, it is not the most fundamental and defining difference in the mechanics of the cambré itself.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This directly addresses the core difference identified. Vaganova insists on keeping the hips stable and square over the feet. Balanchine allows and often requires the hips to press forward. This is a primary technical and stylistic distinction.\n    *   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's choreography is often faster, the speed of any given movement is a choreographic choice, not an inherent difference in the technique of how a cambré is taught or executed in an exercise setting. A cambré can be done slowly or quickly in either style.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the bend is largely dependent on a dancer's individual flexibility. While the Balanchine hip placement can facilitate a visually deeper-looking bend, the \"degree\" itself is a result of the technique and the dancer's physical capacity, not the defining difference in the method's instruction. The *how* (hip placement) is the methodological difference, not the *how much* (degree).\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head generally follows the line of the spine to create a long, unbroken line. While there might be subtle stylistic variations in the focus or eyeline, it's not the main point of divergence compared to the use of the hips.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most significant and widely recognized technical difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the **placement of the hip**. Vaganova requires hip stability and squareness, while Balanchine utilizes a forward press of the hips to create a more dynamic and extended line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
