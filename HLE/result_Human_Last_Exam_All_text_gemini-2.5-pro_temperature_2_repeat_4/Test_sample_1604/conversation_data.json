    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the historically latest battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Key Paintings and their Subjects**\nFirst, we must compile a list of Lady Butler's famous military paintings and the specific historical events (battles or conflicts) they depict. Lady Butler (Elizabeth Thompson) was renowned for her realistic and evocative military scenes.\n\nKey paintings include:\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras***: Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras.\n*   ***Scotland Forever!***: Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo.\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army***: Depicts William Brydon's arrival at Jalalabad, marking the end of the retreat from Kabul in the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n*   ***The Roll Call***, ***Balaclava***, and ***The Return from Inkerman***: Depict scenes from the Crimean War, specifically focusing on the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman and the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift***: Depicts the battle of the same name during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   ***The Camel Corps***: Depicts the Gordon Relief Expedition during the Mahdist War.\n*   ***Charge of the Lancers... at the Battle of Omdurman***: Depicts the cavalry charge at the Battle of Omdurman.\n*   ***The V.C.***: Depicts a heroic act of gallantry during the First World War.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Historical Dates of the Depicted Events**\nNext, we need to find the dates for each of these historical battles or military campaigns.\n\n*   Battle of Quatre Bras: **June 16, 1815**\n*   Battle of Waterloo: **June 18, 1815**\n*   Retreat from Kabul (First Anglo-Afghan War): **January 1842**\n*   Crimean War (Battles of Balaclava & Inkerman): **October-November 1854**\n*   Battle of Rorke's Drift (Anglo-Zulu War): **January 1879**\n*   Gordon Relief Expedition (Mahdist War): **1884-1885**\n*   Battle of Omdurman (Mahdist War): **September 2, 1898**\n*   First World War: **1914–1918**\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Dates to Find the Latest Battle**\nBy arranging the events in chronological order, we can identify which one occurred latest in history.\n\n1.  Battle of Waterloo (1815)\n2.  Retreat from Kabul (1842)\n3.  Crimean War (1854)\n4.  Battle of Rorke's Drift (1879)\n5.  Gordon Relief Expedition (1885)\n6.  Battle of Omdurman (1898)\n7.  First World War (1914–1918)\n\nThe chronological list clearly shows that the First World War is the most recent conflict Lady Butler depicted.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Painting Date vs. Event Date:** It is crucial not to confuse the year a painting was created with the historical date of the event it depicts. For example, *Charge of the Lancers... at the Battle of Omdurman* was painted in 1917, but the battle itself took place in 1898. The question concerns the historical timing of the battle, not the artwork's creation.\n*   **Specific Battle vs. General Conflict:** While most of her famous works depict a specific, named battle (like Waterloo or Omdurman), her painting *The V.C.* (c. 1921) portrays an unnamed heroic scene from the First World War (1914-1918). Even though it doesn't name a specific engagement, any combat action during the First World War is historically later than the Battle of Omdurman in 1898. The scene of combat itself represents a \"battle\" in the context of the question.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe latest specific named battle painted by Lady Butler is the Battle of Omdurman (1898). However, she also painted a scene from a later conflict, the First World War (1914-1918), in her work *The V.C.*. Therefore, the battle scene from this conflict is the latest historically.\n\n<<<The First World War"
