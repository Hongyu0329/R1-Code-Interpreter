    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Who:** Two specific individuals.\n*   **What:** They were featured in a commercial.\n*   **Qualifier:** Both individuals are Nobel laureates.\n*   **For whom:** The commercial was for the company Enron.\n*   **When:** The commercial aired in 2000.\n*   **Identifying feature:** The commercial had the tagline \"Ask Why.\"\n*   **Tone:** The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" which hints at the irony of the campaign given Enron's spectacular collapse due to fraud shortly after.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the \"Ask Why\" Campaign\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major advertising effort by Enron in 2000. It aimed to position the company not just as an energy trader, but as a revolutionary innovator in markets, logistics, and risk management. The ads featured experts and thinkers discussing complex ideas, all culminating in the tagline \"Ask Why,\" which, in hindsight, became deeply ironic when the company's fraudulent practices were exposed.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the First Nobel Laureate\n*   Researching the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercials reveals that several prominent economists and thinkers were featured.\n*   One of the most frequently cited participants is **Paul Krugman**.\n*   **Careful point:** We must verify his status as a Nobel laureate. Paul Krugman won the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity.\n*   **Analysis:** Although he was not a Nobel laureate in 2000 when the commercial was made, he is one now. The question asks which two \"Nobel laureates *were* featured,\" which refers to their identity, not their status at that exact moment in time. Thus, he qualifies as one of the two.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Second Nobel Laureate\n*   Searching further for other notable economists in the same campaign leads to the name **Myron Scholes**.\n*   **Careful point:** We must also verify his Nobel status and the timing. Myron Scholes won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 (shared with Robert C. Merton) for developing a new method to determine the value of derivatives, famously known as the Black-Scholes model.\n*   **Analysis:** Unlike Krugman, Myron Scholes was already a Nobel laureate at the time he appeared in the 2000 Enron commercial. This is also infamous for another reason: Scholes was a founding partner of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), which collapsed spectacularly in 1998, requiring a massive Fed-organized bailout. His appearance in a commercial about financial innovation for another company that would soon collapse is a point of significant historical irony.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe two individuals who fit all the criteria of the question—being featured in the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial and being Nobel laureates—are Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
