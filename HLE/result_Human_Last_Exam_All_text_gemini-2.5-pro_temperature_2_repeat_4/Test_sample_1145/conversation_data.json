    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Physics and Formulate the Problem\n\nThe system is a quantum particle confined to a one-dimensional box of length `a`. The position of the particle is described by a wave function, ψ_n(x), where `n` is the quantum number representing the energy state.\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in a small interval `dx` at position `x` is given by the probability density, P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|², multiplied by `dx`. To find the probability over a finite interval from `x1` to `x2`, we must integrate the probability density over that interval:\n\nProbability = ∫[from x1 to x2] |ψ_n(x)|² dx\n\n### Step 2: Write the Specific Wave Function and Probability Density\n\nFor a particle in a 1D box of length `a` (from x=0 to x=a), the normalized wave function is:\nψ_n(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)\n\nThe problem specifies the particle is in the `n = 2` state. So, the wave function is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)\n\nThe corresponding probability density is the square of the magnitude of the wave function:\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (√(2/a) * sin(2πx / a))² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)\n\n### Step 3: Set up the Definite Integral\n\nWe need to find the probability that the particle is located in the interval from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`. We set up the integral:\n\nProbability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Integral\n\nTo solve this integral, we first use the trigonometric identity: sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ)) / 2.\nHere, θ = 2πx / a. So, 2θ = 4πx / a.\n\nThe integral becomes:\nProbability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * [ (1 - cos(4πx / a)) / 2 ] dx\nProbability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1/a) * (1 - cos(4πx / a)) dx\n\nNow, we perform the integration:\nProbability = (1/a) * [ x - (a / 4π)sin(4πx / a) ] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nNext, we apply the limits of integration:\nProbability = (1/a) * { [0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] - [0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)] }\n\nSimplify the expression by combining terms:\nProbability = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - 0.495a) - (a/4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)) ]\nProbability = (1/a) * [ 0.01a - (a/4π) * (sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)) ]\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n\nWe use the trigonometric identities sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ) and sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ):\nsin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)\nsin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\n\nSubstitute these back into the probability expression:\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [2sin(0.02π)]\nProbability = 0.01 - (1 / 2π) * sin(0.02π)\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Numerical Value\n\n**Careful Point:** Direct calculation of the final expression can lead to precision errors because `0.01` and `(1/2π)sin(0.02π)` are very close in value. This happens because the interval is centered on a node (a point of zero probability) of the `n=2` state at `x = a/2`.\n\nA more robust method is to use a Taylor series approximation for the sine function since its argument `u = 0.02π` is very small. The Taylor series for sin(u) is `u - u³/3! + u⁵/5! - ...`.\n\nProbability ≈ 0.01 - (1 / 2π) * [ (0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6 ]\nProbability ≈ 0.01 - [ (0.01) - (1 / 2π) * (0.02π)³/6 ]\nProbability ≈ (1 / 2π) * (0.000008π³) / 6\nProbability ≈ (0.000008π²) / 12\nProbability ≈ (8 × 10⁻⁶ × π²) / 12\nProbability ≈ (2/3) × π² × 10⁻⁶\n\nNow, we calculate the final numerical value using π ≈ 3.14159, so π² ≈ 9.8696:\nProbability ≈ (2/3) × 9.8696 × 10⁻⁶\nProbability ≈ 6.5797 × 10⁻⁶\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the probability is approximately 6.58 × 10⁻⁶."
