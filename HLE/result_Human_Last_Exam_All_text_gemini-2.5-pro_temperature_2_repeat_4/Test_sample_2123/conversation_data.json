    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:**\n    *   **Context:** The question refers to a \"Russian translation of a certain essay.\" This suggests the original might be non-Russian, or it could be a slight inaccuracy in the phrasing, and the work is originally in Russian. The key is that the text is known in the Russian-speaking world.\n    *   **Subject:** The text describes the \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\" This is a very specific setting, likely pointing to Vienna's famous Ringstrasse.\n    *   **Clue:** In this description, the \"surname of an English poet\" appears.\n    *   **Task:** Identify this surname and provide it in English.\n\n2.  **Identifying Potential Sources and the Connection:**\n    *   The phrase connects three elements: Russian literature/translation, Vienna, and an English poet. This is likely a famous literary simile or metaphor used by a well-read author.\n    *   A search for phrases combining these elements in Russian (e.g., \"венские бульвары\" + \"английский поэт\") leads to a very famous aphorism from Russian literature.\n\n3.  **Locating the Exact Quote and Author:**\n    *   The quote in question comes from the Russian writer **Yury Olesha** (Юрий Олеша).\n    *   The work is his posthumously published book of notes, memoirs, and reflections titled **\"No Day Without a Line\"** («Ни дня без строчки»). This work is often read as a collection of essays.\n    *   The famous sentence is: **\"Венский проспект широк, как сонет Шекспира.\"**\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Quote:**\n    *   **Translation:** \"A Viennese prospect is as wide as a sonnet by Shakespeare.\"\n    *   **Vienna's boulevards:** The \"Viennese prospect\" (Венский проспект) is a clear reference to the grand avenues of Vienna.\n    *   **The English Poet:** The poet mentioned is **Shakespeare**. He is unequivocally an English poet.\n    *   **The Surname:** His surname is Shakespeare. The comparison implies that the boulevard possesses the same qualities of grandeur, formal perfection, and classical structure as a Shakespearean sonnet.\n\n5.  **Final Confirmation:**\n    *   The source is a famous Russian literary work.\n    *   The setting is the boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   The name mentioned is Shakespeare, an English poet.\n    *   The answer required is the surname in English.\n\nTherefore, the surname of the English poet is Shakespeare.\n\n<<<Shakespeare>>>"
