The displacement field is the sum of the displacement fields due to the top and bottom gates. The displacement field due to the top gate is $D_{tg} = C_{tg}V_{tg}$. The displacement field due to the bottom gate is $D_{bg} = C_{bg}V_{bg}$. The total displacement field is the sum of the two, which is $D = C_{tg}V_{tg} + C_{bg}V_{bg}$.
