    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Coordinate System and the Cubes\nFirst, let's place one of the cubes, let's call it Cube A, in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. A convenient placement is with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and its sides aligned with the axes. Since the side length is 1, Cube A occupies the region defined by:\n*   Cube A: `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Shift\nThe second cube, Cube B, is shifted relative to Cube A. The shift is described as being \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Identify the main diagonal.** For the cube positioned at `[0,1]^3`, the main diagonal connects the vertex at the origin (0,0,0) to the opposite vertex (1,1,1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Interpret the shift \"by 1/2\".** This phrase is slightly ambiguous. It could mean:\n    1.  The magnitude (Euclidean distance) of the shift vector is 1/2.\n    2.  The shift vector is `1/2 * d = 1/2 * (1,1,1) = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n\n    Let's analyze both. If we use interpretation (1), the shift vector would be `(1/2) * (unit vector in direction d) = (1/2) * (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3) = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3))`. This leads to a complicated, non-integer result.\n\n    Interpretation (2) is more likely the intended meaning in the context of such a geometry problem for several reasons:\n    *   It corresponds to a geometrically simple action: shifting the corner of Cube B to the exact center of Cube A (since the center of Cube A is at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)).\n    *   It leads to a \"cleaner\" answer, which is typical for such puzzles.\n    *   It can be rigorously interpreted as a shift of distance 1/2 in the L-infinity norm (`max(|Δx|, |Δy|, |Δz|) = 1/2`), a norm naturally associated with cubes.\n\n    Therefore, we will proceed with the shift vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n### Step 3: Define the Position of the Second Cube\nCube B is simply Cube A translated by the vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). So, for any point (x, y, z) in Cube B, the point (x-1/2, y-1/2, z-1/2) must be in Cube A.\nThis gives us the inequalities for Cube B:\n*   `0 ≤ x - 1/2 ≤ 1`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 ≤ y - 1/2 ≤ 1`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 ≤ z - 1/2 ≤ 1`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n### Step 4: Find the Region of Intersection\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the set of all points (x, y, z) that satisfy the inequalities for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We find the intersection for each coordinate range independently.\n\n*   **x-dimension:** The point must be in `[0, 1]` AND `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **y-dimension:** The point must be in `[0, 1]` AND `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **z-dimension:** The point must be in `[0, 1]` AND `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\nSo, the region of intersection is a smaller cube defined by `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`, `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection\nThe intersection is a cube. To find its volume, we first determine its side length.\n\n*   Side length of the intersection cube = `(upper bound) - (lower bound)`\n*   Side length = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume of a cube is `(side length)^3`.\n*   Volume = `(1/2)^3`\n*   Volume = `1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2`\n*   Volume = `1/8`\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
