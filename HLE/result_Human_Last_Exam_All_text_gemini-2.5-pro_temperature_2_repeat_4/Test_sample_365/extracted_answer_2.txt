The product is a tetracyclic ketone formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The original alcohol at C2 is converted to a ketone. The C1-C2 bond of the norbornene skeleton is cleaved, while a new C-C bond forms between C5 (norbornene) and C2' (cyclopentene). A new C=C double bond is formed between C1 and C6 of the original norbornene moiety. The silyl ether and ketal protecting groups remain unchanged.
