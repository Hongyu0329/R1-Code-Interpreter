    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function Z for the given system using the path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and the Grand Canonical Ensemble**\n\n1.  **Grand Canonical Ensemble:** This ensemble describes an open system that can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir at constant temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$.\n2.  **Partition Function (Z):** The partition function in the grand canonical ensemble is defined as the trace of the statistical operator:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{-\\beta (\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right]$\n    where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the Hamiltonian of the system, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n3.  **Interpreting the Hamiltonian:** The problem states that the system's Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. A careful point here is to distinguish the Hamiltonian of the system itself ($\\hat{H}_{sys}$) from the operator that appears in the grand canonical exponent. Following standard definitions, we set $\\hat{H}_{sys} = \\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$.\n4.  **Formulating the Operator:** The full operator in the exponent is therefore:\n    $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N} = (-\\mu \\hat{N}) - (\\mu \\hat{N}) = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$.\n5.  **Expression for Z:** We thus need to calculate the partition function:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{-\\beta (-2\\mu \\hat{N})} \\right] = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} \\right]$.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Path Integral**\n\n1.  **Path Integral Representation:** The partition function Z can be expressed as a functional integral over fields $\\psi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] e^{-S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\n2.  **The Action (S):** The action $S$ is given by integrating the Lagrangian over imaginary time $\\tau$ (from 0 to $\\beta$) and space. For a system governed by the operator $\\hat{K}$, the action is:\n    $S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^dx \\, \\bar{\\psi}(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) (\\partial_\\tau + \\hat{K}) \\psi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$.\n3.  **Simplifying the Action:** The operator $\\hat{K} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$ corresponds to a second-quantized Hamiltonian without spatial dependence (like kinetic energy) or interactions. It describes degenerate particles whose energy is determined only by the chemical potential. For a single such mode, the spatial integral is trivial, and the action becomes:\n    $S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\bar{\\psi}(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi(\\tau)$.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nThe evaluation depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions, as this dictates the nature of the fields and their boundary conditions in imaginary time.\n\n**Case 1: The system consists of Fermions**\n\n1.  **Fields and Boundary Conditions:** The fields $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$ are independent Grassmann variables. Fermionic fields obey anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time: $\\psi(\\beta) = -\\psi(0)$.\n2.  **Matsubara Expansion:** We expand the field in a Fourier series with fermionic Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$, where $n$ is an integer.\n    $\\psi(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_n e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} \\psi_n$\n3.  **Action in Frequency Space:** Substituting the expansion into the action yields a sum over Matsubara modes:\n    $S_F = \\sum_n \\bar{\\psi}_n (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu) \\psi_n$\n4.  **Calculating the Integral:** The path integral becomes a product of Berezin integrals for each mode:\n    $Z_F = \\int \\left( \\prod_n d\\bar{\\psi}_n d\\psi_n \\right) e^{-\\sum_n \\bar{\\psi}_n(-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)\\psi_n} = \\prod_n (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)$.\n5.  **Result:** This product is equal to the determinant of the operator $(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)$ acting on the space of anti-periodic functions. This is a standard result in quantum field theory:\n    $\\det(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)_{\\text{anti-periodic}} = 1 + e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)} = 1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}$.\n    So, for fermions, the partition function is $Z_F = 1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}$.\n\n**Case 2: The system consists of Bosons**\n\n1.  **Fields and Boundary Conditions:** The fields $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$ are standard complex variables. Bosonic fields obey periodic boundary conditions: $\\psi(\\beta) = \\psi(0)$.\n2.  **Matsubara Expansion:** We expand the field using bosonic Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n/\\beta$, where $n$ is an integer.\n3.  **Action in Frequency Space:** The action has the same form, but with bosonic frequencies:\n    $S_B = \\sum_n \\bar{\\psi}_n (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu) \\psi_n$\n4.  **Calculating the Integral:** The path integral is a product of Gaussian integrals:\n    $Z_B = \\int \\left( \\prod_n d\\bar{\\psi}_n d\\psi_n \\right) e^{-\\sum_n \\bar{\\psi}_n(-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)\\psi_n} \\propto \\prod_n \\frac{1}{(-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)}$.\n5.  **Result:** This product is the inverse of the determinant of the operator $(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)$ acting on the space of periodic functions. This is another standard result:\n    $\\det(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)_{\\text{periodic}} = 1 - e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)} = 1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}$.\n    Thus, for bosons, the partition function is $Z_B \\propto (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$.\n    For this to be physically meaningful (for the trace to converge), we must have $e^{2\\beta\\mu} < 1$, which implies $\\mu < 0$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nSince the statistics of the particles are not specified, we provide the answer for both cases.\n\n*   For a system of **fermions**, the partition function for a single mode is:\n    $Z_F = 1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}$\n*   For a system of **bosons**, the partition function for a single mode is:\n    $Z_B = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$  (valid for $\\mu < 0$)\n\nThese two results can be combined into a single expression:\n$Z = (1 - \\eta e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-\\eta}$\nwhere $\\eta = -1$ for fermions and $\\eta = +1$ for bosons.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, providing the two separate, explicit answers is the clearest approach.\n\n<<<\nFor fermions: $Z = 1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu}$\nFor bosons: $Z = (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-1}$\n>>>"
