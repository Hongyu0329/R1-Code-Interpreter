    "This question asks to identify the ballroom dance in which a reverse turn cannot be \"overturned\" (turned more than the standard amount) without violating the fundamental technique of that dance. Let's analyze each option.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the core concepts:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing that rotates to the left (counter-clockwise).\n    *   **Overturn:** To intentionally increase the amount of rotation in a figure beyond its textbook definition. This is often done for choreographic purposes to achieve a different alignment on the dance floor.\n    *   **Technique:** The specific set of rules and physical actions that define a dance style. This includes posture, hold, footwork, rise and fall, sway, CBM (Contrary Body Movement), and the overall character of the movement (e.g., smooth vs. staccato).\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Swing\" Dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep):**\n    *   The defining characteristic of these four dances is **swing**. This involves a pendulum-like motion of the body, creating momentum that carries the couple through the figures.\n    *   These dances also feature **rise and fall**, where the body rises and lowers through the feet and knees, and **sway**, which is the inclination of the body.\n    *   The combination of swing, momentum, rise and fall, and sway creates a continuous, flowing movement. This inherent flow and momentum make it technically possible to extend the rotation of a turn. A skilled dancer can use these technical elements to \"overturn\" a reverse turn while still adhering to the dance's core principles. For example, by generating more body rotation and allowing the momentum to carry them further around, they can modify the turn amount. This is a common and accepted practice in advanced choreography for these dances. Therefore, in A, B, D, and E, it is **possible** to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.\n\n3.  **Analyze the European Tango:**\n    *   The technique of the European Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances.\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The movement is kept on one level, with the dancers moving in a \"prowling\" or \"stalking\" manner. The knees remain flexed.\n    *   **No Sway:** The body is held strong and erect, without the side-to-side inclination seen in swing dances.\n    *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, clipped, and distinct, with a clear start and stop to each step. There is no continuous flow or momentum carrying over from one step to the next in the same way as swing dances.\n    *   **No Swing:** The feet are kept close to the floor and track under the body. The legs are not swung forward from the hip.\n    *   **Conclusion for Tango:** Because the Tango lacks the elements of swing, continuous momentum, and rise and fall, there is no technical mechanism to create extra rotation within a standard figure like a reverse turn. The turn is executed as a series of sharp pivots and placements. To force more rotation (to overturn it) would require introducing elements that are forbidden in Tango technique, such as lifting the body (introducing rise), swinging the legs or body (introducing swing), or breaking the staccato nature of the movement. Doing so would fundamentally violate, or \"disregard,\" the core technique of the Tango.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The key distinction lies in the fundamental movement philosophy of the dances. Swing dances are built on momentum and flow, which allows for variation in rotation.\n*   Tango is built on sharp, contained, and grounded movements, which do not technically support the concept of overturning a figure without breaking its essential character.\n*   While a dancer could physically turn more, the question is whether it can be done *without disregarding the technique*. In Tango, this is not possible.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nBased on the analysis, the Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep all possess technical elements (swing, momentum, flow) that allow a reverse turn to be overturned as a valid choreographic choice. The European Tango's core technique (no swing, no rise and fall, staccato) makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without fundamentally violating that technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
