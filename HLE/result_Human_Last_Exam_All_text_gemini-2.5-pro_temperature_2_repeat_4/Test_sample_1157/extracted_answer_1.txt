The appropriate management involves a multi-phased approach. **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Medical consultation to manage her uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%), wound debridement of the sockets, administration of systemic antibiotics and analgesics. Replantation of the lost teeth is contraindicated due to the 28-hour delay. **Phase 2 (Definitive)**: After a healing period and improvement in her diabetic control, the most appropriate prosthetic treatment is a Removable Partial Denture (RPD). The key **cells of interest** are the non-viable **Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells**, which make replantation impossible, and the **osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and immune cells**, whose function is compromised by diabetes, affecting healing.

If deciding on denture replacement, the recommended choice is a **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture** made of a **Cobalt-Chromium alloy framework** with **heat-cured acrylic resin** for the base and **acrylic teeth**. The **abutment teeth** would be the **left central incisor (#21)** and **left second premolar (#25)** as primary abutments adjacent to the gap. Crucially, abutments on the contralateral side, such as the **right first molar (#16) and right canine (#13)**, must be included. **Reasons** for this design are to achieve **
