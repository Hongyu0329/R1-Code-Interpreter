    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   For a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with 7 carbons, the formula would be $C_nH_{2n+2} = C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The given formula has two fewer hydrogens than the saturated formula ($16 - 14 = 2$).\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (number of missing hydrogens) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals in the spectrum, but the molecule has 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent (due to symmetry) or that there is an accidental overlap of two signals.\n*   **Chemical Shifts (ppm) and Multiplicities (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling):**\n    *   **145(s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity 's' (singlet) indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens, C).\n    *   **112(t):** The chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicates a methylene group ($CH_2$).\n    *   **48(t):** The chemical shift is in the alkane region (0-50 ppm). The 't' multiplicity indicates another methylene group ($CH_2$). This signal is somewhat deshielded for a typical alkane $CH_2$.\n    *   **27(d):** The chemical shift is in the alkane region. The 'd' (doublet) multiplicity indicates a methine group (CH).\n    *   **22(q):** The chemical shift is in the alkane region. The 'q' (quartet) multiplicity indicates a methyl group ($CH_3$).\n    *   **21(q):** The chemical shift is in the alkane region. The 'q' multiplicity indicates another methyl group ($CH_3$).\n\n**Step 3: Assemble Fragments based on NMR Data**\n*   The two signals in the alkene region (145 ppm and 112 ppm) confirm the presence of a double bond. Based on their multiplicities, the double bond is between a quaternary carbon and a $CH_2$ group. This gives us the fragment: **>C=CH₂**.\n*   Let's sum the carbons and hydrogens from the given signals:\n    *   Carbons: 1(C) + 1($CH_2$) + 1($CH_2$) + 1(CH) + 1($CH_3$) + 1($CH_3$) = 6 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 11 hydrogens.\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens (a $CH_3$ group).\n*   The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" and the missing $CH_3$ group suggest that one of the existing signals must account for more than one carbon. The only way this is possible with the given multiplicities is if one of the quartet signals (from a $CH_3$ group) actually represents two chemically equivalent $CH_3$ groups.\n*   Let's assume one of the 'q' signals represents two equivalent methyl groups. Our revised fragment inventory is:\n    *   One quaternary carbon (C)\n    *   Two methylene groups ($CH_2$)\n    *   One methine group (CH)\n    *   Three methyl groups ($CH_3$), two of which are equivalent.\n    This now correctly accounts for all 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens.\n*   Let's combine these fragments into logical groups:\n    *   An ethyl group (-$CH_2CH_3$) accounts for one $CH_2$ (the 48t signal) and one unique $CH_3$ (one of the q signals).\n    *   An isopropyl group (-CH($CH_3$)$_2$) accounts for the CH group (the 27d signal) and the two equivalent $CH_3$ groups (the other q signal).\n*   The molecule is formed by attaching the ethyl group and the isopropyl group to the two available bonds of the quaternary carbon in our >C=CH₂ fragment.\n\n**Step 4: Propose the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   The assembled structure is:\n                    (CH₃)₂CH \\\n                                 C = CH₂\n                     CH₃CH₂   /\n\n*   To determine the IUPAC name, we must find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    1.  Chain A (following the ethyl branch): C=C-$CH_2$-$CH_3$. This chain has 4 carbons (a butene). This chain has one large substituent at C2: an isopropyl group. Name: 2-isopropyl-1-butene.\n    2.  Chain B (following one branch of the isopropyl group): C=C-CH-$CH_3$. This chain also has 4 carbons (a butene). This chain has two substituents: an ethyl group at C2 and a methyl group at C3. Name: 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\n*   According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, if two chains of equal length are possible, we must choose the one with the greater number of substituents.\n*   Chain A has one substituent, while Chain B has two. Therefore, the correct parent chain is B.\n*   The final IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Check**\n*   Let's confirm the proposed structure (2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene) is consistent with the NMR data.\n    *   The structure has exactly 6 unique carbon environments because the two methyl groups attached to C3 are chemically equivalent due to free rotation.\n    *   The predicted signals and multiplicities are: 1 singlet (quaternary C2), 2 triplets (vinylic C1 and ethyl $CH_2$), 1 doublet (methine C3), and 2 quartets (one for the two equivalent methyls on C3, and one for the ethyl methyl). This perfectly matches the six signals with the given multiplicities.\n    *   The chemical shifts are also consistent: 145(s) for the substituted vinylic C2, 112(t) for the terminal vinylic C1, 48(t) for the allylic ethyl $CH_2$, 27(d) for the allylic methine CH, and 22/21(q) for the two types of methyl groups.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene>>>"
