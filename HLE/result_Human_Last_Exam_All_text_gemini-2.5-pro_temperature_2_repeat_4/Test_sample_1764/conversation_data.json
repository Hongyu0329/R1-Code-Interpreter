    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** A finite set of points $X$ with a distance function $d(x,y)$ that satisfies:\n    1.  $d(x, y) \\ge 0$ (non-negativity)\n    2.  $d(x, y) = 0 \\iff x = y$ (identity of indiscernibles)\n    3.  $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ (symmetry)\n    4.  $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ (Strong Triangle Inequality or Ultrametric Inequality).\n*   **Banach Space (B):** A complete normed vector space over a field (typically $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$). The distance between two vectors $u, v \\in B$ is given by the norm of their difference, $\\|u-v\\|$. The cardinality of $B$ is given as $K$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding if it preserves distances. That is, for every pair of points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the following equality must hold:\n    $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n*   **The Question:** We are asked for the *smallest possible number* of such isometric embeddings. This implies we need to find the minimum value of this number by considering all possible choices for the finite ultrametric space $X$ and the Banach space $B$.\n\n**2. Exploring the Number of Embeddings**\n\nLet's denote the number of isometric embeddings from $X$ into $B$ as $N(X, B)$. The question asks for $\\min_{X,B} N(X,B)$.\n\n**Step 2a: Can the number of embeddings be 0?**\nWe need to determine if an isometric embedding always exists. A famous result in metric geometry, the **Kuratowski embedding**, states that any metric space $(M,d)$ can be isometrically embedded into a Banach space. Specifically, for a finite space $X$, we can embed it into the space $\\ell_\\infty(X)$ of bounded real-valued functions on $X$, with the sup norm. Since $X$ is finite with $|X|=n$, this space is isometrically isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the maximum norm $\\|v\\|_\\infty = \\max_{i=1...n} |v_i|$. This is a Banach space.\nTherefore, for any given finite ultrametric space $X$, we can always find at least one Banach space $B$ (namely $\\ell_\\infty(X)$) into which $X$ can be isometrically embedded. This means $N(X,B)$ is never zero for a suitable choice of $B$. Thus, the minimum number must be at least 1.\n\n**Step 2b: Can the number of embeddings be infinite?**\nLet's assume we have found one isometric embedding, $f: X \\to B$. Let's consider how we can construct new embeddings from this one.\nLet $v_0$ be any vector in the Banach space $B$. Define a new function $f_{v_0}: X \\to B$ by translation:\n$f_{v_0}(x) = f(x) + v_0$\nLet's check if $f_{v_0}$ is also an isometric embedding:\n$\\|f_{v_0}(x_1) - f_{v_0}(x_2)\\| = \\|(f(x_1) + v_0) - (f(x_2) + v_0)\\| = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|$\nSince $f$ is an isometric embedding, this is equal to $d(x_1, x_2)$. So, $f_{v_0}$ is also an isometric embedding.\nIf $v_0 \\neq v_1$, then the functions $f_{v_0}$ and $f_{v_1}$ are distinct. This means that the number of isometric embeddings is at least the cardinality of the Banach space $B$.\n\nNow, we need to consider the cardinality of $B$.\n*   If $X$ contains more than one point (i.e., $|X| > 1$), then there exist $x_1, x_2 \\in X$ with $d(x_1, x_2) > 0$. For an embedding $f:X \\to B$, we must have $\\|f(x_1)-f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2) > 0$. This implies that the vector $f(x_1)-f(x_2)$ is not the zero vector, which means the Banach space $B$ cannot be the trivial space $\\{0\\}$.\n*   Any non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ has an infinite number of elements (its cardinality is at least that of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$).\n*   Therefore, if $|X|>1$, any Banach space $B$ that can host an isometric embedding of $X$ must be infinite. This implies that there are infinitely many isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$.\n\n**Step 2c: Can the number of embeddings be a finite number greater than 1? Can it be exactly 1?**\nFrom the analysis above, the number of embeddings seems to be either infinite or dependent on the cardinality of $B$. The only way to get a finite number of embeddings is if the Banach space $B$ itself is finite.\nA Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ is finite if and only if it is the zero-dimensional space, $B = \\{0\\}$.\nLet's see if we can use this trivial Banach space.\nFor $B = \\{0\\}$, its cardinality is $K=1$. An isometric embedding must map $X$ to $\\{0\\}$. So, $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in X$.\nThe condition for this map to be an isometry is:\n$\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = \\|0 - 0\\| = 0$ must be equal to $d(x_1, x_2)$ for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$.\nThis is only possible if $d(x_1, x_2) = 0$ for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, which means that $X$ can contain only one point.\n\n**3. Synthesizing the final answer**\n\nLet's find the minimum by considering all possible choices of $X$ and $B$:\n\n*   **Case 1:** $X$ has more than one point ($|X| > 1$). As shown in Step 2b, any embedding of $X$ must be into a non-trivial, and therefore infinite, Banach space $B$. The number of embeddings $N(X,B)$ will be infinite.\n\n*   **Case 2:** $X$ has exactly one point ($|X| = 1$). Let $X=\\{p\\}$. The ultrametric distance condition is trivially satisfied ($d(p,p)=0$). We need to find an isometric embedding $f:\\{p\\} \\to B$. Since there are no distinct pairs of points in $X$, the distance-preserving condition is vacuously true for any function $f$. Thus, any function from $\\{p\\}$ to $B$ is an isometric embedding. The number of such functions is simply the number of points in $B$, which is its cardinality $K$.\n\nNow, to find the *smallest possible number*, we are free to choose both $X$ and $B$. Let's choose the pair $(X,B)$ that minimizes the number of embeddings.\nBased on our analysis, we should choose $X$ to have a single point, $X=\\{p\\}$. This makes the number of embeddings equal to the cardinality of $B$. To minimize this number, we should choose the Banach space $B$ with the smallest possible cardinality. The smallest possible Banach space is the trivial space $B = \\{0\\}$, which consists of only the zero vector. Its norm is $\\|0\\|=0$, and it is complete. Its cardinality is 1.\n\nFor this choice, $X=\\{p\\}$ and $B=\\{0\\}$, the number of isometric embeddings is the cardinality of $B$, which is 1. (The only embedding is the function $f(p)=0$).\n\nSince we established in Step 2a that the number of embeddings must be at least 1, and we have found a specific case where the number is exactly 1, the smallest possible number is 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The Scope of \"Smallest Possible\":** The question asks for the minimum over all possible pairs of $(X, B)$, not for a fixed $X$ or $B$. This allows us to select the most trivial cases.\n2.  **Existence of an Embedding:** It's crucial to confirm that an embedding is always possible (for a suitable $B$), ensuring the minimum is not 0.\n3.  **Trivial Spaces:** The existence of the trivial one-point ultrametric space and the trivial zero-vector Banach space is key to the solution.\n4.  **Cardinality of Banach Spaces:** A non-trivial Banach space (over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$) is always infinite, which leads to an infinite number of embeddings via translation.\n5.  **The \"Ultrametric\" Condition:** While the ultrametric property defines the space $X$, the final conclusion that the minimum number of embeddings is 1 holds even if $X$ were just a general finite metric space. The argument does not specifically leverage the ultrametric inequality beyond ensuring that $X$ is a metric space.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe number of isometric embeddings depends on the choice of $X$ and $B$.\n*   If $|X|>1$, the number is infinite.\n*   If $|X|=1$, the number is equal to the cardinality of $B$.\nTo find the minimum possible number, we can choose $|X|=1$ and choose $B$ to be the smallest possible Banach space, $B=\\{0\\}$. In this case, the number of embeddings is 1. Since the number cannot be less than 1, this is the minimum.\n\n<<<1>>>"
