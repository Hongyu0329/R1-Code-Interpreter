    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Key Terms**\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** A collection of 128 points (vertices) and some lines (edges) connecting pairs of these points.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices in a graph where every vertex in the subset is connected to every other vertex in the subset. A clique of size `k` is a complete graph, denoted `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** Given a subset of vertices `W`, the induced subgraph `G[W]` consists of the vertices in `W` and *all* the edges from the original graph that have both endpoints in `W`.\n*   **Clique as an Induced Subgraph:** For a set of `k` vertices to form an induced `K_k`, it must be a clique, and there can be no \"missing\" edges between them in the original graph. This is the standard definition of a clique in a graph. So, \"the size of a clique in G\" and \"the size of an induced complete subgraph of G\" mean the same thing.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the maximum possible number of *different values of k* for which a single graph `G` on 128 vertices can have an induced `K_k`.\n\n**2. Relate the Set of Induced Clique Sizes to a Simpler Property**\n\nLet `G` be any graph on `n=128` vertices.\nLet `S(G)` be the set of all possible integers `k` such that `G` contains an induced clique of size `k`. We want to maximize the size of this set, `|S(G)|`.\n\nLet `\\omega(G)` be the clique number of `G`, which is the size of the largest clique in `G`. This means there exists a set of `\\omega(G)` vertices in `G` that form a clique. Let's call this set of vertices `W_max`.\n\n*   By definition, the subgraph induced by `W_max` is a `K_{\\omega(G)}`. This means `\\omega(G)` is one of the possible clique sizes, so `\\omega(G) \\in S(G)`.\n*   Now, consider any integer `k` where `1 \\le k \\le \\omega(G)`. Can we always find an induced clique of size `k`?\n*   Yes. We can simply take any subset of `k` vertices from `W_max`. Let's call this subset `W_k`. Since every vertex in `W_max` is connected to every other vertex in `W_max`, the same must be true for the subset `W_k`.\n*   Therefore, the subgraph induced by `W_k` is a `K_k`. This shows that `k \\in S(G)`.\n*   Since this is true for any `k` from 1 to `\\omega(G)`, the set `S(G)` must contain all integers in this range. That is, `{1, 2, 3, ..., \\omega(G)} \\subseteq S(G)`.\n*   By definition, `\\omega(G)` is the size of the *maximum* clique. So, there can be no clique of a size larger than `\\omega(G)`. This means no integer greater than `\\omega(G)` can be in `S(G)`.\n*   Combining these facts, we find that for any graph `G`, the set of its induced clique sizes is exactly `S(G) = {1, 2, 3, ..., \\omega(G)}`.\n\n**3. Reformulate the Problem**\n\nThe number of different clique sizes is `|S(G)|`, which we've just shown is equal to `\\omega(G)`.\nSo, the problem \"find the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\" is equivalent to the problem \"find the maximum possible value of `\\omega(G)` for a graph on 128 vertices\".\n\n**4. Solve the Reformulated Problem**\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible clique number `\\omega(G)` for a graph `G` with `n=128` vertices.\n\n*   A clique is a subset of the graph's vertices. The size of a subset cannot be larger than the size of the entire set.\n*   Therefore, the maximum size of a clique in a graph on 128 vertices cannot be greater than 128. So, `\\omega(G) \\le 128`.\n\n**5. Show that the Maximum is Achievable**\n\nWe must show that it is possible to construct a graph `G` on 128 vertices that actually has a clique number of 128.\n\n*   Consider the **complete graph** `K_{128}`. This is a graph on 128 vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n*   In this graph, the set of all 128 vertices forms a clique.\n*   The size of this clique is 128. This is the largest possible clique, so `\\omega(K_{128}) = 128`.\n*   For this graph `K_{128}`, the set of induced clique sizes is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`. The number of different sizes is 128.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of different clique sizes for any graph on 128 vertices is at most 128. The complete graph `K_{128}` achieves this maximum. Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{128}$."
