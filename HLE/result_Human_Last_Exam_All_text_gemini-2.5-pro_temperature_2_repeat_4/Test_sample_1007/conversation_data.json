    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step:\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\nThe question asks to identify which of the given classical ballet steps has the same ending leg position as its starting leg position. This means the configuration of the feet (e.g., which foot is in front in fifth position) must be identical at the beginning and the end of the step.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** The step begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a vertical jump from two feet. The name \"six\" refers to the six movements of the legs in the air. An *entrechat* with an even number (like two, four, six, eight) starts from two feet and lands on two feet. For an *entrechat six*, the legs open and close (beat) three times in the air. The sequence of crossings ensures that the legs return to their original configuration upon landing.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the exact same fifth position from which they started (e.g., right foot still in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Even-numbered *entrechats* (*quatre*, *six*) end in the same position they start. Odd-numbered *entrechats* (*trois*, *cinq*) end on one foot.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:**\n        *   *Échappé*: The dancer jumps from the closed fifth position to an open second position.\n        *   *Battu*: The dancer springs up from second position and \"beats\" the legs together in the air.\n        *   *Changé*: The word *changé* means \"changed.\" This indicates that the feet will swap their front/back placement upon landing.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The term *changé* is the key giveaway that the position changes.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Often begins in fifth position. Let's assume the right foot is in front. A common *assemblé* is an *assemblé dessus* (over), where the back foot initiates the movement.\n    *   **Execution:** The back foot (left foot) slides out to the side. The dancer jumps off the standing (right) foot, bringing both legs together (\"assembling\" them) in the air before landing.\n    *   **Ending Position:** In an *assemblé dessus*, the leg that started in the back (the left foot) closes in the front. Therefore, the dancer lands in fifth position with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While there are many types of *assemblé*, the most standard forms involve a change of feet. The purpose is often to switch the working leg.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** *Glissade* is a gliding step. The back foot (left foot) glides out to the side, takes the weight, and the front foot (right foot) is brought in to close. The word *derrière* means \"behind,\" specifying that the front foot will close in the back.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The original front foot (right foot) is now in the back, and the original back foot (left foot) is now in the front. The dancer ends in fifth position with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The directional term (*derrière*) dictates how the feet change. A *glissade* is fundamentally a traveling and linking step that often facilitates a change of feet.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step resembling a *pas de chat* but with each leg performing a *rond de jambe en l'air* (a circular movement) during the jump. Like a *pas de chat*, it is a jump from one foot to the other. The dancer jumps, the leading leg performs its circle, followed by the second leg, landing first on the leading foot and then closing the second foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Because it's a jump that travels from one leg to the other, the feet necessarily change their position upon landing. If starting with the right foot in front, the dancer typically lands with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This step is a embellishment of a step (*pas de chat*) that inherently involves changing feet.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nBy analyzing each step, we can conclude the following:\n*   **Entrechat six:** Starting position = Ending position.\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** Starting position ≠ Ending position.\n*   **Assemblé:** Starting position ≠ Ending position.\n*   **Glissade derrière:** Starting position ≠ Ending position.\n*   **Gargouillade:** Starting position ≠ Ending position.\n\nThe only step that ends in the same leg position it started from is the Entrechat six.\n\n<<<A>>>"
