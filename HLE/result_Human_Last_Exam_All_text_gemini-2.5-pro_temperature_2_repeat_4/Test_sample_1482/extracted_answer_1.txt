The mathematical formulation that characterizes the upper bound of a vertical cross-section of a Gaussian-based Interval Type-3 Membership Function (IT3 MF) is given by:

`overline{μ}_Ã(x, u) = exp( - ( (u - overline{μ}(x))^2 / (2 * σ_u(x)^2) ) )`

Where:
- `x` is the fixed primary input variable.
- `u` is the secondary input variable, representing the primary membership grade.
- `overline{μ}_Ã(x, u)` is the Upper Membership Function (UMF) of the vertical cross-section's Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU).
- `overline{μ}(x)` is the UMF of the primary FOU of the IT3 MF, which serves as the mean (center) of the Gaussian in the vertical dimension.
- `σ_u(x)` is the standard deviation parameter that controls the spread of the uncertainty in the vertical (`u`) dimension at point `x`.

The lower bound is typically defined as a scaled version of the upper bound, `underline{μ}_Ã(x, u) = α * overline{μ}_Ã(x, u)`, for `α ∈ [0, 1]`.
