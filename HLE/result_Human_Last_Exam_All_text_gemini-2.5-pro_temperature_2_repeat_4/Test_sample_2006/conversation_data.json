    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Title and Main Question\nThe user states that the title, \"The Bays\", is a question. This is a piece of wordplay. Phonetically, \"The Bays\" sounds like \"The B's\". Therefore, the underlying question is, \"What are the B's?\". The answer will be a set of words that all start with the letter 'B', which are hidden in the haiku that follows.\n\n### Step 2: Decode the Haiku, Line by Line\nThe haiku provides clues for three different 'B' words. The theme seems to be related to wind or the movement of air.\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** We need to find a 'B' word that means \"tempest\" or is a type of tempest. A tempest is a violent, windy storm.\n    *   **Analysis:** A strong, sudden rush of wind characteristic of a tempest is often called a **BLAST**. This fits the description perfectly.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This line has two parts: a mathematical clue (\"Twice fifteen\") and a descriptive phrase (\"brings winds of change\"). Both parts must be considered to find the answer.\n    *   **Analysis:** \"Twice fifteen\" equals thirty (2 x 15 = 30). In the context of wind, numbers often relate to a measurement scale. The Beaufort wind scale is a common system for measuring wind speed. A wind of 30 mph (or 26 knots, which is also in the range) is classified as a \"Strong **BREEZE**\". The phrase \"winds of change\" poetically describes the arrival of this noticeable wind.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The words \"divine\" and \"yields\" are key. \"Divine\" suggests something related to a god or spirituality, and \"yields\" can mean to produce, give forth, or exhale.\n    *   **Analysis:** Across many religions and creation stories, a divine being \"yields\" or gives life by breathing into a creation. This divine exhalation is **BREATH**. The act of breathing is a movement of air, fitting the theme established by the other lines.\n\n### Step 3: Compile and Order the Answers\nThe three 'B' words we have found are BLAST, BREEZE, and BREATH.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The final instruction is to provide the answer \"in alphabetical order\".\n*   **Analysis:** We must arrange the three words alphabetically.\n    1.  **BLAST** (BL...)\n    2.  **BREATH** (BRE**A**...)\n    3.  **BREEZE** (BRE**E**...)\n\nThe correct alphabetical order is BLAST, BREATH, BREEZE.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nCombining the decoded clues and following all instructions, the final answer is the alphabetically sorted list of the three 'B' words found in the haiku.\n\n<<<Blast, Breath, Breeze>>>"
