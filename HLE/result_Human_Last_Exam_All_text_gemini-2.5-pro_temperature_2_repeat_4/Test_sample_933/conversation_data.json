    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be produced efficiently. The keywords here are \"coldest temperature\" and \"efficiently.\" \"Efficiently\" implies a method that produces a good yield in a reasonable amount of time under practical laboratory or industrial conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Synthesis Methods for XeF4**\nThe most common and straightforward method for preparing xenon fluorides is the direct reaction between xenon (Xe) gas and fluorine (F2) gas. The general reaction is:\nXe(g) + nF2(g) → XeF(2n)(s)\n\nThe specific product formed (XeF2, XeF4, or XeF6) depends critically on the reaction conditions, namely:\n*   Temperature\n*   Pressure\n*   Molar ratio of the reactants (Xe:F2)\n\nOther methods like photochemical synthesis (using UV light) or electric discharge exist, but the direct thermal reaction is the most common and is generally considered the benchmark for \"efficient\" synthesis of a pure product.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Conditions for XeF4 Synthesis**\nFor the specific synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4), the reaction is:\nXe(g) + 2F2(g) → XeF4(s)\n\nTo favor the formation of XeF4 over other xenon fluorides, specific conditions are required:\n*   **Reactant Ratio:** A stoichiometric excess of fluorine is used. A molar ratio of Xe to F2 of approximately 1:5 is typical.\n*   **Pressure:** The reaction is usually carried out at elevated pressures, often around 6 atmospheres.\n*   **Temperature:** The reaction requires significant thermal energy to initiate and proceed at a practical rate. The most widely cited and effective temperature for this synthesis is **400 °C**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Temperature Choices**\nLet's consider each option in the context of the direct thermal synthesis of XeF4:\n\n*   **A. 600 °C:** At this high temperature, the reaction would certainly proceed. However, it's not the *coldest* efficient temperature. Furthermore, higher temperatures, especially with an excess of fluorine, begin to favor the formation of the more highly fluorinated compound, Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6).\n*   **B. 400 °C:** This is the standard, textbook temperature for the efficient laboratory preparation of XeF4. At 400 °C, with the correct reactant ratio (Xe:F2 ≈ 1:5) and pressure, the reaction proceeds reliably to give a good yield of XeF4. This temperature provides enough energy to overcome the activation energy for the reaction to be efficient.\n*   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate between xenon and fluorine is extremely slow. While a minuscule amount of product might form over a very long period, this process cannot be described as \"efficient.\" The thermal energy is generally insufficient for a practical synthesis.\n*   **D. 78 °C, E. 0 °C, F. -78 °C:** These temperatures are far too low to provide the necessary activation energy for the direct thermal reaction between xenon and fluorine. No significant or efficient reaction would occur. While non-thermal methods like electric discharge might work at low temperatures, they are often difficult to control and don't efficiently produce a single product like XeF4.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Coldest Efficient Temperature**\nBased on the standard and most reliable method, 400 °C is the established temperature for efficiently producing XeF4. While the reaction might work at slightly lower temperatures with very long reaction times, it would cease to be \"efficient.\" Among the given choices, 400 °C is the lowest temperature at which the synthesis is commonly and successfully performed.\n\n<<<B>>>"
