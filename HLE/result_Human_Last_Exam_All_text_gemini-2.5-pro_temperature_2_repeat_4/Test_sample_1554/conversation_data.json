    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Philosophical School:** Lviv-Warsaw School. This narrows the search to a specific group of Polish philosophers active mainly between the 1920s and 1930s, known for their focus on logic, semantics, and analytical rigor.\n    *   **Core Concept:** \"Hallmark\" (or characteristic, criterion, indicator; in Polish, *cecha*).\n    *   **The Decomposition:** The question specifies a particular way of analyzing \"hallmark\"—breaking it down into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n    *   **Objective:** Identify the specific philosopher from that school who proposed this distinction.\n\n2.  **List Key Members of the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder)\n    *   Stanisław Leśniewski\n    *   Jan Łukasiewicz\n    *   Alfred Tarski\n    *   Tadeusz Kotarbiński\n    *   Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conceptual Distinction:**\n    *   **Symptom:** This term suggests a *natural* sign or indicator. There is a causal or natural correlation between the symptom and what it indicates. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire. A fever is a symptom of an illness. The connection exists independently of human agreement.\n    *   **Signal:** This term suggests a *conventional* or *artificial* sign. The connection between the signal and its meaning is established by a rule, agreement, or stipulation. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop. A word is a signal for an object or concept.\n\n4.  **Match the Distinction to the Philosopher:**\n    *   We need to find which of the philosophers listed above engaged in this type of epistemological or semiotic analysis. While many were logicians, some focused on broader epistemological and linguistic questions.\n    *   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is the most prominent figure in the Lviv-Warsaw School known for his work in epistemology, philosophy of language, and semiotics.\n    *   In his analysis of knowledge and meaning, Ajdukiewicz made precisely this distinction. He used it to clarify how we come to know things. We can infer a state of affairs from a **symptom** because of a known natural law or causal connection. We can understand a state of affairs from a **signal** because we know the convention or rule that governs its meaning.\n    *   This distinction was a key tool in his analytical method, helping to separate empirical knowledge (often based on symptoms) from knowledge based on convention or definition (based on signals).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The decomposition of the concept of a hallmark (indicator) into the categories of symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) is a specific and well-known contribution of the Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:** Based on the step-by-step analysis, the philosopher responsible for this conceptual decomposition is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
