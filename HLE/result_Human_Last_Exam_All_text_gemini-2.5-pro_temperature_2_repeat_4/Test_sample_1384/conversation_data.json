    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $N = e^{-7^{13}}$, we will analyze the number by expressing it in scientific notation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Express the number in scientific notation.**\nAny positive number $N$ can be written in scientific notation as $N = A \\times 10^{-k}$, where $1 \\le A < 10$ and $k$ is an integer. The first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $N$ are the first two digits of $A$.\n\n**Step 2: Use logarithms to find A and k.**\nWe take the base-10 logarithm of $N$:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(A \\times 10^{-k}) = \\log_{10}(A) + \\log_{10}(10^{-k}) = \\log_{10}(A) - k$.\n\nSince $1 \\le A < 10$, we have $0 \\le \\log_{10}(A) < 1$. Thus, $\\log_{10}(A)$ is the mantissa (the fractional part) of $\\log_{10}(N)$, and $-k$ is the characteristic (the integer part).\n\nNow, let's compute $\\log_{10}(N)$ from the original expression:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the value of the exponent.**\nFirst, we need to compute the exact value of $7^{13}$:\n$7^1 = 7$\n$7^2 = 49$\n$7^4 = 49^2 = 2401$\n$7^8 = 2401^2 = 5,764,801$\n$7^{12} = 7^8 \\times 7^4 = 5,764,801 \\times 2401 = 13,841,287,201$\n$7^{13} = 7^{12} \\times 7 = 13,841,287,201 \\times 7 = 96,889,010,407$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the product.**\nNext, we need the value of $\\log_{10}(e)$. We know that $\\log_{10}(e) = \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}$. Using a precise value:\n$\\log_{10}(e) \\approx 0.434294481903...$\n\nNow we multiply this by $7^{13}$:\nLet $Y = 7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e) = 96,889,010,407 \\times 0.434294481903...$\nThis calculation requires high precision. Using a calculator, we find:\n$Y \\approx 42,078,864,778.018928014$\n\n**Step 5: Find the characteristic and mantissa.**\nWe have $\\log_{10}(N) = -Y = -42,078,864,778.018928014$.\nTo find the mantissa, we need to express this in the form `integer + positive fraction`.\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -42,078,864,778 - 0.018928014$\nWe add and subtract 1:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = (-42,078,864,778 - 1) + (1 - 0.018928014)$\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -42,078,864,779 + 0.981071986$\n\nFrom this, we can identify the characteristic and the mantissa:\nCharacteristic: $-k = -42,078,864,779 \\implies k = 42,078,864,779$. This means the first non-zero digit is at the $42,078,864,779$-th decimal place.\nMantissa: $\\log_{10}(A) = 0.981071986...$\n\n**Step 6: Determine the value of A.**\nWe need to find $A = 10^{0.981071986...}$. To find the first two digits of $A$, we can compare its logarithm with the logarithms of other numbers.\n\nWe know:\n$\\log_{10}(9) = 2 \\log_{10}(3) \\approx 2 \\times 0.47712 = 0.95424$\n$\\log_{10}(10) = 1$\nSince $0.95424 < 0.98107... < 1$, the value of $A$ is between 9 and 10. So, the first non-zero digit is 9.\n\nTo find the second digit, we test values like 9.1, 9.2, ..., 9.9. Let's check 9.5 and 9.6:\n*   $\\log_{10}(9.5) = \\log_{10}(19/2) = \\log_{10}(19) - \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 1.27875 - 0.30103 = 0.97772$\n*   $\\log_{10}(9.6) = \\log_{10}(96/10) = \\log_{10}(2^5 \\times 3) - 1 = 5\\log_{10}(2) + \\log_{10}(3) - 1$\n    $\\log_{10}(9.6) \\approx 5 \\times (0.30103) + 0.47712 - 1 = 1.50515 + 0.47712 - 1 = 0.98227$\n\nNow we compare our mantissa with these values:\n$\\log_{10}(9.5) \\approx 0.97772$\nOur mantissa: $M = 0.98107...$\n$\\log_{10}(9.6) \\approx 0.98227$\n\nWe see that $0.97772 < 0.98107... < 0.98227$.\nThis implies $\\log_{10}(9.5) < \\log_{10}(A) < \\log_{10}(9.6)$.\nTherefore, $9.5 < A < 9.6$.\n\nThis means the decimal representation of A starts with $9.5...$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe first non-zero digit of $e^{-7^{13}}$ is the first digit of $A$, which is 9.\nThe second non-zero digit of $e^{-7^{13}}$ is the second digit of $A$, which is 5.\nThus, the first two non-zero digits are 95."
