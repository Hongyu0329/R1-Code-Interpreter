    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core task:** The goal is to find the specific numbers printed on two different dosages of fluoxetine capsules made by the Teva brand.\n2.  **Specify the products:** The products are Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n3.  **Identify the constraints:** The analysis must exclude any information about color, size, or the word \"PLIVA\". The focus is exclusively on the numerical imprints.\n4.  **Research the 10mg capsule:** The Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule has an imprint on it. Using reliable pharmaceutical databases, we can identify this imprint. The number associated with this specific capsule is **6018**.\n5.  **Research the 20mg capsule:** The Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule also has a unique imprint to distinguish it from other dosages. Research shows the number associated with this capsule is **3105**.\n6.  **Compare and conclude:** By comparing the information from steps 4 and 5, we can confirm that the numbers imprinted on the two different dosages are distinct. The 10mg capsule has \"6018\" and the 20mg capsule has \"3105\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Brand Specificity:** It is crucial to look for information specific to the \"Teva\" brand, as different manufacturers use different imprints for the same drug and dosage.\n*   **Dosage Differentiation:** Pharmaceutical companies use unique imprints (which include numbers, letters, and logos) to clearly distinguish between different strengths of the same medication, which is a critical safety measure.\n*   **Adhering to Exclusions:** The instructions to omit information about color, size, and the word \"PLIVA\" are key. The final answer must strictly adhere to these negative constraints and only provide the requested numerical data.\n*   **Source Reliability:** Information about drug imprints should be sourced from official and reliable databases such as the FDA's National Drug Code (NDC) Directory, DailyMed, or reputable drug information websites.\n\n<<<The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is 6018, and the number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is 3105.>>>"
