The reason a functional MRI coil may not show a resonance when tested with a VNA and loop probe is due to intentional design features. The most common reasons are: 1) **Active Decoupling Circuitry**, where the coil is in a default non-resonant "off" state for safety and must be electrically activated to resonate; 2) **Gradiometer Coil Geometry** (like a figure-8 coil), which is designed to reject the uniform magnetic field from the test probe, thus preventing coupling; and 3) **Preamplifier Damping**, where a low-impedance preamplifier connected to the coil drastically lowers its Q-factor, making the resonance peak too broad and shallow to detect with this method.
