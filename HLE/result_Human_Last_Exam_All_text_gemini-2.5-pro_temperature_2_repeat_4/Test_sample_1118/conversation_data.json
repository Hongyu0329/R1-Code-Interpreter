    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n    *   **Year:** 1933\n    *   **Subject:** A self-portrait\n    *   **Context:** Painted after escaping the Gestapo (the Nazi secret police).\n    *   **Inquiry:** What object is he holding in his hand, and what does it symbolize? The question explicitly states it is a \"symbol of resistance.\"\n\n2.  **Historical Context:** 1933 was the year Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. They quickly began to suppress political opposition and artistic expression that did not align with their ideology. Artists like Curt Querner, associated with the \"New Objectivity\" movement and holding communist sympathies, were deemed \"degenerate\" and were persecuted. Being arrested by and escaping from Nazi authorities (specifically the SA, an early Nazi paramilitary group) was a life-threatening event.\n\n3.  **Visual Analysis of the Artwork:** The painting, \"Selbstbildnis mit Spachtel\" (Self-Portrait with Spatula), shows Querner with an intense, grim, and defiant expression. He stares directly at the viewer, unbowed. In his right hand, he firmly grips a tool of his trade.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Object:** The object he is holding is a palette knife, also known as a painting spatula. This is a tool used by painters to mix paints on a palette or to apply thick layers of paint (impasto) onto the canvas.\n\n5.  **Interpreting the Symbolism:**\n    *   Given the context of his recent escape from persecution, the palette knife is not merely a tool.\n    *   He holds it upright and firmly, much like one would hold a dagger or a small weapon.\n    *   This gesture transforms the painter's tool into a symbol of his weapon of choice: his art.\n    *   By painting this self-portrait and holding the palette knife so defiantly, Querner is making a powerful statement. He declares his identity as an artist and his intention to continue his work, using his art as a form of resistance against the oppressive regime that sought to silence him. The act of painting itself becomes an act of defiance.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **The Tool's Dual Meaning:** It is essential to recognize that the object is a common painter's tool, but its meaning is elevated to a symbol because of the specific historical context and the artist's confrontational pose.\n*   **Artist's Intent:** Querner isn't portraying himself as a defeated victim but as a resistor. His defiant gaze combined with the \"weaponized\" tool is key to this interpretation.\n*   **Art as Resistance:** The central theme is the power of art to resist oppression. His chosen \"weapon\" is the very tool that enables his art.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter escaping the Nazi authorities in 1933, Curt Querner painted a self-portrait where he holds a palette knife. This object, a tool of his profession, symbolizes his unbroken spirit and his commitment to using his art as his weapon of resistance against the oppressive regime.\n\n<<<A palette knife (or painting spatula)>>>"
