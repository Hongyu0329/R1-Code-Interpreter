The equations for the absorption cross-section $\sigma(\omega)$ are:

a) **No interaction between molecules:**
The cross-section is the incoherent sum of individual molecular absorptions. It scales linearly with the number of molecules, $N$.

$\sigma^{(a)}(\omega) = N \frac{4\pi \omega}{c \epsilon_0 \hbar} |\hat{\mathbf{e}} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{eg}|^2 \delta(\omega - \omega_{eg})$

where $\mathbf{d}_{eg}$ and $\omega_{eg}$ are the transition dipole moment and frequency of a single molecule, and $\hat{\mathbf{e}}$ is the light polarization vector.

b) **Near-neighbor interaction considered:**
The interaction creates delocalized exciton states. A selection rule dictates that only the $k=0$ exciton state is optically active, concentrating the entire oscillator strength of the chain into a single transition.

$\sigma^{(b)}(\omega) = N \frac{4\pi \omega}{c \epsilon_0 \hbar} |\hat{\mathbf{e}} \cdot \mathbf{d}_{eg}|^2 \delta(\omega - (\omega_{eg} + \Delta\omega))$

where the absorption frequency is shifted by $\Delta\omega = (D+2J)/\hbar$. The shift depends on the near-neighbor interaction coupling constant $J$ and a term $D$ representing the interaction of an excited molecule with its ground-state neighbors.
