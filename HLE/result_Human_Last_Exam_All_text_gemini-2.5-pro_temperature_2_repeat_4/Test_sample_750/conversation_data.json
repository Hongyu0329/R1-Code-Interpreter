    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the equation using the definition of complex exponentiation**\n\nThe term $i^z$ on the right-hand side is a multi-valued complex exponentiation. The general definition is $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$, where $\\log a$ is the multi-valued complex logarithm.\nFor $a=i$, its logarithm is given by:\n$\\log i = \\log|i| + i \\arg(i) = \\ln(1) + i (\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi)$ for any integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's denote $C_n = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi$. Then $\\log i = iC_n$.\nThe original equation, $z \\cdot i = i^z$, is satisfied if for a given $z$, there exists an integer $n$ such that:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\log i} = e^{z(iC_n)} = e^{izC_n}$\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the equation by substitution**\n\nTo solve for $z$, we can introduce a substitution to simplify the equation $zi = e^{izC_n}$.\nLet $w = izC_n$. Then $z = \\frac{w}{iC_n}$.\nSubstituting this into the equation:\n$(\\frac{w}{iC_n})i = e^w$\n$\\frac{w}{C_n} = e^w$\nThis can be rearranged into a form that is solvable by the Lambert W function.\n$w = C_n e^w$\n$w e^{-w} = C_n$\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the substituted variable using the Lambert W function**\n\nThe equation $we^{-w}=C_n$ is a standard form for the Lambert W function. We can solve for $w$ by making another substitution. Let $u = -w$.\n$(-u)e^u = C_n \\implies ue^u = -C_n$.\nBy definition, the solutions for $u$ are given by the Lambert W function, which is denoted by $W$. Since the Lambert W function is multi-valued, its branches are indexed by an integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. So, the solutions for $u$ are:\n$u = W_k(-C_n)$ for any integer $k$.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute back to find the solutions for z**\n\nNow, we substitute back to find $z$:\n$u = -w = -(izC_n)$\n$z = \\frac{-u}{iC_n} = \\frac{-W_k(-C_n)}{iC_n} = i \\frac{W_k(-C_n)}{C_n}$\n\n**Step 5: Write the general formula for all solutions**\n\nThe set of all solutions for $z$ is generated by considering all possible integer values for $n$ (from the logarithm) and $k$ (from the Lambert W function branches).\nSubstituting $C_n = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi$, the general form of the solution is:\n$z_{n,k} = i\\frac{W_k(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi))}{(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi)}$ for any integers $n, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the types of solutions from the general formula**\n\nThis general formula encompasses all solutions, which can be categorized as follows:\n\n1.  **Real Solutions:**\n    We test for simple real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n    -   For $z=1$: The equation becomes $i = i^1$. This holds if we can choose a value of $\\log i$ such that $i=e^{1 \\cdot \\log i}$. $e^{\\log i}=i$ is true by definition for any branch of the logarithm. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n    -   For $z=-1$: The equation is $-i=i^{-1}$. This holds if $-i = e^{-1 \\cdot \\log i} = e^{-i(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi)} = \\cos(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi)) + i \\sin(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi)) = -i$. This is also true for any branch. So, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n    These real solutions are contained within the general formula. For any $n$, there exist branches $k$ that produce $z=1$ and $z=-1$. Specifically, $W_k(-C_n) = -iC_n$ yields $z=1$ and $W_k(-C_n) = iC_n$ yields $z=-1$. We have verified in the thought process that these values satisfy the Lambert W defining equation for any $n$.\n\n2.  **Purely Imaginary Solutions:**\n    Let $z=iy$ for some $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The equation becomes $-y = e^{iy(iC_n)} = e^{-yC_n}$.\n    -   If $n \\ge 0$, then $C_n > 0$. The equation $-y = e^{-yC_n}$ has no real solutions for $y$.\n    -   If $n \\le -1$, then $C_n < 0$. For each such $n$, there is a unique real solution $y_n$ to the equation.\n    These solutions correspond to the principal branch ($k=0$) of the Lambert W function in the general formula. For $n \\le -1$, $-C_n > 0$ and $W_0(-C_n)$ is a real number, making $z_{n,0}$ purely imaginary.\n\n3.  **Other Complex Solutions:**\n    For all other pairs of integers $(n,k)$, the solution $z_{n,k}$ is a complex number with non-zero real and imaginary parts. This constitutes an infinite set of complex solutions. For example:\n    - For $n \\ge 0$ (all $k$), $W_k(-C_n)$ is always complex.\n    - For $n \\le -1$ and $k \\neq 0$, $W_k(-C_n)$ is complex.\n\nAll solutions to the equation are captured by the single unifying formula.\n\n<<<z = i\\frac{W_k(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi))}{(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2n\\pi)}, \\text{ for } n, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}>>>"
