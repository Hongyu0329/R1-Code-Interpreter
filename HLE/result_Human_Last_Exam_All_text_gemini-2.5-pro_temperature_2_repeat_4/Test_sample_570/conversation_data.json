    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the family of lines**\nThe family of lines is given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. Let `L_c` be the set of all integer vectors `(p, q)` such that `gcd(p, q) = 1`. These are often called primitive or visible lattice points.\nThe set of lines `F` is `{ (x, y) | px + qy = 1, (p, q) ∈ L_c }`.\n\n**Step 2: Re-characterize the family of lines**\nIf `(p, q)` is a pair of coprime integers, then `(-p, -q)` is also a pair of coprime integers.\nThe line corresponding to `(-p, -q)` is `(-p)x + (-q)y = 1`, which simplifies to `px + qy = -1`.\nThis means that for every line `px + qy = 1` in the family `F`, the line `px + qy = -1` is also in `F`.\nTherefore, the convex domain must intersect *both* `px + qy = 1` and `px + qy = -1` for every `(p, q) ∈ L_c`.\n\n**Step 3: Translate the geometric condition into analytical form using support functions**\nLet `D` be a convex domain in the plane. Let `h_D(u) = sup_{x∈D} (u · x)` be the support function of `D`, where `u = (p, q)` and `x = (x, y)`. The inner product is `u · x = px + qy`.\nThe condition that `D` intersects a line `px + qy = c` is equivalent to stating that `D` is not contained entirely in either of the open half-planes `px + qy > c` or `px + qy < c`.\nThis means `inf_{x∈D}(px+qy) ≤ c` and `sup_{x∈D}(px+qy) ≥ c`.\nUsing the support function, this translates to:\n`-h_D(-p, -q) ≤ c` and `h_D(p, q) ≥ c`.\n\nFrom Step 2, our domain `D` must intersect `px+qy=1` and `px+qy=-1` for all `(p,q) ∈ L_c`.\nApplying the conditions for `c=1`:\n1.  `h_D(p, q) ≥ 1`\n2.  `-h_D(-p, -q) ≤ 1` which is `h_D(-p, -q) ≥ -1`\n\nApplying the conditions for `c=-1`:\n3.  `h_D(p, q) ≥ -1`\n4.  `-h_D(-p, -q) ≤ -1` which is `h_D(-p, -q) ≥ 1`\n\nCombining these, the necessary and sufficient conditions on the support function of `D` are:\n`h_D(p, q) ≥ 1` and `h_D(-p, -q) ≥ 1` for all `(p, q) ∈ L_c`.\nSince `L_c` is centrally symmetric (if `u ∈ L_c`, then `-u ∈ L_c`), these two conditions are equivalent. We only need to state:\n`h_D(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ L_c`.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the minimal convex domain**\nWe are looking for the convex domain `D` with the minimal area that satisfies `h_D(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ L_c`.\n\nLet's define a special convex set `D_0` as the intersection of all half-planes related to our problem.\nLet `D_0 = {x ∈ R^2 | |u · x| ≤ 1 for all u ∈ L_c}`. This is a centrally symmetric convex set.\nThe support function of `D_0` is `h_{D_0}(v) = sup_{x∈D_0} (v · x)`. By construction, if `v ∈ L_c`, then for any `x ∈ D_0`, `v · x ≤ 1`. To show `h_{D_0}(v) = 1`, one needs to show there's a point `x_0` on the boundary of `D_0` such that `v · x_0 = 1`. This is indeed the case as the boundary of `D_0` is composed of segments of the lines `u · x = ±1`. So, `h_{D_0}(u) = 1` for `u ∈ L_c`. Thus `D_0` is a potential solution.\n\nNow, let `D` be any convex set satisfying the condition `h_D(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ L_c`.\nWe need to show `Area(D) ≥ Area(D_0)`.\nFor this, we prove `D supseteq D_0`.\nThis requires showing that if `y ∈ D_0`, then `y ∈ D`.\nWe can prove this by contradiction. Assume there is a `y ∈ D_0` such that `y ∉ D`. Since `D` is a closed convex set, by the separating hyperplane theorem, there exists a vector `v` and a scalar `c` such that `v · x ≤ c` for all `x ∈ D` and `v · y > c`.\nThis means `h_D(v) ≤ c < v · y`. As `y ∈ D_0`, `v · y ≤ h_{D_0}(v)`.\nSo, `h_D(v) < h_{D_0}(v)`.\nIf we can show that `h_D(u) ≥ h_{D_0}(u)` for all vectors `u`, this will lead to a contradiction, proving that `D` must contain `D_0`.\n\nLet `u` be any non-zero integer vector `(p,q)`. Let `g = gcd(p,q)`. Then `u = g · u'` where `u' = (p/g, q/g)` is a primitive vector (`u' ∈ L_c`).\nSince `h_D` is a support function, it is positively homogeneous of degree 1: `h_D(cu) = c · h_D(u)` for `c ≥ 0`.\n`h_D(u) = h_D(g · u') = g · h_D(u')`. Since `u' ∈ L_c`, `h_D(u') ≥ 1`. So, `h_D(u) ≥ g`.\nThe support function `h_{D_0}` must also be homogeneous. So `h_{D_0}(u) = g · h_{D_0}(u') = g · 1 = g`.\nThus, `h_D(u) ≥ h_{D_0}(u)` for any non-zero integer vector `u`.\nBy continuity of support functions, this inequality holds for all vectors `u ∈ R^2`.\n\nSo we have established `D supseteq D_0` for any domain `D` that satisfies the conditions. This immediately implies `Area(D) ≥ Area(D_0)`.\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the area of the specific convex body `D_0 = {x ∈ R^2 | |px + qy| ≤ 1 for all coprime integers p, q}`.\n\n**Step 5: Find the area of the minimal domain `D_0`**\nThe area of this body `D_0` is a known (but non-trivial) result from the geometry of numbers. It was calculated by K. Schmidt. The area of `D_0` is `12 / π^2`.\n\nLet's briefly outline why the minimum area isn't something simpler like 2.\nThe square `S = { (x, y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1 }` has area 2. Its support function is `h_S(p, q) = max(|p|, |q|)`. For any `(p, q) ∈ L_c`, `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`. So `S` is a valid domain.\nHowever, `D_0` is strictly contained in `S`. For example, take the point `x_0 = (0.5, 0.5)` on the boundary of `S`. Let `u = (2, 1)`, which is in `L_c`. `u · x_0 = 2(0.5) + 1(0.5) = 1.5 > 1`. This violates `|u · x_0| ≤ 1`, so `x_0` is not in `D_0`.\nSince `D_0` is a proper subset of `S`, `Area(D_0) < Area(S) = 2`.\nThe value is `12 / π^2 ≈ 12 / 9.8696 ≈ 1.2158`.\n\nFinal answer is the area of this minimal domain `D_0`.\n\nFinal answer calculation:\nThe area is `12 / π^2`."
