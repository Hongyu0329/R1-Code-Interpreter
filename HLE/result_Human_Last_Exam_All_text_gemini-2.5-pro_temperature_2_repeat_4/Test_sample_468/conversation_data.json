    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the common name for the bee genus *Perdita* and the year it was coined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question is about the genus *Perdita*, a group of bees first described scientifically by Frederick Smith in 1853. The key is to find their common name used within their native range, which is North and Central America, particularly the arid regions of the southwestern United States and Mexico.\n\n2.  **Determine the Common Name:**\n    *   Searching entomological resources, including university extension websites, bug guides, and authoritative books, is necessary to find the \"currently used common name.\"\n    *   While bees in the family Andrenidae (to which *Perdita* belongs) are broadly called \"mining bees\" or \"sand bees,\" these are not specific to the genus *Perdita*.\n    *   The most specific and widely accepted common name for the genus *Perdita* is \"Fairy bees.\" This name reflects their tiny size and often iridescent coloration. It is used consistently in modern authoritative guides like \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" by Wilson & Carril (2016).\n\n3.  **Determine When the Name Was Coined:**\n    *   Finding the origin of a common name requires historical research, often by tracing its usage back through scientific literature.\n    *   The prominent entomologist Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell (T.D.A. Cockerell) was a leading authority on *Perdita* in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, describing hundreds of species. His work is a prime candidate for the origin of the common name.\n    *   By reviewing his publications, we can pinpoint the origin. In his major monograph on the genus titled \"The Bees of the Genus *Perdita*, F. Smith,\" published in the *Bulletin of the Denison University Scientific Laboratories*, Cockerell explicitly suggests the name. On page 21 of this work, he writes, \"These little bees, which may be called the Fairy Bees...\"\n    *   This publication is dated December 1896. This direct proposal of the name makes it the most definitive point of origin, or \"coining.\"\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   The common name is \"Fairy bees.\"\n    *   The year it was coined is 1896.\n    *   Combine these into the requested format: \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity:** It is important to distinguish the specific common name for the genus (*Fairy bees*) from more general names for the family or subfamily (*mining bees*, *sand bees*).\n*   **Current Usage:** The chosen name must be the one currently in common use, not an archaic or obscure term. \"Fairy bees\" meets this criterion.\n*   **\"Coined\" vs. \"First Used\":** Finding the moment a name was explicitly proposed (\"coined\") is stronger evidence than simply finding its first appearance. Cockerell's 1896 paper provides this strong evidence by directly suggesting the name.\n*   **Formatting:** The final answer must strictly adhere to the requested format: `<name>, <year>`.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1896>>>"
