    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory and the Goal:**\n    We are considering the scalar $\\phi^4$ theory in $D = 4 - \\epsilon$ dimensions, where $\\epsilon$ is a small parameter. The goal is to find the value of the coupling constant at the non-trivial fixed point of the Renormalization Group (RG) flow. This fixed point is known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We want the expression for this fixed point coupling, denoted as $u^*$, to the leading order in $\\epsilon$.\n\n2.  **The Lagrangian and the Bare Coupling:**\n    The Euclidean Lagrangian density for a single scalar field $\\phi$ is given by:\n    $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2 + \\frac{g_0}{4!} \\phi^4$\n    In this expression, $g_0$ is the bare coupling constant. A dimensional analysis of the action $S=\\int d^D x \\, \\mathcal{L}$ reveals that the mass dimension of the coupling $g_0$ is $[g_0] = 4 - D = \\epsilon$.\n\n3.  **Renormalization Group and the Beta Function:**\n    In quantum field theory, coupling constants \"run\" with the energy scale $\\mu$. This running is described by the beta function, $\\beta(g) = \\mu \\frac{dg}{d\\mu}$, where $g$ is the dimensionless renormalized coupling constant, defined by relating the bare coupling $g_0$ to $g$ and the RG scale $\\mu$: $g_0 = \\mu^\\epsilon g$. The factor $\\mu^\\epsilon$ is introduced to make the renormalized coupling $g$ dimensionless in $D=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Beta Function for g:**\n    The beta function for $g$ is calculated by demanding that the physics (described by the bare Lagrangian with coupling $g_0$) is independent of the arbitrary scale $\\mu$. This requires introducing renormalization constants (Z-factors) which absorb the ultraviolet (UV) divergences of the theory. Using dimensional regularization and the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme, the one-loop calculation for the 4-point vertex function yields the following beta function for the coupling $g$:\n    $\\beta(g) = \\mu \\frac{dg}{d\\mu} = -\\epsilon g + \\frac{3g^2}{16\\pi^2} + O(g^3)$\n    *   The $-\\epsilon g$ term comes from the classical scaling dimension of the coupling.\n    *   The $+\\frac{3g^2}{16\\pi^2}$ term is the one-loop quantum correction. The factor of 3 is a combinatorial factor for the one-loop diagrams, and the $16\\pi^2$ factor is characteristic of one-loop integrals in 4 dimensions.\n\n5.  **Finding the Fixed Point for g:**\n    A fixed point $g^*$ is a value of the coupling where the beta function vanishes, $\\beta(g^*) = 0$. This means the coupling ceases to run with scale, and the theory becomes scale-invariant.\n    Setting the beta function to zero:\n    $-\\epsilon g^* + \\frac{3(g^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0$\n    This equation has two solutions:\n    *   $g^* = 0$: This is the trivial Gaussian fixed point, corresponding to a free theory.\n    *   $g^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3}$: This is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Since we are looking for the leading order expression in $\\epsilon$, this is our answer for the coupling $g$.\n\n6.  **Relating g* to the Coupling u*:**\n    The question asks for the fixed point coupling $u^*$. The notation '$u$' often implies a rescaled version of the Lagrangian coupling $g$, chosen to simplify expressions by absorbing numerical factors that appear in loop calculations. A very common convention, especially in the context of dimensional regularization, is to absorb the geometric factor $(4\\pi)^{D/2}$ that appears in loop integrals. At $D=4$, this factor is $(4\\pi)^2 = 16\\pi^2$. Let us define the coupling $u$ as:\n    $u = \\frac{g}{16\\pi^2}$\n\n7.  **Finding the Fixed Point u*:**\n    A fixed point of the theory is independent of the specific definition of the coupling constant. If $g^*$ is a fixed point for the coupling $g$, then the corresponding value $u^* = u(g^*)$ is the fixed point for the coupling $u$. We can directly find $u^*$ by substituting the value of $g^*$ into our definition of $u$:\n    $u^* = \\frac{g^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\frac{1}{16\\pi^2} \\left( \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3} \\right)$\n    $u^* = \\frac{\\epsilon}{3}$\n\n    *Alternative check:* We could compute the beta function for $u$ first.\n    $\\beta_u = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu} = \\frac{1}{16\\pi^2} \\mu \\frac{dg}{d\\mu} = \\frac{1}{16\\pi^2} \\beta_g(g)$.\n    $\\beta_u(u) = \\frac{1}{16\\pi^2} \\left( -\\epsilon g + \\frac{3g^2}{16\\pi^2} \\right) = -\\epsilon \\frac{g}{16\\pi^2} + 3 \\left( \\frac{g}{16\\pi^2} \\right)^2 = -\\epsilon u + 3u^2$.\n    Setting $\\beta_u(u^*) = 0$ gives $-\\epsilon u^* + 3(u^*)^2 = 0$, which yields the non-trivial solution $u^* = \\epsilon/3$. Both methods agree.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\nThe leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions depends on the normalization of the coupling. Taking the standard result for the Lagrangian coupling constant's beta function, $\\beta(g) = -\\epsilon g + 3g^2/(16\\pi^2)$, yields the fixed point $g^* = 16\\pi^2 \\epsilon / 3$. Adopting a common convention where the rescaled coupling $u$ absorbs the one-loop factor of $16\\pi^2$ (i.e., $u=g/(16\\pi^2)$), the fixed point coupling is $u^* = \\epsilon/3$.\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\epsilon}{3}$>>>"
