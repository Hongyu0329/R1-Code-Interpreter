    "An involution in a group `G` is an element `x` such that `x^2=1` and `x \\neq 1`. We are looking for the number of such elements in the Projective Special Unitary group `PSU(4, 997)`.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Group `PSU(4, 997)`**\n    *   The group `G = PSU(n, q)` is defined as `PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q^2) / Z(SU(n, q^2))`.\n    *   Here, the parameters are `n=4` and `q=997`. The group `SU(4, 997^2)` consists of 4x4 matrices `A` over the field `GF(997^2)` that satisfy `A * A^{T\\theta} = I` (unitary condition, where `\\theta` is the Frobenius automorphism `x \\mapsto x^q`) and `det(A) = 1` (special condition).\n    *   `Z = Z(SU(n, q^2))` is the center of `SU(n, q^2)`. Its order is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    *   For our case, `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`. Since `998 = 2 \\times 499` and 499 is a prime, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    *   The center `Z` consists of scalar matrices `\\lambda I` such that `\\lambda^4=1` and `\\lambda^{998}=1`. This implies `\\lambda^2=1`, so `\\lambda = \\pm 1`. Thus, `Z = \\{I, -I\\}`.\n\n2.  **Relate Involutions in `PSU` to elements in `SU`**\n    *   An element `g` in `PSU(4, 997)` is a coset `AZ` for some `A \\in SU(4, 997^2)`.\n    *   `g` is an involution if `g^2` is the identity element of `PSU` (`Z`), and `g` is not the identity element.\n    *   `g^2 = (AZ)^2 = A^2 Z`. For this to be the identity coset `Z`, we must have `A^2 \\in Z`.\n    *   For `g` not to be the identity, `A` must not be in `Z`.\n    *   So, we need to count the number of elements `A \\in SU(4, 997^2)` such that `A \\notin \\{I, -I\\}` and `A^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}`. These elements are the preimages of involutions.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Preimage Condition `A^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}`**\n    *   **Case A: `A^2 = -I`**\n        An element `A \\in U(n, q^2)` has eigenvalues `\\lambda` that satisfy `\\lambda \\cdot \\lambda^q = 1`. If `A^2 = -I`, then its eigenvalues must satisfy `\\lambda^2 = -1`.\n        Let's analyze if `-1` is a square in `GF(q) = GF(997)`. A number `-1` is a quadratic residue in `GF(q)` if and only if `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`.\n        Here `q=997`. We have `997 = 4 \\times 249 + 1`, so `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`. This means there exists an element `j \\in GF(997)` such that `j^2 = -1`.\n        If `A^2=-I`, its eigenvalues `\\lambda` are `\\pm j`. Since `j \\in GF(997)`, we have `\\lambda \\in GF(997)`.\n        For such `\\lambda`, `\\lambda^q = \\lambda^{997} = \\lambda`. The unitary condition on eigenvalues becomes `\\lambda \\cdot \\lambda^q = \\lambda^2 = 1`.\n        But the eigenvalues must satisfy `\\lambda^2 = -1`. This gives a contradiction: `1 = -1`, which implies `2=0`. This is false in `GF(997)`.\n        Therefore, there are no elements `A` in `SU(4, 997^2)` such that `A^2 = -I`.\n\n    *   **Case B: `A^2 = I`**\n        The elements `A` satisfying `A^2=I` are the involutions within `SU(4, 997^2)`. An involution `A` is diagonalizable, and its eigenvalues are `+1` or `-1`.\n        The condition `det(A) = 1` implies that the number of `-1` eigenvalues, let's call it `k`, must be even.\n        The condition `A \\notin Z = \\{I, -I\\}` means `A` is not the identity matrix (`k=0`) and not negative the identity matrix (`k=4`, as `det(-I)=(-1)^4=1`).\n        The only remaining possibility for `k` is `k=2`.\n        So, the preimages of involutions are precisely the elements `A \\in SU(4, 997^2)` with eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}`. Let the set of these elements be `X_1`.\n\n4.  **Count the Number of Preimages in `X_1`**\n    *   The elements of `X_1` form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, 997^2)`. Their number is the size of this class. The size is given by `|U(4, q^2)| / |C(A)|`, where `C(A)` is the centralizer of a representative element `A` in `U(4, q^2)`. The centralizer of an involution with a 2-dimensional (-1)-eigenspace is `U(2, q^2) \\times U(2, q^2)`.\n    *   `|X_1| = |U(4, q^2)| / |U(2, q^2)|^2`.\n    *   Let `q = 997`. The order of the unitary group is given by `|U(n, q^2)| = q^{n(n-1)} \\prod_{i=1}^n(q^i - (-1)^i)`. (This is a common typo, the correct exponent is `n(n-1)/2`, but the product expansion is what matters here.) Let's use the explicit product:\n        `|U(4, q^2)| = q^6 (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n        `|U(2, q^2)| = q (q+1)(q^2-1)`\n    *   Substituting these into the formula for `|X_1|`:\n        `|X_1| = [q^6 (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q (q+1)(q^2-1)]^2`\n        `|X_1| = [q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)] / [q^2(q+1)^2(q^2-1)^2]`\n        `|X_1| = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Involutions in `PSU(4, 997)`**\n    *   The projection `\\phi: SU \\to PSU` maps `A` to the coset `AZ`. The kernel is `Z = \\{I, -I\\}`. For any `A \\notin Z`, `\\phi` is a 2-to-1 map, sending both `A` and `-A` to the same coset.\n    *   If `A \\in X_1`, then `A` has eigenvalues `{1,1,-1,-1}`. Then `-A` has eigenvalues `{-1,-1,1,1}`, so `-A` is also in `X_1`. Since `A \\neq -A` (as characteristic is not 2), the set `X_1` is composed of `|X_1|/2` distinct pairs of the form `{A, -A}`.\n    *   Each such pair maps to a single, unique involution in `PSU(4, 997)`.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of involutions is `|X_1| / 2`.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nThe number of involutions is `(1/2) |X_1|`. Substituting the expression for `|X_1|` and setting `q = 997`:\nNumber of involutions = `(1/2) * q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`\nNumber of involutions = `(1/2) * 997^4 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) * (997^2 + 1)`\n\n`997^2 = 994009`\n`997^2 - 997 + 1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013`\n`997^2 + 1 = 994010`\n\nNumber of involutions = `(1/2) * 997^4 * (993013) * (994010)`\nNumber of involutions = `997^4 * 993013 * 497005`\n\nThe question can be interpreted as asking for the formula."
