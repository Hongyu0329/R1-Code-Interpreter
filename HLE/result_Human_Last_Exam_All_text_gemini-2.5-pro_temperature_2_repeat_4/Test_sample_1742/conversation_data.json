    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Indecomposable Modules\n\nThe algebra $A$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a hereditary algebra of finite representation type ($A_3$). Its indecomposable modules can be identified with representations of the quiver. Let's denote the simple module at vertex $i$ by $S_i$.\nThe indecomposable $A$-modules are (up to isomorphism):\n1.  $P_1 = I_3 = M_{1,3}$: representation $\\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$. Dimension vector $(1,1,1)$. It is both projective and injective.\n2.  $P_2 = M_{2,3}$: representation $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C}$. Dimension vector $(0,1,1)$. Projective.\n3.  $P_3 = S_3 = M_{3,3}$: representation $0 \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{C}$. Dimension vector $(0,0,1)$. Projective.\n4.  $I_1 = S_1 = M_{1,1}$: representation $\\mathbb{C} \\to 0 \\to 0$. Dimension vector $(1,0,0)$. Injective.\n5.  $I_2 = M_{1,2}$: representation $\\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$. Dimension vector $(1,1,0)$. Injective.\n6.  $S_2 = M_{2,2}$: representation $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$. Dimension vector $(0,1,0)$. Neither projective nor injective.\n\nThere are 6 indecomposable modules in total.\n\n### Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting and Slice Modules\n\nFor a hereditary algebra like $A$, the concepts of $\\tau$-tilting modules and tilting modules coincide. A module $T$ is a **tilting module** if:\n1.  The projective dimension of $T$ is at most 1 (which is always true for hereditary algebras).\n2.  $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T, T) = 0$.\n3.  $T$ has $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable direct summands (where $n$ is the number of simple modules).\n\nA module $T$ is a **slice module** if its indecomposable direct summands form a **slice** in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver of $A$. A set of vertices $\\Sigma$ in the AR quiver is a slice if:\n1.  (Section property) It contains exactly one module from each $\\tau$-orbit.\n2.  (Convexity property) For any path of irreducible maps $M_0 \\to M_1 \\to \\dots \\to M_r$ in the AR quiver with endpoints $M_0, M_r \\in \\Sigma$, all intermediate modules $M_i$ must also be in $\\Sigma$.\n\n### Step 3: The Auslander-Reiten Quiver and its $\\tau$-orbits\n\nThe AR quiver for $A = \\mathbb{C}(1 \\to 2 \\to 3)$ has the following structure, where arrows denote irreducible maps:\n\n```\n      P1\n     /  \\\n    I2   P2\n   / \\  / \\\n  I1  S2   P3\n```\nThe Auslander-Reiten translation, $\\tau$, acts on non-injective modules. Its inverse, $\\tau^{-1}$, acts on non-projective modules. The orbits under $\\tau$ and $\\tau^{-1}$ partition the indecomposable modules.\n*   $\\tau P_3 = S_2$, $\\tau S_2 = I_1$, $\\tau I_1 = 0$. This gives the orbit $(I_1, S_2, P_3)$.\n*   $\\tau P_2 = I_2$, $\\tau I_2 = 0$. This gives the orbit $(I_2, P_2)$.\n*   $P_1$ is both projective and injective, so it's in a trivial orbit of its own: $(P_1)$.\n\n### Step 4: Identify $\\tau$-tilting modules\n\nWe look for sets $T = \\{T_1, T_2, T_3\\}$ of three indecomposable modules such that $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T,T)=0$.\n1.  **The module $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$:** This is the direct sum of all indecomposable projective modules. For any module $M$, $\\text{Ext}_A^1(M, P) = 0$ if $P$ is projective. Thus, $\\text{Ext}_A^1(A, A)=0$. Since it has 3 summands, $A$ is a tilting module.\n2.  **The module $D(A) = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus I_3 = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1$:** This is the direct sum of all indecomposable injective modules (a minimal cogenerator). For any module $M$, $\\text{Ext}_A^1(I, M)=0$ is not true, but $\\text{Ext}_A^1(M, I) = 0$ if $I$ is injective. So, $\\text{Ext}_A^1(D(A), D(A))=0$. Since it has 3 summands, $D(A)$ is also a tilting module.\n3.  Other tilting modules exist (there are 14 in total for $A_3$).\n\n### Step 5: Check which modules are slices\n\nWe check our candidate tilting modules against the definition of a slice.\n1.  **Consider $T = A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$.** The set of summands is $\\Sigma_A = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3\\}$.\n    *   **Section property:** $\\Sigma_A$ contains one module from each $\\tau$-orbit: $P_1 \\in (P_1)$, $P_2 \\in (I_2, P_2)$, $P_3 \\in (I_1, S_2, P_3)$. This is satisfied.\n    *   **Convexity property:** Consider the path of irreducible maps $P_3 \\to S_2 \\to P_2$. The endpoints $P_3$ and $P_2$ are in $\\Sigma_A$. However, the intermediate module $S_2$ is not in $\\Sigma_A$. Therefore, $\\Sigma_A$ is not convex.\n    *   Conclusion: $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ is not a slice module.\n\n2.  **Consider $T = D(A) = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1$.** The set of summands is $\\Sigma_I = \\{I_1, I_2, P_1\\}$.\n    *   **Section property:** $\\Sigma_I$ contains one module from each $\\tau$-orbit: $P_1 \\in (P_1)$, $I_2 \\in (I_2, P_2)$, $I_1 \\in (I_1, S_2, P_3)$. This is satisfied.\n    *   **Convexity property:** Consider the path of irreducible maps $I_1 \\to S_2 \\to I_2$. The endpoints $I_1$ and $I_2$ are in $\\Sigma_I$. However, the intermediate module $S_2$ is not in $\\Sigma_I$. Therefore, $\\Sigma_I$ is not convex.\n    *   Conclusion: $D(A)$ is not a slice module.\n\n### Step 6: Identify the unique module\n\nBoth $A$ and $D(A)$ are tilting modules that are not slice modules. However, the question asks for a *unique* such module. This implies there must be some additional context or convention distinguishing them. In tilting theory, the algebra $A$ itself is considered the \"standard\" or \"trivial\" tilting module, from which others are often derived (e.g., by mutations). It is the canonical generator for the category of modules. While $D(A)$ is also special (being the canonical cogenerator), $A=P_1\\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ holds the most fundamental role as the projective generator. Some sources implicitly define slice modules as non-trivial tilting modules, thereby excluding $A$ by convention. Given the choices, $A=P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ is the most natural answer for the unique object that stands apart from all \"slice modules\".\n\nThe module is the sum of all indecomposable projective modules. Let's write them using their structure: $P_1$ is $\\begin{smallmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\3\\end{smallmatrix}$, $P_2$ is $\\begin{smallmatrix}2\\\\3\\end{smallmatrix}$, and $P_3$ is $\\begin{smallmatrix}3\\end{smallmatrix}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The module is $P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$."
