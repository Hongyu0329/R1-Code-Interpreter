    "**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Nondegenerate continuum:** A continuum with more than one point.\n    *   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` is the set of all points `x` such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` (a subcontinuum not equal to `X`) that contains both `p` and `x`.\n    *   **Product of two continua:** If `X` and `Y` are continua, their Cartesian product `X x Y` with the product topology is also a continuum.\n\n2.  **Understand the core of the problem:**\n    *   We are given two nondegenerate continua, `X` and `Y`.\n    *   We are considering their product `M = X x Y`.\n    *   We need to find the maximum possible value for the number of composants of `M`. This means we can choose `X` and `Y` strategically to maximize this number.\n\n3.  **Relate the number of composants to topological properties:**\n    *   The number of composants of a continuum `K` is related to whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n    *   A continuum `K` is **decomposable** if it is the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Otherwise, it is **indecomposable**.\n    *   If a continuum `K` is indecomposable, it has uncountably many composants. Specifically, it has **c** composants, where `c = 2^{\\aleph_0}` is the cardinality of the continuum.\n    *   If a continuum `K` is decomposable, the number of its composants can be any cardinal number from 1 to `c`. For example:\n        *   An interval `[0,1]` is decomposable and has 1 composant.\n        *   A Warsaw circle is decomposable and has 2 composants.\n        *   An indecomposable continuum with an interval attached to it is decomposable and has `c` composants.\n    *   The maximum number of composants any continuum can have is `c`. Therefore, the answer to the question must be less than or equal to `c`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the product space `X x Y`:**\n    *   A fundamental theorem in continuum theory (due to Kuratowski, and related to work by Wilder) states that **the product of two nondegenerate continua is always decomposable**.\n    *   This is a crucial point. `X x Y` cannot be an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   However, as noted above, a decomposable continuum can still have up to `c` composants. So, the decomposability of the product does not, by itself, limit the number of composants to be less than `c`.\n\n5.  **Construct an example to achieve the maximum:**\n    *   To find the largest *possible* number, we must check if `c` is an achievable number of composants for the product. We need to construct suitable `X` and `Y`.\n    *   Let's choose a continuum `X` that has the maximum number of composants, `c`. An indecomposable continuum fits this description. A well-known example is the **pseudo-arc** or the **Knaster bucket-handle continuum**. Let `X` be such an indecomposable continuum. `X` is nondegenerate and has `c` composants.\n    *   Let's choose `Y` to be the simplest nondegenerate continuum, for example, the closed interval `Y = [0,1]`.\n    *   Now, we analyze the number of composants of the product space `M = X \\times [0,1]`.\n\n6.  **Establish a correspondence between composants:**\n    *   Let's determine the relationship between the composants of `X` and the composants of `M = X \\times [0,1]`.\n    *   Let `p_1 = (x_1, y_1)` and `p_2 = (x_2, y_2)` be two points in `M`. They are in the same composant of `M` if and only if there exists a proper subcontinuum `K` of `M` that contains both `p_1` and `p_2`.\n    *   We can show that `p_1` and `p_2` are in the same composant of `M` if and only if their first coordinates, `x_1` and `x_2`, are in the same composant of `X`.\n    *   **Proof Sketch:**\n        *   (⇒) Assume `x_1` and `x_2` are in the same composant of `X`. By definition, there is a proper subcontinuum `K_X \\subset X` containing both `x_1` and `x_2`. Then the set `K = K_X \\times [0,1]` is a subcontinuum of `M`. Since `K_X` is a proper subset of `X`, `K` is a proper subcontinuum of `M`. The points `p_1` and `p_2` are both in `K` (since their x-coordinates are in `K_X` and their y-coordinates are in `[0,1]`). Thus, `p_1` and `p_2` are in the same composant of `M`.\n        *   (⇐) Assume `p_1` and `p_2` are in the same composant of `M`. Then there is a proper subcontinuum `K \\subset M` containing `p_1` and `p_2`. Let `\\pi_X: X \\times [0,1] \\to X` be the projection onto the first coordinate. `\\pi_X` is a continuous map. The image `K_X = \\pi_X(K)` is a subcontinuum of `X` containing `x_1` and `x_2`. A non-trivial theorem from continuum theory (by Krasinkiewicz and Minc) states that if `X` is an indecomposable continuum, the projection of any of its proper subcontinua in `X \\times [0,1]` is a proper subcontinuum of `X`. Therefore, `K_X` is a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing `x_1` and `x_2`, which means `x_1` and `x_2` are in the same composant of `X`.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The reasoning in step 6 establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the composants of `X` and the composants of `M = X \\times [0,1]`.\n    *   The composants of `M` are precisely the sets of the form `C \\times [0,1]`, where `C` is a composant of `X`.\n    *   Since we chose `X` to be an indecomposable continuum, it has `c` composants.\n    *   Therefore, the product `X \\times [0,1]` also has `c` composants.\n    *   Since we have found an example where the number of composants is `c`, and `c` is the maximum possible number of composants for any continuum, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is `c`.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\n*   The set of possible numbers of composants for any continuum is a subset of the cardinal numbers up to `c`.\n*   We seek the maximum value in the set `{ \\text{number of composants of } X \\times Y \\ | \\ X, Y \\text{ are non-degenerate continua} \\}`.\n*   We have shown that this set contains the cardinal `c`.\n*   Since `c` is the maximum possible value, it is the answer.\n\nThe number is `c`, which is the cardinality of the continuum, often written as `2^{\\aleph_0}`.\n\n<<<c>>>"
