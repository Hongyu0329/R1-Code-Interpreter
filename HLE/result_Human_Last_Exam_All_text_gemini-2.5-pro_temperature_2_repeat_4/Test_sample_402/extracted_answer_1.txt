The proposed filtering strategy is to first perform a paired differential expression analysis (e.g., using DESeq2 with a design of `~donor + condition`) where the contaminated 'CAR_only' group is set as the reference level. After generating the results table, use a command-line tool like `awk` to filter out genes that meet a combined criteria of a strongly negative log2 fold change and high statistical significance. A specific command-line implementation would be: `awk 'BEGIN {FS="\t"} NR==1 || !($3 < -5 && $7 < 0.01)' de_results.tsv > de_results.filtered.tsv`, assuming log2FoldChange is in column 3 and the adjusted p-value is in column 7 of your tab-separated results file. This removes genes over 32-fold more abundant in the contaminated samples with an adjusted p-value less than 0.01.
