    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Reactant 1: Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene).** This is a conjugated diene with the structure CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. For this reaction, it must adopt the s-cis conformation.\n    *   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.** This is a substituted alkene with the structure CCl₂=CF₂. Alkenes that react with dienes are called dienophiles.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a type of [4+2] cycloaddition, where the 4 π-electrons from the diene and the 2 π-electrons from the dienophile rearrange in a concerted fashion to form a new six-membered ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Connectivity of the Product:**\n    *   In a Diels-Alder reaction, two new sigma (σ) bonds and one new pi (π) bond are formed, at the expense of three old π bonds.\n    *   The terminal carbons of the diene (C1 and C4 of CH₂(1)=CH(2)-CH(3)=CH₂(4)) form new σ-bonds with the two carbons of the dienophile (C(α)F₂=C(β)Cl₂).\n    *   The double bond of the dienophile becomes a single bond.\n    *   The two double bonds of the diene are consumed, and a new double bond is formed between the central carbons of the diene (C2 and C3).\n    *   This results in a six-membered ring structure, specifically a cyclohexene derivative.\n    *   The atoms forming the ring are C1, C2, C3, C4 from the diene, and Cα, Cβ from the dienophile, connected in the sequence: `-C1-C2=C3-C4-Cβ-Cα-`.\n\n3.  **Draw the Structure of the Product:**\n    *   Let's place the substituents onto the carbon framework:\n        *   C1 and C4 from butadiene are -CH₂- groups.\n        *   C2 and C3 from butadiene are =CH- groups.\n        *   Cα from the dienophile is a -CF₂- group.\n        *   Cβ from the dienophile is a -CCl₂- group.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the following ring structure:\n        ```\n             (C2)CH = CH(C3)\n             /         \\\n        (C1)H₂C           CH₂(C4)\n            \\                 /\n             C(α)F₂ --------- C(β)Cl₂\n        ```\n    *   **Careful Point (Regiochemistry):** Butadiene is a symmetrical molecule. 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is also symmetrical (with a C2 axis of rotation). Therefore, there is only one possible product in terms of how the atoms are connected. Attaching the CCl₂ end to C4 and the CF₂ end to C1 yields the same molecule as attaching the CCl₂ end to C1 and the CF₂ end to C4 (one is simply a flipped version of the other).\n\n4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product:**\n    *   **Parent Ring:** The six-membered ring with one double bond is a **cyclohexene**.\n    *   **Numbering:** According to IUPAC rules, the carbons of the double bond must be assigned the lowest possible numbers, C1 and C2.\n    *   **Locating Substituents:** This means the other ring carbons are numbered C3, C4, C5, and C6. The substituents (the two -Cl atoms and the two -F atoms) will be on carbons adjacent to the saturated CH₂ groups. In our structure, they are at positions 4 and 5 relative to the double bond.\n    *   **Applying the Lowest Locant Rule:** We have two possible ways to number the ring, depending on which direction we go from the double bond:\n        *   **Direction 1:** Numbering leads to chloro substituents at C4 and fluoro substituents at C5. The locant set is {4,4,5,5}.\n        *   **Direction 2:** Numbering leads to fluoro substituents at C4 and chloro substituents at C5. The locant set is also {4,4,5,5}.\n    *   **Careful Point (Alphabetical Tie-Breaker):** When two different numbering schemes produce the same lowest locant set, the tie is broken by giving the lower number to the group that comes first alphabetically.\n        *   The substituent names are \"chloro\" and \"fluoro\".\n        *   \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically.\n        *   Therefore, the carbon with the two chlorine atoms should be given the lower number, which is 4.\n    *   **Assembling the Final Name:**\n        *   Substituents: 4,4-dichloro and 5,5-difluoro.\n        *   Parent name: cyclohexene (the \"-1-\" is often omitted as it is implied).\n        *   The full name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe reaction is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition which forms a six-membered ring. The product is named by identifying the parent cyclohexene ring and numbering it to give the alphabetically prior substituent (chloro) the lowest possible number.\n\nThe product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
