    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Question:** The goal is to identify a specific physicist based on several clues provided in the question.\n2.  **Identify the Key Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: Physicist:** The answer is the name of a person.\n    *   **Clue 2: Better known for work in the microscopy field:** This is a major constraint. The physicist's primary contribution or fame lies in the area of microscopy.\n    *   **Clue 3: Discovered an optical effect in real imagery:** The discovery is a fundamental principle of optics that affects how images are formed.\n    *   **Clue 4: An anecdote involving accidental observation by a custodial worker:** This is a very specific historical detail that should be a strong pointer to the correct person.\n    *   **Clue 5: The observation involved cleaning concave mirrors:** This specifies the equipment and context of the anecdote.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The phrasing \"accidentally observed by a custodial worker\" may be a popular or simplified version of the actual historical event. The worker might not have been the formal discoverer but may have played a key role in the observation or inspired the insight.\n*   The connection between concave mirrors and microscopy is important. Concave mirrors are used in reflecting telescopes and other optical systems to form real images, and principles discovered with them can be applicable to the lenses used in microscopes.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Connecting the Clues:** We are looking for a story linking a microscopy expert to a custodian and a concave mirror. This unique combination of elements strongly points towards a specific discovery.\n\n2.  **Searching for the Physicist:** The anecdote described is famously associated with the Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**.\n\n3.  **Verifying each Clue against Frits Zernike:**\n    *   **Physicist:** Yes, Frits Zernike (1888-1966) was a Dutch physicist.\n    *   **Better known for work in the microscopy field:** Yes, Zernike was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 specifically for his invention of the **phase-contrast microscope**. This invention revolutionized biology and medicine by allowing scientists to study living, unstained cells.\n    *   **Discovered an optical effect:** The effect he discovered is the principle of **phase contrast**. This principle allows for the conversion of undetectable differences in the phase of light (caused by light passing through different parts of a transparent specimen) into visible differences in brightness or amplitude.\n    *   **Anecdote and Concave Mirrors:** Zernike's insight into phase contrast originated from his work in the 1930s on testing the quality of concave mirrors used for telescopes. He was studying minor flaws and ruling errors in diffraction gratings. The story goes that he noticed that dust and small scratches on the mirror, which are essentially \"phase objects\" (they alter the phase of light but not its amplitude), became momentarily visible when a custodian wiped the mirror's surface with a slightly greasy cloth. The thin film left by the cloth introduced an additional phase shift that made the original phase objects visible. Zernike used this observation as a key analogy to explain his discovery to others.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** All the clues in the question perfectly align with Frits Zernike and his discovery of the principle of phase contrast, which led to his Nobel Prize-winning work in microscopy.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
