    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Character Structure**\nThe character in question is 謄. To find its radical (部首, bushu), we must first break down the character into its constituent parts. The character 謄 is a type of kanji called a 形声文字 (keisei moji), which means it is composed of a semantic component (indicating meaning) and a phonetic component (indicating sound). This character is clearly divisible into a left part and a right part.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Components**\n*   **Left Component:** The part on the left is 言.\n*   **Right Component:** The part on the right is 滕.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Radical (Bushu)**\nThe radical is the part of the character used for classification and look-up in traditional dictionaries. In a 形声文字, the radical is almost always the semantic component.\n*   The left component, 言, means \"word,\" \"speech,\" or \"to say.\"\n*   The character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" activities directly related to words and writing.\n*   The right component, 滕, provides the phonetic value \"TŌ\" or \"DŌ.\"\nTherefore, the semantic component, and thus the radical, is 言.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Japanese Name of the Radical**\nThe names of radicals in Japanese often change depending on their position within a character. When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏), which means \"left side.\" The specific name for the 言 radical in this position is ごんべん (gonben).\n\n**Step 5: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nWe need to convert the Japanese name ごんべん into Hepburn romanization.\n*   ご becomes \"go\"\n*   ん becomes \"n\"\n*   べ becomes \"be\"\n*   ん becomes \"n\"\nPutting it all together, the Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Correct Decomposition:** It is crucial to correctly separate the character into its left and right parts. Misidentifying the components would lead to the wrong radical.\n*   **Radical Naming Convention:** One must know the specific name for the radical based on its position. Simply stating the radical's own name (\"gen\" for 言) would be incomplete. The question's example, \"Onnahen\" for 媛 (where the radical is 女 on the left), clearly indicates that the positional name is required.\n*   **Accurate Romanization:** Ensure the Hepburn transcription is correct (e.g., using \"n\" for ん, \"be\" for べ).\n\nFollowing this step-by-step analysis, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
