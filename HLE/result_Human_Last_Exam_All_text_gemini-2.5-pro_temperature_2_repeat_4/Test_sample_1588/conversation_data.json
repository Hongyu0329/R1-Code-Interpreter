    "This problem asks for the number of non-zero coefficients in the homogeneous part of degree 10 of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. The BCH formula expresses $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ as a series of nested Lie brackets of X and Y.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the nature of the BCH expansion terms**\n\nThe BCH formula is given by $Z = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty Z_n(X, Y)$, where $Z_n(X, Y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$. Each $Z_n$ is an element of the free Lie algebra generated by X and Y. This means that $Z_n$ can be written as a unique linear combination of basis elements of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree $n$. The question is about counting how many of these coefficients are non-zero for $n=10$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the number of coefficients to the dimension of a vector space**\n\nThe set of all homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree $n$ in two generators (X and Y) forms a vector space over the rational numbers. Let's denote this space by $\\mathcal{L}_n(X, Y)$. The number of terms with non-zero coefficients in $Z_n(X, Y)$ depends on two things:\n1.  The dimension of the vector space $\\mathcal{L}_n(X, Y)$. This tells us the maximum possible number of independent terms.\n2.  Whether the coefficients corresponding to these basis elements in the specific BCH expansion are actually non-zero.\n\nA fundamental result by K. Goldberg (1956) proves that for any basis of the free Lie algebra, the coefficient of every basis element in the BCH series is non-zero. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients of order $n$ is exactly equal to the dimension of $\\mathcal{L}_n(X, Y)$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the dimension using the Witt Formula**\n\nThe dimension of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree $n$ with $k$ generators is given by Ernst Witt's formula:\n$L_k(n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\nwhere:\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n*   $k$ is the number of generators.\n*   $n$ is the degree.\n\nIn our problem, we have two generators, X and Y, so $k=2$. We are interested in order 10, so $n=10$.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Witt formula for n=10 and k=2**\n\nThe formula becomes:\n$L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n\n*   **Find the divisors of 10:** The positive divisors of 10 are $d \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n*   **Determine the Möbius function values $\\mu(d)$:**\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 has one prime factor, which is an odd number of prime factors).\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 has one prime factor).\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 has two distinct prime factors).\n\n*   **Substitute these values into the Witt formula:**\n    $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( \\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} + \\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} + \\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} + \\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} \\right)$\n    $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^5 + (-1) \\cdot 2^2 + (1) \\cdot 2^1 \\right)$\n\n**Step 5: Perform the final calculation**\n\n*   Calculate the powers of 2:\n    *   $2^{10} = 1024$\n    *   $2^5 = 32$\n    *   $2^2 = 4$\n    *   $2^1 = 2$\n\n*   Substitute these numerical values back into the expression:\n    $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} (1 \\cdot 1024 - 1 \\cdot 32 - 1 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2)$\n    $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} (1024 - 32 - 4 + 2)$\n    $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} (990 - 4 + 2)$\n    $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} (988 + 2)$\n    $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} (990)$\n    $L_2(10) = 99$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree 10 in two variables. This dimension is calculated using the Witt formula to be 99."
