    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze Step 1: Initialization**\n    *   `i := 0;`: This is a single assignment operation. It takes constant time, which we denote as O(1).\n    *   `x := n;`: Another single assignment operation, taking O(1) time.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: This involves one division and one floor operation. Assuming that `n` fits within a standard integer type of a computer, this is a single machine instruction and takes constant time, O(1).\n    *   `a_0 := x — qc;`: This involves one multiplication, one subtraction, and one assignment. These are also considered elementary operations that take constant time, O(1).\n    *   **Conclusion for Step 1:** The initialization step consists of a fixed number of constant-time operations. Therefore, its time complexity is O(1).\n\n2.  **Analyze Step 2: The `while` loop**\n    *   This is the main part of the algorithm. To find its complexity, we need to determine two things: (a) how many times the loop runs, and (b) how much time each iteration takes.\n    *   **(a) Number of Iterations:**\n        *   The loop continues as long as the condition `q > 0` is true.\n        *   Let's trace the value of `q`. Initially, `q = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   In the first iteration, `x` becomes the old `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`. So after the first iteration, `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        *   After `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n        *   The loop will execute as long as the value of `q` tested in the `while` condition is greater than 0. Let `K` be the total number of iterations. The loop runs for `i = 1, 2, ..., K`.\n        *   The loop stops when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^(K+1)⌋ = 0`. This inequality is true if `n/c^(K+1) < 1`, which means `n < c^(K+1)`.\n        *   The last time the loop executed (the `K`-th iteration), the condition `q > 0` must have been true. At the start of the `K`-th iteration, `q = ⌊n/c^K⌋`, so we must have `⌊n/c^K⌋ > 0`, which implies `n/c^K ≥ 1`, or `n ≥ c^K`.\n        *   Combining these two conditions, we have `c^K ≤ n < c^(K+1)`.\n        *   Taking the logarithm base `c` on all parts of the inequality gives: `log_c(c^K) ≤ log_c(n) < log_c(c^(K+1))`, which simplifies to `K ≤ log_c(n) < K+1`.\n        *   This means the number of iterations, `K`, is exactly `⌊log_c(n)⌋`. For large `n`, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n    *   **(b) Time per Iteration:**\n        *   Inside the loop (Step 2.1), we have the following operations: `i := i + 1;`, `x := q;`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`, and `a_i := x - qc`.\n        *   Similar to Step 1, these are all elementary assignments and arithmetic operations. Under the standard assumption that these operations take constant time, the work done inside each loop iteration is O(1).\n    *   **Conclusion for Step 2:** The total time complexity of the loop is the number of iterations multiplied by the time per iteration. This is `O(⌊log_c(n)⌋) * O(1)`, which simplifies to `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n3.  **Analyze Step 3: Return**\n    *   The algorithm returns the representation `(a_i, ..., a_0)`. The number of digits in this representation is `i+1`. The final value of `i` is `K`, the number of loop iterations.\n    *   So, the size of the output is `K+1 = ⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. Creating and returning this output can be considered to take time proportional to its size.\n    *   **Conclusion for Step 3:** The complexity of this step is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n4.  **Overall Complexity**\n    *   The total time complexity of the algorithm is the sum of the complexities of its parts:\n        `T(n, c) = T_step1 + T_step2 + T_step3`\n        `T(n, c) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(log_c(n))`\n    *   The dominant term in this sum is `O(log_c(n))`.\n    *   Therefore, the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Model of Computation:** The analysis assumes a Random Access Machine (RAM) model, where basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numbers that fit into a machine word are considered to take O(1) time. If `n` is an arbitrarily large number requiring multiple words of storage, the cost of these operations would depend on the number of bits in `n` (which is `~log_2(n)`), and the overall complexity would be higher, typically `O((log n)^2)`. For standard algorithm analysis, the O(1) assumption for arithmetic is common unless specified otherwise.\n2.  **Role of `c`:** The complexity depends on the base `c`. However, in Big-O notation, constant factors are ignored. Using the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c ≥ 2` is a constant for the purpose of analyzing the growth rate with respect to `n`, `1/log(c)` is also a constant. Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is asymptotically equivalent to `O(log n)`. `O(log n)` is the most common way to state this complexity, but `O(log_c(n))` is more specific to the algorithm's structure.\n3.  **Input Parameter:** The complexity is analyzed with respect to the magnitude of the input integer `n`. It describes how the algorithm's runtime scales as `n` grows very large. For small values of `n` (e.g., `n < c`), the loop does not execute, and the complexity is O(1). Asymptotic analysis focuses on the behavior for large `n`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe algorithm's execution time is dominated by the `while` loop. The number of times the loop executes is determined by how many times the input number `n` can be divided by the base `c` until the result is zero. This process is inherently logarithmic. Each division reduces the magnitude of the number `x` by a factor of `c`. This leads to `⌊log_c(n)⌋` iterations. As each iteration performs a constant amount of work, the total time complexity is proportional to the number of iterations.\n\nFinal Complexity: `O(log_c(n))`\n\nThis is often simplified to `O(log n)` because the base of the logarithm does not affect the asymptotic complexity class.\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
