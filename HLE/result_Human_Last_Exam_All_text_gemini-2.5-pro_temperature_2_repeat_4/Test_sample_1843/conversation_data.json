    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the problem\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely factored into a product of characters based on the prime factorization of $N$.\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\nAny character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be written as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo the prime power $p^a$.\n\nThere are two main conditions on the character $\\chi$:\n1.  **Primitive Conductor**: The conductor of $\\chi$, $f_\\chi$, must be $N$. This holds if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ is primitive modulo $p^a$. That is, $f_{\\chi_4}=4$, $f_{\\chi_9}=9$, $f_{\\chi_7}=7$, $f_{\\chi_{11}}=11$, and $f_{\\chi_{13}}=13$.\n2.  **Order**: The order of $\\chi$ must be 6. The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\nLet's denote the order of $\\chi_{p^a}$ by $k_{p^a}$. For $\\text{lcm}(k_4, k_9, k_7, k_{11}, k_{13})$ to be 6, two conditions must be met:\na) The order of each component character, $k_{p^a}$, must be a divisor of 6.\nb) At least one order must be divisible by 2, and at least one order must be divisible by 3.\n\nOur task is to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ that satisfy these conditions. We will analyze the possible choices for each component character.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze component characters\nWe count the number of primitive characters modulo each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, whose order $k_{p^a}$ divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$)**:\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(4)=2$.\n    A character $\\chi_4$ is primitive if its conductor is 4. Of the two characters modulo 4, one is principal (conductor 1) and the other is non-principal. The non-principal character has conductor 4. Its order is 2.\n    The order $k_4 = 2$ divides 6. So, there is exactly **1** choice for $\\chi_4$.\n    *Careful point*: The order is fixed to $k_4=2$. This ensures that the final lcm will be divisible by 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$)**:\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, a cyclic group of order $\\phi(9)=6$.\n    The primitive characters modulo 9 are those that are not induced by characters modulo 3. The number of such characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$.\n    The orders of characters in a cyclic group of order 6 can be 1, 2, 3, or 6. The non-primitive characters are those induced from modulo 3, whose orders divide $\\phi(3)=2$. So, the primitive characters are the remaining ones, which must have orders 3 or 6.\n    - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    Both orders 3 and 6 divide 6. So all 4 primitive characters are valid choices. Total choices for $\\chi_9$ is $2+2=**4**$.\n    *Careful point*: The order $k_9$ must be 3 or 6. This ensures that the final lcm will be divisible by 3.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**:\n    The group of characters modulo 7 is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(7)=6$.\n    A character is primitive if its conductor is 7, which means it is not the principal character (conductor 1).\n    We need to count the non-principal characters whose order divides 6. Since all characters have orders dividing 6, this is all non-principal characters. The number is $\\phi(7)-1=5$.\n    These characters have orders 2 ($\\phi(2)=1$), 3 ($\\phi(3)=2$), and 6 ($\\phi(6)=2$). Total: $1+2+2=**5**$ choices for $\\chi_7$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**:\n    The group of characters modulo 11 is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(11)=10$.\n    We need primitive characters (non-principal) whose order $k_{11}$ divides 6. So, $k_{11}$ must divide $\\gcd(\\phi(11), 6) = \\gcd(10, 6) = 2$.\n    Since the character must be primitive, its order cannot be 1. Thus, the order must be $k_{11}=2$.\n    The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. There is **1** choice for $\\chi_{11}$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**:\n    The group of characters modulo 13 is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(13)=12$.\n    We need primitive characters (non-principal) whose order $k_{13}$ divides 6. So, $k_{13}$ must be a divisor of $\\gcd(\\phi(13), 6) = \\gcd(12, 6) = 6$, and not equal to 1.\n    The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    - Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1+2+2=**5**$.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the results\nWe have found the number of valid choices for each component character. Let's verify the final lcm condition.\nThe possible orders for the components are:\n- $k_4 = 2$\n- $k_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n- $k_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n- $k_{11} = 2$\n- $k_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe lcm of these orders must be 6.\n- Since $k_4=2$, the lcm is divisible by 2.\n- Since $k_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$, the lcm is divisible by 3.\n- Therefore, the lcm must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3)=6$.\n- Since all individual orders divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\n- Combining these, the lcm is exactly 6 for any valid choice of component characters.\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of characters = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nFinal Answer is 100."
