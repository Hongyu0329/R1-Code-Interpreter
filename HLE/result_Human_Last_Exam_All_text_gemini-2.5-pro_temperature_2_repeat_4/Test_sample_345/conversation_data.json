    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which museum acquired Kurt Günther's \"The Radionist\" in 1967.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Information:** The question provides several key pieces of data:\n    *   **Artwork:** \"The Radionist\" (original German title: \"Der Radionist\")\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Creation Date:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Acquisition Date:** 1967\n\n2.  **Formulate a Research Strategy:** The most direct way to find this information is to search for the artwork and artist in museum collection databases or art history resources, specifically looking for provenance (ownership history) records. Using the German title \"Der Radionist\" can be helpful as the artist is German.\n\n3.  **Execute the Research:** A search for \"Kurt Günther Der Radionist 1927\" leads to several reliable sources, including the online collection of a major German museum.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Findings:** The search results consistently point to the **Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden** (Dresden State Art Collections).\n    *   Within this large museum network, the painting is housed in the **Galerie Neue Meister** (New Masters Gallery).\n    *   Checking the official online collection database of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden for the artwork \"Der Radionist\" (Inventory no. Gal.-Nr. 3474) confirms the details.\n\n5.  **Verify the Acquisition Date:** The provenance section for this painting explicitly states \"erworben 1967 von Rudolf Günther, Weimar,\" which translates to \"acquired in 1967 from Rudolf Günther, Weimar.\" This perfectly matches the acquisition year mentioned in the question.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Original Title:** Using the artist's native language for the artwork title (\"Der Radionist\") can often provide more accurate and direct results from primary sources.\n*   **Museum Structure:** The Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden is a large complex of 15 museums. While the specific location of the painting is the Galerie Neue Meister, the acquiring institution is the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden itself. Both are correct, but the latter is the overarching entity that made the purchase.\n*   **Provenance Verification:** Always rely on the museum's own collection records when possible, as they are the most authoritative source for acquisition details.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the research and verification of the museum's own records, the institution that acquired the painting in 1967 is the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden.\n\n<<<Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections)"
