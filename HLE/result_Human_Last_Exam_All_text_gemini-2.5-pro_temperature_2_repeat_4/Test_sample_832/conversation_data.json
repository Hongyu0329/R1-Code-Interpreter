    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's performance.\n\n### Step 1: Clarifying the Scene and Variation\nThe question asks about the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene. However, this is likely a point of confusion.\n*   **The \"Death of Nikiya\" scene** takes place in Act 2. In this scene, Nikiya performs a lyrical dance with a basket of flowers before being bitten by a snake hidden inside. This variation does not typically feature bravura jumps like entrelacés.\n*   **The \"Kingdom of the Shades\"** is in Act 3. Nikiya's entrance variation in this act is one of the most famous solos in the classical repertoire and is renowned for its series of powerful jumps, including the signature *entrelacés*.\nGiven that the question specifies *entrelacés*, and Natalia Osipova is famous for her powerful execution of this step, the analysis will focus on her **entrance variation in the \"Kingdom of the Shades\" scene (Act 3)** from the 2009 Bolshoi Ballet performance, which is what is almost certainly being referred to.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Step \"Entrelacé\"\nThe term *entrelacé* is the common name for the ballet step *grand jeté en tournant entrelacé*. It is often shortened to *tour jeté*. This is a large, turning leap where the dancer jumps from one foot, makes a half-turn in the air, and lands on the other foot, having effectively switched the position of their legs mid-air. It's a very distinctive and demanding step.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Osipova's 2009 Performance\nThe analysis is based on viewing the footage of Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009, specifically her solo in the \"Kingdom of the Shades\".\n\n*   The variation begins with Nikiya's entrance from upstage.\n*   She performs an initial series of steps, including *saut de basque* turns and *arabesque penchées*.\n*   The key section for this question is the diagonal sequence of jumps that travels from upstage right to downstage left (from the audience's perspective).\n*   During this diagonal, Osipova performs a consecutive series of *entrelacés*.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Entrelacés\nBy carefully watching her perform this diagonal sequence, we can count each individual entrelacé:\n1.  First entrelacé\n2.  Second entrelacé\n3.  Third entrelacé\n4.  Fourth entrelacé\n5.  Fifth entrelacé\n6.  Sixth entrelacé\n\nAfter completing these six jumps, she transitions into a different sequence of turns (a manège) around the stage, which does not contain any more *entrelacés*. The choreography consists of only that single set.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut variation in the Kingdom of the Shades scene, she performs a total of 6 entrelacés.\n\n<<<6>>>"
