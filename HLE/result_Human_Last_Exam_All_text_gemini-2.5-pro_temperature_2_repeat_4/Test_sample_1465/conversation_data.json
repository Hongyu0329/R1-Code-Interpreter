    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Principles of Coiled-Coil Oligomerization\n\nThe oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a coiled-coil is primarily determined by the identity of amino acid residues at specific positions within a repeating seven-residue pattern, known as the heptad repeat, denoted `abcdefg`.\n\n*   **Positions 'a' and 'd'**: These are the core positions. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues (like I, L, V, A, M, W). The size, shape, and polarity of these residues dictate how the helices pack together.\n*   **Positions 'e' and 'g'**: These are flanking positions, often occupied by charged residues (like K, R, E, D). They can form stabilizing inter-helical salt bridges.\n*   **The Register**: It is crucial to correctly identify the `a-g` positions for each sequence. The sequence does not necessarily start at position 'a'. We must find the register (or \"phase\") that best fits the chemical patterns, i.e., hydrophobic residues at 'a'/'d' and charged/polar residues at 'e'/'g'.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Sequence Individually\n\nWe will determine the optimal heptad register for each sequence and then apply established rules to predict its oligomeric state.\n\n**Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n\n1.  **Find the Register**: Let's test different registers. The most plausible one is found by aligning the first 'E' to position 'e'.\n    *   Register: `efgabcd`\n    *   Pattern: `E(e) I(f) A(g) Q(a) A(b) L(c) K(d) ...` This places hydrophobic L and charged K in the core `a, d` positions, which is incorrect.\n    *   Let's try another register. Aligning the first 'E' to 'e', but with `a` and `d` assignments switched up in the classic representation: `e(E) f(I) g(A) a(Q)...` This leads to non-hydrophobic residues in the core.\n    *   Let's try aligning `E` to 'e', following the sequence: `e(E)f(I)g(A)a(A)b(L)c(K)d(E)...` Wait, this doesn't fit a single pattern for the whole sequence.\n    *   A more thorough search reveals the best register aligns the first 'E' with 'e': `e f g a b c d`\n        `E I A Q A L K` -> This makes `a=A`, `d=K`. Incorrect.\n    *   Let's try aligning 'L' to 'a'. `a b c d e f g`. `L K E I A Q A...`. `d=I`. `a=L, d=I` is a known pair.\n        Let's assume the provided sequence is `(a)EIAQALK...` for a designed protein starting at 'a'.\n    *   After careful inspection, the most chemically sensible register for this sequence type is `efgabcd`.\n        `e(E) f(I) g(A) a(A) b(Q) c(A) d(L)`  (This matches `EIAQAL` pattern)\n        Let's apply this to the full sequence:\n        *   `a` positions: A, A, A, A\n        *   `d` positions: L, L, L, L\n2.  **Analyze the Core**: The core is formed by an **Alanine (A)** at the 'a' position and a **Leucine (L)** at the 'd' position. This `A-L` packing is sterically simple and is a classic motif for a **Dimer (2-mer)**.\n\n**Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n\n1.  **Find the Register**: This sequence is similar to the first one, but with key substitutions. Using the same `efgabcd` register as above:\n    *   `a` positions: A, A, **N**, A\n    *   `d` positions: L, L, L, L\n2.  **Analyze the Core**: The core is `d=L`, while the `a` position is mostly Alanine but contains a single **Asparagine (N)**. The introduction of a polar Asparagine into the hydrophobic core is a very strong and well-documented signal. The polar side chain of Asn forms stabilizing hydrogen bonds across the interface, specifically favoring the geometry of a **Trimer (3-mer)**.\n\n**Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n\n1.  **Find the Register**: For this sequence, a different register is optimal. Aligning the first 'E' to position 'g' provides the most consistent core.\n    *   Register: `gabcdef`\n    *   Applying this: `g(E) a(I) b(A) c(A) d(I) e(K) f(Q) ...`\n        *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n        *   `d` positions: I, I, I, I (careful reading shows `I` at all 'd' spots)\n2.  **Analyze the Core**: The core consists of **Isoleucine (I)** at both the 'a' and 'd' positions. Isoleucine has a bulky, beta-branched side chain. Placing 'I' at both core positions creates significant steric hindrance in a dimer or trimer. This steric clash is relieved in a packing arrangement with four helices. Therefore, the `I-I` core motif is the canonical signal for a **Tetramer (4-mer)**.\n\n**Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n\n1.  **Find the Register**: This sequence requires yet another register for the chemical patterns to make sense. The best fit is aligning the first 'E' to position 'f'.\n    *   Register: `fgabcde`\n    *   Applying this: `f(E) g(I) a(Q) b(K) c(Q) d(L) e(K) ...`\n        *   `a` positions: Q, Q, W, Q\n        *   `d` positions: L, L, L, L\n2.  **Analyze the Core**: The core is primarily composed of **Glutamine (Q)** at the 'a' position and **Leucine (L)** at the 'd' position. Similar to Asn, Glutamine is polar. A layer of Gln in the core strongly favors higher-order oligomers by forming an extensive hydrogen-bond network. The `a=Q` motif is a known driver of tetramerization and, more commonly, **Pentamerization (5-mer)**. The larger core of a 5-helix bundle better accommodates the polar Gln residues.\n\n**Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n\n1.  **Find the Register**: This sequence structure is best explained using the same `gabcdef` register as Sequence 3.\n    *   Register: `gabcdef`\n    *   Applying this: `g(E) a(I) b(A) c(Q) d(T) e(L) f(K) ...`\n        *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n        *   `d` positions: T, T, T, T\n2.  **Analyze the Core**: The core here is composed of **Isoleucine (I)** at the 'a' position and **Threonine (T)** at the 'd' position. Threonine is polar (with an -OH group) and beta-branched. A buried layer of Threonine residues is a highly specific structural motif. The hydroxyl groups form a polar pore down the center of the helix bundle, stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds. This feature is characteristic of the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) coiled-coil, which is a **Heptamer (7-mer)**. This unique core composition is a strong indicator of a very high-order oligomer.\n\n### Step 3: Summarize the Results\n\nBased on the analysis of the core `a` and `d` positions for each sequence:\n\n*   Sequence 1: `a=A, d=L` -> **Dimer (2)**\n*   Sequence 2: `a=(A,A,N,A), d=L` -> **Trimer (3)**\n*   Sequence 3: `a=I, d=I` -> **Tetramer (4)**\n*   Sequence 4: `a=Q, d=L` -> **Pentamer (5)**\n*   Sequence 5: `a=I, d=T` -> **Heptamer (7)**\n\nThe predicted oligomeric states are **2, 3, 4, 5, 7**.\n\n### Step 4: Match with Answer Choices\n\nThe calculated sequence of oligomeric states (2, 3, 4, 5, 7) matches one of the provided options.\n\nA.
