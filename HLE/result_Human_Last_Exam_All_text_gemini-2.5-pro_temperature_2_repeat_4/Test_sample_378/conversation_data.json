    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user wants to know the specific year in which Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan made a public act of identifying himself with the name \"Azikiwe\". This implies a specific event, announcement, or change.\n\n2.  **Verify the Name:** The first step is to confirm if \"Azikiwe\" is part of his name. Research confirms that his full, legal name given at birth is **Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Premise:** The question assumes there was a point in time when he was not publicly known by the name \"Azikiwe\" and then made a conscious decision to start identifying with it publicly.\n\n4.  **Investigate for a \"Public Identification\" Event:** A thorough search of public records, official biographies, news archives, and statements from his political career (as Deputy Governor, Governor, Vice President, and President of Nigeria) is necessary. The goal is to find a specific declaration, speech, or official document where he introduced or emphasized this part of his name for the first time.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Findings:** The search reveals that \"Azikiwe\" has always been part of his official name.\n    *   His name was listed as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan in official government records from the time he entered public service.\n    *   There is no record of a specific year or event where he \"publicly identified himself\" as Azikiwe as if it were a new identity. He has been publicly and officially \"Azikiwe\" his entire life.\n    *   While he may have referenced his name in speeches, this would not constitute a primary \"identification\" event but rather a reference to his existing, complete name.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Birth Name vs. Adopted Name:** \"Azikiwe\" is not a name he adopted or a nickname he took on later in life. It is one of his given names from birth. This is the most critical point.\n*   **The Nature of \"Public Identification\":** The question is ambiguous. Does it mean the first time the public became widely aware of the name, or the first time he personally uttered it in a major public setting? In either case, the name has been part of his public and official records since he entered politics, making it impossible to pinpoint a single \"first\" year.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** The lack of any news report, press conference, or official statement about him \"adopting\" or \"revealing\" this name is strong evidence that such an event never occurred. He didn't need to; it was always his name.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the premise of the question is incorrect. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan did not have a specific year where he first publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" because that name has been a part of his official, public identity since birth and throughout his entire political career. There was no single event or declaration to mark such an identification.\n\n<<<There is no record of a specific year when Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" for the first time, as \"Azikiwe\" has always been one of his given names from birth and has been part of his official public record throughout his entire life and career.>>>"
