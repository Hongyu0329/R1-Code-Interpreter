    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology in the Question**\n\nThe question asks for a Beatles song that *starts* with a specific chord progression: \"from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\" Let's break down these terms.\n\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale. It's represented as 'I' in a major key (e.g., C Major in the key of C) and 'i' in a minor key (e.g., A minor in the key of A minor).\n*   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord:** This is the crucial part. It refers to a *minor* chord built on the fifth note of the scale. This is represented by the Roman numeral 'v' (a lowercase 'v'). In a major key, the naturally occurring fifth chord is major (V). A minor fifth chord (v) would be a \"borrowed\" chord, often from the parallel minor key, creating a wistful sound. In a minor key, the dominant chord is often made major (V) to create a strong pull back to the tonic (i), but using the naturally occurring minor fifth chord (v) is also common, especially in folk and pop music.\n\nSo, the progression we are looking for is **Tonic → Minor Fifth Chord**, which translates to either **I → v** (in a major key) or **i → v** (in a minor key). We need to find a Beatles song that begins with this exact harmonic movement.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs**\n\nWe will examine the opening chords of several famous Beatles songs to see if they match the required progression.\n\n*   **\"Yesterday\":** Starts on F Major. The progression is F → Em7 → A7 → Dm. This is complex, but the initial move (F to Em7) is from the tonic (I) to the leading-tone chord (vii), not the minor fifth (v).\n*   **\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\":** The main riff and verse start on an E Major chord. The progression is E → D → A. In the key of E, this is I → bVII → IV. This is not the required progression.\n*   **\"Eleanor Rigby\":** The song is in E minor. The string arrangement opens with an E minor chord (the tonic, 'i') followed by a C major chord ('VI'). This is not i → v.\n*   **\"Help!\":** Starts on an A Major chord ('I'). The next chord is a C# minor ('iii'). This is not I → v.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Correct Song and Analyze its Intro**\n\nLet's consider the song **\"Michelle\"** from the 1965 album *Rubber Soul*.\n\n*   **Key:** The song is in the key of F minor.\n*   **Tonic Chord (i):** In the key of F minor, the tonic chord ('i') is **F minor (Fm)**.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** The fifth note of the F minor scale is C. The minor chord built on C is **C minor (Cm)**.\n*   **Introductory Progression:** \"Michelle\" begins with a distinctive instrumental guitar passage. The very first chord played is **F minor (Fm)**. The harmony immediately shifts to a **C minor chord (Cm)**.\n\nTherefore, the opening progression of \"Michelle\" is **Fm → Cm**, which is precisely **i → v**, or a jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the song \"Michelle\" by The Beatles is the one that starts with a chord jump from the tonic (F minor) to the minor fifth chord (C minor).\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
