    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Understand the Group Structure**\n\n*   The group in question is the semidihedral group of size 512. The order is $2^n=512$, so $n=9$. We denote this group as $G = SD_{512}$ or $SD_{2^9}$.\n*   The standard presentation for the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ (for $n \\ge 4$) is:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs^{-1} = r^{-1+2^{n-2}} \\rangle$\n*   For our case, $n=9$, so the order of $r$ is $2^{9-1} = 2^8 = 256$. The relation is $srs^{-1} = r^{-1+2^{9-2}} = r^{-1+128} = r^{127}$.\n*   The group $G=SD_{512}$ is given by $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs^{-1} = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n*   $G$ consists of $512$ elements: $256$ elements in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle \\cong C_{256}$, and $256$ elements of the form $r^i s$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, 255$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\n*   A \"power subgroup\" of a group $G$ is a subgroup that can be expressed as $G^m$ for some integer $m$.\n*   The $m$-th power subgroup, denoted $G^m$, is the subgroup generated by the $m$-th powers of all elements in $G$.\n    $G^m = \\langle g^m \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$\n*   We need to find the number of distinct subgroups in the set $\\{ G^m \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the Power Subgroups $G^m$**\n\nWe need to compute $g^m$ for an arbitrary element $g \\in G$. There are two types of elements.\n\n*   **Case A: $g$ is in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.**\n    Let $g=r^i$. Then $g^m = (r^i)^m = r^{im}$.\n*   **Case B: $g$ is not in $\\langle r \\rangle$.**\n    Let $g=r^i s$. We first compute $(r^i s)^2$:\n    $(r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (s r^i s^{-1}) s^2 = r^i (srs^{-1})^i = r^i (r^{127})^i = r^i r^{127i} = r^{128i}$.\n    Note that $128 = 2^7 = 2^{n-2}$ for $n=9$.\n    So, $(r^i s)^2 = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}}$.\n\nNow we analyze $G^m$ based on the parity of $m$.\n\n*   **If $m$ is odd:** Let $m=2j+1$.\n    *   For elements of type $r^i$: $(r^i)^m = r^{im}$. The set of these generates $\\langle r^m \\rangle$. Since $m$ is odd and the order of $r$ is $256=2^8$, $\\gcd(m, 256)=1$. Thus, $\\langle r^m \\rangle = \\langle r^{\\gcd(m, 256)} \\rangle = \\langle r \\rangle$. This means $r$ itself is in $G^m$.\n    *   For the element $s$ (which is $r^0s$): $s^m=s$ since $m$ is odd. So, $s \\in G^m$.\n    *   Since both generators $r$ and $s$ are in $G^m$, the subgroup they generate, which is $G$ itself, must be contained in $G^m$. So $G \\subseteq G^m$.\n    *   By definition, $G^m \\subseteq G$. Therefore, for any odd integer $m$, $G^m = G$.\n    *   This gives us **one** distinct power subgroup: $G$ itself.\n\n*   **If $m$ is even:** Let $m=2j$.\n    *   For elements of type $r^i$: $(r^i)^m = r^{im}$. These elements generate the subgroup $\\langle r^m \\rangle$.\n    *   For elements of type $r^is$: $g^m = (r^i s)^{2j} = ((r^i s)^2)^j = (r^{i \\cdot 128})^j = r^{128ij}$.\n    *   The subgroup $G^m$ is generated by all these powers:\n        $G^m = \\langle \\{r^{im}\\}_{i=0}^{255} \\cup \\{r^{128ij}\\}_{i=0}^{255} \\rangle = \\langle \\langle r^m \\rangle, \\langle r^{128j} \\rangle \\rangle$.\n    *   The combined generator is $r^d$ where $d = \\gcd(m, 128j)$.\n    *   Since $m=2j$, $d = \\gcd(2j, 128j) = j \\cdot \\gcd(2, 128) = j \\cdot 2 = 2j = m$.\n    *   So, for any even integer $m$, $G^m = \\langle r^m \\rangle$. These are cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nWe have found that the set of all power subgroups of $G=SD_{512}$ is:\n$\\mathcal{P}(G) = \\{G\\} \\cup \\{ \\langle r^m \\rangle \\mid m \\text{ is even} \\}$.\n\nWe need to count the number of unique subgroups in this set.\n\n1.  The subgroup $G=SD_{512}$ is non-abelian, while the subgroups $\\langle r^m \\rangle$ are all cyclic (and thus abelian). So $G$ is distinct from any $\\langle r^m \\rangle$. This gives us 1 subgroup.\n\n2.  Now we must count the number of distinct subgroups of the form $\\langle r^m \\rangle$ where $m$ is even.\n    *   Subgroups of the cyclic group $\\langle r \\rangle \\cong C_{256}$ are of the form $\\langle r^k \\rangle$, where $k$ is a divisor of 256. These subgroups are uniquely determined by their order, which is $256/k$.\n    *   The subgroup generated by $r^m$ is the same as the one generated by $r^{\\gcd(m, 256)}$. So we need to find the possible values of $d = \\gcd(m, 256)$ where $m$ is an even integer.\n    *   Let $m = 2k$ for some integer $k$. We are looking for the possible values of $d = \\gcd(2k, 256)$.\n        $d = \\gcd(2k, 2^8) = 2 \\cdot \\gcd(k, 2^7)$.\n    *   By choosing $k$ appropriately, $\\gcd(k, 2^7)$ can be any divisor of $2^7=128$.\n    *   The divisors of $128$ are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7$. These are the 8 values $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128\\}$.\n    *   Therefore, the possible values for $d$ are $\\{2\\cdot 1, 2\\cdot 2, 2\\cdot 4, \\dots, 2\\cdot 128\\}$.\n    *   This set of values for $d$ is $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\\}$.\n    *   These are the 8 even divisors of 256. Each of these values for $d$ gives a unique subgroup of $\\langle r \\rangle$:\n        $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n    *   There are **8** distinct cyclic power subgroups.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is the sum of the counts from the two cases (odd and even $m$):\n*   1 subgroup from odd $m$ (which is $G$ itself).\n*   8 distinct cyclic subgroups from even $m$.\nTotal number of power subgroups = $1 + 8 = 9$.\n\n<<<9>>>"
