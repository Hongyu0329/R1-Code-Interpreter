    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question\n\nFirst, let's understand the terms and the question itself.\n*   **Graph G:** A set of vertices and edges connecting pairs of vertices.\n*   **Number of vertices:** The graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices.\n*   **Proper colouring:** An assignment of a colour to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same colour.\n*   **Chromatic number $\\chi(G)$:** The minimum number of colours required for a proper colouring of $G$.\n*   **Complete graph $K_n$:** A graph with $n$ vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For $K_n$, we need $n$ distinct colours, so $\\chi(K_n) = n$.\n*   **Condition:** The graph $G$ is not a complete graph, i.e., $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n*   **Mention of $\\Delta(G)$:** The problem statement mentions \"maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$\". Every graph has a maximum degree. This phrase doesn't impose an additional constraint on the graph $G$ itself, other than that it exists. The critical constraint is that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n*   **The Goal:** The question asks for the \"maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly\". This can be a bit ambiguous. It asks for the maximum possible value that the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, can take, given the constraints on $G$. In other words, we need to find:\n    $$ \\max \\{ \\chi(G) \\mid |V(G)| = 12345 \\text{ and } G \\neq K_{12345} \\} $$\n\n### Step 2: Find an upper bound for the chromatic number\n\nLet $G$ be a graph with $n = 12345$ vertices. We are given that $G$ is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_n$).\nThis means that there must exist at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge.\nWe can use this fact to establish an upper bound on $\\chi(G)$.\nThe definition of a proper colouring can be reformulated as partitioning the vertex set $V$ into a number of disjoint independent sets, $V = V_1 \\cup V_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup V_k$. An independent set is a set of vertices where no two vertices are adjacent. All vertices in a given set $V_i$ can be assigned the same colour. The minimum number of such sets is the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$.\n\nSince $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, the set $\\{u,v\\}$ is an independent set. We can place these two vertices in the same independent set, say $V_1$.\nThe remaining $n-2$ vertices can be placed into their own individual sets. Let the remaining vertices be $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_{n-2}$. We can form the following sets:\n*   $V_1 = \\{u, v\\}$\n*   $V_2 = \\{w_1\\}$\n*   $V_3 = \\{w_2\\}$\n*   ...\n*   $V_{n-1} = \\{w_{n-2}\\}$\n\nThese $n-1$ sets form a partition of the entire vertex set $V(G)$. Each of these sets is an independent set by construction ($V_1$ is, as $u,v$ are non-adjacent; the other singleton sets are trivially independent sets).\nThis partition corresponds to a proper colouring of $G$ using $n-1$ colours (one for each set).\nTherefore, the chromatic number of $G$ must be at most $n-1$.\n$$ \\chi(G) \\le n-1 $$\nThis gives us an upper bound for the value we are seeking. The maximum number of colours cannot be more than $n-1 = 12344$.\n\n### Step 3: Show that this upper bound is achievable\n\nNow we need to check if there actually exists a graph $G$ (which is not a complete graph) that requires exactly $n-1$ colours. If we can find such a graph, then the maximum number of colours is indeed $n-1$.\n\nConsider the following graph $G_0$:\nLet $G_0$ be the graph on $n=12345$ vertices constructed as follows:\n1.  Take a complete graph on $n-1=12344$ vertices. Let's call this subgraph $K_{n-1}$.\n2.  Add one more vertex, let's call it $x$.\n3.  Do not add any edges connected to $x$. So, $x$ is an isolated vertex.\nThe resulting graph $G_0$ is the disjoint union of $K_{n-1}$ and a single vertex, which can be written as $G_0 = K_{n-1} \\cup K_1$.\n\nLet's check if this graph $G_0$ meets the problem's conditions:\n*   It has $(n-1)+1=n=12345$ vertices.\n*   It is not a complete graph because the vertex $x$ is not connected to any other vertex. For example, if $v$ is a vertex in the $K_{n-1}$ part, the edge $(v, x)$ does not exist.\n\nNow, let's find the chromatic number of $G_0$, $\\chi(G_0)$.\nThe subgraph $K_{n-1}$ requires $n-1$ distinct colours for its vertices, since every vertex is connected to every other vertex in that subgraph. This means any proper colouring of $G_0$ must use at least $n-1$ colours.\nSo, $\\chi(G_0) \\ge n-1$.\n\nFrom Step 2, we know that for any graph on $n$ vertices that is not complete, the chromatic number is at most $n-1$. So $\\chi(G_0) \\le n-1$.\n\nCombining these two results, we get:\n$$ \\chi(G_0) = n-1 $$\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that:\n1.  Any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not complete can be coloured with at most $n-1$ colours.\n2.  There exists at least one such graph that requires exactly $n-1$ colours.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colours needed is $n-1$.\nGiven $n=12345$, the maximum number of colours is $12345 - 1 = 12344$."
