    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nFirst, we list all the elements classified as noble gases, which are located in Group 18 of the periodic table:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*   Oganesson (Og)\n\n**Step 2: Consider the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\" in the year 2002.\n*   **\"On Earth\"**: This means we are concerned with the natural abundance of these gases on our planet, not in the universe. The primary reservoir for these gases on Earth is the atmosphere.\n*   **\"In 2002\"**: The relative natural abundances of these elements are determined by geological and atmospheric processes over millions of years. They do not change significantly on a year-to-year basis, so data from the early 21st century or today is applicable.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Non-Naturally Occurring Gases**\n*   **Oganesson (Og)** is a synthetic element. It has only been created in a laboratory and does not exist in nature. Therefore, its natural abundance on Earth is zero. While technically the \"rarest,\" questions about natural abundance typically refer to elements that exist naturally, even in trace amounts. We will set this aside and focus on naturally occurring gases.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze and Compare the Abundances of Naturally Occurring Noble Gases**\nWe will now compare the concentrations of the remaining noble gases, primarily in the Earth's atmosphere, where they are most abundant. They are listed here from most common to least common:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** The most abundant noble gas, making up about 0.934% of the Earth's atmosphere.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The next most abundant, with a concentration of about 18.2 parts per million (ppm).\n*   **Helium (He):** Abundance is about 5.2 ppm. While common in the universe, its low mass allows it to escape Earth's gravity. It is continuously replenished by radioactive decay in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Abundance is about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Significantly rarer than the others listed so far, with a concentration of about 0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion).\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Special Case of Radon (Rn)**\n*   **Radon (Rn)** is a naturally occurring gas, but it is radioactive. It is formed from the radioactive decay of radium, which is part of the decay chain of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Key Point:** All isotopes of Radon are extremely unstable. The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. Because it decays so quickly, it never accumulates in the atmosphere to any significant degree. Its concentration is extremely low and variable, but on average, its atmospheric concentration is estimated to be on the order of 1 part per 10^21 (one quintillion).\n\n**Step 6: Final Comparison and Conclusion**\nNow we compare the abundances of the two rarest naturally occurring candidates:\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.087 parts per million (or 87 parts in 1,000,000,000)\n*   **Radon (Rn):** ~1 part per quintillion (1 part in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000)\n\nIt is clear that the concentration of Radon is vastly smaller—by many orders of magnitude—than the concentration of Xenon. Therefore, among all naturally occurring noble gases on Earth, Radon is the rarest.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
