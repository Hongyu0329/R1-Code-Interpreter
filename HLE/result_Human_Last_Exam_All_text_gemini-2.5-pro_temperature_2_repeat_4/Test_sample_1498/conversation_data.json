    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the range of verses (bayts) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that mention the names of the Prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the specific starting and ending verse numbers in Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', where the names of the 25 prophets are listed.\n\n2.  **Context within the Poem:** The poem is a matn (text) that summarizes essential Islamic creed. It is structured logically. Before listing the prophets' names, the author introduces the topic of Prophethood (`al-Nubuwwat`), discusses the attributes of prophets, and specifies the number of prophets whose names a Muslim is required to know.\n\n3.  **Identify the Preceding Verse:** The verse immediately before the list of names sets the stage by mentioning the total number of prophets to be enumerated. This is Bayt 33:\n    *   **Bayt 33:** `تِلْكَ خَمْسَةٌ وَعِشْرُوْنَ لَزِمْ * كُلُّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ`\n    *   **Translation:** \"Those are twenty-five (prophets), it is necessary / For every responsible person (to know them), so verify and seize (this knowledge).\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This verse establishes that the list is about to begin but does not contain any of the names itself. Therefore, it is the setup, not the start of the list.\n\n4.  **Identify the Starting Verse of the List:** The very next verse, Bayt 34, begins the enumeration of the prophets' names.\n    *   **Bayt 34:** `هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ * صَالِحْ وَ اِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ`\n    *   **Translation:** \"They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with / Salih and Ibrahim, each to be followed.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the definitive starting point of the list. It contains the first six names.\n\n5.  **Trace the Verses Containing the Names:** We must follow the poem verse by verse until the list of names is complete.\n    *   **Bayt 35:** Continues the list from the previous verse.\n        `لُوْطٌ وَاِسْمَاعِيْلُ اِسْحَاقُ كَذَا * يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَ اَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى`\n        (Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq as well / Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed suit.)\n    *   **Bayt 36:** Continues the list further.\n        `شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ * ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ`\n        (Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa, and al-Yasa' / Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.)\n\n6.  **Identify the Final Verse of the List:** The list of the 25 prophets concludes in the next verse.\n    *   **Bayt 37:** `اِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا`\n    *   **Translation:** \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya / 'Isa and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the Seal (of prophets), leave deviation.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This verse contains the last names on the list, culminating with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who is referred to as 'Taha' and the 'Seal' (`khātim`). This marks the end of the enumeration. The following verse sends blessings upon them but does not add new names.\n\n7.  **Conclusion of the Range:** The names of the prophets start in Bayt 34 and end in Bayt 37. Therefore, the verses that contain the names are 34, 35, 36, and 37.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Starting Point:** Bayt 34 is the first verse to list the names.\n*   **Ending Point:** Bayt 37 is the last verse to list the names.\n*   **The complete range is from Bayt 34 to Bayt 37.**\n\n<<<From Bayt 34 to Bayt 37>>>"
