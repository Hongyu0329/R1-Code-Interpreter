    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question into Key Clues**\nThe question provides two distinct pieces of information attributed to Jorge Luis Borges to identify a single novel:\n*   **Clue 1 (A Metaphorical Description):** The novel has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n*   **Clue 2 (A Critical Assessment):** The novel's author is described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**2. Analyze Each Clue Separately**\nTo answer accurately, we must trace the origin of each statement.\n\n*   **Analysis of Clue 1: \"Intensity of a tiger and variety of a chess duel\"**\n    *   **Source:** This famous line of praise is from Jorge Luis Borges.\n    *   **Subject:** Borges used this description, or variations of it, to praise the novel **_The Invention of Morel_ (_La invención de Morel_)** by his close friend and collaborator, **Adolfo Bioy Casares**.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The metaphor fits Bioy Casares's work perfectly. His novels are known for their tightly constructed, logical, and intricate plots that unfold with the precision of a game (\"the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"), while also being thrilling and full of suspenseful passion (\"the intensity of a tiger\").\n\n*   **Analysis of Clue 2: Author is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\"**\n    *   **Source:** This is also a well-known critical assessment from Borges.\n    *   **Subject:** Borges applied this description to the Mexican author **Juan Rulfo**, specifically in reference to his masterpiece, **_Pedro Páramo_**.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Juan Rulfo, like many Latin American writers of his generation, was heavily influenced by William Faulkner's narrative techniques, such as fragmented timelines and multiple narrators. However, Rulfo’s style is famously sparse, austere, and concise, in stark contrast to Faulkner’s dense and complex prose. Therefore, Borges's assessment of Rulfo as a \"continuator\" who also \"simplified\" (or purified) Faulkner's style is exceptionally accurate.\n\n**3. Identify the Core Issue**\nThe two clues provided in the question point to **two different novels by two different authors**:\n*   Clue 1 points to **_The Invention of Morel_** by Adolfo Bioy Casares.\n*   Clue 2 points to **_Pedro Páramo_** by Juan Rulfo.\n\nThe question incorrectly conflates two separate statements by Borges and applies them to a single work. There is no novel for which Borges made both of these specific claims.\n\n**4. Determine the Most Likely Intended Answer**\nSince a single answer is required, we must deduce which clue is more likely the intended focus of the question.\n*   The comparison to Faulkner is a profound piece of literary criticism about influence and style that is central to understanding the Latin American Boom.\n*   The \"tiger and chess\" comment is a piece of poetic praise, albeit a famous one.\n*   The Borges-Rulfo-Faulkner connection is a major topic in Hispanic literary studies. Borges’s specific praise for *Pedro Páramo* is often cited as a definitive moment of its canonization. He stated, “*Pedro Páramo* is one of the best novels in Spanish-language literatures, and even in literature.”\n\nGiven the critical weight and specificity of the Faulkner comparison, it is the stronger and more definitive clue. Therefore, the novel the question is most likely aiming for is the one whose author Borges described in relation to Faulkner.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe author Borges called a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is Juan Rulfo, and the novel this assessment refers to is his landmark work, *Pedro Páramo*.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
