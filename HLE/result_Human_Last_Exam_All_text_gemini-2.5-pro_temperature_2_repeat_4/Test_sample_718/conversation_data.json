    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terminology**\n    *   **Upper Semilattice (J):** An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) $(J, \\le)$ in which every pair of elements has a *least upper bound* (or *join*). We can view any poset as a small category where objects are the elements of the poset and there is a unique morphism from $j_1$ to $j_2$ if and only if $j_1 \\le j_2$.\n    *   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$:** This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j_1 \\to j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ to each relation $j_1 \\le j_2$, in a way that respects composition and identities. These functors are the objects of the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n    *   **n-resolvable functor:** A functor $f$ is said to be $n$-resolvable if its *projective dimension* is at most $n$. The projective dimension of an object in an abelian category is the minimum length $n$ of a projective resolution of that object.\n        $$0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$$\n        where each $P_i$ is a projective object in the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$. The question asks for the smallest integer $n$ such that any \"tame\" functor is $n$-resolvable. This value of $n$ corresponds to the supremum of the projective dimensions over all tame functors.\n    *   **Tame functor:** In this context, the word \"tame\" might refer to the representation type of the category or be a condition on the functor itself. However, we will see that the result holds for *any* functor, making this condition superfluous. The key properties are derived from the structure of $J$.\n\n2.  **Connecting the Structure of J to Homological Properties**\n    *   The crucial property of an upper semilattice $J$ is that for any two elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, there exists an element $k \\in J$ (namely their join $k = j_1 \\vee j_2$) such that $j_1 \\le k$ and $j_2 \\le k$.\n    *   A category with this property is called a **directed set** (or a directed category). Thus, any upper semilattice is a directed set.\n\n3.  **Applying a Key Theorem from Homological Algebra**\n    *   The question about the maximum projective dimension of functors is a question about the *global dimension* of the functor category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n    *   The category of functors $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is equivalent to the category of left modules over the category algebra $KJ^{op}$, where $J^{op}$ is the opposite category of $J$. The global dimension of this functor category is therefore the left global dimension of the algebra $KJ^{op}$, denoted $\\text{lgldim}(KJ^{op})$.\n    *   A fundamental theorem in the homological algebra of small categories (due to B. Mitchell) states that the left global dimension of a category algebra $KC$ is at most 1 if the opposite category $C^{op}$ is a directed set.\n        *   Theorem (Mitchell): If $C^{op}$ is a directed set, then $\\text{lgldim}(KC) \\le 1$.\n    *   Let's apply this to our case. We are interested in $\\text{lgldim}(KJ^{op})$. We set $C = J^{op}$ in the theorem. The condition is that $(J^{op})^{op} = J$ must be a directed set.\n    *   As established in the previous step, since $J$ is an upper semilattice, it is a directed set.\n\n4.  **Deriving the Conclusion**\n    *   Since $J$ is a directed set, we can apply the theorem to find that $\\text{lgldim}(K(J^{op})) \\le 1$.\n    *   This means the global dimension of the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is at most 1.\n    *   Consequently, the projective dimension of *any* functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is less than or equal to 1. This includes all \"tame\" functors, regardless of the specific definition of \"tame\".\n    *   So, any tame functor is **1-resolvable**.\n\n5.  **Checking if n can be smaller**\n    *   The question asks for \"what n\", implying the best possible integer bound. Could $n=0$?\n    *   A functor is 0-resolvable if its projective dimension is 0, which means the functor itself is projective.\n    *   However, not all functors on an upper semilattice are projective. For a simple example, consider the lattice $J = \\{0 < 1\\}$. This is an upper semilattice. The simple functor $S_0$, which is $K$ at position 0 and 0 elsewhere, has a projective resolution $0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to S_0 \\to 0$, where $P_j$ are the indecomposable projective functors. The projective dimension of $S_0$ is exactly 1.\n    *   Since there exists at least one functor with projective dimension 1, the value $n=0$ is not sufficient.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe smallest integer $n$ such that any functor (including any tame functor) on an upper semilattice is $n$-resolvable is 1."
