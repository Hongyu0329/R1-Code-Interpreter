    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Components**\n    *   **Goal:** Calculate the \"rule activation level\".\n    *   **System Type:** Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS).\n    *   **Input 1:** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. In a fuzzy rule system, this represents the firing strength or degree of fulfillment of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th rule for a given input `x'`.\n    *   **Input 2:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This represents the membership degree of a specific value `y_j` in the fuzzy set `G_k_j`, which is the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of the rule.\n    *   **Operation:** T-norm. This is a class of functions used in fuzzy logic to model the logical `AND` operation. It is used to combine fuzzy values, typically in the antecedent aggregation or the implication step.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Terminology and Context (Careful Points)**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Ambiguity of \"Rule Activation Level\"**\n        *   The term \"rule activation level\" (or firing strength/level) most commonly refers to the result of evaluating the rule's antecedent, which is given as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n        *   However, the question asks to *calculate* this level *using* both `Phi_k(x′)` and `μG_k_j(y_j)` with a t-norm. This strongly suggests that the question is not asking for the antecedent firing strength itself, but for the result of the next step in the inference process: **implication**. The implication step combines the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's fuzzy set to produce the output fuzzy set for that rule. The result of this calculation gives the membership grade for the output of that single rule.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Inconsistency with \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\"**\n        *   An Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set is a highly complex construct where membership grades are themselves Type-2 fuzzy sets. A true calculation in an IT3 system would involve operations on Type-2 FSs, not simple scalar numbers like 0.7 and 0.9.\n        *   Therefore, the mention of \"Interval Type-3\" is likely contextual flavor or an error in the question's formulation. To arrive at a numerical answer, we must assume the problem is simplified to the framework of a Type-1 fuzzy system for the purpose of this specific calculation.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Unspecified T-norm**\n        *   The question specifies a \"t-norm\" but does not state which one (e.g., minimum, product, Łukasiewicz).\n        *   In fuzzy inference systems, especially the common Mamdani-type, the **minimum** t-norm is the most standard and widely used operator for the implication step. We will proceed assuming the minimum t-norm is intended.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nBased on the careful points above, we will interpret the question as asking for the result of the implication step in a simplified, Type-1 fuzzy rule framework, using the minimum t-norm.\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Antecedent Firing Strength.**\n    This is the overall activation level of the \"IF\" part of the rule.\n    `Antecedent Firing Strength (α) = Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the Consequent's Original Membership Value.**\n    This is the membership degree of the output `y_j` in the \"THEN\" part of the rule *before* it is modified by the antecedent's strength.\n    `Consequent Membership (β) = μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\n*   **Step 3: Apply the T-norm for Implication.**\n    The fuzzy implication calculates the output fuzzy set of the rule. For a specific output value `y_j`, its membership in the final output set is calculated by applying the t-norm to the antecedent strength and the original consequent membership.\n    `Result = T-norm(α, β)`\n\n*   **Step 4: Perform the Calculation with the Assumed T-norm.**\n    Assuming the standard **minimum** t-norm, which corresponds to Mamdani implication (\"clipping\" the consequent fuzzy set).\n    `Result = min(α, β) = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Calculation.**\n    `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\nThe resulting value of 0.7 is the membership grade of `y_j` in the output fuzzy set generated by this specific rule. This is the \"activated\" value of the consequent at that point.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
