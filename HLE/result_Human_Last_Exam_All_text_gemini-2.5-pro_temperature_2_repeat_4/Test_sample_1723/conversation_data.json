    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for the name of a *single genus* of mushroom. The key characteristics are that it is the *only* genus known to produce a *distinctly blue spore print*.\n\n*   **Genus:** This is a specific taxonomic rank, broader than species but more specific than family.\n*   **Mushroom:** This generally refers to the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground.\n*   **Spore Print:** This is a critical mycological identification tool. It's the macroscopic pattern formed when spores fall from the gills or pores onto a surface. The color of the spore print is a key feature.\n*   **Distinctly Blue:** The color is specified as blue. This is a very rare color for a spore print.\n*   **Single Genus:** The question implies that only one genus fits this description, making it a unique identifier.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Common Misconceptions\nMany fungi are blue, but their spore prints are not. It's crucial to distinguish the color of the mushroom itself (the fruiting body) from the color of its collected spores.\n\n*   ***Lactarius indigo*** **(Blue Milk Mushroom):** This mushroom is a striking indigo blue and even \"bleeds\" blue latex when cut. However, its spore print is cream to pale yellow. Therefore, *Lactarius* is not the correct genus.\n*   ***Entoloma hochstetteri*** **(New Zealand Blue Mushroom):** This is another famously vibrant blue mushroom, so much so that it's featured on a New Zealand banknote. Despite its intense blue color, its spore print is pinkish or salmon-colored, which is characteristic of the *Entoloma* genus.\n*   ***Terana caerulea*** **(Cobalt Crust Fungus):** This is a brilliant blue crust fungus, but its spore print is white. Also, it's a crust fungus, not typically what is meant by \"mushroom\" in a general context.\n\n### Step 3: Investigating the Correct Genus\nThe actual answer to this classic mycology question is more nuanced. While most mushrooms have spore prints that are white, cream, pink, brown, or black, a true blue spore print is virtually non-existent or extremely subtle.\n\nThe genus that is the accepted answer to this question is **Entoloma**. Here's the careful point:\n\n*   The vast majority of species in the large genus *Entoloma* have a characteristic pink or salmon-pink spore print.\n*   However, mycological literature notes that a few specific species within this genus, particularly in the subgenus *Leptonia* (e.g., *Entoloma chalybaeum*), can produce spore prints that have a distinct \"greyish-blue\" or \"lilac\" tinge when they are very fresh and moist.\n*   While not the vibrant, sky-blue one might imagine, this subtle bluish coloration in the spore deposit is a documented phenomenon unique to this group. No other genus of gilled mushrooms is known to exhibit this characteristic.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nBased on the evidence from technical mycological sources, while the premise of a \"distinctly blue\" spore print might be a slight exaggeration for a trivia question, the only genus of mushrooms where a blueish tint in the spore print has been officially noted is **Entoloma**.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
