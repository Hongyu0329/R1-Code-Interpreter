    "This question asks to identify the most likely mechanism responsible for keeping duplicated genes in the genome (retention) and for them becoming different from each other over time (divergence). Let's break down the process and evaluate each option.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial State: Gene Duplication.** The process starts when a gene is accidentally copied, resulting in two identical copies in the genome. Initially, this is redundant. One copy is enough to perform the original function. The second copy is now released from purifying selection, meaning it can accumulate mutations without necessarily harming the organism.\n\n2.  **Possible Fates of the Duplicate.** What happens to this second copy?\n    *   **Loss:** It can accumulate mutations that make it non-functional. This is called **pseudogenization**. This is the most common outcome, but it results in loss, not retention.\n    *   **Retention:** For the copy to be kept, there must be some selective advantage to having two copies. The question focuses on mechanisms that lead to retention and divergence.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Mechanisms (Answer Choices):**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where a DNA region is copied from one homologous sequence to another, making them identical. This mechanism actively works *against* divergence between duplicate genes by homogenizing them. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a gene copy becomes non-functional. This leads to the *loss* of the functional duplicate, not its retention. So, this is the opposite of the phenomenon described in the question. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This is a key model for gene duplication. One copy retains the original function, while the second (duplicate) copy accumulates mutations and evolves a new, beneficial function. Natural selection will then preserve this new gene. This process clearly explains both **retention** (because the new function is useful) and **divergence** (the sequence changes to support the new function). This is a valid mechanism.\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This is the other major model. It proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex regulation (e.g., it was active in different tissues). After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that inactivate different sub-functions. For instance, one copy might lose the ability to function in tissue A but keeps functioning in tissue B, while the other copy loses the ability to function in tissue B but keeps functioning in tissue A. Now, both genes are necessary to fulfill the original set of tasks. This process also explains both **retention** (as both copies are now required) and **divergence** (as they have lost complementary functions and their sequences differ). This is also a valid mechanism.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This term describes a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single lineage diversifies rapidly to fill many different ecological roles. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is a species-level phenomenon, not the direct molecular mechanism responsible for retaining a single gene. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Comparing Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D):**\n    We are left with two correct mechanisms. The question asks for the **\"most likely\"** one. To decide, we must consider the probability of the events required for each mechanism.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** requires the occurrence of a rare event: a mutation or series of mutations that create a *brand new, beneficial function*. Until that rare event happens, the duplicate gene is at high risk of being lost to pseudogenization.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization** relies on much more common events: neutral or slightly deleterious *loss-of-function* mutations. The model works if degenerative mutations happen in a complementary way in the two copies. Because loss-of-function mutations are much more frequent than beneficial gain-of-function mutations, subfunctionalization provides a more passive and highly probable route for the initial preservation of duplicate genes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are important mechanisms for the evolution of duplicated genes, subfunctionalization is considered \"more likely\" to be responsible for the initial retention because it relies on more common types of mutations (loss-of-function) to protect both copies from being lost. It provides a stable state where both genes are maintained, allowing for further divergence or even later neofunctionalization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
