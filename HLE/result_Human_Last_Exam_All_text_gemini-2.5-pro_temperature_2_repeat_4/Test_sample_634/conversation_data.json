    "This problem requires finding the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Concept of GCRD**\nLet P1(s) and P2(s) be two polynomial matrices. A polynomial matrix G(s) is a **common right divisor** if there exist polynomial matrices Q1(s) and Q2(s) such that P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s) and P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s).\nG(s) is a **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)** if any other common right divisor D(s) is a right divisor of G(s) (i.e., G(s) = L(s)D(s) for some polynomial matrix L(s)). The GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant).\n\n**2. Method of Calculation: Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\nWe can find the GCRD by applying elementary row operations to a composite matrix formed by stacking P1 and P2. The goal is to reduce this matrix to a form where the lower rows are all zeros. The remaining non-zero rows form the GCRD.\nThe elementary row operations are:\n*   Swapping two rows.\n*   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n*   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\n**3. Define the Matrices and Form the Composite Matrix**\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2]\n\nP2 = [s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\nWe form the 4x2 composite matrix M(s):\nM(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] =\n  [ s^2 + s,  -s     ]   (R1)\n  [-s^2 - 1,   s^2    ]   (R2)\n  [ s,        0      ]   (R3)\n  [-s - 1,    1      ]   (R4)\n\n**4. Perform Row Reduction**\nThe process aims to simplify M(s) to the form [G(s); 0], where G(s) is the GCRD.\n\n*   **Point of Caution 1: Choose pivots wisely.** It's often easier to use rows with lower-degree polynomials or constant entries as pivots.\n    Row 3, `[s, 0]`, has the lowest degree polynomial in the first column. We use it to simplify R1 and R2.\n\n    *   `R1 -> R1 - (s+1) * R3`:\n        [s^2+s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s^2+s - s(s+1), -s] = [0, -s]\n    *   `R2 -> R2 + s * R3`:\n        [-s^2-1, s^2] + s[s, 0] = [-s^2-1 + s^2, s^2] = [-1, s^2]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n      [   0,     -s   ]\n      [  -1,     s^2  ]\n      [   s,      0   ]\n      [ -s-1,     1   ]\n\n*   **Point of Caution 2: Leverage constant pivots.** The new row `[-1, s^2]` has a constant `-1` in the first column, which makes an excellent pivot. Let's move it to the top.\n\n    *   Swap the first and second rows:\n      [  -1,     s^2  ]  (New R1)\n      [   0,     -s   ]  (New R2)\n      [   s,      0   ]  (New R3)\n      [ -s-1,     1   ]  (New R4)\n\n    *   Now, use the new R1 to eliminate the first element in R3 and R4.\n        *   `R3 -> R3 + s * R1`: [s, 0] + s[-1, s^2] = [0, s^3]\n        *   `R4 -> R4 - (s+1) * R1`: [-s-1, 1] - (s+1)[-1, s^2] = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n      [  -1,       s^2        ]\n      [   0,        -s         ]\n      [   0,        s^3        ]\n      [   0,   1 - s^3 - s^2    ]\n\n*   **Point of Caution 3: Apply Euclidean algorithm to single columns.** We now focus on rows 2, 3, and 4. We can use row operations corresponding to the Euclidean algorithm for the polynomials in the second column: `-s`, `s^3`, and `1 - s^3 - s^2`.\n\n    *   `R3 -> R3 + s^2 * R2`: [0, s^3] + s^2[0, -s] = [0, 0]\n    *   `R4 -> R4 - (s^2 + s) * R2`:\n        We divide `(1 - s^3 - s^2)` by `-s`. The quotient is `s^2 + s` and the remainder is `1`. This division corresponds to the row operation.\n        [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2] - (s^2 + s)[0, -s] = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2 + s^3 + s^2] = [0, 1]\n\n    The matrix is now:\n      [ -1,   s^2  ]\n      [  0,   -s   ]\n      [  0,    0   ]\n      [  0,    1   ]\n\n*   **Point of Caution 4: Final cleanup for canonical form.** The row `[0, 1]` is a perfect pivot to simplify the rest of the matrix.\n\n    *   Swap R2 and R4:\n      [ -1,   s^2  ]\n      [  0,    1   ]\n      [  0,    0   ]\n      [  0,   -s   ]\n\n    *   Use the new R2 (`[0, 1]`) to eliminate other entries in the second column.\n        *   `R1 -> R1 - s^2 * R2`: [-1, s^2] - s^2[0, 1] = [-1, 0]\n        *   `R4 -> R4 + s * R2`: [0, -s] + s[0, 1] = [0, 0]\n\n    The matrix is fully reduced to:\n      [ -1,   0  ]\n      [  0,   1  ]\n      [  0,   0  ]\n      [  0,   0  ]\n\n**5. Final Answer Derivation**\nThe GCRD is the non-zero part of the reduced matrix:\nG(s) = [ -1, 0 ;\n          0, 1 ]\n\n*   **Point of Caution 5: Uniqueness and canonical forms.** The GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix. The determinant of our resulting G(s) is -1, which is a non-zero constant, so G(s) is unimodular. This means the original matrices P1 and P2 are **right coprime**.\n    Any unimodular matrix is a valid GCRD in this case. By convention, the GCRD is often given in a canonical form, such as row-reduced echelon form. To achieve this form, we make the leading coefficient of each row equal to 1.\n    *   `R1 -> -1 * R1`: -1 * [-1, 0] = [1, 0]\n    This gives the final canonical GCRD:\n    G_final(s) = [ 1, 0 ;\n                   0, 1 ]\nThis is the identity matrix, which is the most common representation for a unimodular GCRD.\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
