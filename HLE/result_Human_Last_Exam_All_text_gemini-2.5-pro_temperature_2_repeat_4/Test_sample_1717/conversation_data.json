    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Stats:** First, we need to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the game's data, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 2,800 in Normal Mode. In Expert Mode, its health is increased to 3,640. This value is our starting point.\n\n2.  **Understand Multiplayer Health Scaling:** In Terraria, the health of bosses increases when there are multiple players in the world. For Expert Mode, the health scaling formula is different and more significant than in Normal Mode. The source code specifies that a boss's health is increased by 35% for each player beyond the first one.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Health Calculation:** Let `H` be the total health and `N` be the number of players. The formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode can be expressed as:\n    `H = BaseExpertHealth * (1 + (N - 1) * 0.35)`\n    Plugging in the base health value:\n    `H(N) = 3640 * (1 + (N - 1) * 0.35)`\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players (`N -> ∞`). If we evaluate this purely mathematically, as `N` approaches infinity, the term `(N - 1)` also approaches infinity. This would cause the total health `H(N)` to approach infinity as well.\n    `lim (N->∞) [3640 * (1 + (N - 1) * 0.35)] = ∞`\n\n5.  **Consider the Game's Technical Limitations:** A video game does not operate with infinite numbers. All values, such as health, are stored in variables of a specific data type, which have a maximum value. In Terraria's source code (which is written in C#), an NPC's health (`life` and `lifeMax`) is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n\n6.  **Identify the Technical Maximum:** The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is `2^31 - 1`. This evaluates to `2,147,483,647`. No matter how high the number of players is or what the health formula calculates, the health value stored in the game cannot exceed this technical limit. If the calculation were to result in a higher number, it would be capped at this value or cause an integer overflow (which usually results in a negative value, effectively a bug). Therefore, the \"theoretical maximum\" health within the confines of the game's source code is the maximum value of a 32-bit integer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWhile the mathematical formula for health scaling trends towards infinity with an infinite number of players, the game engine's limitation imposes a hard cap. The health stat is stored in a 32-bit signed integer, limiting its maximum possible value.\n\nThe theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is **2,147,483,647**.\n\n<<<2,147,483,647>>>"
