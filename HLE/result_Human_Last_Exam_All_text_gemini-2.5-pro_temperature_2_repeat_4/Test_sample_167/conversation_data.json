    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ with two properties:\n1.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is less than $k$, i.e., $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all $v \\in V(G)$.\n2.  The number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, $|EE(G)|$, is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges, $|EO(G)|$. Let's call this the *AT-condition*.\n    (Note: The definitions of $EE$ and $EO$ are sometimes given with respect to the orientation $D$, which is an equivalent condition. We will denote an orientation satisfying the AT-condition as an *AT-orientation*).\n\nFrom the definition, we can derive an equivalent formula:\n$AT(G) = 1 + \\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\mid D \\text{ is an AT-orientation of } G \\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the graph $K_{1000,1000}$**\n\n*   $G = K_{1000,1000}$ is a complete bipartite graph with two sets of vertices, say $A$ and $B$, where $|A|=|B|=1000$.\n*   The total number of vertices is $|V| = 2000$.\n*   The total number of edges is $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   The graph is a regular graph because every vertex has a degree of 1000.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Eulerian orientations of $K_{1000,1000}$**\n\nA graph has an Eulerian orientation (one where $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$ for all vertices $v$) if and only if the degree of every vertex is even. In $K_{1000,1000}$, every vertex has degree 1000, which is even. Thus, it admits an Eulerian orientation, let's call it $D_{euler}$.\nFor such an orientation, $d_{D_{euler}}^+(v) = d_{D_{euler}}^-(v) = 1000 / 2 = 500$ for all vertices $v$.\n\n**Step 4: Check if an Eulerian orientation satisfies the AT-condition**\n\nThere is a theorem by Tapper which states that for an Eulerian orientation of a $d$-regular graph (with $d$ even), the AT-condition is satisfied if and only if the number of Hamiltonian cycles in the graph is odd.\n\n*   We need to determine the parity of the number of Hamiltonian cycles in $K_{1000,1000}$.\n*   The number of Hamiltonian cycles in $K_{m,m}$ is given by the formula $\\frac{m!(m-1)!}{2}$.\n*   For $m=1000$, the number is $\\frac{1000! \\cdot 999!}{2}$.\n*   For any integer $n \\ge 4$, $n!$ is divisible by 4. Thus, $1000!$ is divisible by 4.\n*   This means $1000! \\cdot 999!$ is divisible by 4, so $\\frac{1000! \\cdot 999!}{2}$ is an even number.\n*   Since the number of Hamiltonian cycles is even, by Tapper's theorem, any Eulerian orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$ does **not** satisfy the AT-condition.\n\n**Step 5: Derive a lower bound for the Alon-Tarsi number**\n\n*   Let $D$ be any AT-orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$. From Step 4, we know that $D$ cannot be an Eulerian orientation.\n*   The sum of the out-degrees in any orientation is equal to the total number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E| = 1,000,000$.\n*   The average out-degree is $\\frac{\\sum d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n*   Since $D$ is not Eulerian, the out-degrees are not all equal to 500. Because the average of the out-degrees is 500, there must be at least one vertex with out-degree strictly greater than 500.\n*   Since out-degrees are integers, this means for any AT-orientation $D$, we must have $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge 501$.\n*   Using the formula from Step 1, this implies $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + \\min\\{\\dots\\} \\ge 1 + 501 = 502$.\n*   So, we have a lower bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 502$.\n\n**Step 6: Derive an upper bound for the Alon-Tarsi number**\n\n*   We need to find a specific AT-orientation $D$ and calculate its maximum out-degree.\n*   Let's construct an orientation. Start with an Eulerian orientation $D_{euler}$, for which we know $d_{D_{euler}}^+(v) = 500$ for all vertices.\n*   Now, create a new orientation $D$ by reversing a single edge of $D_{euler}$. Let the original edge be $(u,v)$ in $D_{euler}$. In $D$, this edge is $(v,u)$.\n*   Let's check the out-degrees in this new orientation $D$:\n    *   For vertex $u$, the out-degree decreases by 1: $d_D^+(u) = 500 - 1 = 499$.\n    *   For vertex $v$, the out-degree increases by 1: $d_D^+(v) = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n    *   For all other vertices $w$, the out-degree remains unchanged: $d_D^+(w) = 500$.\n*   The maximum out-degree in our constructed orientation $D$ is $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 501$.\n*   Now, we check if this orientation $D$ satisfies the AT-condition. There is a theorem (by Alon, and also Kaul) which states that any orientation obtained from an Eulerian one by reversing a non-empty set of edges is an AT-orientation. Our orientation $D$ fits this criterion.\n*   So, we have found an AT-orientation $D$ with $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 501$.\n*   Using the formula from Step 1 again, this gives an upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 1 + \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 1 + 501 = 502$.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\n\nFrom Step 5, we have the lower bound $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 502$.\nFrom Step 6, we have the upper bound $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 502$.\nCombining these two results, we must have an equality.\n\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is 502.\n\n<<<502>>>"
