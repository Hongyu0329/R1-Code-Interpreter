    "This is a problem in number theory concerning Dirichlet characters. To solve it, we need to understand the properties of Dirichlet characters, especially how their conductor and order are determined when they are formed as a product of characters of simpler moduli.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the given conductor $d = 53599$.\n$d = 53599 = 7 \\times 7657$\n$7657 = 13 \\times 589$\n$589 = 19 \\times 31$\nSo, the prime factorization is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThis is a square-free integer, which simplifies the problem.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet character**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ (where $p_i$ are distinct primes) can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi_{p_i}$ modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$,\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conditions on $\\chi$**\n\nWe are given two conditions on $\\chi$:\n1.  **$\\chi$ is a primitive character of conductor $d$**: For a character $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_{p_i}$ with a square-free modulus $d = \\prod p_i$, the conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its components: $cond(\\chi) = \\prod cond(\\chi_{p_i})$. For $cond(\\chi)$ to be equal to $d$, the conductor of each component $\\chi_p$ must be $p$. A character $\\chi_p$ modulo a prime $p$ has conductor $p$ if and only if it is a non-principal (non-trivial) character. This means the order of each $\\chi_p$ must be greater than 1.\n    $ord(\\chi_p) > 1$ for $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\n\n2.  **The order of $\\chi$ is 6**: The order of a product character $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_{p_i}$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components.\n    $ord(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(ord(\\chi_7), ord(\\chi_{13}), ord(\\chi_{19}), ord(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the orders of the component characters**\n\nFrom the lcm condition, the order of each component character, $ord(\\chi_p)$, must be a divisor of 6.\nSo, $ord(\\chi_p) \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\nCombining this with the condition from primitivity ($ord(\\chi_p) > 1$), the possible orders for each component character are:\n$ord(\\chi_p) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. For a character of a certain order to exist, its order must divide $\\phi(p)$.\nLet's check this for our primes:\n*   For $p=7$, $\\phi(7) = 6$. The orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ are all divisors of 6.\n*   For $p=13$, $\\phi(13) = 12$. The orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ are all divisors of 12.\n*   For $p=19$, $\\phi(19) = 18$. The orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ are all divisors of 18.\n*   For $p=31$, $\\phi(31) = 30$. The orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ are all divisors of 30.\nSo, characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 exist for each of the prime moduli.\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of component characters of each required order**\n\nIn a cyclic group of order $N$, the number of elements of order $k$ (for $k|N$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$. The group of characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p)$, so this rule applies.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 2$.\n\nFor each prime factor $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, we have 1 character of order 2, 2 characters of order 3, and 2 characters of order 6.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the counts using combinatorics**\n\nWe need to find the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ where their orders $(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31})$ satisfy:\n1.  $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ for each $p$.\n2.  $\\text{lcm}(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}) = 6$.\n\nWe can solve this using complementary counting.\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose one character $\\chi_p$ for each prime $p$ such that its order is in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. For each of the four primes, the number of available characters is:\nNumber of choices = (chars of order 2) + (chars of order 3) + (chars of order 6)\nNumber of choices = $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\nSince there are 4 prime factors, the total number of tuples of characters where each component character has an order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we must subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6. The lcm of numbers from $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ can only be 2, 3, or 6. We need to exclude cases where the lcm is 2 or 3.\n\n*   **Case A: The lcm is 2.**\n    This occurs if and only if all component orders $o_p$ are 2. For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2.\n    Number of such tuples = $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n*   **Case B: The lcm is 3.**\n    This occurs if and only if all component orders $o_p$ are 3. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3.\n    Number of such tuples = $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ and order 6 is the total number of combinations from our pool minus those where the order is not 6.\nNumber of characters = (Total combinations) - (Combinations with order 2) - (Combinations with order 3)\nNumber of characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n1. Conductor $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n2. Character decomposition: $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$.\n3. Primitive condition: $ord(\\chi_p) > 1$ for all $p$.\n4. Order 6 condition: $\\text{lcm}(ord(\\chi_7), ord(\\chi_{13}), ord(\\chi_{19}), ord(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n5. This forces $ord(\\chi_p) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ for all $p$.\n6. For each prime $p$, the number of characters of order $k \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$ is $\\phi(k)$: $\\phi(2)=1, \\phi(3)=2, \\phi(6)=2$.\n7. Total ways to pick characters with orders in $\\{2,3,6\\}$ for each of the 4 primes is $(1+2+2)^4 = 5^4 = 625$.\n8. Subtract cases where lcm is not 6:\n   - lcm=2: all orders must be 2. Number of ways = $1^4 = 1$.\n   - lcm=3: all orders must be 3. Number of ways = $2^4 = 16$.\n9. Final count = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$."
