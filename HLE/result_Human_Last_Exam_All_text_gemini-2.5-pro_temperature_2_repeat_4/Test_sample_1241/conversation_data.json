    "This problem requires finding the steady-state probabilities of a continuous-time Markov chain defined by the Kolmogorov-Chapman system of equations. Let $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ denote the steady-state probability of the system being in state $i$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Concept of Steady State**\n\nIn the steady state (as $t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities of being in each state no longer change with time. This implies that the derivatives of the probabilities with respect to time become zero.\n$P_{0}'(t) \\to 0$, $P_{1}'(t) \\to 0$, $P_{2}'(t) \\to 0$, $P_{3}'(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to +\\infty$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\n\nBy setting the derivatives to zero, the given system of differential equations transforms into a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$:\n(i) $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n(ii) $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n(iii) $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n(iv) $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n\nWe also have the normalization condition, which states that the sum of all probabilities must equal 1:\n(v) $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The system of equations (i) to (iv) is linearly dependent. Adding them up results in $0=0$. Therefore, we must use the normalization equation (v) to obtain a unique solution. We will use equations (i), (iii), (iv), and (v) to solve the system.\n\n**3. Substitute the Given Rate Constants**\n\nThe given values are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nSubstituting these into our chosen equations:\n(i) $0 = -0.019 p_0 + 0.65 p_1$\n(iii) $0 = 0.4 p_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) p_2 \\implies 0 = 0.4 p_1 - 0.4 p_2$\n(iv) $0 = 0.008 p_2 - 0.008 p_3$\n(v) $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n\n**4. Solve the System of Algebraic Equations**\n\nOur goal is to find the values of $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$. It is often easiest to express three of the probabilities in terms of the fourth one. Let's express $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$.\n\n*   From equation (iv):\n    $0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_2 = p_3$\n\n*   From equation (iii):\n    $0.4 p_1 = 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_1 = p_2$\n\n*   Combining these results, we get a simple relationship:\n    $p_1 = p_2 = p_3$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Noticing simple relationships like this can significantly simplify the algebra.\n\n*   From equation (i):\n    $0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1 \\implies p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$\n\nNow, substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (v):\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1\\right) + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 \\right) = 1$\n\nNow, we solve for $p_1$:\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n$p_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Required Value**\n\nThe question asks for the sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = p_0 + p_1$.\n\nFirst, find $p_0$:\n$p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\left(\\frac{0.019}{0.707}\\right) = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nNow, compute the sum $p_0 + p_1$:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707}$\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Keep calculations in fractional form as long as possible to avoid intermediate rounding errors.\n\n**6. Final Numerical Calculation**\n\nFinally, we compute the decimal value of the fraction:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} = \\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nLet's round the answer to a reasonable number of decimal places, for instance, five.\n$P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) \\approx 0.94625$\n\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
