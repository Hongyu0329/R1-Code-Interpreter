    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for the \"earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas in the aboriginal writing system.\" Let's break down the key elements:\n*   **Earliest known date:** This refers to the oldest chronological record we have discovered. This can be interpreted in two ways: 1) the oldest physical artifact on which a date is written, or 2) the earliest historical date that is written down.\n*   **Recorded:** The date must be physically written or inscribed using a native script, not just inferred from astronomy or oral history.\n*   **Pre-Columbian civilization:** Cultures that flourished in the Americas before 1492.\n*   **Aboriginal writing system:** The script must be native to the Americas, such as Zapotec, Epi-Olmec, or Maya hieroglyphs.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Candidate Civilizations and Their Records\nThree Mesoamerican civilizations are primary contenders for the earliest writing and date-keeping: the Zapotecs, the Epi-Olmecs, and the Maya.\n\n*   **The Maya:** The Maya are famous for their Long Count calendar, which can pinpoint a specific day over a cycle of more than 5,000 years. For a long time, the earliest known *Maya* Long Count date was on Tikal Stela 29, corresponding to 292 CE. However, earlier evidence of Maya writing and date-keeping has been found at San Bartolo, Guatemala. Murals there contain a clear inscription of the day name \"7 Deer\" from the 260-day calendar, with associated materials radiocarbon dated to approximately **300-200 BCE**.\n\n*   **The Epi-Olmec:** This culture, which succeeded the Olmecs, also used the Long Count calendar. Stela C from the site of Tres Zapotes contains a Long Count date of 7.16.6.16.18. This correlates precisely to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar. This is the earliest known *Long Count* date, which records a specific, non-repeating day in history.\n\n*   **The Zapotec:** The Zapotecs, centered in the Oaxaca Valley, developed one of the earliest writing systems in Mesoamerica. At the early Zapotec center of San José Mogote, archaeologists discovered a carved stone monument known as Monument 3. This monument, depicting a slain captive, includes a glyph between the figure's legs. This glyph is interpreted as the day name \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar. The crucial point is that based on archaeological and stylistic evidence, Monument 3 is dated to approximately **600 BCE**.\n\n### Step 3: Comparing the Evidence and Careful Points\nNow we must compare these findings to determine which one is the \"earliest.\"\n\n*   **Distinguishing between types of dates:** The Zapotec and early Maya examples record a day name from the 260-day ritual calendar (e.g., \"1 Earthquake\" or \"7 Deer\"). This calendar is cyclical, meaning the date \"1 Earthquake\" repeats every 260 days. The Epi-Olmec example from Stela C, however, uses the Long Count, a linear system that specifies a unique historical day.\n*   **Interpreting \"earliest known date recorded\":**\n    *   If this means the oldest *artifact* with a date inscription, the Zapotec **Monument 3 from ~600 BCE** is the winner. It is the earliest physical evidence of a day being recorded in writing in the Americas.\n    *   If this means the earliest *specific historical date* that can be correlated to our own calendar, the Epi-Olmec Stela C date of **32 BCE** is the answer.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe most direct and widely accepted answer to the question \"What is the earliest known date recorded?\" refers to the oldest surviving instance of a date being written down. The Zapotec record is significantly older than any other. While it records a cyclical date, it is still a formally recorded date within an established calendrical and writing system. The act of recording the day \"1 Earthquake\" happened around 600 BCE, making this the earliest known example of calendrical writing in the Americas.\n\nTherefore, the earliest recorded date is the day name **\"1 Earthquake,\"** which was inscribed by the Zapotecs on Monument 3 at San José Mogote around 600 BCE.\n\n<<<The earliest known recorded date is the day name \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day ritual calendar. This date was inscribed on Monument 3 at the Zapotec site of San José Mogote, Oaxaca, Mexico, around 600 BCE.>>>"
