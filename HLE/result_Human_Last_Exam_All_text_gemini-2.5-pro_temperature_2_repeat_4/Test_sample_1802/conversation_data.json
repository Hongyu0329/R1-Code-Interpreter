    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Step 1: Define a Pauli Channel\nA qudit is a quantum system with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H} \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$.\nThe generalized Pauli operators (or discrete Weyl-Heisenberg operators) are a set of $d^2$ unitary operators $\\{U_{ab} = X_a Z_b\\}_{a,b=0}^{d-1}$ that form an orthogonal basis for the space of linear operators $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H})$. The operators $X_a$ and $Z_b$ are defined by their action on the computational basis $\\{|k\\rangle\\}_{k=0}^{d-1}$:\n*   $X_a |k\\rangle = |(k+a) \\pmod d\\rangle$ (shift operator)\n*   $Z_b |k\\rangle = \\omega^{bk} |k\\rangle$ (phase operator), where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / d}$.\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel whose action on a density matrix $\\rho$ is given by:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} \\rho U_{ab}^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ is a probability distribution, i.e., $p_{ab} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} = 1$.\nThe operators $A_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$ are the Kraus operators of the channel $\\Lambda$. The rank of the channel $\\Lambda$, denoted $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda)$, is the number of linearly independent Kraus operators. This corresponds to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{ab}$. Let's denote this number by $K$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_i A_i \\rho A_i^\\dagger$ can be described using a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometry $V$ from the system Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S$ to a combined system-environment space $\\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe isometry $V$ is defined as $V|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_i (A_i|\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |i\\rangle_E$, where $\\{|i\\rangle_E\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is the number of Kraus operators in the chosen representation, which we can take to be $K$, the rank of $\\Lambda$.\n\nThe complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ describes the evolution of the environment state and is defined by tracing over the system instead of the environment:\n$$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger) $$\nThe map $\\Lambda^c$ takes an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_S$ to an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_E$.\nLet's compute the explicit form of $\\Lambda^c(\\rho)$. The Kraus operators are $A_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$. For simplicity, let's use a single index $k$ to represent the pair $(a,b)$, so $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$, where $\\{U_k\\}_{k=1}^{d^2}$ is the set of Pauli operators. Let $S_p = \\{k | p_k > 0\\}$ be the set of indices for which the probability is non-zero, and let $|S_p|=K$.\nThe output of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ acting on $\\rho$ is a $K \\times K$ matrix acting on $\\mathcal{H}_E$, whose elements are given by:\n$$ (\\Lambda^c(\\rho))_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(A_k \\rho A_l^\\dagger) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(\\rho U_l^\\dagger U_k) $$\nfor $k, l \\in S_p$.\n\nThe rank of a channel is a well-defined quantity, which can be determined from its Choi-Jamiolkowski matrix. However, a more direct approach relies on a key result that relates the rank of the complementary channel to the operator space spanned by products of its Kraus operators.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Rank Formula for Complementary Channels\nFor a channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$, the rank of its complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is given by the dimension of the linear space spanned by the operator products $\\{A_j^\\dagger A_k\\}$.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\dim\\left(\\text{span}\\{A_j^\\dagger A_k\\}_{j,k}\\right) $$\nFor our Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, the Kraus operators are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$ for $k \\in S_p$. The products are:\n$$ A_j^\\dagger A_k = (\\sqrt{p_j} U_j)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_k} U_k) = \\sqrt{p_j p_k} U_j^\\dagger U_k $$\nSince $\\sqrt{p_j p_k}$ are just scalar coefficients and are non-zero for all $j, k \\in S_p$, the dimension of the span is determined by the operator parts:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\dim\\left(\\text{span}\\{U_j^\\dagger U_k\\}_{j,k \\in S_p}\\right) $$\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the Rank\nOur goal is to find the maximal possible rank of $\\Lambda^c$ by choosing the set $S_p$ of Pauli operators with non-zero probabilities. The rank is the dimension of the space of operators spanned by products of the chosen Paulis. The largest possible space of operators is $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}) = M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices, which has dimension $d^2$.\nSo, the maximal rank of $\\Lambda^c$ is at most $d^2$.\n\nNow we need to show that this maximum can be achieved. To achieve a rank of $d^2$, we must select a set of Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}_{k \\in S_p}$ such that their products $\\{U_j^\\dagger U_k\\}$ span the entire matrix algebra $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nConsider the set of all $d^2$ Pauli operators $\\{U_{ab} = X_a Z_b\\}_{a,b=0}^{d-1}$. It is known that this set forms a basis for $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. We need to check if we can generate all of them (up to a phase, which doesn't affect the span) by taking products from a smaller subset.\n\nThe group of Pauli operators (modulo phase factors), known as the discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group, is generated by just two operators: the shift operator $X_1$ and the phase operator $Z_1$. Any Pauli operator $U_{ab}=X_a Z_b$ can be expressed as a product of powers of $X_1$ and $Z_1$ (up to a phase). For example, $X_a = (X_1)^a$ and $Z_b = (Z_1)^b$.\n\nLet's choose our set of Pauli operators for the channel to be $S_p = \\{I, X_1, Z_1\\}$. Here, $I=U_{00}$, $X_1=U_{10}$, $Z_1=U_{01}$. Let's assume we have a Pauli channel with $p_{00}, p_{10}, p_{01}$ all greater than zero, and all other probabilities are zero. The size of this set is $K=3$ (for $d \\ge 2$).\nThe set of products $\\{U_j^\\dagger U_k\\}_{j,k \\in S_p}$ will contain operators such as:\n*   $I^\\dagger I = I$\n*   $I^\\dagger X_1 = X_1$\n*   $I^\\dagger Z_1 = Z_1$\n*   $(X_1)^\\dagger Z_1 = X_{-1}Z_1$\n*   $(X_1)^a$ and $(Z_1)^b$ for various powers $a,b$.\n\nSince the products involve powers and combinations of the generators $X_1$ and $Z_1$, they can generate every element of the Pauli group (up to a phase factor). Since the Pauli operators $\\{U_{ab}\\}$ form a basis for $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, the span of the products $\\{U_j^\\dagger U_k\\}_{j,k \\in \\{I, X_1, Z_1\\}}$ is the entire space $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of this span is $d^2$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is given by $\\dim(\\text{span}\\{U_j^\\dagger U_k\\})$.\nThe maximum possible dimension for a space of operators on $\\mathcal{H}$ is $d^2$.\nThis dimension is achieved if the set of products spans the full operator space $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$.\nBy choosing a Pauli channel defined by just three Pauli operators $\\{I, X_1, Z_1\\}$ (and non-zero probabilities for them), we ensure that their products generate all Pauli operators, thus spanning $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$.\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
