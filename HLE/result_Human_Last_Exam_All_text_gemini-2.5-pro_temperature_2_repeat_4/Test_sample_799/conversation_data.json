    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Definition of a Sidon Set**\n\nA set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is called a **Sidon set** (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums of its elements are unique, up to the order of the summands. Formally, for any $a, b, c, d \\in S$, the equality\n$a + b = c + d$\nimplies that the sets of summands are the same:\n$\\{a, b\\} = \\{c, d\\}$.\n\nWe are interested in Sidon sets $S$ that are subsets of the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\n**2. Definition of Hausdorff Dimension**\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(S)$, is a concept from fractal geometry that generalizes the notion of dimension to any real number $d \\ge 0$. It provides a way to measure the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of a set, especially those that are not smooth manifolds.\n\n**3. The Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the value of $\\sup \\{ \\dim_H(S) \\mid S \\subset [0,1] \\text{ is a Sidon set} \\}$. Let's denote this value by $\\alpha_{Sidon}$. We will establish this value by finding matching lower and upper bounds.\n\n**4. Establishing an Upper Bound for the Dimension**\n\nThe key to finding an upper bound is to identify an arithmetic property that Sidon sets cannot have, and then use a theorem that guarantees this property for any set with a sufficiently high Hausdorff dimension.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Sidon sets do not contain 3-term arithmetic progressions.**\n    A non-trivial 3-term arithmetic progression (3-AP) is a set of the form $\\{x, x+d, x+2d\\}$ where $d \\ne 0$.\n    Let's assume a Sidon set $S$ contains a non-trivial 3-AP. This means there exist $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $d \\ne 0$ such that $x, x+d, x+2d$ are all elements of $S$.\n    Let $a = x$, $b = x+2d$, and $c = x+d$. All three are in $S$.\n    Consider the sum $a+b$ and the sum $c+c$:\n    $a + b = x + (x+2d) = 2x+2d$\n    $c + c = (x+d) + (x+d) = 2x+2d$\n    So, we have $a+b=c+c$. By the Sidon property, this must imply $\\{a, b\\} = \\{c, c\\} = \\{c\\}$.\n    This means $a=c$ and $b=c$.\n    If $a=c$, then $x = x+d$, which implies $d=0$.\n    This contradicts our assumption that the 3-AP was non-trivial ($d \\ne 0$).\n    Therefore, a Sidon set cannot contain a non-trivial 3-term arithmetic progression.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Sets with high enough dimension must contain 3-APs.**\n    A major result in the field of geometric measure theory and arithmetic combinatorics connects the Hausdorff dimension of a set to the arithmetic structures it must contain. A relevant theorem, proven by V. Chan, I. Łaba, and M. Pramanik (2014), states:\n    > Any Borel set $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ with $\\dim_H(K) > 2/3$ must contain a non-trivial 3-term arithmetic progression.\n\n*   **Conclusion for the Upper Bound:**\n    Combining these two points, if a set $S$ is a Sidon set, it cannot contain a non-trivial 3-AP. According to the theorem, this means its Hausdorff dimension cannot be greater than 2/3.\n    Thus, for any Sidon set $S$, we must have $\\dim_H(S) \\le 2/3$. This establishes an upper bound:\n    $\\alpha_{Sidon} \\le 2/3$.\n\n**5. Establishing a Lower Bound for the Dimension**\n\nTo show that this upper bound is sharp, we need to demonstrate the existence of Sidon sets whose Hausdorff dimensions are arbitrarily close to 2/3. This requires constructing such sets.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Existence of Sidon sets with dimension approaching 2/3.**\n    Constructing Sidon sets with a high Hausdorff dimension is a challenging problem. It often involves sophisticated probabilistic or explicit constructions of Cantor-like sets. T. Keleti (1999) proved a landmark result in this area:\n    > For any $\\alpha < 2/3$, there exists a Sidon set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\dim_H(S) > \\alpha$.\n\n*   **Conclusion for the Lower Bound:**\n    Keleti's result implies that the supremum of the Hausdorff dimensions of Sidon sets must be at least 2/3. This gives us the lower bound:\n    $\\alpha_{Sidon} \\ge 2/3$.\n\n**6. Final Answer**\n\nFrom Step 4, we have the upper bound $\\alpha_{Sidon} \\le 2/3$.\nFrom Step 5, we have the lower bound $\\alpha_{Sidon} \\ge 2/3$.\n\nCombining these two bounds, we can conclude that the maximum Hausdorff dimension is exactly 2/3.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n*   **Upper Bound Proof:** A Sidon set cannot have non-trivial 3-term arithmetic progressions. A set with dimension > 2/3 must have a 3-term arithmetic progression. Thus, a Sidon set must have dimension ≤ 2/3.\n*   **Lower Bound Proof:** There are known constructions of Sidon sets with dimensions arbitrarily close to 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the supremum, or maximum possible value, is precisely 2/3.\n\n<<<2/3>>>"
