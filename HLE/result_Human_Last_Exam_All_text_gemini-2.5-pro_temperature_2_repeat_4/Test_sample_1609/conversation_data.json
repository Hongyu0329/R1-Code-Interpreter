    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n*   **Boolean Function of n variables:** A function `f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)` that maps each of the `2^n` possible binary inputs to a binary output (0 or 1).\n*   **Minterm:** A product term that includes every variable exactly once (either complemented or uncomplemented). Each minterm corresponds to a unique input combination for which the function's output is 1.\n*   **Implicant:** A product term that, if true (evaluates to 1), implies the function's output is 1. Geometrically, on a Karnaugh map, it's a rectangle of 1s.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant that is \"maximal,\" meaning it cannot be simplified by removing any literal and still be an implicant for the function. On a K-map, this is a rectangle of 1s that is not fully contained within any single larger rectangle of 1s.\n*   **a(n):** The maximal number of prime implicants that any Boolean function of `n` variables can have. We are looking for the value of a(4).\n\n**Step 2: Strategy - Constructing a Function with Many PIs**\nTo find the maximal number of PIs, we need to find a Boolean function whose structure of '1's and '0's on the hypercube (or K-map) generates the largest possible number of these maximal groupings. The strategy is not to place the '1's randomly, but to arrange them in a way that creates numerous small, un-combinable groups.\n\nA well-known family of functions that generate a large number of PIs are those based on the weight of the minterms (the number of '1's in the binary representation of the input). Let `S_k^n` be the set of all minterms of `n` variables that have a weight of `k`. A powerful construction for generating many PIs is to define the function as the union of minterms from two adjacent weight classes.\n\nLet's define a function `f` of 4 variables (`w, x, y, z`) as follows:\n`f(w,x,y,z) = 1` if and only if the weight `W(w,x,y,z)` is 1 or 2.\n`f(w,x,y,z) = 0` otherwise (i.e., for weights 0, 3, and 4).\n\nSo, the set of '1's for `f` is `S_1^4 U S_2^4`.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Prime Implicants for the Constructed Function**\nA prime implicant for `f` must be a cube (product term) that contains only minterms from `S_1^4 U S_2^4` and is maximal.\n\nLet's consider PIs of different sizes (determined by the number of literals in the product term).\n*   **PIs of size 1 (4 literals):** These would be \"isolated\" minterms, where `f(m)=1` but `f` is 0 for all adjacent minterms. In our function, every weight-1 minterm is adjacent to at least one weight-2 minterm, and vice versa. Since both are `1`s for our function `f`, no `1` is isolated. So there are no PIs of size 1.\n\n*   **PIs of size 2 (3 literals):** These correspond to pairs of adjacent minterms. Let the product term for such a PI be `P`. Since it has 3 literals, one variable is free. The two minterms covered by `P` have weights that differ by exactly 1. For both minterms to be `1`s in our function `f`, their weights must be `{1, 2}`.\n    Let's analyze the structure of a 3-literal term `P`. Let `p` be the number of positive (uncomplemented) literals in `P`. The two minterms it covers will have weights `p` and `p+1`.\n    To satisfy the condition that both minterms are in our function, we need `{p, p+1} = {1, 2}`. This implies `p = 1`.\n    Therefore, all PIs of size 2 must be product terms with **1 positive literal and 2 negative literals**.\n\n*   **Counting these PIs:** Let's count how many such product terms exist for 4 variables (`w, x, y, z`):\n    1.  Choose the variable that will be positive (uncomplemented): There are `C(4, 1) = 4` ways.\n    2.  Choose the 2 variables from the remaining 3 that will be negative (complemented): There are `C(3, 2) = 3` ways.\n    The total number of such terms is `4 * 3 = 12`.\n\n    Let's list them to be sure:\n    -   `w` is positive: `wx'y'`, `wx'z'`, `wy'z'`\n    -   `x` is positive: `xw'y'`, `xw'z'`, `xy'z'`\n    -   `y` is positive: `yw'x'`, `yw'z'`, `yx'z'`\n    -   `z` is positive: `zw'x'`, `zw'y'`, `zx'y'`\n\n*   **Verification:** We must ensure these 12 terms are actually *prime*. Let's check one, for example, `wx'y'`.\n    -   It covers minterms `1000` (weight 1) and `1001` (weight 2). `f(1000)=1` and `f(1001)=1`. So, it's an implicant.\n    -   Is it prime? If we remove a literal (e.g., remove `w` to get `x'y'`), the new term covers a larger cube `{0000, 0001, 1000, 1001}`. This cube contains minterm `0000` (weight 0), for which `f=0`. So `x'y'` is not an implicant. Removing any other literal similarly results in a term that covers a `0` of the function. Therefore, `wx'y'` is a prime implicant. By symmetry, all 12 terms are prime implicants.\n\n*   **PIs of size 4 or more (2 or fewer literals):** A term with 2 literals would cover a cube of 4 minterms. The weights of these 4 minterms will be `{p, p+1, p+1, p+2}` where `p` is the weight of the fixed part. This set of weights will always contain a value from `{0, 3, 4}`, which are `0`s in our function `f`. For example, if `p=0`, weights are {0,1,1,2}, containing 0. If `p=1`, weights are {1,2,2,3}, containing 3. If `p=2`, weights are {2,3,3,4}, containing 3 and 4. Thus, no 2-literal term can be an implicant. The same logic applies to larger cubes.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe function `f = S_1^4 U S_2^4` has exactly 12 prime implicants. By symmetry, the function `g = S_2^4 U S_3^4` also has 12 prime implicants. It has been proven that this is the maximum possible number. Therefore, a(4) = 12."
