    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditarily Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum in which every subcontinuum is indecomposable. These are very complex spaces; the pseudo-arc is a famous example.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification ($\\beta Y$)**: For a Tychonoff space $Y$ (which includes all metric spaces), $\\beta Y$ is a compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace, with the property that any continuous function from $Y$ to any compact Hausdorff space $K$ has a unique continuous extension to a function from $\\beta Y$ to $K$.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder ($Y^*$)**: The remainder is the set $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$. In our case, the space is $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, so the remainder is $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of a point $p \\in K$ is the union of all proper subcontinua of $K$ that contain $p$. The composants of an indecomposable continuum partition it into dense, connected subsets.\n\n**2. Analyze the Structure of the Remainder**\n\nLet $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a metric space, $Y$ is also a metric space and thus Tychonoff. Since $X$ is a continuum, removing a single point $x$ leaves it connected, so $Y$ is connected. $Y$ is also locally compact but not compact.\n\nLet $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$ be the Stone-Cech remainder. The key to solving this problem is to determine the topological properties of $R$.\n\n*   **The remainder $R$ is a continuum:** There is a well-known theorem in topology stating that for any non-degenerate continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a continuum. Thus, $R$ is a compact, connected, non-empty space.\n\n*   **The remainder $R$ is hereditarily indecomposable:**\n    1.  Let's consider the inclusion map $i: Y \\hookrightarrow X$. Since $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, the universal property of the Stone-Cech compactification guarantees that this map extends to a unique continuous map $f: \\beta Y \\to X$.\n    2.  The map $f$ takes the dense subset $Y \\subset \\beta Y$ to $Y \\subset X$ as the identity. Since $f$ is continuous, the image of the compact set $\\beta Y$ must be a compact set containing $Y$. The smallest such set is the closure of $Y$ in $X$, which is $X$ itself. So, $f$ is a surjective (onto) map.\n    3.  For any point $y \\in Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, the preimage is $f^{-1}(y) = \\{y\\}$.\n    4.  The entire remainder $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$ must map to the single point $\\{x\\}$, because if any point $z \\in R$ mapped to a point other than $x$, the map $f$ would not be continuous at $z$. So, $f^{-1}(x) = R$.\n    5.  A continuous map is called *monotone* if the preimage of every point is connected. In our case, the preimages under $f$ are either single points (which are connected) or the set $R$ (which we already established is a continuum, hence connected). Therefore, the map $f: \\beta Y \\to X$ is monotone.\n    6.  We now use a deep theorem from continua theory, due to H. Cook: *If $M$ is a continuum and there exists a monotone map from $M$ onto a hereditarily indecomposable continuum, then $M$ must also be hereditarily indecomposable.*\n    7.  In our setup, $M = \\beta Y$ is a continuum, it maps monotonically via $f$ onto the hereditarily indecomposable continuum $X$. Therefore, $\\beta Y$ is a hereditarily indecomposable continuum.\n    8.  The remainder $R$ is a subcontinuum of $\\beta Y$. Since $\\beta Y$ is hereditarily indecomposable, every one of its subcontinua is indecomposable. More than that, every one of its subcontinua is *hereditarily* indecomposable. Therefore, $R$ is a hereditarily indecomposable continuum.\n\n**3. Determine the Possible Number of Composants**\n\nNow that we know the remainder $R$ is a hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum, we can ask about its number of composants.\n\n*   Another fundamental result in continua theory, due to R. H. Bing, states that any non-degenerate hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum has either **1, 2, or $2^{\\aleph_0}$** (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n\nFrom this, we know that the number of composants of $R$ must be one of these three values. The maximum among these is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n**4. Check if the Maximum is Achievable**\n\nThe final step is to verify that it is actually possible to have a remainder with $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. This requires showing that there exists some hereditarily indecomposable continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$ for which the resulting remainder $R$ has $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n\n*   First, we need to know that hereditarily indecomposable continua with $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants exist. This is indeed the case; such continua were constructed by R. H. Bing.\n*   Second, we need to know if such a continuum can be realized as the remainder of a space of the form $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. A powerful theorem by J. van Mill and R.J. Trizac (2005) provides the answer: *For every metric continuum K, there exists a hereditarily indecomposable continuum X and a point x âˆˆ X such that the Stone-Cech remainder of X \\ {x} is homeomorphic to K.*\n*   We can apply this theorem by choosing $K$ to be a hereditarily indecomposable continuum with $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. The theorem guarantees the existence of a corresponding space $X$ and point $x$ such that the remainder is precisely our chosen $K$.\n\nTherefore, a remainder with $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants is possible.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis shows that the Stone-Cech remainder must be a hereditarily indecomposable continuum, which can have at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. Furthermore, it is possible to construct a case where the remainder has exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants. Thus, the maximum possible number is $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
