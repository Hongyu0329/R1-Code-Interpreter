    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the polynomial**\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\nWe can recognize the main part of this polynomial as a special type of polynomial related to Chebyshev polynomials. Let's define the family of polynomials $P_n(x, a)$ by the functional equation:\n$P_n(y + a/y, a) = y^n + (a/y)^n$.\nThese are also known as Dickson polynomials of the first kind, often denoted $D_n(x, a)$.\nLet's find the expression for $P_7(x, a)$.\n$P_1(x,a) = x$\n$P_2(x,a) = x^2-2a$\nThe polynomials satisfy the recurrence relation $P_n(x,a) = x P_{n-1}(x,a) - a P_{n-2}(x,a)$.\n$P_3(x,a) = x(x^2-2a)-ax = x^3-3ax$\n$P_4(x,a) = x(x^3-3ax)-a(x^2-2a) = x^4-4ax^2+2a^2$\n$P_5(x,a) = x(x^4-4ax^2+2a^2)-a(x^3-3ax) = x^5 - 5ax^3 + 5a^2x$\n$P_6(x,a) = x P_5 - a P_4 = x^6 - 6ax^4 + 9a^2x^2 - 2a^3$\n$P_7(x,a) = x P_6 - a P_5 = x^7 - 7ax^5 + 14a^2x^3 - 7a^3x$.\n\nComparing the coefficients of $P_7(x,a)$ with our polynomial $f(x)$:\nCoefficient of $x^5$: $-7a = -14 \\implies a=2$.\nCoefficient of $x^3$: $14a^2 = 14(2^2) = 56$. This matches.\nCoefficient of $x$: $-7a^3 = -7(2^3) = -56$. This also matches.\nSo, our polynomial is of the form $f(x) = P_7(x, 2) + 22$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois Group of the polynomial**\nThe problem asks for the density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$. By the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$ that are cycles of length 7 (the degree of the polynomial). An element is a 7-cycle if and only if its order is 7.\n\nThe Galois theory of polynomials of the form $P_n(x,a)+c$ (or $D_n(x,a)-b$) is well-studied.\nFirst, for $f(x)$ to have a transitive Galois group, it must be irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A theorem by Turnwald states that $P_n(x,a)+c$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if $c^2-4a^n$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nIn our case, $n=7, a=2, c=22$. So, $c^2-4a^n = 22^2 - 4(2^7) = 484 - 512 = -28$.\nSince $-28$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFor an irreducible polynomial of the form $P_n(x, a) + c$, with $n$ an odd prime, the Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the affine general linear group $AGL(1,n)$. $AGL(1,n)$ is the group of affine transformations $x \\mapsto ax+b$ on the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_n$, where $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_n^*$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_n$. The order of $AGL(1,n)$ is $n(n-1)$. Here $n=7$, so $G$ is a subgroup of $AGL(1,7)$ of order 42.\n\nA crucial result, for instance by S. D. Cohen or G. Turnwald, provides a criterion to distinguish between the two main possibilities for the Galois group, which are the full affine group $AGL(1,n)$ or the smaller dihedral group $D_n$. The criterion depends on the quantity $\\Delta = c^2 - 4a^n$. Let $K_f$ be the splitting field of the polynomial and $k_n = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$ be the $n$-th cyclotomic field.\nThe Galois group $G$ is the dihedral group $D_n$ if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) \\subseteq k_n$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}$.\nOtherwise, for the generic case, the Galois group is $AGL(1,n)$.\n\nLet's check the condition for our polynomial:\n$n=7, a=2, c=22$.\n$\\Delta = -28$. So we consider the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-28}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$.\nThe cyclotomic field is $k_7 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$.\nIt is a standard result that the unique quadratic subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$.\nTherefore, we have $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-28}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7}) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$.\nAlso, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe condition for the Galois group to be the dihedral group is met. Thus, $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong D_7$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the density**\nThe dihedral group $D_7$ is the group of symmetries of a regular heptagon. It has $2 \\times 7 = 14$ elements. The group is generated by a rotation $r$ of order 7 and a reflection $s$ of order 2, satisfying the relation $srs = r^{-1}$.\nThe elements of $D_7$ are:\n1.  The identity element.\n2.  Six rotations of order 7: $r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, r^6$. These correspond to permutations of the 7 roots that are 7-cycles.\n3.  Seven reflections of order 2: $s, sr, sr^2, ..., sr^6$. These permutations fix at least one root or exchange roots in pairs, so they are not 7-cycles.\n\nWe need to find the proportion of elements that are 7-cycles. As stated, these are the 6 rotations of order 7.\nThe number of 7-cycles in $D_7$ is 6.\nThe total number of elements in $D_7$ is 14.\nThe required density is the ratio:\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles in $G$) / (Order of $G$) = $6/14 = 3/7$.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n1.  The polynomial is identified as $f(x) = P_7(x,2)+22$.\n2.  The irreducibility of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is established.\n3.  The Galois group of $f(x)$ is determined using standard criteria for this family of polynomials. The relevant quantity is $c^2-4a^n = -28$. The fact that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-28}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$ is the quadratic subfield of the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$ implies the Galois group is the dihedral group $D_7$.\n4.  The density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible mod $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in $D_7$ to the order of the group.\n5.  In $D_7$ (order 14), there are 6 elements of order 7 (the non-trivial rotations).\n6.  The final density is $6/14 = 3/7$.\n\n<<<3/7>>>"
