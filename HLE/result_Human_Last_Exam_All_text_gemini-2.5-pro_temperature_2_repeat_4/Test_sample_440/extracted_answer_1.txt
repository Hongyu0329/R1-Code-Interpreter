The density profile \(\rho(z)\) is given by the relation \(\rho(z) = m_A n_A(z) + m_B n_B(z)\), where the number densities \(n_A(z)\) and \(n_B(z)\) are the solutions to the following system of self-consistent equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
n_A(z) = C_A \exp \left( - \frac{m_A g z - 2 \left( (a_{AA}/N_{Avo}^2) n_A(z) + (a_{AB}/N_{Avo}^2) n_B(z) \right)}{k_B T} \right) \\
n_B(z) = C_B \exp \left( - \frac{m_B g z - 2 \left( (a_{AB}/N_{Avo}^2) n_A(z) + (a_{BB}/N_{Avo}^2) n_B(z) \right)}{k_B T} \right)
\end{cases}
\]
The constants \(C_A\) and \(C_B\) are determined by the total particle numbers \(N_A\) and \(N_B\) through the normalization conditions \(N_i = A \int_0^H n_i(z) \,dz\).
