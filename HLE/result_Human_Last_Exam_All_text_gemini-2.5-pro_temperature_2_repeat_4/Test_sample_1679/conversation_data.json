    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Key Elements of the Question\n*   **\"Academy Award for Best Picture\":** The film must have won the top Oscar.\n*   **\"First winner\":** The search must be chronological, starting from the first award ceremony.\n*   **\"Luxor Obelisk\":** This refers to one of two specific obelisks. One remains at the Luxor Temple in Egypt. The other, known as the Luxor Obelisk, was moved in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. A film depicting either location would qualify.\n*   **\"Depict on-screen\":** The obelisk must be visibly shown in the film.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Strategy\nThe most effective strategy is to chronologically review the list of Best Picture winners and analyze their settings. We are looking for the first film set in either Paris (specifically featuring the Place de la Concorde) or Luxor, Egypt. Depictions of the obelisk in Paris are far more common in cinema history than depictions of the one in Luxor.\n\n### Step 3: Chronological Analysis of Best Picture Winners\n\n1.  **1920s-1930s:** The winners from this era, such as *Wings* (1927/28), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1929/30), and *It Happened One Night* (1934), are set in locations like WWI battlefields, Germany, and the United States, not Paris or Luxor.\n2.  **The Life of Emile Zola (1937):** This film won for the year 1937. It is set in Paris and covers the Dreyfus Affair. While it is the first Best Picture winner to be set in Paris, it is a dramatic biopic filmed primarily on studio sets. Key historical events it depicts, like the degradation of Dreyfus, occurred at the Ã‰cole Militaire, not the Place de la Concorde. The film does not feature a prominent, clear shot of the obelisk.\n3.  **1940s:** Winners like *Rebecca* (1940), *How Green Was My Valley* (1941), and *Casablanca* (1942) are set in England, Wales, and Morocco, respectively. None feature the required locations.\n4.  **An American in Paris (1951):** This film, which won for the year 1951, is explicitly set and titled after the French capital. It is a musical that famously celebrates the city's beauty and landmarks. The film includes numerous shots of iconic Parisian locations, and **the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde is clearly depicted on-screen**, particularly during the montage sequence for the song \"I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise\".\n5.  **Later Winners:** Subsequent winners also depict the Paris obelisk. For example, *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) shows the Place de la Concorde from a hot-air balloon, and *Gigi* (1958) also features scenes in Paris with the obelisk. However, since *An American in Paris* (1951) precedes them, it holds the title of the \"first\". No earlier Best Picture winner features a verifiable on-screen depiction of either obelisk.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nBased on a chronological review, *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is the first Best Picture winner set in Paris, but it lacks a clear depiction of the obelisk. The first winner to definitively and clearly show a Luxor Obelisk (the one in the Place de la Concorde) on-screen is *An American in Paris*.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
