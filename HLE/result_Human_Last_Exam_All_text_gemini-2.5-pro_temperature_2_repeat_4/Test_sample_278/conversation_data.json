    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand and analyze the parametric curve.**\nThe curve is defined in two parts depending on the value of the parameter `t`.\n\n*   **Part 1: `t ∈ [0, π]`**\n    In this interval, `b = 1`. The parametric equations are:\n    `x = cos(t)`\n    `y = sin(t)`\n    This is the standard parametrization for a circle. Squaring and adding the equations gives `x² + y² = cos²(t) + sin²(t) = 1`.\n    As `t` varies from `0` to `π`, `sin(t)` is non-negative (`y ≥ 0`). This part of the curve traces the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n    *   The minimum value of `x` is `cos(π) = -1`.\n    *   The maximum value of `x` is `cos(0) = 1`.\n    *   The minimum value of `y` is `sin(0) = sin(π) = 0`.\n    *   The maximum value of `y` is `sin(π/2) = 1`.\n    So, for this part, the `x` values are in `[-1, 1]` and `y` values are in `[0, 1]`.\n\n*   **Part 2: `t ∈ (π, 2π)`**\n    In this interval, `b = 5`. The parametric equations are:\n    `x = cos(t)`\n    `y = 5sin(t)`\n    We can rewrite this as `x/1 = cos(t)` and `y/5 = sin(t)`. Squaring and adding gives `(x/1)² + (y/5)² = cos²(t) + sin²(t) = 1`.\n    This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis and a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis.\n    As `t` varies from `π` to `2π`, `sin(t)` is non-positive (`y ≤ 0`). This part of the curve traces the lower half of this ellipse.\n    *   The `x` values range from `cos(π) = -1` to `cos(2π) = 1`.\n    *   The minimum value of `y` is `5sin(3π/2) = 5(-1) = -5`.\n    *   The maximum value of `y` (in this interval) is `5sin(π) = 5sin(2π) = 0`.\n    So, for this part, the `x` values are in `[-1, 1]` and `y` values are in `[-5, 0]`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the bounding box for the entire figure.**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum `x` and `y` coordinates of the entire curve.\n\n*   **Range of x:**\n    Combining both parts, the `x` values range from a minimum of -1 to a maximum of 1.\n    `x_min = -1`\n    `x_max = 1`\n    The total width of the figure is `x_max - x_min = 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\n*   **Range of y:**\n    Combining the `y` ranges from both parts, `[0, 1]` and `[-5, 0]`:\n    The overall minimum `y` value is -5 (from the second part).\n    The overall maximum `y` value is 1 (from the first part).\n    `y_min = -5`\n    `y_max = 1`\n    The total height of the figure is `y_max - y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the smallest circumscribing square.**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle defined by `x ∈ [-1, 1]` and `y ∈ [-5, 1]`. This bounding rectangle has a width of 2 and a height of 6.\nA square that \"outcircles\" or circumscribes this rectangle must have a side length at least as large as the larger of the rectangle's dimensions.\nSide length of the square = `max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.**\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\nArea = (side length)² = 6² = 36.\n\n**Careful points considered:**\n1.  The value of `b` changes, resulting in a composite figure made of a semi-circle and a semi-ellipse.\n2.  The full range of `t` from `0` to `2π` must be considered to trace the complete figure.\n3.  The ranges for `x` and `y` for each segment were correctly identified.\n4.  The overall bounding box is determined by the absolute minimum and maximum coordinates over the entire figure.\n5.  The side length of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the figure's width and height.\n6.  The final answer required is the area, not the side length.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n- Maximum extent in x-direction (width) = 2.\n- Maximum extent in y-direction (height) = 6.\n- Side length of smallest enclosing square = max(2, 6) = 6.\n- Area of the square = 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
