    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the US city Tommaso moves to in the movie \"Ovosodo\".\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks for the specific name of the city in the United States to which the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 Italian film \"Ovosodo\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key entities.**\n*   **Movie:** \"Ovosodo\" (also known by its English title \"Hard Boiled Egg\").\n*   **Year:** 1997.\n*   **Character:** Tommaso.\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci.\n*   **Action:** The character moves to the United States.\n*   **Information needed:** The name of the US city.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the character's storyline within the movie's plot.**\nTo answer this, we need to recall or research the plot of \"Ovosodo\". The film follows the life of the protagonist, Piero Mansani, growing up in Livorno, Italy. Tommaso is Piero's best friend from a wealthy family. He is portrayed as rebellious and restless.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the specific plot point of Tommaso's departure.**\nA significant event in the film is Tommaso's decision to leave Italy. After a series of personal struggles and feeling a sense of disillusionment with his life and future in Livorno, he decides to emigrate. He has a conversation with his friend Piero where he announces his plans.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the destination city.**\nIn the scene where Tommaso tells Piero he is leaving, he explicitly names the city he is moving to. By reviewing plot summaries and analyses of the film, we can confirm that the destination he states is Philadelphia. This move marks a major turning point in the friends' relationship and in the overall narrative of the film.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   It's important to distinguish between the character (Tommaso) and the actor (Marco Cocci). The question is about the character's destination in the movie's fictional world.\n*   The movie has two common titles, \"Ovosodo\" (Italian) and \"Hard Boiled Egg\" (English). Searching under either title is valid.\n*   The answer is a specific plot detail, so relying on memory alone can be tricky. It's best to confirm with reliable sources like plot summaries from film databases (e.g., IMDb) or detailed reviews.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the US city Tommaso moves to is Philadelphia.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
