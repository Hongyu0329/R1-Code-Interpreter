    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n*   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n*   **Action:** Removed by the city administration.\n*   **Timeframe:** In 1950.\n\n**Step 2: Identify potential candidates and verify them against the criteria.**\nThe Piazza della Rotonda has undergone many changes over its long history. We must carefully consider famous past features and check if they match the 1950 removal date.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: The Bernini bell towers.** Two small bell towers were added to the Pantheon's facade in the 17th century. They were widely disliked by Romans, who nicknamed them \"the ass's ears\" (*le orecchie d'asino*).\n    *   *Careful point:* While this was a unique feature, they were removed much earlier, around 1883. This does not match the 1950 date.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: The fish market.** For a long time, a bustling fish market operated in buildings right next to the Pantheon's portico.\n    *   *Careful point:* This was a characteristic feature of the piazza, but the market was moved in the late 19th century (around the 1880s) for reasons of hygiene and decorum. This also does not match the 1950 date.\n\n*   **Candidate 3: The Fontana del Pantheon.** The magnificent fountain in the center of the square is its main feature besides the Pantheon itself.\n    *   *Careful point:* The fountain was not removed; it is still there today. It was modified in 1711 to add the Egyptian obelisk, but not removed.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate events around 1950 in Rome.**\nThe year 1950 was a Jubilee Year (Anno Santo) in Rome, a time when the city administration often undertook civic projects to improve infrastructure and beautify the city for pilgrims. A major change occurring in Rome's historic center during the post-WWII era was the modernization of public transportation.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the correct feature based on the 1950 timeframe.**\n*   For the first half of the 20th century, a public **tramway line** ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda. Historical photographs clearly show tram cars and their tracks passing directly in front of the Pantheon.\n*   This system required significant infrastructure: metal tracks embedded in the piazza's cobblestones, poles, and a network of overhead electrical wires to power the trams.\n*   *Careful point:* While \"tram line\" may not be the first thing that comes to mind for \"architectural feature,\" the entire infrastructure—tracks, poles, and overhead catenary lines—was a prominent, man-made structural system that defined the square's appearance and atmosphere for decades.\n*   In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the city of Rome decided to remove many tram lines from the narrow streets of the historic center to reduce noise, vibrations that could damage ancient monuments, and to make way for buses and car traffic. The line running through the Piazza della Rotonda was among those removed around this time, fitting the 1950 date.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy eliminating other historical features based on the removal date, the most plausible answer is the public tramway system. Its tracks and overhead wires were a significant and unique (by today's standards) feature of the square, and its removal by the city administration in the specified time frame was a major alteration to the piazza's urban landscape.\n\n<<<The public tramway line, including its tracks and overhead electrical wires>>>"
