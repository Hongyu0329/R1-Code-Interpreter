The formula for the fermionic partition function is $Z = \int \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi \, e^{-S[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$, where the functional integral is over all Grassmann field configurations $\psi$ and $\bar{\psi}$ that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time ($\psi(\tau=\beta) = -\psi(\tau=0)$). The Euclidean action is given by $S[\bar{\psi}, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^d x \, \left[ \bar{\psi}(\partial_\tau \psi) + \mathcal{H}(\bar{\psi}, \psi) \right]$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is the Hamiltonian density.
