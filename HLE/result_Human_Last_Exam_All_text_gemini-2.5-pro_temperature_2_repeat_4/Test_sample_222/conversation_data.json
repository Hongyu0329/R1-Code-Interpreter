    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are asked to find the 8-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence `y(n)`. This sequence `y(n)` is constructed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We are not given `x(n)` and `h(n)` directly, but we have their 4-point DFTs, `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   The 8-point sequence to be transformed is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\n**2. Relate the 8-point DFT to the 4-point DFTs**\n\nInstead of first calculating the inverse DFT to find `x(n)` and `h(n)`, then building `y(n)`, and finally computing its 8-point DFT (which is computationally intensive), we can use a more direct property of the DFT, known as the decimation-in-time algorithm.\n\nLet `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. The formula for `Y(k)` is:\n`Y(k) = Σ[n=0 to 7] y(n) * W_8^(nk)`, where `W_N = e^(-j2π/N)`.\n\nWe can split this sum into even and odd indexed terms of `y(n)`.\nLet's denote the even-indexed part as `g(m) = y(2m)` and the odd-indexed part as `f(m) = y(2m+1)`.\nFrom the problem definition, we can see:\n*   `g(m) = y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   `f(m) = y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nNow, rewrite the `Y(k)` summation:\n`Y(k) = Σ[m=0 to 3] y(2m) * W_8^(2mk) + Σ[m=0 to 3] y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n`Y(k) = Σ[m=0 to 3] x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + W_8^k * Σ[m=0 to 3] h(m) * W_8^(2mk)`\n\n**3. Simplify the Twiddle Factor**\n\nNotice the relationship `W_8^2 = (e^(-j2π/8))^2 = e^(-j2π/4) = W_4`.\nSo, `W_8^(2mk) = (W_8^2)^(mk) = W_4^(mk)`.\n\nSubstitute this back into the equation for `Y(k)`:\n`Y(k) = Σ[m=0 to 3] x(m) * W_4^(mk) + W_8^k * Σ[m=0 to 3] h(m) * W_4^(mk)`\n\n**4. Express `Y(k)` in terms of `X(k)` and `H(k)`**\n\nThe summations are simply the definitions of the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\nSo, we get the key formula:\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n\nThis formula is applied for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7`. We can split this into two parts:\n*   For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`: `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n*   For `k = 4, 5, 6, 7`: `Y(k) = Y(k'+4) = X(k') - W_8^(k') * H(k')` where `k' = k-4`.\n    (This is because `W_8^(k'+4) = W_8^(k') * W_8^4 = W_8^(k') * (-1)` and `X(k'+4) = X(k')` due to the periodicity of the 4-point DFT).\n\n**5. Calculate the Required Twiddle Factors `W_8^k`**\n\n*   `W_8^0 = e^(-j0) = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = e^(-jπ/4) = cos(π/4) - j*sin(π/4) = (1/√2) - j(1/√2) = (1-j)/√2`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^(-jπ/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = e^(-j3π/4) = cos(3π/4) - j*sin(3π/4) = (-1/√2) - j(1/√2) = -(1+j)/√2`\n\n**6. Compute the final `Y(k)` values**\n\n*   **For k=0:**\n    *   `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * (0) = 1`\n    *   `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - 1 * (0) = 1`\n\n*   **For k=1:**\n    *   Product term: `W_8^1 * H(1) = [(1-j)/√2] * (1+j) = (1-j^2)/√2 = 2/√2 = √2`\n    *   `Y(1) = X(1) + (Product term) = j + √2`\n    *   `Y(5) = X(1) - (Product term) = j - √2 = -√2 + j`\n\n*   **For k=2:**\n    *   Product term: `W_8^2 * H(2) = (-j) * 1 = -j`\n    *   `Y(2) = X(2) + (Product term) = -1 + (-j) = -1 - j`\n    *   `Y(6) = X(2) - (Product term) = -1 - (-j) = -1 + j`\n\n*   **For k=3:**\n    *   Product term: `W_8^3 * H(3) = [-(1+j)/√2] * (1-j) = -(1-j^2)/√2 = -2/√2 = -√2`\n    *   `Y(3) = X(3) + (Product term) = -j + (-√2) = -√2 - j`\n    *   `Y(7) = X(3) - (Product term) = -j - (-√2) = √2 - j`\n\n**7. Assemble the Final Result**\n\nCombining the calculated values in order from k=0 to k=7:\n`Y(k) = {1, √2+j, -1-j, -√2-j, 1, -√2+j, -1+j, √2-j}`\n\n<<<[1, 1.414+j, -1-j, -1.414-j, 1, -1.414+j, -1+j, 1.414-j]>>>"
