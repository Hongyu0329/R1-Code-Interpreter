**1) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located within the Beta Interaction Domain (BID), a hydrophobic groove on the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain of the beta-1 subunit (human, UniProt P54287). The most critical hotspot residues are:
*   **W340 (Tryptophan at position 340):** Forms a major part of the hydrophobic binding pocket for the alpha-1 AID helix. Its mutation severely disrupts binding.
*   **E345 (Glutamate at position 345):** Forms a critical salt bridge with a conserved Arginine residue on the alpha-1 AID.
*   **Y381 (Tyrosine at position 381):** Works with W340 to create the hydrophobic binding groove.
Other important residues contributing to the interaction include: **L354 (Leucine), M380 (Methionine),** and **D385 (Aspartate)**.

**2) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit:**

Gating modulation hotspots are more complex and depend on the specific property being modulated.
*   **For fundamental modulation (increased trafficking to the membrane and increased current density):** The hotspot residues are the same as the interaction hotspots listed above (**W340, E345, Y381, etc.**). Proper binding via these residues is the direct cause of these core modulatory effects.
*   **For modulation of voltage-dependent inactivation kinetics:** The primary hotspot is not a single residue but an entire domain:
    *   **The N-Terminal Region (Variable Region 1):** In the human beta-1b splice variant, this region (approximately residues 1-86) is the key determinant responsible for slowing the rate of channel inactivation. Its presence, absence, or sequence from different splice variants dictates the inactivation properties of the channel complex.
