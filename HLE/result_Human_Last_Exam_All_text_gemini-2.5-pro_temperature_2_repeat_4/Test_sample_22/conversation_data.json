    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** SNP heritability is a theoretical concept representing the proportion of phenotypic variance that is explained by the additive effects of *all* common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered in a study (e.g., those on a genotyping array). It is an estimate of the *upper limit* of prediction accuracy if we could build a perfect linear model using all these SNPs. It assumes we know the true effect sizes of all SNPs. This value is typically estimated using methods like GCTA-GREML, which use all SNP data simultaneously to estimate the total variance they explain without estimating each individual SNP effect for prediction.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability (R²_PGS):** A polygenic score is a practical tool used to predict a phenotype. It is constructed by summing up an individual's alleles, weighted by effect sizes that are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The predictive ability of this score is measured by its R², which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can explain when tested in a new, independent sample.\n\n3.  **Compare the two concepts:**\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP)** is the *target* or the *ceiling*. It's the total amount of signal present in the SNPs.\n    *   **PGS Predictive Ability (R²_PGS)** is the *achieved* prediction. It's how much of that total signal our current model, built from finite data, can actually capture.\n\n4.  **Identify sources of imperfection in a PGS:** The reason R²_PGS is lower than h²_SNP is due to the practical limitations of building the score. The PGS is an imperfect model for several reasons:\n    *   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** The effect sizes used as weights in the PGS are estimated from a GWAS with a finite number of participants. This leads to statistical noise and errors in the effect size estimates. A larger GWAS sample yields more accurate estimates and a more powerful PGS, but there will always be some estimation error with a non-infinite sample.\n    *   **Methodological Limitations:** The statistical methods used to build the PGS (e.g., simple clumping and thresholding, or more complex Bayesian methods like LDpred) are not perfect. They make assumptions and simplifications that prevent the model from perfectly capturing the true underlying genetic architecture.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** The GWAS might identify a marker SNP that is merely correlated (in LD) with the true causal SNP. Using this marker SNP instead of the causal one results in an imperfect proxy, and some predictive information is lost, especially if LD patterns differ between the GWAS sample and the prediction sample.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nSNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the total variance theoretically explainable by a perfect linear predictor using all available SNPs. The polygenic score (R²_PGS) represents the variance explained by an *actual* predictor constructed using *estimated* parameters from real-world data. Due to inherent estimation errors from finite sample sizes and other model imperfections, the actual predictive performance of a PGS will inevitably be lower than the theoretical maximum potential. The R² of a PGS can approach the SNP heritability as the size of the discovery GWAS approaches infinity, but in any practical scenario, it will be lower.\n\nTherefore, the statement is correct.\n\nTrue\n\n<<<True>>>"
