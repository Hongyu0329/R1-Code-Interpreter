    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Phenomenon - Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)\n\nSPDC is a quantum nonlinear optical process. In its simplest form, a high-energy \"pump\" photon passes through a suitable nonlinear medium and spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons, conventionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons. This process must conserve both energy and momentum.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** The energy of the pump photon must equal the sum of the energies of the signal and idler photons ($E_{pump} = E_{signal} + E_{idler}$).\n*   **Momentum Conservation (Phase Matching):** The momentum of the pump photon must equal the sum of the momenta of the signal and idler photons ($\\vec{k}_{pump} = \\vec{k}_{signal} + \\vec{k}_{idler}$).\n*   **Material Requirement:** The process relies on the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$ (chi-two).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Necessary Material Properties for SPDC\n\nFor a material to be a good candidate for exhibiting SPDC, it must meet several key criteria:\n\n1.  **Non-zero Second-Order Susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$):** This is the most fundamental requirement. From a material symmetry perspective, a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is only possible in materials that lack a center of inversion (i.e., they are non-centrosymmetric).\n2.  **Optical Transparency:** This is a crucial practical requirement. The material must be relatively transparent (have low linear optical absorption) at the frequencies of all three photons involved (pump, signal, and idler). If the material strongly absorbs light at these frequencies, the pump photons will be absorbed before they can be down-converted, and any generated signal/idler photons will be absorbed before they can exit the material and be detected. This is why SPDC is typically performed in dielectric crystals (e.g., BBO, KDP) or periodically poled materials (e.g., PPLN) which have wide transparency windows.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Properties of Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)\n\nNow, let's examine if boron nanosheets meet the requirements identified in Step 2.\n\n1.  **Symmetry and $\\chi^{(2)}$:**\n    *   Boron nanosheets (borophene) can exist in many different atomic structures (polymorphs).\n    *   Many of the most stable and commonly studied phases, such as the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ phases, are indeed **non-centrosymmetric**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Because they lack inversion symmetry, these borophene structures are, in principle, allowed to have a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$. Therefore, they satisfy the fundamental symmetry requirement for second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC.\n\n2.  **Electronic Structure and Optical Transparency:**\n    *   This is the critical point of failure. Most experimentally realized and theoretically stable forms of free-standing borophene are **metallic**.\n    *   Being metallic means they do not have an electronic bandgap. They have a high density of free electrons (charge carriers).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The metallic nature has profound consequences for the material's optical properties. Metals are highly reflective and, more importantly, highly **absorptive** of light across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum (including the infrared, visible, and UV regions where SPDC experiments are typically conducted).\n    *   The strong linear absorption is due to both intraband transitions (free carriers absorbing photons) and interband transitions.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Analysis and Reach a Conclusion\n\nWe must now combine the properties of borophene with the requirements for SPDC.\n\n*   Borophene meets the first requirement: its non-centrosymmetric structure allows for a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$. This means second-order effects are not forbidden by symmetry.\n*   However, it catastrophically fails the second, practical requirement: optical transparency.\n*   The incident pump photons exciting the borophene sheet would be subject to very strong linear absorption. The probability of a photon being absorbed (and its energy being converted to heat or kinetic energy of an electron) is vastly higher than the probability of it undergoing the very weak SPDC process.\n*   Furthermore, even if a rare SPDC event were to occur and generate a signal-idler pair, these lower-energy photons would be created inside a highly absorptive metallic medium and would almost certainly be re-absorbed before they could escape and be detected.\n*   The high density of free electrons in the metal would also screen the incident electric field, significantly damping the nonlinear optical response and further suppressing the efficiency of the process.\n\n**Conclusion:** While not strictly forbidden by symmetry rules, the strong metallic character, high linear absorption, and free-carrier screening effects in free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to overwhelmingly suppress the spontaneous parametric downconversion process to a negligible and likely unobservable level. Therefore, they would **not be expected** to exhibit this phenomenon in any practical sense.\n\n<<<No>>>"
