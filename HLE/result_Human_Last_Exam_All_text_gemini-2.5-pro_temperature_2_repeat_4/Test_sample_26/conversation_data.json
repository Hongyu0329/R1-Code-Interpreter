    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object X**\n*   $X$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, which is a complex projective space of complex dimension 3. A hypersurface is defined by a single equation, so its complex dimension is $3-1=2$.\n*   As a real manifold, the dimension of $X$ is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   The term \"quintic\" means the defining homogeneous polynomial has degree 5.\n*   \"Smooth\" means that $X$ is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. Smooth projective varieties are compact Kähler manifolds.\n\n**Step 2: Relate Homotopy to Homology using the Hurewicz Theorem**\nThe Hurewicz Theorem connects homotopy groups and homology groups. For a simply connected space $Y$, the theorem implies that the rank of the $k$-th homotopy group is equal to the rank of the $k$-th homology group (the $k$-th Betti number).\n\n*   **Is X simply connected?** We use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem. For a smooth hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ of complex dimension $n-1$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $k < n-1$.\n    *   In our case, $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$, so $n=3$. The dimension of $X$ is $2$. The theorem states that $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ for $k < 3-1 = 2$.\n    *   For $k=1$, we have $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n    *   It is a standard result that $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is simply connected for all $n \\ge 1$. Thus, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = \\{e\\}$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = \\{e\\}$, which means $X$ is simply connected.\n\n*   **Applying Hurewicz:** Since $X$ is simply connected, we can relate the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ to the third Betti number $b_3(X)$. The rational Hurewicz theorem states that the Hurewicz map $h: \\pi_k(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to H_k(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is an isomorphism for all $k$. This implies that the rank of the abelian group $\\pi_k(X)$ is equal to the dimension of the rational vector space $H_k(X; \\mathbb{Q})$, which is the Betti number $b_k(X)$.\n    *   So, we have: Rank($\\pi_3(X)$) = $b_3(X)$.\n    *   The problem is now reduced to calculating the third Betti number of $X$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Betti number $b_3(X)$ using Hodge Theory**\nSince $X$ is a smooth projective variety, it is a compact Kähler manifold. For such manifolds, Hodge theory provides a powerful tool to understand their topology.\n\n*   **Hodge decomposition:** The cohomology groups of $X$ decompose into a direct sum of $(p,q)$-forms: $H^k(X, \\mathbb{C}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=k} H^{p,q}(X)$. The dimensions of these spaces are the Hodge numbers, denoted $h^{p,q}(X) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} H^{p,q}(X)$.\n*   **Betti numbers from Hodge numbers:** The $k$-th Betti number is the sum of the Hodge numbers on the $k$-th anti-diagonal of the Hodge diamond: $b_k(X) = \\sum_{p+q=k} h^{p,q}(X)$.\n*   **Serre Duality:** For a compact Kähler manifold of complex dimension $m$, Serre duality implies a symmetry among the Hodge numbers: $h^{p,q} = h^{m-p, m-q}$.\n    *   In our case, $X$ has complex dimension $m=2$. We are interested in $b_3(X)$.\n    *   $b_3(X) = h^{3,0} + h^{2,1} + h^{1,2} + h^{0,3}$.\n    *   Since the complex dimension of $X$ is 2, any form of type $(p,q)$ with $p>2$ or $q>2$ is zero. Thus, $h^{3,0}=h^{0,3}=0$.\n    *   So, $b_3(X) = h^{2,1}(X) + h^{1,2}(X)$.\n*   **Applying Serre Duality to $b_3(X)$:**\n    *   Using the duality with $m=2$:\n        *   $h^{2,1} = h^{2-2, 2-1} = h^{0,1}$.\n        *   $h^{1,2} = h^{2-1, 2-2} = h^{1,0}$.\n    *   Substituting these back gives: $b_3(X) = h^{0,1}(X) + h^{1,0}(X)$.\n    *   We also know that $b_1(X) = h^{1,0}(X) + h^{0,1}(X)$.\n    *   Therefore, for a complex surface, $b_3(X) = b_1(X)$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate $b_1(X)$ and conclude**\n*   The first Betti number $b_1(X)$ is the rank of the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$.\n*   In Step 2, we showed using the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem that $\\pi_1(X)$ is trivial.\n*   If $\\pi_1(X) = \\{e\\}$, its abelianization $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ must be the trivial group $\\{0\\}$.\n*   Thus, the rank of $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is 0, which means $b_1(X) = 0$.\n*   Since $b_3(X) = b_1(X)$, we must have $b_3(X) = 0$.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nFrom Step 2, we have Rank($\\pi_3(X)$) = $b_3(X)$.\nFrom Step 4, we have $b_3(X)=0$.\nTherefore, the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0.\n\nIt is worth noting that this result holds for any smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, regardless of its degree, because the argument relies only on the dimension of the hypersurface and the ambient space, not on the degree.\n\n>>>0"
