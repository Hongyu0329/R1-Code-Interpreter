    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve given by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n\n**Step 1: Understand Self-Intersection**\nA self-intersection point is a point (x, y) on the curve that is reached at two or more different parameter values (times) t. Let these distinct times be t1 and t2. We must have:\nx(t1) = x(t2)\ny(t1) = y(t2)\nwhere t1 ≠ t2.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Period of the Curve**\nThe period of the x-component, cos(9t), is T_x = 2π/9.\nThe period of the y-component, sin(5t), is T_y = 2π/5.\nThe curve completes a full cycle and starts to retrace itself after a time T, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of T_x and T_y.\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1 / GCD(9, 5)) = 2π * (1/1) = 2π.\nWe will look for self-intersections for t in the interval [0, 2π).\n\n**Step 3: Set up and Solve the Equations**\nWe need to find pairs {t1, t2} with 0 ≤ t1, t2 < 2π and t1 ≠ t2, satisfying:\n1.  cos(9t1) = cos(9t2)\n2.  sin(5t1) = sin(5t2)\n\nFrom equation (1), the general solution for cos(A) = cos(B) is A = 2kπ ± B for some integer k.\nSo, 9t1 = 2kπ ± 9t2.\nSince t1 ≠ t2, we have two cases:\nCase 1a: 9t1 = 9t2 + 2kπ  => t1 - t2 = 2kπ/9 (k ≠ 0)\nCase 1b: 9t1 = -9t2 + 2kπ => t1 + t2 = 2kπ/9\n\nFrom equation (2), the general solution for sin(A) = sin(B) is A = mπ + (-1)^m * B for some integer m.\nThis leads to two cases depending on the parity of m:\nCase 2a (m is even): 5t1 = 5t2 + 2pπ => t1 - t2 = 2pπ/5 (p ≠ 0)\nCase 2b (m is odd): 5t1 = (2p+1)π - 5t2 => t1 + t2 = (2p+1)π/5\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Cases and Count Solutions**\n\nWe now look for solutions that satisfy a condition from the cosine set and a condition from the sine set.\n\n*   **Combination of (1a) and (2a):**\n    t1 - t2 = 2kπ/9 and t1 - t2 = 2pπ/5.\n    This implies 2kπ/9 = 2pπ/5, which simplifies to 5k = 9p. Since 5 and 9 are coprime, k must be a multiple of 9 and p must be a multiple of 5. However, the constraints on t1, t2 in [0, 2π) limit k to {-8, ..., 8} (k≠0) and p to {-4, ..., 4} (p≠0). There are no such integer solutions. So, this combination yields no intersections.\n\n*   **Combination of (1b) and (2a):**\n    t1 + t2 = 2kπ/9\n    t1 - t2 = 2pπ/5\n    Solving this system gives:\n    t1 = kπ/9 + pπ/5 = π(5k + 9p)/45\n    t2 = kπ/9 - pπ/5 = π(5k - 9p)/45\n    The condition 0 < t1 + t2 < 4π implies 0 < k < 18.\n    The condition -2π < t1 - t2 < 2π implies -5 < p < 5 (p≠0).\n    For each valid pair (k, p), we get a pair {t1, t2}. To ensure these times are within [0, 2π), we require 0 ≤ 5k±9p < 90. We only need to count pairs (k, p) for p>0, as p<0 just swaps t1 and t2. Let's count for p in {1, 2, 3, 4}:\n    - For p=1: 1.8 ≤ k < 16.2. k can be {2, ..., 16}, which is 15 values.\n    - For p=2: 3.6 ≤ k < 14.4. k can be {4, ..., 14}, which is 11 values.\n    - For p=3: 5.4 ≤ k < 12.6. k can be {6, ..., 12}, which is 7 values.\n    - For p=4: 7.2 ≤ k < 10.8. k can be {8, 9, 10}, which is 3 values.\n    Total intersection points from this combination = 15 + 11 + 7 + 3 = 36.\n\n*   **Combination of (1a) and (2b):**\n    t1 - t2 = 2kπ/9\n    t1 + t2 = (2p+1)π/5\n    Solving this system gives:\n    t1 = kπ/9 + (2p+1)π/10 = π(10k + 9(2p+1))/90\n    t2 = -kπ/9 + (2p+1)π/10 = π(-10k + 9(2p+1))/90\n    The condition -2π < t1-t2 < 2π implies -9 < k < 9 (k≠0).\n    The condition 0 < t1+t2 < 4π implies -0.5 < p < 9.5, so p in {0, ..., 9}.\n    To ensure 0 ≤ t1, t2 < 2π, we count valid (k,p) pairs. Note that if (k, p) is a solution, so is (-k, p) but they both produce the same pair {t1, t2}. We count solutions with k > 0 and multiply by the number of corresponding negative k values (or in this case, sum all valid k).\n    After analyzing the bounds on k for each p in its range:\n    - For p=0: no non-zero k solution.\n    - For p=1: k = {±1, ±2}. (4 solutions)\n    - For p=2: k = {±1, ±2, ±3, ±4}. (8 solutions)\n    - For p=3: k = {±1, ..., ±6}. (12 solutions)\n    - For p=4: k = {±1, ..., ±8}. (16 solutions)\n    - For p=5: k = {±1, ..., ±8}. (16 solutions)\n    - For p=6: k = {±1, ..., ±6}. (12 solutions)\n    - For p=7: k = {±1, ..., ±4}. (8 solutions)\n    - For p=8: k = {±1, ±2}. (4 solutions)\n    - For p=9: no non-zero k solution.\n    Total pairs (k,p) = 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 16 + 12 + 8 + 4 = 80. Each pair (k,p) where k is positive or negative corresponds to a unique self-intersection point.\n    Total intersection points from this combination = 80.\n\n*   **Combination of (1b) and (2b):**\n    t1 + t2 = 2kπ/9 and t1 + t2 = (2p+1)π/5.\n    This implies 10k = 9(2p+1). The left side is even, but the right side is odd. This is impossible, so there are no solutions from this combination.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\nThe total number of self-intersection points is the sum of the points found in the valid combinations. We assume that there are no points of multiplicity greater than 2 (i.e., no triple points, etc.), which is generally the case for Lissajous curves with coprime frequencies. Also, the sets of points generated by the two different combinations (1b, 2a) and (1a, 2b) are distinct.\n\nTotal number = 36 + 80 = 116."
