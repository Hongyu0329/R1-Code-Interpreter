The specific biochemical reaction that initiated the process was the binding of the drug molecule (or its metabolite) to a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) protein, creating an altered complex that was subsequently recognized as foreign by a T-cell receptor on a T-lymphocyte, thereby triggering a T-cell mediated immune response against the patient's own skin cells.
