No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial; it follows the Parker Spiral, which typically forms a ~45Â° angle with the radial direction at 1 AU.

The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., Y and Z in a coordinate system where X is radial) is a practical approximation based on the **Taylor Hypothesis**. This hypothesis states that because the solar wind speed (predominantly radial) is much higher than the wave's propagation speed in the plasma frame, the wave structures are essentially "frozen-in" and swept past the spacecraft. Therefore, from the spacecraft's point of view, the *apparent* propagation direction of the waves is radial.

This simplification allows for easier analysis, especially in large statistical studies, by avoiding the need to continuously transform into a local magnetic field-aligned coordinate system. However, it is an approximation that measures a *projected* helicity. The accuracy of this measurement depends on the angle between the local magnetic field and the radial direction; the measured value is an underestimate of the true helicity and becomes highly inaccurate when the local magnetic field is nearly perpendicular to the Sun-spacecraft line.
