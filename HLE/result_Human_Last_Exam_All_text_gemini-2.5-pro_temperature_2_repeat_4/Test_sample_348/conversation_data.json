    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the total welfare.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Define Total Welfare**\nThe goal is to calculate the total economic welfare at market equilibrium. Total Welfare (TW) is the sum of Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS).\nTW = CS + PS\nGeometrically, total welfare represents the total area between the demand curve and the supply curve, from a quantity of zero up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Supply and Demand Functions and Their Economic Domains**\n-   **Demand Function:** `P_D = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n    For this function to be economically meaningful, we consider quantities `Q_D ≥ 0`. At Q=0, the price is P=18. As Q increases, the price decreases.\n\n-   **Supply Function:** `P_S = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)`\n    -   **Mathematical Domain:** For the natural logarithm to be defined, its argument must be positive: `Q_S^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q_S^3 > 2`, or `Q_S > 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26`.\n    -   **Economic Domain (A Careful Point):** In economics, producers will only supply goods if the price is non-negative (i.e., they are not paying to sell their product). Therefore, we must find the quantity where `P_S ≥ 0`.\n        `ln(Q_S^3 - 2) ≥ 0`\n        `Q_S^3 - 2 ≥ e^0`\n        `Q_S^3 - 2 ≥ 1`\n        `Q_S^3 ≥ 3`\n        `Q_S ≥ 3^(1/3) ≈ 1.442`\n    This means that the effective supply curve from an economic perspective starts at the quantity `Q = 3^(1/3)`. For any quantity below this, the supply is effectively zero.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Market Equilibrium (Q_E, P_E)**\nEquilibrium occurs where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q_S = Q_D = Q_E) and the prices are equal (P_S = P_D = P_E).\n`ln(Q_E^3 - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))`\nThis is a transcendental equation that cannot be solved with standard algebraic methods. A numerical solver (like a graphing calculator or computational software) is required to find the root.\nSolving this equation numerically, we find the equilibrium quantity:\n`Q_E ≈ 4.726`\nNow, we find the equilibrium price `P_E` by substituting `Q_E` into either the supply or demand function. Using the supply function:\n`P_E = ln((4.726)^3 - 2) = ln(105.454 - 2) = ln(103.454) ≈ 4.639`\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Integral for Total Welfare**\nTotal welfare is the area between the demand curve and the effective supply curve. We can calculate this as the total area under the demand curve up to Q_E, minus the total area under the supply curve over its economic domain.\nTW = (Area under Demand from 0 to Q_E) - (Area under Supply from 3^(1/3) to Q_E)\n`TW = ∫[0 to Q_E] P_D(Q) dQ - ∫[3^(1/3) to Q_E] P_S(Q) dQ`\n`TW = ∫[0 to 4.726] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ - ∫[3^(1/3) to 4.726] ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Definite Integrals**\nThe antiderivatives of the given demand and supply functions are not elementary functions. Therefore, these definite integrals must also be calculated numerically.\n-   **Demand Integral:**\n    `∫[0 to 4.726] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ ≈ 30.26`\n-   **Supply Integral:** (remembering that `3^(1/3) ≈ 1.442`)\n    `∫[1.442 to 4.726] ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ ≈ 9.95`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Total Welfare**\nNow, substitute the values of the integrals back into the formula for total welfare:\n`TW ≈ 30.26 - 9.95`\n`TW ≈ 20.31`\n\nThe total welfare at market equilibrium is approximately 20.31.\n\n<<<20.31>>>"
