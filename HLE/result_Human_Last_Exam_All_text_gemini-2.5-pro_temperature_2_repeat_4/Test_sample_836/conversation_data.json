    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\n\nThe question asks for the common name of a specific mathematical object within a particular scientific community. Let's break down the components:\n*   **Mathematical Object:** The \"space-time, double Fourier transform\" of the \"generalized pair correlation function\".\n*   **Scientific Community:** The \"nuclear criticality community\".\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the \"Generalized Pair Correlation Function\"\n\nIn physics, a pair correlation function, $g(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2)$, describes the probability of finding a pair of particles at positions $\\vec{r}_1$ and $\\vec{r}_2$. The \"generalized\" version, often called the Van Hove correlation function in condensed matter physics, extends this to space and time, $G(\\vec{r}_1, t_1; \\vec{r}_2, t_2)$. It describes the correlation between a particle being at $(\\vec{r}_1, t_1)$ and another (or the same) particle being at $(\\vec{r}_2, t_2)$.\n\nIn nuclear criticality and reactor physics, we are interested in the fluctuation of the neutron population. The analogous quantity is the **covariance density** of the neutron flux (or fission rate, or detector counts). This function, let's call it $C(\\vec{r}_1, t_1; \\vec{r}_2, t_2)$, quantifies how a fluctuation at one point in space-time is correlated with a fluctuation at another point.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The system is often assumed to be stationary in time and homogeneous in space. This simplifies the correlation function, making it dependent only on the separations $\\vec{r} = \\vec{r}_2 - \\vec{r}_1$ and $t = t_2 - t_1$. The function becomes $C(\\vec{r}, t)$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the \"Space-Time, Double Fourier Transform\"\n\nA Fourier transform is a mathematical operation that decomposes a function into its constituent frequencies.\n*   **Time Fourier Transform:** Transforms from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$).\n*   **Space Fourier Transform:** Transforms from the position domain ($\\vec{r}$) to the wavevector domain ($\\vec{k}$).\n*   **Space-Time Fourier Transform:** A combined transform with respect to both space and time variables.\n\nThe term \"double Fourier transform\" here refers to transforming over both the space and time separation variables of the pair correlation function. The mathematical form is:\n\n$S(\\vec{k}, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dt \\int_{V} d^3\\vec{r} \\, C(\\vec{r}, t) \\, e^{-i(\\vec{k} \\cdot \\vec{r} - \\omega t)}$\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** This operation converts the correlation function from the space-time domain, $C(\\vec{r}, t)$, into the wavevector-frequency domain, $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Common Name in the Nuclear Community\n\nNow we need to identify what $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$ is commonly called in the nuclear criticality and reactor noise analysis community.\n\n1.  **Relation to Power Spectral Density:** The Fourier transform of a time correlation function is known as a Power Spectral Density (PSD). For example, the time Fourier transform of the cross-correlation function between two detectors gives the Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD), a foundational tool in reactor noise analysis. The quantity $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$ is a generalization of the PSD that includes spatial dependence. It can be thought of as a \"space-dependent power spectral density\".\n\n2.  **Adoption of Physics Terminology:** The nuclear physics community, particularly in the advanced field of space-dependent reactor noise, has adopted a more formal and specific term from condensed matter physics. In condensed matter, the space-time Fourier transform of the density-density correlation function (the Van Hove correlation function) is used to describe the collective dynamics of particles (e.g., phonons, magnons) and is measured via inelastic scattering experiments. This quantity is called the **Dynamic Structure Factor**.\n\n3.  **Application to Reactors:** The analogy is direct. The function $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$ describes the collective dynamics of neutron population fluctuations (i.e., propagating \"noise waves\") in a nuclear reactor. It contains information about how disturbances of a certain wavelength (related to $1/|\\vec{k}|$) propagate and decay at a certain frequency ($\\omega$). Therefore, the name \"Dynamic Structure Factor\" has been adopted by prominent researchers in the field (e.g., Imre PÃ¡zsit) to describe $S(\\vec{k}, \\omega)$ in the context of neutron transport.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** While related terms like \"space-dependent power spectral density\" or \"neutron noise power spectral density\" might be used and understood, the most precise and formally accepted name for the full space-time Fourier transform of the pair correlation function is the Dynamic Structure Factor.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these steps, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function of neutrons is a generalization of the power spectral density that describes correlations in both space and time. Its formal name, adopted from condensed matter physics and commonly used in advanced nuclear reactor noise literature, is the Dynamic Structure Factor.\n\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"
