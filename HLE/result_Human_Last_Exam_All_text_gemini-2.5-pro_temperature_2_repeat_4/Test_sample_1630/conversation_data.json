    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Setup**\n\n*   We are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\n*   The derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$. This means that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions. A polynomial must have an odd degree for its derivative (which has an even degree) to be always positive. Since the degree is 3, this condition is possible. For a cubic $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$, the derivative is $3ax^2+2bx+c$. For this quadratic to be always positive, the parabola must open upwards ($3a > 0 \\implies a>0$) and not touch the x-axis (discriminant $< 0 \\implies (2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 < 3ac$).\n*   We need to find the number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\n*   A fixed point is a value of $x$ such that $h(x) = x$, or $f(g(x)) = x$.\n*   We are looking for the *maximum possible* number of such fixed points.\n\n**2. Determine the Degree of the Fixed-Point Equation**\n\n*   The function $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   The function $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   The composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n*   Degree of $h(x) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The fixed points are the solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$. This is equivalent to finding the roots of the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n*   The degree of $P(x)$ is the same as the degree of $f(g(x))$, which is 9.\n*   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 has at most 9 real roots. This gives us an initial upper bound of 9 for the number of fixed points.\n\n**3. Analyze the Constraints and Apply Rolle's Theorem**\n\nWe need to check if the condition that $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing reduces this maximum possible number of roots.\n\n*   Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We can find its derivative using the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n*   We are given that $f'(y) > 0$ for any value $y$, and $g'(x) > 0$ for any value $x$.\n*   Therefore, their product $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ must also be positive for all $x$. This means $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n*   Now consider the polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$. We are looking for the maximum number of roots of $P(x)$.\n*   Let's assume $P(x)$ has $k$ distinct real roots. By Rolle's Theorem, between any two consecutive roots of $P(x)$, there must be at least one point where its derivative $P'(x)$ is zero. Therefore, $P'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ real roots.\n*   Let's find the derivative of $P(x)$: $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$.\n*   The roots of $P'(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $h'(x) - 1 = 0$, or $h'(x) = 1$.\n\n**4. Determine the Maximum Number of Roots for P'(x)**\n\n*   Let's determine the nature of $h'(x)$.\n    *   $f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2 (since $f(x)$ is degree 3).\n    *   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $\\text{deg}(f') \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   Therefore, $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   We are looking for the number of solutions to $h'(x) = 1$. This is equivalent to finding the roots of the polynomial $h'(x) - 1$, which is of degree 8.\n*   A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots.\n*   So, $P'(x)$ can have at most 8 real roots.\n\n**5. Conclude the Maximum Number of Fixed Points**\n\n*   From Rolle's theorem, we know that if $P(x)$ has $k$ roots, then $P'(x)$ has at least $k-1$ roots.\n*   Number of roots of $P(x) \\le (\\text{Number of roots of } P'(x)) + 1$.\n*   Since the maximum number of roots of $P'(x)$ is 8, the maximum number of roots of $P(x)$ is $8 + 1 = 9$.\n*   This means the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is 9.\n\n**6. Feasibility Check (Can we achieve 9 fixed points?)**\n\nTo achieve 9 fixed points, we need to show that it's possible to choose $f$ and $g$ such that:\n1.  The polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ has 9 real roots.\n2.  For this to happen, its derivative $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$ must have 8 distinct real roots.\n3.  This means the graph of the 8th degree polynomial $y=h'(x)$ must intersect the horizontal line $y=1$ at 8 distinct points.\n4.  An 8th degree polynomial with a positive leading coefficient starts at $y=+\\infty$ for $x \\to -\\infty$, can have several local minima and maxima, and returns to $y=+\\infty$ for $x \\to \\infty$. To intersect a line 8 times, it must have 4 local minima and 3 local maxima. This is the maximum number of extrema for an 8th-degree polynomial.\n5.  It is known that such polynomials $f$ and $g$ can be constructed. By carefully choosing the coefficients of $f$ and $g$, it's possible to create an $h'(x)$ that has the required 7 local extrema (which implies its derivative, a 7th degree polynomial, has 7 real roots). Furthermore, the vertical positions of these extrema can be controlled. One can ensure the 4 local minima are below 1 and the 3 local maxima are above 1.\n6.  Once we have $h'(x)$ crossing $y=1$ eight times, we have 8 critical points for $P(x)$. To ensure these lead to 9 roots, the values of $P(x)$ at these critical points (local maxima and minima) must alternate in sign. The constant term of $f(x)$ can be adjusted to shift the entire graph of $P(x)$ vertically without changing its critical points. This allows us to satisfy the alternating sign condition.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to achieve 9 fixed points. The constraints do not reduce the maximum number of roots from the algebraic limit.\n\nFinal answer is the maximum number of roots of a degree 9 polynomial."
