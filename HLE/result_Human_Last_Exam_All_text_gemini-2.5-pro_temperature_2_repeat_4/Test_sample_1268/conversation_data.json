    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Interpret the Question\n\nThe question asks for the upper bound of a quantity called \"maximum norm\" denoted by $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the \"covolume\" $(V)$. The context is specified as \"squarefree natural numbers $(N)$\".\n\n*   **Squarefree Natural Numbers (N):** In number theory, this condition typically defines a family of algebraic number fields. A very common case is the family of quadratic fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$, where $d$ is a squarefree integer. Since $N$ is a natural number, it's natural to consider imaginary quadratic fields $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$, where $N$ is a positive squarefree integer. The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of such a field can be represented as a 2-dimensional lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n*   **Covolume (V):** This is the volume of the fundamental parallelotope of the lattice. For a lattice corresponding to the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$, the covolume $V$ is given by $2^{-r_2}\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$, where $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the field and $r_2$ is the number of complex embeddings. For an imaginary quadratic field, $r_2=1$ and the dimension is $n=2$.\n\n*   **Maximum Norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$:** This notation is non-standard. In the context of the geometry of numbers, norms are used to measure the length of lattice vectors. The $\\infty$ subscript refers to the $L_\\infty$-norm (or max norm), where the norm of a vector $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ is $\\max(|x_1|, \\dots, |x_n|)$. \"Maximum norm\" in the context of lattice theory usually refers to the largest successive minimum, denoted $\\lambda_n^{(\\infty)}$. For our 2D lattice, this would be $\\lambda_2^{(\\infty)}$. The successive minima $\\lambda_1 \\le \\lambda_2 \\le \\dots \\le \\lambda_n$ are defined as $\\lambda_i(\\Lambda) = \\inf \\{r > 0 \\mid \\dim(\\text{span}(\\Lambda \\cap B_r)) \\ge i \\}$, where $B_r$ is a ball of radius $r$. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\nSo, the problem is to find an upper bound for $\\lambda_2^{(\\infty)}$ of the lattice $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})}$ in terms of its covolume $V$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Lattices\n\nThe structure of the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})}$ and its corresponding lattice depends on the value of $N$ modulo 4. We will use the standard embedding that maps an element $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-N}$ to the vector $(a, b\\sqrt{N})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n**Case 1: $N \\equiv 1$ or $N \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$**\n*   The discriminant is $\\Delta_K = -4N$.\n*   The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-N}]$. A basis for $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is $\\{1, \\sqrt{-N}\\}$.\n*   The embedding maps the basis to $b_1 = (1, 0)$ and $b_2 = (0, \\sqrt{N})$. These vectors generate the lattice.\n*   The **covolume** is $V = |\\det(b_1, b_2)| = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{N} - 0 \\cdot 0 = \\sqrt{N}$.\n*   Now we find the successive minima for the $L_\\infty$ norm. Any lattice vector is of the form $v=(a, b\\sqrt{N})$ for integers $a, b$.\n    *   The shortest non-zero vector is for $(a,b)=(1,0)$, which gives $v_1 = (1,0)$. Its norm is $\\|v_1\\|_\\infty = \\max(|1|,|0|) = 1$. So, $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)} = 1$.\n    *   The shortest vector that is linearly independent of $v_1$ is found by looking at vectors with $b \\neq 0$. The shortest of these is for $(a,b)=(0,1)$, giving $v_2 = (0, \\sqrt{N})$. Its norm is $\\|v_2\\|_\\infty = \\max(|0|,|\\sqrt{N}|) = \\sqrt{N}$.\n    *   Thus, the second successive minimum is $\\lambda_2^{(\\infty)} = \\sqrt{N}$.\n*   In this case, we have $\\lambda_2^{(\\infty)} = V$.\n\n**Case 2: $N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$**\n*   The discriminant is $\\Delta_K = -N$.\n*   The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{-N}}{2}]$. A basis is $\\{1, \\omega\\}$, where $\\omega = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{-N}}{2}$.\n*   The embedding maps the basis to $b_1 = (1,0)$ and $b_2 = (1/2, \\sqrt{N}/2)$.\n*   The **covolume** is $V = |\\det(b_1, b_2)| = |1 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2} - 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}| = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{2}$.\n*   Now we find the successive minima for the $L_\\infty$ norm. Any lattice vector is of the form $v = a \\cdot b_1 + b \\cdot b_2 = (a+b/2, b\\sqrt{N}/2)$ for integers $a,b$.\n    *   Let's find the shortest non-zero vectors.\n        *   For $b=\\pm 1$, the shortest vector norm is for $a=0$ or $a=-1$, giving vectors like $(\\pm 1/2, \\pm \\sqrt{N}/2)$. The norm is $\\max(1/2, \\sqrt{N}/2)$.\n        *   For $b=0$, the shortest vector norm is for $a=\\pm 1$, giving $(\\pm 1, 0)$. The norm is $1$.\n    *   If $N=3$, $\\sqrt{N}/2 = \\sqrt{3}/2 \\approx 0.866 < 1$. The shortest vectors are $(\\pm 1/2, \\pm \\sqrt{3}/2)$. They have norm $\\sqrt{3}/2$. We can pick $v_1=(1/2, \\sqrt{3}/2)$ and $v_2=(-1/2, \\sqrt{3}/2)$, which are linearly independent and have the same minimal norm. Thus, $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)} = \\lambda_2^{(\\infty)} = \\sqrt{3}/2$. The covolume is $V=\\sqrt{3}/2$. So, $\\lambda_2^{(\\infty)} = V$.\n    *   If $N \\ge 7$ (the next squarefree number congruent to 3 mod 4), $\\sqrt{N}/2 > 1$. The shortest non-zero vector is $(1,0)$ with norm $1$. Thus, $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)} = 1$. The shortest vector linearly independent of $(1,0)$ must have $b \\neq 0$. The shortest such vectors are $(\\pm 1/2, \\pm \\sqrt{N}/2)$, with norm $\\sqrt{N}/2$. Thus, $\\lambda_2^{(\\infty)} = \\sqrt{N}/2$. The covolume is $V=\\sqrt{N}/2$. So, $\\lambda_2^{(\\infty)} = V$.\n*   In this case as well, we have $\\lambda_2^{(\\infty)} = V$.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nIn all cases for lattices derived from the rings of integers of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$ where $N$ is a positive squarefree integer, we found a direct relationship: the largest successive minimum for the $L_\\infty$-norm is equal to the covolume of the lattice.\n\n$$ \\lambda_2^{(\\infty)} = V $$\n\nThe question asks for an upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume. Since the quantities are equal for the family of lattices under consideration, the sharpest possible upper bound is $V$ itself.\n\nThe upper bound for $k_{k,\\infty}$ (interpreted as $\\lambda_2^{(\\infty)}$) is $V$.\n\n<<<V>>>"
