    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the concept of equilibrium points and their stability.**\n\nAn equilibrium point (or fixed point) of a differential equation $x'(t) = f(x(t))$ is a value $x^*$ such that $f(x^*) = 0$. At these points, the system is at rest because the rate of change is zero.\n\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ is determined by the behavior of solutions that start near $x^*$.\n*   An equilibrium point $x^*$ is **stable** if solutions starting near $x^*$ tend toward $x^*$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n*   An equilibrium point $x^*$ is **unstable** if solutions starting near $x^*$ tend away from $x^*$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n*   An equilibrium point $x^*$ is **semi-stable** if solutions on one side of $x^*$ tend toward it, while solutions on the other side tend away from it.\n\nThe problem asks for $m$, the number of **stable** equilibrium points.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points.**\n\nThe differential equation is $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$.\nLet $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$.\nTo find the equilibrium points, we set $f(x) = 0$ and solve for $x$.\n\n$$ -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0 $$\n\nWe can factor out a $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\n\nThe quadratic term in the parentheses is a perfect square: $x^{2} - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\n\nThis equation gives two solutions for $x$:\n1.  $-x = 0 \\implies x_1 = 0$\n2.  $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x-1=0 \\implies x_2 = 1$\n\nThe equilibrium points are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stability of each equilibrium point.**\n\nWe can use the first derivative test for stability. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$. If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use another method, like a phase line analysis.\n\nFirst, find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    Substitute $x=0$ into $f'(x)$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    Substitute $x=1$ into $f'(x)$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive for this point.\n\n**Step 4: Use phase line analysis for the inconclusive case.**\n\nSince the first derivative test was inconclusive for $x=1$, we will analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the intervals around the equilibrium points to determine the direction of the flow.\n\n*   The equilibrium points are $0$ and $1$. The intervals to check are $(-\\infty, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(1, \\infty)$.\n*   Note that the term $(x-1)^2$ is always positive for any $x \\neq 1$. Therefore, the sign of $f(x)$ is determined by the sign of $-x$ for $x \\neq 1$.\n\n*   **Interval $(-\\infty, 0)$:** Let's take $x = -1$.\n    $-x = -(-1) = 1 > 0$.\n    So, $f(x) > 0$ in this interval, which means $x'(t) > 0$ and solutions are increasing (moving to the right, towards 0).\n\n*   **Interval $(0, 1)$:** Let's take $x = 0.5$.\n    $-x = -0.5 < 0$.\n    So, $f(x) < 0$ in this interval, which means $x'(t) < 0$ and solutions are decreasing (moving to the left). In this interval, this means moving away from 1 and towards 0.\n\n*   **Interval $(1, \\infty)$:** Let's take $x = 2$.\n    $-x = -2 < 0$.\n    So, $f(x) < 0$ in this interval, which means $x'(t) < 0$ and solutions are decreasing (moving to the left, towards 1).\n\n**Summary of the phase line:**\n*   For $x < 0$, $x(t)$ increases toward 0. (`--->`)\n*   For $0 < x < 1$, $x(t)$ decreases toward 0. (`<---`)\n*   For $x > 1$, $x(t)$ decreases toward 1. (`<---`)\n\nPhase Line Diagram: `---> 0 <--- 1 <---`\n\n**Conclusion on stability:**\n*   At $x=0$, solutions from both sides move toward 0. This confirms that $x=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium point.\n*   At $x=1$, solutions from the right ($x > 1$) move toward 1, but solutions from the left ($x < 1$) move away from 1. This means $x=1$ is a **semi-stable** equilibrium point.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the value of $m$.**\n\nThe problem defines $m$ as the number of **stable** equilibrium points. Based on our analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nTherefore, $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstitute the value of $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1-2^4048>>>"
