    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of homology cobordism group elements representable by integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n1.  **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$):** This is a group where the elements are oriented integral homology 3-spheres (3-manifolds with the same integral homology as the 3-sphere $S^3$). Two such manifolds, $M_1$ and $M_2$, are considered equivalent (representing the same element) if there exists a 4-manifold $W$ whose boundary is $M_1 \\cup (-M_2)$ and which has the same homology as a cylinder ($M_1 \\times [0,1]$). The group operation is the connected sum ($#$), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n\n2.  **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** This is a method of constructing a 3-manifold by removing a tubular neighborhood of a knot $K$ from $S^3$ and gluing a solid torus back in. \"Integral\" surgery means the surgery coefficient is an integer, say $p$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_p(K)$.\n\n3.  **Condition for an Integral Homology Sphere:** For the manifold $S^3_p(K)$ obtained by $p$-surgery on a knot $K$ to be an integral homology sphere, its first homology group $H_1(S^3_p(K); \\mathbb{Z})$ must be trivial. The order of this group is $|p|$. Therefore, to get an integral homology sphere, we must have $|p|=1$. This means we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries on the knots.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify All Knots with at most Four Crossings**\n\nWe list the knots using standard knot theory classification (like the Rolfsen table). The crossing number is the minimum number of crossings in any projection of the knot.\n\n*   **0 crossings:** $0_1$ (the unknot). This knot is achiral (identical to its mirror image).\n*   **1 or 2 crossings:** There are no knots.\n*   **3 crossings:** $3_1$ (the right-handed trefoil knot). This knot is chiral. Its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil ($m3_1$ or $-3_1$), is a distinct knot.\n*   **4 crossings:** $4_1$ (the figure-eight knot). This knot is amphicheiral (or achiral), meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\nTherefore, the complete list of knots to consider is:\n1.  The unknot ($0_1$)\n2.  The right-handed trefoil ($3_1$)\n3.  The left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$)\n4.  The figure-eight knot ($4_1$)\n\nNo composite knots (like a square knot $3_1\\#3_1$) can have 4 or fewer crossings, because the crossing number of a composite knot is the sum of the crossing numbers of its components, and the simplest non-trivial knot ($3_1$) already has 3 crossings.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Surgery Results for Each Knot**\n\nFor each knot, we perform $+1$ and $-1$ surgery and identify the resulting homology cobordism class. We use invariants like the Casson invariant ($\\lambda$) to distinguish between classes. A key property is that if two manifolds are homology cobordant, they must have the same Casson invariant.\n\n1.  **Unknot ($0_1$)**\n    *   $S^3_1(0_1) = S^3$\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1) = S^3$\n    *   Both surgeries yield the standard 3-sphere, which is the identity element in $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   **Classes found: 1** (the trivial class $[S^3]$).\n\n2.  **Right-handed Trefoil ($3_1$)**\n    *   $Y_A = S^3_1(3_1)$: This is the Poincar√© homology sphere. Its Casson invariant is $\\lambda(Y_A)=1$.\n    *   $Y_B = S^3_{-1}(3_1)$: Its Casson invariant is $\\lambda(Y_B)=-1$.\n    *   Since the Casson invariants are non-zero, neither class is the trivial class. Since their invariants are different, $[Y_A]$ and $[Y_B]$ are distinct classes.\n    *   **Classes found: 2 new distinct non-trivial classes.**\n\n3.  **Left-handed Trefoil ($-3_1$)**\n    *   $Y_C = S^3_1(-3_1)$ and $Y_D = S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$.\n    *   A standard identity relates surgery on a knot and its mirror: $S^3_p(mK) \\cong -S^3_{-p}(K)$, where $-M$ is the manifold $M$ with opposite orientation.\n    *   $Y_C \\cong -S^3_{-1}(3_1) = -Y_B$. So, $[Y_C] = [-Y_B]$. This class has $\\lambda = -\\lambda(Y_B) = -(-1)=1$.\n    *   $Y_D \\cong -S^3_{1}(3_1) = -Y_A$. So, $[Y_D] = [-Y_A]$. This class has $\\lambda = -\\lambda(Y_A) = -1$.\n    *   We need to check if these classes ($[-Y_A]$ and $[-Y_B]$) are new. They are distinct from $[Y_A]$ and $[Y_B]$ because their Casson invariants are of opposite sign. To check if $[Y_A]$ is distinct from $[-Y_B]$, we note they have the same Casson invariant ($\\lambda=1$). We use a stronger invariant: knot concordance.\n    *   For L-space knots (which all alternating knots, including trefoils, are), $S^3_1(K_1)$ is homology cobordant to $S^3_1(K_2)$ if and only if $K_1$ is concordant to $K_2$.\n    *   Here, we compare $[Y_A] = [S^3_1(3_1)]$ and $[-Y_B] = [S^3_1(-3_1)]$. This requires checking if $3_1$ is concordant to $-3_1$. Two knots $K_1, K_2$ are concordant if $K_1 \\# (-K_2)$ is a slice knot. A slice knot must have signature 0. The test knot is $3_1 \\# (-(-3_1)) = 3_1 \\# 3_1$. The signature is $\\sigma(3_1 \\# 3_1) = \\sigma(3_1)+\\sigma(3_1) = -2 + (-2) = -4 \\neq 0$. Thus, $3_1$ and $-3_1$ are not concordant.\n    *   Therefore, $[Y_A]$ and $[-Y_B]$ are distinct classes. Similarly, $[Y_B]$ and $[-Y_A]$ (both with $\\lambda=-1$) are distinct.\n    *   **Classes found: 2 new distinct non-trivial classes.**\n\n4.  **Figure-eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n    *   $Y_E = S^3_1(4_1)$: Its Casson invariant is $\\lambda(Y_E) = 1$.\n    *   $Y_F = S^3_{-1}(4_1)$: Its Casson invariant is $\\lambda(Y_F) = -1$.\n    *   These represent two distinct non-trivial classes. Since the knot $4_1$ is amphicheiral ($4_1 \\cong -4_1$), we have $Y_F = S^3_{-1}(4_1) \\cong -S^3_1(4_1) = -Y_E$. So the two classes are $[Y_E]$ and $[-Y_E]$.\n    *   We must check if these are distinct from the four classes found from the trefoils.\n    *   Compare $[Y_E]$ with the two classes with $\\lambda=1$ from trefoils: $[Y_A]=[S^3_1(3_1)]$ and $[-Y_B]=[S^3_1(-3_1)]$.\n    *   To compare $[S^3_1(4_1)]$ and $[S^3_1(3_1)]$, we check for concordance of $4_1$ and $3_1$. The test knot is $4_1 \\# (-3_1)$. Its signature is $\\sigma(4_1)+\\sigma(-3_1) = 0+2 = 2 \\neq 0$. They are not concordant, so the classes are distinct.\n    *   To compare $[S^3_1(4_1)]$ and $[S^3_1(-3_1)]$, we check for concordance of $4_1$ and $-3_1$. The test knot is $4_1 \\# (-(-3_1)) = 4_1 \\# 3_1$. Its signature is $\\sigma(4_1)+\\sigma(3_1) = 0-2 = -2 \\neq 0$. They are not concordant, so the classes are distinct.\n    *   Therefore, $[Y_E]$ and consequently $[-Y_E]$ are new distinct classes.\n    *   **Classes found: 2 new distinct non-trivial classes.**\n\n### **Step 4: Final Count**\n\nLet's summarize the distinct classes found:\n1.  The trivial class: $[S^3]$ from the unknot.\n2.  From the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$): two classes, $[S^3_1(3_1)]$ (with $\\lambda=1$) and $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$ (with $\\lambda=-1$).\n3.  From the left-handed trefoil ($-3_1$): two classes, $[S^3_1(-3_1)]$ (with $\\lambda=1$) and $[S^3_{-1}(-3_1)]$ (with $\\lambda=-1$). These are distinct from the previous two.\n4.  From the figure-eight knot ($4_1$): two classes, $[S^3_1(4_1)]$ (with $\\lambda=1$) and $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$ (with $\\lambda=-1$). These are distinct from the four trefoil classes.\n\nIn total, we have:\n*   1 trivial class (from the unknot).\n*   2 classes from $3_1$ surgery.\n*   2 classes from $-3_1$ surgery.\n*   2 classes from $4_1$ surgery.\n\nThe total number of distinct homology cobordism classes is $1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7$.\n\nThese seven distinct classes are:\n*   One class with $\\lambda=0$: $[S^3]$.\n*   Three classes with $\\lambda=1$: $[S^3_1(3_1)]$, $[S^3_1(-3_1)]$, $[S^3_1(4_1)]$.\n*   Three classes with $\\lambda=-1$: $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$, $[S^3_{-1}(-3_1)]$, $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$.\n\n<<<7>>>"
