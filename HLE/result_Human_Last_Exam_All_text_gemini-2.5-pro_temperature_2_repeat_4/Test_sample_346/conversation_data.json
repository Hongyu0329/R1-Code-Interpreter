    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression to find the value of `n` and then `log_2(n)`.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Basic SKI Rules**\n\nThe goal is to determine the integer `n` represented by the given Church numeral expression in SKI combinator logic and then calculate `log_2(n)`.\nThe fundamental reduction rules are:\n*   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n*   `K x y = x`\n*   `I x = x`\n\nThe given expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n\n**Step 2: Parsing the Expression and Identifying Components**\n\nSKI combinator expressions are left-associative, but `S` naturally takes three arguments. The structure of the given expression strongly suggests it's of the form `S x y z`. Let's break it down accordingly.\n\nLet the entire expression be `E`. We parse it as `E = S X Y Z`, where:\n*   `X = I`\n*   `Y = S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))))`\n*   `Z = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Building Blocks (Church Numerals and Operations)**\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we need to recognize the components as Church numerals or operations on them.\n\n*   **Identifying the Successor Function (`succ`)**: The sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` appears in both `Y` and `Z`. This is a common, though sometimes confusingly written, form of the successor function `succ`. The standard combinator for `succ` is `S B`, where `B = S(KS)K`. The expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` can be shown to be equivalent to `S(S(KS)K) = S B = succ`. Let's assume `A = S(S(K(S))(K)) = succ`.\n    *   The `succ` function takes a Church numeral `n` and returns `n+1`.\n\n*   **Identifying Church Numerals `1` and `2`**:\n    *   `I` is the Church numeral for `1`.\n    *   `S I I` can be reduced: `(S I I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (I f x) = f (f x)`. This represents applying a function `f` twice, so `S I I` is the Church numeral for `2`.\n\n*   **Analyzing Exponentiation**: When one Church numeral `M` is applied to another Church numeral `N`, like `M N`, it results in exponentiation. The result is a Church numeral representing `val(N)^val(M)`. For example, if `2` and `3` are the Church numerals for 2 and 3, `3 2` reduces to the Church numeral for `2^3 = 8`.\n\nWith these components identified, let's rename the sub-expressions in `Y` and `Z`.\n*   Let `succ = S(S(K(S))(K))`\n*   Let `one = I`\n*   Let `two = S I I`\nSo, the expressions `Y` and `Z` become:\n*   `Z = succ(two) = succ(2)` which is the Church numeral for `3`. Let's call it `three`.\n*   The argument to `K` inside `Y` is `succ(one) = succ(1)`, which is the Church numeral for `2`. Let's call it `two_inner`.\n*   So, `Y` simplifies to `Y = S(I)(S(I)(K(two_inner))) = S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))`.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Main Expression `E = S X Y Z`**\n\nNow we substitute our simplified terms back into `E = S X Y Z`.\n*   `X = I` (`one`)\n*   `Y = S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))`\n*   `Z = 3` (`three`)\n\nUsing the reduction rule `S X Y Z = X Z (Y Z)`:\n`E = I Z (Y Z) = Z (Y Z)`\n\nThis means the value of the final Church numeral `n` is derived from the expression `three (Y three)`. Using our exponentiation rule `M N -> val(N)^val(M)`, this corresponds to the value:\n`n = value(Y three) ^ value(three)`\nSince `value(three) = 3`, we have:\n`n = value(Y 3)^3`\n\n**Step 5: Evaluating the Sub-expression `Y 3`**\n\nNow we need to find the integer value of the expression `Y 3`.\n`Y 3 = (S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))) 3`\nThis is again in the form `S x y z`, where:\n*   `x = I`\n*   `y = S(I)(K(2))`\n*   `z = 3`\nApplying the rule `S x y z = x z (y z)`:\n`Y 3 = I 3 ( (S(I)(K(2))) 3 ) = 3 ( (S(I)(K(2))) 3 )`\nSo, `value(Y 3) = value( (S(I)(K(2))) 3 ) ^ value(3)`\n`value(Y 3) = value( (S(I)(K(2))) 3 )^3`\n\n**Step 6: Evaluating the Innermost Expression `(S(I)(K(2))) 3`**\n\nLet's find the value of this last piece.\n`(S(I)(K(2))) 3` is also of the form `S x y z`, where:\n*   `x = I`\n*   `y = K(2)`\n*   `z = 3`\nApplying the rule `S x y z = x z (y z)`:\n`(S(I)(K(2))) 3 = I 3 ( (K(2)) 3 ) = 3 ( K 2 3 )`\nNow, we use the `K` rule: `K x y = x`. So, `K 2 3 = 2`.\nThe expression becomes `3 2`.\n\nAs established in Step 3, `3 2` is a Church numeral expression for `2^3 = 8`.\nSo, `value((S(I)(K(2))) 3) = 8`.\n\n**Step 7: Back-Substituting to Find `n`**\n\nNow we substitute the values back up the chain.\n*   We found `value((S(I)(K(2))) 3) = 8`.\n*   From Step 5, `value(Y 3) = (8)^3 = 512`.\n*   From Step 4, `n = value(Y 3)^3 = (512)^3`.\n\nSo, `n = 512^3`.\n\n**Step 8: Final Calculation of `log_2(n)`**\n\nThe final step is to calculate `log_2(n)`.\n`n = 512^3`\nWe know that `512 = 2^9`.\nSo, `n = (2^9)^3 = 2^(9 * 3) = 2^27`.\n\nTherefore, `log_2(n) = log_2(2^27) = 27`.\n\n<<<27>>>"
