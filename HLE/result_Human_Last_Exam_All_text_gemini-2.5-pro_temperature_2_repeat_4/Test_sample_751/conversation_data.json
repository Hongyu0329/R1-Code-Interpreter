    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality and find the new matrix C.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Duality Principle**\n\nThe principle of duality in linear systems states that the observability of a system (A, C) is equivalent to the controllability of its dual system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ). Furthermore, the transformation that converts a system to its observer canonical form is related to the transformation that converts its dual system to its controller canonical form.\n\nSpecifically, if (A_c, B_c) is the controller canonical form for the system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ), then the observer canonical form for the original system (A, C) is given by (A_o, C_o) where:\n*   A_o = A_cᵀ\n*   C_o = B_cᵀ\n\nOur goal is to find the new output matrix C_o. To do this, we must first find the B matrix (B_c) of the controller canonical form of the dual system.\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Dual System**\n\nThe original system is given by:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe dual system is (A_d, B_d), where A_d = Aᵀ and B_d = Cᵀ.\n*   A_d = Aᵀ = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\n*   B_d = Cᵀ = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n\nThe state dimension is n=3, and the number of inputs to the dual system is m=2. Let the columns of B_d be b_d1 and b_d2:\n*   b_d1 = [0, 1, 0]ᵀ\n*   b_d2 = [1, 1, 0]ᵀ\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Controllability of the Dual System**\n\nTo find the controller canonical form, we first need to check the controllability and determine the controllability indices. The controllability matrix Q_c for the dual system is given by:\nQ_c = [B_d | A_d B_d | A_d² B_d]\n\nLet's compute the necessary terms:\n*   A_d * b_d1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]ᵀ = [2, 1, 1]ᵀ\n*   A_d * b_d2 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [1, 1, 0]ᵀ = [3, 2, 1]ᵀ\n\nThe controllability matrix columns are ordered as [b_d1, b_d2, A_d*b_d1, A_d*b_d2, ...].\nQ_c = [[0, 1, 2, 3, ...],\n       [1, 1, 1, 2, ...],\n       [0, 0, 1, 1, ...]]\n\nWe select n=3 linearly independent (LI) vectors by searching the columns of Q_c in order:\n1.  **v1 = b_d1 = [0, 1, 0]ᵀ**. This vector is non-zero, so it's selected.\n2.  **v2 = b_d2 = [1, 1, 0]ᵀ**. This is linearly independent of v1.\n3.  **v3 = A_d*b_d1 = [2, 1, 1]ᵀ**. We check if this is LI from {v1, v2}.\n    det([v1 v2 v3]) = det([[0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]]) = -1 * (1*1 - 0*1) = -1 ≠ 0.\n    The vectors {v1, v2, v3} are linearly independent and form a basis for R³.\n\nThe structure of the canonical form depends on which vectors were selected. Since we took one vector associated with b_d2 (b_d2 itself) and two vectors associated with b_d1 (b_d1 and A_d*b_d1), the controllability indices are μ₁=2 and μ₂=1.\n\n### **Step 4: Find the B Matrix of the Controller Canonical Form (B_c)**\n\nThe transformation to a controller canonical form involves changing the basis of the state space. Let the new basis vectors be the LI vectors we found, ordered according to their chains:\n*   p₁ = b_d1\n*   p₂ = A_d * b_d1\n*   p₃ = b_d2\n\nThe transformation matrix P (which transforms coordinates from the new basis to the standard basis) is formed by these vectors as columns:\nP = [p₁ p₂ p₃] = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]\n\nThe new state z_c is related to the old state z by z = P z_c, or z_c = P⁻¹z. The matrices in the new (canonical) form are:\n*   A_c = P⁻¹ A_d P\n*   B_c = P⁻¹ B_d\n\nWe only need to find C_o = B_cᵀ, so we focus on computing B_c.\nB_c = P⁻¹ B_d = P⁻¹ [b_d1 b_d2] = [P⁻¹b_d1, P⁻¹b_d2]\n\nBy the construction of P, b_d1 is the first column of P (p₁) and b_d2 is the third column (p₃).\n*   p₁ = P * [1, 0, 0]ᵀ. Therefore, P⁻¹p₁ = [1, 0, 0]ᵀ.\n*   p₃ = P * [0, 0, 1]ᵀ. Therefore, P⁻¹p₃ = [0, 0, 1]ᵀ.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for B_c:\nB_c = [[1, 0, 0]ᵀ, [0, 0, 1]ᵀ] = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]\n\n### **Step 5: Find the New C Matrix (C_o)**\n\nUsing the duality principle, the new output matrix C_o for the observer canonical form is the transpose of B_c.\nC_o = B_cᵀ = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n\nThe value of the new matrix C is [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]].\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
