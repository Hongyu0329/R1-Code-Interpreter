    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points of the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$.\n\n**1. Identify the curve and its basic properties.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is 5. The genus of the curve is $g = \\lfloor (\\deg(f)-1)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\n\n**2. Analyze the reduction of the curve modulo 2.**\nReducing the equation modulo 2, we get:\n$y^2 \\equiv 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + x^2 + 0x \\pmod{2}$\n$y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$\nThis reduction is a double line ($y=x$), which is a singular, non-reduced curve. This means the curve $C$ has bad reduction at $p=2$. To find the stable reduction, we need to resolve the singularities. The number of double points (nodes) in the stable reduction is an important invariant.\n\n**3. Locate the branch points of the curve.**\nThe branch points of the curve are the roots of $f(x)=0$ and the point at infinity.\n$f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$.\nOne branch point is $x_0 = 0$.\nThe other branch points are the roots of the polynomial $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. Let these roots be $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$.\nThe point at infinity is also a branch point because the degree of $f(x)$ is odd.\nThe set of 6 branch points is $B = \\{0, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$.\n\n**4. Determine the 2-adic valuations of the branch points.**\nWe use the Newton polygon method for the polynomial $g(x)$ over the 2-adic field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nThe coefficients are $(a_4, a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0) = (8, 4, 4, 1, 8)$.\nThe 2-adic valuations of the coefficients are $(v_2(a_4), v_2(a_3), v_2(a_2), v_2(a_1), v_2(a_0)) = (3, 2, 2, 0, 3)$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(a_i))$.\nWe plot the points $(0, v_2(a_0))=(0,3)$, $(1, v_2(a_1))=(1,0)$, $(2, v_2(a_2))=(2,2)$, $(3, v_2(a_3))=(3,2)$, $(4, v_2(a_4))=(4,3)$.\nThe lower convex hull of these points is formed by the segments connecting:\n- $(0,3)$ to $(1,0)$: The slope is $(0-3)/(1-0) = -3$. The horizontal length is 1. This corresponds to one root, say $\\alpha_1$, with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_1) = -(-3) = 3$.\n- $(1,0)$ to $(3,2)$: The slope is $(2-0)/(3-1) = 1$. The horizontal length is 2. This corresponds to two roots, say $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3$, with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_2) = v_2(\\alpha_3) = -1$.\n- $(3,2)$ to $(4,3)$: The slope is $(3-2)/(4-3) = 1$. The horizontal length is 1. This corresponds to one root, say $\\alpha_4$, with valuation $v_2(\\alpha_4) = -1$.\nSo, the valuations of the finite branch points (roots of $f(x)$) are:\n- $v_2(0) = \\infty$\n- $v_2(\\alpha_1) = 3$\n- $v_2(\\alpha_2) = v_2(\\alpha_3) = v_2(\\alpha_4) = -1$\n\n**5. Partition the branch points based on their reduction.**\nThe reduction of a point $z \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2$ is its image in the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Points with $v_2(z)>0$ reduce to 0. Points with $v_2(z)=0$ reduce to 1. Points with $v_2(z)<0$ reduce to $\\infty$.\n- $0$: reduces to 0.\n- $\\alpha_1$ ($v_2(\\alpha_1)=3 > 0$): reduces to 0.\n- $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4$ ($v_2 < 0$): reduce to $\\infty$.\n- $\\infty$: reduces to $\\infty$.\nThis partitions the branch points into two clusters:\n- $B_0 = \\{0, \\alpha_1\\}$ which reduce to 0.\n- $B_\\infty = \\{\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$ which reduce to $\\infty$.\n\n**6. Calculate the total length of the minimal tree connecting the branch points.**\nThe stable model of the curve is intimately related to the minimal tree $S(B)$ in the Berkovich space $\\mathbb{P}^{1,an}_{\\mathbb{Q}_2}$ whose leaves are the branch points. The number of nodes is related to the total length of this tree.\nThe total length $L(B)$ is the sum of the lengths of the sub-trees for each cluster plus the length of the \"bridge\" connecting them.\n- **Length for cluster $B_0$:** The minimal tree connecting $\\{0, \\alpha_1\\}$ is a single segment. Its length is the 2-adic distance $d(0, \\alpha_1) = v_2(\\alpha_1 - 0) = v_2(\\alpha_1) = 3$. So, $L(B_0)=3$.\n- **Length for cluster $B_\\infty$:** To analyze the geometry of $\\{\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\infty\\}$, we change coordinates to $z=1/x$. The branch points become $\\{1/\\alpha_2, 1/\\alpha_3, 1/\\alpha_4, 0\\}$. Let this set be $B'_\\infty$. The valuations are $v_2(1/\\alpha_i) = -v_2(\\alpha_i) = 1$ for $i=2,3,4$, and $v_2(0)=\\infty$. All these points reduce to 0.\nWe compute the pairwise distances: $d(0, 1/\\alpha_i) = v_2(1/\\alpha_i) = 1$. For $i,j \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$, $d(1/\\alpha_i, 1/\\alpha_j) = v_2(1/\\alpha_i-1/\\alpha_j) = 1$ (this can be shown by analyzing the roots of the transformed polynomial $H(X)=64X^4+16X^3+8X^2+X+4=0$, where $x=2X$, showing the residues of $X_i=\\alpha_i/2$ are distinct).\nA set of 4 points where all pairwise distances are 1 forms a \"star-shaped\" tree with a central vertex and four legs of length $1/2$. The total length is $4 \\times (1/2) = 2$. So, $L(B_\\infty)=2$.\n- **Length of the bridge:** The two clusters are separated by the standard partition of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ into points of norm $\\le 1$ and norm $>1$. The edge in the tree corresponding to this partition has length 1. So, $L_{\\text{bridge}} = 1$.\nThe total length of the tree is $L(B) = L(B_0) + L(B_\\infty) + L_{\\text{bridge}} = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6$.\n\n**7. Compute the number of double points.**\nFor a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g$ with branch point set $B$, the number of double points (nodes) $\\delta$ in its stable reduction is given by the formula:\n$\\delta = L(B) - (g-1)$\nPlugging in the values we found:\n$g=2$\n$L(B) = 6$\n$\\delta = 6 - (2-1) = 5$.\n\nThe stable reduction of the given curve has 5 double points."
