    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number `m`.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem's Core Constraint**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum number `m` such that `m` white queens and `m` black queens can be placed on a 16x16 chessboard. The key constraint is \"without attacking each other\". This phrasing implies that no queen on the board can attack any other queen, regardless of its color. A white queen cannot attack another white queen, a black queen cannot attack another black queen, and a white queen cannot attack a black queen.\n\n**Step 2: Simplifying the Problem**\n\nSince the rule \"no attacking\" applies to all queens equally, the colors of the queens are just labels. We can think of the problem as finding the maximum number of queens of a single type that can be placed on the board without attacking each other. The total number of queens we are placing is `m` (white) + `m` (black) = `2m`.\n\nSo, the problem simplifies to: What is the maximum number of non-attacking queens that can be placed on a 16x16 board? Let's call this maximum number `Q_max`.\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Maximum Number of Non-Attacking Queens on an N×N Board**\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. Let's consider an N×N board.\nA fundamental rule of chess is that a queen attacks every square in its row.\nIf we place `Q` non-attacking queens, each queen must occupy its own row.\nSince a 16x16 board has only 16 rows, we can place at most 16 non-attacking queens. If we were to place a 17th queen, by the Pigeonhole Principle, it would have to share a row with one of the first 16 queens, leading to an attack.\nThe same logic applies to columns.\n\nTherefore, on an N×N board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens is `N`.\nFor our 16x16 board, `N=16`. So, `Q_max = 16`.\n\n**Step 4: Relating the Maximum Number of Queens to `m`**\n\nThe total number of queens placed on the board is `2m`.\nThis total number cannot exceed the absolute maximum number of non-attacking queens possible on the board.\nSo, we can set up the inequality:\n`2m <= Q_max`\nSubstituting the value we found for `Q_max`:\n`2m <= 16`\n\n**Step 5: Solving for `m`**\n\nTo find the maximum value of `m`, we solve the inequality:\n`m <= 16 / 2`\n`m <= 8`\nThis tells us that the maximum possible integer value for `m` is 8.\n\n**Step 6: Verifying the Solution**\n\nWe must confirm that `m=8` is actually achievable.\nIf `m=8`, the total number of queens is `2 * 8 = 16`.\nIs it possible to place 16 non-attacking queens on a 16x16 board? Yes, this is the standard \"16-Queens Problem\". It is a well-known result that the N-Queens problem has solutions for all N ≥ 4. Since 16 is greater than 4, there exists at least one configuration where 16 queens can be placed on a 16x16 board without attacking each other.\n\nOnce we have such a valid placement of 16 queens, we can simply label any 8 of them as \"white\" and the remaining 8 as \"black\". Since none of the 16 queens attack any other, this configuration perfectly satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum number `m` is 8."
