No, it is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics is designed to model physical reality and its measurable properties, whereas Gödel's proof is a formal argument in abstract modal logic dealing with metaphysical concepts. There is no way to translate the core concepts of Gödel's proof (like "positive property" or "necessary existence") into the language of quantum mechanics (like Hilbert spaces and operators), making the two domains fundamentally incompatible for this purpose.
