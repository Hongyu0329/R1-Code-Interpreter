    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about a specific event in William Morris's novel, *The House of the Wolfings*. It asks for the name of a character who performs a specific action.\n\n2.  **Break Down the Question's Key Elements:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings*\n    *   **Character Action 1:** Visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Character Action 2:** Described the city's religious practices.\n    *   **Specific Detail of Description:** The description must contain a reference that readers would recognize as the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Novel's Context:** *The House of the Wolfings* is set during the late Roman Empire and focuses on a Gothic tribe, the Markmen (of whom the Wolfings are a clan), defending their homeland from Roman legions. This context makes an interaction with Roman culture, including a visit to a Roman city, a plausible plot point.\n\n4.  **Search for the Relevant Scene:** We need to recall or find the part of the book where a character discusses their past travels into Roman territory. This occurs early in the narrative, specifically in Chapter II, titled \"The Dwelling of the Day\".\n\n5.  **Identify the Character:** In this chapter, the main protagonist, **Thiodolf**, the War-Duke of the Markmen, is speaking with his foster-daughter, Hall-Sun. He recounts tales of his youth, including a journey he made south into the lands of the \"Welsh\" (the Goths' term for the Romans).\n\n6.  **Examine the Description of Religious Practices:** During his tale, Thiodolf describes entering a Roman city and visiting one of their temples (\"the house of their Gods\"). Inside, he saw a significant image. He describes it from his own \"barbarian\" perspective, without understanding its mythological importance.\n\n7.  **Pinpoint the Romulus and Remus Reference:** Thiodolf's exact description is of a graven image of **\"a she-wolf giving suck to two man-children.\"** He puzzles over its meaning, but any reader familiar with classical history or mythology will immediately recognize this as a depiction of the Capitoline Wolf suckling the infants Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome. This fulfills the final and most specific requirement of the question.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Character's Perspective:** The key to this scene is the narrative technique. Thiodolf sees the iconic Roman symbol but doesn't understand it. The description is literal, not interpretative. This gap between the character's understanding and the reader's knowledge is a crucial literary device.\n*   **Terminology:** The Goths in the book refer to the Romans as \"the Welsh,\" a historical term used by Germanic peoples to refer to Romanized Celtic and Italic peoples.\n*   **Scene Location:** This pivotal conversation happens in the Great Roof of the Wolfings, with Thiodolf recounting past events rather than experiencing them in the story's present.\n*   **The Character:** Thiodolf's experience in the Roman city is part of his backstory, establishing him as a man who has traveled and seen the world beyond his own tribe, giving him a broader perspective than his kinsmen.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy methodically breaking down the question and cross-referencing it with the plot and character details of *The House of the Wolfings*, we can confidently identify the character who performed these actions. The character is the protagonist, Thiodolf, and the description is a direct, yet naive, account of the Romulus and Remus foundation myth statue.\n\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
