    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function `f`\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = e^x$. We want to find the cardinality of $S$, denoted as $|S|$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Let's assume $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. The given equation tells us this is equivalent to $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function $y=e^x$ is injective, this implies $x_1=x_2$. Therefore, any function $f \\in S$ must be injective.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** The problem states that $f$ is continuous. A continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Composition's Monotonicity:** The function $g(x) = f(f(x)) = e^x$ is a strictly increasing function.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then for $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ again preserves the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This is consistent with $e^x$ being increasing.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then for $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ again reverses the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This is also consistent with $e^x$ being increasing.\n\nSo, we must analyze two cases: $f$ being strictly increasing and $f$ being strictly decreasing.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly decreasing\nLet's assume $f$ is a continuous, strictly decreasing function.\n\n1.  **Limits at infinity:**\n    Let $L = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$ and $U = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$. Since $f$ is a decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, we must have $L < U$.\n    *   Consider the limit as $x \\to \\infty$:\n        $f(f(x)) = e^x \\to \\infty$.\n        As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches $L$ from above (i.e., $f(x) \\to L^+$).\n        So, we have $\\lim_{y\\to L^+} f(y) = \\infty$.\n        For a continuous decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, an infinite limit can only occur at $\\pm\\infty$. So, we must have $L = -\\infty$.\n    *   Consider the limit as $x \\to -\\infty$:\n        $f(f(x)) = e^x \\to 0$.\n        As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches $U$ from below (i.e., $f(x) \\to U^-$).\n        So, we have $\\lim_{y\\to U^-} f(y) = 0$.\n        If $U = \\infty$, then $\\lim_{y\\to\\infty} f(y) = L = -\\infty$. This leads to $0 = -\\infty$, a contradiction. So $U$ must be a finite real number.\n        By continuity, $\\lim_{y\\to U^-} f(y) = f(U)$. So, $f(U)=0$.\n\n2.  **Range analysis:**\n    From the limit analysis, we have $L = -\\infty$ and $U \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The range of $f$ is $(L, U) = (-\\infty, U)$.\n    The range of the composite function $f \\circ f$ is $f(\\text{range of } f) = f((-\\infty, U))$.\n    Since $f$ is decreasing, the range is given by $f((-\\infty, U)) = (\\lim_{y\\to U^-} f(y), \\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} f(y))$.\n    From our previous findings, $\\lim_{y\\to U^-} f(y) = f(U) = 0$, and by definition, $\\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} f(y) = U$.\n    So, the range of $f \\circ f$ is $(0, U)$.\n\n3.  **Contradiction:**\n    The equation $f(f(x))=e^x$ implies that the range of $f \\circ f$ is the range of $e^x$, which is $(0, \\infty)$.\n    Comparing the two results for the range, we get $(0, U) = (0, \\infty)$, which implies $U = \\infty$.\n    This contradicts our conclusion from step 1 that $U$ must be a finite real number.\n    Therefore, the assumption that $f$ is strictly decreasing must be false. There are no strictly decreasing solutions.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the case where `f` is strictly increasing\nLet's assume $f$ is a continuous, strictly increasing function.\n\n1.  **Relation between f(x) and x:** A continuous function with no fixed points must satisfy either $f(x)>x$ for all $x$ or $f(x)<x$ for all $x$. A fixed point $x_0$ would mean $f(x_0)=x_0$, leading to $f(f(x_0))=f(x_0)=x_0$. But $f(f(x_0)) = e^{x_0}$, so we'd need $e^{x_0}=x_0$, which has no real solutions. So $f$ has no fixed points.\n    If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would imply $e^x < x$, which is false for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Construction of solutions:** We can construct these solutions by defining $f$ on a \"seed\" interval and then uniquely extending it to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   Let's define $f(0)$. Let $f(0)=c$. From $f(x)>x$, we have $c>0$.\n    *   From the original equation, $f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$. This means $f(c)=1$.\n    *   Since $f$ is strictly increasing and $c>0$, we have $f(c) > f(0)$, which implies $1>c$.\n    *   So, we must choose a constant $c \\in (0,1)$.\n    *   Now, we can define the \"seed\" of the function. Let $f$ on the interval $[0, c]$ be an arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi: [0, c] \\to [c, 1]$ such that $\\phi(0)=c$ and $\\phi(c)=1$.\n    *   This initial definition can be extended uniquely to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the functional equations $f(y) = e^{f^{-1}(y)}$ and $f(x)=f^{-1}(e^x)$. For example, we defined $f$ on $[0, c]$. The range is $[c, 1]$. For any $y \\in [c,1]$, we define $f(y) = f(f(\\phi^{-1}(y))) = e^{\\phi^{-1}(y)}$. This defines $f$ on $[c,1]$. We can continue this process inductively to define $f$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n3.  **Cardinality of the set of solutions:** Each distinct choice of the pair $(c, \\phi)$ will generate a unique solution $f$. We need to find the number of possible such pairs.\n    *   **Choice of c:** The constant $c$ can be any real number in the interval $(0,1)$. The cardinality of $(0,1)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   **Choice of $\\phi$:** For any fixed $c \\in (0,1)$, we need to count the number of continuous, strictly increasing functions $\\phi$ from $[0,c]$ to $[c,1]$. We can show there are $2^{\\aleph_0}$ such functions. For instance, pick any point $x_0 \\in (0,c)$ (e.g., $x_0=c/2$). We can choose its image $\\phi(x_0)$ to be any value in $(c,1)$. The set of possible values for $\\phi(x_0)$ has cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$. For each such choice, we can construct a valid $\\phi$ (e.g., by connecting $(0,c)$, $(x_0, \\phi(x_0))$, and $(c,1)$ with line segments). Since different choices of $\\phi(x_0)$ create different functions, there are at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$ choices for $\\phi$. Since the set of all continuous functions on $[0,c]$ has cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$, there are at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$ choices. Thus, for each $c$, there are exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$ choices for $\\phi$.\n\n4.  **Total Cardinality:** The total number of solutions is the number of possible pairs $(c, \\phi)$. This is (number of choices for $c$) $\\times$ (number of choices for $\\phi$).\n    $|S| = |(0,1)| \\times |\\{\\phi\\}| = (2^{\\aleph_0}) \\times (2^{\\aleph_0}) = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe set of continuous functions satisfying $f(f(x)) = e^x$ consists only of strictly increasing functions. The number of such functions is equal to the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThe cardinality of the set is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<2^{\\aleph_0}>>>"
