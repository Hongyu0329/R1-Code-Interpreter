    "Of course, let's break down the question to find the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core of the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific \"book of manners\" that was physically preserved in the same collection (a manuscript) as the poem \"Sir Launfal\". This is a question about the physical history and contents of a specific medieval manuscript.\n\n**Step 2: Identify \"Sir Launfal\" and its source**\n\"Sir Launfal\" is a 14th-century Middle English romance poem, an Arthurian tale written by Thomas Chestre. To know what it was \"preserved alongside,\" we must identify the manuscript in which it survives.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Manuscript**\nResearch shows that Thomas Chestre's \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in only one single manuscript. This makes our task simpler, as we only need to examine the contents of this specific document. The manuscript is known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**, which is housed in the British Library.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the Contents of the Manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii**\nThis manuscript is a well-known anthology or miscellany, meaning it contains several different works bound together. Its contents include a variety of texts, primarily other romances like *Libeaus Desconus* and *The Eglamour of Artois*.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the \"Book of Manners\" within the Manuscript**\nAmong the collection of romances and other poems in Cotton Caligula A.ii, there is a text that fits the description of a \"book of manners.\" Such books, also called \"courtesy books,\" were popular in the Middle Ages and gave instructions on etiquette and proper social behavior. The specific work in this manuscript is a poem on courtesy. It is titled **\"The Boke of Curtasye\"** (often modernized as \"The Book of Courtesy\"). This poem details how a young person, particularly a page or squire, should behave in the household of a great lord.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Uniqueness of the Source:** The most critical point is that \"Sir Launfal\" exists in only *one* known manuscript. If it were in multiple manuscripts, they might have been bound with different books of manners or none at all, making the question ambiguous.\n2.  **Identifying the Genre:** It is important to correctly distinguish the \"book of manners\" from the other works in the manuscript. While \"Sir Launfal\" is a romance (a story of adventure and chivalry), \"The Boke of Curtasye\" is a didactic or instructional text on social conduct.\n3.  **Spelling:** Be aware of Middle English spelling variations. \"Boke\" for \"Book\" and \"Curtasye\" for \"Courtesy\" are typical of the period. The answer could be given in either its original or modernized spelling.\n4.  **Manuscript as a Collection:** Understanding that a single medieval manuscript often functions as an anthology is key to framing the question. The person who compiled Cotton Caligula A.ii deliberately chose to include these specific texts together.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy identifying the unique manuscript containing \"Sir Launfal\" (Cotton Caligula A.ii) and then examining its table of contents, we can definitively identify the book of manners it was preserved alongside.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
