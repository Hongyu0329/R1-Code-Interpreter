No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They are fundamentally different classes of biopolymers. Polysaccharides are polymers of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds, composed of C, H, and O. Polynucleotides are polymers of nucleotides (sugar + phosphate + base) linked by phosphodiester bonds, and they always contain C, H, O, N, and P.
