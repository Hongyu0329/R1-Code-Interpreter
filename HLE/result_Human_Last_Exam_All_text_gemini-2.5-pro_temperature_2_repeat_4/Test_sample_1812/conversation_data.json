    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the question**\n\nThe question asks for the determinant of the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". It then provides a specific matrix `A` using the phrase \"where:\".\n\\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nThe most straightforward interpretation is that the question is asking to compute the determinant of the matrix `A` as given. The descriptive name \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" serves as a technical label for matrix `A` within a specific theoretical context. The value \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) and the term \"Markov quiver\" are contextual information and are not needed for the calculation itself, as the matrix is explicitly defined.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Identify the target matrix:** The wording strongly suggests that the matrix we need to work with is the one explicitly written out, which is `A`.\n*   **Relevance of extra information:** The phrases \"Markov quiver\" and \"m_1/2 = 13\" might be confusing. However, without further instructions on how to use this information to modify matrix `A`, it should be treated as context. In many scientific and mathematical contexts, this matrix `A` is fundamental and doesn't change based on parameters like `m`. For instance, it is the Cartan matrix of the affine Lie algebra \\( \\tilde{A}_2 \\).\n*   **Choose a method for calculation:** For a 3x3 matrix, the determinant can be computed in several ways: the Sarrus rule, cofactor expansion, row reduction, or by finding eigenvalues. Using a property of the matrix can be the quickest and least error-prone method.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Matrix Properties**\n\nLet's examine the matrix `A` for any special properties that might simplify the calculation of its determinant.\nA key property of a square matrix is the relationship between its rows and columns. Let's sum the elements of each row:\n*   **Sum of Row 1:**  \\( 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0 \\)\n*   **Sum of Row 2:**  \\( -1 + 2 + (-1) = 0 \\)\n*   **Sum of Row 3:**  \\( -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0 \\)\n\nWe observe that the sum of the elements in every row is 0.\n\n**Step 3: Connecting Matrix Properties to the Determinant**\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem in linear algebra regarding this property:\n*   If the sum of the entries in each row (or each column) of a square matrix is 0, then the matrix is singular, which means its determinant is 0.\n\n**Why this is true:**\nThis property implies that the column vectors of the matrix are linearly dependent. Specifically, the sum of the column vectors is the zero vector:\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2-1-1 \\\\ -1+2-1 \\\\ -1-1+2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\nSince the columns are linearly dependent, the matrix does not have full rank, and thus its determinant must be zero.\n\nAlternatively, this property means that the vector `v = [1, 1, 1]^T` is in the null space of the matrix `A`, because `A * v = [0, 0, 0]^T`. This is equivalent to saying that `v` is an eigenvector of `A` with an eigenvalue of 0. The determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. Since one of its eigenvalues is 0, the determinant must be 0.\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation (for confirmation)**\n\nWe can also compute the determinant directly using the Sarrus rule for a 3x3 matrix:\n`det(A) = (2 * 2 * 2) + (-1 * -1 * -1) + (-1 * -1 * -1) - (-1 * 2 * -1) - (2 * -1 * -1) - (2 * -1 * -1)`\n`det(A) = 8 + (-1) + (-1) - (2) - (2) - (2)`\n`det(A) = 8 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 2`\n`det(A) = 6 - 6 = 0`\n\nBoth methods confirm the result.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the direct calculation and the properties of the matrix `A`, its determinant is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
