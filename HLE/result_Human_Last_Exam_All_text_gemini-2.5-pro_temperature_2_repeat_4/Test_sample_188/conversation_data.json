    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the maximum possible length of a secret message. This message's length is measured in the number of characters it contains.\n\n2.  **Identify the Building Blocks of the Message (The Alphabet):**\n    *   The problem states, \"the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters\".\n    *   It also says the secret message is \"written using the letters in the Shu\".\n    *   Therefore, the alphabet for the secret message consists of **120 unique characters**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Medium for Encryption (The Code):**\n    *   The secret message is encrypted using the symbols in the book called Ching.\n    *   The Ching contains **exactly 9999 symbols**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Unique Symbols Available for Encoding:**\n    *   The symbols in the Ching are of the \"yinyang-wuxing\" type.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has two possibilities: yin and yang (2 states).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (The Five Elements/Phases) has five possibilities: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water (5 states).\n    *   To find the total number of unique symbol types, we multiply the possibilities: 2 (yinyang) * 5 (wuxing) = **10 unique symbols**.\n    *   This means our encoding system is effectively a base-10 system, as each position in the code can be one of 10 different symbols.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Symbols Needed per Message Character:**\n    *   We need to use a sequence of symbols from the Ching to represent one character from the Shu. Let's call the length of this sequence 'n'.\n    *   With 'n' symbols, where each symbol can be one of 10 types, we can create `10^n` unique combinations.\n    *   We must be able to represent all 120 characters of our message alphabet. Therefore, the number of combinations (`10^n`) must be greater than or equal to the size of the alphabet (120).\n    *   We need to find the smallest integer 'n' that satisfies the inequality: `10^n >= 120`.\n        *   If n = 1, `10^1 = 10`. This is less than 120, so 1 symbol is not enough.\n        *   If n = 2, `10^2 = 100`. This is less than 120, so 2 symbols are not enough.\n        *   If n = 3, `10^3 = 1000`. This is greater than 120, so 3 symbols are sufficient to uniquely represent each of the 120 characters.\n    *   Therefore, we need a sequence of **3 symbols** from the Ching to encode one character of the secret message.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Message Length:**\n    *   The Ching provides a total of 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each character of the message requires 3 of these symbols.\n    *   To find the maximum number of characters we can encode, we divide the total number of available symbols by the number of symbols required per character.\n    *   Maximum Message Length = (Total Symbols in Ching) / (Symbols per Character)\n    *   Maximum Message Length = 9999 / 3\n    *   Maximum Message Length = **3333** characters.\n\n### Careful Points and Red Herrings\n\n*   **Red Herring 1: Computational Times:** The information about character recognition time (12 ms) and operation times for integers (10 ns) and floats (30 ns) is completely irrelevant to calculating the storage capacity (maximum length) of the message. It's extraneous data designed to complicate the problem.\n*   **Red Herring 2: Shu Book Length:** The fact that the Shu contains \"around 3000\" characters is also irrelevant. The critical piece of information about the Shu is the size of its alphabet (120 characters), not its own length.\n*   **Implicit Information:** The number of unique symbols (10) is not stated directly but must be derived from the description \"yinyang-wuxing\". This is a crucial step.\n*   **The \"Maximum\" Keyword:** The question asks for the \"max length\", which implies finding the most efficient encoding scheme. Using the minimum number of symbols per character (which is 3) yields the maximum possible message length.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
