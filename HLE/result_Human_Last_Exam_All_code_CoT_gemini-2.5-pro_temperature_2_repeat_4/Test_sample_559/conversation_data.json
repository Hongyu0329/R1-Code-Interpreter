    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Equilibrium Points:** First, I will find the equilibrium points of the system. These are the points `(u, d)` where the rates of change `u'(t)` and `d'(t)` are both zero.\n2.  **Analyze Stability:** Next, I will analyze the stability of these equilibrium points by examining the Jacobian matrix of the system at each point. This will help us identify any saddle points, which are crucial for finding separatrices.\n3.  **Find the Separatrix:** A separatrix is a trajectory that divides the phase plane into regions with distinct long-term behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices. I will look for a simple analytic curve `d = f(u)` that is both a solution to the system's trajectory equation and passes through a saddle point.\n4.  **Formulate a Candidate Solution:** I will hypothesize that the separatrix can be described by a low-degree polynomial, `d(u) = a*u^2 + b*u + c`. By substituting this into the system's trajectory equation, `dd/du = d'/u'`, I can derive a set of algebraic equations for the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n5.  **Solve for the Coefficients:** Solving the system of algebraic equations will yield one or more candidate trajectories.\n6.  **Identify the Separatrix:** Finally, I will identify the correct separatrix by checking which of the candidate trajectories passes through the saddle point we identified earlier.\n\nBased on this plan, my analysis shows that the saddle point is located at `(u, d) = (1, -1)`. The curve that is both a trajectory and passes through this point is `d = -u^2`. This curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point and acts as a separatrix for the system.\n\nHere is the Python code that prints the equation for this separatrix.\n\n```python\n# Based on the analysis of the system of differential equations,\n# the separatrix is found by identifying an invariant manifold that\n# passes through the saddle point of the system, which is located at (u, d) = (1, -1).\n# The equation for this separatrix is d = -u^2.\n\n# We define the components of this equation to print them clearly.\n# The equation is of the form: d = coefficient * u^power\ncoefficient = -1\nvariable_name = \"u\"\npower = 2\n\n# We now print the equation for the separatrix, showing each number involved.\nprint(f\"The equation for the separatrix is:\")\nprint(f\"d = {coefficient} * {variable_name}**{power}\")\n```\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
