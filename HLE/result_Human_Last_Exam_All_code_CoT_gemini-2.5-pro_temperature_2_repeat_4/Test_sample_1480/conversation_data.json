    "To calculate the rule activation level, we need to combine the firing level of the rule's antecedent (`Phi_k(x′)`) and the membership degree of the consequent (`μG_k_j(y_j)`) using a t-norm operation. The most commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator. The process is straightforward:\n\n1.  **Identify Inputs:** The antecedent firing level is 0.7, and the consequent membership degree is 0.9.\n2.  **Apply T-Norm:** The rule activation level is the t-norm of these two values. Using the minimum t-norm, this will be `min(0.7, 0.9)`.\n3.  **Calculate Result:** The minimum of 0.7 and 0.9 is 0.7.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values\nphi_k = 0.7  # Firing level of the antecedent part\nmu_G_k_j = 0.9  # Membership degree of the consequent part\n\n# The rule activation level is computed by applying a t-norm to the antecedent\n# firing level and the consequent membership function.\n# We will use the minimum t-norm, which is the most common.\n# t_norm(a, b) = min(a, b)\nactivation_level = np.minimum(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n\nprint(\"The rule activation level is the result of the t-norm operation between the antecedent firing level and the consequent's membership degree.\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G_k_j})\")\nprint(f\"The calculated rule activation level is: {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
