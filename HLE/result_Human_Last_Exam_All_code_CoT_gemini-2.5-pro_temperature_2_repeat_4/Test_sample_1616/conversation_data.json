    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing:\n\n1.  **Define Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL):** TSL is a phonological rule where a tense vowel becomes lax when it is in the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable of a word. For this rule to apply, a word must have at least three syllables.\n\n2.  **Initial Analysis:** First, I will categorize the words based on their syllable count. This will separate the words that are candidates for TSL from those that are not.\n    *   Words with 3 or more syllables: `derivative`, `serenity`, `gratitude`.\n    *   Words with 2 syllables: `southern`, `pleasant`, `shadow`.\n\n3.  **Analyze 3+ Syllable Words:** I will check if `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` show the effects of TSL by comparing their vowels to those in related base words.\n    *   `derivative`: The lax /ɪ/ in the antepenultimate syllable `-riv-` contrasts with the tense /aɪ/ in `derive`. This word **has** undergone TSL.\n    *   `serenity`: The lax /ɛ/ in the antepenultimate syllable `-ren-` contrasts with the tense /iː/ in `serene`. This word **has** undergone TSL.\n    *   `gratitude`: The lax /æ/ in the antepenultimate syllable `grat-` contrasts with the tense /eɪ/ in the related word `grateful`. This word **has** undergone TSL.\n\n4.  **Analyze 2-Syllable Words:** Since `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow` have only two syllables, they cannot, by definition, undergo *trisyllabic* laxing. All three are potential answers. To find the single correct answer, a deeper historical analysis is required. The question is asking which word's lax vowel is not the result of a laxing process at all.\n\n5.  **Historical Analysis:**\n    *   `pleasant`: The lax vowel /ɛ/ results from the shortening of the tense vowel /iː/ found in the base word `please`. So, `pleasant` **did** undergo a laxing process (though not TSL).\n    *   `southern` and `shadow`: Historically, the lax vowels in these words are retentions of original short vowels from Old English. The corresponding tense vowels in `south` and `shade` are the result of later vowel lengthening processes that did not affect `southern` and `shadow`. Therefore, these two words did not \"undergo\" laxing; their vowels were never tense to begin with.\n\n6.  **Final Tie-Breaker:** Between `shadow` and `southern`, `shadow` is the stronger candidate. Both `shade` (via lengthening) and `shadow` (retention) derive from different forms of the *same* Old English word, `sceadu`. The pair `south`/`southern` derive from two related but distinct Old English words (`sūþ` and `suðerne`) which already had different vowel lengths. The case of `shadow` most clearly illustrates a vowel that did not undergo laxing, but rather retained its original quality while a related form underwent lengthening.\n\nThe Python code below formalizes this analysis to identify the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_trisyllabic_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing,\n    based on phonological and historical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    words_data = {\n        \"southern\": {\n            \"syllables\": 2,\n            \"base_word\": \"south\",\n            \"process\": \"Retention\",\n            \"explanation\": \"This 2-syllable word cannot undergo Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL).
