    "Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  First, I will research the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) to determine what they are known to eat.\n2.  My research indicates that adult snakeflies are predators, primarily feeding on small, soft-bodied insects like aphids. They are also known to supplement this diet with nectar and pollen for energy.\n3.  Next, I will evaluate each answer choice based on this information.\n    *   **A. Nectar:** This aligns with the fact that they consume sugary substances for energy.\n    *   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While they might eat pollen, Māhoe is a plant native to New Zealand, and snakeflies are not found there. This makes the specific choice questionable, even if the general food type (pollen) is plausible.\n    *   **C. Fungus:** This is not a known food source for snakeflies.\n    *   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Snakeflies are predators, not herbivores that eat leaf tissue.\n    *   **E. Totara Aphids:** Aphids are a classic prey item for snakeflies.\n4.  Based on this evaluation, both Nectar (A) and Aphids (E) are correct food sources.\n5.  Therefore, the most accurate answer is the one that combines both A and E. This corresponds to option F.\n6.  I will write a Python script that prints this reasoning and identifies the components of the final answer (A and E).\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to determine the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the known diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies):\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Known facts about their diet\n    fact1 = \"They are primarily predators, feeding on soft-bodied insects like aphids.\"\n    fact2 = \"They also supplement their diet with nectar and pollen for energy.\"\n    \n    print(\"Fact 1:\", fact1)\n    print(\"Fact 2:\", fact2)\n    print(\"\\nEvaluating the choices based on these facts:\")\n    \n    # Choice A evaluation\n    choice_a = \"A.
