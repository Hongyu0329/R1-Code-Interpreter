    "For a multi-color flow cytometry experiment, preparing the correct controls is crucial for obtaining reliable and reproducible data. The primary purposes of these controls are to set baseline fluorescence, compensate for spectral overlap between fluorochromes, and accurately define positive and negative populations for gating.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to determine the number of essential controls:\n1.  **Unstained Control**: First, we need a baseline control. This tube will contain only the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels to measure their natural autofluorescence in each channel. This is always one tube.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls**: When using multiple fluorochromes, their emission spectra can overlap, causing signal from one dye to \"spill over\" into another's detector. To correct this, we must prepare a separate control for each fluorochrome used. Since there are five channels (implying five different fluorochromes), we will need five single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls**: For a sorting experiment where the purity of the sorted population is critical, FMO controls are essential for accurate gating. An FMO control contains all the stains in your panel *except* for one. This helps you visualize the spread of fluorescence from the other colors into the \"empty\" channel, allowing for a much more precise gate setting than is possible with just single-stain controls. You will need one FMO control for each of the five fluorochromes.\n4.  **Calculation**: I will sum the number of tubes required for each type of control to get the final total.\n\nThe following Python script calculates and lists all the essential controls for your experiment.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the essential controls for a 5-color flow cytometry\n    sorting experiment using streptavidin beads.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the experiment parameters\n    fluorochromes = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_colors = len(fluorochromes)\n\n    # --- Explanation and Calculation of Controls ---\n    print(\"To ensure high-quality data and sorting purity in your 5-color experiment, the following controls are essential:\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
