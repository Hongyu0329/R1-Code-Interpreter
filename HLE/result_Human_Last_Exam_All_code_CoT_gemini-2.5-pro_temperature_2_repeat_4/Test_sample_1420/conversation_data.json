    "In the context of renormalization group theory, the epsilon (ϵ) expansion is a powerful technique for calculating critical exponents. The expansion is performed around the upper critical dimension, *d_c*, where mean-field theory becomes exact. For a wide class of systems described by the O(n) model (which includes the Ising model), the upper critical dimension is *d_c* = 4.\n\nThe expansion parameter is defined as ϵ = *d_c* - *d*, where *d* is the spatial dimension of the system. For the specific case requested, *d* = 3.\n\nThe scaling exponent for the specific heat, α, can be expressed as a power series in ϵ. To first order, the formula is:\n\nα = (4 - n) / (2(n + 8)) * ϵ\n\nHere, *n* represents the number of components of the order parameter. The problem does not specify *n*, so we will proceed with the most common case: the Ising model, where *n* = 1.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_specific_heat_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat exponent alpha using the first-order epsilon expansion\n    for the Ising model in d=3 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters for the calculation\n    d = 3  # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = 4  # Upper critical dimension for the O(n) model\n    n = 1  # Number of order parameter components (Ising model)\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the specific heat exponent (alpha) for a d={d} dimensional system.\")\n    print(\"We use the epsilon expansion near the upper critical dimension, d_c.\")\n    print(f\"For the O(n) class of models, the upper critical dimension is d_c = {d_c}.\")\n\n    # Calculate epsilon\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n    print(\"\\nThe expansion parameter epsilon is calculated as: epsilon = d_c - d\")\n    print(f\"epsilon = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAssuming the Ising model, the number of components of the order parameter is n = 1.\")\n    print(\"The first-order epsilon expansion for alpha is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"alpha = (4 - n) * epsilon / (2 * (n + 8))\")\n\n    # Substitute the values into the formula\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    denominator_part1 = n + 8\n    denominator = 2 * denominator_part1\n    \n    # Calculate the symbolic fraction for a clear representation\n    alpha_fraction = sympy.Rational(numerator * epsilon, denominator)\n    alpha_float = float(alpha_fraction)\n\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values n=1 and epsilon=1:\")\n    # Print the equation with numbers plugged in\n    print(f\"alpha = ({4} - {n}) * {epsilon} / ({2} * ({n} + {8}))\")\n    print(f\"alpha = {numerator} * {epsilon} / ({2} * {denominator_part1})\")\n    print(f\"alpha = {numerator * epsilon} / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"alpha = {alpha_fraction} ~= {alpha_float:.4f}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThus, the scaling exponent alpha to first order in epsilon is:\")\n    print(f\"{alpha_fraction}\")\n\ncalculate_specific_heat_exponent()\n\nalpha_val = sympy.Rational(1, 6)\n# Final answer block as requested\n# We need to output the numerical value.
