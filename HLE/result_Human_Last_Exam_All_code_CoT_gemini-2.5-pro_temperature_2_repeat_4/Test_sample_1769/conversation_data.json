    "This is a fascinating question of alternate linguistic history. To figure out what the word \"sister\" would be without Norse influence, we need to trace the original Old English word and follow its most likely path of evolution based on how similar words changed over time.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will start with the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word for sister, which is *sweostor*.\n2.  I will show how the actual modern word, \"sister,\" was influenced by the Old Norse word, *systir*.\n3.  Then, I will trace a hypothetical evolution of the Old English *sweostor* by looking at common sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English in words that were *not* heavily influenced by Norse.\n4.  This involves simplifying the initial consonants and shifting the vowels, resulting in the form that was actually common in southern English dialects, which experienced less Norse influence.\n5.  Finally, I'll present this alternate word as the likely modern equivalent.\n\nThe entire process will be demonstrated in a Python script that prints the explanation step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and reveals the Modern English word for 'sister'\n    if the Norse had never influenced the language.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the hypothetical evolution of the word 'sister' without Norse influence.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Define the historical words\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n    \n    # Explain the actual historical development\n    print(f\"The Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for sister was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"Our modern word 'sister' was heavily influenced by the Old Norse word '{old_norse_word}'.\")\n    print(\"The 'i' vowel and the hard 's' sound reflect this Norse influence.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Explain the hypothetical development\n    print(\"If the word had evolved purely from Old English, it would have followed a different path:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Starting point\n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: Start with the Old English word '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Evolution to Middle English\n    middle_english_word = \"suster\"\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: Through natural sound changes, '{old_english_word}' would likely become '{middle_english_word}' in Middle English.\")\n    print(f\"   - This form, '{middle_english_word}', was common in southern England, which had less Norse influence.\")\n    print(\"   - The initial 'sw-' simplified to 's-' and the 'eo' vowel shifted to 'u'.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Evolution to Modern English\n    modern_hypothetical_word = \"suster\"\n    print(f\"\\nStep 3: This Middle English form '{middle_english_word}' would have been retained into Modern English.\")\n    print(\"   - Similar to how 'sunne' became 'sun', 'suster' would remain 'suster'.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Therefore, without Norse influence, the Modern English word would be:\")\n    print(modern_hypothetical_word)\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
