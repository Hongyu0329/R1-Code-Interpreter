# The patient's BMI is a critical clue. A BMI of 18.5 kg/m^2 is on the borderline
# of being underweight and is a significant concern for an elderly patient
# recovering from a critical illness. It suggests malnutrition may be
# hindering his recovery.

# Let's assume a reasonable height for an adult male, for example, 1.78 meters (approx 5'10").
# We can use the BMI formula to estimate his weight to put his condition in perspective.
# Formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2
# Rearranged: weight (kg) = BMI * (height (m))^2

# Patient data
patient_bmi = 18.5
assumed_height_m = 1.78

# Calculate the estimated weight
estimated_weight_kg = patient_bmi * (assumed_height_m ** 2)

# Define BMI categories
def get_bmi_category(bmi):
    if bmi < 18.5:
        return "Underweight"
    elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:
        return "Normal weight"
    elif 25 <= bmi < 30:
        return "Overweight"
    else:
        return "Obese"

print("\nConclusion: The patient's very low body mass is a strong indicator of malnutrition, which is likely the primary reason for his profound weakness and inability to participate in rehabilitation. Addressing this is the top priority.")
