    "This is a problem in finite group theory. I will solve it by referring to the established mathematical literature that provides a complete answer to this question.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the key terms: finite group, product-free set, and maximal by inclusion product-free set.\n2.  State the user's question in terms of these definitions.\n3.  Reference the mathematical theorem from a peer-reviewed paper that provides a complete classification of the finite groups satisfying the condition.\n4.  List the groups identified in the theorem.\n5.  Count the number of groups in the list to arrive at the final answer.\n6.  Present this information in a Python script that prints the explanation and the final count.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_group_theory_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the user's question by printing the established result from group theory literature.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"This problem requires identifying all finite groups that have a 'maximal by inclusion product-free set' of size 2.\")\n    print(\"Let's define the terms:\")\n    print(\"  - A 'product-free set' S in a group G is a subset where for any two elements a, b in S (including a=b), their product a*b is not in S.\")\n    print(\"  - Such a set S is 'maximal by inclusion' if it cannot be extended by adding any element from G without losing the product-free property.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe question is a classification problem in finite group theory.
