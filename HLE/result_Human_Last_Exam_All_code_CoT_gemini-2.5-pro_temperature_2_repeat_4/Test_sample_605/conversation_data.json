    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Information:** I will extract the weights of the variables from your query: $w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n2.  **Define the Calabi-Yau Condition:** A crucial property of a Calabi-Yau manifold (or link) defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial in a weighted projective space is that the degree of the polynomial, `d`, must equal the sum of the weights, $\\sum w_i$.\n3.  **Address the Polynomial:** The provided polynomial $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+...$ should be quasi-homogeneous with degree `d`. Let's check: The degree of the first term $z_1^8z_3$ is $8 \\cdot 22 + 49 = 225$. Most other terms also have a degree of 225. However, the term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a degree of $4 \\cdot 22 + 3 \\cdot 29 + 49 = 224$. This suggests a typo in the provided polynomial. However, the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the specified Calabi-Yau link depends only on the weights and the degree `d`, which is fixed by the Calabi-Yau condition, not the specific (and likely mistyped) polynomial itself.\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant is given by the formula $(d - \\sum w_i) / d$. Using the Calabi-Yau condition from step 2, I will substitute the values into this formula.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out each step of the process, including the final equation with all numbers shown explicitly.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau link\n    defined in a weighted projective space.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
