    "My plan is to address the user's question, which contains a factual inaccuracy about the plot of the movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n1.  I will first verify the plot details of the movie.\n2.  My research indicates that the main character, Tommaso, does not move to the United States. He remains in his hometown of Livorno, Italy.\n3.  Since the premise of the question is incorrect, I will write a Python script to print a clear statement explaining this.\n\n```python\n# The user's question is based on a false premise.\n# This script clarifies the plot point from the 1997 movie 'Ovosodo'.\n\nmovie_title = \"Ovosodo\"\ncharacter_name = \"Tommaso\"\nlocation_he_stays_in = \"Livorno, Italy\"\n\nprint(f\"Based on the plot of the movie '{movie_title}', the character {character_name} does not move to the United States.\")\nprint(f\"He remains in his hometown of {location_he_stays_in}.\")\n```\n<<<Based on the plot of the film, the character Tommaso does not move to the United States. He remains in his hometown of Livorno, Italy.>>>"
