    "This problem can be solved using fundamental principles of graph theory regarding the chromatic number. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the maximum number of colors required.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship between chromatic number and complete graphs:** Recall that a graph on $n$ vertices has a chromatic number of $n$ if and only if it is a complete graph, $K_n$.\n2.  **Apply the given constraint:** The problem states the graph $G$ is not a complete graph. This implies its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of vertices, $n$. This gives us an upper bound on the number of colors.\n3.  **Prove the maximum is achievable:** To show that this upper bound is the maximum possible value, we must construct an example of a graph with $n$ vertices that is not complete but requires $n-1$ colors. A simple construction is a graph composed of a complete subgraph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and one additional isolated vertex. This graph has $n$ vertices, is not complete, and its chromatic number is $n-1$.\n4.  **Calculate the final result:** Based on the above, the maximum number of colors is $n-1$. I will write a Python script to formalize this reasoning and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph G\n    with 12345 vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n    \n    print(f\"The graph G has n = {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"The problem states that G is not a complete graph (K_n).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Upper bound for the chromatic number (χ)\n    print(\"Step 1: Finding the upper bound for the number of colors.\")\n    print(f\"For any graph with {n} vertices, the chromatic number χ is at most {n}.\")\n    print(f\"A graph has a chromatic number χ = {n} if and only if it is the complete graph K_{n}.\")\n    print(f\"Since G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than {n}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, χ(G) ≤ {n} - 1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 2: Show that the maximum is achievable\n    print(\"Step 2: Proving the maximum is achievable.\")\n    print(\"We need to show that a non-complete graph with a chromatic number of n - 1 can exist.\")\n    print(f\"Let's construct such a graph: Consider a complete graph on {n-1} vertices, K_{n-1}, and add one single isolated vertex.\")\n    print(f\"This new graph has ({n-1}) + 1 = {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\")\n    print(f\"The K_{n-1} component requires {n-1} colors for a proper coloring.\")\n    print(f\"The chromatic number of this constructed graph is therefore {n-1}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 3: Conclusion and Final Calculation\n    print(\"Step 3: Conclusion.\")\n    print(\"Since the number of colors cannot exceed n-1, and we have found a graph that requires n-1 colors,\")\n    print(\"the maximum number of colors is n-1.\")\n    \n    max_colors = n - 1\n    \n    # Final output as an equation\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of colours is {n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n\n# Flushing the output to be safe in some environments.\nsys.stdout.flush()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
