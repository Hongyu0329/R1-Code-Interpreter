    "The task is to find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling, denoted as `u*`, in the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions. This is a classic problem in the study of critical phenomena and quantum field theory, solved using the Renormalization Group (RG).\n\nHere is my plan to derive and present the solution:\n1.  **Introduce the Beta Function:** The core of the RG analysis is the beta function, β(u), which describes how the coupling constant `u` changes with the energy scale. For ϕ⁴ theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the one-loop beta function is `β(u) = -ϵu + Bu²`, where `B` is a constant.\n2.  **Define the Fixed Point:** A fixed point `u*` is a value of the coupling where the scaling stops, meaning `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **Solve for the Fixed Point:** I will solve the equation `-ϵu* + B(u*)² = 0` to find the possible fixed points. This equation has a trivial solution (`u* = 0`, the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial one (`u* = ϵ / B`, the Wilson-Fisher fixed point).\n4.  **Substitute the Constant B:** For the standard normalization of the ϕ⁴ interaction, the constant `B` is `3 / (16π²)`. I will substitute this value into the expression for `u*`.\n5.  **Present the Final Expression:** I will write a Python script that walks through these steps, explaining the derivation and printing the final symbolic equation for `u*` in terms of `ϵ`, π, and numerical constants as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling in the ϕ⁴ theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the theoretical background.\n    print(\"Derivation of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u*.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"In ϕ⁴ theory near d=4 dimensions, we use dimensional regularization by setting d = 4 - ϵ,\")\n    print(\"where ϵ is a small positive parameter.\")\n    print(\"The Renormalization Group (RG) flow of the dimensionless coupling 'u' is described by the beta function β(u).\")\n\n    # Step 2: State the one-loop beta function.\n    print(\"\\nTo leading order in u and ϵ, the beta function is:\")\n    print(\"  β(u) = -ϵu + B * u²\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the standard (1/4!)gϕ⁴ interaction with g related to u, the constant B is:\")\n    b_numerator = 3\n    b_denominator_str = \"16π²\"\n    print(f\"  B = {b_numerator} / {b_denominator_str}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Define and solve for the fixed point.\n    print(\"\\nA fixed point, u*, is a value of the coupling where the RG flow stops, meaning β(u*) = 0.\")\n    print(\"We need to solve the equation:\")\n    print(\"  -ϵu* + B * (u*)² = 0\")\n    print(\"\\nThis equation has two solutions:\")\n    print(\"  1. u* = 0                       (The trivial Gaussian fixed point)\")\n    print(\"  2. -ϵ + B * u* = 0              (The non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point)\")\n\n    # Step 4: Express the non-trivial fixed point u*.\n    print(\"\\nSolving for the non-trivial fixed point gives:\")\n    print(\"  u* = ϵ / B\")\n\n    # Step 5: Substitute the value of B and show the final expression.\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the value of B gives the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point:\")\n    final_numerator = 16\n    final_denominator = 3\n    print(f\"  u* = ϵ / ( {b_numerator} / ({b_denominator_str}) )\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinally, simplifying the expression, we get the equation for the fixed point coupling:\")\n    # Fulfilling the requirement to output each number in the final equation.\n    pi_symbol = \"π\"\n    epsilon_symbol = \"ϵ\"\n    print(f\"  u* = ({final_numerator} * {pi_symbol}² * {epsilon_symbol}) / {final_denominator}\")\n\n\nsolve_fixed_point_coupling()\n```\n<<<(16 * π² * ϵ) / 3>>>"
