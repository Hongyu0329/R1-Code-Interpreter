# The task is to solve a Chinese character riddle using code.
# The plan is to interpret the riddle's phrases as components and then combine them.

# Part 1: Horizontal strokes
# The phrase "One horizontal stroke, another horizontal stroke, after another" describes the number of horizontal strokes.
num_horizontal = 3
horizontal_description = f"{num_horizontal} horizontal strokes"

# Part 2: Vertical strokes
# The phrases "one vertical stroke, another vertical stroke, after another" and
# "one vertical on the left, one vertical on the right" describe the vertical strokes.
# This implies one central vertical stroke and two on the sides, making a total of three.
num_vertical = 3
vertical_description = f"{num_vertical} vertical-ish strokes"

# The character that is visually composed of these elements is 丰 (fēng).
final_character = "丰"

# Now we present the solution as a final equation, showing each component (with its number)
# that leads to the answer.
print("Breaking down the riddle into an equation:")
print(f"({horizontal_description}) + ({vertical_description}) = ?")
print(f"\nThe character that fits this description is:")
print(final_character)
