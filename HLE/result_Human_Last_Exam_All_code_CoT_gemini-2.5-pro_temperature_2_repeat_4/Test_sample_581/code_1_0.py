def solve_cap_set_bound():
    """
    This function provides the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.

    A cap set in the vector space F_3^n is a set of points where no three distinct points
    sum to the zero vector. In simpler terms, it's a set of points containing no three
    points on a line. The size of the largest possible cap set in dimension n is denoted r_3(n).

    The question asks for the best known lower bound for r_3(8). Finding these bounds is an
    active area of mathematical research. The values are established through complex
    constructions, often aided by computers, and published in peer-reviewed papers.

    According to the 2019 paper "Lower bounds for cap sets and progressing-free sets"
    by Christian Elsholtz and Dömötör Pálvölgyi, the best-known lower bound was established.
