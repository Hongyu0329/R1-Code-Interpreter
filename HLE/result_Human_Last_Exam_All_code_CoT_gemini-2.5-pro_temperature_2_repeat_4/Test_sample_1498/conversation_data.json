    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this request:\n\nFirst, I will identify the specific section within the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that lists the names of the 25 Prophets of Islam mentioned in the Qur'an. To do this, I will refer to standard versions of the poem to find the exact verses (bayts).\n\nNext, based on the common numbering of the poem's verses, I will determine the starting and ending bayt numbers for this list of names.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script that will:\n1.  State the determined range of the verses.\n2.  Display the Arabic text for each verse in that range, preceded by its corresponding bayt number, to provide the exact source and fulfill the request to output each number in the final result.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the verses from 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_bayt = 26\n    end_bayt = 29\n\n    # Dictionary containing the verses (bayts) with the names of the prophets\n    prophet_bayts = {\n        26: \"هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ * صَالِحْ وَاِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",\n        27: \"لُوْطٌ وَاِسْمَاعِيْلُ اِسْحَاقُ كَذَا * يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\",\n        28: \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ * ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",\n        29: \"اِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيًّىا\"\n    }\n\n    # Print the answer\n    print(f\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe specific verses are:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Loop through the range and print each verse with its number\n    for i in range(start_bayt, end_bayt + 1):\n        print(f\"Bayt {i}: {prophet_bayts[i]}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<bayt 26 to bayt 29>>>"
