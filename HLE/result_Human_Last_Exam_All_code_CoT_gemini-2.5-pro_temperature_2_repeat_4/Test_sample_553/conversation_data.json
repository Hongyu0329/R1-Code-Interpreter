    "My plan is to identify the specific Beatles song based on the provided music theory clue.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Music Theory**: The request is for a song that starts with a chord progression moving from the tonic (the \"home\" chord, designated as I in a major key or i in a minor key) to the minor fifth (the chord built on the fifth note of the scale, but made minor, designated as v). This is a somewhat unconventional progression, which makes it a distinctive feature to search for.\n2.  **Recall and Analyze Beatles Songs**: I will go through well-known Beatles songs, focusing on their opening chords. A prime candidate for this type of sophisticated harmony is \"Michelle.\"\n3.  **Confirm the Song**: I will analyze the opening of \"Michelle.\" The song is in the key of F minor.\n    *   The tonic chord (i) is **F minor**.\n    *   The fifth note in the F minor scale is C. The chord built on this note is **C minor** (v).\n    *   The song's iconic opening vocal line (\"Michelle, ma belle...\") is harmonized with a move from F minor to C minor.\n4.  **Construct the Code**: I will create a Python script to present this finding clearly. The script will state the song's name and print the specific chord progression as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the Beatles song\n    that begins with a tonic to minor fifth chord progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key = \"F minor\"\n    tonic_chord_name = \"F minor\"\n    tonic_chord_roman = \"i\"\n    minor_fifth_chord_name = \"C minor\"\n    minor_fifth_chord_roman = \"v\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"Here is the breakdown of the musical progression:\")\n    print(f\"The key of the song is: {key}\")\n    print(\"\\nIn the final equation, the opening chords are:\")\n    # Using '->' to represent the jump from one chord to the next.\n    print(f\"{tonic_chord_name} ({tonic_chord_roman}) -> {minor_fifth_chord_name} ({minor_fifth_chord_roman})\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
