    "In a randomized uniform gossiping protocol, a node is selected uniformly at random, and then one of its neighbors is selected, also uniformly at random. This process samples an edge from the graph. We want to calculate the probability of sampling the specific bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: A barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each (K_5), connected by a single edge. This single connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Identify Key Nodes**: Let's label the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge as `u` and `v`. All other nodes are internal to one of the two cliques.\n3.  **Calculate Node Degrees**:\n    *   Each of the two cliques has `m=5` nodes.\n    *   In a complete graph K_5, a node has `m-1 = 4` neighbors.\n    *   The nodes `u` and `v` are connected to 4 nodes within their own clique and 1 node (each other) via the bottleneck edge. Therefore, their degree is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability**: The event \"sampling the bottleneck edge (u, v)\" can happen in two ways:\n    *   **Scenario A**: Node `u` is chosen first, and then it chooses node `v` as its neighbor.\n    *   **Scenario B**: Node `v` is chosen first, and then it chooses node `u` as its neighbor.\n5.  **Compute Probabilities for Each Scenario**:\n    *   The probability of picking any specific node from the 10 total nodes is `1/10`.\n    *   The probability of a node picking a specific neighbor is `1 / degree(node)`. For nodes `u` and `v`, this is `1/5`.\n    *   `P(Scenario A) = P(picking u) * P(u picks v) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n    *   `P(Scenario B) = P(picking v) * P(v picks u) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n6.  **Calculate Total Probability**: The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive scenarios.\n    *   `P(sampling bottleneck) = P(Scenario A) + P(Scenario B) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a \n    barbell graph with 10 nodes during randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A 10-node barbell graph has two 5-node cliques.\n    total_nodes = 10\n    clique_size_m = total_nodes // 2\n    \n    # The two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge have a degree of:\n    # (m-1) connections within their clique + 1 connection for the bottleneck edge.\n    degree_bottleneck_node = (clique_size_m - 1) + 1\n    \n    # The probability of picking any single node is 1 / total_nodes\n    prob_pick_node = 1 / total_nodes\n    \n    # The probability of a bottleneck node picking its neighbor across the bridge is\n    # 1 / its degree.\n    prob_pick_neighbor = 1 / degree_bottleneck_node\n    \n    # The total probability is the sum of two scenarios:\n    # 1.

Pick the second bottleneck node, then its neighbor across the bridge.\n    total_prob = prob_pick_node * prob_pick_neighbor + prob_pick_node * prob_pick_neighbor\n\n    print(\"To find the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (u,v), we use the formula:\")\n    print(\"P(sampling edge) = P(pick u) * P(u picks v) + P(pick v) * P(v picks u)\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(f\"Total nodes in the graph (N): {total_nodes}\")\n    print(f\"Degree of a bottleneck node (deg): {degree_bottleneck_node}\")\n    print(\"\")\n    # Print the equation with the specific numbers\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"P(bottleneck) = (1/{total_nodes}) * (1/{degree_bottleneck_node}) + (1/{total_nodes}) * (1/{degree_bottleneck_node})\")\n    print(f\"P(bottleneck) = {prob_pick_node:.2f} * {prob_pick_neighbor:.2f} + {prob_pick_node:.2f} * {prob_pick_neighbor:.2f} = {total_prob:.2f}\")\n    \n    # Required for the final answer format\n    original_stdout = sys.stdout\n    sys.stdout = open('/dev/null', 'w')\n    print(f'<<<{total_prob}>>>')\n    sys.stdout.close()\n    sys.stdout = original_stdout\n    \n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
