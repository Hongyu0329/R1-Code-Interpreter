# This script explains the mathematical conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point.
# It does not perform a calculation but uses print statements to format the theoretical answer as requested.

# --- Step 1: Clarifying Assumptions ---
print("This script outlines the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point.")
print("The function signatures in the query appear non-standard. We will assume the following symmetric forms, which are common in fixed-point theory:")
