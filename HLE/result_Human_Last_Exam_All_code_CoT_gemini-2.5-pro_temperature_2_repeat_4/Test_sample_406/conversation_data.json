    "Of course. The question asks for the mathematical conditions under which a set of three functions has a \"tripled fixed point\". This is a concept from the field of mathematics known as fixed-point theory.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Clarify the Definitions**: The function signatures provided (`G:Y*X*Y→Y` and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`) appear to contain typos (the name `G` is used twice, and the argument orders are asymmetric). I will proceed by correcting them to a more standard, symmetric form used in coupled and tripled fixed-point literature: `F: X*Y*Z→X`, `G: Y*Z*X→Y`, and `H: Z*X*Y→Z`.\n2.  **Define the \"Tripled Fixed Point\"**: Based on these corrected function signatures, I will define what an FGH-tripled fixed point is. It's a triplet `(x, y, z)` that simultaneously satisfies a system of three equations.\n3.  **State the Existence Conditions**: The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are a generalization of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. This requires the underlying sets (`X, Y, Z`) to be complete metric spaces and the functions (`F, G, H`) to satisfy a set of \"contractive\" inequalities.\n4.  **Provide a Python Script**: I will provide a Python script that uses `print` statements to clearly articulate these definitions and conditions, fulfilling the request for a code-based answer. The script will print the full equations and inequalities that represent the conditions.\n\nHere is the Python script that outlines the conditions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script explains the mathematical conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n# It does not perform a calculation but uses print statements to format the theoretical answer as requested.\n\n# --- Step 1: Clarifying Assumptions ---\nprint(\"This script outlines the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\")\nprint(\"The function signatures in the query appear non-standard.
