def solve_complexity():
    """
    This function calculates and prints the query complexity for the two specified regimes.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  A general sorting algorithm is to use N 'H' queries on the full strings to identify unique strings and then use 'C' queries to sort them.
    2.  The query complexity of this algorithm in the worst case (all strings are unique) is Theta(N log N).
    3.  This complexity holds for both regimes specified: N = 2^sqrt(L) and N = 2^((log L)^2).
    4.  We convert this complexity Q = Theta(N log N) to the given abc notation. The format is Theta(sqrt(N^a * (log N)^b * (log log N)^c)).
    5.  This implies Q^2 = Theta(N^a * (log N)^b * (log log N)^c).
    6.  Since Q^2 = (N log N)^2 = N^2 * (log N)^2, we can match the terms.
        N^a * (log N)^b * (log log N)^c = N^2 * (log N)^2 * (log log N)^0
    7.  From the final equation, we deduce the exponents:
        a = 2
        b = 2
        c = 0
    8.  Since the complexity is the same for both regimes, the answer is the same for both.
