# The three numbers representing the answers to parts (A), (B), and (C).
answer_A = 7
answer_B = 6
answer_C = 3

# The sum of the three numbers.
total = answer_A + answer_B + answer_C

# The final answers are 7, 6, and 3.
# This code will print the equation to demonstrate the solution.
print(f"{answer_A} + {answer_B} + {answer_C} = {total}")

# The puzzle asks for the three numbers separated by spaces.
# The answer is derived from the analysis above.
final_answer = f"{answer_A} {answer_B} {answer_C}"
# Although the prompt asks to print, it also asks for a final return format
# which is better suited for a non-code block output.
# I will print the human-readable string here, and provide the final answer
# string below as requested.
