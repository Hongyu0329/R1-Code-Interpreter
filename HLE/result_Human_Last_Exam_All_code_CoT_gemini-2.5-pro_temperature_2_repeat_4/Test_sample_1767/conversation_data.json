    "The Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive. When two topological systems, such as Chern insulators, are brought together to form a single system (in this case, by connecting them laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier), the Chern number of the combined system is simply the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the Chern number for the first insulator, C1.\n2.  Define the Chern number for the second insulator, C2.\n3.  Calculate the total Chern number of the junction, C_total, by adding C1 and C2.\n4.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers of the two individual insulators\nc1 = 1\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
