    In response to abiotic stressors like high temperature, organisms experience
    oxidative stress due to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
    The initial and most immediate cellular defense mechanism is the activation of
    the enzymatic antioxidant system. This system includes key enzymes like
    superoxide dismutase (SOD), which converts superoxide radicals into hydrogen
    peroxide, and catalase (CAT) and various peroxidases, which then break down

    hydrogen peroxide into harmless water and oxygen. This rapid, catalyzed
    response is the primary way cells initially counteract bursts of ROS to prevent
    widespread cellular damage.
