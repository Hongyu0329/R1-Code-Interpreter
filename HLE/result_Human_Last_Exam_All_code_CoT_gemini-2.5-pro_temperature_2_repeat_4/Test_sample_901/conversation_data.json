    "This is a classic E2 elimination problem where stereochemistry dictates the outcome. Here is a step-by-step analysis that leads to the product.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Substrate:** The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The key stereochemical feature is that the bromine at C1 and the methyl group at C2 are *trans* to each other.\n2.  **Analyze the Reagents:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, bulky base, and tert-butyl alcohol is the solvent. These conditions strongly favor an E2 elimination reaction.\n3.  **Recall E2 Requirements:** The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed must be in an *anti-periplanar* conformation. In a cyclohexane chair, this translates to a *trans-diaxial* arrangement.\n4.  **Draw Chair Conformations:**\n    *   **(A) Br-equatorial, Me-equatorial:** In one chair conformation, both the trans substituents will be equatorial. This is the more stable conformer because bulky groups prefer the equatorial position. However, an equatorial bromine is not anti-periplanar to any adjacent C-H bonds, so E2 elimination **cannot** occur from this conformer.\n    *   **(B) Br-axial, Me-axial:** For the reaction to happen, the molecule must flip to its less stable chair conformation, where both substituents are axial. In this conformation, the axial bromine is now in a position to be eliminated.\n5.  **Identify Possible Products:**\n    *   **Path 1 (Elimination towards C2):** To form a double bond between C1 and C2 (giving 1-methylcyclohexene, the Zaitsev product), the base would need to remove a proton from C2. In the reactive conformer (B), the methyl group is axial, meaning the proton on C2 is equatorial. This proton is **not** anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, so this pathway is blocked.\n    *   **Path 2 (Elimination towards C6):** To form a double bond between C1 and C6 (giving 3-methylcyclohexene, the Hofmann product), the base needs to remove a proton from C6. The carbon at C6 has two protons, one axial and one equatorial. The axial proton on C6 **is** anti-periplanar to the axial bromine on C1.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The E2 reaction can only proceed via one specific pathway: the removal of the axial proton on C6 while the molecule is in its less stable trans-diaxial conformation. This exclusively forms a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\nThe following Python code prints the final product name based on this chemical reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_e2_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the E2 reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    with potassium tert-butoxide and prints the name of the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    base = \"Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 elimination\"\n\n    # E2 reactions on cyclohexane rings require a trans-diaxial arrangement\n    # of the leaving group (Br) and the proton (H) to be removed.\n\n    # Analysis of the substrate's chair conformations:\n    # (1S,2R) means the Br and the methyl group are trans.\n    # Conformer 1: Br (equatorial), Methyl (equatorial).
