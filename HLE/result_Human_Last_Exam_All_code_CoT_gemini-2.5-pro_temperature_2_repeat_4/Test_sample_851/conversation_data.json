    "To determine which achiral and non-polar crystal classes have the correct symmetry for optical activity, we need to analyze the properties of the 32 crystallographic point groups.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Key Properties:**\n    *   **Optical Activity**: The ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light. A crystal class must be non-centrosymmetric (lack a center of inversion) to be optically active. However, some non-centrosymmetric classes are still not optically active because other symmetry elements (like specific mirror planes or rotoinversion axes) force the effect to zero. The classes that are truly optically active are: 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, -4, -42m, 6, 622, 23, and 432.\n    *   **Chirality**: A crystal is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This means its point group contains only proper rotation axes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6). The question asks for **achiral** classes, which *do* contain an improper symmetry element (inversion, mirror, or rotoinversion).\n    *   **Polarity**: A crystal is polar if it has at least one unique vector direction where the two ends are not related by symmetry. The question asks for **non-polar** classes.\n\n2.  **Filter the Crystal Classes:** We will systematically check each of the 32 crystal classes against these three criteria:\n    *   Must be optically active.\n    *   Must be achiral.\n    *   Must be non-polar.\n\n3.  **Implement in Code:** The Python script below will define a dataset of all 32 crystal classes with their respective properties. It will then iterate through this dataset to find and print the classes that meet all the specified conditions, thus identifying the correct answer from the given choices.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes based on specific symmetry properties.\n\n    This function filters the 32 crystallographic point groups to find those\n    that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data for the 32 crystal classes.\n    # Format: { 'Name': [is_chiral, is_polar, can_be_optically_active] }\n    # is_chiral: True if the point group only has proper rotations.\n    # is_polar: True if the point group has a unique polar axis.\n    # can_be_optically_active: True if the gyration tensor is non-zero.\n    crystal_data = {\n        '1': [True, True, True], '-1': [False, False, False],\n        '2': [True, True, True], 'm': [False, True, False], '2/m': [False, False, False],\n        '222': [True, False, True], 'mm2': [False, True, False], 'mmm': [False, False, False],\n        '4': [True, True, True], '-4': [False, False, True], '4/m': [False, False, False],\n        '422': [True, False, True], '4mm': [False, True, False], '-42m': [False, False, True], '4/mmm': [False, False, False],\n        '3': [True, True, True], '-3': [False, False, False],\n        '32': [True, False, True], '3m': [False, True, False], '-3m': [False, False, False],\n        '6': [True, True, True], '-6': [False, False, False], '6/m': [False, False, False],\n        '622': [True, False, True], '6mm': [False, True, False], '-62m': [False, False, False], '6/mmm': [False, False, False],\n        '23': [True, False, True], 'm-3': [False, False, False],\n        '432': [True, False, True], '-43m': [False, False, False], 'm-3m': [False, False, False],\n    }\n\n    print(\"Searching for crystal classes with the following properties:\")\n    print(\"1.
