Based on the medications you are picking up, the most important recommendation is regarding your use of {otc_medication} for headaches.

Your new prescription, {interacting_drug_1}, belongs to a class of drugs called SSRIs. Your {interacting_drug_2} both increase the {risk}. Taking them together can significantly increase this risk.

For future headaches, it would be safer for you to use a product that contains only {alternative}, as it does not carry this specific interaction risk with your {interacting_drug_1}.

Also, headaches can sometimes be a side effect of medications like Fluoxetine or Junel Fe. If your headaches continue, you should mention it to your doctor.
