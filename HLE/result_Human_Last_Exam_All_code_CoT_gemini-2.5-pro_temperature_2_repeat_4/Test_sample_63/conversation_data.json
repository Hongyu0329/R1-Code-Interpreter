    "My plan is to solve this riddle in a few steps.\n\n1.  First, I need to identify the person Kurt Vonnegut described as looking \"like a porcupine.\" While many people associate this description with Albert Einstein's hair, Vonnegut actually used it to describe someone else.\n2.  The second clue is that the man's name consists of two words that start with the same letter.\n3.  By researching Vonnegut's writings, specifically \"A Man Without a Country,\" I can find that he was referring to the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók.\n4.  The name \"Béla Bartók\" fits the \"two words, same starting letter\" rule perfectly.\n5.  I will create a Python script that stores the first and last names in variables and then prints them to reveal the full name.\n\n```python\n# The person Kurt Vonnegut described as looking like a porcupine,\n# and whose name consists of two words starting with the same letter.\n\nfirst_word = \"Béla\"\nsecond_word = \"Bartók\"\n\nprint(\"The man who looks like a porcupine in all the pictures is:\")\nprint(f\"{first_word} {second_word}\")\n```\n<<<Béla Bartók>>>"
